CITY STREET
It is a new day.
People are gathered along the street as if
they were waiting for a parade.
EVEY (V.O.)
Of the chaos that seemed to swallow
the beginning of the 21st century,
there is one thing I do remember.
Evey holds her father's hand.
Unable to see what is coming,
she can hear it.
EVEY (V.O.)
Very clearly, I can remember that
sound.
We hear them, hundreds of marching soldiers.
EVEY (V.O.)
And I remember those boots, black
leather that gleamed bright in the
morning sun.
I had never seen such
boots.
All moving in perfect
unison.
Little Evey hides in the forest of adults, clinging to her
father's leg, staring as row after row of boots march by with
military precision.
CITY STREET
In the midst of a political rally for the emerging new party
calling itself Norsefire, we find little Evey now on her
father's shoulders.
Dascombe, a young man, paces the podium, inciting the crowd.
DASCOMBE
The time has come, London, to
return to a bygone age, an age of
tradition, an age of values that
have been disparaged and all but
forgotten.
What this country needs
is a leader!
A true leader to
remind us of that age.
A righteous
leader with the strength of his
moral convictions to do what must
be done.
I give you that man!
I
give you our leader!
Adam Susan!
Adam Susan rises and the crowd cheers.
Evey's father looks
at her mother and again they clasp hands.
EVEY (V.O.)
It must have seemed so easy to
them.
They offered such a simple
deal; give up control and we will
restore order.
HOUSE
A gay man is dragged violently from his Piccadilly home.
Outside, he sees his lover being forced to the cobblestones.
EVEY (V.O.)
The homosexuals were next.
What
God had started with AIDS had to be
finished by man.
It was God's
work.
That's what we were told.
He reaches for him as the clubs rise and fall, vicious and
bloody.
EVEY (V.O.)
But once they were gone, there was
someone else.
Someone different.
In another neighborhood, we see the police arresting
Pakistanis.
EVEY (V.O.)
Someone dangerous.
In a different area, young black men are packed into a caged
van so tightly they are unable to move.
EVEY (V.O.)
There were those who understood
what was happening, who knew it was
wrong but who kept silent.
A young detective named Finch looks down as the van pulls
away.
When he looks up, another man in a military uniform
whose name is Almond is watching him.
EVEY (V.O.)
And in the vacuum of that silence,
order was imposed.
Finch sticks his pipe in his mouth and turns away.
STREET
Again, we see the marching boots.
EVEY (V.O.)
Order that was like those boots,
order that required rigorous
discipline.
Order that is exactly
the same, where each single step
falls with every step.
The order
of the many shaped into one.
We move through the columns of marching soldiers to a wall
where a poster has been plastered up.
The poster reads,
"Strength Through Purity, Purity Through Faith."
EVEY (V.O.)
Somehow in my heart, I knew it
wouldn't last.
As the sound of the marching fades, a shadow falls over the
sign.
After a moment, we hear the hiss of spray paint.
EVEY (V.O.)
What they thought they had crushed,
the spirit they believed trampled
and ground beneath the marching of
their boots, rose up, rose as if
from a four hundred year old grave,
rose to remind us all that day.
The shadow sprays a "V" over the poster.
FADE OUT.
FADE IN:
Close on a loudspeaker.
There is one on every major street
corner.
FATE (V.O.)
Good evening, London.
It's nine
o'clock, the fourth of November in
the year 2019 and this is the voice
of Fate broadcasting on 275 and 285
of the medium wave.
Beneath the loudspeaker is a surveillance system labeled,
"For your protection."
Bubble eyed lenses iris at the end of stalks that move,
insect-like, racheting and clicking as they watch a little
girl pedal her bicycle.
The little girl glances nervously
over her shoulder up at the mechanical eyes watching her.
FATE (V.O.)
People of London, be advised --
EVEY'S APARTMENT
There is a radio on a small makeup table.
FATE (V.O.)
-- that Braxton and Streathon are
quarantine zones as of today.
Evey is now a young woman.
She slips into a dress that is
little more than a nightgown.
She tries to adjust it,
pulling it down at the hem, pulling it up at the thin
shoulder straps, but it is like trying to hide behind a
lamppost.
FATE (V.O.)
It is suggested that these area be
avoided for reasons of health and
safety.
CITY STREET
Close on Evey's high heels, stumbling and awkward as she
walks down a dark cobblestoned street.
CITY STREET
Close on V's boots walking in the opposite direction so that
it seems they are walking towards each other.
EVEY (V.O.)
I don't know what brought us
together that night.
I had never
been to that part of Westminster
but ever since I've known him, I've
stopped believing in coincidence.
CITY STREET
Evey looks up and sees a man standing mostly in shadow.
EVEY
Excuse me?
Uh... excuse me,
Mister?
The man turns around.
It is not V.
EVEY
Would you like... uh, would you
like to sleep with me?
He smiles.
EVEY
I mean, for money.
MAN
That is the clumsiest bit of
propositioning I've ever heard.
EVEY
Oh god, I'm sorry.
MAN
Is this your first time, darling?
EVEY
Yes, no, I mean for money.
But I
know what you want and I'll do it.
She presses her body to his, using her little girl eyes and
her woman's mouth.
EVEY
Anything you want, mister.
Please,
I need the money.
I know I'm young
but I promise I know what I'm
doing.
MAN
No.
You don't know what you're
doing.
He pulls out his wallet and shows her a badge.
The sight of
it knocks the breath out of her.
EVEY
Christ, you're a Fingerman.
FINGERMAN 1
Give the little lady a prize.
FINGERMAN 2
I've got something to give her.
Evey turns and there are more Fingermen behind her.
FINGERMAN 1
Prostitution is a class H offense.
Know what that means?
It means
that we get to exercise our own
judicial discretion --
FINGERMAN 2
And you get to swallow it.
The Fingermen laugh.
EVEY
Oh god, please.
It's my first
time.
Please don't hurt me.
FINGERMAN 1
Gosh, fellas, look at those big
innocent eyes.
What do you think?
FINGERMAN 3
Spare the rod, spoil the child.
Fingerman 2 laughs hard as he drops his pants.
EVEY
Oh no!
He shoves her face first against a brick wall, lifting her
dress to expose her bottom.
EVEY
Please, don't!
FINGERMAN 3
You heard the man, sweetie.
This
rod's for your own good.
Suddenly, they are no longer alone.
V
"The multiplying villainies of
nature do swarm upon him."
FINGERMAN 3
What the hell --
V
"And fortune, on his damned
quarrel, smiling, showed like a
rebel's whore."
FINGERMAN 1
We're police officers, pal.
FINGERMAN 4
We're with the Finger.
FINGERMAN 3
So bugger off!
V
"Disdaining fortune with his
brandished steel, which smoked with
bloody execution."
In the clenched fist of black leather, we see a flash of
steel.
FINGERMAN 1
He's got a knife!
V attacks and at once we know this is no normal human being.
A single blow sends the largest of the Fingermen flying
backwards.
But more than his strength, it is his speed.
A gun is cocked but before the hammer falls, a knife is
buried in the Fingerman's chest and --
Before the body falls, the knife is gone.
It takes a handful of seconds and three bodies lay on the
ground.
V turns to the last Fingerman who is struggling to
pull his pants up.
FINGERMAN 3
Jesus Christ!
Don't hurt me!
V steps forward and he screams, bolting while holding his
pants up.
V
Good evening.
EVEY
Who -- Who are you?
V
Me?
I imagine all manner of names
shall be heaped upon my humble
visage but, for now, let us simply
say I am the villain.
He throws wide his cloak and bows deeply to her.
V
And you would be?
EVEY
Evey.
V
Of course.
They hear sirens rushing towards them.
In a blink, he scoops
her up and dashes into the shadows of a narrow alleyway.
ROOFTOPS
Police cars and several ambulances swarm over the area with
the dead Fingermen.
V watches them from above.
EVEY
Why did you do that?
Why did
you... help me?
V
Why indeed?
He takes out an old antique pocket watch.
It is almost
midnight.
V
Almost time.
EVEY
For what?
V
For the music.
EVEY
Music?
V
Yes, music.
My music.
You see.
Evey, I am a performer.
EVEY
Is that why you're wearing a mask?
V
We all wear masks.
Life creates
them and forces us to find the one
that fits.
Do you know what day it
is?
EVEY
Uh... November fourth.
V
Not for long.
He looks out where, rising above the rooftops, he can see Big
Ben.
V
"Remember, remember, the fifth of
November, the gunpowder treason and
plot.
I know of no reason why the
gunpowder treason should ever be
forgot."
The second hand sweeps into the final minute.
V
Tell me, Evey, what good is an
actor that plays his part to an
empty theatre?
EVEY
I don't know.
V
Nor do I.
That's why you are here.
I need you, Evey.
I need someone
to listen.
EVEY
To your music?
V
Yes.
Yes, to my music.
From his sleeve, he pulls a conductor's wand.
V
Can you hear it?
It's already
begun.
He begins to lightly tap the wand in the air and, very
faintly, we hear it.
EVEY
I can't hear anything.
V
At first, you have to listen very
carefully...
He continues to conduct and we begin to hear the music,
violins and horns that seem almost like a whisper or a wind
that steadily swells.
V
Ahh, yes.
There it is.
Beautiful,
is it not?
He turns to the parapet, his gestures growing grander as the
music rises and we recognize Tchaikovsky's 1812 overture.
The music mounts a climax and V points the wand at Big Ben as
cymbals crash --
Big Ben explodes with such force the world seems to shake,
while --
V, smiling, always smiling, points again with another
crescendo and --
The statue of justice is blown to smithereens.
V nods in appreciation while mustering the music towards it's
finale as fireworks begin lighting up the sky.
EVEY
Oh my...
Everywhere across the city, people stand transfixed by the
dazzling shimmer of the fireworks until --
A strobing final blitz leaves a single, starry image floating
in the smoke filled sky.
It is the letter V.
EVEY
It's beautiful...
V
Thank you.
From every direction, the city screams with the panicked
sound of sirens.
NEW GOVERNMENT BUILDING
A massive modern building that is the seat of the new
government.
A long, black car pulls up to the entrance.
Adam Susan gets
out, wearing a long black trenchcoat over his pajamas.
He is
the Leader and he looks older, heavier, and meaner.
He hurries past the heavily armed guards, barely
acknowledging the snap and cock of their Nazi-like salute.
JORDAN TOWER
The only operating broadcast tower in London; home of the
Mouth.
TRAIN STATION
People are hurrying to board a departing train.
RAILROAD
The train rumbles along, heading for a tunnel.
TRAIN
For a flashing instant, we see V in silhouette, cloak
swirling around him like dark wings as he jumps from the
bridge onto the train.
TRAIN
Deep in the tunnel, a dark figure glides across the rooftops.
LARKHILL RESETTLEMENT CAMP - FLASHBACK
A sign reads, "Larkhill Resettlement Camp."
V (V.O.)
Where they sent the undesirables.
A caged truck packed with minorities rolls into the gates
which are topped with spools of razor wire.
LARKHILL OVENS - FLASHBACK
We see a detail of black and Indian men, shoveling mounds of
black ash from a series of furnace like ovens.
As the shovels lift, we see blackened bones and burnt skulls.
LARKHILL MAIN YARD - FLASHBACK
Prothero saunters through the lines of camp prisoners.
V (V.O.)
But there was one task you took to
with exceptional relish.
Remember
the medical block, Commander?
I
believe you called it the funny
farm.
You were the one that
selected the prisoners.
You hand
picked each one.
Prothero steps in front of a woman who remains beautiful
despite the suffering she has endured.
Prothero smiles.
PROTHERO
Her.
As the guards grab her, we become aware of a man that is
staring at Prothero.
He is one of the prisoners but we do
not see his face.
Prothero notices the man.
He doesn't like the way the man is
staring at him.
PROTHERO
You.
TRAIN STATION
The station is swarming with police.
A stretcher wheels a
body in a black plastic bag out from Prothero's car.
WESTMINSTER ABBEY - DAY
The church doors have opened with the flow of parishioners as
the final mass of the day has ended.
The tide slowly pours out onto the sidewalk, separating
around the clumps of people that conglomerate to network and
gossip.
Church bells toll in the orange dusk above them.
Helen Heyer, a woman whose spite and guile are hidden behind
her looks and clothes she drapes them with, charges into the
gossipers, her trophy husband in tow, a timid looking man
that we recognize as Conrad Heyer.
CONRAD
Hello, Rosemary.
Derek, how --
Helen's head snaps over at the mention of the name.
HELEN
Derek!
She pushes past Conrad, giving Derek Almond an exuberant kiss
on both cheeks.
HELEN
Darling, how are you?
Hello,
Rosemary.
Always behind her husband, Rosemary Almond smiles nervously
as she straightens her drab church dress.
ROSEMARY
Hello.
DEREK
It's so good to see you.
Since
this bloody terrorist business, the
old man has me literally chained to
the office.
Helen pouts at him.
HELEN
Oh, you poor dear.
Derek taps the bottom of his cigarette box, drawing one with
his lips.
DEREK
It comes with the job.
How are
things in the Eye, Conrad?
CONRAD
Well, we've been working some bugs
out of the new Mark IX fiber optic
network, actually --
HELEN
Oh, Conrad, don't be such a bloody
bore.
Do tell us about the
terrorist, Derek.
Is it true he
blew up Big Ben and the old Bailey?
DEREK
I'm afraid so.
We're dealing with
a pathological psychotic in the
most extreme case.
We'll catch him
though.
I promise.
Helen rubs her white sable against her body.
HELEN
Oh, it sounds dreadfully exciting.
Aren't you glad you've got such a
ruthless, implacable brute for a
husband, Rosemary?
ROSEMARY
Yes, well --
HELEN
Believe me, you're lucky.
You
could be struck with a professional
peeping tom like Conrad.
England's
highest paid voyeur, aren't you
darling?
CONRAD
Helen, I think we'd better --
HELEN
Oh yes, of course.
We have to get
back so the little pervert can
watch what the neighbors do after
Sunday lunch.
He's so exciting.
Derek laughs as they climb into their car.
HELEN
Ciao!
DEREK
Goodbye, Helen.
Conrad.
Rosemary waves as it pulls off.
ROSEMARY
She's a bit hard on him, isn't she?
Derek sneers at her.
DEREK
Until you're half the woman of
Helen's sophistication, I'd keep
your little mouth shut.
He throws the cigarette at her feet.
DEREK
Really, just look at the way you
dress.
WESTMINSTER ABBEY - NIGHT
A pair of headlights melt through the heavy night's fog as a
taxicab pulls into the circle drive.
WESTMINSTER ABBEY - NIGHT
A shadow begins moving across the manicured grounds borne on
the thick mist like a dark phantom.
V glides toward the
rectory, cloak undulating against the dark, wet wind.
MAIN GATE - NIGHT
The guards look out into the night, fear suddenly gripping
their faces.
V emerges demonically through the parting veils of fog, the
white smiling mask bobbing eerily up and down as he rushes
them.
A cigarette drops from the first guard's mouth, red embers
exploding when it hits the wet cement.
Close as the two guards claw for their arms and the white hot
flash of V's knives --
That slice like talons.
The two men crumple to the ground, clutching their gaping,
gurgling wounds.
A whisper.
V sprints into the courtyard.
WESTMINSTER ABBEY - NIGHT
Evey sprints past the dead guards at the man gate and into
the fog.
BISHOP'S QUARTERS - NIGHT
Close on a stain of white vomit and blood on the thick pile
of a Persian rug.
It is encircled in police chalk.
Pull back to reveal the chalk outline where the body of
Bishop Lilliman was found.
The circled bloodstain floats
above the head like the last word balloon of a crude comic
strip character.
The Bishop's quarters is slowly being picked over by a
forensic team from the Nose.
A photographer's flash bursts
against a painted "V" on the wall near the body outline.
At the window, Finch chews on his pipe, staring at a plastic
evidence bag that contains a single violet carson rose.
DOMINIC
No prints yet, sir.
Just like
Prothero.
FINCH
I want those tapes from the Ear in
my office tonight, Dominic.
DOMINIC
Yes, sir.
They're on top of it.
Finch turns to a muscular man named Creedy, second in command
at the Finger.
FINCH
Any word from your superior, Mr.
Creedy?
CREEDY
Mr. Almond doesn't seem to be
answering his page, sir.
I'm sure
he's in the field.
FINCH
Quite.
EMPTY STREET
A small figure moves down the dark wet street, the
cobblestones glistening like black scales.
The huddled figure arcs across the street in the shadows,
avoiding the pools of streetlight.
It is Evey, a frightened
look on her face.
KITTY KAT KELLER
A gaggle of drunks exit the bar, laughing and singing as they
pass a small figure.
CITY STREET
The emergency lights blaring, Finch's car squeals around a
corner.
DELIA SURRIDGE'S HOME
Finch's car bucks up onto the sidewalk.
Finch and Dominic tear out of the car and barrel into the
house.
DELIA SURRIDGE'S HOME
Evey rushes around a corner to see a crime scene bathed in
siren light.
She pushes up to the police barricade as the
M.E.'s load a draped body into their van.
EVEY
Oh no... V?
She tries to angle around to get a better look when a man in
a brown overcoat grabs her from behind and drags her into the
alley.
LARKHILL GARDEN - DAY - FLASHBACK
Dr. Surridge slowly moves through the Larkhill garden, an
incredible abundance of fruits, vegetables and violet carson
roses.
DELIA (V.O.)
I'm glad Prothero let room five
have a go at the gardening project.
He is quite proficient.
Prothero
was reluctant to allow an inmate
access to the tool and chemical
supply at first but now the fat
toad is delighted.
The crop has
almost doubled.
She traces the petals of a rose with her finger.
DELIA (V.O.)
He also grows roses.
Beautiful
roses.
LARKHILL LOUNGE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
Men and women clutch at their throats as they tumble out into
the yard.
DELIA (V.O.)
The ones at the front ran straight
into the gas.
It was horrible.
They drop to the ground, gasping and vomiting.
The back door is kicked open, Dr. Surridge following two
guards.
DELIA (V.O.)
A few of us made it out through the
rear door.
You could hear men
screaming everywhere.
I hate the
sound of men screaming.
She looks out, men running, collapsing, dying in a yellow
green haze that seems everywhere.
DELIA (V.O.)
In the center of the camp,
everything was on fire.
Everyone
running in all directions.
We had
hardly enough time to get our
bearings when the ovens exploded.
Another explosion wracks the compound.
The pillar of flame
rises into the black sky, dwarfing the men in the camp.
Dr. Surridge sees a gaping hole in the medical block, its
insides turned out like an unholy birth.
DELIA (V.O.)
It was the man in room rive.
I
couldn't have known.
The chemical
supplies, grease solvents, ammonia,
fertilizer.
He'd been making
things with them.
Close on a soldier, doubled over, hacking up bile.
DELIA (V.O.)
Mustard gas...
A sticky blue fire licks up from a blackened body like a dura
flame.
DELIA
And napalm.
Dr. Surridge turns as a silhouette crosses the yard, backlit
by a curtain of fire.
DELIA (V.O.)
And in the yard, I saw him.
He had
the flames behind him.
He was
naked.
The man stops.
DELIA (V.O.)
He looked at me...
Dr. Surridge seems to wilt under his stare but cannot look
away.
DELIA (V.O.)
As if I were an insect.
Oh god.
As if I were something mounted on a
slide.
The flames convulse hypnotically behind him.
DELIA (V.O.)
He looked at me.
INTERROGATION ROOM
Pull back from a shadow, the outline of the interrogator's
silhouette against sharp light coming into frame.
EVEY (V.O.)
I read her letter.
Hid it.
Slept.
Woke.
They questioned me.
And I
read her letter again.
Rossiter is buckling Evey's thin arms and legs into a chair.
Her now frail frame can barely hold up the frayed brown
slipover.
EVEY (V.O.)
Over and over...
On the table in front of her, there is a large wash basin of
water.
Rossiter dunks her head into it.
EVEY (V.O.)
Her name was Valerie.
PARK - DAY - FLASHBACK
Two young women cuddle on a park bench under a London summer
sky, feeding the pigeons.
VALERIE (V.O.)
But it was my integrity that was
important.
Is that so selfish?
It
sells for so little but it's all we
have left in this place...
The black haired girl nibbles on the blonde's ear.
VALERIE (V.O.)
It is the very last inch of us...
MEADOW - DAY - FLASHBACK
Two women weep in each other's arms, embracing in a perfect
knee high meadow.
VALERIE (V.O.)
Work improved.
I got small film
roles, then bigger ones.
The blonde woman brushes away a tear from the other's cheek.
VALERIE (V.O.)
In 2006, I starred in "The Salt
Flats."
That's where I met Ruth.
We fell in love.
We pull back and see we are on location for a movie and the
two women are being filmed.
LONDON STREET - DAY - FLASHBACK
The sound of marching explodes as columns of men in brown
uniforms and jack boots fill the streets.
VALERIE (V.O.)
And after that there were no more
roses...
ROOF - NIGHT
The two figures stand in the door of the roof access, a
raging tempest oozing from a split sky.
Something draws Evey out into the storm.
Slowly, she walks beneath it, the wind and rain pounding
against her thin frame.
Evey lets the coarse slipover fall
to the ground and stares straight up into the storm, naked,
the elements soaking into her very being.
V moves up behind her.
V
Do you feel it?
EVEY
Everything's so -- different.
V
I know.
Five years ago, I too
stared beneath a night like this.
Naked under a roaring sky.
A low rumble of thunder washes over London.
V
The night is yours, Evey.
Seize
it.
Encircle it within your arms.
His words buffet against her with the sheets of rain.
V
Bury it in your heart up to the
hilt.
She raises her arms to embrace the raging torrent.
V
Become transfixed and
transfigured --
A jagged bolt of lightning shatters the sky.
V
Forever.
NEW GOVERNMENT BUILDING
Finch gets out of a police car and looks up the black face of
the modern building.
He sighs and taps his pipe against the
heel of his shoe.
DASCOMBE
Finch!
Finch turns to find Dascombe hurrying towards him.
DASCOMBE
Do you know what this is all about?
FINCH
No, but I can guess.
DASCOMBE
What?
FINCH
"Remember, remember, the fifth of
November."
DASCOMBE
Oh come on.
He's long gone.
He
has to be.
He did what he came to
do and it's over.
Finch chews on his pipe.
DASCOMBE
Isn't it?
FINCH
Not for us.
He turns and heads into the building.
FADE OUT.
FADE IN:
NEW GOVERNMENT BUILDING - DAY
A dark November sky hangs like a shroud over the building.
LEADER (V.O.)
A year, gentlemen.
ALLEYWAY
A police car is parked in a dark alley.
It is raining and
the windows of the car are completely steamed.
CREEDY
Oh god, yes!
He is sweating, his knuckles white as he squeezes the
steering wheel, panting.
We hear a noise like a very wet kiss and then a woman's
voice.
HELEN
"The most important member of my
cabinet."
Yes it is, isn't it,
dear?
Helen lifts her head out of his lap.
Her lipstick is smeared
about her mouth.
CREEDY
Oh, don't stop.
HELEN
I stop when you stop.
What did he
say next?
CREEDY
I can't --
She whispers in his ear while playing with his lap.
HELEN
Come on, Peter, what are you afraid
of?
Almond used to tell me
everything and you're twice the man
he was.
CREEDY
He asked me... if I loved my
country.
HELEN
Oh yes, I can tell you do love your
country, almost as much as you love
this...
She lowers her head into this lap.
CREEDY
Oh god...
HELEN
Go on.
CREEDY
Then he asked me to do something...
oh, oh...
HELEN
What?
CREEDY
Helen, I can't.
I can't tell you.
Helen lifts her head.
HELEN
He told you to frame someone as the
terrorist.
CREEDY
My god?!
How did you know that?
HELEN
I know Adam Susan.
Now who was it?
CREEDY
No way.
I can't tell you that.
HELEN
Yes you can, honey.
You can and
you will.
You have to trust me,
love.
We're going to help each
other.
CREEDY
Helen, please.
HELEN
Look at that face.
You see?
You're just bursting to tell me.
Her head drops back down.
Creedy moans.
HELEN
Now who was it?
CREEDY
It was... Fi... Fi... FINCH!
The name seems to orgasm from his mouth.
JORDAN TOWER
The military forces have begun to swarm.
V
Four hundred years ago, a great
citizen made a most significant
contribution to our common culture.
It was a contribution forged in
secrecy and stealth although it is
best remembered in noise and bright
light.
TELEVISION STORE
A crowd has gathered, watching through the window.
V
To commemorate that glorious night
at precisely the stroke of
midnight, the edifice of their
world will erupt with enough sound
and fury to shake the earth.
All I
ask is that you join me at the
gates to watch as the past is
erased, the pathway cleared so that
together we can start toward a new
day.
JORDAN TOWER
The Leader climbs out of his limo and is met by one of his
captains.
LEADER
I want this man dead!
I want him
shot on sight!
CAPTAIN
Yes, sir.
TELEVISION STORE
The crowd is much larger.
V
Until then, I bid you goodnight.
Every screen suddenly goes black.
The crowd turns to each
other, unsure of what to do.
CITY STREET
One of the Ear's black vans has been modified with large
speakers wired to the roof.
As the van rolls down the
street, the speakers drone with a looped message.
SPEAKERS
The terrorist is dead.
No further
threat exists.
Everything is under
control.
Out of the back, soldiers hurl leaflets that swirl and
flutter in the van's wake.
The little girl on the bicycle that we saw earlier stops and
picks up one of the leaflets.
It has a picture with the body of Roger Dascombe beneath the
headline, "The terrorist is dead!
London is safe once
again!"
LITTLE GIRL
Bollocks.
She crumbles the leaflet and throws it.
LITTLE GIRL
Bollocks!
She gets off her bike and takes something out of the
backpack.
LITTLE GIRL
He's not dead!
It's all bollocks!
Turning to a nearby wall, she spray paints a large circle
around a "V".
TELEVISION STORE - NIGHT
No one is watching.
LEADER
What we have endured this long year
was no accident, no mere
coincidence.
This was not a simple
act of terror conducted by a
singular madman.
No, this was a
test.
STREET CORNER - NIGHT
The megaphones blast the Leader's voice.
LEADER (V.O.)
"If any man have an ear, let him
hear."
LONDON
The sun rises over London.
It is the morning of the fourth.
NEW GOVERNMENT BUILDING
Conrad pulls his car into his reserved space.
CITY STREET
In his car, Finch races to a corner and slams on the brakes.
He gets out, staring at a shadow on the ground: a "V" in a
circle.
The shadow is cast by a sign for Victoria Station, part of
the abandoned subway.
The gates are chained shut.
He fires his pistol into the
lock, kicks open the rusting gates, and descends into the
underground.
CONRAD'S HOUSE
Creedy opens the trunk of his car.
In the phosphorescent
glow of the streetlight, the set of knives gleam.
He bundles
the costume that he tried to planet on Finch into his arms,
then slams the trunk.
Above, a window blind that was cracked open snaps shut.
CITY STREET
Dozens of military vehicles swarm around the entrance to
Victoria Station while heavily armed men pour through the
gates of the underground.
CITY STREET
An enormous crowd has begun to gather in the streets
surrounding the New Government Building.
With the crowd, a
restlessness swells against each barricade erected by the
military.
A sergeant stands on an armored car, speaking through a
megaphone.
SERGEANT
Return to your homes!
There is
nothing to see!
The terrorist is
dead!
RABBLE ROUSER 1
He ain't dead!
RABBLE ROUSER 2
He'll be here, just like he said!
CITY STREET
Midnight approaches and the crowd feels it.
Spilling
everywhere, they fill the streets like a flood.
CITY STREET
The crowd surges against a barricade when a voice cries out
across the city echoing through the megaphone on every
corner.
EVEY (V.O.)
"Remember, remember, the fifth of
November!"
High above the gathered mass, a masked figure steps out onto
a roof parapet.
The crowd explodes.
ROOFTOP
Dressed as V, Evey stands on the roof's edge, speaking into a
microphone.
EVEY
I have come here tonight to keep a
promise.
A promise that is over
four hundred years old.
Tonight I
am here to give you your freedom!
Again, the crowd bursts into a frenzy.
EVEY
Since mankind's dawn a handful of
oppressors have accepted the
responsibility over our lives,
responsibility that we should have
accepted ourselves.
By doing so,
they took our power.
By doing
nothing, we gave it away.
The voice booms over the mesmerized crowd.
EVEY
Tonight, our world will change.
Our leaders will be gone and we
must choose what comes next.
A
return to the chains of others or
lives of our own.
A world of the
past or one of the future.
She feels the sea of humanity beneath her, almost channeling
their energy.
EVEY
Let us choose carefully, London,
and when we do, let us mark well
and remember, remember this fifth
of November!
The crowd screams as one and their scream becomes --
ROOFTOPS
Hidden and alone, Evey pulls the mask from her face.
V (V.O.)
Please let me hear the music... one
last time... my music.
Almost unconsciously, Evey raises her hand and coaxes the
first soft notes as he had once done.
V (V.O.)
At first, you have to listen
carefully.
The violins of the 1812 overture steadily rise.
V (V.O.)
Ah, yes.
There it is.
Beautiful,
is it not?
Evey smiles, her hand still gently conducting.
EVEY
Yes, my love.
Yes it is.
NEW GOVERNMENT BUILDING
The entire building opens like a time-lapsed rose blooming
with brilliant orange petals of flame.
CITY STREET
The crowd is awash in the baptismal glow of erupting flame.
ROOFTOP
Evey watches the explosion, a star-burst of flaming debris
searing against the night sky like fireworks.
CITY STREET
The masses burst through the barricades with a euphoric
frenzy.
ROOFTOP
The explosion begins to slowly die.
EVEY (V.O.)
I know that there is only one way
to repay him for what he did.
She looks down at the mask.
EVEY (V.O.)
And I know that that way is going
to take a lot of hard work.
She smiles.
EVEY (V.O.)
I know this like I know the sun
will rise tomorrow and beneath that
new sun, our work will begin.
The fire fades and Evey turns, cradling the mask, and walks
away.
FADE OUT.
