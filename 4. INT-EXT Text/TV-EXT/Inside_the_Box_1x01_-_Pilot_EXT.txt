      KYLE CHISOLM is running.  Down 16th Street, his breath puffing
      small clouds into the winter air as he goes.  A tall, handsome
      black man (30s)in a nice suit running toward the White House. 
      Wingtips leaping slush puddles.  Gracefully dodging traffic. 
      In spite of the hurry, he can't help checking out his
      reflection as he passes a store window.  Involuntary vanity. 
      Checks his watch.  Damn.  Late the first day.  Phone rings.

                                    KYLE
                    Hello?  (Pause)  I know.  I'm almost
                    there.  (Pause)  As fast as I can.


      Molly stands at the White House gate.  It's cold and she's
      got bare legs and un-sensible shoes.  She's trying to make
      small talk with the guards who couldn't be less interested.

                                      MOLLY
                    Cold huh?
                          (no reply)
                    Pretty cool guarding the White House.

      Molly realizes how goofy she seems.  A producer from NNC comes
      out of the gate and hands her the tape.


      Molly sits in her car parked outside the NNC Washington Bureau,
      sobbing quietly.  Too afraid to get out of the car.  She's
      half rehearsing her speech to Jake in her head, half trying
      to imagine her future after she gets fired.


      Jake and Kyle walk back from getting coffee. Side by side on
      a busy street.  Crowded sidewalk, traffic humming.  They check
      their Blackberries, and sip coffees, and talk.

                                    KYLE
                    So? How bad was it?

                                    JAKE
                          (laughing)
                    What, Vomitgate?  It was bad.              ROBBINS   INSIDE THE BOX   PILOT    1/21/09            29.

                                    KYLE
                    You think they're gonna pull me?

                                    JAKE
                    No way.  You're a star.  You'd have
                    to throw up ON the President for them
                    to pull you.  

                                    KYLE
                    I don't know what to do.  You think I
                    should run with it?  Maybe try to get
                    on Jon Stewart?  You know, laugh along
                    with them about it? 

                                    JAKE
                    Can you keep your dinner down?

      Kyle's phone rings.  He answers.

                                    KYLE 
                    Hey beautiful.

      Jake's phone rings.  He answers.  Now the two are walking
      side by side, on their phones, often talking over each other.

                                    JAKE
                    Hi.  Look, I'm sorry.

                                    KYLE
                    I know.  You know I didn't mean that.

                                    JAKE
                    That's not what I meant.  I just don't
                    have time to...

                                    KYLE
                    I don't think I can today.  I have to
                    do a story for tonight.

                                    JAKE
                    It's just been crazy with the
                      inauguration and stuff.  Things are
                    going to calm down.  I promise...

                                    KYLE
                    Ok, ok.  All you have to say is that
                    it's important.  What time?

                                    JAKE
                    I know it's tonight.  It's in my
                    calendar.  Don't worry.

                    You too.  Bye.

      Both hang up.  Eye each other.  

                                    JAKE  (CONT'D)
                    You still doing that?

                                    KYLE
                    Yeah.  You?

                                    JAKE
                    Yeah.

                                    KYLE
                    I thought you were going to end that.

                                    JAKE
                    I was... I am.
                          (pause)
                    I think if you can get on Jon Stewart,
                    that's the right move.

      They stop in front of NNC and run into Catherine.

                                      CATHERINE
                    Aren't you supposed to be covering
                    the White House not the pretty boy
                    gossip hour?  Can I have a word alone
                    with Mrs. Chisolm?

      Kyle exits with a slight chuckle that almost masks how much
      she gets under his skin. 

                                      CATHERINE  (CONT'D)
                    If you breathe a word of this to the
                    Fresh Prince...

                                    JAKE
                    Don't worry.  Why didn't you hook
                    Donnegan with Ewing's mystery lady? 
                    He would've gone nuts for it. 

                                      CATHERINE
                    Once we give him that, it's out of
                    our hands.  I don't trust him. 

                                    JAKE
                    And what about the mystery lady?

                                      CATHERINE
                    Tanya Simon?  Lives in Arlington. 
                    Looks like Ewing has been funneling
                    her money for years.                ROBBINS   INSIDE THE BOX   PILOT    1/21/09            31.

                                    JAKE
                    How much?

                                      CATHERINE
                    Enough.  I left her a couple messages,
                    but I have a feeling I'm going to
                    have to pay her a visit.  I'm going
                    out there tonight.  Want to come?  

                                    JAKE
                    I've got plans I really can't change.

                                      CATHERINE
                    C'mon.  You're going to break up with
                    her anyway.  

      She gives Jake a look that has just enough flirt in it that
      he can't resist.


      Catherine and Jake are sitting in her car drinking coffee. 
      Her car is a mess.  They're sharing a bag of pretzels, and
      pretending they aren't feeling some lurking sexual tension. 

                                    JAKE
                    This was more fun when we smoked.

                                      CATHERINE
                    Yeah, turns out that's bad for you.
                    Hey, we should get Hannah Montana to
                    stake out Ewing's house too.  Just in
                    case.

                                    JAKE
                    Who?

                    Your little pet. 

                                    JAKE
                    Molly.  Sure.  Anything much on this
                    Tanya woman?

                                      CATHERINE
                    Thirty five maybe.  Single mom. She's
                    a public defender.  I thought maybe
                    she met Ewing in court when he was a
                      prosecutor, but the dates don't match
                    up.  Doesn't make sense. 

                                    JAKE
                    Why not?

                                      CATHERINE
                    Just doesn't feel like the kind of
                    woman who would work as a public
                    defender would take hush money from
                    the governor. 

                                    JAKE
                    I think a single parent who lives on

                    said when I told her?               ROBBINS   INSIDE THE BOX   PILOT    1/21/09            34.

                                    JAKE
                    She said you've been wearing the wrong
                    lipstick? 

                                      CATHERINE
                    Close.  She said, "Well you can always
                    waitress sweetheart."

                                    JAKE
                    Well, in her world that's reassuring. 

                                      CATHERINE
                    It's exactly what she said when I
                    quit law school.  I just hate when
                    things confirm my mother's delusion
                    that I'm like her. 

                                    JAKE
                    Your mom is hot. 

                                      CATHERINE
                    You are so vile.  And my mom is not
                    hot, she's just easy.  Men seem not
                    to be able to tell the difference.

                    I hate this part. 

      Catherine and Jake get out of her car and walk over toward a
      woman (30's) and her 10 year-old daughter getting out of their
      car in front of a very modest suburban ranch house.  The woman
      (Tanya) is a little exotic and very pretty.

                    a few messages.

      The woman makes a beeline for her front door, pulling her
      daughter with her.  She looks scared, confused.

                    to me, but there are going to be more
                    after me.  I can help you.

      The woman and daughter go inside and slam the door.  


      Molly sits in her car.  She's slumped down a little, half
      reading, but keeping one eye on a house a few doors down. 
      She jumps when someone knocks on the passenger door.  It's
      Jake. He climbs in, handing her the big stack of papers off
      the passenger seat.              ROBBINS   INSIDE THE BOX   PILOT    1/21/09            38.

                    On the good days I feel lucky they
                    pay me to just find out stuff and
                    help explain it back on TV.  The bad
                    days, I think there has to be more to
                    life than filling up the time between
                      pharmaceutical commercials. 

                                      MOLLY
                    So why do you do it?

                                    JAKE
                    When it's good, it's the most fun
                    I've ever had.  And believe me, I've
                    had plenty of fun. 

      Molly blushes at the innuendo from Jake. A car pulls past,
      both of them slump down in their seats.  They peek up as the
      car stops in front of Ewing's house.  Two men get out and go
      to the door. Ewing lets them in.

                                    JAKE  (CONT'D)
                    Do you know who that was?

                                      MOLLY
                    It looked like that guy Harper, the
                    lawyer guy.  Don't know the other.

                                    JAKE
                    JD Harper, White House Counsel and
                    Rick Warden, Deputy Chief of Staff.

                                      MOLLY
                    Cool.

                                    JAKE
                          (dialing the phone)
                    Yeah, really cool.


      Sam approaches a nice looking house.  It's clear she is
      nervous, maybe even a little scared.  She takes a deep breath,
      steadies herself, and rings the bell.  The door opens and we
      see the FBI guy from her mid-day romp.  He looks shocked.

                                    MAN
                    What the hell are you doing here?

                                    SAM
                    Good evening Special Agent Tompkins. 
                    I was hoping I could ask you a couple
                      questions.

                                      TOMPKINS
                          (whispering loudly)
                    Are you insane? My family is in there
                    having dinner right now!

                                    SAM
                    Relax, it's business.  I need to know
                    if you've got anything on Governor
                    Ewing taking Justice Fanning's seat
                    on the Supreme Court.               ROBBINS   INSIDE THE BOX   PILOT    1/21/09            46.

                                      TOMPKINS
                    What?!  How the hell is that even an
                    FBI story?!

                                    SAM
                    Last I looked your office does the
                      background checks.

                                      TOMPKINS
                    This is bullsh... Can't you just call
                    my cell in the morning?

                                    SAM
                    For once you're going to give me what
                    I need.  And I'm so much more
                      persuasive in person.

                                      TOMPKINS
                    You've got no shame Hathaway.


      Sam, Molly and the van cruise along a dirt road running along
      the Potomac.  She's scanning the river bank.

                                      MOLLY
                    There! Over there, the Explorer!

      She points to a black Explorer peeking through the trees. 
      Molly is positively beaming.

                                    SAM
                          (sultry)
                    Hello, Governor. 


      Catherine walking home alone, passing the Watering Hole.  She
      stops outside, thinking.  She sees Molly, Jake and others in
      a bar drinking.  Jake leans into Molly in a way that makes
      the attraction clear.  Catherine knows that look in Jake, and
      now she can't leave.  She makes for the door.
