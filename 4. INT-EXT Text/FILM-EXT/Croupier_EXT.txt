A MAN, face unseen, steps into a phone booth. CLOSE ON:
his hands.
It is impossible to tell where he is.
He opens his pocket book, addresses, diary etc., and
searches through for something.
He finds what he's looking for: a small photograph, among
others of girls, of a ten year-old boy in school uniform.
On the back are three phone numbers, two of them crossed
out. The MAN lifts the receiver, inserts coins. He starts
to press the numbers. There are CLOSE-UPS of his finger
pressing the sequence of digits, each one CLOSER, longer
than the one before, until...
The MAN is handsome, tanned, 50ish, white shirt, dark tie.
He is JACK'S father.
JACK SR.
How's it going?
The subsequent conversation is INTERCUT between SITTING
ROOM and PHONE BOOTH.
JACK
Great.
JACK SR.
Found a job?
JACK
No.
JACK SR.
Well I've got something for you.
In London, I mean. I've been
chatting to some friends. Do you
know the Golden Lion casino? It's
in Bayswater, I believe... They're
looking for a dealer, a croupier.
JACK SR pulls out a cigarette - a Gitanes.
JACK
That's not what I want to do, dad.
JACK stubs his cigarette out.
JACK SR.
(lighting his
cigarette)
Don't be stubborn. The pay won't
be grand, but it's regular. That's
what you need, isn't it? I know
you don't like taking my advice...
JACK
(drinks)
It's not that.
JACK SR.
I've set this up for you. Call the
Golden Lion and ask for Mr Reynolds,
he's the Manager. I don't know him
personally, but I've spoken to his
boss. Don't say no, Jacko. Give
yourself a break.
JACK reaches for a cigarette.
JACK
All right, I'll think about it.
I won't. Goodbye, dad.
JACK SR.
Just do it. You've got the knack,
you've got the personality, you
got that from me.
JACK lights up.
JACK SR.
You understand the punters. Think
about it, you can write during the
day and sleep knowing the bills
are paid.
As he speaks, he watches passing WOMEN.
JACK SR.
For Christ's sake, Jacko, don't
look a gift horse in the mouth.
Have you written that name down?
Reynolds, at the Golden Lion.
(exhales)
JACK
(exhales)
All right, dad. Yes, I'll call
him.
JACK is not enthusiastic, but he scribbles the name down
on a pad.
JACK
So how are you doing, dad?
JACK SR.
Great. I've just started a new
company. Solid financing. It's
good.
(pause)
I love you Jacko, you know that
JACK
Yes, I know that.
JACK SR.
Don't let yourself down.
JACK
I won't.
Goodbye, dad.
JACK hangs up.
The street lamps have come on. JACK is at the wheel of a
Sixties Austin-Healey.
JACK'S VOICE
The casino paid its staff monthly
in arrears. He would have to wait
six weeks for his first cheque. He
needed money now.
Under a canopy of coloured lights A CAR DEALER is walking
round jack's car, examining it.
DEALER
(fake American accent)
What kind of deal you looking to?
JACK
What's the Blue Book price?
DEALER
That's not relevant. An old car
like this, it depends on the
condition.
JACK'S VOICE
The car was a gift from Jack's
father. That's to say, Jack Senior
had given it to him before the
bailiffs arrived.
The DEALER picks at the cracked leather seats, the
protruding stuffing, the chipped dashboard, the rust.
DEALER
This ain't exactly what you'd call
mint.
He bends down and looks underneath the car.
JACK
How about fifteen hundred?
DEALER
How about five hundred.
JACK
What?!
DEALER
How about we split the diff...
Seven-fifty.
JACK
Is that your idea of arithmetic?
DEALER
I'm not a mathematician. I'm in
business.
JACK
Eight-fifty.
DEALER
Seven-fifty.
The DEALER looks at JACK. JACK stares back. It's as if one
is waiting for the other to blink first. Neither blinks.
JACK'S VOICE
He suddenly wanted to be rid of
it. 'Hang on tightly, let go
lightly'. It was a saying Jack
remembered.
JACK leans into the open car and takes out his hat and
cigarettes. He has accepted the offer. The music begins...
JACK crosses the road. He turns down a side street where
Victorian houses have been converted into flats. There are
scores of 'For Sale' and 'To Let' signs down the street.
JACK'S VOICE
He would tell them you have to
make a choice in life. Be a gambler
or a croupier. And then live with
your decision come what may.
He goes down into a basement, closing the iron gate behind
him.
MATT's car pulls up in the parking lot at the back of the
restaurant.
He and JACK get out of the car and go through
the open kitchen door.
JACK emerges from the Underground, one of the CROWD.
JACK goes into a large Department Store.
JACK pauses in front of an airline office. There is a large
picture of Cape Town, and a special ticket offer.
JANI comes out of the office. Her hair, tied back earlier
in the casino, is now glamorously fluffed out. She sees
JACK. He doesn't see her.
JANI
Thinking of going back?
JACK is startled. He doesn't recognise her for a moment.
Then...
JACK
Oh hello.
JANI
(smiling)
You know what? I'd like to buy you
a drink.
JACK
It's against the rules. Dealers
are forbidden to talk to punters.
JANI
That's stupid. What are the odds
of you being seen with me?
JACK
Impossible to calculate.
JACK'S VOICE
Jack knew that, in reality, all
odds are calculable.
JACK, comes out. BELLA hurries after him, following him
round the corner.
BELLA
(calling)
Jack. Do you need a ride?
JACK
No. Thanks.
BELLA
My car's in the garage.
JACK
Maybe another time.
BELLA
I'll take you up on that.
JACK
(pleasantly)
Goodnight.
He straightens his hat and walks off. BELLA walks the other
way.
A MAN lurks in the shadows ahead of JACK. JACK doesn't see
him. But as he comes past, the MAN steps out blocking JACK'S
way. He is the Arabic-looking MAN JACK earlier caught
cheating at the casino with JANI.
MAN
You don't recognise me? You had me
barred. You fucking little worm.
JACK
Wait a minute. You got yourself
barred.
MAN
It was you, you shit.
The MAN reaches forward and grabs JACK'S tie. He yanks it
with farce. JACK gasps. He rams his elbow into the MAN'S
chest.
The MAN kicks JACK on the shins. JACK topples. The MAN
leaps at him. JACK, knees him in the groin.
The fight is untidy and vicious. Both men collapse
struggling onto the pavement.
A car appears, a Mini-Cooper. BELLA is driving. She sees
the fight.
JACK'S nose is bleeding. The MAN kicks him in the back.
JACK yells with pain, gets to his feet.
JACK
Now I'm going to kill you.
He boots the MAN in the head. BELLA gets out of her car
and runs over to them.
BELLA
Jack!
The MAN is screening under JACK'S repeated blows. BELLA
pulls JACK away.
BELLA
Jack. Leave him! Come on!
JACK'S face is masked with blood and fury. BELLA is
frightened by JACK'S violence.
BELLA
Let's go. We don't want the cops
here.
Before she can get JACK into her car, he goes back to the
MAN groaning on the floor. He stamps on the MAN's hand.
BELLA is shocked.
JACK
(coldly)
He won't cheat again.
BELLA pulls him away, bundles JACK into her car, gets in,
drives away.
JACK SR. is in a public phone. Coloured lanterns hang round
in the night. Distant laughter.
JACK SR
How's it going, Jacko?
INTERCUT between JACK and JACK SR.
JACK
Fine. I took the job.
JACKSR
Good for you. I was wondering what
happened.
JACK
I tried to call you, dad, but they
said your line was disconnected.
JACK SR
(jovially)
Ah yes, I moved house. Needed a
bigger place. How's that book of
yours coming along?
In the sitting room MARION looks towards JACK in the
bedroom.
JACK
I'm getting there.
JACK SR
It's good to have the job to fall
back on, isn't it?
(pause)
There goes my other phone.
JACK
Goodbye dad.
He hangs up. MARION turns the last page of the typescript.
She's finished.
BELLA runs up the iron stairs to the gate at the top.
JACK
Bella!
Without looking back she flings the gate shut, goes off
down the street. JACK turns.
MARION
Go on. Go after her!
MARION slams the door to the flat. JACK is half-way up the
stairs, alone.
The rush hour. 6 in the evening. JACK watches MEN and WOMEN
coming out the store.
JACK'S VOICE
Jack had no idea where Marion was
staying, or with whom. He realised
he knew little about her life. But
then, he had never asked about it.
JACK now sees MARION. He is about to go up to her, moving
through the flow of the crowd, then he stops.
A MAN in his 30s, tall with a moustache, greets MARION.
He's been waiting for her. JACK watches the two of them,
unseen.
The MAN and MARION exchange a few words. She smiles, takes
his arm. He leans forward to kiss her.
JACK'S VOICE
For the first time in a long while
Jack thought about his mother.
She'd left when she couldn't take
it any more.
His father had said
'Don't worry, Jacko, she'll come
back.' She didn't.
JACK turns and walks away.
JACK'S VOICE
But Marion wasn't his mother...
JANI'S white Honda winds its way through the wintry
Oxfordshire countryside. The moon is bright.
JACK'S VOICE
Chapter Four...
The Honda's tyres crackle on the gravel drive which leads
to a floodlit yellow stone country house. There are three
cars parked outside the entrance. The Honda stops next to
them.
A floodlit tennis court. A racquet smacks a tennis ball.
JACK sits with GILES drinking Bloody Marys watching a game
of mixed doubles.
Everybody's wearing sweaters. JANI is playing with one of
GILES'S friends, GORDON. On the other side, two girls,
FIONA from Giles' office, and CHLOE, Gordon's girlfriend.
JACK follows JANI'S game. She is far and away the best of
the four.
GILES is also studying JANI's movements, her knickers when
she serves.
GILES
She's a dab hand With a racquet,
your friend.
JACK
South African women are very sporty.
JACK watches JANI'S strong leg muscles as she moves about
the court.
GILES
I can see. How did she get that
shiner?
JACK has been waiting for this.
JACK
I found her in bed with someone.
GILES
(surprised)
Who was he?
JACK
She.
GIEES
I say. You're a dark horse, Jack.
On court, Jani delivers a winning overhead smash. The four
PLAYERS shake hands across the net. They come off the court.
GORDON puts his arm around JANI. His girlfriend CHLOE
notices. JACK is irritated. GILES catches the moment.
GORDON
(to Jack)
You don't play tennis?
JACK
I don't play anything.
GORDON
How boring for you.
JANI moves deliberately away from GORDON, who clearly
fancies her, and sits down beside JACK. She pointedly kisses
him on the cheek. GILES glances at GORDON, who shrugs.
FIONA comes up to GILES.
FIONA
Where's our drinks?
CHLOE
They're so bloody selfish.
JANI
(to Jack)
I'm so glad you brought me.
JACK'S VOICE
Jack wouldn't have come without
her.
JACK walks down a street of rough, transient's hotels. The
street lamps are on.
JACK'S VOICE
Chapter Seven... Jack had decided
to see her. The challenge was
essential.
He comes up to a hotel called 'Journey's End'. He goes in.
JACK comes out of the hotel, walks up the street.
JACK'S VOICE
Question: Was he gambling, taking
Jani's money? Answer: No. Because
he wasn't betting with his own
money. He was being paid in advance
for a service...
In his croupier's suit JACK walks the night streets.
JACK'S VOICE
(quoting)
'The world breaks everyone, and
afterward many are strong at the
broken places. But those that will
not break, it kills. It kills the
very good and the very gentle and
the very brave impartially. If you
are none of these, you can be sure
it will kill you too but there
will be no special hurry'.
He passes a poster for the National Lottery bearing the
legend: 'IT COULD BE YOU'. JACK doesn't see it.
LUCY guides JACK to a parked car. He is drunker than she.
When he sees the car he starts to laugh. It is his Austin
Healey.
JACK
Nice car. How much did you pay for
it?
LUCY
Too much. Eighteen hundred.
She opens the door for him. They climb in. LUCY starts the
car.
LUCY
Where to?
JACK
Turn left at the lights.
They drive off.
A deserted intersection. The Austin Healey swings around a
corner.
A WOMAN steps out from the kerb.
JACK comes up to a bookstore window. A sticker reads: 'IT'S
A WINNER'. There are quotes blown up from the reviews: "AN
INCREDIBLE INSIDE JOB...IT'S ALL HERE, THE SYSTEMS, THE
SCAMS, THE SLEAZE...A TALE OF TRIUMPHANT DISGUST...OF
EXHILARATING CONTEMPT..." The display is just one book:
'I, CROUPIER'. Number 1 Bestseller.
JACK'S VOICE
Even his publisher had no idea who
the author was. He had done the
deal through a lawyer. It gave him
a good feeling, no one knowing...
