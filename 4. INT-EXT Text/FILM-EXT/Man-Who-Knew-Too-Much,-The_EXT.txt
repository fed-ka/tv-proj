The French driver and a couple of his companions, Arab.
The CAMERA MOVES BACK TO THE REAR OF THE BUS,
photographing the side windows. At the bottom of the
screen is the destination board. By the time we get
opposite the window out of which the McKennas are
looking, we have been able to read the words "CASABLANCA --
MARRAKESH."
The bus moves slowly through the streets busy with
bicycle riders, Arab women carrying things on their
heads, men on foot leading donkeys, an occasional camel,
carts, horse-drawn carriages carrying elegant Moslem
women, and ancient French automobiles.
The bus circles past the "Medina" of Marrakesh, the
market place with its crowds, vendors, shoppers,
beggars, and the curious. It swings in toward the bus
stop.
The bus pulls up to a stop, the door opens, and the
passengers begin to file out. The McKennas, together
with Louis Bernard, are the last off the bus. Arab
helpers have already climbed to the roof of the bus,
to unload the baggage. The clean-cut airline baggage
of the McKennas is in sharp contrast to the Hessianroped
bundles of the Arabs. There are nearby fiacres to
take the people to their various destinations in the
city, and some small, undersized taxi cabs.
Hank rubs his backside a little.
HANK
Next time take the train.
BEN
(To Louis)
Would you like to share our taxi to
the hotel?
LOUIS
That's kind of you, doctor, but
unfortunately I have some business
first.
Jo tries to be casual.
JO
What business are you in, Mr. Bernard?
But he has turned his head and speaks something in
Arabic to a porter, who begins to gather the McKenna's
bags, and one belonging to Louis. Louis turns to Ben.
LOUIS
However, I'll be there later - perhaps
we might have a drink together.

BEN
All right. But I'll serve the drinks
in our suite.
LOUIS
In that case, I will take you to dinner.
BEN
No.
Now that's not a fair bargain.
LOUIS
But I know Marrakesh. I can show you
an intriguing Arab restaurant where
the food is different, and the manner
of eating exotic.
BEN
(Gives in)
Well -- that's what we came here for.
Okay, Jo? Simple one of those Arabian
Nights?
Ben takes her arm, in a warm gesture.
JO
(Smiles agreeably)
Okay, But I'm no Scheherazade.
BEN
You'll do.
LOUIS
How would you prefer to travel to the
hotel? By taxi? Fiacre?
HANK
A wagon!
I want to ride in a wagon!
He points out one of the open horse-drawn
carriages.
Louis looks to Ben for confirmation. Ben
nods assent.
Louis turns to the porter, and orders him
in Arabia to
put the McKenna's baggage aboard the first
available
carriage. He picks up his own small bag.
LOUIS
Au revoir.
I look forward to cocktails.
He nods to Ben and Jo, and Pats Hank on the head.
JO
Goodbye.
BEN
See you later. And thinks again.
Louis smiles, turns and casually strolls off toward
the center of the market place. Hank watches him for
a moment, while Ben turns to see what is happening to
his bags.

Jo turns from the retreating Louis, and steers Hank
toward Ben, The CAMERA PANS them to the fiacre.
The McKennas follow their baggage aboard the carriage.
Ben settles the excited Hank into his seat.
HANK
How do you like this!
A horse-drawn
convertible!
Jo looks toward the market place, and something she
sees makes her eyes widen with surprise.
As seen from Jo's viewpoint, over the side of the
carriage. The Frenchman, Louis Bernard, is talking
wit the Arab in the brown robes and white and green
hat. The same Arab who was assaulting Hank verbally
on the bus. They are talking pleasantly, and smiling.
Jo turns to call Ben's attention to it, when there is
a sudden crack of a whip, a shouted command to the
horse, and the carriage starts of with an abrupt jerk.
It throws her head back. Hank screams with delight.
BEN
Hold on.
Hold on!
Here we go!
The carriage moves into the street with a rapid pace.
Jo looks again to find Louis Bernard.
Louis Bernard and the Arab have disappeared.

background. Hank is now standing up, holding on to
the side of the carriage and watching the sights.
J0
Ben -- I just saw Louis Bernard talking
to that Arab.
BEN
What Arab?
JO
The one who was shouting at Hank for
taking the woman's veil. He and the
Frenchman were talking like old friends.
BEN
All right. Let's assume they knew
each other, and Louis Bernard didn't
bother to tell us. What does that
mean?
JO
It means Mr. Bernard is a very
mysterious man.
BEN
He struck me as quite normaL
JO
What do you know about him?
BEN
I know his name...and, uh....
JO
You see? And he knows you' re an
American living in Indianapolis,
Indiana. A doctor at the Good

She looks at him briefly without any expression.
Then
she malts into a smile.
JO
Bitter medicine, doctor.
But I'll

The carriage swings into the driveway of the Hotel
Mamounia. It is a rich-looking building, elegantly
landscaped. The CAMERA PANS it to the entrance of the
hotel. Several hotel employees move quickly to meet
it. They help the McKennas descend, and assemble the
baggage.
Jo and Hank look at the hotel.
JO

A moderately well-dressed, middle-aged couple emerge
from the hotel. The man is dressed in a dark grey
flannel suit. The woman wears a light-weight, two-
piece sweater and skirt, She catches sight of Jo
McKenna. The man with her beckons to a porter. They
are Mr. and Mrs. DRAYTON.

Jo looks at the couple, then looks quickly away.
With a marked glance at Jo McKenna, the woman whispers
something to the man. He follows her glance.
Ben reaches for Hank, and the McKennas move into the
hotel. As they move past the CAMERA, Jo plucks at
Ben's arm.
JO
We're being watched.

Jo laughs appreciatively, and rumples his hair.
JO
Having a good time, Hank?
MRS. DRAYTON
He's delighted with everything.
At this moment, Mr. Drayton saunters up, and for the
first time the group is all together. Suddenly there
as some shouts in the distance. Everyone's attention
is drawn to the noise. Hank moves quickly, threading
his way through some people for a better look, the
CAMERA PANNING him away.
From Hank's viewpoint we see police chasing a white-
robed Arab figure. The police consist of a couple of
uniformed French officials and two or three others in
local Arab dress, with rifles slung over their backs.
Hank, fascinated at the drama, dishes away to got a

She starts forward after him, but Mrs. Drayton moves
faster than anyone. She passes both of the McKennas
and overtakes Hank.
Mrs. Drayton reaches down and takes hold of Hank's
shoulders, and pulls him toward her.
MRS. DRAYTON
Hank, it's best to keep away from
trouble.
Hank is looking away toward the chase.
HANK
What's going on?
Mrs. Drayton looks toward the trouble.
MRS. DRAYTON
It looks as though the police are
chasing somebody.
A closer view of the chase brings us back to where the
motor coaches are loading up, and for a moment the
police as lost to view.
A high view of the open air tannery with its circles
of crude stone water tanks becomes the scene of a
further part of the chase. We see the white-robed
Arab leaping between the crude tanks with the police
yelling and running after him in the distance. The
difficulty of the obstacles enables the Arab to get
ahead of them, and we see that he is now able to dodge
through an archway into the grain market.
As the chase passes through the grain market, it
scatters grain and grain sellers in every direction.

The pursued Arab dashes through an enclosure holding
the donkeys which are used to carry grain to and from
the market. There is quite a stampede, with the donkeys
running, kicking, and braying in fright.
Through another archway the Arab now dashes down some
of the narrow streets of the Medina. Sapling branches
are laced overhead creating a latticed shadow pattern
on the ground below.
As the Arab moves along the narrow street, with the
police in pursuit, progress is made difficult by the
many shoppers and bicycle riders. One bicycle rider
trying to avoid the oncoming Arab turns and drives
helplessly into a lags pottery store. The sound of
wreckage is enormous.
The Arab turns into another street where the rows of
brilliantly dyed wool yarn hang, from overhead strung
along sapling poles. There is in unfortunate collision
between the fleeing Arab end a workman crossing the
street with a large vat of blue dye on his shoulder.
In a moment the whole narrow streetway is saturated
with blue dye, and everyone is lifting his robe and
hopping around to avoid being stained. The Arab
continues on past. The police dash through the street
trying to avoid the dye themselves.
The Police reach a narrow intersection where the blind
beggars as squatting, begging alms. They pause. There
is no sign of their quarry. Then one of them points
to faint blue footprints dashing away to the left.
They take up the pursuit once again.
A high, overhead shot of the narrow streets showing
that the police have caught sight of their man again.
But there seems to be something strange about the chase
now. Two white-robed Arabs are running. The second
Arab we haven't seen before, but he is faster than the
first man and is gaining on him.

A closer, level shot, the CAMERA PANNING, shows, the
two breathless men closing in on each other. As they
reach an intersection in the streets, lighted by a
shaft of sunlight, the new Arab comes up behind the
original man being chased and whipping out a knife
from under his robes, plunges it into the back of the
first man. Then he turns and quickly moves away into
a street on his left. The first Arab jerks his head
up and backward with the sharp pain of the stabbing,
Then he staggers into the dark shadows.
A high shot shows that the stabbed man is almost out
of sight for a moment so that the police continue their
chase after the second man, who has swiftly darted
down another side turning.
The CAMERA MOVES IN behind the stabbed Arab. The knife
is still in his back. We get a glimpse of his hands,
vainly groping behind him. The CAMERA MOVES WITH HIM
as he staggers out into the open market place. His
shadow on the ground shows us the silhouette of the
knife handle sticking out from his back. The CAMERA
MOVES IN CLOSE to follow the agony of his head and
shoulders as he attempts to go forward.
The CAMERA seems to pass BEYOND HIM for a moment, and
there, a few yards away, stands Ben McKenna, and his
group.
The Arab hesitates for
a moment, but the attitude of
his head shows us that
he has seen McKenna. He makes
his way desperately and
painfully toward him. He is
finding it difficult to
remain upright and even take
those last few steps.
A closer view
of McKenna shows that those around him,
including his
wife and the Draytons, become frightened.
He spreads his
arms out to move them back protectively,
waiting to see
what is going to happen.

As the Arab reaches McKenna, the knife drops from his
back, and he collapses at Ben's feet. Ben endeavors
to grab him as he falls. He misses his shoulders, and
his hands close in and inadvertently grab the Arab's
cheeks.
A big close up of Ben's hands as his fingers slide off
the Arab's face. He turns his hands up and we see
they are covered with black grease paint.
The Arab's head his now dropped to the ground, and we
see streaks of white flesh showing through the dark
makeup which Ben's fingers had scraped off.
Ben drops to his knees to examine the man better.
The
Arab gasps out something in French.
LOUIS
Ils ont trouvs... ils ont russi

Ben looks at him puzzled.
LOUIS
(English)
McKenna... I'm... Louis.... Bernard.
Ben is quite surprised.
Ben glances swiftly at the fallen knife, and then
reaches across Louis Bernard to turn him over and
examine his wound. But the Frenchman reaches up with
one arm and grabs Ben by the coat.
LOUIS
McKenna -- listen to me -- first!
With what strength he has, Louis drags Ben down until
Ben's ear is near to his mouth. With a great effort
Louis whispers to him.

A big closeup of Ben's ear and Louis' mouth enables us
to hear the whispering, but Louis' voice is fading so
much that we cannot distinguish the words -- at least
enough to make any sense out of what he says.
LOUIS
A man...a statesman...is to be
killed...assassinated...in
London...soon...very soon...tell
them...in London...to try Ambrose
Chappell...
Presently, the mouth stops speaking.
It remains still
and open.
As Ben backs away, we see the staring eyes, and open
mouth of Louis. Ben quickly puts his hand inside the
robes to feel for Louis' heart, The hand slowly
withdraws. Ben rises.
The Arabs crowd in to see the details. Louis Bernard,
the McKennas and the Draytons are in the center of a
large flat cement section of the market place. The
Police by now have caught up to the event, and dash
quickly into the picture toward Ben and Louis.
Instinctively Ben backs away, as do the Draytons, and
Jo and Hank. However, Ben still stays closer than the
rest. One of the police picks up the knife and examines
it, another bends down to wipe the make-up off Louis
Bernard's face. Ben looks around for his wife.
Ben beckons to his wife beyond him, to join him. Jo
turns Hank over to Mrs. Drayton. Hank stands close to
the English woman as Jo comes over. As Jo comes up to
Ben, he is feeling in his pocket for something. Takes
out a pen.
JO
Ben -- who is he?
BEN

end
begins writing something down fast. Jo watches
him
with mystified curiosity.
Drayton strolls up, out of curiosity. He has also
seen Ben's hurried writing, but Ben casually puts the
notebook back into his inside pocket, along with the
pen. Before either man can comment on the writing,
the voice of a policeman is heard, speaking in French.

Ben is uncomfortable, and unhappy, but he tries to
hide it. He leans toward Jo as if he's about to tell
her something important. He reaches out, places his
hand over hers.
BEN
Jo...about Hank...
(He trails off)
JO
What about him?
BEN
Well...he...he's the kind of a kid who
can take of himself.
The Victoria turns into the Hotel Mamounia, and pulls
up in front of the entrance. The McKennas dismount.
Jo straightens out her dress, waits for Ben to accompany
her into the hotel. The head porter is outside
supervising some baggage with the lesser porters. He
touches his cap to the McKennas.
BEN
(To Jo)
You get the key.
I'll take care of
the driver.

Okay.
She turns and enters the hotel. Ben takes a bill out
of his pocket, examines it, and hands it to the driver.
The Victoria moves off. Ben turns to the Head Porter.
BEN
Uh...pardon me.
The head Porter turns to Ben respectfully.
HEAD PORTER
Yes, m'sieu?
BEN
Do you know Mrs. Drayton?
HEAD PORTER
The English lady?
BEN
(Nods)
Did you see her come back from the
market place anytime in the past hour
or so?
HEAD PORTER
(Thinks)
No, m'sieu.
BEN
Wait a minute. You don't understand...
she had a small boy with her. Mine.
HEAD PORTER
No, m'sieu.
BEN
How about Mister Drayton?
HEAD PORTER
Oui, m'sieu.
M'sieu Drayton check
out.
BEN
He what?
HEAD PORTER
Checked out.
Ben stares at him.
BEN
He couldn't have.

No, Mr. Drayton, the Englishman with

The Head Porter nods in agreement.
HEAD PORTER
Oui, m'sieu.
Checked out.
Ben turns slowly away from the porter, his face filled
with disturbance. He looks up toward the entrance as
he hears Jo's voice off.
JO
Ben, What's holding you up?
He quickly composes his face as best he can. The CAMERA
PANS HIM over to the entrance where Jo is waiting with
the key. He takes her arm and they enter the hotel.

DISSOLVE:
The first passengers emerge from the doorway of the
plane, followed by Ben and Jo. There is a group of
newspaper men and press photographers gathered around
the gangway. There is a stir in the group as the
McKennas appear. A couple of flash bulbs pop. An
airlines official hurries up the gangway to Ben.
OFFICIAL
Would you mind waiting for the press
photographers?
They nod agreement and the official joins the passengers
as they go down the steps.
Jo turns to Ben.
JO
How could they remember me so well,
Ben? It's been four years since I
played London.
BEN
I guess you're the kind of girl they
don't forget.
JO
But how did they know...who could have
told them...Ben, you didn't...?

She breaks off.
BEN
All I did was wire Val and Helen Parnell
to get us rooms --
He indicates fans and newspapermen.
BEN
But I didn't count on this --
Jo understands that his kind intention has slightly
miscarried. They look off as the yelling of the bobby
sox fans becomes louder.
Fans behind the airport fence, holding out autograph
books and shouting for her autograph. Others try to
break from the barrier, but are restrained by the
police. Standing in the front row of the fans is a
sober-faced woman who is not shouting or holding out a
book.
As the last of the passengers leaves the plane, Jo and
Ben take a position on the steps for the photographers.
Despite the long trip, her worry, her fatigue, Jo does
her best to act the part her public demands. She smiles
as well as she can, waves a little, turns her head to
the right and to the left to favor the photographers.
The sober-faced woman, standing among the fans. She
has a rather grey, pasty face, and stares off at Jo
through horn-rimmed glasses that are encrusted with
dust in the corners of the lenses. After a moment she
pushes her way back through the crowd of fans and moves
out of sight.
As the photographers continue their work Ben and Jo
come down the remaining steps and are joined by a man
wearing ordinary civilian clothes. He takes
a small
black identification folder out of his pocket and holds
it up for their inspection.

There is immediate alarm in Jo's face, but she then
controls it.
BEN
Yes?
What is it?
EDINGTON
As things are, there's no need for you
to go through the Customs. Will you
come this way!
His tone and manner
of asking them leaves little doubt
that his question is
an order. The McKennas glance at
each other briefly.
They realize that this is a further
development of their
involvement.
BEN
Whatever you say.
EDINGTON
(Smiles)
This Way, please.
He and the airlines official lead the McKennas toward
another entrance to the Airport Building. As she
follows, Jo seems tense and a little scared.
Another man is waiting for them at a door outside the
airport building.
EDINGTON
This is Mr. Woburn -- Doctor and Mrs.
McKenna.
WOBURN
How do you do?
BEN
Now what do you people want with us?
WOBURN
Mr. Buchanan would like to have a chat
with you, inside.
BEN

WOBURN
Special Branch, Scotland Yard.
He gestures them to enter the building. They do,
leaving Edington and tho Airline official outside.
Woburn leads Ben and Jo into an inner office.
It is a
good-sized room, plain, but comfortable.
WOBURN
This is Mr. Buchanan -- Doctor and
Mrs. McKenna.
BUCHANAN
How do you do?
Ben nods to him without speaking.
BUCHANAN
Thank you, Woburn.
Mr. Woburn quietly exits, closing the door behind him.
The McKennas stand a moment, wondering what do.
BUCHANAN
Do sit down, won't you?
Jo hesitates, then sits down.
Ben doesn't.
BEN
Why does Scotland Yard want to talk
with us?
Buchanan sits down behind the desk.
He's sophisticated
and intelligent.
BUCHANAN
Let me say at once, we're shocked...
that you son was taken from you in
Marrakesh and deeply sympathetic.
Jo leans forward quickly, eager, hopeful, unable to
restrain herself.
JO
Do you know where he is?
Ben is somewhat more reserved.
BEN
What about Hank?
What have you heard?

BUCHANAN
(O.S.)
I only wish I could give you some
cheerful news.
Jo settles back, unhappy, discouraged and a little
resentful of Buchanan. Ben seems irritated by the
disappointment.
In a quiet street off Camden Town we see Ben, alight
and pay off a London taxi. The taxi does a U-turn and
disappears around a corner. Ben starts to walk TOWARD
THE CAMERA. He glances at the piece of paper from,
his pocket bearing Ambrose Chappell's address. He is
completely alone in a deserted street -- so much so
that his footsteps click on the pavement and create
the feeling of an echo. As he walks he listens to the
echo ind for a moment wonders if it is an echo. He
slows up and comes to a stop close to the CAMERA.
There is complete silence -- only the faint distant
London traffic noises.

He resumes his walk, the CAMERA DOLLYING HIM. The
echo starts again. He slows up again and stops -- but
this time the echo continues. He becomes tense, looks
around in alarm.
The CAMERA PANS the streets from Ben's viewpoint.
There is no sign of anyone.
Ben resumes his walk, the CAMERA DOLLYING
him. He
stops suddenly, as though to trap the echo
-- but the
echo comes on after him. Slightly scared,
he now
resumes his walk with a more hurried pace.
The echo
gets louder. He glances quickly over his
shoulder
again.
A man is following him, at about the same pace.
He is
rather well dressed, and appears nonchalant.
Ben continues walking, and after a bit cautiously
glances behind him.
The same man is following behind.
Ben glances down at the paper in his hand, and looks
up trying to locate the right house number as he walks.
The street has a mixture of houses, yards, an odd dirty-
looking store or two. Ben's expression indicates that
he would like to make his destination before the man
following catches up with him. Then he changes his
mind. He deliberately slows up.
Showing Ben as he walks slowly along, listening to the
man approaching behind him, listening with the back of
his head, and with his whole body. The man walking
behind is aware of Ben. He begins staring at him.

Ben instinctively clenches his right hand into a fist
of preparedness. As the man closes in Ben we see that
he is rather elderly, sixty years old, perhaps. As
the man reaches Ben, and passes him, Ben's follows him
and study him.
Ben watches the
man go on ahead of him at a faster
pace. Suddenly
the man turns a sharp right into
doorway, and is
gone. Ben glances at the paper in his
hand. He stops
and looks up in astonishment.
The little side doorway in which the elderly man turned.
Above it is an old painted sign reading "AMBROSE
CHAPPELL - TAXIDERMIST."
Ben hesitates briefly in thought, puts the piece of
paper into his pocket, then makes up his mind and goes
through the doorway.
Ben, rather cautiously, makes his
way
across a small
and somewhat dreary-looking yard,
and
comes to face a
low building at the end of which
is a
kind of small
factory. The door of the factory
is
just closing as
he makes his way across.
Ben pauses at the door to the factory, and looks down
at the pushbutton bell. There is a window next to the
door. Ben bends and peers through the window.
Staring through the other side of the window is the
snarling, realistic head of a tiger.
Startled, Ben recoils instinctively. Then he turns
back to the door, takes a deep breath, braces himself,
and presses the doorbell. The door is soon opened by
a young workman in shirtsleeves and apron.

The shadows of the day are lengthening as Ben gets out
of a taxi and approaches Jo standing on the sidewalk.
His fatigue of before seems to have vanished in his
eagerness to meet Jo and find out what she knows.
Ben comes up to her.
She grips his hands.
JO
There it is.
BEN
You may have just hit it right on the
nose. You can't be farther wrong than
I was with my Ambrose Chapel. Let's
go.
JO
Ben, should we get some help from the
police?
BEN
No, honey, please, no -- let's take a
crack at this alone.
The Chapel as seen from their viewpoint. People are
now entering it, but it seem as if the tag end of the
congregation is entering, because the service is
obviously under way, the sound of hymn singing coming
across faintly to us.
Ben takes her hand, squeezes it affectionately.
Together they cross the street, the CAMERA PANNING
them up the steps of the chapel and to the entrance.
SHOT
They enter the Chapel from the rear, looking around
cautiously. A hymn is in progress. The Chapel holds
about three hundred people. It is of the non-conformist
type and the congregation consists mostly of middle-
aged and elderly women. Although the McKennas are not
aware of it, we notice that the organist is none other
than Edna, the woman who observed Jo at the airport,
and later took care of Hank.

Carefully the McKennas find their way to a back row
seat. One or two of the women in the back row turn to
look at the new arrivals. Jo wants to whisper something
to Ben, but with a gesture he silences her. Ben picks
up hymnal, hands her one, finds the right page and
begins to sing along with the hymn. But instead of
following the words of the hymn, Ben makes up his own
words to communicate with Jo, as he looks around at
the chapel.
BEN
(singing)
This looks like mother wild goose chase.
JO
(Singing them)
Let's wait and look around...
Some of the parishioners turn and listen to Jo's voice
because it has a professional quality that rises above
the rest. Whether they are watching her in suspicion,
or admiration, is hard to tell. Jo turns her attention
to the hymn book, trying to be unnoticed. Ben's eyes
catch something coming down the aisle.
BEN
(Singing)
Look who's coming down the aisle.
Jo follows his glance, leaning forward a little and to
one side.
The
back door of the chapel opens and Drayton, Hank
and
Mrs. Drayton emerge. Drayton locks chapel door
and
crosses to a waiting car. They all get in and the
car
moves off.
Jo hurries up the street towards Ambrose Chapel.
Jo turns the corner heading for the chapel.
She looks.

Jo hurries across the street, and up the steps to the
Chapel. She tries the door.
The door locked. She tries it again. It does not
give. She bangs her on the door. No one answers.
Jo's face is puzzled and a frightened.
The CAMERA PANS Jo to the right side of the Chapel.
She looks down the length of it. No sign of anyone.
The CAMERA PANS Jo to the right side of the Chapel.
There is no sign of life down the whole side of it.
Jo returns to the front door, examines it, tries it
again. Now there is definite panic in her face. There
Is the sudden sound of a car pulling up quickly to the
curb. She turns.
A police car has pulled up to the curb.
There are
four men in it.
The CAMERA PANS Jo from the front of the Chapel down
to the police car. Three men are getting out, leaving
the driver inside.
Jo comes up to the three men.
One of them, in charge,
does the talking.
JO

Patterson
glances at it.
PATTERSON
Our orders are to keep it under
observation until a Scotland Yard car
arrives.
JO
My husband's in there. There must
have been thirty or forty people...
and now...
Patterson looks at her carefully.
PATTERSON
When was this?
JO
It couldn't...it couldn't have been
more than five minutes ago!
PATTERSON
(Interrupting)
Let's take a look.
JO
I told Mr. Woburn he had to hurry.
The CAMERA PANS the two of them up to the Chapel. The
other police have gone down the sides for an inspection.
Patterson and Jo go to the main door. Patterson tries
it.
JO
I tried that. It's looked, Let's force
it open.
PATTERSON
I'm sorry, madam, we can't break in.
(Sympathetic)
Requires a search warrant. It's the

They start around the corner to inspect the sides of
the Chapel.
Patterson and Jo peer in the windows.
They apparently
see nothing.
Another policeman is checking the windows on the other
side. Nothing.
The third policeman is checking the alleyway in back
of the Chapel. He sees no sign of anything suspicious.
Patterson and Jo come around the back and try the back
door.
The back door is firmly locked.
MATTHEWS
There's no one there, sir.
PATTERSON
Are you quite certain the place was
full of people -- only a few minutes
ago?
JO
Of course I'm certain. I was there

He sent me out to call Scotland Yard.
He looks at her quizzically.
J0
It's much too complicated to explain.

He hangs up, and gets out of the open car.
He turns

Orders, madam. Can we give you lift

Jo is frustrated, and irritated, but she thinks for a
moment and makes a sudden decision.
JO
Yes, I want to go to Albert Hall.
Patterson looks at her with tolerant surprise.

Afraid the Albert Hall's a bit off our
beat. Suppose we drop you at the
nearest taxi rank?
Jo looks back at the Chapel briefly.

They get into the car, and the CAMERA PANS it, as it
drives away down the long Victoria London street, which
now remains deserted.
The exterior rear of a huge residential building such
as is to be found in Kensington Palace Gardens or
Belgrave Square. The CAMERA PANS DOWN and we see a
Humber car driving through the gates at the rear. It
pulls up at the Service entrance. A man sitting beside
the chauffeur gets out of the car. Inside the car are
the Draytons and Hark McKenna. We see the man hurry
to the door of the kitchen and enter.
He leans out the door and beckons the Draytons and
Hank to come in quickly. The three get out of the car
and hurry toward the door.
The street before the chapel is still deserted, and
the light of day is beginning to fade. Suddenly the
silence is broken by the sound of the bell ringing
spasmodically in the chapel belfry. Along the street
a few people begin putting their heads out of windows,
and the one policeman left in charge is seen hurrying
away down the street.
From his viewpoint. He can see people gathering in
the street, looking up at the chapel.
Ben moves cautiously out onto the roof of the chapel.
Beyond and below him we can see people on the street.
He manages to lay low and crawl over the roof, the
CAMERA PANNING him. We can now see beyond and below
the patrolman returning with two regular uniformed
policemen. They are crossing toward the chapel looking
up, as we:
LAP DISSOLVE TO:
Shooting through the Albert Memorial as a foreground
piece we see the activities of the arrivals at a big
concert. Through the archway large limousines are
pulling up, while on the sidewalk level with the main
road odd taxis are pulling in. We see the usual line
of posters which run along the edge of the sidewalk.
The screen is filled with a large poster. It announces
for that evening the commemorative concert. Further
details on the poster indicate that a Cantata will be
sung featuring the London Symphony Orchestra, The Royal
Choral Society, and a name woman as featured mezzo
soprano, and Conductor Bernard Herrmann. Between the
CAMERA and the Poster a taxi pulls up. It is near
enough to the CAMERA so that just the driver and the
door fills the screen, Jo McKenna steps out the far
side and pays off the driver with a Ten Shilling Note.
She hurries away. The driver endeavors to call after
her as he turns the note around in his hand. He looks
at it with satisfaction, and stuffs it into the inner
recesses of his clothes.

Jo finds herself going up the few steps the front door
surrounded by a mixture of tattily-dressed, tiaraed
English duchesses, and the more elegantly dressed
members of the Corps Diplomatique men in white tie,
tails and orders, and their more fashionably dressed
South American beauties.
A taxi pulls up in the front of the large, old-fashioned
