      BURST through the top soil, into the fresh air, RAIN pours 
      down. It s full moon, and the heavy grey clouds make the 
      light a strange almost other worldly colour. Lightening 
      strikes. We re in a GRAVEYARD. Other graves have been 
      disturbed. Newly awakened DEAD PEOPLE are climbing out of 
      their graves including in the grave next to Kieren s AMY 
      DYER. This is the beginning of The Rising. Kieren ROARS. 

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:



      The front door slams and KIEREN (wearing the hoodie) steps 
      into frame. He s out. Incognito. But out all the same. He 
      squints at the daylight and looks down the street. No one in 
      sight. It s now or never. As he walks past Number 11 we see 
      Ken through the curtains, still staring blankly, SHIRLEY sits 
      next to him looking on with sympathy.

                                                                            CUT TO:IN THE FLESH by Dominic Mitchell EP 2  FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 27.11.12 14.





      KIEREN is walking down the street at pace, head down, staring 
      at his moving feet. Once he gets to the woods he ll be safe. 
      Or safer. But right now if one of The Lea s residents gets a 
      good look at him he s done for. But he needs to see it. Has
      to see it. Whatever itis he s risking his safety for. 

      SLAM OF A DOOR. VOICES IN THE DISTANCE. Kieren looks up. 
      Stops dead. From across the street coming out of a semi 
      detached house on the corner, a MIDDLE AGED COUPLE have 
      exited they are DUNCAN and PATTY LANCASTER, (Lisa Lancaster s 
      parents). Kieren s expression: Absolute dread. He knows them. 
      Kieren spins around so his back is to them. A tense moment. 
      Kieren peeks a look over his shoulder. They ve not noticed 
      him and are reversing out of the driveway. He waits until he 
      hears the car driving off.  

                                                                            CUT TO:



      We see KIEREN exiting the woods and coming upon a small 
      Gothic cemetery next to a WAR TORN parish church. The whole 
      area has been cordoned off with MAKESHIFT BARRICADES and 
      WEATHERED BLUE AND WHITE POLICE TAPE. Kieren reads a rusted 
      official sign that has been fastened to the chained locked 
      iron gate:   DANGEROUS. QUARANTINED AREA. DO NOT ENTER.  

      Kieren stands there for a minute afraid to trespass. Then it 
      hits him: it s people like him that the sign s warning about. 

                                                                            CUT TO:



      The overgrown graveyard has been left to nature. No living 
      human has set foot here for years.  Kieren notices that some 
      of the graves have been disturbed, soil unearthed: people who 
      came back in The Rising. Kieren approaches one of them. 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)IN THE FLESH by Dominic Mitchell EP 2  FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 27.11.12 15.

      He stops by a black granite stone, stares at the engraving. 
      His former resting place. Written in gold script is:

       KIEREN WALKER
      1991 - 2009
      Gone is the face we loved so dear
      Silent the voice we loved to hear 

      He gets down on his knees. Looks down. There in the earth is 
      his rotting COFFIN. Kieren puts his hand to his head: 
       Christ, what a mind fuck . 

      SOUND OF SOMEONE CLIMBING THE IRON GATE. Kieren snaps out of 
      his reflections. Someone is in the graveyard with him. What 
      to do? Kieren takes cover behind his own gravestone. Tries to 
      make himself small. He hears a FEMALE VOICE. 

                                    FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                    Hi, nan. Cold today isn t it? 

      Kieren hears: plastic bag rustling...blanketbeing laid 
      down... a few moments of silence... then the female voice 
      begins to speak again: Softly, gently. 

                                    FEMALE VOICE (O.C.) (CONT D)
                          (barley audible)
                    It s been a lonely week this week, 
                    Nan. More than it usually is. 

      Kieren frowns. Who is she talking to? He ventures a look:

      Laying on a blanket talking to a gravestone is a YOUNG 
      FEMALE. Her face unseen. She stops talking. Cocks her head. 

      Kieren snaps his head back. Shit. He hears someone getting 
      up. Footsteps on grass. Closer and closer. Moment of silence. 

                                    FEMALE VOICE (O.C.) (CONT D)
                          (close and from above)
                      I know you. 

      Kieren looks up. It can t be. It just can t be. ANGLE ON: The 
      Young Female. We recognize her as Kieren s zombie hunting 
      partner, AMY DYER (18). 

                                                                            CUT TO:



      KIEREN RUSHES through the overgrown graveyard running away 
      from Amy. He chances a glance over his shoulder: there she 
      is, jogging after him. The stress makes him remember: 




                                                                              (CONTINUED)IN THE FLESH by Dominic Mitchell EP 2  FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 27.11.12 16.

      MEMORIES FROM THE SUPERMARKET AND RABID AMY CHASING LISA 
      LANCASTER. THESE FLASHBACKS ARE QUICK, FLASHING BEFORE 
      KIEREN S EYES AS HE RUNS THROUGH THE GRAVEYARD. 

      FLASH. Kieren s back in the present, running as fast as he 
      can. He checks behind him: no one there. What the- SMACK! 
      Kieren s run into a tree. He goes down, dazed for a moment. 

      He sees a pair of red converse and looks up. There she is: 
      Amy, Cheshire grin on her face. Kieren scrambles up and 
      searches for a weapon. He sees a RUSTY IRON BAR and picks it 
      up. He brandishes it in front of him. Amy laughs. 

                                    KIEREN
                    Stay back. 

      Amy pulls a  OooI m so scared face  and steps forward him. 

                                    KIEREN (CONT D)
                      I mean it!

      Amy continues to advance on him. Forcing Kieren backwards. 

                                  AMY
                    Go on then. Stick me. 

      Kieren doesn t. Instead he keeps retreating. He looks behind 
      him: two more feet and he s going to fall into AN OPEN GRAVE.

                                    KIEREN
                    Swear to god I will!

                                  AMY
                      (SINGING IAN DURY) 
                     Hit me with your rhythm stick. Hit 
                    me, hit me. 

      Kieren stops. He s at the edge of the open grave. He s boxed 
      in. Nowhere to go. Amy doesn t stop advancing on him. 

                                    KIEREN
                    I m serious! Stop!

      Amy stops. Kieren breathes a sigh of relief. Amy then gives a 
      WAR CRY ROAR and RUNS at him. Oh Jesus! Kieren s got no 
      choice. He holds the iron bar in front of him as protection. 
      Amy runs straight towards it, fearless. Her eyes go wide. As 
      do Kieren s. The iron bar has punctured her stomach. 

      Kieren s in shock as Amy staggers backwards, clutching her 
      abdomen, then collapses. Kieren stands there, frozen. He 
      drops the iron bar and goes to her - she s stiff, not 
      breathing, no pulse:  Christ, I ve killed her!  A moment. 
      Then Amy omits a LOW MOAN. Kieren s eyes fill with fear as 
      Amy, now old school zombiefied, RISES UP. Back from the dead!

      Kieren s face is a picture of utter horror. It cracks Amy up, 
      breaking her BAFTAaward winning zombie performance.

                    Your face. 

      She cackles. While Amy revels in her practical joke, Kieren 
      is still trying to process what s just happened.

      VILLAGERS sit on fold-out chairs among the SIMPLE WHITE 
      CROSSES (think graveyards for fallen soldiers). A particular 
      line of crosses have BLUE ARMBANDS attached to them and GREEN 
      POPPY WREATHS resting at their base. Ex HVFfighters (JEM, 
      GARY, DEAN) are sat in the front row in full uniform. VICAR 
      ODDIE is standing addressing the crowd.

      All eyes on Jem. She s shocked to be singled out. She stands, 
      looks at Sue -  What the hell s going on, mum? .

                    For acts of great heroism in the 
                    face of extreme danger, I (and the 
                      government) present you with the 
                    Medal of Courageous Service. 

      Oddie produces a beautiful medal and pins it on Jem s chest. 
      She s stunned. She certainly wasn t expecting to be honoured. 
      The crowd applaud. Oddie motions for her to give a speech. 
      Jem awkwardly tries: 

                                  JEM
                    I, I wasn t expecting this. I 
                      don t...

      Jem turns and looks at the line of white crosses with green 
      poppies resting on them.  

                                  JEM (CONT D)
                      I wasn t the bravest. Not by a long 
                    shot. 

      Jem takes the medal from her chest. 

                                  JEM (CONT D)
                    If anyone deserves this, it s Lisa 
                      Lancaster. She was the real hero. 
                    Not me. 

      Jem goes to DUNCAN and PATTY LANCASTER. She gives the medal 
      to Patty, who becomes emotional. She and Duncan embrace Jem.  
      The crowd are very touched by this seemingly humble gesture 
      on Jem s part and they give a standing ovation. 

      While the crowd are on their feet, BILL and JANET enter 
      Heroes  Resting Place (the graveyard). Oddie notices them.  

                                    VICAR ODDIE 
                      Perfect timing. Here he is; 
                      Commander of Britain s first HVF
                      platoon. Won t you say a few words 
                    Bill?  

      ON: Bill. He nods:  Alright . The crowd pat Bill on the back 
      as he takes the podium and readies itself for a passionate 
      speech about the HVF srelevance. Bill scans the crowd. 

                                    BILL
                      Rick s coming home. 

      The villagers do a collective double take. What did he say? 

                                    BILL (CONT D)
                    We expect your full support.

      And with that, Bill walks past the open mouthed villagers. 

      Oddie gets it together enough to call after his shepherd.

      Bill takes Janet s hand and exits. 

      Oddie looks back at the crowd: Who explode into CHATTER. 
      DUNCAN and PATTY LANCASTER share a hopeful glance.

                     Do not go gentle into that good

                                    KIEREN
                      Thanks for frightening me to death 
                    but I have to get back. Have a 
                    nice, uh...(doesn t know what to 
                      say)...second life.  

      Kieren turns and starts walking away from Amy.

                                  AMY
                    No totally understand, you ve got a 
                    lot of being alone to do, looking 
                    at old photographs, reliving the 
                    past in minute detail. 

      Kieren stops. Turns back to her. 

                                    KIEREN
                    How did you know I was doing that? 

                                  AMY
                    I m psychic. 

                                    KIEREN
                          (very serious)
                    Is that another power we possess?

      Kieren s seriousness cracks Amy up again.  

                                  AMY
                    I m not really psychic, dum dum. 
                    Just that s what I did when I first 
                    got back. Looking at old photo 
                      albums, wanting to live in the 
                    past, getting depressed  cos I knew 
                    deep down I couldn t. It s what 
                      you ve been doing since you got 
                    back from the treatment centre, 
                    isn t it?

      Kieren, eyes down, nods.  

                                    KIEREN
                          (still with head down)
                    How did you...stopdoing that? 

      Amy stands. 

                                  AMY
                      I went on day trips. 

      Kieren looks up at her -  Day trips? 

                                                                            CUT TO:



      A FEW VILLAGERS including DUNCAN and PATTY LANCASTER have 
      gathered outside the Macyhouse to  welcome  Rick home. 

      SUE and JEM both look apprehensive. Rick coming home is not 
      good for the Walker family. We stay on them for a moment then 
      drift to GARY and DEAN. Both with cans of lager. 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)IN THE FLESH by Dominic Mitchell EP 2  FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 27.11.12 22.

                      Tenner says Bill llput a bullet in 
                    his nogminute he steps out truck.  

      Gary looks at Dean, a tiny bit nervous.  Who knows what will 
      happen next. 

                                                                            CUT TO:



      KIEREN and AMY are at the bus-stop. KIEREN has his hoodie
      right over his face.

                                    KIEREN
                    You swear where we re going is 
                    safe?

                                  AMY
                    Cross my heart and hope to die. 

      An Army Truck barrels past them as they wait. Unbeknownst to 
      KIEREN and AMY RICK MACY is inside.



      The ARMOURED TRUCK has indeed parked up next to the Macy
      House. VILLAGERS crane their necks to get a better view. 

                                                                            CUT TO:



      BILL and JANET exit. Bill s back snaps straight. Janet s 
      mouth snaps into a smile. They present a picture of 
      solidarity and confidence. Deep down they re anything but. 
      The DRIVER gets out the cab and goes around to the back of 
      the truck. He nods at Bill and Janet. They brace 
        themselves... Villagers crane their necks to get a better 
        view...thedriver OPENS the back of the truck and pulls out 
      an extendable metal ramp. The sun is shining so bright, the 
      inside is a black hole. 

      Then the noise of metal on metal. The crowd gasp as they 
      see... RICK MACY (20), dressed in full Military Uniform, 
          walking/shuffling (due to his brace) down the metal ramp. 

      First thing to say about Rick is he s STRIKINGLY HANDSOME. 
      The second thing to mention is he s SHOCKINGLY BANGED UP. He 
      has a LONG GASH on his face that goes from his mouth to his 
      forehead and is held together by METAL STAPLES. Most of his 
      LEFT LEG is metal. He looks like he s been put back together 
      by a very competent DRFRANKENSTEIN. 

      IT IS OBVIOUS TO ANYONE THAT RICK IS INDEED A PARTIALLY 
      DECEASED SUFFERER. 

      JEM puts her hands on her head. Mind blown. The Crowd don t 
      know what to do. Should they clap? Should they boo? It all 
      depends on how Bill and Janet react... Bill is pale faced. 
      Fixed on the spot, as his partially deceased son shuffles 
      towards him. Rick stops just in front of his parents. 

      A pause. Bill s expression is unnerving. What will he do? 
      Like this until.. Bill sticks out his hand. Rick takes it. 
      The tension in the air pops and the crowd applaud. Bill 
      gestures to Oddie to do the same.  Oddie steps up to Rick. 

                                    VICAR ODDIE
                      Welcome home, son. 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)IN THE FLESH by Dominic Mitchell EP 2  FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 27.11.12 24.

      Oddie shakes Rick s hand. Philip and most of the villagers  
      eyes grow in wonder - Wow, Vicar Oddie shaking the hand of a 
        PDSsufferer. That s on a par with Ian Paisley shaking hands 
      with Martin McGuinnessback in the 1980 s.  

      Rick looks out into the exuberant crowd, does a little wave, 
      scans the familiar faces, searching for someone. Someone he 
      used to know.  Kieren Walker. Where is he? 

                                                                            CUT TO:



      Kieren s flabbergasted he s out in public. Amy grabs his hand 
      and takes him into the run down amusement park. It s off 
      season but there s still SOME PEOPLE floating about, going on 
      the rides, playing knock the coconut, eating candy floss. 

                                    KIEREN
                      Jesus, when you said a day trip I 
                      thought we were going somewhere 
                      secluded, not grand central 
                      station.

                    You call this grand central

                    So? We ve got our contacts in and 
                    cover up on. You wear too much of 
                    that stuff by the way. 

      Amy goes to touch his face. Kieren flinches. 

                                    KIEREN
                    You don t wear enough.

      Kieren is about to tell her but Amy spots a ride and like a 
      excited toddler she get s distracted by it. She bounces up to 
      the ride: THE GHOST TRAIN.

      KIEREN and AMY ride the tea-cups. AMY is enjoying herself.

                      Death. The Big Sleep. Deep down 
                      fearing the reaper is the reason 
                    why everyone s so messed up in the 
                    head. They know the end is nigh, 
                    but there s nothing they can do 
                    about it so it drives them nuts and 
                    they live their lives with one eye 
                    on the clock. We don t have to do 
                    that. We can smash the clock to 
                      pieces. That s an incredible 
                      blessing.

      Kieren considers this. KIEREN thinks he snatches a glance of 
      LISA LANCASTER in the crowd.... It can t be. He collects 
      himself.  

                                  AMY (CONT D)

                                    BILL
                    Oh aye. She s a good lass. Great 
                      fighter. Considering family she s 
                    from. 

                                    RICK
                      They re alright are they?

                                    BILL
                    Who? 

                                    RICK
                      Walkers. 

                                    BILL
                    Yeah. They re alright. 

      Bill aims the rifle. It jams. Bill smacks it.

                                    BILL (CONT D)
                    Piece of crap, always doin this. 

      Bill manages to fix the rifle. Fires at the target.

                    They did go through that bad patch 
                      before The Rising. 

      Rick turns his head. Bad patch? 

                                    BILL
                      Selfish of him.

                                    JANET
                    There were something wrong in his 
                    head, Bill. 

                                    BILL

                      yerare. Yercarry on. Yerdon t 
                    take the cowards way out.  

      Bill offers the target up to Rick. Rick aims his rifle.

      The tension in Rick s head eases for a moment. 

                                    BILL (CONT D)
                    He killed himself. 

      The sky lands on Rick. You can see it happen. Subtly. Just a 
      twitch of absolute agony on the mask that is his face. 

                                    BILL (CONT D)
                    Weak ending for a weakling.

                      Shouldn t speak ill of the dead -

      Bill and Janet are cut off by furious gun fire: BANG BANG
        BANGBANGBANG. Rick has unloaded into the target. An 
      unspoken expression of his emotional turmoil.   

                                                                            CUT TO:

      KIEREN, hoodieup, watches AMY on a daredevil ride. He can t 
      help but smile at her joie de vivre. Deep down her lust for 
      life is something he wishes he had. He would like to be a 
      daredevil himself. Slowly he reaches up and puts the hoodie
      down.  

                                    YOUNG MAN (O.C.)
                      Kieren?  

      Kieren freezes. Doesn t turn around. 

                                    YOUNG MAN (O.C.) (CONT D)
                      Kieren? Kieren Walker? 

      Kieren slowly turns around to see the Young Man with his 
      Girlfriend beside him.  

                                    YOUNG MAN (CONT D)
                    How are you.... (alive)? I went 
                    to... (your funeral)? You re a 
                      rotter. HE S A ROTTER!

      PEOPLE turn and look at Kieren. Their eyes filled with fear. 
      Kieren doesn t know what to do. His breathing quickens.  



                                                                              (CONTINUED)IN THE FLESH by Dominic Mitchell EP 2  FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 27.11.12 35.

      All the crowd are staring daggers at him.  He s a rotter, 
      he s a rotter! . He sees, oh God he sees LISA LANCASTER
      amongst them.   He stumbles back from the apparition, bumps 
      into a BUNCH OF TEENAGE GIRLS who let out HIGH PITCHED 
      SCREAMS. The screaming is infectious and the crowd PANIC. 
      Kieren makes a fast exit.  

                                                                            CUT TO:



      KIEREN is running towards home as if his life depends on it. 

                                                                            CUT TO:



      KIEREN reaches the woods on the outskirts of Roarton. He s in 
      bad shape. The unexpected encounter with his old school mate 
      and  outing  has combined to make Kieren extremely stressed. 
      The forest isn t helping matters. He decided to go the 
        untroddenroute to avoid people and right now the trees, 
      branches and brambles are all fighting against him. 

      A low moan in the wind. Kieren stops. Listens. Just the wind 
      in the trees. Then another moan. This one more audible. Who 
      the hell said it?

      SOUND OF A BIRDS TAKING FLIGHT. 

      Kieren turns to where what has disturbed them: A FIGURE 
      standing in the distance. It s not an untreated zombie that 
      the spraying missed. It s something much worse then that... 
      It s LISA LANCASTER. She s standing next to a great oak. 
      Staring right at Kieren. She s wearing her dirty HVFoutfit. 
      Blood all over her. Dead eyes. Exactly how Kieren left her. 

      She stares at him with her dead eyes. Kieren stares back, 
      completely stunned.  

      After a moment Lisa Lancaster turns and walks away. 

      Kieren has to follow her. He does. 

                                                                            CUT TO:



      KIEREN is trying to keep up. He comes out into a clearing and 
      sees: Lisa entering a cave entrance. 




                                                                              (CONTINUED)IN THE FLESH by Dominic Mitchell EP 2  FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 27.11.12 36.


        CONTINUED:46A46A

      Kieren stops. Looks to where Lisa has lead him. A cave. By 
      his expression we can tell it s not just a random cave. This 
      cave means a lot to him. So much so in fact that he cannot 
      enter.  

      Kieren gives the cave one last pensive look, then turns and 
      leaves. 

                                                                            CUT TO:



      Kieren exits the woods, takes a breather at the Bus Stop. As 
      he catches his breath he looks up at the village NOTICE 
      BOARD: the place during The Rising for relatives to put up 
      missing persons posters.

      Most of the posters (think 9/11 missing person posters) are 
      still up but with RED CROSSES or BLACK TICKS on them. Only 
      ONE poster has no markings, in fact this poster looks newer 
      then the others. The unmarked poster is of LISA LANCASTER. 

      Kieren stares at LISA S MISSING POSTER. It depicts a smiling 
      Lisa in casual clothing, her arms around a happy pet dog. 
      It s a strikingly human image. Written below the photo is:

       MISSING. LISA LANCASTER. Our daughter went missing on a 
      supply mission on March 23rd during The Rising. Praying for 
      the best. Any information please call us  

      Kieren s horrified. For multiple reasons: 1. Lisa Lancaster s 
      body went missing after he and Amy killed her. That s news. 
      And 2. Her parents, Mr. & Mrs. Lancaster, don t know for sure 
      that she died. Kieren knows. He was the one that killed her.   
      Kieren reaches out and plucks the poster off the board.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      KIEREN comes around the back of the house to the garden.

      He s sweaty and out of breath. He s run all the way home. He 
      opens the back door and enters the house. 

                                                                            CUT TO:



      An upset JEM is walking up the road on her walkietalkie. 
      She s upset about seeing Amy, it s brought up a lot of

                    Bill? It s Jem. You there? Over.

      Jem waits for a reply. No reply. She spots DEAN S TRUCK and 
      waves him down. She comes up to the passenger window. Dean 
      sits there. A FLASK and a HANDHELD GAMES CONSOLE (old crappy 
      one) on the seat next to him. Rifle jammed in between the 
      seats. He s off to patrol the woods.

      Dean nods. Jem opens the door, puts the flask and console on

                      Because I wasn t like them.

                                  AMY
                    This Rick. You want to see him 
                    don t you?

      Kieren nods.

                                  AMY (CONT D)
                    So let s go.

                                    KIEREN
                      I can t go in . I m barred for 
                    life.

                                  AMY
                    Well now you re dead - ban s void. 

      And with that Amy strides into the pub. Kieren hangs back. 
      Torn. But he can t let her go in there alone. So after a 
      moment he enters the pub after her. 

                                                                            CUT TO:



      PHILIP guides KIEREN and AMY towards the chair designated for 
      Rick and hastily pulls over another seat. 

                                  AMY
                            (sarcastic)
                    Wow, it s the VIP lounge. 

                                    PHILIP
                    (as he places the second chair)
                    Enjoy your night. 

      Philip gives Amy a sly once over, is about to leave when...

      Rick exits the mens s toilets wiping his mouth. He sees 
      Kieren. Freezes. Turns to ice. He does. If you were to go up 
      to him now and push him he d topple over and smash into a 
      million little pieces. Kieren goes up to the edge of the PDS
      sufferer area. Rick snaps back into reality. Notices out of 
      the corner of his eye Philip looking at him. 

                                    RICK
                      Alright, mate?  

      Rick sticks out his hand. It trembles ever so slightly. 
      Kieren looks at Rick. At his outstretched hand. He s stunned 
      by Rick s response. He was expecting... what? Fireworks? A 
      passionate embrace? Maybe not, not here, but certainly he 
      wasn't expecting an  alright mate  and a bloody handshake. He 
      takes Ricks hand none the less. 

                                    KIEREN
                    It s good to see you, Rick. 

                                    RICK
                    Yeah. Good to see you too, Ren. 

      Rick s eyes dart over to Philip. He takes his hand back. 

                                    RICK (CONT D)
                          (beat)
                    I m sitting out there. 

                                    KIEREN
                      Right. Well I can t go out there.

                                    RICK
                    Why not?

      Kieren looks at Rick. Really? You really don t know why? 

                                    KIEREN
                      Rules. 

                                    RICK

                                    KIEREN
                      Philip. 

      Rick turns to Philip. 

                                    RICK
                      Lippy, what yerdoin puttin Ren

                    He s a what?

      PHILIP backs off. Rick lifts rope for Kieren. Kieren looks at 
      Amy. 

                                    KIEREN
                      And...myfriend?

                                    RICK
                    Sure. If she must. 

      Kieren and Amy exit out the PDSsufferers  area. 

                                                                            CUT TO:



      A bright full moon illuminates DEAN trekking through the 
      woods on patrol. Dean has his rifle slung over his shoulder 
      and is in the middle of playing a zombie shoot emup game on 
      his HANDHELD GAME CONSOLE. 

                                    DEAN
                    Have that yerrotters. 

      Dean s just got a new high score. A SMALL FIGURE passes 
      behind him. TWIGS break under its feet. Dean stops. The game 
      is urging him to play on. He turns around: Complete darkness. 
      Just black shapes and... Something there. A faint outline. 
      It s watching him. 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)IN THE FLESH by Dominic Mitchell EP 2  FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 27.11.12 59.


        CONTINUED:6565

      Dean slowly raises his games console like a torch. The 
      trembling blue LCD light hits branches, leaves and... A TREE. 
      Dean relaxes -  Just a stupid tree, yersoft get.  Then a 
      noise. What sounds like a MOAN. From just over the 
        embankment. Dean spins around. More audible MOANING.  Dean 
      swings his rifle round. He slowly moves up the wooded 
        embankment. As he climbs the embankment the sounds become 
      louder. Dean gets to the top of the embankment. Peeks over 
      it. 

      ANGLE ON: Dean s face. Frozen in surprise. He s looking at 
        a...RABIDMALE ZOMBIE. In a clearing. With a dead sheep. The 
      Rabid Male Zombie cocks it s head and looks at Dean and 
      ROARS. Dean freaks out. 

      He STUMBLES backwards, loses his footing and TUMBLES down the 
        embankment. Losing his rifle in the process, he finally thuds 
      to a halt at the bottom. Dazed. He shakes his head, trying to 
      clear the stars. Then he hears a PANTING SOUND. With a 
      trembling hand he takes out his GAMES CONSOLE and shines the 
      LCD up at: THE RABID MALE ZOMBIE. Right next to him. So close 
      that Dean can smell the Rabid s rotten breath. 

      The Rabid Male Zombie SNARLS. Dean SCREAMS. 

                                                                            CUT TO:



      A PICK-UP TRUCK barrels down the road past us. 

      BILL driving, Gary and Dean also in the cabin. KIEREN and 
      RICK are in the back of the truck.

      BILL, GARY and DEAN exit the pick-up cabin and start 
      gathering weapons and various other hunting gear: torches, 
      rope, netting... KIEREN goes to exit. Rick stops him. 

                                    RICK
                    Just a sec. 

      BILL, GARY, DEAN are suited and booted, ready to hunt. Bill 
      indicates to Rick to hurry up.

                                    RICK (CONT D)
                    Just gotta load up! You go ahead

      KIEREN and RICK are walking through the woods. He notices 
      Rick struggling with his leg. 

                                    KIEREN
                    Does it hurt? 

      Rick looks at him. Shakes his head. 

                                    KIEREN (CONT D)
                    Did it hurt?

                    Fer a second it did. 

      Kieren takes this in. 

                                    KIEREN
                    I m sorry. 

      Rick looks at him. Kieren is the only person who s expressed 
      any sympathy for his war wounds. 

                                    RICK
                    Tafer saying that.

      BILL, GARY, DEAN are stalking through the undergrowth 
      searching for the rotters.

                    Think we re lost. 

      No reply. Rick looks behind him. Kieren s nowhere to be seen. 

                                    RICK (CONT D)
                    Ren?

      KIEREN is standing at a distance, looking over in wonder at: 
      an untreated RABID MALE ZOMBIE (the same one that chased 
      Dean). The Rabid Male Zombie is outside the entrance to THE 
      CAVE we saw before. The Rabid Male Zombie is in the middle of 
      hollowing out a DEAD SHEEP s head. He isn t tearing the sheep 
      apart and eating the grey matter like an animal, he is 
      CAREFULLY putting the pieces of brain on a stone next to him. 
      As if preparing the table for supper. Kieren can t take his 
      eyes off his untreated counterpart. RICK appears. 

                                    RICK
                    Hey, it s the old den - 

      Kieren turns to Rick and shushes him. He points to where the 
      Zombie is. Rick sees him and scrambles for the walkietalkie.  

                                    KIEREN
                    Wait. 

      Kieren indicates to the cave. The Zombie s finished preparing 
      the brains. It lets out a gentle moan. An untreated LITTLE 
      GIRL ZOMBIE exits the cave. She s about eight. Pale as the 
      moon. Hair matted. Eyes pin pricks. The Sunday school white 
      dress she was once buried in now in tatters. She shuffles to 
      the Male Zombie who offers her a piece of grey matter. She 
      takes it and then plops down next to him. The Rabid Male 
      Zombie makes sure she s eating, then he begins to feed.  

      Kieren watches, marvelling at this primitive domesticity. 
      Rick watches, then presses the button on the WalkieTalkie.

      The crackle of the walkietalkie startles the Rabid Male 
      Zombie and Rabid Little Girl Zombie.  They look up.  See

      The two zombies are making their way through the clearing.
