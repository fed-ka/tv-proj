    LEILA and CINDY peer out at a car full of CARPOOLERS (GRACEN, 
    LAIRD, AUBREY and DOUGIE). The men sit comically motionless. 

                                CINDY
                  What are they doing out there?

                                LEILA
                  Oh, you know them. Probably talking 
                  about work...


    The car pulls up. Inside are AUBREY (sweet to a fault) and 
    DOUGIE (young and eager at times seeming  a bit much. )          CARPOOLERS    Pilot Episode   "The Toaster"  3/1/07   3.



                                DOUGIE 
                  Hey, check this on out. I ve been 
                  reading up on what makes a great 
                  handshake.

                                AUBREY
                  Have you? Sure, I ll give it a whirl.

                                DOUGIE
                      (slowly shakes his hand)
                  Is that fantastic or what?...I plan 
                  to make five million dollars with 
                  that thing. Do you know what a 
                  handshake is?

                                AUBREY 
                  I believe I do. Yes.

                                DOUGIE
                  A business man s kiss.

                                AUBREY 
                  Ewww...

    Grossed out Aubrey looks at his hand like he just had sex with 
    it. Laird (the  playboy dentist ) literally hops the fence.

                                LAIRD
                  Hey, Aubrey how was your night?

                                AUBREY
                  Busy. Keeping things together at 
                  home. Apparently a couple of my kids 
                  are vegetarians now...you?

                                LAIRD 
                  Killer. You ever met a woman so hot, 
                  you could have sex with her phone 
                  number?

                                AUBREY
                  I can honestly say that I haven t.

    Dougie extends his hand to Laird. He just glares at it.

                                LAIRD
                  No thanks. I ll pass.

                                DOUGIE
                  I ve perfected my handshake. I was 
                  working on it all night.          CARPOOLERS    Pilot Episode   "The Toaster"  3/1/07   4.



                                LAIRD
                  Really? So that s what you do when 
                  your wife goes to sleep?

                                DOUGIE 
                  Hey, just tryin  to  care and share.   
                  Hopin  to get to know you.  

                                LAIRD
                  You want to get to know me? Come 
                  watch me get a lap dance...C mon, 
                  this is your third day in the car. 
                  Yesterday it was  seven words that 
                  will change your life ! 

                                DOUGIE 
                  Frankly, I think you re afraid of my 
                  handshake. Because it says a lot 
                  about me. It says that I m the new 
                  generation, that I m bursting forth 
                  with new ideas. The future couldn t 
                  happen fast enough for me. And that s 
                  the kind of game I m going to bring 
                  to this carpool.

                  Don t fight!

    Gracen emerges, not happy to be throwing away his old toaster.

                                LAIRD 
                  What are you doing with that?

                                GRACEN
                  Throwing it out. It still works but 
                  apparently it s the  old  toaster.

    Pulling in, they see an empty spot at the same time as a high-
    end BMW does (this is the  cool  carpool - their rivals). 
    Laird jumps out and blocks them as Aubrey nabs the spot.

    SUPER:  CARPOOL RULE - NUMBER 15 

    Cars drive down a bustling freeway. Papers fly through the air 
    and adhere to a car s windshield causing a near-accident.  

    Up ahead, we see the source of the trouble: a whirlwind of 
    documents coming from inside the Carpoolers  car.  

    Inside: All stare at Dougie. He has opened his briefcase while 
    the windows were down. FREEZE. SUPER:  NO WORKING IN THE CAR.

    Leila carries an open-house sign across her lawnless house 
    flip.  She s in her element as she conducts the workers.

                  I need a lawn. Where exactly is my

                  Well then...let s get you painting.

    She leads them to the front door, but before they can enter:

                      (pointing to boots)
                  Mind taking those off?

                  Yes. What s the point of fixing up a 
                  house if you re going to get it all 
                  muddy again?

    The guys comply as other bootless workers emerge from inside.

                  Where exactly do you think you re

                  You ll get them Saturday, after the 
                  open house.

    She tosses them in the trunk.  SLAM.  Then, her phone rings.

    Behind her, Leila sees the bootless workers making a run for 
    it.

    Dougie and Aubrey stand with Laird. He looks at something.

                                AUBREY/DOUGIE 
                  What a figure./What I could do to 
                  that!

    Gracen snatches it back. We realize it s  the number.

                  Yes, it s more! My wife makes more 
                  money than I do! 

    Gracen looks over to see the  cool  carpoolers have overheard. 
    They eat sushi and snicker.

    Gracen slams the trunk shut feebly.  

                                GRACEN 
                  Would you open the trunk? I forgot to 
                  take off my jacket.

    Aubrey opens it. Gracen can t help himself, he slams it again.            CARPOOLERS    Pilot Episode   "The Toaster"  3/1/07   15.




    The car pulls up and the Carpoolers stare in horror at the 
    party going on inside.

                                GRACEN
                  What are they doing in there?


    The guys get out of the car. Gracen notices:  

                                GRACEN
                  I didn t know she was having a party?

                  I can t.  Cause at work today, I went 
                  into my boss s office to ask how much 
                  I make, he thought I was asking for a 
                  raise and he gave me one. So, I m 
                  going home to demand my wife raise my 
                  allowance.

    Gracen turn to Laird:  Well?

                  careful you re gonna be living alone 
                  with your best friend s toaster!  

    He grabs Gracen s old toaster from the trunk and storms off.  


    Through the window we see Gracen with the purse. From ANOTHER 
    ANGLE: we realize Laird is watching from behind his fence.

    Gracen stands at the toilet. He is torn as he contemplates        
    leaving THE TOILET SEAT UP. He turns. There stands Leila.

    Laird waits as Aubrey arrives with his garbage. Dougie 
      approaches, offers his hand. Laird just stares at it.

                  break into my best friend s house.

                  Sorry, it s not part of my  five year 
                  plan  to do hard time for armed 
                  robbery!

                                AUBREY 
                  I m not armed! Are you guys armed?

                  Dougie, when I met you there was 
                  something I hated about you, but 
                  there was also something I liked 
                  about you. Meaning you re just smart 
                  enough and dumb enough to fit into 
                  this carpool. What are the  seven 
                  words that can change your life? 

                                DOUGIE/AUBREY

                  Well? Do you mean what you say?

                                DOUGIE
                  I said Gracen should get rid of his 
                  toaster. Not us.

                                LAIRD
                  But, sometimes friends need their 
                  friends. We help each other out. It s 
                  what carpoolers do. 

                                AUBREY
                      (suddenly sure)
                  I m in!

                                DOUGIE
                  I m in.  

    Dougie extends his hand. Laird finally shakes it. 

                                LAIRD
                  One more thing...

                                DOUGIE
                  What?

    Laird slaps him.

                                LAIRD
                  We re even.

    Dougie smiles. Then together, they move toward the window.


    Aubrey and Dougie watch Gracen kiss Leila good-bye. Marmaduke 
    rushes out. He gives Gracen a sheet of paper.          CARPOOLERS    Pilot Episode   "The Toaster"  3/1/07   31.

                  I wanted to make up for the credit 
                  card thing. I think this will more 
                  than do it. It s a list of my 
                  favorite music.

                                GRACEN
                      (off list)
                  Who s  Freedom Jail ?

                                MARMADUKE
                  Oh, that s my band. We haven t 
                  rehearsed yet, or learned our 
                  instruments.

                                GRACEN
                  Great. Keep me posted.

    Gracen turns to see Laird sheepishly carrying back the  old 
    toaster . Gracen s happy to take it, until:

                                GRACEN (CONT'D)
                  It smells like perfume.

                  The woman from the bank. I had to 
                  thank her for giving me that 
                  information.
                      (off Gracen s look)
                  Yeah, like you ve never used a hot 
                  toaster as foreplay.  

    Just then a WOMAN S HEAD pops up from the other side of the  
    fence. She jumps over and starts walking towards them.

                  Guys, mind if we give my  friend  a 
                  ride home on the way to work?
