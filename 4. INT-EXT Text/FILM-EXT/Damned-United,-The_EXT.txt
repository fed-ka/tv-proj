Morning lads! Lovely Yorkshire

I tell you makes me want to jump on a

CLOUGH laughs. The PLAYERS stare in silence. Squinting in the
drizzle. Condensation coming from their mouths.
JOHNNY GILES stares. BILLY BREMNER spits and continues
talking disrespectfully.
CLOUGH (cont'd)
Not much of a welcome, was it? And not
so much as a smile from Johnny Giles.
JIMMY
You're five days late!! And did you
really need to say that about Majorca?
(beat, changing the
subject)
You know he was Revie's first choice
for getting your job.
CLOUGH
Who? Johnny Giles?
CLOUGH looks over at GILES, who turns away, resumes
training....
CLOUGH (cont'd)
Was he now? And Bremner?
JIMMY
Club Captain. Don's son and heir. His
first born. You're never going to get

BREMNER, a flint-eyed Scot, stares at CLOUGH..

You know he'll be making a file on us.

CLOUGH
Don Revie. Prepares a file on every
game. Leaves nothing to chance. Knows
every opponents formations.
Strategies. Everything.
TAYLOR
I've heard he's a superstitious twat.
(calling out)
Ey..! Help him, someone HELP him..!
CLOUGH
We grew up just a few streets apart,
you know. In Middlesborough, close to
Ayrsome Park. He'll have known my

CLOUGH rushes out of the doors, straightening his cuffs,
straightening his hair, buttoning his jacket. First out to
greet the arriving team.
He turns the corner to see the LEEDS COACH a hundred yards
down the street, the PLAYERS getting off the coach and
walking towards him..
CLOUGH
What are they doing?
JIMMY
They've run out of petrol.
TAYLOR
No, it's that superstition, isn't it?
Every away cup ties, Revie makes them
walk the last hundred yards.
TAYLOR mutters under his breath, "Soppy twat".
CLOUGH cranes his neck. Watches DON REVIE, 40's. Thick-set.
Severe, forbidding, intimidating, in a huddle with his
coaching staff, Les Cocker and Syd Owen. His henchmen. His
assassins. His "Goodfellas". His right and left hand.
CLOUGH walks towards him. Hand outstretched..
CLOUGH
Welcome to Derby, Don. Pleasure to
meet you. I'm Brian Clough.
But REVIE walks past without shaking hands, without talking,
without even breaking stride..
..and disappears into the stadium, deep in conversation with
Les Cocker and Syd Owen.
CLOUGH stares. Hand still outstretched. He looks over at
PETER TAYLOR, who can't help smiling, `Forget it'.
TAYLOR and JIMMY GORDON walk off, but CLOUGH still stares at
REVIE in disbelief.

JIMMY GORDON and PETER TAYLOR up on thier feet in protest..
TAYLOR
Referee..!
CLOUGH looks over to REVIE's bench. Sees REVIE and SYD OWEN
quietly applauding the Leeds PLAYER. Encouraging more of the
same. As the Derby PLAYER is stretchered off..
Presently, RRROOOOAAAARRRRR goes up. Goal Leeds. REVIE and
his henchmen get to their feet. Applauding. 1-0.
TAYLOR and JIMMY GORDON immediately start shouting out
encouragement to the Derby PLAYERS, new instructions, as the
game restarts..
TAYLOR (cont'd)
C'mon, keep your shape! Close him
down!
JIMMY
Think, Alan! To feet!
TAYLOR
Now sent it out wide!
CLOUGH doesn't join in. He continues to stare at REVIE in his
dugout.
Suddenly:
"Beeep!", whistle! Penatly Leeds! CLOUGH leaps off the bench
in outrage. Screaming, on his feel, protesting in disbelief..
CLOUGH
What? He didn't fucking touch him!
Ref! He DIVED! He fucking dived!
REVIE shaking hands with his COLLEAGUES. Smiling amongst
themselves. Congratulating themselves. Celebrating.
The inevitable roar as Leeds convert, followed by,
"Beeeeeep", the sound of the final WHISTLE. CLOUGH stares in
disbelief. Robbed. Deflated.
The REFEREE blows the whistle for the end of the game.
CLOUGH watches as REVIE and SYD OWEN brush past, shaking
PETER TAYLOR and JIMMY GORDON's hands, (assuming TAYLOR's the
manager), on their way to the dressing-rooms, their minds
already on their next game...

You lot may all be internationals and
have won all the domestic honours
there are to win under Don Revie, but
as far as I'm concerned, the first
thing you can do for me is to chuck
all your medals and all your caps and
all your pots and all your pans into
the biggest fucking dustbin you can
find because you've never won any of
them fairly. You've done it all by
bloody cheating.
Silence from the PLAYERS..
CLOUGH (cont'd)
Mr. William Bremner. You're the
captain. And a good one. But you're no
good to the team and you're no good to
me if you're suspended. I need you fit
for every game, and I want good,
clean, attractive football from my
captain. Setting an example.
CLOUGH turns to PETER LORIMER.
CLOUGH (cont'd)
Mr. Lorimer, I hope you were listening
because you're as good a footballer as
I've ever seen, but you know how I
feel about the way Don let you
harangue referees, fall over when
you've not been touched, protesting
and pointing, trying to get other
players booked. We'll have no more of
that.
CLOUGH turns to JOHNNY GILES..
CLOUGH (cont'd)
And you, Irishman. God gave you skill,
intelligence, and the best passing
ability in the game. What God did not
give you was six studs to wrap around
another player's knee.

Things are going to be a little
different around here. Without Don.
Might feel a little strange at first.
Might pinch a little. Like a new pair
of shoes. But if you want your
grandchildren to remember you for
being something other than the dirty
buggers you all were, if you want to
be loved as REAL champions, WORTHY
champions, you're going to have to
work. And improve. And change.
(nods to JIMMY GORDON)
Now let's start off by playing some
seven-a-sides.
PLAYERS stare at one another. Bristling. Disbelieving looks.
BREMNER
Don never did that.
CLOUGH
Well, I'm not Don. And from now on I
never want to hear that man's name
again. Ever. Next player who mentions
it, or what he did or didn't bloody do
in the good ol' days, will spend a
week cleaning my boots.
(clapping hands)
Seven-a-side. Keep it nice and clean,
and sensible. No fifty-fifty's.
CLOUGH sees that one side is a man short..
CLOUGH (cont'd)
Right, I'll play myself. You might
learn something, Irishman. Two hundred
and fifty-one goals in two hundred and
seventy-four starts.
CLOUGH skillfully traps the ball between his feet, flips it
up onto this head - down onto his chest, then "WHAM" volleys
it into a distant goal..
CLOUGH (cont'd)
Like to see Don fucking Revie do that,
eh?
CLOUGH removes his track suit trousers, rolls his neck. JIMMY

Think and give. On the deck. Nice and
crisp. Yes, to me, Sniffer. To me.
CLARKE passes the ball. But it's a fifty-fifty. Another
player bears down on CLOUGH..who refuses to pull out..
"CRUNCH", a bone-shaking tackle from "BITES YER LEGS".
CLOUGH (cont'd)
Oh, Jeeeeeesussss!!!
CLOUGH is flattened. Rolls around on the floor. JIMMY GORDON
runs up to NORMAN HUNTER..
JIMMY
Fucking matter with you? He said no
fifty-fifty's.
HUNTER aggressively steps forward. Nose to nose. He is
immediately flanked by other aggressive Leeds PLAYERS.
Crowding the referee. Intimidating him.

JIMMY GORDON backs off, visibly frightened. CLOUGH lies on

In the middle of the park. Somewhere

and tell the kids what to do.

We'll play him as a sweeper, then.

Then perhaps we should just shake on

Don't mention that name to me.
DAVID FROST
It's really like the other House of
Commons. You hate to mention him. Why?
CLOUGH
I hate to mention him why? Because
he's a very talented man and I don't
like him.
The audience laughs.
CLOUGH (cont'd)
He's a very, very talented man and his
record is unsurpassable. But I just
happen not to like him. And I don't
like the way he goes about football
either. Football is a game of opinion
and there are perhaps people in your
profession who don't like the way you
do your bit.

from your point of view...
CLOUGH
Beating Leeds United, obviously.
Always a particular pleasure that.
COLEMAN
Brian, you've also done it on
comparatively small gates, which I
know has niggled you a little bit
during the season.
CLOUGH
Niggled me, David, it's absolutely
made me blazing. To be honest, I know
what I want to achieve, I know what
the people of Derby want us to
achieve, but when you've got a
chairman not wanting to put his hand
in his pocket...
MICHAEL PARKINSON, the highest rating talk show on TV..
CLOUGH (cont'd)
You ever see eighty five or perhaps
ninety percent of chairmen talking -
I'd love a few chairmen on your
programme occasionally - I believe the
very sight of them brings the game
into disrepute (some clap in the
audience). And every time they open
their mouths it kills it. Because the
very thing they've given me a lot of
stick about over the years - about
talking too much and going on
television too much, there are the
very people who can put two words
together and its rather embarrassing
to me that a man - or men - can stop
me talking to people like you. I love
football. It's deep, it goes right
down through. It's in every nerve,
vein, you name it. It consumes me. And
when I have to come and talk about I
like the passions of football to come
out. Because there are not enough in
the game.
