The riding outfit is adorned by LEOPOLD, Duke of Albany, a
dashing, virile man in his 30's. GALLOPING with great abandon,
he expertly leads his horse up hills and over hedges. He
sends gardeners shaping the grounds fleeing from his path.
In the background, lanterns are being strung throughout the
estate. Rugs are beaten out of open windows.
Leopold makes his way through the manicured garden in the
dark. He hears an EERIE METALLIC SOUND. He slows down, brushes
back the thicket. The silhouette of a woman is revealed. She
is once again writing in her notebook.
LEOPOLD
Miss Carlson?
Carlson spins around quickly, panicked. Leopold STOPS.
Partially hidden in the brush, a sleek, oddly shaped,
MECHANICAL device. It's door open, lit from within, casting
a weird glow.
LEOPOLD
Good God...
CARLSON
What are you...? You frightened me.
Leopold moves toward the contraption and is about to touch
it...
LEOPOLD
What sort of mechanism is this?
Carlson shakes her head, unsure of how to proceed.
LEOPOLD
Answer me!
CARLSON
It's perfectly all right. It's...
Leopold carefully examines the apparatus, stepping inside.
Carlson FREEZES.
CARLSON
(carefully,
deliberately)
Listen to me. Please. Move very
slowly. Step out of the machine.
Step out and I'll explain whatever
you want to know.
LEOPOLD
What is this? Who are you?
His hand comes to rest on a glowing red lever.
CARLSON
Oh, God.
She YANKS on his arm. Instinctively he pulls away,
accidentally thrusting the lever into action. Carlson falls
from the machine.
CARLSON
(suddenly frantic)
Get out of there! Get out now!
The machine LIGHTS UP.
LEOPOLD
Miss Carlson... I...
CARLSON
No!!!
The compartment door snaps shut.
CARLSON
Shit!!
There is a BRIGHT WHITE FLASH. Blackness fills the screen.
CUT TO:
Blinding sunlight. Skyscrapers. Automobiles. Traffic lights.
Road construction. Modern day pedestrians. Helicopters. Car
alarms. Leopold stands frozen, overwhelmed, taking it all
in.
LEOPOLD
19...?
The doctors reach him. He collapses to the ground.
CUT TO:
Leopold awakens alone in his room. He sits up with a jolt.
His stomach sinks as he realizes THIS IS NO DREAM. He slowly
rises to his full stature, moving to the window he looks out
on the modern day city, shaking his head in awe. He makes
his way to the bedroom door and tentatively touches the knob.
There is a KNOCK on the door.
Leopold JUMPS back and runs to the bed: The picture of
dignity.
KATE
How are you feeling?
(no response)
I thought you might like some tea.
LEOPOLD
I insist on being returned home
immediately.
KATE
I understand. We're doing our best.
LEOPOLD
I wish to speak with your employer,
Dr. Coles.
KATE
You're speaking to him.
LEOPOLD
You are not suggesting that you are
Dr. Coles?
She smiles.
LEOPOLD
Miss... uh?
KATE
Dr. Coles. If you like, you could
call me Miss Dr. Coles or if that's
too much, how about just plain Kate?
LEOPOLD
(coldly)
A WOMAN of science?
KATE
Hard to believe?
LEOPOLD
But a woman's brain cannot obtain
enough knowledge to posses a truly
scientific mind.
KATE
(jotting this down)
Interesting. Nevertheless, we've
come a long way baby.
LEOPOLD
(confused)
Are you attempting to be humorous?
KATE
I'm attempting to be informative
it's just coming out humorous.
Leopold regards her dubiously.
KATE
(clinically)
Look, modern social science clearly
states that a woman's place in society
marks the level of that civilization.
A science career for a woman is now
almost as acceptable as being a...
a... waitress. Cream and sugar?
LEOPOLD
Young lady, I... Surely it is not
expected that I remain here with you
indefinitely... Unchaperoned?
KATE
(pen poised)
Does that make you nervous?
LEOPOLD
Certainly not!
KATE
(writing)
Then what are you getting so red
about? It's a very large apartment...
with locks on all the doors.
LEOPOLD
The idea! My dear Miss Coles...
KATE
Dr. Coles.
LEOPOLD
Honey...
KATE
(she puts the pad
down)
Let's get one thing straight right
now. My name is Kate or Katherine or
if you insist Dr. Coles.
(she rises)
Take a good long look, Leopold. I am
a 20th century American woman with a
Doctorate and a commission and
independence. I am not your "young
lady" or your "pretty Miss" or your
"honey." Is that clear?
Leopold watches her with great interest. Finally:
LEOPOLD
Honey... For the tea.
KATE
...I'll get it for you.
Kate grabs the teacup grandly and leaves the room.
Kate and Leopold gaze out of their windows. The camera slowly
pulls back until they are swallowed up by the city.
Peaceful. The sun sets. Pigeons rest on window sills.
Suddenly:
CHARLIE (V.O.)
OH MY GOD!!!
The pigeons take flight.
Leopold leaves Central Park profoundly lost. Looking both
ways in the wrong direction, he crosses the street. SCREECHING
brakes, HONKING horns, FURIOUS shouts with Leopold, horrified,
caught in the middle. He makes it across shaking and dazed.
A motorist pulls along side of him.
WOMAN MOTORIST
You stupid fucking son of a bitch.
Next time I'll hit ya. Fucking moron.
Leopold GAPES, appalled. A Hansom carriage slowly treads
into Central Park. Leopold watches until it disappears.
Huge buildings. Neon lights flashing. Garbage in bundles.
Calvin Klein Ads. In the center of it all, Leopold, jostled
BADLY by the crowd, tipping his hat to all the ladies. He
enters a deli.
Leopold is thrown out of the store and on to the street.
LEOPOLD
Did you see what he did? Did you see
that?
No one responds. Leopold is left sprawled on the street.
Thunder is heard.
Gargoyles at New York City Library, The Dakota, the Bowery,
Alphabet City.
Pouring rain. Leopold stands in front of the stables beaten
and drenched. A car drives by, screeches to a stop, and
hastily backs up along side Leopold.
KATE
Leopold! Leopold, get in.
Leopold stares at the car. Kate runs out, opens the door and
helps him in. She dashes back into the drivers seat.
the Brooklyn Bridge, the Chrysler Building, Rockefeller
Center, 5th Avenue.
Kate and Leopold exit The Gap. Leopold awkwardly wears hip
Gap casual clothes, a baseball cap on his head.
LEOPOLD
Are you certain this is correct?
Kate places the cap backwards on his head. She nods
approvingly.
KATE
Certainly I'm certain.
Leopold watches himself in store windows. He CAN'T comprehend
it. Kate leads him into Barney's.
Lincoln Center, Columbus Circle, Gristedes.
Kate and Leopold walk down the street, a bag in each arm.
Leopold eyes Kate suspiciously.
LEOPOLD
Dr. Coles, why is it you are not
married?
KATE
Women are longer defined by the men
they're married to, Leopold. I have
a career. I haven't found a man who
fits in with that yet.
LEOPOLD
Yet people still marry?
KATE
(defensively)
I've heard of cases.
They continue to walk, Leopold noticeably studies Kate.
Finally:
LEOPOLD
I suspect there is something wrong
with you.
KATE
There's nothing wrong with me!
LEOPOLD
Perhaps it is the way you present
yourself.
KATE
I don't know what you're talking
about.
LEOPOLD
There is some sort of problem when a
woman reaches thirty and insists on
remaining single.
KATE
You think I'm THIRTY?!
LEOPOLD
What?
KATE
Do I look THIRTY to you?
LEOPOLD
It was an arbitrary number.
KATE
You chose it specifically opposed to
a lower number.
LEOPOLD
I didn't mean it.
KATE
...Thirty!
LEOPOLD
I apologize... How old are you?
KATE
(sharply)
I'm thirty! But you're the first
person whoever told me I looked it!
LEOPOLD
I'm sorry.
Leopold spots a formal dress in a store window. He takes a
good long look at Kate, smiles, then quickly walks inside.
Kate continues down the block.
KATE
And it's not that I insist on
remaining single. Believe me. Everyone
dreams of finding somebody to share
their life with. To give someone all
the love they've been hoarding since
they were a kid. I'm no different.
But one has to be sensible. I have a
career and a life that's filled
with...
She looks around. Leopold is gone.
KATE
Not again...
She starts off down the street, stops, and enters ROBERTA'S,
an upscale boutique.
Kate heads down the stairs of a subway station. A few feet
behind, Leopold cautiously follows.
Kate races from the subway station, entering the Arthur Murray
Dance Studio. Leopold, thoroughly disheveled, follows at a
distance.
Chinatown, Little Italy, chess in Washington Square Park.
Leopold and Charlie explore the city. Leopold works diligently
on his walk. A beautiful woman walks by in a revealing outfit.
Charlie catches Leopold watching her and smiles broadly.
CHARLIE
Interesting?
Leopold, caught leering, turns away sheepishly and smiles.
Charlie pats Leopold on the back. Stops. Pats his back again.
CHARLIE
What the hell is that?
LEOPOLD
What?
CHARLIE
Leopold, are you wearing a corset?
LEOPOLD
Naturally.
Cracking up, Charlie good-naturedly puts an arm around
Leopold's shoulder. Leopold attempts the same pulls away.
Charlie and Leopold walk through the park. A rubber softball
hits Leopold squarely on the head.
LEOPOLD
What in the world...?
A couple race over. The man is BLACK. The woman is WHITE.
Their child, ELIZABETH, 7, follows wide eyed and apprehensive.
MAN
Sorry! We're so sorry. Are you hurt?
WOMAN
She's another Babe Ruth. We had no
idea. Are you okay?
Leopold regards them curiously.
WOMAN
What do you have to say for yourself,
Elizabeth?
ELIZABETH
I'm sorry!
Leopold stares hard at the modern familial scene. He doesn't
speak. After a long moment:
LEOPOLD
Is this your child?
MAN
Yes.
Charlie braces for the worst. The little girl stares at
Leopold.
LEOPOLD
I see.
WOMAN
C'mon honey, lets go.
ELIZABETH
I want my ball.
LEOPOLD
Just a moment!
(bending down to
Elizabeth, firmly)
Pick a hand.
She picks his right hand. Nothing. She picks his left.
Nothing. Leopold looks surprised then pulls the ball from
his ear. She takes the ball and smiles at him.
LEOPOLD
My mother's name was Elizabeth.
(then to her parents)
She's a beautiful child. You're very
lucky.
MAN
What do you say, Elizabeth?
Elizabeth makes an embarrassed face.
MAN
Thank you.
Charlie and Leopold continue through the park, Leopold lost
in thought. Charlie watches him in surprise. They walk on.
Charlie and Leopold approach Caffeine, a trendy coffee house.
Charlie looks in the window.
CHARLIE
There they all are. Now one more
thing. Throw the words "like" and
"you know" into a sentence whenever
possible. It's how people talk today.
LEOPOLD
Proper speech does not cease to exist
simply because it is ignored.
CHARLIE
Please?
LEOPOLD
Charles, you needn't fret. I have
the walk down pat. I will not give
myself away. Like.
CHARLIE
(looking in the window)
Oh shit!
(correcting himself)
Shoot.
LEOPOLD
What is it?
CHARLIE
Patrice. See that girl? The blonde
one? She's so inconceivably hot.
LEOPOLD
She's very pretty.
CHARLIE
She's mine.
LEOPOLD
Congratulations.
CHARLIE
Ok not exactly mine. But I saw her
first.
LEOPOLD
I understand.
CHARLIE
Okay. I guess we should go in. I
don't suppose we could tell everyone
you don't speak English?
LEOPOLD
Of course not. Let's go inside.
Leopold walks his casual walk inside, followed by a very
reluctant Charlie.
Leopold trots his horse expertly along the horse path. Kate
follows, clutching the horses neck, bouncing like a clown.
KATE
I... I must have gotten a funny
horse...
Leopold turns and rides around Kate.
LEOPOLD
Allow me.
Bethesda fountain. Boats on Central Park Lake. Couples in
Sheeps Meadow.
Holding the reins of Kate's horse in one hand, Leopold grasps
Kate's waist with the other as they ride a single horse
through the greenery of Central Park.
A revival house. On the Marquee: "The Tenuous Duke" starring
Ronald Coleman.
Grammercy Park, The Guggenheim Museum, Central Park Plaza,
The Metropolitan Museum.
Kate and Leopold bound up the steps, entering the museum.
Sunlight floods the room. Clothes are scattered about. Two
figures lie curled up together sleeping in bed. One of the
figures rolls around. The covers are pulled back revealing:
CHARLIE
Good morning.
PATRICE
Morning.
They kiss.
CUT TO:
Central Park in full bloom, Botanical Gardens, The Frock
Museum.
Leopold walks out of the restaurant trying to remain calm.
His emotions get the best of him. Finally, exhausted, he
winds up walking along Central Park South.
Hansom Carriages wait to be taken out. He approaches slowly.
He stops along side one of the cabs and strokes the horse's
head.
He looks at the horse for a long time. Then he looks at the
skyscrapers surrounding him, deciding what to do. He lays
his face against the horse's head, torn.
CUT TO:
Dressed to the nines, Leopold leads a blindfolded Kate through
the street. She is clumsier than usual.
KATE
Where are you taking me?
LEOPOLD
This is something I've wanted to do
for a long time.
She takes off her blindfold and looks up at the sign:
ROSELAND.
KATE
Leopold?
LEOPOLD
This will be very therapeutic.
He takes her arm and escorts her in.
Down from the horizon, a farm house. LEO COLES, 5 years old,
rocks on his front porch swing. Using his bare hands as
puppets he carries on a conversation. JULIA CARLSON pulls up
in her car.
CARLSON
Hi. Does Katherine Coles live here?
LEO
Yeah.
(yelling inside)
MOM??
CARLSON
You're Leo aren't you? You don't
remember me but I knew you when you
were yea big.
(she holds her hands
an inch apart)
LEO
Yeah.
CARLSON
I'm Julia. I'm an old friend of your
mothers.
LEO
(proudly)
We had spaghetti at our house 4 times
this week.
Kate comes out on the porch. She looks lovely.
KATE
Leo you don't have to holler like
that. I'm not deaf...
CARLSON
Kate?
KATE
...Carlson?!
The two women scream, run to each other and embrace.
KATE
Carlson, I don't believe it. It's
been... I don't know how many years.
What are you doing here.
CARLSON
I came to see you, sweetie.
KATE
You remember my son, Leo?
CARLSON
We've just been getting acquainted.
KATE
Well, come inside. Come inside.
A FLASH of light illuminates the forest at the Albany estate.
A BEAT. Kate races from the forest onto a massive lawn,
stumbling in mud as she hurries to the mansion's entrance.
