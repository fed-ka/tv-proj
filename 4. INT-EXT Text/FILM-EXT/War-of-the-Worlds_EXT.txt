Ray (in his 30s, short hair, rough groomed, almost always wears
his New York baseball cap, raggedly dressed, looks like he hasn't
slept in days) is moving cargo boxes from the ship to ground
loading brackets. Shots show him inside the control room operating
the levers. As the last car is loaded, he is seen walking down
the stairs.
SAL
Ray!! Ferrier! Whoa!
Ray turns away and laughs because he already knows what he is
going to say.
SAL
I need you back at 4:00 instead of 12:00
I got half of Korea coming in.
RAY
No, no, no I can't. I'm on a 12 hour
blow! Call Tadesko.
Camera follows them walking down the street.
SAL
Tadesko can't move 40 containers in
an hour. I need somebody who can do
double picks.
RAY
I wish I could help you Sal. God damn
union regulations.
SAL
(getting angry) Come on, I'm in a position
here!
RAY
Come on, you remember the union regulations,
Sal.
SAL
(angrily) You know what your problem
is?
Sal stops on one side of the street while Ray continues walking.
RAY
(joking) I can think of a couple of
women who'd be happy to tell you.
Ray gets out and takes the last can of trash to the street as
Tim (in his 30s, wearing expensive clothes, slicked sharp hair,
extremely well groomed, looks like (and is) rich) and Ray's ex-wife
Mary Ann (in her 30s, pregnant with maternity clothes on, hair
hanging loose and rather unkempt) stand at their new car. Robbie
(15, ragged, tough look, long hair, partially groomed, worn clothes
(but looks in style), hip side pack with misc. objects in it.)
and Rachel (10, still dressed in Barbie color scheme clothing,
long unkempt hair in pigtails) are in the car.
RAY
Is it 8:30? We say that?
MARY ANN
We said 8:00.
RAY
(changing subject) Hey, this is one
safe looking vehicle you got yourself
here Tim. Congratulations.
TIM
Thank You.
RAY
8 o'clock huh?
MARY ANN
Um-Huh. We'll be back by 9:30 on Sunday,
depending on the traffic.
Robbie gets out of the car, carelessly banging the door on the
electrical pole. He is listening to his MP3 player at a loud
enough volume for the camera (10' away to hear).
RAY
There he is! You got a hug?
Robbie ignores him as if he was not there and heads up to the
front door of the house.
RAY
(continues) Confusing handshake? (joking)
Kick in the teeth? The door's locked.
(to Mary Ann): Still working on those
manners?
Mary Ann nods "yes" as Rachel gets out of the car.
RACHEL
Hello dad.
RAY
Hello, Rachel!
Rachel gives him a hug and goes back to the car to retrieve her
bag. She struggles and Mary Ann, Tim, and Ray try to help which
results in a small bicker argument. (Ray, Tim, and Mary Ann add
lib.)
ROBBIE
(during bickering, at the front door)
The door's locked.
MARY ANN
(suit case in hand) I'll just get it
in the door.
RACHEL
It's got rollers, just roll it.
MARY ANN
Well we can't roll it up the stairs
now can we?
RAY
Really, I got it from here, okay?
RAY
There he is. (Robbie puts on his new
cap) Boston? (hesitating) That's how
it is? (no response from Robbie) That's
how it's gonna be?
Robbie throws ball at Ray unexpectedly who catches it just barely
and comments...
RAY
Careful with that throw.
ROBBIE
Whatever Ray!
RAY
Your mom says you've got a report due
on Monday, so you are going to work
on that when you're done here.
During next lines (until noted) they throw the ball back and
fourth.
ROBBIE
Yeah, I'm almost finished, I just got
to type it up.
RAY
Yeah, bullshit!
ROBBIE
Yeah, and what do you know Ray?
RAY
Everything. Haven't you heard? Between
me and my brother, we know everything.
RACHEL
What's the capital of Australia?
RAY
That's one my brother knows.
ROBBIE
Is it okay with you if I just laugh
the first 500 times you tell that one.
RAY
Just do your report. We don't send you
to school so you can flunk out.
ROBBIE
You don't pay for it, Tim does.
Ray throws the ball at Robbie hard enough to knock dust off his
mitt. Robbie shakes his hand in his mitt and grits his teeth
in pain.
RAY
That's half of what I've got.
ROBBIE
You're an asshole. I hate coming here.
RAY
That why you act like such a dick?
Ray throws the ball and Robbie purposely misses, shattering a
window behind him. Robbie turns his hat backwards and walks up
the stairs back into the house. Ray stares at Rachel who stares
back.
RAY
What?
RACHEL
That's not how you're going to get through
to him. You want him to listen to you...
RAY
(interrupts her) What are you? Your
mother or mine?
RACHEL
Where are you going?
RAY
To sleep. I work for a living.
RACHEL
What are we supposed to eat?
RAY
You know, order.
Pan left to see the storm cloud still lighting up in some spots.
Ray walks down the stairs to see that nobody else has power and
for some reason all the cars seem to have just stopped working.
By now we get the picture (EMP). He walks out onto the sidewalk
where he is joined by his friend.
FRIEND 2
You believe this Ray? Every single car.
Ray walks past her onto the street where he sees ROBBIE walking
up the street towards him. Ray begins running towards him.
RAY
(worried) Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus.
ROBBIE
The car just stopped and...
RAY
(interrupts him) You're okay? Are you
okay?
ROBBIE
... and the lighting started hitting
about a block away over and over again.
And me and this other guy we...
RAY
(getting angry) Where the hell'd you
go?
ROBBIE
Over on Lincoln Avenue. (break) ...
by the church.
RAY
Did you see it? Did you... Were you
near it?
ROBBIE
Yeah. 26 times we counted! Over and
over the lighting started hitting. It
opened up this hole or something...
RAY
26 times?
ROBBIE
Yeah.
RAY
Okay, well, you're okay?
ROBBIE
Yeah.
RAY
Good, because your sister is in the
house, I want you to go in that house
and I want you to stay with her. Okay?
(break, as he starts running down the
street) And the next time you take my
car with no driver's license and no
permission, I call the cops. You better
be there when I get back.
Robbie doesn't move in fear. Ray gets angry that he is not going.
RAY
Robbie. (snaps his hands together)
Ray begins walking down the street to the auto shop a few yards
away.
RAY
Manny! Manny! Hey Manny. What is it,
dead?
MANNY
All of them, everything, look at this...
(taps the starter motor) starter's fried.
RAY
Lightning hit it?
MANNY
Not even close. I thought if I changed
it... you got any idea what's going
on?
RAY
I'm on my way to find out. Try umm...
try changing the solenoids.
MANNY
Right, (to accompanying mechanic) Right
see, I told you that, the solenoids.
Everyone who's car is fried is checking their car to see what
went wrong. Ray joins about 30 people walking down to where the
lightning started hitting. Ray's friends join him. Cops walk
by.
COP 1
Let us through. Let us through here.
FRIEND 3
Hey, what up, Ray?
RAY
(joking) I should of known you two were
behind this.
FRIEND 3
Hey, god's pissed off at the Neibor
hood
RAY
Can you blame him?
FRIEND 4
You see it?
RAY
Yep, you got power where you are?
FRIEND 3
Nope, nothing.
RAY
It's the cars though. That's the thing.
FRIEND 4
Solar Flare, that's what this guy told
me.
RAY
A solar flare?
FRIEND 4
Yeah, the sun shoots off blobs of plasma,
they turn into solar flare flashes.
It's the only thing that can kill all
of the electronic stuff.
FRIEND 3
Can I say something?
FRIEND 4
What bro?
FRIEND 3
The sun does not cause lightning, okay?
FRIEND 4
Bro, I'm just telling you what that
guy said he heard.
FRIEND 3
I know but it just sounds dumb saying
that...
Ray and his friends walk up to this hole in the ground where
everyone else is gathered around.
COP 1
I never seen anything like this before.
That many strikes of lighting in one
spot.
The cops start ushering people to stay back away from the hole.
RAY
Is this the only place?
Ray picks up a stone that is white next to all the black asphalt
crumbs. He switches it from hand to hand because it is too cold
to hold in one hand.
FRIEND 4
Is it hot?
RAY
No. It's freezing.
The police officers and the other people gathered around feel
a vibration under their feet.
COP 2
What is that?
RAY
You feel that?
FRIEND 3
Yeah, I feel that.
FRIEND 4
What is it the subway?
COP 1
There's no subway here.
FRIEND 4
PATH Train maybe?
COP 1
That can't be the water main.
COP 2
There's nothing else down there.
COP 1
The water main doesn't run through here.
COP 2
Well, there's something down there and
it's moving.
The pavement starts to crack into a wider circle. People start
running away from the crack as it gets bigger and bigger. Windows
start to crack under pressure as the pavement separates even
more. Entire sheets of road split into pieces causing everyone
on the road to loose their balance. Shots of more shattering
windows. Busting pipes. The church starts cracking apart and
moving with a GIANT CIRCLE of pavement that moves. The pavement
lurches up and then caves down. A few cars go tumbling in. Something
throws the last car that tumbled in back out flying through the
air as a leg of the robot makes a lurch out of the hole. The
police continue trying to move people away. The engines of the
ship start coming out as they power up. The entire ship comes
out and begins dusting it's self off. Ray and his friends hide
behind a building.
FRIEND 4
Oh my god.
Ray begins walking out from behind the building.
FRIEND 4
Ray, no, stay man.
The machine makes a large vibrating noise as if calling out to
other robots. It arms it's disintegrator beams and opens fire.
People can be seen to disintegrate as they are struck with the
beam. The beams, when fired make a zap sound. People start exploding
into dust and their clothes are blown away. Ray misses numerous
beams by a foot or two as he goes into a convenience store. Again
Ray runs out the back door and misses another beam by inches.
He runs his ass off trying to escape the robot. Disintegrator
beams strike off rooftops to clear a walking path. Ray hides
behind a building as the machine walks by.
EVENING
Ray walks into the house where he is met by Rachel's gawking
eyes out the window. Robbie stands in the background looking
at the doorway. Ray walks past Rachel then Robbie toward the
kitchen. Rachel and Robbie follow him into the kitchen. With
anxious eyes, Robbie begins to say...
ROBBIE
What happened?
Ray sits down against the wall of the island countertop in the
kitchen, not responding.
RACHEL
What's going on?
Robbie squats down next to Ray as Rachel rests her elbows on
the stool at the island.
RACHEL
Dad, what's the matter?
ROBBIE
What's all that stuff all over you?
Ray seems to be delirious as he slurs his head towards Robbie.
Rachel reaches through a leg of the
island to pull at Ray's hood on his
shirt. BAM! Ray jumps and jerks his
head toward Rachel fast enough to make
some of the white powder poof off as
if jerked back into reality. Robbie
jumps as well in fright.
RACHEL
What's all the stuff?
ROBBIE
Hello? Ray?
Ray looks at his arms which are coated in the white powder. He
gets up and begins heading for the bathroom. Still unresponsive
to the questions he was just asked. He looks in the mirror to
see that he is covered in the whit powder (human ash). He quickly
does his best to wash it off realizing what it is. After washing
it off, he begins mentally planning what to do.
Walking back into the kitchen...
RAY
We're leaving this house in 60 seconds.
Ray grabs an old Penzoil box and dumps the tools out of it. He
shoves the box into Robbie who grasps it as to not fall over
at the force Ray used.
ROBBIE
(questioning) What? Wait. I have no
idea what's going on...
RAY
(while Robbie asks) ... all the food
from the refrigerator and the cupboard,
put it in here.
ROBBIE
I think we are having a bit of a shock
here...what's going on, just tell me...
RAY
Just do it.
Ray runs toward the table, grabs a flashlight and begins to try
to get it to work.
RAY
Rachel, sweetheart...
RACHEL
Dad, you're really scaring me.
RAY
I need you to get your suitcase...
RACHEL
Dad. (break) Dad!
RAY
The one that you brought, bring it to
me, okay?
Ray shoves cereal boxes aside to get to the cabinet over the
refrigerator for batteries. Hastily grabbing the package, he
realizes they are probably dead due to the EMP.
RAY
Can you do that for me, darling?
Still in the car...
RACHEL
Come on, hurry up Dad...
As soon as the van stops, Robbie gets out and opens the door
for Rachel.
RACHEL
Robbie, get the door.... (she knocks
on it)
Robbie grabs the keys off his belt loop as Rachel begins running
up to the front door.
RACHEL
(begins, and continues once in the house)
MOM! TIM!!
ROBBIE
(begins, and continues once in the house)
MOM!! TIM!!
Ray remains in the car realizing how unimportant he really is
(kids are shouting for Tim).
Ray sees the fuselage with one surviving person hauling a blue
cart through the aisle.
RAY
Down here!
The man continues hauling the cart.
RAY
Were you on this plane? Are you a passenger?
The cart comes flying down the fuselage doorway as the man creeps
down the floor to the ground.
MAX (NEWS CAMERA OPERATOR)
Hey, how you doing? Wanna help me open
this?
The news reporter comes rushing out from the side of the news
van in the background.
RAY
Are you a passenger?
NEWS REPORTER
He's deaf. The shell went off right
beside him. The camera on his shoulder
saved his life. (to Max) You hear that
Max? Your stupid camera saved your stupid
life.
They succeed in jimmying open the cart and begin bagging all
the water and food they can.
RAY
Where were you?
NEWS REPORTER
Out there in the pine barrens. We were
attached to a National Guard unit, the
83rd Mechanized. They moved to one of
those things around midnight. They've
got some kind of shield around them.
We can't see it, but everything we fire
at them detonates too early before we
can get close enough to cause any damage.
When they flash that thing, everything
lights up like Hiroshima.
She begins eating one of the meal packages.
RAY
There's more than one?
REPORTER
You gotta be kidding me right?
FIELD - DAWN
Ray is carrying Rachel to the van. Robbie is walking along behind
them looking at the devastation.
RAY
You're doing good. You're doing good.
Keep your eyes on me. We'll go right
to Boston, and we're gonna see your
mom.
RACHEL
I'm not gonna look, dad.
RAY
That's a girl. That's my girl.
Okay,
listen, I want you to close your eyes.
Got them closed?
RACHEL
Um-Huh.
RAY
There you go. Keep em' closed for me.
Camera follows Robbie who puts his hands on his head in amassment
of the devastation. Ray starts the car and turns it around to
pull out.
RAY
Robbie, get in.
Robbie does not react at all. Ray becomes agitated.
RAY
ROBBIE!! GET IN!!!
RACHEL
Why are you yelling?
Ray gives him a mean look as Robbie realizes that they must go.
RAY
(to Rachel) It's okay. (to Robbie) Get
in!
They pull away from the wreckage and continue on their journey.
Ray is reading the map while Robbie looks out the window. They
are taking back roads that have nothing but farmlands on them.
ROBBIE
Why the hell aren't we on the turnpike?
RAY
Because I don't want everybody to see
we've got a working car. (going over
the plan) We'll stay along the Hudson
until we find an open bridge or ferry,
then we're gonna cross the Hudson. Then
take the back roads across Connecticut
all the way to Boston.
RACHEL
Where is everybody?
RAY
I don't know. Running, hiding, hiding
in their basements.
ROBBIE
If we had any balls, we'd go back there
and find one of those things and kill
it.
RAY
Yeah, well, why don't you just let me
make the big decisions, okay?
Ray shoves the map on the floorboard as he becomes more angry
at Robbie.
ROBBIE
Which would be when? Never Ray? Never's
about your speed.
RACHEL
Okay, enough Robbie!
RAY
(angrily) Okay! Enough with the Ray
shit!! It's dad, sir, or if you want
Mr. Ferrier. That sounds a little weird
to me but you decide.
RACHEL
Dad?!?!
RAY
Yes, Rachel.
RACHEL
I have to go to the bathroom.
RAY
Really?
Rachel shakes her head "yes" as he pulls the car over.
Ray grabs Robbie by the shirt arm and holds him in the car. He
glares at Rachel mean enough to make her freeze in her seat.
ROBBIE
Come on. (tugs at his shirt sleeve which
Ray has a hold of) I gotta go!
RAY
Not so fast, not so fast, all right?
Now, there are two things we have to
watch out for, and the second is people
who might want our car.
ROBBIE
There's nobody around!
RACHEL
I gotta go.
Robbie breaks free of Ray's grasp on his sleeve. Robbie and Rachel
both get out of the car. Ray follows the both of them to supervise
the whole event from the van.
RAY
(displeased) Rachel! Rachel, that's
good right there. (points to a spot
20' away)
RACHEL
I'M NOT GOING IN FRONT OF YOU GUYS!
RAY
All right, then just go where I can
see you!
RACHEL
ARE YOU CRAZY?? DON'T LOOK!!
RAY
I'm not gonna look! JUST STAY IN SIGHT!!
RACHEL
THAT'S LOOKING!!
Rachel is about 200 feet away entering a patch of bushes. Robbie
has already found a spot about 10' away next to the stream under
the road.
RAY
Listen. Every time you don't listen
to me, I'm telling your mother, okay?
I'm making a list. (reinforcing) I'm
making a list!
Rachel is entering the wooded area next to the stream looking
for a half way decent spot. She sees the river and looks at it
in beauty just as she sees a body floating down it. MORE BODIES
start coming at a huge rate. 20,30,40,50 bodies floating down
the river. Rachel begins to hyperventilate again as Ray comes
up from behind her and throws his hands over her eyes and grabs
her.
RAY
I told you to stay where I could see
you!
RACHEL
I'm sorry!
Ray grabs her into his arms and begins walking back to the van.
Army trucks can be heard crossing by the van. Robbie, who's only
interest is killing one of the robots sees this as an opportunity
to do so. Robbie runs toward the trucks and begins shouting....
ROBBIE
STOP!! DO YOU HAVE ROOM??? STOP!!!
Some trucks pass by as the soldiers in them look at him blankly.
ROBBIE
WAIT, STOP!!! LET ME ON!!! LET ME ON!!!
GIVE ME A HAND!!!
Robbie is getting soaked as the tank's tracks roll over the large
puddles of water. Robbie is not giving up hope that one may let
him on.
ROBBIE
WAIT!!! STOP!!! GIVE ME A HAND!!! YOU
HAVE ROOM!!!
SOLDIER
Watch it, kid! YOU'RE GONNA GET YOURSLELF
RUN OVER!!!
Ray sees Robbie trying to get on with them. He has had enough
of Robbie and goes up to him to tell him....
RAY
WHAT!?!?!
ROBBIE, YOU WANT TO GO IN
THAT DIRECTION?
Robbie, who ignores him is still shouting for them to stop.
RAY
THERE'S NOTHING LIVING IN THAT DIRECTION,
ROBBIE!!!
ROBBIE
WHAT DO YOU CARE?!?!? YOU NEVER GAVE
A SHIT BEFORE!!! YOU NEVER GAVE A SHIT!!!
RAY
OKAY, HARD ASS, WHAT'S YOUR PLAN? YOU'RE
IN CHARGE NOW, YOU TELL ME WHAT WE'RE
DOING!!
ROBBIE
WE CATCH UP WITH THESE SOLDIERS, WE
PICK UP WHOEVER ELSE ISN'T DEAD AND
WE GET BACK AT THEM!!! WE GET BACK AT
THEM!! THAT'S WHAT WE DO!!!
RAY
WELL, NOW LET'S TRY ONE THAT DOSEN'T
INVOLVE YOUR TEN YEAR OLD SISTER JOINING
THE ARMY! YOU HAVE ANYTHING LIKE THAT???
Ray and Robbie are about ready to start throwing punches at each
other as the tanks continue rolling by.
ROBBIE
WHY DON'T YOU JUST TELL US THE TRUTH???
RAY
YOU HAVE ANYTHING LIKE THAT!
ROBBIE
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHICH WAY TO GO!!
RAY
YOU HAVE ANYTHING LIKE THAT?!?!?!
ROBBIE
YOU WANNA COME OFF ALL WISE AND SHIT!!
YOU ONLY CHOSE BOSTON BECAUSE YOU HOPE
MOM IS THERE AND IF SHE'S THERE, YOU
CAN DUMP US ON HER!!! YOU CAN DUMP US
ON HER THEN YOU'LL ONLY HAVE TO CARE
ABOUT YOURSELF!!! WITCH IS EXACTLY THE
WAY YOU LIKE IT!!!
Robbie is shivering in the cold of his wet clothes but his adrenaline
keeps him fighting at Ray. They both can be seen with the air
from their nostrils flaring like a bull. Rachel rushes in as
an attempt to get Robbie to realize what he's doing.
RACHEL
ROBBIE!!! WHERE ARE YOU TRYING TO GO?!?!
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO?!?!
Rachel begins to cry as Robbie looks at her in sorrow.
RACHEL
WHOE'S GONNA TAKE CARE OF ME IF YOU
GO!!!
Rachel's last line almost brings Robbie to tears as he picks
her up and starts walking over to the van. Ray stands next to
the still rolling army vehicles and begins to realize how this
brother and sister have come to rely on each other during the
divorce of their parents.
Random, pointless music is playing over the PA system as people
are being herded by soldiers onto a ferry boat. A blood bank
woman says over a megaphone...
WOMAN
Unless you are O-positive and Rh negative,
thank you but we already have more blood
than we can use. Again... (repeats message)
Shots of the herded people boarding the ferry.
Solders are heard and seen saying "this way" and "keep it moving
folks".
HARBOR MASTER
Please move forward calmly, the boat
can make more than one trip. Please
move forward calmly, take your time,
don't rush. (repeats)
SHERYL
Ray! RAY?!?!
RAY
Sheryl?
SHERYL
Yeah.
Ray and Sheryl hug as they are re-united.
SHERYL
Oh, my gosh, are these your kids?
RAY
Yes, this is Rachel.
SHERYL
Hi, I'm Sheryl, this is my daughter,
Nora.
Ray, Sheryl, Nora, and Rachel exchange handshakes.
RAY
Hi, I've heard about you, Nora.
Rachel looks at sea gulls that are flying rather fast away from
the boat. Robbie meets Sheryl with Ray.
RAY
This is my son, Robbie.
ROBBIE
Hi Sheryl.
SHERYL
He's just like dad.
Rachel continues watching the gulls.
SHERYL
How you doing? You look like shit.
Rachel is now fully into watching the gulls. Ray, Sheryl, and
Robbie are engaged into small talk. Rachel sees the gulls flying
around something over the horizon behind the city.
RACHEL
(to herself) The trees are funny.
HARBOR MASTER
We're gonna move some cars out of the
way to make more space. Give us a few
minutes.
Rachel watches the trees begin to be flattened and moved as something
gets brighter on the horizon. Rachel grabs Ray's finger and he
realizes that she wants him. Ray turns around to see what Rachel
wants as he too sees the thing on the horizon. Robbie sees Ray
looking that way, so he too looks that way. A robot puts it's
last foot down with a thud and looks at the dock full of people.
It makes the vibration noise which gets the attention of everybody.
The crowd begins overrunning the soldiers and cramming onto the
ship for safety. The captain sees the overflow and prepares the
ship for takeoff to try to stop the overflow.
CAPTAIN
CAST OFF!!! GET THAT RAMP UP!!!
HARBOR MASTER
CAST OFF NOW!!! GET THAT RAMP UP!!!
(to soldiers) No more people! No more
people! We're taking the ramp up.
The soldiers create a blockade which holds back the crowd for
quite a while. As the crowd starts to collect, the soldiers start
to bulge forward from people pushing them. Three robots now switch
on their lights to look over the crowd of people. A moving crowd
of about 1,000 people is now collecting on the soldiers who so
far are withstanding.
Ray, now in the front next to a soldier, tries to get them to
let him and his family through. They say there is no more room.
RAY
(to Sheryl) You just stay with me! Grab
my jacket!
SHERYL
I got you Ferrier. (trips) oh, Jesus!
RAY
You okay? Come on!
SHERYL
Jesus. Oh my god!
RAY
Come on.
The harbor master hit's the switch to start the ramp motor to
begin folding up the ramp. Soldiers shove empty cars off the
ramp.
Sheryl is knocked around by a few people and looses grip of Ray's
jacket.
SHERYL
Oh, Ray!! RAY!!!
They run faster and Sheryl falls farther behind. Robbie makes
a grab for her hand but a soldier stops Sheryl just short.
SHERYL
NO, I CAN GO WITH HIM!!!
RAY!!!! NO!!!!
The ramp begins lifting as a few people make one last jump and
latch on to it. Ray looks back for Sheryl.
RAY
SHERYL?!?!? SHERYL!!!!
SHERYL
RAY!!!!
RAY
There's room on the boat!!!
SHERYL
LET US THROUGH GOD DAMN IT!!!
RAY
THERE'S STILL ROOM ON THE BOAT!!! THERE'S
ROOM ON THE BOAT!!! THERE'S ROOM ON
THE BOAT!!!
Rachel screams as Ray runs to the bow with Rachel in his arms.
Robbie is soon to follow...
RACHEL
ROBBIE?!?!
RAY
Stay with me! Stay with me Robbie!!!
Robbie runs right past them and up to the captain's deck.
RAY
ROBBIE!!!
Robbie, panting hard, looks at the inclining ramp and sees there
are still people hanging on to the back side of the ramp. He
starts running to the stern of the ship.
The captain pushes the throttle all the way full. The propellers
start so fast they spray water all over the people still at the
dock. Pulling away at it's ties to the dock, the ship begins
pulling away.
RACHEL
(seeing Robbie running to the stern)
Robbie? Robbie!?!?!
RAY
Robbie!!!
RACHEL
ROBBIE!!!
Robbie ignores them as he jumps onto the grate of the folded
up ramp. Climbing to the top, he begins helping those who are
hanging on the back side of the ramp.
ROBBIE
Here, grab my hand!! Hold on! I got
you! HOLD ON!!!
Camera turns or Ray's face. Ray looks at Robbie helping people
in admiration and proud ness.
ROBBIE
TAKE MY HAND!! TAKE IT!!!
Ray is heaving Rachel up to shore. Robbie is not far behind.
They are all fighting to get their breath after swimming for
so long. Ray can no longer haul Rachel up the beach.
RAY
Help me. Help me with her.
ROBBIE
(gagging) Okay.
Robbie almost slips as he gags, still fighting for breath.
Pulling each other up the hill....
RAY
Don't stop. Don't stop.
Alert sirens can be heard coming from the city.
Ray pulls the two of them.
ROBBIE
(yells in pain) AHHH.
They all lay on the hillside, gasping for air. In the distance
they look... Two robots are still picking people up out of the
water. Two more robots have joined and are picking up people
off the streets. Many people scream.
With jaws clattering, Rachel looks toward the other hillside
on the other side of the river. Shivering Ray and Robbie look
there with her.
THREE MORE robots are on the opposite hillside blasting people
with their disintegrator beams. Many more people scream. Rachel,
in fright, runs towards the bushes behind Ray. Ray sees her,
and runs with her. Robbie runs with them. They stop and squat
down as they see the top of another robot coming over the hill
to join the three.
Robbie, running, with clenched teeth, stops. His jaw drops as
we are able to see hundreds of thousands of articles of clothing
falling from the sky. They continue running through the woods
where clothes fall like snow.
Pasture Fence Line - Dark
Robbie is walking 5' ahead of Ray and Rachel along a fence line
of a pasture. Gunfire is seen and heard over the hill about 500
yards away. Robbie, who always wanted to help in the fight, begins
walking faster toward the gunfire.
RACHEL
Robbie, slow down.
Robbie follows the fence line and walks a little faster.
RACHEL
Robbie, slow down!!!
Robbie, who is coming closer to the hill, sees army trucks rolling
down the road and up the hill. Seeing this, Robbie walks into
a slow run along the fence line. Ray and Rachel try to keep up.
RACHEL
Robbie.
RAY
Robbie. We got to stay together Robbie.
Robbie, getting closer, runs faster, faster.
RAY
Robbie! Stay together! ROBBIE!!!
Ray and Rachel duck as a missile comes EXTREMELY CLOSE to their
heads. Jets speed by them overhead. Rachel screams.
RAY
GET BACK HERE!!!
Robbie, in a full scale run, runs with the army trucks that have
now taken to the hills. Ray and Rachel run as fast as they can
to try to stay with Robbie.
RACHEL
Robbie!! NO!! ROBBIE!!! COME BACK!!!
Robbie runs with the trucks with all his might. Ray and Rachel
are now searching for him.
RAY
ROBBIE!!! (sets Rachel down next to
a tree) NOW DON'T MOVE! FOR GOD'S SAKE,
STAY RIGHT HERE! I'M COMING RIGHT BACK!
(calling out for him) ROBBIE!!!
Ray sees Robbie about 20' ahead of him.
RAY
ROBBIE!!! ROBBIE!!!
Robbie is held back by two soldiers. Robbie gets thrown back
by them where Ray grabs him and pins him to the ground. Robbie
fights to get back up.
RAY
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS???
Soldiers are blasting everything they have to something over
the hill. Radio people are telling their officers "no effect
on target".
Robbie is watching all he is able to see while Ray tries to get
his attention on him.
RAY
LISTEN TO ME! TURN AROUND! I WANT YOU
TO LISTEN TO ME!
Robbie ignores him and continues watching artillery blast over
the hill.
Ray gets fed up with Robbie. He grabs his shoulders and flips
him over on to his back. Robbie looks at Ray in fright that he
did that. Ray grabs his coat shoulders, and climbs on top of
him, pining him down to the ground.
RAY
LISTEN TO ME!
Rachel watches helicopters fire missiles simultaneously over
the hill.
RAY
DON'T DO THIS! I LOVE YOU!
ROBBIE
I NEED TO BE HERE! I NEED TO SEE THIS!!
RAY
I KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE YOU HAVE TO BUT
YOU DON'T!!!
ROBBIE
LET ME GO!!!
RAY
YOU DON'T!!!
ROBBIE
PLEASE LET ME GO!!!
Rachel is approached by people. They think she's alone so they
try to talk her into coming with them (ad lib).
RAY
I'M NOT LETTING YOU DO THIS!! YOU CAN
HATE ME.....
Robbie tries to fight to get up but Ray keeps him pinned to the
ground.
RAY
... YOU CAN HATE ME. BUT I LOVE YOU!!
ROBBIE
LET ME GO PLEASE!!!
RAY
I'M NOT LETTING YOU DO THIS!!!
ROBBIE
DAD!!
Ray sees the couple trying to get Rachel to go with them. For
a second, Ray doesn't know what to do.
RAY
Just listen to me!
ROBBIE
I need to be here! I want to see this!
RAY
Wait, stay. Stay for Rachel. Stay for
your sister.
ROBBIE
Please let me go! You need to let me
go.
Ray and Robbie are silent for what seems to them like forever.
Ray looks to Rachel who is being carried away by the couple.
Robbie manages to turn back over to his stomach. After enough
trying, Robbie is able to squirm out of Ray's grasp on his shoulders.
Robbie crawls out of Ray's grasp and stands up. They stare at
each other for a while and Robbie begins running over the hill.
Ray runs over to Rachel to get her back from the couple.
RAY
GET OFF!!! I'M HER FATHER!!! I'M HER
FATHER!!!
WOMAN
We thought she was alone... we....
She doesn't finish as she scurries away. Ray looks at the hill
where the soldiers were firing at... A FLAMING army truck rolls
over the hill.
RAY
Robbie?!?!
Two more trucks come over the hill ablaze. Suddenly... BOOM!!!
A ring of mine charges go off at the peak of the hill. The explosion
blast is almost big enough to knock Ray off of his feet.
RAY
ROBBIE!!!
By now, Robbie has run over the hill and is long out of site.
A robot that appears to be on fire comes slowly rising over the
hill. Ray makes a run for it down the hill. We can see three
robots now rising over the hill. Missiles and bullets are being
fired at them as their shields block all the fired artillery.
Harland lives in the basement of his house about 300 feet away
from the hill that the robots came over. He is holding a rifle
as a signal for anybody who can see him.
HARLAND
Over here! OVER HERE!!!
Ray and Rachel run towards him.
HARLAND
Hurry!!
The three of them scurry into the basement. Ray and Rachel run
into the main room while Harland proceeds to close the cellar
doors. Gunfire can be heard alongside the screams from people.
Lights flash through the cracks in the walls and door.
