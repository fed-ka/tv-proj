  FADE IN:

  EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY (FLASHBACK)11

  Dry, deserted, silent.  If there were any signs of life, they d 
  point to spring, 1975.  But there are no cars, no people, no 
  stray dogs. 

  SUDDENLY a six-year-old boy runs into frame.  This is YOUNG 
  CALL.  He s sweaty, dirty, scared, and RUNNING for his life.  
  His worn-out chucks kick up dirt.  

  His heart pounds faster than his feet.  He looks behind him.  
  We re not sure what he sees yet, but it scares him enough to RUN 
  even harder.  Everything gets brighter, and whiter, and FREEZES 
  into a NEGATIVE.  Then REAL TIME again.  There s a POP and FLASH 
  and we re suddenly in --

                                                                              CUT TO:

  INT. PHARMACY/COUNTER - DAY (D1)22

  The bright, sterile lights of a pharmacy.  A sad man, DARRIN 
  CALL, 40, waits in a long line. The female PHARMACIST calls --

                                PHARMACIST
                Next.   

                              CALL
                Darrin Call.  

  She types it in the computer.  The result confuses her.   

                                PHARMACIST
                I don t have anything...  

                              CALL
                No, no, no.  I had a refill left. 

                                PHARMACIST
                No, I m sorry.    

                              CALL
                This isn t...  This isn t good.





                                                                              (CONTINUED)        CRIMINAL MINDS        "Haunted"        PINK     7/29/09 2.

  The boy, scared, runs down the road.  The SOUND of crunching 
  gravel gets louder and louder and we re --

  Call hits his head.   *

                              CALL
                Make it stop.  

                                PHARMACIST
                Sir, are you alright?  Mr. Call?  

  Other CUSTOMERS notice he s losing it and back up.  The 
    Pharmacist looks around -- 

                                                                              CUT TO:

  INT. PHARMACY/AISLES - DAY (D1)55

  A store full of customers, including a BANK GUARD, completely 
  unaware of the madness at the counter.  A few aisles over is a *
  STOCK BOY, 20 s. The Pharmacist waves him over.   *

                                                                              CUT TO:

66INT. PHARMACY/COUNTER - DAY (D1) 

  Call hits the computer snapping the Pharmacist back to him.  

                              CALL
                You ve got to help me.  

    Desperate, the pharmacist shoves a prescription bag on the 
  counter.  Call keeps hitting his head.   

                                PHARMACIST
                Here. It s okay. Sorry. Please, 
                just stop.     

  Stock Boy rushes over with box cutter in hand. Call BLINKS. *

  EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY (FLASHBACK)77

  Close.  Messy.  A man.  A shiny blade.  A violent struggle.  
  BLOOD, source unknown, is everywhere.  

                                                                            BACK TO: 

  INT. PHARMACY - DAY (D1)88

  Stock Boy touches Call s shoulders.  *

                              STOCK BOY*
                It s gonna be okay.  *

  The blade inadvertently in Call s face.  Call PUSHES the blade 
  into the stock boy s carotid.  It s fast and furious.  *

                                PHARMACIST
                Oh my god.  Oh my god.  

  Blood covers the floor.  Another CUSTOMER gets Call in a choke 
  hold, but he STABS him too.  They re slipping in blood as the 
  fight grows.  It s five against one and that one is winning.  

                                PHARMACIST (cont'd)
                Help them... 

  The Bank Guard finds the mess.  He pulls out his gun.  He and 
  another customer PULL Call away from the others, but Call GRABS 
  the GUN and in the struggle, SHOOTS both men.  The gun shots are 
    deafening.  A bullet HITS the Pharmacist s computer.  She ducks, 
  others scatter. Call, gun in hand, backs away.  He assesses what 
  he s done and RUNS down an aisle and out the front door.   

                                                                              CUT TO:

  ROSSI sits in his office.  MORGAN walks past.  Rossi calls out --

  Morgan comes in, busted.

                Emily s picking him up.

                He told me he was cleared to drive.

                What if he s got PTSD?  

                              ROSSI
                He got evaluated.

                Come on, we wrote those questions.  
                Hotch knows exactly how to answer

                What re you gonna do?  Pick apart

  Morgan considers.  Rossi s annoyed.

                I m just saying, every day Foyet s

                  Distracted.

                              ROSSI

  Mitchell refers to an evidence board dedicated to Darrin Call s 
  life.  There s STILL PHOTOS from security footage and a blown-up 
  STATE ID.  He s got a skinny file.

  Reid moves to the television with the security footage.

  JJ pauses it when Call turns around and stabs the stock boy.

                Now he s got two.  I just put his 
                face all over the news.  People are

                If this is what Call was running

                That takes some patience.  He

  Young Tommy s in a metal cage.  Young Call is not in the cage.  
  He cleans up.  Adds clothes and rags to a pile near the barrel.  

                              YOUNG TOMMY
                Hey kid. Did the old man pass out? 

  Young Call looks, nods yes. Young Tommy points to the keys.  

                              YOUNG TOMMY (cont'd)
                Can you reach those?  

  Young Call struggles but reaches the keys.  

                              YOUNG TOMMY (cont'd)
                You can do it.  Go ahead.  

  His hands are too little to hold the master lock and keys.  
  Young Tommy takes them, unlocks it and climbs out.  

                              YOUNG TOMMY (cont'd)
                Come on.  

  Young Tommy pulls Young Call with him.  A DOG BARKS.  The boys 
  look to the man s chair, but it s empty.  They RUN anyway -- 
  right into the man.  He whacks them both.  

                                                                              CUT TO:

  The man opens the cover to his red pick-up.  There s bags of 
  lime and Young Tommy, hands tied.  He uses the buck knife to  
  cut the rope from his wrists.  Young Call stands behind the man.  
  He s got the shovel.  It s almost bigger than him.  Young Tommy 
  thrashes and spits on the man.  He steps back -- and onto Young 
  Call.  He loses his footing.  Young Tommy takes advantage.  
  Grabs the shovel and WHACKS the man with it.  The man goes down, 
  head bleeding.  Tommy drops it, grabs the kid and runs.

                Come on, you can make it.    

  Young Call tries to catch up to him, but FALLS.  The man drives 
  the red pick-up and quickly catches up to him.  Tommy makes it 
  over the fence and looks back.  There s no way the kid will make 
  it.  Either Young Tommy keeps going or they both get killed.   
  He hesitates.  Doesn t want to leave the kid...

                                GARCIA
                Doris was married to Bill Jarvis.  
                He owned a machine shop outside the 
                city --

                              GARCIA*
                He lost it in 1980.  Hasn t done 
                anything since.  Guess he laid low.  *
                He owned a red pick-up until 1976 
                when he bought a black one.  I know *
                that because that s what he was *
                driving when he was arrested for *
                DUI s.  He was locked up from  77 *
                to  80.  *

                              PRENTISS
                He gave up on everything after 
                that.  *

  Mitchell, Rossi, Prentiss and Morgan find Hotch cuffing Call.  
  Bill and the gun are on the ground.  Mitchell takes over.  Call 
  stares at Bill, catatonic.  Mitchell shoves him out the door.  

                              MITCHELL
                What happened?

  Tommy grabs his cuffed hands.  Call doesn t pull away.  Hotch *
