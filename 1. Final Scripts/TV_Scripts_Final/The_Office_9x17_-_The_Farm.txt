      INT. LOBBY - MORNING

      Creed is on the elevator, waiting for the doors to close, 
      reading the paper.

                                    DWIGHT (O.S.)
                  Hold it!

      Creed holds the door as Dwight jogs on.  Dwight is wearing 
      formal tuxedo tails and a top hat, and he carries two tin 
      buckets of dirt.  Creed looks him over.

                                    CREED

                    Haircut?


      INT. OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

      Dwight enters and Erin sees his outfit.  

                                    ERIN
                    Dwight, wonderful!  So funny.  It s 
                  only nine a.m. and already you ve put 
                  two smiles on my face -- one when I 
                  first saw you just now, and now.

                                    DWIGHT
                  I am dressed according to the Schrute 
                  codes of mourning.  
                          (to room)
                  My Aunt Shirley has died.

      Erin keeps her smile but it becomes very confused.  People 
      look over.

                                    PAM
                  I m sorry, Dwight.  Were you close?

                                    DWIGHT
                    I would say that she raised me but 
                  let s not kid each other, I raised 
                    myself.  She was, however, the 
                    closest thing I had to a mother.  "The Farm" Writers First Draft - 7/30/122.


      DWIGHT TALKING HEAD

                                    DWIGHT
                  My actual mother was very cold and 
                    distant.  I d say she was the closest 
                  thing I had to an Aunt.


      BACK TO SCENE

                                    JIM
                  Well, my condolences.

                                    DWIGHT
                  Keep them.

                                    JIM
                  Okay, and the pails?

                                    DWIGHT
                  As with Schrute custom, I will now 
                  either invite you to Saturday s 
                    funeral by sprinkling fertile, red 
                  dirt in your face, or ask you to keep 
                    a respectful distance during my time 
                  of grief with a dusting of black, 
                    slightly acidic soil.

      He tosses black dirt in Erin s face.

                                    ERIN
                  What color is it?

                                    PHYLLIS
                  It looks pretty black.

                                    ERIN
                  Oh.

      Erin bows respectfully and then leans away from Dwight.  
      Dwight heads towards accounting, passing Phyllis at the 
      copier.  He tosses some black dirt in her face.  She wants to 
      protest but holds herself back.

      Dwight tosses black dirt in Meredith s face, then Kevin s -- 
      who can t help but take a taste.

                                    KEVIN
                  That s acidic alright.

      Dwight gets to Angela.  She holds out her face for him.  He 
      considers, then gives her the black dirt.  He then turns to 
      Oscar, who notices that Dwight is reaching for black dirt.  "The Farm" Writers First Draft - 7/30/123.


                                    OSCAR
                          (under breath)
                  Oh thank god.

                                    DWIGHT
                  Excuse me?  What was that?

                                    OSCAR
                    Nothing.  Just, I m not free 
                    Saturday.

                                    DWIGHT
                  What do you have to do?

                                    OSCAR
                  I have a personal training session.

                                    DWIGHT
                    A Schrute has died!

                                    OSCAR
                  I m very sorry about that, I ll of 
                  course be there if you want... it s 
                  just the sessions are prepaid and if 
                  you want to take that into account--

      Dwight cuts him off by throwing red dirt in his face.  


      OSCAR TALKING HEAD

                                    OSCAR
                  I get red dirt?  Nobody s getting the 
                  red dirt!

      B-roll:  Dwight goes around the office tossing black dirt in 
      everyone s face.  As he progresses he does it with a flourish.  
      Over the shoulder at Andy, behind the back at Darryl, with a 
      big wind up and then great caution at Stanley.

                                    OSCAR (CONT D)
                    I should have kept my mouth shut, 
                  we re not even that close.  I ve only 
                  known him, what, twelve years?  
                    ...Twelve years.  Time is a son of a 
                  bitch.


      RETURN TO SCENE

      Dwight now approaches Jim, and stands in front of him for a 
      beat.  "The Farm" Writers First Draft - 7/30/124.


                                    JIM
                  This is a tradition, huh?

      Dwight nods as he grabs a big handful of dirt.

                                    JIM (CONT D)
                  I did mention I am sorry for your 
                  loss.

                                    DWIGHT
                  Yes, thank you.

      Dwight starts packing the dirt in a tight ball.  Jim eyes it.

                                    JIM
                  I m sure she is in a better place 
                  now.

                                    DWIGHT
                  I like to think so.

      Dwight adds a little water (from a nearby bottle) to the dirt 
      ball to make it harder, and then adds more dirt.

                                    JIM
                  Dude, this isn t cool.  You can t 
                  throw-

                                    DWIGHT
                  God I miss her...
                          (emotional)
                  I miss her so much.

      Jim grits his teeth, and Dwight nails him in the face.


      DWIGHT TALKING HEAD

      Dwight heads to his car, tossing the pails of dirt aside and 
      ripping off his tux.

                                    DWIGHT
                  Not a bad custom.  I should tell the 
                  other Schrutes, something like this 
                  could really catch on.
                          (off the documentarian s 
                            look)
                  What?  Oh, give me a break.  My Aunt 
                  just died.

      He gets in his car.

                                        ACT ONE


      EXT. SCHRUTE FARMS - DWIGHT S FARM - MORNING

      Dwight, wearing funeral clothes, paces nervously on the front 
      porch, checking his watch.

      Mose, on a 1940 s German motorcycle with sidecar, wearing an 
      odd fitting suit, practices guitar, slowly picking out  Oh 
      What a Beautiful Morning  from Oklahoma.  

                                    MOSE
                          (singing)
                    There s a bright golden haze on the 
                    meadow, there s a bright golden haze 
                  on the meadow.  The corn is as high 
                  as an elephant s eye, and it looks 
                  like it s climbing clear up to the 
                  sky.

      Mose looks up at Dwight.

                                    DWIGHT
                  Let s give them time.  They requested 
                  an early check-in.

      Dwight watches the road for three seconds.  No one emerges.  
    He sighs, then begins writing on a chalkboard by the front 
      door:  Be Back In...

                                    DWIGHT (CONT D)
                          (muttering to himself)
                  Four minutes there, four minutes 
                  back, thirty seconds to lower a 
                    coffin, someone s going to want to 
                  say something...

    He continues to write:  ...11 minutes.   Then Dwight walks 
      over to Mose.

                                    DWIGHT (CONT D)
                  Get in the sidecar.

                                    MOSE
                  No.


      EXT. DIRT ROAD

      Dwight drives the motorcycle and Mose rides behind him, 
      holding Dwight s waist.  No one is in the sidecar.    "The Farm" Writers First Draft - 7/30/126.


      We hear  Oh What a Beautiful Morning  from Oklahoma as Dwight 
      and Mose pass the following:  a broken tractor on the side of 
      the road; a giant tractor wheel; a beautiful forest of trees; 
      a moose; a stray dog or coyote; a backwoods boy on a scooter 
      that s stuck in the mud; migrant farm workers, hard at work.  

                                    LYRICS
                  Oh what a beautiful morning, Oh what a 
                    beautiful day.  I ve got a beautiful feeling 
                    everything s going my way.


      EXT. CEMETERY

      Dwight and Mose now stand with other Schrutes at a small 
      family cemetery on a hill.  (Mose stands next to ZEKE, and 
      they ad lib hellos.)  Dwight notices Oscar and walks over.

                                    DWIGHT
                  What are you doing here?

                                    OSCAR
                  You invited me, you threw the red 
                  dirt in my face.

                                    DWIGHT
                  Oh, yes.
                          (enjoys the memory)
                  Thanks for coming.  But if you still 
                  can catch that personal trainer, 
                  that s fine.

                                    OSCAR
                  I was able to reschedule for this 
                    afternoon.  He had an opening.

                                    DWIGHT
                  These things are usually just family, 
                    though.

      Oscar realizes that Dwight doesn t want him there, and Oscar 
      sees a chance for revenge.

                                    OSCAR
                  I was invited, and I m staying.


      OSCAR TALKING HEAD

                                    OSCAR
                  Who knows, maybe this will make a 
                  good Shouts and Murmurs.  "The Farm" Writers First Draft - 7/30/127.


      BACK TO SCENE

      A rented Mustang drives up, way too fast.  The driver, JEB, is 
      excited to see Dwight and is waving and not paying attention 
      to where he s going.  He knocks over a gravestone and gets the 
      front corner wheel of his car stuck in the grave.  He tries to 
      back up and the wheels spin out.  He smiles.

                                    JEB
                  Look what I did!

      Oscar leans over to Dwight.

                                    OSCAR
                  Who is that?

                                    DWIGHT
                  Jeb.  My brother.

                                    OSCAR
                  You have a brother?


      EXT. CEMETERY - A LITTLE LATER

      Dwight now stands with Jeb.  (Oscar stands by Mose and Zeke.) 

                                    JEB
                  Neat shovel.

                                    DWIGHT
                  That s what everyone s saying.

                                    JEB
                  I hear they got this new shovel, 
                  makes digging easier.

                                    DWIGHT
                  That makes no sense.  It can t make 
                  dirt lighter.

                                    JEB
                    Something about the handle.

                                    DWIGHT
                  I d like to see that shovel.

                                    JEB
                  I ll send you a link to it.  "The Farm" Writers First Draft - 7/30/128.


      JEB TALKING HEAD

                                    JEB
                    There s no shovel like that.  I don t 
                  know why I said it.  And now I have 
                  to go create a whole fake web page.


      BACK TO SCENE

      Zeke is speaking by the grave.

                                    ZEKE
                  You were my cousin s Aunt.  You were 
                  five feet four inches tall for most 
                  of your life, and by the end you were 
                  five foot one.

      Zeke steps back.  Oscar looks to camera,  huh?   Mose steps 
      forward.

                                    MOSE
                  You had dark hair, and then grey 
                  hair.

      He steps back.  Oscar turns to camera, getting it now.

                                    OSCAR
                          (hushed)
                    They re a descriptive people.

      HEINRICH, the ancient brother of Shirley, steps up.

                                    HEINRICH
                  You were my sister.  And as your 
                    closest relative, the possessions 
                  that were yours now fall to me.  I 
                    suppose a thank you is in order.  If 
                    today s open house goes well -- has 
                    everyone met my realtor, David? 

    He motions to David, standing near him.

                                    HEINRICH (CONT'D)
                  -- I ll be able to leave this place

      Cameron shakes Dwight s hand extremely weakly.  Dwight is 
      openly disgusted by it, and Fannie breaks their hands apart.

      A pick-up truck pulls up and parks right by the grave.  Behind 
      the wheel is HENRY, 50 s, and in the truck bed are his five 
      daughters of various marriageable ages.  Two of them, ESTHER, 
      30, and HELENA, 23, are quite attractive.  No one gets out of 
      the truck.

                  I see Esther is back in town.

                  two chicken necks with a single 
                    motion, why use two motions?

      Dwight smiles at Esther, and Esther smiles back.  Fannie 
      notices the exchange.

      He pats the side of his truck and drives away.  Fannie shakes 
      her head.

                  Yep.

                                    MR. HASKIN
                  Yes, you received the fax?

                                    DWIGHT
                    Received, read it, memorized it, 
                  copied it and distributed it to the 
                  staff and posted it in the kitchen, 
                  and tattooed it on the cat.

    Mr. Haskin, satisfied, takes the  Irrigation  key and they 
      head to the stairs.  Mrs. Haskin turns back to Dwight.

                                    MRS. HASKIN
                  Sorry to make such a big deal about 
                  it.  It s just a fatal allergy so we 
                  have to be extra careful.

      Dwight looks caught, waits for them to turn away, then starts 
      looking frantically for a fax.  He does not find it.

      A lawyer, standing by the tv, speaks to the room.

                  Before you disperse -- I m Dipido 
                  Smith, the Schrute Family lawyer.  
                  I ve been asked by the deceased to 
                  play this short video that she made.  
                    I haven t seen it myself, so we ll 
                  see together if it s any good.

      He presses play.  AUNT SHIRLEY comes up on the tv screen.  She 
      is in bed.

                                    AUNT SHIRLEY
                  Thank you for coming to my funeral.  
                  I want you all to have a nice time.  
                  Have a drink, get something delicious 
                  to eat.

      People look around to the meager display of food -- a tray of 
      Oreos and a carton of milk.  Dwight shrugs it off.

                                    AUNT SHIRLEY (CONT D)

                  can t help wondering where it all 
                  went wrong.  You ve all disappointed 
                  me so greatly.  Fannie, a single mom!

                  I came to this country to escape the

                  you said something bad about the Jews

                    I don t want to see our place farmed 
                  by some corporation.  Cows don t even 
                  get names.  We can t just sit back 
                  and let the family farm disappear.  
                  So here are my terms.  Dwight, 
                    Fannie, Jeb, I will leave you three 
                  my farm if and only if you all come 
                  back to live here and work it, full 
                  time.  Heinrich, if they agree you 
                  get nothing, but you can stay until 
                  you die.  So there you have it, call 
                  it an angel s dying wish-

      Shirley eats, forgetting about her video.  Dwight, Fannie and

                                        ACT TWO


      INT. SCHRUTE FARMS - DWIGHT S FARM

      Fannie and Cameron are playing cards, Jeb is reading the 
      paper.  Dwight enters.

                                    DWIGHT
                  Okay, let s do this.  Let s run 
                    Shirley s farm.  We should probably 
                  start by surveying the land for beet 
                    weevils. 

      Fannie, Jeb and Cameron exchange glances.  Heinrich tries to 
      listen in on their conversation.

                                    FANNIE
                    Dwight, no way.  I m not moving back 
                  here.

                                    DWIGHT
                  Why not?

                                    FANNIE
                  Cause I hate farms, I m not a fan of 
                  the country, I like cities.  If she 
                  had left us a flat in Paris instead, 
                  well that would be something.

                          (to Jeb)
                  Can you believe this?

                    I don t want to come back here 
                    either, D.  But I also don t want to 
                  go to Paris, so, I guess thanks but 
                  no to both offers.

                  Look, we owe it to Aunt Shirley to 
                    consider it carefully.  Let s all 
                  just stay here a couple of nights, 
                  talk about it, weigh the pros and 
                  cons, and make a rational decision.

      Fannie and Jeb consider.

                    Somehow I think two nights could 
                  hurt.

                  Two nights for Shirley.  Do it.  
                  Stay.  Say yes. 4. 3. 2-yes-on-one, 
                    one-yes.

                                    FANNIE
                  That doesn t work on me.

                    Alright.

      Heinrich glares at Dwight.

      Fannie and Jeb play backgammon as Dwight, across the room, 
      prepares a tray of snacks for them (wine and cheese, etc).

                                    FANNIE
                  You don t think Dwight really thinks 
                  he can get us to stay, do you?

                                    JEB
                    I should kick his ass.

                                    FANNIE
                  Why should you kick his ass?

                                    JEB
                    I don t know.  For putting his needs 
                  in front of ours.  

                                    FANNIE
                    Alright.  But you could just say 
                  that.  Why is violence part of it?

                                    JEB
                  Maybe I meant that I would kick his 
                  ass verbally.  I would say something 
                    cutting.

                                    FANNIE
                  Is that what you meant?  "The Farm" Writers First Draft - 7/30/1221.

                  We were already talking.

                  I know what you are doing.

                                    DWIGHT
                    Really?  How could you have figured 
                  that out?  Because I said what I am 
                  doing in front of you?  Was that your 
                  clue?

                                    HEINRICH
                  The land should be mine.

                  Your brother, your sister, they don t 
                  want this land.  And you don t want 
                  it either, not really.  It s a 
                    backbreaking life.  

                                    DWIGHT
                  I know the life.

                                    HEINRICH
                  Do you?  Dwight, I saw a man s hands 
                  so tired from holding a shovel that 
                  they fell right off his arms.

                                    DWIGHT
                  No.

                                    HEINRICH
                  If you do this, you should know, I m 
                  going to kill you.

                                    DWIGHT
                  Uh huh.

      Dwight walks away with the tray, heading to Fannie s table.  
      He is intercepted by the Haskins.

                                    MR. HASKIN

                  We are wondering about the Houdini

                  Great fun.  Go there.  Anything else?

      Mr. Haskin reaches for a glass of wine but Dwight pulls the 
      tray away.

                                    MR. HASKIN
                  Let me ask you this:  Do they give 
                  away any of the tricks?

                                    DWIGHT
                    Magicians never do that.

                  But I d like to know.

                                    DWIGHT
                  Well, the guy s dead, how upset could 
                  he get if they revealed what orifice 
                  he shoved his keys into?

                  Right.  That s my concern.  Some of 
                  the tricks, I d prefer to maintain 
                  the illusion.  How am I to know which 
                  tricks they are going to give away?

                  You go outside, you get in your car, 
                  you drive there, you ask them, not 
                  me, you don t have to speak to me 
                  about this again.  Very good, then?

                  today?

                                    DWIGHT
                  Oh - tour s cancelled.

                                    MR. HASKIN
                    Cancelled?  Why?

                                    DWIGHT
                    Weather.

                                    MRS. HASKIN
                  It s a beautiful day.

                                    DWIGHT
                  Wind advisory.  One good gust could 
                  blow your head right off.

      Fannie and Jeb have overheard.

                                    JEB
                  I can give them a tour, Dwight.

                                    FANNIE
                  I ll do it with you.  It might be fun 
                  to look around after all these years.

      Dwight realizes there might be something here.

                                    DWIGHT
                  Let s all go.  "The Farm" Writers First Draft - 7/30/1224.


      DWIGHT TALKING HEAD

                                    DWIGHT
                    I usually walk into something like 
                  this with a plan, often a dastardly 
                  one.  But something underhanded will 
                  come to me, it always does.


      EXT. SCHRUTE FARMS - DWIGHT S FARM

      Dwight, Fannie and Jeb are giving their guests, the Haskins, a 
      tour.  They walk down the road.

                                    MR. HASKIN
                  Can you tell us a little about what 
                  we re seeing?

                                    DWIGHT
                  Sure.  This is the road.  We might 
                  widen it soon.
                          (For Fannie)
                    Sometimes I look around this place 
                  and I think, this is America, you 
                  know.  If only Andy Warhol could have 
                  stayed here, he d have loved it.

                                    FANNIE
                    I think he was parodying Americana.

                                    DWIGHT
                  No, I don t-- Henry David Thoreau.  
                  Jack London.  Is this a crazy 
                    thought?  The world s most 
                    sophisticated thinking takes place 
                    outdoors, in the country.

                                    MRS. HASKIN
                  I bet there s truth in that.

      Fannie looks at camera.


      EXT. FIELDS

      The group walks along an old ranch fence.

                                    JEB
                  Your fence is falling apart.

                                    DWIGHT
                  If you were here, we d fix it 
                    together.  Brothers.  "The Farm" Writers First Draft - 7/30/1225.


                                    JEB
                  We could take this older wood, carve 
                  a few holes, put in some spores, we 
                  got mushrooms in a year.  That s 
                    income.  
                          (to Haskins)
                  Leave the wood upright, so the 
                    mushrooms think they re in a tree.

                                    DWIGHT
                  That s great.  Jeb, I bet if you had 
                    a fence this simple, competing gangs 
                  would run in and steal your  crop. 

                                    JEB
                  I use chain link.

                                    DWIGHT
                  Like a prison.  Sometimes you must 
                  wonder whether it s keeping them out 
                  or you in.

                                    JEB
                  It s keeping them out.

                                    DWIGHT
                  I hear you.  Drive by shootings, 
                  you re in a scary business.

                                    FANNIE
                    Dwight, why don t you let the Haskins 
                  know about your farm s dangers.

                                    DWIGHT
                  No dangers.  You are safer than in 
                    heaven.

                                    JEB
                  Black bears.

                                    DWIGHT
                  Cute.  Harmless.

                                    FANNIE
                  Oh, so it s okay then to have food in 
                  your pockets?

                                    DWIGHT
                    Well...
                          (to Haskins)
                  Do you have food in your pockets?  "The Farm" Writers First Draft - 7/30/1226.


                                    JEB
                  Any meats, especially.

                                    MR. HASKIN
                  Are there bears around here, Dwight?

                                    FANNIE
                  Answer carefully, Dwight.  If you say 
                  no, it means we re all very safe.

                                    DWIGHT
                  Then n-

                                    FANNIE
                  But it also means you don t have much 
                    experience with bears and you re not 
                  an expert on them.

      Dwight considers for a long time.  Fannie and Jeb enjoy 
      Dwight s predicament.

                                    DWIGHT
                          (blurting)
                  We have bears!

      Fannie laughs to herself.

                                    FANNIE
                    Harmless ones, I guess.
                          (to Haskins)
                  If you see one, you can just run 
                  away.

                                    DWIGHT
                  Don t run from a bear!  Do you want 
                  to be mauled?

                                    FANNIE
                          (as she strolls along)
                  No bears in Boston.


      MONTAGE OF THE FARM TOUR

      1)  Dwight tries to open the barn door, but it is stuck.  He 
      struggles.

      2)  Dwight shows them a small slaughter house.  Fannie can t 
      believe this is part of the tour.

      3)  Dwight opens a tiny door on the side of the barn.  Hens 
      emerge and walk out and down a tiny ramp.  "The Farm" Writers First Draft - 7/30/1227.


      4)  All try to open the barn door together.  It s a struggle, 
      but they manage to open a few feet.  They cheer.


      EXT. SCHRUTE FARMS - AFTERNOON

      Dwight, Jeb, Fannie and the Haskins turn the corner and find 
      Cameron, sitting in a tree swing, wearing his blazer, reading.

                                    DWIGHT
                  Oh, hey there.  Isn t this 
                    picturesque, a boy in the wilderness, 
                  our own Huck Finn.

                                    CAMERON
                          (deep in his book)
                  You know, scholars are saying Huck 
                  Finn was based on a local  negro  
                  boy, as they were known back then.

                                    DWIGHT
                  Heh heh, right.  Cameron, have you 
                  met the Haskins?  As we say today, 
                  they are  black. 

                                    CAMERON
                  Nice to meet you.

    Mr. Haskins offers Cameron his hand.  Cameron offers his own 
    and shakes hands weakly, almost like a lady.  Dwight flinches 
    at the sight.  The others continue toward the house but Dwight 
      stays back with Cameron.

                                    DWIGHT
                  Are you trying to put me out of 
                    business?

                                    CAMERON
                  Are you sure you re in business?

                                    DWIGHT
                  That handshake, that gross wilting of 
                  your limb, it s horrifying.  Just 
                  shake hands normally.  You are not 
                  the queen.  I know that s hard for 
                  you to hear.

                                    CAMERON
                    I shake hands fine.

                                    DWIGHT
                  On this farm, we shake hands one way.  
                  And you will learn it.  
                                    (MORE)  "The Farm" Writers First Draft - 7/30/1228.

                                    DWIGHT (CONT'D)
                  Extend your hand first, before I do.  
                  It s commanding.

      Cameron extends his hand.

                                    DWIGHT (CONT D)
                  Where are you looking?  At your own 
                  hand?  Look in my eyes.

      Cameron looks up.  Dwight takes Cameron s limp hand.

                                    DWIGHT (CONT D)
                    Squeeze my hand.

                                    CAMERON
                  I am.

                                    DWIGHT
                  That s not a squeeze.  Hurt me.

                                    CAMERON
                    I don t want to hurt you.

      Dwight then notices something in the grass beneath them.  He 
      reaches down, grabs a snake, and puts it in Cameron s hand.  
      Cameron is scared.

                                    DWIGHT
                    Squeeze it to death or it will kill 
                  you.

                                    CAMERON
                  Uncle Dwight...

                                    DWIGHT
                  Kill it!

      From across the field, Fannie sees them.

                                    FANNIE
                  Oh my god!!  Cam!!

                                    CAMERON
                          (near tears)
                  What do I do?

      Cameron somehow manages to toss it to the side as Fannie runs 
    up.  She hugs Cameron.

                                    FANNIE

                  What is wrong with you?  "The Farm" Writers First Draft - 7/30/1229.


                                    DWIGHT
                  Relax, it doesn t even have fangs.

      The snake bites Dwight s boot and latches on.

                                    DWIGHT (CONT D)
                  Just a common garden snake.

      Dwight nonchalantly kicks it loose, but it won t let go.

                                    FANNIE
                    Dwight, my god, just when I thought 
                  you weren t just another -- forget 
                  it.  Forget it all.  We re leaving in 
                  the morning.

      Fannie walks Cameron back to the house.  Dwight watches her go 
      as Jeb walks up.

                                    JEB
                  She seemed mad.

                                    DWIGHT
                    A little bit.

                                    JEB
                  Hey, don t beat yourself up.  It 
                    wouldn t have mattered anyway.

                                    DWIGHT
                  What are you talking about?

                                    JEB
                    I couldn t have done it.  I ve got a 
                  good thing going in Cali.  We re 
                  going to have a killer harvest soon.   
                    I can t give it up.  I know you 
                  wanted the land.  Sorry.

      Dwight takes it in.  Jeb, nothing else to say, walks back to 
      the house, leaving Dwight in the middle of the field as he 
      realizes it s over.

                                                                          FADE TO:


      EXT. SCHRUTE FARMS - DWIGHT S FARM - 4AM

      It s dark.  We hear an alarm:  heavy metal music.  It is shut 
      off, and then a single light goes on in an upstairs room.  "The Farm" Writers First Draft - 7/30/1230.


      INT. HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER

      Shot low, we see feet emerge from a room, wearing hunting 
      socks. (We now start to hear James Taylor s acoustic version 
      of  Oh What a Beautiful Morning. )


      INT. STAIRWELL

      As the feet reveal the man, we see Dwight coming down the 
      stairs, wearing overalls and looking tired and grumpy.


      INT. SCHRUTE FARMS - MAIN ROOM

      Dwight walks to the door and begins to put his work boots on.

                                    CAMERON (O.S.)
                  What are you doing?

      REVEAL Cameron, who sits in the mostly dark room reading from 
      an tiny book light attached to his book.  Cameron is wearing 
      button down Brooks Brothers pajamas and robe, with Uggs.  
      Dwight looks him over and sighs at the sight.

                                    DWIGHT
                    Chores.  What are you doing up?

                                    CAMERON
                  It s a peaceful time to read, or 
                  muse.  What chores?

      Dwight puts on a headband flashlight.

                                    DWIGHT
                  I m not your tour guide.

      Dwight walks out.  Cameron considers, then begins to follow 
      Dwight out.  He takes a headlamp from a hook by the door.


      EXT. SCHRUTE FARMS - DWIGHT S FARM

      Dwight walks toward the barn.  Twenty feet behind him, Cameron 
      follows.


      INT. BARN

      Dwight begins to lead a goat onto a small platform, and puts 
      its head and neck in a wooden vice.  "The Farm" Writers First Draft - 7/30/1231.

                  Right.  And?

      Dwight doesn t answer.  He does a squirt into a bucket, then 
      sifts it around like wine.

                  Good strip milk?

      Dwight looks up at Cameron, and Cameron looks back at him.  
      They are lit mostly by each other s head lamp.

      INT. BARN

      Dwight now looks at nests.

                  You look.

      Dwight shoos away a hen.

                  Is it dangerous to take their eggs in

                    something, but it was a stupid 
                    question so you re going to get made 
                  fun of a little.  

      Cameron considers, then sees a nest off to the side.  He shoos 
      away a hen and collects an egg.  

                                    CAMERON

                  Mom said that nothing is as good as a 
                  fresh farm egg.

      Cameron keeps hunting for eggs, as we see that Dwight has 
      stopped in his tracks.  The wheels are spinning.

                                    DWIGHT
                  She said that, huh?


      EXT. BARN

      Dwight, now alone, is on his cell phone, on HOLD.  He speaks 
      to camera.

      INT. SCHRUTE FARMS - KITCHEN

      Dwight, Mose and Zeke cook up a storm.  (Mose is cutting up a 
      giant side of beef.)

                  Nope.

      Dwight peers into the living room, where Jeb is watching 
      television.  He looks a bit stunned.  Dwight smiles to himself 
      and continues cooking.


      INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

      Jeb is watching the news.  On TV:  DEA agents haul duffel bags 
      of marijuana onto a truck.

                  The scene was incredible, John.  The 
                    biggest raid in years, as police 
                    confiscated over six tons of 
                    marijuana. 

      We see footage of migrant workers running through the fields, 
      being pursued by DEA agents.

                  It s unknown how many workers have 
                  been detained, but officials say the 
                  land has been confiscated and the 
                  fields will be burned.

      Fannie and Cameron walk past, towards the dining room.

      Fannie and Cameron enter to find the tables set very nicely, 
      tablecloths and everything.  Fannie is surprised.  Dwight is 
      arranging a small centerpiece of flowers.

                  Oh, that sounds so authentic!

      Zeke comes in, food on a tray.  He serves the Haskins two 
      bowls of rice, and two waters.

                                    DWIGHT
                  And, as promised, a  classic  farm 
                    breakfast of rice and water.  

      The Haskins look at the food for a beat.

                                    MR. HASKIN
                  I m not sure I understand.

                                    DWIGHT
                  This is what real farmers eat.

                                    MRS. HASKIN
                  In the movies, it s biscuits and 
                  gravy, eggs and sausage...

                                    DWIGHT
                  The movies!  That is rich!  No, no, 
                  I ve never actually heard of a farmer 
                  eating those foods in real life.

      Zeke comes in again and sets down food for Fannie.  As he 
      does, Dwight narrates:

                  It s here now, okay?  Fannie, I 
                    remember how much you like bacon.

                  I have ham for you, cut in thin 
                  strips and prepared in the style of 
                  bacon.

                    Thanks, Dwight, for remembering.

                  And finally, fresh squeezed orange

                  Made in the U.S.A.

      The Haskins look at Fannie s food longingly.  Jeb enters and 
      joins Fannie s table.

                                    JEB
                  Ah, you know, I ve been thinking.  
                  Being around this place, that s what 
                  it s all about.  Maybe I ve had 
                  enough of California.  And I don t 
                  care about money.  This is home.  

                                    DWIGHT
                    I know, right?  Looks like the two of 
                  us are on board.  Too bad about 
                    Fannie.  Unless...?

                                    FANNIE
                  No.

                                    DWIGHT
                  Sure, sure.  No pressure.  Do you 
                    remember Shirley s recipe for 
                    Sauerkraut? That was a taste of 
                    growing up, huh?

                                    MR. HASKIN
                  Didn t you just say that you only had 
                  rice growing up?

                                    DWIGHT
                  Would you want me listening into one 
                  of your private conversations, sir?

                                    MR. HASKIN
                  You were standing right here.

                                    DWIGHT
                  I was facing the other way.  Eat your 
                  rice.  Yum.

                          (calling to kitchen)
                  Bring the kraut!

      Dwight takes out a photo of Aunt Shirley (a screen capture 
      from the video.)

                                    DWIGHT (CONT D)
                  Fanns, as you enjoy the sauerkraut 
                  and horseradish -- Zeke, the 
                    horseraddish -- I thought we might 
                  take a moment to speak to Aunt 
                    Shirley.

                                    FANNIE
                  Don t do this.  

                                    DWIGHT
                    Shirls...

                                    FANNIE
                  This is too soon.

                                    DWIGHT
                  I just think she has a right to hear 
                  it straight from you why you won t 
                  grant her a simple dying wish.  No 
                  big deal.  Except, yes, it is a big 
                  deal.

      Fannie stares daggers at Dwight, who slowly begins to realize 
      that this was a bad move.  After a beat, Zeke brings in Jeb s 
      breakfast.  

                                    ZEKE
                  Eggs, bacon, biscuits and steak okay?

                                    JEB
                    That ll do.

                                    MR. HASKIN
                  Oh for god sakes!

                                    MRS. HASKIN
                  Honey, you haven t even tried the 
                  rice.

      Dwight addresses the photo.

                                    DWIGHT
                  Aunt Sh, my love, I respect your 
                  dying wish, and so does Jeb -- may I 
                  speak for you?  "The Farm" Writers First Draft - 7/30/1240.


                                    JEB
                  Please do.

                                    DWIGHT
                  And so does Jeb.  But Fannie has 
                    something to say.

                                    FANNIE
                    Cameron, get in the car.

      Fannie exits.  Dwight goes after her but Mr. Haskin stops him.

                                    MR. HASKIN
                    Dwight, I was a history minor at 
                    Columbia University.  I also took a 
                    sociology class.  Where am I going 
                  with this?  I realize local cultures 
                  have their own culinary traditions- 

                                    DWIGHT
                  Eat whatever you want.

      Dwight starts putting the food from Fannie s table on the 
      Haskins  table.  (Cameron grabs the basket of muffins for 
      himself.)


      EXT. SCHRUTE FARMS - A LITTLE LATER

      Fannie puts the last suitcase in the back of the car.

                                    FANNIE
                  Come on, let s get out of here.

                                    CAMERON
                  Can I finish my pumpkin buscuit?  I 
                  can become a little nauseated when I 
                  eat while driving.

      He sits in the hatchback, holding the basket of muffins.

                                    FANNIE
                  Yeah, of course.

      Fannie sighs and joins him.  She watches Cameron eat.

                                    FANNIE (CONT D)
                  Okay, it really does seem like you 
                  are chewing extra slowly.

      She takes some of his biscuit.  "The Farm" Writers First Draft - 7/30/1241.


                                    CAMERON
                  Why do you hate it here so much?

                                    FANNIE
                  How can you even ask me that?
                  -- God, these biscuits are warm and 
                  moist -- They are a bunch of idiots.

      Cameron shrugs.

                                    FANNIE (CONT D)
                  What does that mean?

                                    CAMERON
                    They re not idiots.

      Fannie looks at his face, confused as she realizes that 
      Cameron might like it here.  But that s not enough to change 
      her mind.  She sees Dwight and Jeb approaching.

                                    FANNIE
                  Come on, we should go before our 
                    brakelines are cut.

                                    DWIGHT
                  Hey, nice car!
                          (realizing that was too 
                            much)
                  So, I just didn t think I d let you 
                  go without a proper goodbye.  And we 
                  should take a vote, of course.

                                    FANNIE
                    There s no voting, you don t get a 
                  say in my life, nice try.  

                                    DWIGHT
                    Fannie...
                          (difficult to say)
                  I need this.

                                    JEB
                          (poking into frame)
                    I could use it, I wouldn t mind it, 
                  no big deal.
                          (whisper)
                  I need it bad, Fan-Fan.

                                    FANNIE
                  I m sorry, I don t.  Cameron.  "The Farm" Writers First Draft - 7/30/1242.


      She motions to the car and gets in herself.  Cameron 
      hesitates.  Then he walks up to Dwight, looks him right in the 
      eye, and offers his hand.

      Dwight takes it, and they shake.  Cameron s grip is firm.  
      Dwight gives him a small nod of approval.  Cameron can t help 
      but seem very happy.

      Angle on Fannie, in the car, watching, her breath taken away.

      Cameron gets in the car, but Fannie doesn t drive away.  
      Dwight looks at her, unsure of what s going on.  Then she 
      looks back at him and he realizes that she just changed her 
      mind.

      Then Mr. Haskin comes stumbling out of the house, holding his 
      throat.  Mrs. Haskin runs after him, holding an Epipen.  

                                    MRS. HASKIN
                  Call 911!

      Mrs. Haskin drives the Epipen into Mr. Haskin s neck.


      EXT. HILL TOP

      Dwight, Fannie and Jeb look out over Shirley s farm -- now 
      their new farm.

                                    JEB
                  This is no nine acre worm farm.  This 
                  is a beast.  Whoever s managing this 
                  will have a hell of a job.  Not it.

                                    FANNIE
                  Not it.

                                    DWIGHT
                            (deliberate)
                  It.

      They walk to their new farm.  As they do, we reveal Heinrich, 
      just out of their view.  Heinrich takes a decent size rock, 
      zeroes in on Dwight s head, and throws with all his might.  
    The rock flies about four feet, well short of the target. (We 
      hear Ray Charles  upbeat version of  Oh What A Beautiful 
      Morning. )
