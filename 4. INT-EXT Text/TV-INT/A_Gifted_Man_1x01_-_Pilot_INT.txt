      ABSOLUTE SILENCE - broken only by the pings and beeps of the 
      respirator and monitors.  The opposite of outside.  

      A NURSE, ANESTHESIOLOGIST, SURGICAL TECH, ASSISTANT SURGEON, 
      all with eyes glued to THE CHIEF SURGEON -- MICHAEL HALSTEAD -
      - operating through a microscope.  Focused.  Intense.  

      ON A SCREEN: INSIDE BALTHUS S HEAD.  Microdissectors lift and 
      separate TISSUE and NERVES ... revealing a FRACTURE in the 
      cribriform plate (BONE).  SPINAL FLUID pours through it. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    There. 


      ON THE MONITOR: the force of the leaking fluid pushes the 
      OPTIC NERVE onto the sharp edge of the fracture.  The 
        microdissectors lift the nerve off the sharp edge of bone.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Where s my patch?

      The SURGICAL TECH is removing the PATCH TISSUE from its 
      STERILE WRAPPING as fast as he can.  Not fast enough. 

                                    MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                    That s his optic nerve.  Where s my 
                    patch?

      ON THE MONITOR: the leaking fluid pulls the optic nerve off 
      the microdissector again -- onto the sharp edge of bone.  

      ON MICHAEL as he again uses the microdissector to lift it to 
      safety.  Incredibly delicate and dangerous.

                                    MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                    That fluid keeps leaking, he dies.  
                    The nerve gets cut, he goes blind.  
                    Where s my patch?

      The Tech hands him the patch tissue.  Michael takes it with a 
      second microdissector.  

      ON BALTHUS S EXPOSED, OPEN HEAD: the instruments going in.  

      ON THE MONITOR: The second microdissector enters frame, 
      holding the patch tissue.  

      Michael sets the patch into the fracture.  Presses it in 
      place.  The fluid stops leaking.  The optic nerve settles 
      into place.  No more movement.  It s over. 


      Michael comes out of the O.R.  He s the only one out here.  
      He takes off his mask.  He takes a deep breath -- exhausted.    

      His CHIEF NURSE comes out, obviously impressed.                                                                                        3.


                                  CHIEF NURSE
                    Doctor, that was an honor to--

                                    MICHAEL
                    Fire the tech. 

      He heads down the hall, alone.


      Drifting through blurred gray shapes ... a RED BOUNCY BALL 
      with a SMILEY FACE floats eerily into frame and it BOUNCES 
      up, past the shapes (now readable as CAR BUMPERS) into open 
      space ... where it is met by a CHILLING SCREECH OF TIRES.


      Michael bolts awake, unnerved.  He moves the wine glass and 
      Percocet on his nightstand to see the time: 4:12.  Sits up.


      Michael s assistant, RITA (50 s; don t cross her) doesn t 
      look up from her computer when she hears Michael coming. 

                                  RITA
                    I need signatures. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    How s Balthus?

                                  RITA 
                    Stable and a pain in the ass. 

      He heads into his office.  She follows with a PILE OF PAPERS. 


      Huge.  Swanky.  On three walls: tons of SPORTS MEMORABILIA, 
      all SIGNED WITH THANKS. On the fourth: a TROPHY CASE full of 
      SAILING TROPHIES.  PHOTOS of Michael on his own sleek boat.                                                                                      4.


                                  RITA 
                    You ve got an 8AM staff meeting, 
                    then the two back-to-back gliomas.

      Michael opens the closet for his lab coat.  Rita blocks his 
      way with the papers and a pen.  He signs where she points. 

                                  RITA (CONT'D)
                    Madeline needs fifteen minutes --

                                    MICHAEL
                    Put her in at lunch --

                                  RITA
                    Can t.  You ll be in Agoura, doing 
                    a consult with Lacey Sandreski.

      He knows the name.  He s done signing.  She hands him a file.  

                                  RITA (CONT'D)
                    Her father wouldn t say why.  Just 
                    that they need to see you asap.

      He opens the file.  Clippings.   An SI COVER of a pony-tailed 
      teenager kissing the Wimbledon Trophy:  AMAZING LACE! 

                                    MICHAEL
                    She s perky. 

      She hands him his lab coat.  He heads out.  Rita follows. 


      He heads down the hall, checking his BlackBerry.  Rita 
      follows.  OTHER DOCTORS are heading the same direction. 

                                  RITA
                    One more thing.  It s my birthday. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    Again?

                                  RITA
                    Once a year, like everyone else.  
                    Len s taking me to Spago.  I m 
                    leaving at six. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    Spago s overrated.  

      Michael sees STEVE LIONETTI, (professional psychiatrist, 
      amateur triathlete) entering the Conference Room.                                                                                        5.


                                    MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                    Oh, hey -- recurring dreams.

                                  STEVE
                    Yeah?

                                    MICHAEL 
                    I m having one.  The same thing 
                    every god damn night, this red 
                    ball.  What do red balls mean?

                                  STEVE
                      Seriously?  You re handing me that?

      MADELINE RESNICK -- late 30 s, dark and stylish (not in a 
      medical jacket), heads for the Conference Room too.  

                                  MADELINE
                    I need fifteen minutes. 

                                  RITA
                    I told him. 

      They head into the conference room, leaving Rita in the hall. 

                                  RITA (CONT'D)
                     Happy Birthday, Rita.    Why, 
                    thank you, Michael. 


      CLOSE ON A SCREEN: Michael, giving a press conference.  

                                    MICHAEL (ON THE SCREEN)
                    He s up, he s talking.  It ll take 
                    longer for the arm and shoulder to 
                    heal than the cranial fracture.  

      RON BALTHUS, in SILK PAJAMAS, is watching it on his iPad.  An 
      arm and shoulder are in a cast, a BANDAGE at his hairline.  
      His assistant RANDY (30 s), is making coffee in a French 
      press.  Michael enters.

                                    MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                    Making yourself at home, huh?  
                    Morning, Randy. 

                                  RANDY
                    Good morning, Dr. Halstead. 

                                  RON
                    Your sheets are dreadful.  Where 
                    have you been?  I ve been calling 
                    for you for hours.                                                                                       6.


                                    MICHAEL
                    Believe it or not, Ronny, you are 
                    not my only patient.  Look at me. 

                                  RON
                    For what I m paying, I should own 
                    you for the day. 

                                    MICHAEL
                          (checking Ron s eyes)
                    You re confusing me with one of 
                    your hookers.  Any flashes of light 
                    in the eyes?  

                                  RON
                    No. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    Salty taste in your mouth?  Fluid 
                    in the back of your nose?  

                                  RON
                    No and no.  When can I go home?  

                                    MICHAEL
                    That depends.  What are you going 
                    to do when you get there?

                                  RANDY
                    What can he do?

                                    MICHAEL
                    Nothing.   No driving, no drinking, 
                    no drugs, no sex, no work. Nothing.  

                                  RANDY
                    For how long?

                                    MICHAEL
                    Two weeks.  

                                  RON
                    Jesus Christ.  

                                    MICHAEL 
                    Listen.  You were minutes away from 
                    losing your life, seconds from 
                    losing your sight.  I know you like 
                    to think you re the cat with nine 
                    lives -- but you re not.  You get 
                    one.  And if you knock that patch 
                    loose before the bone is healed, 
                    you ll lose it.  Plain and simple.  
                    Got it?                                                                                         7.


      Balthus looks at him, scared a little straight. 

                                  RANDY
                    We ve got it. 


      ON A COMPUTER SCREEN: images of a CT SCAN with a CLOUDY AREA.  

      IN THE B.G.: the SOUND of GROUND STROKES being hit in a 
      steady rhythm, with simultaneous HIGH-PITCHED GRUNTS.

                                    MICHAEL (O.C.)
                    When was the accident?

      WIDEN to see the windows look out on a TENNIS COURT, where 
      Lacey is slugging it out.  Around the room: mock-ups for Nike 
      posters of Lacey.  Nike outfit prototypes.  Shoe boxes.  

      Michael is checking the CT images on the laptop of ARNOLD 
      LOBELL (MD, a older than Michael, less well-dressed).  Milt 
      and JILL SANDRESKI (40 s blonde, skittish) are there too.

                                  JILL
                      Yesterday.  I was driving --

                                  MILT
                    Jill was driving, Lacey was in the 
                    passenger seat, some numb-nuts in 
                    front of them slams on the brakes --

                                    MICHAEL
                    And Lacey hit her forehead?

                                  JILL
                    She might have, I couldn t tell --

                                  MILT
                    She wasn t paying attention.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    What did Lacey say?

                                  DR. LOBELL
                    She said no, but I ve been her 
                    doctor since she was 11.  She 
                    wouldn t admit it if she had.  I 
                    ran a CT, to rule out concussion.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    Which you have.  But --

      Michael scans the images again, enlarging the shady area.                                                                                        9.


                                  MILT
                    Lobell says it might be an 
                    aneurysm.  What do you think?

                                    MICHAEL
                    I agree.  It might be.  

                                  MILT 
                    But you can t tell?  

                                    MICHAEL
                    Not without running a CTA.

                                  JILL
                    I m sorry, I think I know what an 
                    aneurysm, is, but can you --

                                  MILT
                    What s a CTA?

      Michael does an instant calculation on whom to answer first.  

                                    MICHAEL
                          (to Milt)
                    More images, with a contrast agent.
                          (then, to Jill)
                    An aneurysm is when the wall of an 
                    artery expands out like a balloon.

                                  JILL
                    And the danger with that is --

                                  MILT
                    How long s it take?  We re 
                    training. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    45 minutes.  I ll work around your 
                    schedule.  I can meet you any time.
                          (Jill)
                    The bulge weakens the wall, which 
                    makes it vulnerable to rupture. 

                                  JILL
                    You mean -- like a stroke, or --

                                  MILT
                    Jillian.  We re trying to work 
                    something out here. 

      The barely-perceptible smackdown shuts Jill up.  Michael 
      takes out a card.  Writes on it.                                                                                     10.


                                    MICHAEL
                    Rita s my secretary.  Tell her what 
                    works for you, and that s what 
                    we ll do.  This my cell.
                          (hands it over)
                    Tell Lacey I look forward to 
                    meeting her. 


      Late.  Michael is working at his desk.  Quiet.  Then he HEARS 
      a BOUNCING NOISE out in the hallway, and sees, out of the 
      corner of his eye: something RED fly by the door.  Strange.  


      Michael comes out of his office, a little tentatively -- 

                                    MICHAEL
                    Hello?

      No one.  Just Rita s SILVER BIRTHDAY BALLOONS, waving back 
      and forth, as if by a breeze.  Very, very strange.

                                    ITALIAN VOICE (O.S.)
                    Buona sera, Giorgio Baldi.


      Michael grabs his dinner, gives the Hostess a kiss that hints 
      at past intimacy.  Greets a few diners, then heads out.  


      Michael is waiting, pissed off, in a room full of PEOPLE who 
      are much more used to arrests than he is.  Not his crowd.

      A BUZZ as a door opens and an OFFICER escorts MILO CANTONI 
      out: 17, droopy skinny jeans, hoodie.  Milo waves ironically.


      Michael (irritated as hell) drives Milo up the 101.  

                                  MILO
                    It s total police abuse.  All I do 
                    is meet some kid at the skate park.  
                    And he says, hey, we re rolling to 
                    our neighborhood, you want to come? 

                                    MICHAEL
                    So you follow a gang kid to his 
                      neighborhood, at night?  Christ, 
                    Milo, what are you thinking?

                                  MILO
                    Oh, I don t know, that I m not 
                      prejudiced about where people live?  
                    And then the cops come in like the 
                    Gestapo:  On the ground!   Nazis.

                                    MICHAEL 
                    It s a gang sweep, and you re lucky 
                    it s all that happened to you. 

                                  MILO
                    What are you, on their payroll?

                                    MICHAEL
                    If you didn t want my opinion, you 
                    should ve called your mother.

                                  MILO
                    I needed a ride.  Her car s busted.                                                                                      16.


                                    MICHAEL
                    Again?


      Shabby, minus the chic.  Lots of crystals and candles.  DIDI 
      HALSTEAD (37, huge heart, unfocused, overwhelmed), in 
      pajamas.  She and Michael watch Milo scuff to his bedroom.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    You and I had a curfew growing up.  
                    Remember?

      He takes out his wallet, starts counting out money.

                                  DIDI
                    He s got forty pounds on me.  What 
                    am I supposed to do, handcuff him 
                    to the radiator?
                          (sees the money)
                    What s that?

                                    MICHAEL
                    He said your car s messed up.

                                  DIDI
                    I didn t ask you to fix it. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    How much do you need?

                                  DIDI
                          (after a beat)
                    Nine hundred. 

      He hands it to her.  She takes it. 

                                  DIDI (CONT'D)
                    Thank you, Michael. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    You re welcome, Didi. 
                          (starts to leave, then:)
                    Oh, hey -- guess who I had dinner 
                    with tonight.  

                                  DIDI
                    Obama?

                                    MICHAEL
                    Anna.

                                  DIDI
                    Lindberg?                                                                                    17.


                                    MICHAEL
                    Yup.  

                                  DIDI
                    No way.  How is she?

                                    MICHAEL
                    She s great.  Beautiful, funny.

                                  DIDI
                      Remarried?

                                    MICHAEL
                    Nope.  

                                  DIDI
                      Interesting.  You know -- the only 
                    time you weren t a jerk was when 
                    you were with her.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    Nice.  Thanks. 
                          (leaving for real now)
                    Work it out with your son.  He s 
                    going off the rails.  


      Michael is waiting when Milt, Jill and Lacey show up.  Lacey 
      shakes Michael s hand and gives him the million-dollar smile.  

                                  LACEY
                    Dr. Halstead, I m Lacey Sandreski.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Nice to meet you.  Come on back.    

      Michael leads Lacey in.  Milt starts follow.  

                                    MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                    Just Lacey.  Radiation.  


      Lacey is lying on the CT scan table.  ELENA, the RADIOLOGY 
      TECH preps her arm for the IV.  Michael is standing nearby.

                                    MICHAEL 
                    You cold?  Need anything?                                                                                    18.


                                  LACEY
                    Nope, totally fine. 

      She flashes her PR smile while Elena inserts the IV port.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    Lacey?  Do me a favor, will you?  
                    Don t smile so much.  

                                  LACEY 
                    I beg your pardon?

      He sits in a chair, so he can talk to her at eye level. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    Here s what nobody knows about you: 
                    You re not perky at all.  You can 
                    be -- and why not, there s good 
                    money there -- but that s who you 
                    pretend to be, not who you are.  

      She doesn t deny it.  A steeliness appears in her eyes. 

                                    MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                    Here, in my office, no pretending.  
                    Bullshit takes energy.  And to do 
                    what you re trying to do -- what no 
                    woman has done before -- you re 
                    going to need every ounce of energy 
                    your body can muster.  So save it.  
                    Do not waste it on me.  

      Michael takes the solution from Elena.  Connects it to 
      Lacey s IV port himself.  

                                    MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                    People have no idea what it takes.  
                    They want to turn on SportsCenter 
                    and see greatness there, day after 
                    day -- but they don t want to know 
                    what that costs.  In time.  In 
                    energy.  In will.  The human toll.  
                    I know the cost.  I know that being 
                    the best isn t part of your life.  
                    It s instead of it.  
                          (starts the drip)
                    And that -- is fine -- with me. 


      Michael working at his computer.  Rita is cleaning his lunch 
      dishes from his desk.  As she picks them up and heads out:                                                                                    19.


                                    MICHAEL 
                    Hey -- there s a clinic, in East 
                    L.A., I think, called Para Todos. 
                    Get them on the line, okay?

      She continues out.  Michael leans back in his chair, 
      ruminating -- remembering ...  The phone BEEPS.  Michael 
      picks it up.  It s RINGING.  Then a WOMAN picks up. 

                                  PARA TODOS PERSON (OVER PHONE)
                    Para Todos.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Dr. Anna Lindberg, please. 

                                  PARA TODOS PERSON (OVER PHONE)
                    May I ask who s calling?

                                    MICHAEL
                    This is Dr. Michael Halstead.  

      A pause.  Then:

                                  PARA TODOS PERSON (OVER PHONE)
                    I m sorry to tell you this, Dr. 
                    Halstead, but Dr. Lindberg passed 
                    away two weeks ago.  


                                    END OF TEASER                                                                                    20.


                                        ACT ONE


      Michael is at his desk, phone in hand, trying to digest what 
      he just heard.  Baffled.  He doesn t notice CTA RESULTS pop 
      up on his screen. 

                                  RITA (O.S.)
                    That s Lacey Sandreski s CTA.

      He doesn t even look.  His mind is reeling.  Rita comes in.   

                                  RITA (CONT'D)
                    Want me to get them on the line?

      He looks at the screen.  The images focus him.  He clicks 
      through them.  Doesn t like what he sees. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    No. 

      He gets up.  She hands him his keys and laptop. He heads out, 
      then stops, turns to her.  Confusion swimming in his head.

                                    MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                    Look up a doctor for me.  Anna 
                    Lindberg.  Would be local.  L.A.  


      ON MICHAEL S LAPTOP, where Lacey s CTA shows an ANEURYSM.

                                    MICHAEL
                    It s 18 millimeters, in your middle 
                    cerebral artery distribution.
                          (to Lacey)
                    Have you been having any vision 
                    problems lately?  Eye pain?  

                                  LACEY
                    Nope.  

                                    MICHAEL
                      Headaches?

                                  MILT
                    She said no.  

      Actually she didn t, but Michael isn t going to take Milt on.                                                                                     21.


                                    MICHAEL
                    Okay.  You have two options.  One: 
                    we bring you in today, I coil the 
                    aneurysm, and we re done.  No way 
                    this thing will ever harm you.  The 
                    downside: no tennis for 3 months.  

      Lacey scoffs -- what?

                                  MILT
                    Option two?

                                    MICHAEL
                    We do it after the Open.  It is a 
                    risk, a small one: an asymptomatic 
                    aneurysm has a 1.3 percent chance 
                    of rupture per year.   

                                  JILL
                    What if you re in that 1.3 percent?

                                    MICHAEL
                    25 percent survival rate, mostly 
                    depending on how quickly you re 
                    treated.  So obviously, if you get 
                    any symptoms of a leak: headache, 
                    eye pain, vision impairment -- you 
                    would call me immediately.  

      Jill inhales, to ask another question, but Lacey is quicker. 

                                  LACEY 
                    Tell you what.  I ll go to New York 
                    and make history.  Afterwards, we 
                    can all celebrate by having you cut 
                    my head open.  How s that sound?

      Milt clamps his hands on Lacey s shoulders, rubs them hard.

                                  MILT
                    Sounds like a plan.


      Michael swoops back through, scrolling the BlackBerry.  

                                  RITA
                    Balthus went home with a nurse. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    Good.                                                                                     22.


                                  RITA
                    Madeline still needs fifteen 
                    minutes. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    Right.    

                                  RITA
                    Here s what I got on that doctor.

      She hands him some PRINT-OUTS.  He stops, looks at them. 

      The first one: An L.A. TIMES OBITUARY: ANNA LINDBERG, BROUGHT 
      MEDICINE TO HARD-HIT BOYLE HEIGHTS.  With a picture of Anna. 

      Michael stares at it, frozen. 

                                  RITA (CONT'D)
                    Oh, and your sister s in there.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    What?


      Michael enters, holding the print-out.  Didi is there, 
      relaxing on his sofa in her Whole Foods uniform: slacks, logo 
      shirt, name tag.  Her Whole Foods apron is on the sofa beside 
      her.  

                                  DIDI
                    I just need a couple minutes.  

      He goes behind his desk, kicks his computer to life.  

                                  DIDI (CONT'D)
                    I ve been thinking about what you 
                    said, about Milo --

                                    MICHAEL
                    Good. 

                                  DIDI 
                    I know this woman, she s a family 
                    therapist -- she said she d work 
                    with us for free. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    I m sure Milo will love that.

                                  DIDI
                    And she said the sessions would 
                    probably go better if the primary 
                    male in his life was there, too.                                                                                     23.


      Michael looks up at her.  Sees where this is going.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    Didi, there is no way I am going to 
                    therapy with you and your messed-up 
                    son.  No.  

                                  DIDI
                    Come on, Michael, please?

                                    MICHAEL
                    No.  He s not my problem.  He s 
                    your problem.  You deal with it.   

      He goes back to work.  

                                  DIDI
                    You re a jerk. 

      She grabs her bag off the desk, intending to huff out.  But 
      then she spots the OBITUARY on his desk.  Picks it up.

                                  DIDI (CONT'D)
                    What is this?

      He sees, tries to grab it from her -- but not fast enough.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Nothing. 

      She reads the headline.  Tears spring to her eyes (as they 
      do, often and easily). 

                                  DIDI 
                    Oh my God.  Anna.

      Michael snatches the print-out from her. 

                                    MICHAEL 
                    You need to leave. 

                                  DIDI
                    But wait -- I don t get it.  You 
                    said you had dinner with her.

                                    MICHAEL
                    I didn t have dinner with anyone. 

                                  DIDI
                    You just told me, just last night --                                                                                     24.


                                    MICHAEL
                          (how he s worked it out)
                    Last night, I took a Percocet for 
                    my shoulder, plus wine --

                                  DIDI
                    Wait, hang on --

                                    MICHAEL 
                    And then your idiot son wakes me 
                    out of a dream I m having about my 
                    ex-wife -- 

                                  DIDI
                    That was not a dream you were 
                    talking about -- 

                                    MICHAEL
                    -- such a vivid dream that I -- 
                      mistakenly -- thought it was real.

                                  DIDI
                    Michael, you said you saw her.  You 
                    talked to her.

                                    MICHAEL
                    No -- you re -- no.  

      He s never been so inarticulate.  He sits down to work.  Didi 
      stares at him -- then realizes:

                                  DIDI
                    Maybe her spirit came to you.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Rita!

                                  DIDI
                    People do that when they die.  You 
                    read about it all the time.  It s 
                    called ... oh, what s it called?  
                    It s called something.  

      Rita pops her head in the door. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    My sister needs to stack some 
                    produce.  Help her find the door.

      Didi makes her own way out.  

                                  DIDI
                    This is a cosmic gift, Michael.                                                                                      25.


      He grabs a SIGNED LUC ROBATAILLE HOCKEY STICK and uses it to 
      shut the door in her face. 


      Michael is talking on speakerphone, massaging his shoulder.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    You re taking it easy?  None of 
                    your bear parties?

                                    BALTHUS (ON SPEAKERPHONE)
                    Darling, I m the dullest man in LA.  

      A KNOCK.  He looks: Madeline is there.  He waves her in.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Good.  Let s keep it that way.  

      Michael shuts the call off.  Madeline enters. 

                                    MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                    You need fifteen minutes.  

                                  MADELINE
                    I got the bids for upgrading our 
                    Physical Therapy facility.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    And?

                                  MADELINE
                    Bottom line, we can t afford it. 

                                    MICHAEL 
                    What do we do, take out a loan?

                                  MADELINE
                    We could.  But I d rather wait till 
                    we can pay for it outright.  Why 
                    take on debt if we don t need to?

                                    MICHAEL
                    Because I want to be able to say, 
                    not only are we the best surgical 
                    center, we re also the best rehab 
                    facility.  And I want to say it 
                    now. 

      She moves toward him. 

                                  MADELINE
                    Your impatience is very alluring.                                                                                     26.


      She straddles him in the chair.  He runs a hand up her back. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    What do we do?  Put off deciding?

                                  MADELINE
                    At least a few minutes. 

      She kisses him.  He starts undoing her blouse.  


      Michael s in his chair, in post-coital relaxation.  Pants 
      back on, shirt undone, holding Madeline s blouse.  He s 
      peering into his bathroom, where she s tidying up.

                                    MICHAEL
                    We need better sheets in post-op.   

                                  MADELINE
                    Done. 

      She comes out, fully dressed except for her shirt.  She goes 
      to take it from him.   Slips it on.  Buttons it up.   

                                    MICHAEL
                    You in a rush?

                                  MADELINE
                    My mother s in town.  

      She bends down and kisses him.  

                                    MICHAEL 
                    Hang on, I ll walk you out. 


      Michael wanders back into his office ... then leaps out of 
      his skin when he sees ANNA, in the chair he was just in.  

                                  ANNA
                    Sorry.  Did I scare you?

      Michael takes a step back.  

                                  ANNA (CONT'D)
                    Don t freak out.  Okay?                                                                                    27.


      Then he notices, at her feet: THE RED BOUNCY BALL WITH THE 
      SMILEY FACE FROM HIS RECURRING DREAM. 

                                    MICHAEL 
                    What -- the -- 

                                  ANNA
                          (explaining carefully)
                    Two weeks ago, I went for a run.  
                    It was dusk.  Some kids were 
                    playing.  Their ball bounced into 
                    the street.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    Stop.    

                                  ANNA
                    I tried to get it for them.  I 
                    thought I looked, but I guess --

                                    MICHAEL
                    I mean it.  Stop.  Talking. 

                                  ANNA
                    I didn t see the car at all.  My 
                    head hit the pavement.  It all 
                    happened really fast.  I don t 
                    remember if it was painful.  
                          (the ball)
                    The ball came with me.  Why, I have 
                    no idea.  

      He looks again at the ball from his dreams, shakes his head, 
      wanting no part of this.  Backs out of the room.  


      Michael leans against Rita s desk, hyperventilating.  After 
      some forced deep breaths, he looks back into his office.  The 
      door is blocking his view of the chair.  He kicks it open so 
      he can see in.  Anna s still there, standing now.  

                                  ANNA
                    I won t hurt you, Michael.  I don t 
                    even think I can.  

      He doesn t go in.  So she takes a step toward him.  

                                  ANNA (CONT'D)
                    I know, it s weird.  That s why I 
                    didn t tell you last night.  Are 
                    you okay?

      A weird panicky laugh comes out of him.  No, he s not okay.                                                                                      28.


                                  ANNA (CONT'D)
                    I need your help.  Are you 
                      listening?  Can you pay attention? 

      He s not answering, but not leaving.  Good enough for her. 

                                  ANNA (CONT'D)
                    People counted on me.  I was 
                    stupid, I didn t anticipate this -- 
                    I did everything myself, I didn t 
                    train anyone.  I m sure the staff 
                    is completely derailed.  Are you 
                    with me?

      He s still staring.  So he s not not with her.  

                                  ANNA (CONT'D)
                    If they can get into my computer 
                    files, they ll be able to figure it 
                    out.  I need you to go down there 
                    and unlock them.  My password is 
                    the same as it s always been.  You 
                    remember it? 
                          (a beat)
                    MYMIKE.  M-Y.  M-I-K-E.  

      At that, tears inexplicably spring to his eyes.  She sees.  
      Can t handle the deep well of regret and sadness right now. 

                                  ANNA (CONT'D)
                    Don t.  Please. 
                          (then)
                    I didn t have a family.  I didn t 
                    have kids.  I didn t have hobbies.  
                    I had this.  Do this for me.  

      And then, the whole thing overwhelms his system -- he doubles 
      over and vomits into the trash can.  

      When he s done heaving, he stands.  She s gone.


      A CUSTODIAN is mopping.  Michael comes out, looking around.  
      Sweaty.  A mess.  Shirt still undone.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    Where d she go?

                                  CUSTODIAN
                    Who?

      The guy clearly hasn t seen anyone.                                                                                      29.



      ON THE COMPUTER, as Michael scans resources for

      Michael s hands shake on the keyboard and scrawl notes on a 
      pad:  BLEEDING BR. TUMOR ... SCHIZOPH. ... SUBDURAL HEM. ... 
        INFECTION??? ... WITHDRAWAL?? ... RX SIDE FX?? 

                                  RITA (O.S.)
                    Michael?

      MORNING.  Michael is at his desk, in last night s clothes, 
      unstrung.  Rita is in his doorway, staring at him.

                                  RITA (CONT'D)
                    Dr. Sujishi wants you in on his 8AM 
                    consult .  
                          (Michael doesn t move)
                    That s in 20 minutes.  You might 
                    want to --

      She points at his clothes.  Right.  Michael gets up.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Book me for an MRI this morning.

                                  RITA
                    Why?  Is something wrong?

                                    MICHAEL
                    It s my own god damn machine, Rita, 
                    if I want to use it, I don t need 
                    your permission. 

      He goes into his bathroom, starts the shower.  


        Post-shower, towel around his waist.  Michael looks hard in 
      the mirror.  Trying to get a grip.  Then he steps out into:


      There s Didi again, this time with ANTON LITTLE CREEK: 30 s, 
      100% Anglo, in full Traditional Healer, poncho-moccasin garb.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    Jesus Christ!

                                  DIDI
                    Michael, remember Anton Little 
                    Creek?  We dated a few years ago?  

      Anton steps forward, hand out to shake.                                                                                     30.


                                  ANTON
                    Peace. 

      Michael stares -- you ve got to be kidding me -- and tightens 
      the towel around his waist.

                                  DIDI
                    Anton s a shaman.  I told him about 
                    the Anna thing, and he immediately 
                    knew what it was all about. 

                                  ANTON
                    Yeah, attachments like the one Didi 
                    described aren t at all unusual.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    Get out.  

                                  ANTON 
                    For whatever reason, the person 
                    feels safer holding onto someone in 
                    this world than moving on to the 
                    next. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    Out.

                                  ANTON
                    I can extract her if you want.  
                    It s not a big deal.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Why is he still talking?  Rita!

                                  DIDI
                    Okay, he s getting mad.  
                          (to Michael)
                    Don t worry, we re leaving.  

      She pushes Anton out the door.


      ON ELENA, a nervous wreck, looking at Michael s legs sticking 
      out of the MRI machine.

                                  ELENA
                      A reminder, Doctor, not to move or -

                                    MICHAEL (O.C.)
                    I know how the machine works. 

                                  ELENA
                    Yes, doctor.                                                                                    31.


      She leaves the room.  

      IN THE MACHINE:

      Michael is on his back, head in the immobilizer.  The 
      CLICKING NOISES start.  Michael closes his eyes during the 
      test.  CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK.  When it finally stops:

                                  ANNA (O.C.)
                    You didn t go. 

      Michael s eyes pop open.  He can t move his head, but he can 
      move his eyes enough to see Anna lying beside him, propped on 
      an elbow.  Angry.  

                                  ANNA (CONT'D)
                    I ask you to do one simple thing. 
                    The one thing that matters to me --

      He detaches the immobilizing device.  Turns to look at Anna.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    Go -- away -- 

      IN THE ROOM, the DOOR opens, and Elena rushes in (she can 
      only see one set of legs coming out of the machine).

                                  ELENA
                    Dr. Halstead?  Are you all right?

      IN THE MACHINE, Michael has his wits about him enough to 
      realize how this looks.  Calls to Elena:

                                    MICHAEL
                    I m fine! 

                                  ELENA (O.C.)
                    Um -- would you like to wait in 
                    there while I check the images?  

      Anna is giving Michael a hard, unforgiving glare.

                                  ANNA
                    You were the one person I thought I 
                    could count on.  

      Shit.  Michael can t believe he s saying it, but:

                                    MICHAEL
                          (to Elena)
                    No.  Get me out.                                                                                     32.



      Michael, driving through East L.A., simmering.  

                                    MICHAEL 
                          (to himself)
                    What the hell are you doing ...


      ... and steps into another world.  The floors are dirty; the 
      trash hasn t been dumped; and the clinic is PACKED WITH 
      PATIENTS.  There are few chairs, so the sickest are on the 
      floor.  The rest are standing, in a swarm of illness.    

      Michael stands at the door, staring.  In disbelief.


                                  END OF ACT ONE                                                                                    33.


                                        ACT TWO


      Michael takes it in.  Then he sees the MAIN DESK, where an 
      overwhelmed volunteer, TAVO, is fielding a million questions.  
      More Spanish.  Michael makes his way over.  Still not 100 
      percent sure what he s doing here.  He addresses Tavo. 

                                    MICHAEL
                          (how to put this?)
                    Hey.  Um ... I think I might need 
                    to get on your computers. 

                                  TAVO
                    Finally, man.  I called you guys 
                    days ago.  I thought Geek Squad was 
                    supposed to be fast.  It s in here. 

      What?  Tavo heads back to the office.  Michael follows.  


      Michael follows Tavo in.  Tavo points to the computer. 

                                  TAVO 
                    There you go.

      Michael sits at it.  It s open to the ACCOUNTS page.  There s 
      only one: ANNA L.  And a space for PASSWORD.  

                                  TAVO (CONT'D)
                    We just lost our director.  Totally 
                    sucked.  Plus she ran everything 
                    here -- booked docs, got funding, 
                    paid bills -- everything.  We ve 
                    been trying to keep it going, but 
                    without her ... 
                          (hopeless)
                    I don t know, I figured if I could 
                    maybe get at her files ...  

      ON MICHAEL S HANDS, as he types: M-Y-M-I-K ... E.

      ON THE COMPUTER, as the page opens.  So it really is real. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    Oh ... Christ.  

                                  TAVO 
                    What?  No luck?
                          (then, seeing it worked)
                    Oh, no, man, we re good!  You got 
                    it!  Geek Squad to the rescue.                                                                                      34.


      Michael stands.  Tavo sits in the chair and starts typing.  


      Michael comes into the room and stops -- trying to process.  

      Nearby, a scared mother, INES (30 s, panicky, surrounded by 
      FIVE KIDS), is talking to AUTUMN (late 20 s, tough as jerky, 
      clipboard in her hand and COUNTY ID around her neck).

                                  INES
                    Please, you need to see my son --

      She s holding one of the kids close to her -- ERNESTO, 7, in 
      a soccer uniform.  He looks exhausted and disoriented.  

                                  AUTUMN
                    Ma am, I m just a social worker.  
                    There are no doctors here today.  

      Ines gets more distressed at that news.  Overwhelmed. 

                                  AUTUMN (CONT'D)
                    Don t panic.  Just tell me what 
                    happened, and I ll help you figure 
                    out what to do.

                                  INES
                    He was playing soccer, he was fine, 
                    then he was on the ground, and he 
                    start to shake, and his eyes went --
                          (rolled back)
                    -- like this --

      Autumn, competent but out of her depth, checks her clipboard.

                                  AUTUMN
                    Okay, what I m gonna do is find you 
                    the nearest emergency room.

      ON MICHAEL, hearing all this.  It s not the right call.  He 
      ponders leaving it, but can t quite.  Steps over. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    Don t send her to an E.R.  The kid 
                    had a seizure.  He needs a CT.  An 
                    E.R. s gonna make her wait ten 
                    hours, then won t end up doing it 
                    because you don t have insurance. 
                          (to Ines)
                    Go to an imaging center and ask for 
                    a CT Scan.  C.T.  

      There.  Done.  He heads back toward the door.                                                                                     35.


                                  INES
                            (bewildered, to Autumn)
                    What is the imaging center?

      Fuck if Autumn knows.  She follows Michael. 

                                  AUTUMN
                    Whoa.  Hang on.  Who are you?

                                    MICHAEL
                    I m a neurosurgeon, I don t work 
                    here.  

                                  AUTUMN
                    So where s an imaging center? 

                                    MICHAEL
                    I don t know.  Google it.    

                                  AUTUMN
                    What place do you use?  

                                    MICHAEL
                    That wouldn t work.  I m sure 
                    there s one closer.  Look it up.  

                                  AUTUMN
                    Why wouldn t yours work? 

                                    MICHAEL
                    Because. 

                                  AUTUMN
                       Because ?  What are you, twelve?  

      Told you she was tough.  Michael looks from Autumn (calling 
      him out) to Ines (terrified).

                                  AUTUMN (CONT'D)
                    Man, I ve got 100 sick people here.  
                    I m asking for help with one.   

        Capitulation is clearly the path of least resistance here. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    Fine.  Come by.  I ll run the test. 

      He hands Ines his card.  She looks at it.  

                                  INES
                    Excuse me, which bus goes to here?

      Oh, for Christ s sake.                                                                                     36.



      Ines is in the passenger seat, with Ernesto in her lap.  The 
      other kids are in back, laughing, giddy.  Best field trip of 
      their lives.  Michael is at the wheel, furious.   


      PATIENTS waiting: some fancy older people; a very tall, 
        expensively-dressed PRO BASKETBALL PLAYER, with TRAINER.  

      Michael enters, with Ines and the five rambunctious kids.  He 
      pauses to say hi to the Basketball Player (he clearly knows 
      him), then ushers Ines and the kids into the offices.


      Michael gets to Rita s desk just ahead of the brood. 

                                  RITA
                    You missed three patients, I ve had 
                    more people yell at me in --

      Then she spots the pack of kids.  She looks at Michael: ????? 

                                    MICHAEL
                          (points to Ernesto)
                    Needs a CT.  The rest, hide 
                      somewhere. 

      He heads into his office, but Ines follows him in, taking 
      full advantage of the first doctor she s seen in years.

                                  INES
                    Doctor --


      Michael picks up the phone to dial, but Ines is in his face. 

                                  INES
                    The little one, my niece, she has a 
                    nose it s running, did you see?

                                    MICHAEL
                    Get her some tissues. 

      He dials his phone.  But Ines isn t finished.

                                  INES
                    And my other son, the big boy, 
                    Robert, his says his feet tingle --                                                                                    37.


                                    MICHAEL
                    Try shoes that fit.  Rita!

                                  INES
                    Also my nephew, he goes like this -
                          (squints)
                    -- at the TV all the time. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    I m not an optometrist.  Rita! 

      Rita pops in, takes Ines by the arm and escorts her out.


      Jill, now in Michael s office, with him.  

                                  JILL
                    I want you to make her do the 
                    surgery. 

      Unused to asserting herself, she s almost apologetic.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Lacey s an adult, Jill.  I can t 
                    make her do anything. 

                                  JILL
                    But she respects you.  If you tell 
                    her she has to do it --

                                    MICHAEL
                    She doesn t. 

                                  JILL
                          (icing up)
                    Fine.  If you won t insist on it, 
                    I ll find a doctor who will.                                                                                      38.


                                    MICHAEL
                    That s fine.  But I d bet my last 
                    dime there isn t a doctor out there 
                    who can make her change her mind.  
                    She wants this too much.  

                                  JILL
                    She doesn t want it.  Her father 
                    does.  He s brainwashed her into 
                    thinking this is her dream when 
                    it s not.  It s his.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    I don t think that s the case. 

                                  JILL
                    You don t know.  You just met her. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    I know athletes.  The ones doing it 
                    for someone else win the school 
                      tournament.  Maybe get their 
                    picture in the local paper.  That s 
                    it.  To do what Lacey s done -- to 
                    put yourself through that level of 
                    pain and sacrifice -- the only way 
                    you do that is if you can t not.   

      Jill sees she s not going to get what she wants.  Gets teary.

                                  JILL
                    You said it yourself.  That thing 
                    could kill her.  She could lose her 
                    life before it s even started.  

                                    MICHAEL 
                    I d say Lacey s living a very full -

                                  JILL
                    She s not living life, she s living 
                    tennis.  She doesn t have friends, 
                    she s never had a sleep-over or 
                    kissed a boy.  She s hit a ball 
                    over a net.  That s it.  

      She starts to crumble.  Years of unexpressed disappointment.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    This feels like a conversation you 
                    should be having with Milt.

                                  JILL
                    You don t talk with Milt.  You 
                    listen.  You pretend to listen.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    39.

                                  JILL (CONT'D)
                    You close your ears and your eyes 
                    and pray to God that he doesn t 
                    destroy her completely.  

      More tears.  Michael doesn t comfort her.  

                                  JILL (CONT'D)
                    I thought you would help me.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    I m sorry.  

                                  JILL
                    No, you re not.  

      She leaves.  A beat.  Then Rita comes in, eyebrows raised -- 
      she heard -- and hands him a computer disk.

                                  RITA
                    Your MRI.


      Michael, looking at the MRI on his computer, massaging his 
      shoulder.  He pulls the Percocet out of his pocket.  But he 
      pauses before taking one -- reconsidering.  

      Then he feels HANDS ON HIS SHOULDERS.  He spins around -- but 
      it s only Madeline.  

                                  MADELINE
                    Jumpy.  

      She starts massaging his shoulder.  

                                  MADELINE (CONT'D)
                    Guess who I heard from today. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    Who?

                                  MADELINE
                    Balthus s foundation director.  
                    Ron s feeling grateful.  Wants to 
                    give us half a million dollars.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    No kidding. 

                                  MADELINE
                    Nope.  There s your rehab facility.  

      She abandons the shoulder and starts unbuttoning his shirt.                                                                                      40.


                                  MADELINE (CONT'D)
                    Good things come to those who 
                    operate on billionaires. 

      She has a couple of buttons undone.  But the way he s 
      feeling, there is no way.  He closes a hand around her hands, 
      stopping her.  From her reaction: this never happens.  

      She stands there a moment.  Then takes her arms off of him. 

                                  MADELINE (CONT'D)
                    All right then. 

      She steps away.  Bruised. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    Rain check -- okay?  

      Whatever.  Madeline heads out of his office, miffed. 

                                    MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                    Madeline, hang on --

      But she leaves.  Excellent.  


      Michael, driving up Stone Canyon, heading home, exhausted.

                                  ANNA 
                    How d it go?

      She s there, in his passenger seat.  He jumps, swerves --

                                    MICHAEL
                    Jesus Christ!

      -- then regains control and stares at her beside him -- ????

                                  ANNA 
                    Did you open the files?

                                    MICHAEL
                    You can t -- we can t just -- chat.

                                  ANNA
                    Why not?

                                    MICHAEL 
                    Because I don t know what you are.  
                      A hallucination, okay, but from 
                    what?  Not a brain tumor, my MRI is 
                    clear.  Maybe schizophrenia, but --                                                                                    41.


                                  ANNA
                    You know you re not schizophrenic.  
                    Watch the road.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    Then what?  What are you?  

                                  ANNA
                    I told you. 

      He looks at her -- just starting to let himself accept this.

                                    MICHAEL
                    So that s -- it s -- you re --

      She nods, shrugs.  He continues to look at her -- in shock.

                                    MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                    So -- so, what?  How does it -- 
                    what does it --

                                  ANNA
                    I don t know.  I m not in control 
                    of things -- where I am, when.  
                    Watch the road --
                          (he does)
                    I m with you -- then I don t know 
                    where I am -- then I m with you 
                    again --

      He looks at her, unable to process all this --

                                    MICHAEL 
                    Anna -- I m a doctor.  People trust 
                    me, they put their lives in my 
                    hands, I can t be --

                                  ANNA
                    Michael, watch out!

      He looks up .  HEADLIGHTS are coming at him.  He yanks the 
      wheel -- bouncing off the road -- and swipes a TREE, hard 
      enough to stop the car and explode the air bag into his face.  


                                  END OF ACT TWO                                                                                    42.


                                      ACT THREE


      Didi opens the door to find Michael there.

                                  DIDI
                    Michael.  Hi. 

      She lets him in.  


      Dinner s on the table.  Didi is the only one there.  She 
      watches, curious, as Michael goes to her fridge, grabs 
      himself a beer.  

                                  DIDI
                    How are you?

      He nods, good, as he opens the beer and takes a slug.  Then 
      he leans against her counter, and, trying to sound off-hand:  

                                    MICHAEL
                    So -- that Anton guy.  Is he a 
                    total flake, or what?

      There s a FLUSH somewhere.  

                                  DIDI
                    I don t know.  Ask him yourself. 

      The BATHROOM DOOR OPENS.  Anton comes out.  Not what Michael 
      had in mind.  Anton brightens when he sees Michael. 

                                  ANTON
                    Brother Mike.  What s going down?

      He grabs one of the dinner plates and eats, standing up.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Nothing.  I just -- dropped by.  

                                  ANTON
                    Visitor came back, huh?

                                  DIDI
                    Oh my God, she did?                                                                                      43.


      Okay -- really not how Michael wanted this to play out.  He 
      doesn t answer.  Anton reads his silence as a yes. 

                                  ANTON 
                    Yeah, that s what they do.  They 
                    get in, and they do not like to get 
                    out.  You re like her own personal 
                    Roach Motel.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    That s a ... lovely image.  Thanks.  

      Anton plops on the sofa, still eating while he consults. 

                                  ANTON 
                    Do you just feel her, or can you 
                    see her too?

      Milo scuffs in, iPod on, goes to the fridge.  He can t hear, 
      but it makes Michael more self-conscious.  He doesn t answer.  

                                  DIDI
                    He sees her.  

                                  ANTON
                    Huh.  So she s really dug in.  What 
                    do you feel physically?  Any pain?

                                    MICHAEL
                      A shoulder thing, but that s from 
                    surgery.  

                                  ANTON
                    Worse lately?

                                    MICHAEL
                    Yes.  But -- 

      Anton s eyes search the space above Michael s shoulders.  

                                  ANTON
                    Yeah, so that s how she got in.   

                                    MICHAEL
                    Through my shoulder?

                                  ANTON
                    No, the shoulder s just a symptom.  
                    The problem is the tear in your 
                    energetic body -- 

      Anton gets up, waves his hand above Michael s sore shoulder --                                                                                    44.


                                  ANTON (CONT'D)
                    Right around here. 

                                  DIDI
                    He can see it.  Isn t that cool?

      Michael pulls away.  From where he s scooping ice cream, Milo 
      sees the dance between the men.  He takes off his headphones.

                                  ANTON 
                    Like I said, I can extract her if 
                    you want.   

                                  MILO
                    Extract who? 

      Enough.  Michael s had it.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    Nothing.  I gotta go. 

      Michael chucks the beer bottle (which he s drained) into 
      Didi s trash.  He opens the door and heads out.  To his back:

                                  ANTON
                    Just come by my place whenever.  
                    I m always around.


      Michael is in workout clothes, gutting it out on a machine, 
      lifting as much weight as he can manage.  Rita comes in. 

                                  RITA
                    There you are.  Balthus was rushed 
                    to the Cedars ER this morning. 

      Michael stops lifting.  Sits up.  Alert.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Why?  

                                  RITA
                    When Randy got to work, Balthus was 
                    hung over and groggy --

                                    MICHAEL
                    God damn it.  Call his primary-care 
                    guy, Neil Desai.                                                                                    45.


      Rita dials on her phone.

                                  RITA
                    We got the results back on the boy.  
                    The CT is clear.  Blood sugar is 
                    normal, but sodium was at 116.  
                          (into phone)
                    Dr. Michael Halsted for Dr. Desai.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Call the mom.  Tell her he s fine, 
                    just an electrolyte imbalance, and 
                    she should have salty snacks and 
                    Gatorade at his the games.    

      She hands the phone to Michael.  Michael takes it.  

                                  NEIL DESAI (OVER PHONE)
                    Mike, hi -- calling about Balthus?

                                    MICHAEL
                    Yeah, what s up?

                                  NEIL DESAI
                    Not good.  When they brought him 
                    in, he was lethargic, pulse was 
                    100, temperature 101, stiff neck --

      Michael grimaces.  Shit.  Takes a beat.  Then:

                                    MICHAEL 
                    Thanks.  Keep me posted. 

      He hangs up.  Shit.  Hands Rita s her phone, avoiding her 
      eyes.  His own phone rings.  Saved by the bell.  He answers.

                                    MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                    This is Dr. Halstead. 

      INTERCUT WITH:


      Jill Sandreski is on her phone, panicked.  Milt is trying to 
      take it from her.  Lacey is in a seat, eyes closed, in pain.  
      Her hands are shielding her eyes from the light. 

                                  JILL
                    Dr. Halstead, it s Jill Sandreski.  

                                  MILT
                    Jill -- hang up the phone.

      He reaches for it.  She SLAPS his hand away, hard.                                                                                     46.


                                  JILL
                    She has a headache, a really bad 
                    headache.    

                                  MILT
                    It s nothing, she gets one every 
                    time she flies. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    Where are you?

                                  JILL
                    In the plane.  We took off 45 
                    minutes ago. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    Turn around.  Come back. 

                                  JILL
                          (fears confirmed)
                    Oh my God -- okay.  Okay. 
                          (to Milt)
                    Tell him we have to go back.

                                  MILT
                    We re not going back.  She s fine.   

                                    MICHAEL
                    Tell the pilot to fly as fast as he 
                    can and land at Santa Monica.  

      Jill talks to the FLIGHT ATTENDANT.

                                  JILL
                    We need to go back, fast. He has to 
                    land at Santa Monica.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    Tell him to tell the tower he has a 
                    medical emergency on board.  

                                  JILL 
                    Okay.  Okay.  

      Milt gets between Jill and the Flight Attendant. 

                                  MILT
                    God damn it, we are not turning 
                    around.  We are going to New York. 

                                  LACEY
                    Turn around.                                                                                     47.


      Her voice sounds strange.  Childlike.  Her eyes are closed.  
      There are tears on her cheeks.  Milt freezes, freaked.  

                                  JILL
                    Oh my God.  TURN AROUND!  TURN THE 
                    PLANE AROUND!  

      The Flight Attendant runs up to the cockpit.  

      Phone line still open, Jill kneels in front of Lacey.  

                                  JILL (CONT'D)
                    It s okay, baby, we re going back.  

      Lacey keeps her eyes closed, trying to control the headache.  

                                  LACEY
                    Tell him I wasn t asymptomatic. 

                                  JILL
                    What?

                                  LACEY
                    I lied.  I was having eye trouble.
                          (silent tears)
                    I just wanted to win.  

      The PLANE BANKS as they turn around.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    I got that.  Don t let her move.  
                    Keep her head elevated.  I ll meet 
                    you at the airport.


      Michael, hurrying through the halls.  Rita right behind him. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    Send an ICU ambulance to Santa 
                    Monica Airport.  

      Rita starts dialing.  He heads into:


      When he gets there, Ines and Robert and Ernesto are there, 
      with a HUGE BASKET of homemade goods.  

                                  INES
                    Doctor!  This is for you. 

      Rita takes it from her.                                                                                     48.


                                  RITA
                          (into her phone)
                    Dr. Halstead needs an ICU ambulance 
                    at Santa Monica Airport, stat.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    Call downstairs.  I need an amp of 
                    Mannitol, and 10 mg of Decadron. 

      Rita dials again.  He heads toward:


      Michael comes in, grabs his keys and wallet, and heads back 
      out (still in his workout clothes).


      When he comes out, Rita is there with Ines, the kids, and the 
      gift basket, talking on her phone, holding the elevator.  

                                  RITA
                    ... an amp of Mannitol and 10 mg. 
                    of Decadron.

                                  INES
                    Doctor, I want to thank you for all 
                    you do for my family.  

      Michael steps onto the elevator.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    Also some Labetalol.  I ll grab it 
                    on my way out.  

                                  RITA
                          (into phone)
                    Also some Lebatalol.  He ll be 
                    right down.  

      As the elevator doors start to close, he notices Robert, in 
      NEW SNEAKERS, wincing.  Michael wants to ignore it -- but 
      can t quite.  He sticks his foot in the door, stopping it.

                                    MICHAEL 
                    Hey.  Your feet still hurt?

      Robert nods.  Michael kneels, waves him over.

                                    MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                    What else?   Any other pain?

      Robert goes to him.  As Michael taps his Achilles:                                                                                    49.


                                  ROBERT
                    My back. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    Show me where. 

      Robert points to his lower back/buttocks area.  

                                    MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                    Anything else?  Bed-wetting?  You 
                    been peeing in your bed at night?

      Robert nods again, embarrassed.  Michael turns to Rita ...

                                    MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                    Lumbar MRI, and a gadolinium-
                    enhanced study of the conus.  

      He takes his foot out of the elevator, and the doors close. 

                                  INES
                    What --?  

      Rita comes up with the bedside manner Michael lacks.  

                                  RITA
                    Dr. Halstead would like to give 
                    your other boy a couple of tests, 
                    too ...


      Jill, on the couch, barely breathing.  Milt, staring into the 
      fish tank.  HEAR the BUBBLES of the filter, CONTINUING OVER:  


      ON THE COMPUTER SCREEN: FOUR FLUOROSCOPIC IMAGE of LACEY S 
      BRAIN, each a different angle and magnification.  The bleed 
      is visible, spilling into the surrounding brain tissue.

      As the BUBBLING continues, see the ENDOVASCULAR COIL moves 
      into the frame, heading for the bleed through a blood vessel.  

      ON MICHAEL, deep in unwavering concentration as he negotiates 
      the coil toward the aneurysm. 

      ON THE SCREEN: the coil reaches the aneurysm.  Goes past it.  
      Backs up.  Goes past it again.  Backs up again.  Then, as it 
      passes the aneurysm a third time, it catches.  The end slips 
      into the aneurysm.  The rest of the metal coil follows, 
      knotting up inside the bleeding aneurysm.  Filling it, like a 
      cork.  Cutting off the blood flow out of the vein.  


      Michael, from above, lying on the floor.  Drained.  Eyes 
      closed. 

                                  ANNA
                    You weren t kidding.  You are very, 
                    very good.    

      He looks.  She s lying beside him. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    Do you ever knock?

      Before he can answer, there s a KNOCK.  His door opens and 
      Rita comes in, papers in hand.  Michael sits up --

                                  RITA 
                    I ve got the other boy s test 
                    results.  You want to see them?

      Michael looks from her to Anna -- but Rita doesn t seem to 
      see her.                                                                                     51.


                                    MICHAEL
                    Um ...

                                  RITA
                          (checks her notes)
                    Tumor of the distal spinal cord at 
                    the conus.  Do you want to remove 
                    it, or do you want Oscar to? 

      Michael stands.  Anna stays on the floor.  As Rita moves 
      around the room -- putting things away, cleaning up -- she 
        miraculously manages to just miss Anna with every pass. 

                                  ANNA
                    You do it. 

      Michael looks Rita.  Rita isn t hearing her, either.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    Um ... 

                                  RITA
                    You or Oscar?

                                    MICHAEL
                    Oscar.  

                                  ANNA
                    Why?

                                  RITA
                    I ll call the mom and fill her in. 

                                  ANNA
                    She s not going to want to hear 
                    that from a secretary, Michael.  
                    Call her yourself. 

                                  RITA
                    You know she doesn t have 
                      insurance, right?

                                  ANNA
                    Oh, please.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    I ... figured. 

                                  RITA
                    So who s covering it?  

                                  ANNA
                    You are.                                                                                      52.


      Beat. 

                                    MICHAEL 
                    We are.  

      Rita stops cleaning.  Looks at Michael, suspicious.  

                                  RITA
                    Are those your children, Michael?

                                    MICHAEL
                    What?  No.  

                                  RITA 
                    Just trying to figure out why we re 
                    suddenly running the place like a 
                    free clinic.   

      She takes the trash she s gathered and leaves.  

                                  RITA (CONT'D)
                    Open or closed?

                                    MICHAEL
                    Closed. 

      She shuts the door behind her.  Michael bends over, 
      collapsing under the stress of this double-reality.

                                  ANNA
                    I don t like her. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    Yeah?  Well, my life would fall 
                    apart without her, so --

                                  ANNA
                    If that s true, there s something 
                    wrong with your life.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    Anna.  Don t start.  

      Anna stands, ramping up.  She s saying it nicely, but still.

                                  ANNA
                    Seriously -- if you can t make your 
                    own phone calls -- can t meet your 
                    own human obligations --

                                    MICHAEL
                    No.  No no, you re not doing this --                                                                                    53.


                                  ANNA
                    -- you re probably off-base in some 
                    very fundamental --

                                    MICHAEL
                    Stop.  Stop. 
                          (she does)
                    I can t do this, Anna.  I can t -- 

                                  ANNA
                    What?

      A beat.  He looks at her.  Realizing:  

                                    MICHAEL
                    I can t.   

      He grabs his keys, and leaves. 


      Michael, now behind the wheel of his car.  He turns to look 
      at the Venice bungalow he s parked in front of. 


      The door is opened by Anton, bare-chested, in Thai farmer 
      pants, eating Ramen noodles.

                                  ANTON
                    Mikey Mike!  Hey!  Come on in.


                                  END OF ACT THREE                                                                                    54.


                                        ACT FOUR


      Anton has laid out a circle of STONES around his NAVAJO RUG.  
      Michael watches, highly skeptical, as Anton gathers his 
      tools: rattle, spirit water, crystal ...

                                  ANTON
                    Go ahead and lie down. 

      Michael lies down -- reluctantly.  Anton raises his arms and 
      shakes his rattle (festooned with eagle feathers) to the sky. 

                                  ANTON (CONT'D)
                    To the Winds of the East, Father 
                    Eagle, come to us --
                          (Michael chuckles)
                    Hey, man, you sterilize your way, I 
                    sterilize mine.  
                          (arms back up, rattle)
                    -- come to us from the land of the 
                    rising sun, teach us to fly wing-to-
                    wing with the Great Spirit.  AH-HO!

      Michael startles at the yell.  


      Anton kneels at Michael s shoulders and takes Michael s head 
      in his hands, feeling it with his fingertips. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    Do you have to do that with my 
                    head?

                                  ANTON
                    Brother, I don t have to do any of 
                    this, but if you want her gone ...

                                    MICHAEL
                    Fine.  

                                  ANTON
                    Okay.  So I want you to close your 
                    eyes and feel her.  

      Michael closes his eyes.  


      Michael s eyes pop open: how the hell did Anton know?  Anton 
      is still holding his head, eyes closed. 

                                  ANTON 
                    Don t freak out.  Keep breathing.  

      Michael closes his eyes again.  Takes a deep breath.  


      Anton puts a rock in Michael s hand, then picks up a pendulum 
      with a crystal on the end.

                                  ANTON
                    Now take all your feelings about 
                    her, and blow them into that rock. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    What?

                                  ANTON
                    Whatever feelings come up.  Any and 
                    all.  Put them in here.  Big blow. 

      Oh-kay.  Michael blows hard on the rock.  Anton takes it from 
      him, then moves the pendulum over Michael s various chakras. 


      Anna, closer now.  Looking intrigued -- curious about why 
      she s been summoned -- and a little suspicious. 

      And MICHAEL appears in the dreamscape too.  We re looking 
      over his shoulder at Anna approaching.  She sees him.                                                                                     56.


                                  ANNA
                    Michael?  
                          (looks around)
                    What are we doing?  


      Anton sets the rock on a chakra.  Shakes the rattle over it. 

                                  ANTON
                    So now you wanna thank her for 
                    being in this life with you.  For 
                    whatever she brought to you, or 
                    helped you with.  Express that 
                      gratitude.  Then let her know 
                    you ll be okay without her.  


      Michael opens his eyes, looks at Anton. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    I don t think this is working. 

                                  ANTON
                    Stick with it. 

      Fine.  Closes his eyes again. 


      Anna is bouncing the ball, bored.  

                                  ANNA
                    Cut to the chase, hon, what are we 
                    doing here?
                          (he doesn t answer)
                    Hello?  Michael?                                                                                    57.


                                    MICHAEL
                    We re sending you away.

      She stops bouncing the ball.  Looks at him.  A beat.  

                                  ANNA
                    I don t want to go.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    Anna --

      Her fear starts to break through her tough exterior.

                                  ANNA
                    No. You can t.  I m not ready.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    Anna --

                                  ANNA
                    There are things I didn t finish -- 
                    all these doors I left open --  

      She reaches out, takes his hands, almost begging.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    Anna, come on -- 

                                  ANNA
                    I need you to help me close them.  
                    There s no one else I can ask -- 
                    Michael, please -- please --

      He shakes her off of him.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    I can t have you in my life!

                                  ANNA
                          (arguing now)
                    Why not?  Why not?

                                    MICHAEL
                    You don t fit.  My life -- who I am 
                    -- I can t be crazy --

                                  ANNA
                    You re not crazy --

                                    MICHAEL
                    You re not real.  I don t even know 
                    what you are --                                                                                     58.


                                  ANNA 
                    So?  Why can t I be the one thing 
                    in life you don t understand?  

      He laughs.  

                                  ANNA (CONT'D)
                    What?

                                    MICHAEL
                    Anna.  You have always been the one 
                    thing in life I don t understand.  

      Something in the way he says it -- the beginning of 
      resignation -- tells her he s weakening.     

                                  ANNA 
                    If I go, we never see each other 
                    again.  Is that what you want?

                                    MICHAEL
                          (resolve crumbling)
                    That s not the point. 

                                  ANNA
                    Then what is?  

      She looks at him with an intimacy he feels nowhere else in 
      his life.  He tries to come up with an answer.  But can t.


      Michael sits bolt up, surprising Anton, knocking him back. 

                                  ANTON
                    What happened?  What are we doing?

                                    MICHAEL
                    Nothing.  I m good.  She s gone.  

      He stands, goes to get his watch.  

                                  ANTON
                    She s not gone.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    Yeah, she left.  

      He puts on his watch, grabs his wallet. 

                                  ANTON
                    Friend, what I do?  It s just like 
                    you, taking out a tumor.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    59.

                                  ANTON (CONT'D)
                    You know when it s out, and you 
                    know when it s still there.  

      Michael laughs.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    What you do -- friend -- is nothing 
                    like what I do.  Thanks for ...
                          (whatever it was)
                    Good night. 

      He leaves. 


      Lacey, lying in bed, staring out the window.  Michael knocks, 
      enters.  She swings her head toward him.  Blank eyes.

                                    MICHAEL
                    How are you feeling?

      Lacey can t answer.  Shrugs.  

                                    MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                      Physically?

                                  LACEY
                    Fine.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    Headache?  

                                  LACEY
                    Gone. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    Good.  

      He sits on her bed. 

                                    MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                    There s next year.                                                                                     60.


                                  LACEY
                    No.  I ll be 20.  Steffi was 19 and 
                    3 months.  It s over.  
                          (then)
                    How long till I can play again?

                                    MICHAEL
                    Three months completely off.  Six 
                    before you can play full-on.  

      That hits her like a fist in the gut. 

                                  LACEY
                    What am I supposed to do?  Pick up 
                    a hobby?  Go on vacation?  

                                    MICHAEL
                    Yup, and you ll hate it, because 
                    nothing can come close to how you 
                    feel when you play.  

      Then he hears what he s saying.  Realizes there s a small 
      part of him -- a new part -- that doesn t 100% agree.  

                                    MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                    Or, I don t know, maybe not.  Maybe 
                    something will happen that makes it 
                    okay.  You never know.   Life s 
                    full of surprises.

      ACROSS THE HALL, Ines, sitting with Robert, sees Michael 
      giving Lacey his attention.   Then Jill walks by the door.

      IN LACEY S ROOM, 

      Jill enters, arms laden with magazines, snacks, beverages.  
      Embarrassingly excited to have this time with Lacey.  

                                  JILL
                    I got everything on the magazine 
                    shelf.  What should we start with?

      Lacey looks up at Michael.  He nods -- I get it -- then 
      stands, to leave them alone together. 

      IN ROBERT S ROOM, 

      Ines sees Michael leave Lacey s room.  She goes into the hall 
      to meet him. 

                                  INES
                    Dr. Halstead, can you tell me when 
                    you do the surgery on Robert?                                                                                    61.


                                    MICHAEL
                    I m not doing it.  Dr. Sujishi is.  

                                  INES
                    But -- you are the best.  That s 
                    what everybody say.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Dr. Sujishi is excellent as well.  
                    You have nothing to worry about.  

                                  INES 
                    If he was your son, who would you 
                    want for the surgery?  

      His phone buzzes.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    Me.  But he s not my son, he s 
                    yours, so Dr. Sujishi will do it.   
                          (walks away, answering the 
                            phone)
                    This is Dr. Halstead. 

      INTERCUT WITH:


      Randy is calling from the hallway.  Doing a damn good job of 
      keeping it together. 

                                  RANDY
                    Dr. Halstead, it s Randy, Mr. 
                    Balthus s assistant.  I didn t know 
                    if they were keeping you informed -- 

                                    MICHAEL
                    Pretty much.  Yes.  

                                  RANDY
                    So you know they confirmed spinal 
                      meningitis --

      Yeah, Michael figured.  

                                  RANDY (CONT'D)
                    They tell me it s very bad.  They 
                    just -- um -- they said they aren t 
                    sure he ll make it through the day.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    I see.                                                                                      62.


                                  RANDY
                    I know you re busy.  But if you 
                    could come by, I m sure he d like 
                    that.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    Right.  I ll try. 

      Hang up.  Michael clamps his eyes shut -- struggling.  Not a 
      man who enjoys struggling.  He opens his eyes.  Spots Ines.  

      Without pausing to question what he s doing, he goes to her.  

                                    MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                    I ll do it. 

                                  INES
                    Excuse me?

                                    MICHAEL
                    Your boy s surgery.  I ll do it.  

      Ines is instantly grateful -- a flood of relief.  

                                  INES
                    Oh, doctor, thank you so much.  
                    Thank you thank you thank you.  

      She hugs him.  He lets it happen.


      The elevator opens.  Michael steps out, followed by  Anna.  
      They head down the hall, find the room -- then Michael stops:

      INSIDE THE ROOM, Randy is packing the special sheets, the 
      French Press, the lamp.  The bed is empty.  Randy sees 
      Michael in the hall.  Randy is devastated. 


      Michael in the car, staring ahead.  Anna is next to him.  
      After a quiet moment, he SLAMS HIS HAND ON THE STEERING wheel 
      repeatedly.  Furious.  Anna doesn t say anything.

      Once his impotent rage dies down, he slumps in his seat, head 
      back, eyes closed.  Finally:                                                                                    64.


                                    MICHAEL
                    What s it like?

                                  ANNA
                    Dying?

      Yes.   She thinks about how to describe it.  

                                  ANNA (CONT'D)
                    In the moment, it s like knowing 
                      absolutely everything, and 
                      absolutely nothing, all at once.  
                      Everything and nothing, rushing 
                    through you like a torrent.    
                          (then, less sure)
                    But then, that part s over -- and 
                    there you are, and ...
                          (beat)
                    I don t know.  I don t know.  

      She falters.  Then, the best analogy she has:

                                  ANNA (CONT'D)
                    You know -- when we were together, 
                    I d go out in the world and see 
                    other married couples -- walking 
                    around hand-in-hand, protecting 
                    each other -- and I d think, Wow, 
                    I m not doing this right.  
                          (then:)
                    That s how I feel now.  Like 
                    whatever this is, I m not doing it 
                    right.  
                          (beat)
                    Nobody gives you a manual.  There s 
                    no concierge.  Who knows, maybe one 
                    will show up and say, right this 
                    way, Ma am, your table is ready, 
                    but until they do ...

      She looks at him.  He sees how lost and confused she is. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    -- you ll stick with me.


      Lacey is in bed, alone.  She glances into Robert s room.  
      Robert and COUSINS are piled on the bed, playing a PSP.  
      Having a grand old time.  Ines is there.  She looks out into 
      the hall -- sees Lacey watching. She puts some cake on a 
      paper plate and brings it to Lacey.                                                                                     65.


                                  INES
                    Tres leches.  It s very good.  

                                  LACEY
                    Thank you.  
                          (takes a bite)
                    It s delicious.  

                                  INES
                    The kids are watching Spiderman.  
                    You want to come, watch with them?

      Lacey s first instinct is to say no.  But then -- why not?

                                  LACEY
                    Okay.  

      She gets up.  Ines takes her arm and supports her as she 
      walks over to the party room. 

                                  INES
                    I am Ines. 

                                  LACEY
                          (without any PR falseness)
                    I m Lacey.  


      Michael goes to Didi s door, holding Didi s Whole Foods apron 
      (which she left in his office).  Knocks.  Milo opens.  The TV 
      is on in the background. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    Hey.  Is your Mom here?

                                  MILO
                    No. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    Oh.  Well, this is hers.  Give it 
                    to her, okay?  

      He hands Milo the apron, planning to leave.  Then he sees the 
      TV.  Milo.  An opportunity.  He pauses.  Then:

                                    MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                    Is that the Lakers?
