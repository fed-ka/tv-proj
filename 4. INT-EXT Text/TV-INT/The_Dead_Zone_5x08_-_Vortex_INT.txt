          members of an INVESTIGATING PANEL.  A SEAL on the wall
          identifies the "Maine State Commission of Investigation." 
          Seybold testifies from a table near a wide-screen monitor,
          as a COURT REPORTER and a smattering of OFFICIALS listen.

                                        SEYBOLD
                        It means the entire compound was
                        completely on fire.

                                        STILLSON
                        So rescue efforts...?

                                        SEYBOLD
                        ...were impossible.  I didn't
                        want to risk more lives.

          Stillson eyes the time code.

                                        STILLSON
                        All this within twenty minutes. 
                        Major, how do you account for the
                        rapid spread of the fire?

                                        SEYBOLD
                        Incendiary devices.  If you'd
                        like to hear from the head of our
                          forensics team, he's right over --

                                        STILLSON
                        No.  Right now, I want to hear
                        from the man responsible for this
                          disaster.

          Off Johnny, as he takes in the scene...

                                              ACT ONE

          FADE IN:


          Stillson may be addressing the panel, but his eyes remain
          on Johnny, and they betray a personal animus.

                                        STILLSON
                        The citizens of Maine don't deserve
                        to be kept in the dark about the
                          progress of this investigation.

          The 50ish CHAIRWOMAN, State Senator MEGAN CLEARY, nods,
          her tone diplomatic.

                                        CHAIRWOMAN
                        Nor will they be, Congressman,
                        once this panel establishes all
                        the relevant facts.  And for the
                        record I would like to express my
                          gratitude that you have volunteered
                        to help us in that important task.
                                (turns to Johnny)
                        Mister Smith, will you please
                        state your full name?

                                        JOHNNY (V.O.)
                        John Robert Smith.

                                        CHAIRWOMAN
                        Your occupation?

          When Johnny hesitates, Stillson seizes the opportunity to
          retake control of the hearing, and get another dig in.

                                        STILLSON
                        I'm afraid Mister Smith may find
                        that a sensitive question.

          Johnny eyes Stillson coolly; clearly, there's no love
          lost between these two.  Then, to the Chairwoman:

                                        JOHNNY
                        I was a science teacher.

                                        STILLSON
                        Why be disingenuous, Mister Smith? 
                        It's well known that you're a
                          professional psychic.

                                        JOHNNY
                          "Professional" implies I make
                        money at it.  I don't.

                                        STILLSON
                        This panel needs to know how you
                        became involved with the religious
                        cult known as "The Seekers."

          A beat as Johnny considers how best to explain.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I had a vision.

                                        STILLSON
                        And this "vision," what did it
                        tell you?

                                        JOHNNY
                        That a child was going to die.

          And as an expectant hush falls over the room, we PUSH IN
          on Johnny... begin to hear a woman's voice --

                                        WOMAN'S VOICE
                        The bomb went off right next to 
                        my son's convoy.



          Roscoe now at the witness table.  He fidgets with his
          collar, clearly uncomfortable.

    12CONTINUED:12

                                        STILLSON
                        Mister Smith's a loose cannon,
                        isn't he?

                                        ROSCOE
                        I wouldn't say that.  He's just
                        very...



          Johnny and Bruce pressure a harried Roscoe as they eye
          Styron in the interrogation room.

                                        ROSCOE (V.O.)
                        ... determined.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You searched his van?

                                        ROSCOE
                        We found some gun parts that might
                        be illegal.  Provided he doesn't
                          challenge our search.

                                        JOHNNY
                        So, let's get him to tell who he
                        sold the mines to.  It won't take
                        much to throw a scare in him.  He
                        already thinks I'm crazy.

          Roscoe eyes Johnny like he just might agree.  Then:

                                        ROSCOE
                        Can't we just wait 'til the Sheriff
                        gets back from his fishing trip?

                                        JOHNNY
                          A girl's life is at stake.

          As Roscoe sighs, relenting...

                                        STILLSON (V.O.)
                        So you allowed Mr. Smith to
                        intimidate the suspect?

                                        ROSCOE (V.O.)
                        I wouldn't call it intimidation.



          Johnny berates Styron as Roscoe hangs back nervously.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Vortex" - ACT ONE - 8/21/05 - GOLD  11.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You think that's the only thing I
                        can find out?  Ever cheat on your
                        income tax, Jimmy?  Steal weapons
                        from the Army?

          As Styron jerks away from Johnny's hand --

                                        ROSCOE (V.O.)
                        As it turned out, Mister Styron
                        was willing to cooperate.

                                        STYRON
                        His name's Jacob.  Lives in some
                          "commune" up in north county.

          Suddenly ROSCOE looks green; he wants to say something
          but can't.  Johnny doesn't notice, pressing Styron --

                                        JOHNNY
                        Where in north county?



          As a man's HAND pulls a curtain aside, revealing Johnny
          and Bruce tentatively approaching.

                                        SEYBOLD (O.S.)
                        Friends of yours?

          Whoever he's talking to doesn't reply.



          Walt at the witness table.

                                        WALT
                        One thing I've learned working
                        with John:  it's hard to keep a
                        secret from him.

                                        STILLSON
                        Because he's psychic?

                                        WALT
                                (beat)
                        Yes.

          Stillson shakes his head derisively, as though he can't
          believe what he's hearing.

                                        STILLSON
                        And yet, with a covert raid only
                        two days away, you allowed him
                        into your command post?

                                        WALT
                        He'd made it that far.  I thought
                        he should at least understand the
                        situation.

                        Carter thinks he's some kind of

                        he was stockpiling weapons.  About

                        Why not give us a chance?

                                        SEYBOLD (O.S.)
                        Does the name "Waco" ring a bell?

          They turn to see him approaching, an undercover officer
          behind him.

                                        SEYBOLD
                        Ninety people lost their lives,
                          including four ATF agents, all
                        because some half-assed TV reporter
                        warned Koresh the feds were coming.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Some people blame the government
                        for forcing a confrontation.

                                        SEYBOLD
                        I'm not going to risk the security
                        of this operation by letting you
                        blunder around.

          Johnny knows there's no winning this argument, so he
          "casually" reaches out to the bulletin board, brushing a
          photo of a DIRT ROAD.  As we hear a WHOOSH --



          Shows the SUV pulling to the shoulder and making a U-turn.

                                        JOHNNY (V.O.)
                        They should've followed us all
                        the way home.

          He suddenly veers off onto a rocky fire road.  As the car
          hits a big bump --

                                        BRUCE
                        What're you doing?

                        I'm not leaving that kid to die.



          They're parked behind some trees, about 50 yards away.

                                        BRUCE
                        They look like they're waiting
                        for a bus.

                                        JOHNNY
                        A van, actually.

          Johnny pulls out an old duffel, fishes out a Red Sox cap
          and some cheap sunglasses.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Which is how I'm gonna slip inside.

                                        BRUCE
                        You're forgetting something.
                                (off Johnny's look)
                        "We're a team," remember?  You're
                        gonna do something this crazy,
                        I'm going with.  Gimme that.

          He grabs the bag, fishes out another cap for himself, as
          Johnny watches resignedly.



          PANNING from a thick BIBLE on a desktop reading stand,
          open to a densely annotated chapter in "Revelations," to
          a LARGE FLAT-PANEL COMPUTER SCREEN, which displays news
          stories of war and terror, genocide in Darfur, famine and
          AIDs in Africa, along with earthquakes and tsunamis.

                                        CARTER (O.S.)
                        The signs are everywhere.  Wars. 
                        Famine.  Plague and disease. 
                        We're deep in the End Times.

          And CYRUS CARTER turns to Jacob Frankel, who's been waiting
            patiently in the doorway to deliver a bit of news.

                                        CARTER
                        When the final sign comes, Babylon
                        must find us ready.

                                        FRANKEL
                        They will.

                                        CARTER
                        Are you ready, Jacob?

                                        FRANKEL
                        Of course, Cyrus.

                                        CARTER
                        No matter what needs to be done?

          A silent understanding passes between them.  Frankel nods.

                                        FRANKEL
                        Yes.

                                        CARTER
                        We've been together the longest. 
                        I knew I could count on you.
                                (turning to computer)
                        I heard the van pull up.

                                        FRANKEL

                          familiar.

          Carter hits some commands and a SURVEILLANCE CAMERA WINDOW
          opens.  He hits a key and it EXPANDS to fill the screen:          DEAD ZONE: "Vortex" - ACT TWO - 8/22/05 - WHT-2  19.



          The group of people from the clearing are being greeted
          by other sect members.  Johnny and Bruce stand a bit back,
          their own welcoming committee a pudgy, mild-looking guy.

          CARTER

          Uses the MOUSE to ZOOM IN on Johnny, who's taken off his
          baseball cap and shades.  Carter's eyes narrow.

                                        CHAIRWOMAN (V.O.)
                        Having managed to "infiltrate"
                        the cult, what were your first
                          impressions?



          PANNING ACROSS a communal space that doubles as a chapel,
          a raised dais at one end.  Adult sect members of varying
          races and ages surround the newly arrived Australians. 
          Several CHILDREN dart among the adults, playing tag.

                                        JOHNNY (V.O.)
                        It didn't seem like a "cult," at
                        least at first.  More like a...
                        family.



          Johnny back at the witness table.

                          A family.  You must have found
                        that very comforting.  Not having
                          a family of your own, I mean.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I have a son.

                        Who's being raised by another
                        man.

          A tense beat.  Once again, Stillson's made this personal.

                                        STILLSON
                        My point is you had reason to be
                          sympathetic to these people.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I keep an open mind.

                        From your affidavit, it doesn't
                        sound like they returned the favor.



          The pudgy guy, a 30ish Philip Seymour Hoffman type named
          ROGER, collects Bruce's cell, apologetic:

                                        ROGER
                        It's just while you're here.

                        Man, these things get slicker all
                        the time.  Camera?

          During which, Johnny notes a group of CHILDREN sitting
          around a table drawing, supervised by a young woman (LUCY). 
          She lingers beside a BLOND GIRL who's immersed in her
          work, ignoring the more rambunctious kids around her.

          As the girl looks up, her eyes meeting Johnny's --



          FLASHES of mayhem, death and destruction.  Sect members
          and SWAT agents exchanging automatic weapons fire.  The
          compound burning.  Men, women and children DYING.



          As the others crowd around to welcome the newcomers.  As
          Johnny's eyes again find Nora, now sitting alone...

                        First, it's one girl being killed. 
                        Now it's a veritable bloodbath.

                          Sometimes I see pieces of the
                          future... like a jig-saw puzzle.

                        Sounds like you'd be better off
                        with a crystal ball...

          No laughter from the audience this time.  Stillson can't
          help but wonder if the tide is turning.

                                        STILLSON
                        ...or maybe you're just making
                        this up as you go.

                        You subpoenaed me, Congressman. 
                        If you don't like my answers you
                        should ask different questions.

          Stillson smiles slightly at Johnny's challenging tone, as
          if he knows something Johnny doesn't.

                                        STILLSON

          Carter's eyes open, and we reveal he's seated at the head
          of a long communal dining table (several tables pushed
          together?).  Instant bustle as we begin tracking down the
          center-line of the table, following a heaping platter of
          fresh vegetables as they are passed down to Jacob Frankel,
          who sits beside his PREGNANT WIFE, his TODDLER SON on his
          lap.  We catch snatches of conversation --

                        Looks good today.

          He serves himself and his son, then passes it to a FRAGILE
          YOUNG WOMAN, who takes just a few items, then passes it
          to Roger, who's enthusiastically telling her --

                        With hydroponics, we could grow
                        more in the greenhouse than we do
                        in the fields.

          Roger serves himself, then passes it to...

          Johnny.  WHOOSH!

  4949RESUME ON JOHNNY

          Still holding the plate, he looks down the table at the
          row of beaming, content faces.  Lucy, seated beside Nora
          and across from Johnny and Bruce, notices his odd look
          and attributes it to the food.

                        Hope you two aren't die-hard
                          carnivores.

          Johnny turns to her, caught off-guard.  Bruce covers.

                                        BRUCE
                        We love our veggies.

                                        LUCY
                        John, you said your visions led
                        you here.  Are you still wondering
                        why?

                                        JOHNNY
                        You could say my visions work in
                        mysterious ways.  Usually, they
                        take me places where I can help
                        people.

                                        LUCY
                        Maybe this time we're supposed to
                        help you.
                                  (heartfelt)
                        Cyrus has the answers you're
                          seeking, John.  Even if you haven't
                        figured out the questions yet.

          Johnny nods, his eyes going to Nora, who's picking at her
          food as she clutches her doll.

                                        JOHNNY
                        When did you two come here?

                        Almost a year ago.  Cyrus saved
                        me.  Saved both of us, didn't he,
                        honey?
                                (when Nora doesn't
                                  respond)
                        She's shy around strangers.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What about this little girl here?

          He's referring to Nora's doll.

                                        LUCY
                        Nora knows she's not supposed to
                        bring Emily to meals.  Right?

          Nora remains silent, but puts the doll on her lap.  Off
          Johnny, watching her, troubled.


  49A49ATIME CUT

          The meal is being cleared.  Bruce leans toward Johnny.

                                        BRUCE
                        What'd you see before?

                                        JOHNNY
                        All these people, they're...
                        broken.  In pain.

                                        BRUCE
                        And I'll bet Carter uses that.*

                                        JOHNNY
                                (nods to Roger)
                        That "brainwashing" thing Walt
                        talked about?  He really puts
                        them through a wringer.  Gets
                        them seeing things.

                                        BRUCE
                        Jesus.

                                        JOHNNY
                        We've got to get word out to Walt
                        to stop this raid, or they're all
                        going to die.  I've seen that,
                        too.

          Suddenly a bell chimes three times.  Pleased reactions.




                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Vortex" - ACT THREE - 8/23/05 - BLUE-2  29.

                        It's time.

          People rise, start clearing, rearranging tables and chairs.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Time for what?



          The cafeteria has been converted into a chapel, the sect
          members sitting in rows of folding chairs facing the dais,
          where Carter preaches, brandishing his Bible.  (See*
          Addendum A for his b.g. dialogue.)*

                                        JOHNNY (V.O.)
                        It was like Carter threw a switch
                        and they all became pod people.

          PANNING across rapt faces:  Frankel sitting with his wife
          and son; Roger; Lucy and Nora - the little girl still
            clutching her doll and staring past Carter at a shaft of
          light beaming through a high window.  Heavenly light.

                                        JOHNNY (V.O.)
                        He played on their vulnerabilities
                        and fears, promising them
                        salvation.  Salvation that would
                        only come at the end of the Last
                        Days.

          Finding JOHNNY AND BRUCE seated near the back, watching
          Carter gesture with his Bible.  Bruce looks like some
          part of him is actually being affected by Carter's sermon. 
          As Johnny eyes him --

                                        JOHNNY (V.O.)
                        He was the prophet who would lead
                        them in the final battle against
                        the forces of Babylon.

          CARTER lays his Bible on a table.

                                        JOHNNY (V.O.)
                        He said they had the weapons...

          As Carter now lays a semiautomatic HANDGUN atop the Bible --

                                        JOHNNY (V.O.)
                        ...and that they shouldn't be
                        afraid to use them.

          ON JOHNNY, worried.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Vortex" - ACT THREE - 8/17/05 - YELLOW  30.


    50CONTINUED:50

          He glances at a door in the back, then at Frankel, who's
          been keeping a suspicious eye on him.  Finally, Johnny
          and Bruce exchange a look.  Bruce gets the message:  a
          distraction is needed.

          ON CARTER --

                                        CARTER
                        "And I saw a strong angel
                          proclaiming with a loud voice,
                        Who is worthy to open the book
                        and loose the seals thereof?"

            Suddenly, Bruce stands --

                                        BRUCE
                        I saw the Angel!

          Heads turn, including Frankel's.  Carter gestures him
          forward.

                                        CARTER
                        Tell us, brother.

                                        BRUCE
                        When I was a boy, in my father's
                        church.  I beheld an Angel.
                                (takes a breath)
                          I beheld an Angel and he broke
                        the seal.

          Bruce is giving these people a taste of his own past as a
          boy preacher ("Zion"), a potent experience for him even
          if it is a ruse.  The sect members respond, a few calling
          out, "Tell us, Bruce" and "That's right," etc.

                                        BRUCE
                          I beheld the sun, black as
                          sackcloth... And the moon became
                        as blood... And in Heaven there
                        was Silence.  And the Angel said...

          ON FRANKEL, as he looks back, notes Johnny's empty chair.

                                        BRUCE (O.S.)
                        ... come and see.



          Johnny enters cautiously, then reacts to the sleek computer
          set-up.  He moves to the desk, notes a PHOTO of Carter
          with a few followers, and realizes he's in Carter's office.

          He notes a DSL modem, its lights blinking, has an idea. 
          As he sits and begins to type...


    52A52AOMITTED

          Starting tight on the monitor as Johnny mouse-clicks the
          send button in a web-based email site.  His message sent,
          Johnny exhales.  Then he notices a WEBCAM perched on the
          monitor.  He's about to touch it when --

                                        CARTER (O.S.)
                        Don't.

          Johnny turns to see Carter in the doorway, flanked by
          Frankel and another BURLY MAN.

                                        CARTER
                        I've got it set just the way I
                        like it.



          STARTING CLOSE ON a surveillance PHOTO of a disguised
          Johnny and Bruce getting off the van.  Seybold's handing
          it to Walt.

                                        SEYBOLD
                        You knew they were going to try
                          something like this, didn't you? 
                                (when Walt remains
                                  silent)
                        When this is over, I'll have them
                        both up on charges.  Interfering
                        with a State investigation.

                        Fine.  Right now we've got to
                        call off the raid.

                                        SEYBOLD
                        Why would I do that?

                                        WALT
                        John got a message out to my wife. 
                        Said if we go through with this,
                        people will die.

                                        SEYBOLD
                        The only way anyone's gonna die
                        is if that crazy bastard warns
                        them.

                                        WALT
                        If John's saying hold off, it's
                        'cause he's seen what'll happen
                        if we don't.
                                (when Seybold scoffs)
                        You haven't worked with him. 
                        This is a risk we can't afford to
                        take.

          Seybold considers him a beat, then --

                                        SEYBOLD
                        You're right.  Conditions change,
                        you adapt.
                                (to an Officer)
                        We're moving up the timetable by
                        24 hours.  We go tomorrow.

          Off Walt's surprise as Seybold crosses to his men...



          Starting on a DEVOTIONAL CANDLE near a PHOTO of Nora's
          father, then panning to a few of Nora's drawings and water
          colors, which depict angels, a child's view of heaven,
          and more disturbing images: bodies flying up out of graves.

          ON JOHNNY, seated on a child's bed, wrists cuffed behind
          him to a metal headboard, as he eyes the drawing.

                                        NORA
                        It's the Rapture.

          Johnny turns to see the little girl staring at him
            spookily, still holding her doll.

                                        NORA
                        Are you saved?

                        I don't know.

                                        NORA
                        If you're not saved, you don't

                        Rapture comes.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I hope that won't happen for a
                        long time.

                                        NORA
                        I hope it happens soon.

                        Why?

          Nora points to a CRAYON DRAWING - a mother, father, and a
          little girl happily holding hands atop a cloud.

                                        NORA
                        'Cause my Daddy's in heaven, so
                        when my Mommy and I get there,
                        we'll be a family again.

          It's a disturbing statement.  Johnny has to wonder if
          Nora hasn't been doubly traumatized, first by her father's
          murder, then by Carter's Apocalyptic preachings.

                                        LUCY (O.S.)
                        Nora.

          She's standing in the doorway, holding a tray with a bowl
          of soup.

                        Honey, go downstairs with the
                        other kids.

          Nora starts to go, then turns to look at Johnny again.

          Nora leaves, shutting the door.  Lucy puts the tray on a

                        You asked if I knew why my visions
                        led me here.

                                        LUCY
                        I can't talk about this.

                        Lucy, I came here because I saw
                        someone die.  A child.

    5858SUDDENLY IT IGNITES INTO A SCREEN-FILLING INFERNO

          We hear Carter's voice, quoting from the Bible, his words
          then ECHOED by a group of his followers.

                                        CARTER (V.O.)
                        "And I will give power unto my
                        two witnesses..."

                                        FOLLOWERS (V.O.)
                        "And I will give power unto my
                        two witnesses..."

          As now, within the inferno, we detect TWO FIGURES, one
          close, the other further way, gesturing angrily.

                                        BRUCE (V.O.)
                        I found out later they put
                          something in the water.



          TILTING UP from an empty WATER BOTTLE on the floor by a
          chair leg, to a ring of BLURRY and DISTORTED faces.  A
          man paces in the foreground, seen from the chest down, a
          Bible in his hand.

                                        CARTER
                        "And they shall prophesy a thousand
                        two hundred and threescore days,
                        clothed in sackcloth."


  6060WITHIN THE INFERNO

                                        FOLLOWERS (V.O.)

                        two hundred and threescore days,
                        clothed in sackcloth."

          Now we see that the first figure is Carter, wearing the
            sackcloth of a prophet.  As we approach the second...



            Revealing Bruce cuffed to a chair, sweating and disheveled,
          and, as Roger was before, ringed by Carter and a score of
          his followers, including Frankel.

                                        BRUCE (V.O.)
                        I guess the drugs... all that
                        Bible thumping... I started to
                          hallucinate.

                        I believed I was having a vision.

          Bruce's blinking dilated eyes turn to follow...

          HIS POV - CLOSE ON CARTER (DRUG-DISTORTED)

          As he circles Bruce.

                        "These are the two olive trees,
                        and the two candlesticks standing
                        before the God of the earth..."


  6262INFERNO VISION

          As camera now reveals the second figure.  It's Johnny,
            similarly robed in sackcloth.

                                        CARTER & FOLLOWERS (V.O.)
                        "And if any man will hurt them,
                        fire proceedeth out of their mouth,
                        and devoureth their enemies."

          And as we push in CLOSE on Johnny's angry features...



          As his eyes fly open.  He looks anxious, overwhelmed,
          clearly not in control of himself or his emotions.

                                        BRUCE
                        I saw them.

          Carter crouches beside him, puts a hand on his shoulder.

                                        CARTER
                        Good.  Very good.

                        That I'd seen the prophets from
                          Revelations, the ones who predict
                          Armageddon.  That one of them was
                        Carter, and the other was...



          Frankel reacts with disbelief.

                                        FRANKEL
                        Smith?  He's lying!

          Carter turns back to Bruce, his tone patient and soothing.

                                        CARTER
                        How could John Smith be the Second
                          Prophet?

          A beat, then it's like the words just burn their way out
          of Bruce -- the awful truth that's been eating him alive.

                                        BRUCE
                        Because he's seen it.  Johnny's
                        seen Armageddon.

          Frankel and the others react, but Carter looks like he
          was expecting it.  He nods gravely... as the moment is
          interrupted --

                                        STILLSON (V.O.)
                        Excuse me.



          Stillson's tone is disparaging, but there's a hint of
          genuine curiosity, and perhaps surprise, in his expression.

                                        STILLSON
                        Are you saying Mister Smith has
                        seen the end of the world?

          Bruce is trying to testify honestly about what happened,
          but he's not about to spill this secret to Stillson.

                                        BRUCE
                        No.  I'm saying I was
                          hallucinating.  I'd been drugged,
                        kept up half the night.  I saw
                        what Carter wanted me to see.

                        to convince the others of something
                        he already believed.

          from Seybold, who listens to a headset, confirms the

          FADE IN:


          Johnny steps in and washes his hands, as we HEAR a FLUSH
          and Stillson steps out from the far stall.  He hesitates
          as he sees Johnny, then joins him at the sinks.

                        Years ago, there would've been an

                        fluffy towel.  Now we've got sand

                        But I do.  I'm fascinated by
                        everything that goes on inside
                        that nutty head of yours.

                        It's my job to search for the
                        truth.

          Johnny can't help but smile, but it's a bitter smile.

                                        STILLSON
                          Something funny?

                                        JOHNNY
                        We both know why I'm here, and
                        why you wanted the media involved. 
                        So you could drag me around by
                        the neck and make yourself look
                        good.

                                        STILLSON
                                (adjusting his tie in

                        I think we both agree I look good.

                          A figurehead should look good.
                                (off his look)
                        Face it, Greg.  You're not calling
                        the shots anymore, are you?

                                        STILLSON
                        You think you know things, Smith. 
                        But you don't have a clue.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Then tell me: how does it feel to
                        be a pawn?  To trade the life of
                        a woman you said you loved for
                        another rung on the ladder to
                        power?

          Stillson's smirk vanishes.

                                        STILLSON
                        Leave my wife out of this.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Your wife?  She never made it to
                        the altar, remember?  And who saw
                        to that?  You?  Malcolm Janus?

          Stillson controls his anger.

                                        STILLSON
                        Like I said, Smith.  You think
                        you know things.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I know you're a killer.  Your
                        father, and now Miranda.  Someday
                        they'll all see you for what you
                        are.

                                        STILLSON
                                (checks watch)
                        We should get back.

          He starts out, but Johnny grabs his arm, then reacts to
            something awful shooting through the theater of his mind.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't know what you've got
                          planned, but I'm not going away. 
                        I'm going to be right there
                          waiting.

          Stillson yanks his arm away.

                                        STILLSON
                        I'm counting on it.

          Stillson walks out, leaving Johnny to consider those
          cryptic words.



          Moving with Johnny, who's no longer handcuffed, as two
          men, armed with AR-15s, escort him into the room where
          Carter's assembled the sect members.  A number of the men
          are armed with rifles.  A woman is bandaging one man's
          wounded arm.

          Johnny expects a hostile reception, but instead the crowd
          parts for him, people murmuring "John" and "The Other,"
            revealing Carter at the dais, Frankel by his side, also
          armed with a rifle.  Bruce sits in a chair, looking like
          he's been through a wringer.

                                        CARTER
                        Welcome back, John.  I'm sorry
                        about your confinement.

          Johnny ignores him, moves to Bruce's side.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Bruce?  You all right?

          Bruce is still shaky, but he's mostly suffering from guilt.

                                        BRUCE
                        I'm sorry.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What'd you do to him?

                                        CARTER
                        Opened his mind.  Then he opened
                        ours.

                                        BRUCE
                        I told them.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (confused)
                        The raid?

                                        BRUCE
                          Armageddon.

          And as Johnny reacts to this, Carter steps down.

                                        CARTER
                        Your coming was a sign, John.  As
                        sure as famine or war.  You and
                        I, we share the same destiny.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't know what you're talking
                        about.

                                        BRUCE
                        He thinks you're the "second
                          witness" from Revelations.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (remembering)
                        The two prophets...

                                        CARTER
                        "And if any man will hurt them,
                        fire proceedeth out of their
                        mouths, and devoureth their
                          enemies."
                                (beat)
                          Armageddon, John.  We've both
                        seen it.  Now it's here.

                                        JOHNNY
                        No.

                                        CARTER
                        You can't deny your own visions. 
                        Accept your role, as I've accepted
                        mine.

          Johnny eyes Carter's followers, their determined, fervent
            expressions, knows that somehow he has to reach them.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Do all of you believe I'm the
                        Second Prophet?  Do you believe I
                        can see the future?

          Nods and murmurs of assent from the group.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I have seen Armageddon.  Only
                        there weren't any angels, or
                          horsemen, or bodies of the
                          righteous flying up to Heaven.  I
                        saw fire.

          And as camera PANS to take in their reactions, we begin
          to SUPERIMPOSE images of the scenes Johnny describes.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Not God's fire.  The kind that
                        comes from man.

          Over which we see our classic Armageddon "beauty shot" of
          Washington being leveled by a massive fireball.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Our cities will be destroyed...

          Over which we see Christopher Wey surveying the dust-
          covered rubble that was once Baltimore ("Visions").

                                        JOHNNY
                        ...leaving a wasteland.  The dead*
                        will live only as memories...*

          As we see a 9-11-style wall of "missing" posters and
            handbills ("Finding Rachel: Part One").

                                        JOHNNY
                        ...and they'll be the lucky ones.*

          From the same show, we see flashes of deformed survivors,
          maybe even a flash of a burned and blind FUTURE JOHNNY.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Armageddon might be coming, but
                        it won't be God's doing, it'll be
                        ours.  Our choices.  Like the one*
                        you have today.  Ask yourselves
                        if it's worth risking your lives
                        so one man can call himself a
                          Prophet.
                                (looking around)
                        How about it, Lucy?

          LUCY's been standing with her arms lightly around her
          daughter's shoulders.  She looks away from Johnny but
            instinctively pulls Nora closer.  Johnny turns --

                                        JOHNNY
                        Jacob?  Is this really why you
                        didn't pull the trigger that night,
                        so you could pull it now?

          FRANKEL reacts, then exchanges a look with his pregnant
          wife and son.  Carter sees the group is wavering.  He
          tries to reassert control, stepping closer to Johnny.

                                        CARTER
                        You disappoint me, John.  You've
                        been given the gift of light, but
                        you choose to live in darkness. 
                        Join us and be saved.

          But as he puts his hands on Johnny's shoulders -- WHOOSH!


  7777FAST MOTION AS CARTER DISAPPEARS, THE SECT MEMBERS ARE

          Sounds of gunfire outside, controlled pandemonium in the
          room, two more wounded men being helped in -- as Vision
          Johnny watches.  Suddenly --

          FOUR INCENDIARY CHARGES go off in rapid succession on
          each of the four walls.  Just as the FLAMES fill the room --

          Vision Johnny walks past a frozen Roger and Lucy, tracing

          then zipping up to Carter, just as his finger hits the
          Enter key... pulling back to find Johnny watching.  WHOOSH!

                        people.  You're killing them!

          The sect members react with a mix of confusion and alarm. 
          Carter, stunned himself, is briefly speechless.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He's rigged this place with
                          explosives.  He's going to make
                        you into martyrs.

          The others turn to Carter.

                                        LUCY
                        Cyrus?

                        What does it matter how we
                          sacrifice our lives?  Babylon's 
                        fired the first salvo.  We've
                        seen the signs.  It's our time.

                                        FRANKEL
                        But what if it isn't?
                                (as Carter turns)
                        What if John was sent here to
                        tell us it's not our time.

          Carter stares at him like a wounded Caesar eyeing Brutus.

                                        CARTER
                        Jacob?  Are you doubting me, too?

                                        FRANKEL
                        We have families, Cyrus.  Children. 
                        What if you're wrong?

          Carter turns to another man, one of Johnny's guards.

                                        CARTER
                        Take his weapon.

          But the man just lowers his head.  The tide has turned. 
          Carter crossed to Frankel, wrenches his rifle away, then
          backs away and aims it wildly at his people.

                                        CARTER
                          Cowards!  You want salvation
                        without the sacrifice.  But God
                        has given me a mission, and I
                        won't shirk it.

          He rushes out.

                        There won't be time.  We've got
                        to get out.



          Carter mutters to himself as he sits at the computer and
            hurriedly calls up a password-protected screen, types in
          the passcode, muttering to himself as an ominous GRAPHIC
          of the compound comes up.

                                        CARTER
                        "And they went up on the breadth
                        of the earth, and compassed the
                        camp of the saints about, and the
                        beloved city..."

          Johnny and Bruce shut the door.  GUNFIRE continues to
          sound outside.  The sect members are bunched up fearfully,
          all of them coughing as SMOKE fills the building.

                        They shot at me and I'm not even
                        armed.

                                        JOHNNY
                        They're probably more scared than
                        we are.  Is there an exit they
                        don't know about?

                                        FRANKEL
                        In back, but the area around it's
                        mined.
                                (as Johnny reacts)
                        It was the only way to secure
                        that side of the compound.

                                        BRUCE
                        Do you know where the mines are?

                                        FRANKEL
                        There's a map, but Cyrus has the
                        only copy.

                                        JOHNNY
                        We'll have to risk it.



          Panning over more images of war, famine and cataclysm on
          the monitor, until we reach a small graphics window that
          displays an "Execute" button, already selected.

                        of heaven... and devoured them."

          Carter's index finger hovers over the Enter key.  A last
          Sergio Leone close-up of his maddened eyes, then he hits
          the key.  The room EXPLODES.



          Lucy is testifying.

                        He may've saved all of us.  I
                        know that those of us who shot at
                        the officers will be tried, but
                        none of us wanted to fight.  We
                        just wanted to be left alone to
                          practice our beliefs.

                                (somber beat)
                        Thank you for your testimony, Ms.
                        Caron.  Madame Chairman, would
                        you agree we've heard enough?

          The Chairwoman considers, then nods.
