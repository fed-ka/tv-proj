RUSS
I started working on some 
projections last night.

BERNIE
Okay.4.


RUSS
How often do Lina and I have sex?  
How many more years can we have it 
for?   How many times will we do it 
before we die?  I extrapolated that 
we only did it twice last summer, 
multiplied that by let's say 
optimistically 33 remaining summers 
of functional equipment.  Factoring 
in vacation sex, wine tastings, 
etc.

Putting pressure on her isn t going 
to make things any better.  

RUSS
So what do I do?

BERNIE
All I can say is Cindy and I have a 
lot in common. 

RUSS
So do we.

BERNIE
Maybe you need more.

Russ considers it.
