                based coffee is no longer fit for rich 

                human consumption.  Which means one of us

                beans every single week.

                Gale only gave me one day off -- I guess 

                 cause he loves me so much he can t be 

                away from me -- so we re just gonna grab 

                dinner then hit a go-kart track.

                                  ALI

                Don t be silly.  You just keep doing the 

                job you re doing and you won t be driving
