  The corpse of the Murmillo is dragged away. ADJUST to find 
  ASHUR and DAGAN watching. Ashur swallows hard at the sight, 
  nerves threatening to unravel.

                        Your hour is upon you.

  They look over to find OENOMAUS approaching with their 
  swords. A gladius for Dagan, the curved sword of a Thraex 
  for Ashur. Ashur tests the weight of it, blustering to 
  bolster courage.

                                        ASHUR
                        A fine blade. To be wielded with 
                        deadly purpose.

  Oenomaus glares at Ashur, unimpressed by the bravado.

  Dagan s eyes narrow in contempt, not liking that.

                        Your true test awaits you. Live,

                        Dagan says he will honor the House

                        will the mighty Ashur.

  Oenomaus sizes him up, doubting his boast.

  Oenomaus exits. Ashur s confidence falters as we PRE-LAP the

  CLOSE ON the bust of MAGNETIUS (referenced in Episode HB2)

                                        TITUS (O.S.)
                        Magnetius. One of the finest 
                        champions this house has ever 
                        forged.

  WIDEN TO REVEAL Titus studying the stone face. Batiatus 
  hovers next to Gannicus. GUARDS are posted at the doors.

                                        BATIATUS
                                  lacking enthusiasm)(
                      He stood a titan.

                                        TITUS
                      As all my champions. The 
                        culmination of years of training. 
                        Dedication. Sacrifice.
                                (pointedly, to 
                                  Gannicus)
                        You would hold yourself their 
                        equal?

                                        GANNICUS
                      In the arena, I am every man s 
                        equal.

                                        TITUS
                        A champion is more than his 
                        victories upon the sands. He is the 
                        sum of his actions. Every decision, 
                      no matter how small, speaks to the 
                        man. And the balance of his heart.

  Batiatus thumps Gannicus  chest.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Beneath his breast beats the heart 
                      of a lion.

  Titus  eyes remain on Gannicus, judging his every fiber.

                                        TITUS
                        And what does it beat for?

  Gannicus considers the question.

                                        GANNICUS
                                by rote)(
                        The House of Batiatus.

  Titus weighs his response. Gives away nothing.

                                        TITUS
                                to Guards)(
                        Return him to the ludus.

  Gannicus exchanges a concerned look with Batiatus as he s 
  led out. Batiatus puts on his best face for his father, 
  launches into the hard sell.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You see? The man fights for the 
                        honor of this house. As all your 
                        champions have in the past.

                                        TITUS
                        Gannicus speaks but words he knows 
                        I seek to hear. He is no champion 
                      of my house.

  Titus exits. OFF BATIATUS, smoldering...



  Gaia complains to Lucretia as Melitta pours wine.

                                        GAIA
                        I stand before Petronius with 
                        obvious charms, and all he can do 
                      is prattle about the House of 
                        Batiatus. I fear I have lost 
                        delicate touch.

                      If word of what we have offered 
                        here has spread to Petronius, how 
                        long before it lights upon Titus  
                        ear?

                        Perhaps it should. The shock would 
                      no doubt end the old goat.

                        elite.

                        whisper of the delights offered 
                        within these walls. Delights 
                        Petronius and his friends long to

                      To even consider it is beyond 
                        reason. If Titus were to discover 
                        such a thing --

                        What joy does my father prevent 
                        now?

  The women turn to find Batiatus entering the room, still 
  fuming from his father s low opinion of Gannicus.

                        name...?

  Lucretia shoots her a withering look, not wishing to broach 
  the subject. Gaia ignores it.

  A GUARD escorts Melitta through the barracks. Gannicus steps 
  from the baths, half naked. His heart catching at the 
  unexpected sight of her. Melitta continues on without even a

                                          MELITTA
                      As you should mine. Lest suspicions 
                      be aroused.

                                        GANNICUS
                        Will they not also be raised, if 
                        two friends are no longer seen to 
                        speak?

  Melitta considers that, reluctantly nods. Gannicus struggles 
  to find the right words.

                                          GANNICUS(cont'd)
                        What happened between us --

                                          MELITTA
                        Was not of our choosing. We must 
                        turn it from thought, and never 
                        give it voice.

                                        GANNICUS
                      My tongue bends to such warning.
                                  a beat, soft)(
                        Yet the thought of you... It proves 
                        troublesome.

  Melitta sees a rare glimpse of emotion in Gannicus. 
    Uncertainty. Genuine attraction. She looks away, not wanting 
  Gannicus to see how affected she is.

                                          MELITTA
                        The memory will fade with time. As 
                      do all things born of misfortune.

  Melitta rejoins the Guard. Gannicus watches her drift away 
  to Oenomaus  cell, longing and regret swelling in his eyes.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    16.

                                        OENOMAUS (PRELAP)
                      We were as brothers once. But no 
                        more.



  Melitta lies naked with Oenomaus, half-listening, the 
  exchange with Gannicus weighing heavily.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        The men no longer accept me as a 
                        gladiator. And do not yet give 
                        respect as doctore. Even Gannicus 
                        refuses to heed my instruction.

                                          MELITTA
                        Gannicus heeds nothing but his own 
                        desires, beyond all reason. You 
                        must teach him that you alone are 
                      in command. You must take control.

  Melitta straddles Oenomaus, her lips inches from his.

                                          MELITTA(cont'd)
                        And by firm hand, erase all doubts.

  She kisses him.

                                          MELITTA(cont'd)
                        Show them all the man I have given 
                      my heart to.

  She devours him, desperately attempting to wipe her own 
  thoughts of Gannicus from her mind. Oenomaus is surprised by 
  her passion, but quickly responds in kind. He flips her 
  over, pinning her down.

  MELITTA GASPS

  as he roughly enters her. Her nails dig into his back, 
  urging him to thrust harder. SLOWLY PUSH IN on Melitta s 
  face as she struggles to give herself over to the moment. To 
  erase her doubt. As her eyes close...



  Gruel slops into a bowl as the men take evening meal. 
  RHASKOS snorts to Gnaeus as he passes.

                                          RHASKOS
                        Snare any fish today in your little 
                        net?

  The men chuckle. Gnaeus seethes. ANGLE ON Ashur and Dagan, 
  receiving coin from Oenomaus.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Reward, for victory in the arena. 
                        Continue and see more weigh palm.

  Dagan grins, receiving twice as much as Ashur.

                                        DAGAN
                                in Aramaic)(

  Ashur frowns sourly, mistranslates.

                                        ASHUR
                        Dagan questions receiving the 
                        greater sum. We stood equally upon 
                        the sands.

  Oenomaus dismantles Ashur with cutting eyes.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    21.

                        Tell him he earns twice your 
                        coin... because you are half the 
                        man.

                                        ASHUR
                        I am a gladiator, as he is.

                                        OENOMAUS
                      If you were not needed to exchange 
                        our words for his, you would never 
                        have been given chance to take up 
                        sword.

  Oenomaus moves away. Ashur seethes. Crixus passes with a 
  crust of bread in hand, WIPING US TO --



  The din of the men s VOICES echoes through to the barracks, 
  where Barca sits alone, cradling one of Auctus  birds. A 
  small reminder of his fallen lover.

                                        CRIXUS (O.S.)
                        Bread.

  Barca looks up to find Crixus in the doorway with his crust 
  of bread.

                                        CRIXUS
                        For your pets.

  Barca stares with deadened eyes, says nothing. Crixus turns 
  to go, pauses.

                        our father and all before us. I 
                        would listen at their feet to their 
                        many tales of battle. Longing for 
                        the day I was of an age to take up 
                        arms and stand with them in glory.

                        and scrape. First to the shits that 
                        took my family from me. Then to the

                        remembered.

  Crixus sets the bread down next to Barca, turns to go.

                                        BARCA

                        Now they are all that is left.

  Barca picks up Crixus  peace offering of bread, feeds it to 
  the bird he s holding. OFF the unlikely bond forming between 
  the two men...



  SLAVES bustle as final preparations are made for Petronius 
  and his guests. DIONA absently lights a row of candles, her 
  own glow considerably dimmed. She finishes, doesn t blow her 
  stick out. Watches detached as the flame licks her fingers.

                                        NAEVIA (O.S.)
                        Diona.

  She blows it out as NAEVIA approaches. Naevia grabs her 
  hand, inspecting Diona s fingers with worry.

                      It does not hurt.

  Naevia sadly watches Diona as she disappears into the 
  atrium, passing Lucretia and Melitta as they enter. 
  Lucretia, dressed in her finest gown, hands Melitta a list.

  Melitta exits as Gaia sweeps into the room, resplendent in 
  her RED WIG. She takes Lucretia in with an appreciative 
  smile.

                        and I among the roots and leaves.

  Gaia takes Lucretia s hands.

                        and aid yours in seizing position 
                      so richly deserved.

  Gaia kisses Lucretia. A sincere gesture of love. As she 
  pulls back she spots SOLONIUS entering across the room, 
    unencumbered by attending slaves.

                                          GAIA(cont'd)

                        soon forgotten.

  Gaia moves to Solonius. Lucretia lingers, the hint of worry 
  refusing to vacate her eyes. PRE-LAP: The GRUNTS of SEX 
  rise.

  A DOZEN GLADIATORS

  stand off to the side on display. Stripped to their 
    subligarias. Hardened bodies glistening with scented oils. 
  TRACK past Barca, Dagan, Ashur, Gnaeus, and Crixus, who 
  stares wide eyed at the proceedings. Come to rest on

  GANNICUS,

  who ignores the show in favor of Melitta across the room 
  with Lucretia, Gaia, and Solonius. Gannicus quickly averts 
  his gaze as

  OENOMAUS

  passes by. His hand tightens on his whip, barely concealing 
  his displeasure with such a dishonorable event. Melitta 
  catches the look, forces a pained smile of support as she 
  pours more wine for Gaia.

                        surpasses in enthusiasm. They are 
                        well received.

  Solonius squirms, obviously uncomfortable with this.

                                        SOLONIUS
                      As are all things born of base 
                        desire.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Apologies. We ask too much of you 
                      in this, yet your presence is of 
                        much comfort.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        The situation forces us all into 
                        actions otherwise never considered. 
                        The blame lies in the Fates, 
                        absolving weighted heart.

  Rhaskos thrusts harder. The Girl GASPS in pain, her mask 
  falling off to reveal DIONA. Her eyes find Naevia, who moves 
  among the Romans with an amphora of wine. Its purpose 
  forgotten in her hands as tears well in her eyes. Diona 
  looks away in shame.

  NAEVIA

  notices one of the Roman s eyes crawling over her. Her heart 
  seizes in her chest. She starts as Melitta appears at her 
  side, taking the amphora and handing her an empty.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    27.

                                          MELITTA
                        See this to the pantry.
                                  soft)(
                        And remain there until I call upon 
                        you, after all have left.

  Naevia registers surprise and relief.

                                          MELITTA(cont'd)
                        Go.

  Naevia complies, sparing a pained look back at Diona before 
  exiting. Oenomaus joins Melitta, his eyes flashing disgust 
  as he whispers to her.

                                        OENOMAUS
                      We dishonor this house.

                                          MELITTA
                      We but do as commanded.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        The cause does not alter result.

                                          MELITTA
                        No. Yet we must move beyond it, or 
                      be driven to madness.

  Melitta steals a glance at Gannicus as she returns to 
  Lucretia s side, her words meant to convince herself as well 
  as her husband.

  RHASKOS

  grabs Diona s hair as his thrusts increase in intensity.

                                          PETRONIUS
                                  laughing)(
                        The man fucks as a bull, horns to 
                        purpose.

  Diona grunts in pain as he climaxes. Petronius and the 
  Romans APPLAUD as Rhaskos dismounts, leaving a humiliated 
  Diona to gather her robes. Gaia nudges Lucretia forward to 
  address the guests.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Gratitude to all for gracing the 
                        House of Batiatus with esteemed 
                        presence. One my husband regrets he 
                        cannot share, due to pressing 
                        business.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    28.

  Petronius eyes Diona and Rhaskos with a lurid grin.

                                          PETRONIUS
                        I had not noticed his absence.

  The other Guests laugh in agreement.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        What you have seen is but a taste 
                      of the pleasures afforded you 
                        beneath humble roof. Our 
                        gladiators, our slaves, everything 
                        within these walls, I place at the 
                        whims of your desire. For a single 
                        night, you are the masters of this 
                        house.

                                          TULLIUS (O.S.)
                      An enticing offer.

  Lucretia turns, shocked to find Tullius entering. Cold eyes 
  belying warm smile.

                                          TULLIUS
                        One I would see to full advantage.

                        Tullius.

  Her heart claws into her throat. Solonius stiffens in 
  surprise next to an intrigued Gaia. OFF LUCRETIA, forcing a 
  smile to disguise rising fear...

                                        TITUS (PRELAP)
                        I have never cared for surprises.



  CLOSE ON a cup being filled with wine. PULL BACK TO FIND 
  Titus and Batiatus seated in a cramped, seedy tavern.

                                        TITUS
                        And you have provided many in your 
                        day.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Your disappointment has often been 
                        given voice. A loud, clear one.

  Batiatus downs his cup, pours another.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    29.

                                        TITUS
                          Disappointment can only exist upon 
                        expectation. You proved from tender 
                        age you would listen to no one s 
                        counsel save your own.

  Batiatus laughs at the ridiculousness of the statement.

                                        BATIATUS
                        When did I ever turn from iron 
                        advice? A desire to gain military 
                        experience raised your objection. 
                        And I turned from it. You commanded 
                        I run the ludus in your absence. I 
                        obeyed, abandoning my own desires, 
                        now long forgotten. When has son 
                        ever denied the father?

  Titus replies, more with sympathy than anger.

                                        TITUS
                        When he married a woman beneath 
                        him.

  A tense beat. Batiatus drinks, replies softly.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You were wrong about her. As you 
                        have been of many things.

  Titus feels the truth in that. A sad smile creeps across his 
  face.

                                        TITUS
                      An old man s mistakes swell in the 
                        breast, as remaining days shrink.

                                        BATIATUS
                                  snorts)(
                        You will outlive us all. You are 
                        too stubborn to die.

  Titus chuckles, takes a sip of wine.

                                        TITUS
                      Do you think me a fool, Quintus?

                                        BATIATUS
                        There are many words I would use 
                        towards your description. Fool 
                        lives not among them.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    30.

                                        TITUS
                        No, it is not. You knew those 
                        slaves were shit before we ever set 
                        foot to path. The purchase of men 
                        was not the reason you parted me 
                        from the ludus, was it?

  Batiatus tenses, fearing his ruse has been discovered. But 
  Titus laughs warmly, clasping his son s arm.

                                          TITUS(cont'd)
                        You wish to find common ground, far 
                        from the site of former 
                          disagreements.

  Batiatus returns the smile, tension fading.

                                        BATIATUS
                      My deception meant only to 
                        strengthen bond between father and 
                        son.

                                        TITUS
                        This surprise is one most welcome. 
                        And long overdue.

  Batiatus musters a smile, feeling the guilt of his lie.

                                          TITUS(cont'd)
                                  laughs, rises)(
                        Yet we did not need to travel so 
                        far from comfort. I would return 
                        home, and continue in warmer 
                          surroundings.

                                        BATIATUS
                                  surprised)(
                        Now? Should we not wait until break 
                      of day?

                                        TITUS
                        A few hours upon the road, and our 
                        own beds to fall to. Come. Let us 
                        put this wretched city behind us, 
                        and embrace closer future.

  OFF BATIATUS  worry of returning home too soon...                                                                                    31.



  Tullius laughs and drinks with Petronius and several other 
  Guests. He glances across the room to where Lucretia, Gaia, 
  and Solonius huddle. Appraises Gaia with an admiring eye.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        How does that man find himself

                        Petronius, or perhaps loose tongue 
                      of his confederates...

  Gaia smiles at Tullius as she whispers to Lucretia.

                                        GAIA
                        His presence changes nothing.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      It upends the fucking earth.

                        I will break words, and gauge 
                        intent.

  Solonius moves off, concern creasing troubled brow.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      To stand with a smile in our 
                        fucking house. After the injury put 
                      to my husband.

                                        GAIA
                        Force him from thought, or see 
                        effort and risk fall short of 
                        reward. Petronius and his guests 
                        stand erect with expectation. Let 
                      us see them to climax.

  Lucretia steels her nerves, whispers to Melitta.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Bring them out.

  Melitta nods, moves off. Lucretia eyes Tullius across the 
  room with barely concealed hatred as Solonius joins him. 
  Solonius sips his wine, casually enters into conversation.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Good Tullius. Finding you here 
                        comes a surprise.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    32.

  Solonius tightens, lowering his voice to an agitated hiss.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        I warned you of Batiatus  
                        maneuverings not as invitation, but 
                      in hopes you would prevent such 
                        foolishness. And the retribution 
                        against valued friend it would 
                        bring.

  Tullius  eyes darken, although his smile remains constant.

                                          TULLIUS
                        You warned me to grow favor. 
                        Continue speaking and see it 
                        wither.

  Solonius squirms as Lucretia steps forward with the GOLD 
  MASK OF APOLLO in her hand (similar to the one in ep 109, 
  season 1). Melitta and Slave Girls stand behind her with 
  trays of more masks. Jupiter, Neptune, Mars -- enough for 
  all the guests.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        You have shared drink. Food. 
                        Distraction for eye and ear. Yet 
                        these are common things. Enjoyed by 
                        men bound by accusing morality of 
                        their deeds.

  She directs that barb at Tullius, wrapped in a warm smile.

                        I would see you freed from such 
                        human constraints.

  She motions Melitta and the Slaves to distribute the masks.

                                          LUCRETIA(cont'd)
                        Touch these to flesh. Sever all 
                        ties from the mortal world. And 
                        rise as gods in the House of 
                        Batiatus.

  The Romans clamor, eyeing the Gladiators and half-naked 
  Slaves hungrily. Petronius takes the mask of Jupiter.

                                          PETRONIUS

                      so elevated.

                                          TULLIUS
                        This house is truly a marvel. Yet 
                      if I am to assume mantle of a god, 
                        I would first prove myself against 
                        one.

  His eyes land on Gannicus. Lucretia tightens.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        You would challenge Gannicus?

                        A harmless exhibition. To measure 
                        humble skill against vaunted 
                        prowess.

                                          PETRONIUS
                        I would pause in my desires, to 
                        witness such a thing.

  The other Guests chime in their drunken agreement. Lucretia 
  knows this is a bad idea, but Tullius has forced her hand.

                        rings through the halls of Olympus, 
                      is it not?

  More drunken agreement from the Romans. Lucretia reluctantly 
  nods to the house Guards.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Give them your swords.

  One Guard gives his weapon to Tullius, the other to 
  Gannicus.

                        Let us clear space, and have 
                        contest!

  Gannicus grins, feeling the weight of his sword. Oenomaus 
  hisses in his ear.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    34.

                      -- but level no insult nor injury 
                      in return. Such action would bear 
                        unfortunate consequence.

  Gannicus absorbs the gravity of that.

                                        GANNICUS
                      So I am to lose?

                        Come! Let us see if I recall what I 
                        learned, years ago in service to 
                        the Republic.

  CAMERA CIRCLES as Tullius and Gannicus face off. Gannicus 
  catches Melitta s worried look as Tullius attacks. A simple 
  exchange, easily deflected. Tullius laughs, shoots a warm 
  smile Gaia s way.

  STEEL FLASHES

  as Tullius attacks again. Faster. Light-hearted nature 
  fading as he DRAWS BLOOD. Melitta tenses. Lucretia seizes 
  Gaia s hand in concern. The Romans APPLAUD. Tullius plays to 
  them with a laugh.

                                          TULLIUS(cont'd)
                        Ah. It begins to return to me.

  Tullius grins at Gaia, showing off for her. Tullius circles 
  Gannicus, his eyes dancing with malevolent intent. Gannicus 
  is at a sizable disadvantage since he can only defend. 
  Tullius unleashes a deadly volley, lands another cut. BLOOD 
  FLOWS.

  GANNICUS

  grits his teeth against the pain. Crixus and the other 
  Gladiators eye the contest with mounting concern. Tullius 
  unloads a series of thunderous blows, drawing more blood. 
  Tullius pulls Gannicus close as their swords lock.

                                          TULLIUS(cont'd)
                                  whispered)(
                        I stand unscathed. Perhaps you are 
                        not the champion I believed.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    35.

  Gannicus snarls, shoves Tullius away. The Romans TITTER 
  Tullius chuckles, delighted at getting a rise.

                        The man finally shows life.

  Gannicus shoots a look to Oenomaus, who shakes his head just 
  enough to send private warning. You cannot strike back. 
  Gannicus buries his rage as Tullius presses his assault, 
  repeatedly drawing blood.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        This goes too far.

  Lucretia looks to Solonius. He averts his eyes, powerless to 
  intercede. Tullius slices open Gannicus  chest and smashes 
  him in the face with his hilt, sending him to his knees.

  GANNICUS,

  beaten and bloodied, looks to Melitta. Swallows all his 
  pride, holds up two fingers. The MISSIO. Tullius ignores it, 
  rearing back to end Gannicus and the affront he represents.

                                          LUCRETIA(cont'd)
                        Tullius!

  Tullius whips furious eyes to Lucretia. Silence grips the 
  room. Lucretia smiles, trying to be diplomatic.

                                          LUCRETIA(cont'd)
                        Apologies. The man gives the 
                        missio. The match is yours.

  A tense beat. Tullius laughs, lowering his sword. Melitta 
  remembers to breathe.

                                          TULLIUS
                        A god of the arena. Saved by a 
                        woman.

  The air returns to the room as Petronius and his Guests join 
  in Tullius  amusement. Gannicus seethes, blood dripping.

                                        LUCRETIA

  Oenomaus helps Gannicus up, motions for a Guard to escort 
  Melitta. Petronius steps forward as they exit with Gannicus.

  The Romans applaud. Lucretia nods in thanks, her eyes 
  flicking nervously to Tullius as he steps forward.

  Tullius takes the golden mask of Apollo from Lucretia s 
  hands with a knowing smile. He brings the mask up to his 
  face, WIPING US TO --



  TIGHT ON A WOUND tended by frail, dirty hands. PULL BACK to 
  reveal a WITHERED MEDICUS as he finishes treating Gannicus  
  injuries. He shuffles past Melitta, exiting to dispose of 
  soiled rags and a bowl of bloody water.

                                          MELITTA
                        That fucking animal. To turn simple 
                        exhibition to blood.

  Gannicus painfully sits up.

                        I could have ended the man in half

                        Yet you allowed him to nearly kill 
                        you?

  He sees the genuine concern in her eyes. Is affected by it.

                                        GANNICUS
                        I was ordered not to raise hand.

  Gannicus half grins, breaking the moment.

  safe distance between them.

                                          MELITTA

  Gannicus rises, narrowing the gap between them. Needing to

  She struggles with the question, her own guilt over 
  unexpected feelings for Gannicus swirling in her eyes. She 
  averts them, unable to hold his gaze.

  He pulls her into a TIME STOPPING, EARTH SHATTERING KISS. 
  Melitta responds, caught in the moment. She pulls away, 
  regaining herself. Shocked at her own longing. She turns and 
  quickly exits, seized by guilt. OFF GANNICUS, hope and shame 
  mixing in equal measure...



  Petronius and his Guests, faces obscured by the masks of the

  ASHUR AND DAGAN

  stand with DURATIUS, a young muscular gladiator, and a few 
  other men waiting to be chosen. A short ROMAN wearing the 
  mask of MARS approaches, taking in Dagan with hungry eyes.

  Dagan looks to Ashur in confusion.

  stirring hateful feelings of earlier slight.

  Ashur hesitates, his conscience making a brief appearance, 
  then mistranslates to Dagan.

                                        ASHUR
                                in Aramaic)(
                      Hu Haze lakh yatir gavra minni. [He 
                        finds you more a man than I.]

                                        DAGAN
                                  laughs, in Aramaic)(
                         Ena shapirta, haden. [A fine eye, 
                        this one.]

  The slight burns Ashur even more. He turns to the Roman, all 
  hesitation gone.

                                        ASHUR
                      He is agreeable.

                        Come then. I would have your ass 
                        quickly.

  Dagan s mirth fades.

                                        DAGAN
                                in Aramaic)(

                      He tells me he hopes you are not of

                        this craves rough hands, and cock

  Duratius glances at Ashur, wondering if that is really what 
  Dagan just said.

                                        MASKED ROMAN
                        Then he shall be well satisfied. 
                        Come.

  Dagan shoots Ashur a worried look as he s led off. Ashur 
  allows himself a dark smile. Melitta passes, returning from 
  Gannicus. Oenomaus intercepts her.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        How does he fare?

                                          MELITTA
                        Painfully. Yet he lives.

                                        OENOMAUS
                      It should not have happened.

                                          MELITTA
                      To be said of many things this 
                        night.

  Melitta turns away, the guilt of the kiss swelling. She 
  quickly moves across the room to join Lucretia, Gaia, and 
  Solonius. Lucretia eyes Tullius standing quietly amid the 
  debauchery. Watching through the Golden Mask of Apollo.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      He does not drink. He does not 
                        fuck. Why does he remain?

                                        GAIA
                        The man is a mystery.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        One I would have forever solved.
                                to Solonius)(
                        You gauged nothing of his intent?

                                        SOLONIUS
                      He fears your husband attempts 
                        maneuver. I believe his presence is 
                        meant only to rattle nerves.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Would that were the end of it. 
                        Tullius will give voice to this 
                        until the din reaches Titus.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    41.

                        Then we must keep his tongue 
                        occupied.

  Gaia s eyes sparkle with salacious intent.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        You believe your charms will sway 
                        him?

                                        GAIA
                        You know nothing of women, 
                        Solonius. And even less of their 
                        charms.

  Gaia smiles at Tullius across the room. Tullius removes his 
  mask, returning it warmly.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        I would not ask you to do this.

                                        GAIA
                        That is why I offer.

                                        SOLONIUS
                                  not buying it)(
                        The only reason?

  Gaia gives him a withering look.

                                        GAIA
                        The man proves troublesome thorn. 
                        Who better to remove it than 
                        trusted friend?

                        Keep thoughts towards elevating

                        Tullius... and in the act secure 
                        elevation of my own. To the benefit 
                      of all.

  She kisses Lucretia and moves to join Tullius.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        The woman thinks highly of herself.

  OFF LUCRETIA, radiating appreciation and love for her 
  friend...



  Silky fabrics have been draped from the ceiling. Overstuffed 
  trunks spread out here and there, other wigs on display. 
  Gaia enters, a cup of wine in her hand, a laugh on her lips. 
  Tullius follows, his mask discarded.

                                        GAIA
                        You have become a difficult man to 
                        gain private audience with. It was 
                        not always so.

                                          TULLIUS
                        Much has changed since our youth.

  Gaia takes him in with a coy smile.

                                        GAIA
                        Not everything I hope.

  He returns her smile with genuine affection.

                                          TULLIUS
                        I remember a time when you were the 
                        one impossible to trap alone. Every 
                        man in Capua was at your feet.

                                        GAIA
                        Now I would have but one. Standing 
                        beside me.

  It s a charged moment, perfect for a kiss, but Tullius 
  shifts the conversation.

                                          TULLIUS
                        I was saddened to hear of your 
                        husband s passing.

                                        GAIA
                        Were you?

  A knowing smile tugs at her lips. Tullius laughs, caught in 
  the lie.

                                          TULLIUS
                        Only towards thought of you. Once 
                        again with no family to speak of. 
                      No one to care for you.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    43.

                      To find a man who stands my equal.

  Tullius grins in appreciation, favoring her boldness. He 
  gently touches the red hair of her wig, considering it.

                                          TULLIUS
                        I always favored this color.

                        I know.

  She kisses him. He responds, passions rising. Guides her 
  down to the bed. Hands exploring...

                                          TULLIUS
                        The gods smile upon me, having had 
                        word of this evening reach my ears.

                                        GAIA
                        The fortune is mine.

  Gaia lets him open her dress, exposing her bare breasts.

                                          GAIA(cont'd)
                        Yet I would have word travel no 
                        further.

  Tullius pauses, eyes narrowing.

                                          TULLIUS
                        You petition this for yourself? Or 
                        the House of Batiatus?

  Gaia speaks lightly, but with great calculation behind it.

                                        GAIA
                        Lucretia is as a sister to me. I 
                        would not see her injured by 
                        wagging tongue.

  Tullius kisses her softly, his hands caressing her breasts.

                                          TULLIUS
                        You ask much.

                                        GAIA
                        I offer more...

  Her hand slips beneath Tullius  robes. Tullius reacts, 
  kissing her roughly. She responds in kind. Two predators 
  devouring each other.

                                          TULLIUS
                        I swear I will never speak of what

  OFF THE DEVIL S BARGAIN...



  The festivities are over. Petronius and the last lingering 
  Guests are escorted to the door by Lucretia and Solonius.

                                          PETRONIUS
                        Words have not inflated beyond 
                        truth. The offerings of the House 
                      of Batiatus are truly to be 
                        admired.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Even more so upon the sands. 
                        Imagine the excitement our wares 
                        would cause, if included in opening 
                        celebration of the new arena.

  Petronius gives a satisfied CHUCKLE.

                                          PETRONIUS
                        Capua would be blessed by such 
                        appearance. I will send word to 
                        your husband to discuss the matter.

  Petronius exits with the last of his Guests. Lucretia sags 
  in relief.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        I thought this night never to end.

                      It concludes with this house 
                        soaring to the heavens, upon your 
                        wings.

  Solonius forces a smile, the guilt of his actions with 
  Tullius weighing on his conscience.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        The evening would have gone as well 
                        had I never known. Perhaps more so.

                        The hour is late. Take to your bed, 
                        and carry with you my gratitude.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        I would linger, until all guests 
                        have departed.

  His eyes shift towards the villa, concerned with Tullius 
  still within.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Gaia is a woman of great appetite. 
                        Dawn will threaten before she has 
                        had her fill.

  Solonius reluctantly nods. Starts to head out. Pauses.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Lucretia?

  She turns back. Solonius looks to her with great affection.

                                          SOLONIUS(cont'd)
                        This house. It would be pale 
                        shadow, absent your light.

  Solonius musters a smile, exits before she can respond. OFF 
  LUCRETIA, glowing from the praise...



  Naevia and other Slaves return the villa to order. Naevia 
  glances over at a deadened Diona, who avoids her look. 
  Lucretia passes with Melitta in tow as they enter the 
  deserted trophy room.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        See everything restored to proper 
                        place. Nothing must be suspected.

  Melitta s thoughts drift to her kiss with Gannicus.

                                          MELITTA
                        Yes, domina.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    46.
  CONTINUED:

  Lucretia catches the troubled look, misinterprets.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        I know you feel it is a betrayal. 
                        Yet there are times when the truth 
                      is more hurtful. Titus must never 
                        know.

                                          MELITTA
                        Domina.

  Melitta moves off. Lucretia starts to leave, pauses. The 
  GOLD MASK OF APOLLO is resting on the flat surface of the 
  bust of Magnetius. She picks it up, eyeing it with a faint 
  smile. She and Gaia have pulled off the impossible.

                                          TULLIUS (O.S.)
                        Apollo.

  Lucretia turns, surprised to see Tullius appearing from the 
  shadows. She tenses, tries to hide it. Not wanting to give 
  Tullius the satisfaction of knowing he frightens her.

                                          TULLIUS
                        God of the sun.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        And truth.

  Tullius takes the mask of Apollo from Lucretia s hands.

                                          TULLIUS
                        Something often obscured by the 
                        masks we wear.

  Lucretia swallows. Nervous. Looks around the empty room.

                                          TULLIUS(cont'd)
                        Your guests have abandoned you. I 
                        thought the toad Solonius would at 
                        least remain.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        The hour is late. He believed you 
                        occupied for the night.

  He nods. Runs a finger across the mask.

                                          TULLIUS
                        They say Apollo brings warmth and 
                        prosperity, to those who would pray 
                      to him. Those who understand their 
                        place. On their knees.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    47.
  CONTINUED:

  He locks eyes with her. Lucretia is clearly terrified. Tries 
  to hide it with a disarming smile.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Tullius --

                                          TULLIUS
                        Did you know I often dreamt of 
                        Gaia s touch, when I was a younger 
                        man? The taste of her lips. Now 
                        they form words in ear, asking 
                        favor for this house. Placing me in 
                        difficult position.

  Lucretia sees a crack in Tullius  armor. Moves to exploit 
  it.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Gaia s affections for this house 
                        are genuine. As are those she holds 
                        for you.

                                          TULLIUS
                                  soft)(
                        Returned in kind.

  He hands the mask of Apollo back to Lucretia with a warm 
  smile.

                                          TULLIUS(cont'd)
                        She holds my reply. Go to her, and 
                        see it delivered.

  Tullius exits. A smile begins to bloom. Gaia has done the 
  impossible. OFF LUCRETIA s relief...



  Lucretia rushes in, overjoyed.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Gaia --

  She freezes in horror, the words constricting in her throat. 
  REVERSE to find

  GAIA DEAD,

  her naked body splattered with blood. Limp arm hanging off 
  the bed. Battered face half turned towards Lucretia. 
  Lifeless eyes staring open. Her wig lays on the floor, 
  dislodged by the violence.                                                                                    48.


  EXTREME LOW ANGLE

  as the mask of Apollo slips forgotten from Lucretia s grasp. 
  It falls towards CAMERA, WIPING US TO --



  Titus rails at Batiatus. Lucretia sits with tears streaking 
  her face, shell-shocked.

                                        TITUS
                        Have you lost mind!?! Again 
                        attempting to maneuver around 
                        Tullius?

                                        BATIATUS
                        I only sought to elevate our 
                        position --

                                        TITUS
                      By plunging the good name of this 
                        house into muck and shit!

                                        BATIATUS
                        What would you have me do? Bow and 
                        scrape to that fucking lunatic?

                                        TITUS
                      He is above our station! I gave 
                        warning not to provoke the man. You 
                        ignore it and here are the results. 
                        A Roman citizen. Dead in my house.

                                        LUCRETIA
                                  soft)(
                      By the hands of the very man you 
                        defend.

  Titus levels a withering glare.

                                        TITUS
                        You help set this in motion, and 
                        now claim innocence in the outcome?

  Lucretia stands, grief giving way to anger.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        I claim vengeance. His life for 
                        hers. Blood and brains upon the 
                        fucking floor.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    49.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Reward well deserved.

                                        TITUS
                        No. There will be no retribution.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        I will see him dead!

                                        TITUS
                        You will do as fucking commanded!

  A tense beat. Lucretia calms, the fight draining out of her.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        And what of Gaia?

  Titus considers the question, comes to a solution.

                                        TITUS
                        She partook of too much wine, as 
                        she was often known to do. In the 
                        night she lost footing. And fell to 
                        her death at the bottom of the 
                        cliff.

  Lucretia shoots an incredulous look to Batiatus.

                                          TITUS(cont'd)
                      Do not look to him! I am the 
                        dominus of this fucking house. See 
                      it done.

  Titus sweeps from the room, commanding Batiatus to follow.

                                          TITUS(cont'd)
                        Quintus.

  Batiatus hesitates. Locking sympathetic eyes with Lucretia, 
  then follows in the wake of his father. OFF LUCRETIA s 
    devastation...



  Titus storms in with Batiatus in tow.

                                        TITUS
                      So this is why you spirited me to 
                        Neapolis. Not to find common 
                        ground, but to bury your father.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    50.

                        That was not my intent.

                                        TITUS
                        You knew nothing of this? It was 
                        all that woman s doing?

  Batiatus doesn t answer, which is an answer.

                                          TITUS(cont'd)
                        The two of you feed off each other, 
                        fattening yourselves with lies. I 
                        would see the feast at an end.

  Batiatus eyes him, not liking the sound of that.

                                        BATIATUS
                        What is your meaning?

                                        TITUS
                        You know my fucking meaning. That 
                        ill-bred woman has brought this 
                        family nothing but shame.

                                        BATIATUS
                        She is my wife!

                                        TITUS
                        Because I foolishly allowed it! I 
                        wanted you to have something of 
                        your own. Something that held 
                        meaning to you, even if no one else 
                        saw it. Yet what has she given you? 
                      No dowry to speak of. No name to 
                        elevate status.
                                  pointedly)(
                        And no heir to carry the name 
                        Batiatus.

  Batiatus tightens, but feels the sting of truth. Titus takes 
  a breath, calming himself.

                                          TITUS(cont'd)
                        Every choice you make, shapes your 
                        fate, Quintus. I cannot change 
                        missteps of the past. But I will 
                        see you upon proper path. And 
                        Lucretia must be swept from it.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You would dissolve my marriage?

                        No. You will make that choice for 
                        yourself. Or be gone from this 
                        house with her.

  OFF BATIATUS, stricken, an impossible choice at hand...
