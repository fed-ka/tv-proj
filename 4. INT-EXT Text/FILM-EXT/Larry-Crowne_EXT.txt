Larry is collecting loose shopping carts, steering them into
pairs, triplets, sextuplets, then riding them into the cart
pen like a Trail Boss...
LATER
That same up-chucking baby was riding on the coin-pony and up-
chucked again. Larry is cleaning it all up.
A beat-up CAR with a BIG STORK PIZZA sign stuck on its roof
pulls right up to the front of the store, parking in the
Handicapped Space.
LARRY CROWNE
Buddy. Park there and you'll get a
ticket.
PIZZA KID
Call a cop, doof. I'm gone in
sixty seconds.
(a dozen pizza boxes)
You guys having a party?
Less cars. Fewer shoppers. Heading into the night shift.
Vasquez helps Larry put down the ragged top of his car.
VASQUEZ
12 jerks I'd fire before you.
May walk away from UniMart myself.
LARRY CROWNE
Stick it out. You go to college?
VASQUEZ
Couple years. Then I blew out my
KNEE
11.
LARRY CROWNE
Thanks for seeing me off.
VASQUEZ
I need your apron, man.
(AGAIN)
Your apron. Says UniMart on it, so
it ain't yours.
Larry unharnesses himself from that which is not his. Hands
it over. Branded. Scorned as the one let go...
VASQUEZ (CONT'D)
Thanks.
(WALKING AWAY)
Goofy car, man.
Larry pulls up at a red light. From his hands-free speaker
jerry-rigged on his dash, we hear ON-HOLD Music.
RECORDED VOICE
Then, we hear the engines of SCOOTERS -- at least a dozen of
them. They surround his car -- both lanes -- and the chatter
of the riders as they scream over their engines as they AD-
"Remember, you always have a friend
at RiverBank..."
LIB where they are going next...
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD (OVER PHONE)
Laurie Gammelgaard thank you for
holding how may I help you?
Larry has to shout over the SCOOTER SQUAD ruckus.
LARRY CROWNE
I was holding for Barry Raphael in
Home and Real Estate?
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD
Mr. Raphael is no longer with the
bank. How can I help you?
LARRY CROWNE
Barry is gone? I need to talk to
someone in Home and Real Estate.
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD
12.
The SCOOTER SQUAD has made their decision and peel out --
VROOM, YEOOW...
LARRY CROWNE
(reading his ATM card)
I wish! I'm Customer number 566
7878 2031 339 and I can be there in
three minutes!
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD (OVER PHONE)
As long as you are here before six,
okey dokey.
ZZZZZMMMM, BLAARREE... The scooters are gone, but Larry is
still yelling...
LARRY CROWNE
Three minutes!
This is Larry Crowne's street.
This is Larry Crowne's house.
His car parks in the driveway and he steps out, taking a
minute to survey what he may lose.
KIDS play down the street under a streetlight... An ELDERLY
NEIGHBOR is watering his lawn with a hose... A GUY is playing
with his DOG... One house always has Christmas lights.
Another has a handicapped ramp up to the front door....
Lamarr lives across the street from Larry, and is looking out
the window as he prepares to light a scholarly looking pipe
LAMARR
Larry's home a little late tonight.
His wife, PATIENCE, is sitting at the table, pouring over
catalogs..
PATIENCE
Maybe he was out on a date.
14.
LAMARR
We'd see that on the news.
He is about to light up with a match...
PATIENCE
Don't even think about lighting
that up in my house.
Larry is with the first customers of the day, dressed to
impress in those well-ironed clothes. He strides right in to
the giant store.
LATER
He strides right out.
Larry is getting out of his car, putting on a good face, and
heading inside.
LATER
He gets right back into his car.
Larry is driving past the front windows of the store.
Resurrection Letters scream "LOST OUR LEASE! EVERYTHING MUST
GO!!!"
MR. PATTERSON is a busy man while talking with Larry.
MR. PATTERSON
If you emailed an application,
we've got it and we'll keep you in
mind.
LARRY CROWNE
Just following up with an in-person
visit.
MR. PATTERSON
Mission accomplished.
LARRY CROWNE
You have a great location here.
MR. PATTERSON
Not with UniMart half a mile away.
LARRY CROWNE
I used to work for UniMart! I
could spill you some 411.
MR. PATTERSON
What's that mean?
17.
LARRY CROWNE
I know their trade secrets.
MR. PATTERSON
What secrets? Traffic boosters,
loss leaders and bait and switch!
LARRY CROWNE
And I'm ready to learn new
strategies. I'll stop by again so
you can keep me in mind.
MR. PATTERSON
If you won't work Sundays, don't
bother.
LARRY CROWNE
I'll work every day.
MR. PATTERSON
That's what I already do...
Mr. Patterson goes back to work as Larry slinks away.
Establish that this is where many restaurants are located.
Larry sits in his car. The last thing he wants to do is work
in a restaurant -- we'll find out why later on. But times
are tough, no?
Out he climbs, resigned to fate...
By the dumpster, Larry is asking a CHEF on his smoke break if
they hav op nings.
Larry's scooter is parked near the entrance.
The door open, the garage very tidy, as Larry moves old items
out to the lawn.
Some things are already set up from the living room.
LARRY
is raising money with a Yard Sale.
Lamarr is about to pour himself some coffee when he sees a
DISASTER looming across the street. He's out like a shot!
Lamarr comes charging out the rising door and across the
street.
LAMARR
There's been a yard sale at 1402
Derby Court since Monica Lewinsky!
That gives me a monopoly on the
location! You go yard on me, Larry
Crowne and I will destroy you.
He is now standing on Larry's lawn. Larry looks at him.
Got fired yesterday.
20.
Lamarr sits on a for-sale chair.
LAMARR
Bloody Friday. Security sees you
off, by the time Monday comes
around the fired man is the
forgotten man. Diabolical.
LARRY CROWNE
They said it's because I didn't go
to college.
LAMARR
Smoke screen. The Man just wanted
you gone.
(his yard sale)
You liquidating assets to raise
cash?
LARRY CROWNE
Buying out Denise's half of the
house was the worst advice, ever.
LAMARR
I told you to avoid divorce
lawyers. Get married. Stay
married. Come with me.
They cross the street to Lamarr's house/yard sale.
LAMARR (CONT'D)
I'll tell you straight up - I'm not
lending you money.
This is a semi-professional operation. Boats, lamps, tools,
chairs, computers -- some of it almost junk -- is for barter
or sale.
Inside his garage? Clothes and books - racks and shelves.
Patience is organizing boxes of vinyl LP's.
PATIENCE
Whole box of Cha-Cha records from
the Fifties. You don't have any of
these, I promise.
LAMARR
He can't afford 'em Lost his job
21.
PATIENCE
No! UniMart just lost my business
forever!
LARRY CROWNE
I love you too.
PATIENCE
Sorry, Lie-bare-eye-bee. Get a
better job somewhere so you can
crush them.
LARRY CROWNE
Hard to do.
LAMARR
He's going to get something better
than a job.
(SEARCHING BOOKS)
An education.
He finds a East City Community College Catalog 2006. Tosses
it to Larry.
LAMARR (CONT'D)
Get some knowledge and you'll be
fire proof.
LARRY CROWNE
Aren't there unemployed engineers
and geophysicists?
PATIENCE
Listen to my husband. Hasn't
called a man boss in years. Paid
off the house.
LARRY CROWNE
You won the Lottery.
PATIENCE
Picked 8 little numbers when I kept
saying he was a fool. A quarter
million dollars later I've shut up.
LAMARR
Lost half to taxes.
LARRY CROWNE
I'll see if there's a class in here
for PowerBall 250.
22.
LAMARR
That's half a buck for the book.
LARRY CROWNE
They give these away free.
LAMARR
They do. I don't.
The sign reads "Enroll Now! $15 per unit!"
Larry parks in one of the hundreds of empty spaces.
PROF. MERCEDES TAINOT is a fierce defender of literacy and
intelligence -- and definitely one attractive package.
headache/grogginess combo of Biblical proportions.

MERCEDES TAINOT
I'm here. Shut up. Turn off!
Stepping from her sub-compact, she struggles into a pair of
heels, as in this state she drives barefoot. If only her
huge Thermo-cup held a hair of the dog she might not walk
such a crooked mile from the parking lot to the campus.
Larry -- in his car -- screeches around a corner. He is
frantically looking for a place to park, but as this is the
first day of term, the lot is jammed!
He nearly hits Mercedes Tainot.
MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
Jerk!
LARRY CROWNE
Sorry! Parking's impossible today!
MERCEDES TAINOT
Are you new to the Faculty?
LARRY CROWNE
New to the Student Body.
MERCEDES TAINOT
This is the Faculty Lot. We've
earned degrees for these spaces.
Students park on Mars.
LARRY CROWNE
I'm going to be late for my first
day of school.
MERCEDES TAINOT
I bet it won't be the first time.
STUDENTS search for their new classrooms. Mercedes does too,
among these 'portable' classrooms that have not moved in 7
years.
27.
Larry is walking from his house over to Lamarr's.
29.
Lamarr, pipe in mouth, is forever arranging his goods.
LAMARR
What's cookin' Joe College?
LARRY CROWNE
Money woes. Paying for gas, getting
to school.
(THEN)
You ever come across a moped or a
scooter for sale or trade?
Lamarr stops in his tracks.
LAMARR
Come with me.
Larry is carrying his Flat Screen TV, wires, box and all,
from his house to Lamarr's garage.
"Wing Ding Ding!" goes the scooter Lamarr has been working on
with his tools. He lets it idle as he takes the TV.
LAMARR
Beautiful. I'll throw in a helmet.
(SHOWING HIM)
Gas. Brake. Light's busted.
Tires are low. You'll need a
special license.
Larry straps on the old, beat up crash helmet (DOT approved).
LARRY CROWNE
All I need is the open road.
Larry revs it, crashes into a hedge.
LAMARR
You break it, you bought it.
LARRY CROWNE
It still works.
LAMARR
Talking about the hedge.
COMPUTER SCREEN
Images of an EROTIC SUPER-HEROINE -- busty and hot -- and
others, are being studied, and saved one after another.
DEAN TAINOT is a self-published author and blogger -- with a
taste for this kind of stuff. Multiple copies of his own
books line the shelves.
When he hears the FRONT DOOR open -- he panics.
DEAN TAINOT
Well, hey! Who's home early!
He keeps clicking away with the mouse until he's safe.
Mercedes calls from the other room.
MERCEDES TAINOT
32.
He covers his digital tracks and hops out of his desk.
KITCHEN
Mercedes is prepping the Margaritas for cocktail hour.
DEAN TAINOT
First day of term calls for a
celebration!
MERCEDES TAINOT
You'd think so.
DEAN TAINOT
What's your burden this go round?
MERCEDES TAINOT
Tap Dancing. Ping Pong. Water
Torture. And Speech at Sunrise
DEAN TAINOT
I built a Flamethrower of a posting
for WarriorWeb which, if I do say,
will feed nicely as an outline for
As the blender BLARES, husband and wife eye each other. She's

was a guest blogger on CyberShare.
Blender off. She starts pouring.
DEAN TAINOT (CONT'D)
Y u don't believe me.
MERCEDES TAINOT
Why wouldn't I believe you?
DEAN TAINOT
I was composing, Mercy. That's
what I do all day.
MERCEDES TAINOT
You were looking at porn.
She takes a nice pull on that icy drink.
Oh fine. Thought Police. I saw
some erotica. I'm a man, I admit
it.
MERCEDES TAINOT
Took you a while.
33.
DEAN TAINOT
It's barely porn. I'm not hiding
it.
MERCEDES TAINOT
Yes you are.
She bangs her head.
MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
Brain freeze.
DEAN TAINOT
Don't chug. Sip.
(THEN)
Everyone hides something.
MERCEDES TAINOT
I have no secrets from you. I
share the whole miserable slate.
DEAN TAINOT
You walked in the door pissed off
because -- I'm sorry -- I've
established a beach head in New
Media while you still have to teach
at Vassar of the Valley. You hide
that.
MERCEDES TAINOT
(SERIOUS EYES)
You look at Bra-Busters Triple-X
expecting me to pretend I don't
know or I don't care. I do both
and don't like it.
DEAN TAINOT
It may look like I don't work hard
around here, Mercy. But I do. I'm
just a guy who's a guy being a guy
when you're not around...
She walks away.
DEAN TAINOT (CONT'D)
And walking away is great for a
relationship...
It's a tiny slab, but there is a tree and a fence and a

Mercy closes the sliding door behind her and settles into her
chair and into her drink. This is where she goes when she
thinks/drinks.
Rap-rap-rap on the glass door. It's Dean, making one last
point.
DEAN TAINOT
(THROUGH GLASS)
I'm a guy. Who's a guy. Being a
guy...
Mercy turns her face to the sky...
The streets are not yet crowded with traffic.
A MOTORCYCLE RIDER pilots a STATE OF THE ART STREET MACHINE:
machine helmet, leather pants and jacket, radio in the
helmet, saddlebags, windscreen. Probably a gynecologist.
Larry is trying to work the kick stand of his scooter. He is
not yet practiced at the thing. Another scooter rrives.
TALIA
Where'd you get the Hot Wheels?
Talia is shaking her hair free from her helmet. Larry fails
to recognize her from Econ prime.
TALIA (CONT'D)
That machine's a classic.
LARRY CROWNE
Got me here for a nickel's worth of
gas.
TALIA
You're in Matsutani's Econ with me.
LARRY CROWNE
I am?
TALIA
That class is straining my coconut.
LARRY CROWNE
It's only been one day
TALIA
Didn't know you scooted.
LARRY CROWNE
New to the sport.
TALIA
(pulls out mobile phone)
Give me your number. I'll
introduce you to like-minded
enthusiasts.
(THEN)
Name please?
36.
LARRY CROWNE
Larry Crowne. With an 'e'.
TALIA
'Larry'? I don't think so. I used
to be Kathleen but one day I looked
in the mirror and saw a girl named
Talia.
(then in her phone)
Putting you in as 'Lance'. Check
your texts and we'll do us some
scooting.
(THEN)
Gotta tell you, Lance. Tucking a
polo shirt into khakis makes you
look like a cop.
LARRY CROWNE
Not much fashion sense.
TALIA
I know! Gotta change that...
Larry sees Mercedes Tainot walking from the Faculty lot, and
doesn't want to be late again.
LARRY CROWNE
Gotta go!
TALIA
Then get going!!
Talia watches him go. Likes him thus far...
LATER
Some of the Scooter Gang have assembled as Larry and Talia
walk up. DELL GORDO and STAN are talking about today's route.
TALIA
Hey Monkey!
Dell Gordo plants a kiss right on Talia's lips. She kisses
him back. Larry sinks a little.
40.
It only figures Talia would have a boyfriend like Dell Gordo.
TALIA (CONT'D)
This is Lance Corona. Classmate and
good guy, so far.
DELL GORDO
Dell Gordo. You want to ride with
us?
LARRY CROWNE
Why not.
There is a beat of a stare down between Dell Gordo and Larry,
but then Dell starts to snap his fingers --
SNAP...SNAP...SNAP... -- the other join in until they are all
snapping fingers like the Jets vs. Sharks. Talia too.
TALIA
Snap along, Lance or you can't join
the gang.
Larry, clumsily, starts snapping too. After a few bars...
DELL GORDO
Okay. You're in for a trial run.
And just like that, everyone goes back to their wheels.
STAN
Not many of these '66 Wasps left
around. They had low torque.
How's the torque?
He means Larry's scooter.
LARRY CROWNE
I just bought it and ride around.
Someone yells "Saddle up!"
TALIA
Stan knows engines and junk.
DELL GORDO
Let's go, Sweets!
TALIA
We ride, Monkey!
Larry's heart breaks a tiny bit, suffering as he does from
Talia-on-the-heart.
41.
The squad pulls out through the cars of the parking lot with
Larry trying to speed his machine along with the crowd...
SCOOT MONTAGE
They roll through town - a multi-wheeled dance troupe.
Swaying... turning... slow-motion sometimes... elegant
always.
They make riding look fun... being in a group a gas...
rolling with the wind in your hair something you'd like to
do...
UNIMART
As Larry and the Squad pass it by, Larry can't help but eye
the place he once worked. He sees staffers collecting carts
in the parking lot.
He misses that place...
LATER
After many shots, riders begin to peel off -- scooting done.
Talia waves at Larry who guns his throttle and pulls even
with her. TALIA (CONT'D)
You good, Lance?
LARRY CROWNE
Other than school, I have nothing to
do.
DELL GORDO
Let's troll Buena Vista for junk
stores.
STAN
We hit those last week.
TALIA
If it was Saturday we'd look for
yard sales.
LARRY CROWNE
I know where a yard sale is, like
everyday.
TALIA
Lead the way.
(YELLING)
Monkey! Lance knows a yard sale!
42.
DELL GORDO
Take point!
LARRY CROWNE
Follow me, boys and girl!
The Scooters pull around the corner. Lamarr shouts.
LAMARR
We're being invaded!
One by one, the Scooters park and survey the scene. The
stuff that Larry was selling is now part of Lamarr's
operation, being sold 'On Consignment'. .
LAMARR (CONT'D)
Larry, what kind of thugs you get
in with?
LARRY CROWNE
College buddies.
LAMARR
If they're college buddies why
aren't they in college?
TALIA
You have any old clothes?
LAMARR
Speak to my bride inside.
Dell Gordo, Stan and the others are going through hardware,
tools, appliances.
DELL GORDO
Oh man! These TV trays are too
much!
LAMARR
Bargains at $100 apiece.
DELL GORDO
For these? Are you nuts?
LAMARR
I'm joking, kid. Let's get to
haggling.
43.
DELL GORDO I
get it.
(THEN)
A buck apiece.
LAMARR
YOU
Ninety-nine dollars apiece.
see how this is working?
DELL GORDO
Two bucks apiece!
LAMARR
Ninety-eight and, kid, I do this
every day.
Larry stands alone, nothing to do as the Scooters poke about
the sale. He drifts towards his house, a forgotten man.
44.
NEIGHBORHOOD KIDS are in school uniforms, heading to the bus
stop. Dressed for school as well, Larry kick starts his
scooter, now a humming bit of mechanical perfection.
LARRY CROWNE
Speck-tack-alar.
He peels out, on his way to school.
Lamarr, and his percolator, give Larry a wave.
Larry walks to Speech 217 like any other student.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH (OVERLAPPING)
Even business can break down into a
Shakespearean Five-Act Structure!
Larry and Talia. Scooting along like Elvis and Ann-Margret
in Viva Las Vegas.
They swing into the complex.
Talia is unlocking the grate.
LARRY CROWNE
So what happens here?
TALIA
You ready?
Re-invention Big Boy

LARRY CROWNE
I have no idea what that means, but

She is driving home.

Go to hell...
INT TAINOT TOWNHOUSE - LATER
Dean is opening take-out containers to put the food on
plates. The table is set a little too ornately. Wine.
HE'S
Candles. Flowers.
In other words, he's making up.
Mercedes comes in through the door. Sees what's up.
being good and cute. He pours Margaritas.
DEAN TAINOT
No argument here, Mercy. Fact: I'm
a dope. Fact: My wife is beautiful
and brilliant. And I will be a
good boy from now on. Why?
Because you're right and I've
learned my lesson. Just don't be
mad at me forever. I have a
pliable soul and I pray you do too
54.
He dangles her a fresh Margarita. She'll take it...
BEDROOM - NIGHT
Mercedes and Dean have had make up sex. It was okay.
DEAN TAINOT (CONT'D)
Ah. That was nice.
MERCEDES TAINOT
It was. Yes.
DEAN TAINOT
Been thinking. If you ever want to
take a whack at writing something --
say a blog a couple of times a week --
I could help you out.
MERCEDES TAINOT
How?
DEAN TAINOT
I'd read your stuff. Make comments
to make it web-savvy. Pieces need
to pop, you know. Takes a little
PRACTICE
MERCEDES TAINOT
Okay.
DEAN TAINOT
See? You can't stay mad at me. No
reason to be mad at me...
He smooches her. Mercedes smooches back.
DEAN TAINOT (CONT'D)
I'm just a guy who's a guy being a
guy...
Mercedes' eyes: She didn't like hearing that...
Establish. It's early. Few customers
57.
Larry is scooting to Perry's.
61.
Mercedes Tainot is crossing campus when she sees Larry.
Talia is moving around his hair, showing it to a SCOOTER
QUAD HAIR STYLIST. Lala is weighing in with her opinion on
Larry's hair .
MERCEDES TAINOT
Is that Larry Crowne!?
(HE STOPS)
You have a lot of nerve showing
your face on campus after ditching
my class!
LARRY CROWNE
I'm sorry, Ms. Tainot. I will not
miss another class, this I vow.
63.
MERCEDES TAINOT
Vows come cheap, Larry Crowne.
You'll lead off next assignment
with three minutes on a personal
first. A story, with details, not
a laundry list or slide show. And,
as I told Dibiasi, no one wants to
hear about the first time you got
laid.
She eyes Talia with venom in her eyes.
MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
Or the most recent.
Talia laughs out loud!
TALIA
That woman is one clenched fist of
fury.
Larry pulls in.
RAIN!
Coming down in buckets. Talia has the grate up, wrapping a
new outfit for Larry culled from her supply. Dell Gordo is
in a rain slicker.
DELL GORDO
I think it's letting up.
TALIA
It's going to storm till next year.
DELL GORDO
We can't stay here all day. Find a
raincoat and let's get a little
wet.
TALIA
I do not scoot in the rain.
DELL GORDO
How you going to get to school
then, College Co-Ed Belle?
Larry pulls up in his Karmann Ghia -- top up.
TALIA
My savior! Look at your new
schmatas.
(HOLDING BOOTS)
And footwear!
(hopping in, to Dell)
Stay dry, sweetie!
Dell Gordo is not happy to see this.
It is raining. Mercedes' car is out front.
MERCEDES TAINOT (PRE-LAP)
I got engaged to a teacher/writer
with two books in print...
67.
Talia is riding alone. She slows at a TATTOO PARLOR...
An empty store right next to the Tattoo Parlor. Talia is
looking through the window
71.
A hand-drawn sign with an arrow says "FOR LEASE ENQUIRE NEXT
DOOR ASK FOR MAURICE."
Talia smiles. Her mobile rings its unique ringtone.
STAN: "Scoot! Webster and Palm!"
Talia and the scooter gang pull in.
Dean is opening the car door for Mercedes, putting on the
class act for a night out.
He laughs at a feeble joke we can't hear. The guy is trying.
LATER - NIGHT
They come right out the same door. They've argued and drank
all through the meal. Dean carries extra cheesecake home in
a dessert box. And, oh, they've been drinking.
DEAN TAINOT
Work my ass off all night trying to
get f i in' smile out of you!
MERCEDES TAINOT
I'm smiling...
DEAN TAINOT
Like The Joker after three Apple
Martinis.
MERCEDES TAINOT
If they help, they help.
DEAN TAINOT
We can't even have a Date Night
now? You can't even chillax for
one meal?
MERCEDES TAINOT
"Chillax?" Did you use the word
"chillax?" That come from your
Bloggers Thesaurus?
A young couple -- call them JANET and TONY - have been on
their first date. It's gone well.
76.
JANET
As soon as I saw you, I said, "I
want to go out with that man."
TONY
What did you say when I asked you
out?
JANET
I said "Yes." You were there,
remember?
TONY
I saw you and I thought "I would be
a lucky guy if she'd go out with
me."
JANET
Yes you are.
TONY
Honestly, this is about as good a
first date goes, isn't it?
JANET
Disaster looms on most first dates,
but I'm talking to you like you're a
friend I want to make out with.
TONY
Hold that thought.
Dean and Mercy pull up beside them in their car.
Mercedes is out of the car before it even stops.
DEAN TAINOT
I take it back. I take it back.
MERCEDES TAINOT
Drive, asshole! Drive away!
DEAN TAINOT
I've been drinking, too.
MERCEDES TAINOT
Drive straight til you hit a cliff
on the coastline!
DEAN TAINOT
You win! I'm letting you win!
Everything you say is right and
WIN!
77.
MERCEDES TAINOT
LOSER! I MARRIED A LOSER!!! With
a tiny dick! Tiny dick LOSER!
DEAN TAINOT
Screw you, you washboard!
MERCEDES TAINOT
Oh, chillax!!!
GPS VOICE
Please enter your destination.
Dean screeches off into the night. Mercedes picks up a rock
and hurls it at him.
MERCEDES TAINOT
I'm throwing rocks at my own car !!
Janet and Tony are aghast - silent - in shock.
MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
The jerk who just deserted me? My
husband of 4 friggin' years!
She stomps off into the night. Janet and Tony don't know
what to do with each other now.
Mercedes is walking home. It's a bit longer than she would
like. She comes to a bus stop and studies the route. She
sits and removes her shoes.
MERCEDES TAINOT
I loved these shoes once. Stupid
shoes.
She sits at he stop, about to cry. Then she sort of does
cry, for so any reasons.
In the distance, we hear...
The ROAR of SCOOTERS. Then here they come. A night-time
'Scoot'.
All the REGULARS go by. Somewhere in the mix are Larry and
Talia.
Talia is just able to turn her head and see Ms. Tainot at the
bus stop. She slows.
78.
TALIA
Lance! Chick alert!
Larry is beside her. They stop.
TALIA (CONT'D)
You are not going to believe how
Fate meets cute!
She u-turns and Larry follows her, confused.
BUS BENCH
Mercedes wonders who these Mock Wild Ones are that pull up to
her.
LARRY CROWNE
Ms. Tainot?
MERCEDES TAINOT
No.
He takes off his helmet.
LARRY CROWNE
Larry Crowne.
MERCEDES TAINOT
Jesus Christ.
TALIA
And I've been calling you 'Lance'.
LARRY CROWNE
Do you need a ride? Hop on.
MERCEDES TAINOT
And bust up your romp in the glen
with Bambi?
TALIA
Hey. Bambi was a boy.
LARRY CROWNE
I was heading home.
(TO TALIA)
Right? We're done scooting?
TALIA
Not me. I love riding in the
night. Magic happens.
(TO LANCE)
79.
Away Talia scoots to catch up with the gang.
MERCEDES TAINOT
What do men see in irritating free
spirits?
Mercedes starts walking.
LARRY CROWNE
Seriously. I offer you a ride.
MERCEDES TAINOT
Seriously. I don't want one.
Larry shuts off his scooter, pushing it along with his feet
LARRY CROWNE
I've yet to give anyone a lift on
this but I think I can get you home
with a scraped elbow, worst case.
MERCEDES TAINOT
I am walking, Crowne, as thoughts
black boil up from my soul. Major
consequences sure to follow.
You'll read about them on
Parsectwelve.com.
LARRY CROWNE
An attractive woman like you
walking alone is a dumb idea.
MERCEDES TAINOT
I need a man flirting with me right
now like I need a dog crapping on my
lawn. I'm hoofing it.
LARRY CROWNE
In those shoes?
Mercedes ponders her shoes. He's got her. She stops.
MERCEDES TAINOT
A man who notices shoes.
(GIVING UP)
All right. I'll be your Cycle
Slut.
LARRY CROWNE
Put this on.
(HIS HELMET)
Strap your legs round my engine and
80.
MERCEDES TAINOT
It won't be a terrible thing if you
kill us both.
LARRY CROWNE
Ain't you a ball of fun?
Larry kick starts the scooter and off they go -- slowly.
IN MOTION
MERCEDES TAINOT
Are you really going to go this
slow?
LARRY CROWNE
I do want to survive this night.
MERCEDES TAINOT
Fine. I have time to window shop.
Oh look, a sale on tires at
AutoUSA. And here comes a mailbox.
I've never noticed their perfect
design and colo scheme. This is
so slow a cat could knock us over.
Here they come at the speed of a lazy cow. Mercedes is
singing "Sixteen Miles on the Erie Canal".
Larry shouts over his shoulder.
LARRY CROWNE
Where am I taking you?
MERCEDES TAINOT
Down to Portola and left to
Havenhurst. Havenhurst to Palermo.
Right on Palermo till I yell stop.
LARRY CROWNE
I may use this as a presentation in
class.
MERCEDES TAINOT
Try it and you'll flunk.
I am joking.
81.
MERCEDES TAINOT
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
LARRY CROWNE
I like your class. You're making
us all do things we never thought
we could.
MERCEDES TAINOT
Put the shovel away and just get me
home, 'kay?
Up ahead, flashing lights.
MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
Hail our City's Finest.
LARRY CROWNE
Someone's getting pinched...
A COP CAR with its cherry top flashing, has pulled over a
Drunk Driver.
It's Dean. They're making him touch his nose, breathe into a
test kit.
Mercedes starts laughing.
As they pass the crime scene, Dean is being put into the back
of the Prowler, cuffed...
Mercedes' laugh fills the night as they putt-putt along.
MERCEDES TAINOT
Measure his dick, officer! He's
too diminutive to drive!
(THEN)
Tiny dick loser!
Larry doesn't know what to make of that.
LARRY CROWNE
Bad night for that guy.
MERCEDES TAINOT
Best night I've had in years!
Drive on, McDuff!
In through the gates come our night crawlers. Mercedes is
82.
Larry shuts off the motor. Mercedes is half asleep. She
doesn't remember to take off Larry's helmet.
LARRY CROWNE
Unit 114.
MERCEDES TAINOT
Thanks for the ox-cart ride.
Like a sleepwalker. Stands at the Alarm Pad.
MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
I can see the Alarm Pad. I know
the code. But my hands aren't
working.
(THEN)
Help me.
LARRY CROWNE
You don't want to give me your pass
code.
MERCEDES TAINOT
Just hold my hand up to the
numbers. I'll manage from there.
Larry takes her hand and guides it to the pad.
MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
Look away now.
(HE DOES)
Two two two two. Pound.
Larry heard every word.
MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
W ere's my purse? Oh yeah. My car.
The key please? It's buried in
that plant.
Larry digs out an Altoids tin. Rattles it.
LARRY CROWNE
This it?
MERCEDES TAINOT
Why I think it is!
LARRY CROWNE
I'll get the door for you
Larry opens the door, reaches in, turns on the light.
83.
MERCEDES TAINOT
Take one step inside and I call
security.
Larry steps away from the door.
MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
And forget this ever happened.
LARRY CROWNE
What?
MERCEDES TAINOT
This whole sorry chapter tonight.
LARRY CROWNE
What?
MERCEDES TAINOT
You passing up Gidget for a flat
old coot like me.
LARRY CROWNE
What are you talking about?
MERCEDES TAINOT
What, you have no short-term
memory?
Larry has been tying to be polite.
LARRY CROWNE
When I say 'what', it means I get
it and have already purposefully
forgotten everything. Call it
irony.
MERCEDES TAINOT
Sarcasm. Irony is when Gallant
lands in the drunk tank while
Goofus scoots me home.
LARRY CROWNE
Goodnight, Ms. Tainot.
She doesn't move, but flashes her ring finger.
MERCEDES TAINOT
Mrs. I'm Mrs. Tainot. Can you not
see that?
LARRY CROWNE
I assumed you preferred Ms
84.
MERCEDES TAINOT
When we presume we make a pretty
pair of asses of me and you or
something like that.
(THEN)
Why aren't you married?
LARRY CROWNE
That's a long story and it's late.
(THEN)
My helmet?
MERCEDES TAINOT
Help yourself.
She sticks her neck out. If this were a movie, they might
kiss right now.
Larry pauses. Mercedes looks at him. He's not a bad looking
guy. He starts to undo the helmet strap.
MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
I noticed something on the ride.
LARRY CROWNE
WHAT
MERCEDES TAINOT
IT MAY
You smell good.
LARRY CROWNE
Thanks.
He gently removes the strap and helmet from her head.
be a bit sexy. Her hair tumbles out.
MERCEDES TAINOT
Do you have a crush on me? Single
student. Unattainable teacher. It's
common.
Larry has no idea what to say.
LARRY CROWNE
We all have crushes on you. Even
the gals.
MERCEDES TAINOT
You want to make out with me, you
can. I know I'm not a third rate
Audrey Hepburn wanna-be but I still
GOT MOVES
Come on, Gramps. Take this ride.
(MORE)
85.
MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
My spouse won't be home for 3 to 5
years.
Larry ponders this moment for as long as he can. He
shouldn't, of course. But, damn. She is Mercedes Tainot.
Bang.
It's a pretty good whammy kiss. Makes her splay her arms and
everything.
Larry pulls back. After a bit, though. She could have kept
at it, too.
LARRY CROWNE
Wow...
MERCEDES TAINOT
Pretty dang good. I still got it,
no?
LARRY CROWNE
Yes, you do..
(THEN)
In you go.
(Mercedes goes in)
Close the door.
(SHE DOES)
Lock it!
Larry hears the sound of the bolt. He walks away.
Larry wistfully starts his bike, looking back at the door.
He will not forget that kiss or this night. He drives off.
A TAXI is pulling up. Out of the back, Dean, looking like he
86.
He pays the cabbie, pissed off about everything. Then his
world gets much more complicated.
P.O.V.
All his possessions, stacked up in front of the door. On the
top of the heap, his computer. Turned on and showing porn
DEAN TAINOT
Oh, Jesus Hell and tomorrow...
(THEN)
Mercy!!!
Mercy feels terrible, stepping from her car, brutally
hungover.
As she straightens up, her eye catches...
LARRY CROWNE
On his scooter. Heading towards the Scooter parking.
She smiles -- a rare thing on a morning like this but the
memory of last night warrants it. She heads in that
direction.
Mercy is trying to 'accidentally' run into Larry, but is
caught by surprise when..
He is walking right towards her. Oops. That would be
uncomfortable. She DUCKS behind a pillar.
Still wanting to 'bump' into the man who kissed her last
night, she circumvents his path, stalking Larry like a
birdwatcher tracks a blue-tailed swallow.
Hopping behind a tree, Mercy's SHOE gets caught in some mud.
Bending down, a branch catches her sweater and RIPS a seam.
Stepping onto the pavement, the tree branch SMACKS her in the
head.
Still, she keeps and eye on Larry. And pursues...
BENCH AREA
87.
Staying out of his eye line, Mercy navigates her way around
to the other side of the Bench Area and preps her appearance
before making a 180 degree reverse, guaranteeing a 'Meet'
with Larry.
Then she sees her.
TALIA
Sitting with others, greeting Larry with laughter and hugs
and hoots. Talia is announcing to all how she left Larry
with a drunken teacher last night, with her arm around his
waist and affection in her eyes.
MERCY
Is crushed. For the obvious reasons sh s ill can't
understand. She was hoping to have Larry to herself for a
minute or two.
TALIA AND LARRY
Amid the others...
TALIA
Oh, come on! I left you all set
up! What went down?
LARRY CROWNE
Epilog. School today.
TALIA
Lance! A Betty on your Scooter
after midnight? Holding on, her
arms around you, pressed against
your back, is a license to at least
cop a feel.
LARRY CROWNE
If we had ended up making out, you
still wouldn't hear it.
Talia slugs him. All in play...
MERCY
Convinced Larry is gossiping about last night, Mercy backs
away from the scene, and slinks away toward her class.
88.
Larry and Lamarr are sitting on the curb, watching kids play
down the street. They run back and forth in front of them
with a soccer ball.
They both have pipes, with Lamarr showing him how to light
up.
LAMARR
Puff. Don't suck. Then... relax.
(THEN)
See? Works.
LARRY CROWNE
I have to sell my car.
Put a new top on it.
91.
LARRY CROWNE
If I could afford a new top I could
afford to keep it.
LAMARR
What's the job paying you?
LARRY CROWNE
Half my UniMart salary.
LAMARR
You're down, Larry Crowne. Down as
dirt.
LARRY CROWNE
I'm looking back on the year Denise
left as the good old days.
LAMARR
Hang in there, neighbor.
LARRY CROWNE
Everyone keeps saying that.
LAMARR
I was in the same spot. Look what
happened.
LARRY CROWNE
The odds of two people on the same
street winning the lottery are
worse than one person on the street
winning the lottery.
LAMARR
I read how the universe is
expanding, Larry, taking us along
with it. That is a wild concept to
grasp, but what it means is, we all
have to hold on tight sometimes to
get to where we're going to be.
LARRY CROWNE
(THE PIPE)
This thing must be making me dizzy.
What?
LAMARR
Keep your grip. You'll be okay.
It's like the wife always says...
Shoppers pull up to Lamarr's Yard Sale. The WIFE has a
92.
LAMARR (CONT'D)
A woman with a measuring tape?
That's money in my pocket.
A ball flies in and hits Larry smack in the head, sending his
pipe flying.
Hardly any cars. Shopping carts are herded into their corral
by... former Team Leader Larry Crowne.
Trees. A picnic table. And Mercedes Tainot writing
individual words on pages of a steno book.
After each word, she folds each page many times and puts it
in a basket.
Up walks Dean Tainot, who looks neither happy nor cheerful.
DEAN TAINOT
Hi.
MERCEDES TAINOT
Thanks for coming.
DEAN TAINOT
No notice. No preamble. Just an
email and a google map.
MERCEDES TAINOT
I knew you'd be on the computer.
(THEN)
Working...
DEAN TAINOT
Point made.
(THEN)
So. What up.
MERCEDES TAINOT
Are we making a mistake here?
DEAN TAINOT
94.
MERCEDES TAINOT
Point made. We could change
things. We could start right now.
DEAN TAINOT
We could. Why should we?
MERCEDES TAINOT
Because we have history, Dean. But
first, my thoughts... I've got to
address drinking. I should be
able to comprehend and respond to
both sides of our conversations. And
the morning shower should be
refreshing, not a hangover cure.
DEAN TAINOT
I'd like that too.
MERCEDES TAINOT
Really?
DEAN TAINOT
You're not a pleasant woman after a
few glasses. Mornings with you are
to be survived.
MERCEDES TAINOT
Okay. Now, you.
Dean is caught short.
DEAN TAINOT
I see. I'm what this is all about.
MERCEDES TAINOT
There are plenty of items on the
relationship agenda but let's start
here.
DEAN TAINOT
You're talking about you but you
really mean me.
(THEN)
I am not yelling or begging or
saying you have to stop doing
anything. So you don't get to
either.
MERCEDES TAINOT
I'm not saying that.
95.
DEAN TAINOT
We've both been here before. Why
prolong the process? White flag! I
give up. This ain't working.
(THEN)
I'll sign papers and checks, see if
there's enough for a cool sports
car as a reward for the last few
years and eventually I will be fine
and you will too. But I am never
once going to look at myself as
another poor divorced guy who could
still be married if only he had
done the mea culpa bit for all his
faults.
(THEN)
I just now came up with that, and
it is going to be my next posting.
He pulls out his Blackberry and makes a note to himself.
DEAN TAINOT (CONT'D)
I don't think there is anything
else to talk about. Do you?
Mercedes looks at him. She has been a fool...
Mercy -- Margarita pitcher handy -- is still writing words on
paper, and drinking. Alone. Not good.
The sign reads "FINALS WEEK: ENROLL FOR SPRING QUARTER."
Larry scoots up. She is inside arranging a "Coming Soon!"
window display. Dell Gordo, Stan, and the Squad are all
inside building shelves and racks.
She comes out of the store.
TALIA
You digging what you see?
LARRY CROWNE
You missed Matsutani's class.
Review for the final.
TALIA
I'm done w th college.
LARRY CROWNE
What? Why?
TALIA
Because I'm going into business.
LARRY CROWNE
Talia. Don't be a fool. Stay in
school. Don't throw away your
education.
TALIA
And don't drink and drive or do
drugs and quit smoking and eat
vegetables. I don't. I stopped.
I did. I do.
LARRY CROWNE
98.
TALIA
Pretty much. Oh, look. Maurice
gave us free tattoos. I wanted
something in Japanese so check this
out.
She shows it to him, just above her butt-crack. It's two
Japanese characters.
TALIA (CONT'D)
That one says 'courage'. That one
says 'spirit'. Courageous Spirit.
Dell Gordo knocks on the window as Larry has his hands on his
gal's butt... "What's this, Lance??"
LARRY CROWNE
Japanese characters go the other
way and that says Soy Sauce.
TALIA
Oh shut up.
LARRY CROWNE
It does. Soy sauce. Soy. Sauce.
Quitting school is for dopes.
It does, actually say Soy Sauce. He is starting his scooter.
TALIA
Be here for our Grand Opening!
LARRY CROWNE
Might not make it. I have finals!
OPEN SKY
Larry comes into frame, with a hammer and stake.
He is pounding the FOR SALE sign into his front lawn.
Laurie Gammelgaard pulls up her new VW Bug with a COUPLE in
the back seat. They get out and Larry nods as he waves them
to the door.
He remains on the lawn, looking at his neighborhood -- the
kids, the dogs -- Lamarr across the street.
It's all over...
99.
Frances and Mercedes have pulled up in her car.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
This place anonymous enough?
MERCEDES TAINOT
As long as alcohol's out of my
grasp.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
They have good pie, they say.
MERCEDES TAINOT
Great. Sugar can replace tequila
in my bloodstream, my thighs, and
the folds in my neck.
They pass a car prominently parked - Larry's Convertible
Karmann Ghia with a sign on its windshield: "FOR SALE BY
OWNER."
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH (PRE-LAP)
So. You're a mess.
The street is empty. Larry is on his scooter, riding around
and around and around the block that he will soon leave.
He can see his NEIGHBORS through the open windows -- KIDS
bouncing on a couch...A QUARTET OF OLD FOLKS playing cards
and laughing... a MOVIE playing on a big TV.
This was Larry's street...
CUT TO:
SUNRISE
Mercedes exits the door, crisp, clean -- like we've never
seen her in the mornings. See the way she holds, not
clutches, her Thermo-Cup?
He's wearing a zipped up jacket. Kids and dog-walkers pass
as his scooter starts pronto, he is off...
The FOR SALE sign on his lawn has an addition: IN ESCROW
His furnishings are out on the lawn. Lamarr and Patience are
looking them over. Mack and Dibiasi are putting the last of
his things into Mack's huge SUV and Larry's car.
PATIENCE
A two-bedroom apartment and you
don't have room for your furniture?
LAMARR
Selling this futon-sofabed? All
those years across the street and
you've learned nothing.
(THEN)
What's the minimum you'll take for
this stuff?
LARRY CROWNE
You'll get me top price.
LAMARR
You did learn.
DIBIASI
Pizza at last!
LARRY CROWNE
Here's lunch as promised!
The BIG STORK PIZZA GUY pulls up in a different car but the
same sign.
LARRY CROWNE (CONT'D)
108.
STRANG
Son of a cock. Larry Crowne.
The Pizza guy is none other than Jack Strang.
LARRY CROWNE
Jack Strang. Wow. This is irony.
STRANG
Two extra large. One Salad Bucket.
Box of Frosty Cinnamon Eggs. Sixteen-
fifty.
Larry hands him the coupon and a Twenty.
LARRY CROWNE
Jack. I need two bucks back.
Times are tough.
STRANG
Tell me about it.
LARRY CROWNE
Ah. Forget it. Keep the change.
Strang leaves. Larry watches him go.
him. It almost was.
STRANG
I appreciate it.
That could have been
Mercy is opening her door, starting her car.
GPS VOICE
Please enter your destination.
MERCEDES TAINOT
Oh be quiet.
That's a MapGenie.
111.
MERCEDES TAINOT
It is Hellspawn.
LARRY CROWNE
In my old job, I'd have steered you
to a Vortex unit. The MapGenie
interface is clumsy and the menu
needs too many inputs.
He is reaching into the car, across her to tap the unit.
MERCEDES TAINOT
It was working fine. Then I think
I pressed too many buttons.
LARRY CROWNE
Ah. The Auto On Feature is
engaged. Menu. Select. Features.
Auto Voice. Select. Change? Yes.
On. Off. Done? Yes. Save. Back.
Back. Back. Exit.
While he was doing that, Mercedes was smelling what she could
of Larry. She liked it. She looked at his neck, his ears.
And smelled him.
LARRY CROWNE (CONT'D)
How long was this broken?
MERCEDES TAINOT
Seemed like years and years.
LARRY CROWNE
All better now. Should be able to
find your way.
Nothing to do now but say goodbye.
They hear a pounding.
Raul is at the window inside the cafe, signaling the break is
over.
LARRY CROWNE (CONT'D)
My Boss. Back to work.
(THEN)
Thanks for the good news...
The sign says "New Term Beginning! $20 a unit! Ask about
Financial Aid!"
Did you notice? The cost of an education just went up...
Mercedes is walking to another building, another class.
She may not realize it, but she is looking for Larry Crowne.
Busik is busy chatting her up. Seriously chatting her up.
BUSIK
All the excitement of first day of
term, I don't want to go back to my
empty apartment. Do you? I need a
drink and some talk and some wind-
down time. Don't you?
DR. MATSUTANI (O.C.)
Ms. Tainot?
She turns.
MERCEDES TAINOT
Dr. M.
DR. MATSUTANI
Larry Crowne is taking six units
from me, devouring the material
like a starving man.
MERCEDES TAINOT
Larry's enrolled?
DR. MATSUTANI
He's continuing his education and
tells me it is because of you.
That your class changed his life.
Mercedes finds herself smiling -- beaming...
MERCEDES TAINOT
Larry said that about me?
BUSIK
Oh yeah! I put that guy in your
class. So technically, I changed
his life.
MERCEDES TAINOT
He is a good student
114.
DR. MATSUTANI
And handy on a scooter.
(THEN)
Is there any chance you would
consider having drinks with an
older faculty peer who holds a PhD
in Economics?
MERCEDES TAINOT
Well, no. No offense Dr. M.
DR. MATSUTANI
The rumor is you are newly single
and I was just taking a shot.
Mercy looks right at Busik.
MERCEDES TAINOT
News travels fast.
Busik pretends he knows nothing...
BUSIK
If you're going out, I'm not doing
anything.
DR. MATSUTANI
Have you ever been to Hooters?
BUSIK
For the spicy wings, yes!
There is a note on Mercy's car. She takes it.
"To test your MapGenie: 4225 Harbor Blvd. 2nd floor. An 'A'
student."
Her breath catches in her heart...
Mercedes is driving.
GPS VOICE
Right Turn.
MERCEDES TAINOT
Got it Turning right
115.
GPS VOICE
Your destination is ahead on the
right.
MERCEDES TAINOT
It is? That was a breeze. Thank
you.
Open for business with bunting and everything. Talia is
eating take out sushi and reading the soy sauce packet. She
is tying to check out her ass-crack tattoo to see if it
really does say 'Soy Sauce'.
Mercedes has arrived. Talia sees her and comes out.
Lamarr is around. Patience, too.
We might notice that Dell Gordo and Larry now dress exactly
alike, as we've seen the same jacket once on Lance Corona.
TALIA
I love that blouse with that skirt
but I'd show more leg if I were
you.
MERCEDES TAINOT
I'm Mercy Tainot
TALIA
Bambi Romp in the Glen. Looking
for Lance?
MERCEDES TAINOT
4225 Harbor?
TALIA
This is 4227.
(POINTING)
4225. You'll see the stairs.
The tattoo parlor. Larry's scooter is right in front. As she
goes.
TALIA (CONT'D)
Little higher heels'll get you wolf
whistles.
116.
Music is playing. A nice view is revealed as Mercy arrives on
a nice little porch. On a little table sits a potted plant.
In the potted plant is an Altoids tin.
Mercy gives it a rattle. In the tin, a brand new key.
Mercy takes the key. Slides it into the lock and slowly
opens the door.
The music gets louder. She can't see much into the tiny
flat, but she can make out...
Larry, arranging the last of his stuff.
Mercy stands at the door until he sees her.
When he does, he says nothing. But steps to her and smells
her - her neck, her hair.
MERCEDES TAINOT
Did you tell Ed Matsutani taking my
class changed your life?
LARRY CROWNE
Yes.
MERCEDES TAINOT
How?
LARRY CROWNE
I met you.
That's it.
They kiss. Damn fine whammy kiss.
Mercy is still in her robe, riding on Larry's scooter, back
and forth in front of the Parlor and Talia's store.
Larry is having coffee, sitting on the steps, watching her
ride back and forth.
She is getting good.
Talia and the gang spill out of the store to watch her.
Hoots and laughter.
Larry uses his robe as a matador's cape, Mercy as the bull.
As she passes under his flaring cape...
