August 27, 2010DAYBREAK IN THE TEXAS DESERT 

Ablaze with fuchsia cholla and lemon-blossomed prickly 
pear.  An armadillo pokes its head out of a burrow.  A 
javelina scuttles past, startling a herd of deer in the 
morning quiet.  THE ONLY SOUND WE HEAR IS AN OIL RIG 
BORING INTO THE EARTH.

ELENA RAMOS (28), asleep on the ground, suddenly comes 
alert.  Dark-haired, beautifully olive-skinned, she sits 
up, senses vigilant.  

She crosses to A LAPTOP DISPLAYING SEISMIC DATA ON A 3-D 
GRAVITY METER.  What she sees makes her heart kickstart.

ELENA

Grabbing sleep on the ground, JOHN ROSS EWING III (30), 
stirs.

-- Pull the drill...Pull it!  NOW!

Suddenly the twelve-foot drill-stem pierces a pocket of 
gas that whistles out in a rush.  

John Ross scrambles.  Starts pulling the bit out of the 
hole.  The rig begins to shudder violently.  Abruptly a 
shower of mud and rock erupts from the hole.  

 been sleeping In the b.g., A DRILLING CREW OF FOUR who ve
in their trucks, hustles toward the blow-out.  

Finally the stream stops.  There s silence.  

Then, a faint gurgling sound comes from deep in the well.  
The ground begins to rumble.  A roar emanates from the 
hole.  As Elena, John Ross and the Crew dive for cover, a 
jet of black oil erupts from the ground, arcing into the 
sky and falling on them like rain.

The Crew increases the hydrostatic pressure, trying to 
cap the well.  John Ross spins a set of valves, diverting 
the gush of crude.  Finally everything goes quiet.  Elena 
checks the gauges.  Swallows.  A quiver in her voice --

CONTINUED:

Their eyes meet.  John Ross is electrified.  Elena looks 
anxious.  A moment of understanding between them.  In the 
b.g, the crew is already celebrating.

ELENA (CONT D)
Time to tell Bobby --

ON JOHN ROSS - once a sickly child, now grown into a 
powerful man, he is charismatic, seductive; you have to 
be careful not to fall in love with him, because you 
s son: ambitious,  his father already sense that he s
burning with a need to be noticed.

JOHN ROSS

...All I ever wanted.  Trust me.

His intensity is contagious, as he pulls her into a 
jubilant kiss.  

We stay on Elena, a proud, beautiful woman with a 
whirring Swiss timepiece for a mind, less assured.

Affronted, Christopher throws his napkin on the table, 
but before he can leave, a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN IN 
TENNIS WHITES blocks his exit.  She has green-catlike 
eyes and exudes sensuality.  She seems alarmed.

Christopher nods and turns to follows the young woman.

VENTURE CAPITALIST #1
Hey, Ewing, bring some capital to 
the table if you want better 
terms.  Or maybe the president can 
help with a public subsidy -- 

The men laugh.  Christopher never looks back.  

TRACKING WITH CHRISTOPHER AND THE FRENCH GIRL

She quickens her pace, animatedly talking to Christopher 
 Locker over her shoulder.  As they arrive at the Ladies 
Room, she enters.  But Christopher stops.  He regards the 
 LockerLadies  sign as he might a Border Patrol fence.  
Then he does a quick look around...what the hell...He 
enters.

on a bench.  He peers around another row of lockers and

CREDITS OVER - MAIN TITLES AND DALLAS THEME 

Southfork Ranch.  Two hundred thousand acres of gentle 
rises, bluffs and grassy plains, dotted with cattle and 
horses -- a vast kingdom over which the Southworths and 
Ewings have reigned for over 150 years.  

Bobby gallops toward the unscathed horizon, past gray-
green mesquite and juniper, past spring-fed stream beds. 

Finally, he slows.  He sees RANCH HANDS building fences, 
branding cattle; hears a clanging bell calling the men to 
lunch.  The men wave to Bobby.  They respect their 
patr n.  Bobby waves back.  The sights, sounds, smells of 
Southfork never fail to renew him.

Ann hurries into the bedroom and is surprised to find 
Bobby sitting on the bed, watching an OLD EWING FAMILY 
 say anything.  Just extends his hand VIDEO.  He doesn t

Louder, cockier than Christopher, who is arrogant, loud,

Christopher.  Bang.  Action.  

Christopher scores on a spinning move.

John Ross passes up a shot, dribbles low past 
Christopher, drills a fifteen-footer.

Christopher is unperturbed.  He starts one direction, 
John Ross all over him.  Dribbles to his right, looking 
for an opening, suddenly cuts for the basket and slams it 
through.  Smiles without rubbing it in.  But John Ross 
gets a look in his eye.

Christopher takes a position two or three feet from John

Bobby sees her and crosses to her, concerned.  Ann waves 
off his concern.  Serene and calm.  She wants to know 
 happened.   As Bobby begins to fill her in --what s

TIME DISSOLVE - THE WEDDING ALTAR

Under an arbor of white orchids -- and with Bobby as his 
best man -- Christopher and Rebecca exchange vows.  

MINISTER
...I now pronounce you man and 
wife --

Holding the bridesmaid bouquet, Elena watches Christopher 
kiss his wife.  She seems hollow.  

As the MUSIC RISES, Bobby pulls his son into an embrace.  

Then husband and wife are pelted with rice.


INT. ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY - DALLAS - NIGHT

Unsteady, John Ross walks down the hallway, a bottle of

John Ross shakes his head.  Double-takes on Marta Del Sol 
-- the woman who just agreed to buy Southfork -- standing 
 nursing home room, in full there in his father s
splendor.

John Ross has not been invited.  Slowly, he lets himself 
down on the sofa.

his hand.  Staring out.  Then he turns to the window.  
Sees his own reflection.  It seems to stare back at him.  
Fractured.


EXT. DESERT - BEFORE DAWN

Daybreak in the desert.  A Texas moon sets on the 
horizon, as the first pale glow of dawn illuminates the 
eastern sky.  

John Ross sits in his truck, alone.  He hears a car 
approaching.  The humming purr of a sports engine.  As a 
red Lamborghini pulls up -- the same car John Ross met 
outside the bar in the opening -- we reveal Marta Del Sol 
 seatin the driver s.
