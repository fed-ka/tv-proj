      KATE EDWARDS, 28, is behind the wheel.  She s young and 
      attractive, though she plays it down, opting for a very 
      ordinary appearance.  No make-up, hair in a ponytail, sweats.  
      From the car s hands-free phone:

                                  VOICE MAIL
                    This is Troy, leave a message. 

      BEEP.  Kate leaves a quick message. 

                                  KATE
                    Are you home?  Where are you?  I 
                    need food.  I wanna order 
                      something.  I m craving guacamole.  
                    I m pulling up.       

      Kate steers her car to the curb and parks on an incline.  She 
      nabs the last spot on the street before the red marks.  She 
      pulls the hand brake and gathers her things.  Purse, gym bag, 
      etc.  She gets out. 


      CLOSE ON DETECTIVE BETH DAVIS, 30 s.  A strong presence.  
      Direct with a cold sexuality.  It works for her.  Beth stands 
      before a class of HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS.

                    Stalking is the unwanted or 
                    obsessive attention from one person 
                    to another.

      The MAN SNAPS a PICTURE with his CAMERA PHONE as the WOMAN 
      and CHILD drive away.  Then, the MAN turns and runs off.


      The MAN enters a small apartment.  It s sparse.  A few 
      makeshift pieces of furniture.  Lots of moving boxes.  He 
      hasn t lived here for long.  

                                  BETH (V.O.)
                    And that s where I come in.  I run 
                    the Threat Assessment Unit of the 
                    LAPD -- TAU.  We re responsible for 
                    all stalking cases and threats 
                    against politicians, city and state 
                      employees.  We consult with the 
                    FBI, Secret Service, and CIA. 

      The MAN rips his sweaty shirt off, grabs a bottle of water 
      from the fridge.  Then, goes to a bare wall -- almost bare -- 
      there s two pictures taped to it.  One of the WOMAN and one 
      of the CHILD.  He stares at them.  Beat. 


      Beth looks around.  The class is moderately interested.

                    It s our job to assess the level of

                    crazy chick after her too. 

      Beth is used to this -- she smiles. 

                                  BETH
                    Keep in mind, celebrity stalking 
                    makes up only ten percent of all 
                    stalking cases.  Most victims are 
                    just like you and me.

                    I m not stalking anyone.

      This is followed by a ROOM of YELLING PEOPLE.


      It s the middle of a horrific parent/counselor session.  The  
      counselor, MR. ADAMS, 40 s, calm, rational, is rubbing his 
      temples as he sits behind his desk facing TWO STUDENTS and 
      their PARENTS--

      LINDSAY SUTTON, 16, cheerleader, outgoing, college bound.  
      She s with her mom, TESS SUTTON, 40, professional, 
      workaholic, distracted.

      EDDIE BARNES, 16, gangly, loner, introvert.  He sits with his 
      father, BEAU BARNES, 45, ex-military, alcoholic, asshole. 

      And Beth.  Who sits between the two sparring sides.

                    Could we lower our volume?  No one 
                    is accusing anyone--

                    Why would my boy do that?  You re

                    Mr. Adams asked me here today so we 
                    can have a rational dialogue about 
                    this he said/she said -- now, if I

                    account?  

      Beth holds up PRINTED IMAGES from Facebook -- the PHOTOS 
      appear to be of the S&M/DOMINATRIX variety.

                    No way, why would I do that?  I m

      Beth continues to stare -- he stares back, refusing to look 
      away.  It s eerie.

                                  TESS
                    A pervert is exactly what he is.   
                    We need a restraining order.    

      Beau has heard enough.  He rises, angry.

      Beth is approached by TWO TAU DETECTIVES:  

      DETECTIVE BEN CALDWELL, a youthful 40, tries too hard with 
      the ladies, not enough with everyone else.  He s a climber 
      and he wants to go the easy way.

      DETECTIVE JANICE LAWRENCE, 40.  A flashy woman, the slightest 
      trace of Southern roots.  Full of an unconscious sexuality.  
      Which is not always a good thing.  She can be underestimated, 
      which is a mistake because she s usually the smartest person 
      in the room.

                    Good record, decorated.  So why the 
                    stalker s unit?  

      Jack s eyes linger on Beth.  Is he flirting? 

                                  JACK
                    I m hoping to meet Scarlett Johan--

                                  BETH
                    It s an entirely different skill 
                    set.  Our goal is to prevent 
                    crimes, not solve them.  There s a 
                    lot of case management.  A 
                      background in mental illness is 
                      necessary.  Have you read the 
                    manual? 

                                  JACK
                    No, but I watched Fatal Attraction, 
                    Obsessed, My Bodyguard, Cape Fear, 
                    Swimfan--
                          (off her look)
                    Yes, I read the manual.  That was a 
                    joke.  

      Beth is suspect.  This guy is not making a good impression. 

                                  BETH
                    The manual is 1400 pages long. 

                                  JACK
                    It s one thousand, four hundred and 
                      thirty-seven pages long and I m 
                    well versed in mental illness.  
                      Everything from delusional 
                      psychosis, schizophrenia, manic 
                      depression, substance dependency, 
                      narcissism, paranoia, erotomania, 
                    my own... another joke.  I get it.  
                    It s a very specific whack job that 
                    stalks and makes threats. 

                                  BETH
                    Again, why do you want to be in 
                    this unit? 

      Beth isn t rude.  Just curt.  Jack is confused.

                    I m already in this unit.  I filled 
                    out the paperwork, it was 
                      processed.  Am I wrong?

                    No.

                    Because this was starting to feel 
                    like an interview. 

      Beth rises.  

                                  BETH
                    You ll trail me for the first month 
                    and then we ll pair you off.

                                  JACK
                    Did I say something wrong?  

                                  BETH
                    What do you mean? 

                                  JACK
                    I m getting a vibe, like, I just 
                    made a really bad first impression.  
                    I know that Scarlett Johansson 
                    comment was lame--

                                  BETH
                      A viiiibe? 

      Did he really just say  vibe ? 

                                  JACK
                    Yeah, like you don t like me. 

      Beth shrugs.  He s perceptive.  

                                  BETH
                    Don t be silly.  I m sporadically 
                    rude.  

      Just then, Janice is TAPPING on the glass, holding a file.  
       I need you.   Beth exits.  

      Jack ponders the last few minutes.  That didn t go well.  He 
      has no idea what to make of this woman.  But he quickly 
      follows after her.     UNT. KEVIN WILLIAMSON PROJECT    NETWORK DRAFT 1/22/14       14. 



      Janice and Ben walk with Beth, handing her a file. 

                                  JANICE
                    Homicide was here.  Just dumped a 
                    murder on us.

      Janice looks Jack up and down.  

                                  JANICE
                          (shakes hands)

                    I m Ben Caldwell.  Nice to meet 
                    you.

      The two men shake hands. 

                                  BETH
                    Any prior case file?  

                                  JANICE
                    She s not one of ours.  Fell

      Beth takes the file.  Looks to Jack. 

                                  BETH
                    Let s go, new guy. 

      Beth heads out.  Jack chases after her. 


      Beth and Jack enter, passing a FEW UNIFORMS that stand watch.  
      The apartment is a modest two bedroom.  TWO SID TECHNICIANS 
      (Scientific Investigation Division) are taking PHOTO 
      EVIDENCE. 

                                  SID TECH 
                    We re almost done.  

      Beth shrugs.  She looks around.  Jack watches her sift 
      through the mail.  He disappears into the bedroom while Beth 
      looks in the fridge.  Sees leftovers.  A sense of life.  And 
      tragedy.  Beth connects.  She follows Jack into--  


      Beth looks around the room.  Goes to the closet, peeks in. 
      Jack comes back from the bathroom. 

                                  BETH
                    She hasn t lived here long.  This 
                    place is barely lived in.  Her mail 
                    goes to a mailbox center.  She s 
                    hiding from someone. 

                                  JACK
                    Because she was terrified. 

      Beth turns to him, curious.  

                                  BETH
                    How so?  

      Beth is challenging Jack.  He accepts -- launching into what 
      will become his signature soliloquy. 

                                  JACK
                    In the bathroom, she has a clear 
                    shower curtain so no one can hide 
                    behind it.  

      Jack jumps to the floor on his stomach and illustrates.

                      A platform bed, close to the ground 
                    so no one can hide under it.  She s 
                    horror movie proof.  She didn t 
                    feel safe, hadn t in a long time.  
                    Look at the room, for an interior 
                    designer, it s not feng shui at 
                    all.  The bed should be on that 
                    wall, facing the door, no?

      Jack races over to the door, leans into the hallway and 
      CLICKS ON the hall light and then SHUTS the bedroom door.  
      Then, he runs back to bed and hops on it, pretending to be 
      Kate sleeping.

                                  JACK
                    She sleeps on the left of the bed, 
                    note the cluttered side table, on 
                    her side, facing the door to watch 
                    for a shadow, the footsteps of her 
                    stalker, to appear under the door.  
                    She had trouble sleeping but 
                    refused to take Ambien.  There s a 
                    full prescription from a year ago 
                    in the medicine cabinet.  She was 
                    too afraid to sleep.

                                  BETH 
                    And her stalker?

      Beth urges him to continue.  

                                  JACK
                    It s a man.  Let s face it.  The 
                    barbaric violence of burning 
                    someone alive has  us men  written 
                    all over it.  She reported several 
                    break-ins but nothing stolen. 
                    He likes role playing.  He wants 
                    his fantasy so he breaks into her 
                    apartment while she s gone.  Sleeps 
                    in her bed, eats her food, watches 
                    her TV, lives in her world.  He 
                    would leave little clues so she 
                    would know he was here or just to 
                    make her crazy.  Suffers from 
                      erotomania? 

      Beth nods.  Yes.  Okay, she s impressed.  But, she refuses to 
      acknowledge it.  

                                  BETH
                    What set him off?  The predator you 
                    described likes the journey.  He 
                    doesn t want it to end.  Why kill

                    told her when next door became

                    I was here.  Alone.

                    Was Kate seeing anybody?

                    Not recently.  She wasn t in any 
                    state for that.  The last guy was 
                    over a year ago.  A banker, Larry 
                    Myers, he was married but she 
                    didn t know that when they started 
                    seeing each other.  When she found

                    Can I use your restroom?  I can t 
                    pee next door, it s a quasi crime

      Troy smartens up.

      Troy tears up.  Beth looks daggers at Jack. 

                                  BETH
                    Yes, hold it, Jack. 
                          (to Troy)
                    Did Kate suspect Larry Myers?   

                                  TROY
                    At first.  She asked him point 
                    blank but he denied it and she 
                    didn t want to falsely accuse him.  
                    He was married with kids. 

      Beth smiles.  Thank you.  


      LARRY MYERS, 40 s, balding, very prim, stuffed and pressed.  
      He sits at his computer, working.  

      His wife ELLEN, 40 s, can be seen in the kitchen -- TV on.  
      TWO TEENS wander through.  The DOORBELL RINGS.  Ellen starts 
      for the door.

                    Larry, two detectives are here. 

      OFF LARRY S SURPRISE--


      Jack is home with a beer and take-out.  He sits on the floor 
      and eats off an upturned box.  




                                                                              (CONTINUED)    UNT. KEVIN WILLIAMSON PROJECT    NETWORK DRAFT 1/22/14       23. 

      CONTINUED:

      A flat screen TV sits on the floor in the corner.  SAY 
      ANYTHING is on.  John Cusack woos Ione Skye in the 
      background.  

      Jack has a file on KATE EDWARDS spread out on the floor.  Her 
      life, schedule, friends, contacts, family photos, etc. 

                                  JACK
                     I gave her my heart and she gave 
                    me a pen.  

      Jack turns to the TV just as Cusack in a phone booth in the 
      rain says,  I gave her my heart and she gave me a pen.   Jack 
      has a devilish romantic side.  He gets up, searches-- 

      He finds a box.  Opens it.  He pulls out a HIGH SCHOOL 
      YEARBOOK and flips through it.  He finds his high school 
      picture of himself.  Eek.  Bad hair, all ears.  He goes to 
      another page.  He finds a PHOTO of a girl -- the younger 
      version of the woman he followed earlier.  A quiet stare.    


      Beth brushes her teeth.  She spits, wipes her mouth, turns 
      out the light.  She moves around her small house.  Locks the 
      doors.  Checks the windows.  Her ritual--


      Beth enters, closes the door.  She crawls into bed with her 
      work.  Her files, laptop, etc.  It s all in front of her.

      She flips through Kate Edward s file.  She pushes it aside 
      and opens another file -- EDDIE BARNES.  It contains his 
      school transcripts, class schedule, etc.  She peruses it.  
      YAWNING, she pushes everything to other side of the bed -- 
      the empty side.  She turns off the lamp on the side table. 

      Beth curls up on her side, staring ahead.  CUT TO BETH S POV: 
      Her bedroom door.  The hall light shines from the crack 
      underneath.  She lays there, eyeing it.  A long silence-- 


      They chit chat.  The elevator doors open and Rick gets out--

                                  RICK
                    See ya tomorrow.  

      The doors close.  Lori continues alone in the elevator.  She 
      checks her emails on her phone.  DING.  The ELEVATOR DOORS 
      OPEN REVEALING -- A MASKED MAN.  

      Lori looks up and is instantly DOUSED with GASOLINE from the 
      SPRAY GUN in the MAN S HAND.  It splatters all over her and 
      the elevator.   

      She SCREAMS, gas is in her eyes, blinding her.  She fights 
      back, instinctively lunging forward, eyes burning, hitting 
      the button panel, striking at the MAN.  

      The MASKED MAN stumbles back out of the elevator as the DOORS 
      SHUT.  Silence.  Lori SIGHS relief until she realizes the 
      elevator isn t moving.  Just then, the doors SLIDE OPEN 
      again.  Her ATTACKER is still there.  He strikes a match as--

      Lori rises, lunging... she WHACKS the MAN in the face with 
      her shoulder bag.  The match goes out.  The ELEVATOR DOORS 
      CLOSE AGAIN.  She presses a button.  The elevator begins to 
      move.  She SCREAMS, panicked and scared.  The doors open on 
      another floor where--  

      TWO PEOPLE ARE WAITING.  She SCREAMS HYSTERICALLY, terrified 
      for her life.  As Lori crawls out of the elevator and into 
      the arms of safety--

                                        ACT TWO


      Beth gets out of the elevator and is met by Jack. 

                                  JACK
                    Lori Canton, 30, works in finance, 
                    downtown.  BNY Mellon, attacked in 
                    the parking garage.  First 
                    responders handled the report.

    As Beth looks it over.  

                                  BETH
                    How is she? 

                                  JACK
                    Her eyes suffered some burns but 
                    she s okay.  She ll be released 
                    today.  

                                  BETH
                    Have you talked to her? 

                                  JACK
                    I was waiting for you. 
                          (then)
                    Good morning. 

      Jack directs Beth towards the victim s door.  TWO OFFICERS 
      stand guard.

                    Morning. 

      Beth enters.  Jack follows her into the room. 


      Lori is in the bed.  Her eyes are swollen and red from the 
      gasoline.  She s part angry, part traumatized.  

                                  LORI
                    I don t know who s doing this.  
                    He s been harassing me for over a 
                    year now.  Letters, gifts... I 
                    thought it was harmless.  

                                  BETH
                    Why didn t you call the police? 

                                  LORI
                    I know the law.  You can t 
                    prosecute someone for scaring you.  
                    He never hurt or threatened me.  

                                  JACK
                    Help me understand, Lori.  You were 
                    stalked for fourteen months but 
                    never contacted the police?  

                                  LORI
                    At first, I thought it was a prank 
                    from a friend and then I figured 
                    whoever was doing it was harmless.  
                    I didn t mind until he started 
                    sending flowers and gifts to my 
                    office.  My boss is already 
                      questioning all the gifts. 

                                  JACK
                    So you liked having a stalker.  

                                  LORI
                    No, it was annoying but it was just 
                    a bunch of letters and stuffed 
                    animals.  Who cares?

      Jack and Beth share a look.  Beth looks back at her. 

                                  BETH
                    Do you know Kate Edwards?

                    my apartment before me.  I took

                    She was murdered two nights ago.  
                    She was burned alive. 

      Lori freezes.  Oh my God.   


      Beth and Jack walk to the elevators.  She talks to a GUARDING

                    Stalkers move from one victim to

                                  JACK
                    Which you told her about? 

                                  KURT
                    Yep, I knew Kate needed someone to 
                    take over the lease.  Just trying 
                    to help a friend out.  

                                  JACK
                    Out of curiosity, Kurt, is Wild 
                    your real last name?  

      Kurt smiles.  

                                  KURT
                    The truth?  I did some soft core 
                    when I first moved here.  It s all 
                    over the net.  It killed any chance 
                    of an acting career but, the name 
                    stuck.  I kept it. 

                                  JACK
                    Is everyone in LA an actor?    

                                  KURT
                    No, everyone in LA used to be an 
                    actor.

                    I have to ask.  Where were you last 
                    night at 10 PM?

                      Seriously?  Right here.  Guess I 
                    could pull the surveillance footage 
                    to prove it.  

      Kurt points to the surveillance cameras everywhere. 

                                  JACK
                    If we need it.  Do you know a Larry

                    Yes, he takes my class or did.  I 
                    haven t seen him for a while.  He 
                    was friends with Kate.

                    Yeah, I don t know how close but 
                    you should ask Troy.  He would 
                    know.

                    Yeah, he s right over there. 

      Kurt points to REVEAL TROY GUNN who can be seen in the MAIN 
      GYM.  He s working out on a curl machine.  Jack is surprised 
      to see him there. 


      Jack approaches TROY GUNN who is in the middle of the arm

                    I was checking the gym out.  I m

                    sort of grieving workout? 

      Troy is instantly offended by this.

                    What are you implying?

                    Exactly what it sounds like.  Do 
                    you know Lori Canton? 

                                  TROY

      Annoyed, Troy walks away. 


      A UNIFORM COP stands in the open doorway.  Jack enters.  The 
      COP points toward the bedroom.  He sees a SID TECHNICIAN 
      processing for possible evidence.

                    Cool building.  I should have 
                    looked in this area.  What s the

      Jack immediately sees the bed where a SEA OF STUFFED ANIMALS 
      exist.  He goes to them for a closer look.

                    Guess who I ran into at the gym.  
                    Kate s neighbor, Troy Gunn.  He 
                    knows Lori Canton too.  No alibi.

      He studies the walls and ceiling.  Beth watches.  Jack s eyes 
      go to the closet which is open with a full length mirror on 
      the door.  It reflects the bathroom and shower stall.  He 
      looks opposite and sees the panels in the ceiling.  It s an 
      old building and the wood work is from another era.

      He points to the ceiling.  He grabs a chair and a tennis 
      racket, climbs up and pushes on the ceiling until some wood 
      planks move.  There s a CLICK and the ceiling opens up.

      Jack climbs it and looks into the space just above the 
      ceiling.  It s dark and eerie.  He uses a FLASHLIGHT APP from 
      his PHONE to guide the way.  It s a cramped space.  He finds

      Lindsay and TWO FRIENDS sit at a table, studying.  Lindsay s

      Lindsay grabs her bag and books and heads out, TEXTS her mom. 
       Gotta stop by locker. 5 min. 


      The hallway is dimly lit.  A FEW STUDENTS come and go but 
      it s mostly deserted.  Lindsay is at her locker, grabbing a 
      notebook.  She starts out when--

                                  EDDIE (O.S.)
                    Why d you tell you everybody?

                    Stay away from me.

                    Now you admit to it. 

      Lindsay can t help but snap back.  He s very apologetic.

                    Sorry about that.  I couldn t say 
                    anything in front of my Dad.  He d

      Lindsay keeps walking, angered.  She s also growing terrified 
      by the second.  She DIALS HER CELL PHONE when Eddie KNOCKS it 
      out of her hand.  It hits the floor, sliding down the hall. 

                                  EDDIE
                    Oh, I m sorry, I ll get it for you.

      WTF?  This kid is off.  Eddie goes for the phone while 
      Lindsay runs in the opposite direction.  She races to the end 
      of the hall to the nearest EXIT DOORS.  But, they re locked.  

      Eddie picks up her phone, turns back to her, sweetly.

      She s completely freaked out.

                    Yes.

      He forces her to take her phone back.  Then, he stares at her 
      again.  Smiles.  Her fear arousing him.  

                                  EDDIE
                    I really want to kiss you right

      Lindsay SCREAMS, she pushes past him and disappears down the 
      hallway.  OFF EDDIE, innocent, confused.

                    think my client stalked Kate 
                    Edwards and then when she moved, he 
                    couldn t resist stalking the new 
                    tenant.  Then he killed one and 
                    tried to kill the other?

                    I didn t kill Kate Edwards.

                    We found fingerprints and semen in 
                    the ceiling s crawl space of Kate s 
                    former apartment.  

      There is a two-way glass on one wall.

                    I believe the semen has yet to be 
                      identified.  Regarding the crawl 
                    space -- Larry?

                                  LARRY
                    Kate used it for storage.  I helped 
                    her put some boxes up there over a 
                    year ago.  My fingerprints could 
                    easily be there.

                    year ago with Kate Edwards but he 
                    doesn t even know Lori Canton and 
                    it doesn t matter.  He has alibis 
                    for both crimes.

                    I ll have that thrown out for an 
                    improper warrant issue.  You need 
                    to charge my client or let him go.

      Beth and Jack meet in the hallway.

                    We need to talk to his wife.  
                    The only way to charge him is to 
                    disprove his alibis.  She s gotta 
                    be lying. 

                                  BETH
                    Agreed.  Have they found anything 
                    on the footage?

                    He was definitely stalking Kate 
                    Edwards but there s nothing on Lori

                    It s a lot of footage.  Mainly just 
                    Kate sleeping.  Sometimes he hid 
                    his camera on a bookshelf, it gave 
                    him a view of the bathroom.

      Jack sits at a computer scrolling through FOOTAGE.  He 
      watches as Beth walks Tess and her daughter to the elevator.  
      She s warm and comforting.  Jack takes note.  He hasn t

                    It was supposed to be fun.  Kurt 
                    said no one would get hurt.  It was 
                    harmless.  We each picked a girl to 
                    follow.  I picked Kate.

                                  JACK
                    But you dated Kate?

                    She noticed me.  So Kurt told me to 
                    ask her out.  He coached me.

      Larry nods, ashamed.  Beth hates this guy right now.

                    It was better that way.  The

                    Why did Kurt want them dead? 

                                  LARRY
                    He wanted to start over.  With a 
                    new game.  With two new picks.  

      Jack looks to Beth s side.  He sees her slide her hand under 
      her leg to keep it from trembling.  She s enraged-- 


      Jack convenes with her in the hall, concerned. 

                                  JACK
                    You okay? 

      Beth nods as Janice and Ben approach.

                    She was released from the hospital 
                    and is being taken to a friend s 
                    house.  Police are with her. 

      Beth is relieved to hear this.    UNT. KEVIN WILLIAMSON PROJECT    NETWORK DRAFT 1/22/14       45. 



      TWO POLICE OFFICERS search the living room.  Lori is there. 

                                    OFFICER
                    All clear.

                    I ll just be a minute.  I need to 
                    pack a few things.  

      Lori goes into her bedroom.  


      Lori starts to close the door but one of the OFFICERS pushes 
      it back open.  

                                    OFFICER
                    If you don t mind.

                      A compromise. 

      The officer closes the door midway.  Then, he turns his back.  
      Lori goes to the closet and grabs an overnight bag.  She puts 
      a few things in it.  

      Lori reaches into the closet for some clothes.  In the mirror 
      attached to the door -- the bedroom is reflected.  The floor 
      is covered with an area rug.  Suddenly, it moves.

      Lori doesn t see it.  She pulls off her top and finds another 
      one.  If she d only look in the mirror, she d see--

      The rug BULGE from underneath as something pushes up from 
      under it.  Then, it becomes clear -- it s a hand.  It finds 
      it s way from under the rug.  Then, the hand begins to roll 
      the rug backwards REVEALING a hole in the floor.  

      Lori pulls on a top, adjusting it in the mirror, when she 
      sees KURT WILD rising from a hole in the floor.  Off her

      A SEARCH TEAM has been assembled.  Beth and Jack inspect the

      Beth is worked up but she calms herself, plays it cool.

      The gym is closed.  Huge and eerie in the night.  Kurt has 
      Lori and is dragging her through a weight room.  She WHIMPERS 
      and BEGS.  

                                  LORI
                    Please... stop.  

      Kurt brings her into--


      A room of spin bikes.  Kurt drags her to a particular bike. 

                                  KURT
                    It was the third row, right?  This 
                    is where I first met you.  Get on.

      She looks at him.  What?  He shoves her.  

                                  KURT
                    Do it.

      Kurt reaches for a roll of electrical tape.  He puts one hand 
      on a bike bar and wraps tape around her hands, taping them to 
      the bike s handle bars.  She SCREAMS, begs...

                                  LORI
                    Kurt, don t do this.  

                                  KURT
                    It s okay.  We re going to do a 
                    quick run.

      Kurt is completely delusional now.  His mental illness runs 
      deep.  He tapes her feet to the bike s pedals, trapping her 
      on the bike.  A sick and twisted sight. 

                                  KURT
                    Do you remember what you said when 
                    I asked you out?

                    You lied.  You think I didn t know.  
                    I KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU.  

      Tears stream down Lori s face.  She s terrified.

                    know about friendship?  I helped

                    shit.  I was there for you.  What 
                    did you do for me?  

      Kurt grows emotional and upset. 

                                  KURT
                    I was so proud of you.  You got 
                    your fancy new job, you know how 
                    proud I was of you--

                    I know.  You bought me flowers.  It 
                    was so thoughtful--

      Kurt STRIKES her.  She flies sideways, tilting off the bike, 
      her taped hands and feet keeping her from falling off. 

                                  KURT
                    Don t patronize me.

                    We were so perfect.  You and me.  
                    But now it has to end. 

      Kurt touches her face.  He leans in close.  She can feel his 
      BREATH on her.  She tries to pull away.  

                                  LORI

                    It s not healthy what I m doing.  
                    It has to stop.  The game is over.  
                    Kate is already dead.  It s your 
                    turn now-- 

      She stares at him, SHOCKED and BEWILDERED.

                    We took it too far.

                    We re going to do this together.  

      Kurt begins to douse himself with GASOLINE.  He s going to 
      kill them both.  


      Both Kurt and Lori hear the NOISE.  Lori SCREAMS. 

                                  LORI
                    Help meeeeeeee.

      Kurt looks through the GLASS WALL of the SPIN ROOM and sees 
      Jack rising, racing towards them.  He reaches into his pocket 
      and withdraws MATCHES.  He starts to STRIKE them when--

                    No, wait, you don t wanna do this.

      Kurt looks at her.  What?  Lori looks to see Jack and OTHERS 
      race across the gym towards them.  She s buying time.

                    date and get to know each other...  

      Kurt stares at her.  Are her words working?  It s just enough 
      for Jack and SEVERAL OFFICERS to enter, guns drawn.

                    Don t move.  

      Kurt turns to face Jack and the COPS, guns poised and aimed.

                    I m sorry...

      He goes to STRIKE the match when JACK FIRES HIS GUN.  A 
      SINGLE SHOT HITS Kurt in the shoulder.  He flies back to the 
      floor.  It s enough to stabilize him.  The COPS surround him. 

      Beth enters -- she races to Lori and helps free her from the 
      bike.  Lori falls into Beth s arms.  Beat.  Beth looks to 
      Jack.  It s a look of appreciation and respect.  


      Jack enters his apartment.  Rocked by his encounter.  He goes 
      to the wall and looks at PHOTOS of the WOMAN and CHILD taped 
      to it.  He stares at them both until he s forced to lower his 
      head as the hurt becomes too much.  


      Beth checks to make sure the front door is locked, then the 
      windows.  The nightly ritual.  She CLICKS off the light 
        illuminating a FIGURE standing outside the window.  She 
      doesn t see it -- standing in the yard.
