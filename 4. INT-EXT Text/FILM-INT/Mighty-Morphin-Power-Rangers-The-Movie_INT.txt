PROP PLANE / FLYING - DAY

The six Power Rangers, TOMMY, KIMBERLY, BILLY, AISHA, ADAM and
ROCKY sport sleek sky diving suits, parachute packs and
helmets.
Tommy is strapped into a high-tech airboard.
ROCKY
We're OUTTA here!!
KIMBERLY
Easy, Rock.
TOMMY
Once we hit the target zone we've
got fifteen seconds to make the
drop.
BULK
(0 . S .)
Step aside, pinheads.
BULK and SKULL push their way through the Rangers, decked
in bizarre skydiving regalia, topped off by World War II
leather caps and aviator goggles.
BULK
The Stealth Eagle is about to
fly.
SKULL
Ditto for the Swooping Swallow.
The Rangers exchange amused looks.
Aisha gestures to them
AISHA
Lead on, flyboys.
Bulk and Skull swagger to the door and open it - the ground
is a dizzying distance below.
They swallow hard.
SKULL
Bulk... where'd the earth go?
BILLY
Five seconds to the target zone!
TOMMY
Aisha
you' re

Bulk and Skull step aside, Aisha LAUNCHES herself.
The others follow through the opening with flair.
ROCKY
Stylin!
ADAM
On your tail!
BILLY
All systems
Tommy and Kimberly share an infectious glance, Kimberly
a hand, indicating Tommy should go first.
TOMMY
Surf's up!
He's gone.
Kimberly stands backwards in the doorway.
KIMBERLY
Catch you on the flipside.
Bulk and Skull watch wide-eyed as she BACK-FLIPS
out of the plane.

They take deep breaths then CHARGE THE DOOR.

ERNIE'S WATERFRONT CAFE - DAY
13A
CLOSE ON - T.V.
SCREEN
We see the reporter then a few cuts of GEOLOGISTS combing the
site with scanning equipment and COPS sealing off the area with
yellow tape.
REPORTER
... Angel Grove Police have
cordoned off the area until it
can be determined whether or not
the unidentified object poses any
threat.
The injured workman was
quoted as saying...
PULL BACK TO REVEAL A CAFE.
The Rangers are at a table -- Tommy is teaching Fred martial arts
moves.
TOMMY
It's one smooth move and then
you've gotta explode off the top.
Tommy executes a wicked JUMPING ROUNDHOUSE KICK.
Fred is
wowed.
He drops into position.
TOMMY
Nice and easy.
The jovial proprietor, ERNIE, approaches the Rangers' table
with a loaded tray.
Fred pulls off a dazzling JUMPING
ROUNDHOUSE KICK and almost knocks Ernie's tray over.
ERNIE
Hey, no Karate on the patio!
FRED
Actually, Ernie, it's Tae-Kwan
Doe.
ERNIE
Well Tae-Kwan-Do-it some place
else.
Fred moves off as Ernie serves the desserts.
ERNIE
So, what're the plans for the
weekend?
KIMBERLY
Aisha and.I are checking out a
new dance spot.
AISHA
I heard that!
BILLY
I'll be at the Observatory
Sunday.
ERNIE
That's right - Ryan's Comet.
ROCKY
We should throw a little comet
shindig.
ADAM
Any excuse for a party.
Aisha reacts to something off screen.
AISHA
The Eagle has landed.
Bulk and Skull swagger past followed by a GROUP OF KIDS.
BULK
The earth was hurtling toward us
at seven hundred miles per hour,
and we knew at that moment that
we were facing death straight in
the eye.
SKULL
We could smell it's breath.
Ernie moves off after Bulk and Skull.
Tommy's wrist
communicator BEEPS.
The kids exchange glances than look for a
private area.
ROCKY
There's a spot over there.
They move out of everybody's sight.
TOMMY (into
communicator)
What's up, Alpha?
ALPHA 5 (V.O.)
Rangers, we need you at the
Command
Center,
L.R.N. !
Aisha gives Kimberly a puzzled look.
KIMBERLY
'Like Right Now.'
TOMMY
We're on our way.
They hit their wrist-communicators and instantly TRANSFORM
INTO SIX IRIDESCENT COLUMNS OF COLOR.
The columns SHOOT UP
THROUGH a giant oak tree, KNOCKING LEAVES LOOSE.

CONIMAND CENTER

NIGHT

Everything's gone haywire
buttons BLINK, emergency
lights FLASH, there's a CACOPHONY OF ELECTRONIC SOUNDS.
ALPHA 5 works frantically amidst the array of computer
banks while ZORDON looks on from his COLUMN OF LIGHT.
The six Rangers MATERIALIZE, Tommy turns to Zordon.
TOMMY
What's happening?
ALPHA 5
Ay,
yi,
yi,
yi,
yi !
Our
thermionic-sensors have been hit
by a CATACLYSMIC surge of evil!
ZORDON
Rangers, you must act swiftly.
The planet is in GRAVE danger!
KIMBERLY
Danger from what?
ZORDON
Six thousand years ago a
morphological being known as Ivan
Ooze, ruled the world with a
reign of unparalleled terror.
Finally, a rebel factor known as
the "Order of the Meledon" lured
him into a hyperlock chamber and
buried him deep underground.
ALPHA 5
In a place that came to be known
as Angel Grove.
ZORDON
The chamber has been accidently
UNCOVERED!
You must return it to
the depths. or
anyone should
open it and Ivan is released!
ALPHA 5
To assist you I have retro-fitted
your helmets with new Opti-Scan
devices.
ZORDON
Use extreme caution, Rangers.
You are dealing with an evil here
that is beyond ALL comprehension.
16
COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT
SMOKE POURS from various circuit boards, numerous control
panels VIBRATE.
ZORDON
Alpha, my sensors tell me the
Rangers were too late!
Ivan is
on his way here!
ALPHA 5
Hey, NOBODY enters the Command
Center without a power coin!
There's a BLEET, BLEET -- emergency lights start FLASHING near
the entrance.
Alpha watches, forlorn, as OOZE SEEPS through
the hairline cracks in the door.
ALPHA 5
Well...
ALMOST nobody.
The ooze SLITHERS AND GURGLES ACROSS THE FLOOR, once again
IVAN RISES UP.
He takes in the state-of-the-art surroundings.
IVAN
Gee... pretty fancy-shmancy.
I
guess if you invest your money
well over SIXTY centuries you can
buy something pretty nice.
Alpha drops into a Karate stance, makes some BRUCE LEE NOISES
then LUNGES.
ALPHA 5
HI ,
YAH !
Ivan holds his arm out, ZAPS Alpha with an electrical charge
Alpha starts spinning.
ALPHA
5
Welcome to Wiener World.
May I
take your order, please?
ZORDON
You haven't changed, Ooze.
You're still picking on creatures
smaller than yourself.
Ivan slowly circles Zordan's column of light, Zordon turns
with him.
IVAN
Put a cork in it "Z" .
Ten
minutes out of the egg and I'm
already listening to one of your
lectures.
(he explodes furiously)
You robbed me of my PRIME!
I was
the Supreme Ruler of the most
foul Empire in the Universe.
I
was the King of Calamity.
The
Duke of Destruction.
The big man
on campus!
(beat)
And then you came along.
You
locked me into your stuffy little
hyperlock-chamber and tossed me
into the depths like yesterdays
TRASH!
ZORDON
It worked for six thousand years.
IVAN
Don't remind me!
IVAN
Do you have any idea what it's
like to be cooped up in a rotten
egg for six thousand years?
It's
BORING!
Not to mention I've had
a Charlie horse since the
Renaissance!
But now the tables
are turned.
Now...
IVAN raises his hands - he
is holding
a flute and he PLAYS A FEW
NOTES
IVAN
... it's time to pay the PIPER!
He uses the flute like a lightning rod --
A BOLT OF LIGHTNING
BLASTS A PANEL TO SMITHEREENS.
IVAN
Oh, the things that I have
missed.
The BLACK PLAGUE!
He blows up another PANEL.
IVAN
The SPANISH INQUISITION!
(another bolt)
The
70's!
HE BLOWS UP ANOTHER PANEL.
Ivan CASTS ANOTHER LIGHTNING BOLT,
DEMOLISHING AN ENERGY PILLAR.
IVAN
And now, finally, I have the
strength to DESTROY your pathetic
powers FOREVER!!
ZORDON
YOU WON'T GET AWAY WITH THIS!
IVAN
I've got a NEWS flash for you
LIGHT-BRIGHT -- I ALREADY HAVE!
Now Ivan begins to THROW LIGHTNING EVERYWHERE, LAYING
THE
COMMAND CENTER TO WASTE.
Ivan laughs in the b.g.
as Alpha continues to spin,
moving
his arms in and out.
ALPHA 5
You put your left probe in, you
put your left probe out, you put
your left probe in and you shake
it all about.
You do the hokey-
pokey and you turn yourself
around...

COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT
22
The place is trashed -- there's SMOKING debris, ravaged
panels,
exposed wires and mechanisms.
The kids move through the
wreckage in numb silence.
TOMMY (barely audible)
... what happened here?...
Adam spots Alpha's arm protruding from a mound of rubble.
ADAM
Guys!
The kids quickly uncover the battered robot.
BILLY
Alpha, are you okay?!
ALPHA 5
I'll GET you my pretty, and your
little DOG toa!!
BILLY
He must've blown an anitromic
demodulator!
KIMBERLY (stunned)
Oh, no...
Everybody follows Kimberly's gaze, thunderstruck expressions
coming over them.
Laying on a destroyed bed of crystals is Zordon.
He is still a
SHIMMERING SPECTRAL being, only now he s aged a good fifty
years.
The kids stand over him, forlorn.
AISHA
... What's happening to him?'
BILLY
Outside of his time warp he's
aging at a vastly acellerated
rate!
KIMBERLY
We have to help him!
Zordon opens his eyes.
ZORDON
...
Rangers... thank goodness
you're safe.
The kids drop down beside him.
TOMMY
We have to get you back inside
your time warp.
ZORDON
I'm afraid that's impossible...
The power has been destroyed.
It's gone... The Zords, the
weapons...
all of it.
(beat)
The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers
are no more.
The kids are stunned.
Kimberly gently takes Zordon's hand.
KIMBERLY
Zordon... you can't leave us.
Ever since you came into our
lives... you've been like another
father `to
us
all.-
ZORDON
... You must be strong... Ivan
almost overthrew the planet
once...
and now I'm afraid he
has the strength to see his
scheme through.
Zordon closes his eyes.
Tommy puts a hand on Kimberly's
shoulder.
The kids slowly rise, all of them looking utterly
despondent.
Billy turns to Alpha.
BILLY
what're we going to do?
ALPHA 5
I do not LIKE Green Eggs and Ham!
I do not like them, Sam-I-am!
Billy opens a panel on Alpha's back, makes an adjustment.
Alpha's head rolls back like he's going to sneeze.
ALPHA 5
Ah-Ah-Ahhhh-CHOO!!
SPARKS BURST from where his nose should be.
He SNIFFS.
ALPHA 5
Thanks, Billy.
Rocky hands Alpha a hanky, Alpha wipes his nose area.
ADAM
There has to be something we can
do.
TOMMY
Come on, guys, think!
Aisha turns to Alpha.
AISHA
Alpha.
Is there any way we can
defeat this
monster?
Any way at
all?
ALPHA 5
... Perhaps there is a way... I
have heard tales of another
power.
ADAM
What?!
ALPHA 5
... They say that somewhere
beyond the Hyperion Constellation
there exists a mythological power
that is beyond all comprehension.
TOMMY
How can we get to it?
ALPHA 5
As the legend goes, the power is
impossible to obtain.
ROCKY
We have to try, Alpha.
It's our
only hope.
Alpha shakes his head.
ALPHA 5
It's far too dangerous.
Zordon
would never allow it.
AISHA
If we don't try, Zordon won't
survive!
ADAM
If Ivan
Ooze
isn't
stopped,
nobody will survive.
Alpha heaves a sigh.
ALPHA 5
Ay, yi, yi, yi.
(beat)
The legend speaks of a Master
Warrior who lives on the planet
Phaedos... This is the only
person who knows the secrets of
the power.
AISHA
How can we reach Phaedos?
Alpha heaves a SIGH.
ALPHA 5
Zordon's going to have my
orbicular spheroids when he hears
out about this!
The kids exchange curious looks as Alpha opens a compartment
and removes a vile filled with RADIOLUMINESCENT ENERGY.
ALPHA 5
This is an emergency reserve of
morphonic emissions.
It should
be enough to get -you there.
He approaches a damaged panel, loads in the vile.
ALPHA 5
There is one problem.
I only
have enough reserve to send you
Phaedos...
I can't bring you
back.
ADAM
So how do we get back?
Alpha gives them a grim look.
ALPHA 5
... You'll have to pray that the
legends are true.
Alpha keys in coordinates.
ALPHA 5
You're sure you want to do this?!
The Rangers share purposeful looks.
TOMMY
It's our only hope.
Alpha shakes his head, punches in the final codes.
ALPHA
Safe journey, Rangers!
He pulls a lever.
ALPHA
5
BE CAREFUL!!
The kids TRANSFORM INTO SIX STREAKS OF COLOR AND BLAST 0FF
THROUGH THE CEILING.
Alpha shakes his head in despair.
ALPHA 5
Ay, yi, yi, yi.
They're DOOMED!!

Zedd, Rita and their minions are inside Zedd's dark palace
Goldar looks through Rita's telescope as Rita rants.
RITA (outraged)
How could he let them slip
through his hands?!
He's no
better than the rest of the hired
help around here!
Goldar looks up from the telescope.
GOLDAR
According to the TX Tracker,
they're headed for Phaedos.
ZEDD
I'm gonna fire that slimeball so
fast his not gonna know what hit
him!
Ivan sweeps regally into the room.
IVAN
Hi, honey, I'm home !
RITA
You garlic-sucking DINGLEBRAIN!
The Rangers are going after the
Great Power
(to
Zedd)
I thought you said this guy was
the Master of Disaster?
(to
Ivan)
He's nothing but a slime-

Ivan SNAPS his hand -- a WAD OF OOZE FLIES OUT, SPLATS RITA
across the mouth, muffling her.
RITA
Rrgh mmffpprr brghuh!!
ZEDD
How dare you?!
Nobody shuts up
Rita but me!
IVAN
Sorry, slick, there's been a
slight'change of plans.
(arms out in trademark stance)
The "booger man" is taking over.
Ivan drops regally into Zedd's chair.
ZEDD
Nobody double-crosses Lord Zedd
and lives!
Mordant slips behind Goldar, using him as a shield.
MORDANT
Zedd's gonna kick this snotball
into next week!
Zedd SHOOTS A BLAST from his staff -- Ivan is COVERED IN SPARKS.
IVAN
Ooooh, that tickles!
Ivan raises his hands and the sparks DISAPPEAR.
IVAN
My turn.
He ZAPS Rita and Zedd, and with a BRILLIANT FLASH, THEY'RE GONE.
Mordant moves to a snow-globe on the table, his mouth falling
open.
Zedd and Rita are INSIDE IT!!
Rita wipes the ooze off her mouth, RANTS IN A MUNCHKIN VOICE.
RITA
This is all your fault!
If you'd
taken me out tonight like you
were suposed to, none of this
would've happened.
Ivan turns menacingly to Goldar and Mordant.
IVAN
Now you have a choice, either
serve me, or join those
insufferable cheesedongs.
Mordant and Goldar exchange a look, then turn back to Ivan.
GOLDAR
We never liked the cheesedongs in
the first place.
MORDANT
Couldn''t stand them -- low-class
all the way.
And did you catch
a whiff of their BREATH?!
It's
like having a conversation with
a couple of ONIONS!
Not to
mention...
Goldar throws a hand over Mordant's mouth, MUFFLING him.
GOLDAR (apologetic)
He's just visiting for the
summer.
(beat)
Now what about,the Rangers, oh
hideous one?
IVAN
Ah yes, the RANGERS!!!
He makes a HOARKING SOUND then SPITS OOZE ONTO THE FLOOR,
MORDANT
Gasunteidt.
Now the OOZE GROWS INTO TEN TENGU WARRIORS -- BIRD-LIKE
CREATURES WITH LONG BEAKS AND ENORMOUS WINGS.
THEY GOBBLE, SQUAWK AND CHIRP like newborn chickens, the
CACOPHONY GROWING LOUDER AND LOUDER until...
IVAN
SHUT YOUR BEAKS !!
The Tengu fall dead silent.
IVAN
Tengu Warriors, you will fly to
Phaedos, find the Power
Rangers...
and TEAR THEM APART!
The creatures make HORRENDOUS SQUAWKING SOUNDS AS THEY SPREAD
THEIR REPTILIAN WINGS.
IVAN
Mordant, go with them and report
back to me!
MORDANT
You know boss, I'd really like to
help out but I've got this
gastronomic condition which rules
out all space trave--
One of the Tengu grabs hold of Mordant and the FLOCK WINGS OFF
LIKE COLOSSAL BATS.
MORDANT
IIIIIII!!!
ANGLE ON - SNOW GLOBE
Zedd waves his arms around in outrage.
ZEDD
Isn't this just TYPICAL!
We
finally do somebody a good turn
and just look what happens!
RITA
From now on it's E-V-I-L, NO

Ivan is walking through a giant chemical plant with Goldar
IVAN
Taking over the world is one
thing.
It's finding good help to
run it for you that's the killer.
GOLDAR
You want me to place a few calls?
Ivan shakes his head.
IVAN
No need.
I'm going to use the
young minds of Angel Grove.
GOLDAR digs for buried treasure deep in his nose.
GOLDAR
No offense, boss, but they might
find you a little disgusting.
IVAN
Yes, well, I suppose you'd know
a little something about that.
(beat)
Not to worry.
I'll ever so
gently lure them in and mold them
into an army of devils!
And what
better way to entice them ...
than with a little Ivan's Ooze?!
Ivan approaches an enormous vat, turns a tap -- it BURPS and
GLOPS as PURPLE OOZE pours out.
GOLDAR
But boss, what about their
parents?
IVAN
Ah, the old and doddering.
I'm
going to SCOURGE their puny
minds, reducing them to ZOMBIE'S.
And then I'll put them to work
rebuilding my empire.
Bulk and Skull enter waving a "help wanted" flier.
Both
them are wearing their garish blazers and dark sunglasses.
SKULL
I understand you're looking for
a few new assistants.
Bulk does a G.Q. stance.
BULK
Well put your mind to rest `cause
now you've got the best.
Ivan doesn't look too pleased.
IVAN
What is this?!
I advertised for
brilliant and good looking
assistants!
Skull extends his hand.
SKULL
Hi, I'm brilliant.
BULK (hand extended)
And I'm good looking.
Ivan steps forward.
IVAN
And I'm Little-Bo-Peep.
Bulk and Skull lower the sunglasses and take a good look
Ivan.
Both of them swallow hard.
SKULL
Bulk... why don't we give Mr.
Peep here a chance to think it
over?
BULK
A stellar idea, Skull.
They start to back away.

Mordant videotapes Ivan as he struts past a giant mechanical

Finally, after centuries of

Mordant gets the camera a little too close to Ivan.

SMASHES against a wall.

Oh, man, that was a rental!

All of them turn their mirrors toward the pyramid.
A BEAM OF
LIGHT SHOOT FROM THE POWER; INTO THE MIRRORS AND BACK IN TO THE
POWER.
We hear a RUMBLING SOUND as the earth starts to SHAKE.
The
Rangers look to each other, horrified.
Then everything falls still and silent... and then a miracle
happens.
We hear a HARMONIOUS, OTHERWORLDLY CHORUS as the pyramid OPENS
UP, REVEALING THE MOST GLORIOUS SOURCE OF LIGHT IN THE
UNIVERSE.
The kids shield their eyes from the brilliance, all of them
wearing wonder-struck expressions.
SIX BEAMS OF COLORED LIGHT SHOOT OUT AND HIT EACH OF THE
RANGERS...
AND THEIR POWER RANGERS UNIFORMS MATERIALIZE ON
THEM!
Their visors are clear so we can see their faces.
TOMMY
WE HAVE THE GREAT POWER!!
Now the symbols in their hands TRANSFORM INTO...
ROCKY
NEW POWER COINS!!
BILLY
OUR MORPHERS ARE ON LINE!
AISHA.
WE DID IT!!
ADAM
HANG ON, ANGEL GROVE.
KIMBERLY

They hit their communicators -- they instantly TRANSFORM INTO
SIX IRIDESCENT COLUMNS OF COLOR AND BLAST OFF.

The Rangers MATERIALIZE in the Command Center with their
helmets off.
AISHA
ALPHA?!
Alpha approaches, speaks in an anguished voice.
ALPHA 5
Rangers...
I'm afraid you're too
late.
AISHA
What?!
ALPHA 5
Zordon...
he's gone.
The Rangers are too stunned to speak.
They approach Zordon's
lifeless form looking absolutely devastated.
KIMBERLY
... This can't be...
They stare at Zordon with gut-wrenching expressions.
They're
utterly defeated.
Eventually, Tommy looks to the others and speaks in a fervent
voice.
TOMMY
"To those who possess the Great
Power...
all things are
possible."
The kids gradually exchange zealous looks.
They form a circle
around Zordon and interlock hands.
They close their eyes, bow their heads...
After a long moment, a SHIMMERING ENERGY BEGINS TO FLOW DOWN
FROM THE RANGERS, INTO ZORDON'S ASTRAL FORM.
Zordon grows BRIGHTER and BRIGHTER and then there's a DAZZLING,
STROBOSCOPIC EXPLOSION.
When the LIGHT FADES WE SEE THE COMMAND CENTER BACK IN ITS
ORIGINAL, PRISTINE FORM.
Zordon's youthful face once again looks down from within his
pillar of light, his eyes filled with a fierce pride.
RANGERS
ZORDON!!
ZORDON
Welcome back, kids.
ADAM
It's good to be back.
Alpha jumps up and down like a child.
ALPHA 5
HE'S ALIVE!
