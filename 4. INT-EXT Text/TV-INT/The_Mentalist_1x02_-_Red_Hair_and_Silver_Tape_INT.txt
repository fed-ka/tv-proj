      and puts his hands over his ears.

      When he opens them again, Jane is standing in the doorway, 
      looking around in that keen but casual way of his.  

                                  JANE
                    Hi.

                                    FRANKIE
                    Who are you?

                                  JANE
                    My name's Patrick Jane.  I'm with 
                    the police.  Is this your sister's *
                    room? *

                                    FRANKIE
                    Yes.  Did someone kill my sister? *

                                  JANE
                    Yes.

                                    FRANKIE
                    Okay.


      Frankie watches Jane take in his sister's room.  Small, super  *
      neat.  Lots of pink stuff, lots of softball stuff.

      Several unfaded patches on the walls where posters have quite 
      recently been taken down.  There's a couple of stuffed toys 
      on the bed, the rest are stacked on top of a cupboard.

      Her cork pinboard is - as with many teenagers - a labor of 
      love, a Myspace page in 3D.  Softball teammates goofing 
      around,  pictures of rock stars and actors.  What Would Jesus 
      Do? stickers.  Cute animals, cartoons, the Virgin of 
      Guadalupe, notes from friends, souvenirs of innocent fun.  We 
      get a sense of a conventional, well behaved, and good hearted 
      jock.  The board is arranged so that the letter H is formed 
      by photos - the one at the center of the H being a recent 
      PHOTO, cut in half, of MELANIE AT A FUN-FAIR.  Smiling 
        ecstatically at someone or something in the missing half of 
      the frame. 

                                  JANE
                    When did she take the posters down?

                          (thinks)
                    After Christmas.

                                  JANE
                    Who was on the posters?

                                    FRANKIE
                            (disdainful)
                    Boys with long hair from the TV.

                                  JANE
                    She didn't like them anymore?

                                    FRANKIE
                    Said they were for little girls.  
                    Do you know who killed her?

                                  JANE
                    No.

      Jane lies down on Melanie's bed, looking at the room as 
      Melanie would have done.  Frankie looks askance at this, like 
      'what are you doing?'  Peering under the bed, then reaching 
      under it, Jane comes up with a cheap RED PLUSH HEART with a 
      comical face on it, like you might win at a fun-fair.  


      Jane puts the heart back where he found it, and sits up in 
      bed.  Frankie looks at him a little skeptically.

                                    FRANKIE
                    Are you going to find out who 
                    killed her?

                                  JANE

                      questions.

                                    FRANKIE
                    When you find him, will you tell

                                  JANE

      RIGSBY and VAN PELT are seated at desks at opposite ends of 
      the room doing that clerical stuff which cops have to do.  
      The scratch of a pen and the clicking of a keyboard and the 
      loud buzz of sexual tension.  This is our first look at CBI

                    a hand? 


      We meet MALCOLM BOATWRIGHT - a fat, genial, egotistical 
      unshaven unkempt bear of a man, mid-30s, part Julian 
      Schnabel, part Donal Logue - and wife SANDRA - a quietly 
      sharp, capable, likeable, Joan Cusack type.  They talk with 
      Jane whilst seated at the proprietor's table, overlooking the 
      main dining area, which has an extensive OUTDOOR TERRACE.  
      It's early lunchtime so only a few tables are occupied.      
      A few tapas size dishes are on the table for tasting.  

                                    MALCOLM
                    She's worked for us three summers 
                    in a row now.  Lovely girl.  

      Jane tries a forkful of something.

                                  JANE
                    Oh this is good.

                                    MALCOLM
                    Yes it is.  

      Lisbon joins them, sitting down with a nod that tells us she 
      and the Boatwrights have already met.

                                  SANDRA
                    It's unbelievable.  And from the 
                    parking lot.  I was practically 
                    right there.  

                                    MALCOLM
                    I can't even think about it.  Try 
                    that.

      He pushes a dish toward Jane and Lisbon.  Jane tries it and 
      eats with pleasure.  

                                  LISBON
                    I won't, thank you.  To your 
                      knowledge, have there been any 
                    incidents with disgruntled co-
                    workers maybe?  Troublesome 
                      boyfriends?

                                  SANDRA
                    No.

      Malcolm shrugs.

                                  JANE
                    Oh that is really good.  Cardamon?

      Malcolm beams.

      Malcolm and Sandra laugh.  Jane has hit on their culinary 
      secret.  Sandra puts a finger to his lips.

                    No, there's no shame in it. 
                    A lot of butter.  The great thing 
                    about food, it's necessity and

                    What time did Melanie leave work 
                    that night?  To build a timeline, 
                    we need to know exactly. 

                                  SANDRA
                    I know she took off first, but
                    I'd need to look at her timecard to 
                    be exact. 

                                    MALCOLM
                    Hey, it wasn't me by the way.  I 
                    have twenty staff that will tell 
                    you.  I only ever leave the kitchen 
                    to take a leak or yell at 
                      customers.

      He gets a smile of rueful affection from Sandra.

                                  SANDRA 
                    Sad but true. 


      A SHEET OF FLAME rises around a SOUS CHEF, 25, as he tosses a 
      dash of oil into a cooking pan, and stirs the contents.  
      Distracted by the appearance of Jane and Lisbon with Malcolm 
      and Sandra, he turns away from the pan, and burns his hand; 
      then gets a good natured whack around the back of the head 
      from Chef Malcolm.  

                                    MALCOLM
                    Attention Randall.  Pay it. 

      Malcolm takes the pan from Randall and starts to show him how 
      to saut  whatever the hell it is. 


      Sandra talks to Jane and Lisbon as she looks for Melanie's 
      timecard.  Jane roams around in characteristic fashion, 
      looking at things casually, but from every angle.  The office 
      is right by the back-door of the restaurant, that lets out 
      onto the parking lot.  No one can exit or enter from the lot 
      without passing the office.

      Sandra's on the phone, listening and uh-huhing.  Melanie 
      comes in, punches out on the time-clock.  An exchange of nods 
      and smiles with Sandra, and Melanie leaves.

      Sandra points to the door.

      A Waitress - RAQUEL, Latina, pudgy, too much make-up, 22 - 
      enters from the lot, starts to enter office, hesitates on 
      seeing all the people.

                    It's okay, Raquel.  Come in.

      Raquel scurries in sideways, all shy, punches in at the time-

      Cho enters to find Raquel seated in a chair.  Lisbon seated

                    Raquel, this is a murder 
                      investigation.  If you protect 
                    someone that did this thing, 
                    you will do time.

                                  RAQUEL
                    I'm sorry I can't help you, ma'am.  
                    I would if I could.  Swear to God.

                                  LISBON
                    Thank you, Raquel.  

      Lisbon stands, looks to Cho. 

                                  CHO
                    Car's clean.

                                  LISBON
                    Have a chat with Raquel why don't 
                    you.  I'll go get the credit card 
                    receipts.

      Lisbon exits.  Cho's about to sit down with Raquel, but Jane 
      pulls him aside and speaks quietly...

                                  JANE 
                    Give me a minute with her.  
                          (indicating Raquel)
                    She's got a super low threshold.  

                                  CHO
                          (firmly)
                    No.  Nope.  No.

                                  JANE 
                    No big thing.  Just stand in the 
                    doorway and pretend you're making a 
                    phone call for a moment. 

                                  CHO
                    No.  It's illegal and it's 
                      unprofessional.

                                  JANE
                    That's why I need you to stand in 
                    the doorway. 

      Beat.  Cho gives.

                                  CHO
                    One minute.

      Jane sits opposite Raquel and anchors her with a finger on 
      her knee and a steady gaze.  Cho stands in the doorway 
      keeping watch.

                                  JANE
                          (holding her gaze the 
                            whole time)
                    Raquel, look at me.

                    Before you fall asleep tonight, 
                    while you're lying there in your 
                    bed relaxing and slowly drifting 
                    off into sleep, I want you to think 
                    of me.  Think of me, then imagine 
                    that you can fly.  Imagine that 
                    you're weightless.  You can float 
                    gently into the air if you want to.  
                    Safe and calm and serene.  You can 
                    fly away and leave all your burdens 
                    and worries and fears behind you. 
                    Imagine that.  What a nice feeling 
                    it is.  
                          (beat)
                    Next time you see me, when I say 
                    hello, you will remember that good 
                    feeling and you will want to tell me 
                    the truth because when you do tell me 
                    the truth you'll feel that a heavy 
                    weight has been lifted from your 
                      shoulders.  I'll say hello and you'll 
                    feel light as a feather, as if you 
                    were floating on air.  Why don't you 
                    sit here a moment and think about that 
                    before you go back to work?

      Jane taps her on the knee, breaks his gaze, and stands up.  
      Raquel's like - this guy's a loon. 

                                  RAQUEL
                    Uh, whatever.   

      Raquel looks to Cho as he re-enters.

                                  RAQUEL (CONT D)
                    Your friend is crazy.  Can I go 
                    now?

      Cho smiles, assuming that the hypnosis was a failure.

                                  CHO
                    Yes.  

      Raquel hastens away.  In answer to Cho's sardonic glance, 
      Jane shrugs... 


                                  JANE
                    It worked on the chicken.


      Cho levers opens the padlocked locker with bolt-cutters.  
      Jane and Lisbon and the Sheriff look on. 


                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE MENTALIST    "Red Hair & Silver Tape"    CHERRY 7/17/08    17.

      Inside they find... Melanie's purity ring, a spare T-shirt, a 
      few toiletries, and a folded slip of paper flutters out and 
      falls on the floor.  On it someone has written the one word - 
      'SORRY.' 

                                  CHO 
                          (heavy irony)
                    Hey, maybe that's a clue.

      Lisbon is about to bag up the slip of paper...

                                  JANE
                    Wait.  Better idea.

      Lisbon sighs.


      Shepherded by Malcolm and Sandra, the entire twenty strong  
      staff of the restaurant is gathered, abuzz with the drama of 
      it all.  Jane, Lisbon and Cho are watching.  

                                    MALCOLM
                    Settle down now everyone.  Settle 
                    down.  These are agents of the 
                      California Bureau of Investigation.  
                    They want to talk to you a moment. 

                                  SANDRA
                    Nothing to worry about. 

      Jane stands up on a chair.  Waits for silence, which comes 
      quickly, off his deadly serious expression.  

                                  JANE
                    We need your help.  Will you give 
                    us your help?  

                                  ALL
                    YES.

                                  JANE
                    We know the identity of Melanie's 
                    killer.  The murderer of that poor 
                    girl is in this room.

      Jane pauses for effect.  General gasps of dismay.  With a 
      graceful flourish, Jane takes the slip of paper from his 
      pocket and holds it up for everyone to see.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    This note was found in Melanie's 
                    locker.  We have strong reason to 
                    believe that whoever wrote this 
                    note is the killer. 

      Even bigger general gasps.  
                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE MENTALIST    "Red Hair & Silver Tape"    CHERRY 7/17/08    18.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Yes.  Unluckily for that person, my 
                    colleague Agent Cho here is the 
                    bureau's chief graphologist. 
                    Each one of you is going to give us 
                    a sample of your handwriting, left 
                    and right-handed.  Cho will examine 
                    the samples and determine which of 
                    you left this note.  Which of you 
                    is the killer?

      For his own amusement, Jane has taken his performance into 
      melodrama, and some of the staff are on the verge of 
      giggling, but the SOUS CHEF who burnt himself earlier - his 
      name's RANDALL - looks very serious.  He makes a faint noise 
      as if about to speak, then faints dead away.  Jane turns to 
      Lisbon...

                    Voila.

      FADE IN:


      Cho questioning Randall.

                                  CHO
                    Randall, why did you want to say 
                    sorry to Melanie?

                                    RANDALL
                    I didn't kill her.

                                  CHO
                    I didn't say that you did.  I asked 
                    why you wanted to say sorry to her. 

      No answer from Randall.  But Cho can see he's ready to talk.

                                  CHO (CONT D)
                    Your timecard and your boss say you 
                    left work ten minutes before 
                    Melanie.  You waited for her in the 
                    parking lot, right?  Right? 
                    There's no law against waiting for 
                    someone.  You waited for her.  

                                    RANDALL
                    I just wanted to speak to her.

                                  CHO
                    Nothing wrong with that.  
                    You wanted to speak to her.  Then 
                    what happened?

      FLASHBACK


      Cho and Randall...

                                    RANDALL
                    She didn't leave, and she's 
                    laughing and smiling, so I figure 
                    I'm doing good...

      FLASHBACK

                    I got in my car and I drove off.  
                    And that was it.  Only I felt like 
                    maybe she would still be mad at me?  
                    And like, complain?

                    So when I came in this morning, 
                    before I knew she was missing, I 
                    wrote sorry and I put it in her 
                    locker.

                                  LISBON
                    How long were you with her in the 
                    parking lot?  Try and be precise.

                                    RANDALL
                    Five minutes.  Six.


      Lisbon and Cho exit the interview room and cross the open-
      plan office.

                                  LISBON
                    Sounds like the truth.

                                  CHO
                    I don't know.  He has potential.

                                  LISBON
                    Do we have anything to keep him on?

                                  CHO
                    Nope.

      They stop at a wall mounted black-board on which Lisbon has 
      sketched out a GRAPHIC TIMELINE with yellow chalk.  Jane is 
      lounging next to it.

                                  LISBON 
                    So spring him.  Forensics have his 
                    car.  We'll grab him up again if 
                    they find anything.  

      Cho heads back across the room.  Lisbon takes up a marker and 
      puts new data up on the board.

                                  LISBON (CONT'D)
                    Randall tried to kiss Melanie 
                    because he assumed it was on his 
                    account that she didn't leave.  

                                  JANE
                    But in fact, she didn't leave 
                      because...

                                  LISBON
                    She was waiting for someone else.

                    wakes up on a bed in a motel room all 
                    tied up in duct tape.  Unharmed.  The

                      abductors.  No suspects.  Fairfield 
                    PD concluded it was a drunken prank.  
                    The complainant Sanchez left town so 
                    the case kind of drifted away. 

      NB Van Pelt has a PHOTOCOPIED PHOTO of SANCHEZ among the case 
      papers she's referring to. 

                                  JANE
                    That's very interesting.

                    Any other correlations?

                                  VAN PELT
                    Uh, yes actually.  Sanchez is a 
                    redhead, like O'Keefe.

      Jane grins.

                                  LISBON
                    Cool down.  It's a common brand of 
                    tape.  And there's a quarter 
                    million redheaded women in 
                      California.  

                                  JANE
                    You're right.  But just supposing, 
                    for fun, that it was the same guy 
                    did both crimes?  What's going on?  
                    He kidnaps a redheaded girl, ties 
                    her up, takes her to a motel room. 
                    He has her at his mercy, but he 
                    does nothing.  Month later, he 
                    kidnaps another redhead but his 
                    planning isn't good enough and he 
                    kills her in a panic to keep her 
                    quiet.  What's that say? 

      Lisbon is cleaning up the graphics of her timeline.        

                                  LISBON
                    He's an idiot.

                                  JANE
                    He's new to this, and he's 
                      conflicted.  He's hungry to do 
                    terrible things, but his conscience 
                    and his fear tell him not to.  So 
                    he's not yet going into it with the 
                    proper focus and planning.  So 
                    stuff goes wrong.

                    and Melanie was killed by the 
                    secret lover we can be fairly

      Raquel obeys.  Jane fixes her with his gaze, smiles.

                    Melanie had a thing with Hector 
                    Romerez.  He's my second cousin.  I 
                    was with him at the fair one time 
                    and we run into Melanie and they 
                    were like, bam.  Romeo and Juliet.  
                    She was meeting him that night.

                    He's killed people for way less 
                    than snitching on him like this.  
                    For real. 

      Raquel's sigh of relief and contented expression are a 
      puzzlement to Lisbon.  Cho tries to wear a blank expression.


      Jane and Cho and Lisbon walking across the office...

                                  LISBON
                    That was strange.  The way she gave 
                    him up so easily like that?   

      Cho and Jane exchange a look.

                                  JANE
                    Yes it was.  But hey, you were 
                    right huh?  Secret lover.  Guess I 
                    was wrong about the whole red hair 
                    and duct tape thing.  

      Jane's manner confirms Lisbon's suspicions.

                                  LISBON 
                    You hypnotized her, didn't you?

                                  JANE
                      I certainly did not.  Okay, no.  
                    Yes.  I did hypnotize her, but--

                    --But nothing.  It's unprofessional

      He splits.  She wants to ask questions, but doesn't, and 
      follows him out. 


      Hector sits upright in his chair, a thousand yard stare.  
      Lisbon sits opposite, the Sheriff next to her.  Jane leaning 
      against the wall.

                    She was suffocated and stabbed to

                    three nights ago.  

      No response.

      FLASHBACK


      Hector's face is WET WITH TEARS.

                                  HECTOR
                    I will always hate myself for that.
                    I left her to be killed.  Because 
                    I don't wait for nobody.

                    I told her, go to LA and don't come 
                    back for nothing.

                    Now you're just trying to be 
                    contrary.  Have you read his sheet?

                                  JANE
                    Did you hear what he said?

                                  LISBON
                    He's a good actor.  It was you that 
                    said it was him in the first place. 

                                  JANE
                    I said Melanie had a secret lover.  
                    I didn't say he killed her.

                    If it wasn't him, then who was it?  
                    And if you say a man who likes red 
                    hair and silver duct tape, I will 
                    scream. 

                                  JANE
                    I don't want you to scream.

      From behind them, the Sheriff hurries down the hall.

                                    SHERIFF
                    You folks going to be talking to 
                    that boy some more?  Or can I send 
                    him back to lock-up?

                                    SHERIFF
                    Alright, then.

      The Sheriff nods respectfully to Lisbon, turns and ambles 
      back the way he came.  Lisbon looks at Jane.

                                  LISBON
                    Look, you have your reasons.  
                      I understand.  But you're seeing 
                    more than is actually there in 
                    front of you.  It's a tendency you 
                    have.  But not every murder is a 
                    secret inside a secret inside a 
                    secret.  There isn't always a 
                    hidden pattern.

                                  JANE
                    Not always.  Sometimes there is.

                                  LISBON
                    Sometimes the obvious guy did it.  
                    Most of the time, the obvious guy

                    that night.  For ten minutes, give

                    It was Hector.

                    You're right.  There's no time.  

      Jane catches sight of Frankie O'Keefe entering the Sheriff's 
      Office Reception, a funny look on his face.

                                  VAN PELT (O.S.)
                    The motels?

                    That's okay.  But listen...

                    No gun?  What were you going to use 
                    to kill Hector?  A knife?    

      Frankie produces a small axe from his backpack.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Whoa.  That might work. 

      He gestures - 'Put it away or someone'll see it.'  Frankie 
      puts away the axe.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    What if it turned out that he isn't 
                    the man that killed your sister?

                    Isn't he?

      Jane eats some ice cream.

                    We don't know yet.  But that's our 
                    job to find out.  You don't have to 
                    worry about that.  You need to be 
                    here for your family.  You can

                                    FRANKIE
                    When you find who did it for sure, 
                    will you kill him?

                    He killed them to teach me a

                    Being sorry is far worse punishment 
                    than being dead.  Everyone dies.

      Frankie hands the axe to his father, Joe.  His mother, 
      Mercedes, and Jane watch.  Joe looks at his son, looks at the 
      hatchet.  Pride, anger, and deep sadness roil inside him.

      Jane's looking around the room.  There's a magazine open on 
      the coffee table, a chip bag in the wastepaper basket.  The 
      couch is dented where someone's been sitting on it.

                    Hector what he has to say about 
                    that.  And you?  What did you find?

                    two weeks ago, she was 
                      disrespectful, so I had to tune her

      Lisbon looks at Jane as they exit the interview room, and 
      sighs.

      He hangs up.  Terrible suspicions race through Lisbon's mind.  
      He's fucking with her, obviously.  But what if he's not?  
      What if he's setting up a romantic dinner for the two of 
      them?  She is repulsed and attracted by the idea in exactly 
      equal measure.

                    with a candlelit dinner.  That 
                    would be very sophomoric.

                    Hey!

      Malcolm lumbers after Jane.  Before Jane can undo the 
      security lock, Malcolm's on him, grabs him by the collar and 
      throws him back across the room.  Suddenly there's a big 
      knife in his hand.  Sandra fumbles a gun from her shoulder 
      purse.

                                    MALCOLM
                    Why are you here?

                                  SANDRA 
                    How?

                                  JANE
                    Does it matter?  I'm here.  The 
                    place is surrounded by police and 
                    CBI agents.

                                    MALCOLM
                    Oh no.
                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE MENTALIST    "Red Hair & Silver Tape"    CHERRY 7/17/08    52.

                                  SANDRA
                    He's lying.  They'd be in here 
                    arresting us by now if they were 
                    here.

                                  JANE
                    They're waiting on SWAT.  There's 
                    no way out of this.  

      Sandra looks out the windows.

                                  SANDRA
                    Nobody.  We should just kill them 
                    and get out of here.  

                                  JANE
                    Listen to me.  You can walk away 
                    from all of this.  No disrespect, 
                    but both of you are clinically 
                    insane.  You won't go to prison.  
                    You'll spend a couple of years in a 
                    hospital, and then you can walk 
                    away.  

                                    MALCOLM 
                    Shut up!  I'm thinking!

                                  SANDRA
                    Oh, now he's thinking. 

                                    MALCOLM
                    You wanted this too.  Don't pretend 
                    you didn't.

                                  SANDRA
                    I told you we should wait!  I told 
                    you we--

      Malcolm waves the knife at Sandra.

                                    MALCOLM 
                    --I swear to God woman!  One more 
                    word...

      Boom!  The door is kicked in and there stands Lisbon with 
      large gun in hand.  

                                  LISBON 
                    Police!

      With a guttural roar, Malcolm goes at Lisbon, knife held 
      high.  Lisbon has no choice, no time.  She shoots him twice 
      in the chest.  Shrieking, Sandra tries to shoot Lisbon, but 
      she's got the safety on.  She fumbles to get it off.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE MENTALIST    "Red Hair & Silver Tape"    CHERRY 7/17/08    53.

                                  LISBON (CONT'D)
                    Drop the gun!  Drop the gun!

      Sandra gets the safety catch off and fires one wild shot. 
      Lisbon has to shoot her.  The shot echoes.  Smoke rises.      
      A muffled cry from the red headed girl.  Lisbon holsters her 
      gun and hurries to the girl's aid, untying her and taking the 
      gag from her mouth.  The girl can only whimper.  

                                  LISBON (CONT'D)
                          (holding her)
                    It's okay.  You're safe.  It's okay.

      Jane checks on Malcolm and Sandra, lying entwined on the 
      floor.  In answer to Lisbon's look, he shakes his head.  
      They're both dead.  This is the first time Lisbon has killed 
      anyone and the shock of it starts to sink in.
