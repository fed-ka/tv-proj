An abandoned home ablaze, the fire untended. Things burn in 
Detroit, close to 500 arsons a month, and most are left to 
simply die out on their own as the city attempts to shed its 
past and rebuild its future. 

CHYRON: DETROIT, MI

We move through the urban landscape, as --

pass by like falling dominoes.

Canada, over the Detroit River.

One, two, three ... they lift Brendan s dead weight, 
struggling to get him into --


The riverside. Dawn. The car starts to roll toward the water. 
Frank and Geddes watch it drift into the river. Water begins 
to pour in. Slowly, it succumbs. 

Off Frank and Geddes, as Brendan sinks away.

CUT TO:


The street. Brush Park. Midtown. 48.


ELENA
Oh, baby, it s perfect. 

And we come around to see, Elena s POV --

An enormous, decayed brick Victorian, boarded up.

The Ambassador Bridge casts its shadow on a busy crime scene. 
Across the River, in Canada, huge mounds of gravel stand 
placid. Here, police work taping off the scene as --

POLICE DIVERS break the surface. A beat and they go back --


Underwater. The divers head toward the sunken Lexus as --


A huge tow truck backs up to the water. ANGLE ON --

The line of crime scene tape. Dani and Westwood approach from 
the other side as a UNIFORM COP walks to meet them. He 
indicates a BOAT CAPTAIN in the distance, by the water. 

UNIFORM COP

this morning and hit metal... 
Divers have already been down 
twice. Tow truck s here now. They 
should have it up soon. 

Dani slides under the tape and walks toward the water. 
Westwood stays with the cop. Torrance arrives. 

TORRANCE
Is it Brendan McCann?

UNIFORM COP
I m sorry, sir. The divers don t 
know Sergeant McCann. We can t be

GEDDES

WESTWOOD

A beat. Westwood ignores him, ducks under the tape and walks 
to the river. As Torrance pulls out his phone --

(CONT D) TORRANCE
I need to call the chief. 

As Torrance walks away from Dani and Geddes. 

CUT TO:


Damon and Elena walk from the house to the Dodge Charger. 
They have a certain glow. Damon s phone rings. 

DAMON

He listens as he walks. Suddenly stops.

Geddes, Dani and Westwood at the water line, watching. 

GEDDES
The rat squad. 

WESTWOOD

day. How the rats were on him.

WESTWOOD
He did?

GEDDES

GEDDES
Last night in the restaurant. 

WESTWOOD

GEDDES
At the end of the night. 

WESTWOOD

GEDDES
Yeah.  I can t keep the rats off 
me. I d rather drown.  He said it 
right before we took him home. You 
can check with Frank Agnew if you 
want, see if he remembers. 60.


As he says this, Frank walks to them, overhearing. A twinge. 
For a second, he could murder Geddes. But he stays calm. As --

WESTWOOD
You just remembered this?

GEDDES
I didn t know what he was talking 
about. I thought he was drunk and 
imagining rats. How was I suppose 
to know he meant Internal Affairs?

As Westwood stares, Torrance approaches Frank.

They walk away.

The train tracks. Debris-strewn. They walk and talk. 

DAMON
You seen the body?

MICHAEL
Too many cops. It s a cluster. 

They continue up the tracks -- downtown Detroit coming into 
focus. Michael hands Damon a detached rifle scope. They stop.

(CONT D) MICHAEL
Maybe we oughta take a step back. 
Hold off until we know the score. 61.


DAMON
No. We stay smart but we go hard 
and we take out anything in our 
way.

He raises the scope. We see, SCOPE POV --

Frank -- in the crosshairs -- standing over the body. 

Damon lowers the scope. An incredulous look. He knows Frank. 

MICHAEL
What?

DAMON
Nothing. 

Damon raises the scope again. SCOPE POV --

Frank and Torrance inspect Brendan s body. 

Damon lowers the scope. The anger is bubbling now. 

(CONT D) DAMON
It s McCann. 

MICHAEL
So, now what?

DAMON
Did the old man know McCann was 
ours?

MICHAEL

DAMON

MICHAEL

DAMON

DAMON

MICHAEL
He s old school. They got a code. 62.


DAMON

MICHAEL

DAMON
You need to forget where we started 
and think about where we are right 
now. I m not some asshole looking 
from the other side of the window. 

MICHAEL
I m just saying. You don t rat, you 
don t kill a cop, you don t hit 
your woman. 

DAMON
Yeah? Your pop was old school. How 
many of those did he stick to?

Which cuts at Michael. A beat. Damon hands the scope back. He 
turns and walks back down the tracks, with purpose.

(CONT D) DAMON
I want everyone to the bar. Tell em 
 ready. need em I

MICHAEL
You really think the old man s 
coming at us?

DAMON

As they hurry down the tracks. 

CUT TO:


Frank and Torrance walk from the Lexus toward Dani, Geddes 
and Westwood. 

TORRANCE
I m wracking my brain but I can t 
think of a next of kin. Do you know 
anyone?

FRANK
No wife. No kids. I know for a fact 
both his parents are dead. 63.


Torrance glances to see a MOTHER on the fringes with two BOYS 
picking through trash for cans. A beat. He seems reflective. 

TORRANCE
You know Brendan, he was Detroit 
born and bred, he was a cop... 
that s two different strains of 
cockroach. I didn t figure he could 
be killed. 

A beat. Frank indicates Westwood, nearby. 

FRANK
Well, with any luck, at least this 
shit dies with him. 

When the Uniform Cop behind them SHOUTS --

UNIFORM COP
Sir. There s somebody in the 
trunk... It looks like they were 
butchered. 

Frank and Torrance stop. Geddes, Dani and Westwood rush 
toward them. Westwood continues toward the car. Dani sees 
him, says to Frank --

DANI
It s sure as hell a legit 
investigation now. 

Frank stays quiet. Dani walks away. As Frank says to Geddes, 
quietly --

FRANK
I don t know if I can look at this. 

Dani notices but keeps moving. Frank stays rooted to the 
spot. As if the weight of everything has finally crushed him. 

Geddes joins the others as they reach --

The Lexus. Geddes leans into the trunk to examine the 
mutilated remains. He says, loud enough for Frank to hear --

GEDDES
Unidentified male. 

Which snaps Frank out of his trance. He shares a look with 
Geddes. What the fuck else is going on here? As Geddes says --

(CONT D) GEDDES
Head, hands and feet have all been 
removed. 64.


TORRANCE
Christ. 

Torrance steps toward Frank. A private conversation. 

(CONT D) TORRANCE
This is a complete shitstorm. 

FRANK
Yeah. 

Torrance looks around. Westwood is walking away from the 
trunk. The others begin to scatter as well. 

TORRANCE
Every goddamn blueflame in the 
department is gonna try and make 
their name burying me. Goddamn dead 
dirty cop and a chopped up goddamn 
body. Christ. 

A beat. Frank waits him out. 

(CONT D) TORRANCE
Screw the blue code of silence. If 
Joe Geddes is doing Brendan s dirty 
work, I need to know.

Frank nods. Torrance takes another look around the crazy 
scene. Then --

(CONT D) TORRANCE
This is yours. I m not gonna trust 
it with anyone else. 

Frank nods. Torrance walks away. Stay with --

Frank, as he walks to the trunk. The others have dispersed.

The butchered remains. Male. Not Sinada. 

Dani approaches. 

DANI

if you could look at this?

FRANK

know if I can look at this. 65.

MUSIC UP:  WHAT WE HAD  (HANDSOME FURS)

The song churns. Dark. Plaintive. Driving. 

As Frank moves off, alone, HIS POV -- 

-- Geddes smokes a cigarette, staring at the water where 
Brendan was dumped. He turns. The two meet eyes. A beat. 
Frank looks toward --

-- Westwood, on the move, cell phone at his ear. Then to --

-- Torrance, moving in the opposite direction, his phone also 
pressed against his ear. 

As Frank processes it all --

Frank, alone at the center of the storm. Off him.
