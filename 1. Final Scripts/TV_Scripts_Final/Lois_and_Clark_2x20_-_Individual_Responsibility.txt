To pop everything into place...    

use Courier 10 (or 10 characters per inch)

set top margin at 0.4", bottom margin at 0.4" (or minimums)
left margin at 1", right margin at .25 (or minimum)
   (I had to tell the program I was using legal paper)

page breaks in hard copy indicated by ---page break---

sometimes the formatting changes slightly (as in the numbers at the
end of the lines), but I'm going to keep consistent because it's
easier

logo on front page will be noted when used but not included here

as this may be sent in .txt, originally underlined words will 
look like   _this_

I don't know what the (X) or the * (this on Locations and
Chronology pages) designate.

Notes: 

Cover:  "Individual Responsibility", Written by Chris Ruppenthal &
Grant Rosenberg [and] Directed by Alan J. Levi are all in large bolt
print. WARNER BROTHERS TELEVISION is in an Ariel-type font. The
remainder of the text is in Courier 10 (10 characters per inch)

Note: page 55.-55A - the "-55A" is typed in a different font; I
wonder if it's for the changes T. Hatcher reportedly asked for in
that scene?

Typos noted:
"alright" misspelled 3 times; should be "all right"
Page 9.: Clark, just past mid page: "seem be dart away"
        is in original; "be" should be "to"

      Wisps of fog dot the ground.  Ten silent and determined men  (X)
      search the earth, the beams of their flashlights strange 
      glowing pillars that seem to spring from nothingness.  Half 
      the men guide hi-tech metal detectors over the dirt; they're 
      led by GENE NEWTRICH, 50.  He has the look of a man who's 
      spent his life outdoors.  Suddenly, Gene's detector gives a 
      BEEP.  He makes a hand signal and all the others congregate 
      around.  He's handed a shovel and begins to dig Hard.
      Fast.  Precise.  There's a CLUNK as the shovel strikes
      something.  Gene drops to his knees.  His gloved hands probe
      the soil, grasp the object and pull it up.  A GLOWING RED
      ROCK, the size of an orange, illuminates his face.  Gene
      looks at the rock in wonder.

                One of these days I'm going to get
                you, Perry.  Then we'll see who's
                smiling.

      There's a knock on the door.

                Come.

      Gene Newtrich enters, carrying a small box.  He's dressed in
      clean khakis and a flannel shirt which contrasts with Bill,  (X)
      Jr's elegant suit. Bill, Jr. spots the box.

                                 GENE
                Um, as you know, Mr. Church, over  a
                year ago your father commissioned
                my team to try and find some
                Kryptonite.  Using the data we've
                recovered from Bureau 39, we knew
                approximately where Superman's
                spaceship crashed.   Last night, we
                found this...

      Gene opens the box. Bill, Jr. looks in fascination at the
      glowing red rock.

                                 GENE (CONT'D)
                ... twelve-point-seven kilometers
                from the ship's estimated point of
                impact.  As far as I can tell from
                my experiments, what you're looking
                at is... Kryptonite.

                                 BILL, JR.
                Kryptonite?  I thought it was
                green.  This is red.  Is there a
                difference?  What can it do?  Can                  (X)
                it kill Superman?

                                 GENE
                I don't know.  All I _do_ know is:
                its atomic weight and structure are
                slightly different from green
                kryptonite, but its radiation is in
                the same part of the spectrum.

                So, what we need is a field test.
                Of course, that means we have to

                raincheck on those checks, boys.

                Really? What if we don't want to?

      With one hand low to his side, he makes a signal.  Inside
      the back of the Suburban, behind Superman, ANOTHER HOODED
      THUG, opens a box, exposing the red Kryptonite.

      suddenly blinks.  His face changes from firm justice to
      almost casual.

      They all jump into the Suburban and speed off.  Lois runs up 
      to Superman.

                                 LOIS
                Superman, you let them get away!

                                 SUPERMAN
                No big deal, Lois.  Most criminals 
                are repeat offenders.  I'll 
                probably catch then again later.

      The elevator doors open and Lois and Clark emerge.  Lois is
      practically buzzing.

                                 LOIS
                Clark, I mean, I keep thinking I'm 
                going to wake up and see Patrick 
                Duffy in the shower and this will 
                all have been a dream.  He just let 
                them drive right off!

      Clark is still a bit apathetic due to the lingering effects 
      of red Kryptonite.  He's NOT lethargic, he just doesn't care 
      about the robbery.

                                 CLARK
                Lois, you know there is such a
                thing as individual responsibility.

                                 LOIS
                What's that mean?

                                 CLARK
                The payroll company is responsible
                for the safety of the checks, not
                Superman.  Let them take care of                   (X)
                it.

                                 LOIS
                What about the responsibility of 
                the individual to the society as a 
                whole?  The social contract that 
                obligates one person to help others 
                for the betterment of everyone?

                                 CLARK
                If that's what you feel like, 
                great.  Otherwise, I say, kick 
                back.  Enjoy.  Do your own thing.

      They arrive at Lois' desk.  Clark snags a donut and a bear 
      claw from a passing INTERN carrying a box of donuts, etc.

                                 LOIS
                Are you serious?

                                 CLARK
                As a bear claw.  Or would you

      Clark's grin exasperates Lois.  As she flops in her seat 
      with a disgusted sigh, we...

      Bill, Jr. is on the phone.  Gene loads a video tape of the   (X)
      paycheck robbery.  The POINT OF VIEW indicates it was taken  (X)
      from a second floor window across the street.                (X)

                What?  Yes, I _haven't_ forgotten                  (X)
                about Operation Nirvana.  Okay.                    (X)

      Bill, Jr. turns a long suffering eye to Gene, who's
      pointing at the playback of the tape on the screen.

                                 GENE
                This is where Superman comes in!  I
                talk to him, and then --

      Gene suddenly freezes the picture.

                                 GENE (CONT'D)
                There!  That's when we opened the
                box.  When he got within about ten 
                feet, his mood changed.  Suddenly, 
                it was like he didn't care.

      Bill, Jr. stares at the screen in amazement for a moment, 
      then bursts out laughing.

                                 BILL, JR.
                This is better than killing him!
                He just doesn't care!
                       (chuckles)
                That was the problem with green 
                Kryptonite; it always ticked him 
                off.  But this, this is perfect;
                       (thinking aloud)                            (X)
                For Operation Nirvana to succeed,                  (X)
                it's essential we control the                      (X)
                media, and _that_ means The Daily                  (X)

      CLOSEUP on Clark at his desk; he leans back in his chair,
      lost in thought, a slight frown wrinkling his face.  He is

                Jealousy is so unbecoming, don't

                Lois, I know I sometimes seem be 
                dart away just when things start to 
                get serious, but now I feel like 
                you're the one who's backing off.

      Lois doesn't know what to say, so she avoids answering by 
      plucking the note that's nestled amidst the flowers.

                                 LOIS
                Oh, look, a note.

                I'd be phoning my attorney if I
                were you!

      There's no response.  Perry sags in defeat.  Gingerly he 
      removes his blindfold.  Suddenly, we HEAR a pair of hands 
      slowly clapping.  Perry spins and CAMERA MOVES TO INCLUDE 
      Bill Church, Jr. rising from a chair.  He takes a cigar from 
      his mouth.

                                 BILL, JR.
                Bravissimo.  I'd expect nothing 
                less from the crusading Perry 
                White.

                                 BILL, JR.
                Of course.  Not only did I take 
                over Dad's legit businesses, but I 
                took over Intergang, too.  Kind of 
                a two for one deal.

                Unfortunately, you made Mr. Stern

                make you an offer.  I want you to 
                be part of the Intergang family.  
                You and Alice will be taken care of 
                for life.  We've got a great

      Bill, Jr. smiles, steps out and the door closes and locks. 
      Perry suddenly turns and runs to the window.  He pulls back
      the drapes... and stops in surprise.  There's nothing but a

      Superman SUPERDRAWS on a legal pad on Perry's desk.  In an 
      instant he has a very good likeness of Gene.  He hands it to 
      Lois.

                You know, I talked to your mom
                today.

                My mom?

                                 BILL, JR.
                I love the rest home.  Very 
                tasteful.  She's in great shape for 
                a woman her age.  She cheats at 
                bridge, but she's in great shape.  
                She sends her love.

                                 PERRY
                My mother would twist your head off
                if she knew what you'd done.

      Bill, Jr. casually repockets his cigar cutter.

                                 BILL, JR.
                No doubt.  Oh, and Alice says,
                hello, too.  Though don't you think
                she deserves a new car?  You know,
                after a few years, things always
                start to go wrong.  Like brakes.

      Perry's face changes.  He crosses to Bill, Jr. and puts his  (X)
      hands on his shoulders.                                      (X)

                                 PERRY
                Billy, let's put our differences                   (X)
                aside for a moment.  You and me...                 (X)
                we go way back.  Listen to what                    (X)
                you're saying.  This is... this is                 (X)
                _Alice_ you're talking about.                      (X)

      Perry's voice almost breaks with emotion.  Bill, Jr.         (X)
      thrusts the clinging Perry away.

                                 BILL, JR.
                Get a grip on yourself, Perry,
                you'll stain my suit!

                                 BILL, JR.

      Bill, Jr. smiles and backs out of the room.  The door shuts

                Lois, why didn't you tell Mr. Stern 
                Perry's been kidnapped?

                                 LOIS
                Because that's just the thing

                Perry's not here, Karl.

                                 KARL
                Oh. I need an answer now!  The
                Sunday mag closes in five!

                                 LOIS

                That means I need more copy!  Oh,

      Then before Lois can reply, Karl runs out of the room, a man
      in hell.  Clark checks his watch, then starts to head for    (X)

                                 CLARK
                I, um, have an appointment.  With                  (X)

      Then he's out the door.

                                 LOIS
                Don't be long!
                       (beat; to Jimmy)
                Maybe I should've only gone with
                Bali.

                                 SUPERMAN
                Stop?

                                 DR. FRISKIN
                My next appointment is here.  But 
                we could continue this tomorrow.

                       (standing; awkward)
                Um, sure. If I'm not saving the
                world or something.

                                 DR. FRISKIN
                Fine. I look forward to it.


  25  INT. WAITING ROOM - CONTINUOUS                             25   

      Superman exits Dr. Friskin's.  A couple of people in the
      waiting room look up.  Gene, disguised as a janitor, empties
      the waste basket and gestures towards Dr. Friskin's office.

                                 DR. FRISKIN
                Go right ahead.

      Gene nods and slides past her into...


  26   INT. FRISKIN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS                        26   

      Gene empties the wastebasket into his cart and then quickly
      pulls some Red Kryptonite out of a box hidden in his cart.
      He embeds it in a wad of sticky putty and sticks it to the
      underside of the couch.


  27  INT. WAITING ROOM - CONTINUOUS                             27   

      Gene exits Friskin's office.

                                 GENE
                All done.

                                 DR. FRISKIN
                Thank you.

      And as Gene smiles, we...

  29  INT. SUITE - NIGHT - SAME TIME                             29   

      Perry is pacing the suite, holding the cigar cutter in his 
      hand.  He suddenly gets an idea and walks over to a lamp 
      that is sitting on a table by the door.  He flips the light 
      switch on the wall and the lamp turns on.  Perry smiles and 
      turns the lamp off again.  He bends over and unplugs the
      lamp from the wall socket. He uses the cigar cutter to       (X)
      begin stripping the insulation off the wires near the plug.  (X)
      He hears FOOTSTEPS in the hallway and stuffs the wires
      behind the sofa, then sits down.  A moment later, Church     (X)
      enters.

                                 PERRY
                You run a first class prison here,
                Billy.

      Bill Jr. pulls a cigar out of his pocket and unwraps.

                                 BILL, JR:
                Don't think of it as a prison.  I'd 
                like you to think of it as your 
                future corporate headquarters.

                                 PERRY
                I'll never join up with Intergang.

      Bill Jr. holds the cigar in one hand and pats his pockets, 
      looking for his cigar cutter.  He smiles at Perry.

                                 BILL, JR.
                Perhaps you don't fully grasp the 
                situation.  If you work for me, you 
                get rich beyond your wildest 
                dreams.  If, on the other hand, you 
                continue to cling to your misguided 
                morality, you die.  At Harvard 
                Business School, we'd call that 
                a no-brainer.

      Bill Jr. finally gives up and slides the uncut cigar back 
      into his pocket.  Just then, Gene enters the room.  He 
      motions he wants to speak in private.

                                 BILL, JR. (CONT'D)
                Anything you have to say you can say 
                in front of Perry.  He's either 
                going to be part of our team, or 
                he'll soon be playing for the 
                angels.

                I put the Red Kryptonite in Doctor

                _Red_ Kryptonite?  What's he
                Talking about?

                                 BILL, JR.
                We discovered it by accident, but
                we're very pleased with its affect
                on Superman.  Evidently, it makes
                him rather apathetic about his
                work.

                                 PERRY
                You mean that's why he didn't try
                to save me the other day?

                                 GENE
                       (nods)
                Except he thinks he's having some
                kind of nervous breakdown.

                                 BILL, JR.
                It's perfect.  Superman is going to
                a shrink to get well, but all he'll
                get is more exposure to the Red
                Kryptonite.  My scientists tell me
                that eventually his condition could
                become permanent.

                                 PERRY
                Permanent?

                By the way, send a nice little gift
                to Friskin's receptionist for
                tipping us off.  Something along
                the lines of... a Mercedes.

                No, Mr. Stern.  I haven't seen

                car trouble.

                I realize you need to give

                Of course.  I'll tell him to call

                When Stern sells we'll all be out

                He might be Superman to you, but
                first and foremost, he's a

  45  INT. GENE'S OFFICE                                         45   

      It's a single room, organized with an engineer's efficiency.
      File cabinets line the walls and a large drafting table 
      dominates the center of the office.  Lois and Clark start 
      opening drawers, digging around.

                                 CLARK
                What exactly are we looking for?

                                 LOIS
                I have no idea, but hopefully we'll
                know when we find it.

      As Lois rifles through the drawers to one filing cabinet, 
      Clark tips his glasses and uses his X-RAY vision to speed 
      scan another entire cabinet.  He doesn't see anything of 
      interest.

                                 CLARK
                Lois, I've been thinking about
                Saturday night and...

                                 LOIS
                       (cutting him off)
                Let's try to stay focused on the
                problem at hand.

                                 CLARK
                       (chastised)
                Okay, but I still don't see why a 
                soil engineer would be involved in 
                a plot to kidnap Perry?

                                 LOIS
                That's the $64,000 question.

      Lois finds a stack of rolled up blueprints and starts 
      spreading them out on the drafting table.

      In the meantime, Clark leans over and grabs a drawer handle.
      As he begins sliding it open...

                Newtrich has to be tied into some
                larger organization.

      As Lois speaks, Clark looks up and doesn't see the contents
      of the drawer.

                       (looking at Lois)
                You're probably right, but then
                again, why should we care?

      Clark slams the drawer shut without looking inside it as
      Lois reacts.

                                 LOIS
                Uh oh.  Is Mr. Hyde back again?

                                 CLARK
                We're wasting time here.

                If we hurry we can still catch a
                nine o'clock show at the
                multiplex.

      Lois shakes her head, then suddenly her face lights up.

                                 LOIS
                These are the plans for the
                substructure of Costmart.

                                 CLARK

                Newtrich has worked for Costmart,
                and Costmart is run by Bill Church,
                Jr., which means Newtritch could be
                part of Intergang.

      Just then, they hear the rumbling of a janitor's cart        (X)
      coming down the hallway.  Lois folds up the blueprints and
      stuffs them under her jacket.

                What are we going to do?

      They hear the sound of the key pad activated and the door    (X)
      handle begins to turn.  Lois grabs Clark and pulls him into
      a dark corner behind the door.

      The office door opens and a JANITOR enters.  He is wearing a
      set of headphones and the sound of muffled rock music leaks
      into the office.  As he moves to the garbage can, Lois and
      Clark slip out from behind the door and into the hallway.

                That rock seems to have a calming
                influence on you.

      Superman looks at the Kryptonite in his hand then suddenly 
      throws it at the window.  It CRASHES through the window and 
      flies out into the sky.

                                 SUPERMAN
                Sorry about the window.

                                 DR. FRISKIN
                Would you like to talk about what
                just happened?

                                 SUPERMAN
                Well, it's not exactly easy to                     (X)
                explain, but when the planet                       (X)
                Krypton blew up, meteors from the 
                planet crashed into Earth.  Green 
                Kryptonite can kill me, but I've 
                never seen this red variety before.

                                 DR. FRISKIN
                If green Kryptonite affects you 
                physically, it's possible red 
                Kryptonite could be affecting 
                you mentally.  If I had to guess, 
                I'd say that it unleashed the deep 
                feelings you've been harboring.

                                 SUPERMAN
                Does that mean I really am tired
                of being Superman?

                                 DR. FRISKIN
                It just means you're finally 
                feeling the frustration of trying 
                to be perfect for all these years.
                Even a super hero has the right to 
                be resentful once in a while.  
                After all, you're only human.

                                 SUPERMAN
                Well, almost.  But what if I run 
                into Red Kryptonite again?  I 
                mean, whoever put this here might 
                have more.

                                 DR. FRISKIN
                To be honest.  I don't know.  This 
                'Red Kryptonite' seems to let you 
                feel emotions you normally aren't 
                aware of.

                                 SUPERMAN
                       (speculating)
                But now that I am aware of them, 
                it's up to me to deal with how 
                I react to them.

                                 DR. FRISKIN
                Exactly.  Now that you're aware of 
                how it can make you feel, maybe 
                you can do something about it.  
                But it could be a struggle.

                                 SUPERMAN
                That's all part of being superman.

                Of _any_ man.

                                 SUPERMAN
                Thanks for all the help, Dr.

                paid for everything.

      Perry has moved a halogen floor lamp from one corner of the
      room to a point near the wall opposite the front door. He
      is doing something mysterious to the bulb; but _we can't_
      see what it is exactly.  Suddenly, he hears FOOTSTEPS
      outside the door.  He quickly plugs in the halogen and then
      turns, trying to look nonchalant.

      A GUARD dressed in conservative grey suit enters, carrying a
      covered tray.

      Perry casually moves his hand up to the light switch on the
      wall.  The guard pulls the cover off the tray and begins     (X)
      setting out the food.

                                 GUARD (CONT'D)
                Caviar, smoked salmon, and a petite

                Mr. Church has his own chef.

      Perry leans against the wall, his elbow near the switch.     (X)
      The guard turns and smiles at Perry.

                                 GUARD (CONT'D)
                Bon appetite.

      As the guard heads away, Perry hits the switch, plunging the
      room into _total_ _darkness_.

                                 GUARD (CONT'D)

      reaches for his gun.  The FLASH is from Perry's doctored     (X)
      halogen lamp.  The brief flash also shows Perry pointing     (X)
      the halogen at the guard like a giant flashlight.  After     (X)
      the strobe, all returns to BLACK and we HEAR thuds and       (X)
      grunts as Perry knocks the guard out. (Maybe even a BONK!    (X)
      from hitting the guard with the metal tray cover.)  A        (X)
      second later, Perry turns on all the other lamps.            (X)

      Lois grabs the paperclip.  She quickly unbends it and uses
      it to start fiddling with the control panel.  As she does,
      Clark tips down his glasses and X-RAYS the wall above the    (X)
      panel.  He follows the wiring from the panel up and over to  (X)
      one side and then lets loose with a BLAST of PINPOINT HEAT   (X)
      VISION, shorting the electronic alarm system.  In a moment,  (X)
      the elevator doors open and Lois turns around with a
      triumphant smile.

                There.  The computers are wiped

      Gene stands nearby, with a square, lead box under his arm.

      A moment later, Church appears with Gene by his side.

                Miss Lane, your timing couldn't

                       (to Gene)
                Is there room for two in that

                                 SUPERMAN (O.S.)
                I think we'll skip the tour of the
                landfill, Church.

                This little situation is really no
                concern of yours.

      Church motions to Gene, who opens the box and exposes the    (X)
      shining red Kryptonite.  Church smiles as Superman takes a
      slight step backwards.

                                 PERRY
                Fight it, Superman. Don't give in.

      Superman walks over to Gene and grabs the Kryptonite out of  (X)
      the box.  He casually tosses it up and down while Billy and  (X)
      his boys realize they are in deep trouble.  Suddenly,        (X)
      Superman throws the Kryptonite down the corridor, where it   (X)
      SMASHES through the wall at the end of the hall, and buries  (X)
      itself deep in the earth beyond.                             (X)

      Perry takes advantage of the distraction by elbowing the
      guard in the chest and follows up by punching him in the
      face, sending the guard sprawling.

      Gene turns to run, but Lois grabs him by the arm and spins
      him around.  She uses her martial arts to take Gene out,
      finishing him off with a high kick to the side of his head.

      Church suddenly grabs Lois around the throat and places a

                                 BILL, JR.
                Don't move, Superman.  This gun has
                a very delicate trigger mechanism.
                I wouldn't want it to accidentally
                go off. Just stay right there.                     (X)

      he is standing behind Church.

                                 SUPERMAN
                How about here?

      Before Church can react, Superman yanks the gun from his
      hand and crushes it into a metallic ball.  He grabs Church
      by the neck and lifts him off the ground.

                                 SUPERMAN (CONT'D)

                disappear.

      Lois equivocates for a moment, then relents.

                                 LOIS
                Alright. You can pick me up at
                seven; and I promise I won't
                disappear on you either.  But you                  (X)
                better be there at seven                           (X)
                       (increasing sexiness)                       (X)
                And seven-oh-one.  Seven-oh-two.                   (X)
                Seven-oh-three.  And                               (X)
                seven-oh-four.  And seven-oh...                    (X)

      And as Lois continues to talk and the heat between them      (X)
      continues to build, we...

                                                      FADE OUT.

                              _THE END_
