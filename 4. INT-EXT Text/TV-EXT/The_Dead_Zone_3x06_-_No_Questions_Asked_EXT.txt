          Walt, having changed out of his uniform, hurriedly pulling
          on a blazer as he exits the building and climbs into his
          personal car as we reveal --


          JOHNNY

          hunkered down in the driver's seat of a RENTAL CAR parked
          several spaces away.  Johnny registers Walt's change in
            wardrobe.  Not exactly court appropriate attire.



          Walt's car is sailing along in the right lane.  Passes --


          A SIGN

          which reads: Newport - 10 miles.  A moment later, we see
          Johnny cruising right behind him.



          We're in a poorer area -- a poorer town -- than the one
          we just left.  Small houses all very close to each other. 
          Postage stamp yards.  A neighborhood on the edge.  Walt's
          car is parked at the curb. 



          Johnny pulls up to a large plot of neglected land.  A
          RUNDOWN HOUSE sits at one edge of the property, and in
          the back is a freestanding GARAGE which has been converted
          into an apartment. 



          At the door, Walt removes a CREDIT CARD from his wallet
          and slips the lock.  Then he enters, closing the door
          behind him.   

          A moment later, Johnny creeps up to the garage door.  We
          hear NOISE coming from inside.  Sounds like Walt is tossing
          the place.  Then the noise abruptly STOPS.  Johnny moves
          past the front door and along the side of the building
          toward --


          A SMALL WINDOW

          He pauses, his back pressed against the wall.  Then he
          cautiously leans forward and takes a look inside.


    1919JOHNNY'S POV

          The interior is a cluttered mess.  Old furniture, a couple
          of tattered Vargas posters, a television with an antenna. 
          Johnny strains to see further inside without revealing
          himself, but Walt is not there.

          Suddenly --





                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: NO QUESTIONS ASKED - ACT ONE - 12/9/03 YELLOW  12.

          A HAND

          comes down onto Johnny's shoulder, triggering --



          Walt, in a suit and tie, is being hustled downstairs by
          his LAWYER.  A CRUSH OF REPORTERS shove microphones toward
          him.

                                        REPORTER #1
                        Will you step down as Sheriff? 

                                        WALT
                        I have no intention of stepping
                        down. 

                                        REPORTER #2
                        What if the jury finds you guilty?

          Walt moves forward, stoic, but clearly devastated by what's
            happening to him.


  2121BACK TO SCENE

          Johnny turns.  Walt is standing behind him, and he does
          not look happy.

                                        WALT
                        What the hell do you think you're
                        doing?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I could ask you the same question. 

                                        WALT
                        The situation is under control.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The hell it is.

          Walt turns and heads toward the main house.  Johnny
          follows.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm getting visions of you on
                        trial.  Losing your job.  Now
                        what's going on?

          Walt stops.  Absorbs what Johnny is telling him.  This is
          exactly what he was afraid of, but he's still unwilling
          to ask for help.

                        you the right to spy on me?

                        Sarah came to see me this morning.
                                (Walt throws him a
                                look)
                        She's worried about you.  So am
                        I.

                                        WALT
                        Do me a favor, Johnny, and for
                        once stay out of our lives.  I
                        can handle my own problems, you
                        know.  Did it for a lot of years
                        before you showed up.

          Walt starts to walk away but Johnny grabs his arm.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Listen, I know we've been through
                        a lot together.  Maybe too much. 
                                (then)
                        But don't be stupid.  Let me help
                        you. 

          Walt exhales.  Glances away.  Knows Johnny's right.

                                        WALT
                        That vision you had.  The fight
                        on the baseball field?  That was
                        from last night.

                        I'm trying to avoid that particular
                          humiliation.  Sheriff loses his
                        gun?  That's a page one story.

                        So you figured if you could just

                          yesterday morning.  I've got no

                        I know that.

          Walt takes a moment.  Chooses his words carefully.

                          There've been times, Johnny, when
                        you asked me to ignore the law,
                        ignore my own instincts, and just
                        trust you.  I guess I'm asking
                        for a little of that trust back.

          FADE IN:


          Walt and Johnny stand at the front door.  Walt KNOCKS and
          a moment later the door is opened by LINDA CANTRELL, 60. 
          Linda is a former beauty who's been beaten down by life. 
          She's fairly certain things weren't supposed to end up
          like this, and she spends a goodly amount of her time
          looking for someone to blame.  Today, it's going to be
          Walt.

                        he'd want to spend a little quality
                        time with his mother, wouldn't
                        you?

          The men don't answer, until she pointedly makes it clear
          to Johnny that the question wasn't rhetorical.

          For this poor town, the field is rather spiffy.  A new
          SCOREBOARD hangs behind the outfield, and the bleachers
          are a shiny chrome.  Johnny and Walt walk along the grass.

                        Not a bad place to play ball.

                                        WALT
                        Believe me, it didn't look like
                        this when we were kids.  I heard
                        the City Council voted to fix it
                        up a couple years ago, but when I
                        was playing?  We had to bring our
                        own cement bags or we didn't have
                        any bases.

          Walt stops at the old DUGOUT and climbs inside.  Johnny
          follows.



          Johnny wanders the first row of seats, but is getting
          nothing.  Walt watches him from an upper row.  Johnny
          jumps back down to the field.  Looks down and sees --


          A BROKEN BEER BOTTLE

          in the dirt.  He reaches down and touches one of the
          shards, triggering --


3333A VISION - BASEBALL FIELD - NIGHT

          As the bottle reforms itself and flies back into Frankie's
          hand.  Johnny turns to look behind him as day oozes into
          night.  Walt and Frankie are facing off.  It's the same
          vision as in the teaser, but it's longer and more coherent.

                                        WALT
                        I don't know anything about your
                        damn money!  I never even saw it.

          Johnny reacts -- what money? 

                                        FRANKIE
                        Don't lie to me!  We had a deal! 
                        I did my ten years, you got what
                        you wanted, now I want what's
                        mine.

                                        WALT
                        I don't have it!

                                        FRANKIE
                        Maybe I'll ask Alison, huh?  Maybe
                        we'll have a little talk. 

          Walt shoves Frankie back, pinning him against the chain
          link fence.  Johnny takes a step toward them.  This is a
          side of Walt he hasn't seen before.

                                        WALT
                        Leave Alison alone!  She's got
                        nothing to do with this!

                                        FRANKIE
                        You think I don't know what's
                        going on?

          Frankie pushes Walt off and throws the bottle onto the
          ground, smashing it. 

                                        FRANKIE
                          Sonofabitch!

    33CONTINUED:33

          Frankie lunges for Walt, and they struggle.  Bam!  Frankie
          throws an uppercut into Walt's ribcage and Walt hits his
          knees.  Frankie jumps to his feet and drops a forearm
          onto the back of Walt's neck.  He pitches forward.

    33CONTINUED: (2)33

          Frankie comes up with Walt's gun and aims it at Walt's
          head, but can't bring himself to pull the trigger. 

                                        FRANKIE
                        Sorry Walt, but I need my money.  
                        When I get it, you can have this
                        back. 

          And he hightails it out of there.  


  3434BACK TO SCENE

          Johnny comes out of the vision.  Walt is watching him. 
          Already knows the visions are more revealing than he'd
          like.  Asks the question for which he doesn't really want
          an answer:

                                        WALT
                        What did you see?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Saw Frankie get the gun.

          Walt looks away.

                                        WALT
                        What else?

                                        JOHNNY
                        The fight.  It was about money. 

                                        WALT
                        Doesn't matter what it was about. 
                        Did you see where he went?

                                        JOHNNY
                        No.

                                        WALT
                        Guess it's too much to hope you'd
                        get a vision of Frankie hanging
                        out at the Newport Diner, showing
                        my gun off to some pretty waitress,
                        just waiting for me to grab him
                        up.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's never that simple.
                                (then)
                        Walt, if Alison Roberts has
                          something to do with this --




                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: NO QUESTIONS ASKED - ACT TWO - 12/9/03 YELLOW  25.


    34CONTINUED:34

                                        WALT
                        She doesn't.  She's got absolutely
                        nothing to do with it.

          Johnny and Walt lock eyes.  Walt isn't budging on this
          one.  Alison is as much off limits for Johnny as she was
          for Frankie the night before.  The stand off is broken
          only when Walt's cell phone rings, and he answers it.

                                        WALT
                        Bannerman.  Okay.  I'm on my way. 
                                (hangs up; to Johnny)
                        Shots fired at a bar about an
                        hour ago, just a couple blocks
                        north of here.  Description sounds
                        like Frankie.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Think it's him?

                                        WALT
                        I hope not.

          They head off.



          Johnny and Walt exit and head for Walt's car.  They're in
            mid-conversation, and Johnny is finally giving in to the
          frustration of not being able to ask questions about his
          visions.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Walt, you can't keep stonewalling
                        me like this. 

          Walt gives Johnny a look -- let's discuss this in the car. 
          They both climb in and Walt pulls out into the street.



          Johnny watches Walt drive away.  He weighs his options. 
          After a moment he gets into his car. 



          Johnny pulls his rental car in front of Linda Cantrell's
          house.


          THE GARAGE APARTMENT

          stands empty and, thanks to Walt's B&E earlier, unlocked.



          The door opens and Alison sees Johnny. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Mrs. Roberts, I'm Johnny Smith. *
                        I'm here looking for Walt.*

                                        ALISON
                                  (reluctant)*
                        He's on his way over...*

                                        JOHNNY
                        Do you mind if I come in and wait?

          She hesitates, then nods --*



          Johnny and Walt walk across the lot toward the office. 
          Lots of cars, but no people to be seen.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Frankie's old supplier is a used
                        car dealer?

                                        WALT
                        About five years ago he went
                          straight.  But not too straight.

          Johnny looks over, sees a NEON SIGN that reads "USED CARS."



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: NO QUESTIONS ASKED - ACT FOUR- 12/10/03 GREEN  48-48A.


    55CONTINUED:55

          The "S" covers a small window.  Johnny grabs Walt's arm.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Walt, this is the place from my
                        vision.  I saw you shoot Frankie
                        inside.

          They push open the door, and we hear YELLING from inside. 
          Walt draws his weapon --

                                        WALT
                        Stay back.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Just be careful.

                                        WALT
                        Always.

          -- and they both head inside.



          The three men walk the field, tossing a baseball back and
          forth between them.

                                        FRANKIE
                        It is a pretty nice field.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Enjoy it, Frankie, you paid for
                        it.

                                        WALT
                        Now a whole new generation of
                        kids gets to use it.

                                        FRANKIE
                        I never thought of myself as a
                          philanthropist before.  Maybe we
                        could put up a plaque or something.

          Walt throws the ball at him, hard.

                                        WALT
                        Forget it.  You're staying an
                          anonymous donor.

                                        JOHNNY
                        So what's your plan?

                        looking tomorrow.
                                (then)
                        But, it would really help if the

                        give me a recommendation...

                        I'll see what I can do.

          Walt tosses the ball to Johnny, triggering --


  59A59AA VISION - BASEBALL FIELD - DAY

          As Walt and Frankie continue walking down the field, Johnny
          turns and sees the younger versions of Walt, Frankie and
          Jeremy, rough-housing, heading in the opposite direction. 
          Johnny just smiles as we PULL AWAY.



          It's early morning.  Walt is standing at the front door,
          holding a Venti Starbucks in each fist as Sarah opens the
          door.  Reacts.

                                        WALT
                        Thought you might like some coffee.

          She takes one.  Smiles.
