The SUV is bathed in the glow of high-tech monitoring
equipment and laptops, some looking like they're held
together with duct tape. Jane opens a well-worn NOTEBOOK of
handwritten notes and calculations. Selvig watches the
frustrated Jane with sympathy.
JANE
The anomalies are always
precipitated by geomagnetic storms.
She shows him a complicated CHART she's drawn in the book,
tracking occurrences and patterns.
JANE (CONT'D)
The last seventeen occurrences have
been predictable to the minute... I
just don't understand.
Something catches Darcy's eye out the driver's side mirror.
She adjusts it. In the distance, ODD GLOWING CLOUDS form in
the skies over the Northeastern end of the desert.
DARCY
Jane?
Jane SHUSHES her, leafs through her notes. The bottle of
champagne begins to vibrate.
JANE
There's got to be some new
variable... Or an equipment
malfunction...
The lights and equipment in the SUV begin to FLICKER around
them. The computer monitors SQUELCH with static.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 2A.
DARCY
I don't think there's anything
wrong with your equipment...
The champagne bottle starts to RATTLE noisily now as it
shakes more violently. Jane and Selvig notice.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 3.
They watch it curiously, pressure building up inside it, when
the cork EXPLODES out of it. Champagne goes spewing
everywhere -- over equipment, over Jane.
DARCY (CONT'D)
Jane?
JANE
What?!
DARCY
I think you want to see this.
Darcy points out the window. Jane and Selvig look out. Over
the desert --
MASSIVE CLOUDS OF RAINBOW LIGHT
Churn in the sky. The three stare, dumbfounded.
JANE
Holy. Shatner.
SELVIG
That's your "subtle" aurora?!
JANE
No-- yes! Let's go!
Jane grins, thrilled, pumped with adrenaline.
JANE
Isn't this great?!
A thought strikes her.
JANE (CONT'D)
You're seeing it too, right? I'm
not crazy?
SELVIG
That's debateable. Put your seat
belt on!
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 3A.
The SUV lurches.
Selvig looks up through the still-open sunroof at the
enormous glowing funnel cloud with wonder. Jane clambers
into the front seat, beside Darcy. She leans way out the
window, TAPING the storm.
JANE
You've gotta get us closer so I can
take a magnetic reading.
Darcy laughs.
DARCY
Yeah, right! Good one!
(then, realizing)
Oh God, you're serious...
JANE
You want those college credits or
not?
The SUV rocks from the blast. Darcy's had enough. She turns
the wheel, starts to head away.
DARCY
Keep the credits. I'll intern at
Burger King.
JANE
What are you doing?!
DARCY
Saving our lives!
Jane grabs the wheel, jerks it hard the other way. They
struggle for control, when the headlights fall on --
A MAN
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 5.
Directly in their path, stumbling through the winds. Darcy
slams on the brakes, Jane turns the wheel hard to avoid him.
The SUV swerves -- but too late.
Jane, Darcy, and Selvig trade shocked looks, breathing hard.
They peer through the dust clouds, unable to see through.
A paralyzed moment, then they all leap out of the car.
Odin turns away from the window. His wife FRIGGA sits at a
vanity and tries different earrings before the mirror.
ODIN
Do you think he's ready?
FRIGGA
He thinks he is. He has his
father's confidence.
ODIN
He'll need his father's wisdom.
FRIGGA
And his humility?
Odin reacts.
FRIGGA (CONT'D)
Thor won't be alone. Loki will be
at his side to give him counsel.
Have faith in your sons.
ODIN
Yes, but Thor's still a boy. He
could be a great King...
Odin stops, notices HIS HAND SHAKING. It seems to be out of
synch temporally with the rest of the world, leaving a trail
as it moves. He stares at it determinedly, concentrating,
trying to stop the strange event through the force of his
sheer will.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 8.
Finally, the occurrence subsides, his hand normal once more.
A worried Frigga covers his hand with her own.
ODIN (CONT'D)
(QUIETLY)
...if we only had more time.
FRIGGA
For once, our son needs something
we cannot provide.
ODIN
I can fight it a little longer...
FRIGGA
No. You've put it off too long! I
worry for you.
He touches her cheek.
ODIN
I've destroyed demons and monsters,
devastated whole worlds, laid waste
to mighty kingdoms, and still you
worry for me?
FRIGGA
Always.
ODIN
Not today. Now come kiss your
king... while I'm still king.
He pulls her close, and they kiss.
Directly under the throne room, a gloomily lit hall. Banners
hang on either side to form a corridor down the middle of the
fire lit room.
Giant doors open at one end. A huge figure silhouetted
against the bright light beyond walks forward. In slo-mo, we
recognize the unmistakable shape of the God of Thunder.
Hammer in hand, he reaches the end of a raised platform.
An ATTENDANT hands the figure a goblet of wine.
He downs it quickly, hurls it towards the fire directly
below.
THOR
Another!
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 8A.
The cup smashes, the alcohol causes the fire to glow
intensely -- and, for a moment, brightly lit, and seen full
length, like a King to be, is THE MIGHTY THOR.
He proceeds down stops, past camera, and down the center of
the Hall.
We follow from behind and see at the other end, massively
shadowed on one of the great banners, the shape of two great
horns. As Thor approaches, the horn shapes move, and then,
from the shadows at the side, emerges LOKI, wearing his
horned headpiece.
Like Thor, he is dressed for a great ceremony. They stand by
a brazier at the foot of steps that lead up to the crowded
throne room.
LOKI
(TO THOR)
Nervous, brother?
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 9.
THOR
Have you ever known me to be
nervous?
LOKI
There was the time in Nornheim...
THOR
That wasn't nerves, brother. It
was the rage of battle. How else
could I have fought my way through
a hundred warriors and pulled us
out alive?
The Attendant approaches with another goblet of wine for
Thor.
LOKI
As I recall, I was the one who
veiled us in smoke to ease our
escape.
THOR
Some do battle, others just do
tricks.
The Attendant stifles a laugh. Loki notices, doesn't like
it. He gestures towards the goblet in the Attendant's hand.
EELS pour over the sides of the goblet, slithering out and
across the terrified Attendant's hand. He SCREAMS, hurls the
goblet to the ground. Loki chuckles.
THOR (CONT'D)
Loki...
Loki gestures to the writhing eels on the ground. They turn
back to spilled wine, the illusion shattered.
THOR (CONT'D)
Now that was just a waste of good
wine.
LOKI
Just a bit of fun.
(to the Attendant)
Right, my friend?
The Attendant isn't so sure. Thor dons his EAGLE-WINGED
HELMET.
LOKI (CONT'D)
(re: Thor's helmet)
Nice feathers.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 9A.
THOR
You don't really want to start this
again, do you, Cow?
LOKI
I was being sincere!
THOR
You're incapable of sincerity.
LOKI
Am I?
He looks his brother in the eye, all pretense lost.
LOKI (CONT'D)
I've looked forward to this day as
long as you have. You're my
brother and my friend. Sometimes
I'm envious, but never doubt that I
love you.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 10.
Thor searches his brother's face, sees no trace of irony.
He's either speaking from his heart or he's a very, very good
liar. Maybe both. Thor puts an appreciative hand on his
brother's shoulder.
THOR
Thank you.
The two brothers take in the moment a beat, then:
LOKI
Give us a kiss.
THOR
Stop.
Thor makes the final adjustments to his ceremonial wear.
THOR (CONT'D)
How do I look?
LOKI
Like a king.
They hear the blast of a CEREMONIAL HORN.
LOKI (CONT'D)
It's time.
THOR
You go ahead.
Loki casts him a wary look.
THOR (CONT'D)
I'll be along. Go on.
Loki heads inside the palace without his brother.
VOLSTAGG combs his great beard in preparation for the big
event. As he does, he's surprised to find a stray GRAPE
stuck in the beard. He pulls it out, looks around, then
eagerly pops it into his mouth and gobbles it down.
FANDRAL checks his reflection in a mirror, smooths out his
moustache, gives himself a dashing smile. A PRETTY MAIDEN
holds the mirror before him, as other MAIDENS look on
dreamily.
FANDRAL
Thank you, love.
(to the Maidens)
(MORE)
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 10A.
FANDRAL (CONT'D)
Now who'd like to polish my sword
for me?
The giddy Maidens eagerly raise their hands.
HOGUN stands staring ahead grimly, his hands folded in front
of him, amidst the hustle and bustle of the ATTENDANTS and
the ceremony preparations going on around him. A HELPFUL
ATTENDANT approaches him and starts to polish his armor.
Hogun turns his head, gives him a look. Intimidated, the
Attendant quickly backs away.
From behind, we see a WOMAN IN CEREMONIAL ARMOR take off her
SWORD and set it on a table, then her SHIELD, then several
HIDDEN DAGGERS and small, yet intimidating WEAPONS. We
reveal that it's SIF, looking radiant. She eyes the weapons
on the table.
SIF
(to the weapons)
I'll miss you.
Colorful CEREMONIAL BANNERS of the Nine Realms adorn the
room, crowded with AESIR and REPRESENTATIVES from across
Yggdrasil, all BUZZING with excitement.
Thor's COMRADES enter and stride to their place of honor at
the front of the hall. They are:
THE WARRIORS THREE
VOLSTAGG has the girth and strength of a Sumo wrestler, with
oversized passions to match. FANDRAL, the consummate
swashbuckler, is agile, charismatic, and nattily dressed.
HOGUN -- dark, sullen, brooding -- a large MACE slung at his
side.
With them walks the warrior maiden SIF. She's clad in armor,
a shield and sword at her side -- a beauty not to be trifled
with.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 11.
VOLSTAGG
I hope this goes quickly. I'm
famished.
FANDRAL
(FEIGNED DISBELIEF)
Noooo!
VOLSTAGG
Are you attached to that pretty
face of yours? Because one more
word, and you won't be.
FANDRAL
(to the others)
My, we are hungry, aren't we?
The others laugh, save Hogun. Fandral turns to him.
FANDRAL (CONT'D)
Go on, Hogun. Smile. You can do
it. Even you, Hogun the Grim.
Just one smile.
Hogun stares at him grimly.
FANDRAL (CONT'D)
All right, half a smile. Look,
forget the smile, just show some
teeth.
SIF
Fandral, is it true the famous
Warriors Three are ready to meet
any challenge?
FANDRAL
Name it, Lady Sif.
SIF
Keep your mouth shut.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 12.
Imposing EINHERJAR GUARDS clad in armor, swords at the ready,
stand watch inside the massive underground structure beneath
the palace.
A cold BREEZE blows past them.
Thor stands, his fingers nervously drumming the handle of his
hammer. Frigga approaches behind him, sees his anxiety.
FRIGGA
It's all right to be nervous.
THOR
Why does everyone keep saying that?
I'm not nervous!
FRIGGA
You may be able to fool the rest of
ASGARD --
THOR
...but never you. I know.
FRIGGA
Thor, just remember that you have
something even the great Allfather
never had.
THOR
And what is that?
FRIGGA
Me for a mother.
She smiles.
FRIGGA (CONT'D)
Now don't keep your father waiting.
Frigga leaves.
Sif and the Warriors Three still wait before the crowd. Loki
and Frigga enter. Loki takes his place at the front of the
hall alongside the others. With another blast of the horn,
the crowd goes silent as the EINHERJAR HONOR GUARD moves into
formation. They part to reveal --
ODIN
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 12A.
Sitting atop his throne, clad in full ceremonial armor. He
holds his spear GUNGNIR before him. Any trace of weakness in
him is gone now. He exudes all the power and majesty of a
Ruler of Asgard.
Frigga joins him at his side. He looks around the hall,
casts a glance over to the Warriors. Thor is nowhere to be
seen. Odin looks to Loki. Loki shrugs. Odin isn't pleased.
A murmur spreads through the crowd.
VOLSTAGG
(sotto, to Loki)
Where is he?
LOKI
He said he'd be along.
Sif realizes the truth, shakes her head in disapproval.
VOLSTAGG
What?
SIF
He wants to make an entrance.
FANDRAL
Well, if he doesn't show up soon,
he shouldn't bother. Odin looks
like he's ready to feed him to his
ravens.
LOKI
I wouldn't worry. Father will
forgive him. He always does.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 13.
Just then, at the back of the hall, up the steps from the
lower level --
MJOLNIR
Roars up into the hall, Thor strides cockily into the hall
behind it, catching it behind his back. The CROWD erupts in
CHEERS. Thor spins his hammer with a flourish, holds it up
before the crowd, basking in the moment, relishing the
adoration, whipping his audience up into a frenzy.
SIF
Oh, please.
Odin watches from the front, not liking this showy display.
As the sound of the cheers echo from above, the odd, cold
breeze picks up in the Vault. The Guards rub their limbs to
warm themselves. They grow increasingly uneasy, sensing
something's not right.
They exchange a look, then walk the length of the Vault's
hallway to its end, where a CASKET sits undisturbed upon a
pedestal.
LARGE SHADOWS suddenly loom over them. They look up and
SHOUT in terror as they raise their weapons.
Thor finishes stirring up the crowd, then reaches the front
of the room, kneels on one knee before his mother and father.
Frigga casts him an admonishing glance. Thor winks up at
her. She can't help but smile.
Odin strikes Gungnir upon the ground with a deafening BOOM.
The crowd falls silent. Odin speaks with quiet, effortless
authority.
He raises Gungnir before him.
ODIN
Gungnir. Its aim is true, its
power strong. With it I have
defended Asgard and the lives of
the innocent across the Nine Realms
since the time of the Great
Beginning. And though the day has
come for a new King to wield his
own weapon -- that duty remains the
same. Thor Odinson, my heir, my
first-born.
(MORE)
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 13A.
ODIN (CONT'D)
So long entrusted with this mighty
hammer, Mjolnir. Forged in the
heart of a dying star, from the
sacred metal of Uru. Only one may
lift it. Only one is worthy. Who
wields this hammer commands the
lightning and the storm. Its power
has no equal -- as a weapon, to
destroy, or as a tool, to build.
It is a fit companion for a King.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 14.
The bodies of the Guards are flung to the Vault's floor, now
strewn with ice. We don't see their attackers clearly, just
catch glimpses of them in the shadows -- but they are large
and BLUE-SKINNED.
One of the creatures lifts the Casket off its stand and turns
to go. But, as they do, the intricate latticework behind the
Casket starts to separate and retract, revealing something
standing in the shadows behind it.
As the creatures walk away, a fiery glow rises behind them.
They turn back around.
Now it's their turn to SCREAM.
The Ceremony continues.
ODIN
Today I entrust you with the
greatest honor in all the Nine
Realms. The sacred throne of
Asgard. I have sacrificed much to
achieve peace. So, too, must a new
generation sacrifice to maintain
that peace. Responsibility, duty,
honor. These are not merely
virtues to which we must aspire.
They are essential to every soldier
and to every King.
The Crowd and the Warriors Three start to shiver and rub
their limbs for warmth in the increasingly cold air of the
hall.
Thor turns back to face his father. Odin looks upon his son
with pride.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 15.
ODIN (CONT'D)
Thor Odinson, do you swear to guard
the Nine Realms?
THOR
I swear.
ODIN
Do you swear to preserve the peace?
THOR
I swear.
ODIN
Do you swear to cast aside all
selfish ambition and pledge
yourself only to the good of all
the Realms?
Beat.
THOR
I swear.
ODIN
Then on this day, I, Odin
Allfather, proclaim you--
Odin hesitates, noticing a strange sight before him. ICE
creeps across the surface of the large banners around the
hall, making an eerie CRACKING sound. Thor, his comrades,
and the crowd see it too.
ODIN (CONT'D)
(REALIZING)
Frost giants...
The far-off sounds of a BATTLE echo in the depths of the
palace below. Sif and the Warriors Three reach for their
weapons, as Thor races from the hall.
24A OMITTED SCENE MOVED BELOW 24A
25 OMITTED SCENE COMBINED WITH SCENE 25B BELOW 25
25A OMITTED 25A
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 16.
Thor enters, then stares shocked at the sight before him.
Sif, the Warriors Three, and Loki hurry in behind Thor and
stop short.
Shattered and melting ICE is strewn about the floor.
We don't see the blue-skinned bodies of the Frost Giants
clearly, just catch glimpses of their twisted and smoldering
remains on the floor.
They've just lost a savage battle. Badly.
Amidst them, shrouded in shadow, stands the black metal
creature, a fiery glow coming from within it.
It is THE DESTROYER. It holds the Casket in its hands.
SIF
The Destroyer.
VOLSTAGG
(AWED)
I thought it was but a legend.
Odin steps in behind the Asgardians, as the Destroyer sets
the Casket back on its pedestal. It moves back to its post,
the faint, FIERY GLOW extinguishes within it.
Fandral looks around the Vault, ill at ease.
FANDRAL
I've never been inside the Vault
before. It's said the Tesseract
was once held here.
VOLSTAGG
(AWED)
The Tesseract? I thought that was
but a legend too!
SIF
Shush!
Odin surveys the destruction.
THOR
The Jotuns must pay for what
they've done!
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 16A.
ODIN
They have paid with their lives.
The Destroyer did its job, and the
Casket is safe. All is well.
THOR
"All is well?!" They broke into
the Weapons Vault! If the Frost
Giants had stolen even one of these
RELICS--
ODIN
But they didn't.
THOR
I want to know why they--
ODIN
(INTERRUPTING)
The Casket of Ancient Winters
belonged to the Jotuns. They
believe it's their birthright.
THOR
And if you hadn't taken it from
them they would have laid waste to
all the Nine Realms!
ODIN
I have a truce with Laufey, the
Jotun King.
THOR
He just broke your truce! We must
act!
Odin turns to Sif and the Warriors Three.
ODIN
Leave us.
Thor's comrades exit. Odin eyes Thor, as Loki watches.
ODIN (CONT'D)
And what action would you take?
THOR
March into Jotunheim as you once
did, teach them a lesson, break
their spirits so they'll never dare
try to cross our borders again!
ODIN
You're thinking only as a warrior!
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 16B.
THOR
This was an act of war!
ODIN
It was the act of but a few, doomed
to fail.
THOR
They got this far!
ODIN
We will find the breach in our
defenses. It will be found, and it
will be sealed.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 17.
THOR
As King of Asgard, I would--
ODIN
You are not King. Not yet.
Thor sees in his father's face that he's pushed this as far
as he can. He backs away, then leaves, pushing through the
doors so hard that they SLAM backwards behind him. Odin
watches him go.
Thor stands in the empty hall, bearing the signs of the
festivities cancelled due to the events of the day. Anger
and frustration rising within him, Thor upends one of the
massive tables.
From across the room, Loki watches him.
AT THE BANQUET HALL ENTRANCE
Sif, Fandral, and Hogun follow Volstagg as he enters in
search of his dinner.
SIF
Redecorating, are we?
Volstagg surveys the overturned tables and food, aghast.
VOLSTAGG
What's this -- ?!
HOGUN
I told you they'd cancel it.
FANDRAL
We thought that was just you being
your normal cheery self.
Volstagg looks about the floor, despairing.
VOLSTAGG
All this food -- so innocent, cast
to the ground. It breaks the
heart!
Thor strides away from them to the far end of the hall. Loki
calmly moves towards him.
THOR
It's unwise to be in my company
right now, brother.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 18.
LOKI
Who said I was wise?
THOR
(re: the empty hall)
This was to be my day of triumph.
LOKI
It will come. In time.
(ADMITS)
If it's any consolation, I think
you're right. About the Frost
Giants, about Laufey, everything.
If a few of them could penetrate
the defenses of Asgard once, who's
to say they won't try again. Next
time with an army?
THOR
Yes, exactly!
LOKI
But there's nothing we can do
without defying Father.
Thor considers this, looks at his hammer, a gleam in his eye.
Loki can guess what he's thinking, grows concerned.
LOKI (CONT'D)
No... stop there! I know that
look!
THOR
It's the only way to ensure the
safety of our borders.
LOKI
It's madness!
VOLSTAGG
Madness? What sort of madness?
LOKI
Nothing! Thor was making a jest!
THOR
The safety of our Realm is no jest.
We're going to Jotunheim.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 19.
FANDRAL
What?!
SIF
Thor, of all the laws of Asgard,
this is one you must not break.
Loki looks on, intrigued by the proceedings.
FANDRAL
This isn't like a journey to Earth,
where you summon a little lightning
and thunder and the mortals worship
you as a god. This is Jotunheim.
VOLSTAGG
And if the Frost Giants don't kill
you, your Father will!
THOR
My father fought his way into
Jotunheim, defeated their armies,
and took their Casket! We'd just
be looking for answers.
SIF
It is forbidden!
Thor sizes up his friends, smiles. He proceeds to make his
case with enthusiasm and charismatic conviction.
THOR
My friends, have you forgotten all
that we've done together?
He turns to Fandral.
THOR (CONT'D)
Who brought you into the sweet
embrace of the most exotic maidens
in all of Yggdrasil?
FANDRAL
You did.
THOR
(TO HOGUN)
Who led you into the most glorious
of battles...
(TO VOLSTAGG)
...and to delicacies so succulent,
you thought you'd died and gone to
Valhalla?
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 19A.
VOLSTAGG/HOGUN
You did. / You did.
He turns to Sif.
THOR
And who proved wrong all who
scoffed at the idea that a young
maiden could be one of the fiercest
warriors this Realm has ever known?
SIF
I did.
THOR
(QUICKLY)
True. But I supported you...
(then, to the others)
My friends, trust me now. We must
do this.
The others exchange concerned looks, realize there's no
convincing him.
THOR (CONT'D)
Come on. You're not going to let
my brother and me take all the
glory, are you?
Loki looks startled.
LOKI
What?
THOR
You are coming with me...
LOKI
Yes, of course! I won't let my
brother march into Jotunheim alone.
I will be at his side.
VOLSTAGG
And I.
FANDRAL
And I.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 20.
HOGUN
And I. The Warriors Three fight
together.
SIF
I fear we'll live to regret this.
VOLSTAGG
If we're lucky.
Thor and the others enter the Observatory, step onto a
platform. Heimdall climbs into the large control apparatus
at the center of the room and readies the Observatory.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 23.
HEIMDALL
Be warned. I will honor my sworn
oath to protect this Realm as its
Gatekeeper. If your return
threatens the safety of Asgard,
Bifrost will remain closed to you.
You'll be left to die in the cold
wastes of Jotunheim.
THOR
I have no plans to die today.
HEIMDALL
None do.
Heimdall inserts his sword into the control panel, and the
apparatus of the Observatory starts up.
Heimdall turns his sword in the control panel. The
Observatory's giant turret swings around, aims toward a
section of space. As a final step, Heimdall plunges his
sword deeper into the control panel. The great turret FIRES,
the RAINBOW LIGHT of Bifrost energy blasts out of it.
The Bifrost opens at the end of the platform upon which Thor
and his five comrades stand.
HEIMDALL
All is ready. You may pass.
VOLSTAGG
Couldn't you just leave the bridge
open for us?
HEIMDALL
To keep this bridge open would
unleash the full power of the
Bifrost and destroy Jotunheim with
you upon it.
VOLSTAGG
Ah. Never mind, then.
Thor starts towards the Bifrost, turns back to the others,
grins.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 23A.
THOR
Come on. Don't be bashful.
The others join him at his side, then step towards the
Bifrost. Their bodies stretch towards the maelstrom,
changing shape, as if every atom of their being is being
elongated by the pull of it. In an instant, they're jerked
off the platform and inside the vortex.
Heimdall stands at the Observatory controls. Odin pulls
Heimdall's sword from the control panel and throws it to him.
Heimdall backs away.
THOR
Why did you bring us back?
ODIN
Do you realize what you've done?
What you've started?
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 33A.
THOR
I was protecting my home.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 34.
ODIN
You cannot protect your friends.
How can you hope to protect a
kingdom?
Odin turns to the others.
ODIN (CONT'D)
(RE: FANDRAL)
Get him to the healing room!
Sif, Volstagg, and Hogun hurry to help Fandral out of the
room.
THOR
There won't be a kingdom to protect
if you're afraid to act!
Odin stares at him.
THOR (CONT'D)
Whatever the cost, the world must
know that the new King of Asgard
will not be held in contempt.
ODIN
That's pride and vanity that talks!
Not leadership! Have you forgotten
everything I've taught you? What
of a warrior's patience, cunning?
THOR
While you wait and be patient, the
Nine Realms laugh at us! The old
ways are done. You'd stand giving
speeches while Asgard falls!
ODIN
You're a vain, greedy, cruel boy!
THOR
And you are an old man and a fool!
The whole world seems to stop at Thor's words. Odin falls
quiet. When he speaks again, there's something terrifying
beneath the calmness of his words.
ODIN
A fool, yes! I was a fool to think
you were ready.
Loki takes a step towards Odin imploringly.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 34A.
LOKI
FATHER--
Odin turns and gives Loki a look which stops him in his
tracks.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 35.
ODIN
Thor Odinson... You have disobeyed
the express command of your King.
Through your arrogance and
stupidity, you have opened these
peaceful Realms and innocent lives
to the horrors of war.
The Allfather plunges Gungnir into Observatory's control
panel. The turret turns, the Bifrost energy building along
with Odin's rage. It FIRES, as the Bifrost opens at the end
of the platform, creating a portal behind Thor.
Odin turns angrily to his son.
ODIN (CONT'D)
You are unworthy of this Realm...
Odin RIPS a disc off Thor's chest.
ODIN (CONT'D)
...unworthy of your title...
He rips away Thor's cloak.
ODIN (CONT'D)
...unworthy of the loved ones
you've betrayed. I hereby take
from you your powers.
Odin extends his hand towards his son. Mjolnir goes flying
from Thor's grasp into Odin's hand.
ODIN (CONT'D)
In the name of my father...
A FINGER OF LIGHTNING comes off the hammer and hits Thor,
disintegrating the right arm of his armor and part of the
chest piece.
ODIN (CONT'D)
...and of his father before...
Another strike disintegrates the remainder of Thor's armor,
including the cape and torn-away disc on the floor.
ODIN (CONT'D)
I cast you out!
Odin thrusts Mjolnir before him and -- with a CRACK OF
THUNDER -- Thor is hurled backwards into the open Bifrost and
disappears in the vortex.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 35A.
Odin holds Mjolnir in his hand, stares at it bitterly. He
closes his eyes, lost in contemplation, whispers something
quietly.
ODIN (CONT'D)
(WHISPERING)
Whosoever holds this hammer, if he
be worthy, shall possess the power
of Thor.
RUNES appear on the side of the hammer, as if carved into its
smooth surface. The runes linger for but a moment, then
disappear. Suddenly, Odin turns and hurls the hammer into
the Bifrost.
CUT TO BLACK.
Selvig watches the unconscious Thor with interest as two
ORDERLIES set the Asgardian onto a gurney. Jane and Darcy
stand before a sweet, ditzy ADMISSIONS NURSE.
ADMISSIONS NURSE
Name?
JANE
He said it was "Thor."
The Nurse painstakingly types it into the computer, one key
at a time. Jane watches as Thor is wheeled out of the room.
ADMISSIONS NURSE
(SPELLING)
T-H-O-R. And your relationship to
him?
JANE
I've never met him before.
DARCY
Until she hit him with the car.
JANE
Grazed him, actually.
(THEN)
Oh, and we tasered him, too.
ADMISSIONS NURSE
(SYMPATHETIC)
Must have been quite the spat.
JANE
I told you, I don't know him. I
just want to make sure he's okay.
ADMISSIONS NURSE
I'm going to need a name and
contact number.
JANE
Jane Foster.
ADMISSIONS NURSE
(TYPING SLOWLY)
J...A...N...
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 39A.
SELVIG
Oh, for God's sake...
He reaches over Jane's shoulder and hands the Nurse his
business card.
SELVIG (CONT'D)
Here. Let's go.
Selvig, Darcy, and Jane head out.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 40.
Thor, now in a hospital gown, winces in pain as he awakens on
a gurney to find a NURSE standing over him, a syringe in his
arm.
NURSE
Hi. Just taking a little blood.
Thor SLAPS the syringe away angrily, starts to sit up.
THOR
How dare you attack the son of
Odin!
NURSE
I need some help!
Two ORDERLIES race over, try to hold Thor down.
NURSE (CONT'D)
We're trying to help you!
THOR
Then bring me a healing stone, you
savages!
He hurls one of them off, smashing against a wall. Now a
couple SECURITY GUARDS and MALE NURSES join the fracas, all
struggling to hold Thor down. Medical equipment goes flying,
furniture overturned.
ORDERLY
What the hell is this guy on?
Finally, they force him back down onto the gurney. Thor
looks shocked and amazed that he's actually being overpowered
by this small group. The NURSE injects him with a sedative.
THOR
You're no match for the Mighty--
Thor struggles a beat, then passes out.
The distant mountains glint snow in the early morning light.
Selvig appears with a cup of coffee and surveys the vast
desert. He turns back into the lab and sees Jane, busy at
her workstation, soldering a piece of equipment.
A printer churns out blown-up screen-cap PHOTOS of the
Bifrost footage. Darcy hangs them on the wall.
Selvig surveys the scene, watches how Jane works, impressed.
He notices a monitor which displays a complex program
entitled "J. FOSTER ALGORITHM ANALYSIS". He looks proud.
The three of them have been up all night, fueled by caffeine
and excitement.
JANE
Darcy, when you're done, take the
soil samples to Professor Meyers in
geology. Remind him, he owes me.
SELVIG
We might want to perform a spectral
analysis.
JANE
"We?"
SELVIG
I flew all the way out here --
might as well make myself useful.
This is the offer Jane's been waiting for. She gets up,
inserts the piece of equipment she's been working on into a
rack-mounted server.
JANE
You know what would be really
useful? Do you still have that
friend at LIGO?
SELVIG
She was more than a friend.
JANE
Could you call in a favor?
SELVIG
You don't think this was just a
magnetic storm?
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 41A.
JANE
If I'm right, their observatory
must have picked up gravitational
waves during last night's event.
SELVIG
Meaning?
Jane heads over to a computer monitor. Selvig follows.
JANE
Meaning these anomalies might
signify something bigger.
SELVIG
How "big" are we talking about?
Jane indicates the footage on the monitor. As the last of
the Bifrost cloud disappears into the night sky, there
appears to be a blister in space, bulging out in convex and
covered with stars.
JANE
I think the lensing around the
edges is characteristic of an
Einstein-Rosen Bridge.
DARCY
A what?
SELVIG
I thought you were a science major.
DARCY
Political Science.
Selvig shoots Jane a confused look. Jane shrugs.
JANE
She was the only applicant.
SELVIG
(TO DARCY)
An Einstein-Rosen Bridge -- a
"theoretical" connection between
two different points of space-time.
Darcy stares blankly.
JANE
(TO DARCY)
A wormhole.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 41B.
Selvig looks skeptical. Jane prints out a frame-grab off the
monitor.
JANE (CONT'D)
Erik, look...
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 42.
Jane indicates the print-out showing the constellations seen
through the "bubble" in the clouds.
JANE (CONT'D)
What do you see here?
SELVIG
Stars.
JANE
Yes. But not our stars.
She spreads out a STAR CHART, barely able to contain her
excitement.
JANE (CONT'D)
This is the star alignment for our
quadrant, this time of year. So
unless Ursa Minor decided to take
the day off... those are someone
else's constellations.
Selvig's intrigued, in spite of himself.
Darcy pulls another frame-grab of the Bifrost footage from
the printer and hangs it on the wall, when something in the
image catches her eye.
DARCY
Hey, check it out.
Jane and Selvig examine the photo, amazed.
SELVIG
Is that...?
JANE
I think I left something at the
hospital.
As Jane walks away, we REVEAL the photo. Inside the Bifrost
funnel cloud is a FIGURE -- the vague, but unmistakable shape
of a MAN.
Frigga enters to find Odin standing lost in thought.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 42A.
FRIGGA
How could you have done this?
ODIN
Do you understand what he set in
motion? He's taken us to the brink
of war!
FRIGGA
But banishment? You would lose him
forever? He's your son!
ODIN
What would you have done?
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 43.
FRIGGA
I would not have exiled him to a
world of mortals, stripped of his
powers, to suffer alone. I would
not have had the heart for such
cruelty!
ODIN
That is why I'm King.
(THEN)
I, too, grieve the loss of our son.
But there are some things that even
I cannot undo.
FRIGGA
You can bring him back.
ODIN
No. His fate is in his own hands
now.
Thor awakens on a hospital bed. He notices RESTRAINTS on his
wrists now. He pulls at them, tries to free himself, to no
avail.
THOR
It's not possible.
He tries again, mustering all his strength. One of his hands
slips free from its restraint.
Jane again faces the Admissions Nurse, with Selvig and Darcy
nearby.
ADMISSIONS NURSE
I'm sorry, only relatives can visit
patients.
JANE
(THINKING FAST)
But... I'm his wife.
Darcy stifles a SNICKER at this, as the Nurse looks doubtful.
ADMISSIONS NURSE
I thought you said you didn't know
him.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 43A.
JANE
I meant I barely know him anymore.
The man he's become. He's changed.
I mean, what woman really knows her
husband, anyway?
ADMISSIONS NURSE
None of us, dear. He's in Room
102.
Jane, Selvig, and Darcy head down the corridor, passing the
destruction of the ER Thor wrecked the previous night.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 44.
They enter Thor's room.
They step inside to find Thor's bed empty.
Jane starts the car, frustrated.
JANE
Typical. I just lost my most
important piece of evidence.
DARCY
So now what?
JANE
We find him.
SELVIG
Did you see what he did in there?
I don't know if finding him is the
best idea.
JANE
I want to know what that thing was,
and he may have the answers. We
don't have a choice.
DARCY
Oo-kay.
She pulls out her taser and a can of mace.
SELVIG
So we're just going to spend the
rest of the day looking for him?
JANE
However long it takes.
Jane puts the car in reverse and backs up, when --
BAM!
She collides with Thor again, dressed in stolen hospital
scrubs. Jane and Selvig exchange a look.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 44A.
Sif, Loki, and the Warriors three, battered and shell-
shocked, still reeling from the day's events, sit before a
ROARING central fire.
Hogun reaches into the flames, pulls out some fragile HEALING
STONES. Neither the fire, nor the stones burn him. As he
carefully places the stones over the wounds of his comrades,
the stones begin to glow. He crushes them to a powder. His
comrades' injuries heal up at the glowing powder's touch.
Fandral winces in pain as Hogun heals his gaping wound.
Volstagg looks at the skin on his arm -- healing, but still
blackened from the necrotizing touch of the Frost Giant.
Loki watches him, then stares at his own arm, where the
Giant's touch turned his skin blue. It's undamaged, back to
its normal color.
VOLSTAGG
We should never have let him go.
SIF
There was no stopping him.
FANDRAL
At least he's only banished, not
dead. Which is what we'd all be if
that guard hadn't told Odin where
we'd gone.
VOLSTAGG
How did the guard even know?
Loki stares at his arm.
LOKI
I told him.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 45A.
FANDRAL
What?
LOKI
I told him to go to Odin after we'd
left. Though he should be flogged
for taking so long.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 46.
VOLSTAGG
You told the guard?
LOKI
I saved our lives! And Thor's. I
had no idea Father would banish him
for what he did.
SIF
Loki, you're the only one who can
help Thor now. You must go to the
Allfather and convince him to
change his mind!
LOKI
And if I do, then what? I love
Thor more dearly than any of you,
but you know what he is. He's
arrogant. He's reckless. He's
dangerous. You saw how he was
today. Is that what Asgard needs
from its King?
The others exchange glances, torn. Loki has a point. He
leaves the room. Hogun stares after him.
SIF
He may speak about the good of
Asgard, but he's always been
jealous of Thor.
VOLSTAGG
True, but we should be grateful to
him. He did save our lives.
HOGUN
Laufey said there were traitors in
the House of Odin.
The others turn to the usually quiet Hogun.
FANDRAL
Why is it every time you choose to
speak, it has to be something dark
and ominous?
HOGUN
A master of magic could easily
bring three Jotuns into Asgard.
The others look to Hogun, understanding the implication.
VOLSTAGG
No! Surely not!
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 46A.
FANDRAL
Loki's always been one for
mischief, but you're talking about
something else entirely.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 47.
SIF
Who else could elude Heimdall's
gaze with tricks of light and
shadow?
VOLSTAGG
The ceremony was interrupted just
before Thor was named King.
SIF
We should go to the Allfather.
FANDRAL
And tell him what? "Oh, by the
way, we think your son just
betrayed the throne. And do us a
favor. Bring back Thor. There's a
good fellow!"
SIF
It's our duty. If any of our
suspicions are right, then all of
Asgard is in danger.
Loki heads into the Vault, sees the Casket of Ancient Winters
sitting on its stand.
He walks over to it slowly, reaches out to it, lifts it
between his forearms off its pedestal. As he does, a
blueness spreads from his arms, across his body.
The latticework behind the Casket starts to separate, the
Destroyer rousing. A fire starts to glow within its black
metal armor, as it rattles to life, but Loki ignores it --
the blueness spreading further, consuming his whole body.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 48.
ODIN (O.S.)
Stop!
Loki turns, sees Odin hurrying into the room, the Destroyer
goes motionless, the latticework rejoining before it.
Odin eyes Loki with dismay.
LOKI
Am I cursed?
ODIN
No. Put the Casket down.
Loki sets the Casket back upon its pedestal, his body quickly
returning to its normal form and color. He stares at his
father.
LOKI
What am I?
ODIN
You're my son.
LOKI
What more than that?
Odin doesn't answer. He looks suddenly weary, burdened.
Loki sizes him up, realizes the truth.
LOKI (CONT'D)
The Casket wasn't the only thing
you took from Jotunheim that day,
was it?
Odin looks him in the eye. He can deny it no longer.
ODIN
No.
(BEAT)
In the aftermath of the battle, I
went into the Temple, and I found a
baby. Small for a giant's
offspring -- abandoned, suffering,
left to die. Laufey's son.
Loki is sent reeling by the revelation.
LOKI
Laufey's son...
He desperately struggles to make sense of it all.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 48A.
LOKI (CONT'D)
Why? You were knee-deep in Jotun
blood. Why would you take me?
ODIN
You were an innocent child.
LOKI
You took me for a purpose, what was
it?
Odin doesn't answer.
LOKI (CONT'D)
Tell me!
ODIN
I thought we could unite our
kingdoms one day, bring about an
alliance, bring about a permanent
peace... through you. But those
plans no longer matter.
LOKI
So I am no more than another stolen
relic, locked up here until you
might have use of me.
ODIN
Why do you twist my words?
LOKI
You could have told me what I was
from the beginning. Why didn't
you?
ODIN
You are my son. My blood. I
wanted only to protect you from the
truth.
LOKI
Because I am the monster parents
tell their children about at night?
ODIN
Don't...
LOKI
It all makes sense now. Why you
favored Thor all these years.
ODIN
Listen...
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 48B.
LOKI
Because no matter how much you
claim to "love" me, you could never
have a Frost Giant sitting on the
Throne of Asgard!
Odin's body begins to shake, he lifts his hand. It starts to
move out of synch temporarily, leaving a trail, the effect of
the Odinsleep approaching. Loki doesn't notice as Odin tries
to fight it off.
ODIN
Listen to me!
Loki strides away towards the exit.
ODIN (CONT'D)
Loki!
Odin starts towards him, when the enormous mental, emotional,
and physical strain of recent events finally takes its toll.
The effect of the Odinsleep consumes him. His entire body
now moves out of sync with the rest of the world, leaving
trails behind him as he staggers backwards.
Odin falls back against a wall, his face contorting in a
scream. He collapses to the stone floor.
Loki, shocked, hurries to him. He takes Odin in his arms,
calls out.
LOKI
Guards!

4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 50.
In a back room, Thor, now shirtless and wearing jeans, looks
around for a t-shirt.
Jane and Darcy, standing in the lab, can't help but notice
his reflection in the mirror. Darcy eyes his powerful build,
rippling biceps.
DARCY
You know, for a crazy homeless guy,
he's pretty cut.
Jane turns away. Thor emerges from the back room, holding a
t-shirt.
DARCY (CONT'D)
Hey, sorry I tased you!
Thor heads over to Jane's work area, starts fiddling with the
equipment there with interest. Jane hurries over to put a
stop to it.
JANE
Excuse me... excuse me!
She leads him away from the work station. Thor holds up the
t-shirt. On the front, it bear a sticker which reads:
"HELLO, MY NAME IS DR. DONALD BLAKE". Thor looks at it,
puzzled. Jane rips the sticker off.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 52.
JANE (CONT'D)
My ex.
Thor stares at her a beat.
JANE (CONT'D)
They're the only clothes I had
that'll fit you. Sorry.
THOR
They will suffice.
Thor turns his attention to the pictures of the Bifrost on
the wall.
JANE
You're welcome. Now tell me...
Thor studies the frame-grabs with interest. Jane points to
his form in the Bifrost photo.
JANE (CONT'D)
What were you doing, in that?
He glances at it, dismissive.
THOR
What does anyone do in the Bifrost?
Everyone stares at him. Selvig seems to recognize the word.
Jane opens her notebook, quickly writes the word down. Thor
moves close to her, eyes the notations and drawings within
the book, curious.
SELVIG
(amused, skeptical)
The Bifrost...
Jane starts to get uncomfortable with Thor standing so close
to her, looking over her notations. She quickly closes the
book.
JANE
What exactly is the Bifrost?
THOR
(IGNORING HER)
This mortal form has grown weak.
JANE
BUT--
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 52A.
JANE (CONT'D)
Somebody get the mortal a Pop-Tart.
Frigga sits at her husband's bedside, holding his hand. Odin
lies there -- looking pale and lifeless, his body and the
space around it warped from the effect of the Odinsleep. The
walls of the chamber have moved close around him, protecting
him like a dark crypt, sealing off any daylight.
Loki sits at Odin's side, across from Frigga. She speaks
softly to him.
FRIGGA
I asked him to be honest with you
from the beginning. There should
be no secrets in a family.
LOKI
So why did he lie?
FRIGGA
He kept the truth from you so that
you would never feel different.
You are in every way our son, Loki,
and we your family. You must know
that.
Loki takes this in, stares at Odin.
FRIGGA (CONT'D)
(RE: ODIN)
You can speak to him. He can see
and hear us, even now.
LOKI
How long will it last?
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 53.
FRIGGA
I don't know. This time is
different. We were unprepared.
LOKI
I never get used to seeing him like
this. The most powerful being in
the Nine Realms lying helpless
until his body is restored.
FRIGGA
But he's put it off for so long
now, I fear...
Loki takes her hand. She's grateful, wipes tears from her
eyes.
FRIGGA (CONT'D)
You're a good son.
Loki sits there, uncertain how to react, uncertain how he
really feels.
FRIGGA (CONT'D)
We mustn't lose hope that your
father will return to us. And your
brother.
Loki looks to Frigga, concerned.
LOKI
What hope is there for Thor?
FRIGGA
There's always a purpose to
everything your father does. Thor
may yet find a way home.
Loki looks troubled by the revelation. He rises, heads for
the exit, when they hear the clatter of ARMORED FOOTSTEPS
hurriedly approaching.
THE EINHERJAR GUARD
Enter the room, block his way out. Loki tenses, prepared for
the worst, but the guards just stand before them. Loki is
baffled.
FRIGGA (CONT'D)
Thor is banished. The line of
succession falls to you. Until he
awakens, Asgard is yours.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 53A.
The Einherjar kneel before the shocked Loki. Another
EINHERJAR enters, holding Gungnir before him. He kneels
before Loki, offers the spear to him.
FRIGGA (CONT'D)
Make your father proud.
Loki reaches out tentatively, then takes it. He likes the
feel of it in his hand.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 54.
Thor, Selvig, Darcy, and Jane sit at a table in the local
diner. Selvig and Darcy watch as Thor eats ravenously from a
huge mound of steak and eggs. A couple other full plates --
pancakes and biscuits and gravy -- are piled high before him.
Jane's eager, her notebook at the ready.
JANE
Now tell us exactly what happened
to you last night.
Thor looks her in the eyes, staring, intrigued. Jane gets
flustered, looks away.
JANE (CONT'D)
Maybe start with how you got inside
that cloud.
DARCY
And how you could eat an entire box
of Pop-Tarts and still be this
hungry.
Jane shoots her a withering look. Thor downs a cup of
coffee.
THOR
(re: coffee mug)
This drink. I like it.
DARCY
(to Thor, re: coffee)
Yeah, it's great, isn't it?
Isabela makes the best coffee in
town.
Thor hurls the empty mug at the ground, SHATTERING it.
THOR
(CALLS OUT)
Another!
ISABELA ALVAREZ (60), the diner's proprietor, glares at Thor
from behind the counter.
JANE
Sorry, Izzy. Little accident.
(IN SPANISH)
Yo voy a pagar la taza.
Isabela turns to a WAITRESS and starts venting quickly in
Spanish.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 54A.
ISABELA
(IN SPANISH)
Did you see that? The first time
she brings a man in here, and he's
a lunatic!
JANE
(to Thor, re: mug)
What was that?
He doesn't understand. The other patrons stare at him.
THOR
It was delicious. I want another.
JANE
Then you should just say so!
THOR
I just did.
JANE
I mean ask for it. Nicely.
THOR
I meant no disrespect.
JANE
All right, then no more smashing,
deal?
THOR
You have my word.
JANE
Good.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 55.
A few TOWNIES, looking bedraggled, enter and take a seat at
the counter. We recognize them from the crater. (Among them
is the Drunk Townie Jake, who is not presently drunk.)
ISABELA
Morning, Pete. Jake.
TOWNIE PETE
The usual, please, Izzy.
Isabela pours them a couple cups of coffee.
DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE
You missed all the excitement out
at the crater.
ISABELA
What crater?
Jane and Selvig overhear this, exchange a look, turn to the
Townies with interest.
TOWNIE PETE
They're saying some kind of
satellite crashed in the desert.
DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE
We were having a good time with it
till the Feds showed up, chased us
out.
JANE
(to the Townies)
Excuse me, did you say there was a
satellite crash?
DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE
Yep. They said it was radioactive.
And I had my hands all over it.
(REALIZING)
I'm probably sterile now.
Thor, unconcerned, prepares to dig into the giant pile of
pancakes. Darcy is amazed by the sight.
DARCY
Oh my God, this is going on
Facebook.
Darcy whips out her cellphone.
DARCY (CONT'D)
(TO THOR)
Smile!
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 55A.
Thor looks puzzled as she SNAPS a photo of him and his
massive stack of food.
SELVIG
(to the Townies)
What did the satellite look like?
DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE
I don't know nothing about
satellites. But it was heavy.
Real heavy. Nobody could lift it.
This gets Thor's attention.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 56.
Thor springs to his feet, heads over to Drunk Townie Jake,
and pulls the Townie around to face him.
THOR
Where?!
DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE
About twelve miles east of here.
Thor grins, his spirits soaring, as he quickly strides out of
the diner.
PETE
I wouldn't bother! Looked like the
whole Army was coming in when we
left!
Two EINHERJAR GUARDS enter, admitting Sif and the Warriors
Three, who burst through the entrance, heads bowed.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 59.
SIF
Allfather, we must speak with you
URGENTLY--
But as they raise their heads, they stop short to see --
LOKI
Sitting sprawled upon his father's throne. He wears his
horned ceremonial headdress and holds GUNGNIR in his hand.
Sif and the others look up, shocked at the sight before them.
VOLSTAGG
What is this?
LOKI
My friends... you haven't heard? I
am now Ruler of Asgard.
FANDRAL
Where is Odin?
LOKI
Father's fallen into the Odinsleep.
My mother fears he may never awaken
again.
SIF
We would speak with her.
Sif and the Warriors Three exchange a look. Loki notices.
LOKI
She has refused to leave my
father's bedside. You can bring
your "urgent" matter to me, your
King.
Sif covers quickly.
SIF
We would ask you to end Thor's
banishment.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 60.
LOKI
My first command can not be to undo
the Allfather's last. We're on the
brink of war with Jotunheim. Our
people must have a sense of
continuity in order to feel safe in
these difficult times.
Sif and the Warriors Three trade looks, not liking any of
this.
LOKI (CONT'D)
All of us must stand together, for
the good of Asgard.
FANDRAL
Of course.
Sif and the Warriors Three bow their heads and exit. Loki
stares after them.
Jane, Selvig, and Darcy enter, staring in shock at the now-
empty space.
JANE
Years of research, gone.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 62.
DARCY
They even took my iPod.
SELVIG
And your back-ups?
JANE
Look around! They took our back-
ups. They took the back-ups of our
back-ups.
DARCY
I just downloaded, like, thirty
songs on there.
JANE
(TO DARCY)
Will you please stop talking about
your iPod?!
(TO SELVIG)
Who are these people?
SELVIG
No one knows much about them. But
I knew a scientist -- a pioneer in
gamma radiation. SHIELD showed up,
and he was never heard from again.
JANE
I'm not going to let them do this.
I'm getting everything back.
SELVIG
Please, let me contact one of my
colleagues. Dr. Pym has had some
dealings with these people. I'll e-
mail him and see if he can help.
DARCY
They took your laptop, too.
Annoyed, Selvig thinks.
Thor enters the store and approaches a PET STORE CLERK.
THOR
I need a horse.
PET STORE CLERK
Sorry, we don't sell horses. Just
dogs, cats, birds.
THOR
Then give me one of those, large
enough to ride.
The Pet Store Clerk looks confused.
Just then, Thor hears a CAR HORN. He turns to the open door.
Across the street, Jane calls to him from the Pinzgauer.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 63.
JANE
You still want a lift?
It's story time in the library, as a LIBRARIAN reads a book --
"THE SECRET HISTORY OF GIANTS" -- to a group of kids.
LIBRARIAN
(READING)
"And though they're large, giants
can be quiet. You have to listen
carefully for the sound of their
footsteps -- because they may be
closer than you think."
Nearby, Selvig sits at a computer terminal, finishing up his
e-mail. Beside him, a KID flips through a book with
interest. The Librarian stops mid-story and calls to the Kid
pleasantly.
LIBRARIAN (CONT'D)
Joshua, come sit down. It's story
time.
The Kid closes his book and joins the others. Selvig looks
over, notices the title of the book the Kid was reading --
"MYTHS AND LEGENDS FROM AROUND THE WORLD."
He picks it up, flips through it, stops at the section on
Scandinavian Mythology.
It's a picture of a RAINBOW BRIDGE coming down from Asgard to
earth. ASGARDIANS walk upon it, among them ODIN, LOKI, and
THOR, who wields Mjolnir. On the ground below them, a group
of VIKINGS kneel reverently.
He eyes the illustration, pondering.

Jane drives, pumped with adrenaline, nervous and excited, as
Thor sits beside her, upbeat and eager for battle.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 63A.
JANE
I've never done anything like this
before! Have you ever done
anything like this before?
Thor looks amused by her excitement.
THOR
Many times. You're brave to do it.
JANE
They just stole my entire life's
work. I really don't have anything
left to lose.
THOR
But you're clever. Far more clever
than anyone else in this Realm.
JANE
"This Realm?" Why do you talk like
that?
THOR
You think me strange?
Jane laughs, catches herself.
JANE
Yeah. Just a little.
THOR
Good strange or bad strange?
JANE
I'm not quite sure yet.
She looks at him, sees him staring at her. She's lost in his
gaze, distracted, when the PINZGAUER LURCHES. She quickly
turns her eyes forward, regains control of the car.
JANE (CONT'D)
Sorry.
She glances back at him. He's confident, determined.
JANE (CONT'D)
Who are you? Really?
THOR
You'll see soon enough.
JANE
You promised me answers.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 63B.
Thor looks at her, charmed by her persistence.
THOR
What you seek -- it's a bridge.
JANE
A bridge? Like an Einstein-Rosen
Bridge?
THOR
More like a rainbow bridge.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 64.
A beat.
JANE
God, I hope you're not crazy.
A NEEDLE spikes on a handheld SENSOR DEVICE. The TECHNICIAN
holding it looks over at the hammer. Mjolnir begins to give
off a subtle glow. A bolt of lightning CRACKS across the sky
above.
CUT TO:
73 AN AERIAL INFRARED VIDEO IMAGE OF THE AREA 73
It's fuzzy, doesn't show much. We widen to see we are:
A younger SHIELD agent, a TECHIE in a headset, monitors
security. AGENT SITWELL, humorless, just this side of
junior, looks on, none-too-pleased.
TECHIE
Feed from the keyhole. Can barely
penetrate the cloud cover.
The Techie hikes a thumb at another monitor, SQUELCHING with
static. It shows an SAR shot of the area, laid over a
terrain map.
TECHIE (CONT'D)
Tech's barely working as it is,
with all the interference that
thing's giving off.
He gestures towards the hammer. He checks a computer.
TECHIE (CONT'D)
Hey, we've got a commercial
aircraft coming in right over us,
Southwest Airlines Flight 5434.
SITWELL
Reroute it, like all the others.
TECHIE
Right. Can I get the passengers
some free drinks for the trouble?
Sitwell glares at him.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 65A.
TECHIE (CONT'D)
(SHRUGS)
It'd be a nice gesture.
The Techie types into the computer, when he notices something
on another screen, holds up a hand.
TECHIE (CONT'D)
Hold a sec... we got something
outside the fence, west side...
He points at the screen. Through the haze, it shows a
THERMAL IMAGE huddled beside the fence.
SITWELL
(into a radio)
DeLancey, Jackson -- check it out.
Sitwell talks into his radio, starting to look worried.
SITWELL
(INTO RADIO)
DeLancey, Jackson -- report.
The security monitors SQUELCH with static and interference.
Sitwell holds his PDA -- even it's on the fritz. Sitwell and
the Techie watch the monitors warily.
On the monitor showing the hammer containment area, Mjolnir
starts to crackle with energy.
SITWELL
(to the Techie)
Get Coulson.
Sitwell punches an alarm.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 66A.
Thor races up the entrance ramp. Before him, two GUARDS
round the corner.
Thor knocks out the first Guard, then tackles the second. He
hurries around the corner, when more GUARDS come up a ladder
ahead. Thor punches the closest Guard, sending him tumbling
backwards, toppling the others on the ladder behind him.
Thor takes off running, as the Guards regroup and give chase.
Thor spots the glow of Mjolnir in the central cube, through
the translucent walls of the tunnels. He hurries through to
tunnels to find a way towards it.
A SNIPER, dressed in black tactical gear and high-tech
NIGHTVISION EQUIPMENT, picks up a rifle, slings it over his
shoulder and heads out.
His name is BARTON.
As Thor races through the tunnel, a GUARD runs right at him,
on a collision course. Thor takes him out with a punch to
the gut, then turns to see more AGENTS coming towards him.
Thor picks up the fallen Guard he punched, then throws him
into the approaching Agents, scattering them.
Thor turns around, runs back the way he came. The Agents
give chase.
Coulson enters the tunnels through the command trailer. He
calls on his radio.
COULSON
Barton. Talk to me.

Thor races through the tunnel, comes across a wall of AGENTS.
Thor ROARS and barrels through them -- elbowing, punching --
whatever it takes to keep moving.
As he takes down the last Agent, Thor sees the last junction
box and the entrance to the cube structure up ahead.
He races towards it. He can actually see Mjolnir within the
middle of the structure, when -- BAM! From out of nowhere, a
fist lands a powerful blow across his jaw, sending him
reeling. Dazed, Thor looks up to see --
A HUGE SHIELD AGENT
The biggest of them all, standing between him and his hammer
in the cube structure beyond. Thor sizes him up.
THOR
You're big.
Thor grins.
THOR (CONT'D)
Fought bigger.
Coulson hurries through the tunnel, ready to give the word to
Barton, when he stops short. He sees what looks like an
electrical storm erupting inside the structure ahead,
directly above the crater... and the hammer.
From outside, Thor rips an opening in the plastic wall of the
structure.
He stands there -- soaking, bleeding, caked with wet earth.
His hammer rests just a few yards before him, energy surging
around it.
Coulson steps into the structure through an access tunnel,
one story up.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 68B.
As Thor approaches his hammer, Mjolnir starts to glow
brighter, blue electricity sparking off its surface. The
crackling energy seems to reach out to him. Coulson notices,
his interest piqued.
Above the open ceiling of the structure, Barton's crane
bucket comes into view.
Thor stands next to the hammer, feels its power. He reaches
out to it confidently.
Coulson watches from above. Armed AGENTS approach behind
him. He motions for them to hold their positions, then
radios Barton.
COULSON
Barton...
Coulson watches Thor with anticipation as Thor wraps his hand
around the hammer. He smiles, triumphant, lifts... but the
hammer doesn't move.
Thor looks confused, tries again with two hands, to no avail
-- anger and frustration overtaking him. He strains with all
his might, SCREAMS from the effort, bellowing up at the storm
and lightning above him.
Something begins to appear on the side of Mjolnir -- glowing
RUNES. Thor looks down, sees them.
But, still, the hammer doesn't budge. Thor falls to his
knees before it, rain pouring down around him, as the glowing
runes fade away. He's failed. Unworthy.
Coulson looks on, disappointed.
SHIELD AGENTS move in, guns trained on Thor, surrounding him.
Coulson activates his radio.
COULSON
Ground units, move in. Show's
over.
As the Agents surround him, Thor doesn't seem to notice or
care. He just sits there on his knees, head bowed in the
rain -- a man broken, lost.
From overhead, we see the hammer in the cube containment
room. We pull up as the Guards approach Thor, then continue
to climb, until we see the whole camp -- and the extensive
damage Thor's done to it during the melee.
85 OMITTED 85
Jane stands with Selvig and Darcy in the empty lab.
Darcy picks up the book Selvig checked out of the library,
looks through it.
JANE
I can't just leave him there.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 70.
SELVIG
Why not?
JANE
You didn't see what happened.
Darcy points at an illustration of Thor's hammer in the book.
DARCY
Hey! Myeu-muh!
Jane looks at the illustration in the book, turns to Selvig
knowingly.
JANE
(RE: BOOK)
Where did you find this?
Selvig grabs the book from them, quickly closes it.
SELVIG
In the children's section. I
wanted to show you how ridiculous
his story was.
Jane is unconvinced by this. She knows he wants to believe.
JANE
Aren't you the one who's always
told me to chase down all leads,
all possibilities?
SELVIG
I was talking about science, not
magic!
JANE
Magic's just science we don't
understand yet. Arthur C. Clarke.
SELVIG
Who wrote science fiction.
JANE
The precursor of science fact.
SELVIG
In some cases.
JANE
If that's really an Einstein-Rosen
Bridge out there, then there's
something on the other side.

4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 70A.
JANE (CONT'D)
Advanced beings could have come

SELVIG
Jane...
DARCY
A primitive culture like the
Vikings might have worshipped them
as deities.
They give her a look, surprised by her unexpectedly
insightful input. Darcy shrugs. Jane points at her,
grateful for the support.
JANE
Yes! Exactly! Thank you!
Darcy beams.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 71.
SELVIG
Jane, if you do this, you'll find
yourself in a situation that I
won't be able to get you out of
this time.
DARCY
I'll help you.
Jane looks grateful. Selvig looks at her, sees there's no
stopping her. He sighs.
Thor sits in a chair, staring forward blankly, hands cuffed
behind him. Coulson stands across from him.
COULSON
It's not easy to do what you did.
You made us all look like a bunch
of mall cops. That's hurtful.
(THEN)
The men you so easily subdued are
highly-trained professionals, and
in my experience, it takes someone
who's received similar training to
do what you did to them. Would you
like to tell me where you received
your training?
Thor sits silently.
COULSON (CONT'D)
Pakistan? Chechnya? Afghanistan?
Then again, you strike me more as
the soldier of fortune type. What
was it, South Africa?
Still no answer. Coulson leans in close to him.
COULSON (CONT'D)
Certain groups pay well for a good
mercenary. Especially HYDRA.
Coulson waits for a response, but gets none.
COULSON (CONT'D)
Who are you?
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 72.
THOR
Just a man.
COULSON
One way or another, we find out
what we want to know. We're good
at that.
Coulson leaves the room. Thor lowers his head.
LOKI (O.S.)
I thought he'd never leave.
Thor looks up, shocked to find Loki standing there, dressed
in 21st century attire.
THOR
Loki? What are you doing here?
LOKI
I had to see you.
THOR
What's happened? Tell me! Is it
Jotunheim? Let me explain to
FATHER--
LOKI
Father is dead.
Thor stares at him, stunned.
THOR
What?
LOKI
Your banishment, the threat of a
new war, it was too much for him to
bear.
The implications of Loki's words dawn on Thor -- he's
responsible for his father's fate. Loki draws close to him,
looks in his eyes, consolingly.
LOKI (CONT'D)
You mustn't blame yourself. I know
that you loved him. I tried to
tell him so, but he wouldn't
listen.
(MORE)
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 73.
LOKI (CONT'D)

It was cruel to put the hammer

could never lift it.
Thor stares ahead, falling deeper into the abyss.
LOKI (CONT'D)
The burden of the throne has fallen
to me now.
THOR
Can I come home?
LOKI
The truce with Jotunheim is
conditional upon your exile.
THOR
But couldn't we find a way to--
LOKI
Mother has forbidden your return.
Thor nods, lowers his head, beaten.
LOKI (CONT'D)
This is goodbye, brother. I'm so
sorry.
THOR
No, I'm sorry. Loki... thank you
for coming here.
LOKI
Nothing could have stopped me.
Coulson enters the room, but seems to take no notice of Loki.
LOKI (CONT'D)
Fare well, brother.
THOR
Good-bye.
COULSON
Good-bye? I just got back.
Thor looks up to see that Loki is gone.
COULSON (CONT'D)
Now. Where did we leave off?
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 73A.
Sitwell enters and speaks sotto to Coulson.
SITWELL
(RE: THOR)
Sir... he's got a visitor.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 74.
Coulson and several other SHIELD AGENTS stand across from
Erik Selvig.
COULSON
"Donald Blake?"
SELVIG
Doctor Donald Blake. He's part of
our team.
COULSON
You have dangerous coworkers, Dr.
Selvig.
SELVIG
Troubled, not dangerous. He was
distraught when he found out that
you'd taken all of our research.
It was years of his life, gone! He
got depressed, started drinking,
and... well, you know the rest.
COULSON
Uh-huh. You mind if we take a
moment to verify his identity?
SELVIG
Certainly.
The Techie at a computer nearby runs the name.
SELVIG (CONT'D)
You can understand how a man could
go off like that. I mean, a big,
faceless organization like yours,
coming in with their jack-booted
thugs and stealing private
property...
(THEN)
...is how he described it.
COULSON
That doesn't explain how he managed
to tear through our security.
Selvig shrugs.
SELVIG
Steroids. He's a bit of a fitness
nut.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 74A.
On the Techie's monitor, a DMV record from the State of New
York pops up reading "DR. DONALD BLAKE". The license photo
is indeed a picture of Thor -- the one Darcy took with her
cellphone.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 75.
The Techie hits a button, and a graphic reads, "SHIELD
SECURITY ANALYSIS IN PROGRESS." Coulson eyes the screen.
After a beat, he turns back to Selvig.
COULSON
It says here he's an M.D.
SELVIG
He is. That is, he was. He
switched careers and became a
physicist. He's quite brilliant,
really.
(THEN)
If you would just release him to
me, I promise to keep an eye on
him.
Coulson thinks, sizing Selvig up -- then smiles. He turns to
an AGENT nearby.
COULSON
Release Dr. Blake to Dr. Selvig
here.
The Techie looks to him, surprised.
COULSON (CONT'D)
(TO SELVIG)
Make sure he stays in town for the
next few days in case we need to
talk to him again.
Selvig shakes his hand.
SELVIG
Thank you.
Selvig bursts into the room with a SHIELD Agent to find a
seated Thor.
SELVIG
Donny, Donny, Donny! There you
are!
Thor looks up, unsure what the hell is going on. Selvig
pulls Thor to his feet, gives him a warm hug.
SELVIG (CONT'D)
It's going to be all right, my
friend. Come on, I'm taking you
home.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 75A.
He leads the bewildered Thor out the door.
Coulson looks at the computer bearing Donald Blake's DMV
record. A security warning over the image clearly reads
"SECURITY ALERT: FALSIFIED DATA." He knows it's been a ruse
all along.
He looks to Selvig and Thor heading away from the Security
Room, then follows them outside.
Darkness shrouds the ruined temple, save for the shafts of
light which knife their way in through the damaged ceiling.
Loki enters. Frost Giant guards surround him on all sides.
Laufey approaches, towers over him menacingly.
LAUFEY
Tell me why I shouldn't kill you.
LOKI
I've come alone and unarmed.
LAUFEY
To what end?
LOKI
To make you another proposition.
LAUFEY
(REALIZING)
So you're the one who let us into
Asgard.
LOKI
You're welcome.
LAUFEY
My men are dead, and I have no
Casket. You are a deceiver.
Laufey lashes out, grabs Loki around the throat, but Loki
calmly stands his ground.
LOKI
You have no idea what I am.
The blueness spreads across his face, as Laufey and the
guards stare in shock. Loki grins.
LOKI (CONT'D)
Hello, Father.
Laufey releases him. Loki's body turns back to normal.
Intrigued, Laufey sizes up his son.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 76A.
LAUFEY
Ah, the bastard son. I thought
Odin had killed you. That's what I
would have done. He's as weak as
you are.
LOKI
No longer weak. I now rule Asgard,
until Odin awakens. Perhaps you
should not have so carelessly
abandoned me.
This gives Laufey pause.
LAUFEY
Or perhaps it was the wisest choice
I've ever made. I will hear you.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 77.
LOKI
I will conceal you and a handful of
your soldiers, lead you into his
chambers, and let you slay him
where he lies. I'll keep the
throne, and you will have the
Casket.
Laufey studies Loki's face.
LAUFEY
Why would you do this?
LOKI
When all is done, we will have a
permanent peace between our two
worlds. Then I, the bastard son,
will have accomplished what Odin
and Thor never could.
LAUFEY
This is a great day for Jotunheim.
Asgard is finally ours.
LOKI
No. Asgard is mine. The rest of
the Nine Realms will be yours, if
you do as you're told.
Laufey considers the proposition.
LAUFEY
I accept.
Loki turns to leave. As he goes, the slightest trace of a
smile crosses his face.
Loki emerges out of the Bifrost, as Heimdall steps away from
his controls. Heimdall glares at Loki. Loki notices.
LOKI
What troubles you, Gatekeeper?
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 78.
HEIMDALL
I turned my gaze upon you in
Jotunheim, but could neither see
nor hear you. You were shrouded
from me, like the Frost Giants who
entered this Realm.
LOKI
Perhaps your senses have weakened
after your many years of service.
HEIMDALL
Or perhaps someone has found a way
to hide that which he does not wish
me to see.
Loki sizes him up, smiles.
LOKI
You have great power, Heimdall.
Tell me, did Odin ever fear you?
HEIMDALL
No.
LOKI
And why is that?
HEIMDALL
Because he is my King, and I am
sworn to obey him.
LOKI
Exactly. Just as you're sworn to
obey me now. Yes?
A beat.
HEIMDALL
Yes.
LOKI
Good. Then you will open the
Bifrost to no one until I have
undone what my brother has started.
Loki heads out of the Observatory. Heimdall stares after
him.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 78A.
Thor and Selvig sit at a booth at the back of the local dive.
The bartender sets down a couple mugs of beer and two shots
of whiskey. Selvig pours the shot into his mug and downs it.
Thor follows his example.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 79.
SELVIG
Seems Darcy's a terrible intern,
but a talented hacker.
THOR
Thank you for what you've done.
SELVIG
Don't thank me. I only did it for
Jane.
THOR
Are you in love with her?
SELVIG
Of course not! Jane's like a
daughter to me. Her father and I
taught at University together. A
good man, but he never listened.
This registers with Thor.
THOR
Neither did I.
Selvig eyes him with interest.
SELVIG
I don't know if you're really
delusional, and I really don't care
at this point. I just care about
her. I've seen the way she looks
at you.
THOR
I swear to you, I mean her no harm.
SELVIG
Good. If that's the case, then
I'll buy you one more drink, and
you'll leave town tonight.
A long pause, then Thor nods. He takes a drink.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 80.
THOR
I had it all backwards. I had it
all wrong.
Selvig watches him keenly. This is a different Thor than
he's seen before.
SELVIG
It's not a bad thing, finding out
that you don't have all the
answers. That's when you start
asking the right questions.
Thor takes this in.
THOR
For the first time in my life, I
have no idea what I'm supposed to
do.
SELVIG
Anyone who's ever going to find
their way in this world has to
start by admitting they don't know
where the hell they are.
Thor nods.
DRUNK TOWNIE (O.S.)
Hey, I know you, man...
An intimidating DRUNK TOWNIE nearby sizes up Thor. He is one
of the Townies from Isabela's Diner who saw Thor earlier. He
approaches, belligerent and looking for a fight.
DRUNK TOWNIE (CONT'D)
You were in the diner with that hot
girl.
Thor doesn't like where this is going.
DRUNK TOWNIE (CONT'D)
I wouldn't mind her doing a little
research on me.
He laughs. Thor is annoyed.
THOR
I have no quarrel with you. But
she's a lady. You should be more
respectful.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 80A.
DRUNK TOWNIE
And you should shut the hell up,
princess.
Selvig looks to Thor, concerned that he's going to lose it.
But, to his surprise, Thor remains unaffected by the Townie's
baiting.
THOR
I will not fight him.
DRUNK TOWNIE
Then it'll be easy to kick your
ass.
Selvig stands, steps between the two men.
SELVIG
Gentlemen, please. Let's keep our
heads.
Just then, Selvig HEAD-BUTTS the Townie, knocking him out.
Thor's impressed. Selvig downs his drink, then hurls his
glass aside, SHATTERING it on the ground.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 81.
SELVIG (CONT'D)
(TO THOR)
Another drink?
The small trailer is in a state of perpetual disarray, strewn
with various books, old pizza boxes, etc. A worried Jane
lies on her bed, trying to read.
She's startled by the loud RAPPING on the door. She bolts to
the door and opens it to find --
THOR
Standing there with the unconscious Selvig slung over his
shoulder.
JANE
Erik!
(TO THOR)
Is he all right?
THOR
He's fine. Not injured at all.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 81A.
As Thor enters, he BANGS Selvig's head on the doorway.
Selvig GROANS.
THOR (CONT'D)
Sorry, my friend.
JANE
What happened?
THOR
We drank. We fought. He made his
ancestors proud.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 82.
JANE
Put him on the bed.
Thor moves through the small trailer carrying Selvig, like a
bear lugging another bear, smashing into things along the
way, until he finally sets Selvig down on Jane's bed. Selvig
awakens groggily and looks up at him through bleary eyes.
SELVIG
I still don't believe you're the
God of Thunder.
(THEN)
But you ought to be.
Thor grins, pats him on the cheek. As Selvig drifts off to
sleep, Thor pulls a blanket over him.
Jane watches, stunned by their friendship, impressed by
Thor's tenderness. Thor turns back to her, looks around.
THOR
These are your chambers?
Jane suddenly becomes self-conscious. She starts cleaning up
the mess around her.
JANE
Well, it's more of a temporary
living space, really. I don't
usually have visitors in here.
Actually, never...
Thor picks up a sock off the floor. She snatches it from
him, puts it away.
JANE (CONT'D)
Can we go outside?
Volstagg eats ravenously from a PLATTER OF FOOD. Sif stands
nearby, ill at ease. Fandral watches Volstagg incredulously
as the large warrior stuffs himself. Finally Fandral can
stand it no more.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 84.
FANDRAL
Our dearest friend banished, Loki
on the throne, Asgard on the brink
of war, yet you manage to consume
four wild boar, six pheasant, a
side of beef, and two casks of ale.
Shame on you! Don't you care?!
Fandral moves to throw the platter in the fire, but Volstagg
pulls his weapon, stopping him.
VOLSTAGG
Do not mistake my appetite for
apathy.
SIF
Stop it, both of you! We all know
what we have to do, we're just too
damned afraid to do it!
HOGUN
(DECIDES)
We must go. We must find Thor.
Hogun starts to pull the delicate HEALING STONES from the
fire, carefully putting them into a POUCH at his side.
FANDRAL
It's treason, Hogun.
VOLSTAGG
To hell with treason, it's suicide.
(SUDDENLY NERVOUS)
Now, shh! Heimdall may be
watching! It's said he can hear--
FANDRAL
Yes, yes, we know!
SIF
Thor would do the same for us.
An EINHERJAR GUARD enters. They tense.
EINHERJAR GUARD
Heimdall demands your presence.
Volstagg quickly drains his flagon of ale.
VOLSTAGG
We're doomed.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 84A.
Darcy and Selvig sit at a card table, drinking coffee. Thor
holds a couple plates as Jane makes eggs on a hotplate. She
scoops them out onto the plates. Thor takes them over to the
table, sets them down before Selvig and Darcy.
DARCY
Thanks.
THOR
You're very welcome.
Jane joins them at the card table with a couple more plates.
She and Thor sit with the others and start to eat their
breakfast, looking like a little family.
106 OMITTED 106
107 OMITTED 107
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 86.
As the group finishes breakfast, Thor looks at the mug in his
hand, gets an idea.
THOR
(RE: MUG)
May I have this?
DARCY
Sure.
THOR
Thank you. Excuse me a moment.
Thor leaves.
Sif and the Warriors Three enter warily to find the
intimidating Heimdall standing before the Observatory's
controls. He glares at them accusingly.
VOLSTAGG
Good Heimdall, less us explain--
HEIMDALL
You would defy the commands of Loki
our King, break every oath you have
taken as warriors, and commit
treason to bring Thor back?
The four exchange nervous glances.
SIF
Yes, but--
HEIMDALL
Good.
The group looks puzzled. What did he just say?
VOLSTAGG
So you'll help us?
HEIMDALL
I am bound by honor to our King. I
cannot open the Bifrost to you.
With that, Heimdall leaves them alone in the Observatory.
The others exchange puzzled looks.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 86B.
FANDRAL
Complicated fellow, isn't he?
VOLSTAGG
Now what do we do?
Sif glances at the control panel, notices something.
SIF
Look!
The others turn to see HEIMDALL'S SWORD stuck into the
control panel. They exchange a grin. They have an ally.
Sif hits the controls, and the Bifrost apparatus fires up.
Coulson races in as a SHIELD TECHIE calls up satellite
footage of the Bifrost storm on a monitor.
COULSON
What the hell was that?
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 87.
TECHIE
I don't know, sir. We got massive
energy readings out of nowhere,
then they just disappeared.
Fifteen miles due northwest.
COULSON
Let's go take a look.
Loki inserts Gungnir into the Observatory's control panel and
opens the Bifrost. He gestures, and the veiled DESTROYER
appears before him, a fiery glow rising within it. It turns
its head toward its King.
LOKI
Ensure my brother does not return.
Jane, Thor, Darcy, and Selvig make a charming team, tidying
up after breakfast -- washing, drying, and putting plates and
utensils away.
The door opens.
VOLSTAGG (O.S.)
Found you!
Thor, Jane, Selvig, and Darcy turn to see --
SIF AND THE WARRIORS THREE
Staring baffled at the sight of the domestic Thor drying
dishes in mortal clothing.
Jane drops a plate. It goes SHATTERING on the floor.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 90A.
THOR
My friends!
Thor happily races over and greets his comrades.
Jane, Selvig, and Darcy watch the Asgardians from across the
room. Jane looks concerned. Selvig and Darcy eye them with
wonder.
SELVIG
I don't believe it...
DARCY
Who are they?
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 91.
VOLSTAGG
Lady Sif and the Warriors Three.
Surely you've heard tales of Hogun
the Grim, Fandral the Dashing, and
I, Volstagg the Svelte?
Selvig looks pointedly at Volstagg's massive gut.
VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
Well, perhaps I've put on a little
more muscle since I was here last.
JANE
That would have been a thousand
years ago? Northern Europe?
VOLSTAGG
Exactly! Those lovely herring
people. They worshipped us!
Thor grins, lays a hand on Volstagg's shoulder.
THOR
My friends, I've never been happier
to see anyone. But you should not
have come.
FANDRAL
We're here to take you home.
Jane reacts to the news of Thor leaving.
THOR
You know I can't. My father is
dead because of me. I must remain
in exile.
The other Asgardians exchange puzzled looks.
SIF
Thor... your father still lives.
Thor reacts to the revelation.
Thor and the others see the Bifrost storm forming in the
distance.
DARCY
Was somebody else coming?
Just then, the Bifrost funnel EXPLODES down to the ground.
Laufey and two Frost Giants appear out of the Bifrost and
step onto the platform. Loki is waiting for them. He pulls
Gungnir from the Observatory's control panel. The giant
apparatus slows to a stop.
LOKI
Father. Welcome to Asgard.
Odin lies in the Odinsleep.
A single tear rolls down the Allfather's cheek.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 100.
The Asgardians emerge from the Bifrost to find Heimdall
slumped over his controls.
THOR
(to the others)
Get him to the healing room! Leave
my brother to me.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 104.
Thor bolts out the door.
Odin lies in the Odinsleep, Frigga at his bedside. She hears
the SHOUTS of Guards outside, the sound of a battle. Frigga
grabs a sword.
A Frost Giant bursts in. She swings the sword around hard,
cleaving into his shoulder. He swats her aside angrily.
Laufey and the Brute Frost Giant enter.
Laufey looks at Odin lying helpless on the bed.
The Jotun king stands over the unconscious Odin, relishing
the moment.
He forms an ICE BLADE.
Laufey stands before the sleeping Odin.
LAUFEY
It's said you can still see and
hear what transpires around you,
even in this state. I hope it's
true, so that you may know your
death came by the hand of Laufey.
He raises his blade above Odin's body, when --
A BLAST OF ENERGY
Hits him from behind. As the Jotun king falls to the ground,
we see it is not Thor standing behind him, but Loki, holding
Gungnir.
LOKI
And your death came by the son of
Odin.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 104A.
Laufey dies as the other two shocked Frost Giants move for
Loki. He fires Gungnir at one, blasting him against a wall,
taking him out.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 105.
The Brute is nearly upon him, when the Jotun stops suddenly,
his eyes going wide. The Brute falls to the ground,
REVEALING --
FRIGGA
Standing behind him -- the sword stuck in his back. She
looks to Loki, takes him in her arms.
LOKI (CONT'D)
I swear to you, mother, they will
pay for what they've done today. I
will end the Jotun threat, now and
forever!
He looks to Odin.
LOKI (CONT'D)
And I will make you proud.
Loki savors the moment, but it's short-lived, as Thor bursts
in. He's thrown by the scene before him -- Odin safe, Laufey
and two Jotuns dead, Frigga regarding Loki with pride and
respect. Stunned and delighted to see Thor, Frigga beams.
FRIGGA
Thor!
She moves to Thor and hugs him, but Thor's eyes remain fixed
on his brother. Loki looks at Mjolnir in his brother's hand.
LOKI
Found its way back to you, did it?
THOR
No thanks to you.
Frigga picks up on the tension building between her sons.
FRIGGA
What?
THOR
Why don't you tell her? How you
sent the Destroyer to kill our
friends? To kill me?
Frigga looks to Loki, alarmed and confused.
LOKI
It must have been enforcing
Father's last command.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 106.
THOR
You're a talented liar, brother.
Always have been.
LOKI
(SMILES)
It's good to have you back.
(DEAD SERIOUS)
Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to
destroy Jotunheim.
Loki suddenly raises Gungnir, FIRES it point-blank at Thor.
Thor goes flying backwards, SMASHING through the chamber
walls, into...
Thor flies from the blast through ANOTHER wall on the
opposite side of the corridor, to...
Loki operates the Observatory's controls. The massive turret
spins, points.
Thor enters, shields his eyes from the brilliant light of the
Bifrost energy blasting towards Jotunheim.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 106A.
He looks over to the controls, sees that they're frozen in an
enormous block of ice. Loki stands atop it.
LOKI
All these years, and no one's ever
dared to use it as a weapon.
Thor hurries to the ice, raises his hammer to SMASH through
it to get to the controls frozen within. Before he can, Loki
fires Gungnir. The blast hits the ice in front of Thor,
blasting him back across the floor. Loki steps down from the
ice as Thor staggers to his feet.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 107.
LOKI (CONT'D)
You can't stop it. The Bifrost
will build until it rips Jotunheim
apart.
THOR
Why have you done this?
LOKI
To do what Father never could. To
destroy their kind forever. When
he awakens, he'll see the wisdom of
what I've done.
THOR
He won't! You can't kill an entire
race!
LOKI
What is this newfound love for the
Frost Giants? You, who would have
killed them all with your bare
hands.
THOR
I've changed.
LOKI
So have I.
Loki hits Thor across the face with Gungnir.
LOKI (CONT'D)
Fight me.
He swings Gungnir at Thor again. Thor catches it in his
hand, rears back his hammer as if ready to return the blow,
but instead takes to the air and flies past Loki, back
towards the frozen controls.
Loki spins around, aims Gungnir, and fires a blast which
immobilizes Thor in the air. He hangs there, suspended.
THOR
Is the throne really worth what
you've done? What you would
become?
LOKI
I never wanted the throne. I only
wanted to be your equal. Now fight
me!
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 108.
With a gesture of Gungnir, he flings Thor to the ground.
Thor rises to his feet, turns to Loki.
THOR
I will not fight you, brother.
LOKI
I am not your brother. I never
was.
THOR
Loki, this is madness...
Loki grins.
LOKI
Is it?
He FIRES Gungnir at Thor. Thor dodges the blast, rolls to
his feet.
LOKI (CONT'D)
What happened to you on earth that
turned you so soft? Don't tell me
it was a woman.
Thor doesn't answer. Loki laughs, realizing he's right.
LOKI (CONT'D)
It was. Perhaps when we're
finished here I'll pay her a little
visit myself.
That did it. Loki and Thor rush at each other. They and
their weapons collide.
The two battle -- Loki unleashing years of pent-up rage and
jealousy, Thor having no choice but to defend himself.
Thor and Loki battle savagely. Loki fires Gungnir, sending
Thor sliding across the floor and knocking Mjolnir from his
hand.
The hammer flies into the Bifrost towards Jotunheim.
Thor raises his hand towards his hammer, tries to summon it
back to him, to keep it in this Realm, but the Bifrost is too
powerful.
Mjolnir disappears into the maelstrom as Thor himself slides
towards the Bifrost.
LOKI
If you care so much for the Jotuns,
then die with them.
The Bifrost stretches every cell of Thor's body, trying to
drag him away. He's nearly swallowed by the vortex, when he
concentrates, mustering his will. He reaches out his hand
towards the Bifrost.
MJOLNIR flies back through the maelstrom, into Thor's hand.
The hammer pulls him free. Loki tries to fire off another
blast at him, but Thor takes to the air, speeds towards his
brother.
A FEAST is in progress as Thor, Sif, and the Warriors Three
sit amongst the gathered Asgardians. Hogun sits between
Fandral and Volstagg, who is in the middle of recounting
their battle with the Destroyer.
VOLSTAGG
...and then, with a mighty bellow,
I flew at the great metal beast and
laid it low...
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 113.
FANDRAL
Is that another way of saying you
fell on your huge a--
VOLSTAGG
As a matter of fact, falling down
was a tactic. Lulling the
Destroyer into a false sense of
security!
FANDRAL
Well, I was the one who had to drag
your enormous carcass off the
battlefield. That makes me the
real hero. Doesn't it, Hogun?
Hogun points to Volstagg.
HOGUN
Big stomach.
(points to Fandral)
Big mouth.
The other gathered Asgardians laugh. Volstagg and Fandral
look to Hogun. The grim warrior gives just a trace of a
smile.
FANDRAL
Well, how about that? A smile!
I'd say that calls for another
drink!
They laugh and raise another round.
Frigga sits nearby, lost in thought, her face betraying the
sadness she struggles to conceal. Sif notices, approaches
Frigga, bows her head.
SIF
My Queen. I am so sorry for your
loss.
Frigga takes Sif's hand appreciatively.
FRIGGA
Thank you, Sif.
She looks to Thor, who's unable to enjoy the merriment around
him.
FRIGGA (CONT'D)
How is he?
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 113A.
SIF
He mourns for his brother. And he
misses her. The mortal.
Frigga sees the trace of regret in Sif's face as she looks at
Thor with new feelings. He rises and leaves the hall.
FRIGGA
He will need his friends now more
than ever.
SIF
I will always be at his side.
Frigga understands, puts her arm around Sif gratefully.
