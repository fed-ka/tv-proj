      The guys sit at their shared cubicle.  We cut to each of them 
      as they perform their respective sales calls.

                    Yeah.  I know.  I m freaking out

                    the road for 5 months after 
                    college, I was high, high, high,

                    what s goin  on out there, but I 
                      twelve-stepped that crap right out 
                    of my life.  Speaking of losers, 
                    just wait until you meet the nerd 
                    that they sent over from West Coast 
                    Testing.

      Just then, ROBBIE, the pee tester, enters.  He s pushing a 
      cart full of urine testing equipment.  Alice feigns 
      politeness to be professional.

                    OK.  I m just gonna run some tests 
                    on it, and it s important that you 
                    drink a lot of fluids.  And, it s 
                    just a drug test.  Nothing to be

                    of yourself.  Ooh mama.  I m gonna

      Robbie slowly backs away.

                    See you in a little bit, boys.

                    Bear with me here.  I thought about 
                    this last night.

      Anders climbs up onto his chair and reaches up to the 
      ceiling.  He rips two large chunks from the ceiling tile and 
      hands them to the guys.

                                  ANDERS (CONT'D)
                    Eat this.

                                  ADAM
                    No.  Ugh.  Are you serious, dude? 
                    That is straight danger.

      Blake reaches for the tile.

                                  BLAKE
                    Gimme the damn tile.

      Anders hands them each the tiles.

                                  ADAM
                    Fine.  But your dick is so tan 
                    looking.  It s bizarre.

      Adam takes a bite out of the tile and makes a face like he s 
      about to puke.

                                  ANDERS
                    Whoa!

      Anders turns to Blake, who s pouring a packet of BBQ sauce 
      onto the tile.

                                  ANDERS (CONT'D)
                    Enjoy that.  Better get some Arby-Q 
                    sauce on that, dude.

      Blake takes a bite and is equally sickened.  He and Adam 
      begin choking and making puke sounds.

                                  BLAKE
                    It s cutting my mouth.

                    You re not a cool dude.  Because 
                    there is fiberglass in here.

                                  BLAKE
                    It s so dry!

                                  ADAM
                    How much do we have to eat?

                                  ANDERS
                    Alright, alright.  OK champs.  I 
                    think you ve had enough.

      Blake and Adam spit the rest of the tile into their desks.

                                  ANDERS (CONT'D)
                    Why don t we wash it down.

      Anders hands them the two cups he took out of his cooler.

                                  BLAKE
                    That s piss.  We re not drinking 
                    piss.

                                  ANDERS
                    It s not pee, it s Gatorade.  
                    That s what happens when you mess 
                    with the mastermind of pranks.

      Adam sips his Gatorade.

                                  ADAM
                    Wow.  OK.

                                  ANDERS
                    You pull a prank on me, you get 
                    pranked back.

      Anders pulls another plastic cup of liquid out of the cooler.

                                  ANDERS (CONT'D)
                    This is real piss.  And it s all 
                    mine.  It s all...

      Adam JUMPS up from his seat and HITS the cup out of Anders  
      hand, getting it on Anders  face and shirt.

                                  ADAM
                    ...Over your face! 

      Anders is stunned, then launches to his feet.  Toe to toe 
      with Adam...

                    Adam, I had enough pee for all 
                    three of us.  I was gonna run the 
                    joke a little longer and then split 
                    it up.  But, now it s gone and a 
                    little bit in my mouth.

                    Why didn t you say something, dude?

                                  ANDERS
                    I didn t say anything because I was 
                    trying to be cool and dramatic.  
                    Which you would know nothing about.

                                  ADAM
                    Oh OK, Anders.  I wouldn t know 
                    about being cool and dramatic? 
                    Who s saving up to buy a

      Suddenly Robbie pops his head into their cubicle.

      Adam examines the bottle of niacin as Anders drives.  He 
      dumps pills into his hand.

                    It says to take two for results in 
                    eight hours, that means take eight

      Adam passes pills to Blake, who immediately swallows them.

      He downs a handful of pills as they pull up to the office 
      parking lot.

                                  BLAKE

      Anders slams his hands on the steering wheel.

                    I had clean piss, OK?  I had it!

                    Maybe we could find somebody to 
                    give us piss.

                                  ADAM
                    How are we supposed to find clean 
                    piss when everyone over the age of 
                    twelve smokes weed these days?

      A lightbulb goes off for all three of them.


      The guys burst into the front door.  Karl sits on their couch 
      as before and smokes a joint.  The guys race past him.

      QUICK CUTS: The guys search frantically through stuff in 
      their bedrooms.  They grab whatever contraband they can find.


      The guys race out the door, passing Karl again.  As they 
      pass, Karl holds out his joint.  Anders and Adam ignore him, 
      but Blake stops.

                                  BLAKE
                      Definitely.

      He takes a hit from the joint then hands it back to Karl.

                    Shit!

      Blake runs out the door.  Karl drops the joint on his hand, 
      burning himself.

      Adam holds a tiny bit of liquid in his hand.

                                  ANDERS
                    Dude, you got some pee, right?  You

                    Oh yeah.

      Anders hands Adam an empty beer bottle from next to his seat.

                                  ANDERS
                    Alright, here.  Here, just put it

                                  BLAKE
                    It s not enough!  None of it s 
                    enough.

      Adam stares at the pee in one hand and the bottle in the 
      other.

                                  ADAM
                    You re right.

      Adam tosses the pee out the window, but it flies back into 
      his face.

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                    Karma is for real.

                    Maybe we deserve this.  We ve been

      The guys sit quietly, defeated.

      Anders and Adam finish phone calls.  Blake s chair is empty.

                    Almost had him.  That was pretty 
                    good.

      Blake returns to the cubicle with Robbie close behind.

                                  ROBBIE
                    OK, boys.  He s awesome at peeing.  
                    Let s see how you do.

      Blake sits, defeated.  As Adam and Anders stand to follow 
      Robbie out of the cubicle, Blake looks at the ceiling and 
      gets an idea.

                                  BLAKE
                    Wait.

      Adam and Anders turn back to face Blake, who starts downing 
      the BIG GULP that was sitting on his desk.

                                  BLAKE (CONT D)

      Blake spins in his chair, on the phone with Jillian.

      Blake removes a ceiling tile and climbs up into the ceiling.


      Robbie pushes Adam and Anders past the door to the Break 
      Room.

                                  ADAM

      They walk toward the water cooler.

                    Don t try anything.


      Blake army-crawls, holding a LIGHTER a la Die Hard.

                    together, smoke a few blunts.


      Robbie continues to push Adam and Anders through the 
      building.  Jillian waits around a corner as they approach, 
      then jumps out in front of them.

                                    JILLIAN

      Blake crawls through the ceiling.  He lifts a ceiling tile 
      and looks into a room below.  The piss cart!


      Adam and Anders grab pee cups and walk toward the urinals.

                                  ROBBIE
                    Don t pee on the cup intentionally.

                    That s it, boys.  Just like your 
                    mama taught you.


      Blake hangs from the ceiling, then drops down into the 
      storage room where the urine samples are stored.  Blake grabs 
      the tray of already filled pee cups and places it on a low 
      table.  He removes the lid from every cup, unzips his fly, 
      and starts peeing in every cup.                      Workaholics 101 - Network Draft - 4/6/10             30.



      Adam and Anders are still standing in front of the urinals.  
      Robbie gets right up in Adam s ear.

      He hands Robbie the sample.


      Blake pushes himself, making sure to pee in every single cup.


      Anders now finishes peeing.

                                  ROBBIE
                    And you?

      He hands Robbie the filled pee cup.  Robbie sniffs it.

                    Hoo!  Smells like unemployment, 
                    boys.


      Robbie, with the two pee cups in hand, walks toward the 
      storage room door.  He reaches for the door key and brings it 
      toward the doorknob.


      Blake cleans up the spilled pee with a cloth.


      Robbie drops his keys.                      Workaholics 101 - Network Draft - 4/6/10             31.



      Blake places the tray of cups back on the rack where he found 
      it.  He jumps toward the hole in the ceiling, grabs on and 
      pulls himself up as Robbie opens the storage room door and 
      enters.


      A janitor vacuums in the hallway while Alice is in her office
