On the chanting crowd now as the train pulls away. We
focus on a handsome young man, a little stiff maybe, a
little intellectual. This is VALENTIN FEDOROVITCH
BULGAKOV. He can't contain his enthusiasm. Over the noise
of the train.
VALENTIN
Do you know who that is? That is
the greatest man in the world.
The train pulls away into the distance.

Chertkov kisses Valentin delicately on both cheeks and
ushers him into the dying light.
CHERTKOV
Godspeed, my boy.
Valentin makes his way to the droshky that awaits him.
CHERTKOV
And remember what I said.
He turns back to the dark figure in the doorway.
CHERTKOV
Write everything down! Go!

SOFYA. Black and white film of her being handed the
newspapers at the step. She looks up at the camera,
irritated by its presence.
CUTTING OUT TO COLOR we see a cinematographer on the lawn
cranking away at his camera. She goes into the house.

As Tolstoy appears on the porch, we hear the WHIR of
cameras. A crowd of photographers, film cameramen,
journalists, and disciples try to catch a glimpse of the
master. Dushan steps in front of him.
10.
DUSHAN
Let him walk. Let him walk.
JOURNALIST
Count Tolstoy, you're no doubt
distressed by the Czar's
treatment of your secretary
Nikolai Gusev ?
TOLSTOY
These people are bandits.
DUSHAN
I said, let him walk.
TOLSTOY
They come into my house and
arrest a man whose only crime is
to express a view of life saner
than that which prevails.
JOURNALIST
So Gusev is innocent?
TOLSTOY
(nods)
Of course, I'm the guilty one. I
reject the Orthodox church. I
condemn the established order and
I make no secret of it.
A young peasant shouts from the crowd.
PEASANT
God bless you, Tolstoy. Thank
you.
DUSHAN
Let him walk. Let him walk.
(to Tolstoy)
But you don't banish these people
very much to your credit...I wish
I had your largeness of spirit.
A photographer's flash goes off. An old Muzhik touches
Tolstoy's sleeve, as if expecting a miracle.
Sasha, her father's soulmate, leads two horses toward them,
her mount and her father's black gelding, Delire.
SASHA
Papa.
TOLSTOY
Sasha!

SASHA
Did you ride this morning?
A small crowd collects to watch father and daughter
embrace, kiss.

Seven miles from Tolstoy's estate, this is Telyatinki, a
communal center created by Chertkov dedicated to the study
and practice of Tolstoyism.
SERGEYENKO
Telyatinki was created by
Vladimir Grigorevich as a center
for the movement. Just last week
we had a visitor from India. We
talked to the group about the
healing properties of cobra
venum.
VALENTIN
Oh, goodness..It's a beautiful
day.
SERGEYENKO
Yes, but we will pay for it.
Sergeyenko, Chertkov's joyless secretary, and Valentin
stand on a second storey porch looking out across the
central lawn where a number of young Tolstoyans tend the
garden, work to put up a chicken coop.
12.
SERGEYENKO
The meeting room is behind us.
This is the tool shed. The
dormitory ahead.
He points out a larger building across the way.

The sun rising. Already, disciples are at work the gardens.

DAY.

A modest horse drawn cart. Valentin sits beside the driver,
contemplates the birch trees that line the road, the long
shadows they cast. Above, crows make lazy circles in the
sky.

Sofya, Sasha, Valentin, ANDREY, Tolstoy's son, and Tolstoy
all clustered around a table taking tea. Dushan stands near
the group fiddling with a gramophone that sits on a small
table.
SOFYA
These people have nothing.
18.
DUSHAN
It really is the most
extraordinary thing.
Absolutely ignoring him.
SOFYA
It's not for lack of land that
the muzhiks live in poverty.
They have no will power and they
drink too much.
TOLSTOY
I'm not suggesting they be given
land. Private property is the
root of the problem... We should
be giving ours away.
ANDREY
Give it to whom?
SOFYA
It's all ridiculous. You think
that poverty makes the peasants
somehow morally superior.
TOLSTOY
I believe that wealth corrupts us
all, yes I do.
A pause.
Valentin fills the silence.
VALENTIN
It's a keystone of the movement.
SOFYA
Oh, I know all about the
movement.
A pause. Valentin notices that people from the front lawn
have moved up to watch all this. Life in the fishbowl, the
Tolstoys seem neither to notice nor care.
TOLSTOY
If the peasants had money, they
wouldn't surround themselves, as
we do, with footmen costing ten
rubles a month.
SOFYA
No, they'd spend it on drink and
whores.
TOLSTOY
Valentin Fedorovich, do you think
fifty years from now, people will
eat while grown men walk around
and wait on them hand and foot?
19.
Valentin doesn't know what to say. A giggle from Dushan.
DUSHAN
Oh, that's good...that's good.
Dushan, having sat at table, tries surreptitiously to get
down Tolstoy's words in the diary he holds below the table.
Sofya flushes with anger.
VALENTIN
I think...(sneeze)
SOFYA
Stop scribbling!
(points to her husband)
You all think he's Christ, don't
you? He thinks he's Christ.
There is an awkward pause.
DUSHAN
(flustered)
I'm not...I don't believe Leo
Nikolayevich is Christ. Christ is
Christ but...
SOFYA
But what?
DUSHAN
I believe he's one of the
prophets. God speaks through him.
I recognize the cadence in his
voice.
SOFYA
This is unbearable. No wonder I
feel lonely. I'm surrounded by
morrons.
SASHA
Mama, you're being ridiculous.
SOFYA
Am I? I sit here and listen to
this talk of love and God and
equality, knowing full well that
Count Generosity here is fully
prepared to give away everything
we have.
TOLSTOY
(exhausted)
You keep going on like that...Why
do you think we should profit
from the work Im doing which is
only meant for the sake of the
people.
20.
She turns to see Dushan scribbling again.
SOFYA
STOP IT!
STOP WRITING NOW!
Valentin glances at Sasha, uncomfortable at these
outbursts. A long pause. Dushan tries to relieve the
tension.
DUSHAN
In defense of my gift, let me
demonstrate. It's quite
remarkable, really.
He gets up, places a record on the gramophone, needle on
the record. What comes forth is not music, but Tolstoy's
voice.
It is a recording of a recent speech against capital
punishment. His voice booms, tinny and distorted. Dushan
walks to the machine, stares at it in awe. Valentin is
completely caught up in the technology.
VALENTIN
It's your voice. It's wonderful.
They all listen for a moment, look to Tolstoy for a
response.
TOLSTOY
It's tiresome. Another
remarkable invention will
supercede it.
Valentin blushes and looks at the table. Dushan tries to
hide his disappointment.
TOLSTOY
Please excuse me.
Tolstoy rises, leaves the table, walks out onto the lawn.
Dushan gets up quickly, bumping the table as he goes. Tea
spills. Valentin moves to wipe it up, sneezes, a barrage of
irritable blessings.
DUSHAN
Leo Nikolayevich is something of
a Luddite, I fear.
Sofya crosses to the machine, removes the record from the
gramophone, replaces it with another Dushan has brought.
Suddenly, the air is filled with
the final duet from
Mozart's Il Nozze di Figaro. She
returns to her place.
There is a long moment where all
take in the sublimity of
it. Tolstoy walks slowly back to
the table. He stands
completely still. Tears fill his
eyes and roll down his
cheeks.
21.
TOLSTOY
Oh, thats better. Thats nice.
Very nice indeed.
Sofya crosses to her husband, wipes the tears off his face.
Valentin watches as they embrace.
VALENTIN (O.S.)
Do your parents often speak to
each other so...bluntly?

Valentin rides into the compound. A number of the disciples
are outside working. There is the ringing of metal on
wood. He looks for the source. As the way clears a little,
he sees Masha chopping away with an axe. He stops his horse
to watch her.
MASHA
You're finished for the day?
VALENTIN
He didn't need me this afternoon.
He gets down off his horse. Masha continues to chop. He
picks up an axe, holds it awkwardly.
VALENTIN
Leo Nikolayevich disapproves of
women doing physical labor.
(beat)
Don't you find that reactionary?
MASHA
No, I find it sweet. I find you
reactionary.
She laughs. Valentin picks up a log, sets it on end and
begins to chop. He doesn't do it well. Masha smiles at his
struggle.
MASHA
He admires you, I believe.
What's she saying?
MASHA
Sergeyenko told me. He's
miserable about it.
26.
VALENTIN
Tolstoy's kind to everyone.
The log is stuck to the blade of his axe. He's really
struggling now.
MASHA
What do you talk about when
you're with him?
(beat)
Why are you blushing?
VALENTIN
We talk about me.
MASHA
Really.
VALENTIN
He wants to know everything about
me, my parents, my relations with
women, my experience of god -
He looks up to see Masha smiling at him.
MASHA
And what relations are these?
Valentin blushes, goes back to trying to chopping. Almost
immediately the log becomes stuck to the blade of the axe.
He bangs it, bangs it trying to free it. He glances up to
see her still looking at him. He pounds again and again.
She stops, reaches for his axe, touching him as she does.
She lifts the big axe, log and all, above her head,
bringing it down hard. The log splits. She hands the axe to
him.
MASHA
I had a lover before I came
here... headmaster of a school
where I taught. He was married -
happily married. It was
difficult. We could make love
only at school.
This is somehow more than Valentin had bargained for.
VALENTIN
At school?
MASHA
In the gymnasium, after the girls
had gone. There were straw mats
on the floor.
VALENTIN
I see...
27.
He looks away to hide his confusion.
MASHA
Have I upset you?
He looks at her.
VALENTIN
No...I appreciate your frankness
MASHA
But you disapprove of me. I see
it in your eyes.
VALENTIN
I don't. Not at all...I think
sexual activity...how men and
women combine their physical
parts is completely neutral.
MASHA
Listen to you. You're a prig.
Just like Sergeyenko. Why else
would they have hired you?
VALENTIN
That's not fair
MASHA
I don't care if it's fair. It's
true...neutral...my God...
VALENTIN
I'm going.
He puts down the axe.
MASHA
Do as you like.
She goes back to chopping. We track in front of him as he
walks toward the house. The chopping stops.
MASHA
Valentin Fedorovich.
He stops, relieved and turns to face her.
MASHA
You forgot your horse.
VALENTIN
Yes. You know, I think that I...
never mind.
He hesitates for a moment, then starts toward her. Her back
is to him. She begins to chop again. The color rises in his
face as he tries to salvage a little dignity.
28.
He grabs the reins and starts again toward the buildings,
trips in a ditch, almost falls flat. Red faced, he rights
himself. The chopping behind him remains constant.
Sergeyenko watches him from the porch.

Valentin and Tolstoy walk together in the woods. .
TOLSTOY
I couldn't write. I was
distracted I think...I had a
dream last night, about a Tartar
girl I knew in the war.
VALENTIN
A girl who died?
TOLSTOY
No, no...A girl I had sexual
intercourse with... Sometimes we
did it twice a day.
Valentin sneezes.
TOLSTOY
God bless...I've never forgotten
our time together, the position
of our bodies, the taste of
her...
VALENTIN
You shouldn't torture yourself.
It was a long time ago.
Tolstoy laughs out loud.
29.
TOLSTOY
Torture? You are a virgin,
aren't you.
VALENTIN
I try to...you know, to...
TOLSTOY
To be what, a good Tolstoyan?
Tolstoy smiles.
TOLSTOY
You see, I myself am not a very
good Tolstoyan. You should think
twice about asking my advice
about anything... Torture...
(he laughs)
VALENTIN
Are you alright?
TOLSTOY
Kalya, her name was...She's an
old woman now, white hair, old
body like me. She'd hardly
remember my name, I suspect. She
may even be dead. (beat) Do you
think that meant something?
VALENTIN
What do you mean?
TOLSTOY
I mean that little romance. Was
there some meaning to it?
VALENTIN
Its interesting. I think you
would say..I mean, Ive read
where you say that the physical
body isnt real. That its all an
illusion.
TOLSTOY
I say lots of things. What do you
say? What do you think?
VALENTIN
I...I dont know.
Leo Nikoleyevich smiles.
TOLSTOY
I dont know, either.
He inhales deeply.
30.
TOLSTOY
Smell that...
VALENTIN
Lilac?
He looks up as he hears Sasha off screen. "Papa. Papa."
TOLSTOY
Precisely. It's lilac. The
smell's stronger when the sun
goes down.
He presses Valentin's hand.
SASHA
Papa!
TOLSTOY
I've enjoyed myself, my boy.
(shouting for Sasha)
WE'RE HERE.
As he starts in the direction of her voice. Sasha appears
in the clearing, telegram in hand.
SASHA
He's free. He's free...He's

Chertkov climbs down from his droshky. Suddenly, Tolstoy is

TOLSTOY

Tears run down his old cheeks. They embrace again.
SOFYA (O.S.)
He'll try again to convince your
father to change his will.

And into the drive to greet Chertkov. He moves immediately
to her, offers her his hand and an unctuous smile.
SOFYA
Vladimir Grigorevich, what a
surprise.
CHERTKOV
Sofya Andreyevna, I'm happy to
see you.

Valentin and Chertkov sit together in the droshky, an

CHERTKOV
I'm glad to have a moment alone
with you, Valentin. How do you
think you're getting on?
VALENTIN
(a little nervous)
I hope my work is pleasing to Leo
Nikolayevich.
CHERTKOV
Yes. He seems satisfied and
that's good. The reports I've
received from you however...
There seems to be some confusion.
VALENTIN
What do you mean?
CHERTKOV
You send me never ending
commentary on Tolstoy's writing.
That's all very interesting but
not very useful. I need to know
what goes on with Sofya
Andreyevna. You must see by now
she's committed to undermining
her husband's best intentions.
VALENTIN
It's not quite so obvious to me.
CHERTKOV
Because she is duplicitous. You
are very bright. Too bright to
let her into you.
Chertkov fixes the boy with his intense gaze.
CHERTKOV
You value our work?
33.
VALENTIN
I do.
CHERTKOV
The ideals we share?
VALENTIN
That's why I'm here.
CHERTKOV
Good, of course it is. (beat) Do
you think the Countess suspects
something?
VALENTIN
Well, I think the Countess is
very suspicios by nature.
CHERTKOV
How so?
VALENTIN
I dont think she likes you very
much.
CHERTKOV
What does she say?
VALENTIN
Its a tone Ive picked up.
CHERTKOV
We simply want to distribute
Tolstoy's work to the widest
audience possible. She just has
no understanding what it is we
are trying to do. Theres nothing
in it for any of us but a real
chance to increase the worlds
happiness.
He takes Valentin's hand.
CHERTKOV
I can only be of limited help to
the master if I don't know what's
going on. Any effort she makes to
shore up control of the
copyright, I must know. The
survival of our movement depends
on it. Remember who your friends
are. What you've come here to do.
Chertkov turns away to watch the countryside. Valentin
stares straight ahead, his nose twitches slightly.

made.

A Tolstoyan photo op. A delegation of orphans have come to
pay their respects to Tolstoy. He sits in a chair beside
Chertkov beneath a large banner : "Leo Tolstoy, Friend of
the People.". Behind him, the disciples lay out a
vegetarian feast on a plank table. Photographers and a
cinematographer are strategically positioned to record the
event.
Each child gives Tolstoy a flower. Chertkov, in turn, hands
each child a photograph of the Count giving money to the
poor.
Valentin enters, flushed and blushing. He pauses beside
Dushan who records the scene in his diary, tears in his
eyes.
DUSHAN
Look at the love in him, like
Jesus..suffering the
children...all that...
Tolstoy greets a little boy affectionately, rubs his
knuckles over the boy's shaved head. A little girl
approaches, takes a photograph. He bends forward to kiss
her head but she pulls away.
TOLSTOY
An old man is a very ugly thing.
Tolstoy sees Valentin, lights up.
TOLSTOY
My dear boy. Come and kiss me.
Valentin, beet red, goes to him. He is warmly embraced.
38.
TOLSTOY
Now, who is this? Maria
Filipovna.
Masha comes to stand beside him. She glances at Valentin
but he won't make eye contact with her.
TOLSTOY
You're both looking so well. Life
here at Telyatinki obviously
agrees with you.
Valentin sneezes mightily, moves a little away.
TOLSTOY
God bless you, boy. What are you
nervous about, now? Sit down. Sit
down.
Valentin takes the chair beside him.
TOLSTOY
Dear Masha, Valentin tells me
you're the great treasure of
Telyatinki. He claims you're a
very gifted teacher.
Sergeyenko lifts an eyebrow "Indeed.". Valentin is in
agony.
MASHA
We're happy to have you with us.
Tolstoy notices a mosquito on Valentin's cheek. He takes
the bug between his big fingers, squeezes until it pops.
Chertkov watches in horror, whispers loudly.
CHERTKOV
What are you doing?
TOLSTOY
What do you mean?
He motions to the photographers.
CHERTKOV
You've killed a living thing.
Chertkov hears a laugh behind him.
It is Masha who has
over heard the whole thing.
CHERTKOV
Do you have something to say?
MASHA
It's absurd. That's all.
Chertkov is taken aback.
Valentin stares at her.
39.
VALENTIN
What are you saying?
MASHA
I'm sorry but- It's a mosquito.
TOLSTOY
Forgive him. He can't help it.
He's a better Tolstoyan than I
am.
She can't help laughing again. Valentin sees the color rise
in Chertkov's face.
CHERTKOV
It's not the message we want to
send.
Sasha suddenly appears. She holds a cable in her hand.
SASHA
From my mother "Nerves dreadful.
Stop. Insomnia. Stop. Pulse 100.
Stop. Please come home.

And we hear their laughter over the dark old house.

Valentin sits by himself on the porch, writes in his diary.
Down below, some of the disciples listen to peasants play
music around a bonfire. A voice from the darkness.
MASHA
I'm not supposed to do this
either.
He locates the speaker by the glow of her lit cigarette.
VALENTIN
Masha. You are not supposed to
smoke at Telyatinki.
MASHA
You wouldn't look at me.
VALENTIN
It was difficult in front of the
others.
MASHA
But it wasn't difficult in your
bed... When it was only you and
me in front of God.
VALENTIN
I'm not sure I was conscious of
God.
Masha emerges from the shadows, but keeps her distance.
MASHA
So, I made you forget God?
VALENTIN
No...
MASHA
Yes, only for a moment. You
forgot your rules and remembered
love.
VALENTIN
You make it sound very simple.
MASHA
It is simple. What we did is what
men and women do, have done, will
continue doing. What could be
more simple? We touched each
other-- stayed close together.
Something passed between us.
Something real. That is a
betrayal of what? Of nothing.

43.
MASHA (cont'd)
But you're afraid... All your
ideas. What are you afraid of?
VALENTIN
I'm afraid I've hurt you, havent
I?
MASHA
No. I feel a little sad, but it
is not for me. It's for you.
She disappears into the house. Valentin looks after her.
55
56
She comes through the dining room to find Tolstoy on the
back terrace. Wrapped in a blanket, he writes in his diary,
a cup of tea in front of him.
SOFYA
Good morning, my darling? Do you
mind if I join you?
Without looking up
TOLSTOY
Of course, my dear.
He continues to write. She watches him for a long moment.
She opens her diary and begins to write as well.
SOFYA
It's quite insane, my darling.
Everyone is making fun of you.
He looks up.
TOLSTOY
What are you talking about?
She continues to write.
SOFYA
Even the muzhiks. I heard them
laughing in the barn.
TOLSTOY
About what?
Sofya looks at him knowingly.
44.
TOLSTOY
Laughing about what?
SOFYA
I don't want to ruin last night.
She sips her tea, goes back to her writing. A pause. He
follows suit. After a moment...
SOFYA
Laughing about the fact that
you've developed a senile crush
on a fat middle aged flatterer.
Your passion for Chertkov has
become a standing joke.
TOLSTOY
I have a great affection for
Vladimir Grigorivich. Let them
laugh if they find it amusing.
SOFYA
But it's not amusing, darling.
It's sick. It's not normal. You
hang on his every word.
TOLSTOY
We have a great deal in common.
SOFYA
You have nothing in common. You
are a genius. He's a sycophant
and a pervert.
TOLSTOY
Because he understands what I'm
trying to do? Because he tries
to help me accomplish it?
SOFYA
He is using you. You just can't
seem to see it.
TOLSTOY
This is absolute nonsense.
SOFYA
That bold, obese, idiotic man.
You treat him...
He turns to her...his face red with anger and frustration.
TOLSTOY
It's impossible for you not to
distract me. Let me alone... for
God's sake. You're like a spoiled
child.

He rises, spits on the ground, goes into the house. Sofya
follows.

Four peasants pull a water cart down a rough country road.
We pan off to see Sofya in her droshky, resplendent in a

They are back in the droshky, the return trip to Yasnaya
Polyana. Valentin doesn't respond.
SOFYA
We've become close friends, I
think. Tell me everything, dear
boy. I love a romance.
VALENTIN
It's nothing, really.
SOFYA
A young woman in your life is
nothing?
VALENTIN
Masha is a friend.
SOFYA
A lover?
50.
VALENTIN
A good friend.
SOFYA
That sounds serious enough.
Valentin looks away.
SOFYA
I don't mean to annoy you.
VALENTIN
I'm not annoyed.
SOFYA
You forget that I'm an
experienced reader. I can read
your face, every letter. It's
beautifully clear.
(beat)
Do you love her?
Valentin looks at Sofya, tears in his eyes.
VALENTIN
Maybe I do.
SOFYA
Not something they'd understand,
these so called disciples of my
husband. They've never understood
a word he's written.
(beat)
What do any of them know about
love?

Masha carries two water buckets suspended from a pole
across her shoulders. Arriving at a stream, she takes each
bucket and fills it. It's hot work. Pausing a moment, she
kneels to splash water on her face.
Another P.O.V. - someone watches her from the trees.
As Masha wets a cloth, puts it around her neck. Suddenly
someone grabs her from behind. She screams, wrestle her
way free. She turns to see Valentin, flushed, smiling,
excited. He steps toward her, kicks over one of the
buckets.
VALENTIN
Sorry, sorry, I'll... I didn't
mean to scare you...Are you
alright.
51.
MASHA
Fine...fine...Why did you...?
VALENTIN
I came back as soon as I could.
It was a strange day. Leo
Nikolayevich,...I love to listen
to him. I love nothing more...
He moves closer to her.
VALENTIN
But today I could hardly
concentrate.
He's very close to her, now.
VALENTIN
All I could think of was you.
Masha shakes her head, moves away from him. Begins to
gather the pole, to refill the spilled bucket. Stops her,
turns her to him.
VALENTIN
What's wrong?
MASHA
I think I've confused you. I've
confused us both.
VALENTIN
No. No. You didnt confuse me..I
was stupid. I was afraid, but I'm
not afraid anymore.
Valentin wants to fight through the awkwardness. He tries
to kiss her. She won't have it. She pulls away.
VALENTIN
I love you, Masha!
MASHA
Maybe you could help me a little.
In silence, he gets the filled buckets balanced on the
pole. Without another word, Masha starts toward the
buildings. He doesn't know what to do. He's losing her. He
shouts.
VALENTIN
Masha...
She turns
52.
VALENTIN
Before the other night...I'd
committed the act of copulation
many times in my heart.
He has her attention now, as well as that of a number of
the disciples who look up from their work in the yard.
MASHA
Yes...
VALENTIN
I think about you all the time.
In my heart Ive comitted the act
of copulation many times. I just
want to say...It was never like
it was with you.
Masha bursts out laughing.
MASHA
I'll wait for you, then.
As Valentin goes to catch her up, he sees Sergeyenko
watching from outside the unfinished chicken coop.

Sofya stand on the window ledge high above the ground.
She
begins to move toward the library balcony.

Sofya moves along the narrow ledge as if it's a perfectly
normal activity.. Looking down, she sees a couple of
gawkers watching her from the lawn. She shoos them away.
73
74
Sofya has reached the french doors. She can hear clearly
now.
TOLSTOY (O.S.)
But she won't. She'll never
understand.
HER P.O.V. a crowd of gawkers gather on the lawn below her.
One man sets up photographic equipment. She waves him away
turns back to the window.

Valentin sits at the bonfire, with other disciples. After a
while he walks towards the house.

It is an autumn afternoon. Valentin and Tolstoy pick their
way through the thick undergrowth.
As they come into a clearing. Valentin is surprised to see
a portable table and several chairs set up like lawyers
office in the middle of the wood. Sergeyenko fiddles with a
piece of paper on the desk. Chertkov comes toward them.
Tolstoy stops his horse. He turns to Valentin with tears in
his eyes.
TOLSTOY
You see, I no longer feel I have
a choice in the matter. She
isn't...
He rides forward toward the approaching Chertkov.
64.
CHERTKOV
Good afternoon, Leo Nikolayevich.
TOLSTOY
Is it?
They help Tolstoy dismount. They lead him to a nearby stump
and place the writing board before him. Sergeyenko hands a
document to Chertkov who lays it on the board.
CHERTKOV
This will insure that the
complete works will live in the
public domain.
SERGEYENKO
Monumentous.
CHERTKOV
Your work is the birthright of
the Russian people. Now, they
possess it forever.
Tolstoy looks up at them.
CHERTKOV
Yes?
TOLSTOY
I need a pen.
CHERTKOV
Of course.
Chertkov looks at Sergeyenko who swallows hard. No pen.
SERGEYENKO
I...uh...
CHERTKOV
What?
Sergeyenko moves close to Chertkov, close enough to
whisper.
CHERTKOV
You're a secretary.
How can you
not have a pen?
Sergeyenko points at Valentin.
SERGEYENKO
He's a secretary, too.
Ask him.
CHERTKOV
Valentin Fedorovich, do you have
a pen?
65.
Valentin hesitates for a moment, looks at Tolstoy, seated
on the stump, staring into the middle distance.
VALENTIN
I do.
Valentin fetches it from his satchel.
Pen in hand, Tolstoy hovers over the document. A long
moment.
CHERTKOV
Are you alright?
TOLSTOY
I feel like a conspirator.
Sergeyenko laughs. Chertkov glares at him. It's beyond
awkward. Valentin looks to the sky, sees the crows
circling again.
Without further hesitation, Tolstoy picks up the pen and
signs the document. Then he moves away from the group.
Valentin watches him.
84

Valentin and Tolstoy water their horses at a stream.
Tolstoy seems weary.
VALENTIN
Maybe we should get back. It'll
be dark soon. May I ask you
something that has nothing to do
with work?
TOLSTOY
Of course, my dear.
VALENTIN
Do you love your wife?
TOLSTOY
" Your youth and your desire for
happiness reminds me cruelly of
my age and the impossibility of
happiness for me." When I was
courting Sofya, she was so young
and pure, it seemed impossible
that I'd ever have her.
I didn't want to tell her how I
felt and I wanted to tell her
nothing else. So I wrote down a
string of letters and asked her
if she could decipher them. She
looked completely confused,
thinking it was a game or...
66.
Tolstoy looks into the middle distance, remembering his
love.
TOLSTOY
I gave her one clue. The first
two Y's, I said, stand for "your
youth" and then the most
miraculous thing happened. She
simply spoke the phrase, my
phrase...
Tolstoy looks at Valentin as if the boy might offer some
explanation of the miraculous.
TOLSTOY
...as if she had read my mind.
In that moment, we both knew we
would always be together. For
those first years, we were
incredibly happy, terrifyingly
happy.
His old eyes are wet.
TOLSTOY
And now this.
Tolstoy reaches into his boot, extracts his SECRET DIARY.
He takes a pen from his shirt, begins to write. Valentin is
amazed. HE HAD A PEN ALL THE TIME.

The wind blows the trees around the old house.
We see a
lighted lamp move up the stairs.

96
The horses are hitched to the droshky, the bags are up on
the back.
SASHA
Everything's ready.
Dushan climbs into the carriage. Tolstoy turns abruptly and
walks back toward the house.
SASHA
Papa...?
DUSHAN
He's changed his mind. He's going
back to the house.
They watch as Tolstoy kneels on the wet grass, bending low
to rub his hands against the earth. After a moment,
Valentin goes to him, kneels next to him.
VALENTIN
Do you want to go back?
TOLSTOY
When I was a boy, my brother
Nikolai once brought me to a
place when I was a boy. He told
me he'd found a green stick with
some words on it... the secret to
happiness for all men everywhere.
He hid it in the ground. I looked
for it very often. I've looked
for it all these years. I really
believed I would find it
here...but I never did.
72.
Tolstoy looks at him.
TOLSTOY
I never did...but this life is
behind me now.
He kisses the ground of his beloved home, gets up and they
walk back to the droshky.
TOLSTOY
Help me up, will you?
As they go, he hands Valentin an envelope.
TOLSTOY
Give this to Sofya.
VALENTIN
I will.
They reach the carriage. Sasha embraces him, kisses him
over and over.
SASHA
Be well. Be well.
TOLSTOY
Don't cry. I'll send for you when
I can.
They help him up onto the droshky and the carriage starts
slowly away from the old house.
97

Out in front of the house, an old peasant woman pulls the
feathers off a chicken. Over her impassive face, we hear
deep, heavy sobs.
98
99
Sofya sprints away from the house and into the trees. A
couple of servants join the chase, Ivan and VANYA, a fat
manservant. Valentin, head of the group, sees Sofya move
out of the birches. She's heading straight to the pond.
74.
Sasha suddenly steams past him.
SASHA
Mama, Mama! Stop. Not this.
Hurry! Hurry!
VALENTIN
Countess!

Sofya has reached the bathhouse. Peasant women watch her as
they do their wash. She glances back her pursuers, races
on.
Tiring now, she goes to her knees. She crawls along the
jetty toward the water. At the edge of the jetty, she
falls on her back then turns over, most ungracefully, and
rolls off sideways into the pond.
HIGH ANGLE. Sofya sinks into the black water. The sound of
her rescuers fades away and is replaced by Tolstoy's voice,
reading the farewell note she still clutches in her hand.
TOLSTOY (V.O.)
My position in the house has
become intolerable. What I'm
doing now is what people have
commonly done - leave their
worldly life behind to spend
their last days in peace and
solitude.
SLOW MOTION She floats, strangely relaxed, beneath the
water.
TOLSTOY (V.O.)
I beg you to forgive me for
everything I've done to you, just
as I forgive you with all my soul
for everything you've done to me.
The silence is suddenly ripped apart by the rescuers. Sasha
and Valentin jumping into the pond. Sasha, barely able to
swim herself, thrashes in the water.
VALENTIN
Sasha, go back to the jetty.
Here, let me help you.
He offers his arm, using it to push her to safety.
SASHA
No! She's drowning.
Help her!
75.
VALENTIN
I will. I will. Stay here.
With that, he pushes away from the dock and makes a sharp
plunge under the water.
Sasha watches, waits...and after a long moment Valentin
surfaces pulling Sofya with him.
On the dock, the servants and Sasha help him to get her
heavy body , water soaked dress, back onto the bank.
She looks terrible. Her tongue lolling out, water drizzling
from her open mouth. Sasha is overcome.
SASHA
She's dead. My mother. She's
dead.
Ivan takes action. He rolls her on to her stomach, works to
expel water from her lungs. This goes on for an agonizing
length of time. Valentin looks to the sky... dull and gray.
Then a sound, coughing sputtering. She is alive. Sasha,
Valentin, and the servants help up.
SASHA
Let me take you to the house,
mother.
SOFYA
Let me die. Please. Why would
you rob me of that?
SASHA
Let's go to the house.
Sofya is suddenly clear, almost calm.
SOFYA
Ivan, go to the station. Find out
which train the master took.
Ivan looks at Sasha for approval.
SASHA
I see no harm in it. Let's get
her to bed.
Valentin nods. Ivan appears beside him.
IVAN
Life returns to torture her for
awhile.
He laughs out loud,then walks away.

Sasha, on horse back, rides up and by the camera and away
down the alley of trees that lead away from the house.
SOFYA (O.S.)

Clouds of steam against the white sky. A great black train
travels through the bleak world

The huge iron wheels grind on.

The train pulls into a small, dusty station, ASTAPOVO.
Valentin and Dushan support, help him off the train.
Sasha
looks at the sad, empty platform.
SASHA
We've come to the end of the
world.
115
115
Dushan and Tolstoy sit on a bench on the platform. Sasha
and Valentin appear.
VALENTIN
The stationmaster says we may
have his house for as long as we
need it. There are no inns
nearby, so we're lucky.
TOLSTOY
Very lucky.
DUSHAN
Yes.
They help Tolstoy up. A little bearded man, the station
master, waits to escort them.
SASHA
You'll be comfortable here, papa.
The rest of us...we'll find cots
or sleep in the station.
TOLSTOY
And then we'll be on our way.

Press and various hangers on have begun to arrive at
Astapovo. Outside the station master's house, Dushan gives
an update, temperature, pulse.
Valentin emerges from the telegraph office, telegrams and
cables in his hands. A long passenger train pulls in from
the north. There's general commotion at the new arrival.
"The Countess." "Is it the Countess?"... More press, a
cinematographer lugging his gear and CHERTKOV. He spots
Valentin. There is no greeting, no embrace.
CHERTKOV
Bulgakov! Where is he?
Take me
to him.
As they make their way across the tracks, Chertkov can
barely contain his glee.
83.
CHERTKOV
He left...astonishing...He
actually, finally left.
VALENTIN
He wasn't well enough to travel.
It's very cold.
Chertkov doesn't hear, He's basking in his victory.
CHERTKOV
It's a triumph for the movement.
122
125
The media circus is in town. There are snack bars and huts,
an army camp with typewriters instead of guns. Several news
cameras are set up near the stationmaster's house. Tents
have been erected as make shift shelters and offices.
Reporters struggle to get into the telegraph office. Word
goes around something big is happening.
At the platform, we see the highly polished private train
pull in. The Countess has arrived.
85.
SOFYA APPEARS in her handsome traveling clothes. An
unctuous little orthodox priest follows her out of the
train.
ORTHODOX PRIEST
If the Count should have a change
of heart...if in the last moment
he chooses to confess, mother
church is there to embrace him
with open arms.
She nods.
SOFYA
I'll see what I can do, father.
She moves with purpose across the tracks and through the
throng Reporters pelt her with questions.
126
127
Sofya has reached the edge of the platform where DUSHAN
gives his medical update, temperature and pulse, to the
press. She pulls Dushan aside. Reporters surround them.
SOFYA
I want to see my husband.
DUSHAN
Yes I'll...uhm...
SOFYA
I want to see him. Now!
Dushan is terrified. Valentin arrives at the platform.
VALENTIN
Countess!
86.
SOFYA
Valentin...Will you help me?
I
have to see him. Please.
VALENTIN
Of course. But I'm not certain if
its the best time, Countess.
She starts toward the building.
SOFYA
It is.
It's the right time for
me.
VALENTIN
Sofya Andreyevna...
(to the crowd) Stay back, stay
back.
128
128
As Valentin arrives outside the door, he see Sofya
physically recoil. She is confronted by Chertkov and Sasha
blocking the door.
SOFYA
I want to see my husband.
Members of the press, crowd `round trying to listen.
SASHA
He's too weak now, mother.
SOFYA
But he's not too weak to see you.
Not too weak to see that...
She gestures in Chertkov's direction. The passion attracts
more onlookers.
CHERTKOV
Do you really want to do this
here?
She does her best to ignore him.
SOFYA
I am the leper outside the gate,
while he sleeps with the devil
himself.
SASHA
Vladimir Gregorovich is here
because father asked him to be
here.
87.
This stops Sofya for a moment. She looks to Valentin.
SOFYA
Is that true?
Valentin nods.
She tries another tack.
SOFYA
Have you told him I nearly
drowned in the pond?
SASHA
We didn't have to. It was in all
the papers.
Valentin is very aware of the publicness of it all.
VALENTIN
Let me take you back.
But she plows on.
SOFYA
What did he say?
SASHA
That if you killed yourself, he'd
be upset.
SOFYA
He'd be upset?
SASHA
Horribly upset...but he could not
have acted other than he did.
Sofya begins to sob.
SOFYA
I want to see him.
(beat)
He's not your husband.
He's my
husband.
SASHA
You're unbearable.
Sasha goes back toward the door.
SOFYA
And you are a stone-hearted bitch
of a daughter.
Sasha disappears back inside. Sofya screams after her.
88.
SOFYA
I lost five children. Why
couldn't one of them have been
you?
Chertkov watches, makes little attempt to conceal his
pleasure.
CHERTKOV
Are you finished?
A pause. Sofya is suddenly aware of the crowd around her.
SOFYA
Valentin, will you take me back?
Valentin nods.
VALENTIN
Yes, of course.
Sofya takes his arm, starts back across the platform.
Shaken, she tries her best to maintain her dignity as she
walks through the crowd. She leans against Valentin,
whispers.
SOFYA
I've behaved badly, haven't I?
VALENTIN
No, Countess, Don't worry. Not at
all.
Around her, journalists ask questions, photographers call
out "Turn to us, Countess." "Show us your eyes."

She's in pain.
SASHA
He said to me once..."you're like
your mother. You're so full of
anger."
She turns to him.
SASHA
I know it's terrible...but who
will protect him? I don't want
him to die.
Valentin touches her face, goes back inside and into

136
137
The circus sleeps. Valentin sits on a bench outside the
station master's house. The tents erected by the press
glow like lanterns in the field.
93.
Some people lie on the hard platform. He looks across the
tracks at Sofya's private car. A single light burns in the
window
138
139
Dushan appears in the doorway. Solemn, he gestures for him
to come inside. Valentin stands.
140
143
Sofya and Sasha walk to the door. The reporter calls out
REPORTER
Countess...Countess...Do you have
any information? Countess...Is he
dying? Is he dead?
Sasha takes her mother's hand.
144
145
A sizeable crowd has assembled, the usual reporters,
photographers, cinematographers, but students, too, and
soldiers, factory workers, housewives.
Dushan faces the crowd. Quiet. Quiet.
DUSHAN
At ten minutes after six in the
morning, a great soul passed from
our world. Leo Nikoleyevich
Tolstoy is dead.
As Dushan finishes his tribute, a single voice begins to
sing the old Russian hymn, Eternal Memory. Gradually, more
and more of the crowd picks it up. Valentin begins to sing.
His eyes run over the crowd of mourners. Then, something
stops the flow of his gaze. His eyes fill with tears.
VALENTIN
Masha...
Masha. She walks slowly toward him out of the crowd. He
goes to her, takes her in a long embrace.
VALENTIN
Masha...Masha...I'm so sorry he's
gone. Hes gone.
MASHA
Yes. Yes. I know, but I came for
you, Valya. I came for you, too.
VALENTIN
I love you. I do. I love you.
MASHA
Then, hold me. Hold me. Hold me.
The song, the voices swell around them.
They hold each
other like they will never let go.
146

A black draped funeral train waits in the station. Many
mourners are congregated on the platform. Chertkov comes
out of the little house, followed by Andrey, Valentin and
Dushan carrying Tolstoy's coffin to the train.
Sofya appears with Sasha, who escorts her through the
crowd. The Orthodox priest approaches .
98.
ORTHODOX PRIEST
As a daughter of the church, I'm
sure you wouldn't object to my
saying a few words at the
funeral.
Sofya stares at him for a long moment.
SOFYA
My husband needs no
justification. Besides, its been
enough talking as it is. Thank
you, father.
She climbs onto the train.
147
148
VALENTIN
Excuse me, Countess. This may
not be the time, but-
Sofya smiles
SOFYA
Valentin... and who's this...
VALENTIN
Masha...this is Masha.
Sofya nods.
SOFYA
This is your girl. Good. Good.
Is there anything I can do for
you?
VALENTIN
No, no. Not at all. I just wanted
to say good bye.
SOFYA
Yes...Good bye, good bye.
God
bless you.
99.
VALENTIN
God bless you, too.

Sofya looks out the window, sees the people lined up along
the rail, mourn her loss. As she looks away, we see the
people reflected in the glass, some of them kneel, some of
them remove their hats.
Valentin watches the train pull away. He holds Masha to
him.
As the train
moves slowly through the corridor of mourners,
some of them
fall in and walk behind it. The camera travels
up and up as
the train travels north taking Sofya and her
husband back
to Yasnaya Polyana.
