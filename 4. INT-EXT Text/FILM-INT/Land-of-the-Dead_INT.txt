RILEY and MIKE step into a tight, uncomfortable space.
Generators whir. Gears turn. The two men open a storage
locker and strap on ammo belts as...
...SOMETHING TERRIBLE LOOMS out of the shadows! It moves
toward Riley and Mike, who can't see it from behind the
locker. The LEFT SIDE OF THE THING'S FACE has been BURNED
AWAY. Only scar-tissue remains, and a single usable eye
bulging from a socket.
Riley turns. Sees the thing. And, surprisingly, he relaxes,
recognizing CHARLIE HOUK, a heavily-armed guerilla whose
intellect is as burned as his face.
CHARLIE
Tcha doin', Riley?
RILEY
Havin' a bad dream.
CHARLIE
I have bad dreams. Hell, yes. Just
look at me, you can tell that I
have terrible dreams.

RILEY
The town is full of walkers.
CHARLIE
Every town is full of walkers.
RILEY
These aren't just walking. They're
like...regular folks.
CHARLIE
But they're dumb, Riley. Hell, dead
folks is near as dumb as me!
RILEY
You learned how to make yourself
useful. That's what they're doing.
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
They dumped the trash. Cholo's on
his way.
Riley and Mike look across the room in the direction of the
voice. Twenty feet away, a WOMAN sits at the controls of what
looks like a scavenged airplane cockpit that's outfitted with
a mixture of high- and low-tech equipment. She wears a black
leather jacket with "PRETTY BOY" emblazoned across the back.
MIKE
(Surprised) Pretty Boy's a dame?
RILEY
This one is. Last one was a guy.
MIKE
What happened to him?
Pretty Boy turns, poking her finger through a BULLET HOLE
encrusted with year-old BLOOD in the chest of her jacket.
PRETTY BOY
I kept his jacket. For good luck.
MIKE
Luck?
RILEY
Put some flowers in the graveyard.
Pretty Boy reaches out and flips a toggle switch on the
control panel. THOOMB! THOOMB! DEEP CONCUSSIVE SOUNDS can be
felt as much as heard as...

CHOLO (CONT'D)
Hey, not me, Boss. You told me not
to have any fun, I'm not having any
fun at all. (To Mike) Come with me,

CHOLO unstraps his crossbow and leads the way cautiously
into the dark space. Every subtle SOUND in the SILENCE puts
MIKE more on edge. His hand tenses on his gun as SHADOWS loom
in front of him. Shadows that could be zombies, but are not.
Behind the dusty glass doors of a once-refrigerated wall-
unit, Cholo sees a CASE OF DOM PERIGNON. He goes to the
refrigerator. Re-strapping his crossbow, he opens the door.
Reaches in for the case of champagne. His two hands grab it.
A THIRD HAND GRABS IT!
Cholo looks up. The refrigerator has no back wall. A DEAD
THING with a Manson-like SWASTIKA tattooed in the center of
its forehead has stepped in from the shadows of a loading
area beyond. It GRABS Cholo with a terrifying GROWL.
Cholo falls under the weight of the champagne, and the
weight of the Dead Thing, which drops on top of him. They
roll, struggling. The Thing holds Cholo in a death grip.
At the front of the store, Mike fumbles with his rifle.
Foxy shoots at the Dead Thing and misses.
Cholo PUNCHES the Thing with his free hand. The Dead Thing's
head recoils, but lowers again toward Cholo, the Swastika
looming, drooling teeth baring for a bite. Cholo's eyes
flash. It's the first time we've seen him scared.
BLAM! CHARLIE FIRES one round, right into the center of the
swastika on the Zombie's forehead. The Thing crumples.
MIKE
Nice shootin'.
CHARLIE
Good shootin'. Ain't no such thing
as nice shootin'.

A FOOT KICKS the Zombie off Cholo, who looks up to see...

RILEY
Close one.
CHOLO
I'm still here, ain't I?
Everyone relaxes. Cholo picks up the case of Dom. The others
head toward the front of the store.
TILT DOWN TO THE FLOOR as their feet move past. In the gloom
behind stacks of cartons...
...A DEAD HAND appears. Reaching.
CHOLO
Shit! Look out, kid!
The hand grabs Mike around the ankle! Mike turns, raising his
gun. Too late.
A DEAD UNIFORMED POLICEMAN, the skin on half its face STRIPPED
DOWN TO BONE, RIPS A HOLE IN HIS LEG with its teeth!
ike SCREAMS, staggers into a wall, and drops to a seated
position on the floor. Riley and Charlie spin around at the
sound of his cry. Cholo, closest to Mike, pulls his crossbow
and fires an arrow through the Zombie's head.
C
HOLO
Fuckin' rookies.
Cholo tucks away the crossbow, grabs a box of Cohibas off a
counter, and runs outside with Foxy. Riley goes to Mike.
ILEY
(Kneeling) It's alright, son.
You're gonna be alright.
MIKE
No. I'm dead. You get bit by one
f those things and you become what
they are.
Riley wraps a strong arm around Mike and lifts him. Mike
quickly plants the barrel of his .45 under his chin and...
BLOWS HIS OWN BRAINS OUT!
iley, stunned, lets the corpse slide to the floor. He looks
into the rookie's open eyes, devastated.

A mile-long subway tunnel extends into BLACKNESS. A wide
PLATFORM runs the length of the tracks, at the head of which
A DERELICT TRAIN is parked.
A CARGO CARRIER pulls out, driving along the platform, its
flatbed piled with supplies, while ANOTHER CARRIER is being
loaded with boxes of food, pharmaceuticals, ammunition, and...
TWO BODY BAGS.
CHARLIE
Shit happens, Riley.
RILEY

The cargo carrier that was first to pull out drives into the
tunnel. CEILING LIGHTS spaced far apart STUTTER on and off.
Two guerillas, ANCHOR and MOUSE, who looks like a mouse, ride
on the open flatbed with the cargo.
The tunnel is filled with looming steel shapes that cast
menacing shadows. Mouse shifts nervously. Suddenly...
...PLINK! SOMETHING WET FALLS ON HIS FACE! He JUMPS.
Recovers. Wipes his cheek with his sleeve.
MOUSE
I hate going under the fuckin' river.
He takes out a joint. Lights up. The match FLARES. SPLAT!
Mouse and the match are soaked by WATER dripping from above.

weapons and hands them over.

The Guard takes Cholo's weapons and returns a claim check.
CHOLO collects his boxes and steps onto an escalator that
carries him up into an ENORMOUS ATRIUM. The "mall" we saw on
TV. SUNLIGHT splashes through glass walls onto box-planted
trees. Caged birds CHIRP seemingly in tune with the Chopin
that lilts over a sound system. SHOPPERS, expensively over-
dressed, stroll past stores. OTHER RESIDENTS lunch at
"outdoor" cafes. Cholo pulls out a kerchief and wipes the
smudges off his face, trying to make himself presentable.

ING! An elevator door opens. CHOLO, carrying the champagne
and Cohibas, steps out, walks to "PENTHOUSE NUMBER ONE", and
rings the bell. An instant after he pushes the button...
...the door is JERKED OPEN by TYLER KNIPP, 50-something, an
African American man in a white butler's jacket. Frightened,
he's wielding a SCISSORS, poised to strike.
KNIPP
(Lowering the scissors) Oh, Mister
DeMora. Mister Kaufman ain't home
and there's some shit goin' down.
No lie. I heard...
A SCREAM RINGS OUT down the corridor!
KNIPP (CONT'D)
I heard that!

ANOTHER SCREAM.
KNIPP (CONT'D)
Oh, man. Mister K. sure gonna be
upset about this.
Cholo drops his boxes and moves down the corridor.
KNIPP (CONT'D)
I called Security. They should be
here...
Cholo reaches the door to PENTHOUSE NUMBER TWO. It's locked.
ANOTHER SCREAM from inside. He FLINGS himself at the door.
The LATCH SPLINTERS out of the frame. The door BURSTS open...
6
36
...and CHOLO enters a dark foyer. The only light comes from
another room somewhere inside. A soft, rhythmic SQUEAK, like
a child's swing moving back and forth, ECHOES through the
apartment. It's an eerie, incongruous sound.
On guard, eyes straining, Cholo moves inside. The squeak gets
louder, the light brighter as he turns a corner and sees...
...a MIDDLE-AGED MAN, HANGING DEAD from a HOMEMADE NOOSE
suspended from a light fixture in the kitchen! THE BODY SWAYS
slowly, the harsh glare making the man's face even whiter
than it is. A toppled chair lies on the floor at his feet.
Cholo stands transfixed for an instant. And in that instant...
...HE IS GRABBED FROM BEHIND! He whirls, ready to kill, but
finds only a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN, 60-something, wearing a
tailored suit and expensive jewelry, her perfectness
blemished only by her hysteria.
WOMAN
My Johnny, he killed himself, he
killed himself. My Johnny! My
Johnny!
Cholo shakes her, hard.
CHOLO
Keep it together, lady.
Behind them, in the kitchen, unseen, a dazed YOUNG MAN, walks
up to the hanging corpse. He rights the toppled chair and
steps on it, lifting a paring to knife cut through the noose.
23.
YOUNG MAN
(Softly, to himself) Dad. Oh, Dad.
WOMAN
(To Cholo) Se-Security. Are you
Security?
CHOLO
No, I...
WOMAN
Then, for God's sake, who ARE YOU?!
She resumes her SCREAMING.
In the kitchen, the Young Man is slicing through the rope
when his DEAD FATHER'S EYES POP OPEN! The Young Man is too
busy with the rope to notice. THE HANGED MAN'S EYES BLINK.
Once. Twice. Three times. Its body TWITCHES. And then...
...the Hanged Man turns, making a move on the Young Man. The
motion increases the strain on the light fixture, which pulls
away, SPARKING, from the ceiling and CRASHES TO THE FLOOR,
along with the Hanged Man and his son.
The entire apartment is PLUNGED INTO DARKNESS. The woman
stops her screaming. Almost as soon as she does, a SNARL can
be heard from the kitchen, followed by another SCREAM, this
one coming from the Young Man.
Cholo rushes to a nearby fireplace and grabs a POKER and a
MATCHLIGHT, which looks like a pistol, but shoots FIRE from
its tip. He approaches the kitchen, using the FLAME to light
his way. In the FLICKERING GLOW, he sees...
...the Young Man lying on the floor. CHUNKS have been bitten
out of his neck and wrist. The body is CONVULSING in the last
moments of life. THE HANGED MAN IS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN.
Cholo stands over the Young Man and stabs him in the head
with the poker, jabbing the point all the way through. The
woman SCREAMS again from the kitchen doorway.
CHOLO
Shut up! I gotta hear. Where'd he
go? Where'd the other guy go?
Silence. Cholo pulls the poker out of the Young Man's head.
SHUFFLING sounds. He follows them to the other end of the
kitchen, probing the darkness with his matchlight.
The sounds are LOUDER here. Cholo lifts the poker, ready to
strike. Just as he does...
24.
...the back door of the apartment BURSTS OPEN and a SECURITY
GUARD lunges into the kitchen, rifle in hand.
SECURITY GUARD
(To Cholo) Drop it!
Cholo drops the poker and holds up his hands.
CHOLO
Hey, no problem.
TWO MORE SECURITY GUARDS come through the apartment's front
door and rush into the kitchen.
CHOLO (CONT'D)
No problem, no problem! But there
is a problem. There's a dead guy
walkin' around in here.
THE HANGED MAN appears without warning, attacking one of the
guards who just entered, BITING OFF half his left CHEEK,
including the EYE.
Before his partner can raise his gun, THE WOMAN GRABS IT FROM
HIM! Aims at the Hanged Man.
WOMAN
YOU SELFISH BASTARD! YOU LEFT ME
ALONE HERE!
She fumbles with the weapon, not knowing how to make it work.
The bitten security guard starts to lose all strength in his
legs. The Dead Thing holds him up, as if waltzing with him,
BITING HIM again and again.
Cholo takes the gun from the woman and shoots the Hanged Man.
BITTEN SECURITY GUARD
I need help. I need help!
Cholo kills the bitten security guard, too.
SURVIVING SECURITY GUARD
You...FUCK!
Cholo turns the gun on the surviving security guard.
CHOLO
You wanna talk about this? I did
what I had to do. I only did what I
had to do!

RILEY and CHARLIE step into the CELLAR of an old BROWNSTONE.
Dirt floor. Stone walls. The place is filled with smoke and
BUZZING with FLIES. As Riley and Charley turn their guns over
to TWO BIG BRUISERS inside, a TOUT named ROACH sidles over.

your pocket. I can show you how to
turn that money into more money.

Roach. Where's Chihuahua?
TOUT
Maybe I can find him for you. Come

Riley is already in. He has pushed past the Tout and is
striding into a fog where GAMBLERS are rushing to place bets
with heavily-armed BOOKIES. We're reminded of a cock-fighting
joint in a Pancho Villa movie.
RILEY
Lot of action tonight.
TOUT
Gotta new kind of game.

stands among them, wearing a Texas Stetson that sticks up
high above all other heads, its peacock feathers poking even
higher out of a snake-skin hat band.
iley grabs him and spins him around.
he man's feet are off the ground. Way off the ground. Far
from tall, he's a little person, who has been standing on a
platform, wearing a purple satin pimp-suit. He's a Latino,
who looks like a Chihuahua. And that's his name. CHIHUAHUA.

RILEY and CHARLIE drift into a large room that's packed with
BETTORS hooting and hollering like football fans. They're all
jammed onto tiered wooden viewing stands arranged around an
IRON-MESH STRUCTURE that looks like a lion-tamer's cage.
Gates open. THE PAINTED WALKERS are thrust inside the cage.
Their nooses are released. The gates are locked behind them.
D
EAD RED, alarmed by the color of DEAD BLACK's face, reaches
out and gently touches the paint. Its fingers come away with
blackened tips.
lack follows suit, staining its fingers red. Black licks its
hand, spitting when it identifies not blood, but something
distasteful.
BOOKIES drift among the spectators, taking bets with fists
full of cash.

dog?
TOUT
I told you. Today it's something
new.
CLANG! Another gate opens in the cage. A hush falls as
everyone awaits what will come. Including the Dead Men, who
gaze with anticipation at the opening. What comes is...
..A WOMAN! Alive, badly bruised, her dress in tatters.
Despite tarnish, she still looks sexy. Last night she was a
hooker known as SLACK. Now she's meat in a lion cage.
RILEY
Jesus fucking Christ.
The gate SLAMS shut. The Dead Things walk toward the woman.
Riley rushes off. Charlie follows.

lack backs up, hits the wall of the cage and, terrified,
starts to circle its iron perimeter. The Dead Men flank her.
Black is the first to touch her. The crowd HOWLS.
lack's terror turns to determination. She punches Black
three times in the face. The Thing recoils as she glides out
of its grasp.
RILEY and CHARLIE reach the BRUISERS who took their weapons.
RILEY

BRUISER
(Handing over the weapons) You

Riley cocks his M-16.

RILEY
In a little while.
In the ring, BLACK reaches for SLACK again. With one
lightning-fast move, she kicks it in the chest, sending it
flying into Red's arms. Red shoves Black aside.
Black makes another try for the woman. Red grabs its rival.
This time Black hangs on to Red's shirt. The two twirl around
in a staggering lampoon of a wrestling match.
Slack rushes to the side of the cage and starts to climb.
She's agile. Strong. But she almost falls as the cage SHAKES
with the force of...
...Red SLAMMING Black against the mesh.
On their way back through the arena, RILEY and CHARLEY push
through the crowd, trying to reach the center ring. A GOON
steps in front of them.
GOON
No guns in here!
Riley gives him a rifle butt in the face and moves on.

lack continues to climb the cage, almost out of reach, but
Black grabs one of her ankles, pulling her down and slamming
her to the ground.
Black hunkers, drooling, over Slack. As it is about to bite,
RAT-A-TAT! A short burst from Riley's M-16 shatters Black's
collarbone. Cheekbone. Skull. The Thing drops.
Red lunges for Slack. Riley kills it with another short BURST.
he crowd PANICS, stampeding toward the exit. Suddenly MORE
BULLETS FLY, this time from a GLOCK, FIRED by...
...CHIHUAHUA, who, in a rage, is pushing through the LEGS of
the fleeing crowd. He makes it to a clear spot and draws a
steady bead on a target...Charlie. Chihuahua pulls his
trigger. Riley beats him by an instant, FIRING the M-16.
Just as Chihuahua's gun GOES OFF...a LINE of BULLET HOLES
PERFORATES the little man's belly. The round from his Glock
misses Charlie completely.
Riley runs to the cage, where Slack stands, trembling, just
on the other side of the bars.

hihuahua is still on his feet. And now he is really pissed.

Riley turns to Chihuahua, but doesn't have time to lift the
M-16 before...BLAM! The little man FIRES at him. Slack
delivers a powerful KICK into the flexible fencing, sending
Riley sprawling to the ground and saving him from...
...Chihuahua's round, which misses Riley...but HITS SLACK!
Spun around by the impact, she falls face down.
Chihuahua continues to FIRE. Riley Marine-crawls as bullets
PUNCH around him, SPARKING off the cage. Chihuahua keeps
coming, keeps FIRING, until...
...A SINGLE SHOT from Charlie's .45 shatters his skull. He
drops like a broken pinata.
Riley looks up, seeing TWO OTHER MEN with guns. Chihuahua's
GOONS. For a moment it seems as if a major shooting match is
going to break out. But before it does...
POLICEMAN (O.S.)
Hold it!

..FOUR POLICEMEN burst in. The Goons lower their weapons.
Riley runs back to the cage, BLASTS the lock on the nearest
gate, and rushes inside. Slack's body is lying on the floor.
He suspects she's dead. When her BODY MOVES, he suspects
worse. He plants the barrel of his M-16 against her temple.
SLACK
I'm alright, I'M ALRIGHT!
Slack uses her left arm to push herself up to a sitting
position. Her right arm is BLEEDING, up near the shoulder.

A UNIFORMED GUARD leaves CHOLO in a PRISTINE WHITE conference
room with glass walls overlooking the rotting CITY far below.
Cholo sets the case of champagne and the box of Cohibas on a
conference table. A SMAN stands in SILHOUETTE at the windows.
ILHOUETTED MAN
How was Uniontown?
CHOLO
Dead.
SILHOUETTED MAN
Death intrudes on us even in the
Green, I'm afraid. I heard about
what happened with my neighbors.
I'm grateful for your help.
CHOLO
brought you back some presents.
Cholo opens the case of champagne. He pulls a bottle out,
untwists the wire, and uses his strong thumbs to pop the
cork. FOAM runs.
CHOLO (CONT'D)
ou probably want a glass, don't
you? Sure, a high-toned man likes
to drink out of a glass.
Cholo grabs a highball glass from a cupboard, pours champagne
into it, and brings it, overflowing, to the Silhouetted Man.
CHOLO
I got something else, too.
Cholo tears open the box of Cohibas. He picks up two cigars,
bites off the tips, puts one in his mouth, then, walking back
to the Silhouetted Man, puts the other in his mouth, lighting
them both with a wooden match that he strikes on his jeans.

CHOLO
Nope. I left it in the bank. Your

rom all those other nights. I got
enough now to buy me a place.
SILHOUETTED MAN
You mean here? In the Green?
The Silhouetted Man steps away from the window. Expensively
dressed, in his early 60s, he is PAUL KAUFMAN. He sets down
the highball glass Cholo gave him, gets out a proper
champagne flute, and fills it from the bottle, smiling
politely at Cholo.
KAUFMAN
I'm sorry, Mister DeMora, but
there's a very long waiting list.
CHOLO
How long?
KAUFMAN
This is an extremely desirable
location. Space is limited.
CHOLO
You mean restricted.

Well, I do have a board of
directors, a membership committee

Cholo lunges at Kaufman, grabs him by the collar.
CHOLO (CONT'D)
OU'LL LET ME IN OR I'LL...
Cholo feels the barrel of a .45 against his waist. Kaufman,
who has drawn the pistol from his jacket, is still smiling.
KAUFMAN
Maybe we should talk about this
when you're less excited.
Kaufman presses a button under the table. THREE SECURITY
GUARDS rush in, GRAB Cholo, and drag him away. Kaufman stops
one of the guards at the door.
KAUFMAN (CONT'D)
Softly) I won't be needing this
man any more.

HE SECURITY GUARDS lead CHOLO down the stairs. Cholo WHIRLS
like a Ninja. He SLUGS one guard, kicks another in the groin,
the third in the face, and escapes through a fire door.

RILEY RIPS off part of his shirt-sleeve and starts to bandage
the wound on SLACK'S arm. They are in a jail cell that has
brick walls and a small barred window facing a dark alley.
CHARLIE, stripped of all his guns, stares outside longingly.
RILEY
(To Slack) Why you? In that arena.
Why did the little fat man throw
you in with those things?
SLACK
It wasn't the little man. It was the
big man. The man upstairs. He's got
his fingers in everything down here.
If you can drink it, shoot it up,
fuck it, or gamble on it, it belongs
to him. He's just seein' that we get
a few cheap kicks so we don't go
thinkin' too hard about why he's
eating steak and the rest of us are
lucky to get the bones.
RILEY
Same question. Why you?
SLACK
They found out I was working with
Mulligan and his people. Tired of
eatin' off Cbones.
HARLIE
What can you do? Every place is the
same.
RILEY
Places with people. I'm gonna find
me a place where there ain't no
people. North. Canada.
SLACK
Wherever you're going, take me
ith you.
CHARLIE
He won't. Riley likes to be alone.
He might take me. Cuzz havin' me
around is pretty much the same as
bein' alone. (Glancing at Riley)
can make myself useful. And I
an shoot.
C
S
34.
SLACK
I can shoot. And I can be pretty
fucking useful. I had training. I
was gonna join the Army. Up the
Green. Till somebody figured I'd be
a better hooker than a soldier.
RILEY
I don't need to hear your story.
Everybody's got a story, and I'm
tired of hearin' them all!
SLACK
What's your story, Riley?
They look at each other, clearly attracted.
R
ILEY
I said everybody has a story. That
was wrong. I don't have one. Daddy
was a preacher. Mama kept the
house. School. Engineering. Nothing
bad ever happened to me...(turning
away)...till everything changed.
LACK
Everything changed for all of us.
Whether we had a story or not.
A SOUND outside the window. Charlie glances through the bars.
CHARLIE
Hey...
Riley and Slack look out the window. FOUR SECURITY MEN are
chasing MULLIGAN into the alley outside. They drive him like
an animal against a wall, club him, and drag him away.
RILEY
Mulligan.
RILEY instinctively reaches through the window's bars, but
there's nothing he can do. It's a helpless feeling.
HARLIE
What are they gonna do? Kill him?
SLACK
Not right away. First, they'll try
to get what they can out of him.
About people like me.
Riley puts his hand on her back.

In a ratty bedroom, FOXY is wakened out of a snore by CHOLO.
CHOLO
We're taking the truck out. Get
he guys.
FOXY
Riley?
CHOLO
No, not him. Just the regular
uys. Know what I mean?
46
46
SCREECH! CHOLO pulls a CARGO CARRIER to a stop along the
platform of the tunnel. FOXY, PRETTY BOY, MOUSE, ANCHOR, and
SCAR, the youngest of the team, leap off the flatbed.
CHOLO and his TEAM scramble into the vehicle.
FOXY
Should we send up some `sky flowers'?
CHOLO
No. Those things want to get in
here...let `em in.
52

KAUFMAN RIPS a TURKEY LEG off a cooked bird on a platter in
front of him and eats. Across the table sits one of his board
members, HARRISON SUTHERLAND. KNIPP enters.
KNIPP
Phone call, sir.
KAUFMAN
Thank you, Knipp. I'll take it.
Knipp brings a radio-phone to the table. Kaufman picks up the
receiver and lifts it to his ear.
KAUFMAN
Yes?
CHOLO (O.S.)
aufman?
Kaufman tenses, just enough for Sutherland to notice.
KAUFMAN
Ah. The one that got away.
S

CHOLO (O.S.)
You said we should talk when I was
less excited. I'm a lot less
excited now.
KAUFMAN
What do you want, Mister DeMora?
5

53
CHOLO
I can't have a place in the Green,
fine. I'll go find another place.
But you know what I'm gonna need?
Money. I want my money out of your
bank. And I want the rest of the
money out of your bank. And if you
don't give it to me, I'm gonna blow
you out of your fuckin' ivory
tower. I've got Dead Reckoning.
54
54
KAUFMAN
That's unfortunate.
CHOLO (O.S.)
Put the money on a boat and send it
across the river to the South Side.
Tenth Street Pier. One man to drive
the boat, no more. You've got till
midnight. Four hours. I won't be
there. Dead Reckoning won't be
there. But I'll know if it happens.
I'll know if it doesn't happen.
CLICK! CHOLO hangs up.
UTHERLAND
Trouble?
KAUFMAN
In a world where the dead are
returning to life, the word
`trouble' loses much of its
meaning. (Beat) He wants money.
SUTHERLAND
Pay him.
KAUFMAN
We don't negotiate with terrorists.
There are other options.
K

55

CLANG! A FIDDLER'S GREEN SECURITY GUARD opens a cell door.
S
ECURITY GUARD
Which one of you is Denbo?
RILEY, CHARLIE, and SLACK exchange glances. What now?
56
56
KAUFMAN sips a Scotch. SUTHERLAND is present, with a middle-
aged board member named CHANDLER STYLES and CLIFF WOODS, who
is young and ambitious. All of them are nervous, pacing. A
door opens and RILEY is ushered into the room.
KAUFMAN
Mister Denbo. Come in. Can I offer
you a drink?
RILEY
I don't drink.
KAUFMAN
Well, then...please sit down.
RILEY
Nobody else is sitting. I think
I'll just stand here, like the
rest of you. While you tell me
why I'm standing here.
AUFMAN
We need you to repossess a vehicle
that belongs to us. The vehicle you
designed, Mister Denbo. Dead
Reckoning has been stolen. By your
second in command. I want him
captured. Or killed. And I want my
two-million-dollar piece of
equipment returned.
R
ILEY
The truck.
KAUFMAN
Which has guns. Big guns. That
could do a great deal of damage if
he were to aim them at this city.
RILEY
Why don't you just send out your
troops?
C
H
41.
KAUFMAN
I don't want to lose them. I could
send five hundred men against that
thing and they'd all come back in
body bags. It's your vehicle. Cholo
was your man. You might be able to
get close enough to...do what has
to be done. (Refilling his scotch)
Do this for me and I'll grant you
something in return. Residence in
the Green.
RILEY
Not me. That's what Cholo wanted,
and you didn't give it to him, did
you? That's why he's out there
waving a cannon at your ass.
Kaufman won't admit that Riley's right, but he looks at him
with a glimmer of respect.
RILEY (CONT'D)
Give me one of those vehicles, over
in the depot, weapons, and enough
ammunition to go north.
KAUFMAN
But...there's nothing up north.
RILEY
That's the idea.
KAUFMAN
Alright. You've named your price.
An easy one to pay.
R
ILEY
One more thing. My friends. They
go with me.
KAUFMAN
Take them.
e looks at Riley, a hint of desperation behind his eyes.
KAUFMAN (CONT'D)
an you find Dead Reckoning?
Quickly?
RILEY
How quickly?
42.
KAUFMAN
By midnight.
RILEY
I have a way.

CHOLO'S TEAM laughs raucously at the fate of the zombies.
CHOLO
(Tense) Knock it off!

SOLDIERS pass out monster weapons to RILEY, CHARLIE, and
SLACK. Riley straps on a K-90. Charlie turns one down.
CHARLIE
I like the iron I already got.
SOLDIER
This piece fires fourteen rounds
a second.
Charlie unstraps his own REMINGTON. A la Sergeant York, he
licks his thumb. Wets the sight. And BLASTS a COCKROACH
climbing on a wall twenty feet away.

he Soldier checks the gun. The safety is off. He clicks
it on and embarrassedly hands the weapon to Slack.
RILEY
(To Slack and Charlie) You guys
don't have to come out with me if
you don't want to.
Slack ties her hair back with a bandana. Checks her gun clip.
SLACK
I'd feel like a dick if I didn't.
HARLIE
Me too. Just look at me you can
tell I'd feel like a dick.
SLACK
Some shit, ain't it? Goin' out to
save a place we don't give a fuck
about.
RILEY
It's not the place. It's the people
in it.
AUFMAN (O.S.)
Mister Denbo.
Riley turns. KAUFMAN and SUTHERLAND enter with several OTHERS.
KAUFMAN (CONT'D)
Your friends are going out with
you. I want some of my friends to

LOSE ON: SUTHERLAND'S alarmed face.
SUTHERLAND
What?
A TROOPER, equally alarmed, is reporting.
TROOPER
Wiped out! That's what he said!
Denbo! He said the depot was
wiped out by stenches!
KAUFMAN
Thank you. Keep us informed.
65

KAUFMAN paces with a cigar, passing SUTHERLAND, STYLES,
and CLIFF.
AUFMAN
I recognize that some of you are
concerned. We've been threatened by
a disgruntled employee. I've sent
people out to take care of the
problem. However, should something
go wrong, I want to assure you that
measures have been taken. I've
established outposts. With food and
supplies to support us on our way.
C
LIFF
On our way? To where?
KAUFMAN
Alternate sites have been chosen.
Air transport has been arranged.
For us and our families. As well as
necessary support personnel.
CLIFF
What about all the others?
Kaufman looks at Cliff, as if expecting him to understand.
AUFMAN
All the others can be replaced.
y others.
LIFF
But...
KAUFMAN
Cliff, let me talk to you for a
moment.
Kaufman leads Cliff into...
51.
...an alcove on the far side of the room, shutting two pocket
doors made of sandblasted glass. Sutherland and the others
can't hear, but can see, Kaufman and Cliff in SILHOUETTE.
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOORS: Kaufman leans close to Cliff,
smiling, his eyes blinking a bit too rapidly.
KAUFMAN (CONT'D)
You interrupted me. I was just
talking about how people can be
replaced. You don't want to be
replaced, do you?
CLIFF
(
Nervous) No.
KAUFMAN
No, and I don't want to replace
you. You have promise. A day may
come when you earn yourself some
responsibilities. Right now, the
responsibilities are mine. All
the responsibilities. It was my
ingenuity that took an old world
and made it into something new. I
put up fences to make it safe. I
hired soldiers and paid for their
training. I keep the people on the
streets away from us by giving them
their games and vices. It costs me
money! But I spend it because the
responsibility is mine! Now do you
understand "responsibility"?
CLIFF
Yes, but...
KAUFMAN
No buts.
CLIFF
But...
Kaufman looks disappointed. Taking Cliff by the arm, smiling
again, he leads him over to an outer door and opens it. An
armed SECURITY GUARD stands in the corridor outside.
KAUFMAN
Take him out with the rest of the
garbage. I won't be needing this
man anymore.

At the conference table, Sutherland sees the light coming in

CHOLO watches the GARDENER through the windshield.
CHOLO
If I don't have this truck, I'm no
different to Kaufman than that poor
Mexican bastard out there.
CLOSE ON: CHOLO'S WATCH. 11:20.
OXY
He's never gonna pay.
CHOLO
He knows it's his ass if he doesn't.
Cholo slides open a small window, grabs his crossbow, and
SHOOTS the Gardener in the head.
71
71
CHOLO checks his watch. 11:29. He speaks into a TRANSMITTER.
CHOLO
Mouse. Anything?
72

MOUSE stands in the shed, holding a transmitter of his own.
MOUSE
Not yet. No boat. No money. No
nothing.
73

PRETTY BOY
I'm telling you, he's never gonna
pay.
CHOLO
That's why we're here.
CHOLO looks out the window to the searchlight sweeping over
the military complex in the distance.

SLACK drives as RILEY monitors his "Game Boy".
RILEY
Shit. He's going to Ross Park.
SLACK
What's there?
RILEY
Powder magazine. Where they keep
the big boomers. Rockets. For Dead
Reckoning's cannons.

MOUSE looks at a GRIMY WINDOW as the SHADOW of a WALKER stops
just beyond the glass. Mouse FIRES a BURST shattering the
window and dropping the Walker.
Silence. Mouse takes a tentative step toward the window. A
SCRATCHING SOUND. SOMETHING climbs up onto the sill from
outside. Mouse raises his gun, but hesitates when he sees...
...it's a child. A GIRL SCOUT. It died at age nine, still
wearing its uniform. Now, it's voracious. It grabs Mouse's
gun-hand. The weapon FIRES harmlessly into the floor. Mouse
is about to be chomped when...
...a STALAGMITE OF GLASS in the top of the shattered window
drops, PIERCING the Girl Scout's head.
Mouse runs SCREAMING to the door, where he is grabbed by
another DEAD THING. And another. As he is TORN APART, he sees
that there are DOZENS MORE.
WHAM! The door SLAMS behind KAUFMAN as he enters the foyer.
KNIPP emerges from the rear.
KNIPP
Any word from Mister Denbo, sir?
KAUFMAN
No. Pack us up. We might have
to be leaving.
KNIPP
In the helicopters?
KAUFMAN
We'll only need one of them.
57.

PRETTY BOY eases the vehicle up the road to the complex of
buildings: ROSS PARK, a sprawling munitions depot.
The searchlight continues to sweep across the night, but NO
ONE is manning it. It's mounted to an automatic rotator on
the roof of the main building.
FOXY
Looks like no one's here.
The gates stand wide open. There's no sign of life.
CHOLO punches a button. The SIDE HATCH HISSES OPEN.
CHOLO
Foxy. You're elected. Get out there
and see what the fuck.
Foxy moves out through the open hatch.
CHOLO (CONT'D)
Somebody go out and help.
SCAR grabs his weapons.
SCAR
I'll go.

There are AUTOMOBILE TIRES, GARBAGE CANS, a rusted ANCHOR, a
sunken MOTOR BOAT, HUNDREDS of BEER BOTTLES...AND THOUSANDS
OF DEAD THINGS...WALKING...ON THE RIVER BOTTOM...following
BIG DADDY through the debris.

A knock on a door is answered by A MAN who looks a bit too
greasy to be important. SUTHERLAND is outside.
SUTHERLAND

your men?
GREASY MAN
Four hundred a day. Each.
STYLES
I'll pay you five thousand a day.
Each.

RILEY looks at his watch. 11:40.

FOXY

THE T-BIRD rumbles along a road lined with large HOMES, once
prized for their panoramic views. RILEY'S "Game Boy" BEEPS.

shadow of one of the houses.
RILEY (CONT'D)

STACKS OF MONEY and stuffs them into TWO PRADA DUFFELS.

In the cab, PRETTY BOY eases off the gas. CHOLO looks out the
windshield as the headlights strike...
CHOLO
Denbo. And his idiot. (Beat) Stop.
Gimme the mike.
The vehicle crunches to a stop forty yards away. Pretty
Boy hands Cholo a microphone. Cholo speaks into it.
CHOLO (CONT'D)
How'd you get up here, Riley?
INTERCUT: BETWEEN THE STREET AND DEAD RECKONING'S CAB.
RILEY
Grabbed the T-Bird.
CHOLO
What are you doin' up here?
RILEY
Tracking you. With this.
Riley holds up his "Game Boy". Cholo looks surprised.
RILEY (CONT'D)
Truck's got a little transmitter in
her belly. Sorry I never told you.
CHOLO
You were always a smart guy, Riley.
Much smarter'n me.
RILEY
You went and took off without
inviting us along.
CHOLO
You weren't around to get invited.
Anyway, I figured you wouldn't
want in on this.

RILEY
We want in on anything you got goin'.
CHOLO

FOXY
What're you, nuts?
CHOLO
Open up!
93

RILEY and CHARLIE step on board. PRETTY BOY is at the
controls. FOXY, ANCHOR, and SCAR stand nearby. Charlie is
grinning like a badly scarred Cheshire cat.
CHOLO
The hell you so happy about?
CHARLIE
Riley told me to smile. So's you'd
let us come in.
CHOLO
I'd rather have you in here than
out there.
KA-CHUNK! Cholo lifts his crossbow, pressing a loaded arrow
up under Riley's chin. BLOOD TRICKLES.
CHOLO (CONT'D)
Who's the smart one now?
Charlie is about to react when he feels Foxy's M-16 poking
into his back.
Cholo looks into Riley's eyes.
CHOLO (CONT'D)
Thought you were gonna quit. Here
you are still working for the man.
Kaufman sent you out here, didn't
he? To get the truck back.
RILEY
Yes.
64.
95
95
CHOLO cocks his head outside.
CHOLO
Who else is out there?
RILEY
Kaufman sent some guys with us.
We took care of `em. I know you
been up to Ross Park. Picked up
some Johnsons, huh?
CHOLO
Yup. Pretty Boy, set the cannons.

RILEY keeps cool.
RILEY
Don't do it, Cholo.
CHOLO
Kaufman's got it coming.

PRETTY BOY lifts a clear cover off a RED FIRING BUTTON.
RILEY
Hit the tower square, you'll kill a
lot of innocent people. Miss and
hit the city, you'll kill a lot of
our friends. Your beef's with
Kaufman, not them.
The turret on the roof GROANS as the cannons rotate.
CHOLO
He's killed a lot of our friends.
Every week we took out the garbage,
you and me. Every month I took out
Kaufman's garbage. People he wanted
off the streets. He turned me into a
goon and then he pissed all over me!
Foxy, keep `em covered.
CHOLO moves to the RED FIRING BUTTON.
CHOLO
When the smoke clears, I'm gonna
roll in, hit the bank, take the
money, and pick up any other fancy
shit I can get my hands on.
RILEY
There won't be any fancy shit left.
And money burns.
CHOLO
Not when you keep it in a safe.
103

ON THE CONTROL PANEL: A CLOCK CLICKS DOWN TO MIDNIGHT.
4...3...2...1...CHOLO reaches down and pushes the button.
66.
105

CHOLO punches the button again. Again. Nothing happens.
CHOLO
WHAT THE FUCK?
CHOLO'S eyes fall to the "Game Boy" in Riley's hand.
CHOLO
You did something, didn't you?
With your FUCKING TOY!
Riley pushes another button on the "Game Boy". Outside...
CHOLO charges RILEY. Grabs him around the throat.
CHOLO
Fix it!
RILEY
Not a chance.
Riley tosses the "Game Boy" out the open hatch. Cholo reaches
out after it.
109
109
FOXY, distracted by the mayhem, lets CHARLIE get the drop on
him. ANCHOR and SCAR go for their guns. RILEY unslings his
M-16 and holds them at bay.
RILEY
Easy boys.
Riley looks at the clock on the control panel. 12:01. Charlie
follows his gaze.
CHARLIE
Geez. We just made it.
Riley CLICKS the transmitter on.
RILEY
Riley Denbo calling the Green.
110
110
BING! KAUFMAN steps off the elevator, carrying his two Prada
bags full of money. A TWO-WAY RADIO in his pocket RINGS.
KAUFMAN
(Into radio, urgent) Yes?
RILEY (O.S.)
We got Cholo.
KAUFMAN
(Sagging with relief) I owe you,
Mister Denbo.
111
111
RILEY
I'm glad you feel that way. Because
I'm taking your fucking truck.
112
112
KAUFMAN rushes in with his bags, dropping them beside other
luggage that is already packed.
KNIPP
(Frightened) Mister Kaufman, sir. I
dunno what's happening, sir, but it
sounds bad.
68.
The windows are sealed so the NOISE Kaufman hears is MUFFLED,
but it is definitely the SOUND OF DISORDER. He goes to a
window. Looks down and sees...
...flashes of LIGHT from gunfire. SMOKE rising from an
EXPLOSION. PEOPLE running. THE DEAD swarming into the city
like ants. A war has begun.
114
114
THE SOUND OF RUMBLING. The CEILING VIBRATES, knocking tear-
shaped baubles off a CHANDELIER. The SOUND BUILDS in
intensity. Then suddenly eases off. Through the window,
KAUFMAN sees the things that caused the rumbling...
...TWO HELICOPTERS, SOARING off into the night.
KAUFMAN (CONT'D)
No. No. They can't leave. Not
without me!
KNIPP
I think they just did, sir.
116
116
RILEY closes the hatch. Blood trickles from under his chin
where Cholo stuck him with the crossbow.
SLACK reaches up and pulls off the bandana that holds back
her hair, which cascades down. She uses the fabric to clean
the blood off Riley's neck.
He looks at her, touched by the familiarity of the gesture.
SLACK
Almost lost you there.
RILEY
I don't get lost so easy. (To
PRETTY BOY) We gotta get across
the water.
PRETTY BOY
The bridges into the city are all
bricked up.
PRETTY BOY hits a button. A MAP appears on a MONITOR, showing
the "GOLDEN TRIANGLE" bordered by the rivers and the
barricaded bridges spanning them.
SLACK
We could blast our way through.
RILEY
Don't want to. If the stenches got
in, there's a war going on in the
city. We take any of those bridges
we'll end up right in the middle
of it.
Riley runs his finger along the monitor, outlining the
natural and man-made barriers that protect the triangle.
RILEY (CONT'D)
We've gotta come in above the
throat.
His finger continues down the monitor to "THE THROAT" at the
base of the triangle, where the long FENCE runs between the
two rivers.
RILEY (CONT'D)
What was built to keep folks safe
is gonna trap them inside. We've
gotta give them a way out.

CHOLO walks with determination along the deserted tracks
under the river.

RILEY reaches the control booth. Draws his .45, expecting
danger within. He steps through the opening...
...but nothing's there. Just a SPIDER WEB that sweeps over
his face as he moves toward a RED SWITCH that activates a
generator. He flips it. The motor roars to life.
He turns toward a giant lever that operates the roadbed. It
GROANS from disuse as he pulls it.

Hearing the scream, RILEY looks out the control booth window
and sees...
...SLACK being taken downstream.

KAUFMAN and KNIPP, carrying the Prada duffles, rush out of an
elevator with FOUR SECURITY GUARDS. Kaufman carries a gun.
T

KAUFMAN (CONT'D)
et back here! GET BACK HERE!
Kaufman FIRES THREE ROUNDS at the men! He's not a marksman,
but ONE of the GUARDS is WINGED. Whirls around and levels his
M-16 at Kaufman.
SECURITY GUARD
YOU STUPID OLD FUCK!
He's about to fire when Knipp steps in front of Kaufman.
KNIPP
DON'T SHOOT! (Grabbing Kaufman's
gun hand) Boss? Don't you shoot,
neither. We're all on the same
S
side. Least we're supposed to be.
ECURITY GUARD
I'm on my own side now.
The Guard takes off after his comrades.
CHOLO (O.S.)
Need some help, Mister K.?
Kaufman spins around to see CHOLO walking toward him across
the atrium.
CHOLO (CONT'D)
been bit, Mister K. I'm a dead
man, so I don't care about nothin'
no more. Still care about you,
though. I wanna make sure you come
to the same end as me.
LANG! CLANG! CLANG! The Dead Things at the glass doors are
POUNDING now with shovels, pickaxes, and lengths of pipe.
CHOLO (CONT'D)
hey're going to get you, Mister K.
want them to get you.
Kaufman raises his gun and aims at Cholo, who aims back with
his crossbow.

CHOLO (CONT'D)
ut it down, old man, unless you'd
rather die right now.
BIG DADDY appears outside the doors. Uses his pneumatic
hammer to POUND at the safety glass.
aufman can't take it anymore. He bolts for a stairway door.
Cholo shoots. An arrows hits Kaufman in the back of his left
calf. Kaufman sprawls, dropping both his bag of money and his
gun, which skitters Kaway. Knipp rushes over to help Kaufman.
NIPP
Just let us go, Mister DeMora. Let
us get out of here.
CHOLO
(Calmly reloading) You can go,
Knipp, but not him.
Kaufman shakes Knipp off. His gun is ten feet away. He heads
for it. Dragging himself on hands and knees.
CRUNCH! The chisel on Big Daddy's pneumatic hammer is the
first tool to PENETRATE the doors. The glass doesn't shatter;
it COBWEBS into tiny crystals stuck together by a thin
plasticine coating. ALARM BELLS SOUND!
Puzzled by the sudden transformation of the glass into
something that looks different, Big Daddy drops the pneumatic
hammer and reaches out. The glass is different. It's soft.
Flexible. Big Daddy POKES HIS HAND right through.
Kaufman has almost reached his gun. Cholo shoots another
arrow. This one hits Kaufman in the shoulder.
AUFMAN
You fucking spic bastard!
CHOLO
I think we should talk when you're
a little less excited.
Kaufman has a will of iron. He keeps going, gritting his
teeth against the pain, reaching out for his gun, as...
CRUNCH! CRUNCH! CRUNCH! More tools PENETRATE the doors. More
HANDS POKE through.
aufman looks at his worst nightmare...Dead Things ripping
their way through the cobwebbed doors, invading his temple.

The commotion distracts Cholo just long enough for Kaufman to
lift his gun and FIRE nine rounds.
ost of the shots miss. TWO hit Cholo, one in the belly, one
in the heart. He is slammed against the wall, his glazing
eyes staring up into the atrium, the place he so desired.
It's the last thing he sees before he keels over, dead.
Knipp pulls Kaufman onto his feet. They look up to see...
BIG DADDY leading his army into the atrium. Kaufman aims and
FIRES. A BULLET HITS BIG DADDY in the upper chest, blowing
DEAD FLESH out of his back. The Dead Man feels no pain, but
it focuses on Kaufman and starts after him with purpose.
Kaufman sees something in Big Daddy's eyes. Something that's
not dead. Kaufman fires again. CLICK! He's out of ammo.
K
NIPP
Boss. We gotta get outa here!
Knipp pulls Kaufman to a stairway door. They rush inside. The
moment they're out of sight, the Walkers forget about them,
moving on into the atrium. All except Big Daddy. That rage is
still in its face as he lumbers toward the stairway door.

KEYS TURN in the locks of cell doors, which SLACK and BRIAN
pull open. MULLIGAN and his REVOLUTIONARIES emerge. Mulligan
embraces his son and looks gratefully at Slack.
MULLIGAN
(To his men) Let's go get our guns,

THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD: RILEY looms larger and larger as the
vehicle closes in. He doesn't move. PRETTY BOY tries to turn
the wheel. Too late. RILEY DISAPPEARS!
HARLIE
(Pure anguish) RILEY!
Three seconds later, Riley's figure comes scrambling across
the windshield, climbing up toward...

FOOTSTEPS ECHO as KNIPP, carrying one of the Prada duffles,
helps the wounded KAUFMAN across an underground PARKING
GARAGE, a dark and spooky place, made more so by the SOUNDS
of distant SCREAMING. Kaufman disdainfully SNAPS OFF the
shanks of the arrows in his leg and shoulder.
The two men reach a stretch LINCOLN. Knipp BEEPS the doors
open and they get inside, Knipp behind the wheel, Kaufman in
the luxurious back compartment, where he pours himself a
scotch from the built-in bar.
Knipp starts the engine. The SOUND ECHOES big-time in the
concrete tomb.
NIPP
(Looking at the fuel gauge) We
eed gas.
Kaufman moans. Knipp steers the car slowly, carefully through
the shadows, pulling in beside a GASOLINE PUMP near the base
of a RAMP that leads up to the street. Knipp pushes a button
that pops open the gas tank. He shuts the engine off and gets
out, taking the keys, which have a Mag-Card attached to them.
H
e slides the Mag-Card into a slot, activating the pump. An
LED scrolls "Thank you, Mr. Kaufman". Knipp pulls the nozzle.
Freezes when he hears...
...FOOTSTEPS ECHOING. A DARK FIGURE is approaching through
the shadows.
nipp drops the nozzle. Ducks into the car. SLAMS the door.
WHAM! A SINGLE HAND SMACKS against the driver-side window.
A FACE leans in behind the hand. A face full of rage. BIG
DADDY'S FACE.
AUFMAN
Shoot it! Shoot the damn thing!

KNIPP
You didn't gimme no gun, sir.
Big Daddy moves to one of the rear windows. He can't see
inside. The window is tinted. He returns to the clear
windshield, looks back, at an angle, and sees Kaufman in the
rear compartment. Big Daddy recognizes him. From upstairs.
It's the man who shot him.
The Dead Thing looks up. Sees the gasoline pump. His hand
drops to the embroidery on its jump-suit..."Texaco". He moves
deliberately toward the pump.
KAUFMAN
Pull out! PULL OUT!
K
NIPP
Sorry, sir. Keys are in the pump.
Big Daddy sees the nozzle on the cement. Picks it up, feeling
the familiarity of it. Pulls the trigger. Gasoline squirts.
The rage in his face turns to a kind of satisfaction.
Using the nozzle as he did the pneumatic hammer, Big Daddy
POUNDS on the windshield, three times, before the SAFETY
GLASS COBWEBS. He POKES the nozzle through the flexible
fabric and pulls the trigger until it locks. Gasoline FLOODS
into the car.
KNIPP (CONT'D)
ord!
TCHUNG! Big Daddy pulls the driver side door open. As Knipp
tries to run, he is GRABBED by Big Daddy.
KNIPP (CONT'D)
ORD!
Big Daddy looks at the butler. Sniffs him. Then flings him
aside. Knipp is not his prey. With a glance at Kaufman,
cowering in the back seat, Big Daddy slams the car door and,
surprisingly, walks away. Up the ramp toward the street.
The nozzle remains stuck in the "fabric" of the windshield.
Gasoline continues to flow into the car. Kaufman crawls into
the front seat, wincing from his wounds, and KICKS the nozzle
out of the window with his good leg, getting soaked with gas
in the process. He opens the door. Limps to the pump. Grabs
the keys. As he starts back toward the car...
...WHAM! SOMETHING is standing right in front of him. It's
one of the WALKING DEAD. It's...

...CHOLO.
aufman shakes his head in disbelief.
KAUFMAN
N-no, y-you're dead. (Realization
dawning) Oh my God. You're dead!
THE CHOLO THING reaches for Kaufman, vengeance in its eyes.
aufman breaks for the driver's door. He never makes it. The
Cholo Thing grabs him and SLAMS him down across the hood.
Leans over him. Opens a drooling mouth. Kaufman whimpers.
B
RRRUMBLE-UMBLE-UMBLE! The SOUND of a bowling ball.
Kaufman looks up. It's not a bowling ball. It's an OIL POT,
rolled down the ramp by Big Daddy. Kaufman SCREAMS. The fire
ball approaches the gas-soaked Lincoln, the gas-soaked
Kaufman, and...
...WHOOOMPH! Kaufman and The Cholo Thing are IMMOLATED. The
FIREBALL removes everything from sight, except a few floating
HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS, burning in mid-air.
HROUGH LICKS OF FLAME we see...Big Daddy is almost smiling.

Riley picks up a pair of binoculars and looks through the

RILEY lowers the binoculars.
RILEY
All they want is somewhere to go.
Same as us.
CHARLIE
Canada. That's where we're goin',
ain't it, Riley?
RILEY
If no one has any objections.
ANCHOR, SCAR, and PILLSBURY all shrug. Riley looks at Slack.
SLACK
No, we'll take you along with us.
ILEY
I'll try to make myself useful.
To PRETTY BOY) Take us North.
