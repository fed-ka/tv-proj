SUPER: MARINE CORPS BASE, CAMP PENDLETON. OCEANSIDE, CA.
Then SUPER: THE DAY BEFORE...
We are CLOSE ON: SERGEANT MICHAEL NANTZ late 30s, tall,
battle-hardened, staring forward, listening impatiently.
1ST SGT. ROY (O.S.)
Must be some kind of mistake...
Company 1st SERGEANT JOHN ROY, also late 30s, sits behind his
desk, holding Nantz' file. Smiles.
1ST SGT. ROY
I got paperwork here, with your
signature, says you're retiring.
SGT. NANTZ
No mistake, John.
1ST SGT. ROY
My ass. You got a box full a',
medals, file full a' commendations.
(MORE)
2.
1ST SGT. ROY (cont'd)
Hell, everything but the Good
Conduct.
SGT. NANTZ
They can take the Good Conduct
Medal and shove it up their...
1ST SGT. ROY
(LAUGHS)
See, that's what I'm talking about,
Mike. You're a marine!
Nantzsmiles back now.
SGT. NANTZ
I appreciate it, John. You know
that. But, I been to too many
funerals. Had to visit too many
moms and dads, tell 'em about what
happened to their sons...
BEAT.
1ST SGT. ROY
Look. You're on that training
assignment right now. Why don't
you just ride it out for a month or
two. See how you feel...
SGT. NANTZ
I did my twenty. I'm done.
Roy takes this in, nods. He stands, holds his hand out.
1ST SGT. ROY
You're gonna miss it.
Nantz shakes.
SGT. NANTZ
Wanna bet?
CUT TO:
THE GREEN WASH OF NIGHT VISION GOGGLES
Looking out onto ROLLING HILLS and TREES... We hear (O.S.) :
VOICE #1 (O.S.)
I don't see it...
VOICE #2 (O.S.)
I'm telling you, it's in the trees.
3.
FIVE MARINES
From the 1st Platoon, 2nd battalion, 5th Marines (the 2/5)..
Camo uniforms, NIGHT VISION GOGGLES on, stare into the DARK.
CPL. CORREGGIO, 20, linebacker-big, shakes his head,
frustrated.
CPL. CORREGGIO
Screw it. I'm gonna launch another
one...
The other marines back away quickly as...
WIDEN to see we're...
A modest working-class two bedroom apartment. A TELEVISION
on in the b.g.. A NEWS PROGRAM:
NEWSCASTER (ON TV)
.what appears to be an
unprecedented meteor shower,
falling off the Falkland Islands.
7.
LT. BENNIE MARTINEZ, 25, whose youthful looks and open smile
contrast with his muscular frame, rolls in bed to see...
His wife, ANNA, 24, sitting on the edge of the bed next to
him, turning something over in her hands.
LT. MARTINEZ
What are you doing up so early?
She holds up the object in her hands-- It's Martinez'
LIEUTENANT BARS.
ANNA
(OBVIOUSLY PROUD)
Lieutenant. I still have to get
used to that.
She kisses him lightly, stands. Martinez smiles, watching
her move off.
LT. MARTINEZ
Yeah, lot of things we gotta get
used to.
We see her VERY PREGNANT BELLY now as she smiles back, exits.
As she does, Martinez turns back to the TELEVISION:
'METEORS' falling into a distant ocean.
NEWSCASTER (V.0.)
This dazzling display is visible
from Argentina to Southern Chile.
We recognize two marines from 1st platoon: CPL. DEVREY
HARRIS, 22, African-American, steely, quick-witted, and CPL.
NICK STAVROU, 23, a Greek hulk with an easy smile.
Harris stares at a TELEVISION on a table behind the counter.
NEWSCASTER (V.0.)
.meteors are falling off the
coasts of California, Ireland,
India, in the Bay of Bengal-- all
less than ten miles from land...
CPL. STAVROU
Man, I thought Lenihan was gonna
wash out today.
CPL. HARRIS
Hey, I remember carrying your fat
ass up that hill hung over as shit.
Newbie gets no sympathy from me.
11.
A woman, CHERISE, 22, Harris' fiancee, hurries over.
CHERISE
For three hundred more, she said we
could have sprays of lilies. I
know it's a lot, but it'd be so
beautiful. What d'you think, baby?
Harris looks pained. But before he can speak up:
CPL. STAVROU
Well, I think it's a no-brainer.
You're only getting married once!
What, are you gonna worry about
three hundred bucks?
Cherise looks expectantly to Harris, who smiles back weakly.
CPL. HARRIS
Of course, baby. Whatever you want
She kisses him, heads to the florist as Harris turns on
STAVROU:
CPL. HARRIS
Dude, what are you doing?
CPL. STAVROU
Busting your balls.
CHERISE
(CALLS OVER)
Tomorrow we shop for cake.
Stavrou throws an arm round Harris' shoulder, smiles.
CPL. STAVROU
I love cake.
A drab, nondescript office. Kerns sits across a desk from
the BASE PSYCHIATRIST, who's consulting a FILE.
PSYCHIATRIST
Still not sleeping... And the
nightmares?
PVT. KERNS
No. I mean, sometimes. But it's
no big deal.
12.
PSYCHIATRIST
You're not drinking, right,
private? That's just a crutch...
PVT. KERNS
Alcohol? No, sir. Definitely not.
The psychiatrist stares at this. Then WRITES in the file.
PVT. KERNS
So... What's my status? Am I
cleared for combat? I feel good.
PSYCHIATRIST
(STILL WRITING)
Let's meet again next week.
Roy drives back to base, Nantz next to him. SIRENS are
wailing, HELICOPTERS TAKING OFF in the distance.
1ST SGT.. ROY
Meteor storm's hittin' up and down
California now... All I know is,
this is a helluva lot more than
just some space rocks fallin' out
to sea...
SGT. NANTZ
What d'you mean?
He turns., stares at Nantz.
1ST SGT. ROY
Whole base is being mobilized.
There's some kinda' bad shit
hittin' the fan.
1ST SGT. ROY
You're assigned to 1st platoon,
under Lt. Bennie Martinez. His
platoon sergeant was rushing back
to base, got in a car accident.
SGT. NANTZ
What are the odds?
As the Humvee pulls to the COMMAND BUILDING, Nantz sees...
LT. MARTINEZ hurrying to meet them.
1ST SGT. ROY
There's the lieutenant. Young,
been with us three months, straight
outta basics school. Bright kid,
but this is his first deployment,
so keep an eye on him, Mike.
15.
Lenihan and Imlay, Correggio and Kerns are getting their gear
together, hurriedly packing.
Lenihan checks and double checks a LIST with the contents of
his pack, ticking off 'poncho liner,' 'gore-tex jacket,'
'socks,' 'vest,' 'first aid kit,' flashlight'...
PVT. KERNS
It's probably just a drill, right?
PVT. IMLAY
They shifted Nantz into our unit.
Something must be going on.
PVT. LENIHAN
I heard Nantz kicked ass on his
last tour. Went into a compound by
himself, killed, like, ten
insurgents...
CPL. CORREGGIO
That what you heard? You don't
know shit, Lenihan.
Correggio, pissed, grabs his pack, heads for the door.
CPL. CORREGGIO
Move your asses. They want us in
the armory.
And he's gone. Lenihan, confused, looks at Imlay.
PVT. LENIHAN
What's his problem?
PVT. IMLAY
Nantz lost a lotta guys on that
tour. Correggio's brother was one
of 'em.
Lenihan nods, somber, getting it.
Nantz and Martinez walk through quickly. All around them,
NUMEROUS OFFICERS hurry, all responding to RINGING BEEPERS.
Nantz peers into VARIOUS OFFICES. Every one is buzzing with
activity: Clerks bustling, maps spread out, phones ringing.
16.
And every office has a TELEVISION on. We hear OVERLAPPING.
REPORTER'S VOICES from the offices they pass:
TV REPORTERS (V.0.)
.cluster of what appears to be
meteors is tightly packed... hard
for scientists to predict the size
or quantity striking the oceans...
SGT. NANTZ
They calling us.in because of these
meteors, Lieutenant?
LT. MARTINEZ
I assume so... Maybe an evacuation.
Whatever it is, it'll be good to
get out in the field with the men.
Nantz looks askance at this. Martinez catches it.
LT. MARTINEZ
Look, Sergeant, let's be clear. I
know your rep, know what you've
done... But this is my unit. We're
not gonna have a problem, are we?
SGT. NANTZ
No problem, sir. It's all yours.
At numerous windows,. LINES OF MARINES hand in weapons cards,
receiving their weapons in return. Among them...
The marines from 1st Platoon of the 2/5 (Correggio and Kerns,
Stavrou and Harris, Imlay and Lenihan, Adukwu), all watching:
MOUNTED TELEVISIONS-- A WOMAN REPORTER, 20s, on a BEACH.
Behind her, POLICE disperse thin CROWDS of PEOPLE, bullhorns
blaring. A legend on the TV screen reads 'SANTA MONICA, CA.'
PVT. MOTTOLA, squad radio man, tall and thin, listening to an
IPOD, and PVT. GUERRERO, lumbering, eyes on the TV.
PVT. MOTTOLA
We never got a chance to finish the
new mix, man. We were gonna add
some metal to it...
PVT. GUERRERO
We'll have time later.
17.
The marines stare at the harried reporter on TV.
REPORTER (ON TV)
.National Guard troops have flown
in to evacuate all surrounding
beach areas...
PVT. MOTTOLA
(TREPIDATION)
Yeah... Later.
Nantz and Martinez crowd in among other SERGEANTS and
LIEUTENANTS, the COMPANY CAPTAIN briefing them.
CAPTAIN
These objects were completely
undetected until they entered our
atmosphere.
LT. MARTINEZ
So... what are they, Captain?
CAPTAIN
We have no idea. But whatever they
are, they're not hitting the water
at terminal velocity. They're able
to slow down before impact.
Glances exchanged in the room now.
CAPTAIN
This is no meteor shower. Homeland
Security has bumped the threat
level to red. Marines, we are the
first line of defense. All units
gear up, be ready to move.
The young marines from 1st platoon are still in line for
their weapons along with many OTHER MARINES. Some are
nervously bullshitting, others intently watching...
THE TELEVISION:
The REPORTER on the beach looks harried now as THICK SMOKE
rolls in across the water. POLICE SIRENS wail in the b.g.
I
18.
REPORTER (ON TV)
.some sort of smoke has appeared
over the ocean now...
CPL. HARRIS
Hey, shut up. Shut up!
Others quiet down now. All focus slowly shifting to...
THE TV:
The reporter on the beach is cupping her earpiece.
REPORTER (ON TV)
I'm being told a Coast Guard cutter
just issued a Mayday...
The TV SHOT PANS to the WATER...
The DISTANT CUTTER lists to one side, SINKING below the waves
as indistinct DARK SHAPES clamber onto it from the water.
THE MARINES
Push forward, scrambling to the TVs.
PVT. KERNS
What the hell are those things?!
ON THE TV:
The CUTTER DISAPPEARS behind the thick rolling SMOKE.
The camera PANS back to the REPORTER, silently staring out.
2/5 PARADE DECK / CAMP PENDLETON - SAME
Crowded with MARINES, including squad leader Grayston, all
getting ready. Or they were...
Right now, ACTIVITY HAS CEASED. Marines silently stare at...
TELEVISIONS
The REPORTER ON THE BEACH staring out, clearly panicked.
REPORTER (ON TV)
It appears... the cutter has...
She stops, seeing the SMOKE reach the WATER'S EDGE. A HUSH
falls over the CROWD as SMOKE rolls across the beach.
19.
Formerly bustling... Now all OFFICERS and MARINES are frozen,
crowding around open office doors, staring at...
TELEVISIONS
As the REPORTER reacts to isolated SHOUTS echoing from the
crowd on the beach. Some are pointing out to the ocean...
REPORTER (ON TV)
What is that...? In the water...
The news cameraman PANS to the WATER as it begins to CHURN.
Nantz and Martinez stand among the other sergeants and
lieutenants staring, stunned, at...
A TELEVISION:
SCREAMS and panicked voices ring out from those ON THE BEACH
now as INDISTINCT FIGURES appear from under the waves.
PEOPLE RACE AWAY, plodding along the sand in hopeless flight
as these FIGURES charge into the crowd...
GUNSHOTS ring out, police shooting at the INDISTINCT FIGURES
that appear, then disappear in the EVER-THICKENING SMOKE.
MOVE IN ON NANTZ, staring at the TV as...
The news cameraman RUNS away now, the PICTURE being
transmitted growing shaky, indistinct, frenzied as...
A DARK FIGURE appears, overruns the cameraman as...
The NEWS CAMERA suddenly cuts to BLACK. In black, all we
hear is SCREAMS echoing from the beach.
IN FLIGHT. The marines, helmets on, packs between their
knees, sit facing each other.
The sound of the CH-46's massive rotors is deafening. Some
shout over the din, too nervous to remain quiet.
PVT. GUERRERO
What the hell you think those
things are?
CPL. HARRIS
Gotta be extraterrestrial.
21.
PVT. IMLAY
You mean, like, from space?!
CPL. STAVROU
No, Imlay. From Canada.
Correggio looks down at his hand... Sees the GIRL'S PHONE
NUMBER written on it.
ACROSS THE DECK, Martinez huddles with Nantz, MAP in hand.
LT. MARTINEZ
Santa Monica airport's our Forward
Operating Base. We get some Cobras
and F-18s in the air, we'll have
plenty of support.
Nantz nods. They're flying into the unknown and Martinez
seems as nervous as the younger men.
Kerns leans in to Nantz, desperately needing reassurance.
PVT. KERNS
How many a' them you think there
are, Sergeant?
Nantz just stares out, stone-faced.
SGT. NANTZ
We'll know soon enough, private.
The marines are glued to the windows, shocked by what they're
seeing as the chopper BANKS toward Venice/Santa Monica:
FIRES raging from various explosions. In the distance,
MASSIVE LINES of TRAFFIC moving away from the ocean.
The STREETS bordering the beach look deserted-- Except for
the BODIES dotting the landscape.
Nantz looks at Martinez, who is hunched over, scribbling a
LETTER. Martinez folds it, then writes the name ANNA on it.
We realize it's a letter in the event of his death.
Martinez stares at the letter. Then carefully tucks it away.
CUT TO:
22.
Nantz shoulders his M-16. Martinez eyes him.
SGT. NANTZ
I'll go for Lenihan, sir.
33.
LT. MARTINEZ
All right. We'll package the
wounded, then rally on 10th street.
(TURNS)
Mottola, Imlay. Go with the
sergeant.
The two quickly step to Nantz.
PVT. IMLAY
We got your six, Sergeant.
Anything you need.
SGT. NANTZ
What I need is for you to keep
quiet. And stay close.
PVT. IMLAY
Right. Got it. Quiet.
SGT. NANTZ
Starting now, Private.
As Nantz turns, Mottola slaps Imlay in the helmet.
Lenihan creeps around the garage, spies a SIDE DOOR leading
into it. He grabs the handle. Mercifully, the door opens.
Lenihan falls INTO THE DARK GARAGE. Boxes and old furniture.
Just one dirt-stained WINDOW on an opposite wall.
Lenihan crouches in the dim light, coughs, spitting up blood.
He turns on his radio, says into it:
PVT. LENIHAN
Motorola? You copy?
His RADIO buzzes back with Nantz' voice:
SGT. NANTZ (V.0.)
Lenihan. This is Sgt. Nantz...
PVT. LENIHAN
Sergeant, Jesus, I had to turn the
radio off..'. These things are
everywhere!
34.
Lenihan looks across the garage, out of the window...
PVT. LENIHAN
I'm in a garage... I can see two
palm trees right next to it. House
is white with black shutters...
Just as something BANGS against the garage.
SGT. NANTZ (V.0.)
Is the house a two-story?
Lenihan stares, his eyes going wide, panicked.
SGT. NANTZ (V.O.)
Lenihan, is the house a...?
Lenihan CLICKS the radio OFF.
Then waits, very still, listening, M-16 held tightly. His
breathing turns shallow-- from loss of blood and from fear.
Lenihan sees the BRANCHES of a bush SWAYING outside the
window, as if something just brushed past it.
Lenihan moves TO THE WINDOW, searching the garage floor,
desperate not to step on anything that would make noise. He
edges forward to peer through the dirty glass. Then...
THUD THUD THUD. More NOISES... On the garage roof now.
Lenihan looks up, panicked as...
CRASH! The WINDOW suddenly CRASHES IN.
Lenihan spins, FIRING wildly, lighting up the garage as...
He stumbles to the door, fumbling for the handle, falling...
The marines burst in, looking around. To the right, a GYM.
To the left, a HALLWAY with numerous side rooms off of it.
SGT. NANTZ
U.S. Marines! U.S. Marines!
A clattering. The marines immediately move toward it,
peering down the dark hall...
39.
Then the DOOR to a side room OPENS to reveal...
A WOMAN, MICHELE, 28, staring out, looking shell-shocked.
SGT. NANTZ
How many of you?
A MAN, JOE RINCON, 45, jacket and tie, behind her.
MICHELE
There's five of us. Three kids.
Nantz is immediately moving.
SGT. NANTZ
Where? Where are the kids?
He pushes past the adults, sees TWO GIRLS AND A BOY, 8-10.
The marines and civilians fall into the large entryway. The
marines are breathing hard, looking stunned.
PVT. KERNS
Goddamn flying saucers now...?!
ADUKWU
All those guys on the chopper...
PVT. IMLAY
Why'd those bastards have to come
down here and start this shit?!
SGT. NANTZ
That is not relevant, Imlay!
They're here. They're trying to
kill us. Kill them first!
Martinez eyes Nantz on this. Then barks orders:
LT. MARTINEZ
Secure the perimeter! Stavrou,
give me an ammo check. Cpl.
Correggio, take three men, set up
an Observation Post on the roof.
SGT. NANTZ
You heard the lieutenant. Move!
The dazed marines begin COVERING doors and hallways. We see
in their FACES that it's a very different fight now.
Nantz turns, can see the MEDEVAC ABLAZE out a window. His
solemn stare hints at a growing desperation.
Martinez steps up to him, looks out. Quietly:
LT. MARTINEZ
They got air power, too... Knocked
that medevac right out of the sky.
So much for ruling the air.
Nantz just keeps staring out.
42.
LT. MARTINEZ
Listen, Sergeant. These men are
scared. A little compassion would
go a long way...
Nantz turns on Martinez now.
SGT. NANTZ
How's that gonna help them survive,
Lieutenant?
(BEAT)
I'll lead these marines. But don't
ask me to get close to them.
Nantz walks off.
Marines on post, watching various windows and doors.
Imlay kneels by the kids, who look devastated by the day's
events. Imlay wets a rag with water from his canteen, wiping
the dust and dirt from the kids' faces.
The younger girl, KIRSTEN, 8, begins crying. She suddenly
hugs Imlay.
Imlay, startled by this, looks uncomfortable at first. Then
hugs the little girl back, smiling at the older.girl, ANY,
10, Kirsten's sister.
AMY
You're not gonna leave us, are you?
A beat. Then Imlay smiles.
PVT. IMLAY
No way, sweetheart.
The woman, Michele McDermott, is clearly rattled, struggling
for composure, eyes constantly moving to the kids.
Mr. Rincon, a calm, watchful air about him, stands with his
son, HECTOR, the kid who Nantz had carried to the chopper.
RINCON
My son and I came here... There
were only three cops, spread pretty
thin... Then those things attacked.
Police couldn't stop them.
43.
SGT. NANTZ
What happened to everyone?
RINCON
I don't know. Most people ran. We
hid in a side room, found Michele
and the girls... Couldn't see what
happened. Just heard... Screams.
MICHELE
I have my nieces for the week. My
sister and her husband are in
Hawaii for their anniversary... Is
it safe there? I heard this is
happening in other places...
Martinez is at a loss for words.
MICHELE
What do they want from us? Why are
they here?
LT. MARTINEZ
I...don't know. Right now, our job
is just to get you to safety, okay?
Harris appears from the hallway.
CPL. HARRIS
Lieutenant, something you should
see...
Hector sits with Kirsten and Amy, digging candy Nerds out of
his backpack. He turns to the other kids, holding the box
out. Both kids reflexively accept handfuls of candy.
44
Then Hector notices Imlay standing nearby.
HECTOR
Want some Nerds?
Imlay holds his hand out. Hector shakes candy into it as...
Nantz enters, calling to Adukwu:
SGT. NANTZ
Adukwu, bring your kit.
Adukwu is immediately up, moving to Nantz.
SGT. NANTZ
We're gonna cut one of these things
open. See if we can figure out
what makes 'em tick.
Michele overhears, offering:
MICHELE
Maybe I can help, sergeant. I'm a
vet...
SGT. NANTZ
You're a veteran?
MICHELE
(can't help but smile)
No, a veterinarian.
SGT. NANTZ
Oh... Okay. Well, thanks, um...
Nantz has forgotten her name. She smiles.
MICHELE
Michele.
SGT. NANTZ
Right. Michele.
(smiles, embarrassed))
Sorry.
Mottola walks up.
PVT. MOTTOLA
Sergeant. Can't raise anybody on
the radio. We're cut off.
Off Nantz' look...
45.
Nantz enters with Michele and Adukwu. Stavrou and Harris are
in the room with Martinez. They step aside, revealing... The
ALIEN BODY on the floor.
Michele stops, stares. She and Adukwu are both taken aback
at the sight of one of these things up close.
SGT. NANTZ
You sure you can do this?
MICHELE
I was more sure two minutes ago.
She looks to Adukwu. They step to the body together as...
Nantz approaches Martinez.
SGT. NANTZ
What's the plan, Lieutenant?
LT. MARTINEZ
Mission is still to get the
civilians to the Forward Operating
Base. We've got a battalion there,
all that firepower... I was
thinking, I saw a bus couple of
blocks back on 11th...
SGT. NANTZ
Maybe we should stay on foot.
Martinez looks at Nantz. Then opens a MAP, pointing to
'Santa Monica Airport' on it.
LT. MARTINEZ
The FOB is here, at the airport...
That's miles to cover with those
kids... And those bombs are gonna
drop in a little more than an hour.
(thinking, deciding)
We've got to move fast.
SGT. NANTZ
We have no radio contact, nothing
to let us know the best route to
take... And a bus is a big target.
LT. MARTINEZ
I made the call, Sergeant. It's my
responsibility.
47.
Beat. Then Nantz nods, turns.
SGT. NANTZ
Harris, Stavrou, lieutenant needs
recon on a.bus. It was abandoned
two blocks south off 11th...
LT. MARTINEZ
If it runs, get it back here.
SGT. NANTZ
Can you hotwire a bus?
CPL. HARRIS
(gestures to Stavrou)
He's from Jersey, sergeant.
A nod from Nantz on this.
Stavrou and Harris peer out an EXTERIOR DOOR as they hear
Correggio (V.0.) from the RADIO:
CPL. CORREGGIO (V.0.)
.you're clear down 11th Street.
They exchange a quick glance.
CPL. STAVROU
Every day a holiday, buddy...
CPL. HARRIS
.every meal a feast.
They slip outside, running off silently.
Adukwu and Michele, scalpels in hand, hover over the alien
body. Its thick leathery skin has been sliced open.
Martinez and Nantz observe, Imlay on post nearby.
LT. MARTINEZ
How's it going?
ADUKWU
Well, Lieutenant, I'm a medic, Dr.
McDermott's a vet... We weren't
sure who was most qualified to cut
this thing open.
Martinez smiles.
ADUKWU
Look. It's been surgically
modified...
He pulls tissue aside, revealing where the alien's 'gun' is
attached to its arm.
ADUKWU
Part of its arm has been amputated
to fit this weapon.
SGT. NANTZ
Talk about commitment to cause.
Adukwu examines a VENTED CAP just to the right of where the
alien's 'heart' would be. Thick, fleshy veins run from it.
LT. MARTINEZ
What is that thing?
PVT. IMLAY
He's from Nigeria, Lieutenant. Not
a different solar system.
Nantz looks over at Imlay.
SGT. NANTZ
Thank you, private.
Adukwu twists the cap. It comes free, revealing...
A GELATINOUS ORGAN. Slimy, viscous fluid seeping from it..
Everyone steps back, reacting to the putrid smell.
49.
PVT. IMLAY
Whoa, that stinks!
Everyone steps back except Michele, that is. Unfazed, she
takes her scalpel, makes an INCISION across the organ.
PVT. IMLAY
I'm gonna puke. Swear to God, I'm
gonna puke!
SGT. NANTZ
Whatever you do, do it quietly,
Imlay.
Michele finishes her incision, carefully PEELS A SECTION OF
THE ORGAN BACK.
Something vaguely METALLIC is revealed within it.
As Michele touches her scalpel to it, it SPARKS.
Then starts rhythmically GLOWING.
LT. MARTINEZ
Looks like it's receiving a
signal...
Suddenly, the ORGAN CONVULSES rapidly. Expanding,
contracting.
Nantz sees the ALIEN'S GUN VIBRATING now, the whole arm
TWITCHING, spreading through the alien's body like a seizure.
LT. MARTINEZ
This thing's still alive!
Nantz pulls his KA-BAR FIGHTING KNIFE, thrusting it DEEP INTO
THE ORGAN, twisting viciously.
51.
The organ stops vibrating. The glow fades. The body slumps.
SGT. NANTZ
Not so hard to kill when you know
where to aim.
Mottola appears in the room, a sense of controlled panic.
PVT. MOTTOLA
Lieutenant. There's a breach.
The marines step from the side room with Michele. They peer
up and down the dark hallway, listening...
OTHER DOORS along the hall take on an ominous presence now.
SGT. NANTZ
(LOW)
They in the building?
PVT. MOTTOLA
No clue, Sergeant. An exterior
door was broken open.
SGT. NANTZ
Lieutenant. Maybe we should gather
the civilians in the gym.
LT. MARTINEZ
Good idea, Sergeant.
Stavrou, still beneath the wheel. Harris, eyes on the street
as the RADIO crackles with Correggio's VOICE:
CPL. CORREGGIO (V.0.)
Harris, hostiles advancing right at
you. Approximately two hundred
meters and closing...
CPL. STAVROU
Done!
Stavrou hops into the driver's seat, tries to start the bus.
It doesn't turn over.
Harris and Stavrou exchange a quick glance. Stavrou drops
below the wheel again...
53.
More ominous BANGS ring out from down the long hallway,
BUILDING in intensity.
Nantz stands, staring DOWN THE DARK HALL with his M-16,
surprised as Martinez steps up next to him.
LT. MARTINEZ
We're in it together, Sergeant.
Martinez slams a grenade into his launcher now.
LT. MARTINEZ
C'mon, Mottola. Get that bus here!
Mottola is on the radio, frantic:
PVT. MOTTOLA
Where the hell is that bus?!
Stavrou is still underneath the wheel. Harris looks out to
see ALIENS rounding the corner in the distance.
CPL. HARRIS
Get this thing started.
CPL. STAVROU
Hey, why didn't I think a' that?
CRACK! Down the hall, the sound of a door splintering...
SGT. NANTZ
We're out of time!
Martinez looks INTO THE GYM, sees the kids staring back.
LT. MARTINEZ
Go! Get 'em out!
Imlay swings the GYM DOOR OPEN, moving the civilians out.
IN THE LOBBY
Nantz and Martinez stand together, aiming at the hall as...
A final BANG... We hear a door being BURST OPEN.
55.
Nantz, in the front, exchanges a glance with Martinez at the
ominous sight of...
A PLUME OF BLACK SMOKE rising in the distance.
THEY SPIN ONTO LINCOLN BOULEVARD.
Screech to a halt at the obstacle course of BATTLE WRECKAGE
strewn across the street.
Noxious BLACK SMOKE is rising from BURNING HUMVEES and
TRUCKS. Smoking CRATERS pothole the street.
LT. MARTINEZ
(SHOCKED)
Jesus Christ. Those alien ships
took the whole line out.
SGT. NANTZ
We've got forty minutes 'til they
level this area.
LT. MARTINEZ
(TO STAVROU)
Get us to the Forward Operating
Base. Fast.
Stavrou lays on the gas, speeding away as, in the back, the
other marines stare out. Mottola peers into the sky...'
PVT. MOTTOLA
Where the hell are all our jets?
Martinez is in the front with Stavrou, Nantz in the middle of
the bus, hovering near the civilians sitting on the floor.
Rincon holds Hector, Michele with her arms around both girls.
Marines on the seats above, weapons ready.
Nantz hears Imlay whispering to Harris:
PVT. IMLAY
Why the hell'd the lieutenant wanna
take a bus? We're sittin' ducks.
56.
SGT. NANTZ
(low, hard)
The call's been made, private. You
so eager to decide the fate of all
these people?
Imlay is stone silent.
SGT. NANTZ
Didn't think so.
Then Nantz looks up, meeting eyes with Martinez as...
A NOISE in the distance now. A low VIBRATION, building.
Nantz moves to Martinez. They peer out of the front.
LIGHTS fill the sky, heading east. As they approach...
The VIBRATION gets louder and louder, shaking the bus now.
SGT. NANTZ
Everybody get down, weapons inside
the bus. Make no noise.
The men pull their guns in from the windows, crouching as low
as possible, straining to see, hear...
The vibrations grow louder, LOUDER! Suddenly... WHOOSH!
An ALIEN AIRCRAFT rips overhead.
Then another, and another, and another... All heading east.
The image of their speed, their power, their other-
worldliness is overwhelming, devastating.
Nantz stares, relief flooding his face, as the armada flies
on. Leaving them behind. Until...
Suddenly, Mottola's RADIO BLARES!
COMMAND
(FROM RADIO)
All stations this net, urgent
traffic. Multiple enemy aircraft
moving east...
As the transmission rings out, Nantz looks up to see...
One ALIEN SHIP split from the armada, TURN BACK TO THE BUS.
57.
LT. MARTINEZ
It's coming back...!
The children scream, marines agitated... all hear a low
vibration, echoing off buildings, heading their way.
SGT. NANTZ
(staring at the radio,
REALIZING)
Kill that radio!
Mottola turns off the radio.
The alien aircraft STOPS. Hovers a moment.
SGT. NANTZ
They're tracking our signals! All
radios, cell phones-- keep
everything off!
Everyone stares silently, tensely. Then...
A single BEAM OF LIGHT suddenly shines from the alien craft.
Then the alien aircraft MOVES FORWARD again. Slowly. But
still heading their way.
LT. MARTINEZ
It's still coming... It's
searching...
Nantz grabs a PORTABLE RADIO.
He looks around the bus, sees the little girl, Kirsten,
ponytail in her hair. He leans down to her.
SGT. NANTZ
Hi. Could I have your, uh, hair
thing?
She stares, wide-eyed, at this fearsome, sweating marine.
KIRSTEN
My... pony holder?
Nantz nods. She pulls the PONY TAIL HOLDER from her hair,
hands it to Nantz. He smiles. Briefly. Heads to the front.
SGT. NANTZ
Anything happens, Lieutenant, get
the SAWS up front and take off with
these kids.
58.
LT. MARTINEZ
Sergeant...
BUT NANTZ IS OUT OF THE BUS.
Amy and Kirsten pressed under seats, Michele covering them
up... Hector closing his eyes in his dad's arms...
The marines duck low, gripping their weapons.
They hear the aircraft coming closer, almost above them.
LIGHT starts shining through the windows as...
Hector's eyes widen, staring up at the light. Michele pulls
the girls in closer, trying to calm them, herself.
MICHELE
(WHISPERING)
It's gonna be okay, it's gonna be
okay, it's all gonna be okay.
Everyone freezes as the BEAM reflects off the walls, filling
the space with a horrible bright light, exposing them as...
59.
Marines ducking, civilians screaming as...
DEBRIS from the alien ship BLOWS OVER THE BUS, burning pieces
falling to the ground...
Nantz runs back onto the bus as Stavrou pulls swiftly away.
SGT. NANTZ
(TO MARTINEZ)
That ship was an unmanned drone,
lieutenant. And that alien we cut
open had something in it receiving
signals... They must have one
helluva command and control center.
Martinez pulls his map out, eyes Nantz.
LT. MARTINEZ
That was some real John Wayne shit,
Sergeant.
Nantz tries to shrug it away. But Martinez nails him.
LT. MARTINEZ
Don't do it again. We work as a
team, Sergeant. We clear?
Beat. Nantz nods.
SGT. NANTZ
We're clear, Lieutenant.
Nearby, Imlay whispers to Mottola:
PVT. IMLAY
Who's John Wayne?
Martinez looks up from the map, turns to Stavrou.
LT. MARTINEZ
Take the freeway, Corporal. Cuts
half the distance off our drive.
SGT. NANTZ
Sir. We get on that freeway, we'll
be exposed...
LT. MARTINEZ
It doesn't seem like we're much
safer out here. We've got two
shitty options-- I'm choosing the
one that gets us there fastest.
(then, quietly)
We don't want to be in this area
when the bombs start to fall.
61.
Martinez and Nantz crouch near the front, keeping watch.
From this elevated vantage point on the freeway, the big
picture emerges IN THE DISTANCE:
The BATTLE FRONT is moving east... A DEFENSIVE LINE of TANKS
is visible, blasting away at aliens.
SWARMS of DRONE AIRCRAFT engage F-18 JETS flying at them.
LT. MARTINEZ
Jesus...
(TO STAVROU)
Double time, Corporal.
The bus barrels forward, careening BETWEEN CARS, knocking
some out of the way.
LT. MARTINEZ
Take the next exit. Head south.
We're two clicks from the FOB.
The bus drives onto the shoulder, past the sea of abandoned
cars, heading to the off-ramp.
Nantz appears uneasy. They are exposed on this freeway and
he doesn't like it.
He MOVES TO THE BACK, peering out windows, checking angles.
Michele looks up as he passes, sees a GASH on Nantz' head.
MICHELE
Your head, Sergeant. You're
bleeding.
Nantz touches his head, looks at the blood. He wipes it on
his pants. Michele smiles at him softly.
MICHELE
Bet when you woke up this morning,
you didn't think your day would end
up like this.
SGT. NANTZ
That's a pretty safe bet.
63.
SGT. NANTZ
Hostiles. Back up. Now, go!
Stavrou guns the BUS BACKWARDS, knocking abandoned cars out
of the way...
LT. MARTINEZ
Guess you were right, Sergeant.
CPL. STAVROU
Incoming! Down! Down! Down!
A projectile EXPLODES next to the bus! Sending CARS FLYING!
SHRAPNEL TEARS A GIANT HOLE through the side of the bus.
TWO 2nd SQUAD MARINES are instantly killed, blown clear out
of the hole. Civilians screaming...
Stavrou hits the gas, BACKING THE BUS UP the best he can.
An ILLUMINATION heading toward them... BOOM!
Another projectile DESTROYS AN OVERPASS behind the bus!
Trapped. And ALIENS are STREAMING AT THEM in the distance.
Stavrou works the shift, grinding gears, gunning the bus...
BEHIND A CONCRETE DIVIDER close by the COLLAPSED OFF-RAMP.
The off-ramp now dangles precariously: a 15-foot cliff-face
of missile-scarred concrete and re-bar.
Martinez looks over to Nantz, not sure what to do...
SGT. NANTZ
(to Martinez, low)
Let's dismount, set up a perimeter,
get the civilians down to the
street.
LT. MARTINEZ
Stavrou, get down that ramp, secure
the street! Kerns, Adukwu, help
get the civilians off the freeway.
Stavrou starts off the bus for the broken off-ramp.
LT. MARTINEZ
Harris, Imlay, give us overwatch up
on the roof. The rest of you push
out 20 meters, set up a perimeter.
64.
SGT. NANTZ
And don't forget, aim chest, right!
Imlay joins Harris, SMASHING THE SKYLIGHT out of the bus
roof, CLIMBING OUT, taking position on the bus' roof.
The rest of the marines EXIT THE BUS. Nantz grabs Adukwu.
SGT. NANTZ
Stay here with the civilians. As
soon as Stavrou gives the sign, get
them down to the street!
Adukwu nods. Nantz starts off the bus.
HECTOR
(looks up at Nantz)
Are we gonna die?
Nantz turns back to Hector. Manages a smile.
SGT. NANTZ
Course not, kid, we're the good
guys.
And Nantz is off the bus.
Adukwu stands in.the bus, looking out to see Kerns running
back to them, signalling. Adukwu turns to the civilians
crowded behind him.
ADUKWU
Okay, it's clear. We're gonna go.
Amy and Kirsten, terrified, look up at Michele. She hurries
the girls to the door of the bus as Kern runs up.
MICHELE
It's okay. I'll be right behind
you.
Adukwu picks up Amy. Kerns picks up Kirsten.
66.
PVT. KERNS
(takes a breath, telling
them, himself)
It's gonna be scary but we can do
it, okay?
An alien round flies through the bus, shattering the back
window! The girls scream.
Kerns and Adukwu race away, running with the girls... Rincon
grabs Hector. He and Michele follow...
RUNNING ACROSS THE FREEWAY...
To the off-ramp. It seems like a long way off. They run
past Correggio, rocking a SAW full auto. The FIRE is
deafening.
CPL. CORREGGIO
Come on!! Come on!! Get some!
Rincon and Michele, breathing ragged, feet pounding, look
up... They're getting closer and closer to the off-ramp as...
Alien rounds blow chunks of concrete off the roadway...
UP AHEAD, Kerns and Adukwu rush the girls to the EDGE OF THE
RAMP, hurrying to get them down as...
Rincon and Michele REACH THE OFF-RAMP now.
Kerns grabs Hector, HELPING HIM ANGLE DOWN THE OFF-RAMP,
getting the boy safely handed down to awaiting Stavrou as...
ON THE FREEWAY
BANG! MOTTOLA TAKES A ROUND TO THE SIDE.
Rincon spins, sees the marine drop, SCREAMING.
Rincon looks back at Adukwu, who is busy getting Michele down
the off-ramp now.
Then Rincon looks back to the freeway, sees Mottola writhing
in agony.
Rincon runs to Mottola, kneeling next to him.
Mottola looks up at Rincon, fear in his eyes.
RINCON
It's okay, son. I got you.
67.
Rincon starts to PULL Mottola TOWARD THE OFF-RAMP...
Struggling to get him to safety.
Mottola's body starts to convulse. Rincon stops, tries to
control him. Sees Mottola's eyes rolling back in his head.
Then Rincon is horrified when he looks up to see...
ALIENS RACING FORWARD... Heading his way!
Moving in and out of the sea of abandoned cars.
Rincon redoubles his efforts, pulling on the injured Mottola.
As he does, he looks back up to see...
The ALIENS ARE ALMOST ON TOP OF HIM now as...
BANG! The first alien is shot by...
Nantz, suddenly there, M-16 poised.
Rincon looks from Nantz to... MORE ALIENS coming at them!
No choice-- Rincon PICKS UP the injured Mottola's RIFLE.
Scared, but resolute. He looks at Nantz.
RINCON
What do I need to know?
The slightest beat, then...
SGT. NANTZ
It's set to fire in three round
bursts. We're low, so don't waste
your shots.
Rincon holds the M-16 against his shoulder, aiming.
RINCON
Just sight down the barrel...?
SGT. NANTZ
And give 'em hell.
Rincon sights down the barrel of his rifle at ONE ALIEN in
the distance. He squeezes the trigger...
BY THE FREEWAY OFF-RAMP
Adukwu sees Rincon and the wounded Mottola now. He runs to
them, incoming rounds WHIZZ by as...
68.
Adukwu bends over Mottola, seeing that he's dead. Adukwu
closes Mottola's eyes as...
An ALIEN APPEARS from behind a car, AIMING STRAIGHT AT
ADUKWU. It is about to FIRE as...
BAM! BAM! BAM! Rincon FIRES, blowing the alien away.
Adukwu looks up, realizing Rincon just saved him.
He,meets eyes with Rincon, who stares back, stunned a moment
by his own actions. Adukwu immediately shouts a. warning.:
PVT. ADUKWU
Keep fighting!
Rincon snaps back, turns to fire... A moment too late as...
THUMP! Rincon is HIT. He falls.
Adukwu grabs Rincon, sees the pain and fear in the civilian's
eyes. Adukwu rips open packages of QuickClot, begins
spreading the fast-clotting powder on Rincon's wounds as...,
A dark, empty store. The marines burst in, aiming rifles.
SGT. NANTZ
Tighten this place down. See if we
can establish communications. Hard
line only! Nothing wireless.
74.
The marines move into position, covering windows and doors.
Nantz turns to Michele, huddling with the kids.
SGT. NANTZ
Listen, we're out of the bomb
zone... But when they fall, we will
definitely be rocked. Make sure
the kids are prepared for that.
Hector suddenly breaks free, rushing forward.as Imlay and
Adukwu enter with Rincon, setting him down.
Nantz pulls blankets from a nearby rack, covering Rincon. As
he does, we see a glimpse of Rincon's BLOOD-SOAKED CLOTHING.
He is very pale. Blood flecks his lips.
Hector stares into his father's face, eyes filling. Rincon
touches Hector's face lightly.
SGT. NANTZ
It'll be okay. We'll get your dad
fixed up.
But when Hector looks to Nantz on this, he can't meet the
boy's gaze. Hector can see this isn't the truth.
RINCON
Listen to me, son. I'm not going
to make it.
(a slight beat)
But you will.
HECTOR
I don't want to go without you.
RINCON
I know. But you have to. Now wait
with Michele a minute. Let me talk
to the sergeant.
Reluctantly, Hector allows Michele to lead him away.
SGT. NANTZ
Mr. Rincon, we can take you and...
Rincon turns to Nantz, steel-eyed.
MR. RINCON
Don't waste time, sergeant. You
and I both know what's going on
here.
75.
SGT. NANTZ
I can't leave you...
RINCON
No. You can't take me.
Nantz is silent, at a loss.
ACROSS THE STORE
Imlay stares at a CLOCK on the wall, calls out:
PVT. IMLAY
Four minutes and those bombs drop,
Sergeant.
NANTZ looks over at this. But his expression is blank.
He turns back to Rincon, who's staring straight into him.
RINCON
I keep playing it over in my
head... If I'd done things
differently... Maybe I could have
gotten Hector out earlier.
SGT. NANTZ
You can't look back. You make the
best decision you can...
A beat.
RINCON
Just promise you'll get my son out
of here, Sergeant.
Nantz looks like he has the weight of the world on him.
SGT. NANTZ
I promise.
Rincon holds out his hand. Nantz takes it, meeting his gaze.
RINCON
I'm trusting you with the only
thing I have in this world.
Nantz stares, nods.
CPL. HARRIS
Sergeant! Hard wire connection!
76.
Nantz turns to see Harris behind a COUNTER, at a COMPUTER--
an INTERNET CONNECTION on its screen.
The marines crowd around, reading the ominous HEADLINE...
"GLOBAL INVASION -- Alien 'Creatures' Attack From Oceans"
PICTURES of ALIENS racing through urban streets, swarming
over cars stuck in massive lines,of traffic...
Underneath these pictures we see CAPTIONS, a litany-of doom:
Battle: Tokyo... Battle: Cape Town... Battle: Los Angeles...
Then a BUDDY LIST pops up on the screen, an INSTANT MESSAGE:
'baby, is that you?'
CPL. HARRIS
Damn, that's Cherise...
Harris quickly types back a response: 'you ok?'
The message comes back: no, real scared.'
Harris responds: 'where are you?'
He hits SEND. But the message doesn't go through. He clicks
the mouse. But the computer has frozen.
Then 'Internet Connection Lost' pops up on screen.
Everyone stares. Harris stands, walks from the computer.
Stavrou watches him go as...
ACROSS THE BIG 5 FLOOR
HECTOR steps back to his dad's side. Rincon's eyes open
slowly. He looks at Hector. Manages a small smile. Reaches
out, wipes a tear from his son's face.
RINCON
I'm very proud of you, son. You're
being so brave...
Hector throws his arms around his father, hugging him
tightly.
RINCON
I love you, Hector.
Mr. Rincon smiles. His face peaceful. Hector is silent,
tears rolling down his face.
77.
PVT. IMLAY
Thirty seconds!
CPL. STAVROU
Get away from the windows! Get
those kids behind cover!
The marines back away from the windows into the center of the
store, hunkering down with the civilians. Everyone stares at
the CLOCK on the wall as it ticks...
PVT. KERNS
C'mon. Fry those bastards...
PVT. IMLAY
Those bombs drop, then everything's
gonna change. Get to the FOB, get
some goddamn ammo...
PVT. KERNS
Some goddamn food...
CPL. CORREGGIO
Some goddamn tanks.
Beat. Everyone stares as... The CLOCK ticks to NINE...
AND NOTHING HAPPENS.
They wait. Fear grows on everyone's faces.
PVT. KERNS
They shoulda' dropped, right? We'd
feel it from here, wouldn't we?
CPL. CORREGGIO
That much ordinance? They'd feel
it in Nevada. Something's wrong...
PVT. IMLAY
Maybe it's good... Maybe we turned
the tide...
CPL. STAVROU
Yeah, right, Imlay... 'Cause we
were kickin' ass out there.
MICHELE
What's happening, Sergeant? What's
that mean?
SGT. NANTZ
I don't know.
78.
Adukwu quietly approaches Nantz now, voice low.
PVT. ADUKWU
Sergeant... Mr. Rincon is dead.
Nantz turns, staring off at Hector, sitting by his father.
It's all too much...
SGT. NANTZ
Jesus...
Nantz takes a deep breath, his mind racing, the world closing
in on him. He turns to Michele.
SGT. NANTZ
Listen, our Forward Operating Base
is about a mile away. We have to
go on foot. I'll need your help
with Hector now.
Michele nods. Watches as Nantz slowly walks to Hector.
Nantz kneels by the boy.
SGT. NANTZ
I'm sorry Hector. Your dad...
didn't make it. You understand?
Hector, sobbing, overwhelmed by grief and fear, looks up at
Nantz.
HECTOR
I don't wanna be here. I want my
dad back. I want it all to go back
to the way it was before...
AT. THE FRONT OF THE STORE.
Stavrou, eyes on the still street, sees...
TWO ALIEN SCOUTS appear. They crouch by a car.
CPL. STAVROU
Sergeant, we got hostiles in front.
All the marines stiffen, the clatter of rifles being raised.
But Nantz, tearing up himself, just stays focused on Hector.
SGT. NANTZ
Me too, Hector. I wish it could go
back, too...
79.
STAVROU LOOKS OUT TO THE STREET
MORE ALIENS appear now, moving TOWARD THE STORE.
CPL. STAVROU
Out of time, sergeant.
NANTZ
Tries to lead Hector away. Hector struggles.
SGT. NANTZ
(URGENTLY NOW)
We have to go, Hector.
HECTOR
(CRYING)
No! No! I want my dad!!!
Nantz lifts Hector. We see Hector's face, stricken, staring
back at his father as he's carried off.
The other marines gather up Michele and the girls...
And everyone is moving silently THROUGH THE STORE as...
AT THE FRONT OF THE STORE
CRASH! The plate glass window is SHATTERED as...
An ALIEN smashes through it.
The alien is very still, peering around. Then it begins to
creep forward as...
A SECOND ALIEN, then a third, a FOURTH follows, leaping into
the store with sinewy power.
AT THE REAR OF THE STORE
Nantz peers out a BACK DOOR. It's clear. They MOVE OUT just
as...
MORE ALIENS leap in. They move in formation THROUGH THE
STORE as...
THE BACK DOOR silently shuts.
QUICK CUT TO:
The marines enter cautiously, rifles up. Then they hustle
the civilians inside when it appears safe.
SGT. NANTZ
Lock this place down.
The marines fan out, securing doors, checking windows as...
Nantz kneels by Hector, tries to comfort him.
84.
SGT. NANTZ
You're a brave kid. When this is
over, you're going to be a hero.
HECTOR
People always say that. "He's a
hero."
(BEAT)
No one even knows what a hero is.
SGT. NANTZ
Your dad was a hero.
Hector just stares back.
SGT. NANTZ
He saved Pvt. Adukwu up on that
freeway.
Hector exchanges a glance with Adukwu. Something passes
between them... One man died so another could live...
SGT. NANTZ
You save a marine under fire, you
get a medal, y'know.
Nantz pulls out a MEDALLION, the CREST of the 2/5 on it.
SGT. NANTZ
This is our medallion. It's yours.
For your dad.
(SMILES)
You're 2/5 now, Hector.
Hector takes the heavy medallion, looks it over, pointing to
the 2/5 MOTTO on it:
HECTOR
What's that mean, "retreat hell?"
SGT. NANTZ
During World War I, an officer from
our regiment was ordered to
retreat. He said, "Retreat? Hell,
we just got here!"
Nantz is happy to see a slow smile from Hector now.
Harris calls out:
CPL. HARRIS
We're secure, sergeant.
85.
Nantz stands on this, addresses the marines:
SGT. NANTZ
Listen up. We need ammo. Kerns,
Adukwu stay with the civilians.
The rest of us, let's move.
Nantz puts a hand on Hector's shoulder.
SGT. NANTZ
I'll be right back.
Kerns has a tub of ice cream, scooping bowls for the kids.
PVT. KERNS
My dad's a fireman. They love
their ice cream. Used to visit the
firehouse with my little brother,
they always had tons of it...
(re. the kids)
My brother's not much older than
these guys.
MICHELE
You don't look much older, either.
She gazes at the kids, pain and anger washing over her.
87.
MICHELE
Is this day ever going to end?
PVT. KERNS
Maybe the Sergeant'll find a way
outta here.
MICHELE
(SMILES)
What's with you guys anyway?
Doesn't anybody have a first name?
ADUKWU
Emmanuel. Manny.
PVT. KERNS
Pete. You married? Family?
MICHELE
I'm single. Lots of family back in
Nebraska, though... Hopefully
they're safe...
She shakes the thought away.
MICHELE
What about you guys?
PVT. KERNS
Little Rock.
ADUKWU
Nigeria. I came here to be a
doctor.
MICHELE
You should be a surgeon, the way
you cut into that thing...
Adukwu smiles. Then his smile fades as he looks around.
ADUKWU
Yeah. Maybe...
Nantz enters with Imlay. They look around...
The WINDOWS have been BLOWN OPEN. The wind rustles papers
through the ghostly space, blowing them out into the night.
88.
On one desk, a COMPUTER is flashing a SLIDESHOW: Happy
PICTURES of someone's family vacation.
From this, high vantage point, they can see for miles...
Nantz looks out one end of the control tower, sees all the
way to the ocean...
Then he turns, looks the other way, dead east...
A vista of EXPLOSIONS, spreading-into the distance. ALIEN
DRONE AIRCRAFT engage F-18s. One jet is blown up, spiralling
to the ground.
SGT. NANTZ
Look how far east they've gotten.
That's almost the whole city...
Nantz looks out through BINOCULARS:
Sees the HOLLYWOOD SIGN ablaze in the hills...
Then pans to a mid-city area. Stops when he sees one
quadrant of the city, blocks wide, SHIMMERING an INKY BLACK.
Some kind of DARK ENERGY WAVE emanating from the ground.
SGT. NANTZ
What the hell's that?
Imlay peers out.
SGT. NANTZ
There's zero activity there.
And the area does seem completely devoid of activity-- No
alien or human aircraft above it. Like a DEAD ZONE.
PVT. IMLAY
What are we gonna do, Sergeant?
Nantz, panning with the binoculars, sees a CHOPPER TAKING OFF
in the distance now.
Nantz grabs a MAP on the desk, eyes roaming over it. Then
looks back to where he saw the chopper.
SGT. NANTZ
That must be the alternate
extraction site. Maybe we can
evacuate the civilians there...
He turns to Imlay.
89.
SGT. NANTZ
Get them in the LAV. I'll radio
for an evac helicopter... When I
do, they'll be coming, so we have
to move fast.
PVT. IMLAY
Think we can make it, Sergeant?
SGT. NANTZ
We're gonna give it one helluva
try, Imlay.
He reassures the young marine with each-word:
SGT. NANTZ
We're not dying here.
The marines, absent Nantz, surround the civilians
protectively as they hustle them into the LAV.
CONTROL TOWER - SANTA MONICA AIRPORT - MINUTES LATER
Nantz standing alone with a RADIO PACK looking out into the
black night, wind blowing through the tower.
The LAV WAITS ON THE TARMAC below, engine running.
Nantz takes a deep breath. Presses the button on the RADIO.
NANTZ
(TRANSMITTING)
Any station, this is Foxtrot 2
November. I have four civilians
and seven marines, we're heading to
Alternate Extraction Point Charlie.
Requesting evacuation. I say
again, this is Foxtrot 2 November
heading to Alternate Extraction
Point Charlie. Out.
Nantz turns immediately, hurrying out.
Nantz sees the civilians and marines crammed together in the
back amid gear and guns.
He turns to Stavrou behind the wheel.
SGT. NANTZ
Use the thermal sight. No lights.
Stavrou drives, spins away as Nantz climbs...
INTO THE TURRET
He mans the M-240 MACHINE GUN. Imlay beside him on the 25MM
BUSHMASTER CHAIN GUN.
Headlights off, running dark, Stavrou drives, peering through
the THERMAL SIGHT.
STAVROU'S POV THROUGH THERMAL
Washed green, the city a war zone, massive destruction..
An ALIEN DRONE winging toward the airport as...
Nantz watches the alien drone fly off into the night.
Stavrou drives, hands gripping the wheel as he maneuvers
carefully through wrecked abandoned cars.
91.
IN THE TURRET
Nantz eyes a nervous Imlay.
SGT. NANTZ
Extract site's only a couple more
miles, Imlay.
Imlay nods back. Nantz peers down to...
STAVROU, BEHIND THE WHEEL...
Eyes focusing tensely through the thermal sight scope.
THERMAL SIGHT POV
Green wash of the city passing by. Tall, empty buildings all
around... Suddenly, a big DARK OBJECT in the street!
Stavrou SLAMS THE BRAKES. Civilians and marines in the tight
passenger compartment are thrown around.
Right in front of the LAV...
A massive CRATER. The street's impassable.
SGT. NANTZ
We gotta go around.
The LAV backs up, Nantz scanning the sky, gripping the M-240
machine gun, trying to see out into the darkness...
Then they TURN A CORNER... And a VIEW BETWEEN TWO TALL
BUILDINGS is harrowing...
FOUR ALIEN DRONE AIRCRAFT hovering... Then turning. Flying
toward them.
SGT. NANTZ
Get ready, Imlay. Here they come.
Stavrou looks out to see... A HELICOPTER in the distance.
CPL. STAVROU
Think I see our ride, sergeant!
SGT NANTZ
Get us there. Cause we're about to
get lit up.
The alien drone ships are winging at them. They are only 200
meters out when...
92.
SGT. NANTZ
See what that Bushmaster can do,
Imlay!
Imlay OPENS UP on the 25MM BUSHMASTER CHAIN GUN.
PVT. IMLAY
Come on, you martian bastards!
The Bushmaster is a rapid-firing CANNON spewing 200 rounds a
minute, each capable of destroying a light tank.
For once, the aliens are overmatched. The ALIEN SHIPS take
HEAVY FIRE from the Bushmaster...
One goes down IN FLAMES, the others PEEL OFF, flying behind
buildings.
PVT. IMLAY
Where'd they go? Where'd they go?
Nantz is scanning the sky, then...
SGT. NANTZ
Imlay, on your six!
Imlay spins in the turret, picking up...
The three remaining ALIEN AIRCRAFT coming back around.
The lead alien ship FIRES!
A ,CAR EXPLODES next to the LAV. Imlay rocks in the turret.
PVT. IMLAY
Son of a...
Imlay targets, fires the Bushmaster...
The lead alien ship is HIT, winging out of control INTO A
SECOND SHIP. The TWO SHIPS EXPLODE into a building as...
The FINAL ALIEN AIRCRAFT dodges the FIREBALL, flying straight
at the LAV...
SGT. NANTZ
Getting close, Imlay...
PVT. IMLAY
I got it.
Imlay FIRES a burst. The last aircraft is hit...
93.
It PINWHEELS TO THE GROUND, exploding into FLAMING WRECKAGE
which hurtles RIGHT AT THE LAV.
SGT. NANTZ
Stand on it, Stavrou!
Stavrou pushes it, TRYING TO OUTRUN the burning wreckage...
Which is almost on top of the LAV as...
Stavrou spins AROUND A CORNER, escaping.
The wreckage explodes into a building behind them as...
THUMP - THUMP - THUMP! The sound of a UH-1'Medevac ECHOES.
PVT. IMLAY
The chopper!
Nantz looks out, sees the CHOPPER LANDING in the street.
The LAV screeches up amid the RUBBLE and SMOKE.
CPL. STAVROU
Last stop!
SGT. NANTZ
Everybody out!
The marines rush the civilians OUT OF THE LAV... Nantz and
Imlay scrambling out last.
SGT. NANTZ
Pretty decent shooting, Imlay.
PVT. IMLAY
(GRINNING)
Goddamn, you did it, sergeant!
We're gonna get these people out!
EVERYONE RUNS TO THE CHOPPER.
The marines begin loading the civilians in, the old-school
CREW CHIEF hopping off to help the kids in.
CREW CHIEF
You are in the middle of the shit,
Sergeant! Everything's been pulled
back.
SGT. NANTZ
What are you talking about?!
94.
CREW CHIEF
We've lost most of our air assets.
We're abandoning Los Angeles. This
city's done...!
(to the pilot)
Let's go!
The chopper powers up, Nantz SCRAMBLES ON with the others.
The CHOPPER BEGINS TO LIFT OFF. As it rises, Nantz gazes out
at the CITYSCAPE. He sees fires, wreckage everywhere. Then
he looks off to see...
THE BLACK DEAD ZONE SHIMMERING NEARBY
Nantz watches the HELICOPTER BANK TOWARD THE BLACK ZONE. But
as it gets closer...
The HELICOPTER DIPS precipitously, suddenly losing altitude.
The kids SCREAM. The marines hang on.
Nantz sees the PILOT STRUGGLING with the controls. The
HELICOPTER'S GAUGES are going crazy.
The pilot BANKS HARD AWAY from the area, reversing course.
And the helicopter STABILIZES.
SGT. NANTZ
What the hell happened?!
CREW CHIEF
Something there was playing hell
with our power!
Nantz stares at this. Then notices Hector watching. him.
He sees the 2/5 MEDALLION clutched tightly in Hector's hand.
Sees the words "Retreat Hell."
Nantz looks back at the MYSTERIOUS BLACK PATCH of cityscape.
Then he turns to the crew chief.
SGT. NANTZ
Set us back down!
CREW CHIEF
What?!
The other marines in Nantz' unit look over, alarmed now.
95.
SGT. NANTZ
We need to recon that area!
CREW CHIEF
We can't land! May not have power
to take off again...
Nantz looks out. Spies a BUILDING with a FLAT OPEN ROOF. He
points to it.
SGT. NANTZ
Then we'll rope down!
CPL. CORREGGIO
What the hell, sergeant? What's
going on?
SGT. NANTZ
There's something over there... We
could be the only ones left here to
figure out what it is.
(to the others)
Let's go, marines.
The marines look frightened, confused. They start to pull
themselves up. ROPES are dropped from the chopper as it
hovers over the building...
SGT. NANTZ
NOW! Go! Go!
The marines start to RAPPEL DOWN, one after another as...
Nantz exchanges a glance with Michele.
SGT. NANTZ
They'll get you safe.
He smiles at the girls. Then turns, nods at Hector. Puts a
hand on his shoulder. A BEAT.
SGT. NANTZ
See you soon, buddy.
HECTOR
What are you gonna do?
SGT. NANTZ
We're gonna fight.
Nantz turns, grabs a ROPE, drops out of the chopper.
96.
Stavrou fires it up, drives off as... Nantz eyes the jumble
of gear. He grabs his COMBAT SHOTGUN, a portable RADIO,
which he makes sure is OFF...
Then an olive case marked: GLTD. He stuffs it in his pack.
PVT. IMLAY
Laser target, sir?
SGT. NANTZ
Might have to get some cruise
missiles in here.
PVT. IMLAY
Shit, yes, Sergeant.
98.
CPL. STAVROU
(CALLING OUT)
Hostiles. Twelve o'clock.
Nantz looks up to see...
ALIEN SOLDIERS appearing on the street now.
Nantz goes back to stuffing his pack.
SGT. NANTZ
Just hit the gas, Corporal. We got
plenty of armor.
Everyone looks up at this. Then looks out to see...
The aliens attacking, FIRING on the LAV as...
Stavrou floors it, ALIEN FIRE pinging off the LAV's armor
as... SPLAT!!!
STAVROU MOWS THROUGH THE ENEMY LINE.
Nantz looks out the back to see some ALIENS STAGGERING AWAY.
SGT. NANTZ
Reverse, Corporal.
CPL. STAVROU
Aye, aye, Sergeant.
As he BACKS UP, mowing back over the remaining aliens... The
marines cheer.
The squad runs to the subway entrance, stopping just inside.
SGT. NANTZ
Harris, Adukwu, stay here, watch
the street.
Harris and Adukwu nod. Taking position at the entrance.
Nantz motions to the others.
SGT. NANTZ
Let's go.
Nantz leads Stavrou, Correggio, Kerns and Imlay down the
stopped escalator to the SUBWAY PLATFORM.
Nantz stands, gazing around at the empty subway platform.
Silent. Spooky. A train is stopped. Doors open. It is
dark, the only light bleeding in from the street above.
He motions Stavrou to guard against anything coming from
above. Then he moves forward with the others.
A huge number of BIRDS line the dark cavity above the train
tracks, taking cover themselves, roosting quietly.
Nantz sees a DOOR in the tunnel wall, heads to it.
He pulls his KA-BAR KNIFE out, sticks the blade into the door
jam, pops the DOOR OPEN. Nantz turns to Correggio and Kerns.
SGT. NANTZ
(QUIETLY)
You two stay here, watch our backs.
(TO IMLAY)
Imlay, come with me.
Nantz and Imlay slip through the doorway.
Nantz and Imlay stand very still, peering down the long, dark
hall, looking for movement. Nantz motions and they move
forward silently, guns ready.
They turn a corner and stop. It is PITCH BLACK here.
Nantz clicks on his flashlight. They move forward. After
only a few feet, the FLASHLIGHT DIMS AND DIES.
Imlay clicks on his flashlight.
101.
SGT. NANTZ
(WHISPERING)
No. Save it. Something is killing
anything electronic we use.
Imlay clicks his flashlight OFF. But now we see...
A dim light ahead. Nantz and Imlay creep forward, very
slowly. Turn a corner, see...
A STRANGE LIGHT at the end of the hallway. THE LIGHT GLOWS
fiercely, as if it's shining through the floor.
Nantz, silhouetted by the light, signals Imlay to stay put.
Nantz steps forward, toward the strange glow of light. As he
approaches, he realizes it's coming through...
An IRON GRATE in the floor.
Nantz moves to the grate, kneels, PEERING DOWN INTO...
A MASSIVE SUBWAY TUNNEL
Fifty feet wide, the dim tunnel has been further EXCAVATED.
It is a huge CAVERN now, extending off into the distance
further than Nantz can see.
The huge space is illuminated by MASSES OF ALIEN MACHINERY.
An ELECTRIC HUM FILLS THE AIR.
Tending the machinery: DOZENS OF ALIENS, bigger than the
others.
One of the ALIENS TURNS, focusing up, right at Nantz.
Nantz spins, runs back into the darkness. Calling to Imlay:
SGT. NANTZ
Run, Imlay! Run!
BANG. The iron GRATE FLIES into the air.
Nantz and Imlay, race along in the dark. They hear POUNDING
FOOTSTEPS of the alien pursuing him.
A glimmer of LIGHT ahead. Along the floor. It is, a DOOR.
They burst through a DOOR, into...
A DIM STAIRWELL.
102.
Nantz follows Imlay UP THE STAIRS as...
The STAIRWELL DOOR below is SMASHED OPEN.
Nantz spins, swinging his shotgun. HE FIRES.
BOOM! The blast ILLUMINATES the huge ALIEN, filling the
stairwell with its horrible bulk.
Nantz backs up the stairs, pumping the shotgun, firing...
Each blast ILLUMINATES THE ALIEN in a STROBE EFFECT. The
alien moves up the stares. Nantz KEEPS FIRING.
The NOISE IS DEAFENING in the enclosed space.
Then the SHOTGUN RUNS DRY. And we're left IN DARKNESS.
Imlay clicks on his FLASHLIGHT, revealing...
The ALIEN at Nantz' feet, its strange "hand" on his boot.
Nantz, terrified, aims at the alien, waiting to see if it
will move. It doesn't.
Nantz and Imlay re-enter, running up to join the others.
Up the stairs, by street-level, Harris and Adukwu keep watch.
Harris motions: "ENEMY TROOPS".
Nantz nods. Signals for all the marines to head down the
stairs. The marines gather around Nantz. To Harris:
SGT. NANTZ
How many?
CPL. HARRIS
Hard to tell. A lot.
SGT. NANTZ
I think I got their attention.
Nantz kneels. He opens his pack, pulls out the radio and the
case marked GLTD.
SGT. NANTZ
Look. There's something big down
in the tunnels. It's sucking up a
lot of power, could be a major
Command &.Control asset.
103.
Nantz stares at his men.
SGT. NANTZ
We need to destroy it.
PVT. KERNS
But we got no jets left, right,
Sergeant?
SGT. NANTZ
Hopefully, they can still fire
cruise missiles from Pendleton or
Vandenburg... I'll radio in a
strike, paint the target from the
street. You know what that means.
The man nod solemnly.
PVT. IMLAY
We gotta hold 'em off long enough
to paint the target.
CPL. STAVROU
If we can get a transmission out
before the radio dies...
CPL. HARRIS
And the targeting laser lasts long
enough for command to get a lock on
the target.
CPL. CORREGGIO
Hell, dying's easy, ladies.
Everything else takes balls, right?
They all laugh softly.
SGT. NANTZ
Let's do it.
He takes a deep breath, raises the radio, and TRANSMITS:
SGT. NANTZ
(TRANSMITTING)
Any station, this is Foxtrot 2
November. Priority Fire Mission. I
have identified a major enemy
command and control asset-- located
grid 459083. 1 WILL BE LASING.
104.
COMMAND (V.0.)
Foxtrot 2. You have visual
confirmation of this C&C; asset? We
can't waste resources.
SGT. NANTZ
Affirmative. They're building a
huge complex underground... I think
it's the head of the snake.
Repeat. I will be...
THE RADIO GOES DEAD.
Alien fire EXPLODES now, rocking the station.
BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Nantz and the marines cover their heads
as the station starts to come apart, chunks of concrete fall.
The walls crack. Dust fills the air.
Nantz SCREAMS as a chunk of concrete FALLS ACROSS HIS ANKLE.
Then, it's over. All is silent. Nantz, GRIMACING in PAIN,
strains to lift the concrete chunk off his ankle. He GROANS.
The marines rise. Pale, sweating, Nantz hobbles to his feet.
He slings his rifle, and carrying the GLTD, hurries on his
bad ankle to the stairs.
Nantz looks up. Rubble nearly fills the stairway. There is
only a small opening of daylight near the ceiling.
The men all unclip their web gear, begin climbing.
THE MARINES ARE ENVELOPED... DISAPPEARING as...
Buildings shatter, cars are tossed, flames erupt.
Then SILENCE descends a moment. Only the crackle of flames,
falling glass. The dust and ash settles in a grey haze.
Nothing could have survived this. BEAT. Then...
A FIGURE RISES UP out of the grey destruction.
SGT. NANTZ
MARINES!
AS ONE, the men rise out of the ash, standing tall.
SGT. NANTZ
ON ME!
The marines fall in. A PHALANX with Nantz at its center.
SGT. NANTZ
FIRE!
They move forward. Precise. Deadly. FIGHTING AS ONE.
The seven remaining marines POUR FIRE on the mass of aliens.
The Drone Ships fall from the sky, EXPLODING on the ground.
The aliens, in disarray, are mowed down. The rest FLEE.
And as the smoke drifts away, there is silence again.
Nantz looks up to see...
108.
HIS MEN. His warriors. Standing with smoking weapons, ready
for more. Correggio staggers up, covered in dust, bloody.
CPL. CORREGGIO
You know what, Sergeant? My
brother said you were a bad ass.
(SMILES)
I had no idea...
SGT. NANTZ
Your brother was one helluva
marine, Correggio.
(SMILES BACK)
So are you.
CUT TO:
Nantz sits in the rumbling chopper. Surrounded by his
marines. Imlay stares out at the city below.
PVT. IMLAY
Man, it's quiet.
CHOPPER PILOT (V.0.)
They're in full retreat throughout
Los Angeles, heading back into the
ocean. Units are mopping up.
On this, Nantz turns to his SQUAD. Beat.
SGT. NANTZ
This has been a hell of a battle.
Plenty of other battles to go.
Everybody good with that?
The marines don't hesitate.
MARINES
Yes, Sergeant!
CPL. CORREGGIO
Well, uh, actually, Sergeant...
there's this girl I was supposed to
meet up with tonight...
SGT. NANTZ
(SMILES)
I'm sure she'll understand.
Nantz looks at his marines.
109.
NANTZ
I think you men earned the right to
call yourselves marines today. I'm
damn proud of every one of you.
Retreat!?
MARINES
HELL!
ALL
2/5!!!
