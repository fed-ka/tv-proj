      TIGH BOUNDING down A CORRIDOR.  He s gnarly, intense, focused 
      -- a wrecking ball with whiskers, HELO at his side.  A 
      handful of amped up marines led by MATHIAS rapidly falls in 
      step behind them.  Tigh growls over his shoulder.

                                  TIGH
                    Look alive.  And for frak s sake, 
                    don t shoot the godsdamn president.

      Helo turns to Tigh as they hustle on.

                                  HELO
                    Just let me talk to her.

                                  TIGH
                    Talk all you want. But it ends with 
                    the first bang.
                          (muttering to himself)
                    Helluva play, Starbuck.


      ADAMA, GAETA, DUALLA and the rest of the crew riveted on the 
      intercom speaker, broadcasting Tigh s sandpaper voice.

                                  TIGH (WIRELESS)
                    We re rolling down here.

      Adama hears the HEAVY POUNDING of BOOTS, the rustle of 
      COMMOTION which, for us, suddenly becomes SILENCE, when we

                                                                            CUT TO:


      sitting in the cockpit of Kara s pristine Viper, cordoned off 
      and hunkered in a darkened corner of THE HANGAR DECK. He 
      clutches the FLIGHT STICK that Kara used to shoot herself 
      into legend, feels her grip, takes in her scent. Catches 
      sight of something.  A PIECE OF CHEWING GUM, stuck under the 
      instrument panel for safe-keeping. Lee chuckles. Then SIGHS. 
      And sighs again, which evolves into LABORED BREATHING...       'Six of One' FULL COLLATED 7/20/072.



      The source of the labored breathing. She stands, skin livid, 
      eyes fixed on someone, as she swipes a wrist under her nose 
      to mop away the sweat.  Kara catches her breath, then 
      gestures with A PISTOL dangling in her hand, at her side.

      WIDEN TO REVEAL LAURA ROSLIN, slowly rising from Adama s 
      couch, the wash cloth in her hand.  Resigned but unbowed, she 
      swoons a little (from chemo side-effects received in ep. 3), 
      but won t give Kara the satisfaction of seeing her weakened. 
      Laura glances at the side arm clutched in Kara s hand.  

                                  KARA
                    I want to hate you so much.
                          (adding)
                    So much.

      Laura answers with a pained half-grin. 


      Hustle full bore down A CORRIDOR, the SHUFFLE of boots and 
      combat gear raking up the anticipation of conflict.


      Kara, aggressive, her head dipping forward, as if to duck 
      into Laura s space, her gaze searing into the president.

                                  KARA
                    You had a vision, remember?  The 
                    arrow?  The temple? I went down 
                    with you on that planet, it was a 
                    frakking toaster party, good people 
                    died, remember?

                                  LAURA
                    Yes --

                                  KARA
                    -- I trusted you!  On a vision. And 
                    that s all. A vision. I saw Earth. 
                    I saw it with my eyes!  And I hear 
                    it calling me back, DAMN IT, WE RE 
                    GOING THE WRONG WAY! 

      Laura skeptically nods.






                                                                              (CONTINUED)      'Six of One' FULL COLLATED 7/20/073.

                                  KARA (cont d)
                    Why?  Why can t you trust me? 

      Laura regards Kara for a moment. Then...

                                  LAURA
                    The sweetest, kindest young woman 
                    on Galactica put two bullets in 
                    William Adama s chest.

                                  KARA
                    And what?  Because I came back and 
                    the news was too good I m a Cylon?

                                  LAURA
                    We all saw you die... Kara. We saw 
                    it on Lee s gun cameras --

      Kara THRUSTS the gun, butt forward at Laura, who 
      involuntarily flinches. Kara gestures for Laura to take it.

                                  KARA
                    Shoot me.  

      Laura, pale, nauseous, stares Kara down.  

                                  KARA (cont d)
                    Come on.  Shoot me. Shoot your enemy. 
                    See, back on the ole base ship, we 
                    take this stuff seriously, you frak 
                    with another skinjob s number, you 
                    better be ready to back it up. 

      Laura swoons again, but she fights it, looks away.

                                  LAURA
                    I won t be a part of this --

      BOOM! Kara SLAMS the gun down on the desk in front of Laura. 

                                  KARA
                    Take it.   

      Pissed off, Laura disdainfully drops the washcloth aside.


      Lee walking away from the Viper. Notices a smudge on his nice 
      civilian clothes, swipes at it, when TYROL trots up.

                                  TYROL
                      Starbuck s lost it, big-time. 
                    Marines are gonna take her out --

      OFF LEE S reaction, we...


      Double-time it toward a bend where, down the corridor they 
      see NOWART AND MALDONALDO unconscious on the floor. 


      Tigh s voice RAGES over the intercom.

                                  TIGH (WIRELESS)
                    TWO DOWN!  WE GOT TWO DOWN!

      Adama s jaw clenches. Looks to Gaeta as he hurries out.

                                  ADAMA
                    Gaeta. Take the com.


      still on the table. 

      LAURA

      Heart racing, her contempt for being forced into such a 
      situation rising in her throat, glowers at Kara.

                                  KARA
                    I m no more of a Skinjob than you 
                    are and you know it.

                                  LAURA
                    I wish I did --

                                  KARA
                          (ON her dialogue)
                    -- I put my life on the line for 
                    this frakking ship! I ate and slept 
                    and fought next to the people I 
                    loved. I pissed off my friends, I 
                    broke more rules than I followed, I 
                    frakked up, I made a mess of things 
                    but this is all I have! This is my 
                    family and none of us belong here!  

      Kara s declaration seems to move Laura; her expression 
      manifests some revelatory germ in her brain rapidly 
      multiplying into a profound realization.

                                  LAURA
                      Starbuck...



                                                                              (CONTINUED)      'Six of One' FULL COLLATED 7/20/075.

      CONTINUED:1010

      Laura gestures around her, re: the gun, the chaos, the 
      situation, the passion...

                                  LAURA (cont d)
                    This.
                          (nodding)
                    This is you.  You re more human 
                    than any of us...

      Kara exhales from the bottom of her feet, relieved.

                                  KARA
                    Gods... Welcome to my nightmare...

                                  LAURA
                    They made you perfect, didn t they?

      And in one fluid motion, Laura SWEEPS the gun from the table 
      POINTS it at Kara and --


      POW! The virulent pop of A GUNSHOT shocks Tigh, Helo, and the 
      marines just as they approach Adama s quarters.


      INSTANTANEOUS: TIGH bounds in, sees Laura holding the gun, 
      Kara, gawking at the SHATTERED PICTURE of Laura and Adama, 
      just to the left of her head, the Marines are all over her, 
      hollering like banshees, CHAOS erupting.

                                    MATHIAS
                    DOWN ON THE FLOOR! DOWN ON THE 
                    FLOOR!  NOW! NOW! NOW!

      Helo, shaken, watches the marines gang-tackle Kara, who kicks 
      and thrashes like a swamp gator.

                        TIGHKARA
      Madam President...?Frakking bag of smashed 
                                                    assfaces! Get off me!   *

      As Tigh comes to Laura, she nods that she s unharmed but she 
      looks shell-shocked. They both stare at the gun in her hand, 
      both silently aware of what she just tried to do.  Laura 
      absently hands the weapon to Tigh.

      Adama strides in, Kara raging at the marines.

                                  KARA (O.S.)
                    I m losing it! I m losing the 
                    frakking sounds!  Admiral! ADMIRAL!

                    What the frak happened?  I thought 
                    you were on the move!

                                  TIGH
                    We were!  She s out of her frakking 
                    mind!

                                  KARA (O.S.)
                    Mathias, you dried up stump, it s 
                    me! I m not a frakking Cylon! 

      Kara BITES Mathias in the leg and she hollers in pain.

                                  ADAMA
                          (to Laura, softly)
                    How you doing?

      But before Laura can answer, the marines have Kara, 
      handcuffed and on her feet now. She commands Adama s 
      attention -- and everyone else in the room. Kara grins 
        sardonically at Tigh as the marines drag her to her feet. 

                                  KARA
                    Hello, Colonel.  Wanna watch them 
                    shave my head before they airlock 
                    me?  

      Tigh, the closet Final Fiver, buffers his comeback just a 
      hint from Tigh, the hard ass Cylon fighter. 

                                  TIGH
                    I oughta do it myself.

      Kara looks to Adama, makes a final, sober plea.

                                  KARA
                    Listen to me. Please. The ringing, 
                    the way to Earth, I m losing it, 
                    it s getting weaker, don t you 
                      understand?  Don t any of you?

      Tigh does. He heard the music. And after witnessing what 
      Laura just did and hearing what s coming out of Kara s mouth 
      he might be the most furtively agitated in the room if it 
      weren t for Helo, deeply troubled, staring at Kara.

                                  KARA (cont d)
                    It was clear, I could hear it like 
                    it was coming from the other room,

                    Get her out of here.

      Helo winces as Kara bucks and resists, getting one last 
      diatribe in at Laura.

                                  KARA
                    You better work on your aim.

                          (then, to Adama)
                    One Jump and it s gone. GONE.

      As the marines hustle Kara out, Adama and Laura s eyes meet. 
        Uncertainty, self-consciousness, and grave concern arc 
      between them like an electrical storm, as we...

      eyes squinting, Cavil seriously contemplates on

      WIDEN to NATALIE/SIX, A SHARON and a LEOBEN, standing in 
      Cavil s entrance arch (the base ship rooms have no doors).

                    blather about The Raiders  refusing 
                    to fire on their own.  Don t remind

                    We ve given it a great deal of 
                    thought. The Hybrid is clearly 
                    telling us something.

                                  CAVIL
                    The Hybrid is always telling us 
                      something. They re supposed to 
                    maintain the operation of each 
                    ship, not vomit metaphysics.
                          (OFF their looks)
                    All right, I give up. What?  What 
                    is she trying to say?

                    They re in the Colonial Fleet.  
                    With the humans.

      Cavil makes a lavishly confused face.

                                  CAVIL
                     They.   They-who?  

      Leoben conspiratorially glances at Natalie and Sharon. Then:

                                  LEOBEN
                    The Final Five.  

      The trio s eyes dart from each other to Cavil, as they wait 
      for his response. STUNNED, his bell profoundly rung, Cavil 
      slowly rises to his feet.

                    The Raiders refuse to fight because 
                    they sense the Final Five could be 
                    in the Human Fleet.

                    They could ve been captured, they 
                    could be in hiding --

      Cavil vehemently shakes his head.

                                  CAVIL
                    No, stop, right now. Turn around, 
                    go for a cleansing walk and I ll 
                    try and forget what I just heard --

                    What about INSANE? You rampage through 
                    this ship like rats hunting for grain, 
                    you didn t just terrorize The President, 
                    you went after a sick woman --

                    being poked and eyeballed and 
                    treated like a stranger in my home!

                    in space and when it s gone, it ll be

                    didn t have the guts to hang on.

      Kara stares hard, winces, the epiphany stabbing like a knife 
      in her temple. But she cauterizes her regret, goes to the 
      place she knows best: a little more driven than smart, a 
      little braver than either.

                                  KARA

      her head. Seething, he watches her turn back to face him.

      FADE IN:


      Cavil presides at a table. Sitting on his left: A LEOBEN and 
      A SHARON. Sitting to his right: A SIMON and A DORAL.  
      Natalie/Six stands in front of Cavil.  As he informs her, he 
      gestures to Simon and Doral...

                                  CAVIL
                    The Fours and Fives voted as we 
                    Ones did -- for reconfiguring the 
                    Raiders. 

                                    NATALIE
                    Gee, what a surprise. The Twos, 
                    Sixes and Eights voted against it. 
                    So we re deadlocked. 

                                  CAVIL
                      Hopelessly.  But you were right.  
                    And I m machine enough to admit 
                    that I was wrong.

                                    NATALIE
                    What are you talking about?

                                  CAVIL
                    Something extraordinary has 
                    happened.
                          (calling)
                    Eight!

      Agitated, growing suspicious, Natalie looks to her allies, 
      The Leoben and The Sharon. 

                                    NATALIE
                    What s going on?

      Their faces convey uneasiness and regret but before anyone 
      can respond, SHARON/BOOMER enters the room.

                    so I ll just say it: this eight s 
                    voted to reconfigure.

      Seething, Natalie confronts Boomer.

                    No one has ever voted against their

                      wherefores but it was totally her

      Adama, standing, his hands pressed against a table as he 
      stares intently at his half-destroyed clipper ship, THE 
      FIGURE HEAD which Kara gave to Adama just before her fateful 
      spiral into oblivion, perched on the prow.  Adama s INTERCOM 
      TRILLS. He clicks in.

                    Execute the Jump.

      Saddened and intense, Adama removes THE FIGURE HEAD from the 
      prow of the ruined ship model and holds it in his hand.

      watching her through the glass slit in the door, the hurt and 
      inner turmoil reflected in his eyes.


      LOUD as a cattle drive. PANNING, we see RACETRACK, HOT DOG, 
      Anders, SEELIX, NARCHO, Lee, Adama, OTHER PILOTS and NUGGETS, 
      getting shit-faced, someone starting up a beat rhythm by 
      clapping, others picking it up, etc. Seelix makes out with 
      Narcho while Racetrack and Hot Dog play strip poker cutting 
      cards, Hotdog losing badly, down to his boxers, Racetrack in 
      a sports bra and combat pants. When Hotdog loses the next 
      cut, PILOTS yell  Pants him! Pants him!  Adama and Lee 
      laughing their fool asses off. Meanwhile Helo ceremoniously 
      pours SIX SHOTS of Ambrosia in front of Lee over the din, 
      spilling when a drunken elbow or two jostles him.  He quickly

      Lee looks at the shots. Others call out in encouragement.

                                  ANDERS
                    Get it done, Apollo.

                                  NARCHO
                    Bum rush it, Jock.

      Complete silence now.  Lee exhales. Then hoists the first 
      shot and toasts.

                                  LEE
                    To Galactica.

      He downs the shot.  CHEERS. He picks up the next one.

                                  LEE (cont d)
                    To the men and women of Galactica.

      He downs that one. More CHEERS.  Picks up the third.

                                  LEE (cont d)
                    To the Admiral who commands the men 
                    and women of Galactica.

      Downs that one. Heaviest CHEERS yet. Picks up another.

                                  LEE (cont d)
                    To our sweethearts, husbands, and 
                    wives.

      Downs that one. CHEERS. A warm look crosses between Helo and 
      Athena, less so between Seelix and Anders.

                                  LEE (cont d)
                    To our absent friends...

      This one s a little harder to swallow for Lee. He downs it. 
      Respectful CHEERS.  Adama glances at the wall, sees a photo 
      of KARA, clowning with some other pilots. Looks away. Lee 
      raises the last shot.

                                  LEE (cont d)
                    To the fight. When the bell rings, 
                    may you bring your best bullet.

      -- Downs it to WILD CHEERS, shaking off the potency of the 
      alcohol with a HOWL, the CHEERS continuing. HELO looks over, 
      sees ATHENA, drinking, smiling back at him, but she s pretty 
      much alone, more of an observer than a participant, and it 
      registers with Helo, his smile diminishing a little.


      sit alone together, Adama, riding a pretty good buzz, regards 
      his son with a million things left unsaid, until...

                                  ADAMA
                    Political man.  

      Lee nods.  Swigs.

                                  LEE
                    Maybe I can pull some strings, get

                    Bring your best bullet to The

                                  LEE
                     Politics is just another means of

                    time, you re not gonna be able to 
                    answer it... Not anymore.

      Lee, his blood probably as potent as vermouth, chuckles.

                    then talk me out of it. Right?

      Lee looks at his father, who regards Lee without judgement, 
      only fondness. Lee abandons the joking, answers sincerely.

                                  LEE (cont d)
                    I know it s over, Pop.

                    Do you?  Because it s still gonna 
                    be in you, you re gonna feel it. 

      Adama edges closer to his son and beckons with a lazy hand, 
      as if he wants him to do the same.  Lee leans in closer.  He 
      cups his hand around the back of Lee s neck. 

                                  ADAMA (cont d)

                    shoes, up and down your spine,  Get 
                    ready, Get ready...  

      Adama is buzzed, troubled, drifts a little...

                                  ADAMA (cont d)
                    And... when it calls, you can t

                    remind yourself that... you re 
                    someone else now.

      A beat. Then Adama reaches into his pocket. He hands KARA S 
      FIGURE HEAD to Lee, who takes it.

                                  LEE
                    What is it?

                                  ADAMA
                    Something that means the world to

      Appreciative, Lee regards the figure head, then...

                    Dad... I want to see Kara.

      Crowded. BALTAR, sitting alone at a table. Glances around, 
      leery of his surroundings, his first time in public since the 
      near-stabbing incident in Ep. 3.  Feeling relatively safe, 
      the only remaining threat is the plate of algae mush in front 
      of him. He makes a face, mutters to it.

                                  BALTAR
                    Neptune s feast.

      But suddenly a passer-by places a SLICE OF BREAD in front of 
      him. Another passer-by places AN APPLE next to him, then 
      another A BOWL OF NOODLES. It s his flock, showing their 
      appreciation. Profoundly moved, Baltar s eyes well up. Still, 
      through his watery peepers, he manages to take a BITE of the 
      apple, savoring it until he sees TORY, sitting alone, at 
      another table, looking around, trying to be inconspicuous.  
      She looks away. Baltar grunts in distaste, his mouth full. 

      TORY

      picking at some algae polenta, when BALTAR plops down across 
      from Tory, STARTLING the hell out of her. 

                                  BALTAR (cont d)
                    Tory, Tory, Tory. Imagine finding

                    Hello.  

      He s brought his food with him. Takes a bite from his apple. 
      Gestures with it, juicy with sarcasm.

                                  BALTAR
                    Can I ask you a question? Just 
                    where, precisely did you learn the 
                    art of espionage?  From a book?  A

                    on your forehead.   You re here to

                                  TORY
                    No, I... heard about the miracle.

                                  TORY
                    All right, I have been watching. I 
                    watched these people, the way they

                                  BALTAR
                    Oh, very much so.

                      popularity borders on phenomenal 
                    and she should be very worried. 

                                  TORY
                    I came here on my own.

                    And I slept with your boss last 
                    night.

      Tory lets the remark pass. Takes off her blazer.

                                  HEAD BALTAR (O.S.)
                    Ah-ah -- be nice.

      WIDEN TO REVEAL HEAD BALTAR, sitting next to Tory. Baltar 
      looks ABSOLUTELY SPOOKED by this apparition.

      A little embarrassed, Tory looks down at her chest, which she

                    The thing is, somehow you seem to 
                    be at the center of them.

      The remark puts Baltar a little more at ease; flattery has 
      always been his Catnip. Head Baltar raises his eyebrows.

                                  BALTAR
                    Yes...so it seems... I m at a loss

      exactly what happened to her and the other Final Four. 

                                  HEAD BALTAR
                    Look at her, Gaius.  This woman is 
                    no spy. As hard as she s fought not 
                    to, she believes you.  That?  That 
                    is the face of truth.

      Aware of her surroundings once more -- after all, she really 
      isn t there at Laura s behest -- Tory rises to leave.

                                  TORY
                    I really shouldn t be seen here.  
                    Do you think we can... talk again?

      Baltar regards her for a moment.  

                                  BALTAR
                    All right.

                          (offers the bitten apple)
                    Would you...?

      She smiles, shakes her head, takes her blazer and exits. When 
      she s gone, Baltar s plastered smile immediately vanishes.

                    Who are you?  Another angel?  Six?  
                    Is it you?   In disguise?

                    Now why would she have to disguise 
                    herself from you?

      Natalie, a Sharon, and a Leoben at a stand table. They study 

      AN OBJECT 

      the size and width of a pen, made of stainless steel and 
      looks like an elongated egg timer filled with mercury the 
      color of Mercurochrome.

      Leoben nods.  As Boomer enters, Natalie discretely places THE

      By the unsavory look on Sharon s face, this is eminently

      comes to Boomer. Puts her arms around her and embraces her.

      FADE IN:


      Laura sits in a stuffed chair, abjectly bracing for the 
      miserable side effects of her latest chemo treatment to kick 
      in. She watches Adama, distracted, down his ambrosia then 
      shamble to his desk and re-fill his tumbler. 

                                  LAURA
                    You seem to be enjoying that more 
                    than usual.

                                  ADAMA
                    Hair of the dog.  Lee s party.

      Laura snorts.  Adama comes back, a hang-over crowded in his 
      skull, sits down.  Sips. A BEAT, then... 

                                  LAURA
                    So. What do we do?  Find Lampkin?  
                    Put her on trial?  Ask for a show 
                    of hands?  

                                  ADAMA
                    ...I don t know.

                                  LAURA
                    ...Follow her into an ambush?  

      Adama sips from his drink. Swallows hard. 

                                  ADAMA
                    She s...  driven...

                                  LAURA
                    Do you want to keep waltzing or ask 
                    me to sit down and talk?  What s 
                    going on, Bill?

      Laura watches Adama squirm a little. He grudgingly NODS.

                                  ADAMA
                    Look, I m not a spiritual person. 
                    But what if she s speaking the 
                    truth?  She was supposed to die 
                    back there.  But she didn t. I 
                    can t explain it. What if she s 
                    meant to help us?  Maybe it was 
                    a...

      He stops short.  Laura swoons from an admixture of the meds 
      and her mounting frustration with Adama.

                                  LAURA
                    A what?  "A miracle?  Is that what 
                    you'd like to call it?  Say it.  
                    C'mon, Bill, grab your piece of 
                    golden arrow. I want to hear 
                    Admiral Atheist say a miracle has 
                    happened.

                                  ADAMA
                    You shot at her and missed. 

                                  LAURA

                                  ADAMA
                    So does doubt.  

                                  LAURA
                    I pulled the trigger.  And I d pull 
                    it again. She wanted me to shoot 
                    her, she dared me to shoot her, she 
                    put her life in front of a bullet 
                    as if it meant nothing.  You break 
                    an egg, you reach for another one. 

                                  ADAMA
                    Maybe convincing you meant more to 
                    her than her own life. 

                                  LAURA
                    And that s your miracle? 

                                  ADAMA
                    No, that s not --

                    -- You want to talk about miracles?  
                    On the very day that a very pale 
                    doctor informed me that I had 
                    terminal cancer, most of humanity 
                    was annihilated. I survived. And by 
                    some mathematical absurdity, I 
                    became president. My cancer 
                      disappeared long enough for us to 
                    discover a way to earth.

      Horrified by what he just blurted out, Adama s face swirls

      pulls back, turns away and leaves her.

      STAY ON LAURA, despairing, leaning back, surrendering to the

                    Zarek nominated me for the vacant 
                    Quorum spot.

                                  KARA

                    Stop it.  His head s as big as the 
                    house I grew up in, but I m new at 
                    this and I can use the help. 
                    Besides, you know me, I never could 
                    say no to anything.

                      Especially you.

      Said without rancor. A PAUSE as their eyes do the talking... 
      until she breaks the spell. 

                                  KARA

                    Oh, right. Talk about leaving your 
                    mark. You bellied more birds than 
                    everyone combined.

      Again, the imposition of reality blunts the lighter moments.

                    I think I finally know what you 
                    mean about having a destiny. I have 
                    to go do this. The fact that I

                    On your way out, tell  em they re 
                    going the wrong way.

      They exchange a silent look, then rush into each other s 
      embrace and kiss -- a deep, and ungoverned kiss, the kind 
      that withers the weedy encroachment of life s illusory 
      miseries. They kiss again and again, pecking each other s 
      mouths and cheeks and chins and eyes with love, more powerful 
      than sensual.  As they hold each other...

                                  LEE
                    You ll make them believe you.

                                  KARA
                    I know. 

      They separate just enough to lean on each other s foreheads. 
      Lee takes Kara s hand now, places something in it.

                                  LEE
                    Take this.

      When she opens it, it s THE FIGURE HEAD. 

                                  LEE (cont d)
                    It was a going-away present from my 
                    father. First thing he ever gave me 
                    that wasn t picked out by my mother 
                    or a week late.

      Privately devastated, Kara forces a smile, tries to give it 
      back to him.

                                  KARA
                    Yeah.

      STAY ON THE FIGURE HEAD, in Kara s palm, as...


      CLOSE ON A RAIDER, FROM ABOVE, looking into its brain, with 
      the brain canopy removed. A POWER TOOL, some kind of suction 
      drill WHINES as it enters the brain cavity.

      THE RAIDER

      from below, as viscous blood pours down and pools. And now we 
      hear a sickening, LOWING METALLIC WAIL, as if an ocean liner 
      ripped in half by a tidal wave were harmonizing with a 
      drowning Brahma bull, so loud that it MORPHS into A TODDLER S 
      CRYING, as... 


      Inconsolable, NICKY stands with A TOY MODEL of a VIPER, its 
      cockpit opened and the boy sorrowfully points to it. 

                                  CALLY
                    Nicky lost his pilot.

      Tyrol, in sweat pants and a tee shirt, rolls out of bed.

                                  TYROL
                    Sure he didn t eat it?

      Searches under a bunk, while CALLY, sullen, looks on. Tyrol 
      comes up clutching the TOY VIPER PILOT that belongs in the 
      viper s cockpit. 

                                  TYROL (cont d)
                    There you go. Captain Tyrol flies again.

      Nicky beams and Tyrol lifts his son onto the bed, hands him 
      off to Cally. Cally smiles at Nick and sticks the pilot in 
      the cockpit for him, her eyes now shifted on Tyrol as he 
      stifles a YAWN.

      Nicky flies the viper around Tyrol s head.

                                  TYROL
                    Uh-nh.  Slept like a rock.

      Deserted.  PANNING the empty seats.  The insignias, framed 
      photos on the walls. CAP schedules.  Then...

      LEE

      standing behind the podium. Takes it all in.  Then steps down 
      from the podium for the last time.


      Darkness. The silhouettes of two bodies intimately entwined 
      and the sublime iambic rustle of love-making.  But something 
      else pricks the ears now: WEEPING. And it s getting stronger -
      - staccato sips of air, then a despairing moan. 

                                  BALTAR S VOICE 
                    Am I hurting you?

      A small light CLICKS on. Baltar, propped up over Tory, looks 
      into her face, wet with tears.

                                  BALTAR

                    Yes, well, I m afraid it s drizzled 
                    on the campfire...

                    I m sorry. I m really sorry.

      Baltar furtively rolls his eyes, not so much that he s bored 
      but because he s exasperated and seems to be making the 
      situation worse. He sits up, next to her.

                                  BALTAR
                    Now don t be sorry. You... you 
                    should be thankful that you possess 
                    such an abundance of feeling.

                    I suppose I could be a Cylon.

                          (clears his throat)
                    Well, I don t know... Humans don t

                      suffering.  Cylons can feel.

                    I didn t until I lived among them. 
                    Mankind may ve made them, just as 
                    we gave birth to each other. But 
                    God is at the beginning of the 
                    string. God, the one true God, gave 
                    them a soul.

                    Yes. No one else. And I m so weary 
                    of holding that in. Denying that 
                    truth.
                          (pauses to look at her)
                    I suspect I shall be arrested 
                    tomorrow.

      Not a chance. Tory looks up at him with love-pious eyes. 
      Baltar humbly turns away, and there is HEAD BALTAR, sitting 
      next to him on the bed.

                                  HEAD BALTAR
                    Well played.

                    There you go, man.  Have yourself a 
                    good cry.

      STAY ON HEAD BALTAR, content. He likes to watch...


      Adama, alone. Stands there and gazes at KARA S VIPER. Runs 
      his hand over her name, painted on the side. His face knotted 
      by inner turmoil, he stares hard at the Viper as if the truth 
      or at the very least, a course of action lay hidden among the 
      rivets and seams. TYROL, back in his orange jump suit, ambles 
      near Adama, who doesn t take his eyes off Kara s Viper. 
      Sensing Adama s desolation, Tyrol keeps his distance, but 
      tries to make conversation.

                                  TYROL
                    Real head-scratcher, isn t it?
                          (adding)
                    Sir.
                          (then)
                    If it could get on its hind legs 
                    and talk
                          (clears his throat)
                    we d have some answers.

                                  ADAMA
                    Get it in the launch tube.

      Tyrol s face screws up. 

                                  TYROL
                    Sir?

                                  ADAMA
                    I m taking it up.

      Now Tyrol looks like he took a spear to the shoulder blades. 
      His eyes do a lightning-fast once-over of Adama s physique. 

                                  TYROL
                    You??  Sir, I think --

                    two flight suits together, I m 
                    going up. Now, do it!

      And Adama strides off, as we...

      NATALIE standing in front of a table where Cavil, two Simons, 
      and two Dorals are sharing some drink.

                    You know how much I hate that name, 
                     Cavil?  Well, of course you do -- 
                    Natalie.  That was your name on 
                    Gemenon, wasn t it?  

                                    NATALIE

                    Great job, by the way. Posing as a 
                    reform advocate. Natalie Faust, 
                     Leading the charge against 
                    political corruption.  And thanks 
                    to you, we knew where all the 
                    Gemenese leaders were when we 
                    launched the nukes. Some died in 
                    the arms of their mistresses.

      Natalie pauses. Then...

      TWO GLEAMING CENTURIONS march in and take position on each 
      side of Natalie.  Cavil rolls his eyes. Wearily aggravated.

                                  CAVIL

                    They re not here to vote, Cavil.

      Natalie NODS her head to The Centurions. Cavil watches in 
      disbelief as The Centurions  appendages morph into machine 
      guns.  The Centurions have armed themselves.

      already standing. 


      ROARING in agony.  He passes through an Astroid field.

                    Think of it as a little keepsake.

                    None.  You can t do anything

                                    NATALIE
                    No... we can t do anything with 
                    one. So we re finished voting.

      Cavil, The Simons, and The Dorals are startled by distant 
      MACHINE GUN FIRE, coming from throughout the ship.

                    The first thing they learned was 
                    what you re doing to the Raiders. 
                    You can imagine how they felt.

      The Centurions take a few steps forward, heads menacingly

      LAURA, pale and swooning. FLASHING ON LEE, closing his hand 
      on THE FIGURE HEAD. In a fit of anger and frustration, Adama 
      FIRES his machine guns, bullying the red buttons with his 
      thumbs. FIRING, FIRING, FIRING at

      Adama blowing away pieces of rock and astroid.


      FIRE CEASELESSLY on Cavil, The Simons and The Dorals, bullets 
      RIPPING the room apart, lights POPPING, glass shattering, 
      clouds of dust, a Kandinsky spatter of blood on the ceiling.


      TEARS of rage fall from his eyes, all of his frustration and 
      conflict channelled into those machine guns, BLASTING AWAY at 
      nothing but space until the guns are hot, smoking and empty.
