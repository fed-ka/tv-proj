Michael continues the tour
MICHAEL
And these delusionals are the White
Rastae.
Several white boys in dreadlocks and Jamaican knit berets
lounge on the grass.
A cloud of pot smoke hovers above them
MICHAEL
(continuing)
Big Marley fans.
Think they're black.
Semi-political, but mostly, they watch a
lot of Wild Kingdom, if you know what I
mean.
Michael waves to DEREK, the one with the longest dreads.
MICHAEL
(continuing)
Derek - save some for after lunch, bub?
DEREK
(very stoned)
Michael, my brother, peace
Cameron turns to follow Michael as they walk into the
cafeteria.
CAMERON
So where do you fit in all this?
Mandella and Kat sit down in the quiet corner. They are
eating a carton of yogurt with gusto.
MANDELLA
Your sister is so amazingly without.
She'll never read him.
She has no idea.
Kat attacks
KAT
The fact that you're cutting gym so you
can T.A. Sophomore English just to hear
his name, is a little without in itself
if you ask me.
Kat's attention is caught by Patrick as he walks by with his
friends, lighting up a cigarette.
Mandella notices her
staring.
MANDELLA
Who's that?
KAT
Patrick Verona
Random skid.
MANDELLA
That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone
for a year? I heard he was doing porn
movies.
KAT
I'm sure he's completely incapable of
doing anything that interesting.
MANDELLA
He always look so
KAT
Block E?
Kat turns back to face Mandella and forces her yogurt into
Mandella's hand.
KAT
(continuing)
Mandella, eat.
Starving yourself is a
very slow way to die.
MANDELLA
Just a little.
She eats.
Kat sees her wrist
KAT
What's this?
MANDELLA
An attempted slit.
Kat stares at her, expressionless.
KAT
I realize that the men of this fine
institution are severely lacking, but
killing yourself so you can be with
William Shakespeare is beyond the scope
of normal teenage obsessions.
You're
venturing far past daytime talk show
fodder and entering the world of those
who need very expensive therapy.
MANDELLA
But imagine the things he'd say during
sex.
Thinks a minute
KAT
Okay, say you do it.
You kill
yourself, you end up in wherever you end
up and he's there.
Do you really think
he's gonna wanna dace a ninety pound
compulsive who failed volleyball?
Mandella's attention is struck by Bianca
ACROSS THE COURTYARD
As she and Chastity parade by Joey and his COHORTS
One of
the cohorts elbows Joey.
COHORT
Virgin alert.
Joey looks up and smiles at Bianca.
JOEY
Lookin' good, ladies.
Bianca smiles her coyest of smiles.
BACK TO KAT AND MANDELLA Still watching.
MANDELLA
Tragic.
Doesn't respond
ANOTHER ANGLE
Michael and Cameron observe Joey's leers at Bianca from
their bench in another corner. Cowboys eating cue of a can
of beans linger on the grass behind them.
CAMERON
Why do girls like that always like guys
like that?
MICHAEL
Because they're bred to.
Their mothers
liked guys like that, and their
grandmothers before them. Their gene
pool is rarely diluted.
CAMERON
He always have that shit-eating grin?
MICHAEL
Joey Dorsey?
Perma-shit-grin.
I wish
I could say he's a moron, but he's
number twelve in the class.
And a
model.
Mostly regional stuff, but he's
rumored to have a big tube sock ad
coming out.
The BELL rings, and the cowboys stand and spit into their
empty bean cans.
Cameron and Michael rise as Cameron tries
to catch a glimpse of Bianca as she walks back inside.
MICHAEL
(continuing)
You know French?
CAMERON
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
MICHAEL
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
CAMERON
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to
her?
MICHAEL
You could consecrate with her, my
friend.
Cameron watches as Bianca flounces back into the building.
Kat and Mandella walk toward Kat's car.
Joey pulls up
beside her in his Viper.
JOEY
(re her dress)
The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't
you been reading your Sassy?
KAT
Yeah, and I noticed the only part of
you featured in your big Kmart spread
was your elbow.
Tough break.
JOEY
(practically
spitting)
They're running the rest of me next
month.
He zooms away as Kat yanks open the door of her Dart.
Mandella ties a silk scarf around her head, as if they're in
a convertible.
KAT
The people at this school are so
incredibly foul.
MANDELLA
You could always go with me.
I'm sure
William has some friends.
They watch Joey's car as he slows next to Bianca and
Chastity as they walk toward the school bus.
ON BIANCA AND CHASTITY
JOEY
Need a ride, ladies?
Bianca and Chastity can't get in Joey's car fast enough.
He
pulls away with a smile.
BACK TO KAT AND MANDELLA
Mandella lowers her sunglasses to watch.
MANDELLA
That's a charming new development
Kat doesn't answer, but reaches over and puts a tape in the
tape deck.
The sounds of JOYFUL PUNK ROCK fill the car.
As they pull out, Michael crosses in front of them on his
moped. Kat has to SLAM the brakes to keep from hitting him
KAT
(yelling)
Remove head from sphincter!
Then
pedal!
Michael begins fearfully, pedaling as Kat PEELS out, angry
at the delay.
Cameron rushes over
CAMERON
You all right?
He slows to a stop
MICHAEL
Yeah, just a minor encounter with the
shrew.
CAMERON
That's her?
Bianca's sister?
MICHAEL
The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.
Michael putters off, leaving Cameron dodging Patrick's
grimy, grey Jeep -- a vehicle several years and many paint
jobs away from its former glory as a REGULATION MAIL TRUCK -
- as he sideswipes several cars on his way out of the lot.
Kat and the rest of the team go through a grueling practice
session.
Kat spares no one as she whips the ball all over
the field.
Patrick sits on the bleachers nearby, watching.
A cigarette
dangles from his mouth.
His pal, SCURVY is next to him.
MR. CHAPIN, the coach, blows the WHISTLE.
MR. CHAPIN
(proudly)
Good run, Stratford.
Kat nods in response, and the girls leave the field. Patrick
hops down to follow.
PATRICK
Hey. Girlie.
Kat stops and turns slowly to look at him.
PATRICK
(continuing)
I mean Wo-man.
How ya doin'?
KAT
(smiles brightly)
Sweating like a pig, actually.
And
yourself?
PATRICK
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
KAT
My mission in life.
She stands there undaunted, hand on hip.
KAT
(continuing)
Obviously, I've struck your fancy. So,
you see, it worked.
The world makes
sense again.
Patrick's eyes narrow.
He steps closer.
PATRICK
Pick you up Friday, then
KAT
Oh, right.
Friday.
PATRICK backs up a little.
He uses his most seductive tone
PATRICK
The night I take you to places you've
never been before.
And back.
KAT
Like where?
The 7-Eleven on Burnside?
Do you even know my name, screwboy?
PATRICK
I know a lot more than that
Kat stares at him.
KAT
Doubtful.
Very doubtful.
She walks away quickly, leaving him standing alone.
PATRICK
(calling after her)
You're no bargain either, sweetheart.
Scurvy appears at his side
SCURVY
So I guess the Jeep won't be getting a
new Blaupunkt.
ACROSS THE FIELD Cameron and Michael watch.
MICHAEL
He took the bait.
STRATFORD HOUSE/BATHROOM - NIGHT
Kat washes her face at the sink.
Bianca appears behind her,
and attempts to twist Kat's hair into a chignon.
She wacks Bianca away.
BIANCA
Have you ever considered a new look? I
mean, seriously, you could have some
potential buried under all this
hostility.
Kat pushes past her into the hallway.
KAT
I have the potential to smack the crap
out of you if you don't get out of my
way.
BIANCA
Can you at least start wearing a bra?
Kat SLAMS her door in response.
Kat emerges from a music store carrying a bag of CDs in
her
teeth, and fumbling through her purse with both hands.
She
finds her keys and pulls them out with a triumphant tug.
She looks up and finds Patrick sitting on the hood of her
car
PATRICK
Nice ride. Vintage fenders.
Kat takes the bag out of her mouth.
KAT
Are you following me?
PATRICK
I was in the laundromat. I saw your
car. Thought I'd say hi.
KAT
Hi
She gets in and starts the car.
PATRICK
You're not a big talker, are you?
KAT
Depends on the topic. My fenders don't
really whip me into a verbal frenzy.
She starts to pull out, and is blocked by Joey's Viper,
which pulls up perpendicular to her rear and parks.
Joey and his groupies emerge and head for the liquor store
KAT
(continuing)
Hey -- do you mind?
JOEY
Not at all
They continue on into the store.
Kat stares at them in
disbelief...
Then BACKS UP
Her vintage fenders CRASH into the door of Joey's precious
Viper.
Patrick watches with a delighted grin Joey races out of the
liquor store.
JOEY
(continuing)
You fucking bitch!
Kat pulls forward and backs into his car again.
Smiling
sweetly.
A happy black and white neon skunk sprays fine mist on the
line of kids below.
Patrick's mail truck clatters to a stop out front.
The crowd files out of the club, Kat and Mandella amongst
them.
A^ they're walking toward the parking lot, Patrick
coasts by in his truck.
The gears GRIND.
He yells out the
window.
MANDELLA
What'd he say?
KAT
Who cares?
Mandella watches Kat as she stares after Patrick
MANDELLA
Has he importun'd you with love in
honourable fashion?
Kat glances sharply at her.
MANDELLA
(continuing; off
her look)
Don't be Cruella with me.
I'm in favor
of romance.
You're the one that wants
to march on Washington every five
minutes.
Kat pokes her, then looks back at the club dreamily.
KAT
Gigglepuss was so beyond.
Mandella nods.
MANDELLA
They were.
I only wish William could
have been here to witness the rebirth of
punk rock with us.
Kat links her arm through Mandella's and they head for the
car.
KAT
So true.
Kat sits outside waiting for her appointment, bored and
annoyed.
The door opens and Miss Perky escorts Patrick out
MISS PERKY
You're completely demented.
PATRICK
(cheery)
See you next week!
Kat stands and Patrick sees her.
Miss Perky watches in horror
MISS PERKY
You two know each other?
PATRICK/KAT
Yeah/No.
Miss Perky grabs Kat and shoves her into her office.
MISS PERKY
(to Patrick)
Dear God, stay away from her.
If you
two ever decided to breed, evil would
truly walk the earth.
Patrick gives Kat one last look before the door shuts, then
smiles-
The lights are on, illuminating the yard
Patrick marches Kat around the yard, holding her up
KAT
This is so patronizing.
PATRICK
Leave it to you to use big words when
you're shitfaced.
KAT
Why 're you doing this?
PATRICK
I told you
KAT
You don't care if I die
PATRICK
Sure, I do
KAT
Why?
PATRICK
Because then I'd have to start taking
out girls who like me.
KAT
Like you could find one
PATRICK
See that?
Who needs affection when
I've got blind hatred?
KAT
Just let me sit down.
He walks her over to the swingset and plops her down in a
swing, moving her hands to hang onto the chains.
PATRICK
How's that?
She sits and looks at him for a moment with a smile. Then
FALLS over backward.
PATRICK
(continuing)
Jesus.
You're like a weeble
Patrick rushes to right her, then starts pushing her on the
swing to keep her entertained.
PATRICK
(continuing)
Why'd you let him get to you?
KAT
Who?
PATRICK
Dorsey.
KAT
I hate him.
PATRICK
I know.
It'd have to be a pretty big
deal to get you to mainline tequila. You
don't seem like the type.
KAT
(holding up a
drunken head)
Hey man. . .
You don ' t think I can
be "cool"?
You don't think I can be
"laid back" like everyone else?
PATRICK
(slightly
sarcastic)
I thought you were above all that
KAT
You know what they say
He stops the swing
PATRICK
No. What do they say?
Kat is asleep, her head resting against the swing's chains.
PATRICK
(continuing)
Shit!
He drags her to her feet and starts singing loudly.
PATRICK
(continuing)
Jingle Bells! Jingle Belles! Wake up
damn it!
He sits her down on the slide and shakes her like a rag
doll.
PATRICK
(continuing)
Kat! Wake up!
KAT
(waking)
What?
He sighs with relief.
PATRICK
I thought you were...
They share some meaningful eye contact. And then she PUKES
on his shoes.
Cameron sits next to Patrick on the bleachers as they watch
Kat's practice.
CAMERON
She hates you with the fire of a
thousand suns .
That's a direct quote
PATRICK
She just needs time to cool off I'll
give it a day.
A PUCK flies at them from the field, narrowly missing their
heads.
PATRICK
(continuing)
Maybe two.
He looks at Cameron.
PATRICK
(continuing)
You makin' any headway?
CAMERON
She kissed me.
PATRICK
(eyebrow raised)
Where?
Joey leans against Patrick's Jeep.
Patrick is inside.
PATRICK
I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the
flowers.
Another hundred for the tux --
JOEY
Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I
know.
He pulls out his wallet and hands Patrick a wad of money
JOEY
(continuing)
Take it
Patrick does, with a smile, as he ROARS out of the parking
lot.
Mr. Chapin patrols as boys and girls shoot arrows at targets
Joey swaggers up to Bianca, who is taking careful aim.
Chastity watches from across the row.
JOEY
Hey, sweet cheeks.
BIANCA
(not looking at
him)
Hi, Joey.
JOEY
You're concentrating awfully hard
considering it's gym class.
She lets the arrow go and turns to look at him.
JOEY
(continuing)
Listen, I want to talk to you about the
prom.
BIANCA
You know the deal.
I can ' t go if Kat
doesn't go --
In the background, a RASTA crumples to the ground.
Hit
A casualty of Gym.
Mr. Chapin scurries over.
JOEY
Your sister is going.
Bianca looks at him, surprised
BIANCA
Since when?
Joey takes the bow and arrow from Bianca's hand.
He draws
back and takes aim.
JOEY
I'm taking care of it.
Chastity looks over from her spot on the field, but keeps
lips firmly shut.
Kat arrives at the tree. looking around breathlessly, seeing
no one.
KAT
He left!
I sprung the dickhead and he
cruised on me.
PATRICK
(0. S.)
Look up, sunshine
She does.
He's still in the tree
PATRICK
I guess I never told you I'm afraid of
heights.
KAT
(smiling)
C'mon.
It's not that bad
PATRICK
Try lookin' at it from this angle
She assesses the branch structure
KAT
Put your right foot there --
PATRICK
Forget it.
I'm stayin'.
KAT
You want me to climb up and show you
how to get down?
PATRICK
(voice trembling)
Maybe.
She sighs and dose so.
When she gets to his level, she
perches on the branch next to him.
He grins at her.
Then swings himself down with the grace and ease of a
monkey, leaving her sitting there, realizing she's been
duped.
KAT
You shit!
She climbs down after him
Patrick and Kat walk amongst the games
KAT
The Partridge Family?
PATRICK
I figured it had to be something
ridiculous to win your respect.
And
piss you off.
KAT
Good call.
PATRICK
So how'd you get Chapin to look the
other way?
KAT
I dazzled him with my wit
She stops and picks up a toy gun that SHOOTS water at
giggling hyenas and wails on it.
The barker hands her a
stuffed animal as her prize.
She hands it to the small KID
next to her and they continue walking.
PATRICK
(sarcastic)
A soft side? Who knew?
KAT
Yeah, well, don't let it get out
PATRICK
So what's your excuse?
KAT
Acting the way we do.
PATRICK
Yes
KAT
I don't like to do what people expect.
Then they expect it all the time and
they get disappointed when you change.
PATRICK
So if you disappoint them from the
start, you're covered?
KAT
Something like that
PATRICK
Then you screwed up
KAT
How?
PATRICK
You never disappointed me.
She blushes under his gaze
PATRICK
(continuing)
You up for it?
KAT
For. . . ?
He motions to the SIGN for a paint-ball game. She grins
SERIES OF SHOTS:
The two of them creep through the paint-ball course,
stealthy and full of the desire to best the other.
Patrick nails Kat in the back with a big glob of red paint
Kat gets him in the chest with a glob of blue.
Patrick returns fire with a big yellow splat to the side of
her face.
Kat squirts a green shot to his forehead After a few more
shots, they're both covered in paint
She tries to shoot him again, only to find that her gun is
empty.
KAT
(continuing)
Damn it!
Patrick grabs her in a victorious tackle.
They land,
laughing.
It's hard to even recognize them, as their hair and faces
are so smeared with paint globs, but they still manage to
find each other's eyes.
He wipes a smear of blue paint away from her lips,
as he
goes to kiss her.
NEARBY The kid with the stuffed animal, points
KID
Look, Mom
His mother hurries him away. What's started as a tackle has
turned into a passionate kiss
Patrick pulls up in Kat's driveway.
Their paint wardrobe
has dried by now and they look like refugees from some
strange, yet colorful, war.
KAT
State trooper?
PATRICK
Fallacy.
KAT
The duck?
PATRICK
Hearsay.
KAT
I know the porn career's a lie.
He shuts off the car and turns to her.
PATRICK
Do you?
He kisses her neck.
It tickles.
She laughs.
KAT
Tell me something true.
PATRICK
I hate peas.
KAT
No -- something real.
Something no one
else knows.
PATRICK
(in-between kisses)
You're sweet.
And sexy.
And
completely hot for me.
KAT
What?
PATRICK
No one else knows
KAT
You're amazingly self-assured. Has
anyone ever told you that?
PATRICK
Go to the prom with me
Kat's smile disappears.
KAT
Is that a request or a command?
PATRICK
You know what I mean
KAT
No.
PATRICK
No what?
KAT
No, I won't go with you
PATRICK
Why not?
KAT
Because I don't want to. It's a stupid
tradition.
Patrick sits quietly, torn. He can't very well tell her he
being paid to take her.
PATRICK
People won't expect you to go...
Kat turns to him, getting angry.
KAT
Why are you doing this?
KAT
All of it -- what's in it for you?
He sits silently, not looking at her, confirming her
suspicions.
KAT
(continuing)
Create a little drama?
Start a new
rumor?
What?
PATRICK
So I have to have a motive to be with
you?
KAT
You tell me.
PATRICK
You need therapy.
Has anyone ever told
you that?
KAT
(quietly)
Answer the question, Patrick
PATRICK
(angry)
Nothing!
There's nothing in it for me.
Just the pleasure of your company.
He takes out a cigarette.
She breaks it in half before she
SLAMS the car door and walks into the house.
Patrick PEELS out of the driveway. Kat turns at the front
door and watches him go
Patrick pulls up to a stop light and waits for .the green
He glances over at A DRUNKEN HOMELESS GUY in the median, who
has decided that he doesn't need to wear pants.
Patrick pulls out his wallet, takes the wad of money Joey
gave him and hands it to the homeless guy.
PATRICK
cover that up
The light turns green and Patrick pulls away
A sprinkler cruises the lawn.
Kat walks to her car alone. When she opens the door, she's
greeted with a Fender Stratocaster guitar, reclining in the
front seat.
She picks it up slowly, inspecting every detail, then spins
around.
Patrick stands there, smiling.
KAT
A Fender Strat. You bought this?
PATRICK
I thought you could use it. When you
start your band.
She doesn't answer, but hides a smile, so he walks
closer.
PATRICK
(continuing)
Besides, I had some extra cash. Some
asshole paid me to take out a really
great girl.
KAT
Is that right?
PATRICK
Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for
her.
Blushes and looks down.
PATRICK
(continuing)
You know -- it's not every day you find
a girl who'll flash her tits to get you
out of detention.
Looks up. surprised and embarrassed that he found out
He takes her upturned face as a sign to kiss her and he does
She lets him this time.
Then breaks it off
KAT
You can't just buy me a guitar every
time you screw up, you know.
He grimaces.
PATRICK
I know
He quiets her with another kiss Which she breaks off again.
KAT
And don't just think you can
He kisses her again, not letting her end it this time.
STRATFORD HOUSE - SUNSET
We hear the sounds of MUSIC and LAUGHTER.
STRATFORD HOUSE/BACKYARD - SUNSET
Patrick is at the barbecue grill, flipping burgers.
Kat
watches.
KAT
Why is my veggie burger the only burnt
object on this grill?
PATRICK
Because I like to torture you.
KAT
Oh, Bianca?
Can you get me my freshman
yearbook?
PATRICK
Don ' t you even dare. . .
ON BIANCA AND CAMERON As they argue on the patio.
CAMERON
They do to!
BIANCA
They do not!
Rises to get the yearbook.
CAMERON
Can someone please tell her that
sunflower seeds come from sunflowers?
ON MICHAEL AND MANDELLA
Severely making-out in a lawn chair.
She comes up for a
breath.
MANDELLA
I can't remember a word of Shakespeare
right now. Isn't that weird?
Michael pulls her back down for another round ON KAT AND
PATRICK
She tries to keep him from grabbing the yearbook that Bianca
now hands her.
KAT
You're freaked over this, aren't you?
Bianca hands her the yearbook
BIANCA
He's more than freaked.
He's froke
Flips to a page.
KAT
I'd like to call your attention to
Patrick Verona's stunning bad-ass look
of 1995 ---
INSERT - A horrifically nerdy freshman year picture Glasses,
bad hair, headgear -- the works.
She holds up the picture for all to view. Patrick cringes
and throws a handful of pretzels at her.
BIANCA
Patrick -- is that- a.
KAT
Perm?
PATRICK
Ask my attorney.
Kat and Bianca huddle over the picture, giggling --
as we
CRANE UP and hear a GIRLY PUNK version of The Partridge
Family's "I Think I Love You".
