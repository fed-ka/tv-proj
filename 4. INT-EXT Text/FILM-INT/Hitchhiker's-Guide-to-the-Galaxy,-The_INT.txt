CLOSE ON the clock radio from which the voice emanates.
A hand shuts it off. ARTHUR DENT is awake. 30's. Kind
faced. His feet land perfectly in slippers as he stands
and shuffles out of his very neat but very boring room.

IN THE BATHROOM - Arthur gargles in front of the mirror.

He bends over to spit revealing a YELLOW BULLDOZER
through the window, crawling toward his house. A TEA
KETTLE WHISTLES O.S.

Arthur sets the newspaper (with the headline "DOLPHINS
VANISH") on the table, removes the kettle. Doesn't notice
through the window 3 MORE LARGE YELLOW BULLDOZERS.
He pours a cup of tea, sets the pot down next o his
mobile phone. He picks it up, stares at a DIGITAL PHOTO
ON THE SCREEN of himself and a very pretty woman (Tricia)
at a costume party.
He presses the phone to his head as if it were a cold
compress. Suddenly, there's a LOUD RUMBLING o.s. The
tea cup RATTLES. Arthur looks out the window. Now he
sees the bulldozers.
The tea cup shatters on the floor.

Ford and Arthur enter the half-full pub. Ford hurries to

FORD
Six pints of bitter. And quickly.
The
world's about to end.
BARMAN
Oh yes, sir? Nice weather for it.
He starts to pull pints. Ford shoves bar peanuts into
his pockets while Arthur shouts into his phone...
ARTHUR
Well, when does he get back from lunch?
Or is he going straight out for tea?!
He shuts the phone, sits, looking forlorn.
ARTHUR (CONT'D)
This is shaping up to be a crap day.

There you are, six pints.
Ford slaps down a 50 note. The barman's impressed.
FORD
Keep the change. You've got ten minutes to
spend it.
Ford pushes three pints in front of Arthur.
ARTHUR
Three? At lunchtime?
FORD
Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so.
ARTHUR
Very deep. You should send that in to the
Reader's Digest. They've got a page for
people like you.
FORD
Drink up.
ARTHUR
Why three pints?
FORD
Muscle relaxant.
(grabbing more peanuts)
And eat these. You'll need the salt.
ARTHUR
What's going on. Ford?
FORD
What would you say if I told you I wasn't
really from Guilford but from a small
planet somewhere in the vicinity of
Eetelgeuse?
ARTHUR
Why, is it the sort of thing you're likely
to say?
FORD
Remember when we met? That car was racing
toward me, I was trying to greet it, you
pushed me out of the way?

Arthur drops his shopping, dives at him and tackles him
out of the way as the car zooms past.

FORD
Didn't you find it a little strange that I
was trying to shake hands with a car?
ARTHUR
I assumed you were drunk.
FORD
(shaking his head)
I thought cars were the dominant life
form. I was trying to introduce myself.
ARTHUR
And that's why you're named after a
discontinued car from the seventies?
FORD
(nodding)
You saved my life that day.
Now I'm
saving yours.
Arthur just stares at him, then turns to his beer.
ARTHUR
This must be Thursday. I never could get
the hang of Thursdays.
FORD
Look, if it's about your house...
ARTHUR
No, it's not that.
It's....
He shows Ford the photo of he and Tricia on his phone.
ARTHUR (CONT'D)
I found her. Ford. The perfect girl. I
found her, and then I let her get away.

Everyone is in costume.

I can't bear those sort of parties, didn't

Anything. But there I was -- and then,
there she was...
Arthur, dressed in safari attire complete with pith helmet,
sits off to the side, observing, looking miserable.
TRICIA (O.S.)
Who are you?
Arthur looks up. TRICIA MCMILLAN is dressed in a mid
19th century mens suit with mutton chop sideburns and is
holding a taxidermy beagle -- and she still looks
beautiful.
Arthur, ever the gentleman, stands.
ARTHUR
I'm Arthur. Arthur Dent.
TRICIA
No, I mean who are you?
ARTHUR
Oh, the costume. Right. Er, um...
(sheepishly tipping his hat)
Livingston, I presume.

Granted. Not as clever as Darwin, but the

ARTHUR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
She was amazing, Ford. Witty, and
beautiful, and brilliant. Four or five
degrees. One in math, one in astrophysics,
another in biology...
TRICIA
I've got so many degrees I am officially
unemployable. Let's drink to that!
They clink their wine glasses, take sips, continue to chat.
ARTHUR (V.O.)
And just as I was asking myself, "Why is
this stunning and intelligent woman even
giving me the time of day, out of nowhere
she says...
TRICIA
Let's go somewhere.
ARTHUR
Yeah. It is a bit noisy. There's a

TRICIA
I was thinking Madagascar.

He's a Welsh Collie.
He'd feel all out of

Trillian forces a smile, clearly disappointed.
ZAPHOD (O.S.)
You don't want to go to Madagascar.
They both turn to face ZAPHOD BEEBLEBROX - very charming,
extremely handsome - whose attire seems very "other
worldly." Knee high boots, a yellow sash...
ZAPHOD (CONT'D)
Hi. I'm Zaphod Beeblebrox, President of

Picture mission control in Houston. WORKERS scramble.
Monitors line the wall showing hundreds of news reports

Suddenly, there's a loud HUM through the speakers,
followed by loud GARGLES and SCREECHING. Then...
JELTZ {THROUGH SPEAKERS)
People of Earth, this is Prostetnic Vogon
Jeltz of the Galactic Hyperspace planning
council.

13
A FAMILY at breakfast, baffled that their cutlery, bowls
and glasses resonate with the sound of Jeltz's voice.
JELTZ (VOICE ONLY)
As you are probably aware, plans for the
development of the outlying regions of the
galaxy involve the building of a
hyperspace express route through your star
system...

16
The VOGON BRIDGE is like a waterlogged old Skoda.
JELTZ (INTO THE P.A.)
There's no point in acting all surprised
about it. The plans and demolition orders
have been on display at your local planning
office in Alpha Centauri for fifty of your
Earth years, so you've had plenty of time
to lodge formal complaints.

What do you mean you've never been to
Alpha Centauri? Oh, for heaven's sake
mankind, it's only four light years away

bothered to take an interest in local
affairs that's your own lookout.

Like a giant casino going down in Vegas, there are a few

The Vogon ships slowly retreat in formation, leaving
nothing but DARKNESS AND STARS.
21
Then a distant RED GLOW appears. As it gets nearer we
21
see that it says..."THE HITCHHIKERS GUIDE TO THE GALAXY."
GUIDE VOICE
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a
wholly remarkable book...
The title draws nearer. We see that it sits on an
electronic book with lots of buttons.
GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)
...Perhaps the most remarkable, certainly
the most successful book ever to come out
of the great publishing corporations of
Ursa Minor.
The book opens revealing TWO SCREENS. Images appear. A
star map, layers of data, captions, video, animations...
GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)
More popular than the CELESTIAL HOME CARE
OMNIBUS, better selling than 53 MORE
THINGS TO DO IN ZERO GRAVITY, and more
controversial than Oolon Colluphid's
trilogy of philosophical blockbusters,
WHERE GOD WENT WRONG, SOME MORE OF GOD'S
GREATEST MISTAKES, and WHO IS THIS GOD
PERSON, ANYWAY?
Now the images rise up from the screen like holographs as
the book "presents itself" like some hi-tech infomercial.
GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)
In many of the more relaxed civilizations
on the Outer Eastern Rim of the Galaxy,
the Hitchhiker's Guide has already
supplanted the great Encyclopedia
Galactica as the standard repository of
all knowledge and wisdom. For though it
has many omissions, and contains much
which is apocryphal, or at least wildly
inaccurate, it scores over the older, more
pedestrian work in two important respects.
First, it is slightly cheaper. And second,
it has the words "DON'T PANIC" printed in
large friendly letters on its cover.
The book closes. The words "DON'T PANIC" appear just
below the title, blinking like a tacky diner marquee.
PULL BACK FROM THE GUIDE to find Arthur holding it, the
blinking light illuminating his very disoriented face.

So you're not from Guilford, which would

work actor -- but rather a writer for
this...this...book thing.
Ford nods.
Arthur rubs his weary brow.
ARTHUR (CONT'D)
I don't feel well. I need a cup of tea.
Ford hands him a fistful of peanuts.
FORD
Here. Eat these. If you've never been
through a transmat beam before you've
probably lost some salt and protein.
Arthur eats some peanuts, sits up, squints. Ford feels
his way around the room, looking for something.
ARTHUR
If I asked where we were would I regret
FORD
We're safe. For now.
ARTHUR
Good.
FORD
We're in a storage hold in one of

Obviously some strange usage of the word
safe I wasn't previously aware of.

Ford throws Arthur a towel. Arthur looks confused.
FORD (CONT'D)
It's a tough galaxy. You want to survive
out here, you really gotta know where your
towel is. Now gimme a hand over here.
Arthur joins Ford near a rusty ventilation pipe.
FORD (CONT'D)
Careful, it's hot.
He slides the towel behind the pipe, holding each end of
it, Arthur does the same.
FORD (CONT'D)
We've got to get off this ship before the
Vogons find us. Vogons hate hitchhikers.
Which is why they make ships with walls
that won't allow the Sub-Etna signal to
pass through. So we've got to send the
signal up and out if we wanna catch a
ride. Pull.
They both pull. A section of pipe snaps off. Steam
shoots out. Ford holds the black Thumb under the pipe.
ARTHUR
What's a Vogon?
FORD

Vogons are one of the most unpleasant
races in the Galaxy - not evil, but bad-
tempered, bureaucratic, officious and
callous. They wouldn't even lift a finger
to save their own grandmothers from the
Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal without
orders signed in triplicate, sent in, sent
back, queried, lost, found, subjected to
public inquiry, lost again, and finally
buried in soft peat for three months and
recycled as fire-lighters.
Arthur touches 'HOW TO HAVE FUN WITH.'
GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)
The best way to get a drink out of a Vogon
is to stick your finger down his throat.
Arthur touches 'WHAT TO AVOID'.
GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)
On no account should you allow a Vogon to
read poetry to you.
FORD
They can't think, they can't imagine, most
of them can't even spell. They just run
things.
(turns dial opposite direction)
And if we don't get a ride soon, you won't
b need the guide to illustrate just how
unpleasant the Vogons can be.
They've destroyed a planet today, that
always makes them a little feisty.

Ford removes a small yellow fish from his pouch. He

speech centres of the brain, the practical
upshot of which is that if you stick one in
your ear, you instantly understand anything

Arthur continues to struggle, until he passes a portal
window. He backs up to look out.
GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)
Now, it is such a bizarrely improbable
thing that anything so mind-bogglingly

The second worst is that of the Azgoths of
Kria. During a recitation by their Poet
Master Grunthos the Flatulent of his poem
"Ode to a Small Lump of Green Putty I Found
in My Armpit One Midsummer Morning," four
of his audience died of internal
hemorrhaging, and the President of the Mid-
Galactic Arts Nobbling Council survived by
gnawing one of his own legs off.

REPORTER (ON TV)
...and of course, the top story is still
the sensational theft of the new
Improbability Drive prototype ship Heart of
Gold last week, stolen at the launch
ceremony by none other than Galactic
President Zaphod Beeblebrox.
ZAPHOD (ON TV)
So, in the name of the people and freedom
and, I dunno, democracy and stuff like
that, I hereby declare this ship
officially stolen!
PULL BACK to reveal ZAPHOD BEEBLEBROX, leaning toward the
TV, watching with a very satisfied grin...
FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
Three to one...two to one...
Annoyed, he turns. There's a woman with red hair
(TRILLIAN), her back to him, reading numbers off a
console display and speaking into a microphone.
TRILLIAN
(into microphone)
Probability factor of one to one...we have
normality, I repeat we have normality.
Anything you still can't cope with is
therefore your own problem. Please relax.
You will be sent for soon.
ZAPHOD
Hey.
Do you mind?
I can't hear.
TRILLIAN turns -- and we now recognize her as Tricia from
the fancy dress party. Her hair is shorter and bright
red. She looks amazing.
TRILLIAN
Can we put your ego aside for one moment?
Something important has happened.
ZAPHOD
If there's anything more important than my
ego on this ship, I want it caught and
shot now.
He turns back to the TV and turns it up.
REPORTER (OK TV)
...the question everyone seems to be
asking is, has the Big Z finally flipped?
We asked his private brain care
Specialist, Gag Halfrunt...
GAG HALFRRUNT
Vell, Zaphod's just zis guy, you know --

The TV suddenly clicks off.
Zaphod spins.
Trillian's
holding a remote.
ZAPHOD
Hey...
TRILLIAN
We have a couple of hitchhikers in our
receiving bay.
His head jerks upwards. He quickly grabs it with his
hands and shoves it back down.
TRILLIAN (CONT'D)
I didn't pick them up. The ship did.
ZAPHOD
Huh?
TRILLIAN
When you engaged the Improbability Drive.
ZAPHOD
I didn't engage the drive.
TRILLIAN
We picked them up in sector ZZ9 Plural Z
Alpha -- where you picked me up.
ZAPHOD
That's impossible.
TRILLIAN
No.
Just very, very improbable.
ZAPHOD
I don't have time for this! We've got the
police of half the Galaxy after us and we
stop to pick up hitchhikers?! Okay, so
ten out of ten for style, but minus
several million for good thinking, eh?
He reaches for a hi-tech gun on the wall.
She stops him.
TRILLIAN
Don't. I'll send Marvin. (calling)
Marvin!
Zaphod rolls his eyes as a humanoid robot rises from its
seat behind them. This is MARVIN. He trudges slump-
shouldered toward Zaphod.
MARVIN
I think you ought to know I'm feeling very
depressed.
TRILLIAN
We have something to take your mind off
things.

TRILLIAN
I know. Go down to the number two entry
bay and bring the two aliens up here.
MARVIN
Just that?
TRILLIAN
Yes.
MARVIN
I won't enjoy it.
ZAPHOD
She's not asking you to enjoy it. Just do
it will you?
MARVIN
All right. I'll do it.
Marvin turns and trudges away. Then he turns again.
MARVIN (CONT'D)
I'm not getting you down at all am I?
TRILLIAN
No, no, Marvin, it's fine really. It's just
part of life.
MARVIN
Life.
Don't talk to me about life.
Marvin trudges away. A door slides open for him and
makes an audible, satisfied SIGH as it does.
DOOR
Mmmmmyaaahhhhhh!

A light blinks on a console. A VOGON CAPTAIN turns a
dial, listens through his head set. He punches a few
buttons. COMMANDER KWALTZ (green and walrusy like Jeltz)
appears on the large monitor, sitting in his chair at
Command Headquarters.
VOGON CAPTAIN
Commander Kwaltz. We've located the
spaceship Heart of Gold and President

Kwaltz sits at the end of a concrete war room table.
KWALTZ
Get me the vice-president.
Approximately 15 Vogons sit around the table murmuring
sporadically. A VOGON MESSENGER runs up, holding papers.
Kwaltz takes them, signs, signs the next page -- and the
next. He hands them back to the messengers (who has been
jogging in place the whole time). He runs off. The
VOGON CAPTAIN appears on the large screen before him.
KWALTZ (CONT'D)
Hyperspace permission granted, Captain.

Arthur looks around and notices the room is gleaming
white, hi-tech, brand new, plastic still on some stuff.
ARTHUR
Now this is more like my idea of a
spaceship. Look at all these buttons...
FORD
Shhh.
They listen.
Hear footsteps.
FORD (CONT'D)

He pushes a button. The door slides open with a satisfied
sigh -- "Hhhmmyaaaahhh". As they walk through...

'cause I don't.
Marvin turns and walks away. They shrug to each other and
follow. Marvin passes through another door that opens with
the same sigh -- "Hhmmaaaahhh"
DOOR
What a pleasure it is to open for you.
I will gladly close for you now.
The door closes.
MARVIN
"All the doors in this spacecraft have a
cheerful and sunny disposition. It is
their pleasure to open for you, and their
satisfaction to close again with the
knowledge of a job well done.
The door repeats its whole closing and opening routine
again.
MARVIN (CONT'D)
Hateful, isn't it? You can thank the
Marketing Division of the Sirius
Cybernetics Corporation for building
robots with GPP.
ARTHUR
GPP?
MARVIN
"Genuine People Personalities." I'm a
personality prototype. You can tell can't
you?
ARTHUR
Er. . .
MARVIN
Sorry, did I say something wrong? Pardon
me for breathing, which I never do anyway,

Probably because he's so negative.

HANGING ON THE WALL is the official presidential portrait,

politicians smile. Tilt down to the door which opens -
"Mmyyahhh!" - to reveal Ford, Arthur and Marvin.
MARVIN
I've brought the aliens.
Don't thank me
or anything.
Zaphod spins around in his chair, holding a gun but
sporting that same politically correct smile.
ZAPHOD
Freeze!
Arthur and Ford throw their hands up.
Marvin doesn't.
MARVIN
Do you mean sit in a corner and rust or
just fall apart where I'm standing?
ZAPHOD
I wasn't talking to you.
FORD
Zaphod?
ZAPHOD
Ixxie?
It is you!

Zaphod gives Ford a big bear hug. He pulls away, then
playfully punches Ford in the arm.

I still can't believe this. Ixxie!
Here!
ON MY SHIP!
FORD
Hey, it's Ford now.
ZAPHOD
Hmm?
FORD
My name. It's Ford Prefect. Picked it up
on Earth. Sorta grew on me.
ZAPHOD
Okay "Ford" -- you zarking frood.
They embrace, tussle, punch arms. They bump into Arthur.
FORD
Oh, this is Arthur. Arthur, this is
Zaphod Beeblebrox. My cousin? Semi-half
brother?
ZAPHOD
He shares three of the same mothers as me.
ARTHUR
We've met.
ZAPHOD
Have we? Sorry. I've got a terrible
memory for species.
Before Arthur can explain, Trillian enters.
TRILLIAN
Everything okay?
ZAPHOD
Hey, hon. Come here. You won't believe

Arthur is stunned silent. He goes to her, making sure she's
really there. He's speechless. She smiles and gives him a
friendly embrace.
ARTHUR
(completely bewildered)
I can't believe this...I've been
looking...and you're here? I went to get
wine and...
TRILLIAN
I know. And it was rude to just leave,
but I told you I wanted to get away, and
he had a spaceship parked outside, well,
honestly -- I assumed you were a sort of
stay-at-home-and-read-a book type.
(hopeful)
But you're here...
Arthur smiles, then realizes with some regret...
ARTHUR
Actually -- I am that type. But...well
you do know what happened, don't you?
Zaphod stops in between them, puts his arm around Arthur.
ZAPHOD
--Ford picked him up, they hitched a ride,
and here we all are. Now, enough small
talk, Trill. We're on the run, remember?
I stole a ship?
ARTHUR
We're having a bit of a chat if you don't
mind.
Arthur SHOVES Zaphod's hand off his shoulder. Oddly,
Zaphod reacts with a smile. And then -- his head shoots
all the up way revealing a second head that lives
somewhere under his chin.
ZAPHOD HEAD 2
You blew it with her, Earthman, so shut up
or I'll kick you in the gones!
FORD
There's the Zaphod I remember.
Arthur recoils in horror, instinctively raises his fists.
Zaphod wrestles with Head 2 while A THIRD ARM springs out
of Zaphod's chest and PUNCHES ARTHUR in the jaw. Arthur
buckles and hits the floor.
ZAPHOD HEAD 2
You should teach your pal a lesson, Ford.
He's a guest on my ship.

Trillian hurries to Arthur who nurses his jaw.
TRILLIAN
Are you all right?
ARTHUR
I feel like a bloody idiot. I've spent
all week looking for Tricia McMillan and
that isn't even your name.
TRILLIAN
It is my name. I shortened it.
ZAPHOD (0.S.)
Trillian...!
ARTHUR
Well, I'm still Arthur. Just plain
average one-headed doesn't-own-a-space
ship Arthur. Sorry to disappoint.
ZAPHOD (O.S.)
A little help over here?
Trillian leaves Arthur, joins Zaphod
ZAPHOD HEAD 2
They're after us! Fire a gun! Launch a
missile! DO SOME DAMAGE!
Zaphod's arms struggle with his head again.

They're sending a message. I'd be super
happy to play it.
ZAPHOD HEAD 2
Fine! Play it!!

This people personality thing is gonna
drive me nuts! Can't you change it?
An IMAGE APPEARS on the ship's monitor - Vice President,
QUESTULAR RONTOK, flanked by Vogon Commander KWALTZ {at
H.Q.). He looks reluctant. He has to say this...
QUESTULAR (ON MONITOR)
This is Vice President Questular Rontok.
I am speaking to the kidnapper of the
President. Surrender your stolen vessel at
once or we will take action as defined and
permitted by Section 1.8 of the Galactic
Interstellar Space Bi-Laws.
ZAPHOD HEAD 2
Leap to hyperspace!
EDDIE
Sure thing, fella, but I should tell you
we need proper authorization before
entering a hyperspace expressway.
ZAPHOD HEAD 2
Or else what? They'll send a hundred and
one ships? DO it!
He and Trillian buckle up. Ford turns to Arthur.
FORD
Brace yourself.
This is a bit like being
drunk.

What's so bad about being drunk?

Blatant disregard for protocol.
QUESTULAR
You do realize he did what he did because
he knew this is what you would do.
KWALTZ
Rules are rules, Mr. Vice President.
And
they are made to be followed.
Questular looks up to the screen at all the Vogon ships.
QUESTULAR
Don't you think this many ships is a bit,
oh I don't know -- excessive?
KWALTZ
The provisions are clear. Under
subsection 37a these are the forces we
deploy to protect the president in the
case of an attempted or actual kidnapping-
He holds up one fat official book with one hand.
KWALTZ (CONT'D)
-- and these are the forces we deploy to
apprehend any intentional or actual
kidnapper.
He holds up another fat book with the other.
QUESTULAR
You are aware, Commander, that the
President kidnapped himself.
KWALTZ
Hence...
He puts the two books together, slams them down.
QUESTULAR
Do you have any idea how ridiculous this
is?
KWALTZ
I don't have ideas Mr. Vice President.
I
just do what I do.
A VOGON MESSENGER runs up holding papers. Kwaltz takes

So -- you along for the ride or am I
dropping you somewhere?
FORD

Depends. Where you going?
ZAPHOD
Into the pages of history, cousin.
And when you see what I'm about to show

TRILLIAN

ARTHUR
Normally I would say "I'll live," but
given the circumstances...

Is there any tea on this spaceship?

ZAPHOD HEAD 2
I'll pull your spleen out through your

Zaphod slams Head 2 back into place..then smiles again.
Arthur furrows his brow and Zaphod and follows Trillian.
FORD
Two heads. Interesting choice.
ZAPHOD
Apparently you can't be President with a
whole brain.
FORD
So you carved it up?
ZAPHOD
Yes -- I think. And I think I did it in
such a way that it wouldn't be detected by
the Government screening tests -- or by
me. So, what's so secret that I can't let
anybody know I know it, not the Galactic
Government, not even myself? And the
answer is--

few things together and that's when I

Vogon crew quickly enter data. A FLIGHT ENGINEER gets

VOGON CAPTAIN
Sir, the Heart of Gold has just requested
permission to land on Viltvodle 6. Should
I pursue?
KWALTZ (ON MONITOR)
That is not a request to which I can
respond, captain. Should I pursue what?
Are you requesting hyperspace clearance so
that you may pursue the fugitive?
VOGON CAPTAIN
Yes, commander.
KWALTZ (ON MONITOR)
Then you must say that, captain -- in
request form.
VOGON CAPTAIN

Zaphod opens the huge doors inside the large

A congregation of worshipers faces front where HUMMA KAVULA
stands behind a podium. He's a humanoid wearing a white
robe and night-vision sun glasses.
HUMMA KAVULA
The handkerchief is coming, beloveds. Are
you ready? Let us pray that the almighty
will exhale a breath of compassion on us.
Instead of bowing, they all point their noses heavenward.
Zaphod marches down the center aisle while Humma prays.
HUMMA KAVULA (CONT'D)

ARTHUR
What was it?
Ford shrugs.
HUMMA looks up, sees Zaphod, smiles.
HUMMA KAVULA

Send the handkerchief, lord, so that it may

Zaphod Beeblebrox, our famous President.
The Arkleseizure has exhaled many

Interesting. And I don't know what you're
talking about.
ZAPHOD HEAD 2
During the campaign, Humma -- you said I
was stupid.
HUMMA KAVULA
This Humma you speak of no longer exists.
He came here in his consolation position
as Ambassador to Gamma Z10 to squelch an
ideological threat to the system and
repented from his wicked ways. He now
goes by the holy name Tazelo the
Unceasingly Righteous, given to him by his
devoted followers.
ZAPHOD HEAD 2
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU CALL YOURSELF, YOU
RIGHTEOUS FREAK!! YOU STARTED THE RUMOR
THAT I'M STUPID AND YOU'RE GONNA PAY!!!
The 3rd arm reaches for a gun in Zaphod's vest. The BODY
GUARDS aim their weapons. One runs up and smacks Zaphod
in the back of the head -- slamming Head 2 back in place.
ZAPHOD
Thank you.
The 3rd arm disappears.
The gun falls.
A BODY GUARD
picks it up.
WITH ARTHUR, FORD AND TRILLIAN
ARTHUR
Why do I get the feeling he's going to get
us all killed?
FORD
Probably because it's very possible.
Just
don't save me, okay? We're even.
Humma lays his palms on the table and lifts himself as if
to stand - but there is nothing of him below the table
line except for thirty, one inch metal legs, attached to
the base of his torso. He glides towards Zaphod, the
little legs extending to reach the floor as he reaches

A guard drapes a white robes over Humma's shoulders - which
he ties with a belt - hiding his peculiar undercarriage.
HUMMA KAVULA (CONT'D)
And incidently -- you are stupid.
His head jerks up.
Zaphod stops it, paints on a smile.
ZAPHOD
That's really not the point.
HUMMA KAVULA
You haven't come halfway across the galaxy
to settle a campaign grudge. Why are you
here, Zaphod?
Zaphod doesn't answer. Humma motions to a guard who
grabs his arm, twists it -- hard.
ZAPHOD
(wincing)
I don't know. I was headed for Magrathea,
I ended up here.
PUSH IN ON HUMMA -- who raises his hi-tech sun glasses.
HUMMA KAVULA
How very, very...

He pulls the nose off his body guard, turns a key.
A
secret safe door slides open from the mans' chest.
HUMMA KAVULA (CONT'D)
I kept a few souvenirs from my former
life. Ah, the heady days of space
piracy... so young, so foolish..,
Another, smaller box rises from the chest cabinet. Inside
we see glowing jewels, a skeleton hand, etc. Humma
removes a PINK CUBE (like Zaphod's blue cube.)
HUMMA KAVULA (CONT'D)
I'll gladly give you the coordinates to
Magrathea...
He holds up the pink cube revealing A SERIES OF

Arthur sees the Vogon ships getting away. Desperate, he
shoves_Zaphod out of_the_driver's seat. Zaphod hits the

sleep instead -- with a contented smile.
Arthur sits. He looks very out of place in a seat

Stars appear on the screen as they slow from hyperspace.
EDDIE
Guys, I'm just super happy to tell you
we're approaching hyperspace exit Gamma
Z8B530.
Arthur steadies himself, turns to Trillian who's still
staring forward, angry. She unbuckles her seat-belt and
moves away from the console.
A planet appears on screen.
Zaphod and Ford lean
forward.
ZAPHOD
Okay, that's it...I think. Computer?
Is

FORD
Magrathea?

Hang on, fella, and I'll check.

Arthur turns, look over at...
TRILLIAN -- who stares out a portal window into the
emptiness of space. A tear rolls down her cheek.
Arthur steps up, isn't sure what to say.
ARTHUR
Look, you're right. You deserved to know
and I should've told you. I don't blame
you if you're angry.
She turns and stares, wipes the tears away.
Can't speak.
ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Right.
Anyway...I'm sorry.
EDDIE (O.S.)
Guys, it just tickles me pink to tell you
we are currently in orbit at an altitude
of three hundred miles around the
legendary planet of Magrathea. Goll-ee.
Hearing this news, Arthur, Trillian and Ford turn.
ZAPHOD

Take us in.

The crew are thrown from one side of the pod to the other.
EDDIE
There seems to be something jamming my
guidance systems. Impact minus 45

Zaphod tries to wrestle with three controls.
ZAPHOD
I can't do this without my other arm!

ZAPHOD
Did we lose them?
FORD
No.
They're right behind us.
He looks down, sees the IMPROBABILITY DRIVE BUTTON.
ARTHUR
Look, why don't I just hit this thing?
ZAPHOD
NO! We're here! No telling where it will
send us!
(84 cont) IN THE SKY--

The missiles turn and accelerate high into the sky. A
second set of boosters kick in on the missiles as they
soar back toward the H.O.G. --- much, much faster.
(85 cont) ON THE BRIDGE--
(85 cont)
They all stare at the approaching missiles. Arthur looks
at the drive button. Screw it. He flips open the glass
lid.
ZAPHOD
NO!
Too late. ARTHUR HITS THE BUTTON.
WOOMF! Light blasts through the bridge. Morphing
madness!

It coalesces back into shape out of chaos. The safety
dome rises revealing our heroes standing in the exact
same place they were - dazed.
ZAPHOD
Um...where are we?
TRILLIAN
Exactly where we were, I think.
ZAPHOD
And the missiles?
FORD
Have apparently turned into a bowl of
petunias and a very surprised looking
whale.
He points to the screen. The whale and petunias float by.
EDDIE
At an improbability factor of eight
million, seven hundred and sixty-seven
thousand, one hundred and twenty-eight to
one against.
They all look to Arthur who shrugs. Zaphod nods his
approval. Ford counts on his fingers -- are they even?
He waves it off, gives Arthur a little salute and moves
on. Trillian looks to Arthur and musters a smile.
ARTHUR
I could really use a cup of tea.

SLARTIBARTFAST
I told you you might find it a bit

ARTHUR
I have found this whole day a bit
disturbing.
Arthur realizes he has his towel with him. He wipes his
mouth with it, dabs his brow. Then he notices...
...THE ROOM -- which is like a car dealer's showroom only
instead of cars there are models of various planets.
SLARTIBARTFAST
Did you know we built planets?
No.
Arthur didn't know that.
He looks perplexed.
SLARTIBARTFAST (CONT'D)
Fascinating trade. Doing the coastlines
was always my favorite. Used to have
endless fun doing all the little fiddly
bits round fjords. But the Galactic
economy collapsed, and seeing that custom-
built planets are something of a luxury
commodity...
(getting back on subject)
At any rate, there's been a terrible mix
up with your planet. You must come with me
or it's all going to blow up in our faces.

Slarti motions him to a door.

Arthur readies his towel at his mouth as Slarti hits a

button. The door slides open and nothing happens. It's
just a door that leads to a room where several TRANSPORT
CARTS move past -- like a kids ride at Disneyland. They
step into one. Slarti closes the little door. The cart
MOVES through a curtain, out into DEEP SPACE.
PULL BACK - till the cart is no more than a speck being
pushed forward by the longest telescoping arm in history.

Ford, Zaphod and Trillian enter the dimly lit temple.
They hear a faint, tinny sound. They follow it.
FURTHER DOWN THE CORRIDOR...
The sound gets louder. Tinny music. And laughter...
Flickering light illuminates the end of the corridor.
ZAPHOD
This is it!
He quickens his pace. Trillian and Ford follow.
They
round the corner to find...
DEEP THOUGHT -- sitting there majestically.
The TINNY
MUSIC emanates from somewhere near him.
Zaphod takes another step in and now sees the source of
the TINNY MUSIC.
Deep Thought is watching TV.
A violent, stupid cartoon.
ZAPHOD (CONT'D)

I've been watching TV.

Zaphod holds a smile but his world is slowly crumbling.

I designed another computer to perform

Oh, right...I forgot.

Not here. Another world.
ZAPHOD

It is another world. Or was.
ZAPHOD

Zaphod turns to Ford.
Ford looks confused.

Not him.
Zaphod looks to Trillian. She looks equally confused.
Zaphod puts the thinking cap back on. Strains hard.

A robotic arm reaches out and turns up the volume.
Zaphod stands, turns to Ford and Trillian, smiles that
smile -- but it's starting to look a bit crazed.
ZAPHOD
Great. This is just great. Let's go find
something else for my entire life to be
about.
He starts to march off.
Ford grabs his arm.
FORD
Zaphod. The gun? The one Humma sent us
for? We have to get it. You gave the guy
your head.
ZAPHOD
I know.
Why did I do that?
He pulls his thinking cap down -- all the way over his
eyes. Ford rolls his eyes, turns...
FORD
Um...Deep Thought? We we're told you have
a g...
Before he finishes the sentence, a PANEL in the wall
slides open revealing a LARGE, SCARY LOOKING GUN. A
robotic arm pushes it forward.
Ford goes over, takes it, carries it like it's
nitroglycerin to Zaphod who's already walking away,
CORRIDOR LEADING AWAY FROM DEEP THOUGHT
Ford hands Zaphod the gun.
FORD (CONT'D)
Here.
Take it. I don't do guns.
Zaphod takes it with a smile...
ZAPHOD
Thank you.
...and instantly points it at his head. Ford lunges for
it. There's a struggle. Ford's trying to get Zaphod's
finger off the trigger when CLICK! The trigger is
pulled. Ford winces. But apparently, nothing has

fame and money, and you deserve that, man.
Because you're great -- you're just

Zaphod isn't sure what just happened. But he smiles
anyway. Trillian, however, is onto something.
TRILLIAN

The transport cart moves past two half-finished planets
and on toward a 3rd planet. Construction gantries and
clouds obscure our view.
SLARTIBARTFAST
The galaxy was a bit of a shambles, you
see. Everyone enjoying themselves being
singers and comedians and really creative
and interesting things like that. No one
doing the boring jobs.
ARTHUR
Oh, you had that problem, too?
SLARTIBARTFAST
In spades. So a species was genetically
engineered to do the boring jobs. Tax
inspectors, traffic wardens, government
officials. We were commissioned to build
a special planet for them.
Problem was, some cleverdick made it so
any time one of the creatures had an
interesting idea it would get a hefty
smack around the face.
ARTHUR
What? You did that? I've been there!
The cart lowers down toward the surface of the planet.
SLARTIBARTFAST
Then I gather you've met some of the

She shoots him again.
ZAPHOD (CONT'D)
You actually wanted to know the Question
because you always thought there was more

She's getting angrier and more hurt.

You've got no home, no family, no one to

appreciating himself.
Hearing this puts a lump in her throat, causes her eyes
to well with tears. She lowers the gun.
Zaphod shakes his head -- the effect wearing off.
But he
realizes what he said and doesn't like it.
ZAPHOD (CONT'D)
Give me that thing.
He grabs the gun, points it at her.
TRILLIAN
Won't affect me.

Arthur has spotted a TEA POT on the table. He hurries to
it, feels it. Warm. He pours a cup, takes a sip,
Closes his eyes, enjoying it.
ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Now that's a cup of tea.
FRANKY MOUSE (O.S.)
We're glad you like it, Earth creature.
He looks down and sees THE TWO WHITE MICE sitting on a
silver platter.
BENJY MOUSE
After ten million years on Earth, and a
rather large chunk of that time in
England, it would be utterly humiliating
if we didn't know how to make a decent pot
of tea.
Arthur stares in shock...can't speak.
TRILLIAN
Arthur, these are our hosts. Benjy mouse
and Franky mouse (chew, chew).
They control a large sector of the
Universe in our dimension (chew, chew).
I'm sorry, I thought you were told about
the mice...

Yes. Yes, I was. I just wasn't quite

That will be all, Slartibartfast.
Slarti, slightly hurt, backs away out of sight.
ARTHUR
I'm sorry, when you say "the only living
native" -- do you mean me? What about
her?
Benjy holds up a strand of hairs, same color as Trillian's.
BENJY MOUSE
We performed some rudimentary DNA tests on
the ship. She's half-native. Her real
father was a Blahardid, the hyper-
intelligent yet carelessly nomadic race
native to the planet Olbed, who apparently
popped in to Earth for a one-nighter with
a one Ms. Francis McMillan.
TRILLIAN
(looking up, mouth full)
Which explains a lot.
She goes back to eating.
Arthur is taking this all in.

An Ultimate Question that sounds good...

And as it turns out, the chances are

the question is encoded in your brain.
Which is why we need it. More tea?
Franky tries to pour more tea. Arthur stops drinking, a

I'm sorry -- did you just say you need my
brain?

Yes.

You can't have my brain. I'm using it.

We can replace it if you think it's

Arthur, still attached to the chair, backs away.
Scythes and rotating arms with circular saw blades shoot

The scythes and arms stop spinning. Arthur stumbles

to screw in a lightbulb?" Or here's one,
"How many roads must a man walk down?"

Hey, that's not bad.
Through the opposite window (in much the same way
bulldozers arrived in the opening) we see more Vogons
arriving.

Fine. Take it. There's plenty more where
that came from because my head is filled,
with questions, and I can assure you mate,

Questular runs towards a lake/blow hole, takes off his
clothes and jumps in.
ZAPHOD
Marvin.
You saved our lives.
MARVIN

Wretched, isn't it?
QUESTULAR
(distant) Oh man! I love being me!!
They share a laugh.

SLARTIBARTFAST
I've just been informed by some of the
lads that since we're so near completion,
we're going to go ahead and finish Earth.
We can put it back exactly the way it was
when you left, you know -- unless there's
anything you'd like to change. Something
you think your planet could do without?
Arthur thinks about it...looks around...slowly nods...
ARTHUR
Yes.
Me.
He looks to Trillian who raises an eyebrow.
Really?
She smiles.
TRILLIAN
Let's go somewhere.
ARTHUR
Yes, You name it. I'll go.
ZAPHOD
I'm going to Humma's. He has my head...I
think. Doesn't he? I'm so confused.
FORD
And I'm hungry. After we get your head
let's grab a bite. I know this great
restaurant at the end of the universe.
As they walk away, we CUT TO...

SLARTI'S FACTORY ELEVATOR -- where they all board.

SLARTIBARTFAST
Okay. Hold tight.
Everyone grabs the rail, except for Trillian who holds on
to Arthur. SSSSSSHHHHHHHHHVUMP! Up into the sky they go.
VOICE (O.S.)
Stand-by for commencement of life cycle.
All systems checked and cleared.
Commencing.
We hear KL-KLUNK. BZZZZZZZ... and watch nature burst
into life - animals run - flowers bloom - waterfalls
cascade - mountains rise in the mist - monkeys bathe in
hot springs etc. Set to a wonderful, uplifting piece of
music ("WHAT A WONDERFUL WORLD?").
Tilt up to the sky. The day turns to night. Stars appear.
The Heart of Gold streaks through the stars.
