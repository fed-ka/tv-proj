      Open tight on a light blue DOME, fragile and perfect.

      All is still, until this dome s exterior CRACKS.  Something 
      inside is starting to break free.  At first, the emerging 
      creature looks like a MONSTER -- a writhing lump of flesh 
      with gummed-shut eyes and a screaming yellow maw.

      But as we pull back, it becomes clear that our dome is 
      actually an EGG, and that the creature inside is a baby 
      EASTERN BLUEBIRD, one that will presumably grow up to look 
      much like the gorgeous MOTHER BIRD we can now see watching 
      over this nest.

      With her newborn chick already demanding food, the mother 
      bird launches into the air, flying past a faded green metal 
      sign by the side of the road:

                                        CHESTER S MILL
                                          Pop. 1,976

      As the bird cuts across Chester s Mill, so do we, following 
      as she gives us a pre-dawn tour of what seems to be a typical 
      small town in contemporary America... in that it s just 
      barely scraping by.  Some of the bucolic houses are marred by 
      FORECLOSED signs, but most are still occupied by the same 
      families that have carved out lives here for generations.

      Flying past the steeple of HOLY REDEEMER CHURCH, the bluebird 
      swoops through the town s central thoroughfare, where a mix 
      of chain stores and local mainstays like the SWEETBRIAR ROSE 
      DINER and BOWIE S DRUGS have weathered the economic downturn 
      with varying degrees of success.  

      Flapping hard now, mama bird presses deeper into the dark 
      heart of Chester s Mill, the Black Ridge Woods.



      Entering this vast forest in search of crickets, the bird 
      stops at a tree overlooking a clearing, where she notices a 
      COMPACT CAR parked next to a fresh HOLE in the ground.  
      SHUNK.  A clump of dirt flies out of this pit, startling mama 
      bird, who disappears into the night.  

      And that s when a HAND appears at the lip of this freshly dug 
      grave.

      A SHIRTLESS MAN drenched in sweat pulls himself out of the 
      earth.  DOG TAGS glisten around his neck.  As we ll later 
      learn, this 30-something Army veteran is DALE  BARBIE  
      BARBARA.             UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   2.


      Barbie s face is bruised and cut.  It looks like he s just 
      survived the worst night of his life. 

      Exhausted, Barbie ambles over to his car and opens its small 
      trunk.  Inside is the CORPSE OF AN ADULT MALE, hurriedly 
      wrapped in bloodstained bedsheets and duct tape.  We can t 
      see the deceased s face just yet, but as Barbie lifts the 
      body, he notes that it s wearing only one shoe, a distinctive 
      BLUE SNEAKER.  

      Shit.  Frustrated, Barbie looks for the shoe s missing 
      partner, but it s not in the trunk.  Oh, well.  Clock s 
      ticking.  Carrying the corpse to its final resting spot, 
      Barbie unceremoniously DUMPS the body.

      As it hits the earth, the corpse s sheet becomes undone, 
      revealing the face of the deceased, a 40-something WHITE 
      MALE.  The body s lifeless eyes stare up at Barbie, who takes 
      this opportunity to say a few words:

                                  BARBIE
                    You had it coming.

      With that, Barbie picks up his shovel, and gets to work 
      refilling the hole.



      Sunrise is still an hour away as we cut to Chester Mill s 
        small-but-modern police department.



      Across town, a lone customer is eating an early breakfast in 
      a local 24-hour diner. 



      Elsewhere, a PRIUS speeds towards an old house on top of a 
      small hill.  A local woman named ANDREA GRINELL is waiting on 
      her porch, expecting the incoming vehicle.

      The Prius comes to a stop, and out hops JULIA SHUMWAY (40), 
      an effortlessly attractive woman with a confident gait and an 
      expensive digital camera slung over her shoulder.

                                  JULIA
                    Andrea Grinell?

      The older woman nods.

                                  JULIA (CONT D)
                    Julia Shumway.  I got your message.  
                    You said you needed to speak with 
                    me?

                                  MRS. GRINELL
                    You re the newspaper woman?

                                  JULIA
                    I m the new editor of The 
                      Independent, yeah.  But if there s 
                    a problem with your delivery, you 
                    can just call--

                                  MRS. GRINELL
                    I get my news online, sweetheart.  
                    Like everybody else.  I called you 
                    because I ve got a tip.

      Julia looks more confused than intrigued.

                                  JULIA
                    About what?

                                  MRS. GRINELL
                    That.

      Mrs. Grinell gestures down at a nearby WAREHOUSE visible from 
      her hilltop vantage point.  Julia s not impressed.  

                                  JULIA
                      A nondescript building.  This is my 
                    Pulitzer for sure.

      Grinell glares at the younger woman.

                                  MRS. GRINELL
                    You re in from Philly or something?           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   6.


                                  JULIA
                    Chicago.  I used to work at the 
                    Trib.  My husband got a job at your 
                    med center, so I relocated with 
                    him.  Been looking for a change a 
                    pace anyway, you know?

                                  MRS. GRINELL
                    Well, you re about to get one.

      Suddenly, a large PROPANE TRUCK approaches the warehouse.

                                  MRS. GRINELL (CONT D)
                    See that truck down there?  That s 
                    the fourth delivery it s made to 
                    that building this week.  Last 
                    week, it made six.

      What?  Suddenly intrigued, Julia raises her camera.

                                  JULIA
                    Why does anybody need that much 
                    propane?  

                                  MRS. GRINELL
                    That was my question.  Either 
                      somebody s planning a hell of a 
                    barbecue or...

      Mrs. Grinell pantomimes a little EXPLOSION.  Julia is 
      horrified.

                                  JULIA
                    Jesus.  You think this might be 
                    related to terrorism?  
                          (then)
                    Mrs. Grinell, we have to tell the 
                    police.

                                  MRS. GRINELL
                    Already did.

      Confused, Julia squints at this woman.

                                  MRS. GRINELL (CONT D)
                    I called Sheriff Perkins three days 
                    ago.  He looked into it... and 
                    turns out everything s above board.  
                    Town Hall is just restocking its 
                       emergency reserves. 

      Julia lowers her camera.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   7.


                                  JULIA
                    I don t understand.

                                  MRS. GRINELL
                    Me neither.  Because here s the 
                    thing.  When he told me all this, 
                    Duke sounded nervous.  
                          (then)
                    I don t know how well you know that 
                    man, but believe me, he s never 
                    sounded nervous a day in his life.

      Not totally convinced, Julia snaps one more photo, mostly out 
      of politeness.  

                                  JULIA
                    Well.  I ll do some digging.

      Mrs. Grinell stands to walk back into her home.

                                  MRS. GRINELL
                    You do that.  But whatever you 
                    find... you leave my name the hell 
                    out of it.    

      And as Andrea Grinell steps back inside, Julia returns her 
      gaze to the warehouse in the distance.  She remains 
      skeptical, but her curiosity s definitely been piqued.      



      As dawn begins to break, Barbie finishes scattering leaves 
      and branches over his makeshift grave, doing a pretty decent 
      job of covering his tracks.    

      He stuffs the shovel next to the only other object in his 
      small trunk, a military-style DUFFEL BAG.  Grabbing a fresh 
      shirt from his car s back seat, Barbie puts on sunglasses to 
      try to cover the CUT above his eye.

      Jumping behind the wheel of his shitty car, he inches out of 
      the forest and down an empty dirt road, eventually GUNNING IT 
      out onto one of the Mill s main thoroughfares.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   10.



      The lazy cows barely attempt to get out of the way as 
      Barbie s car narrowly misses them.  Finally, the vehicle 
      comes to a stop, one of its front tires blown to hell.  

      Jumping out of the vehicle to inspect the damage, Barbie then 
      rushes to his compact car s small trunk, only to realize that 
      he REMOVED the spare tire to make room for the body, shovel, 
      duffel bag, etc.  

                                  BARBIE
                          (darkly)
                    Perfect.   

      And just when Barbie is sure things couldn t get worse, the 
      ground begins to TREMBLE.


      CHESTER S MILL - VARIOUS LOCATIONS - CONTINUOUS

      CUT AROUND TOWN as the locals experience this surreal jolt:

      *Now in her newspaper s modest bullpen, Julia notices her 
      coffee cup begin to RATTLE.
 
      *Sitting at a desk adorned with a bust of his hero Winston 
      Churchill, Big Jim is plunged into blackness when the LIGHTS 
      GO OUT inside his car lot offices.             UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   13.


      *Though they re now walking on opposite sides of town, Angie 
      and Junior both feel the earth MOVE under their feet.

      *Finally, Duke GRABS HIS CHEST, slamming on the brakes of his 
      police car as he winces in extreme pain.  



      Back at his car, Barbie is still reeling from this shaking 
      when he hears a TERRIBLE NOISE coming from the pasture.

      He turns to see a COW just as its body is SPLIT IN HALF 
      LENGTHWISE.  The half closest to Barbie slumps to the grass, 
      but the other somehow REMAINS UPRIGHT, giving us a Damien 
      Hirst-style cutaway view of the animal s still-pumping 
      innards.  

                                  BARBIE
                    ...the fuck?



      Running to inspect the bisected cow, Barbie kneels down in a 
      puddle of the beast s blood.  He reaches out to touch the 
      spot where... something split this animal in two, and Barbie 
      is SHOCKED -- figuratively and literally -- when he connects 
      with an INVISIBLE BARRIER.  

      He yanks his palm back, but his bloodstained HANDPRINT is 
      still there, glistening in midair, like a warning.  



      Back at the halved cow, Barbie is still struggling to wrap 
      his brain around what just happened, when someone calls out:

                                    ANOTHER VOICE (O.S.)
                    What the hell, man?

      Barbie spins around to see JOE McCLATCHEY, a lanky teenager 
      who s looking down at the cow with horror.  

                                  JOE
                    What the hell did you do?

      Giving this groggy kid the once-over, Barbie notes the 
      crudely hand-rolled JOINT in Joe s hand.

                                  BARBIE
                    These your animals?           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   16.


                                  JOE
                          (shaking his head)
                    I live up the road.  I just come 
                    out here to... think.

                                  BARBIE
                    Careful.  Don t touch the--

      But a stoned Joe has already pushed past Barbie to inspect 
      the bloody handprint, which still appears to be FLOATING in 
      place.  The teenager s jaw goes slack as he touches the 
      barrier for himself.

                                  JOE
                    Holy...

                                  BARBIE
                    I know.

                                  JOE
                    What is it?

                                  BARBIE
                    Some kinda... invisible fence.

                                  JOE
                    What, like, for dogs?  No, this is 
                    some Star Trek shit.  This is--

      WHUMP.  That s when something FALLS right next to Joe.  He 
       whoas  with surprise as -- whump whump whump -- MORE land by 
      his feet.  The fallen objects are black and limp. 

      Joe reaches down to pick one up.  It s a CROW, its neck 
      SNAPPED by some unexpected impact high above.

                                  JOE (CONT D)
                    Wait, what?

      That s when Barbie hears something.  It s our TWIN-ENGINE 
      PLANE, only the aircraft is now about to fly directly OVER 
      Barbie and Joe.

      Barbie looks down at the birds, then up at the rapidly 
      incoming plane.  Doing the awful arithmetic in his head, he 
      looks to Joe and says one word:

                                  BARBIE
                    RUN.

      But it s too late.  The airplane EXPLODES directly above them 
      as it CRUMPLES against the towering invisible barrier.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   17.


      Frozen in terror, Joe stares up at the incoming FLAMING 
      WRECKAGE.

      And just as a shorn wing is about to flatten the boy -- 
      Barbie TACKLES Joe, just barely knocking him out of the way.

      Debris continues to RAIN DOWN all around them.  Joe screams 
      with horror as a MAN S LEG lands inches from his face.  
      Dressed in denim, the leg s side-seam has been blown wide 
      open, revealing white flesh and wiry hair.  

                                  JOE
                          (in shock)
                    What the hell is happening?!

      But an equally shaken Barbie has no idea how to respond.



      Back in town, Jim Rennie steps out of his office and onto a 
      car lot decorated with banners declaring  BIG JIM S BIGGEST 
      DEALS OF THE YEAR!  

      He s just noticed a CROWD OF ONLOOKERS staring at something 
      in the sky.

                                  BIG JIM
                    God Almighty.

      It s the distant IMPACT POINT of the small plane, now a 
      smoldering smudge that appears suspended high in the sky.  
      Big Jim grabs one of the stunned ONLOOKERS.

                                  BIG JIM (CONT D)
                    What are we looking at?  

                                  ONLOOKER
                    No clue.  But somebody said they 
                    saw a piper cub explode in midair.

                                  BIG JIM
                      Explode...?

                                  ONLOOKER
                    Yeah, they don t know if it got 
                    shot down or what.

                                  BIG JIM
                    A plane crash?
                          (then; almost HOPEFUL)
                    Here?           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   18.


      The onlooker is still transfixed by the smudge, which is 
      slowly fading away like a spent firework.

                                  ONLOOKER
                    What is it?

      But Big Jim is already racing for his vehicle.  This is the 
      moment he s been waiting for.  Preparing for. 



      SMALL FIRES now dot the area where Barbie is still recovering 
      with Joe McClatchey.  They re standing on the outskirts of 
      the crash site, trying to process what just happened.

                                  JOE
                    Those people are dead.  I... I saw 
                    those people die.

      With a trembling hand, Barbie takes out a pack of cigarettes, 
      lights a smoke.

                                  BARBIE
                    You know where to score E?

                                  JOE
                    What?

                                  BARBIE
                    You obviously know where to get 
                    weed in this town, you know anyone 
                    with ecstasy?

      Joe reluctantly nods, wondering what the hell kind of grown-
      up this guy is.

                                  BARBIE (CONT D)
                          (knowingly)
                    Trust me, it ll help when the 
                    dreams start.

                                  JOE
                    Um, look, we need to tell somebody, 
                    right?  About this?

      Snapping back to reality, Barbie nods.  But when he flips 
      open his cell phone, he doesn t like what he sees.

                                  BARBIE
                    You getting service?

      Joe takes out his iPhone, frowns at the screen.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   19.


                                  JOE
                    Uh-uh.

      Barbie is considering what this might mean when he notices 
      another vehicle charging their way, this time from the OTHER 
      side of the barrier.  It s a FIRE TRUCK, loaded with half the 
      department, responding to the crash.  Like the pilot before 
      him, the truck s DRIVER has no clue about the invisible BRICK 
      WALL waiting in his path.  

                                  BARBIE
                    No.

      Abandoning his cigarette, Barbie runs full speed as he waves 
      his arms and screams:

                                  BARBIE (CONT D)
                    IDIOT!  SLOW DOWN!

      But the fire truck is still thundering towards the scene of 
      the crash, the driver obviously not hearing Barbie.

      Left with no other choice, Barbie races to the MIDDLE OF THE 
      ROAD, directly in the truck s path.  Joe can barely watch.  
      If it smashes through the barrier, Barbie is DEAD.

      But at the last second, the man behind the wheel SLAMS ON HIS 
      BRAKES, stopping inches short of annihilation.  Strangely, 
      Barbie can t hear wailing sirens or screeching tires.  The 
      fire truck stops with almost surreal SILENCE.  Apparently, 
      the barrier prevents even SOUND from getting inside.  

      Wondering why the hell some idiot is standing in traffic, an 
      older FIRE CHIEF climbs out of the cab and charges at Barbie.   

                                  BARBIE (CONT D)
                    Hold up!  You re gonna hit the--  

      And though Barbie tries to warn this man, the fire chief 
      STRIKES the transparent barrier face-first, knocking the 
      helmet right off his stunned face.  

      Joe rejoins Barbie, who takes a little ADDRESS BOOK from his 
      back pocket.  He rips out a page and starts scrawling a note 
      to the flummoxed fire chief.

                                  JOE
                    What are you writing?

                                  BARBIE
                    I m telling them to call the F.A.A.  
                      Somebody s got to shut down this 
                    entire airspace.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   20.


      Barbie SLAPS the note against the barrier.  The fire chief 
      reads it with bewilderment before finally reaching for his 
      own wireless radio.  A conspiracy-minded Joe looks worried:  

                                  JOE
                    The feds?  But, what if the 
                      government built this thing?

                                  BARBIE
                    They didn t.

                                  JOE
                    How do you know?

      Barbie stares at the black smoke, which is now climbing the 
      inside of the transparent impenetrable wall.

                                  BARBIE
                     Cause it works.



      The call letters  WKIC  light up as generators hum to life 
      beneath Chester Mill s only 50,000-watt radio tower.



      Back at the pasture, the same police cruiser that earlier 
      blew past Barbie now skids to a halt, as Duke and Deputy 
      Linda Everett hop out to survey the smoldering wreckage.

                                    ANOTHER VOICE (O.S.)
                    Sheriff Perkins!

      Duke turns to see Joe coming towards them with Barbie, who 
      eyes the police officers with trepidation.

                                  JOE
                            (mile-a-minute)
                    Sheriff Perkins I almost got killed 
                    by a plane but then this guy saved 
                    me and I think there s maybe a--

                                  DUKE
                    Joe, clear on out of here.  We ll 
                    get a statement from you later.

                  SCARECROW JOEDUKE
      But--Now, son.

      Joe looks back at Barbie, who gives him a little nod.   Go 
      on, I ll be fine.   The teenager complies.             UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   22.


      Linda, meanwhile, has just spotted her ruggedly handsome 
      fianc , RUSTY, who s standing with his fellow firefighters 
      just outside the barrier.

                                  LINDA
                    RUSTY! 

      She calls out to him, but the young man doesn t even look her 
      way.  He and the other firefighters are all staring up at 
      something with confused disbelief.

                                  BARBIE
                    I don t think he can hear you.

                                  LINDA
                    The hell are you talking about?
                    Why s everybody just standing 
                    around?

                                  DUKE (O.S.)
                    Jesus God.

      And now Linda turns to look at Duke, who s finally noticed 
      what the firefighters are looking up at: shimmering AIRPLANE 
      FUEL still dripping down from the sky, which makes a portion 
      of this barrier SEMI-VISIBLE.  

                                  DUKE (CONT D)
                    What...?

                                  BARBIE
                    I don t know.  
                          (then; matter of fact)
                    But it s big.  

      Reaching out to touch the transparent wall for herself, Linda 
      is startled by a strange TINGLING sensation in her fingers.

                                  LINDA
                    Whoa.

      On the other side of the barrier, Rusty has finally noticed 
      his bride-to-be.  He charges to greet her, and though he 
      feels the same initial SHOCK when his fingers hit the 
      invisible wall, Rusty nevertheless keeps his palm pressed 
      flush against Linda s.  Though separated by less than a 
      millimeter, the couple might as well be on different 
      continents now. 

                                  LINDA (CONT D)
                    Baby!  Baby, you all right?

      Rusty gives a breathless response, but Linda can only watch 
      his lips move in silence.             UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   23.


      Before we can decipher what s being said, a concerned fire 
      chief starts yelling at Rusty.  The fire chief starts to DRAG 
      his subordinate away from the potentially dangerous barrier.  
      Clocking this, Duke does this same with his deputy.

                                  DUKE
                    Linda, get away from that thing!

                                  LINDA
                    It s like... some kind of force 
                    field.

                                  DUKE
                    Yeah, I get that. I don t know what 
                    it means, but I get it.
                          (then; re: the fires)
                    The hell are the rest of our 
                    pumpers, anyway?

                                  LINDA
                    Town Hall sent  em to Castle Rock.  
                    For the parade.

                                  DUKE
                          (shaking his head)
                    Goddamn Big Jim...

      As if on cue, a familiar SUV roars into the scene.  Big Jim 
      hops out, takes in the debris field with astonishment.  

                                  BIG JIM 
                    This was Chuck Thomson s plane.  Is 
                    he...?

                                  BARBIE
                    For what it s worth, he died the 
                    second he hit it.

      Big Jim squints at this outsider.

                                  BIG JIM
                    Hit what?  

      Before anyone can respond, the radio in Duke s police car 
      SQUAWKS to life with the voice of one of the male officers.  

                                  FROM RADIO
                    Duke, you there?

                                  BIG JIM
                    You re still getting reception?

                                  DUKE
                    Only from inside the Mill.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   24.


      Duke reaches into his car, keys the handheld mic.

                                  FROM RADIO
                    Sir, we got a real bad accident on 
                    Pretty Valley.

                                  DUKE
                    It s gonna have to wait until--

                                  FROM RADIO
                    Duke, it s Freddy.  I ve got one, 
                    too, over on Motton.  A minivan 
                    versus... I don t know what, but 
                    the thing s flat as a dime. 
                          (then; somberly)
                    Whole family is D.O.A.  

      Big Jim is aghast.

                                  BIG JIM
                    Dead?  Did he say they re dead?

      Linda looks at where Rusty s fire truck was forced to stop.

                                  LINDA
                    The roads.  Whoever did this, they 
                    cut off all our roads.

      But Duke shakes his head as he notices the subtly curved LINE 
      OF DESTRUCTION stretching far beyond this crash site, downing 
      power lines and slicing trees in half.  

                                  DUKE
                    It s not just the roads, it s 
                      everything. The whole town.  

      Barbie doesn t like it, but he s pretty sure Duke is right.

                                  BARBIE
                          (simply)
                    We re trapped.

      On the other side of the barrier, Rusty breaks free from the 
      other firefighters long enough to race back the force field.  
      Shouting at his fianc e, he begins POUNDING on the invisible 
      wall in frustration.  A heartbroken Linda can only watch this 
      with growing dread.

                                  LINDA
                    But, whatever this is, the folks 
                    out there will be able to... 
                    airlift us all out or something, 
                    won t they?           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   25.


      Duke honestly doesn t know.

                                  DUKE
                    Right now, let s just worry about 
                    the folks in here.

      And off Barbie s increasingly troubled expression, CUT TO:



      Elsewhere in the Mill, a RENTAL CAR has stopped to refuel.  

      Three women get out to stretch their legs, life partners 
      ALICE CALVERT and CAROLYN HILL (40s), and their rebellious 
      teenage daughter NORRIE.  She sarcastically reads aloud from 
        a guidebook.

                     The town of Chester s Mill is 
                    legendary for its fried clams, 
                    always whole, never in strips. 
                          (then)
                    Horrific.  Seriously, can we please 
                    stop somewhere else?  There s no 
                    way I m eating my last meal here.

      Her mother Carolyn doesn t even look up from her Blackberry, 
      which she s frantically thumbing.

                                    CAROLYN
                    We re taking you to camp, not your 
                      execution. 
                          (then; to her Blackberry)
                    How the hell am I still getting no 
                    bars?

                                  NORRIE
                    Waterside isn t a  camp,  it s a 
                    glorified prison for screw-ups with 
                    rich parents.  

                                  ALICE
                    It s a wonderful program, Norrie.  
                    And as soon as they say you re 
                    ready, you can come right back 
                    home.

                                  NORRIE
                    To Los Angeles?  Is that supposed 
                    to be incentive?  I despise--

      Before this squabble can get out of hand, two local POLICE 
      CARS come screaming past the Gas & Grocery.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   26.


                                  NORRIE (CONT D)
                    Holy shit.

                    Language.

      But Alice looks genuinely concerned about all those sirens.

                                  ALICE
                    Actually, maybe Norrie was right 
                    about stopping somewhere else.  We 
                    can always do lunch when we get to 
                    Bangor, yeah?

      Norrie nods with quiet appreciation, and the women soon SPEED 
      OFF, unaware of the death sentence waiting in their path.



      A large paper MAP OF CHESTER S MILL is unfolded across the 
      hood of our SUV. Big Jim, Duke and Linda are inspecting every 
      inch, while Barbie hangs back, trying to remain on the 
      sidelines.

                                  BIG JIM
                    There are twenty-four roads in and 
                    out of Chester s Mill.

                                  BIG JIM
                    Do what you can, I ve got a 
                      contingency plan for the...

      Big Jim hears a WHIRRING, and he looks up just as Julia 
      Shumway s Prius zooms into the crash site.  Duke and Big Jim 
      exchange UNCOMFORTABLE GLANCES the second they see her.

      Julia is out of her car in a flash, snapping photos with her 
      Nikon.  Barbie subtly shields his face, not wanting to end up 
      on any front pages, while an incensed Big Jim races over to 
      put his hand over her lens.

                                  BIG JIM (CONT D)
                    No cameras!  This is a national 
                    security matter!            UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   27.


                                  JULIA
                    You touch me, I will sue you out of 
                      existence.

                                  BIG JIM
                    I am a duly elected selectman and 
                    I m ordering you to leave.

                                  JULIA
                    I don t give a shit if you re an 
                    alderman or an emperor, you can t 
                    just--

                                  DUKE
                    Enough!  We don t have time for 
                    this. 

      Realizing he s right, Big Jim runs for his SUV while Duke 
      hops behind the wheel of his squad car.

                                  JULIA
                    Now you re all leaving?  

      Ignoring her, Duke calls out to his deputy.

                                  DUKE
                    Linda, commandeer Ms. Shumway s 
                    vehicle.  We ll cover more ground 
                    in two cars.

                                  JULIA
                    What the hell is happening?

      But Linda s already behind the wheel of Julia s idling Prius.

                                  DUKE
                    You want to help, get some medical 
                    attention for our guest.  

      And as the vehicles all PEEL OUT, Julia turns to Barbie, 
      noticing the handsome stranger for the first time.

                                  BARBIE
                    Um, thanks, but really, I m fine.

      A forward Julia gets right in Barbie s face, inspects the 
      gash above his eye. 

                                  JULIA
                    Bullshit.  You ve got a head wound 
                    and you re probably in shock.  Come 
                    on, their hospital isn t far.  You 
                    can tell me what the hell that was 
                    all about on the way.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   28.


                                  BARBIE
                    Look, my insurance isn t exactly--

                                  JULIA
                    Relax, my husband s a doctor, it s 
                    on the house.  I m Julia, by the 
                    way.  Who the hell are you?

      Realizing this persistent woman will never settle for  no 
      comment,  Barbie reluctantly reveals his name.

                                  BARBIE
                    Barbie.
                          (beat)
                    People just call me Barbie.

      She looks at him askance.

                                  BARBIE (CONT D)
                    Yeah.  I know. 

                                  JULIA
                    And how do you fit into all this?

                                  BARBIE
                    I don t.  I was just... passing 
                    through when it happened.

                                  JULIA
                    When what happened?

      And as Barbie struggles to find the right words, CUT TO:



      Elsewhere in Chester s Mill, our tourists  rental car kicks 
      up dust as it speeds down an unpaved road. 



      And in the parking lot of the Holy Redeemer Church, a DRIVER 
      has turned up the radio in his pick-up truck for the rest of 
      the PARISHIONERS now exiting morning service.

                                  FROM RADIO
                    We have a... a serious situation in 
                    town, and it s very important that 
                    every motorist listening to my 
                    voice stops their vehicle NOW.

      Clearly, everyone in town has started to pay attention.



      The understandably shaken women get out of their stopped car 
      to inspect this impossible tableau.

                                  ALICE
                    Is everyone all right?

                                    CAROLYN
                    What is this?  What... what are we 
                    seeing here?

      And as if things couldn t get any worse, Norrie s body 
      suddenly begins to TREMBLE.

                                  ALICE
                    Norrie?

      The girl COLLAPSES, and her parents both race to her side.  

                                    CAROLYN
                    NORRIE!           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   33.


      Norrie is convulsing on the ground, but it doesn t appear to 
      be an ordinary seizure.  She stares up at us with eyes WIDE 
      OPEN, as she repeats a seemingly nonsensical phrase:

                                  NORRIE
                    The pink stars are falling.  The 
                    pink stars are falling in lines.  
                    The pink stars are falling...

      Off Norrie s mothers, terrified by this gibberish, CUT TO:



      On the other side of town, Julia is leading Barbie across an 
      open field on their way to the hospital.  As she walks, an 
      overwhelmed Julia runs her fingers along the unending 
      barrier, looking in vain for gaps.

                                  JULIA
                    Christ, what is it?

                                  BARBIE
                    No idea.  Some kind of... 
                      experiment, maybe.

                                  JULIA
                    And what, we re the guinea pigs?  
                    What the hell would anyone have to 
                    learn from Chester s Mill?

                                  BARBIE
                    You tell me.

                                  JULIA
                    Please, I m a transplant, not a 
                    local.  This gig was supposed to be 
                      temporary.

      Julia looks at the seemingly endless barrier with concern.

                                  JULIA (CONT D)
                    It is temporary, isn t it?  I mean, 
                    if this thing appeared out of thin 
                    air, maybe it ll disappear, too.

                                  BARBIE
                          (doubting it)
                    Maybe.

                                  JULIA
                    You think we might be stuck in here 
                    a while?           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   34.


      Barbie nods.

                                  BARBIE
                    Even if what s wrong suddenly 
                    becomes right, the Army s apt to 
                      quarantine the whole town, at least 
                    for a while.

                                  JULIA
                    What makes you say that?
                          (then; working it out)
                    You re military, aren t you?

      Barbie gives Julia a flirtatious smile.  The lady s sharp.  

                                  BARBIE
                    Fifteen pounds ago.

                                  JULIA
                    Iraq?

      He nods.  Right again.

                                  JULIA (CONT D)
                    What d you do over there?

      Weighing how to answer, Barbie stares off at nothing in 
      particular.

                                  BARBIE
                    You know.
                          (then)
                    Shot a lot of hoops.

      And just when Julia is about to call him on this dodge...

                                    ANOTHER VOICE (O.S.)
                    ...help me...

      ...she and Barbie turn to see a BLOODSTAINED WOMAN shambling 
      their way.  She s used her own belt as a makeshift 
      TOURNIQUET, but her right forearm is still bleeding from 
      where her hand was SEVERED when the barrier came down.  

                                  WOMAN
                          (meekly)
                    I think I had an accident.

      With that, she COLLAPSES to the grass.

                                  JULIA
                    Jesus!

      Julia and Barbie both race to her side.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   35.


                JULIA (CONT D)BARBIE
      How...?She must have been reaching 
                                                  across when... whatever.

      Barbie checks for a pulse.

                                  JULIA (CONT D)
                    But she s gonna be okay, right?
                          (beat)
                    We can still help her, right?

      Barbie just looks up at Julia, and his expression says 
      everything.  



      Later that day, Deputy Linda Everett has diagonally parked 
      her commandeered Prius at a makeshift roadblock close to the 
      edge of the barrier.  She s looking out beyond it here.

                                  LINDA
                    Holy...

      Arc around to reveal that Linda s staring at a massive throng 
      of CABLE NEWS REPORTERS who have just started to arrive on 
      the other side of the barrier.  They re shouting questions at 
      Linda, but she can t hear through the soundproof divide.

                                  LINDA (CONT D)
                    Stop screaming and help us!

      Instead, the reporters turn to see a fleet of MILITARY TRUCKS 
      roaring their way.  Linda looks relieved to see the cavalry.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   38.


                                  LINDA (CONT D)
                    Finally.

      But as this caravan comes to a halt, dozens of soldiers 
      wearing LEVEL A HAZMAT SUITS leap out.  First, they corral 
      the angry reporters, then the soldiers begin establishing a 
      fifty yard PERIMETER around Chester s Mill.  Starting to grow 
      concerned, Linda waves her arms, trying to get their 
      attention.

                                  LINDA (CONT D)
                    Hey!  You got people trapped in 
                    here!  

      One of the soldiers looks right at Linda, only to then TURN 
      HIS BACK on her.  The hell?  

      Off the troubled deputy, starting to wonder whether she s 
      ever going to see her fianc  again, CUT TO:



      Outside a surprisingly modern Town Hall, Duke s squad car is 
      parked next to Big Jim s SUV.  A gasoline GENERATOR is now 
      loudly powering the building s electricity.



      Later that day, a freshly stitched-up Barbie is smoking 
      outside the hospital.  

      He s staring at the undeveloped land across the road from 
      this place, another dense cluster of trees like the woods he 
      fled this morning.  

                                    ANOTHER VOICE (O.S.)
                    Can I bum one?

      Barbie turns to see Angie, Junior s (now ex) girlfriend.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   41.


                                  BARBIE
                    Little young to be a nurse, aren t 
                    you?

                                  ANGIE
                    Just a lowly candy striper.
                          (then)
                    I heard you came in with Dr. 
                    Shumway s wife.  Julia?

      He nods, hands her his pack.

                                  ANGIE (CONT D)
                    So you saw it?  

                                  BARBIE
                    What there is to see.

                                  ANGIE
                    Some of the patients are describing 
                    it like we re stuck in a, a giant 
                    fishbowl.

      Barbie shrugs.  Maybe?

      Angie looks into this attractive stranger s eyes as he lights 
      his cigarette for her.

                                  ANGIE (CONT D)
                    I used to have fish.  Goldfish.  
                    Won a pair at the carnival when I 
                    was five.  But then one of them got 
                    sick and the other one... the other 
                    one fucking ate him, just pecked 
                    away at his friend until he was, 
                    like, dust.  Did you even know they 
                    did that?  Goldfish?

      Barbie shakes his head, not quite sure how to respond.  Angie 
      just laughs, darkly.  What a fucking day.  



      And now we re watching this same meet-cute from across the 
      street, where JUNIOR is spying on Barbie and Angie from 
      behind the cover of the dense treeline.  The young man 
      clearly doesn t like what he sees.  He nervously thumbs his 
      belt, where his KNIFE is now sheathed at his side.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   42.



      Meanwhile, a flirtatious Angie reaches out to touch Barbie s 
      face, brushes his hair back to inspect the fresh stitches. 

                                  ANGIE
                    Cancer, right?

                                  BARBIE
                          (taken aback)
                    Sorry?

                                  ANGIE
                    Your sign.  You re a cancer, yeah?

                                  BARBIE
                    I don t really believe that shit.

                                  ANGIE
                    And yet... 

      Barbie relents with a smile.

                                  BARBIE
                    How d you guess?

                                  ANGIE
                    Just the vibe you give off -- sad 
                    little crab, always looking for a 
                    home other than that big bad shell 
                    you hide behind.

      Barbie almost laughs at that, shakes his head.

                                  BARBIE
                    Trust me, all I want is out of 
                    here.

                                  ANGIE
                    Yeah.  You and me both.

                                    ANOTHER VOICE (O.S.)
                    Help!

      Barbie and Angie turn to see our LOS ANGELES TOURISTS, Norrie 
      and her two mothers.  

                                    CAROLYN
                    Please, we need help!

                                  ALICE
                    I, I don t understand what s going 
                    on here, but our daughter s had 
                    some sort of... episode.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   43.


                                    CAROLYN
                       Episode?   It was a goddamn 
                    seizure!

                                  ALICE
                    I know what a seizure looks like, 
                    Carolyn.  I m a doctor.

                                    CAROLYN
                    You teach history!  

      Ignoring them, Angie reaches out to touch the shaken Norrie. 

                                  ANGIE
                    You okay, gorgeous?

      Norrie nods, appreciative of this friendly new adult 
      presence.

                                  ANGIE (CONT D)
                    Come on, let s get you looked at.

      As she escorts the girl and her parents into the hospital, 
      Angie looks back at an understanding Barbie.  He bids her 
      farewell with a little salute, before heading out, unaware of 
      Junior still watching his every move...   



      On the outskirts of town, Julia has finally arrived at her 
      cottage-style house.  She pulls out the electronic opener 
      attached to her keychain, says a little prayer to herself as 
      she aims it at the garage.

                                  JULIA
                    Please God, just let his stupid car 
                    be in there.

      And much to her relief, the door opens to reveal another 
      hybrid still parked inside.  Thrilled, Julia races into her 
      home through the garage door...



      Barbie finally returns to his shitty compact car, still 
      parked where he was forced to leave it earlier that day.  He 
      unlocks the passenger-side door and opens the glove 
        compartment, looking around to make sure he s alone before 
      stuffing the HANDGUN into his jacket pocket.

      Barbie then opens the trunk, pulls out his military DUFFEL 
      BAG.  He slams the trunk shut, but when he does, he s taken 
      aback to find JUNIOR standing right there.

                                  JUNIOR
                    Evening.
                          (beat)
                    Need a hand?

      Barbie shoulders his bag as he sizes up the ripped young guy 
      standing before him.

                                  BARBIE
                    I m all right.  Thanks.

                                  JUNIOR
                    Hey, do we know each other?

                                  BARBIE
                    Doubt it.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   47.


                                  JUNIOR
                    You sure?  Something about you 
                    looks so familiar.  You re from 
                    around here, right?

      Barbie just shakes his head, starts walking away.

                                  JUNIOR (CONT D)
                    I m talking to you, asshole!

      Hearing that word, Barbie stops.  Drops his bag.  Slowly 
      turns around.  

                                  BARBIE
                    I don t know what I did to piss you 
                    off, but I promise... you don t 
                    want to start something here.

      Clearly not aware he s dealing with a guy who put a man in 
      the ground hours earlier, Junior gets right in Barbie s face. 

                                  JUNIOR
                    And what if I do?  

      Barbie is trying to maintain his cool, but he looks like he 
      might actually beat this kid to death.  Just when these two 
      are about to come to blows, FLOODLIGHTS illuminate them both.  

      It s Duke, who s again driving with his deputy Linda in 
      shotgun.  Junior cools his shit the second he sees him.  

                                  JUNIOR (CONT D)
                    Evening, Sheriff Perkins.

                                  DUKE
                    Junior.

      The sheriff turns his attention to a patched-up Barbie.

                                  DUKE (CONT D)
                    How you getting along?

                                  BARBIE
                    All right.
                          (then; lying)
                      Everyone s been very welcoming.

                                  DUKE
                    Well.  Be seeing you.

      With a nod, Duke drives off, and Barbie turns his attention 
      back to Junior... only to find that the strange young man has 
      already disappeared, having retreated back to the shadows.              UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   48.



      Back in the woods where his morning began, Barbie has hiked 
      to a remote old CABIN.  He drops his bag outside before 
      venturing into the old structure s back door, already AJAR.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   49.



      And with his best chance at shelter no longer a viable 
      option, Barbie shoulders his bag and heads back into the 
      night.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   50.



      Elsewhere in Chester s Mill, teenager Joe McClatchey is 
      sitting on the roof of the family barn, smoking another joint 
      as he looks out at the small-scale military invasion 
      unfolding on the other side of the barrier.  

                                    ANOTHER VOICE (O.S.)
                    Dude.

      Joe turns to see one of his friends from school, an older kid 
      named BEN DRAKE, who s just climbed onto this roof.

                                  BEN
                    It looks like a movie.

      Joe just takes another long drag.

                                  BEN (CONT D)
                    So both of your  rents were 
                      really...?

                                  JOE
                    Caught out.  Yeah.

      Ben takes a seat next to him.  Tries some gallows humor. 

                                  BEN
                    Well, silver lining.  Your house 
                    parties are gonna be sick.  

      But Joe doesn t exactly look elated.

                                  JOE
                    You bring the stuff?

      Ben hands him a little Ziplock.  Joe opens the baggie and 
      takes out two pills, dry-swallows them both.

                                  BEN
                    You re hardcore.  Tripping balls at 
                    the end of the world.

                                  JOE
                    You think that s what this is?  
                      Armageddon?

      Ben shrugs.

                                  BEN
                    My mom thinks maybe it s natural, 
                    like some aurora borealis bullshit.  

      Joe shakes his head.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   51.


                                  JOE
                    No.  Feels more like we re under 
                    attack.

                                  BEN
                    By who?

                                  JOE
                    By whom.  And I don t know.  China?  
                    Martians?  The goddamn future?

                                  BEN
                    Christ.  So, like, how do we fight 
                    back?

                                  JOE
                    I ve been thinking.  This force 
                    field thing.  It s gotta take a lot 
                    of energy to power it, right?

                                  BEN
                    I guess?

                                  JOE
                    Well, where the hell is all that 
                    power coming from?  Is it somewhere 
                    out there, or is it.... 

      Suddenly, Joe falls silent.  His body is perfectly still.

                                  BEN
                    Joe?  Don t mess with me, man.  
                    That shit s not gonna hit you for 
                    another hour.  

      But that s when Joe s body begins to TREMBLE.  

                                  BEN (CONT D)
                    JOE!

      Like the teenage tourist Norrie before him, a convulsing Joe 
      COLLAPSES, and begins repeating an eerily identical phrase: 

                                  JOE
                    The pink stars are falling.  The 
                    pink stars are falling in lines.  
                    The pink stars are falling...

      Ben is freaking out, but Joe just keeps repeating his mantra, 
      over and over and over, as we CUT TO:            UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   52.



      Above ground, Junior emerges from the shelter s entrance, an 
      old steel shed in a BACKYARD somewhere in Chester s Mill.  
      He s padlocking the entrance to this subterranean bunker when 
      someone appears behind him.

                                    ANOTHER VOICE (O.S.)
                    Junior?

      Junior wheels around to see BIG JIM RENNIE.  But instead of 
      freaking out, Junior gives this man a warm smile.

                                  JUNIOR
                    Dad.

      That s right, Big Jim is Junior s FATHER, and this is the 
      backyard of the same house the men still share to this day.

                                  BIG JIM
                    The heck are you doing out here?

                                  JUNIOR
                    I heard you on WKIC, sounded like 
                    we might need the old shelter.
                    But it s... covered in mold down 
                    there, every inch. 

                                  BIG JIM
                    Least of our worries now.  All that 
                    matters is you re okay.

      Unaware that he s standing directly above the innocent woman 
      Junior just imprisoned, Big Jim EMBRACES his son.

                                  JUNIOR
                      Whatever s going on, I want to 
                    help.

                                  BIG JIM
                    And I appreciate that, but your 
                    studies--

                                  JUNIOR
                    No.  School is out there, I m in 
                    here.  And I want to help.  As long 
                    as it takes.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   54.


      Big Jim looks at his only son with pride.  He thinks for a 
      moment, finally asks:

                                  BIG JIM
                    You ever considered a career in law 
                      enforcement?

      And off a gobsmacked Junior, already fantasizing about the 
      possibilities, CUT TO:



      But when she flings open her front door, Julia is surprised 
      to see another man entirely standing before her.

                                  JULIA
                    Oh. 

      It s BARBIE.

                                  BARBIE
                    Sorry to bother.  The hospital gave 
                    me your address.  I just wanted to 
                    see if your husband...

      Julia shakes her head.

                                  BARBIE (CONT D)
                    Shit.  I m sorry. 

                                  JULIA
                    No.  It was... it was nice of you 
                    to think of us.           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   55.


                                  BARBIE
                    You re sure there s nowhere else in 
                    town he might be?  You guys don t 
                    have a lake house or something?

      Julia almost laughs.

                                  JULIA
                    Peter and I can barely cover the 
                    mortgage on this place most months.  
                    Anyway, I already checked his usual 
                    haunts.  No luck.  I m hoping he s 
                    out volunteering with the EMTs.

                                  BARBIE
                    Makes sense.  Your guy, what s he 
                    look like, anyway?

                                  JULIA
                    Dark hair, good build, about your 
                    height.  
                          (a little embarrassed)
                    You know, handsome.

                                  BARBIE
                    Well, I ll keep an eye out.

      He starts to leave, but after a beat, Julia calls out to him.

                                  JULIA
                    Barbie.

      He stops cold, turns to look back at her.  

                                  JULIA (CONT D)
                    You have someplace to stay tonight?

      Oh.  Fuck.  Barbie hadn t been expecting this.  

                                  BARBIE
                    Figured I d just rough it.  Not my 
                    first time under the stars.

                                  JULIA
                    Don t be crazy.  You said it 
                    yourself, this might be a while.
                          (beat)
                    You should stay here.

                                  BARBIE
                    Oh, no, I couldn t--           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   56.


                                  JULIA
                    We ve got a guest room and 
                      everything.  Please.  I insist.

      Barbie takes a moment with this, considers the possibilities. 

                                  BARBIE
                    That s very kind of you.  Thanks.

      With a smile, Julia gestures for Barbie to follow her inside, 
      unwittingly welcoming the man who may very well have murdered 
      her husband into their home.

      As the front door closes behind them, CUT TO:



      On the other side of town, Linda has returned to the 
      invisible barrier with Duke.  All the two of them can do is 
      watch helplessly as countless SCIENTISTS and SOLDIERS 
      continue surveying the perimeter around Chester s Mill 
      without ever acknowledging its inhabitants.

      Wistful, Linda reaches out to again touch the invisible wall.

                                  LINDA
                    Rusty and I were supposed to be in 
                    Derry today.  For the game.
                          (then; sadly)
                    But I told him if we were ever 
                    gonna afford a honeymoon, we both 
                    had to put in more overtime...

      Duke isn t quite sure what to say to that.  He already feels 
      guilty as hell.

                                  LINDA (CONT D)
                    Why us?  I mean, why the hell would 
                    anyone pick Chester s Mill for 
                    anything?

      And now her boss just stares down at his boots.

                                  DUKE
                          (softly)
                    Maybe we re being punished.

      Linda turns to look back at him.

                                  LINDA
                    Sorry?           UNDER THE DOME      "Pilot"      October Draft       10/3/12   57.


                                  DUKE
                    You re good police, Linda... but 
                    there s a lot I ve tried to protect 
                    you from.  About this place.   

                                  LINDA
                    Like what?

      Duke clears his throat, trying not to get emotional.  Then he 
      looks at the barrier.  For the first time, the sheriff 
      reaches out to touch the strange force field for himself.  
      The hair on his arm stands on end as he feels the initial 
      tingle.  Huh.  

      His curiosity satisfied, Duke looks back at his deputy:

                                  DUKE
                    Last year, Big Jim Rennie came to 
                    me and--

      But that s when something inside Duke Perkins begins to HUM.  

      Feeling a strange tingling sensation, he looks down at his 
      uniform shirt... just in time to see his PACEMAKER come 
      EXPLODING OUT OF HIS CHEST.

      Splattered with a fine mist of blood, Linda looks at the 
      fresh hole in Duke with horrified bewilderment.  What the 
      hell just happened?  

      Not quite sure himself, Duke Perkins collapses.  He s dead.

      As Linda opens her mouth to unleash a piercing scream, we 
      HARD CUT TO: 



      As Arcade Fire s  My Body Is A Cage  (or something similarly 
      operatic) starts to play, we float up and over the captive 
      town of Chester s Mill.  Each and every one of its houses 
      looks like a story, a wellspring of secrets and lies bubbling 
      beneath the relentless pressure of the dome. 

      We soar all the way across town until we reach the tall tree 
      with the same BIRD NEST where our story began.  The newly 
      hatched chick has been joined by a few other hungry mouths, 
      but their mother is nowhere to be seen.  

      WHAM.  That s when Mama Bird flies straight for this nest, 
      only to be REBUFFED by the invisible barrier.  
        Heartbreakingly, this bird was trapped on the other side, 
      leaving her young ones starving and alone.

      But now we join this distraught mother bluebird by cutting 
      OUTSIDE the dome for the first and only time in our series.

      Zooming out, we pull past throngs of confused scientists, 
      breathless reporters and worried loved ones, until the 
      massive dome around Chester s Mill finally comes into view.  

      Though transparent, the dome starts to become visible as 
      light is subtly warped at its curves.  From this viewpoint, 
      we can finally see the structure s terrifying scope.    

      And just as the Arcade Fire dies out, something extraordinary 
      happens.  A powerful military spotlights sweeps over the 
      dome, and an IMAGE flashes across its transparent surface, 
      shimmering like a mirage -- it s the same UNIQUE SYMBOL that 
      was on the empty box Barbie took from Julia s late husband.    

      But the mysterious symbol soon fades from view as suddenly as 
      it appeared.  The military spotlight then sweeps past us, 
      filling the frame with blinding whiteness, as we--

 SMASH TO BLACK.
