KATE HARRISON, 28, exits the CVS. Attractive, smiling, fresh-
faced - a confident young lady with the world at her 
fingertips. The world and a small bag of toiletries. Two 
great things.

A shout distracts her from her happy reverie.

Kate is cut-off when a NERF DART plows into her head. 

Camera turns to see BERT, 7, gleeful and laughing.

KIM

HILLARY and NELSON, 15 - twins - march into frame. They are 
the Odd Couple of twinhood: Hillary is popular, smart and 
entitled. Nelson is a sloppy space cadet. 

HILLARY
Nelson keeps trying to take my 
phone. Would you tell him to keep

Hillary grabs the handle of their minivan and tugs at it.

A Nerf Dart ricochets off her head.

END COLD OPEN4.


ACT ONE

FADE IN:



Kate walks into the school, as another car pulls in - a nice 
one - and parks right next to Kate s. A very tall, fit woman 
emerges. This is DIANE, late 40s. Former Olympic Swimmer. 
Current Orthopedic Surgeon. Intimidating. Accomplished - and 
 Mom.Hillary and Nelson s

They head in together to - 



Meg stands on the sidelines with other parents, mostly 
talking on their cell phones.

The team warms up with jumping jacks led by their coach, 
MIKE. His shirt flaps up, revealing a flat stomach.

MEG
Hello, abs.

A TEAM MOM approaches and taps Meg on the shoulder.11.


TEAM MOM
Hi there - I just wanted to 
 Kathy. Are introduce myself. I m
you Brad s new wife?

Meg looks at her blankly - and then bursts out laughing. She 
laughs for a very long time.

TEAM MOM (CONT D)

MEG

 my my breath. Oh no. Sorry. That s

The awkward moment is interrupted by Coach Mike:

COACH MIKE
Hi parents. Coach Duane is out 
today. I was wondering if one of 
you would mind stepping in to even 
out our numbers.

Meg raises her hand and steps out onto the field.

MEG
(flirty)
I played intramural in college.

Coach Mike smiles. Off Bert, putting his head in his hands. 



Kate heads to her car, frustrated, muttering.

KATE

She gets into her car, still worked up as she turns the key 
in the ignition.

Kate looks up to see Mrs. Steinberg asking Diane for an 
autograph in the foyer. 

KATE (CONT D)
Oh give me a break...

Venting her frustration, Kate peels out - too quickly. She 
 car, hitting the side mirror, swipes the side of Diane s
knocking it off of its hinge.16.


Kate looks up - Diane and Mrs. Steinberg are still chatting. 
They didn t notice. 

Kate makes a split-second decision, and pulls away. As she 
does she sees, standing in a doorway: Nelson, staring right 
at her. 

KATE (CONT D)
Nelson?

They make eye contact. Then Nelson disappears back into the 
school. 

Off Kate: shit.



Meg is supervising a drill. Kids are taking turns shooting on 
Bert in goal. Their shots all go wide or fail to reach the 
goal.

MEG
 done.Lemme show you how it s

Meg winds up and WAILS the ball at Bert. It blazes past him.

MEG (CONT D)
Gooooooooaaaaaalllllll!

She races around celebrating. The kids look annoyed.

BERT
That was too hard.

MEG
What, you think your opponents are 
going to take it easy on you?

BERT
My opponents are seven. 

Coach Mike jogs over.

COACH MIKE

the boys some moves.17.


COACH MIKE

 here to help them to win, you re
learn.

MEG
Of course.

She gives him a flirty tap on the stomach.

MEG (CONT D)
Wow, it s like a granite countertop 
in there. 

She does it again. Coach Mike smiles. Bert wants to die.



Kate heads to her car - cold/flu medicine in one hand, her 
phone in the other. 

KATE
Who is this? 

JACKIE
 Jackie! Who is It sthis?

KATE
(annoyed)
Jackie, who let you in?

They hang up. Brad calls out from upstairs:

BRAD (O.S.)

Kate pulls into the parking lot. Annoyed. Her phone rings 
again. She answers.

KATE

MEG

BERT
Eat my dust, farthead! 

Meg frowns. 

MEG

Meg looks up to see Coach Mike heading towards the sidelines -
where he embraces a cute twenty-something girl, STEPHANIE.

MEG (CONT D)

Uh, his girlfriend. Get a clue.

Bert runs away, laughing. Meg darkens.24.

Kate hangs up her cell phone and turns to the pouting Hillary 
and game-addicted Nelson.

KATE

Kate turns to see, pulling up next to her: Diane, her side-
view mirror still dangling.

DIANE
Hello, Kate.

ACT THREE



Meg tears downfield, heading for Bert in the opposing goal.

 TEAMKID ON MEG S

Meg ignores him. Coach Mike and Stephanie watch in horror as 
she dribbles past one defender after another.

Finally, it s just Bert. Bert puts up his hands, determined. 
Meg winds up and nails the ball. It ROCKETS toward the goal 
and hits Bert right in the nuts.

He goes down. Meg runs over.

MEG
Are you okay?

BERT
(grunting)
Yes.

Meg taps the ball over the goal line.

Coach Mike blows his whistle and waves his arms.

COACH MIKE
Okay! That s enough for today.

Bert sits up, dejected. The other goalie/random kid 
approaches.

RANDOM KID

The kid spits in the dirt and runs off. Bert lies back down.

HILLARY
Bye, Mom.

DIANE

Kate looks over and smiles at Bert who is RUNNING at her. She 
opens her arms for a hug - finally, a warm moment for Kate.

KATE
Hey sport. How was soccer?

BERT

He ducks around her arms and waddles in to the house. Kate 
 looks at Meg - what the hell happened? Meg shrugs, like,  I
 have no idea! 

Kate, frustrated, chases everyone in.
