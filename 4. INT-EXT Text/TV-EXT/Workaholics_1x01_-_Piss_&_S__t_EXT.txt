      BLAKE, stands with ADAM and they drink beers.

                                  BLAKE
                    No... but they are real.  It s like 
                    aliens.  We haven t captured one 
                    yet, but they re out there.

                                  ADAM
                    I don t know.  I don t know if I 
                    believe in aliens either.

      ANDERS approaches.

                                  BLAKE 
                    Ders, tell Adam that albino Asians 
                    are real.

                                  ANDERS
                    Yeah right.  They would have 
                    captured one by now.

                                  ANDERS (CONT'D)
                    Guess what I just got into.

                    I don t know.  A bunch of dudes?

                    I ve got some girl named Annette,

                    She s been texting me all morning 
                    and it s pretty righteous stuff 
                     cause, welp, lemme just tell you:

                    Again, I don t remember this chick.  
                    I said,  I didn t know you wanted 
                    to roll like that.   She says,

                    said,  We re having a shindig, you

                    Yeah, the nipple of my dreams.

                                  BLAKE
                    You should probably get that girl 
                    over here.  Why don t you send her 
                    a pic... of your dick?

                    things.  It goes nipple, dick,

                    I m proud of you, dude.  Get rid of 
                    that hat.


      Anders walks back to Adam and Blake, arms raised in triumph.

                                  ANDERS
                    Countdown to vagina town.

      We hear a phone BEEP.  Adam pulls a BEDAZZLED PHONE from his 
      pocket and types on the keypad.

                                  ADAM
                    Forward to - select all and - send.

      Adam hands the phone to a girl.

                                  ADAM
                    Vanessa, thanks for the phone.

                    What are you doing with her phone?

      Adam and Blake laugh at Anders as CELL PHONES AT THE PARTY 
      RING AND BUZZ.  Ders catches on and looks crushed.

                                  ADAM
                    You were texting me on Vanessa s 
                    phone.  The nipple of your dreams, 
                    is now the nipple of your 
                      nightmares.

      Adam unbuttons his shirt REVEALING his SHAVED NIPPLE.  Blake 
      pulls out an electric razor, BUZZING IT.

      FADE IN:


      The party is winding down.  Anders climbs a ladder, onto the 
      roof, to meet Blake and Adam (who re doing Edward 40 Hands).

                                  ANDERS
                    So this is where my  friends  are.

                                  BLAKE
                    Look who it is.  It s Tan Dick

                    You know guys, when you kick a dude 
                    and he s down...

      Anders pulls a blunt out of his shirt pocket and grabs a 
      beer.

                                  ANDERS (CONT'D)
                    He s not likely to share his blunt 
                    with you.

                                  ADAM
                    You don t smoke.

                                  ANDERS
                    Yeah well, I m smokin  tonight.

                                  BLAKE
                    But, with us, right?

                                  ANDERS
                    I don t have to.

                                  ADAM
                    You should be thanking us, because 
                    all those chicks have seen your 
                    super tan dick now, and that s

      The guys spot a ROLLER BLADER in their driveway.

                                  ADAM
                    Oh shit.

      The roller blader bends down to pick something up.  Adam and 
      Blake stand up on the roof and yell:

                  ADAM (CONT'D)BLAKE
      POOP DOLLAR!POOP DOLLAR!

      The roller blader skates away quickly as the guys laugh.

                    Come on guys, this is Sunday fun 
                    day.  Let s get wild!

      Blake CLINKS his forty onto their beer bottles, causing them 
      to overflow and forcing Adam and Anders to quickly chug the 
      escaping beer.

                                  BLAKE (CONT'D)
                    Yeah!


      The guys exit the office building and head toward their car, 
      an  85 maroon Volvo.

      Adam rolls his eyes and spins into the passenger seat.


      The guys, itchy and red-faced, run up to a schoolyard fence.   
      The CHILDREN scream and run away at the sight of their red, 
      sweaty faces.

                    Yeah, maybe I could go.  But what s

      Anders hands the kid a small plastic bag.

                                  ANDERS
                    We can do that.  Take this bag, pee 
                    in it, and wait right here, OK?


      The Punk Kid is there as the guys run up to the fence.  He 
      has the plastic bag Ders gave him, now filled with piss.

                                  ADAM
                    Let s get that piss!

      The kid holds up a THUMB DRIVE.

                    It holds five thousand songs, OK?

      Blake holds out his contraband.

                                  BLAKE
                    Alright, check me out.  I ve got

                    Oh yeah, baby.  Now hand the pee 
                    first.  The pee first!

      Just then an angry TEACHER makes his way toward the guys.

                                    TEACHER
                    Hey!  What are you guys doing?

                                  PUNK KID
                    Shit!

      The kid drops the bag of pee as he passes it through the 
      fence.  The bag breaks and pee spills on the ground.

                                  PUNK KID (CONT D)
                    They raped me!

      Chaos breaks lose.  The guys yell and frantically try to grab 
      the bag.

                                  PUNK KID (CONT D)
                    They touched me!  They touched me!

      The guys reach the remains of the bag and bolt just as the 
      teacher reaches the fence.

                                                                            CUT TO:                      Workaholics 101 - Network Draft - 4/6/10             26.



      The guys exit the building and walk toward their car with 
      Robbie close behind.

                                  ROBBIE
                    So you guys are gonna come back 
                    tomorrow.  Gonna get your stuff, 
                    sorta do the walk of shame - is 
                    that your thing?

      Anders turns and Blake immediately  holds him back. 

                                  ANDERS
                    You know, you are so lucky we re 
                    not in high school right now.

                                  ROBBIE
                    Why?

                                  ANDERS
                    BECAUSE I LOVED HIGH SCHOOL!

      Adam points to something on the ground and reaches down.

                                  ADAM
                    Hey!

      It s the poop dollar, near Robbie s foot.  Robbie spots it 
      and steps on it right before Adam can reach.

                                  ROBBIE
                    Sorry!  Nope.  No.  I get that too.

                    OK.  Lucky.

      The guys approach their car and Robbie shoos them away.

                                  ROBBIE
                    Yeah.

      As the guys get in their car, Robbie looks down and notices 
      what he stepped on.

                                  ANDERS

      The guys laugh as they drive away.

                                  ROBBIE
                          (calling after them)
                    You think that s funny?  Huh?

                    me!?  I m the best in the west!  
                    I m Robbie!

      Robbie takes off his shoe and throws it on the ground, then 
      walks back toward the office building.

                                  ROBBIE (CONT D)
                    Damnit!

                    vacuum - and shove it up your ass 
                    on FULL SUCTION!

      Robbie exits.  Alice sits back down at her desk chair.

                                  ALICE (CONT D)
                    Jillian!

      Jillian pops her head in through the doorway.
