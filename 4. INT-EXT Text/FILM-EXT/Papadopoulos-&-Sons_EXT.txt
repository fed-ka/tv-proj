A very English scene - a beautiful English garden belonging to a
mansion house. A smartly turned out gardener in green overalls
is raking leaves. It's an impressive picture of Britishness and
order. Another gardener, DAVE is trimming the edge of the lawn.
We see shots of the garden; plants, trees, a gazebo, sundial,
water fountain etc. We follow one of the gardeners pushing a
wheelbarrow across the width of the lawn and we see the rear of
this impressive property.

A chauffeur-driven Mercedes pulls up to the front of the mansion
house. MRS PARRINGTON, the housekeeper and nanny, waits for the
car. HARRY and his children, JAMES, KATIE and THEO exit through
the front door. As they do so, MRS PARRINGTON makes sure the
children are smartly turned out. The chauffeur gets out and
opens the door for the children.

HARRY opens the front door. We see a friendly door-to-door
salesman with a charity badge around his neck. He has a plastic
basket of cleaning products.

Evening boss. Sorry to disturb. I work
for a homeless charity.
HARRY
Sorry. No thanks.
DOOR KNOCKER
New dish cloths?
HARRY
I know how you people operate.
DOOR KNOCKER
I got a badge.
HARRY studies the badge.
HARRY
No mention of a charity.
DOOR KNOCKER
Come on boss. Give us a break. I'm
trying to earn a living here. Look.
Got tea towels, surface cleaners,
scrubbers, brushes, window sprays,

Hello there mini boss.

Who's that man?

He's a... he's a... he. He works for a
charity.
THEO
Is it a cake sale?
DOOR KNOCKER
Cakes? Did you say cakes? Did he say
cakes? How do you know? That's what I
want to do. Open up a cake shop.
HARRY
Cakes? Really.
DOOR KNOCKER
Cup cakes, individually decorated
gingerbread men, bite-sized apple
strudels, gooey fudge balls, mini-
muffins as well as your traditional
fare. Got a business plan and
everything. It'll be egalitarian but
feel exclusive - sort of my mission
statement really. The Progressive
People's Cake Shop. With...
progressive pricing.
HARRY
That's very good. I know a thing or
two about the food business as well.
DOOR KNOCKER
Really? I'm looking for investors.
HARRY
Retail's not for me, I'm afraid.
Staff. Nightmare. They'll nick your
cakes, upset your customers, then do
you for wrongful dismissal.

Oh. Thanks for the encouragement.

removal truck is parked outside alongside the Mercedes and a
Bentley sports car - displaying (PAPA 1 and PAPA 2 number

SPIROS loads up some suitcases into the back. HARRY carries
his businessman of the year award. JAMES has some plants.
THEO has his laptop. KATIE has designer dress bags and shoes.
On the side of the van we see "The Honest Handyman" with a
telephone number and the strapline, "If it's still broke...
then we can't fix it. That's honesty!" The logo is a hammer
with angel wings. The van pulls out of the drive.

The van pulls up in front of The Three Brothers Fish and Chip
Shop. The door is boarded up and covered in posters. We see

Spiros please. It's not a holiday.
Just show everyone around.

You want to go out sometime?
KATIE
Yeah, alright.
MEHMET
I'm Mehmet.
KATIE
It's Katie. (They shake hands) It's

MEHMET
Yeah. Pretty much. (Looking around)
Yeah. Catch you later.
KATIE
Yeah. Bye.
MEHMET walks back to his shop. KATIE smiles. Music - Athina,
Athina by The Trio Attico . HARRY steps outside the shop. He
looks at KATIE who is still smoking. He stands there for a
moment looking a little lost. He gets into SPIROS' van and

HARRY drives to a cemetery. He parks the van and exits with

We are in front of the shop. SPIROS addresses a small gathering
of people who have turned up to help in the renovation. He holds
a bottle of champagne. Alongside him, HARRY carries the box of
cleaning products. We see JAMES, KATIE, THEO and MRS PARRINGTON.
We see FAT LAKI, PHIL THE TILL, FATHER JIMMY, a Greek Orthodox
priest and an assortment of Greek faces of various ages.
SPIROS
We were children when we came to
the UK with nothing. We start
again. Fat Laki. The weight you
lost is an inspiration. Phil The
Till. You've helped many Greeks
with your tax friendly till
machines. Eh, only two things are
certain in life - death and taxes.
Unless you're Greek. Then it's only
death! (The crowd cheer). Nikos,
Kyriaco, Androniki, Loula, Uncle
Panikos, Aphrodite, Maria and of
course, Father Jimmy. Thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
HARRY
Didn't Father Jimmy get done for
selling illegal copies of Rambo?

He's got three liquor stores in
Palmers Green.

currently in negotiations with a top
corporate finance team about re-
acquiring the assets of Papadopoulos &
Sons. That's it.
UNCLE PANIKOS
What did he say?
PHIL THE TILL
He's had some sort of breakdown.
UNCLE PANIKOS
Tragic.
SPIROS
James, music.
SPIROS nods towards JAMES who pushes a button on a his docked
MP3 player. Greek music - Oba, Oba Ta Bouzoukia by the Delphi
Brothers.
SPIROS (CONT'D)
Thank you. I officially announce
the renovation of the Three
Brothers.
HARRY
You're supposed to do that after you
launch something.
SPIROS
To hell with convention.

party who cheer 'bravo' and clap.

Montage to the same music. MRS PARRINGTON picks up a tray
with teas and we follow her through the shop. She stops so
that people can take a mug and we see her continue her
journey - all the way through the shop to outside, where we
see HARRY sitting alone in the van. He's not part of the
activity. We see scrubbing, cleaning, fixing. Boards are
taken down. Inside we see people painting and the fish fryer
cleaned. We see product displays go up. We see SPIROS with
manic and crazy enthusiasm. JAMES and KATIE messing around.
Finally, we see FATHER JIMMY splashing holy water, saying a
prayer and making the sign of the cross over the fish frying
range while others stand and watch the ceremony with respect.

the entrance. We see a skip. We see him peering in through a
window. He walks over to the skip and looks in. He climbs in.
Inside the skip among old cardboard boxes, a broken chair etc he
finds a selection of plants - some of them in pots. He picks one
up, the one with the distinctive Union Jack pot, and brushes the
leaves. We then see him walk off with a box of plants.

So it's 30% on materials. The fish,

you include energy? Light, heat?
HARRY
Yeah. But not rent because we already
own the building.
SOPHIE
Okay. And 30% on labour?
HARRY
Yeah.
SOPHIE
So it's 30/30/30. Classic restaurant
model.
HARRY
That's right.
SOPHIE
What are your weaknesses?
HARRY
The price of fish can vary.
Dramatically.
SOPHIE
Can you vary the menu?
HARRY
You don't want to complicate it.
SOPHIE
It doesn't have to be complicated
Harry. (Beat) What are your fears?
HARRY
My fears? Oh. Just that it just won't
work out. That fish and chips has
maybe had its day.
SOPHIE
No. Hang on a second. (They stop)
Fish and chips is a British
classic. It's much more than just a
quick meaningless experience. It's
something to be savoured. Just
think of the soft, white, cod
flakes, gently falling away as your
fork pierces the hard, crunchy
shell of the golden batter. The
rich smells of a fryer's delight.
The tangy smack of salt and vinegar
on your lips. Hell yeah. I'd pay
for that.

once. Maybe even on this bridge.
MEHMET
See. Look where he ended up?

So, what's your plan?

Lovely hot chips. Come and try.
Little boy. Battered inside.
Special chip for you? And one for
you. Fish and chips, come and try.
We batter our own fish.

images cover over two months of activity at the shop and beyond.
Some of these shots are out of focus. Some are over exposed etc.
Some are badly framed. Sometimes the people in the shots are
aware of being photographed, sometimes not. They rotate once
every four or five seconds throughout the song. The images we
see are:
1. KATIE dangling two fish from her ears as if they are
earrings.
2. MRS PARRINGTON behind the counter of the fish bar having a
cup of tea.

That's, that's very good. I'm happy

Yeah, I have. And I can tell you.
Success is... the joy you feel.
