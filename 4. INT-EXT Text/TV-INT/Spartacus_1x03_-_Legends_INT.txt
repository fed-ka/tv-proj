  CAMERA PUSHES IN to the cell which is deserted except for 
  SPARTACUS. Standing naked. QUICK FLASHES as Spartacus: -- 
  Firmly secures his subligaria (the loincloth worn by most 
    gladiators). -- Attaches a quilted padded wrapping to his 
  leg. -- Fastens an iron greave over the wrap, the armor 
  extending a little above his knee. His legs completely 
  armored, Spartacus picks up

  SURA S PURPLE BINDING.

  A reminder of his wife, of why he fights. He gently kisses 
  it before tying it around his forearm and securing his 
  manica (forearm guard) over it.



  NAEVIA helps secure a WIG to LUCRETIA's beautiful head.

                        paid, and what thanks from the 
                        Magistrate?  He fears he will be 
                        unable to attend our reception on

                        The imagined sort. I hear rumor he

  Batiatus frowns.

                        The soaring expense of this thing 
                        raises concern.

                        I do not question its import. I 
                        question its scale. The drought has 
                        stretched our resources thin. Now

  She kisses him. He responds, his blood rising. As he peels 
  off her robe and it drops to the floor...



  A coin hits the dusty sand. PULL BACK to reveal A THRONG OF 
  GLADIATORS seated in a circle, gambling on bones and dice. 
  GNAEUS runs the show, and right now, the dice are tumbling 
  his way.

  Rhaskos glares, tosses Gnaeus the money as the other 
  gamblers LAUGH. Rhaskos gets up and heads off. FOLLOW him 
  through the mess hall where Gladiators eat and nap. One guy 
  in the corner jerks off.

  BARCA

  sits at a table, gently feeding a pigeon bread crumbs. 
  Barca s lover PIETROS brings him his food and drink.

                      He stands a legend. After Carthage 
                        suffered defeat by the Romans, they

                        Unfortunate, yet hardly the stuff 
                      of legend.

                                        VARRO
                        Mago was a warrior of fierce 
                        renown. A chief upon a throne of 
                        blood. He was also Barca s father, 
                      as the story tells.

  An interesting wrinkle. Spartacus sizes Barca up once more.

  Spartacus spots Batiatus crossing the square. He quickly 
  rises to intercept.

                        Legatus Glaber spoke truth. She was

  Hope blossoms.

                        The earth has many corners in which

  Batiatus flares, his eyes flashing with the promise of

  Shit! Crixus didn t mean to insult Naevia. He s flustered. 
  Tries backpedaling.

                                        CRIXUS
                        I did not intend insult --

  They reach the entrance to Lucretia s bedchamber.

                                        NAEVIA
                        Domina awaits.

  Crixus wants to say more, but it s too late. He nods in 
    resignation, entering --



  Lucretia stands wearing nothing but a sheer gown and Ramel s 
  emerald necklace. A vision of beauty and power.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        You walk too slowly to my chambers.

                                        CRIXUS
                        I would move with hurried gait, but 
                        did not want to arouse suspicions 
                        among the men to my purpose.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        And what might that be, Champion of 
                        Capua?

                                        CRIXUS
                        Whatever domina desires

  Lucretia smiles. There s a familiarity here. This has been 
  going on for quite some time now.

                                        LUCRETIA
                                  touches necklace)(
                        I purchased this for the 
                        reception... Do you think it too 
                        much?

                                        CRIXUS
                      My blood rises at the sight. Though 
                      to give the necklace credit would 
                      be false praise.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        What quickens your pulse, then?

  Crixus moves closer, almost touching her.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    16.

                        The taste of your lips. Your 
                        breasts... And the more delicate 
                        pleasure below them...

  Lucretia loves the adulation, but also loves the game.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        You think of me often?

                                        CRIXUS
                        With every breath.

  She kisses him, hard and hungry.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        I need your cock inside me.

  He slides her gown off. She half snarls in his ear, animal 
  passion rising.

                                          LUCRETIA(cont'd)
                        Make it hurt.

  Crixus  eyes blaze with savage intent as he slams Lucretia 
  down on the bed, the motion transitioning us to --



  A hole about twenty feet deep littered with garbage, shit, 
  and dead animals. CLOSE ON shit and slop being dumped in 
  from above (off screen). PAN OVER to find Spartacus and 
  Varro standing waist deep in the sludge, splattered with it. 
  A beat.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Perhaps I spoke out of turn.

                                        VARRO
                        Perhaps? What I perceived as 
                        courage in you reveals itself 
                        foolishness.

                                          SPARTACUS
                      To surrender in the arena... It is 
                        something I cannot do. I must have 
                        victory.

  His eyes drop to Sura s binding. He wipes a spot of sludge 
  away from it, jaw setting in determination.

                                        VARRO
                        What happens when that is something 
                        you cannot provide?

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    18.

                        Pluto s asshole. The answer has no 
                        balance with your actions.

  Spartacus hesitates, uncertain if he should give voice to 
  his reasoning. Yet the weight is heavy, and must be shared.

                                          SPARTACUS

                      Of what? What could he offer a man 
                        who seeks neither fame nor glory.

                                          SPARTACUS
                      My wife. Taken from me when I was

                      in the arena, and he will find her.

  Varro looks at him, seeing this entirely new dimension.

                                        VARRO
                      Is she worth it? The suffering. The 
                        pain.

                        Perhaps the smell will have washed 
                        off by then.

  Spartacus grins.

                        What name do you call her?

                        So. Buried up to your balls in 
                        garbage. This part of your plan to 
                        get her back?

  More sludge pours down from above, WIPING us to --



  TIGHT ON SURA S BINDING as powerful hands clean it. POP WIDE 
  to reveal Spartacus working on the task. Varro stands at his 
  side, scraping the last of the muck from his body. Crixus, 
  Gnaeus, Barca, and the other Gladiators scrape down, 
  snickering at the two men.

  SPARTACUS

  takes a small cup of water, pours it on the binding to wash 
  it. Varro frowns.

                                        VARRO
                        You d waste your ration cleaning a

  The room quiets as Doctore enters with Ashur, who carries a 
  piece of parchment in hand. Doctore pins Spartacus with a 
  hard stare. Spartacus holds it for a moment, then 
    begrudgingly drops his eyes.

                        Vulcanalia are decided.

  Excited murmurs ripple through the baths.

  Crixus grins, stepping forward. Grunts of pride erupt from 
  the men.

                        The unbeaten champion of Capua. You 
                        will honor the name of Batiatus by 
                        fighting in his primus!

  Crixus nods confidently. There was never any doubt.

                        Who stands against me, Doctore?

  Everyone tenses, wishing for the spot.

                        years, and shall be rewarded. 
                        Gnaeus!

  The men laugh and cheer. Gnaeus is pumped. Finally gets the 
  call to the big dance. Crixus grips forearms with him, a 
  pleased smile creasing his face.

  Doctore turns and exits. The men descend on Ashur and his

  Barca snatches the list from his hands.

                        Savages.

  It quickly makes the rounds, men bellowing with delight or 
  cursing their misfortune at being left out. Spartacus 
  latches onto it, scans it quickly before it s ripped from 
  his hands.

  Spartacus darkens at the thought.

                        I already bested Crixus once, in 
                        the final test. Now I must work my 
                        way up through the dregs to face 
                        him again?

                                          SPARTACUS
                        You know my meaning. If Batiatus 
                        had not stayed my hand, I would 
                        have parted his brains from his 
                        skull.

  Ashur, having retrieved the list, glances over, clocking 
  Crixus as he exits.

                                        ASHUR
                        There is no love lost between 
                        myself and Crixus...

  His eyes drop to his crippled leg, the memory of the wound 
  still fresh.

                                          ASHUR(cont'd)
                        but I caution, he is dangerous.

                        A reputation built on what? Facing 
                        men such as Gnaeus and his little 
                        net?

                        Crixus forged his reputation 
                        against far worse. Demons, belched 
                        from the underworld.

                        were cast into the arena to die. 
                        But instead flourished on meals of 
                        bone and blood...

  We push past Ashur, the background transforming into --



  Spartacus looks at Ashur like he s a fucking idiot.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        The sons of a jackal?

                        The story is a jest. Like the man 
                        himself.

  Gnaeus overhears.

                                        GNAEUS
                        The cock on this one!

                                  Spartacus)
                        One day, maybe you prove yourself. 
                         Til then, you fight at dawn with 
                        the rest of the shitwhores.

  The Gladiators EXPLODE in laughter. Spartacus glares as 
  Gnaeus moves off, WIPING US TO --



  The men clean up after practice. Pietros rubs oils onto 
  Barca s imposing frame. Barca glares at Varro and Spartacus. 
  Varro frowns.

                                        VARRO
                        I must make a point to stop 
                        standing beside you.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Gnaeus is of an unsteady nature. 
                        His humor was bound to crack.

                                        VARRO
                        Like his skull?

  Spartacus rubs oil onto his skin, sniffs in surprise.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Scented oils?

                        stench.
                                (leaning close, a 
                                  whisper)
                      If your intent was to claim Gnaeus  
                        berth in the primus, you re a fool. 
                      He served five years before he was 
                        afforded the privilege.

                        Sura cannot afford years.

                        Nor your death, which is surely 
                        your station if you face Crixus in 
                        the arena.

  Doctore appears, dressed in his finest.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Gladiators! Your public arrives, 
                        and they hunger for your presence. 
                        Dress quickly. The reception 
                        begins.

  Doctore moves off, WIPING US TO --                                                                                    28.



  The reception is in full swing. Much smaller than the Cena 
  Libera, this is more like a dinner party intended to drum up 
  business. The villa has been decorated in all its fineries 
  as the Capuan middle crust mingle amongst themselves.

  A HOLLOWED OUT GOAT S HEAD

  drifts by. The SLAVE carrying it stops before some GUESTS, 
  offering up chunks of oily boar meat and sliced melon from 
  within.

  CRIXUS

  stands like a chiseled statue, sword in hand. A small knot 
  of admirers, both male and female, stand in awe. Batiatus 
  approaches with MERCATO, a well-to-do man in his 50s.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Crixus! Let good Mercato have a 
                        closer look at your sword.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Dominus.

  He hands over his sword. Mercato grins at the weight of it.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The very blade used to strike down 
                        Decimus and Tiberius.

                        Hold it just so, you can almost see 
                        their blood yet dripping from it.

  Batiatus  eyes twinkle as he hands the sword back to Crixus.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                      If you intend to bestow Capua with 
                        the gift of a munus, what better 
                        means than securing Crixus? Along 
                        with a dozen or so of my other 
                        offerings to round out the 
                        proceedings?

                        I have been contemplating a day of 
                        games in honor of my --

                        Ashur!

  Ashur hustles over, ledger in hand.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    29.

                        Good Mercato has his designs on a 
                        munus. Let us see his order well 
                        filled...

  Batiatus waves to Crixus to follow. As they exit, Lucretia 
  enters with ILITHYIA, Naevia several steps behind.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        The dust and the heat, it worsens 
                      by the hour. I d yet be in Rome if 
                      it weren t for the games. You must 
                        promise to visit while I m here. My 
                        father s villa is beyond 
                        depressing. A hundred rooms and no 
                        one to occupy them but me.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Don t you have any slaves?

                      Of course. I meant real people.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        It s unfortunate your husband 
                        wasn t able to join you. How fares 
                        the Legatus?

                                        ILITHYIA
                      In a mood. Since his return from 
                        Thrace, the Senate has become his 
                        mistress. Her demands on him are 
                        boundless.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Men and their ambitions. They 
                        should learn to appreciate the 
                        finer things.

  Ilithyia smiles in agreement, and then notices the necklace 
  Lucretia bought from Ramel.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        That necklace. I adore it.

  Lucretia smiles. Her little fish is taking the shiny bait.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        This? A trinket.

                      It calls to mind a piece I had from 
                        Ramel last season. When emerald was 
                        still the fashion.

  An off-handed comment not meant to insult, but Lucretia 
  feels the sting of a plan gone awry. She covers with a 
  laugh.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        I hear they re coming back  round.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        Oh. Perhaps I ll root mine out, 
                        then.

  A murmur ripples through the crowd. They begin filing out 
  towards the atrium.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Come. The presentation begins.

  She motions Ilithyia ahead. Ilithyia giggles in excitement. 
  Lucretia follows, her gracious smile sliding into a cold 
  look of distaste for the giddy young woman.


  OMITTED



  Ilithyia, Lucretia, and Naevia join the small crowd. 
  Batiatus stands with Crixus by his side.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Friends, old and new! Gratitude for 
                        honoring the storied ludus of 
                        Batiatus with your presence this 
                        eve. Tomorrow promises many glories 
                      in the arena. But tonight...

  Batiatus spreads his arms wide with a grand flourish.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Tonight I present to you the finest 
                        gladiators in all the Republic!

  On cue, Doctore marches the Gladiators out at a brisk pace. 
  They spread out in perfect formation, the sound of their 
  sandals a cacophony of strength and power. Spartacus, Varro, 
  Kerza, Barca, and the rest (except poor Gnaeus). The crowd 
  murmurs their appreciation.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    31.

                        the men you covet! Come! They will 
                        not bite! And if they do, a ten 
                        percent discount!

  The crowd laughs, moving forward to examine the Gladiators 
  up close. Lucretia smiles in appreciation at her husband s 
    salesmanship. He catches the look, his smile broadening. 
  Everything is going according to plan. THE GUESTS

  inspect the Gladiators. Touching their arms, their chests... 
  A knot surrounds Spartacus. He stands rooted, a mighty oak, 
  indifferent to the pecking birds.

  BATIATUS

  moves to Doctore s side.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        The crowd fancies our Thracian, 
                        don t they?

                                          DOCTORE
                        A curiosity, born of his fortune 
                        against Solonius  men.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Better curiosity than indifference! 
                        Perhaps we could fuel this interest 
                        into a conflagration of coin... 
                        With Gnaeus of questionable skull, 
                        what make you of Spartacus as 
                        replacement in our primus?

                                          DOCTORE
                        With respect, the public seeks an 
                        honorable fight. Spartacus is yet 
                        the animal.

                                        BATIATUS
                        One day, then. A contest to be 
                        promoted...

  Ashur hobbles past, sliding up to Crixus.

                                        ASHUR
                        A moment alone. A rarity for a man 
                        with such an adoring public.

  Crixus eye fucks him. Ashur clears his throat, discretely 
  pulling an item wrapped in CLOTH from his robe.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    32.

                                          ASHUR(cont'd)
                      To business, then. A difficult task 
                      on short notice, yet carried to 
                        completion.

  Crixus slips the item into the waist of his subligaria, as a 
  few star-struck, older NOBLEWOMEN approach. Ashur bows 
  politely and limps away, his smile dropping as he hisses 
  under his breath.

                                          ASHUR(cont'd)

                        Cock fucker.

  Lucretia and Ilithyia approach, wine cups in hand. Naevia 
  follows, awkwardly avoiding eye contact with Crixus.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        Your Gaul is of a fine cut, is he 
                        not?

                                        LUCRETIA
                        None finer in all the Republic.

  Lucretia gives him a knowing smile.  Ilithyia moves in for 
  closer inspection, her eyes crawling hungrily over Crixus' 
  chiseled form.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        Such a man...

  Her hand traces the plates of his abdomen.  Lucretia notes 
  the touch, her smile slipping a bit.

                                          ILITHYIA(cont'd)
                        I tremble to see him again in the 
                        arena...

                                        LUCRETIA
                      As do we all.

  Ilithyia freezes, her eyes falling on Spartacus.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        The Thracian yet lives?

                                        LUCRETIA
                        For the moment.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        Hm.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    33.

  Ilithyia smiles politely, yet her demeanor noticeably grows 
  chilly at the news.

                                          ILITHYIA(cont'd)
                      Is there nothing more of interest 
                      at one of these?

                                        LUCRETIA
                      My husband will announce his primus 
                        shortly. And there s ample wine...

                                        ILITHYIA
                        I fear it already beckons my sleep. 
                        Perhaps it best I take my leave.

  Lucretia realizes her prized guest is about to walk out. 
  Wheels turning, an idea strikes.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        There was one more thing I thought 
                        you might enjoy, if you would stay 
                        yet awhile.
                                    mischievously)(
                        Something of a more physical 
                        nature.

  Ilithyia's mood brightens at the possibility.  Lucretia 
  spots Varro, motions to him.

                                          LUCRETIA(cont'd)
                        You. Come with me.

  Surprise and trepidation cross Varro s face. He frowns at 
  Spartacus as he follows Lucretia, WIPING US TO --



  PAN ACROSS Lucretia, Ilithyia and several other PATRONS. 
  Each with a lusty glint in their eyes as they stand watching

  VARRO FUCK A SLAVE GIRL

  from behind in the center of the room. Varro s body glistens 
  with sweat as he thrusts in and out of the young girl.

                                        VARRO
                                  soft, to himself)(
                        Forgive me, Aurelia.

  A FAT CAPUAN MAN reclines nearby, eating cherries from a 
  nearby dish as he plays with himself. Two GAMBLERS watch 
  with coins in hand, wagering on the outcome.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    34.

                        another twenty strokes.

  The other man nods and the two begin ROOTING on their bets. 
  Ilithyia clasps Lucretia s hand, giggling. Wildly turned on 
  by the carnal display before her.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        I've never seen a gladiator fuck 
                        before.... Look at the way he rams 
                        her! Like an enraged bull!

                                        LUCRETIA
                          A gladiator s virtus extends well 
                        beyond the sands of the arena. As 
                        lovers, they are said to be 
                        ravenous beasts. Providing 
                        unimaginable pleasures...

  Varro groans, reaching climax. The room erupts as he 
  dismounts, sweating and out of breath. The Gamblers exchange 
  coins. Ilithyia giggles and claps.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        Can he do it again? Make him do it 
                        again!

  Lucretia smiles. The fish is hooked. She waves to Varro. OFF 
  Varro s grimace as he moves to remount the Slave Girl...



  Batiatus confers with Doctore.

                                        BATIATUS
                      We are in agreement, then. Rabanus 
                        will face Crixus. Move Hamilcar up 
                      to fill the void.

  Varro passes by, exhausted, ushered by a GUARD. He s 
  returned to formation alongside Spartacus.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        You appear winded.

                                        VARRO
                        Domina requested a demonstration of

                        Upon return, I overheard Batiatus 
                        and Doctore in conference. The 
                        primus their intent. The Sardinian 
                      is to face Crixus.

                                          SPARTACUS
                                  darkening)(
                        The news does not balance my cause.

  His eyes fall on Crixus as he strides up with Batiatus.

                                          SPARTACUS(cont'd)
                        Perhaps the scales can be further 
                        tipped.

                                        VARRO
                                  under breath)(
                        Whatever your thoughts, cast them 
                        out. I implore you.

  Batiatus strides up with Crixus, facing the crowd, back 
  turned to Spartacus and Varro.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Good citizens! You ve enjoyed my 
                        wine! My food! The aphrodisiac 
                        presence of my beautiful wife!

  Lucretia, having reappeared with Ilithyia, nods at the 
  compliment.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Now marvel at the announcing of 
                        tomorrow s primus! Crixus, the 
                        Champion of Capua, will stride upon 
                        the sands to face --

  WHAM! Spartacus slams into Crixus like a freight train from 
  behind. The two men tumble to the floor. The crowd gasps.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Spartacus!

  Crixus surges to his feet, but Spartacus  fist connects with 
  his jaw. BLOOD arcs in slow motion. Spartacus swings again, 
  but Crixus blocks the blow and throws Spartacus to the 
  ground. Ilithyia s eyes sparkle, loving the violence.





                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    36.

  CRIXUS

  pounces on top of Spartacus, smashing him in the face. 
  Excitement seizes the guests, several CHEERING and CLAPPING. 
  BLOOD splatters at Ilithyia's feet.  Her eyes light up with 
  blood lust, wishing Spartacus ill.  Doctore waves the Guards 
  to move in.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        No! Let them fight!

  The crowd shouts agreement. Batiatus sees an opportunity, 
  holds a hand up to halt the Guards. Lucretia simmers, 
  furious at the disruption.

  SPARTACUS

  recovers, knocking Crixus back. The wrapped item he got from 
  Ashur dislodges, tumbles onto the floor. Crixus quickly 
  retrieves it. Spartacus uses the distraction to pounce, 
  getting Crixus in a chokehold from behind.  Batiatus has 
  seen enough.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Enough!

  The Guards swarm in, pulling the men apart.

                                        CRIXUS
                        I will have your fucking heart!

                        Come and take it then, coward!

  Crixus bellows, struggling to break free and resume the 
  fight.  Batiatus grins at his Guests, spinning the situation 
  to his favor.

                                        BATIATUS
                        See their hatred, burning beyond 
                        control! This was merely a taste, 
                      to whet your desires!  Tomorrow 
                        they shall settle their grudge in 
                        the arena!  Crixus, the undefeated!  
                        Spartacus, the dog who defies 
                        death!  A fight for the ages! Glory 
                      to Capua!  Glory to Rome!

  Batiatus' speech is like a match to kerosene.  The small 
  crowd erupts in enthusiasm.

  Naevia unclasps Lucretia s necklace as she prepares for bed. 
  Lucretia is far from pleased.

                        The reception nearly ruined by that

                        You heard the crowd. I made the 
                        best of the situation.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        The Thracian has yet to stand a 
                        single match as gladiator. Why leap 
                        him above all others to face 
                        Crixus?

                                        BATIATUS
                        Because he possesses what the rest 
                        lack. The public s interest.

                        And I will make them empty their 
                        purses to do so. Spartacus has 
                        struck a chord. I intend to 
                        maximize its profit.

  Lucretia s anger subsides slightly, concern replacing it.

                      to rules or honor. If something 
                        were to happen to Crixus...

  Batiatus waves the concern aside as he retrieves a cup and a 
  jug of wine.

                        Spartacus poses no threat to the 
                        Champion of Capua. He is but a

                        after a purpose.

  He pours, but only a meager swallow drips from the empty 
  jug.

  Naevia hurries from the room, her toga WIPING US TO --


  OMITTED



  Naevia descends the stairs from the villa to the storage 
  area, separated from the mess hall by a locked gate. She 
  roots around, finally uncovers a dusty jug of wine.

  A SHADOW APPEARS

  on the other side of the gate, unseen behind her. A HAND 
  reaches through the bars. She starts as it touches her arm, 
  whirling around and dropping the jug, shattering it.

  CRIXUS

  steps into the light, his bruised face apologetic. He speaks 
  in a low whisper, she in kind.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Apologies. I did not mean to 
                        startle.

                                        NAEVIA
                        The wine!

  She quickly retrieves the pieces of the jug. Crixus watches 
  her, mesmerized.

                                        CRIXUS
                        When we last spoke, I meant no 
                        offense. I am more practiced with 
                        sword than words.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    39.

                      If domina finds I dropped the last 
                        jug...

                                        CRIXUS
                        Give the pieces here. I ll see them 
                        over the cliff.

  She hesitates, hands them to him. Their fingers touch in the 
    transpiring. She pulls back, turns to go.

                                          CRIXUS(cont'd)
                        Wait.

  She turns back. Crixus pulls the cloth-wrapped item he got 
  from Ashur out of the waist of his subligaria, holds it 
  through the bars. It s now stained with a bit of blood from 
  the run-in with Spartacus.

                                        NAEVIA
                        I do not understand.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Perhaps this gift will explain 
                        where words fail.

  The SOUND OF GUARDS approaching from inside the ludus.

                                          CRIXUS(cont'd)
                        The guards approach. Please.

  She hesitates, takes it. Crixus smiles, melts back into the 
  shadows. Naevia eyes the gift in her hand, tentatively 
  unfolds it, revealing the OPAL NECKLACE she modeled for 
  Lucretia during Ramel s visit.

  TIGHT ON NAEVIA

  surprised by the gift, and its meaning. OFF the moment...



  GUARDS PASS on patrol. Varro, Kerza, Hamilcar, and a few 
  other men wait for the dawn. The mood is somber as the 
  Vulcanalia draws near, each man feeling the heavy weight of 
  his own mortality. Spartacus sits in contemplation, Sura s 
  binding considered between his fingers.

                                        VARRO
                        I m trying to decide.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    40.

                                        VARRO
                        Congratulations or condolences. You 
                        may have bested Crixus once by 
                        tripping him with that bit of 
                        cloth, but to face him in the 
                        arena...

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I believe his reputation inflated. 
                        Tomorrow I shall prove it so.

  Kerza SNORTS.

                                        KERZA
                        Next he ll boast he could defeat 
                        Theokoles himself.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Perhaps. If I knew the man.

  Some of the Gladiators LAUGH. Kerza shakes his head in 
  disbelief.

                                        VARRO
                                  trying to help out)(
                        Theokoles. The Shadow of Death.

  Still means nothing to Spartacus.

                                        KERZA
                      He speaks so brazenly of the arena, 
                        yet knows nothing of its history. 
                        Theokoles is no man, Thracian. No, 
                      he is something else entirely...

  We push past Kerza, the background transforming into --



  The men listen with uneasy reverence.

                                        KERZA
                      My father tells of a munus in which 
                        the Shadow fought over a hundred 
                        men. Not one survived.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        A tale, to frighten children.

                                        VARRO
                        Theokoles is no legend. Before he 
                        retired from the arena, only one 
                        man ever faced him and lived.

                                        KERZA
                        And he breathes among us, his whip 
                        ever at our backs.

  Spartacus  eyes narrow in recognition. Before he can give 
  voice to the name --

                                          DOCTORE (O.S.)
                        Now is not the hour for idle talk.

  They turn to find Doctore on the other side of the cell. The 
  scar creasing his face a grim reminder of the Shadow s 
  wrath.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    42.

                        For some, perhaps the last.

  PUSH IN ON SPARTACUS as the ROAR OF THE CROWD fades up. His 
  steely gaze hardens, ready for battle, the background 
  MORPHS, transitioning us to --



  Spartacus waits in full Thraex gear, helmet and sword in 
  hand. Varro appears behind him, bloodied and bruised, having 
  already fought.

                        They cheer for blood.

                        And they shall have it.

                                        VARRO
                        May the gods bring you fortune, as 
                        they did me this morning.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Sura believed in the gods. And when 
                        the Romans took her, not one 
                        descended from the heavens to 
                        intervene. I shall correct their 
                        mistake presently.

  Spartacus pulls on his helmet, the motion WIPING US TO --



  A bloodied Spartacus stands alone removing his gear, the 
  mirror opposite of the opening scene. He unstraps the 
  greaves from his legs and then pulls off the padded 
  wrapping. During this

  DOCTORE

  appears. Spartacus senses his presence. Doesn t look up, 
  doesn t have to.

                                          SPARTACUS

                        points where you could have seized 
                        advantage.

                        You needed but more training.

  Spartacus locks eyes with Doctore.

                        I shall train harder then.

                                          DOCTORE

                        No. It is too late for such things.

  With that, Doctore turns and exits. A beat as Spartacus 
  digests just how bad he s fucked himself. Then he quietly 
  releases the straps on his manica, revealing

  SURA S BINDING

  covering his forearm. Spartacus unties it. Holds this 
  reminder of his wife in his hands. Knowing that today s 
  failure has placed him even further from the woman he loves.


  BLACKOUT.
