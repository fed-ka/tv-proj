A beautiful college day.  STUDENTS tailgate before a football 
game.  Laughter, music, beer, fun.  

CHUCK, wearing a rumpled 2003 Buy More (slightly different 
font) green shirt uniform.  He s been driving all night and 
day and he sticks out like a sore thumb amongst the carefree 
students.  A deep breath to steel his nerves.  Approaches --

STUDENTS whisper  Hey, that s Chuck.  Dude who got kicked out 
for stealing.    

CHUCK
(overhears)
That s me.  Nice to see you again.  
Didn t cheat though.  Thanks.

Chuck looks at a second story window.  Trying not to call too 
much attention to himself, he picks up a pebble and tosses it 
at the window.  No answer.  He tosses another.  And another.  

CHUCK (CONT D)
(desperate)
Jill, it s Chuck.  Please.  I need 
to talk to you.  I totally get you 
not wanting to talk if you think I 
actually cheated, but I really 
wanted a chance to explain my side 
to you face to face...

The window opens.  A SORORITY GIRL, SHARI, opens it.  

SHARI
(nasally voice)
If Jill wanted to speak to you 
she d have returned one of your 
twenty eight phone calls.

CHUCK
(hates Shari)
Hello, Shari.  Technically it was 
only twenty.  The other times I 
hung up before voice mail picked 
up.  

Shari makes an  uck  sound and closes the window.

Several FRAT guys crowd around.  It s becoming quite a scene.  
Chuck continues to talk to the empty window.

CHUCK (CONT D)
... So, um I was on a break at the 
Buy More...  I took this job, just 
a temporary thing, and drove 346 
miles straight from Burbank to tell 
you I still love you.  So please, 
open your window...

A long beat.  Chuck, defeated, starts to walk away when 
suddenly the window opens.  JILL ROBERTS, 21, glasses, 
pretty, smart in an egghead sort of way, answers. 

JILL
Chuck...

Chuck turns around.  A smile on his face. 

CHUCK
Jill.  Thank god.  I think I ve 
embarrassed myself publicly enough. 
Could we talk over some coffee?

All heads now turn back to Jill again.

JILL
It s over, Chuck.  I m sorry.

CHUCK
When you say over... you mean this 
conversation is over.  To be 
continued at the Starbucks?

Everyone turns to Jill.  Jill s a little heartbroken, doesn t 
know what to say.  Finally Shari pops her head out the 
window.

SHARI
She s dating Bryce Larkin now, 
Chuck.  Deal with it.

CHUCK
(crushed)
It that true?

JILL
I m sorry, Chuck...

Jill gives Chuck one last sad look.  Shuts her window.  The 
frat boy puts the music back on.

Van Morrison s Brown Eyed Girl.  Party resumes.  OFF Chuck, 
taking one last look at Jill before she moves away from the 
window, heartbroken --


A FERRARI SCREECHES around a corner and lurches to a stop, or 
rather a stall, twenty yards in front of the VALET.

Chuck behind the wheel.  Jill shotgun.

CHUCK
Sticky clutch.  Remind me to tell 
my assistant to get it fixed.

Chuck turns the car off.

JILL
I think the valet is up a little 
further.

CHUCK
Beautiful night for a walk.  Shall 
we?

They get out.  The Valet runs towards them.CHUCK - Episode 206 - Zev Borow - Network Draft             16.



Chuck and Jill exit.  Smiling.  Sarah and Casey nod at Chuck 
from the window to get to it. Chuck hands his ticket to the 
Valet. 

JILL
I have to admit I was worried about 
tonight, but I m glad we did it.  

CHUCK
Does this mean I get to see you 
again?

JILL
I d like that.  If I can find any 
time between work.

CHUCK
You know you never told me exactly 
what you re working on.

JILL
I can t talk about it.  I know that 
sounds so mysterious, it s just...
I m starting to think there are 
some shady people involved.  I m 
probably just being paranoid, but I 
just don t know who to trust.

CHUCK
You can trust me.  I promise.

Beat.

JILL
Yeah.  I can.
(deep breath; quickly)
Do you remember BioChem, right?
(Chuck shrugs, sure)

JILL (CONT'D)
We re working a specific strain of 
influenza.  Not to get technical, 
but our focus is on how the 
hemagglutinin protein fuses the 
viral envelope with the vacuole's 
membrane.

CHUCK
Understood completely  Do you 
remember BioChem,  everything after 
that is a little fuzzy.

JILL
Sorry.  I ll try and simplify --

LESTER (O.S.)
Yo, Chuck!

ANGLE ON -- The Nerd Herd Mobile.  Lester and Jeff pull over 
right next to them.  Lean out the window.

JEFF
(whistles)
Who s the babe?  

LESTER
First Sarah.  Now this chiquita 
banana?  When are you gonna start 
sharing the wealth?

Chuck tries to motion for them to leave.  

JILL
Chuck, who s Sarah and how do you 
know these people?

CHUCK
(whispers)
Old Buy More colleagues.  Haven t 
moved on.

The VALET pulls up in the Ferrari.

VALET
Your car, sir.

JEFF
In his dreams...

JILL
This isn t your car, Chuck?

LESTER
He makes eleven dollars an hour at 
the Buy More.  You do the math.

JILL
You still work at a Buy More, 
Chuck?

Jeff and Lester don t move a muscle.  Riveted.  Chuck has no 
choice but to come clean.

CHUCK
(relents)
Yes.  I do.  

JILL
And your computer business?

CHUCK
Technically the Buy More offers a 
variety of hardware --

JILL
Oh my God.  All of this was a lie?  
Everything you said?  I can t 
believe I trusted you.    

Jill races into the street and stops a passing CAB.  She gets 
in.  Chuck races after her.

CHUCK
It s not all a lie!  I never stole 
the tests!  I have a signed letter 
of apology from the Dean!  I ll e-
mail it to you!!

She drives away.  Chuck s crushed.

JEFF
Don t worry playa, we won t say 
nothin  to Blondie.  

Lester and Jeff screech away.  Off Chuck, alone on the street 
watching Jill s car drive off into the distance.

ACT TWO


CLOSE on Morgan, purposeful, focused, locked-in. 

MORGAN
I m going in.  I need between six 
and eight minutes to get in, grab 
the test and get out.  You ready?

Reveal he s talking to Jeff and Lester in a relatively 
secluded corner of the courtyard. 

LESTER
I was born ready.

JEFF
I was born premature. 

MORGAN
Showtime.

Morgan heads to the  Morgan Door.   Jeff and Lester to the 
front door.


DING DONG.  Ellie answers the door, puzzled at the sight of 
Jeff and Lester. 

ELLIE
Sorry, Chuck s not home.

She tries to shut the door.  Lester blocks it.

LESTER
We know.  That s why we re here.  
To talk to you.  About Chuck. CHUCK - Episode 206 - Zev Borow - Network Draft             28.



Back to Ellie talking with Lester and Jeff.

LESTER
Has Chuck been acting a little... 
strange lately?

ELLIE
No... Not more than usual.  Why?

JEFF
We think Chuck might have rabies. 

LESTER
All the signs are there.  Bouts of 
confusion, a general edgy-ness.  
And at lunch Jeff thought he saw 
some foam around his mouth. 

ELLIE
It s very nice that you re 
concerned.  I ll look for signs of 
howling or growing hair.  Bye!

She slams the door.


Sarah KICKS OPEN a door that leads onto the roof.  The roof 
is filled with STEEL air ducts, fans, etc...

She looks around for Rommell.  Sarah s careful.  This guy s a 
professional assassin.  She checks every line of sight... 
careful to make sure he s not able to SNIPER her.  

Now she catches a reflection off a metal grating duct.  For a 
beat she sees ROMMELL hiding.  Sarah turns.  He s off to her 
side.  No shot.  Now she sees his gun go up. Suddenly she 
realizes what he s going to do...

Sarah DIVES and ROLLS for cover just as Rommell FIRES a shot.  
The SHOT is aimed at the METAL siding.  Meant to RICOCHET off 
the crazy angle.  Rommell s aim is true.  The bullet 
RICOCHETS and like a POOL SHOT hits its intended mark...

But Sarah s ducked and rolled below the shot.  Now Sarah 
reverses her ROLL exactly to the point the bullet impacted, 
gets on one knee and FIRES back.

Her shot RICOCHETS and goes back to Rommell.  Hitting him in 
the shoulder.  Sarah quickly rushes over.  Sees Rommell on 
the ground wounded.  Sarah KICKS his gun away.  Stands over 
the defenseless Rommell.

SARAH
CIA!  Hands up!  Now!

ROMMELL
Don t shoot!  
(beat)
I m CIA.  

Rommell s face is no longer assassin hard.  He seems sincere.

SARAH
What are you doing here?

ROMMELL
Like you, following my orders.  
This isn t what you think it is, 
Agent Walker. This mission is more 
complex than you could ever 
imagine.   

SARAH
What are you talking about?

ROMMELL
What we spies always talk about -- 
secrets.  Tell me one: why are you 
in Los Angeles?    

SARAH
Your ID... let me see it.

Sarah keeps her aim on Rommell as he reaches into his pocket.  
He pulls out his badge.  CIA.  

Now he TOSSES it to Sarah, hoping to distract her as he 
reaches for a HIDDEN PIECE.  But Sarah s too quick.  She 
fires.  Kills him.  Sarah now reaches down and picks up the 
badge.  It s REAL.  OFF her --
