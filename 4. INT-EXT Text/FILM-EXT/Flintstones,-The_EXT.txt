looks down at his wristwatch. Well... actually, it's a

Now the foreman turns from his watch to a steam whistle
bird, and yanks its tail. The BIRD SQUAWKS the end of
the workday --

FRED
YABBA DABBA DO -- !
Fred happily discards his hard hat, leaps out of the
canvas-roofed cab on the dino's back, slides down the
tail and bounces right into the seat of his stone and
timber car! He gets up to a running start with the only
motor (his feet), slows to allow a "time clock" dinosaur
to punch his stone timecard, and then he's trotting back
up to speed and out of the gate! MUSIC comes UP and
OVER --
MUSIC (V.O.)
'Flintstones,

in the driveway of his three-bedroom ranch cave. A
moment later, WILMA and PEBBLES run out -- both looking
just like they should -- and get into the car. A beat
behind them are the Flintstone pets, Dino and the
saber-toothed cat.
Fred pauses, looks around... HONKS his HORN... BARNEY,
BETTY and BAM-BAM come out of the neighboring house, hop

Fred and company pull in. He takes a giant sea shell
"speaker" off of its wooden stand and hooks it to his
car door. He leans over, puts his arm around Wilma.
(In the back seat, Dino pops his head up, tearing through
the canvas top.) Dino picks up Pebbles and Bam-Bam and
puts them on his head for a better view. CAMERA ZOOMS IN

AN EERIE CARBONIFEROUS FOREST - DAWN

Dew drips from strange multi-leafed plants. Giant
DRAGONFLIES BUZZ AND HUM to and fro. Bubbles rise from
a still pond, and weird lungfish move onto the land.
(The third one out carries a little suitcase.)
CAMERA PANS PAST the lungfish TO a muddy shore. With a
DRAMATIC MUSICAL STING, we DISCOVER a set of strange,
hideous clawprints. The CAMERA FOLLOWS these, then
WIDENS to reveal the make of these footprints: A seven-
foot tall and fearful beast we will call the Xenosaurus.
It looks around menacingly. (Oddly, it's carrying a
canvas sack, but we don't stress this.)
Suddenly a garbage truck appears out of nowhere and runs
over the Xenosaurus.

NEW ANGLE
7
Dazed, the Xenosaurus gets up. As it does, we realize
that we aren't deep in some primeval forest, but on the
shoulder of a gravel highway. A stone road sign reads
BEDROCK 1/2 MILE. ROCK VEGAS, BABYLON & EDEN NEXT THREE
EXITS. Now, the CAMERA CRANES UP ABOVE the sign and
we see -- Bedrock!

Nestled incongruously in a savage landscape, the charming
protosuburbia gleams in the dawn's early Spielberg light.
The Xenosaurus grabs its sack and some silverware spills
out. Then it runs off into the bushes and out of sight.

WITH THAT GARBAGE TRUCK

It reaches the crest of a hill where there's a "WELCOME
TO BEDROCK" billboard which bears greetings from the
Rotary Club, the Chamber of Commerce, and (of course)
The Loyal Order of Water Buffaloes. The garbage truck
guys drop their feet down through the floorboard and
trot over the rise, coast down to the street below.
The driver yanks a wooden brake and the truck stops, and
the rear guys hop off. One of them waves to --

A MILKMAN

who returns the wave, then takes a four-pack of stone
bottles out of his milk truck, heads towards a doorway.
As the milkman drops off the milk, he passes a big
TORTOISE with trash cans on its back. The Tortoise
nods familiarly to the milkman, then it waddles down the
curb, CAMERA FOLLOWING. The garbage men take the cans
off the Tortoise's back, dump them into the truck.

REAR OF TRUCK

-- revealing
that the back of the truck is actually a
giant-jawed
CREATURE strapped onto the chassis. The

BACK TO SCENE

The garbagemen slam the cans back on the Tortoise, who
winces as they drive off.
TORTOISE
(under his breath)
You can forget about a tip for
Christmas...
It waddles back up the lawn... passing by a wooden "lawn
timer" box which now pops open.
Inside the box is a "ROOSTERSAURUS" which CROWS and flaps
its wings. The motion of the wings knocks loose two
round stones which roll down two long troughs a la Rube
Goldberg...

FOLLOWING THE ROUND STONES
12
They reach the ends of their respective paths, dislodging
a stick... that releases a coiled rope which in turn
spins a turntable which holds a little wooly mammoth. As
it begins to spin around, it squirts water out of its
snout.
Elsewhere on the lawn, other spinning MAMMOTHS repeat
this performance. After a moment, they gradually slow
their revolutions. The one closest to the house
scrunches its trunk with a GROAN.
LITTLE MAMMOTH

Oh, my aching sinuses...

In the neighboring driveway, Wilma and Betty pile the
kids into Betty's car.
BETTY
(wiping their mouths)
Come on, kids. Time for nursery
school.
PEBBLES
'Bye-bye, Daddy.
FRED
'Bye, little sweetheart.
(as Wilma clears
her throat)
'Bye, big sweetheart.
Fred kisses them both and they drive off. Fred sighs,
tries to stretch the canvas roof edges close enough to
stitch. Nearby, Dino struggles to drag the stone news-
paper inside the house. The twin headlines are, of
course, KIBBLE CRISIS GROWS and MYSTERIOUS XENOSAURUS
STRIKES AGAIN.
Suddenly a pink flamingo appears over the hedge. As its
mouth opens and closes, it appears to be talking, but
the voice is that of --
BARNEY
Nice morning, huh, Fred?
FRED
What's nice about it?
BARNEY
Heh, hey. That Arnold's got a
real arm on him, don't he?
Now we see that Barney is holding the flamingo's stiff
legs which he scissors, making the bird's beak trim the
hedge.
FRED
This is the third ragtop this year
... say, shouldn't you be at work?
BARNEY
Ah, well, that appliance store and

BARNEY
Fred, don't start on me again.
I

Ideas --
FRED
Yeah, I know, I know, those
crazy inventions of yours. Be
honest with me, Barn... tell me
one thing you invented that
really caught on.
BARNEY
I invented fire.
FRED
(pause)
You invented fire?
BARNEY
I told you that, Fred. But the
coal conglomerate ripped me off.
The case is still in court, but
meanwhile I got lotsa other
ideas --
FRED
Yeah, but did any one of them
ever put bread on the table? How
long are you and Betty gonna live
on those penny-ante royalties you
get?
Fred pulls his car hood off of its wooden hinges,
examines it with dismay.
FRED
If you ask me, pal, you're just
blowing smoke up your own
volcano...
BARNEY
Maybe, Fred.
But first...
He uses the flamingo's jaws to snatch the car hood
from Fred's surprised grasp.
BARNEY
Let me try some of that smoke on
your car.

Fred and Barney drive along. (Behind them, the same
houses and palms seem to be going by... duplex, palm...
split level, two palms... duplex, palm).
Barney grins, gestures towards the front of the car.
BARNEY
Not bad, eh? After it cures for an
hour or so, it's solid as a rock.
FRED
Okay, you fixed a dented hood. But
you call that a living? Face it,
pal, this is the Stone Age, and it's
a dino eat dino world. You want my
advice?
BARNEY
Did I ever?

FRED
You stick with me today, cruise on
down to the quarry and fill out a
job application. I'm a big man
there, Barney --
BARNEY
You're a big man anywhere, Fred --
FRED
I'm serious, pal. Me and Mr. Slate
are just like this --
He takes his hand off the wheel to hold up two fingers...
ends up swerving instead.
FRED
-- just like that. I know, I know
-- you're not a clock-punching guy
-- but face it, Barney -- it's time
to grow up and put your nose to the
grindstone, batten down the hatches
and join the ratasaurus race with
the rest of us.
(meaningfully)
It's time to retire those dreams.
Barney looks glum, doesn't say anything.
Suddenly Fred
pulls over, stops the car.
FRED
Barney.
Look.

WIDE SHOT
29
They're at the crest of a high wide hill.
BARNEY
Hey.
Lava Lane.
FRED
Remember the old days, Barn? We
used to race our go-carts here to
impress the girls.
BARNEY
(wistful)
Yeah, those were the days... we
usta dream about coming back here
some day with a real car and goin'

A look from one to another, and then down the hill...
Fred gets a malicious grin on his face.

BARNEY
Fred... I thought you said it was
time to retire those old dreams.
FRED
Hey. Since when do I have to be
consistent?
The two pals laugh, and then
with a whoop they begin
pedalling like mad. They go
over the top, gravity takes
over and they are flying past
that billboard with all the
Rotary Club welcomes on it.
But now we see a different
sort of welcome, as a POLICE
CAR ZOOMS out from behind it.
30
POLICE CAR - CLOSER
30
Inside are SERGEANT FELDSPAR and his rookie partner,
OFFICER GRAVEL. Cackling with anticipation, Feldspar
opens a box marked radar detector. Out pops a little
bird in a police helmet. It has a stopwatch (actually,
stop-sundial) around its neck. Feldspar points -- the
bird salutes -- takes off!
31
FRED AND BARNEY
31
BARNEY
(spotting the cops)
Oh-oh! Fred, slow down -- !
Suddenly both Fred and Barney see the RADAR BIRD flying
alongside them. It checks its stopwatch, writes a note
to itself. Fred is so preoccupied he doesn't notice
as --
32
THE POLICE CAR
32
cuts in front of Fred. Fred SLAMS on the "BRAKES," sits
helplessly as Feldspar gets out, walks over, grinning.
FELDSPAR
Well, Flintstone, looks like today's
the day.
FRED
Sergeant Feldspar, I... I wasn't
speeding... honest...
Fred reaches down to the floorboard as he speaks...

There's a box there marked RADAR BUSTER.

FELDSPAR (O.S.)
Forget it, Flintstone. This time
I got you dead to rights --
Fred opens the box. A scary-looking winged reptile
sticks out its head, smacks its hungry lips.
34
BACK TO SCENE
34
Confident, Feldspar jerks a thumb at the Radar Bird,
turns to his rookie partner.
FELDSPAR
Gravel. Get me the radar reading
and I'll show you how we deal with
scofflaws.
Gravel nods, steps towards the bird. The bird checks
its stopwatch... and then it notices the flying lizard
which is hovering nearby, licking its lips.
RADAR BIRD
Whoa!
Wings, do your stuff -- !
The Radar Bird flies away at a hundred miles an hour,
leaving a cloud of dust and the stopwatch behind.
Feldspar catches the watch, startled.
FRED
Well, Sergeant, if you don't have
a radar reading, I guess we'll --
(quickly)

A new cloud of dust appears as Fred ROARS away.
FELDSPAR
Flintstone!
Flintstone, come back

Betty and Wilma
have just pulled up. We notice that next
to their legal
spot, a big limousine is parked in a "no
parking" zone.
But our law-abiding Betty in the next
space now drops
a stone coin in a parking meter.
36
CLOSE ON THE METER

Inside the window we see a LITTLE BIRD. It "bites" the
coin to check it, then turns over an egg timer.

around the corner. (We hear CAR HORNS and SKIDDING TIRES

Wilma and Betty try and hide their laughter.

Clouds of dust rise from behind the fence. We see the
heads of the heavy equipment dinos rising and falling.
A two-story office building is at one end of the site
with a big "Slate Construction Inc." sign on the roof.
CAMERA ADJUSTS as Fred's car turns into the lot, Barney
seated beside Fred. The new green hood gleams in the
morning light.

CLOSER - FRED'S CAR
44
Fred digs his feet into the ground, slams to a halt. He
gets out, surveys the activity. Immediately, the various
workers shout AD LIB greetings. Fred acknowledges these,
beaming in the respect he gets here.
He lovingly dusts off his construction helmet, puts it on,
knocks an offending speck from his parking sign (F.
Flintstone - Shop Steward). He leads Barney towards the
quarry area.
FRED
Barney, you won't regret this --
hiya, Al -- fixing dents in cars
is one thing, a career's another.
Here, you're getting in on the
ground floor of the first footstep
of a new leaf -- hi, Wally, how's
the old backhand? And with a guy
like me ta show you the ropes, you
can skip all the red tape, all the
malarky, all the dino doo --
22.

NEW ANGLE

Fred stands near the weight station booth, where a plump
GIRL in a beehive hairdo sits inside a trailer.
GIRL
(New York accent)
Hi, Mr. Flintstone.
FRED
Hiya, Shirley. This is my very
special neighbor and pal Barney
Rubble. He needs an application
form, okay?
GIRL
Anything for you, Mr. Flintstone.
She slams down two clay tablets and a stylus.
GIRL
Here you go.
(smiling)
Thanks again for the football tickets.
My boyfriend and I both liked them.
FRED
My pleasure, Shirl.
Anytime.
GIRL
Okay. But do you think next time
we could go to the same game?
FRED
(confidently)
No problem.
Fred smiles at her, hands the forms to Barney. Fres steps
towards the quarry, admires the activity, hands on hips,
master of all he surveys. He waves to more friends.
FRED
Well, Barn, what did I tell you?
When you're in with Flintstone,
you're in like Flint.
BARNEY
Gee, Fred. I knew you were a big
shot. I just didn't know how big.
Fred beams at that, and then follows Barney's gaze to
the read-out on the truck scale. Fred is standing on it
and it's pushing 250. With a scowl, Fred grabs Barney's
sleeve and they go into the quarry. As they move, the
CAMERA PANS and CRANES UP TOWARDS the window of the
Slate Construction Office.
CUT TO:

47
Fred and Barney cross the busy lot, sidestepping workers
and animals. Fred does a lot of backslapping, waving.
Barney's filling out the forms on the move. Behind them,
we see the wide access ramp which spirals around the
quarry's sides.
BARNEY

Social Security number...

Hearing a loud SMASH, Fred looks up and sees --

FRED'S POV - A WRECKING BALL OPERATOR

A burly and rough looking guy named PILTDOWN, he grins in-
side his dino-topping cupola, winds his winch handles and
then propels his wrecking ball towards the...
24.
49
QUARRY WALL - ABOVE

-- where the huge stone BALL SMASHES into some walnuts
balanced on a boulder.
50
WIDER
50
Piltdown's compact buddy PYRITE cackles, sweeps
up the
walnuts. Munching them, he balances a new one
in place.
(It should be noted here that the relationship
and physi-
cal appearances of Piltdown and Pyrite mirrors
that of
our heroes... they're sort of an anti-Fred and
Barney.)
PYRITE
Way ta go, Pilty baby. Five bucks
says you can't hit one on the fly.
PILTDOWN
(calling up)
Yer on, Pyrite --
Pyrite tosses a walnut, which bounces on the ledge.
The
wrecking BALL SMASHES into the stone wall.
51
BELOW
51
Workers near Fred duck as dust and debris fall down.
People grab for their construction helmets.
FRED
Not again...
Fred hustles up a ladder to a ramp which leads him up to
the level of Piltdown's cab. Barney hurries to follow.
FRED
All right, Piltdown, that's enough!
You're endangering your fellow
workers!
PILTDOWN
Yeah?
Sez who?
FRED
Says me, Fred Flintstone -- shop
steward of Amalgamated Neolithic
Workers 101.
PILTDOWN
Yeah? Well, A.N.W. one-oh-one gives
us workers a snack break. So...
(a nasty grin)
... I'm breakin' some snacks.
He swings the wrecking ball again.
25.
52
UP ABOVE
52
This time he's overdone it:
The wrecking ball flies past
the walnuts -- Pyrite ducks
for cover -- and then the
wrecking ball whips over and
around the handrail which
runs along here, twisting as
tightly as Indiana Jones'
whip. The handrail wobbles
dangerously in its
foundation --
53
PILTDOWN'S DINO
53
SNORTS, backs up -- the crane SUPPORTS on its back begin
to CREAK and GROAN with the strain --
54
WIDER
54
Workers scatter, fearful of the imminent collapse.
Fred
runs to grab the dino's reins.
FRED
Whoa, whoa, big fella --
He calms the beast by giving it a carrot.
As it munches,
Fred quickly ties the reins to a post.
FRED
(calling up to the cab)
You're on report, Piltdown! If it's
up to me you'll be pushing a
wheelbarrow!
PILTDOWN
(leaping down)
You've been asking for this,
Flintstone... I'm gonna kick your
fat butt --
FRED
Fat butt? Hold me back, Barney --
(sotto, very sincere)
-- Barney, hold me back --
Quickly the men form a circle around Piltdown and Fred.
Barney looks up and sees --

It is shuddering and threatening to come crashing down.

FRED
Yeah.
That's right.
(realizing, a glare
at Barney)
I mean -- this ain't over, Piltdown.
(turning, shouting)
Come on, guys. Let's clean up the
mess.
With much grumbling, ropes and grappling hooks are
gathered and the crew hops to it...
57
62
The executives watch concerned as --
63
THE WRECKING BALL
63
tumbles down, down, knocking scaffolding and ladders
aside, reaches the end of a ramp, and drops through the
air right onto --
64
THE HOOD OF FRED'S CAR
64
-- where, astonishingly, the HOOD sinks in resiliently
like a trampoline and then with a loud "SPROING" the
wrecking ball flies straight back up into the air,
followed a beat behind by the unhinged hood itself.
Both hurtle TOWARDS the CAMERA --
28.
65
SLATE AND EXECUTIVES

react fearfully as they realize all this is coming
straight for them. With a howl, they all dive aside --
66
77
A sign proclaims this as "GRAND BEDROCK LODGE -- LOYAL
ORDER OF WATER BUFFALO." The parking lot outside is full
of vehicles. We hear the sound of a GAVEL BANGING...
HERDMASTER (V.O.)

calls to her husband.
BETTY

He stops, turns. Betty comes over and we see he's wear-

WILMA
Fred! Wait a minute! There's

FRED
("weighing it")
Yeah... it does feel a little
light...
He returns to her, opens the pail, is surprised to find
it's empty. Before he can comment, she smilingly
presents him with a spanking new briefcase. "F.F" is
embossed on it in gold.
WILMA
Fit for a king... my king.
FRED
Aw, Wilma... lookit, it's got
buckles, a strap, a lock --
He opens it.
Inside is a huge drumstick and some ribs.
FRED

Good luck.

Piltdown, this Fibrerock program

to make one more. You've been a
wonderful thug and goon for me.
Now, I'd like to expand your
duties. I want you to become a
provocateur.
PILTDOWN
Gee, Mister Lava, I donno.
I
kinda like girls myself.
LAVA
(patiently)
What I mean, is, I'm going to use
you to double-cross your Lodge and
Union brothers, and make their
lives a living hell.
PILTDOWN
Oh, okay.
LAVA
Good. You and your little pal
will report directly to me and

There're two tiny little desks at the far end, separated

MONTAGE - ASSEMBLY LINE - DAY
106
Now, accompanied by heroic "industrial"-type MUSIC, we
see the Fibrerock assembly line in full operation.
This cannot be described
now with appropriate justice,
but it involves a series
of animal-powered conveyor
belts, Rube Goldberg-like
funnels, spouts and chutes,
and all sorts of gadgets,
gizmos, bells and whistles,
to wit:
(CONTINUED)

106
CONTINUED:
106
At one end of the building, dino-powered dumpsters and
lifters drop off all the ingredients; these get stomped/
chewed/bashed and otherwise reduced to powder, which is
then (courtesy of some squirting Mastodans) mixed with
water into a foam, which bubbles through a long sawmill-
type trough and is held back by a gate.
Meanwhile, we see a sample item (in this case, a stone
sofa) as it is placed before two "goatasauruses" which
butt heads and smash the sofa between the two halves of
a clay mold. When the mold is opened and the sofa tossed
aside, Barney appears and personally "aims" the foam
trough at a funnel in the top of the mold. Pausing to
"taste" the mix, he smiles, then shouts --
BARNEY
Ready... aim... fibre!
Barney pulls a rope which opens the trough.
"Fibrefoam"
pours into the mold.
107
THE CLAY MOLD

gets "winched" unpwards by monkeys, and then an alliga-
torsaurus whaps it with its tail.
108

108
Presto! A Fibrerock copy
of the stone sofa drops neatly
out of the mold, bounces
lightly on the conveyor belt
below! It sparkles with
the tell-tale celadon-green
shimmer of Fibrerock. As
it chugs along, the process
repeats, and soon a score
of identical sofas is in view.
109
END OF ASSEMBLY LINE

as a beaming Fred watches, workers easily stack the
Fibrerock sofas (often one-handed). Nearby, we see
Fibrerock window frames, doors, chairs, etc.

Fred and Barney, weary, approach each other, shake hands
as they view the day's incredible output. Other weary,
but proud workers gather around them: Mr. Slate is about
to address them from his office balcony.
SLATE
Men, this is a proud day for Slate
Construction. You have seen the
first pieces of Fibrerock roll
off the assembly line and into
history... a history you are all
part of... thanks to your very
own fellow worker, Fred Flintstone!

SLATE
No longer will man and beast bend
under the backbreaking load of
stone and rock and timber...
because Fibrerock is so light
that even a child can handle it.

That's why on Monday we're going
to hire two dozen children from
Bedrock Technical Junior High.
They'll be replacing the 36
heavy equipment operators, 15
shaft diggers and 22 laborers
we're laying off today. Your
pink slips will be in your final
pay envelopes along with a ticket
to the grand opening of Slate
City. It's non-transferable,
so hang on to it. Thank you, and
have a nice weekend.

Fibre foam. And tonight's batch,
well... I didn't get much of it,
but it seems a little off.

Can't fool the old taste buds,

an ingredient missing. So

Maybe you could move those plants
to block them out...?

Good idea. Rodney, get 'hoppin'

The aide nods, gathers some workers. They start moving
the potted plants. Puzzled, Wilma comes over.

'typical evening' at the
Flintstones, and you invited fifty
people I don't even know. Now
what's going on? Where are they

It's the Rubble yard, Wilma.

the country club, we're gonna play
poker, yeah, big stakes poker
until everybody comes back. Go on
with the others. The kids got
their show to put on anyway... and
I wouldn't want people to think...
to think the Flintstones were
party poopers.
She doesn't know what to say, or what she can say that
won't shatter his shaky image. She sighs, kisses him,
then calls out.
WILMA
Come on, Pebbles. We're going to
another party.
PEBBLES
Will there be real food there?
WILMA
We'll find out together.
She takes the girl's hand and goes to the door, where the
last of Leach's crew is just going out. Suddenly Betty
catches up to her, Bam-Bam in tow.
BETTY
Wilma, wait.
I'm going with you.
WILMA
Why?
BETTY
If friends can't do something
stupid, who can?
Wilma smiles, touched.
BETTY
Besides...
(lowering her voice)
... Maybe if we leave the boys
alone...?
Wilma nods, hopeful.
198
198
The film crew caravan
is already leaving as Wilma, Betty
and the kids get into
the Rubble car. The last TV crew-
man extinguishes the
big spotlight. The house is dark,
forlorn in the fading
twilight.
90.
199
REAR OF YARD - NIGHT
199
Fred sits forlorn in the rubble of his party.
Dino comes
over, nuzzles his leg.
FRED
Just you and me now, Dino. Yeah.
That's okay. Man and man's best
friend.
He gives Dino one of the canapes. Dino tastes it, makes
a face, spits it out. DINO runs off, going "PTOOIE" all
the way. We see him run to the corner, jump in Betty's
car and drive away.
200
FRED
200
sighs, looks around, down at his blazer and the "FVF"
patch. He suddenly rips it off in a fury. Then he looks
at --
201
THE WALL IN FRONT OF BARNEY'S PROPERTY
201
202
BACK TO SCENE
202
Fred stares at it, his face slowly darkening. Then he
grabs a lawn chair from the yard, begins to smash it in
a fury against the divider. The wall cracks, splinters;
the potted plants go flying.
203
FRED
203
His anger spent, he stands panting, splattered with
dirt... then he sees --
204
NEW ANGLE - ANOTHER DIRT-COVERED FIGURE
204
-- standing in the ruins of the wall. The figure
sneezes, whacks dirt off of itself. It's --
FRED
(disbelieving)
B... Barney?
BARNEY
(moving closer)
Hiya, Fred.
(noticing his ruined
tuxedo)
Boy, the rental place is gonna
be mad...
(eyeing the mess)
... You feeling better, pal?
(CONTINUED)
91.
204
CONTINUED:
204
FRED
'Pal'? How can you call me that?
Barney, I... I've been such a...
such a... such a...
BARNEY
Creep?
FRED
Well, yeah.
But more of a --
BARNEY
(helpful tone)
Fool?
FRED
Well --
BARNEY
Slimeball? Louse? Jackass?
(snapping fingers)
Stuck-up blimpasaurus?
FRED
(wincing, but
taking it)
Barney... can... can you ever
forgive me for being such a jerk?
BARNEY
(stepping closer)
Sure, Fred.
(smiling)
I've had lots of practice.
FRED
(touched)
Aw, Barn...
And he grabs Barney in a big bear hug. Tears in both
their eyes, they slap each other on the back, two
prehistoric sensitive guys.

FIBRESPHERE & SLATE NEEDLE - NIGHT
205
Little cupola cars are chugging around the upper level
of the Fibresphere, where they enter a tunnel-like open-
ing labeled "THE WORLD OF FIBRE."
Wilma, Betty, the kids and Dino are in one of these.
Now, we FOLLOW them as they chug into --
92.
206
THE FIBRESPHERE "WORLD OF FIBRE" RIDE
206
The cupolas rattle along in Disneyland style, passing a
sign which reads: "FIBREROCK--TRANSFORMING THE HOME."
Here, mechanical figures in an all-Fibre home move
klutzily around the room.
RECORDING (V.O.)
(a la 'The Great
Gildersleeve')
Welcome! Welcome to the fabulous
world of tomorrow... a world
brought to you by Fibrerock!
207
REVERSE ANGLE
207
REVEALING that behind the hollow shells of the human
family is a veritable family of monkeys, all working the
figures like puppets. A PARROT at a stand-mounted
microphone is giving the narration.
PARROT (RECORDING) (V.O.)
Here, we see a typical family of
the future, free of the cares and
worries of today... yes, the great
kibble crisis is a thing of the
past when you're living the good
life... the Fibrelife!
208
NEXT EXHIBIT
208
The CARS CHUG past a display of tree trunks, leaves,
bubbling gunk... and those iridescent vegetable pearls
we've come to know... coo-coo berries. Iron bars and
vault-like doors separate the coo-coo berries from the
other items.
ANOTHER PARROT
Here, gathered from the four
corners of the globe, are the
secret ingredients of Fibrerock...
some common, some rare... all
making life easier for you and
yours!
209
THIRD EXHIBIT
209
The little CARS CHUG into an elegant salon, complete with
runway. There's another PARROT here in front of another
megaphone, but this parrot is chic and flamboyant.
FASHION PARROT
But does Fibrerock belong only in
the kitchen, the garage, the
workplace? No, no, no, my
darlings!
93.
210
FASHION MODELS ON RUNWAY
210
As each girl struts forward, she shrugs off a bulky
animal fur and tosses it into a garbage can. Underneath
are all kinds of daring and tantalizing fashions woven
in the tell-tale fibre colors. The clothes are a blend
of the future and retro (that is, prehistoric retro).
FASHION PARROT
Because the clothes of the Stone
Age are as extinct as stones
themselves! Yes, thanks to the
wonder of Fibrerockfibre, the world
of high fashion will be totally
transformed... by Fibre furs...
Fibre frocks... Fibre foundations
and Fibreshoes... it's to die
for!
211
FOURTH EXHIBIT
211
Now, we see a display of Fibrerock props of all kinds --
appliances, toys, tools, etc... all of it upstaged by a
choir consisting of every animal, bird and critter we've
seen in this film. Wilma, Betty, the kids and Dino ooh
and ahh with the other guests as the mechanical animals
all sing in unison --
FIBRE CHOIR (V.O.)
'It's a Fibre World you know,
It's a Fibre World you know,
It's a Fibre World you know -- '
CUT TO:
212
223
It careens around even more wildly now.
There's several
near collisions.
CUT TO:
224
224
"Rockdonald's" is, of course, complete with golden arches
of stone, a drive-up window, etc. It even has the oblig-
atory cops on a break... in this case, Feldspar and
Gravel. They're sitting in their patrol car eating from
little bamboo containers shaped just like McDonald's
Styrofoam. (Of course, the logo on the building behind
them proudly reads "OVER 100 SOLD.")
FELDSPAR
(mouth full, bitching)
Speed traps again! Face it,
Gravel. I'm in a rut... and
meanwhile, the guys who went
through the academy with me,
they're all big shots now:
Sam Slate... Dirty Harock...
Magma, P.I. And you know why?
'Cause they got the breaks,
that's why!
Suddenly both officers react to the sound of SKIDDING
TIRES and HONKING HORNS. They look out their window
at --
225
FRED AND BARNEY - DRIVING PAST
225
both still battling the wheel and the resistant costume
head. (By now their gyrations have put Barney's face
inside the jaws of the monster mask.)
101.
226
BACK TO SCENE
226
GRAVEL
S-sarge, d-did you see that? Some
sorta creature was attacking that
little guy -- !
FELDSPAR
There's a lesson there, Gravel...
never pick up hitchhikers.
Besides --
(realizing)
-- Did you say 'creature'?
They do a big double-take at the now-vanishing car.
FELDSPAR & GRAVEL
The xenosaurus!
Excited, Feldspar bangs his dashboard and a DISPATCH
PARAKEET in a police uniform pops INTO VIEW. Feldspar
grabs it around the neck, holds it like a microphone.
FELDSPAR
This is a xenosaurus alert.
Repeat, a xenosaurus alert. The
creature has been sighted on the
Slate City exit of the Venturock
Freeway! It is driving a brown
late model sedan and eating a
white male Caucasian. Car twelve
is in hot pursuit.
He releases the bird, which doesn't fly away right away,
but gives him a look.
FELDSPAR
(remembering)
Oh, yeay... over and out!
The bird nods, appeased, flies off.
DISPATCH PARAKEET
(as it goes)
Awwk! Car Twelve is on the way.
Car Twelve is on the way...
FELDSPAR
(thrilled)
Gravel, this could mean promotions
for both of us!
(trotting up to
speed)
Load the shotgun and turn on the
siren!
102.
227
FRED'S CAR - TRAVELLING
227
Barney is rocking Fred's head back and forth, finally
gives it one last mighty yank. Something breaks.
Barney falls back on the passenger side of the car.
Fred drives with one hand, "raps" the monster head.
It rattles. When Fred speaks again, the monster mouth
no longer opens and closes in sync.
FRED
(muffled, shouting)
Ho, gweat! Hoo bwoke hit,
Bahnee! Hi khnat twalk hennymore!
Suddenly both men (pardon, man and xenosaurus) react to
an approaching SIREN. They both look back at --
228
FELSPAR'S PATROL CAR
228
Closing in. Gravel has produced a little sabre tooth
CAT and is "cranking" its tail. As it WAILS away, the
cops close in on our heroes.
229
BACK TO SCENE
229
FRED
Ho noh! Ahhrisser Felghspah!
(turning to Barney)
Haybee whee hould shtop -- ?
BARNEY
What, and explain what you're
doing in that costume? Start
talking about coo-coo berries and
Fibrerock? By then it'll be too
late!
FRED
'Hen yore height, yore height...
Fred pours on more speed. They careen around a turn.
CAMERA WHIP PANS TO a road sign: SLATE CITY--1 MI.
230
SLATE CITY - REAR GATE
230
A fence surrounds the empty housing development; in the
distance, we can see the dark Slate Scrapers, and past
them, the brightly-lit and gleaming Fibersphere and
Slate Needle.
We hear a SCREECH and then the CAMERA PANS BACK to pickup
Fred's CAR as it whips around a turn, two wheels off the
ground. It crashes right into the gate, knocking down a
sign reading "SLATE CITY--DELIVERY GATE." The fence
collapses all around the car.
103.
231
NEW ANGLE
231
Fred and Barney stagger out of the wreck. Barney,
covered with debris, rummages around and sighs with
relief when he finds the flit gun of coo-coo sap is
still intact.
BARNEY
(hearing a siren)
We'd better split up; that way at
least one of us can make it to the
Slate Needle -- !
FRED
'Ood hidea.
Ood whuk, ol' bhudee.
They slap hands together like basketball players, then
head off in two directions.
CUT TO:
232
245
The supporting pylons and cable anchors begin to slowly
decompose. A FLIGHT of STAIRS CREAKS AND GROANS.
Barney runs INTO the SHOT, sees the steps about to go,
dives for them... too late! He ends up with a face full
of Fibredust! Now, he whirls as Fred runs up, points --
FRED
Barney!
The elevator -- !
Barney runs toward it, hits the button.
246
OTHER SIDE OF WALL
246
REVEALING elevator mechanism. The button pokes a mouse
which runs out of a box. Seeing the mouse, a nearby
mastadon becomes frightened, begins running. A heavy
cable tied to the mastadon runs over a pulley and into --
247
THE ELEVATOR SHAFT
247
-- where the elevator rises out of the sub-level and
INTO VIEW! Fred and Barny start towards it... when
suddenly the Fibrerock elevator begins to crumble!
FRED
Quick!
Use your coo-coo gun -- !
Barney aims, pulls back the plunger... too late! The
elevator is gone. The cable swings back and forth
loosely, "whapping" the shaft walls as it shoots upwards.
Fred dives for the cable, misses! As he stumbles, Barney
leaps on Fred's back, catches the cable! As Barney
starts to whizz upwards, Fred garbs onto his ankles!
248
ABOVE - FIBRESPHERE
248
Propelled upwards, the would-be rescuers shoot OUT of
the FRAME, disappear into the Fibresphere with a CRASH!
CUT TO:
249
255
Rescue VEHICLES and police CARS ROAR up, slam to a halt,
CAT SIRENS WAILING. The rescue workers jump out.
Firefighters carry circular trampolines of hide stitched
to bamboo frames; others go to the back of their trucks
and start to turn cranks on the hook and ladder trucks to
raise the ladders.
256
CLOSE ON A HOOK AND LADDER TRUCK
256
It's actually a wheeled carriage carrying a firesaurus,
which is a critter with a very tiny body and an incred-
ibly long neck. The bony plates on the creature's back
make perfect stairs.
However, the creature is noticeably listless and
uncooperative.
FIRE CHIEF
Come on, come on, what's the hold
up -- ?
FIREFIGHTER
It's the kibble crisis, sir --
the firesauruses have been on
half-rations for a month!
Above them, the BUILDING SHUDDERS again.
112.
257
IN THE SLATE NEEDLE
257
Now, the remaining LIGHT FIXTURES CRASH down. When they
hit the floor, the oil lamps inside spills and fire
spreads.
WILMA
(pointing)
Fred!
There's a fire hose -- !
Indeed, it's on the back wall in a closed box marked FIRE
HOSE--IN CASE OF EMERGENCY BREAK GLASS. Fred and Barney
take a step towards it, but the fire quickly spreads and
cuts them off.
Helpless, they step back.
With a THUNDEROUS ROAR, the two SLATE SCRAPERS visible
through what's left of the picture window COLLAPSE. Then
the big statue of Slate just outside the window begins to
decompose. It falls in on itself like a sand sculpture
in a storm... finally, for a split second it is, well,
life-sized, and then the head of the statue snaps loose,
CRASHES through the only remaining pane of GLASS here
... rolls up to Slate's feet.
Pause. Everyone looks at everyone else. This is it:
Titanic time. Fred embraces Wilma... Barney embraces
Betty. Their kids are pulled into the clinch. Even
Slate takes Mrs. Slate's hand. Talk about grace under
pressure... and speaking of --
258
GRACE
258
-- the star fashion model, suddenly her Fibrethread
costume decomposes, leaving her in her cute little
animal print undies.
259
BETTY
259
In the middle of going down with the ship, she turns
Bam-Bam's face away from this display.
BAM-BAM
D-dad, are we gonna be okay?
BARNEY
(pause; false smile)
Sure, pal. We just gotta wait for
the fire department. Right, Fred?
FRED
Y-yeah. Everything's gonna be
just -- Whoa, hoo-hah, aggh --
(CONTINUED)
113.
259
CONTINUED:
259
He's started yelping because he's realized his arm
is
on fire, and now he jumps up and the others begin
beating
at the arm with anything in their hands, and then
Fred
suddenly pushes away from them, stands there with
a small
flame flickering on his forearm like a Rock Vegas
stage
magician.
FRED
-- Wait a minute -- I don't feel
anything at all --
With his other "claw" he slaps tentatively at the flames,
and then confidentially snuffs it out.
BARNEY
It must be the suit, Fred -- old
Bedrock High built them things to
last --
Fred looks over at the wall of flame separating the
guests from the fire hose. As everyone gets the same
idea, Dino rushes up, the costume head in his mouth.
All brighten.
Barney helps Fred with the head, twists it into place.
BARNEY
(rapping on the head)
-- Okay?
FRED
Hist hust fine!
He lowers his head, runs through the fire, which licks
at him harmlessly. Then with his claw, he SMASHES the
amber GLASS --
260
IN THE BOX
260
A big PYTHONSAURUS is curled up inside,
SNORING. (Note
to herpetologists: The pythonosaurus is
not quite a
snake: it has little vestigial forepaws
the better to
emote with. Right now the snoring head
is in those
little paws.)
The Pythonsaurus stirs, looks at Fred, "sniffs" the
smoke. Then he raises one hand and finger as if to say
"one moment." Then the pythonsaurus turns his head
towards a nozzle like the ones in hamster cages, slurps
loudly.
We hear gallons and gallons of WATER GURGLING away...
114.
261
IN THE MAIN ROOM
261
Everyone retreats from the fire. Slate picks up the head
of the statue, his only souvenir.
262
WITH FRED
262
Waiting impatiently until the pythonsaurus finally
finishes drinking. It wipes its mouth daintily with a
napkin, slaps a little fire helmet on its head, turns
and runs back into the other room. (Behind him, yards
and yards of pythonsaurus unroll from a hidden compart-
ment behind the box.) Water shoots out of the creature's
mouth.
263
WIDER
263
Fred turns in a semi-circle and puts out every lick of
flame in the room. All the guests cheer, rush forward
and slap Fred on the back. Pebbles jumps up on him and
kisses him.
FRED
Hit fuzz nudding... wheely...
The pythonsaurus looks around at the attention.
PYTHONSAURUS
Hey, what am I, chopped liver?
BARNEY
Come on, everybody -- we'll go
out the way we came!
Barney squirts a pathway with his flit gun, solidifying
a route in the crumbling Fibrerock. Then Barney and
Fred stand back nobly, wave everyone on into the adjacent
Fibresphere.
POINDEXTER
(pushing and shoving)
Outta the way -- outta the way --
women and children first -- ! I
mean, ah, children and women
first, yeah, yeah, provided that
uh, there's room for the women...
Meanwhile, the pythonsaurus gives Fred (or rather his
costume) a big look up and down, looks TOWARD the CAMERA.
PYTHONSAURUS
Hey, not bad.
Wonder if she lives
around here.
Just then Fred tilts back the monster head.
The
pythonsaurus reacts.
(CONTINUED)
115.
263
CONTINUED:
263
PYTHONSAURUS
Heartbreaker!
Depressed, the pythonsaurus follows the others. Fred and
Barney cross over into the Fibresphere. As the do, Slate
Needle completely collapses.
264
264
The Slate Needle tumbles down, taking a big chunk of the
Fibresphere with it! But the rest of the huge globe
stays put... for now.

Already the first partygoers are sliding down the
elevator cable.

Barney gives the dwindling circle of solid Fibre around
the group another shot of coo-coo juice. Poindexter Lava
pushes his way forward.
POINDEXTER

Fifty clams for a piggy-back ride

LAVA
(proudly)
Yeah. Real chip off the old

Embarrassed, Mrs. Slate grabs the kid by the neck,
practically throws him at the cable. She follows him
down, followed by Lava and Mr. Slate.
269
REAR OF FLEEING PEOPLE
269
Fred and Barney have bravely held up the rear, their
families clutching to them. Barney's carrying Bam-Bam.
FRED
(to Pebbles)
Upsy-daisy, sweetheart -- piggy
back time!
She jumps on his back... slamming the monster head
back in place.
FRED
(resigned)
Hohh... GWEAT!
BARNEY
(to Betty)
Go on, honey... I got Bam-Bam!
BETTY
Barney... tonight you're the
biggest man in Bedrock.
She kisses him, slides down.

Backlit romantically by the flames, just like Gable and
Leigh when Atlanta burned.

BACK UPSTAIRS
272
FRED
Lhet's dogh it!
Their kids on their backs, Fred and Barney exchange a
heroic forearm-to-forearm gladiator-type handshake...
both put their hands on the cable... and then the whole
pulley mechanism falls right down between them and
through the hole! A second later, the entire remaining
structure collapses!
273
BELOW
273
Everyone reacts in horror --
274
ABOVE
274
Dust and smoke clear. When we can see again, well, it's
not a pretty sight. The entire fibresphere is gone. All
that's left, teetering on two spindly supports, are two
tiny islands of safety connected by a twisted maze of
rubble too small for a human to negotiate... and all
that's holding that up is a long guide wire leading to the
ground!
275
CLOSER
275
Figures on one of the islands stir: Fred. Barney.
Bam-Bam... Pebbles! The platform shudders again. Barney
aims the flit gun -- empty! The dads hold on to the
kids. It's all they can do.
276
BELOW
276
Wilma and Betty gasp... what can be done?
277
THE SECOND ISLAND
277
Bricks and chunks of Fibre stir... a form sits up...
it's -- Dino! He looks around at the situation, becomes
agitated... he wants to help... but how?
118.
278
WILMA AND BETTY
278
Suddenly become inspired.
BETTY
W-wilma... those hoops of bamboo...
those wires... do you think -- ?
WILMA
Yes! Yes! Betty, we have to try
it -- ! Dino! Dino, look down
here -- !
279
DINO
279
Obeys, puzzled --
280
HIS POV - WILMA AND BETTY
280
Amazingly, they grab scraps of wood, borrow fire
fighter's helmets, and begin to do a buck and wing.
WILMA
AND
BETTY
You can keep

the frug and
hop
I don't need

I don't need

BIG CAMERA PUSH - DINO

MUSIC COMES UP DRAMATICALLY as he catches on! His eyes
fill with courage and he charges toward the spindly
bridge that leads to his master and friends.
282
ANOTHER ANGLE
282
Dino dives through the hoops of bamboo, duplicating his
steps in "The Dino Dance." He reaches the other island!
Without a beat, still keeping time, he puts the two kids
on his shoulders, just like in the dance! Then he
"presents" his tail to Fred -- Fred hands his tail to
Barney -- and then --
283
LONG SHOT
283
-- Dino slides down the long wire, carrying everyone to
safety! They all plow into the biggest rescue net as
Wilma and Betty wind up!
WILMA AND BETTY
Yes, I don't need to shimmy,
I don't need to bop
'Cause I'm doin', doin', doin'
THE IGNEOUS ROCK!
119.
284
FRED
284
rolls out of the net and away from the others. He's
slightly stunned, still in the suit. He sits up...
suddenly lights snap on all around him! Fred looks up
and sees --
285
HIS POV - CORDON OF POLICE OFFICERS
285
All with weapons aimed right at him. Spotlights on the
police car roofs (actually little fires with parabolic
mirrors) are operated by uniformed monkeys.
Feldspar is at the head of the group. He cocks his
shotgun. The elastic catapults at the hammers twitch
menacingly --
FELDSPAR
It's the xenosaurus -- stand back,
men -- it's a vicious killer --
Ready -- Aim --
FRED
(with desperate poignancy)
High ham noght a zenosore! High
ham hay hooman beeng -- !
BAM! WHAM! KABAM! Bullets and projectiles begin
slamming all around Fred! He ducks behind a big fallen
chunk of Fibrerock -- catches his breath as the bullets
and shells bounce off its resilient surface.
286
CLOSE - FRED
286
Momentarily safe, he tries desperately to remove that
stupid head -- bangs it against the wall, tears at it
with his claws --
-- meanwhile, the chunk of Fibrerock protecting him
decomposes! He's back in the line of fire!
287
DINO
287
Flanked by Wilma, Barney and the kids, who are shouting
for the police to stop, only Dino the wonder bronto has
the wits to act!
"YI-YI-YI-ING," he races forward, CAMERA FOLLOWING --
and with lightning reflexes grabs the seat of Fred's
monster suit and -- de-pants him!
Instantly, Dino whirls Fred around, points to the now
revealed striped undershorts.
288
WIDER

Pause.

Then Officer Gravel takes a good look at that rear end.
GRAVEL
Hey, those are the biggest shorts
I've ever seen...
(realizing)
... It... it must be Mister
Flintstone! Cease fire!
(to Feldspar)
Gee, Sarge, now you don't have
to shoot him -- !
Now Fred confirms Gravel's hunch as the costume head
finally pops off. All the cops lower their guns.
(Strangely, though, Feldspar still continues to raise
his gun -- even aims! Then an alarmed Gravel wrestles
it away from his superior.)
289
THE FLINTSTONES AND RUBBLES - DAWN
289
Safe, they all emotionally embrace. Fred even suffers
Dino's affection. (In the b.g., a police car holding
Piltdown, Pyrite and Lava drives past. Poindexter Lava
is chasing the car.)
POINDEXTER
(distant)
Dad! Dad! Can I use the
Porscherock while you're in the
slammer?
Suddenly the Slates push their way into the group hug.
SLATE
Flintstone. Rubble. I... I
don't know what to say. I... I
treated you horribly... I ignored
you, abused you... and then you
come here and risk your necks like
this... well, there's no price you
can put on something like that,
so I won't even try. But let me
give you...
(with great
poignancy)
... a hearty handshake.
MRS. SLATE
Dear, don't you think a little
more than that is in order?
SLATE
Honey, you're being hysterical,
go lie down, okay?

MRS. SLATE
I am not being hysterical, I am
being fair -- now the Flintsteins
and Rabbles saved all of our
lives, not to mention your
reputation.
SLATE
(sighing)
Okay, okay.
(to Fred and Barney)
Boys, I'm feeling guilty about
how you've been taken advantage
of, so I'll tell you what... I'm
going to give you back all
world-wide rights to Fibrerock,
free and clear.
He picks up a fragment of stone, begins writing on it.
SLATE
Your only obligation will be to
cover oh, whatever legal expenses
might surface at some later time...
BARNEY
You think there's gonna be some?
Slate looks around at --

HIS POV - THE RUINS AND DESTRUCTION
290
Smoking desolation as far as the eye and CAMERA can see.
As we watch the last remaining fragment of Slate City
collapse, crushing a police car.

BACK TO SCENE
291
SLATE
(casually)
Oh, you never know...
292
RESCUE DINOS
292
Several sniff at the air, look curiously at a nearby
pile of crumbled Fibrerock. One and then another
shuffles over, tentatively tastes some... grins... and
digs in! Seeing this, the "firesauruses" crane out
their necks, also begin chowing down on the pile of
Fibrerock crumbs.
293
FRED, BARNEY, SLATE AND OTHERS
293
All turn at the growing sound of the ANIMALS PIGGING OUT.
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

Now DINO "YI-YI-YI'S" past this group and leaps into the
pile, munching like crazy.
Barney puts out his hand as chunks of Fibrerock shower
down like rain from the feeding frenzy. Catching some
pieces, he nibbles on it a little.
FRED
Barn...?
What's going on?
BARNEY
(sniffing it)
Lava Lava leaves... Woca sap...
all still there, but now the
nutrients are all released...
(realizing)
... Fred, this... this is Dino
kibble!
FRED
Dino kibble...?
Disbelieving, Fred moves over to the happily-munching
animals. He has to get on his knees to wiggle in with
the pack. He grabs some, stuffs it in his mouth...
chews. His eyes widen...
FRED
(mouth full)
Dhinough khibble!!
He spits it out, takes out the chunk of contract
Slate wrote on.
FRED
Barney, we -- we're rich!
Yabba dabba do -- !
294
SLATE
294
Faints dead away!
The CAMERA PULLS BACK... BACK...
BACK --
295
295
We're back where we began. As "The End" appears on the
drive-in screen, cars are streaming out of the drive-in
theatre. The Flintstone car is among them.
296
296
Fred and company roll into a '50's-style drive-in
restaurant. A sign advertises BRONTO BURGERS AND RIBS.
(CONTINUED)

A pretty carhop on stone roller skates glides over.
Fred holds up one finger towards her. She nods, scampers
O.S. Fred rubs his hands and licks his lips with antici-
pation... and then the girl returns with a massive rack
of ribs on a car tray. She hooks it on the edge of
the driver's door... and the entire car tips over with a
crash.
CUT TO:
297
297
WIDEN FROM the mailbox. Fred and family pull up. Dino
runs in first, followed by Wilma with Pebbles already
asleep on her shoulder. Fred follows, the saber-tooth
cat on his heels. Fred stops in the doorway to put a
milk bottle on the doorstep, and then puts the cat down
beside it. He shuts the door.
Quick as a flash, the cat leaps through the side window.
Pause. The door opens and the cat puts Fred out, then
slams the door! Fred recovers from his shock, tries the
door... it's locked!
MUSIC (V.O.)
We'll have a yabba
dabba-do time
A dabba-do time
We'll have a gay old time!
FRED
(knocking)
Wilma...?
(another knock)
... Wilma?
CAMERA CRANES UP, WIDENS as Fred becomes a tiny sil-
houette banging on the door.
FRED
Wilma?
Wil-ma --!
FADE OUT.
