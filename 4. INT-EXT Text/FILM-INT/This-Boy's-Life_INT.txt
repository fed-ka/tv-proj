Two people are in the straining car -- a woman and her
son. The woman is CAROLINE WOLFF. Somewhere in her 30s,
she is a pretty woman who can look beautiful if she works
at it. (Just now, though, her prettiness is marred by a
fading bruise on her right cheekbone.) She is bright and
energetic and lively. Even more important than these
qualities, though, is her humor. And most important of
all is a sensual quality she exudes. Her sensuality is
effortless -- as natural to her as the color of her eyes
and hair. Men turn on the street to stare at her.
The boy is TOBY WOLFF. A
pleasant-faced boy with won-
derful eyes, he is 13 --
teetering on the brink of
adolescence, so that one
moment he seems like a self-
assured teenager, and the
very next like a ten-year-old
kid.
Just now the ten-year-old kid has the upper hand: bored
and weary with the long trip, Toby has been arguing with
Caroline, who is ignoring him.
TOBY
... Well,
I mean it. I'm serious
-- I do.
You promise and promise,
and then
you change your mind,
just like
that.
CAROLINE
(totally oblivious)
... Uh-huh.
TOBY
You wait 'til you ask me for
something. Just wait. See if you
get it.

CAROLINE
(as above)
Toby, hush. Let me just...
So concentrated on her driving she doesn't even finish
her sentence, she nurses the car upward. Finally the car
crests the hill and starts down. Caroline sighs with
relief. She turns to Toby with a smile.
CAROLINE
What'd you say?
TOBY
I said -- for the twentieth time
-- if a person promises somebody
something, they can't just turn
around and take it back.
CAROLINE
Oh, honey, Jesus. Don't start
with that again.
TOBY
Why not?
CAROLINE
Because I'm the mother, and I
get to tell you what to do every
minute of your life 'til you're
eighteen. Seriously, we've got no
money. I can't buy you the
moccasins.
TOBY
I bet if you'd promised Roy some
moccasins he'd of got 'em.
CAROLINE
No talk about Roy, okay? And ditto
the moccasins. We, can't, afford,
them.
TOBY
Yeah, but you did promise...
CAROLINE
Sue me. Take me to court. Oh,
Toby, I know you're disappointed,
but...
TOBY
Jack.
Call me Jack.

CAROLINE
You're going to drive me to an
early grave: I'm never going to
make Salt Lake City.
TOBY
Seriously. If a person can't get
a stinking miserable pair of
moccasins, at least he ought to be
able to choose his own name...
(loud)
... and I wanna be called Jack!
CAROLINE
Fine.
And you can call me...
(she thinks)
... Jeanette. Jeanette Marie.
TOBY
Oh, you're so stupid sometimes,
I...
The BAWLING of an AIRHORN interrupts him. Both of them
look through the back window and see a huge tractor-
trailer truck, out of control, bearing down on them.
Caroline brakes and steers a hard right, SKIDDING the
NASH safely onto the side of the road.
The truck, its HORN BLASTING steadily, shimmies and
slides past them, and then, hideously, fails to make the
next curve: it smashes through the guard rails and into
empty space, its HORN still BLARING.
Caroline and Toby look at each other, then scramble out
of the car.

Toby (feet up on the dashboard wearing a brand-new pair
of Indian moccasins) and Caroline sing "Mood Indigo"
together. Toby holds
a complicated-looking, black con-
traption which looks something like an antique flashlight.
TOBY
How's this thing work, anyway?
CAROLINE
(not confident)
It makes a black light that, uh,
causes uranium traces to glow.
TOBY
And we just walk along the street
and find this glowing uranium?
CAROLINE
Well, it was everywhere in Moab,
they say -- just like gold in the
gold-rush days.
TOBY
But we were too late in Moab, and
that guy at the office said
nobody'd found any uranium in Salt
Lake City.
CAROLINE
Well, that means we'll have the
place pretty much to ourselves,
huh? Honey, this could be a big
break for us. If this works out,
oh, just think: we'll get us a
house, get rid of this damn Nash
Ambassador -- no money worries...
It'll be like heaven on a June day.

We hear "MOOD INDIGO" on the car RADIO and see that a
weary Caroline has driven through the night and Toby is
slumped against the passenger door. Toby stirs, then
opens his eyes.
CAROLINE
Ask me how far we are from Salt
Lake City.
Toby is instantly awake, excited. Caroline points to a
small highway sign and both she and Toby yell out.
CAROLINE/TOBY
Forty-seven miles to go!
Both of them are laughing with excitement. Toby claps
his hands together once, very hard, and Caroline yells --

Caroline, holding the imitation Geiger counter, stands
across the counter from a MAN who is looking at her
very strangely.
MAN
You're pulling my leg, right?
CAROLINE
No, I came here to look for
uranium.
MAN
My God, lady. If you're looking
for uranium, why didn't you go to
Moab?
CAROLINE
We went there, but everybody'd
beaten us there. We were too late.
MAN
So you came here just on the
chance you'd find uranium?
Listen, you mind me saying
something to you might sound rude?
Lady, you got more courage than
you got common sense.

Caroline turns the key in the ignition and gets only a
maddening RER-RER-RER-RER noise from the ENGINE:
wearily, she rests her forehead on the steering wheel.

A subdued Toby sits in front of the VICE PRINCIPAL.
VICE PRINCIPAL
... like to give new boys the
benefit of the doubt, but this
is the second time in two weeks
that you've been in front of me,
and I don't like that.
(picks up a telephone)
Now I think you better just call
your mother and tell her to come
down here.
TOBY
She works.
She's working.
Silent, the man continues to hold out the telephone to
Toby. Finally he takes it and dials.
15
16
The place is pretty bleak: a room and a half, Murphy
beds, linoleum floors, and a bath down the hall.
Caroline and Toby enter. She pulls down the Murphy
bed and falls onto it fully dressed, saying:
CAROLINE
My head is killing me.
Toby heads for his room.

SAME SCENE - DUSK
16A
Caroline wakes up with a start, then sees Toby sitting
in a chair, watching her.
CAROLINE
What time is it?
TOBY
Seven.
Almost.
CAROLINE
Why didn't you wake me?
TOBY
I started dinner. The potatoes
are frying, and I'm heating up the
hot dogs.
Caroline sees that he's trying to make it up to her, and
pats the bed for him to sit down next to her. He moves
to sit beside her.
CAROLINE
Hold your mother's hand.
(CONTINUED)

TOBY
I'm sorry.
CAROLINE
I know you are, honey. Ah, well
-- it wasn't fire, and nobody
bled, so I guess we're okay.
The TELEPHONE RINGS and she answers it.
When she hears
the VOICE on the other end she once again
touches her
right cheekbone with a finger -- the spot
where the
bruise had been. She sags back against a
wall.
CAROLINE
Yes...
(listens)
Yes...
(listens)
Yes, I know...
(listens)
You're right...
(listens)
All right, yes... in an hour,
then.
Caroline hangs up.
TOBY
Who was that?
She closes her eyes.
TOBY
Who was that?
Caroline laughs aloud, then slides down the wall until
she's on the floor still laughing.
CAROLINE
We've got a guest for dinner:
it's Roy. He tracked us down.
Toby groans and falls full-length onto the sofa.
17
17
Caroline, Toby and ROY are eating at the tiny table. Roy
is good-looking in a meaty, hairy-chested sort of way.
Though he is on his very best behavior just now, there is
a mean streak in him.
Toby, delighted, holds a Winchester .22 rifle across his
lap -- a peace-making gift from Roy.
(CONTINUED)

ROY
... I found me a room, but it's
clear the hell and gone 'cross
town. And I think I got a job
lined up doin' tune-ups in a
Texaco station. How you like it
at Winstead's?
CAROLINE
How do you know where I work?
ROY
I been here almost a week.
CAROLINE
You followed me around?
For a
week? Watching?
Roy doesn't answer.
He just wiggles his eyebrows like
Groucho Marx.
CAROLINE
And how did you ever find me?
Again, Roy does the Groucho Marx.
He turns to Toby.
ROY
You like the rifle, Toby?
'Jack,'
I mean.
TOBY
It's the best present I ever got.
I just love it.
(to Caroline)
I'm going to pretend I'm shooting.
CAROLINE
Don't point that thing at anybody
or I won't teach you to shoot.
TOBY
It's not loaded!
CAROLINE
You heard me:
anybody or any
thing.
TOBY
It's got no bullets, for God's
sake.
CAROLINE
Don't make me speak to you again.
(CONTINUED)

TOBY
I'll point it at the sky, then.
Caroline sighs. Toby opens a screenless window and
points the gun up into the night sky, pretending to fire
it over and over. Caroline starts to clear the table.
Roy jumps up to help her.
18
18
Caroline and Roy are
kissing on the sofa, and he is all
over her: his hands
are on her breasts, her thighs,
everywhere. Aroused
in spite of herself, Caroline pulls
away, indicating the
light in the other room.
CAROLINE
Don't.
Toby's still up.
Roy leans back, smiling, and eyes Caroline.
ROY
You are one sweet thing, baby:
just the sight of you makes my
dick hard.
He pulls her to him, starting to kiss her. She fends him
off, looking worriedly toward the room where Toby's light
burns.
ROY
Aw, he won't hear anything.
Again he pulls her toward him; again she turns her head
from the kiss.
Then it happens.
A spasm of anger passes across his face and he shoves
Caroline away from him. It's a hard shove, but nothing
that could really hurt her. Violence has happened before
between these two, and they recognize it. Caroline is
immediately on guard, and Roy is apologetic.
ROY
Shit, baby, I'm sorry. I didn't
mean that. I'm just so glad to
see you.
He slides toward Caroline, kisses her. This time she
accepts the kiss -- feels she has no choice.
14.
19
19
Dressed for bed, Toby stands by an open window. He can
hear every WORD of ROY'S, who continues to apologize
between kisses. The room is illuminated by a nearby
streetlamp. The frosty air from the open window causes
his breath to steam. He raises two fingers to his lips,
pretends to take a drag on a cigarette and blows out the
steam from his breath. The VOICES in the other room grow
a bit LOUDER, almost to an argument, and then SUBSIDE
again. Toby takes another drag from his pretend cig-
arette. He looks very young.
20
Toby enters.
Four packed suitcases lie on the bed behind
Caroline.
TOBY
What're you doing home so --
(as he sees
suitcases)
We going someplace?
CAROLINE
We sure are.
TOBY
Where?
CAROLINE
I don't know.
Got any suggestions?
TOBY
Phoenix.
CAROLINE
Good. I was thinking of Phoenix
or Seattle -- lots of opportunities
in both those places.
TOBY
What about your fabulous
boyfriends? What about the
fabulous, boring Roy? Is he
coming, too?
(CONTINUED)
16.
21
CONTINUED:
21
CAROLINE
Not if I can help it. I looked
out the window at work today, and
he was parked across the street,
watching.
TOBY
Roy's so uncool. So boring.
CAROLINE
You liked him well enough last
night.
(imitating Toby)
'Oh, Roy, I just love my rifle
so much! It's the bestest present
ever!'
TOBY
Oh, shut up.
But he's smiling, completely unbothered.
Suddenly Caroline laughs, stands up, and begins to close
the suitcases. Toby laughs, too.
TOBY
Now? We're going now?
What about
all the food?
CAROLINE
Leave it.
TOBY
Even the canned stuff?
CAROLINE
Leave it!
They grab the four heavy suitcases and head out the door.
Both of them are laughing.
22
22
Caroline and Toby stand at a ticket counter,
disappointed.
TOBY
Well, ask him when the next one
to Phoenix is.
TICKET SELLER
Tomorrow morning, eleven
forty-five.

Toby and Caroline groan, then Caroline brightens.
CAROLINE
What about Seattle?
TICKET SELLER
(consults a list)
Leaves in nine minutes.
They look at each other.

TERRY SILVER opens the door to admit Toby and Terry
Taylor. Silver is a clone of both Toby and Terry Taylor.
19.
26
26
As the three boys troop through the room, they pass Terry
Silver's two SISTERS, who are sprawled sensually on a
sofa.
SISTER #1
Oh look -- it's Elvis, Elvis,
and Elvis.
TERRY TAYLOR
Excuse me, but does your face
hurt? 'Cause it's killing me.
With that piece of high wit, they're out of the room.
27
27
The boys light up three cigarettes (opening a window so
the smoke will disappear), then throw themselves onto the
floor in front of a black-and-white TV.
Superman is ON. When Lois Lane comes on, Terry Taylor
starts moaning as if sexually aroused; Terry Silver jumps
to his knees and licks the TV screen repeatedly, also
moaning. Toby closes his eyes, also as if in sexual
transport.
TOBY
Oh, Lois. Oh, baby, come here --
I got six hot inches just waiting
for you.
TERRY TAYLOR
Man, look at her! Look at that
body-y-y-y.
TERRY SILVER
(continues licking
screen)
Um-m-m-m. M-M-M. Oh, Annette, I
want you. I want you so bad.
TOBY
Oh, babybabybabybabybaby...
You make my dick hard!
The three carry on for a few more seconds.
THREE OF THEM
Yum, yum, yum.
(CONTINUED)
20.
27
CONTINUED:
27
Making wet kissing noises, or just rocking their heads
back and forth as if tempted beyond endurance. Then,
slowly, they shut up and lie back down.
27A
SAME SCENE - LATER
27A
And this is what they really wanted: absolutely silent,
all three boys stare fixedly at the screen. They are
totally absorbed, caught up in the sweetness and warmth
of the show.
Not one of these boys has ever touched a girl's breast;
all three are at least two years from their first shave;
all three are pre-pubescent, and their sexuality is all
bravado -- now we see them for what they are: three
skinny-armed 13-year-olds, fascinated by Superman.
28
28
Caroline pirouettes for her two roommates, KATHY, a
diffident, sweet-faced young woman, and MARIAN, a
heavyset, loud, red-faced woman who eats compulsively
from a package of oatmeal cookies. Both of the women ooh
and aah over Caroline's dress.
KATHY
That belt just makes it.
CAROLINE
It does pick up the green, doesn't
it?
MARIAN
And you say he's getting serious
already?
CAROLINE
Yes, I think. He keeps talking
about marriage, keeps saying he
wants to meet Toby.
MARIAN
Well, that's it -- three dates and
you got 'im good.
CAROLINE
I don't know if I want him --
She stops as Toby enters the kitchen.
(CONTINUED)
21.
28
CONTINUED:
28
TOBY
Don't want who?
KATHY
(about Toby)
Little pitchers...
MARIAN
Well, it's the tough guy who can't
be bothered to go to school.
CAROLINE
(to Toby)
Oh, it's nothing -- we were
talking about Dwight. I told you
about Dwight.
TOBY
He the one drives down from the
boondocks? The mechanic? Dwight.
What a stupid name.
(he draws the name
out)
Dwiiiight. Duhhhhwight.
Dwight-tah-h-h-h. Dwighttahhhhh.
There is a KNOCK
on the front door. Toby sticks his head
around the door,
looking into the living room. A man is
outlined against
the sunset, only his black silhouette is
visible. It is
our first glimpse of DWIGHT.
Has the man heard him?
Toby doesn't know for sure.
Caroline brings Dwight into the kitchen.
He is older
than her, an attractive-enough man. He
is well-built,
has a full head of brown hair, and very
white teeth.
Those are his good points. On the minus
side: his over-
eagerness to please, his nervous smiles
and his clothes.
He wears two-tone shoes, a hand-painted
tie, and a
monogrammed handkerchief, folded beyond
perfection, in
the pocket.
Caroline introduces him to Marian and Kathy.
Then she
introduces Dwight to Toby.
Dwight is all smiles.
CAROLINE
Would you like coffee before we
go? Or a Coke?
DWIGHT
You know, I believe I could stand
a cup of java.
(CONTINUED)

As Caroline pours the coffee, Dwight turns to Toby.
DWIGHT
So you're Toby.
TOBY
No.
DWIGHT
You're not Toby?
TOBY
No.
CAROLINE
Oh, he wants to be called 'Jack.'
It's so silly... ever since he
read Jack London.
DWIGHT
Well, I'll call him anything he
wants.
(to Toby,
confidential)
I always say people can call me
anything they want, long as they
don't call me late for supper!
Kathy and Marian think it's pretty funny.
They laugh.
Caroline smiles. Toby just stares.
DWIGHT
So, Jack, you like school?
TOBY
No.
MARIAN
He might like it if he ever went
there and tried it.
TOBY
Oh, have another cookie, Marian --
keep your strength up.
MARIAN
I'd like to just yank that nasty
tongue of yours out by the roots.
CAROLINE
(to Dwight, light)
My son's decided to try to drive
me into an early grave. Truly.

CAROLINE (CONT'D)
(to Toby; not so
light)
You straighten up and be polite,
you hear me?
Dwight takes a swallow of the coffee.
His eyes widen.
DWIGHT
Who made this?
CAROLINE
I did...
DWIGHT
Well, well, well, all I can say is
that you people are pretty lucky
to live in a house where -- oh.
Marian puts a cigarette into her mouth. Dwight jumps up,
pulls a velvet case from his pocket and extracts a mono-
grammed Zippo. He snaps open the top of the lighter
against his leg, and holds the flame in front of Marian's
face. She lights her cigarette. Then Dwight perform the
Zippo drama in reverse.
What a conversation stopper.
Finally, Kathy speaks to
Toby.
KATHY
I hear you're invited up to
Dwight's next week for
Thanksgiving.
DWIGHT
Aw, you'll love it. Great air,
great water. For scenery, all you
have to do is step outside your
front door and open your eyes.
And there's a turkey shoot
Thanksgiving Day. Your mom said
you might like it, so I signed you
up.
Toby sits up, eager.
TOBY
Really? I can shoot my Winchester?
Great! I bet I could be the one
to get the turkey.

CAROLINE
Well, amazing: it can sit up and
talk like a normal human being.
(notices the time)
Dwight, we're going to be late.
She grabs her coat (which Dwight jumps up to hold for
her) and they exit. As Dwight leaves he kisses his hand,
then throws the kiss toward Marian and Kathy. The
instant the front door slams:
TOBY
MARIAN
KATHY
What a geek.
I love a man knows
He's so appealing.
how to dress.

Caroline is dressed casually. Toby has on a shirt and
sweater. He is pretending that he's buck-toothed.
Caroline finishes packing a small suitcase.
CAROLINE
I want you to be polite to Dwight
this weekend.
TOBY
(buck-toothed speech)
Okay.
CAROLINE
I mean it, now.
TOBY
(buck-toothed speech)
I said 'Okay,' didn't I?
CAROLINE
Hey, c'mon, maybe the weekend'll
be fun... maybe Concrete will be
pretty.

TOBY
(buck-toothed speech)
Oh, Concrete, my favorite town.
Welcome to beautiful Concrete!
CAROLINE
And stop that.
TOBY
(buck-toothed speech)
Stop what?
CAROLINE
Sometimes I could kill you as free
as I could eat a bite.
TOBY
(buck-toothed speech)
Ditto.
A car stops and through a window, we see Dwight.
Caroline turns to Toby.
CAROLINE
Please be nice.
Toby stops the buck-toothed thing and speaks normally.
TOBY
All right.
31
34
They enter and look around: well,
it's not awful, but
it sure as hell isn't wonderful.
The room is dark, on
the small side, and shows the lack
of a woman's hand.
Caroline looks a bit taken aback,
but tries to hide it
by saying the word "nice" over and
over.
The CAMERA FOLLOWS them FROM room TO room:
DWIGHT
Okay, so that was the living room;
over here is the kitchen -- I plan
on getting all new fixtures in
here -- and down that hall are the
three bedrooms and the bath.
He stops at an extra, no-particular-purpose, nondescript
room furnished only by two easy chairs and a card table.
DWIGHT
This is sort of a lounging area.
(as nobody says
anything)
You know, just in case you want
to...
He searches, can't think of how to finish the sentence in
any impressive way. He gives up, finishes weakly:
DWIGHT
... lounge.
Skipper snorts with laughter, but cuts it off when Dwight
gives him a look. Toby, trying to be good, bites his lip
to keep from laughing.
35
36
Dwight has recovered his good mood. Dressed in a
marksman's coat with a padded shoulder, Dwight is laughing
as he attempts to assemble Toby's Winchester .22.

DWIGHT
'Turkey shoot' is just a figure of
speech.
TOBY
There's no real turkey?
DWIGHT
No, it's just regulation paper
targets. It's a test of skill.
(a beat)
And, Jack, I just found out
yesterday that they won't let
kids shoot.
TOBY
But you said I could!
DWIGHT
I know, but they got it all
screwed up somehow and told me
wrong at first.
Toby starts to argue, but Caroline touches his arm.
CAROLINE
Dwight, you did tell him.
DWIGHT
(an edge)
I don't make the rules, Caroline.
If I made the rules, I might make
different ones, but I don't make
the rules.
37
39
Caroline, Toby and Pearl enter. Norma is cooking
Thanksgiving dinner. Dwight WALKS HEAVILY down the hall
to his bedroom and SLAMS the DOOR.
NORMA
What gives?
TOBY
Mom won the turkey shoot.
NORMA
Oh, boy. Now we're in for it --
he thinks he's some kind of big
hunter.
PEARL
Well, he killed a deer once.
NORMA
That was with the car.
They all laugh.
40
40
Though there are some occasional sentences like
"Could I
have the potatoes, please?" or "This dressing is
really
delicious," mostly there is just silence and the
noise
of SILVERWARE ON PLATES. Dwight is working hard
on the
wine.
DWIGHT
I got just one thing to say.
(as everyone
stiffens)
I'm sitting at the table with the
best damn shot in the county!
Everybody relaxes, and general conversation begins.

Norma plays "Blue Monday" on an upright piano whilst Toby
sings it. After finishing the song, Norma launches into
"On Moonlight Bay." Everybody joins in.

SAME SCENE - MIDDLE OF NIGHT
41A
Caroline, who is sleeping on the sofa bed, returns from
the bathroom. She sees that Toby's awake on his pallet
on the floor. She sits on the floor beside him. (The
whole conversation is conducted in whispers.)
CAROLINE
So what do you think?
TOBY
They're okay. What's that bald
spot on Pearl's head? Ugh.
CAROLINE
Some sort of infection.
TOBY
Norma's nice.
CAROLINE
They're all nice, but Dwight keeps
rushing me, keeps talking about
marriage. And I don't really want
to get married -- not now anyway.
TOBY
That's fine with me.
(a beat; new tone)
I wish you would've stayed married
to Dad.
CAROLINE
Oh, don't wish Duke back on me.
God.
TOBY
That woman he married?
Is she
really rich?
CAROLINE
Like King Midas. Okay, look,
we'll go back to Seattle and see
how things go. I've been thinking
about taking a course in
stenotyping. A court reporter's
pay is real high. Kathy got
engaged, so either I find us
another roommate or I've got to
make some more money. And this
stenotyping thing sounds just
right. This could turn out good,
honey.
35.
42

Toby, Terry Silver and Terry Taylor lounge against the
wall, smoking.
TOBY
I mean I blew it off, man -- I
blew his fuckin' turkey's head
off.
Terry Silver takes a long slow drag on his cigarette.
The other boys glance at each other: they don't buy it.
TERRY TAYLOR
With a .22.
TOBY
Fuckin' A.
Winchester .22.
Pump.
TERRY TAYLOR
Wolff, you are so full of shit.
TOBY
Don't believe me -- see if I care.
TERRY TAYLOR
All a .22 bullet would do is make
a hole in his head.
Toby takes a drag on his cigarette.
TOBY
One bullet, maybe.
TERRY TAYLOR
Oh. Oh, I see -- you hit the
turkey more than once. While he
was flying. In the head.
Toby nods. Silver
and Taylor howl with laughter.
Furious, Toby says
"Fuck you" over and over. He pulls
out a rat-tail and
scratches the words "FUCK YOU" onto
the soft paint of
the bathroom wall.

44
Caroline, Toby, Marian and Kathy sit at the table eating
dinner.
KATHY
... exactly what I wanted for my
dress. It's a Simplicity pattern,
and I'm pretty sure I can make it
myself. It's got big puff
sleeves...
Caroline takes out a cigarette. Then everybody jumps
as Toby yells and jumps up knocking his chair over
backwards.
TOBY
Oh!
Toby grabs Caroline's lighter, and begins to imitate
Dwight: saying, "Oh!" and "Oh, yes!" and Oh, my!"
and "Here, let me!" and "I'll do that!"
It's a mean, accurate imitation of Dwight. All three
women laugh in spite of themselves. Caroline keeps
saying "Jack, that's enough," and Marian says, "Dwight's
not that bad." But they can't help laughing. Toby
offers the other two women a light, then offers a broom,
the back door, and the refrigerator a light.

The principal, MR. SHIPPY, sits behind his desk. Toby,
looking scared, sits across from him. A secretary lets
Caroline into the room. Mr. Shippy rises and introduces
himself. Caroline doesn't respond to the introduction.
CAROLINE
What did he do?
MR. SHIPPY
He violated the school property
and flouted the law.
CAROLINE
Can you say that in English?

MR. SHIPPY
He wrote obscene words on the
wall.
CAROLINE
(to Toby)
Did you do it?
(as he shakes his
head "no")
He didn't do it.
MR. SHIPPY
(strong)
He wrote obscene words on the wall.
CAROLINE
What obscene words?
MR. SHIPPY
(after a beat)
'Fuck you.'
CAROLINE
That's one obscene word.
Mr. Shippy looks stymied.
There is a pause.
MR. SHIPPY
Look, Mrs. Wolff, Jack's teachers,
like him but they think he's fallen
in with the wrong kind of friends.
(peers at Toby's
hand)
Is that nicotine stain on your
fingers?
(as Toby shakes his
head "no")
I hope not. Let me tell you a
story: I started smoking in
college. Two packs a day. I ate
'em.
(a beat)
One night I went to have a
cigarette and lo and behold, the
pack was empty. I went downstairs
and started to rummage through the
garbage cans. But as I reached
down -- I mean, right down into a
garbage can -- I suddenly thought,
'Whoa. Hold on right there,
Buster.' I went back to my room
and to this day I haven't smoked
another cigarette.

After that, every day I saved the
exact amount of money I would've
spent on cigarettes. In three
years, I put it all together, and
you know what I bought? I bought
myself...
(a dramatic pause;
big finish)
... a Nash Ambassador.
Caroline gives a bark of laughter. She brings out a
handkerchief and coughs, as if she has a cold. Mr.
Shippy looks puzzled.
MR. SHIPPY
Well, back to the point:
I think
two weeks' suspension.

Caroline and Toby enter the house. Caroline goes into
the bedroom, shuts the door. Toby sits on the couch.

SAME SCENE - NIGHT
46A
Late afternoon sun slants through the venetian blinds.
Toby sits exactly as he sat before. Then Caroline comes
out of the bedroom, ominously calm. She sits down.
CAROLINE
So what shall we do?
TOBY
What do you mean?
CAROLINE
Ever since Duke and I got divorced,
you're a different boy. I know
he never calls you and I could
kill him for it -- but that's how
Duke is. And Gregory's in
Princeton now, so I guess...
(refocusing)
So what shall we do? Because this
isn't working.

We barely have enough money,
Kathy's moving out, and on top of
it all, you've gone wild. You
lie...

TOBY
No I don'...
CAROLINE
Yes, you do. You steal from
Marian's purse -- I just can't
handle you anymore, and it scares
me. I don't know what to do.
So, you tell me what to do.
TOBY
(he means it)
I can be better. I will be.
(it bursts out of
him)
And I hate the way I am anymore!
I don't know why I do it!
(a beat)
What about that stenotyping
thing you were gonna do?
With peculiar intensity, Caroline speaks in a soft,
odd voice:
CAROLINE
It won't happen. It won't happen.
It won't happen. Things aren't
going to turn out well, things
aren't going to start looking up,
and it's never going to be like
heaven on a June day. There is
no uranium. There is no
stenotyping. There is no C.P.A.
license. There isn't...
She stands for a few moments as if listening for a
far-off sound.
CAROLINE
... I talked to Dwight: after
Christmas, he wants you to come
up to Concrete and live with him
for a few months -- go to school
there.
TOBY
What are you going to do, just
give me away to him?
CAROLINE
If you two can get along, if it
works out, then I guess he and I
might get married.

The two stare at each other.
CAROLINE
I can't think of anything else to
do. But first I want your
approval.
Again the two stare at each other.
TOBY
All right.
Caroline nods, turns away.
47

Christmas is over: a few scattered pieces of wrapping
paper lie scattered on the floor, and a small Christmas
tree with bubble-lights glows in a corner.
Caroline shuts a suitcase and looks at Toby.
CAROLINE
I put in both your sweaters. You
wear them now, the nights are so
chilly up there.
TOBY
Okay.
I will.
CAROLINE
You don't have to go if you don't
want to, honey.
TOBY
No, it's okay.
I'll go.
O.S. we hear a KNOCKING and Dwight's cheery voice.
DWIGHT (O.S.)
Here I am, you lucky people!
48
49
Dwight
takes a pull from a pint bottle of whiskey and
gives
Toby a sneering, contemptuous look. Toby reaches
over,
SNAPS ON the RADIO. Immediately Dwight SNAPS IT
off.
Then, in the headlight's glare, Toby sees a dark
shape.
TOBY
Hey, look:
is that a raccoon or
a beaver.
Dwight swerves deliberately to hit the animal. There is
a sickening THUMP, and Dwight stops. As he backs up:
DWIGHT
Go get it -- the pelt's worth
fifty bucks, minimum.
TOBY
That thing's probably got rabies...
DWIGHT
(low)
Get it!
50
51
Dwight is still drinking, between swallows, he gives Toby
sneering glances. Dwight is driving very fast. The
road begins a series of curves. Dwight doesn't slow
down, and the TIRES begin to SCREAM on the curves.
The road runs along a steep gorge. Dwight increases
the speed, and the car begins to fishtail.
TOBY
I'm a little sick to my stomach.
DWIGHT
Sick to your stomach?
A hotshot
like you?
TOBY
I'm not a hotshot.
(CONTINUED)
42.

DWIGHT
That's what I hear. I hear you're
a real hotshot. Come and go where
you please, do what you please.
Isn't that right? Yeah, regular
man about town. Performer, too.
That right, Jack? You a performer?
TOBY
No, sir.
DWIGHT
That's a goddamned lie.
Dwight keeps glancing from the road to Toby, and back
again.
DWIGHT
If there's one thing I can't
stomach, it's a liar.
TOBY
I'm not a liar.
DWIGHT
Sure you are. You or Marian. Is
Marian a liar? She says you're
quite the little performer. Is
that a lie? You tell me that's a
lie and we'll drive back to Seattle
so you can call her a liar to her
face. You want me to do that?
TOBY
No.
DWIGHT
Then you must be the one's a liar,
right?
(as Toby nods)
And you're a performer?
TOBY
I guess.
DWIGHT
You guess? You guess? Let's see
your act. Go on. Do your act.
(when Toby is silent)
I'm waiting.
TOBY
I can't.

DWIGHT
Sure you can.
TOBY
No, sir.
DWIGHT
Do me.
I hear you do me.
Again Toby shakes his head, and then gasps as the CAR
SKIDS hideously close to the cliff's edge. Dwight is
oblivious to the danger.
DWIGHT
Yeah, I hear you're good at doing
me. Here. Do me with the lighter.
Go on. Take it.
Dwight holds out the velvet-covered Zippo, driving with
one hand, and the car is all over the road. Dwight puts
the lighter back into his pocket. The car slows a bit.
DWIGHT
Hotshot. You pull that hotshot
stuff around me and I'll break
every bone in your body. You
understand me?
(a beat)
You're in for a change, mister.
You got that? Huh? You got that
good?
(so scary)
You're in for a whole 'nother
ballgame.
52
53
Dwight, Toby, Norma, Skipper and Pearl are eating dinner
at the kitchen table. Norma speaks to Toby.
NORMA
You'll be in Miss Graham's class?
TOBY
Yeah, is she nice?
NORMA
She's okay.
She's pretty.
TOBY
I hate changing schools.
DWIGHT
Speaking of changing, I had a talk
with Jack on the way up here, and
he says he wants to be a better
boy. And that's good, 'cause
things weren't going well for him
in Seattle: the police actually
came to his house to talk to
Caroline about him. Uh-huh, the
police.
PEARL
(very low; to Toby)
Criminal.
(CONTINUED)
45.
53
CONTINUED:

DWIGHT
So here's what I think: I think
idle hands are the devil's
workshop, and so I found our Jack
a little something to do.
(to Toby)
I picked up two barrels of horse-
chestnuts in the park. You can
spend your evenings hulling 'em.
And I enrolled you in the Boy
Scouts, and you've got a paper
route, starting Monday, every
afternoon from three to six-thirty
-- pays fifty-five bucks a month.
What d'you say?
Toby glances around the table, he is subdued.
TOBY
I'll do it.
(means it)
I want to be... better.
DWIGHT
That's what I like to hear. Okay,
you guys get these dishes cleaned
up. Let's show Jack how we do it
in Concrete.
54
54
MISS GRAHAM stands in front of the class.
Toby is midway
back in the room.
MISS GRAHAM
(reading)
'Of course I prayed -- and did God
care? He cared as much as on the
air a bird had stamped her foot
and cried, "Give me".' Now. What
is the tone of this short poem?
GIRL
Is it religious?
MISS GRAHAM
No -- even though it talks about
God, I wouldn't say it was
religious.
BOY
It's sad.
(CONTINUED)
46.
54
CONTINUED:
54
MISS GRAHAM
Well, closer, maybe. But no.
There is a pause.
Finally, Toby raises his hand.
MISS GRAHAM
Jack?
TOBY
It's angry, sort of bitter.
MISS GRAHAM
Very good, Jack. Bull's-eye.
From the front of
the room, a tall,
thin, effeminate
boy, ARTHUR GAYLE,
turns to look at
Toby and holds
the gaze for three
full beats, then
turns around and
faces the front.
What the hell does
it mean?
55
55
The room is dark. Skipper is asleep. Toby lies in a
cot. Dwight leans against the wall near the head of
Toby's bed. He speaks in a low, reasonable voice:
DWIGHT
... 'cause I don't believe that
crap, you know? I believe there
is such a thing as a bad boy --
bad clear through. And it's gonna
be my job to turn you around, to
kill or cure. Kill. Or. Cure.
Understand? And I'm up to the
job, oh yes, believe me, hotshot,
I am ready, willing and able to
take you on -- you and that
jibagoo music you like to sing.
I'm just the guy to knock that
music out of your head and put in
some respect and obedience.
(a pause)
Now your mother has just about
washed her hands of you -- that's
obvious, 'cause she's shipped you
off up here. I mean, she has had
it with you. She told me: she
said 'Dwight, I just can't handle
him anymore.' So don't go crying
to Mama, 'cause Mama won't listen.
Mama is sick to death of her baby
boy.

And your rich Daddy Warbucks and

told me they haven't even written
in over two years. So it looks
like I'm all you got now -- it's
just you and me. Feels sort of
inevitable, doesn't it, hotshot?
It's like we were fated for each
other, like I'm the one guy on
Earth could set you straight.
And don't you ever think I won't
enjoy doing it, 'cause...

(AFTERNOON) Toby delivers papers in a sack filled
55
with papers slung over one shoulder which thuds
against his hip with every step making him tilt
to one side against the weight.
55
B)
(NIGHT) Toby
sits in a utility porch. The floor
55
around him is
two feet deep in horse chestnuts. With
a knife and a
pair of pliers he husks the chestnuts.
His hands are
covered with scrapes and cuts and the
chestnut hulls
bleed a juice that has dyed them a
bright yellow.
CAROLINE (V.O.)
Dear Toby, I sure do miss you,
honey -- the house is like a tomb
since you left. So quiet. My
only entertainment tonight was
watching Marian eat a whole pint
of ice cream. I hope you're
liking it up in Concrete. I just
know you'll try hard in school and
be good and mind Dwight. I worry
about you so much, and I hope this
will be just what you need.

Toby rubs futilely at his yellow hands with
55

He sees Arthur Gayle coming toward him in the
street. His hips sway as he walks, and
his head
tilts to one side. As he and Toby pass
one another,
he raises one arm and points at Toby.
The he walks
on.
TOBY (V.O.)
Dear Mom, Thanks for the birthday
present. It fit fine. You don't
have to worry so much. I'm okay
here. The weather is nice, and I
like Scouts a lot. Dwight took us
all to see Bridge on the River
Kwai. I liked it. So things are
all right with me, except for
stupid Pearl, who I hate. Don't
worry all the time...

(DAY) Toby is on the utility porch
husking the 55
horse chestnuts. His hands are now
orange. Pearl

appears beside Pearl. Norma's face
turns
sympathetic.
NORMA
You remind me of that boy in the
fairy tale who had to spend twenty
years sifting sand to find a
golden needle. Remember that one?
Toby doesn't answer. The two girls move away.
Toby
sighs, and picks up another chestnut.
55
G)
(DAY) Toby, keeping an eye on the door to make 55
sure he's unobserved, reaches under the mattress
of Skipper's bed and pulls out several billfold-sized
black and white pornographic photographs. The hair
styles of the women in them are decades old.
Toby takes the photographs into the bathroom,
shutting the door behind him.
CAROLINE (V.O.)
Dear Toby, Just a note before
going to bed. Dwight tells me
that the two of you are getting
along like a house afire. I'm
so glad. I wanted this to work
out for you. You left your sock
cap here. Do you need it...?

Toby and Pearl are playing a card game called "Slap-
Jack." Toby slaps a card down hard, yelling "I win

PEARL
That's no fair. You make me sick.
I don't know why you have to live
here, anyway. Daddy says we
should think of it like you were
a charity kid.
Toby takes out his comb, combs his hair a bit, then
holds it out to Pearl, an exaggerated look of innocence
on his face.
TOBY
Wanna comb your hair, Pearl?
Pearl covers her bald spot with one hand.
TOBY
Probably you do, since you've
got such pretty hair.
I know if
I had hair as pretty as yours,
Pearl, I'd comb it all the time.
Pearl is on the verge of tears. There are THREE TREMEN-
DOUSLY LOUD FLAT-FOOTED KICKS against the front door.
DWIGHT (O.S.)
Open the hell up! I got us a
treat!
Pearl opens the door revealing a beaming Dwight holding
two dishpans piled high with snow. We see through the
doorway that the sun is shining and there isn't snow
anywhere.
PEARL
We're gonna have snowcream!

Dwight, Toby, Skipper, Norma, and Pearl are enjoying
the snowcream.
DWIGHT
... heard there was a fresh snow
this morning, so I drove up to
the mountains. I stopped in a
field where it was all clean. I
was finished packing it up high
when somebody said...
(prissy voice)
This's private property, in case
you're interested.
(normal voice)
I turned around and there was this
woman...
(he shudders)
Yechh! Ugliest woman I ever saw
-- ugly as a madman's ass she was.
And frowning on top of it.
Everybody laughs.
NORMA
Oh, Daddy!
DWIGHT
She was!
TOBY
(to Pearl; soft;
happy)
You're ugly as a madman's ass.
PEARL
No, you are.
SKIPPER
What'd you say to the ugly woman?
DWIGHT
I didn't say nothin' -- I ran.
Everybody laughs again.

Don't believe in doing anything

We'll do it right together.
Dwight takes out a magazine entitled Boy's Life.
He
hands it to Toby.
DWIGHT
I got you a subscription to this.
I'll take the price out of your
paper route money.
TOBY
Boy's Life?
DWIGHT
It's the official Scout magazine.
Tells about what it means to be a
Scout, what kind of boy you need
to be, and, oh, about merit badges
and stuff like that.
Toby opens the book at random, reads from it.
TOBY
'Suggested good turns a Scout can
do: assist a foreign
boy with
some English grammar.
Help put
out a burning field.
Give water
to a crippled dog.'
I could do
those.

Hell, yes, you could. You're a
bright kid. I want this Scout
thing done right, okay?
Toby nods, enthusiastic, happy.

The shirt-sleeves have been shortened but the shoulders
extend two inches beyond the ends of his shoulders. The
pants legs have been cut off and hemmed but the crotch of
the trousers hangs down three inches too low, giving him
a stumpy, dwarfish look. Toby yells to someone O.S.
TOBY
I'm not going.
DWIGHT (O.S.)
The hell you say.
TOBY
I'm not. Cut down Skipper's old
stuff, and he's twice as big as
me -- I'm gonna stay home.
DWIGHT (O.S.)
You're gonna shit and fall back in
it -- that's all you're gonna do.
Now get out here.

As Pearl watches Dwight also stands in front of a mirror,
adjusting his hat. He is resplendent in a brand-new
Scout uniform. Toby stalks into the room. Pearl laughs
loudly.

Shut your pie-hole.

You look fine.

I look like an idiot.
DWIGHT
You act like an idiot, you look

you're all jazzed up in new stuff.
DWIGHT
They didn't have second-hand
uniforms in my size.
TOBY
Oh, yeah, pull the other leg, it's
got bells on it!
Toby throws himself down on the sofa.
DWIGHT
And what're you gonna tell
Caroline this weekend? You gonna
say you wouldn't join the Scouts
because... him didn't wike his
widdle uniform?
Dwight picks up the copy of Boy's Life and thumbs through
it, He reads:
DWIGHT
'No boy given over to dissipation
or negativity can stand the gaff.
He quickly tires and gives up. He
is the type who usually lacks
courage at the crucial moment. He
cannot take punishment and come
back smiling.'
Dwight looks at Toby expectantly.
Toby hesitates, then
gives up.
TOBY
All right, but this stinks.
Toby walks outside.
Dwight follows.
DWIGHT
Hotshot, you don't know it yet,

Oh, we have us some pretty good

Now that's a song. Not all this
Elvis Presley shit. Elvis sings
about like I do brain surgery.
He imitates Elvis -- moves his hips slightly and sings a
few notes:
DWIGHT
'... uh-huh-huh, my blue suede
shoes.'
Dwight gives Toby a flash of his teeth and Toby smiles

The walls and ceiling are almost finished, but the paint

As he paints, he absentmindedly sings "Blue Suede Shoes."
Then he stops painting, as he notices Toby looking at the

dark ivory keys to match the rest of the room. ELVIS
SCREAMS OUT the last line, "You can do anything, but
stay off of my blue suede shoes!"
They stand up, look around -- Arctic white is every-
where. Dwight likes it. Toby is less sure.
The MONTAGE ENDS.
66
67
Caroline is trying to stifle her laughter, as she stares
at the wilderness of white. Dwight and Toby, Skipper,
Norma, and Pearl all stand watch.

CAROLINE
Oh! Oh, I'm so sorry... don't
know what's the matter with me...
you're right... it does look
clean...
But she can't stop laughing.
Her laughter has just a
tinge of hysteria.
68
68
Dwight and Caroline are being married. Caroline wears
a pale blue suit, and Dwight looks good in a navy single-
breasted. Aside from Toby and Dwight's children, the
only guests are Marian, Kathy, and three people we
haven't seen before -- friends of Dwight's.
69
69
The bed is a rat's nest of twisted sheets as Dwight
and
Caroline make love. He takes his lips away from
Caroline's breast and moves so that his head is at
the
bottom of the bed. Holding her foot up, he kisses
the
instep, then runs his tongue over the same spot and
then
down under the arch of her foot. A sexy scene.
DWIGHT
M-m-m. There's not a straight
line on you -- everything's
curved.
Caroline draws him up
to her, and they kiss. Then
Dwight turns Caroline
on her side, away from him, pre-
paring to enter her.
Caroline makes a small sound of
protest, turning back
toward him.
CAROLINE
Oh, Dwight, not like that.
Not
this time -- not tonight.
DWIGHT
It's good this way.
CAROLINE
But I want to see your face while
we make love.
DWIGHT
(uncomfortable laugh)
Oh, no -- I just don't... uh...
like that way.
(CONTINUED)
61.
69
CONTINUED:
69
Dwight continues to stroke Caroline, his hands everywhere,
but now she is unresponsive.
CAROLINE
You mean you don't like to make
love face to face?
DWIGHT
(same laugh)
No, I don't like it. I can't
handle it -- I don't like to see
the face.
CAROLINE
You mean ever?
Dwight murmurs an assent.
Caroline is appalled.
CAROLINE
But that's grotesque...
DWIGHT
(stung; flares up)
Look, you can get it doggie-style
or you can get it laying on your
side -- those are your only
choices. This is my house, and I
get to say. Wherever McGinty sits
is the head of the table, you
know?
Disgusted, Caroline turns back away from Dwight. He
shifts down on the bed a few inches, again preparing to
enter her.

Toby is eating toast at the kitchen table. Norma has
made a big breakfast, and she hurriedly pours the coffee
when she hears Dwight and Caroline's bedroom DOOR OPEN.
NORMA
Happy Wedding Breakfast!
Caroline's eyes
are red and swollen. Dwight turns ON a
RADIO, sips his
coffee, and chats with Norma. Toby gives
Norma's rear-end
an appreciative glance, then comes up
behind Caroline,
speaking sotto voce:
TOBY
So how's the bride?
(CONTINUED)
62.
70
CONTINUED:
70
CAROLINE
Don't.
TOBY
The bride doesn't want to chat?
CAROLINE
Stop it.
TOBY
Well, the bride is sure snotty
this morning.
Smiling, Toby waits for some response to his teasing,
but there is none. She turns away and sits at the table.
71
72
Caroline is painting the white walls a soothing buff
color.
On the sofa lie half-finished curtains she's
making.
She is totally focused. She hears Toby, turns,
sees his filthy clothes. Her shoulders sag.
CAROLINE
I won't do it, you know. I won't
be a referee between the two of
you.
TOBY
Who asked you?
CAROLINE
You both do. You do. Just by
coming home like this you ask me
to take your side when he raises
hell.

CAROLINE (CONT'D)
Well, the answer's 'No.' I'm going
to make this marriage work. No
fights.
TOBY
Oh, the bride is calm.
Who the
hell cares?
Caroline refuses to argue. She picks up a piece of
material and holds it up to the window to see if her
choice of color was a good one.
CAROLINE
(to herself)
... seems like this place is so
ugly. Seems like everywhere I
look there's something... ugly.
73
73
A worried Toby sits dreading Dwight's arrival. Behind
him, on the wall, Toby has pinned the covers of fifteen
copies of the Scout magazine: so that, above Toby's
head are the words BOY'S LIFE fifteen times.
There is a MURMUR of VOICES, and FOOTSTEPS COMING toward
Toby. Toby expects the worst. But, surprisingly, Dwight
is beaming.
DWIGHT
Who won?
TOBY
(surprised)
Uh, well, uh... he's the one can't
see out of one eye.
DWIGHT
Hot damn! You actually gave
little Lord Gayle a black eye?
TOBY
Well, it wasn't black yet.
DWIGHT
But it was all puffed up?
(as Toby nods)
Then it was a shiner.
(CONTINUED)
67.
73
CONTINUED:

Dwight sits down next to Toby, eager for details.
DWIGHT
How'd it start?
TOBY
I called him a sissy.
Dwight hoots with laughter and slaps his leg.
DWIGHT
Well, he sure's hell can't sue you
for slander. That boy fights for
the pink team. Did you make him
cry?
TOBY
Well... he was just ready to. I
called him a big-assed, squat-
to-pee sissy.
(as Dwight slaps his
leg again)
I'd have won bigger except he hit
me when I wasn't looking.
DWIGHT
(suddenly serious)
He dry-gulched you. Now that's
your fault. You gotta keep your
guard up. There's no excuse for
getting dry-gulched. I'll show
you a couple moves after supper
that'll leave Miss Arthur Gayle
wondering what month it is.
74
74
Still excited, Dwight is holding forth for the whole
family. (We hear THUNDER of an approaching storm)
DWIGHT
... so he says, 'You and who
else's army?' 'Just the three of
us,' I say. 'Me, myself and I.'
(a beat)
Well, after school he's waiting
for me and he yells something -- I
tell you, with people like that,
you got to hurt 'em, gotta inflict
pain, or they'll never leave you
alone.

DWIGHT (CONT'D)
(a beat)
So it was real hot out, okay? And
there were these horse turds laying
all over the place. I picked one up
and went up to him, but not acting
tough, okay? Acting more like, 'Oh
gee, I'm so scared, please don't
hurt me.' Sort of like this:
Dwight slumps his shoulders, drops his chin, and looks up
through his eyebrows, a simpering expression on his face.
DWIGHT
So I say, 'Excuse me, but what's
the problem?' And he starts in on
me again, blah, blah, blah, and I
jam a horse turd right into that
big mouth. Then I give him a
sucker punch in the breadbasket,
and he goes down like a...
Dwight goes on, relishing the story.

Caroline is on the telephone, her voice low. (Behind
her, through a doorway, we can see Dwight and Toby
boxing.)

CAROLINE
... not good, to tell you the
truth not good at all.
(listens)
No, he's not mean to me...
(listens again)
No, he's good about that: comes
home right after work every night.
(listens again)
Oh, Marian, I don't know -- maybe
I just got my hopes too high,
although I don't think so. All I
want is a little...
(searches)
... a little son-of-a-bitching
sweetness. That's all.
(listens; laughs)
You think so, huh? You always did
have an eye for Dwight, didn't
you?
(leans back; watches
Dwight and Toby)
The thing is, he's out on the
porch teaching Jack to box right
now. I keep thinking if I can
hang on, things'll settle down.
If I can just hang on long enough,
it'll work out and my kid'll have
a father. You know?
77
78
Dwight and Caroline lie on the bed, kissing passionately.
It is clear that Caroline is as excited as Dwight.

CAROLINE
I know you may think this is
silly, Dwight, but it seems
like... I don't know, like an
emblem or something. I want to
be able to see your face when we
make love. How else can we be
cl --
The rest of the word is jerked out of her as Dwight turns
her onto her side, away from him, and proceeds to make
love again in his favorite manner.
DWIGHT
You just don't know what's good,
Sugar. You're too tense. You
just relax and Dwight'll take you
on a little trip. Okay? You'll
have a good time.
Caroline closes her eyes.

SAME SCENE - HOURS LATER
78A
Dwight leans back against the headboard of the bed.
Caroline sits between his legs, her back against his
chest. With one hand, Dwight strokes Caroline's hair.
The other hand is curled around her throat.
DWIGHT
... are the prettiest thing I've
ever seen. I mean it. You are.
The way your hair curls up right
there. So pretty. I just love
you so much. I don't know what
I'd do if you ever left me. I
couldn't take it.
(smiles)
Guy I knew in the Navy had a
saying: 'If you love her, here's
what to do: Let her go visit
places new. If she loves you,
she'll come back to you.
If
she don't come back... hunt the
bitch down and kill her.'
(laughs)
That's awful, I guess. I don't
feel that way, but close. My
pretty thing...
We see that Caroline realizes the enormity of her
mistake.
72.
79
79
Smoking a cigarette and wearing a nightgown, Caroline
walks to the front door.
She opens the front door and stands looking out. Then
she puts her finger on the door and slowly pushes it shut
with one finger. She does this once more. Then she does
it again. She turns, walks toward Toby's room.
80
80
Caroline enters and stands by Toby's bed. She bends over
the boy and she starts to touch his hair, decides not to.
She stares at Toby for a few beats.
81
81
Caroline enters, looks down at the sleeping Dwight. She
gets back into the bed and Dwight throws a sleepy hand
over her. Caroline hesitates, but forces herself to put
a hand over Dwight's.
82
82
THROUGH a window, Dwight, dressed in his coveralls,
leaves for work. Caroline is sewing on a machine whilst
Toby leans against the kitchen sink.
TOBY
... but ask him again, why don't
you? I hate it so much.
CAROLINE
(never stops sewing)
I asked him a week ago, I asked
him this morning -- he wants you
to keep the paper route.
TOBY
Then make him give me the money.
It's mine, I earned it. It's
$220.00 already.
CAROLINE
He won't. He says he'll keep it
for when you really need it.
TOBY
That's not fair. I ought to be
able to have my own money.
(as Caroline shrugs)
But it's mine.
(CONTINUED)
73.
82
CONTINUED:
82
CAROLINE
You remind me of a baby bird --
you know those frantic little
things with their mouths wide
open, wanting, wanting.
TOBY
Well, at least ask him about my
gym shoes again. I can practice
barefoot but for games I gotta
have shoes.
CAROLINE
I'm not a referee. I won't do
it.
TOBY
Oh, we know, we know: the bride
won't argue. The bride won't
raise her voice.
CAROLINE
Well, I'll tell you what
the bride
will do: the bride will
get up
and walk over there and
slap hell
out of the bride's son.
Now does
the bride's son want his
face
slapped?
TOBY
Oh, I hate it here! I wish we
could just get up and go.
CAROLINE
I don't have another 'get up and
go' left in me! You understand?
I'm telling you I've hit a god-
damn wall. I can't run anymore.
Now this whole thing isn't perfect
for me, either... let me impress
that on you real strong, okay? I
don't wake up singing every morning.
But I'm going to make this marriage
work -- I won't join in any fights,
you got that? I won't even raise
my voice!
Caroline points to the sink.
CAROLINE
See those two roses? He picked
them for me on his way home last
night.

TOBY
Big deal.
CAROLINE
I'm trying to concentrate on the
good stuff.
Norma appears in the kitchen door, wearing her cap and
gown. She strikes a pose.
NORMA
What d'ya think? I think I look
like a fool.
(shrugs)
Who cares? Six weeks to graduation,
and California, here I come!
Norma snaps her fingers and goes back to her bedroom.
CAROLINE
(lamely)
Seriously: you have to
concentrate on the good stuff.
Caroline turns her attention back to the curtains.

(LATER)
"The Lawrence Welk Show" is ON the TELEVISION. Dwight,
Caroline, Skipper, Norma and Pearl and Toby watch an
Irish tenor sing a lugubrious ballad. Dwight stands in a
corner of the room, his saxophone to his lips. He's
playing along with the MUSIC, but silently.
Occasionally he gets overcome and accidentally causes
the saxophone to squawk.
The Irish ballad ends, and Lawrence Welk's Champagne
Orchestra strikes up a lively polka. Dwight takes a sip
of his drink and grabs Caroline, pulls her to her feet,
and begins to dance with her.
A polka can be a decorous, contained dance. He dances
Caroline vigorously around the living room, out into the
kitchen, around the table, and then back again.
Dwight is really good, and Caroline matches him every
step of the way. Skipper turns the
VOLUME UP and Dwight
kicks the dance into an even higher, wilder gear: The
kids clap on the beat, the two whirl and stamp and spin.
(CONTINUED)
75.
83
CONTINUED:
83
Faster and faster -- Caroline's heel catches an end table
and sends it spinning and faster they go. Caroline's
head is thrown back; she's laughing with pleasure.
As the MUSIC reaches its CLIMAX, Dwight spins Caroline
back to the sofa, lets her go, and WHAM! she lands back
where she was seated exactly on the last note of the
song. Amid the general laughter and applause, Caroline
smiles at Toby.
CAROLINE
(breathy)
Try to find the good stuff, honey.
84
84
Dwight and Toby face one another in the living room.
Both wear their Scout uniforms. Dwight holds a box of
chocolate-coated cherries in one hand.
TOBY
I'm telling you I didn't.
DWIGHT
And I know damn well you did.
TOBY
Well, you're wrong.
DWIGHT
About some things, yeah. Not
about this. You're a goddam hog,
and I proved it.
TOBY
How do you know Skipper didn't eat
it? Or Norma? Or Pearl?
DWIGHT
I told all three of them to stay
away from this candy for twenty-
four hours.
TOBY
Well, how do you know I even ate
any?
DWIGHT
(a triumphant smile)
I counted them. You hogged down
eleven chocolate covered cherries
since yesterday afternoon.
(CONTINUED)
76.
84
CONTINUED:
84
TOBY
So what?
DWIGHT
So that makes you a hog. I just
wanted to establish that fact, and
now I have.
Caroline and Skipper enter, carrying throw pillows and
materials.
DWIGHT
(to Caroline and
Skipper)
Hey. Mr. Hotshot Hog and I've
just been establishing some facts,
and what we come up with is this:
One, he's a pig who gobbles down
everybody's candy; two, he lies
about it; three, he lays around
on his lazy ass day and night
reading, reading; and four, he's
not getting any ten-dollar gym
shoes. That's about what we've
come up with so far.
SKIPPER
Oh, Dad...
DWIGHT
(a high, mincing
voice)
Oh, Dad!
Skipper leaves the room. Caroline sits down, begins to
try various materials as coverings for the pillows.
TOBY
(to Caroline)
Why don't you ever take up for me?
DWIGHT
(to Caroline)
Why don't you ever help me
straighten that boy out?
Caroline doesn't even look up. She threads a needle and
begins to sew. Whilst Dwight paces around the room.
DWIGHT
All he does is read or listen to
records or sing.

I'm so sick of that shit! And
when he isn't singing, he's
watching T.V.
(to Toby)
And don't say you don't 'cause
when I come home I always put my
hand on top of it to see if it's
warm, and it always is. This is
the news, kid -- I'm wise to you.
TOBY
Oh, big, big deal, who cares, and
as long as we're passing out news
here, I don't want to do my paper
route anymore.
DWIGHT
I bet you don't -- big lazy candy
hog like you'd rather lay on his
ass and read, wouldn't you?
Let me tell you something: you're
gonna deliver those papers if I
have to walk behind you with a
horsewhip ever' step of the way.
TOBY
Then give me the money I earn!
DWIGHT
Hell, no. I'm putting that in the
bank for you for when you really
need it -- cuss me now, thank me
later.
TOBY
Mom,
won't you at least make him
let
me have the shoes for gym?
How
can I play basketball without
gym
shoes? I'm the only one who --
Toby stops suddenly. He looks at Dwight for a beat or
two, and then speaks in a different tone:
TOBY
It's not the shoes, is it? Or the
candy. It's me, isn't it? You
just can't stand the fact of me.
Dwight glances at Caroline, who still looks at her
sewing.

I, well, no, it's not that -- I

Your rich daddy 'Duke' doesn't
care anything about you, and so
somebody's got to train you, and
one of the things you've gotta be
trained about is not to be a hog
and eat everybody's candy like a --
Dwight stops short as Caroline says one word.
CAROLINE
Oh.
Dwight and Toby glance at each other nervously.
What

CAROLINE
(her eyes still on
her sewing; soft)
Oh.
DWIGHT
What's the matter, honey?
CAROLINE
(louder)
Oh.
TOBY
DWIGHT
Are you sick, Mom?
Don't you feel good?
CAROLINE
OH-H-H-H!
A furious Caroline raises her head, doubles up both
fists, and yells.
CAROLINE
I.
Will.
Not. Referee.
DWIGHT
(taken aback)
Jack, I think you've made your
mother nervous, so why don't we
just go on to Scouts and let her
rest?
(to Caroline)
You lay down and rest awhile.
Dwight and Toby grab their caps and hotfoot it out the
door.

Father and son photographs are being taken. Dwight is
the only father who wears a complete uniform and cap.
When Dwight and Toby's turn comes, Dwight puts on a big
smile and throws an arm around Toby's shoulder.
DWIGHT
Check for the tongue tonight --
you forgot it last week.
Otherwise you won't get your
life-saving badge.

SAME SCENE - LATER
85A
Six boys are lying on the floor pretending unconscious-
ness. Six other boys, Toby among them, are going through
several life-saving steps such as turning the bodies
over, checking for pulses, etc.
The BOY on whom Toby is working is a heavy, pimple-faced
lout.
Toby checks if the Boy's breathing is obstructed.
Gingerly, he tugs on the Boy's chin, starting to open the
Boy's mouth.
Suddenly the Boy opens his mouth wide, exposing a half-
chewed mass of cheese n' crackers. Toby gives the lout
a knee in the ribs.
TOBY
Bastard.
Swallow that.
BOY
(laughing)
Give my pud a big squeeze while
you're at it, why don't you?
Toby and the life-savers on either side of him laugh a
bit.
86
88
Toby and ten other boys are practicing lay-ups. All the
boys, Toby included, wear basketball uniforms. All the
other boys wear gym shoes. Toby is barefooted. He is
however, a smooth, skillful player.
89
90
A large, ugly DOG next to the box of baseball bats and
gloves GROWLS and snaps at Toby as he goes past.
91

As Toby enters the room, Norma exits, wearing theatrical
makeup and a gypsy costume. Behind her, drink in hand,
sits Dwight, wearing a suit and tie, watching the
TELEVISION NEWS with the SOUND VERY LOW.
TOBY
Whose dog is that on the porch?

DWIGHT
Yours.
TOBY
Mine?

You said you wanted a dog.
TOBY
A collie, though. Not this one.
DWIGHT
Well, he's yours. You paid for him.
Go get ready for Norma's play.
TOBY
What d'you mean I paid for him?
But Dwight doesn't answer.
Toby waits, then shrugs and
leaves the room.

Toby gets out his book of Indian signs.
He reaches up
for his rifle, but it is gone.

Toby walks in, Dwight is petting the dog.
TOBY
My Winchester's gone.
DWIGHT

This dog is pure-bred Weimaraner.
A champion.
TOBY
I don't want it.
DWIGHT

Well, you're purely out of luck,
aren't you, 'cause that rifle's
on its way to Seattle.
TOBY
I want my rifle!

DWIGHT
Well, want in one hand and shit in

Jesus, I
trade some
old piece of
crap for
a valuable
hunting dog,

moan.

Norma, dressed up
for her play, and Pearl are setting the
table. Dwight is
fixing himself another drink. Caroline
enters, puts down
the groceries, and goes to the dish
cabinet. Calmly,
in total control, she takes a PLATE and
SMASHES it against
the countertop.

Am I supposed to go clear to
Seattle just to get...
Before he finishes the sentence, Caroline SMASHES a GLASS
on the countertop.
CAROLINE
Get his rifle back.
DWIGHT
Jesus Christ, woman, I don't even
know the guy's last name.
Caroline picks up a bowl.
DWIGHT
All right, all right. The guy's
supposed to send the A.K.C. papers.
When he sends 'em, I'll know his
name and address, and I'll go get
the god-damn rifle back. Jesus.
Caroline exits leaving Dwight, Norma, and Pearl with
their mouths open.

Arthur is playing the piano. He and Toby sing an old song
called "I Wandered Today To the Hill, Maggie." Both of
them are enjoying it. As they finish the song, Arthur
says a dry "Will you be able to use your musical
abilities at the A&P;?" Toby laughs and gives him a hard
elbow in the ribs.
98
98
Toby is using a nail clipper over a wastebasket when he
hears:
DWIGHT (O.S.)
Heh Hotshot!
He looks up just in time to see a flashlight fly through
the air toward him. He catches it. Dwight stands in
the doorway.
DWIGHT
If you can tear yourself away from
your pedicure, I want you to fetch
me some of that paint from the
attic.
Dwight switches the room light off.
TOBY
Yeah.
DWIGHT
Is now too soon.
TOBY
God!
88.
99

Dwight and Toby are looking for something. They both
shine flashlights around the dark attic, illuminating
old magazines, dolls, etc. Dwight says, "I know I put
'em up here somewhere." Then Toby's flashlight lands
on the unusual tub with the four blue stars which had
held the beaver. Forgotten all this time, the beaver
has transmogrified into a weird, two-foot high pile of
what looks like cotton candy. And, hideously enough,
the cloud-like stuff is still in the shape of the beaver.
Then Dwight says, "Shit -- the roof must've leaked on
'em." Toby turns to where Dwight shines his flashlight
on the ten boxes of chestnuts.
Also forgotten, the chestnuts are
covered with mold,
too -- but a different kind: this
is wet, slick-looking
stuff that rises off the chestnuts
like dough in a
breadpan. A spasm of rage crosses
Toby's face, and he
turns and bangs out of the attic.
100

A drink in one hand, idly fondling Champ's ears with the
other, Dwight is watching the NEWS.
On the TELEVISION we see a distraught Lana Turner
and
her daughter, Cheryl Crane, as the teenaged girl
is
led into a tall building.
While we see this, and
then
a photograph of a stockily handsome Italian man,
we hear:
NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
... Cheryl Crane, daughter of Lana
Turner, was held for questioning
today in the stabbing death of
Johnny Stompanato, Miss Turner's
companion. A spokesman for Miss
Turner said today that the
stabbing was an accident, and that
Miss Turner's daughter will not
spend even one night in jail for
what the spokesman called a
'tragic accident.'
Suddenly aware of another presence in
the room, Dwight
turns and sees Toby, who is standing
in the doorway,
also listening to the NEWSCAST. Toby
is not watching
the television, though, he is staring
fixedly at
Dwight.
Dwight reacts then glances back at the set, where the
Stompanato murder story continues. He turns slowly back
to Toby, whose eyes are still locked onto his face. The
SOUND on the TV FADES.
89.
101
101
A WHISTLE FADES UP.
Toby's basketball game against the Van Horn team is
starting. Alone among all the other players, Toby wears
his street shoes. Heavy squarish brogans, they CLOMP,
and THUD as Toby runs up and down the court.
The leather soles slip like skates on the highly-polished
floor, and Toby falls repeatedly. At first the crowd is
silent, collectively embarrassed at the boy wearing these
strange shoes. Then Toby takes a particularly hard fall,
and somebody laughs. The crowd in general takes it up,
and soon there is GENERAL LAUGHTER whenever Toby's shoes
SQUEAL particularly loudly, or whenever the shoes trip
him up or cause another boy to stumble.
Soon one WOMAN'S HIGH-PITCHED LAUGH DOMINATES the
gymnasium. The laugh is hideous, shrill and mindless,
like some ringer planted in the audience of a situation
comedy.
Toby sees Norma necking with some guy and is horrified.
Toby slips and slides, falls and rises. All the while
his expression is hard as stone: he will get through
this or die. And, like a mantra, he mutters one phrase
over and over: "gotta get out, gotta get out, gotta get
out, gotta get out." Finally he makes a basket. One
VOICE from the audience YELLS out "Okay, kid -- way
to go!" and then two or three people APPLAUD. Instants
later, Toby catches a rebound and makes another basket.
The fickle crowd decides to love an underdog and APPLAUDS
heartily for the boy in the funny shoes. But Toby's
expression never changes.

The Buick, rolls silently down the driveway pushed by a
straining but cautious Toby. Champ runs into the street,
Toby tries to shoo him away. The DOG BARKS ONCE, and
Toby quickly opens the car door and lets him in, STARTING
the ENGINE.
103
103
Toby drives fast leaving Concrete behind. He turns the
RADIO ON, and a VOICE bawls out "Oh, Maybelline," Toby
turns the VOLUME UP, turns it UP AGAIN, so that the MUSIC
is DISTORTED. Toby begins to accelerate. The needle
creeps past ninety, and hovers close to one hundred.

Trees flash past in the headlights, occasional cars are
overtaken and passed in an instant. Toby starts laughing
hysterically and sings loudly along with the THROBBING
MUSIC.
The Buick begins to shudder and wobble -- Toby hits the
brakes but the Buick spins and goes sideways into the
ditch. SILENCE.

As the car barrels through downtown Concrete, we see a
movie marquee reading...

... The Apartment, and a five foot poster that says,
"ELECT JOHN KENNEDY, 1960."
In the back seat, Psycho pours vodka into a half empty
can of Hawaiian punch, then takes a huge swig.
PSYCHO
(screams it)
Ag-Hhh! Gorilla blood.
JERRY
Oh, Psycho, shut up.
CHUCK
(pointing)
Oh, look -- there goes Carol
Baumgarten. Ain't she sweet?
She's hot for Wolff.
TOBY
I wish.
CHUCK
Won't do her any good, though --
Jack's saving himself for Rhea
Clark.
TOBY
Knock it off.
JERRY
You know what he said about Rhea?
Said even the inside of her arm

Wolff. She is pretty though.
ARCH

wistful)
I'd sure like to eat Rhea Clark's

There is general laughter, mixed with groans.

It sounds good to them.
PSYCHO

Pearl is setting the table and singing the Everly
Brothers hit, "Bye, Bye, Love." The passage of two years
has improved Pearl. Her bald spot has grown back in, and
she has learned to fix her hair and use makeup. She smiles
and nods to Toby, never stopping her singing for a moment.
Toby stands next to her and sings harmony for a few notes.
It is clear that their relationship has improved. Toby
stops singing.
TOBY
Where's Mom?
Still singing, Pearl points to the living room.
112
112
Caroline is watching a newscast of John Kennedy and Harry
Truman at a press conference outside Truman's Missouri
office. She hears Toby, turns to him.
We see that the last two years have marked her. She's
changed. Her expression is fixed, almost as if she were
wearing a mask. Even the words are cheerful, but some of
the old optimism is gone.
CAROLINE
Oh, honey, good news -- Truman's
going to campaign for him.
(lowers her voice)
I gave twenty-five dollars to his
campaign office today. I've been
thinking I'd like to work...
She is interrupted by Dwight's voice O.S.

DWIGHT (O.S.)
Here I am, you lucky people!
Toby and Caroline exchange a glance.
It speaks volumes.
113
113
Dwight, Caroline, Toby and Pearl sit at the table, eat-
ing. Champ sits by Dwight's chair -- obviously his dog.
Dwight seems unchanged by the two years.
Just now, Dwight is in the middle of telling another of
his "Dwight Is The Best" stories. From the bored faces
around the table, this is another in a long series.
DWIGHT
... So the S.O.B. had been on my
back for a week at work, okay?
Sayin' I stole his wrench, an'
poured oil all over his tools, as
if! Anyway, he went just one step
too far with old Dwight, okay?
Spat on the floor as I walked by.
I turned around and walked back
to him, acting so dainty and
humble and scared, you know, all
innocent -- and the minute he took
his eyes off me, BLAM, I dry
gulched him! I shut his water off
good! Never gave me another
second's grief to this very day.
There is a pause.
One more story.
Nobody has much of a
reaction.
CAROLINE
I heard Kennedy on the news again
tonight -- I don't know: I hate
the Democrats and the Republicans,
but then once in a while somebody
comes along who doesn't seem
like...
(she searches)
... a liar.
DWIGHT
Kennedy -- the senator from Rome.
CAROLINE
He gives me hope.
DWIGHT
I know what he gives you, and it
sure as hell isn't hope.
(CONTINUED)
96.
113
CONTINUED:
113
CAROLINE
(laughs)
It's true he is attractive! And
it may just be those white teeth
that I respond to. But I don't
think so.
(a beat)
I'm going to work for his campaign.
DWIGHT
No. Too many Republicans
in this
town. They hear my wife's
working
for the Democrats, they'll
take
their cars someplace else
to be
fixed. Bad idea. No.
There is a brief silence. Suddenly Caroline leans across
the table and speaks to Dwight in a loud, exaggerated
disappointed whine:
CAROLINE
Oh, Rickyyy!
(louder; same whine)
Oh, Ricky-y-y! Please let me
come down and work at the club!
DWIGHT
What the hell are you doing?
CAROLINE
Well, you treat me like Lucy,
I'll act like her. I'll be
working for Kennedy's campaign.
114
114
The four of them are watching "The Untouchables." We
watch as a frightened man speaks to Al Capone, who sits
behind a large desk.
FRIGHTENED MAN (V.O.)
(on T.V.)
... please, Mr. Capone, it'll never
happen again, I swear it. It was
an accident. I can promise you
faithfully it won't be repeated.
Finally Al Capone speaks.
He leans across his desk, bugs
out his eyes, and hisses:

AL CAPONE (V.O.)

Why don't you take a little ride

The man's eyes bulge with fear, and he cries, "No!

as two men escort him out the door.
In the next shot we see a long black car parked on a
country road, and we hear a SHOT.
115
115
Toby is brushing his teeth when Dwight enters.
TOBY
I'll be through in a minute.
Dwight looks around.
DWIGHT
You left the lid off the damn
toothpaste again.
TOBY
(not looking at him)
Oh, Dwight, is that the best you
can come up with?
Angered, but keeping his voice low.
He pushes Toby's
shoulder.
DWIGHT
This is my bathroom, and I say
about the toothpaste, got it?
(pushes again)
Huh? Have you? Huh? Now if you
lived with your daddy Duke and
his rich wife, maybe things'd be
different, but he's not here now,
is he?
(high, flutey voice)
Oh, Duke? Duke, are you here?
Dukie? Oh, how sad -- Duke's not
here. Oh, boo hoo!
(normal voice)
My bathroom. I get to say. Got
that?
Still Toby doesn't respond -- Dwight reaches out and
pinches the skin on Toby's waist, hard. Toby still
doesn't respond, when Dwight begins to twist it. Toby
spins around, eyes blazing.
(CONTINUED)
98.
115
CONTINUED:
115
DWIGHT
Come on. Oh, come on.
Give me
an excuse.
Toby hesitates, then leaves the bathroom, humiliated.
116
116
Toby exits the bathroom, then sees Caroline in a doorway.
She's heard it all. They look intently at each other.
Toby nods and walks on down the hall.
117
117
Furious, Toby throws himself onto the bed, and snaps on
a reading light.
(Behind him, the wall is now completely papered with
the front pages of the Scout magazine, so that we see
the words BOY'S LIFE BOY'S LIFE BOY'S LIFE BOY'S LIFE
repeated one hundred and twenty times.) Then Toby takes
a slick brochure from under his pillow -- it's a bro-
chure of Princeton. Photographs of beautifully tended
lawns, and students on their way to class. Toby stares
at the photographs, smoothing the pages carefully, long-
ing in his face.
118
118
Toby bangs onto the bus, throws himself into a seat
beside Arthur. He hands a grade card to Toby.
ARTHUR
You didn't pick this up yesterday
-- congratulations, you got
nothing higher than a C.
TOBY
Shut up.
He signs the grade card, saying, "Presto."
ARTHUR
You're gonna get caught some day.
(as Toby laughs a
moronic laugh)
You act more like those morons you
hang around with every day. Aghhh!
I'm psycho! I'm retarded!
(CONTINUED)
99.
118
CONTINUED:
118
It's a good imitation of Psycho, and Toby laughs.
TOBY
He hears you do that, you're
dead. Hey, lemme copy your math
homework.
ARTHUR
No, but I'll show you how to work
the problems.
TOBY
I tell you I'm thirsty, you offer
me a sandwich thank you and fuck
you.
ARTHUR
Oh, Jack.
TOBY
Oh, Jaaack!
ARTHUR
I take it back you don't act like
Psycho, you act like Dwight.
TOBY
(new tone)
I know it. He's winning. I do
act like him. I feel like him
sometimes. I've gotta get out of
this place or I'm a dead one.
ARTHUR
I know, but you've said that for
two years.
TOBY
I mean it. I may go live with my
brother Gregory in Princeton.
ARTHUR
You mean the brother Gregory in
Princeton who never calls you?
That brother Gregory?
TOBY
He wrote me.
ARTHUR
And he asked you to live with him?
(CONTINUED)
100.
118
CONTINUED:

118
TOBY
No. But I'm going. Or maybe I
could go to a prep school like
Gregory did. Like my dad did.
ARTHUR
What about your grades? And what
would you use for money?
TOBY
I don't know. Dwight owes me
over twelve hundred bucks! If I
hadn't let him keep my paper
route money, I'd be okay.
ARTHUR
If the dog hadn't stopped to pee,
he'd have caught the rabbit.
Suddenly Toby is angry.
He stands up, moves to another
seat.
TOBY
I think Dwight was right about
you I think you fight for the pink
team.
Toby falls into another seat, then, pulls his head back
and bangs it against the window. Then does it again,
harder.
119
122
Toby enters the small office where Caroline is running
hundreds of flyers on a duplicating machine. Surprised
she sees Toby's expression.
CAROLINE
What is it?
TOBY
I called Gregory at Princeton.
(as Caroline reacts)
He's sending me applications for
prep schools. I need you to
take me to Seattle to take some
entrance exams.
CAROLINE
Would a prep school take you
with, uh, your school record?
TOBY
I've got to get out of here, Mom.
I've got to. I've got to get
away.
CAROLINE
When are the tests?
TOBY
Saturday.
CAROLINE
You'll be there.
TOBY
He won't let you have the Buick.
CAROLINE
You'll be there!
123
124
Twenty-three boys and Toby stand waiting restlessly for
the tests to begin. Toby looks very different from the
other intelligent looking, well-bred boys in his Elvis
hairdo.

SAME SCENE - LATER
124A
All the boys are taking the test, working hard.
125

Caroline turns as Toby gets into the car.
CAROLINE
How was it?
TOBY
Hard. I think I did okay.
I'll
know Monday.
104.
126
126
Dwight sits at the table, a drink in his hand. Caroline
hurriedly prepares dinner. She tosses a milk carton into
a brimming waste basket, then speaks to Toby, who enters
the room.
CAROLINE
Take that trash out for me,
honey.
Toby grabs the trash and exits.
127
128
Toby walks in, fans out the four envelopes, speaks to
Caroline.
TOBY
My application forms must've come
today, and he threw them away.
DWIGHT
Hey, I thought I was helping
him -- thought I'd save him some
trouble 'cause he's got no chance
of getting into some fancy prep
school.
CAROLINE
You've always got your nose
pressed up against the bake shop
window, don't you, Dwight?
DWIGHT
What?
CAROLINE
You feel like everybody else is
inside, and you're stuck on the
outside. It turns you mean. It
turns you ugly. And one day do
you hear me, Dwight? One day all
that ugliness is going to snap
back and hit you in the face.

DWIGHT
Ooooooh, oh, I'm so scared.
Oooh.

Toby has the applications open in front of him. We
see the words "Official Transcript Required" on one
application. On another we see spaces for the ap-
plicant to list "Community Services" and "Athletic
Achievements" and "Foreign Travel" and "Languages." Toby
looks despairingly at the forms.
130
130
Between classes, Toby and Arthur are at a row of lockers.
ARTHUR
I won't do it.
TOBY
But why? You work right in the
office -- nobody'll ever know.
ARTHUR
I'm surprised you'd want help from
anybody who fights for the pink
team.
TOBY
I'm asking you to help me, man.
I got word yesterday that I did
really well on those tests -- but
that's not enough. I've got to
cheat and lie -- but I don't care:
this is my one chance to get out
of here!
ARTHUR
No. Why should you get to be the
one? Why not me?
131
131
Toby is working with a table saw. Suddenly a two-inch-
thick manilla envelope plops down beside him. He looks
up to see Arthur standing beside him. Glancing around to
see that he's unobserved, he checks the contents of the
envelope: we see school stationery, blank transcript
forms, and a stack of official envelopes. Toby closes
his eyes. He's saved.
(CONTINUED)

TOBY
You could leave too, you know.
ARTHUR
No, I've grown progressively fond
of Concrete. I think I'll stay
here all alone and dress up in my
mama's old clothes sometimes --
like you said.
Arthur turns and
swishes away. Toby pats
the manilla
envelope, turns
back to the saw. Suddenly
he jerks,
looks down, and
sees that the ring finger
of his left
hand is spurting
blood. Toby says a mild,
astonished
"Hey," and sinks
to his knees.
132
132
With his hand bandaged Toby sits at a typewriter with
a blank transcript. He carefully types "TOBIAS WOLFF."
Then, he begins to type the letter "A" in every slot for
grades.
133
134
Toby lies in bed reading the paper. He still holds his
hand in the air (the white bandage is now dingy).
Caroline appears in the doorway.
CAROLINE
Come help me stuff envelopes.
TOBY
I'll do some this afternoon.
CAROLINE
No, I need to take them with me.
TOBY
I'll be in in a minute.
Let me
finish this article.

DWIGHT.
Toby laughs, and gets up to help her.
135
137
Dwight, Caroline and Toby read the papers.
Caroline
notices Toby's sad face.
CAROLINE
Maybe that last school will
come through.
DWIGHT
Yeah, or maybe he'll get a
contract in the mail asking him
to be a singing star on T.V.
(on Caroline's look)
Well, he's got about as much
chance of one as of the other.
Toby gets up and leaves.

Toby, wearing khakis, a shirt and a tie stands before
the store manager.
MANAGER
We only take boys who really want
to work hard. Is that you?
(as Toby nods)
I'd want you to start evenings
now, and I'd want you all summer
-- no vacations.
(as Toby nods)
Food service work isn't easy.
It's not something that comes to
you in a year or two. So. You
think you have what it takes to
be an A&P; management trainee?
TOBY
(straight)
That's exactly what I've got.

Toby now wears a regulation black bow tie and an apron.
An employee is showing him how to price, stamp, and stack
canned goods. Toby's face is expressionless.

Dwight is listening to a PERRY COMO ALBUM.
Caroline and
Pearl work on a jigsaw puzzle. Toby enters
the kitchen,
coming from his paper route. He puts down
his paper sack
and immediately puts on his black bow tie,
preparing to
go to the A&P.;

PEARL
I can't find where this green piece

Dwight sighs with irritation at the interruption of his
listening pleasure, and turns UP the VOLUME on the record.
CAROLINE
(to Toby)
Don't go off without eating.
TOBY
I'll get a sandwich after work.
Exasperated that conversation is continuing when he's
trying to listen, Dwight reaches over, presses his hand
down on the arm of the record player, then SCRAPES it
back and forth on the record. It's a violent action, and
it makes a GROTESQUE SOUND. The NEEDLE BOUNCES around
on the scarred record. As the three of them stare at
him, Dwight speaks calmly:
DWIGHT
I was trying to listen to a
record.
Dwight rises, walks outside into the back yard. Then
the TELEPHONE RINGS. Pearl answers it, listens, then
says,
PEARL
"Yeah, he's here,"
She holds the receiver out to Toby, whispering, "Are
you Tobias?"
TOBY
Hello? All right.
Tomorrow, then.
Goodbye.
Toby hangs up, turns to Caroline, quietly:
TOBY
It's Hill School -- the last one
I applied to. They haven't
accepted me, but they're sending
somebody up to interview me.
Caroline upsets the puzzle getting up to hug Toby.

Toby is sitting in a booth with MR. HOWARD, a man in his
late thirties.
Toby has made a real attempt to look good.
His hair is
modified, and he wears a tie and a suit.
TOBY
... Yeah, I enjoy my classes,
especially the ones that are
advanced, but I've been feeling
a little restless lately. It's
hard to explain.
MR. HOWARD
Well, you're probably bored. Not
being challenged. Your application
was very good, Toby, but we have
many boys who want to go to Hill.
Not everybody is comfortable at a
prep school.
TOBY
I think I would be. My father
and brother went to prep schools.
MR. HOWARD
Is that right?
Where?
TOBY
Deerfield and Choate.
Mr. Howard is impressed.
MR. HOWARD
I see. Well, maybe you'd like it.
Hill was difficult for me, though
-- classes were hard, and the boys
seemed cold -- interested in money
and social position.
(laughs)
And I hated those snowy
Pennsylvania winters! But then
in my last year, something changed.
The guys in my class grew close,
so close that I still think of
them as a second family.
TOBY
(honest)
I want that. I do, and --

141
He stops
talking as we hear, O.S., "AG-H-H-H!" Psycho and
Arch have
entered the drugstore. Toby's back is to the
door, and
he slouches deeper into the booth, praying that
he won't
be seen.
Arch and Psycho buy cigarettes.
ARCH
... so she said, 'No, I don't want
you to do that,' and I said 'Oh,
baby, let me get down and grovel
on it.' I mean, I ate her pussy
'til my tongue was calloused, and
then...
Arch moves toward the
back of the store toward the area
where Toby sits. Toby
inches down a bit farther into the
booth. Arch stops at
a sunglass rack five feet from Toby
and tries on a couple
of pairs.
ARCH
... so anyway, she went off like a
Roman candle -- I mean that woman
can scream. I said, 'You liked
that, didn't you, baby?' I said,
'You liked the old Arch Cook
special, didn't you?'
Arch decides to let the sunglasses go. He and Psycho
move toward the front of the store, he talks about pussy.
Toby exhales.
MR. HOWARD
Toby, boys at Hill talk roughly
sometimes too -- you'd have to
be ready for that. I can see
you've had sort of a sheltered
life.
Toby nods his head.
142
143
A few weeks have passed. Toby (his Elvis hairdo further
modified) again prices and stacks food. His face is
serious, his manner industrious.
144
144
Toby walks in; his Elvis hair disappearing.
Pearl, who
is boiling hot dogs, turns:
PEARL
I know something'll make you feel
good: that man called -- you got
the scholarship.
Toby grits his teeth and clenches both fists victoriously.
He's won.

PEARL
He said they're gonna give you two
thousand three hundred dollars a
year and it costs two thousand
five hundred dollars... so you
gotta come up with the other two
hundred. Great, huh?
(sympathetic)
I'm making hot dogs -- I'll make
one for you. Can you put mustard
on some bread for us?
Toby gets a jar of mustard from a cupboard, but it's
empty, so he tosses it on top of the trash can, gets a
new jar and starts to open it.
Dwight enters.
PEARL
What're you doing home so earl...
Oh! Toby he got that scholarship
-- two thousand and three hundred
dollars!
Dwight makes himself a drink, takes two large swallows,
then turns to Toby.
DWIGHT
Hey, leopard. I say, 'Hey,
leopard.' I know you, leopard --
I can see those spots you can't
change.
(laughs)
Thinks he can go to some fancy
prep school and fool everybody.
Not a chance. I know a thing or
two about a thing or two.
Toby won't rise to the bait, and Dwight falls silent, he,
looks around and sees the jar of mustard on top of the
trash.
DWIGHT
Who threw that away?
TOBY
I did.
DWIGHT
Why?
TOBY
Because it was empty.

Dwight retrieves the bottle. There are a few streaks
of mustard under the neck of the bottle. He holds it
close to Toby's face.
DWIGHT
Empty?
That look empty to you?
PEARL
It looks empty to me.
TOBY
It looks empty to me, too.
Dwight pushes the jar against Toby's eye, leaving mustard
stains on the boy's face.
DWIGHT
Look again, hotshot.
Is it empty?
Toby jerks his head away, not answering. Dwight slams
down the jar of mustard, grabs Toby by the back of the
hair and forces his face down against the mustard jar.
PEARL
Dad!
DWIGHT
(to Toby)
Now. Now, Mr. Big-Time Prep-
School fucker, is it empty?
Toby struggles, but Dwight has the strength of anger:
trying always to protect his throbbing finger, Toby
pulls free and jumps up from the table. Dwight is too
quick for Toby, though: he grabs an even bigger handful
of hair and forces Toby's face down onto the mustard
jar again and again. And again. Each time he asks if
the jar is empty. Finally, Toby gives up.
TOBY
(muffled)
No, it wasn't empty.
DWIGHT
(lets him go)
All right -- clean it out.
His face smeared with mustard, Toby's expression is
murderous. He picks up a knife and scrapes at the mus-
tard, trying to get up under the neck. He manages to
get a few brown and yellow smudges on the knife, which
he transfers to the edge of a plate. Dwight watches.
(CONTINUED)

144
DWIGHT
Now.
Was it empty?
Slowly he stands up and faces Dwight.
TOBY
Yes!
Dwight slaps Toby across the mouth and the battle is on.
As Pearl stands frozen, Toby lunges at Dwight, they
grapple and stagger around the room. GLASS SHATTERS, the
kitchen table CRASHES over, and their feet STAMP and
SHUFFLE but Toby is a wild man. Even though he has
only one good hand. He lands a blow between Dwight's
eyes that bangs the man back against the wall.
Dwight grabs the pan with the hot water from the hotdogs,
flings it at Toby. Most of it misses. Again they
grapple. Toby manages to throw Dwight down, then grabs a
broom that has fallen to the floor, presses it against
Dwight's throat, using his good hand and one knee.
Dwight's mouth gapes wide, his eyes bulge, and he jerks
himself frantically trying to dislodge Toby, but Toby
hangs on like grim death. Desperate, Dwight grabs Toby's
bandaged hand, bringing it close to his own face, and
bites the stump of Toby's injured finger as hard as he
can.
Toby and Pearl scream simultaneously. Pearl in horror,
Toby in pain. Pearl runs into her bedroom. Toby reels
back in pain, holding his freshly-bleeding hand. Dwight
takes his chance, grabs Toby by the throat, forces him
down onto the floor and begins to choke the boy. Toby's
eyelids begin to flutter. He's losing consciousness.
WHAM!
From out of nowhere a baseball bat hits Dwight flat
across the shoulder blades, knocking the breath out
of
him, stunning him momentarily. As he looks up, we
see
Caroline, one of the baseball bats from the utility
porch
drawn back, aimed at Dwight's head, ready to strike
again.
CAROLINE
(level)
Get away from him or I will kill
you.
Toby manages to stand up, Caroline speaks to both of them.
CAROLINE
What is this?

TOBY
I got the scholarship and he went
nuts. He's crazy, and I'm leaving.
(screams it)
I'm leaving!
DWIGHT
Great.
Go!
TOBY
Give me my paper route money, and
you'll never have to see my face
again.
DWIGHT
(manages a smile)
That money is gone with the wind.
(as Toby stares)
That's right. I spent it as you
made it. It's gone. Poof.
Toby starts for Dwight again. Caroline grabs him, saying,
"No. No. No," over and over, literally dragging Toby
away from Dwight.
Caroline looks at Dwight.
CAROLINE
It's not so much that you're
disappointing -- it's that you're
consistently disappointing.
DWIGHT
Oh, fancy, fancy talk -- fancy
talk for a whore.
I know a thing
or two about a thing or two. I
got friends in this town that tell
me things, and I found out some man
down at that campaign headquarters
found you a job in Washington, D.C.
Gonna run off with him, aren't
you, Miss Whore?
CAROLINE
He's just a friend.
DWIGHT
Miss Liar.
Miss Whore Liar.
TOBY
I'm leaving, Mom. You can leave,
too. You don't have to stay here.

Caroline takes three full beats and then her face
changes. She speaks wonderingly:
CAROLINE
I don't, do I?
TOBY
No, you don't.
CAROLINE
I could leave with you, couldn't
I?
TOBY
Yes, you could!
DWIGHT
What about me?
CAROLINE
I could just walk right out that
door, couldn't I?
TOBY
Yes, you could!
Caroline takes a deep breath, a weight has been lifted.
CAROLINE
My God... the lightness.
DWIGHT
What about me?
CAROLINE
I'm leaving, too.
DWIGHT
No.
CAROLINE
Oh, Dwight, why do you want me to
stay? You don't even like me,
not really.
DWIGHT
You're not leaving!
CAROLINE
(gentle)
Look again, Dwight -- I'm already
gone.

Dwight makes a terrible noise of frustration and rage,
doubles his fists, and starts toward Caroline.
Immediately Toby grabs the baseball bat and holds it
out, ready to strike, as the two begin to back toward
the door.
DWIGHT
... you two've always sided in
against me, always thought you
were better than me. I tried. I
did the best I could. What about
me? Am I supposed to just crawl
off in a ditch someplace and die?
I've always been the nigger.
Everybody's nigger. Ever since I
was little.
Caroline and Toby are at the door, run across the yard
and down the street. Dwight stands in the doorway,
yelling:
DWIGHT
What about me? When is it ever
Dwight's turn for some
consideration? What about me?
I'll tell you one thing --
you'll remember me!
