In f.g. is the U.S.S. RELIANT, an older, somewhat
battered starship of the ENTERPRISE class, with a
slightly different configuration. Reliant approaches
an inhospitable-looking yellow planet: CETI ALPHA V
CHEKOV'S VOICE
Starship log, Stardate 8130.4.
This report classified MOST SECRET.
Log Entry by Commander Pavel Chekov,
Duty Officer. Starship USS Reliant
on orbital approach with Ceti Alpha
VI in connection with project code
name GENESIS. We are continuing
our search for a lifeless planet
which will serve as a suitable test
site for the Genesis Experiments.
This is the 16th planet we have
visited, so far, no success.

A functional cluster of modules serve as a scientific
complex, a futuristic White Sands, orbiting a small
barren plantoid in b.g.: Regula.
CAROL MARCUS'S VOICE

Something you can transplant? I
don't know --

orbiting Ceti Alpha V.
VOICES OVER indicate the transporter room is ready.

14
A YELLOW PLANET, in constant SWIRLING HURRICANE WINDS
OF SAND. Terrell and Chekov materialize. Their VOICES,
filtered, are hard to make out.
With the TRICORDER to guide them, they set out...
TERRELL
Are you sure these are the
coordinates?
CHEKOV
Captain, this is the garden spot
of Ceti Alpha VI --
TERRELL
I can hardly see --
15
SEVERAL ANGLES
15
The difficult search, the men leaning into the wind --
16
TERRELL
16
is ahead of Chekov on a slight rise --
CHEKOV
There's nothing, let's go --
17
ANGLE
17
Terrell waves him frantically forward. As Chekov
moves up, we rise with him to the top of the ridge and
look down.
18
ANGLE - THEIR POV
18
A RUINED SERIES OF MAN-MADE STRUCTURES, half buried in
sand. They look at each other in consternation. Chekov
is worried; something about all this is familiar.
They descend towards the structures, now seen to be the
wreckage of some sort of space craft.
They pass but do not notice the FEDERATION LOGO, half
buried next to their feet.
TERRELL
They look like cargo carriers...
As Chekov looks at the porthole, a face suddenly looks
back! It is the face of a CHILD! The Apparition
scares the daylights out of Chekov -- and us. He
screams.
TERRELL
(continuing)
What is it?
He comes clumsily over --
CHEKOV
A face! I saw -- it was like a
child --
He points. The porthole is empty.
TERRELL
You're crazy -- !
CHEKOV
I saw it -- !
TERRELL
There's an air-lock.
He points and they go into the airlock.
19
22
Terrell and Chekov emerge, helmeted, then stop dead.
23
ANGLE - THEIR POV
23
A RING OF SUITED FIGURES has them surrounded.
24
28
A SPACE SHUTTLE moving toward us.
29
30
The shuttle approaches the mammoth airstrip. As we
near the ship, a few WORK CREWS IN SPACE flit about
her hull, working.
31
31
The shuttle makes its way to the Docking Lock of the
mother ship and settles in place.
32
36
The dock slowly folds away from the ship.
37
39
as the ship slowly and majestically leaves the dock.
40
41
The ship clears the dock and begins heading into space.
42
43
She gathers speed into the vastness of space.
44
44
moving towards us, in opposition to the previous shot,
close enough for us to read her markings.
45
46
47
51
In no particular hurry.
52
55
cruising.
56
57
The ship accelerates, and then, with an eye-filled
burst, whips ahead to warp speed, disappearing.
57A
58
Floating quietly around the planet below. Tranquil
as we PUSH SLOWLY IN.
OVER we can hear, FILTERED, UHURA'S VOICE:
UHURA'S VOICE
Regula I, this is Enterprise. This
is Enterprise calling. Do you
receive... I say...
59
70
Boring forward ominously.
71
73
The two ships are very close, barely moving as they inch
toward each other.
74
76
Reliant firing phasers at Enterprise. A hit in the rear
of the engine room area, debris flying into the void.
77
85
circling Enterprise.
86
88
We can see Reliant making a large arc as she prepares to
come back for another round.
89
90
Reliant continues her slow arc.
91
92
Reliant, her arc completed, is coming back.
93
99
Enterprise fires at Reliant inflicting heavy damage.
100
101
Reliant turns away.
102
ENTERPRISE BRIDGE
102
They watch on screen as Reliant hauls off.
SULU
(breathless)
Sir, you did it.
KIRK
(enraged)
I did nothing -- except get caught
with my britches down. I must be
senile. Mr. Saavik, you just keep
right on quoting regulations.
Meantime, let's find out what the
hell is going on and see how bad
we've been --
The turbo doors whoosh open as Kirk reaches them.
Scotty stands there, tears streaming down his face;
he holds the body of Midshipman Preston. Both of them
are covered in blood. He sways into Kirk's arms as
the others rush forward.
103
103
The Enterprise, motionless, scars of battle showing.
104
107
Regula, the dead planet beyond.
108
108
Approaching. As she moves slowly PAST CAMERA, WE PAN
WITH her TO SEE that she is approaching the space lab.
109
112
CLOSER ANGLE now. The silence is ominous.
113
123
CAMERA MOVES TOWARD it as the BEAM SOUND continues,
with irregularity. The plantoid is ugly and dead.
The sound frightens us, and climaxes with:
124
135
Reliant, motionless in a parking orbit.
136
150
Dark side of Gamma. Reliant sits idle.
150A
154
Reliant ominously pokes her nose into the lit side of
the planet, heading for Enterprise.
155
161
WE CAN SEE NOW where Enterprise is: she has slipped
behind the plantoid, clockwise, even as Reliant was
rounding into the lighted side.
162
166A
ENTERPRISE STARTS MOVING.
167
169
The Enterprise whooshes by CAMERA leaving Regula
behind. Reliant now appears in far b.g. and CAMERA
BEGINS A MOVE to her.
170
171
Reliant moves to and past CAMERA in hot pursuit.
172
172
Call them SPACE-BYS. Enterprise rushes TOWARD US,
flashes BY and CONTINUES towards the swirling nebula.
THEN Reliant does the same, closer in pursuit. At
this moment, half the distance between Regula and
the nebula has been covered.
173
174
Orientation, SHOT. Reliant can clearly see where
Enterprise is headed --
175
177
Reliant's shot crosses Enterprise's bow --
178
182
WE'RE VERY CLOSE NOW, and SEE CLEARLY the swirling,
slowly moving gases, magenta, purple, etc. There are
veils of luminescent materials and through all an
interlace of unpredictable electrical charges.
Like lightning, these intermittent great flashes
illumine whole sections of the nebula. OUR VIEW is
moving slowly forward...
183
184
As Enterprise whooshes into the PICTURE headed into the
purplish gas -- and disappears into a cloud bank of
the stuff.
A moment then Reliant APPEARS, pursues Enterprise into
the gloom, also disappears.
185
186
Cautiously Reliant emerges from a massive "cloudbank."
Electrical discharges abound. Barely moving, she feels
her way forward. Alone.
187
AS THE ANGLE WIDENS
187
A treat: Enterprise is above and behind Reliant.
188
189
The bounce causes Sulu's phaser shot to go wide of
Reliant, amid CRACKLING discharges --
190
191
Reliant is wide of the mark with a Photon torpedo.
A BLINDING ELECTRICAL DISCHARGE. When it clears,
Enterprise appears to be alone.
192
193
Enterprise feeling its way...
194
ON BRIDGE - POV ON SCREEN
194
All peer into the lousy picture. Occasional electrical
flashes.
195
195
Still Enterprise moves forward... A LARGE FLASH... a
SUDDEN GLIMPSE: Reliant boring in on collision course!
196
200
The Enterprise fires a phaser and delivers a raking shot
-- which rips along the side of Reliant's primary hull.
200A
204
Reliant in purplish mass, banking slightly, completing
a long turn, then boring ahead.
205
OMITTED
205
206
206
As Reliant emerges from the dark blue mass into a clear
almost tranquil place. Reliant, moving slowly, stops,
as if looking around.
207
208
Reliant motionless in the f.g. amid occasional flashes.
Now, behind Reliant and from below, like a great whale
rising from the depths, Enterprise rises vertically,
slowly passing the unsuspecting enemy. When Enterprise
is above, behind and quite close:
209
fires torpedo; one which hits, destroying Reliant's
weapons pod on top.
B)
fires two more times. The first causes general
damage. The second, close behind blasts Reliant's
port engine off into space, debris scattering.
E)
211
Reliant, now a scarred, battered hulk, her main hull
still intact, but dead in space.
212
215
Enterprise backs away from Reliant. Her speed is pain-
fully slow.
216
220
The WHINE increasing, the dead ship Reliant alive with
danger...
221
221
A snail's pace compared to the escape speed needed.
222
228
Enterprise still well within the nebula, Reliant a
figure still visible in b.g. She's crawling still.
229
230
A)
With a burst of warp speed, Enterprise accelerates
out of the lazy pace and whooshes PUT OF SCENE,
leaving Reliant behind.
B)
POV RELIANT
disappearing in the swirls of:
C)
POV MUTARA NEBULA
which clears the flame and --
D)
ENTERPRISE
roaring through space -- and:
E)
RELIANT
The WHINE increases to fever pitch, then: she goes!
F)
As Reliant goes, so goes the nebula. The "Genesis
Effect" WE SAW in its earliest experiments, now
seems familiar on a gigantic, cosmic scale.
The blinding flash at first, followed by the same
tumbling turbulence of the miniature test. It is
awesome.
231
233
The clouds tumble and move, new things lie beyond --
234
237
A spectacular look at Carol's planet being born!

CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL
239
the Ship's Company in full dress uniforms assembled for
ship's burial service. Over the PULLBACK, we HEAR:
KIRK
In accordance with the traditions
of Starfleet and of Article 184
Starfleet Regulations, we are
assembled here today to pay final
respects to our honored dead.
Carol and David are PROMINENTLY FEATURED. David watching
Kirk attentively. So are Sulu, Uhura, Chekov, and Saavik.
Bones stands next to Kirk. Scotty carries his bagpipes.
Saavik wears her hair down.
KIRK
(continuing)
And yet, in the midst of our sorrow
it should be noted that this death
takes place in the shadow of new
life, the sunrise of a new world,
a world that our beloved comrade
gave his own life to protect and
nourish. He did not feel that
sacrifice a vain or empty one --
and we will not debate his profound
wisdom, in these proceedings. Of
my friend, I can only say this, that
of all the souls I have encountered
in my travels, his was the most --
(he falters)
-- human.
He tries to go on, but catches Bones' face: Bones is
streaming tears. Kirk can't go on.
KIRK
(continuing)
Lieutenant Saavik.

241
Saavik steps forward.
SAAVIK
We commend the soul of our brother
departed. We love we commit his
body to the depths of space.
SULU
Honors -- hup!
All Starfleet personnel salute. Scotty begins to PIPE,
an odd blare which mellows into Amazing Grace. Kirk
nods a signal.
242
THE CAPSULE
242
A gleaming black projectile is carried by pallbearers
into the launching chamber, which locks behind it. At
a hand signal from a TORPEDOMAN, the projectile is fired.
NOISE.
243
243
Spock's remains seen on their way to the new world.
The capsule grows too small to SEE. The bagpipes STOP.
244
246
The Enterprise passes the new planet in all its beauty.
247
248
SPOCK'S VOICE
Space, the final frontier... These
are the continuing voyages of the
Starship Enterprise... Her ongoing
mission: to explore strange new
worlds... to seek out new life and
new civilizations... To boldly go
where no man has gone before...
She is moving out now, passing CAMERA and heading
toward the distant stars. She is beautiful and they
are beautiful. And as she slowly disappears from
VIEW...
MUSIC RISES. CREDITS ROLL.
