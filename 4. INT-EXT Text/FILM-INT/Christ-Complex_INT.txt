LOUIS, a college student in his late twenties stares at a
friend who is sitting off screen. Louis is calm, almost
villainous in how collective he is.
He stares at this unseen friend, trying to assess the
cause for his anxious state.
LOUIS
(smug)
Something is bothering you...
We finally see QUINN, also in his late twenties. He is
obviously uneasy about being out in public with this
person.
QUINN
I appreciate the faux concern but I'm
fine.
Louis is taken aback.
LOUIS
My concern is genuine...
QUINN
With our history can you honestly say you
care about my well being?
LOUIS
Yes I can, our connection is a product of
destiny. I have no ill-will against you.
Quinn scoffs.
QUINN
1941-
LOUIS
-The Stephen Speilberg film?
QUINN
No, there was that little French girl I
liked. You..you violated her and torched
her farm killing her family-
2.
LOUIS
-Actually you are jacking up the story, I
violated her father in front of
her...then I torched the farm.
QUINN
Well...that makes it ten times better.
LOUIS
Quinn that was war, people do crazy
things midst of wide spread conflict. I
have gotten jaded over time. It's not
like the dark ages when I had style.
QUINN
When you would rape the horses and ride
away on the women?
LOUIS
Yeah I was such a ham.
(beat)
Quinn, this is what we do. I have gotten
carried away in the past, but now I'm
tired. I just want to get this over with.
It's our calling, we help bring order and
balance to the universe.
(beat)
Maybe I would feel less removed if you
would let me win just once.
QUINN
This isn't a 1930's boxing match. If I
take dive, I'm not lining the pockets of
some bookie...I'm bringing on the
apocalypse.
Louis takes a drink of his coffee.
LOUIS
See at least our obligation would be
over.
QUINN
Louis I might be nervous, but I accept my
role as savior of this world.
(beat)
We have been doing this for years-
LOUIS
-centuries-
QUINN
-and in 5 days we will do the same thing
we have always done.
(MORE)
3.
QUINN (CONT'D)
(beat)
We'll fight to the death.
LOUIS
Atta' boy!
TITLECARD: CHRIST COMPLEX
We pan across the cafe to the table of ZOEY and RICK, a
young college aged couple. Zoey is obviously trying to
have a serious conversation, while Rick hides behind his
laptop using it as a shield.
ZOEY
...I'm not saying this is an
intervention.
Rick doesn't look up from his laptop screen.
RICK
Wouldn't there be more people here if it
was an intervention?
ZOEY
See and I don't want it to be-
RICK
(disinterested)
-That's because it's not
ZOEY
It's just...I mean...are you gambling
again?
RICK
(totally removed)
Nope.
ZOEY
Because...um...the laptop, and you never
go anywhere with out it-
RICK
-it's my lifeline-
ZOEY
-Yeah well...I just know when I met you I
saved you from that downhill spiral...you
know...uh...the online poker-
4.
RICK
-I'm not a project, you know that right?
ZOEY
Of course not...I never said you were.
RICK
Because you act like it...I wonder if I
didn't have this "so called problem" if
you would have even been interested in
me.
ZOEY
Of course I would. I just-
RICK
-Take it upon yourself to save people.
ZOEY
OK...maybe. Honestly we have to save each
other, who else is going to do it.
RICK
(continued to be removed)
People could just save themselves.
ZOEY
True. Is that human nature? People rely
on false deities, self help books...Rick
the day I realized we were alone in the
universe was the day I realized we have
to be there for each other.
(beat)
Plus don't you find it romantic that I
want to save you? Like a movie...
RICK
So our relationship is like a romantic
comedy?
ZOEY
(dreamy)
A Cameron Crowe romantic comedy.
RICK
Oh well...so do you want to see what I'm
doing on the computer?
Zoey feels like she has broken down the "wall".
ZOEY
Yes...of course!
5.
Rick spins the computer around.
RICK
Check that out Lloyd Dobler.
ZOEY
(Shocked)
Is that...porn?
RICK
Red Tube...like You Tube...but with porn.
ZOEY
Um....
(lightbulb)
wait...is that?
RICK
Oh yes...
ZOEY
Us having sex?
RICK
Oh yeah...
Rick reaches over and points at the laptop screen.
RICK (CONT'D)
I love the part coming up.
(beat)
You know where I put your legs behind
your head and yell "hump bunny!"
ZOEY
Yeah...um...I'm not OK with this...
RICK
Yeah...OK...I'm also breaking up with
you.
ZOEY
What?-
RICK
-Yeah not working any more for me-
ZOEY
What the hell?!? How is it not working?!?
RICK
You are yelling...you know I don't like
confrontational situations.
6.
ZOEY
I'm not trying to be confrontational...I
just...you are breaking up with me?
RICK
-Yeah...Can I have my laptop back now?
Zoey, still confused, slowly turns the laptop back toward
Rick.
RICK (CONT'D)
(looking at the screen)
This part is fucking priceless.
Zoey is bewildered.
JACK, A 20 year old gay man who loves him a good "Cosby
Sweater", is sitting at the computer desk "surfing" on
the desktop.
Anna walks up from behind and runs her fingers through
Jack's hair.
16.
JACK
So when does Ted Bundy get here?
We follow Anna across the room where she plops herself
down on the couch.
ANNA
I promised her we would behave.
A KNOCK is heard at the front door.
ANNA (CONT'D)
Although knocking right as I sat down
doesn't endear him to me...
Jack gets up from the desk.
JACK
You sit your pretty little ass down
hooker.
Anna adjusts herself back down into the comfy couch.
ANNA
This is why I don't need a boyfriend. You
are way to good to me.
Jack opens the door to reveal Quinn.
JACK
Look at this mother fucker.
He rudely motions him to come in and sit down.
JACK (CONT'D)
Zoey is in the bathroom getting ready for
a night of manipulation, sit the fuck
down.
QUINN
(confused)
Um...OK?
In almost the same beat, Zoey walks into the room.
ZOEY
Quinn, is he being rude?
QUINN
(looking at Jack)
No quite pleasant.
Zoey reaches out her hand to help Quinn off the couch.
17.
ZOEY
Let's go.
JACK
(looking at Quinn)
I will call the state police in a fucking
heart beat if she isn't here by midnight.
QUINN
(still confused)
OK?
Anna grabs the remote trying to ignore the situation.
ZOEY
Anna, you going to call the guard dog
off?
ANNA
(out of it)
David Smith's Candytakers is on tonight.
I'm relaxing and not getting in the
middle.
QUINN
(To Jack and Anna)
Nice meeting both of you.
JACK
Get the fuck out.
ZOEY
(to Jack and Anna)
Don't wait up
Zoey and Quinn leave the apartment as Jack stares
daggers.
Zoey and Quinn are enjoying their meal at this fancy
upscale establishment. Quinn picks up his menu, running
his finger down though the menu items.
QUINN
Zoey I would be more than happy to pay.
ZOEY
No not at all. This is on me.
QUINN
I can cover dessert at least.
ZOEY
Listen Quinn, I'm an atheist-
QUINN
-So you don't want dessert?-
ZOEY
-No, I just wanted to get it out of the
way. It bothers people, I mean in this
state especially.
Quinn puts down the menu.
QUINN
It doesn't bother me.
ZOEY
Really?
QUINN
I don't believe anyone is truly an
atheist at the end.
ZOEY
I'm pretty sure I'm really an atheist.
QUINN
Why's that?
ZOEY
Because I'm a logical thinker.
(beat)
I don't mean to offend, I'm guessing
you're religious.
QUINN
One supports the business they are in I
guess.
19.
ZOEY
Oh my God you are in the ministry.
QUINN
(smiles)
Kind of.
ZOEY
My father was a "fire and damnation"
preacher. Baptist...He's...
QUINN
He's?
ZOEY
It's nothing.
(beat)
Sorry I don't mean to rock your world.
QUINN
(smiles)
You didn't.
ZOEY
You poor thing. You are probably so
desperate for friends-
QUINN
(laughs)
What?
ZOEY
Have you thought about St John's Wort?
QUINN
You are a very cryptic speaker.
ZOEY
No I'm thinking out loud mostly. I was
just...well...you have some social
awkwardness.
QUINN
OK?
ZOEY
Well you are latching on to religion to
make you feel whole. It doesn't make you
feel whole, or at least as whole as you
thought it would-
QUINN
You are kind of right on that one.
20.
ZOEY
So you are out with me...I represent
everything you were brought up to combat.
You're missing something and you are
looking for help.
QUINN
I am looking for help. I'm out with you
though because I'm interested in getting
to know you.
ZOEY
(smiles)
See I'm good at reading people.
QUINN
(rolls eyes, smiles)
Kind of.
ZOEY
I don't know Quinn you seem like a lost
soul. I thought that when I saw you by
the river.
QUINN
You like lost souls don't you?
ZOEY
Yeah I actually do. Someone needs to save
them.
QUINN
You going to save me?
ZOEY
If you let me.
QUINN
I think you might be able to.
ZOEY
(endearing smile)
So what do you need Quinn?
QUINN
(smiles)
Dessert.
ZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT-LATER
Jack is passed out drooling on the couch. Anna and Zoey
are cross legged on the floor in the midst of "girl
talk".
21.
ANNA
I don't know, he seems fishy.
ZOEY
He seems harmless.
ANNA
I have heard that a million times.
ZOEY
I know. He's in the ministry-
ANNA
-and you hate organized religion.
ZOEY
I know and he's understanding of that.
ANNA
Plus it's to my understanding he didn't
actually admit what he did. He just did a
bunch of double talk.
ZOEY
It was understood.
ANNA
Yeah again...not feeling confident in
your choices. Please Zoey...
(beat)...
Be careful this time.
TITLE CARD: 4 DAYS LEFT
Quinn is sleeping in his bed. His room is rather bare,
with the exception of the basic living necessities. It
almost appears like a room at the "Y".
CLOSE UP-EDGE OF BED
A foot is seen kicking the bed, startling Quinn.
QUINN'S ROOM
Quinn flies out of bed and sees Louis leaning against the
wall with his arms crossed.
LOUIS
Where were you last night?
22.
QUINN
(getting his bearings)
Out...thinking.
LOUIS
You've done a lot of mopping and thinking
over the centuries. It kind of brings me
down.
QUINN
So what do you need?
LOUIS
Training.
Louis sips his coffee, while Quinn just stares out the
front window. It almost as if he is searching for
something.
LOUIS
You have not been lively at all this go
around.
QUINN
A lot on my mind...
LOUIS
We only do this once every seventy years
brother. You have to enjoy it while it
lasts.
QUINN
Louis our whole purpose here, is to show
up, and over time establish a social
base, and then kill each other.
LOUIS
You know and I'm very good at the social
base part, and you are not so good...
QUINN
That's because you find a way to screw it
up every time.
LOUIS
That's because, I know this is news to
you, I represent evil.
(MORE)
24.
LOUIS (CONT'D)
Here's the thing though, I'm tired Quinn.
I really want to stop being the
ambassador for this.
QUINN
That's something we agree on. I'm tired
too.
LOUIS
I don't know if we can get off this
train. It's just a viscous cycle.
QUINN
Letting you win is not an option.
LOUIS
I wasn't going there...
(beat)
...yet.
Quinn is sitting on the couch as Jack and Anna make their
way for the door.
ZOEY (O.S.)
You guys leaving?
Zoey comes out of the kitchen with a bowl of popcorn.
JACK
Yeah we don't want to interrupt your
"date rape".
Anna hits Jack.
ANNA
Jesus Jack! He can't do anything here
anyway. Too much exposure. Witnesses my
friend...We knew he was here.
Zoey sits down and hands the bowl to Quinn.
ZOEY
Will you guys stop??
QUINN
It's OK. I like your friends.
Anna walks over to the couch.
ANNA
So Quinn?
25.
QUINN
Yes?
ANNA
Zoey says you are in the ministry?
QUINN
Sort of.
ANNA
You are or you aren't.
QUINN
It's complicated.
ANNA
At some point you will have to explain it
to Zoey. I mean don't you agree?
QUINN
Well...
ZOEY
(put out)
Will you guys leave??
Jack grabs Anna by the arm and leads her to the door.
JACK
Who is going too far now?
ANNA
"Date Rape"
ZOEY
(trying to make a point)
Bye guys!
Anna and Jack mumble as they head out the door.
ZOEY (CONT'D)
(turning to Quinn)
Sorry about that.
QUINN
It's really OK.
Zoey is curled up next to Quinn on the couch. A popcorn
bowl is squeezed in between them. She reaches over and
picks up the remote.
ZOEY
Tonight's Feature Presentation is "I am
Curious:Yellow". Probably not the best
date movie, but I always show this to
ever guy in the beginning.
QUINN
It's OK this will be my first film
experience.
ZOEY
What??
QUINN
Yeah, I've never seen a film before. I
mean I know of films, can't live in this
world and not. I've just never seen one.
ZOEY
This might be a little hard-core for your
first film.
QUINN
No it's OK. I'm excited.
Zoey shakes her head.
27.
ZOEY
I feel like I'm stealing your virginity
here.
Zoey slowly looks over at Quinn.
ZOEY (CONT'D)
You're a virgin too aren't you?
Quinn shrugs
ZOEY (CONT'D)
Oh my god! I'm a bad girl.
Quinn puts his hand on her shoulder.
QUINN
(smiles)
You are not.
Quinn motions to the TV.
QUINN (CONT'D)
Please play the film.
ZOEY
(hesitant)
OK? I mean I usually play this for
potential boyfriends. If they can handle
this, they can handle me.
Zoey hits play on the remote.
ZOEY (CONT'D)
I guess you're lucky I thought about
"They Call Her One Eye".
(to herself)
I hope this doesn't jack you up.
JUMP CUT TO:
TITLE CARD: 3 DAYS LEFT
We creep upon Ryan Blood as he works at his computer. On
closer inspection, it appears he is editing video of
Quinn and Louis' mock fight earlier in the day.
Louis' set up is more lavish than Quinn's. It's obvious
he indulges just a little too much.
Louis comes out of the bathroom with a towel around his
waist. He starts singing "Motown" songs to himself.
He walks back off screen to the bedroom. We still hear
him singing, as we pan around the apartment.
We swing back around to the entrance of Louis' bedroom.
He finally comes out fully dressed. He uses the towel he
was wearing to finish drying his hair.
He walks up to a mirror and starts looking at himself.
30.
LOUIS' POV
He starts to run his hands through his hair. He tries to
straighten up the mess on his head. He picks up some gel
and squirts a small amount in his hand.
He runs it through his hair, getting the desired look.
LOUIS
(to himself)
You are a handsome devil.
LOUIS APARTMENT
Louis spins around and grabs his keys off of the coffee
table. He then dances right out the door.
Louis walks into Quinn's room and finds him not there.
LOUIS
(puzzled)
Weird?
Louis walks out into...
HALLWAY
...the hallway. Ryan Blood is standing in the doorway of
his room, across the hall.
RYAN BLOOD
You looking for Quinn?
Takes Louis' a second to register Ryan's question.
LOUIS
Yes?
RYAN BLOOD
(nodding toward the exit door)
He just left.
Ryan is working at his PC when a KNOCK is heard. He gets
up from his messy desk and makes his way over to the
door.
As he swings it open we see Louis on the other side.
RYAN BLOOD'S APARTMENT- A FEW MOMENTS LATER
Ryan leans back in his desk chair. Louis has cleared off
a spot on a messy couch.
The apartment, simply put, is a "shithole"
RYAN BLOOD
You're here to learn more about his
"coming and goings". To find out what I
have seen.
LOUIS
So far you are dead on.
RYAN BLOOD
It's more than that Louis-
LOUIS
-You know who I am?
RYAN BLOOD
I know pretty much everything. I've
watched you, studied you...I feel I'm
expert on your little game every seventy
years.
LOUIS
Really?
RYAN BLOOD
Oh yes.
Ryan picks up a stack of documents and throws the papers
one at a time at Louis.
RYAN BLOOD (CONT'D)
You battled as mortals-
(beat)
(MORE)
34.
RYAN BLOOD (CONT'D)
-You were a Lamanite then-
(beat)
-Quinn was a commander of the Nephites,
last survivor of that nation-
(beat)
-The savoir spoke to him, showed him his
future...his destiny-
(beat)
-See after the death of Christ there was
some debate on what was going to bring on
the end and signal his return-
(beat)
- It was decided two great warriors had
to fight. The winner would determine the
start of the apocalypse. Your boss of
course needed someone to represent his
interests. Who better than Quinn's old
adversary?
Louis brushes the pile of papers of his lap.
LOUIS
Where are you going with this you weird
little man?
RYAN BLOOD
You had strategy in the beginning. Middle
Ages...Old West...Even World War II.
(beat)
Let's take a step back for a second. The
Old West. Lack of faith, corruption,
these things make Quinn weak. The chink
in his armor is his faith in people. You
knew that, and corrupting America...a
young land...was the key.
(beat)
Quinn was a step ahead of you, and looked
for a human ally. That ally was Joseph
Smith, and Quinn...or I mean Moroni...led
Joseph to the plates that later when into-
Ryan picks a book up and throws it at Louis. Louis looks
down at the "Book Of Mormon".
RYAN BLOOD (CONT'D)
-His little plan didn't work, but the
book is a great coffee table discussion
piece. This made him weak Louis. You
could have destroyed him. The problem is
you've allowed yourself to become fond of
him. YOU need to embrace your destiny.
LOUIS
How do I do that?
35.
RYAN BLOOD
This girl is distracting him. Get his
mind focused on the matter at hand. At
this point I'm afraid he isn't even going
to fight you.
LOUIS
I'm surprised this girl even likes Quinn.
He comes across creepy.
RYAN BLOOD
Maybe that's the key-
LOUIS
(lightbulb)
-Make her think he's crazy.
Quinn opens the door to his room and spies a silhouette
in the far corner.
LOUIS
Where have you been?
The silhouette comes out of the darkness and into view.
It should come to no surprise that Louis is emerging from
the darkness.
QUINN
You've been waiting long?
LOUIS
No I figured you were on your way back-
QUINN
-because you are spying on me again? So I
don't need to tell you where I've been.
Louis sits down on the edge of the bed.
LOUIS
Who's the girl?
QUINN
It's started again. You're already
jealous. You are going to do the same
thing you did during the war...you're
going to sabotage this.
LOUIS
I'm insulted frankly.
36.
QUINN
Don't you play that game. You are being
facetious.
LOUIS
No, I'm being serious. You care about the
girl, it's obvious. Not in a friendship
or I'm curious about human behavior way.
Quinn sits down beside him.
QUINN
So why are you here?
LOUIS
Have you told her?
QUINN
Who I am? Of course not!
LOUIS
Quinn you only have a few days left and
you care for this girl-
(beat)
- What's the harm in telling her?
QUINN
There's a lot of harm in telling her.
LOUIS
If this is real and you really care for
this girl, you have to tell her. It's
only fair to her.
QUINN
She has a best friend who is very guarded
of me...It's odd she eluded to the same
thing. You know the whole "I'm hiding
something, and I need to come out into
the open" thing.
LOUIS
Sounds to me like she is right.
Quinn gets up and walks to the door.
QUINN
Well I better do this now then.
LOUIS
Yeah you don't want to lose your nerve.
QUINN
Can you let yourself out?
37.
LOUIS
Of course.
Quinn slowly opens the door and walks out. The door
creeps shut behind him.
Louis smiles to himself, feeling satisfaction. His face
looks evil, almost demonic.
Zoey jumps out of bed, like she is waking from a
nightmare. A startled Quinn, who was sleeping beside her,
starts to arouse.
JUMP CUT TO:
TITLE CARD: 2 DAYS LEFT
Louis walks into Quinn's room with his black tote bag
from earlier. It's obvious he was meeting Quinn to go
train.
He looks through out the room, but quickly realizes Quinn
is probably with Zoey. He slumps down on Quinn's bed.
Anger and hurt is portrayed upon his face.
Quinn and Zoey are having coffee. It's obvious Zoey had a
rough night. She takes a sip of coffee, her mind is
distant.
QUINN
Last night?
ZOEY
Yes?
QUINN
Did you?
ZOEY
Enjoy myself? Of course.
41.
QUINN
Based on how you are acting this morning
I have my doubts. That's not what I meant
though. You woke up screaming.
ZOEY
It was nothing.
QUINN
I understand if you don't want to talk
about it. I'm just concerned.
ZOEY
It's not a big deal. It was...a...well
wouldn't call it a nightmare...repressed
memory. Hell, it's not repressed...I
think of it all the time.
QUINN
What is it?
ZOEY
You don't want to hear about it.
Quinn touches her hand.
QUINN
Please?
Zoey takes a deep breath.
ZOEY
My father, I mentioned him before, was a
Baptist minister. He always said he had
this "sickness". He begged my mom for
help, it was more important though for
her to having shopping and dinner dates
with her girlfriends. Anna, my friend
that "loves you", has been in my life
since I was tiny. She used to come over
all the time. My Dad adored her. When I
was around twelve I found something in
the closet...tapes. My Dad and Anna from
the time she was like seven...He...
(starts tearing up)
I showed my Mom, and Dad...well he got
out of prison when I was seventeen. I
don't see him anymore. His church, even
though they knew he had a problem
disowned him. He wouldn't have done that
to Anna if my mom would have supported
him, got him help.
42.
QUINN
Who do you think is to blame?
ZOEY
He tried to get help Quinn, he reached
out to my Mom. I should have protected
Anna too...I mean-
QUINN
-None of this was your fault.
ZOEY
I have to protect people. This was out of
my control, you Quinn...What's going on
with you...I have control of that.
Quinn looks at Zoey. He loves her, but a part of him
pities her too.
Louis is watching the video on the smart phone. He's seen
enough, he throws it back to Ryan.
Louis tosses trash off the couch so he can sit down.
LOUIS
(sitting down)
I thought him admitting his true self
would break them up-
44.
Ryan plops down in his computer desk chair.
RYAN BLOOD
-Instead he is still hot and heavy with
her.
(beat)
He even did the "bipty boom" last night.
LOUIS
The fight is pointless.
RYAN BLOOD
It's not pointless. The game has just
changed is all.
(beat)
We have two levels here: one is making
sure we keep him engaged.
(beat)
Honestly though that's an afterthought at
this point-
LOUIS
So what's the next move?
Ryan reaches into his desk drawer.
RYAN BLOOD
(still searching)
Well when he does become engaged...
Ryan throws something at Louis.
LOUIS POV
Louis catches the item. He looks down to see a nine
millimeter.
RYAN BLOOD (O.S.) (CONT'D)
...We need to make sure you still have
the advantage.
Zoey is pacing back and forth. Jack rubs his face in
frustration. He is tired of watching Zoey tear herself up
over this guy.
Anna tries to step into Zoey's path attempting to get her
attention
ANNA
What are you doing?
45.
Zoey is jittery, she can't handle Anna blocking her way.
ZOEY
I haven't heard from Quinn since he
wigged out today.
ANNA
Well honestly maybe that's a good thing.
ZOEY
He needs me.
ANNA
He doesn't need you! Not everyone needs
you!
ZOEY
(frustrated)
This isn't about me and you-
ANNA
-This is about me and you! You think you
can make up for what happened. The fact
you didn't notice, couldn't save me in
time. You were a child! I was a child!
You couldn't have saved your father
either! Your mother couldn't have, no one
could have! He was a fucking pedophile!
Zoey slaps Anna across the face.
ANNA (CONT'D)
Hate me all you want, but it's impossible
to redeem yourself for things you had no
control over.
Jack is sick and tired of this display.
JACK
Just show her the fucking file.
Jack gets up.
ZOEY
(confused)
What fucking file?
Louis turns toward Ryan.
LOUIS
I thought coming here would give us some
privacy from Quinn.
RYAN BLOOD
I think it worked out perfectly.
Jack walks into the room holding a file folder. Zoey is
sitting on the couch trying to get a grip.
Jack throws the file in her lap.
ZOEY
So is the file folder for dramatic
effect?
JACK
No it was to keep everything organized...
(beat)
...and for dramatic effect.
Suddenly Zoey's cell phon rings.
She sets the folder aside and answers.
ZOEY
Quinn?
INTERCUT
A awkward young man, JAKE, is sorting through boxes. He's
kneeled on the floor organizing a mess of files. Zoey
walks up and tries to attract his attention.
ZOEY
Excuse me?
Jake comes out of his world of file sorting. He looks up
at Zoey.
JAKE
(monotone)
Yes.
54.
Jake stands.
ZOEY
I'm looking for Mrs. Rhodes. I believe
the people here referred to her as
"mother".
JAKE
(monotone)
People look for a lot of things.
Zoey is confused.
ZOEY
I'm sure they do.
(looking at the boxes)
You guys shutting down?
JAKE
(monotone)
We are ceasing operations.
ZOEY
Is there something wrong with you?
MRS. RHODES, a 60 year old odd looking lady, comes out of
the back.
MRS. RHODES
Calm down. You need to calm down and
count to ten.
ZOEY
What? I don't know what that means.
Mrs. Rhodes starts waving her hands at Zoey. She flaps
them up and down in her face.
MRS. RHODES
You have to calm down and meditate.
ZOEY
Um...no...listen do you know Quinn Wilson
and Louis Marks? They grew up here.
Mrs. Rhodes steps back like a vampire who has just seen a
cross.
MRS. RHODES
No...You need to leave!
ZOEY
What?
55.
MRS. RHODES
And give me your shirt.
ZOEY
Um...no.
Zoey turns around and starts to leave. Mrs. Rhodes starts
screaming at the top of her lungs.
MRS. RHODES
You better make your peace with God girl!
The end is coming, those boys are
ushering in a new era!
Zoey runs down the hallway toward the front door.
Jack sits at the PC while chatting away on his cell
phone. It appears he is looking up information for who
ever is on the other end.
Zoey is parked in a parking lot, while she chats on her
cell phone with Jack.
JACK
You might be right sweetheart. The
employee I was telling you about earlier
was instrumental in getting Appleridge
Orphanage shut down.
ZOEY
How?
57.
JACK
Mrs. Rhodes was pretty well known in
Huntington. I think she felt this guy was
getting in the way of her master plan.
Finally, nearly 20 years later, he
convinced the state what was really going
on there.
ZOEY
Well...elaborate.
JACK
That girl you talked to was "pants
crapping nuts". She actually makes your
boyfriend look sane. I guess she believes
that Lucifer came to her in a vision-
ZOEY
-How is that different than a dream? Just
saying-
JACK
-I don't know. I think you have to be
awake for a vision.
(beat)
Will you please pay attention? Anyway he,
meaning Lucifer, gave her this jazz
about...well you know the story. Two
angels, fighting to the
death...blah...blah...Anyway he told her
she needed to look after Louis and get
Quinn out of there. I guess trying to
stack the odds in Louis' favor.
ZOEY
So she had Quinn committed?
JACK
To the same hospital where her nephew was
a patient. All on the dark lord's orders
I guess.
ZOEY
Fucking Ryan Blood!
JACK
Your friends are fucking whack.
ZOEY
Thanks Jack.
JACK
So what are you going to do?
58.
ZOEY
I'm going to stop an Apocalyptic battle.
JACK
Goddamn Zoey!
ZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT
Jack realizes Zoey hung up on him. He slowly puts his
phone down and steps away from the computer.
He walks over to the couch and sits down. He lets out a
sigh of exhaustion as he leans back on the couch.
ZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT-A FEW HOURS LATER
Jack is now sprawled out on the couch. Anna walks in the
room and sets a beverage on the coffee table in front of
him.
She moves his legs and sits down beside of him.
ANNA
So where is she at now?
Jack sits up.
JACK
I got a text about thirty minutes ago.
I'm pretty sure she is going to head to
Quinn's apartment.
ANNA
Jack...
JACK
What?
ANNA
Her Christ Complex is going to get her
killed.
JACK
Trust me I know Anna.
(beat)
I know...
KNOCKING is heard at the door. Anna gets up to answer.
JACK (CONT'D)
Maybe it's Quinn the jackass.
59.
Anna just gets the door opened a crack when...
Ryan and Louis BURST into the room. Anna SCREAMS. Louis
restrains her against a wall.
Jack gets up from the couch, but he meets a gun handle to
the head from Ryan.
RYAN BLOOD
Good afternoon boys and girls! I need
your assistance.
Quinn walks into his room. To his surprise, Zoey is
sitting on his bed. It appears she has been there for a
while.
QUINN
How do people keep ending up in my room?
ZOEY
(laughs)
You need to learn to lock up.
Quinn walks over and sits on the bed beside her.
QUINN
I'm not fighting Louis.
ZOEY
Why the change of heart?
QUINN
I think you might be right. I don't think
it's necessary. I think the world will
keep turning one way or another. I'm not
dependant on that.
(beat)
I'm not a savior.
ZOEY
Do you really believe? You know?
QUINN
Yes. I do believe it. I know it actually.
Since I have been with you, I've doubted
what I know to be fact though. Then it
hit me, it really doesn't matter.
ZOEY
I'll help you Quinn. I don't want to do
it for myself...
(MORE)
60.
ZOEY (CONT'D)
I don't want to do it because I feel I
have to. Obligations, or dark incidents
from my past...That's not a reason to
help anyone. It makes me fucking selfish
actually.
QUINN
You're not selfish Zoey.
ZOEY
I care about you Quinn. That's sincerely
my reason for wanting to do this. That's
a first for me you know?
QUINN
I know...
Quinn hugs her and they slowly lay down on the bed
together.
JUMP CUT TO:
QUINN'S ROOM- LATER
Quinn gets pistol whipped across the face. Suddenly we
see Louis picking Zoey up by the hair.
QUINN
(in pain)
Let her go!
Louis has a hold of Zoey. Quinn gets up and goes for
Ryan.
Louis drop kicks Quinn and sends him flying across the
room.
Louis throws Zoey at Ryan. Ryan then holds her at gun
point.
RYAN BLOOD
(looking at Quinn)
Let me pretty the girl up a bit
Ryan beats her repeatedly with the gun until she passes
out cold from the trauma.
Quinn tries to get to his feet, but Louis kicks him back
down.
LOUIS
Hold on sunshine!
61.
Ryan throws Louis the gun.
QUINN'S POV
We see Louis with great force repeatedly hit Quinn with
the gun. Everything goes fuzzy and then we...
CUT TO:
BLACKNESS
Quinn slowly gets to his feet. He walks over to the
doorway and kneels down.
He sees a puddle of blood...Zoey's blood. He puts his
fingers in it. He inspects his hand, rubbing the blood
between his index finger and thumb.
He jumps up and screams in anger. That would be Quinn's
version of a battle cry.
CLOSE SHOT-JACK'S FACE
A hand rips duct tape off of Jack's mouth. He let's out a
loud scream.
JACK
Mother fucker!
Quinn crouches down beside Jack.
Jack and Anna are both tied up, Anna still has duct tape
across her mouth. You can hear her muffled screams as
they fill the room.
QUINN
Where's Zoey?
JACK
Fuck you mother fucker! I'm going to call
the fucking fuzz once you untie me!
Fucking nut bag, ball sac-
QUINN
(like he is talking to a retarded child)
I...will...come...rescue...you
62.
JACK
Ass fuck salad-
Quinn puts the duct tape back on Jack's mouth. Even
though we can't make out what he is saying, he is still
running off at the mouth.
QUINN
That actually felt kind of good.
Quinn pats Jack on the head.
QUINN (CONT'D)
I'll be back guys.
Quinn leaves the room. Muffled cursing can be heard
through out the apartment.
CLOSE SHOT-QUINN'S BED
A long black box is pulled out from under Quinn's bed. We
see Quinn's hands unlatch and then open it.
Inside we see Quinn's katana. His hand grips the hilt.
Quinn gets up, holding his katana and ready for a fight.
He's dressed in a black biker jacket, kind of looking
like the Bride from Kill Bill.
He walks to the doorway. He stands still for a second.
He's preparing his next move.
Bad ass comic book pose...'nuff said.
CUT TO:
TITLE CARD: DAY ZERO THE ENDGAME
DREAM SEQUENCE
START CHOIR MUSIC
The front doors to the church swing open. Light fills the
sanctuary. Zoey walks through the doors.
She heads toward the alter and sees a man, in his 50's,
kneeling. It appears he might be praying.
63.
She places her hand on his shoulder. As he turns around
she sees her Dad.
ZOEY
I'm not doing it anymore. You will not
have redemption from me.
DAD
(raspy)
Zoey...
He reaches for her, she pulls away. She starts to back
up.
ZOEY
Take ownership of what you did. Don't
rely on me to save you. I need to start
saving myself.
She slowly backs up and then turns to walk away.
ZOEY (CONT'D)
(as she is turning)
Goodbye.
JUMP CUT TO:
END DREAM SEQUENCE
END CHOIR MUSIC
CLOSE SHOT- ZOEY'S FACE
Ryan slaps Zoey in the face to wake her up.
The camera slowly pans toward an older ninety year old
Zoey. She's behind a podium, there is a sign on the front
that reads: Marshal University Association of Free
Thought.
ZOEY
For years we have thought absence of the
impossible indicated that we were
exercising free thought. In my experience
ladies and gentleman, that's not the
case.
(beat)
Believing in hope my friends, opening
yourself up to accepting there might be
more than the world around you. That's
truly being a free thinker.
The camera ends with a close shot on Zoey's face.
