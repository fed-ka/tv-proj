      UNDER TITLES (if applicable) a HIGH LONG LONESOME SHOT of a 
        twisty-turny mountain grade.  

      CLOSER:  This so-called "highway" is a two-lane route, 
      rolling, serpentine, hilly and curvy. The kind where an hour 
      drive between stops is normal and natural.  

      BOOM DOWN / PUSH IN until we are kissing-close to:  

      A RATTLESNAKE  

      A Northwestern Diamondback as thick as your arm. On the 
      prowl. Mean devilish face, fixed slit eyes. It is CROSSING 
      the road when we HEAR O.S. the familiar ENGINE NOISE of a 
      long-haul BUS.  


      The bus PASTES the snake dead center, flattening it.  


      LOW ON SQUASHED RATTLESNAKE - A pair of boots enter the 
      shot. Rattlesnake boots. A hand reaches down and peels the 
      snake off the asphalt.  

                                      WALKER S VOICE (O.S.)  
                        You re not done yet. 

      BACK TO THE BUS - IN PROGRESS 

      The horrendous NOISE of the bus throwing a rod contrasts the 
      preternatural SILENCE of this pine-tree wilderness. The bus 
        begrudgingly rumbles to the shoulder and STOPS. Forest 
      QUIET.  


                                                2.  



      The pneumatic door chuffs open and FERGUS steps down, 
      contrite. Still captain of his vessel. Sees SMOKE wafting 
      from the engine.  

                                      FERGUS  
                        Ahh, crap.  
                              (to passengers)  
                        That's all she wrote, folks.  

      Fergus boards the bus and gets on his radio. The PASSENGERS 
      begin to disembark - about seven of them. Last off is 
      STACIA, our principal:  Late 20s, short blonde hair, hiking 
      Docs, silver drop earrings, tough, confident, old enough to 
      know better.  

      Every PASSENGER except Stacia unlimbers a CELLPHONE and 
      wanders about like sages trying to divine water, their arms 
      in the air, trying to find a signal.  

                                      STACIA  
                        Oh, this is special.  

      She ducks back into the bus. To Fergus:  

                                      STACIA (CONT D)  
                        How far are we from Ganderton?  

                                      FERGUS  
                        More than an hour, still.  

                                      STACIA  
                        Is there anything around?  

                                      FERGUS  
                        Just that little Trading Post we 
                        passed about ten miles back. 
                        Guess I should have stopped 
                        there. For bathrooms, snacks, 
                        stretch your legs, you know.  

      She grabs her rucksack out of the bus and slings it. One of 
      the PASSENGERS - DANNY, and early-20s roustabout with a 
      guitar case - notices her. He goes into instant damsel-in-
      distress mode.  

                                      STACIA  
                        What about up ahead?  

                                      FERGUS  
                        A motel off the highway some 
                        twelve, fourteen miles up.  

                                                3.  


                                      STACIA  
                        That ll do.  

                                      DANNY  
                        You're not gonna walk, are you?  
                        Nobody walks.  

                                      STACIA  
                        Yeah. Nobody reads, either.  

                                      DANNY  
                        All alone on the road? Want me 
                        to ride shotgun for you?  

      She sizes him up in a withering instant.  

                                      STACIA  
                        No way.  

      She has a SWITCHBLADE in her hand and cleans her nails with 
      it. Snicks the blade out.  

                                      STACIA (CONT D)  
                        I ve got all the friend I need.  

      Danny fades back to talk to Fergus. As Stacia departs she 
      encounters a woman named BIRDY, from the bus. Birdy saw the 
      knife.  

                                      BIRDY  
                        That bad, huh?  

      Stacia realizes she's busted. Rueful. Almost apologetic.  

                                      STACIA  
                        Can get to be.  

                                      BIRDY  
                        So young and so bitter, hm?  

      Stacia almost leaves it at "whatever."  Hesitates. Turns 
      back to Birdy.  

                                      STACIA  
                        You ever been married?  

                                      BIRDY  
                        Been there, done that.  

                                      STACIA  
                        He ever hit you?  



                                                4.  



                                      BIRDY  
                        Anyone strikes me, only strikes 
                        me once.  
                                (beat)  
                        I see you're still wearing a 
                        ring, though.  

      Stacia is, in fact, still wearing a wedding ring.  

                                      STACIA  

      That's to remind me of my past mistakes. See ya.  

                                      BIRDY  
                                (thoughtful)  
                        You take care, now.  

                                      STACIA  
                        I almost always do.  

      Stacia marches away while the other passengers mill around.  

      ON DANNY  

      Slowly watches Stacia crest the next rise until she's out of 
      sight. Then he turns back to Fergus, still in the bus.  

                                      DANNY  
                        Hey, can't you get Triple A, or 
                        something?  

                                      FERGUS  
                        Yeah, great idea:  I'll just 
                        call a little ole hick tow 
                        truck. That'll work.  

      Slow, growing RUMBLE of a powerful diesel engine as a 
      customized SEMI TRAILER pulls into view behind the bus 
      (opposite direction), then veers parallel.  

      A power window buzzes down.  


      Fergus debarks the bus. He LEANS on Wheeler's Truck as 
      though bending the rail at a bar. Wheeler's gaze goes flat - 
      for just a split second.  

                                      FERGUS  
                        I can't get anybody on that 
                        damned radio, and -  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Hey, mind my lacquer there, 
                        buddy.  

      Fergus jerks his hands off the Truck as though shocked.  

      Wheeler's expression seems to shape-shift back toward human. 
      Friendly again.  

                                      WHEELER (CONT D)  
                        Listen, you're in a spot. I ll 
                        take your passengers to the 
                        trading post, if they don't mind 
                        riding in the back.  
                              (louder, to PASSENGERS)  
                        They serve a damn good 
                        breakfast. Great coffee. Phones 
                        that actually work.  

                                      FERGUS  
                        I have to stay with the bus.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Anybody else?  

                                      DANNY  
                        Yeah, that works for me.  

      Danny rushes to retrieve his gear from the bus.  

                                      WHEELER  
                                (whistles through his 
                                teeth)  
                        Anybody else?  Last call.  

      Birdy steps up.  



                                                6.  



                                      BIRDY  
                        Long as you promise you re not 
                        some psycho or something.  

      This breaks a grin from Wheeler, VERY homey.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        I promise, ma'am.  

      Danny lifts Birdy's bag into the back of the Truck. Big, 
      chromed rollbar there, festooned with powerful halogen 
      floods.  

      A YOUNG COUPLE - DEUCE and MARIE, 20s, traveling on a 
      budget, have that air of battling newlyweds about them but 
      they're probably not married yet. They argue it out sotto 
      voce, away from the others, but Wheeler can read them like a 
      book.  

                                      MARIE  
                        We can't just go with some dumb 
                        trucker that shows up outta 
                        nowhere!  What the hell is that?  

                                      DEUCE  
                        Cool it, he'll hear you -  

                                      MARIE  
                        Well, fuck him!  Nobody with 
                        brains hitches rides anymore!  
                        He's gonna grind us up into cat 
                        food or sell me into white 
                        slavery or some goddamned thing.  

                                      DEUCE  
                        Marie, just -  

      Marie OVERRIDES Deuce and shouts at Wheeler, waving 
        disingenuously.  

                                      MARIE  
                        No thanks!  Have a nice day!  
                                (under her breath)  
                        ... probable lunatic.  

                                      DEUCE  
                                (defeated)  
                        Great. Good one.  

      EVERYBODY ELSE from the bus, except FERGUS, has boarded the 
      Semi Trailer.  


                                                7.  


                                      DANNY  
                        Hey, who gets to ride up front?  

                                      WHEELER  
                              (re: Birdy)  
                        Let that pretty lady ride up 
                        here.  


      Wheeler pulling away without a backward look, leaving Deuce, 
      Marie, and Fergus at the broken-down bus. Fergus shrugs.  

                                      FERGUS  
                        I got a deck of cards.  


      As she hikes along - emphasizing Stacia's isolation a BREEZE 
      brings the woods TO LIFE around her - chirping, croaking, 
      things moving through the trees.  

      She shakes her head. With false bravado:  

                                      STACIA  
                        Just eat each other, fellas, 
                        okay? I'm just passing through.  
                              (sotto; to herself)  
                        Unless any of you remembered to 
                        bring some ... toilet paper.  


      Fergus is indulging in a smoke outside the disabled bus when 
      he spots Walker heading toward him with the slow, deliberate 
      gait of a guy who spends most of his travel time on foot. 
      WALKER has that rumpled college-boy look about him - late 
      20 s, charming in a rough, burry way. He wears half his 
      wardrobe, many shirts, a hooded sweat, an all-weather 
      duster.  

      A lot of things in a lot of pockets. A slouchy cowboy-style 
      hat with a plain band. The rest of his  home  is in his 
      backpack. He would be almost handsome ... but right now his 
      gaze is malignant, his eyes chromium. He almost resembles a 
      reptile himself.  

                                      WALKER  
                        Hey there.  

                                      FERGUS  
                        Hey.  

      Fergus TURNS to meet Walker - REVEALING to CAMERA that his 
      right hand rests on a REVOLVER in a spine holster beneath 
      his driver's jacket.  

                                                11.  


      Walker APPROACHES. The change is uncanny. Now his manner is 
      utterly open and friendly, his smile solicitous.  

                                      WALKER  
                        You wouldn't be headed anywhere 
                        up near Lansdale, would you?  

                                      FERGUS  
                        We ain't headed nowheres, right 
                        this minute.  

                                      WALKER  
                        Break down?  

                                      FERGUS  
                        Yeah. I think the tranny on this 
                        ole bitch picked today to eat 
                        itself and die.  

                                      WALKER  
                        That sucks.  


      Walker scans up and down the road. Nobody.  

                                      WALKER  
                        In theory, then, if the bus 
                        worked, you probably would have 
                        given me a ride?  

                                      FERGUS  
                        Sure, amigo. You got the fare, I 
                        got the ride.  

                                      WALKER  
                        That's what I was hoping.  

      Walker SEES Marie's sulking face, through the bus window.  

                                      WALKER (CONT D)  
                        How many here?  

      Fergus jerks his thumb toward the bus.  

                                      FERGUS  
                        Just those two. Everybody else 
                        caught a ride back to that 
                        roadside store.  

                                      WALKER  
                        What, you mean somebody offered 
                        a ride, and you guys didn't take 
                        it?  
                                (beat)  
                        Man, that's against my 
                          principles.  

                                      FERGUS  
                        I m supposed to pick them up 
                        once they get this bus rolling. 
                        If they can. You just gonna hang 
                        around?  

                                      WALKER  
                                (thoughtful)  
                        Maybe for a little bit.  

                                      FERGUS  
                        Smoke?  


                                                13.  


                                      WALKER  
                        I don't.  

      Fergus digs out a smoke for himself and cups his hand over 
      the lighter flame. Fergus LOOKS DOWN and SEES the DEAD SNAKE 
      dangling from Walker's coat.  

                                      FERGUS (CON'T)  
                        What the hell is that -- ?!  

      Walker looks down as though he just noticed it himself.  

                                      WALKER  
                        Oh. This.  

      Walker HEFTS the deceased snake.  

                                      WALKER (CONT D)  
                        Just road kill. You want to 
                        touch it?  

                                      FERGUS  
                        No fucking way.  

                                      WALKER  
                        Most people think snakes are 
                        slimy, right? Don t want to 
                        touch Them. They re not. They re 
                        pretty sturdy.  
                              (grins)  
                        He can t hurt you.  

      Walker pulls out the dead snake, a fist on each end, LIKE A 
      GARROTE.  

                                      WALKER (CONT D)  
                        Unless I help.  

      Walker SLINGS the five-foot snake lengthwise to WRAP Fergus  
      neck. Fergus RECOILS, turning as Walker CATCHES the free end 
      of the snake and before he knows it, Fergus is being 
      STRANGLED.  

      Fergus GASPS his last and SLUMPS.  


      Deuce BLOCKS the doorway and STEPS DOWN in time to realize 
      that Walker HAS FERGUS  PISTOL.  

                                      DEUCE  
                        Stop right there.  

                                      WALKER  
                        You stop. Right here.  

      He FIRES. BANG! Deuce catches the slug in the forehead and 
      DIES in a sprawl. Walker STEPS INTO the Bus footwell.  


      Stacia marches grimly along until she hears a strange NOISE 
      O.S. from somewhere around the bend ahead. She FREEZES like 
      a spooked animal. The sound repeats and she zeros-in ON:  

      LONG SHOT - REVERSE ANGLE 

      An ANIMAL in the road. Not dead. In pain. Future roadkill.  

        Muddy/dirty, mortally crippled by a vehicle but still ALIVE 
      and in agony. 

                                      STACIA 
                        Oh my god... 

      WITH STACIA as she nears the animal. First fear. Then 
      revulsion, then apprehension, then finally pity. As if she d 
      found her own pet mangled by a car. 

                                      STACIA (CONT D) 
                        You shouldn t be out here by 
                        yourself. You see what happens?  

      (Of course Stacia is talking more about herself). 

      The animal s only response is to SCREECH again in MORE pain 
      as Stacia almost-but-not-quite works the nerve to TOUCH it.  

      She RECOILS. Looks around for an option. SEES:  

      A ROCK. About the size of Stacia s head. A bad answer to a 
      thorny problem. The conclusion is obvious but for her, 
      picking up that rock is like walking the last mile on Death 
      Row. 

                                      STACIA (CONT D) 
                        If I don t, somebody is going to 
                        eat you. Shit - somebody is 
                        going to eat you anyway...but at 
                        least you won t feel it, right?  

      Stacia returns with the rock. This is hard, but necessary. 
      Hesitant. Regret. Pain. But not a breakdown. More 
      sympathetic than she ever acts toward people. She WALKS 
      INTO:  

      A LOW, DISTORTED UP-ANGLE 

      As though from the ANIMAL S POV. Stacia RAISES the rock 
      above her head. Falters. Raises it again. Perhaps she even 
      SCREAMS in frustration and anger. 

                                                16.  


      She SWINGS the rock DOWN to BLACK OUT FRAME. CRUNCH. The 
      IMPACT kills ALL SOUND for a beat. 

      ON STACIA AS SHE BACKS AWAY. 

                                      STACIA (CONT D) 
                        Sorry... 


      Popular road stop that's probably been there for ninety 
      years. Gas pumps and antiques for sale out front, even an 
      old piano. WHEELER'S TRUCK in the lot.  


      Wheeler EXITS, bag in one arm, chewing on the jerky. Rocko 
      STARES dumbly after him, holding the BULLET like a talisman. 

      Wheeler pauses at an old beat up piano amongst the man s 
      antiques on the patio and noodles out a jazz progression 
      with surprising skill.  

      Birdy comes over to voice her approval.  

                                      BIRDY  
                        You play even better than you 
                        shift. What other surprises have 
                        you got in store for me?  

                                      WHEELER  
                        I recall you were in interested 
                        in what s in the back my truck.  

                                      BIRDY  
                        I bet it s not kosher.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Well, you can come have a look.  

      Wheeler leads her to where the truck is parked - far away 
      from where the other passengers are downing their coffee.  

      CUT TO:  

      RAPID TRACKING SHOT 

      Marie running desperately through the woods - stopping - 
      looking back. No one seems to be following. She catches her 
      breath and runs on.  

      CUT TO:  


                                                20.  



      Wheeler just locking up the double doors at the rear of the 
      semi trailer.  
                        No sign of Birdy. She s gone.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Bye bye birdy.  

      Danny hurries over and interrupts Wheeler.  

                                      DANNY  
                        Mister, I m kind of worried 
                        about the four on that bus? Like 
                        they never showed up? Like maybe 
                        they re still in trouble back 
                        there?  

                                      WHEELER  
                              (mocking him)  
                        Is everything you say, like, a 
                        question?  

      This derails Danny momentarily. Then he gets it. Oh.  

                                      WHEELER (CONT D)  
                                (dramatically)  
                        So you suspect ... foul play?  

      Danny assumes a wounded look. Wheeler lightens up, still 
      mocking.  

                                      WHEELER (CONT D)  
                        Sorry. Dude.  

                                      DANNY  
                        That lady, Birdy?  She says 
                        you're some kind of cop.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Hm. Some kind. In emergencies. 
                        Have you seen her around? Maybe 
                        she s off powdering her pretty 
                        little nose.  

                                      DANNY  
                        Look, isn t that an emergency. 
                        If they re still out there with 
                        no water, stranded?  





                                                21.  



                                      WHEELER  
                        I guess you speak the truth. I 
                        suppose it ll take ten minutes, 
                        out and back. I bet those 
                        suckers at the bus are ready for 
                        a lift about now. Shit, I got 
                        all day. All night too, as far 
                        as that goes.  


      Walker stalks Marie.  

                                      WALKER  
                        Oh, Marie ...?  Marie ... ?  

      Marie DOESN'T MOVE. Maintains her hide. She grumbles 
      quietly.  

                                      MARIE  
                        Oh, fuck me.  

                                      WALKER  
                        I've got your credit card, 
                        Marie.  
                                (beat, no response)  
                        Somebody might abuse your 
                        personal information ... steal 
                        your identity.  

      He sounds like a chiding chaperone. Like he's having fun 
      doing this. Marie is lost in the forest and stalked by a 
      malefactor. What the hell should she do?  


      Wheeler's Truck blazes past. A HIGHWAY SIGN facing the 
      opposite direction. It's been there for decades and reads:  

      COUNTING SHEEP MOTOR HOTEL 
      EXIT 60-A - 16 MILES  


      MARIE - Exhausted. She stops running. Gets her bearing.  

                                      MARIE  
                        Oh shit, I ve been running in 
                        circles.  

      We RACK to REVEAL Walker, standing patiently BEHIND her. Her 
      fear and her gaze are targeted the wrong way. She SENSES him 
      in time to turn, but not in time to AVOID getting grabbed by 
      the throat and PINNED with savage strength to the nearest 
      tree. Walker is frighteningly strong.  

                                      WALKER  
                        Do me a favor, Marie. Skip the 
                        part about how you'll "do 
                        anything."  


                                                23.  


      Now Marie is in total bugfuck panic mode.  

                                      MARIE  
                        No - don't - wait --!  

      Walker MASHES her larynx with his thumb, reducing her voice 
      to a gurgle.  

                                      WALKER  
                        Fucking tourist.  


      The bus running lights still on, idle. Nobody home.  

      Wheeler's Truck pulls up beside it. Same direction as the 
      bust is pointed. Shot from across the road with a panoramic 
      view of the mountains and water.  


      Danny continuously moving CLOSER to the bus.  

                                      DANNY  
                        Hey!  Where is everybody!?  

      Wheeler dismounts and checks it out.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Maybe that guy from the bus 
                        company showed up with that van 
                        and, y'know, gave 'em a ride.  

                                      DANNY  
                        And they'd just leave the bus 
                        with the lights on and the door 
                        open?  

      Danny charges into the open bus.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Can't fault you there.  


                                                24.  


      Wheeler waits impatiently while Danny looks around. Nothing.  

                                      WHEELER (CONT D)  
                        They're gone. Why don't we be 
                        gone, too?   


      Where we once saw Stacia. Now Walker's boots crunch INTO 
      FRAME.  

      PAN UP to take in Walker who smoothly turns and sticks out 
      his thumb.  

      WALKER'S POV  

      A beat-to-shit VAN. We can already hear the speed metal 
      pounding from the stereo.  

      As the Van stops, the cargo door racks open and pot smoke 
      billows out. Three occupants:  STONEY, the driver, 
        barechested, shaved head, sunglasses, and a great many 
      piercings with thick, dangly ornaments, most notably on his 
      FACE. And LILY, a goth-pale willowsprout with ivory skin.  

                                      STONEY  
                        Climb aboard, lost traveler.  

      Walker shakes his head, smiles to himself, and boards the 
      REAR of the Van through the sliding door. We NOTICE Walker 
      now has the RATTLESNAKE HEAD mounted on the front of his 
      hat.  

      It still has a slight stain of blood on it.  


      The Van bombs down the road, music blasting. We hear 
      Walker's VOICE:  

                                      WALKER (O.S.)  
                        So are you two in, like, a band?  

      O.S.: Sudden SCUFFLE. Sounds of MEAT hitting MEAT. GASPS.  


      HANDS (Wheeler's) lever open the luggage bay to REVEAL the 
      bodies of Fergus and Deuce, stuffed inside, sprawled.  

      Wheeler DRAGS out the limp form of Fergus and seems to SMELL 
      him. To "scent" him.  

      Wheeler's gaze SNAPS toward the treeline. He moves as though 
        laser-targeted, almost breaks into a trot.  


      Wheeler bulls through the underbrush. Scanning, searching.  

      Until he SEES:  

      WHEELER'S POV - MARIE  

        Immobilized, tied with barbed wire to a tree, clothes 
      shredded, eyes wide with primal terror.  

                                                27.  


                                      MARIE  
                        Thank God. Please help me.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Tell me who did this. Answer me.  

                                      MARIE  
                              (her throat crushed, she 
                              can barely speak)  
                        He ran away.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Describe him, Goddammit!  

                                      MARIE  
                                (gurgles)  
                        Maybe 25 - cowboy hat, duster.  

      Wheeler starts to walk away. Marie gasps.  

                                      MARIE (CONT D)  
                        You can t just leave me here. 
                        Come back you bastard.  

      Wheeler just leaves her there to die. She s not worth 
      killing because this is not his victim.  

      (We don't make a big deal out of it at this point, but DANNY 
      is nowhere to be seen).  


      It gradually surges into view as Stacia approaches it, with 
      an expression of having found Paradise. She has walked the 
      day away.  

                                      STACIA  
                        About fucking time.  

      She checks her billfold to see if she s got enough cash to 
      buy herself a room for the night.  

      AS SHE HIKES CLOSER:  

      We see the Counting Sheep is a rickety Bates Motel clone 
      squatting close enough to the highway so we can see the 
      sputtering neon sign:  COUNTING SHEEP "RESTFUL" MOTEL. The 
      dirt lot is half-full with road-punished travel vehicles - 
      dusty autos with luggage carriers and out-of-state plates.  


      The Van speeds away from CAMERA.  

                                                28.  


      TIGHT ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE WINDOW - TRAVELING  

      As the window cranks down and a GLOVED HAND tosses a fistful 
      of litter to the wind.  

      ON THE ROAD  

      As the trinkets rain down and scatter - nipple rings and 
      piercing posts.  


      Wheeler's Truck STOPS in the middle of the road, where the 
      headlights illuminate a Man s body in a ditch by the 
      roadside.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Still warm.  

      Wheeler scans around with a big baton flashlight before 
      getting out.  


      Typical hotel breezeway with ice and vending machines at one 
      end (near the Office). Stacia s short of change. 

                                      STACIA  
                        Shit. Of course... 

      Walker startles her, appearing and slotting a quarter into 
      the machine. 

                                      WALKER 
                                (intrudes with 25 cents) 
                        No problem. I ve got loads of 
                        quarters.  
                                (beat) 
                        Ma am. 

      Stacia says nothing. She doesn t want to be beholden to 
      anybody. Walker presses the issue. 

                                      WALKER (CONT D)  
                        You re welcome. 

                                      STACIA 
                                (resistent but mindful of 
                                 manners ) 
                          Oh...Uh...thanks. 

                                      WALKER 
                        My pleasure. 

                                      STACIA 
                        You see the manager 
                          around...anywhere? 

                                      WALKER 
                        Grampaw? Probably gettin  his 
                        beauty sleep. With a bottle, 
                        know what I mean? 
                                (beat) 
                        Anything else I could help you 
                        with? I m handy. 




                                                33.  



                                      STACIA 
                              (re: beverage) 
                        This is plenty, thanks. 

                                      WALKER 
                        You hear them two goin  at it? 

                                      STACIA 
                        Oh. God. Did you hear that too? 

                                      WALKER 
                        Sounded like a rodeo. Some 
                        people just ain t got no shame. 

                                      STACIA 
                        They stopped. 

                                      WALKER 
                        Probably wore out. 
                              (thinks about it   is 
                              bemused) 
                        Whew. What a workout. 

                                      STACIA 
                                (still jittery - wants to 
                              escape) 
                        In that case I m going to try to 
                        get some sleep now. 

                                      WALKER 
                                (courtly) 
                        Well. Good night to you, then. 

      Before Stacia can flee, Wheeler appears. 

                                      WHEELER 
                        Excuse me - I don t mean to pry 
                        or anything, but were you by 
                        chance with that bus load of 
                        people? The one that broke down 
                        on the way to Ganderton? 

                                      STACIA 
                                (suspicious) 
                        How would you know that? 

                                      WHEELER 
                        I hauled a bunch of them to the 
                        trading post. How did you get 
                        away? 



                                                34.  



                                      STACIA 
                              (lying) 
                        I hitched a ride. 

                                      WHEELER 
                              (to Walker) 
                        What about you? You hitch-
                        hiking, too? 

                                      WALKER 
                        Not presently, no. 

      Walker indicates to the van. 

                                      WHEELER 
                        Any of you fellow travelers care 
                        for a smoke? 

                                      WALKER 
                        I don t indulge. 

      Stacia just tries to get back to her room, stuck between 
      them. 

                                      WHEELER 
                        Hold on a second. 
                                (indicates the night air) 
                        Savor this quiet. Before it 
                        starts raining. 

      Stacia reluctantly accepts a cigarette. 

                                      WALKER 
                        Rain rinses the air. Clouds 
                        clear, there s tons more stars 
                        to see. It s like a reward, for 
                        staying up late. 

                                      STACIA 
                              (vague, wary) 
                        Uh, yeah. 

                                      WHEELER 
                        Rain plays hell with my truck, 
                        though. 

                                      WALKER 
                        But it can t hurt you. 





                                                35.  



                                      WHEELER 
                        Plenty of other things out here 
                        than can hurt you. The woods are 
                        full of predators. 

                                      STACIA 
                        Right. Listen - thanks guys, but 
                        I ve got to go call my 
                        boyfriend. 

                                      WALKER 
                        I thought you were going to  try 
                        and get some sleep . 

                                      STACIA 
                                (insistent) 
                        He s picking me up tonight. Real 
                        soon. 

      Stacia finally makes it back to her room. Beat as Wheeler 
      and Walker size each other up. 

                                      WHEELER 
                        You made her a bit nervous, I 
                        think. 

                                      WALKER 
                        Maybe it was you. 
                                (beat) 
                        Just a first impression. It 
                        don t mean nothin . 

                                      WHEELER 
                        You have that way with women, am 
                        I right? 

                                      WALKER 
                        They warm up eventually. 
                              (re: Wheeler s truck) 
                        Big truck. What re you hauling? 

                                      WHEELER 
                        Dog food. But I don t have a 
                        full load yet. Soon, though. 
                              (they re done) 
                        Well, I ve gotta hit it pardner. 
                        Nice talking with you. 

      Wheeler exits to his own room. 

      Walker watches him go. After Wheeler s door shuts, he says: 


                                                36.  


                                      WALKER 
                        I ll be seeing you later. I bet. 

      Wheeler holds another quarter up into the light. 

                                      WALKER (CONT D) 
                        I bet you a quarter. 


      As Stacia's SHADOW crosses the bathroom glass, the light 
      changes to REVEAL WALKER, standing back in the shadows 
      behind the motel, having OBSERVED all the foregoing.  

      Walker GRINS, then reaches forward with his switchblade.  

        SKRITCH-SKRITCH, again on the windowsill.  


      Wheeler listens at the wall separating him from Stacia.  


      WITH WHEELER as he does not make a single noise. He GENTLY 
      tests Stacia's doorknob. OPEN. He cautiously opens the door.  


                                                38.  



      Stacia marches along, eager to put the motel far behind her.  

                                      STACIA  
                              (to herself)  
                        I can't believe I took a shower 
                        in that place. Yeek, yeek, 
                        yeek ...  

      She imitates the musical sting from Psycho, making a 
      stabbing motion with one hand.  

                                      STACIA (CON'T) 
                        Real smart.  

      OS sound of Wheeler's Truck, coming over the rise BEHIND 
      her.  

                                                39.  


      As before, Stacia seeks the nearest cover and flattens out.  

      After a beat, the Truck comes grumbling by at walking speed, 
      a door-mounted SEARCHLIGHT sweeping the sides of the road.  


      Stacia watches the Truck from her hide, taillights 
      dwindling.  


      LONG SHOT of flashbar lights gradually approaching. No 
      siren. PULL BACK to include Walker, on the hoof now, 
      WATCHING and deciding to fade back. It might be the cops.  

      A van-style AMBULANCE blazes past, headed in the direction 
      Walker came from. After a beat, Walker steps back out onto 
      the road. It's a little like the Tortoise and the Hare, his 
      confidence in his "pursuit" of Stacia.  


      She looks back over her shoulder, almost as if she can sense 
      Walker back there - somewhere.  

      THE FULL MOON - a long, baleful shot as CLOUDS skirt across 
      it. The distant rumble of THUNDER and oncoming rain.  


      Wheeler's Truck is parked in darkness beneath a faded and 
      half-collapsed BILLBOARD for a long-gone roadside 
      attraction, reading (with intentional TYPOS):  

                                  THE HORRIBLE THING!  
                                        WHAT IS IT?!  
                      DARE YOU SEE IT'S SECRET'S REVEALED?!  
                            LANSDALE EXIT ROUTE 245 - 6 MI.  
                              "COLD" SODA - BEER - GIFTS 

      RAINDROPS begin to pellet down on Wheeler's windshield.  


      Stacia freezes in the oncoming rain, surprised by the light.  

      Wheeler debarks the Truck wearing a rain slicker and 
      carrying a powerful flashlight. Friendly:  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Hey, stranger.  

      Stacia claws out her switchblade as Wheeler approaches.  

                                      STACIA  
                        Stay right there!  I've got a 
                        knife!  

      Wheeler SHRUGS.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        I've got a gun. So I win.  

      Wheeler SHINES the light on his own face, haunted-house 
      style.  

                                      WHEELER (CONT D)  
                        It's me. From the motel.  

      Stacia SQUINTS at him. Oh, yeah. She really does have 
      nowhere to run.  

                                      STACIA  
                                (hesitant)  
                        What ... are you doing out here?  

      Still the distance and tension between them, an uneasy 
      stand-off. Wheeler tries another approach:  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Look - here. It's okay. I'm a 
                        cop.  


                                                41.  


      He displays his BADGE WALLET.  

                                      STACIA  
                                (incredulous)  
                        Are you sure?!  

      This bemuses Wheeler. He pretends to ponder it.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Hmm. Yeah.  
                                (beat)  
                        Come on. It's starting to bucket 
                        down. I can give you a lift to 
                        Ganderton; I'm headed that way.  

      It's a lot like coaxing a small animal out of the 
      underbrush.  

                                      WHEELER (CONT D)  
                        Come on. Please. It's for your 
                        own safety, really.  

                                      STACIA  
                        What does that mean?  

      They have drawn ever-closer, closer ...  

                                      WHEELER  
                        It means there are dangerous 
                        people out on this road tonight. 
                        Which is why I'm out here. Can I 
                        please explain this inside, 
                        where it's dry, huh?  

      He unholsters his automatic and offers it.  

                                      WHEELER (CONT D)  
                        Look, see?  You can even hold 
                        the gun.  

      Stacia cracks. She hustles to the Truck, PAST Wheeler, 
      getting there first.  

                                      STACIA  
                        Come on if you're coming!  

      Stacia really has nowhere to run.  


      Walker marches down the road in utter darkness. Stops. 
      Spreads his arms to the night sky.  

                                      WALKER  
                        Come on, asshole!  I'm right 
                        here!  


      The Truck roars PAST FRAME, kicking spume.  


      Vapor coalesces off the highway surface. Dark, ominous. We 
      hear the distant SOUND of Wheeler's Truck, growing CLOSER at 
      high speed.  

      WIDEN ANGLE  

      To reveal Walker standing there, waiting patiently.  

      Wheeler's headlights illuminate him. Here comes the Truck.  


      A large RATTLER moves across the road in front of the Truck, 
      which STOPS.  


                                                49.  


                                      WHEELER (O.S.)  
                        Why not?  


      RESUMING the shot where Wheeler discovers the bodies of 
      Fergus and Deuce in the luggage bay. Wheeler "scents" Fergus 
      as -  

      DANNY reappears from the front of the bus.  

                                      DANNY  
                        This is not good, dude. Not 
                        good. We need to haul ass back 
                        to that restaurant or get on 
                        your CB and call -  

      Wheeler overrides Danny with a finger to the lips. Shhh. As 
      though to alert him that they are being WATCHED.  

      AT THE TREELINE 

      Walker, having abandoned Marie, hesitates to spy on what 
      he's leaving behind and sees Wheeler and Danny.  

      RESUME WHEELER AND DANNY 

                                      WHEELER  
                        I need to show you something.  

      Wheeler GRABS a fistful of Danny's HAIR and BOUNCES his face 
      off the side of the bus. As Danny REBOUNDS, Wheeler SPINS, 
      coming out of the turn with his PISTOL out and CLOCKING 
      Danny hard enough to knock out teeth. Danny DROPS bonelessly 
      to the ground.  

                                      WHEELER (CONT D)  
                        Idiot.  

      His eyes move back to the treeline, all his senses alert, 
      now. (FLASHBACK ENDS.)  

                                                53.  



      INSIDE TRUCK - NIGHT 

      The Truck NOSES DOWN on the wet road as Wheeler's GUN GOES 
      OFF right in front of Stacia's face. Walker's beer can 
      EXPLODES as the rider-side window BLOWS OUT.  

      THE KNIFE jabs Stacia's neck - not deadly.  

      The Truck FISHTAILS so furiously that it MOMENTARILY GOES UP 
      ON ITS FRONT WHEELS, and - Wheeler and Walker are BOTH 
      JETTISONED THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD.  

      The Truck BOUNCES and judders to a teeth-rattling stop.  

      Wheeler and Walker CRASH-LAND onto the pavement, riddled 
      with cubes of safety glass.  

      Stacia's LEFT HARNESS rips loose and her face BANGS into the 
      dashboard. She REBOUNDS, nose bleeding, vision blurred, to 
      SEE the two killers in the skewed spray of headlights.  

      OUTSIDE TRUCK - NIGHT 

      Walker ROLLS painfully over. He s got a huge wound in his 
      chest from Wheeler s bullet.  

                                      WALKER  
                        Ahhh ... god ... dammit!  

      Wheeler GROPES blindly. Half his face has been sanded off by 
      the pavement. His left arm is not working correctly. Broken 
      bones grind.  

      Walker STANDS, wobbling, gasping, to HAUL WHEELER up by the 
      scruff.  

                                      WALKER (CONT D)  
                        You can do better than this!  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Show me what you've got.  

      Walker FLATHANDS Wheeler in the face, pancaking his nose.  

      Wheeler slams his fist into Walker s wound then throws him 
      to the ground.  




                                                56.  



      INSIDE TRUCK - NIGHT  

      Stacia SEES Wheeler's GUN on the floor. Can't reach it. The 
      harnesses have been loosened by the momentum. She can ALMOST 
      reach it - at considerable strain, maybe dislocating her 
      wrist, her shoulder, to SCOOT the gun closer with her foot, 
      to REACH DOWN with bound hands. Dizzy, panting, she 
      advantages the loose harness to finally ... excruciatingly 
      slowly ... collect the gun.  

      OUTSIDE TRUCK - NIGHT 

      Wheeler turns his attention to Stacia - heading for the 
      overturned truck.  

      Walker comes after him, jumping him from behind. He wants 
      Stacia for himself.  

      Wheeler goes down. Walker reaches the truck - his hand 
      gropes through the windshield reaching for her.  

      INSIDE TRUCK - NIGHT 

      Stacia can't focus her eyes but does her best to RAISE the 
      pistol. To THUMB back the hammer. Painful. She drops it. 

      Then she HEARS a siren approaching.  

      Red flashbar lights reflects on her as the sound of the 
      approaching AMBULANCE comes closer.  

      HOLD HOLD HOLD ON STACIA  

      Her composure fracturing as the SIREN gets louder (o.s.) and 
      the red/white flashbar lights REFLECT off her more 
        intensively. Holding the gun. Gasping. Almost bursting into 
      tears of relief. Almost laughing, borderline nuts.  

                                      STACIA  
                        "Never turn down a ride ..."  
                        That would be ... crazy ...  

      Stacia GRAYS OUT.  


      A HIGH OMNISCIENT POV of the ambulance, dwindling away on 
      the dark road. The FLASHBAR is extinguished, leaving only 
      headlights, taillights, and pretty soon, nothing at all.  

      FADE TO BLACK.  

                                            THE END
