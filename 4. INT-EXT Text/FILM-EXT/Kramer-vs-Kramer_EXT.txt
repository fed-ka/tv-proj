WIDE SHOT
As the doors to the outer lobby open and Ted and O'Connor
appear.
Ted starts to hail a cab, O'Connor stops him.
O'CONNOR
Hey, what's the rush? C'mon, walk me
a couple of blocks.
TED
Jim, I've got to go. I'm already
late 
O'CONNOR
Listen, Ted... I just want to tell
you, when old man Schmidt retires
next year, I've got a pretty good
feeling they'll kick me upstairs...
He turns and starts to walk off down the street, Ted, of
course, follows.
O'CONNOR
...and when they do, I just want you
to know I'm takin' you along with
me.
CUT TO:
ON TED AND O'CONNOR
Tracking with them as they walk.
O'CONNOR
(feeling no pain)
Y'know, Ted, I mean what I said back
there. You did a hell of a job on
this and I want you to know I'm
turning the whole show over to you.
TED
(thrilled)
Wow!
O'CONNOR
I mean it Ted, you're running this
one.
CUT TO:
WIDE SHOT
The building is dark except for the Kramer apartment which
is ablaze with lights. HOLD as we HEAR:
Sound: The phone ringing. Then:
WOMAN'S VOICE
(obviously asleep)
Huh... Hello?
TED
(righteous)
All right, Thelma... That's it. I've
had it. You can call your good friend
Joanna Kramer and tell her enough is
enough, okay? I mean, I don't know
what I did, but you can tell her
she's made her point.
WOMAN'S VOICE
Ted, what are you talking about?!
TED
Don't play innocent with me, Thelma.
You know perfectly well what's going
on.
WOMAN'S VOICE
(exasperated)
Ted, I don't understand a word you're
saying. Where's Joanna?
TED
Ha! You tell me.
Sound-effect, as Ted slams down the receiver.
Instantly a light is turned on two floors below.
CUT TO:
WIDE SHOT
It is a beautiful sunny morning and the super stands in front
of the building hosing down the sidewalk. HOLD as a garbage
truck enters FRAME and the garbage men begin loading sacks
of trash into the back of the truck. As it begins to grind
up the garbage with an ungodly sound, THE CAMERA PANS UP TO
THE EIGHTH FLOOR WINDOWS.
CUT TO:
ON A BUS
As it pulls to a stop. The doors open and a stream of mothers
and children get off. Among them we spot Ted Kramer with
Billy. As they start across the street, Ted reaches down and
takes hold of Billy's hand. The moment they get to the far
side, Billy takes his hand away from Ted's and wipes it on
his pants. Clearly Ted's hands are very sweaty.
CLOSER IN ON THEM
As they start down the block toward Billy's school.
CLOSER IN ON THEM
BILLY
When is mommy coming back?
TED
Soon. I told you before, very soon.
BILLY
(nervous)
Will she pick me up after school?
TED
No. If I'm not here, you go home
with Thelma and Kim.
BILLY
What if she forgets?
TED
(weary)
I'll call Thelma and remind her,
okay? Don't worry.
They walk in silence for a few steps, then:
BILLY
But what happens if she's on her way
to school and she gets runned over
by a truck and killed? What happens
them?
Ted looks at Billy in amazement.
WIDE SHOT
As the two of them enter the school and disappear from view.

CUT TO:
WIDE SHOT
It is that same afternoon and Billy (his clothes are much
dirtier by now) is running back and forth with a group of
other children.
MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain
and buy him an ice.
ON TED
He sits on one of the playground benches, the work he took
from the office stacked beside him on the bench. Sitting
next to him is a personable-looking man of about Ted's age.
He is nattily dressed in a suit complete with vest, tie and
polished Gucci loafers. We will call him THE SATURDAY FATHER.
Note: The Saturday Father and his daughter (a pretty young
girl of about ten) will appear from time to time throughout
the film. He is a divorced father, putting in his time, not
giving a shit about the child. The Saturday Father insists
on treating Ted as though they were members of the same secret
fraternity. And he comes to represent Ted's nightmare of
what might happen to him.
TED
(looking in the
direction of the
voice)
What?
SATURDAY FATHER
Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain,
buy him an ice. It'll kill twenty
minutes.
TED
I've got a lot more than twenty
minutes to kill.
SATURDAY FATHER
Tough...
(checking his watch)
...I get off duty at five-thirty.
(bored, anxious to
make conversation)
How long you been divorced?
TED
(surprised)
Three months. How can you tell?
SATURDAY FATHER
You've got that look. My lady and I
split two years ago in August and
I'm an old pro at this shit. First
thing, stay away from the Children's
Zoo. It's pure hell  if I never see
another chicken, I'll be happy.
(calling out to his
daughter OFF SCREEN)
I'm here, darling. Don't worry...
CLOSER ON TED
Finding this distinctly unpleasant. He glances around, looking
for Billy.
HIS POV
The sprinkler area. Other children are running around, but
there is no sign of Billy.
TED
(calling out)
Billy?
HIS POV
Another area of the playground. Billy is nowhere in sight.
WIDER ON TED
As he grabs his stuff and starts toward the exit of the
playground.
TED
(louder)
Billy?
HIS POV
Looking in another direction. Nothing.
WIDE ON TED
Standing among a crowd of people just outside the entrance
to the playground. He is looking around wildly.
TED
Billy?!
HIS POV
There in the distance is Billy Kramer, running as hard as he
can away from Ted.
ON TED
TRACKING IN FRONT OF HIM as he starts to chase after Billy.
HIS POV  TRACKING FORWARD
It is clear that Billy is running with a purpose.
TED (V.O.)
Billy!
Billy pays no attention to him.
ON TED
TRACKING IN FRONT OF HIM as he continues to chase his son.
HIS POV  TRACKING FORWARD
Closer now, we can SEE that ahead of Billy is a woman that,
from behind, looks remarkably like Joanna.
CLOSER ON TED
As he realizes what is about to happen.
CLOSER ON BILLY
Catching up to the woman.
BILLY
Mommy! Mommy!
A moment later he gets close enough to grab onto her skirt.
As the woman turns around:
CLOSEUP WOMAN
Quite clearly it is not Joanna.
CLOSEUP BILLY
His face becomes impassive again. All the excitement vanishes.
BILLY
Oh. I thought you were my mommy.
CLOSEUP TED
His face reveals all of the pain that Billy's can't.
CUT TO:
ON TED
TRACKING IN FRONT OF HIM as he walks down the street carrying
a large and elaborate papier-mch art thing that Billy made
in school.
CROSS-CUTTING BETWEEN TED AND HIS POV:
As he manages to notice every single pretty girl that passes,
thread his way through the crowd and still balance Billy's
enormous work of art.
CUT TO:
WIDE SHOT
The Saturday Father and his daughter, clearly with nothing
to say to one another, stand eating ices from a nearby vendor.
THE CAMERA PANS AWAY FROM THEM across to Billy, Ted and
Phyllis. She is dressed in a very nice suit, silk blouse,
high heeled shoes and looks distinctly out of place in Central
Park on a Saturday afternoon.
At the moment, Ted is trying to teach Billy how to bat.
TED
Now look, you hold it like this...
(he places Billy's
hands on the bat
just so)
...and you swing like this...
(taking him through
the motions)
ON PHYLLIS
Watching. She can't believe what she's seeing. Finally, she
can't stand it any longer.
PHYLLIS
(impatient)
No, no, no, Kramer. That's not how
you do it. Look...
She crosses to Billy, gently takes the bat from him and
demonstrates.
PHYLLIS
...you hold it like this...
(showing him her grip)
Farther down the bat. And you swing
like this...
(to Ted)
Throw me one.
ON TED
As he gives Billy a look that says, we have to humor her. He
throws a ball.
ON PHYLLIS
As she swings, connects and slams a ball in a long, looping
fly that goes at least two hundred feet.
ON TED
Watching the ball disappear in the distance, he turns back
to Phyllis, open-mouthed.
CLOSE ON PHYLLIS
Embarrassed, she grins, shrugs and hands the bat back to
Billy.
CUT TO:
SERIES OF TRACKING SHOTS
As Ted runs along beside Billy, who is learning to ride a
bike.
Then, in the last shot, Ted lets go of the bike and runs
along just behind. Slowly as Billy gains confidence he speeds
up, leaving Ted farther and farther behind. Finally, as Billy
glances over his shoulders.
CUT TO:
TED'S POV
As the boy, by now a considerable distance away, turns and
waves.
ON TED
Waving back, a grin of enormous pride on his face. He glances
around, embarrassed to make sure no one is watching and wipes
tears from his eyes.
CUT TO:
ON A BUS
As it pulls to a stop and a mob of mothers and children get
off.
Among them we spot Billy and Ted Kramer. THE CAMERA PANS
WITH THEM as they cross the street and enter the school
building. THE CAMERA CONTINUES IT'S PAN across the street,
to a Coffee Shop with large plate glass windows facing the
school. There, standing in the window, watching, is Joanna
Kramer. HOLD AS THE CAMERA SLOWLY ZOOMS IN ON HER and we SEE
a look of overwhelming pain on her face.
CUT TO:
ON TED AND THELMA
Sitting on a bench, the area around them is stacked high
with toys that the kids have brought with them to the park.
OFF SCREEN we can HEAR Billy and Kim racing around, playing.
TED
(a little too casual)
Thel, you ever hear from Joanna?
THELMA
(also with deliberate
nonchalance)
Not for a couple of months. The last
time I heard from her she was living
in San Francisco.
TED
(surprised)
California?
THELMA
(watching him)
Uh, huh... She said she had a good
job, was playing a lot of tennis.
She wanted to know all about Billy.
There is a beat of silence, then:
TED
(the real question)
She ever ask about me?
THELMA
(lying)
Uh, huh... Yeah...
TED
What d'you tell her?
THELMA
I told her you're doing a pretty
good job.
BILLY (O.S.)
Daddy! Daddy!
Ted glances around:
HIS POV
Billy and Kim are standing near the jungle Jim. Billy has a
toy airplane in his hand.
BILLY
Daddy, look! Presenting Billy Kramer's
Fantastic Superjet!
And he begins to race around the area, making jet noises and
holding the airplane in his hand.
REVERSE ON TED
Watching him, smiling.

Weaving in and around the benches. He turns and starts back
towards Ted. As he does:
QUICK CUT: INSERT:

ON BILLY
As he starts to fall, still holding onto the airplane.
QUICK CUT: TED
Watching, horrified.

As he hits the concrete.
ON TED
He leaps to his feet, starts toward the boy.
ON BILLY
As he looks up.
JUMP CUT IN TO EXTREME CLOSEUP
There is a terrible-looking gash running from his cheek into
his hairline.
Kim screams at the sight of the blood.
BILLY
(terrified)
Daddy!
CUT TO:
ON THE ENTRANCE
As Ted, carrying Billy, wrapped in his coat, comes barreling
out of the park, nearly knocking over several people with
shopping bags, and begins running like hell WITH THE CAMERA
TRACKING JUST IN FRONT OF HIM. In the BACKGROUND we SEE Thelma
and Kim chasing after him. THE LENGTH OF THE TRACKING SHOT
SHOULD BE MUCH LONGER THAN WE EXPECT. IT SHOULD, IN FACT,
COVER THE THREE CITY BLOCKS BETWEEN THE KRAMER APARTMENT AND
THE HOSPITAL, ACROSS STREETS WITHOUT STOPPING FOR THE LIGHT,
ALONG CROWDED SIDEWALKS WITHOUT STOPPING, ENDING FINALLY ON
THE EMERGENCY ENTRANCE TO THE HOSPITAL. IT MUST BE GENUINELY
SUPERHUMAN, GENUINELY HEROIC.

As he walks along the street in a state of total shock. Behind
him, in the windows of expensive stores we note Christmas
decorations.
CUT TO:
ON A TELEPHONE BOOTH
Ted stands inside, talking on the phone. AS THE CAMERA DOLLIES
IN CLOSER, he hangs up the receiver and takes the employment
section of the New York Times which is filled with listings
he has circled and crosses off one. He goes on to the next,
takes a dime from the stack on the shelf in front of him and
starts to dial.

ESTABLISHING SHOT
CUT TO:

As it pulls to a stop, the doors open and, along with the
usual flood of mothers and children we SEE Ted and Billy.
THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH THEM as they walk to school. Billy is
talking a mile a minute, describing in minute detail the
plot of an episode of "I Dream of Jeannie." Ted listens
intently, then, almost involuntarily, he glances over his
shoulder in the direction of the Coffee Shop.
HIS POV
There, standing in the window, watching, is Joanna.
ON TED AND BILLY
As they continue to walk. Ted's eyes remain on Joanna. As
they reach the door to the school, Ted looks at his son.
TED
(kissing Billy goodbye)
You're a terrific kid, Billy Kramer.
He stands watching as Billy rushes off into the building.
Then he turns back and once again looks in the direction of
the Coffee Shop.

Ted? John Shaunessy here. I just got
a call from your wife's lawyer. She
wants to see the kid.
CUT TO:
ON TED AND BILLY
TRACKING IN FRONT OF THEM as they walk along the Central
Park side of Fifth Ave. From their attitude it is clear that
each of them, for their own reasons, is very nervous.
TED'S POV  TRACKING FORWARD
About half a block away Joanna paces back and forth. She
hasn't seen them and it is clear that she is as nervous as
they are.
ANOTHER ANGLE ON TED AND BILLY
Ted stops, turns to Billy and gives him a last-minute check.
Then, spotting a smudge he takes his handkerchief, spits on
it and wipes the child's chin. Now satisfied, he takes Billy's
hand and they continue. Suddenly:
CLOSEUP BILLY
As he spots his mother.
BILLY
Mommy!
QUICK CUT: JOANNA
As she turns, spots Billy, starts to run.
ON BILLY
TRACKING WITH HIM as he lets go of Ted's hand and starts to
run flat out toward his mother. She kneels, opens her arms
wide for him and he goes barreling into her, almost knocking
her down from the impact.
JOANNA
(somewhere between
laughter and tears)
Oh, Billy... Oh my Billy... Oh my
son...
WIDER SHOT
Joanna gets to her feet and takes Billy's hand.
JOANNA
(to Ted, but looking
at Billy)
I'll have him back at six.
And they start off in the opposite direction.
ON TED
Realizing that Billy has not said good-bye, has not looked
at him once.
JUMP CUT TO:

Ted stands helpless, watching them leave.
JUMP CUT TO:
WIDER SHOT
Ted, now almost lost from view on the crowded street, still
hasn't moved.
FADE TO BLACK:
WIDE SHOT
Ted and Phyllis, getting ready to go to bed. They look like
a couple that has been married at least five years. Ted is
busy talking as he takes off his tie, jacket and starts to
unbutton his shirt. Phyllis is getting undressed also, hanging
things in the closet, putting things away in drawers. But as
Ted continues to talk, she watches him apprehensively, it is
clear that something is wrong.
TED
(he has become an
armchair lawyer)
So, naturally, you assume that since
Joanna left, that would be a
compelling point against her, right?
PHYLLIS
(thoughtful)
Right.
TED
But it doesn't work that way. A major
decision was handed down by the
Appellate Court in 1969  in the
case of Haskins vs. Haskins.
PHYLLIS
Kramer 
TED
Now in Haskins vs. Haskins the court
ruled in favor of the mother, thus
establishing a precedent for awarding
the child to the mother even though
she previously abandoned the baby.
PHYLLIS
Kramer... There's something I ought
to tell you.
TED
Yeah?
PHYLLIS
I've been offered a job in Washington
with H.E.W.
CLOSE ON TED
He stops what he is doing, turns to her.
TED
And?
PHYLLIS
(a deep breath)
I'm going to take it.
REACTION  TED
He sits down on the bed.
PHYLLIS
It's a very good job  too good to
pass up. I'll be handling funding
for the whole...
(she stops, sits beside
him on the bed)
Look, I...
(she means love)
..."like" you a lot. And you...
(she means love)
..."like" me, okay? Maybe if it was
a year from now, maybe things would
be different...
TED
(quiet)
But it's not a year from now, is it?
She shakes her head, then, reaches out and touches him.
PHYLLIS
I'll miss you, Kramer...
WIDE SHOT
It is a Saturday afternoon. HOLD FOR A BEAT as we SEE Ted
Kramer and Billy approaching. Billy is talking a mile a
minute. Ted listens intently, absorbed in the boy's
description. As they turn into the entrance of the office
building:

Taking Billy to school. They stop at the entrance, Ted kisses
his son good-bye and stands for a moment watching as the boy
runs into the building.
CUT TO:

It is a bleak January morning, the streets around the

Yeah, well he did, didn't he.
JOANNA
Please, Ted. I never would have

TED
I'm not interested, Joanna. Goodbye.

It is a bleak winter's day. THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH THEM as
they walk along, Ted carrying a bag of groceries, Thelma
with cleaning.
The children run around them, playing.
THELMA
You heard anything yet?
TED
(shakes his head)
Any day.
They walk in silence for several beats, each clearly lost in
their own thoughts. Then:
THELMA
Ted.
TED
(preoccupied)
Uh, huh...
THELMA
(this is hard to say)
Ah, Charley and I are... Well, we're
thinking about... I mean, actually
we're sort of talking about maybe
getting back together.
TED
(thunderstruck)
You and Charley?
Thelma nods.
TED
Really?
Thelma nods.
TED
(conflicting emotions)
Hey, that's terrific.
THELMA
(hastily)
Maybe. I said maybe.
(apologizing for her
good fortune)
What I mean is, ah... I don't think
it'll really work out, but Charley
seems to want it, so...
She leaves the sentence unfinished. They walk in silence for
several more steps. Then she takes his hand.
THELMA
(can't help grinning)
Oh, God... Ted, I am really scared.
They walk in silence for a beat, then Ted looks OFF SCREEN,
spots something:
HIS POV
The Saturday Father, restless, bored, walking with his
daughter who is also bored. It is clear that they have nothing
to say to one another. He looks around, spots Ted, waves and
starts in his direction.
CLOSEUP TED
He reacts as though he has seen a vision of his own death.
TED
(to Thelma, urgent)
C'mon.

HOLD FOR A BEAT, then:
CUT TO:
ON A CORNER MAILBOX
As Ted mails the letter.
TED (V.O.)
At times, in the night he will have
nightmares, one particular monster
is called The Face. The Face, as
best as I can determine, looks like
a circus clown without a body, and
from what the pediatrician says, and
what I have read, may be sexual fear
of losing his penis, or a fear of
his own anger, or just a circus clown
he saw once.
CUT TO:
ON THE SAME MAILBOX
As a sack of mail is loaded into a truck.
TED (V.O.)
His doctor, by the way, is still Ed
Davies. The Sundafed is for colds,
one tablespoon every four hours. I
will pack it in the blue suitcase.
CUT TO:
WIDE SHOT
A POSTMAN enters the building carrying a bag of mail.
TED (V.O.)
His best stories have been Babar and
Winnie the Pooh up to now, with Batman
moving up. His housekeeper has been
Etta Willewska and she is the main
reason for the note. She is a loving
woman, conscientious, very concerned
about Billy and more important, Billy
cares about her.
CUT TO:
It is a clear, cold beautiful winter's day. Ted and Billy
walk
along the beach at the edge of the water. THE CAMERA TRACKS
WITH THEM. There are several beats of silence as Ted tries
to think of how to begin. Finally:
TED
Billy, sometimes when a mother and a
father are divorced, there's a
discussion about who the child should
live with, the mother or the father.
Now there is a man who is very wise.
He's called a judge. And a judge has
a lot of experience with divorces
and he decides who it would be best
for the child to live with.
BILLY
Why does he decide?
TED
Because... Well, that's what he does.
He's a very powerful man.
BILLY
Like a principal?
TED
Bigger than a principal. The judge
sits in robes in a big chair... The
judge has thought a lot about us,
about you and me and your mom, and
he has decided...
(a deep breath)
...he has decided that it would be
best for you to live with your mom
Joanna in her apartment.
(fake cheerful)
And I'm very lucky. Because even
though you'll live with your mom
Joanna I'll get to see you once a
week for dinner and a couple of
weekends a month.
BILLY
I don't understand, daddy.
TED
(trying very hard not
to cry)
What don't you understand, pal?
BILLY
Where will my bed be, where will I
sleep?
TED
At your mom's. She'll have a bed for
you in your own room.
BILLY
Where will my toys be?
TED
I'll send your toys there and I'm
sure you'll get some new ones.
BILLY
Who will read me my stories?
TED
Your mom.
BILLY
(worried)
Daddy, what if The Face comes when
I'm at mommy's?
TED
Your mom knows all about The Face,
okay? Don't worry, she'll tell The
Face to beat it.
BILLY
Will you come and say good-night to
me every night?
Suddenly Ted can't stand it any longer.
TED
Look, it's getting cold. Why don't
you go inside where it's warm. I'll
be along in a minute.
Billy hangs back, watching Ted.
TED
Go on, scoot.
The boy turns and runs back along the beach toward the house.
Then, he stops, turns back to look once more at his father.
HIS POV  LONG SHOT
Ted stands at the ocean's edge, his back to CAMERA, weeping.
FADE TO BLACK:
WIDE SHOT
It is early Monday morning.
CUT TO:
ON TED AND BILLY
TRACKING JUST IN FRONT OF THEM as they walk to the park.
They are deep in conversation, although we are too far away
to bear what they are saying. HOLD ON THEM and, as they reach
the entrance to the park, Billy first, then Ted begin to
run, overwhelmed with the sheer joy of being alive, of being
together. As they continue to run, THE CAMERA PULLS BACK AND
UP AND WE SEE that they are only two among thousands of
parents and children in Central Park on a sunny afternoon.
THE CAMERA CONTINUES TO PULL BACK until they are lost from
view and it is...
