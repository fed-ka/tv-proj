
      A familiar, gleaming red chunk of rock is held up to the sun 
      by LUCILLE NEWTRICH, a sassy, sexy woman of presence and
      determination.

                                      LUCILLE
                     Ready?

      NELL NEWTRICH, her serious and brainy little sis, checks a 
      futuristic looking video camera, almost gun-like in 
      appearance.  It is a laser.

                                      NELL
                     Ready.

      Lucille gives Nell the rock.  Nell, hands shaking nervously,
      drops it.  Lucille glares.

                                      NELL (CONT'D)
                     Sorry.

      Nell opens the breach of the laser and fumbles the Kryptonite
      into it.

                                      LUCILLE
                     I thought you said I could count on
                     you.

                                      NELL
                     You can.

      Nell snaps the breach shut -- on her thumb -- which causes 
      her to drop the laser, but Lucille, expecting this, grabs 
      the laser before it hits the ground.  Then grabs Nell by the
      collar.

                                      LUCILLE
                     Tell me this is going to work.

                                      NELL
                     It's going to work.

                                      LUCILLE
                     Tell me why.

      Lois makes her way through the crowd, passing FIREMEN and    (X)

      as he sees a RED FLASH from somewhere in the crowd,
      instinctively grabs Lois and pulls her into a protective
      hug.  The RED BEAM hits Superman's back in a BLINDING BURST.
      A CRACKLING GLOW engulfs Lois and Superman.

                     Well, go get 'em.

      He turns and makes a skyward leap.  Only he doesn't take
      off.  A FEW in the crowd note this.

      They lie on the ground, intact.

                     Clark, I don't like this.

                     When do you think S.T.A.R. Labs'll 
                     be able to tell us about that

                                      CLARK
                     Lois, I'm sure they'll figure it 
                     out, just like I'm sure we'll track 
                     down whoever did this.

                     Oh, don't even _try_ to pull that.

                                      CLARK
                     Okay.  I'm upset.  But I also 
                     _know_ we're going to figure this 
                     out.  In the mean time, you've got 
                     powers that need to be 
                     controlled... or you're going to do 
                     some damage without meaning to.

      Suddenly her head snaps around and she peers in the 
      direction of a nearby road.

                                      CLARK
                           What?

  19  ON THE ROAD - A TRUCK                                      19   

      careens into view, out of control.

      Clark instinctively rips his shirt open, exposing the "S"
      and takes a few preliminary steps, then suddenly remembers.
      Lois becomes a SUPER-BLUR and WHOOSHES past him.


  21  ON THE ROAD - THE TRUCK speeds for a deadly curve.         21   


  22  LOIS                                                       22   

      BLURS into its path.  The grill hits her hand.  The truck 
      PLOWS into her.  Her shoes SMOKE as they're dragged 
      backwards along the road, grinding her heels off.  Then, as 
      the truck stops, The DRIVER gets out, amazed and confused.

                                      DRIVER
                     Lady, did you just do what I think
                     you did?

                     No, please...

      Superman comes running up behind the truck, then slows to a
      walk.

                                      SUPERMAN
                     Everyone okay?

                           (now he gets it)
                     Oh, Superman.  Thanks.  Geez for a 
                     minute there I thought this lady 
                     here --

      Lois laughs at the ludicrousness of this.  Superman joins 
      her.


  23  MINUTES LATER - LOIS AND SUPERMAN                          23   

      are walking back across the field to her jeep.  Lois is
      carrying her heel-less shoes.

                                      LOIS
                     These shoes were eighty-five 
                     dollars.  Does the superheroes 
                     union cover expenses?

                                      SUPERMAN
                     No, but it does bring up an 
                     interesting issue.

                                      LOIS
                     Which is?

                                      SUPERMAN
                     You're just not the kind of person 
                     who can sit and watch someone in 
                     trouble if you can help...

                                      LOIS
                     Oh, I've got a bad feeling about
                     where this is going.

                                      SUPERMAN
                     ... but you don't want the world 
                     knowing it's Lois Lane stopping 
                     trucks, so...

                                      LOIS
                     Does this mean I have to start

      An outdoor area for exploding, shooting and generally 
      testing cool stuff.  Superman with a SCIENTIST, who holds 
      the burned-out laser.

                                      SCIENTIST
                     I thought I had it working but it
                     just burned up again.

                     Like any other laser, except all 
                     its power seems to refract through
                     that chunk of Red Kryptonite in the 
                     casing.  What happened when the

                     Well, between you and me, I'm not 
                     quite myself.  I'd like to get this 
                     working again... fast.

                                      SCIENTIST
                     I'll do my best.


      Jimmy and Perry hustle the last few STRAGGLERS out, past a   (X)
      stack of water cooler bottles apparently left at the door    (X)
      in the panic.  A canvas tarp partially covers them.  Jimmy   (X)
      and Perry move the Stragglers across the street, where they  (X)

      Nell hits a button on a remote control device.



      The trail of kerosene begins in here, where a
      radio-controlled lighter is flicked on and IGNITES the LINE
      of gas.  It rushes out --


      -- toward Superman. He stands right in its path, about to
      be engulfed.

      FADE IN:


      The FLAME races toward Superman.  Thinking fast, he whips
      the tarp off the top of the stack of water bottles, drops to
      his knees with it, and uses it to wipe the kerosene.  Then, 
      just as the FLAMES reach the tarp, he rolls out of the way.

      The tarp is CONSUMED.  The line of FLAME is slowed but not
      stopped.  Superman looks inside the Planet lobby and sees a 
      fire extinguisher on the wall.  As he starts for it --

      A BLAST OF SUPER-BREATH from above blows the FLAMING TARP 
      out.

      Superman looks up as the Crowd 'ooooohs' at the sight of --

      Lois, resplendent in tights, cape and mask, hovering to 
      Earth, blowing out the last of the fire.

                                      HUSBAND
                     It's not coming out of my pocket,
                     lady.

                                      ULTRA WOMAN
                     Look, I know you're upset --

                                      HUSBAND
                     You tore up my car!

                                      ULTRA WOMAN
                     Because your wife was choking.  And
                     by the way, she's fine. I'm sure
                     she appreciates your concern.

      Another CHEER from the Crowd and the Husband turns away,
      chagrined.  PEOPLE take her picture.  She's handed papers to
      autograph.  She tries to take it all in stride.  Then a GIRL
      runs up.

                                      GIRL
                     Ultra Woman, on LNN, there's an oil
                     fire in Texas...!

                                      ULTRA WOMAN
                     Texas...?

      Ultra Woman turns to fly off, then hears A CRY FOR HELP 
      nearby.  She turns and starts to fly off the other way.  
      Then she hears A SECOND CRY and turns in that direction.  
      Then she hears an ALARM go off.

                                      GIRL
                     Hurry!  They say a whole town could
                     burn!

      She stands, not knowing which way to go first, the SOUNDS of
      mayhem pounding her.  Finally, she takes a deep, calming
      breath and CAPES OUT.                                        (X)



      Clark walks.  Then, from a nearby alley, he hears the SOUNDS
      of a struggle.


  43  IN THE ALLEY                                               43   

      TWO THUGS attack a SKINNY KID.  ONE holds him down while the
      SECOND THUG gets his wallet, opens it and --

                                      THUG
                     Fourteen bucks? That's it?

      The Thug draws his fist back.  Clark catches it and whips
      the Thug around.

                                      CLARK
                     All his, so give it back.

      The kid scrambles to a corner.  The Thug knocks Clark's hand
      off; he and his partner circle Clark menacingly.

                                      THUG
                     I got a better idea.  Gimme yours.

                                      CLARK
                     Come get it.

      They attack.  But even without super-powers, Clark is nimble
      and fierce.  As he ducks Thug One's roundhouse, he
      SPIN-KICKS Thug Two into the garbage, then pivots back
      around... as Thug One whips out a gleaming knife.

                                      THUG
                     You wanna get crazy? Huh?

      He stabs at Clark and catches his sleeve.  Clark winces in
      pain and sees blood on his wrist.  The Thug grins and
      swipes.  Clark dodges.  The Thug circles, then lunges hard.
      Clark sidesteps, catches his wrist and flips the punk onto
      his back.  Clark takes the knife away, straightens and --

      Thug Two SMASHES Clark on the back of the head with a pipe.
      Clark drops, stunned.  Thug Two prepares to beat Clark to a
      pulp...  From behind, comes the SOUND of a gun being cocked.

                                      LUCILLE (O.S.)
                     Back off, Junior.

      Thugs One and Two look up to see Lucille with a gun, Nell at
      her side.  The Thugs don't move.

                                      LUCILLE
                     NOW.

      She FIRES, just missing them.  The Thugs run out of alley.
      Clark lifts his aching head.

                                      CLARK
                     Thank you...

      He is of course surprised when the gun is trained on him.

                                      LUCILLE
                     Our pleasure, Mr. Kent.



      Lucille slips the gun in her waistband and studies the night
      sky.  Nell, holding the laser, glances back into the garage.

                                      NELL
                     If he doesn't yell for help we're
                     not really going to ... ?
                           (off Lucille's look)
                     Lucille, come _on_.

                                      LUCILLE
                     It's up to him.  Which any Buddhist
                     will assure you slides the whole
                     thing right out of murder and into
                     suicide... keeping us karmically
                     covered.



      Nell looks at her watch, horrified.  Lucille looks at her
      watch, resigned.



      Nell and Lucille both whirl at the O.S. SOUND of the chair
      CRASHING INTO THE FLOOR.  Then a FLASH OF LIGHT and an
      ELECTRIC SIZZLE through the doorway O.S.  Lucille squints
      against the LIGHT BURST.  Nell hides her eyes.



      Clark takes off like a running back and tears around a
      corner.  Lucille runs after him, gets around the corner
      and... he's gone.  Looks every which way but no Clark.

                                      LUCILLE
                           (to Nell)
                     Well.  Another job well done.
                     Don't you ever get tired of
                     perfection?

      She and Nell head back to the garage.  PAN DOWN TO REVEAL
      CLARK in the thick bushes that line the lawn, hiding. As
      soon as the sisters go back into the garage, he gets up and
      runs.



      Deserted.  Clark, arms still bound behind him, staggers up,
      winded, achy.  Collapses.  GROANS.  Closes his eyes.

      We hear a familiar O.S. WHOOSH and suddenly Ultra Woman is
      beside him.

                                      ULTRA WOMAN
                     Oh, my God...

      He sits up.

                                      CLARK
                     Hi.

      She snaps his bonds free. He rubs his wrists.

                                      ULTRA WOMAN
                     Clark, what happened? Who did
                     this?



      Ultra Woman LANDS Lucille gently amidst the small CROWD.

                                      ULTRA WOMAN
                     Do you want to talk to someone?  A
                     doctor?

                                      LUCILLE
                     No. But I would like a hug.

                                      ULTRA WOMAN
                           (hesitates)

      Clark comes running around the corner.

                     No! It's her --

      In mid-hug, Ultra Woman looks up and sees Clark -- but 
      doesn't see Nell behind _her_ with the laser.  Clark is too 
      far to stop it.  Nell FIRES.  The RED BEAM hits Ultra Woman
      first, then ENGULFS her and Lucille in that EERIE GLOW.

      Both women are dazed.  Then Lucille grabs Ultra Woman and 
      HOISTS her up.

                     Hey, you in the dime store dress!
                     over here!

      Lucille turns, pissed.

                           (circling toward Nell)

                     Shut up, Nell.

                            OF FRAME)

                     Well, you're losing the one with
                     taste.

      As Clark taunts, he puts himself between Lucille and Nell.

      Lucille charges and becomes a SUPER-BLUR.  Clark leaps out 
      of the way.  The BLUR shoots by him and RAMS into Nell and 
      now both sisters are a SPEEDING BLUR that zooms OUT OF 
      FRAME.  Clark runs to Ultra Woman.

                                      ULTRA WOMAN
                     That's the nasty thing about those

      A cab pulls up and SCREECHES to a halt.  Nell, Lucille and 
      Ultra Woman are all startled as the sight of Superman, who 
      leaps out with the laser.  Lucille lets out a SUPER-BREATH 
      that knocks him back into the cab.  The laser clatters to

      her hand, which she flings across the street into Nell's
      stomach, knocking her back.

      Lucille starts to go for Lois but Superman grabs the
