A heavy rain falls on JOE SHAPE, 40's, who wears a black hat
and holds a black umbrella as he bangs on the window of a
small GUARDHOUSE in front of a LARGE GATED PRISON. Joe is

FRANK SR.

doing when we met.
PAULA

Paula steps away from Frank, and she starts to dance a ballet,
smiling as she tries to remember the steps.

It had been months since we had even
seen a woman, and here's this blonde
angel on stage -- and the men are

I turned to my buddies, and I said..
