  ALAN s at the table.  He s got a CHESS SET spread out in 
  front of him, examining and polishing some of the pieces.  He 
  looks up as CHARLIE bounds down the stairs, heading out.

                              ALAN
                Hey, Charlie, you headed to school?

                              CHARLIE
                Uh, I need to go by the FBI first, 
                drop off some crime index work I 
                did for Don, but after that, yeah.  
                      (seeing the chess set)
                Why?  Are you looking for a match?

                              ALAN
                      (absurd)
                What, with you?  You know I said 
                I d never do that again.  Have to 
                put up with you looking bored the 
                whole time, or condescending... or 
                bored and condescending... 

                              CHARLIE
                Well, seeing as your usual chess 
                partner, Larry, is currently in low-
                earth orbit, I thought maybe you 
                were getting desperate.

                              ALAN
                Not at all.  Millie says she has a 
                pretty good game, too.

                              CHARLIE
                Really.  I ll be sure to teach her 
                some of my best condescending looks 
                then...

                              ALAN
                No!  No coaching, I mean.  Millie 
                brings her own game, not yours.

                Okay, but you re forgetting, Dad, 
                she s a mathematician.  That gives 
                her the same analytical edge that I 
                have.

  Alan suddenly stops polishing chess pieces.

                              ALAN
                Thank you.  I forgot about that.  
                I ll have to reconsider some of my 
                  strategy...

                              CHARLIE
                You ever think maybe you take the 
                whole thing just a little too 
                  seriously.

                              ALAN
                Charlie.  It s chess.  Do I really 
                have to say more?

  Alan picks up another chess piece, starts polishing.  Charlie 
  watches him a beat, gets a chuckle.

                              CHARLIE
                No, Dad.  You sure don t... 

                              ALAN
                I ll see you later.

  Colby comes over, joins them (as Charlie approaches in b.g.).

                              COLBY
                I ve been on the phone with some of 
                the other salvage companies in 
                town...  Turns out every dive crew 
                between here and San Diego is out 
                right now.  And they re all looking 
                for the same thing: the  Cheetah. 

  He reveals a PHOTO of a sleek 60  yacht.

                      (reaches the group)
                A 60 foot Open Class racing yacht.  
                It went down a couple days ago.

                              COLBY
                It sank about 40 miles out.  Deep 
                water...

                              DON
                Wait a minute, I read about that.  
                It was taking part in some  round-
                  the-world race.  There s still a 
                big search going on...

                              CHARLIE
                Yeah.  They were headed for Marina 
                del Rey when she sank.  Looks like 
                the Skipper went down with her...

                              MEGAN
                Charlie, are you a closet 
                   yachtsman,  or just incredibly 
                well-up on the news...?

                              CHARLIE
                Neither.   Open Class  is the 
                cutting edge of racing yachts.  A 
                ton of math goes into their design.  
                A lot of it, I don t mind saying, 
                based on my early work in  
                  computational fluid dynamics...

                              COLBY
                Wait.  Fluid dynamics.  That s like 
                  aerodynamics, except in water?

                              CHARLIE *
                Sure.  Actually you can think of  *
                air as a very thin liquid.   *

  AUDIENCE VISION

  The low, sleek profile of a SPORTS CAR in a wind-tunnel.  
  Carried by the air currents, a ribbon of SMOKE snakes low 
  over the hood, up the windshield and over the car...

                              CHARLIE (V.O.)
                Both air and water stick to *
                surfaces as they travel over them.  *
                It s called friction.  But we can *
                create mathematically optimized *
                designs that reduce friction... *

  As Charlie speaks, the Sports Car body inverts and becomes 
  the hull of a boat, the Smoke ribbon now trailing under and 
  around the hull s keel design, accompanied by complex 
    equations...

                              CHARLIE (V.O.)
                  ...lowering the drag as air, or in *
                this case water, moves around the *
                design.  The lower the drag, the *
                faster your boat...

                Charlie, how much do you know about 
                this particular yacht?

                              CHARLIE
                Not too much.  Designs are kept 
                secret before a race.  But these 
                boats can cost easily eight or ten 
                million dollars.  Even as a 
                  shipwreck, the Cheetah still has to 
                be worth a couple million...

                              COLBY
                Explains why everyone s out there 
                looking.

                              COLBY
                So we re talking, basically, about 
                  a treasure hunt.

                              CHARLIE
                  Somewhere out there, on the bottom 
                of the ocean, is a two million 
                dollar prize...

                              MEGAN
                And somewhere out there is a person

  TWO SECOND GRAPHIC BUMPER:


  DESIGN PLANS for the Cheetah are tacked up.  Charlie goes 
  over them, making notes and calculations on the chalk board.  
  MILLIE pops her head in --

                                MILLIE
                Charlie, quick question for you --
                      (as Charlie turns)
                How good is your dad at chess?

                              CHARLIE
                He s good, don t worry.  He ll give 
                you a real game...

                                MILLIE
                Uh-oh.  I m afraid I might ve 
                  misrepresented my abilities.

                              CHARLIE
                You don t play chess...

                                MILLIE
                I do.  I mean, I can...  The little 
                horsey piece...  That goes up two 
                over one, right?
                      (then)
                Oh, well, it s just for fun anyway.  
                Alan d probably enjoy being able to 
                teach me something...

  Charlie looks worried.  Millie glances at the design plans.

                                MILLIE
                What s all this?  Are you building 
                a boat on University time? *

                              CHARLIE
                They re design plans for a racing 
                yacht that recently came apart and 
                sank.

                                MILLIE
                      (off his equations)
                And you re looking for the flaw...

                              CHARLIE
                I am... but I haven t found it.  As 
                far as I can tell, the design s 
                solid.  With the allotted load of 
                crew and supplies, there s no 
                reason the keel should have failed.

                                MILLIE
                You know, Charlie, I have some 
                sailing experience myself.
                      (adding quickly)
                For real.  Not like my chess 
                  experience.

                              CHARLIE
                No, I didn t realize...

                              MILLIE
                I took a three month sabbatical 
                from MIT, spent it navigating the 
                South Pacific with a friend I knew 
                back in grad school.
                      (then)
                It sounds as if I m in danger of 
                not having a point here, but I do.  
                And that s this...  Out at sea, all 
                bets are off.  You encounter forces 
                you could never anticipate...
                        (remembering, not fondly)
                Now some of those forces have to do 
                with being confined to a very small 
                space with someone you only thought 
                you knew; someone clearly enamored 
                with the sound of their own voice 
                and able to talk endlessly without 
                even the need to breathe...

                              CHARLIE
                But the real point...

                                MILLIE
                Oh, yes, my point...  The ocean has 
                to have exerted tremendous physical 
                  pressures on this boat.  Have you 
                  accounted for compressive creep?  
                Tensile stress?  Material fatigue?




                                                                          (CONTINUED)  NUMB3RS 313/50 "Finders Keepers" GREEN Rev  11/30/06    16.

                              CHARLIE
                I ran calculations to evaluate the 
                  probabilities of material failures, 
                and to check if the designs would 
                  withstand ocean conditions...  I 
                can t find a single flaw.

                                MILLIE
                Then why did the yacht sink?

  Off Charlie s wondering --


  Megan at her desk.  She hangs up the phone, turns to Don,  *
  calls in Colby as well, who s passing with Liz -- *

                              MEGAN *
                Colby, you ll want to hear this  *
                too.   *
                      (as they gather) *
                The lab just finished a preliminary *
                analysis of the blood you found on 
                the Morris salvage barge.  They  *
                isolated three distinct samples.  
                One belonging to our dead diver, 
                Koontz, and two others...

                              DON
                The Morris brothers...?

                              MEGAN
                The blood-types are consistent.

                              COLBY
                So the Morris brothers become 
                  potential victims not suspects.  
                Which means our focus shifts where?

                              MEGAN
                Other salvage companies maybe, 
                someone trying to keep the Morris 
                crew away from finding the Cheetah?

                              LIZ
                Or it could be related to one of 
                the drug operations I was telling 
                Don about.  Either these guys were 
                  involved... or maybe their search 
                for the yacht took them too close 
                to something they weren t supposed 
                to see...

                The barge.  The blood suggests the 
                murder took place on board, but we 
                don t know where the barge was when 
                it happened.

                              MEGAN
                If we knew where it was, we could 
                  determine what other ships were in 
                the area, who might ve had access.

                              DON
                Exactly.  Who had opportunity.

  Charlie and Alan.  Charlie s animated, carrying on about the 
  Cheetah s design...

                              CHARLIE
                Dad, I m telling you, from a math 
                  standpoint, the designs for this 
                yacht are amazing.  Almost has me 
                thinking about getting back into my 
                fluid dynamics work again.

                Hey, Donny.  Just missed dinner.  
                Plenty of leftovers though.

                No.  No answers, anyway.  Problem

  Ocean charts, a book of tide tables, maps of ocean currents.  
  Charlie s at work in his office, scribbling equations on the

                              MILLIE

                Uh, no, actually.  The case s taken

                              MILLIE
                Oh.  So what is it now?

                              CHARLIE
                I m trying to retrace the path of a

                              CHARLIE
                Don suspects a murder took place on 
                board.  If I can tell him where the 
                barge went, he can hopefully figure 
                out who else was in the area...

                                MILLIE
                You mean the killer...
                      (then, a let down)
                Still, a barge...  Doesn t quite 
                have the snap and sex appeal of a 
                racing yacht, does it?

                              CHARLIE
                Not exactly.

  Charlie notices Millie is carrying two books.

                              CHARLIE
                You re reading up on chess...

                                MILLIE
                I m a quick study...

  Just then, two suited men, GRAVES and CORDERO, appear.

                                GRAVES

                              CORDERO
                      (glances to Millie)
                If you don t mind, we need to speak 
                to Professor Eppes alone.

  Charlie shrugs, apologetically.  Millie waves him off.

                                MILLIE
                It s alright, Charlie.
                      (re: the books)
                I ll read them both.

  She goes.  Cordero shuts the door after her.

                              CHARLIE
                So what s this about?

  Graves and Cordero reveal their ID s.

                                GRAVES
                We re with the National Security

                We know what you re involved with, 
                  Professor.  And we know you have an

                Alright if we take a walk?


  TIGHT ON the mug shots of Chris and Robert Morris.  REVEAL 
  Liz studying them.  She turns to Megan.

                              LIZ
                If the Morris barge was never near 
                where the yacht went down, they 
                weren t after the yacht.

                              MEGAN
                Maybe they re involved in one of 
                the drug operations you were 
                talking about...?

                              LIZ
                Drug runners usually stay further 
                out, in International waters.  But 
                I don t think we can rule it out.

  Colby ENTERS, interrupting.

                              COLBY
                Just talked to the E.R.T. lab.  The 
                other two blood traces we found on 
                the barge...  they definitely 
                belong to Chris and Robert Morris.

                How big a leap would it be to 
                assume they re dead, same as their 
                diver?

                              COLBY
                Would explain why we can t find 
                them.  And if the killer dumped 
                their bodies at sea, they could ve 
                drifted anywhere by now...

                              MEGAN
                Wait a minute, maybe not.  Hand me 
                the Coroner s report on the diver.

  Colby grabs the FILE, hands it to Megan.  She flips pages, 
  pulls out an AUTOPSY PHOTO of the dead diver s legs... 

                              MEGAN
                Can we put this one up?

  Colby uses his lap top computer, puts the PHOTO up on the big

                              MEGAN
                The impressions on his ankles.  
                Report says they re consistent with 
                having been caused by a rope. 

                              COLBY
                Not from the fishing net?

                More like something was tied around 
                his ankles.  A weight probably.

                              MEGAN
                Whoever threw him in the ocean 
                probably anchored him down.  Only 
                in his case, the rope came loose 
                somehow.  He drifted free, ended up 
                in the fishing net.

                              LIZ
                If that s true, then the other two, 
                Chris and Robert Morris... they 
                could still be anchored to the 
                bottom right where they were 
                dropped.

  Cheetah designs, depth charts.  Charlie s at the boards,

                  Back-burner it?  Charlie, I thought

                              CHARLIE
                I m sorry.

                              DON
                You know what?  That doesn t do me 
                a whole lot of good.

  Alan enters, drawn by the noise.

                              ALAN
                Guys, c mon, what s going on?

                              DON
                I have no idea.  Ask Charlie.

  Don leaves.  Alan looks to Charlie for an explanation.  After 
  a beat, Charlie sets down his chalk.

                              CHARLIE
                I m in a no-win situation, that s 
                all.  Don needs me to do something, 
                and I can t right now.

                              ALAN
                Why not?

                              CHARLIE
                      (snapping a little)
                Because I m doing something else, 
                something I can t talk about!

                              ALAN
                Alright, Charlie, relax, I won t 
                ask...  You ve got obligations.  
                You have to choose what to work 
                on...

                      (over sensitive)
                What s that suppose to mean?

                              ALAN
                Doesn t mean anything other than 
                what it means...  You make the 
                choice of what needs to be done 
                when.  I trust that choice...

  Charlie isn t calmed.  In fact, just the opposite.

                              CHARLIE
                You know what?  Forget it, it s 
                moot now anyway.  I m just about 
                done with what I was doing.  I m 
                tired, I m hungry... but I ll stay 
                out here and do what Don wants me 
                to do...

  Alan watches Charlie confused...  then goes --


  With a few extra monitors, the Tech Room has been set up to 
  receive a live feed from the Search Boat.  Displays show 
  detailed sonar, underwater video, radar and depth images...

  Charlie sits at the desk, marking the ship s progress over 
  the search grid.  Colby and Liz look on --

                              CHARLIE
                GPS coordinates put them right on 
                the edge of Abalone Cove...

                around to the port side now, and 
                beginning another pass...

  Charlie leans forward to a microphone, slightly awkward --

                              CHARLIE
                      (into microphone)
                Uh, copy that.

                              LIZ
                Charlie, you said last night 
                there s an 83 percent chance the 
                Morris barge was actually working 
                within your search grid. 

                              CHARLIE
                Yeah, that s right.

                              LIZ
                So there s still a 17 percent 
                chance they weren t...

                              CHARLIE
                Wow, I didn t realize you were such 
                    a glass-half-empty type.  83 
                percent is actually a very high 
                  probability. 

  A FLASH of something passes across the video monitor, then 
  it s just more murky water and ocean bottom.

                              COLBY
                Whoa.  Go back.  What was that?

                              CHARLIE
                      (into microphone)
                Did you guys see that?

                                SHIP S TECH OFFICER
                      (over speaker)
                Yeah, Charlie.  Sonar mapping s 
                picking it up too.  Let me steer 
                the camera back around.

  They all watch the screen, P.O.V. of an underwater camera, as 
  the Tech steers the camera drone with a JOYSTICK.

                              COLBY
                It was back this way a little bit I 
                think.

                              CHARLIE
                He ll get it...

  Suddenly on the monitor, the unmistakable form of a human 
  body, anchored to the bottom by its ankles.

                              LIZ
                It s a body.

                      (playful)
                I never doubted you, Charlie.

                      (into microphone)
                Another body?

                      (over speaker)
                Negative.  This is much bigger.  
                Looks like a vessel.

                              CHARLIE
                      (into microphone)
                Can you get us video on it?

  Eyes go to the video monitor - as the camera moves along the 
  murky bottom... finally reaching the stern of a boat, canted, 
  resting on the bottom...   CHEETAH .

                              COLBY
                It s the Cheetah.

                              CHARLIE
                It can t be.  I ve done all the 
                  calculations.  It shouldn t be 
                anywhere near here.

                              LIZ
                It shouldn t be, Charlie.  But it 
                is.

  On Charlie... and the Cheetah s image on the monitor --

                We weren t even looking for the 
                Cheetah.  We were just tracking the 
                path of a salvage barge...

                              CORDERO
                And you just happen to find her. 
                What luck.

  Beat.  Stand-off.  Charlie looks to Don --

                              CHARLIE
                Can I go now?

                                GRAVES
                No.

                              DON
                Yes.

  Charlie goes.  A beat passes between Don and the NSA agents.

                              DON
                Look, we thought we were working 
                separate cases.  Obviously, we re 
                not.  So let s skip all the inter-
                agency crap, and figure out what 
                the hell s going on here, alright?
                      (then)
                What s NSA s interest?
                      (off their silence)
                Guys, c mon...

                                GRAVES
                      (finally, reluctant)
                NSA s been tracking an arms dealer 
                named Hashim Aziz.  He s Pakistani, 
                  terrorist ties, on every agency s 
                watch list...

                              DON
                And you think he s somehow 
                  connected to the racing yacht?

                                GRAVES
                Aziz recently transferred a large 
                sum of money to Reid Sarasin.

                              DON
                Sarasin.  That s Cheetah s  
                skipper.

                              CORDERO
                The reason for the payment is 
                unknown.  Best guess now is that 
                the yacht was smuggling something 
                for Aziz...

                              DON
                Which explains why someone would 
                pull it, then throw it back...

                                GRAVES
                They got what they wanted.  Only we 
                don t know what it was...

  Off Don --


  Megan, Liz and Colby.  Colby with the ocean chart showing the 
  Cheetah search area out in deep water.

                              COLBY
                All search efforts for the Cheetah 
                were focused way out here... and 
                really for only one reason.

                              MEGAN
                Because that s where the locator 
                beacon stopped transmitting.

                              COLBY
                The assumption was, it stopped 
                  transmitting because the yacht went 
                under water.

                              LIZ
                But there are other reasons the 
                beacon might ve quit, right?

                              MEGAN
                Like if someone turned it off.

                              LIZ
                But why do that?

                              COLBY
                Say you re the skipper, Sarasin.  
                You re the only one left on board, 
                you re taking on water, and you re 
                  smuggling something.

    CONTINUED:2323


                              MEGAN
                You re gonna try to get your boat 
                to shallow water.  That s the only 
                way you ll be able to recover 
                whatever you re smuggling.

                              COLBY
                But you don t want anyone else to 
                know where the yacht ends up.

                              LIZ
                I get it.  Once my crew s gone, I 
                turn off the homing beacon, and aim 
                my yacht for the closest 
                  shoreline...

                              COLBY
                Explains how the boat ended up so 
                close in.  And how the Morris guys 
                knew right where to look for it.  
                Sarasin told them.

                              MEGAN
                      (realizing)
                Which means he didn t drown at sea.  
                He s still alive!

  Off their reactions...


  Megan s at the fridge when Liz enters, pours herself a cup of 
  coffee.  Before she drinks it --

                              MEGAN
                I d be careful.  I think Colby made 
                the last pot...

                              LIZ
                      (sips it, winces)
                Wow.  Is that what passes for 
                coffee in the army?

  She dumps the pot, starts a new one as --

                              MEGAN
                Little weird?  Being back here?

                      (off Megan s nod, then)
                Why you asking?

                              MEGAN
                      (shrugs, honest)
                Because my basic nature is to be 
                nosy.  And Don sure the hell isn t 
                going to tell me anything...

                              LIZ
                You ve worked with him for a while.  
                Did you and he ever...?

                              MEGAN
                      (a laugh)
                No.  I don t think you ever met 
                Larry, but my tastes run a little 
                more... eccentric, maybe?
                      (beat, still wondering)
                So... is there something going on?

  Megan nods in agreement.  Off Liz -- *


  Don and Charlie exit the elevator.  Don heads straight for 
  Graves and Cordero.  Charlie veers off to grab a pad and 
  pencil, and starts calculating...

                              DON
                Whatever the Cheetah was smuggling, 
                she picked it up in Singapore.

                              CORDERO
                How do you know?

                              DON
                Charlie.  He says the boat slowed 
                down right after its stop there.

  Cordero and Graves share a look.

                              DON
                Does that mean something?

                              GRAVES
                It could.
                      (pulling Don aside)
                Cobalt-RE.  It s a missile guidance 
                system.  Four units disappeared 
                from a Pakistani army base twelve 
                weeks ago.  NSA was tracking them - 
                lost them crossing into Thailand.  
                But if you continue on that 
                  trajectory...

                              DON
                You end up in Singapore.  Just what 
                Charlie said.

  Beat.

                              GRAVES
                The Cobalt system is relatively 
                compact, easy to program... but its 
                main advantage is that it s capable 
                of being mated with several 
                  Katyusha-style rockets...

                              CORDERO
                  Katyushas are common, but not 
                  considered a grave threat because 
                they fly a ballistic trajectory.  
                You aim and fire, they go where 
                they go...

                              DON
                But not if they re fitted with one 
                of these guidance systems...

  Charlie comes over, carrying his pad.

                              DON
                The four missing units... What 
                would they weigh?

                              GRAVES
                4 units, 85 pounds each, plus the 
                crates...  Little over 400 pounds.

                              CHARLIE
                      (off his pad)
                418 pounds is what I got.

                              CORDERO
                Then they re here.  They re in the 
                U.S.

                              DON
                And whoever has them has already 
                got a two day head start on us...

  REVEAL Liz watching the screen.  She turns to Colby, Megan 
  and Don --

                              LIZ
                What exactly are we up against?

                              COLBY
                We know the guidance systems were 
                pulled from the Cheetah just about 
                38 hours ago.

                              MEGAN
                Question is, where are they now?

                              DON
                Question is, where are they headed?  
                And does that party have the 
                rockets to marry them to?

  Colby puts a picture of skipper, REID SARASIN, on the screen.

                              COLBY
                Right now our best lead s the 
                  Cheetah s skipper, Reid Sarasin.

                              DON
                What do we know about him?

                              MEGAN
                He s a top-notch sailor, but like 
                most of the skippers in the race, 
                he s just a gun-for-hire.  I doubt 
                his loyalties to the owner go much 
                beyond whatever he has to do to get 
                  a paycheck.

                              LIZ
                So, how do we find him?

                              MEGAN
                His wife s here in L.A...

                Then let s get her in here.  NUMB3RS 313/50 "Finders Keepers" GREEN Rev  11/30/06    45.




  JANETTE SARASIN sits at the table.  Early-40s, face weathered 
  from wind and sea, but, no doubt, she was a beauty once.  
  Megan sits opposite her, close, while Colby paces.

                              MEGAN
                You don t strike me as a woman in 
                  mourning, Mrs. Sarasin.

                              JANETTE
                That s because I haven t given up 
                hope my husband will be found.

                              COLBY
                Sure.  That or he s already 
                  contacted you, told you he s alive.

                              JANETTE
                That s ridiculous.  There s still a 
                search on looking for him...

  Beat.  Megan eyes Janette a moment, smiles.

                              MEGAN
                Married to a man who races yachts 
                around the world.  Must be pretty 
                  exciting.

                              JANETTE
                I really don t do much traveling 
                  anymore...

                              MEGAN
                I didn t mean exciting for you.  I 
                meant exciting for him...  Can t 
                imagine he s around much, though.  
                And you have three children?

                              JANETTE
                What do my kids have to do with this?

                              MEGAN
                Just helps me to fill in the 
                picture, that s all.  And what I 
                see is you, at home, raising kids 
                alone, while Reid sails around the 
                world, partying it up like he s 
                still 25 years-old...
                      (eyes Janette hard)
                Haven t you made enough sacrifices 
                for this guy already?



                                                                          (CONTINUED)  NUMB3RS 313/50 "Finders Keepers" GREEN Rev  11/30/06    46.

  Another beat.  Janette s trying hard to look tough.

                              COLBY
                The nature of what your husband was 
                smuggling, Mrs. Sarasin, means we 
                can classify him as a terrorist.  
                You re helping him, so in effect, 
                you become a terrorist as well.  
                You can be held indefinitely...

                              MEGAN
                Means you d be sacrificing your 
                kids too.  You really ready to do 
                that for him?

  Megan lets that hang.  Janette s wavering --

                              MEGAN
                Would he ever do that for you?


  Guns up, the three Agents enter the cramped cabin.  Spaces 
  are narrow, tight.  Lots of hiding places.  Dim light adds to 
  the sense of danger...



                                                                          (CONTINUED)  NUMB3RS 313/50 "Finders Keepers" GREEN Rev  11/30/06    47.

    CONTINUED:3131


  Room to room, Colby, Liz and Cordero search the cabin.  Under 
  bunks, in the head, storage cabinets...  Finally --

                              LIZ
                He s not here.

  Cordero points to some food wrappers, dirty dishes --

                              CORDERO
                Looks like he was.  Could his wife 
                have tipped him off?

                              COLBY
                No.  But maybe she knew he was 
                already gone.


  Don and Graves in with Reid Sarasin.  Sarasin has dry 
  clothes, but his hair is still wet, tousled as --

                              SARASIN
                You think I chose to put those 
                crates on my boat?  My life was 
                  threatened.  I was forced to.

                              DON
                And were you forced to cash that 
                big check they wrote you too?

  Beat.  Sarasin shakes his head, burdened --

                              SARASIN
                The whole thing unraveled when the 
                damn boat started leaking.  It was 
                supposed to be easy.  Sail in, 
                unload the crates, sail out on the 
                next leg of the race...

                                GRAVES
                Who d you give the guidance systems 
                to?  Who d you meet with on this 
                end?

                              SARASIN
                Two guys.  I don t know their 
                names.  I just had a phone number.

                C mon, you can do better than that.  
                Unless you want to take a triple-
                murder rap alone.

                              SARASIN
                Wait.  I didn t have anything to do 
                with that!  I just sail boats, 
                that s all.  I didn t kill anybody.

  The bullpen is active.  The stakes are high, everyone amped

                Hashim Aziz is an arms dealer at

                Which means it could be anyone...

  Graves paces on the phone in the b.g. as Don appears.

  The Agents storm in, looking for immediate cover.

  Colby and Graves go right, paired up.  Suspect #1 fires.  The

  from...  Colby makes a lateral move to the right for

  Suspect #1 back.  As Colby makes another move to the right --

  Don makes a move, goes.  Liz follows.  Suspect #1 sees them, 
  raises his gun, taking aim...  Colby rises behind him.

  Suspect #1 doesn t.  Colby FIRES, sending Suspect #1 tumbling 
  down the stairs...


  Behind the wheel, Suspect #2 races toward the open roll-up 
  door, making his escape.

  Don appears in his path.  Suspect #2 s only escape route is 
  right at Don... and he s not slowing...

  Don levels his gun, BLAM BLAM!, fires TWO SHOTS through the 
  windshield, right next to Suspect #2... then swings his gun 
  straight on.  The next pull is the kill shot...

  Suspect #2 slams on the brakes.  Don s lit up by the 
  headlights in the swirl of dust as the car comes to a stop.

  But Suspect #2 s not giving up.  He opens the door to bail 
  out on foot.  But as the door opens...

  Liz appears and kicks it shut hard, pinching Suspect #2 
  between the car and the door.  As the door bounces open 
  again, she levels her gun...

                Get on the ground!  Down!

  Don s there as Suspect #2 complies.  He moves in, twists back
