possessor of The Right Stuff, his beautiful roommate
LESLIE HUNTER, KEVIN DOLENZ, self-styled, chain-
smoking, sardonic, and KIRBO KREAGER, short, hyper,
dressed like a waiter -- dash worriedly into the busy
emergency room. They are all twenty-two, or barely
twenty-two. Only four months out of college, they are
in their freshman year of life.
Alec, Leslie, Kevin and Kirbo dash past a cubicle, where
a totally naked, three-hundred-pound man paces in a daze.
Past this, they find a black nurse talking with two COPS.
ALEC
Wendy Beamish and Billy Hicks?
They were in a car accident?
ELECTRIC DOORS
zip open again, introducing JULIANNA VAN PATTER (JULES),
another freshman in life, but her sleek style gives her
a certain sexual sophistication. She is accompanied by
her dark, interesting DATE as she joins her friends and
the Cops.
JULES
They're dead, aren't they?
Everyone ignores her as Alec hands his card to the Cops.
ALEC
Officers, I'm Alec Newberry with
Congressman Langston's office.
Leslie whispers to Jules, while Alec and the Cops talk.
LESLIE
I think they're okay.
JULES
Thank God.

WENDY BEAMISH, a sweet-faced, insecure preppy, emerges

HER FRIENDS
Wendy. Oh, my God. Are you
all right???
WENDY
I'm fine. It's the car my father
gave me for graduation that's
totalled.
ALEC
(TO KEVIN)
Find Billy. See if you can sober
him up.
Kevin always does what Alec tells him to. Meanwhile,
Wendy pulls out her Visa card and speaks to the nurse.
WENDY
How much do I owe you?
JULES
He almost killed you. Destroyed
your car, and you're paying...?
LESLIE
Jules, please.
As Leslie comforts her, Wendy is looking over Jules' Date
who hovers in the distance.
WENDY
Is that your date?
The naked man wanders past them.
JULES
No, that's my date!
As usual, Jules has managed to make Wendy laugh, Just as
the Cops approach her.

Jules joins Leslie and Wendy.

He enters and begins to pick up speed as he quickly
catches up to a beautiful INTERN in a white lab coat.
KIRBO
Dale?... Dale Biberman?
She hesitates, somewhat puzzled.
KIRBO
You don't remember me.
DALE

KIRBO
Kirby Kreager. You were a senior

DALE
Kirby... It's been four years.

KI RBO
I graduated!
DALE
I always knew you would.
KIRBO
And I'm a lawyer.
(as she looks at
his waiter's duds)
I mean I'm a waiter, studying to
be a lawyer... and you became a
doctor... Just like you said you
would.
DALE
Almost. I'm finishing my clinical.
KIRBO
Dale Biberman. I can't believe
it. Do you still like Woody Allen
movies?
There is a big COMMOTION at the other and of the hail.
DALE

She races down the hall, joining paramedics wheeling in
a large black man on a gurney. His hysterical wife runs
screaming behind them.

watches, as the rest of the hospital moves in real time,
but Dale, comforting the frightened child, moves in
ROMANTIC SLOW MOTION. SONG BEGINS.

Alec drives while Leslie tends to Wendy between them.
Billy, Kirbo and Kevin are in the back seat, with Jules
on their lap.
BILLY

Alec turns the corner as Billy continues.
BILLY
Thanks for bailing me out.
JULES
Again.
Young professionals, graduate students, and precocious
undergrads populate the P.J. Clarke-like bar/restaurant.
Kirbo quickly goes back to work waiting tables. Alec gets
rid of a group of rowdy undergrads sitting at two tables
pushed together. He admonishes WALLY, the burly owner.
ALEC
Wally! You let undergrad punks

WALLY
Relax, Alec... they've only been

ALEC
Yeah, well, we've been here for
four years.
Alec, Leslie, Jules, Wendy, Kevin and Billy (still with
sax around his neck) take their usual chairs as Kirbo
drops off a large pitcher of beer.
BILLY
Hey, I need a real drink.
Kirbo is long gone. Kevin pours.
KEVIN
Waiters are like cops. Never

Kevin and Alec begin bouncing quarters from the edge of a

KEVI N

Alec suddenly spots TOMMY BANCROFT, an older version of
Alec, across the room.
ALEC
Hey, Tommy...
(TO LESLIE)
Tommy Bancroft, Senator Hodges'
key guy. Come on, I want you to
meet him.
They leave the table as Jules turns to Kevin.
JULES
The meaning of life, Kevin, is
fun, good times and a little
H-U-M-O-R. Don't you enjoy
anything anymore? Like girls?
KEVI N
I enjoy being afraid of Russia.
It's a harmless fear. Makes
America feel better and Russia
gets an inflated sense of national
worth from our paranoia... Excuse

Billy adjusts a framed photo on the wall of him, Alec,
Jules, Wendy, Kevin, Leslie and Kirbo in their graduation
caps and gowns. He notices a woman's reflection in the
glass. He turns to see she is flirting with him from the
bar. He smiles back. Kevin arrives and Billy sees a
perfect way to get off the phone.
BILLY
Here's Kevin, he wants to say

He hands the phone to a more than reluctant Kevin and
moves toward the YOUNG WOMAN at the bar.
BILLY

He joins the Young Woman who is eyeing his sax.

Leslie watches as Jules applies eyeshadow to Wendy's

JULES
Unreachable somewhere in South
Africa with his new wife, who it
turns out is only three years older

Jules takes another belt of vodka.
Dirty laundry and Woody Allen posters. Kevin sits in the

wears camouflage shirts, a black beret and shades --
drinks brandy and writhes in orgiastic ecstasy as he
sings along with JANIS JOPLIN.

Kevin looks puzzled as Kirbo hangs up his bike.

poorly written, unmailed love

KIRBO

It's true love. I have her

KEVIN
Love is just an illusion created
by lawyer-types like yourself to
perpetuate another illusion called
marriage to create the reality of
divorce and the illusory need for
divorce lawyers. Did you know

JULES
Please... I'm with these Arabs...

I'm sure I heard the words for
'gang bang' and 'white slavery'...
Please get me out of here... Suite

Leslie watches anxiously as Alec throws on his clothes.

He kisses her.

Four additional sedate Arab businessmen sit calmly
watching MTV. Jules is pacing nervously by the bar,
smoking. She fakes surprise at Alec's entrance.
JULES
Alec, what are you doing here?
He quickly grabs her and they leave the suite. The Arabs
hardly notice.
ALEC
Okay, nobody make a move.
Jules and Alec walk from the elevators.
JULES
You're a real pal. My Indiana
Jones. I won't forget how you came
to my rescue again.
ALEC
They hardly impressed me as the
gang bang type, Jules. Now much
coke have you done?
JULES
Shovels full. They've got
barrels.
ALEC
You're just paranoid from the coke.
You know sometimes I think you just
make up these dramas to test me or
something.
JULES
That's very interesting, let's
stay up all night like the old

As Jules connects with her number, Alec starts to head
out of the hotel in disgust. A beautiful older woman is
getting her key from the desk and crosses in front of him
toward the elevators. She and Alec check each other out.
He smiles. She smiles. As her elevator, arrives, she
changes her mind and, giving Alec an inviting smile,
steps into the dimly-lit bar. Alec is torn between
morality and temptation. Temptation wins as he follows
the sexy lady.
Kirbo, dressed in his best, enters the elegant, but empty
dining room. Searching around quickly, he begins to try
out various tables. He exchanges floral arrangements at

Kevin and Kirbo fold their laundry.

of the mystical force which removes
one of my socks from the dryer every

Wendy waits in the hallway, listening to bedroom DOORS

tiptoes back into:

Wendy takes a big gulp. They are both awkward and ap-

knocks it over.

'cause I don't have any money!
Thank you for being so honest.
He gets up and leaves.
DALE
Kirby?
Kim Sung Ho paces the elegant room.
KIM SUNG HO
I work out of my house. You must
be available twenty-four hours a
day. Complete discretion and
loyalty. Five hundred dollars a
week.
We now see he is talking to Kirbo.
KIRBO
I'm your man, Mr. Ho.
KIM SUNG HO
Your scholastic record is very
impressive, why would you be
willing to leave law school for
essentially a gofer's position?
KIRBO
I don't feel it has any relevancy
in the world I want to go into.
KIM SUNG HO
Which world is that?
KIRBO
The 'real' world. Besides, did
you know that there are more
students in law school than there
are practicing lawyers?
Kirbo proudly drops his laundry off.
KIRBO
Fluff and Fold!!!

Leslie hangs out the window calling to someone below.
LESLIE
We'll be right down.
Alec comes from the bedroom getting dressed.
ALEC
June first!'
LESLIE
Honey, I just got promoted. I'm
going to have a lot more
responsibility. I'm sure it's
the right time.
ALEC
Looking at my big picture agenda,
I want to be playing softball
with my firstborn in about four
years.
LESLIE
Do you realize that over half the
marriages today end in divorce.
ALEC
And the other half don't.
LESLIE
My six-year-old niece asked me
today why everyone's father
doesn't live in a separate house
like her father does. I don't
want us to become another divorce
statistic in Newsweek.
ALEC
Look at my parents. My father may
not come home with a raging hard-
on, anymore, but they're happy.

Your father sits around playing

him constantly. But he's not
listening.
ALEC
That's probably why they're happy.
(he grabs her)
Leslie, let's stop living together
. get married and start really
living together!
LESLIE
Sweetheart, please. Let's not talk
about it tonight. This party means
a lot to Kirbo. The floor's filthy
again.
ALEC
Just pick a date, any date...
She opens the door as he grabs a nearby can of white
spray paint, and sprays the floor white again as they
back out through the door.
LESLIE
There are some things we have to
work out first.
Leslie locks the door as Alec sets the spray can down and
they disappear down the Victorian stairwell.
ALEC
Okay. Okay. Like my mom always
says, 'Don't get a hard-on'...
LESLIE
And like my mom always says...
'Marriage makes two people one.
But you never know which one.'
ALEC
Yeah, and like my pop says, 'The
way to woman's heart is,to saw
her in half.'

 Kirbo, in his underwear, is looking through his employer's
impressive closet. As he moves in front of a mirror, we
see Kevin watching him from the bedroom.
KEVIN
Does Alec know you're doing this?
KIRBO
I told him I had Kim's permission.
Should I go for the formal'tux, or
the velvet smoking jacket, I-do-
this -all -the -time look?
KEVIN
You've left school, put yourself
into debt, lied to Alec who got
you this job in the first place --
and all for a woman who doesn't
seem to be interested in you.
KIRBO
When she sees me in this setting
and realizes my potential, which
she has always secretly known
about me, the veil will be stripped
from her eyes and she will give
herself to me tonight.

Well, excuse me, buckeroo. But I

KI RBO
Perhaps, but a well-dressed fool.
SHOTS of party beginning: Alec, Leslie, Wendy and Howie
arrive. Other guests arrive, including some regulars
from St. Elmo's, undergrads and old schoolmates. Billy
enters and seeing some old frat brothers goes nuts.
Wendy watches him painfully.
KEVIN
holds court for the undergrads.
KEVIN
The best advice I can give you
undergrads is to fail. Failure is
a virtue in today's society. Human
error is a badge of honor. If
you're the alcoholic child of a
celebrity, you can blame them and
earn a year on the best-seller
list. If you're a celebrity, your
mistake will earn you a People
magazine cover. It's post-
Watergate morality. Take
responsibility for your mistakes
and make a quick buck while you're
at it.

I'm not getting you any more jobs,
Billy...
BILLY
You know, Al, you're so perfect.
Such a young god... I'll bet you
were sproutin' pubic hairs at the
age of three.
Jules redoes Wendy's makeup as Leslie watches.
WENDY
Jules, your hands are shaking.
JULES
Thin blood.
LESLIE
How's Forrester?
She drops the makeup.
JULES
Oh, shit.
Wendy and Leslie are worried.
LESLIE
How's your stepmother?
JULES
Hanging on. the old witch. At
least it gives me a chance to
funeral-shop. Did I tell you I
found this place in California
-- 'The Neptune Society.' They'll
wrap her up and throw her to the
sharks for five hundred dollars...
But I have to ship the body all

He hangs up and tries her home number. It's busy.
Kirbo is shouting at an operator on the phone.
KIRBO
Emergency break in!... Operator!
. That's right... What do you
mean she won't release the
phone??? Did you tell her I'm
giving a party for her???
Jules is doing coke with Kim's female chauffeur.
Alec, deep in his cups, clinks bottles loudly.
ALEC
Quiet. Big Al has an announcement.
Everyone more or less quiets down. Kevin TURNS DOWN
the STEREO, but not without SCRATCHING the record.
ALEC
On June first. Leslie will do me
the long-awaited honor of becoming
my bride. You're all invited.
Everyone rushes to Leslie, who is stunned.
LESLIE
Alec, you're drunk.
Alec is already accepting congratulations, and passing
out cigarettes like cigars, as Leslie grabs him.
LESLIE

WENDY
No.
KIRBO
Wendy, please, this is the most
important thing in my life...
WENDY
It's brand new.
KIRBO

 Alec and Leslie talk as the servants pretend not to
eavesdrop.
LESLIE
You just want a yearly Christmas
card with the Newberrys in front
of the fireplace..
ALEC
You're just afraid to commit.
LESLIE
You don't have to slow down your
career to help raise them.
ALEC
Jesus Christ, will you just for

Nothing.
ALEC A
What?
He dashes back into the
where people are dancing and cavorting. Quickly finding
Kevin, Alec punches him with all his might. Kevin goes
flying. People shout as Kevin lands against the stereo,
taking several thousands of dollars' worth of porcelain,
jade and flowers with him. Leslie runs to Kevin's aid.
ALEC
What'd you tell her?... Little
buddy... little traitor. Huh,
what'd you tell her?
LESLIE
He told me nothing. It was just
a hunch... until now.
Alec filled with guilt and remorse becomes angrier. Alec
realizes that everybody in the house is watching him. He
must save face.
ALEC

apartment tonight.
Alec marches out the door. The place is a wreck.

I haven't been here for a long

KEVIN
It's still the same. Small and

shouldn't find you some nice
lady-like hotel?
LESLIE
No, I'll be fine here for tonight
0 as long as I'm not putting
you or Kirbo to any trouble...
(NOTICES SOMETHING)
. What are you doing.with a
coffin?
We now see that a long coffee table which has always been
covered with junk is indeed a black coffin.
KEVIN
That's not how you're supposed
to ask. You're supposed to be a
young lady who is very impressed
with. my mind. Having come from a
deep Hungarian film and getting
cozy over a brandy, she says...
'Is that... a coffin...?' And,
then I say, 'Yes, it's my coffin'
. 'Your coffin,' she would gasp,
her interest in me growing by leaps
and bounds. Then'I would sit back
stroking her arm and say 'Yes, I
figured we're going to spend a long
time in the ground together so I've
made friends with it... I've gotten
drunk on it... rolled joints on it
. Even made love on it many times!'
It's a prop for affect.
LESLIE
Does it work?
KEVIN
How would I know?
LESLIE
Well you better not let Jules see
it. She'll steal it for her
stepmother. Are these relatives
of yours?

She holds up a beautiful photograph of a very beautiful
E
distinguished family.
KEVIN
No, that's more effect.
He opens a straw box, obviously filled with his most
personal possessions and extricates a photograph of a
very ordinary family.
KEVIN
You remember my family.
LESLIE
So I've wandered into a real
woman trap here, haven't I?
KEVIN
Except you're the first woman
I've ever been able to get up
here. And I've blown all my
props already... So how about
some brandy?
Kevin searches for clean glasses in the debris that
passes for a kitchen, Leslie finds photos and political
cartoons in his straw box. Eventually, she finds a
photo of herself, and then another -- followed by dozens
more. Kevin has an entire homage to her in his secret
stash. He comes back with the brandy to find her looking
at the photos.
LESLIE
Am I part of your props?
KEVIN
(PAINFULLY; SWEETLY)
No... you're the real thing.
He quickly starts pouring the brandy as Leslie looks at
Kevin, almost for the first time.
Kirbo drives frantically. As snowflakes begin to hit
the windshield, he grabs for the windshield wiper. Not
knowing how it works, he forces it the wrong way. The
handle comes off in his hand.

Alec was the first. There were
other guys, in high school, boys
-- but he was the first love of my
life. I always wondered if Alec
and I hadn't ended up in the same
dorm -- well, I guess I would have
just found someone else. And so
would he.
KEVIN
Alec had the luck of geography.
Whatever we say about Alec we'll
regret tomorrow.
LESLIE
What do you think about our
relationship. as an outsider?
KEVIN
Oooo -- dangerous question.

Sometimes I think I just hang
around with you and Alec 'cause.

They kiss madly, passionately. They fall to the floor
in a frenzy. Leslie pulls Kevin's hair.
KEVIN
Aaaaah. Ouch...
(as she stops)
No. I love it. I love it!!!
Leslie grabs onto the large throw rug as they roll around
the floor. Somehow as they roll and turn, the rug gets
wrapped around them. Leslie tears at his shirt, as he
yanks her sweater off. Kevin fights madly with the back
of Leslie's bra. He is going berserk trying to find the
clasp.
LESLIE
No... it's in front.
With a flick of her hand she undoes her bra and opens up
the wonders of paradise to her old buddy. They kiss
madly again as they roll in the rug.

Leslie and Kevin fuck on the floor, on the coffin, in
the shower. All over the apartment.
Jules, in a fur coat, is driving Billy home. They both
are moving kind of slow, having had too much of
everything.
JULES
Which one is yours? I always
forget.
BILLY
So do I. You wanna go someplace?
He points to a house. Jules stops the Jeep.
JULES
Do I. I've had a shit day.

BILLY
Yeah, well, I bet you really won't
have so much to say with me in
your mouth.
He kisses her wildly as she pushes him away aggressively.
JULES
I'm serious, Billy. No!!!
He grabs the keys from the ignition as the CAR DIES.
JULES

Holding her off with one hand, he shoves the keys into
his underwear and then sits back grinning.
BILLY
Come and get 'em.
JULES
You shit!!!
She attacks him, biting his hands, his neck and his
chest. Billy shrieks with laughter and pain.
Kirbo sits in front of the fire wrapped in a blanket.
Guy goes back into the bedroom as Dale finishes making
a bed for him on the sofa.
DALE
Your clothes should be dry in a
few hours.
KIRBO
He's a doctor, isn't he?
DALE
Here are some pajamas.
KIRBO
You expect me to wear his pajamas?
DALE
We'll talk in the morning.
She joins Guy, in the bedroom and closes the door. Kirbo
is left with the pajamas and his desperate anguish.

The room is destroyed as Leslie and Kevin lie on the
floor blissfully in each other's arms. They hear the
front DOOR OPEN.

No, it's Alec.
Kevin and Leslie look at each other frantically.
KEVIN

I gave him a key.
Alec, miserable, hungover, having walked all night in the
cold, shuffles around the living room.
ALEC
I'm only gonna ask you this once.
Did you tell Leslie about my
screwing around?
Kevin looks to Leslie as they wonder how to handle this.
KEVIN
No.
Alec has found a beer.
ALEC
I believe you. I want you to
know that I believe you and, Kev,
I'm sorry I hit you. Shit, how'd
she find out? How long has she
known? I've been thinking all
night about school... How sex

Alec capitulates and leaves the apartment. Kevin relaxes

The bedroom door opens and Leslie appears wrapped in a
sheet.

No. No. No... wait a minute...

you, I will use every bone in my
body, every lamp in this room to
make sure I inflict as much damage
as possible on you before you
bring me down.
Kevin prepares for the fight.
ALEC
You're both pathetic. I don't
want to see either one of you
again, ever. You understand me?
You see me on the street, you see
me at St. Elmo's, just pretend you
don't know me.
On his exit, Alec takes a lamp and throws it against a
Woody Allen photograph on the wall. Kevin and Leslie
look at each other, uncertain of what they have done.

Mr. Ho enters to find a big mess from the party and Wendy
and Howie asleep in the living room.

Dale sits down next to him.

Wendy keeps running, but then looks back. The Street
Toughs are giving her father a hard time as he puffs,
wheezes and deals with the pain in his chest and his
leg. Wendy can't stand it. She shouts at them.
WEND Y
That's my father. You leave him
alone... that's my father!
She runs over to them and shoos the Toughs away. Still
crying, she guides her father toward a stoop.
WENDY
Sit down, Daddy... sit down.
They sit down, both still very emotional. After a
moment, Mr. Beamish takes a torn greeting card from
his pocket. It has a very sexy woman on it.
MR. BEAMISH
See this... A feminist came into
the Pennsylvania Avenue store this
morning -- called me a 'sexist'

He kisses her warmly.
LESLIE
Kevin.
He aggressively gets on top of her, and feeling the
excitement and the champagne kisses her madly. The
front door opens and Jules appears breathless.
JULES
Don't you two ever use a bed?
Leaving the door wide open, she races through the apart-
ment. Kevin continues to madly attack Leslie when Ron,
carrying packages, arrives at his door across the hall.
He and Kevin exchange a look as-Ron goes inside.
LESLIE
Let me show Jules your piece.

She grabs a paper and starts for the hall. She stops
for a moment as she sees Jules, using her long pinky
nail, deftly take a couple of pops of coke. Unaware
that Leslie is watching, Jules starts back down the hall.
LESLIE
Kevin has his first byline.
Jules is so stoked she can't focus.
JULES
Wonderful. Brilliant... Ha ha...
'Tract Housing in Maryland'...
LESLIE
No, it's the other piece... Jules...
JULES
Got to fly. Forrester, the
magnificent animal, is waiting.
Did the hospital call? Is my
stepmonster dead yet?
LESLIE
Jules, I'd like to meet him.
JULES
I'll have him wave up to you.
She is out the door in a flash as Leslie moves toward
- the window.
LESLIE
Doesn't she seem out of control
to you?
KEVIN
Since the day I met her.
They look out of the window.
Kevin and Kirbo are watching the and of ANNIE HALL.
On screen, Woody says goodbye to Diane Keaton.
WOODY CV.O.)
I realized what a terrific person
she was and how much fun it was
knowing her and I thought of that
old joke, you know, this guy goes
to a psychiatrist and says, 'Doc,
uh, my brother's crazy. He thinks
he's a chicken,' and the doctor
says, 'Well, why don't you turn
14 him in?' And the guy says, 'I
would, but I need the eggs.' Well,
I guess that's pretty much how I
feel about relationships.

You know they're totally irrational
and crazy and absurd and... but .1
guess we keep going through it
because, uh, most of us need the
eggs.
Alec is playing his old quarter game, but with Tommy
Bancroft and his new political friends.
A well-dressed female executive secretary looks disturbed
as she enters a formidable office. She returns with a
distinguished GENTLEMAN in a grey suit. He approaches
Leslie who is waiting anxiously.
GENTLEMAN
Yes, may I help you?
LESLIE
I want to see Forrester Davidson
Jr.
GENTLEMAN
I am Forrester Davidson Jr.
Leslie is shocked and even more confused.
LESLIE
Well, there must be some mistake.
I've come to see Julianna van
Patten and they told me she
doesn't work here anymore.
104.
Busy. Active. Alec is on a phone and talking to co-
workers at the same time. He looks up to see Leslie,
very shaken, waiting across the room. He is immediately
angered, but eventually gets off the phone and joins
her.
ALEC
Did you forget one of your albums?
LESLIE
I'm sorry to bother you here.
It's Jules. After she left for
work this morning, the finance
company came and took away all
her furniture, her Jeep, everything
they could get their hands on...
I couldn't reach her so I finally
went over to her office. Alec --
she was fired three weeks ago!
All this time, she's been
pretending to go to work every day
, and pretending to be still
having this affair with her boss.
And she's been doing a lot of coke
.. Well, anyway, I confronted her
at the apartment, and at first she
denied everything, but then she
went crazy -- and now she's locked
herself in the apartment and she
won't let me back in... I'm really
worried about her.
Alec hesitates angrily.
LESLIE
Alec, please. I need your help.
LATER
Alec knocks on the door with Leslie.
ALEC
Jules, open the door.
Leslie puts her key in the door.
Dead locks and a heavy bolt prevent it from opening.
LESLIE (0.S.)
She's in there.
(CONTINUED)
159 CONTINUED:
ALEC (O.S.)
 Jules, come on. Just open the
door.
The main room is empty and dark, except for Jules, who
sits on the floor dressed only in a thin T-shirt and
bikini pants. Thin, tired, no makeup, this is a differ-
ent Jules than we have seen before. Freezing winds shoot
through the open window.
ALEC
Jules, remember my junior year
when I went cold turkey on
cigarettes? You sat up with me
all night in the commons room
feeding me emergency carrots...?
No answer.
LESLIE
Jules, if you don't let us in, we're
going to have to call the police.
There is a beat and then Jules speaks from the depths of
hell.
JULES (O.S.)
I'll throw myself out the window
before they get through the door.
LESLIE
Not my greatest ploy.
ALEC
Jules, remember the time I flunked
art history and I was trying to
drink myself to death...
Kevin and Kirbo come dashing up the stairs breathlessly.
KIRBO
How is she?
LESLIE
She just threatened to throw
herself out the window.
Kevin and Alec have a moment of awkwardness.
LESLIE
The fire escape!
106.
Through the iron bars they see Jules.
Leslie pounds on the door.
LESLIE
Jules, you're really scaring me
now.
Leslie runs screaming through the hall and down the
stairs, passing Ron Dellassandro who is just coming home
from work.
RON
What's happening???
108.
Looking back inside, he sees her still in the same posi-
tion, freezing.
The POUNDING jolts Jules.
Billy sits on the floor playing his sax soulfully.
WIDER ANGLE
REVEALS it's Wendy's apartment. It is partially painted
and a large ladder stands in the room. A small. wing
chair has fabric swatches on it. Cartons, books, etc.
Wendy sits on the floor watching Billy.
WEND Y
Then what happened?
BILLY
That was it... We came out of the
bedroom and had coffee with
everybody.
WEND Y
You saved her life.
BILLY
Let's not get dramatic.
WENDY
So, when did you get so sane?
BILLY
When I realized how insane I've
been all this time tryin' to be
like Alec and Leslie... and you
and Kevin... I'm not part of this
post-college Georgetown life;
marriage and jobs. Felicia and
Melody'll be better off without me.
WENDY
Did she get remarried already?
BILLY
Three or four weeks...

BILLY (CONT'D)
I was thinkin' of hanging around
tryin'to be one of those in-the-
neighborhood dads... but it would
just confuse everybody... especially
me. New York'll suit me fine. if
somebody'll let me play sax.
(INDICATING APARTMENT)
This is great.
WENDY
I'll tell you what's great. Last
night I woke up in the middle of
the night and made myself a peanut
butter and jelly sandwich... and
you know it was my kitchen, and
my refrigerator and My apartment
. and it was the best peanut
butter and jelly sandwich I've
ever had in my life.
They chuckle together and then they become more serious.
WENDY
So you're goin', huh...?
She picks up his sax and blows a few comic notes.
BILLY
So, are you still a virgin?
WENDY
Why is my sexual status so
important to you?
BILLY
Have I abused our relationship too
much? Or could I be so bold... as
to ask you for a going-away present...?
Wendy is moved.
CUT TO:
180 WENDY 18O
Lying on the floor of her bedroom. Only a candle lights
the room. Billy's face comes INTO FRAME and they kiss,
tenderly at first and then more passionately. Wendy
looks beautiful and she and Billy are filled with a
tenderness and love that can only exist from the years
they have shared together.
The SAX BUILDS as the wonder of the two young lovers
builds.
