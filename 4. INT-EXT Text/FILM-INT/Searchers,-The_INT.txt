The family is finishing dinner -- and the scene is not quite,
but almost, a still-life. Loud in the room is the pendulum
tick of a Seth-Thomas clock on the mantel above the fireplace --
in which logs are burning briskly. Ben crouches near the
fireplace, fascinatedly examining the scabbard and sabre
Ethan has brought home from the wars.
He tries to ease the blade just a bit out of its scabbard.
Aaron sits at one end of the hand-hewn table, Martha at the
other. At her right is Ethan, his fork scraping the last
crumb off his plate. Lucy sits at her father's right and
Martin at his left. Next to Martin is Debbie. In the center
of the table is the sorry remnant of what was once a meal.
Lucy and Martin have finished eating. Aaron is sipping his
coffee, and Martha -- her own plate largely untasted -- is
watching Ethan.
Ethan has shaved, changed his shirt. He straightens
contentedly and every eye is on him, expectantly.
ETHAN
Good.
The clock rattles alarmingly -- the usual preliminary to its
striking; and then it bangs out the strokes like a fire-alarm
gong. Eight fast clangs.
AARON
Ben! Deborah! Bed!
DEBBIE
But I've got to help with the dishes.
MARTHA
Not tonight... Ben, put that sword
back.
BEN
It's not a sword, ma... it's a saber!
(moving to Ethan)
Did you kill many damYankees with
this sabre, Uncle Ethan?
ETHAN
(matter-of-factly)
Some...
BEN
How many damYankees, Uncle Ethan?
MARTHA
Ben!... Martin, he'll sleep in the
bunkhouse with you tonight.
Martin nods and crosses to kiss Martha good night.
MARTIN
Good night, Aunt Martha... Uncle
Aaron...
(he hesitates)
Good night, Uncle Ethan.
Ethan doesn't like being called Uncle -- as we must know
from the quick look he shoots at Martin. But he acknowledges
it.
ETHAN
Night.
Ben reluctantly puts the scabbard away, turns to Ethan.
BEN
Will you tell me tomorrow about the
war?
AARON
The war ended three years ago, boy!
BEN
It did?... Then whyn't you come home
before now?
MARTHA
BEN!... Go 'long with Martin. MARCH!
As Ben reluctantly heads out with Martin, Deborah crosses to
Ethan's side and studies him gravely.
DEBBIE
Lucy's wearing the gold locket you
gave her when she was a little girl...
ETHAN
Oh?
DEBBIE
She don't wear it much account of it
makes her neck green.
LUCY
(aghast)
Deborah!
DEBBIE
(defensively)
Well, it does... But I wouldn't care
if you gave me a gold locket if it
made my neck green or not.
Ethan looks at her gravely.
ETHAN
'Fraid I...
(then he remembers
something, rises)
Wait.
He crosses to where his pack is -- a side table or something --
and burrows into it. Debbie is at his side.
ETHAN
How about this?
It is a gold medal or medallion -- something appropriate to
Maximilian of Mexico -- suspended by a long multi-colored
satin ribbon.
DEBBIE
Oh! LOOK! My gold locket!
She holds it high for mother -- and all -- to see. Martha
takes it and reacts at its weight.
MARTHA
It's solid gold... Ethan, I don't
think she's old enough...
ETHAN
Let her keep it... Just something I
picked up in Mexico.
Martha reluctantly surrenders it to Debbie's eager hand.
Aaron hasn't missed the word "Mexico" and looks sharply at
Ethan.
DEBBIE
Oh, thank you, Uncle Ethan...
LUCY
(to Debbie)
Come along...
The two girls leave the main room. Martha and Aaron both
look at Ethan -- half expecting some further explanation.
He turns from them and looks into the fire. Martha begins to
clear the table. Aaron gets up, takes a pipe and a spill --
lights it at the fire.
ETHAN
Passed the Todd place comin' in...
What happened to 'em?
AARON
They gave up... went back to the
cotton rows... So'd the Jamisons...
Without Martha, I don't know... She
wouldn't let a man quit.
Ethan turns and looks at her -- still busy with her dishes.
AARON
(change of tone)
Ethan, I could see it in you before
the war...
(Ethan looks at him)
You wanted to clear out!
Martha freezes in what she's doing -- listening.
AARON
And you stayed out beyond all need
to... WHY?
Ethan can't answer, but he takes it as a challenge and almost
welcomes it.
ETHAN
(hard)
You askin' me to clear out now?
AARON
(straightening --
with grave dignity)
You're my brother... You're welcome
to stay as long as you got a mind
to... Ain't that so, Martha?
MARTHA
(almost a whisper)
Of course he is.
ETHAN
I expect to pay my own way...
Martha resumes her activity. Ethan crosses to his pack,
reaches into it for a leather pouch, brings it back and tosses
it onto the table. It lands with a resonant clink.
Both Martha and Aaron draw close to the table.
(NOTE TO WINTON HOCH: This scene should be dramatically back-
lighted.)
ETHAN
There's sixty double eagles in
there... twelve-hundred dollars.
He opens a waistline shirt button and hauls out a leather
money belt and drops that on the table.
ETHAN
An' twice that in here.
He reaches into the belt and takes out a few mint-fresh gold
pieces which he slides across the table.
ETHAN
...only these got the late Emperor
Maximilian's picture on 'em.
Martha picks up one of the gold pieces, staring at the face
on the coin: the same as that on the medal -- staring sharply
then at Ethan. Aaron is examining another coin with a
different interest.
AARON
Mint fresh... not a mark on 'em.
He glances questioningly at Ethan.
ETHAN
So?
Aaron shrugs and crosses to a barrel chair. He raises the
seat and lifts out a pair of old boots, some rags of clothing
and then raises a false-bottom lid and drops pouch and money
belt into it. Carefully he replaces everything. During this
Ethan's attention has gone to Martha's hand, to one cut
finger, its wound barely healed. He takes the hand -- gently.
ETHAN
Cut yourself?
She nods and withdraws the hand.
ETHAN
(softly)
You were always hurting about your
hands.
She looks quickly at him and self-consciously tries to hide
her hands, conscious of their work-worn appearance.
Then for a moment their eyes meet and hold -- and a world of
sadness and hopelessness is in the look.
Aaron closes the seat of the barrel chair.
AARON
Time for bed...
He picks up one of the lamps and starts away toward their
bedroom door. Martha looks at Ethan again. His expression is
bitter.
AARON
Night, Ethan... Come 'long, Martha.
She turns obediently and follows Aaron. Ethan looks after
them and waits as Aaron opens the bedroom door. Martha goes
into it and Aaron follows and closes the door.
Ethan crosses to the lamp on the mantel, blows it out.
Only the firelight strikes his face as he stares broodingly
at the closed bedroom door.
DISSOLVE TO:
OMITTED
Debbie's dog is barking excitedly as six horsemen slowly
ride toward the house and dismount. A lamp goes on inside.
THE SIX HORSEMEN ARE:
CAPTAIN, THE REVEREND SAM CLAYTON, a big man with frosty
blue eyes, graying hair, a bristly full mustache and the air
of grave and resolute authority. He is a minister of the
Gospel with a .44 on his hip.
LARS JORGENSEN, the Edwards' neighbor, is a harried little
man, Scandinavian. As we shall find out soon, he has a brisk
and buxom wife and a rather astonishing brood of children.
BRAD JORGENSEN is one of these: sandy-haired, brash, amiable,
impulsive. He is in his early twenties.
CHARLIE MacCORRY, slightly older than Brad, is Sergeant of
Company A of the Rangers. (He is also Company A.) Charlie is
a taciturn, gently-spoken, competent man, clearly patterned
by his association with Captain, the Rev. Sam.
MOSE HARPER is an old scout -- a walking bone-rack, yet
capable of tireless feats of endurance. Some think him
"tetched" yet he has managed to endure to his age during a
time and in a region where few men lived to see their
grandchildren. He wears a ragged dark overcoat in all weather,
a narrow-brimmed hat with a feather in its band.
ED NESBY is a rancher and homesteader in his mid-thirties;
resolute, honest, self-effacing; nothing picturesque or
dramatic about him; just a solid citizen and a realist.
16-A
She is at the window of her bedroom, wrapper clutched with
one hand, lamp upraised in the other as she stares into the
dawn to see who these callers are. We hear the heavy foot-
falls of the approaching men, then a loud knock thrice
repeated -- an ominous sound.
OMITTED
17-A
SAM'S VOICE
Aaron! Open up!... Sam Clayton!
The door is opened by Aaron -- holding a lamp and a gun. He
is only partly dressed -- pants, boots, undershirt. The bar
of light slashes across the faces of Sam and some of the men
behind him.
AARON
Reverend... Come in!
CLAYTON
Sorry to get you out of bed so
early...
(as Martha enters,
tightening her wrapper)
Mornin', Sister Edwards.
MARTHA
What is it, Reverend?
CLAYTON
Lars Jorgensen claims someone bust
into his corral last night and run
off his best cows...
AARON
You mean those pure breds he just
bought?
Jorgensen enters -- an angry little man -- closely followed
by Mose Harper, who is grinning foolishly.
JORGENSEN
Next time I raise pigs, by golly!
You never hear of anyone running off
pigs, I bet you.
MOSE
Injuns has 'em... Caddoes or Kiowas...
Kiowas or Caddoes.
CLAYTON
(irritably)
Caddoes!
Mose spots Martha and at once whips off his hat and makes
her an exaggerated cavalier's bow.
MOSE
Respects to a charmin' lady, ma'am.
...Respects, respects...
Ed Nesby enters.
NESBY
Mornin'...
MARTHA
Coffee's made if you...
CLAYTON
Coffee'd be fine, sister...
She heads for the stove.
MOSE
(an old man's whimper)
My bones is cold...
His eyes brighten as he looks toward the fire and spots a
rocking chair. He shuffles toward it, plants himself and
begins rocking and half-crooning to himself.
JORGENSEN
Or bumble bees, by golly... I show
them dirty rustlers!
MOSE
(crooning)
Lookit me, old Mose Harper, rockin'
in a rockin' chair... I'm a-goin' to
set 'n rock, 'n rock, 'n rock, 'n
rock...
The front door opens to admit Martin, fully dressed and armed,
with Charlie MacCorry.
CLAYTON
Over here, Martin... Aaron...
Martin ranges himself next to Aaron and both face Clayton.
CLAYTON
Raise your right hands.
Martha sets out cups on the table, begins pouring the coffee.
During the swearing-in, Ethan will enter the room from the
inner door -- unnoticed by the other men, but not by Martha.
And as the scene plays, the audience must always be conscious
of the by-play of glances between Martha and Ethan as they
face the prospect of being left in this house together.
CLAYTON
You are hereby volunteer privates in
Company A of the Texas Rangers and
will faithfully discharge the duties
of same without recompense or monetary
compensation -- meaning no pay!...
Amen and get your shirt on, will
you, Aaron.
AARON
(stubbornly)
Ain't goin' volunteerin' after
rustlers without my morning coffee,
Reverend... Drink your own!
CLAYTON
(sternly -- as he
reaches for his cup)
From now on, call me 'Captain'!
But Ethan advances and calmly appropriates the cup Clayton
is reaching for...
ETHAN
(mockingly)
Captain the Reverend Samuel Johnson
Clayton!... Mighty impressive.
Clayton marks his surprise.
CLAYTON
(dourly)
Well... the prodigal brother...
When'd you get back?
Ethan sips his coffee and doesn't answer.
CLAYTON
Haven't seen you since the surrender.
(a pause)
Come to think of it, I didn't see
you at the surrender.
ETHAN
I don't believe in surrenderin'... I
still got my sabre, Reverend... never
turned it into any ploughshare
neither!
JORGENSEN
Is no time for kaffee-klatch while a
man's beef is been run off.
MOSE
Injuns, Ethan...
(taps his nose)
Caddoes or Kiowas... Mose Harper,
drinkin' coffee in a rockin' chair.
...ay-eh!
Martha has left the room briefly to fetch Aaron's shirt and
vest and stands behind him. Aaron drains his cup.
AARON
Ethan, countin' on you to look after
things while I'm gone.
Ethan -- cup to his lips -- looks over its rim at Martha as
Aaron starts to put on his shirt. Their eyes meet briefly,
then she looks away. Ethan sloshes the dregs of his cup into
the fire -- some of it spattering Mose.
ETHAN
You ain't goin'...
CLAYTON
He sure is goin'... He's sworn in.
ETHAN
(angrily)
Well, swear him out again!... I'll
go with you.
Martha stands submissively, with her head bent, eyes averted
as Ethan crosses the room to get his coat, guns, etc. Aaron
follows him.
AARON
Now, Ethan, I ain't sure...
ETHAN
Don't argue!... And stay close...
Maybe they're rustlers... and maybe
this dodderin' old idiot ain't so
far wrong...
MOSE
Thankin' ye, Ethan... thankin' ye.
Kind words...
CLAYTON
(grudgingly)
All right... I'll swear you in...
ETHAN
You can forget that...
(as Sam stares)
Wouldn't be legal anyway.
CLAYTON
Why?
(a pause -- then
shrewdly)
You wanted for a crime, Ethan?
Martha waits -- intent.
ETHAN
You askin' as a Reverend or a Captain,
Sam?
CLAYTON
I'm askin' as a Ranger of the
sovereign state of Texas.
ETHAN
Got a warrant?
CLAYTON
You fit a lot of descriptions.
ETHAN
(levelly)
I figger a man's only good for one
oath at a time... I took mine to the
Confederate States of America...
(he pauses -- then)
So did you, Reverend...
He looks past him then -- at Martha and then at Aaron.
ETHAN
Stick close, Aaron...
He looks at Martha again... and then strides out.
THE DOOR
Debbie sits on the floor, playing with a little rag doll.
The slanting blaze of the setting sun makes a brilliant area
of light in which she is sitting. Beyond her, on the porch
steps, Ben is squatting, whittling a piece of pine into a
slingshot frame. We hear Martha and Lucy busy with the dishes.
Aaron comes from behind CAMERA and stands in the doorway,
absently rapping out his pipe. Near the doorway, on a wooden
peg, hangs his gun, belt. He puts the pipe in his pocket and
glances down at Deborah, intent on her play. He looks swiftly
at where the women are busy - then stealthily eases the gun
from its holster and slides it under his shirt. He hasn't
made a sound and is sure he's got away with it.
He clears his throat noisily and reaches for a light shotgun
pegged above the door.
AARON
Think I'll see if I can pick off a
sage-hen or two, Martha...
busy at the wooden sink. Martha doesn't turn.
MARTHA
You do that, Aaron...
AARON
(still pleased with
himself)
Won't go far...
He steps out. Only then does Martha turn -- and her
EYES GO AT ONCE TO:
and FRAMING the empty holster, as Aaron pauses on the porch.
LUCY'S VOICE
My, the days are getting shorter!
as Lucy heads for the lamp.
MARTHA
(sharply)
Lucy!... We don't need the lamp yet...
Lucy frowns at her mother.
MARTHA
(easily)
Let's enjoy the dusk a while.
The room is deeply shadowed except where the dull crimson of
the sun through door and windows slashes the blackness.
Ben is waiting and Martha turns toward Aaron as he pulls the
door shut, bars it and sets the shotgun down. He takes the
revolver from his waist and Martha holds it as he reaches
for his gun belt.
AARON
Ben, close the shutters.
Buckling on his gun belt, he moves toward the middle of the
room, looking around him, taking inventory of his resources.
Lucy slowly approaches, biting a knuckle, eyes wide with
fright.
LUCY
Pa?
One shutter closes and the bar of light they were standing
in goes out. Martha, Aaron and Lucy are dark silhouettes now
against the red beam from another window.
MARTHA
(sudden fear)
Where's Deborah?...
(calling it)
DEBORAH!
Debbie emerges from a shadowed corner into a beam of light.
She is clutching her rag doll, nibbling a cookie. She holds
it for them to see.
DEBBIE
I only took one, ma... Topsy was
hungry.
Ben closes the shutter. And now the room is almost completely
blacked out, except for the dying light filtering through
the rifle ports of the closed shutters.
WIPE TO:
NIGHT
Aaron is little more than a shadowy silhouette as he peers
into the night through a partly-opened shutter. Suddenly the
room leaps alight as Lucy opens an inner door and enters,
holding a lighted lamp. Aaron closes the shutter, spins on
her angrily.
AARON
LUCY!
Martha crosses the room swiftly and blows out the lamp.
In the brief moment the room has been lighted, we see that
Lucy is carrying a dark shawl in one hand; that Ben is
crouched at another window -- rifle ready; and that Deborah
is on her feet -- standing like a child who is being dressed.
LUCY
I'm sorry... I couldn't find the
shawl...
AARON
Hurry, Martha... Moon's fixin' to
rise...
He cautiously swings the shutters open. A pale light filters
into the room. We see Martha wrapping the shawl around
Deborah.
MARTHA
(softly to the child)
We're going to play the sleep-out
game... Remember?... Where you hide
out with grandma?
DEBBIE
Where's she buried?
MARTHA
And you'll go along the ditch --
very quietly -- like a...
(her voice breaks)
DEBBIE
Like a little mouse.
AARON
Now!
He reaches for the child, but he has to wait for Martha's
last embrace.
MARTHA
There!... And you won't come back or
make a sound... no matter what you
hear? Promise!... No matter what?
DEBBIE
I promise... Wait!
AARON
Child, child!
DEBBIE
Can't I have Topsy to keep me company?
AARON
There's no time...
MARTHA
Here she is, baby... Baby...
Aaron takes the child, swings her out the window.
AARON
Down low -- go!
Martha would come to the window to look out, but Aaron bars
her with an arm and draws back to the side of the window to
watch her go... Outside the little dog barks a welcome and
presumably starts to follow the girl. Aaron reacts.
AARON
(hoarse whisper)
Here dog... here!
The dog whines but obeys. Aaron continues watching the child's
course -- unconsciously imitating her every run and twist...
Then he smiles and we may see the brightness in the corners
of his eyes.
AARON
She reached the ditch...
He closes the shutters and turns -- and his arms go around
Martha, weeping soundlessly.
AARON
She'll be all right, mother... she'll
be all right.
MARTIN - NIGHT
This is a room off the kitchen end of the keeping room --
and described in the book as the "grandmother room": with
narrow, slit-like windows, a set of single bunk beds, possibly
a fireplace.
Martin is in a deep wooden tub, taking a hot bath, currying
his back with a long-handled brush. Beyond him is the door.
It opens and Martin turns casually -- and at once stops being
casual as Laurie enters and purposefully crosses to a stool
or bench on which his discarded clothing is scattered.
MARTIN
Hey... What you doin'...?
She picks up the shirt, puts it over one arm; she reaches
for his long-handled and ragged underwear, runs a fist through
a hole in its seat, clucks and shreds it into rags. During
this:
MARTIN
(a yelp)
Don't go takin' that stuff...
LAURIE
Ain't worth the mendin'...
She turns and looks at him, matter of fact.
LAURIE
What you gettin' red-in-the-face
for?... I have brothers, haven't I?
MARTIN
Well I ain't one of 'em!
LAURIE
I'm a woman, Martie...
(he tries to say
something but she
goes right on)
We wash and mend your dirty clothes
all our lives... When you're little
we even wash you... How a man can
ever make out to get bashful in front
of a woman I'll never know...
MARTIN
You talk like a feller might just as
leave run around nekkid...
LAURIE
Wouldn't bother me...
(she heads for the
door)
I wouldn't try it in front of pa,
though, was I you...
And she is laughing as she closes the door behind her.
It is a plastered room, everything bright and shiny; a big
wood-burning cookstove, above it a row of shiny copper pots;
the furniture handmade and probably not too much unlike the
good plain Swedish modern of today.
There should be Scandinavian accents in the decor. All told,
a cheerful, warm-smelling room.
Ethan is talking as Laurie enters the room still carrying
Martin's shirt, the rags of his underwear. She will wait,
listening for a break in what Ethan is saying, to try to get
her mother's attention. Jorgensen is sitting in his usual
chair -- with his boots off, puffing his pipe more or less
in tune with what Ethan is talking about. Mrs. Jorgensen is
in her rocker, darning or knitting. Ethan is standing near
the mantel.
ETHAN
...an' then it snowed and we lost
the trail... No need to tell ya all
the places we went... Fort Richardson,
Fort Wingate an' Cobb... the Anadarko
Agency... Trouble is we don't even
know which band that war party
belonged to...
Mrs. Jorgensen looks up from her darning.
MRS. JORGENSEN
Well, you did all a body could, Ethan.
ETHAN
I got your boy killed.
MRS. JORGENSEN
(gently)
Don't go blamin' yourself...
JORGENSEN
(angrily)
It's this country killed my boy!...
Yes, by golly!
Mrs. Jorgensen stands.
MRS. JORGENSEN
Now Lars!... It so happens we be
Texicans... We took a reachin' hold,
way far out, past where any man has
right or reason to hold on... Or if
we didn't, our folks did... So we
can't leave off without makin' them
out to be fools, wastin' their lives
'n wasted in the way they died... A
Texican's nothin' but a human man
out on a limb... This year an' next
and maybe for a hundred more.
But I
don't think it'll be forever.
Someday
this country will be a fine good
place to be... Maybe it needs our
bones in the ground before that time
can come...
The speech impresses everyone but Laurie, who probably hasn't
heard a word of it.
LAURIE
Ma!... Martie's drawers is a sight!
Ain't fit for rags!... Would it be
all right if we gave him some of
Brad's things?
There is just the briefest hesitation...
MRS. JORGENSEN
Why...'course it would! They're in
the chest...
And she leads the way briskly, with Laurie following, to a
big chest at the far end of the room.
JORGENSEN
(rising excitedly)
By golly, the letter... In the chest,
mama... It came for you, Ethan...
last winter...
Ethan and Jorgensen cross together to where Mrs. Jorgensen
is raising the top of a huge dower chest. She extracts a
letter, wrapped in oilskin against moths.
JORGENSEN
(continuing)
Joab Wilkes of the Rangers brought
it...
Ethan takes the letter and studies it very carefully before
venturing to open it. Jorgensen is quite curious, but trying
not to seem nosy. The women remain at the chest -- pulling
out various folded garments, etc. Finally Ethan carefully
opens it and takes out a letter -- dirty as to paper, crudely
printed in pencil and with a horseshoe nail pinning a two-
inch square snip of calico to the bottom of the sheet. He
reads the letter with the habitual difficulty of a man unused
to words and then he turns the letter, removes the nail and
looks at the snip of cloth.
ETHAN
(quietly)
Mrs. Jorgensen...
She comes to him, her arms piled with clothing; and
Laurie a step behind her, holding up a new pair of long-
handled underwear -- measuring it with her eyes for holes,
etc.
ETHAN
Will you look at this?
He holds out the snip of calico.
MRS. JORGENSEN
Why it's just a snip of calico...
ETHAN
You ever see it before... like mebbe
on a dress Debbie wore?
MRS. JORGENSEN
Yes!... Yes, I remember!... Have
they found her, Ethan?
ETHAN
No... not yet...
He takes the calico snip, places it within the letter and
carefully pockets it. He looks broodingly into the fire.
ETHAN
(continuing)
...not yet...
Laurie's face is troubled as she turns from him and heads
for the grandmother room, carrying the armful of clothes.
Martin is sitting sulkily on a cot, wrapped in a blanket.
He glares up as Laurie enters. His feet are in his boots.
MARTIN
Might at least have left me my pants!
LAURIE
Shush!... Time for bed anyway...
(putting clothes near
him)
Likely these'll need some takin'
in... Oh, Martie, you're that gaunted!
...Ma's havin' a turkey for dinner
tomorrow and...
JORGENSEN'S VOICE
(calling)
Laurie!... Come... come!
Ethan opens the door, enters.
LAURIE
Yes, Pa!... Good night, Martie...
good night, Mr. Edwards...
She wants to kiss Martie but is shy in Ethan's presence and
hurries out.
MARTIN
Good night... Laurie...
ETHAN
Good night...
Martin stoops to remove his boots. Ethan studies him and
looks thoughtfully after the girl and at Martin.
He takes the letter out of his pocket -- as though he meant
to read it -- and then he puts it back decisively.
He starts to undress. Martin lies back on his bunk.
ETHAN
Jorgensen's been runnin' his cattle
with my own...
MARTIN
(staring)
YOUR cattle?... DEBBIE'S cattle!
Ethan returns the stare without any change of expression.
ETHAN
He's agreed to take you on and share
the increase from my herd while I'm
gone... I'll be pushin' on tomorrow...
MARTIN
I ain't stayin'... I set out lookin'
for Debbie... I aim to keep on...
ETHAN
Why?
MARTIN
Because she's my... my...
ETHAN
She's your nothin'... She's no kin
to you at all!
MARTIN
I always felt like she was... Her
folks takin' me in, raisin' me like
one of their own...
ETHAN
That don't make 'em kin...
MARTIN
All right... I ain't got no kin...
I'm goin' to keep lookin' that's
all.
ETHAN
How? You got any horses, or money to
buy 'em... You ain't even got money
to buy cartridges... Jorgensen's
offering you a good livin' here...
Martin throws himself back, turns his face to the wall.
Ethan looks soberly at him -- and is sorry for the brutality
of his words.
ETHAN
Martin... I want you to know
somethin'...
MARTIN
(turning -- mad as
hell)
Yeah... you want me to know I ain't
got no kin -- no money -- no horses --
nothing but a dead man's clothes to
wear!... You tole me that already...
Now shut your head!
ETHAN
Good night.
DISSOLVE TO:
DAWN LIGHT
She is in a robe made of an Indian blanket, belted snugly
around her waist. She wears moccasins for slippers. Her
flannel nightgown is high at the collar and almost trails
the floor. She is at the stove, frying bacon and eggs; a
coffee pot is on the boil. Beyond her the door to the
grandmother room opens and Martin comes in -- dressed in
Brad's clothes. His eyes whip around the room. Laurie doesn't
turn as he slowly approaches.
LAURIE
(quietly)
Ethan rode on... an hour ago.
The starch goes out of him. He walks heavily to the table
and sits, slumped. She looks at him compassionately.
LAURIE
I don't know what you can do about
finding Debbie that he can't...
He just shakes his head, not looking at her. She lifts the
food from the skillet onto a plate and sets it before him.
LAURIE
He'll find her now, Martie... Please
believe me... I know.
He shakes his head. She crosses to the stove for the coffee
pot.
MARTIN
That's what scares me -- him findin'
her.
Now it is her turn to stare.
MARTIN
Laurie, I've seen his eyes when he
so much as hears the word 'Comanche'
...I've seen him take his knife an'
...never mind... But he's a man can
go crazy wild... It might come on
him when it was the worst thing could
be... What I counted on, I hoped to
be there to stop him, if such thing
come.
Laurie has poured his coffee. Now he sips it. She sits at
the table with him.
LAURIE
(slowly)
I hoped I could hold you here... But
I guess I knew... So I stole this
for you...
She takes Ethan's letter from her breast and hands it to
him. He takes it, puzzled, and slowly reads it aloud.
MARTIN
'I bought a small size dress off a
Injun... If this here is a piece of
yr chiles dress bring reward. I know
where they gone... Jerem Futterman.'
Martin is on his feet.
MARTIN
(excited)
Futterman!... He's got a little
tradin' post on the South Fork o'
the Brazos... Laurie, I just got to
get me a good horse! Think yer pa
would...
LAURIE
Finish your breakfast...
MARTIN
I gotta catch up with him, Laurie!
LAURIE
(almost in tears --
but angry)
Go on then! Pa's in the barn saddlin'
the Fort Worth stud... an' you can
take the light gelding with the
blaze...
MARTIN
But that's Sweet-face -- your own
good horse.
Laurie goes to the front door and throws it wide.
LAURIE
(hysterically)
Take it and welcome... but don't
count on finding me here when you
get back... I've been dallying around
this god-forsaken wind-scour almost
two long years waitin' for you... I
ain't cut out to be an old maid!
MARTIN
(miserably)
I can't help it, Laurie... I just
gotta catch up with Ethan...
He runs out and she slams the door, then rests her head
against it.
113-A
Mrs. Jorgensen quietly enters the room and sees Laurie with
head pressed against the door. She wants to offer some word
of sympathy, but doesn't know what to say. She crosses to
the stove to pour herself a cup of coffee. Then we hear the
drum of horses' hooves, the sound of Martin riding away.
Laurie flings open the door, almost as though to call him
back.
113-B
It is a grimy establishment with some dusty trade goods on
shelves; a counter which serves as a bar; a few plank tables
and benches.
The breed seen outside enters and crosses to a side table
where another mean-looking hombre sits preparing to play a
game of solitaire with a deck of limp cards.
Ethan and Martin are at a table in the center of the room,
examining a dirty, rumpled child's dress -- Debbie's.
Martin nods soberly in answer to Ethan's inquiring look;
yes, it's hers. Both look up as FUTTERMAN crosses from the
bar, carrying a whisky jug and two dirty glasses -- his
fingers thrust inside the glasses. Futterman is a squaw man
and a killer -- dead eyes in a white face.
FUTTERMAN
Drink?
He sets the jug down, picks up one of the glasses -- so grey
and thumb-printed it is almost opaque. Both Ethan and Martin
regard it with disgust. Futterman gives a slight shrug, takes
the dress and starts to wipe the dirty glass with it. Martin
snatches it out of his hand.
ETHAN
(harshly)
How'd you come by this?
FUTTERMAN
You said there'd be a thousand dollar
reward.
ETHAN
That's what I said.
FUTTERMAN
You got it with you?
Ethan looks at him and beyond toward the two men.
The solitaire player has a card in mid-air -- frozen,
watching. The other man has the same buzzard-watchful look.
ETHAN
Reward'll be paid when I find her --
an' if she's alive...
Futterman uncorks the jug, prepares to drink.
FUTTERMAN
Man's got a right to expect some
kind o' payment... I laid out for
the dress an' sendin' you the
writin'...
He tilts the jug to his mouth as Ethan reaches for his heavy
leather pouch. Futterman watches greedily as Ethan lets a
gold piece slide out. He tosses it onto the table.
ETHAN
Twenty Yankee dollars.
Futterman puts the jug down. His hand inches -- as though
pulled by a magnet -- toward the gold piece.
FUTTERMAN
...an' a man's time is worth
somethin'...
Ethan's big hand clamps over Futterman's and he starts
squeezing as a man would squeeze a lemon. Futterman's lips
whiten.
ETHAN
Talk!
FUTTERMAN
A young buck fetched it in late last
summer...
(Ethan eases the grip)
Said it belonged to a captive chile
of Chief Scar...
ETHAN
Scar? Never heard of any Chief Scar.
FUTTERMAN
Me neither... But this buck claimed
he was a big war chief with the
Nawyecky Comanches.
ETHAN
Keep talking.
FUTTERMAN
Scar's band was headin' north... to
winter in at Fort Wingate... eatin'
agency beef. That's what this buck
said... Maybe he lied.
ETHAN
And maybe you lie...
FUTTERMAN
In that case you won't find her --
and I won't get my thousand dollars.
Ethan stands. Martin follows. Martin takes the dress and
folds it carefully.
FUTTERMAN
(too casually)
Stay the night if you want...
(Ethan shakes his
head)
Cards?... A jug?... If you'd like
some company, we got a few squaws on
the place...
Ethan and Martin head for the door.
ETHAN
No thanks.
The two plug-uglies stand -- mean ready to do their master's
bidding.
FUTTERMAN
Don't forget to come back with my
thousand dollars.
ETHAN
Ain't yours yet.
They leave. The CAMERA holds on Futterman as he slowly rubs
his bruised hand. His henchmen drift toward him.
FUTTERMAN
(slight smile)
Bad manners... He shoulda said 'good-
bye.'
DISSOLVE TO:
as Charlie enters, following Mrs. Jorgensen. Jorgensen
excitedly enters and closes the door. Laurie comes in from
another room. Charlie smiles and bows clumsily.
MRS. JORGENSEN
(to Laurie)
A letter for you, Laurie...
CHARLIE
Yes'm... Figgered it might be the
news you been waitin' for... so...
He hands the letter to Laurie who comes over eagerly, takes
it and studies the wrapper before opening it.
MRS. JORGENSEN
Real good o' you to ride all the way
over, Charlie... Might at least say
your thank you's, Laurie... Declare!
CHARLIE
No need to...
But Laurie has no interest in anything but the letter which
she is reading skimmingly.
MRS. JORGENSEN
Well?
JORGENSEN
(expectantly)
Yah?
MRS. JORGENSEN
Laurie! Don't keep a body just
standin'!
Laurie looks up then.
LAURIE
(impatiently)
I was just readin' to see if...
Anyway, it's MY letter!
MRS. JORGENSEN
(agreeably)
'Course it is. Now let's all get
comfortable an' set so's we can listen
while Laurie reads her letter...
CHARLIE
(turning as if to go)
Maybe I'd better be goin'...
JORGENSEN
You stay, Charlie... After all,
Charlie brought the letter, Laurie...
He got a right to listen too!
Mrs. Jorgensen has been pulling and pushing chairs around
and now they all take places. Jorgensen automatically reaches
for his glasses on the mantel and puts them on -- even though
he isn't going to read the letter. Laurie has been sneaking
looks at some of the other pages.
LAURIE
(surrendering)
Oh, all right!
Well... Martin says...
JORGENSEN
From the beginning...
LAURIE
'Dear Miss Laury'... He spells it
with a Y instead of an I... E...
Wouldn't you think he'd know...
JORGENSEN
Who cares what he spells it? Read
the letter.
LAURIE
Dear Miss Laury... I take pen in
hand to let you know Ethan and me
still are trying to catch up with
them Comanches the late Mister
Futterman told us about...
She breaks off, looks up -- puzzled.
LAURIE
The late Mister Futterman?
JORGENSEN
That means Mister Futterman is dead,
by golly.
MRS. JORGENSEN
Wonder what happened to the poor
man.
Go on, Laurie.
LAURIE
(resuming the letter)
We cut north through Indian territory
and...
(her voice fades)
DISSOLVE TO:
This trading post is in marked contrast to Futterman's --
being well-stocked, clean and presided over by HIRAM APPLEBY,
a resolute, clean-looking man of middle years.
Ethan and Martin -- in winter garb -- are being shown a
variety of trade goods, including a shoebox full of ornate
ribbon rosettes, such as are awarded animals at stock fairs.
Appleby is solemnly affirming the trade value of these, as
well as sleeve garters, etc.
MARTIN'S VOICE
At one o' the agencies we outfitted
with all kind an' manner of trade
goods... figgerin' that'd make it
easier for us to come an' go... You'd
laugh if I told you what was our
biggest seller...
WIPE TO:
DAY
As the Indian proudly steps back, we see beyond him a half
dozen other braves -- all rosetted. Ethan looks them over
complacently while Martin -- to hide the smile that threatens
to split his face -- bends to pick up a huge bundle of furs.
WIPE TO:
FAVORING LAURIE
reading the letter. She is at the bottom of a page.
LAURIE
'There is one other thing I got to
tell you before you hear it from
Ethan... How I got myself a wife'...
She stops and stares.
LAURIE
A WIFE?
She looks at them - dazed.
CHARLIE
(delightedly)
He did?
JORGENSEN
(smacking his knee --
very happy indeed)
Good! A young man should get married
early in life. Right, mama?
Mrs. Jorgensen, full of sympathy for Laurie, just glares at
her husband.
JORGENSEN
Every young man should at least
once...Go on, Laurie! Read!
LAURIE
(haltingly)
A little Comanche squaw - SQUAW!
And with that she crumples the letter and throws it into the
fire.
MRS. JORGENSEN
(aghast)
Laurie!
Jorgensen is out of his chair and scrambling in the fireplace
to recover the letter. He fetches it out, beating the sparks
out. The letter is basically undamaged.
JORGENSEN
(sternly)
Is no way to treat a letter, Laurie
...Mama maybe you better read it...
(to Charlie, proudly)
My wife was a school teacher, Charlie
...She reads good.
Laurie snatches the letter back.
LAURIE
I'll read it...
Charlie crosses the room, picks up a guitar.
CHARLIE
(smugly)
So he married a Comanche squaw...
Haw haw haw!
Laurie glares at him. He begins chording the guitar.
WIPE TO:
Mrs. Jorgensen is bringing a lighted lamp over to the table
where Laurie is reading against the fading light of day.
Jorgensen's pipe has gone out and he lights it.
LAURIE
Maybe she left other signs for us to
follow but we'll never know -- 'cause
it snowed all day and all the next
week... We were heading north, through
the buffalo country when something
happened that I ain't got straight
in my own mind yet...
(her voice fades)
137-A
as Ethan enters. A body -- Look's -- is sprawled on the
ground. He crosses, turns her over. Martin enters behind
him.
ETHAN
Well, you're a widower now...
MARTIN
(angrily)
What'd the soldiers have to kill her
for!...
He sees something clutched in her hand. He stoops quickly.
MARTIN
Ethan!
Ethan, who has turned indifferently to leave, pauses.
Martin shows him what Look had been clutching -- Debbie's
rag doll.
MARTIN
Look! It's hers, Debbie's...
Ethan snatches it, stares at it. Then he turns and runs from
the tepee. Martin stares at Look's body, then covers it with
a robe.
MARTIN'S VOICE
So we knew Debbie had been in the
village... What Look was doing there --
whether she'd come to warn them, or
maybe to find Debbie for me... there's
no way of knowing...
He turns and then slowly heads out.
The office has been set up as a temporary army headquarters.
The GENERAL is being interviewed by two Eastern newspaper
CORRESPONDENTS. At a table beyond is a telegrapher, sending
out a report of the victory.
A pot-bellied stove supplies heat and the General is warming
his hands at it, intermittently. An adjutant is rather wearily
filling out a long official form.
The General, for all his mudded boots remains a beau sabreur
and is loosely modeled upon a certain other well-known glory
hunter of the Indian wars. He wears a colonel's straps, but
insists upon his brevet rank.
GENERAL
And it was clear to me the hostiles
outnumbered us four to one... with
all the advantage of terrain...
CORRESPONDENT
Four to one! What did you do, general?
Ethan and Martin enter, stand in the doorway.
GENERAL
(impressively)
Sir -- we charged!... Gentlemen --
and I hope you will quote me -- I
cannot say too much for the courage
of the men who followed me into that
Cheyenne camp...
ETHAN
(blurting it)
Cheyenne! What Cheyenne?
GENERAL
(turning and staring)
I beg your pardon?
ETHAN
That camp you hit was Nawyecka
Comanche... Chief Scar's bunch...
CORRESPONDENT
(fascinated)
Scar? What a wonderful name!...
GENERAL
(to his aide)
Are you getting this, Keefer?
CORRESPONDENT
(to Ethan)
How do you spell that word --
Nawyecka?
Ethan ignores him, still facing the General.
ETHAN
My name's Edwards... I'm looking for
my niece... she was in that camp
when you attacked...
GENERAL
(uncertain)
Well... I know there were some
captives recovered...
MARTIN
(bitterly)
Four of 'em dead... so we were told...
GENERAL
(uncomfortably)
Unfortunately, the hostiles murdered
them as we developed the village...
ETHAN
Are you sure they didn't die of
carbine shots fired by a bunch o'
Yank bluebellies so scared they
couldn't tell the difference between
a Cheyenne and a Comanche?
GENERAL
Keefer!... Put this man under arrest!
ETHAN
That'll be the day...
(scornfully)
'As we developed the village'...
Next time you develop a village, hit
it where the fightin' men are...
You won't get any headlines for
killin' squaws.
Keefer coughs.
KEEFER
Shall I show him the captives, sir?
GENERAL
Just get him out of here!
KEEFER
Yes sir...
(he crosses to Ethan)
This way...
AFTERNOON
The door is opened by a guard and Ethan takes a step into
the room -- then stops in manifest shock. Martin
is at his heels, eager and expectant. Beyond them stands
Keefer, grave and compassionate. There is a keening sound in
the room -- almost an animal sound.
It is a simple log-sided room with plank benches without
backs. Up front is a small box-like pulpit, no altar.
Across the front of the room, set up either on benches or on
boards over saw-horses are four blanket-covered figures --
at least two being the bodies of children.
Squatting on the floor near them is an elderly white woman
with hair hanging loosely down her back and clad in Indian
robes. Standing, facing the newcomers, is a woman who may be
no more than in her mid-thirties.
She is mad -- wild-eyed, frightened, with matted, unbrushed
golden hair, torn garments. It is she who has been making
the keening sound, the animal moans. Now she crouches at the
sight of them and looks desperately for a means of escape.
Two girls are asleep, heads together and backs to the door.
One has light hair, like Debbie's; the other brown hair. The
afternoon sun coming through a high window touches the light
hair.
MARTIN
Debbie?... DEBBIE?
He has seen the light hair and starts crossing the room.
Now the madwoman begins her screaming, running from side to
side like a trapped animal. Ethan follows Martin into the
room, Keefer behind him. Martin comes to a stop, realizing
the woman is afraid of him. The two sleeping girls stir, but
do not turn.
MARTIN
Don't be scared, ma'am...
The madwoman crouches behind one of the benches, looking at
them with frightened eyes.
KEEFER
Just don't pay any attention to her...
Martin swallows and nods and crosses to the light-haired
girl. He reaches a hand gingerly to touch her shoulder.
MARTIN
(softly)
Debbie?
At the touch, the girl is on her feet, crouching -- one hand,
like a claw, drawn back to rake his face. She is unmistakably
a white girl, but she is painted like a Comanche woman --her
ears red inside, streaks of paint accenting the savagery of
her face. Her eyes are frightened, yet full of hate.
GIRL
Pabo-taibo!
(White man!)
The other girl has risen almost in
the same instant -- but more out of
fear. She is younger, but painted
like the other. She moves to stand
behind the savage one.
MARTIN
(slowly)
No... She's not...
ETHAN
I ain't sure... Where's that doll?
Martin stares at him, then realizes what he has in mind.
He fishes the rag doll from under his coat and holds it out
to the girl. She looks at it... and we may almost suspect it
is rekindling a memory -- but then she spits at it. The other
girl laughs. Martin turns away and he's sick.
KEEFER
Was your niece about their age?
ETHAN
Not far from it...
KEEFER
Hard to realize they're white, isn't
it...
ETHAN
(grimly)
They're not white any more -- they're
Comanche!... Let's see the bodies...
Martin nerves himself for the ordeal, turns to follow.
ETHAN
I don't need you...
Ethan and Keefer move away. As they do, the madwoman -- eyes
fixed on the rag doll in Martin's hand -- begins creeping up
behind him. Martin is torturedly watching Ethan and Keefer
as first one blanket then another is raised -- we will never
see the dead. During this:
KEEFER
(the dispassionate
pro)
I'd like you to see them all... It
might help us identify them... Shot
in the head -- flash-burn range...
The boy got his skull cracked...
Here's the girl...
Martin stiffens, waiting.
ETHAN
No...
Martin relaxes... and in that instant the madwoman has the
doll in her hands. She cradles it and she croons.
Martin reaches to take it away. But she calmly sits, cradling
the doll, and rocks to and fro, humming a lullaby. He can't
take it. Ethan returns.
ETHAN
Well, we only got the one lead --
Scar... And where we begin to look,
I don't know...
KEEFER
There's one thing. We recovered a
bushel of trinkets in that camp...
cheap stuff... trade goods... Couldn't
help noticing that most of it was
Mexican... Maybe if you could talk
to some of those Mexican traders
along the border... What do they
call themselves?
ETHAN
Comancheros...
KEEFER
That's the breed... Course it might
take time.
ETHAN
Time's running out... But I'm obliged
to you.
They leave.
CUT TO:
EVENING
Laurie has reached the last page of the letter, reading it
by the lamp on the table. Jorgensen is knocking out the dead
ashes of his pipe.
Charlie is in the shadows, a guitar in
his hands -- not playing it, but occasionally softly picking
a note or chord. Mrs. Jorgensen is dabbing moist eyes with a
corner of her apron.
LAURIE
...so we're setting out for New Mexico
Territory in the morning... I am
sorry I won't be back for Christmas
again this year...
She swallows hard, pauses a moment in her reading.
MRS. JORGENSEN
(quick sympathy)
And you knittin' that muffler...
LAURIE
(impatiently)
What's the difference!
MRS. JORGENSEN
Well, I just thought it would be a
sin and a shame not to let SOMEONE
get some good of it...
She looks almost too obviously at Charlie, which annoys
Laurie. Laurie resumes her letter reading:
LAURIE
(peering closely)
There's a word crossed out... It
looks like 'I wish' or 'I will'...
(she gives up)
Anyway... 'I set pen aside in the
hope you are enjoying good health
and your folks the same... I remain,
respectfully...
(forlornly)
yours truly, Martin Paulie.'
That's all there is. Not a cross on it. Laurie just looks at
it. Jorgensen stands, pocketing his pipe, easing the crick
in his back. He ceremoniously removes the spectacles and
replaces them on the mantel.
JORGENSEN
They never find that girl.
LAURIE
(half to herself)
Yours truly...
(hotly)
And he even has to write his full
name... Martin Pauley... not even
just Martie!...
(she stands)
I don't care if he never comes back!
She heads for the front door.
MRS. JORGENSEN
(rising -- saying it
without conviction)
Now, Laurie!...
Charlie hits the guitar a little stronger. Mrs. Jorgensen
looks at him -- and the matchmaker is at work.
MRS. JORGENSEN
Charlie, you'll stay for supper?...
Now I won't take no for an answer.
CHARLIE
Thought of saying 'no' never crossed
my mind, Miz Jorgensen... No place
I'd rather be than right here, right
now.
Mrs. Jorgensen smiles and moves about her duties. Laurie has
opened the door and is staring out wistfully... and Charlie
begins playing and singing a verse from "Skip to My Lou."
CHARLIE
(singing)
One old boot and a button shoe One
old boot and a button shoe...
FADE OUT
FADE IN
as Ethan and Martin enter. It is a dirt-floored room with a
small bar near the door, chairs and benches along the walls.
A pair of guitar players are at the far end of the room. A
couple of Mexicans are playing a noisy game of dominoes,
slapping the dominoes down hard... EMILIO FIGUEROA, back to
the door, spurred boots across one of the tables, is sipping
a drink. Emilio is a cynical, middle-aged, aristocratic-
looking man in modified charro costume. Watching the domino
game is ESTRELLA, lithe, sensuous, smoking a brown-paper
cigarette; she is barefoot. Behind the bar is the proprietor,
dozing on his stool. Ethan takes a step into the room.
ETHAN
(loudly)
MOSE!.... MOSE HARPER?
The proprietor awakens. The domino game is suspended in mid-
play. Estrella turns... and from beside Emilio, previously
obscured by the man's back and the big charro hat, pokes the
head of old Mose. Emilio turns then to look at the newcomers.
MOSE
Ay-eh...?
He is on his feet and advancing to meet them. As he recognizes
them a wide, foolish grin splits his face and his mouth opens
and closes in words that won't come out. He grabs and shakes
Ethan's arm, then Martin's.
ETHAN
Leggo my arm... You look mangier 'n
ever.
MOSE
Ain't been too good... No sir, not
too good... Gettin' old, Ethan...
ETHAN
You were born old...
PROPRIETOR
(all smiles - as they
head for the bar)
Bienvenidos, senores... Pulque?...
tequila?... mescal?... huiskey?
ETHAN
Tequila...
MARTIN
Lo mismo.
PROPRIETOR
(beaming)
Y' par' el Viejo -- el vino del
pais... tequila tambien!
Martin puts his back to the bar, leans elbows on it and looks
around.
158A
She is giving him an appraising once-over, then signals the
musicians to play. She rests her buttocks against a table
and waits, her eyes challenging Martin to make a move. Emilio
is watching Estrella and Martin with something akin to bored
amusement.
158B
Ethan has poured a drink for Mose, now one for himself --
leaving Martin's glass empty.
MOSE
I been helpin' ye, Ethan... I been
lookin' all the time...
Martin turns back to the bar to take his glass. He finds it
empty.
MARTIN
(to Ethan's back)
Thanks for nothin'...
He angrily throws a coin on the counter, appropriates the
bottle and his glass and heads for a table closer to Estrella.
Neither Ethan nor Mose seems aware of his going.
ETHAN
Well, the reward still stands...
MOSE
Don't want no money, Ethan... jus' a
place -- a roof over m' head... a
little grub... a bunk to sleep in...
an' a rockin' chair by the fire...
my own rockin' chair by a fire...
ETHAN
You help me find her, you got your
rockin' chair...
MOSE
Swear it, Ethan?... Given word?
ETHAN
(impatiently)
Told ya, didn't I?
MOSE
(impressively)
Ethan... I found a man's seen her...
knows where little Debbie is!
Ethan stares at him. Mose nods his reaffirmation of it.
Then Ethan's hand locks on the old man's shoulder.
ETHAN
Who? Where is he... this man?
Mose winces under the grip. He can't speak, but he looks
past Ethan and he points. Ethan turns. Emilio swings his
boots off the table and slowly crosses to them. He lets
cigarette smoke curl out of his mouth. Then he smiles.
EMILIO
I am this man, senor... Emilio Gabriel
Fernandez y Figueroa... at your
service...
(afterthought)
...for a price...
(he smiles)
...Always for a price...
As the men study each other, Estrella begins her dance --
and the rhythmic click of the castanets will beat like a
metronome. Emilio looks at the bottle on the bar, disdainfully
pushes it away and imperiously signals the proprietor to
bring something better.
EMILIO
Un otra!
He is knocking off his tequila and looking at the girl
hungrily. She is doing her swaying dance, playing up to him
and with unmistakable effect. He sloshes another drink into
his glass and, never taking his eyes off her, downs it.
Beyond Estrella we see Ethan, Emilio, and Mose at the bar --
gestures, headshakes, the entire pantomime of an inaudible
conversation. Then Ethan takes out his pouch and begins
dropping gold pieces into Emilio's hand. Meanwhile, dance
and dancer are achieving their purpose with Martin. And the
tequila is working. He gets to his feet, a little groggily.
Estrella's smile deepens and there is a clear invitation in
her eyes... Ethan turns then, his deal with Emilio concluded,
and he sees what is going on. He starts for Martin's table
just as Martin moves out to take the girl.
ETHAN
(tolerantly)
Come on, Don Juan... We're on our
way...
Martin tries to push him away, his eyes still on the girl.
MARTIN
(thickly)
Lemme alone...
ETHAN
(taking his arm)
You breeds are all alike -- two drinks
an'...
Martin breaks free and squares off.
MARTIN
Take yer hands off'n me... This lady
an' me got some things to talk over!
Estrella ranges herself alongside of Martin and slips an arm
possessively through his.
ETHAN
(a shrug)
Suit yourself... While you're enjoyin'
your little conversation, I'll be
ridin' out with Senor Fernandez
here...
The Comanch' medicine country
ain't far... there's one camp with a
chief named Cicatriz.
MARTIN
Never heard of him...
ETHAN
Cicatriz is Mex for Scar... an' he
has a white girl in his tepee... Be
seein' you...
He turns and heads out. Emilio, who has come up behind him,
gives Estrella a slight smile and bow.
EMILIO
Buena suerte, Estrella... Hasta la
vista.
He follows Ethan. Estrella swings her body close to Martin
and lets her arms slide around his neck.
ESTRELLA
(softly)
Tu quieres...?
Martin blinks to clear away the fog of tequila and desire.
MARTIN
(a bitter laugh)
Sure... sure... Only not this year...
He pulls her arms away and goes lurching after the others.
Mose catches his arm.
MOSE
'Mind Ethan 'bout my rockin' chair!
Martin continues out and Mose stands there -- his head rockin'
as though he already were in his chair.
DISSOLVE TO:
A small fire burns in the center of the lodge and a shaft of
sunlight strikes in from the smoke flap at the peak.
Two chunky squaws, who have been tending the fire or grinding
corn in a rock pestle, scuttle to a side of the tepee. Two
others, one half-grown and the other slightly taller, sit
with their backs to the fire, huddled over some leather work
or stitching. Both are shawled. As Scar enters, he barks a
word to the squaws near the fire.
SCAR
Pie-kay! (Clear out!)
(then he turns to the
white men)
IH-CARD!
(Sit!)
He sits on some robes, signs for them to sit opposite.
Slowly they look around them.
TTE TWO OLDER SQUAWS
They are sitting with heads averted, slightly profiled --
but clearly Indian women, broad-faced, dark of hair and skin.
EMILIO'S VOICE
His sons are dead... So his wives
sit on the honor side of his lodge.
ONES
ETHAN
(glancing at them)
Are those his wives too?
One of the squaws turns -- and even in the shadows we see it
is another Indian face. The other does not turn.
Scar leans in, blocking the view.
SCAR
Two sons -- killed by white men...
For each son, I take many scalps...
(in Comanche)
Mayah-kay zee-eh!...
(Bring the lance!)
The slightly smaller of the young squaws stiffens but doesn't
move. Scar glares.
SCAR
(louder)
MAYAH-KAY ZEE-EH!
The girl gets to her feet. Ethan and Martin watch as, still
with averted face, she crosses to where a lance hangs from
the tepee wall. It has several scalps on it, including one
with light red hair. Slowly she carries it back. Scar never
takes his eyes from the faces of the white men, savoring
every moment of it. The girl extends the lance between them,
so that it is like a bare blade separating two duelists.
Neither Ethan nor Martin dares at first look at more than
the scalp pole... Then slowly their eyes lift... and the
CAMERA MOVES IN and RAISES TO:
As the shawl slips back to reveal her light hair, the slant
green eyes looking at them from a tanned, but still white
and very beautiful face. (NOTE TO MUSIC: The SEARCH THEME
should cover all the foregoing action -- but at the first
clear view of DEBBIE, it ends dramatically.)
Debbie's eyes hold theirs -- and then Scar's voice is heard:
SCAR
(in Comanche)
Pie-kay!
(Go!)
Swiftly she straightens, takes away the scalp pole and goes
back to her former place.
Scar is watching the white men like a hawk. Martin's eyes
are wide and his breathing seems suspended. But Ethan is
playing it like a poker player.
ETHAN
(his voice controlled)
I've seen scalps before...
Scar's eyes are mocking. He lets his robe slip back from his
shoulders, revealing a bare bronzed chest on which -- glinting
in the reflected firelight -- is the medallion that Ethan
had given Debbie. It is suspended by a chain or rawhide
string. Scar touches it.
SCAR
This before?
Ethan smiles -- and he's still playing poker. He stands...
and the others follow. Scar is puzzled.
ETHAN
(to Emilio)
I came to trade, not to admire his
collection... Tell him we're going
to pitch camp across the crick...
Maybe we can talk trade tomorrow.
Scar hasn't understood all of it. He scowls and looks at
Emilio.
SCAR
(in Comanche)
Ee-sap! Pabbo-tie-bo ee-sap!
(He lies! The gringo
lies!)
EMILIO
(placatingly)
Tomorrow -- manana -- 'puetze.'
Scar looks at Ethan and at Martin. He smiles slightly, and
he nods his agreement.
SCAR
Puetze!
Martin and Ethan turn to go. Only then does Debbie look
swiftly at them and as swiftly away. Martin can't help but
pause, but Ethan prods him toward the tepee flap.
Ethan is lying on the hard earth, perhaps cushioned with
some boughs. He is half delirious. A small fire is burning.
Martin enters carrying the canteens. He looks
unsympathetically toward Ethan, then continues to the fire,
takes a knife and starts to sterilize it. Ethan gasps, mumbles
and then a word comes clear.
ETHAN
Martha... Martha!
Martin stares at him -- and now, perhaps for the first time,
he is fitting pieces into the jig-saw puzzle. He shifts closer
to Ethan and we see he is preparing to dig out the bullet.
Ethan opens his eyes and looks at him.
MARTIN
I gotta open that leg and let the
poison out...
He poises the knife.
ETHAN
Wait...
He fumbles in his shirt pocket, brings out a greasy folded
piece of paper.
ETHAN
Just in case... Read it.
Martin sets the knife down, takes the paper, opens it and
slowly reads:
MARTIN
'I, Ethan Edwards, being of sound
mind and without any blood kin, do
hereby bequeath all my property of
any kind to Martin Pauley...'
(he stares, then)
I don't want your property.... 'Sides,
what do you mean no 'blood kin?'
Debbie's your blood kin...
ETHAN
Not no more.
MARTIN
(angrily)
You can keep your will!
(he thrusts it back
into Ethan's shirt)
I ain't forgettin' you was all set
to shoot her yourself... What kind
o' man are you, anyway.
ETHAN
(sitting up -- eyes
blazing)
She's been with the bucks! She's
nothin' now but a...
Martin shoves him back onto the ground.
MARTIN
(a shout)
Shut your dirty mouth!
He gets to his feet, trembling, and stands looking down at
Ethan, his fists clenched at his sides and murder in his
eyes. Then his eyes rove to the knife lying on the blanket.
He picks it up and he looks again at the wounded man.
MARTIN
(slowly)
I hope you die!
And he kneels again to open the wound.
DISSOLVE TO:
A party is in progress. Fiddler and banjo-player are playing
a lively square dance for one or two sets of dancers --
ranchers, their wives and daughters. Laurie is not in
evidence. At the far end of the room is a table with a punch
bowl set up and a cluster of men and women about.
Jorgensen is at the door boisterously welcoming some new
arrivals. Leading them into the room is Captain the Reverend
Sam Clayton, with a bulky oil-skin package under his arm.
With him is Charlie MacCorry, dressed in his best black suit
and scrubbed until he looks raw.
Behind them come three or four other competent-looking men --
Rangers all of them.
JORGENSEN
(shouting)
They're here, mama... Come in, come
in...
Clayton waits for Charlie to come abreast, then hits him on
the back and drives him inside.
CLAYTON
Here he is, Lars... Combed, curried
'n washed behind the ears!
Mrs. Jorgensen hurries over, beaming, to admire Charlie.
MRS. JORGENSEN
Why, Charlie, you look real handsome!
CHARLIE
(grinning)
Yes'm... scarcely reck'nize myself...
Where's Laurie?
Mrs. Jorgensen smiles and playfully pushes him toward the
guests.
MRS. JORGENSEN
You'll see her soon enough...
Clayton -- and the other Rangers -- have been hanging gunbelts
on pegs along the wall. Now he shakes out his parcel --
disclosing a green-black frock coat.
CLAYTON
(nodding to the music)
Say, that music sounds so good it
must be sinful...
MRS. JORGENSEN
Grab a partner, reverend!
CLAYTON
Well, now, a man of my age just can't
haul off and dance in cold blood...
but if there's any of that wild cherry
brandy of yours, Lars...
JORGENSEN
(suddenly sober)
Nooo...
(change of heart)
Yah, by golly... One jug left... I
get it!
Mrs. Jorgensen glares as he heads out.
MRS. JORGENSEN
Last winter that man swore up and
down there wasn't a drop left -- and
me with pneumoney!... Reverend, you'd
better start clergyin' again!
as he enters, with Jorgensen at his heels. For a moment, as
he stands there, the party breezes on. Then first one, then
another sees him. They gape, and the music falters and stops.
Sam Clayton crosses to confront him across the width of the
room. Jorgensen tries to be the easy, smiling host--and makes
a very bad job of it.
JORGENSEN
Look everybody... Look who's...
He can't even finish it but stands there making flapping
gestures.
-- others gaping. During the opening lines, Jorgensen will
covertly back toward the door to the inner room -- Laurie's
room.
ETHAN
(to all)
Evenin'... evenin' Reverend... or do
I call you 'Captain'...?
CLAYTON
Came here for a wedding, Ethan...
Until that's over, I reckon 'reverend'
will do...
MRS. JORGENSEN
(coming forward)
And news of our little girl, Ethan?
His face contorts and his smile is twisted.
ETHAN
She's not a little girl any more.
MRS. JORGENSEN
(eyes wide)
You've seen her!... She's alive?
ETHAN
I've seen her... and she's alive.
Mrs. Jorgensen throws herself against his chest, sobbing.
Ethan looks past her at Clayton. And the faces of both men
are grim.
CUT TO:
The room is dark. Martin is pacing, eyes constantly turning
to the inside door. And then it opens and Laurie is inside,
holding a lamp. She is in her bridal gown and very obviously
trying to keep from betraying the stress she is under.
LAURIE
(quietly)
Hello, Martie....
He just stares at her -- very lovely, strangely remote.
He suddenly is conscious of his dirty hands, his dusty, worn
clothing.
MARTIN
I... I wrote you a letter... Reckon
you didn't get it...
LAURIE
(setting the lamp
down)
One letter in five years... I read
it till the paper dried up and the
writing faded out...
MARTIN
It wasn't much of a letter...
LAURIE
No, it wasn't... You mighta said you
loved me... You mighta asked me to
wait... At least that'd have been
something...
MARTIN
But I allus loved you... You know
that, without my sayin' it... I
couldn't bring myself to ask you to
wait... the little I had... not
knowin' how much longer until we
found Debbie...
LAURIE
(breaking)
It isn't fair...
She sinks onto the bench.
LAURIE
(sobbing)
It isn't fair, Martin Pauley, and
you know it!
She begins to cry, very softly. He is beside her and his arm
goes around her shoulder comfortingly.
MARTIN
Don't cry, Laurie... I understand
how it is... I'll just go 'way...
LAURIE
(spinning on him)
You do and I'll die, Martie... I
will! I'll just die!
And they are kissing through her tears when the outer door
is flung open by Charlie MacCorry. They part as he glares.
CHARLIE
I'll thank you to leave the room,
Laurie.
Martin stares at him, then at her.
MARTIN
(incredulous)
Charlie MacCorry!... You weren't
fixin' to marry HIM??
CHARLIE
She sure is!... An' don't think your
comin' back is goin' to change it!
MARTIN
As to that, I don't know, Charlie...
We hadn't got around to talkin'
marriage...
CHARLIE
What right you got to be talkin'
marriage to any decent woman...
MARTIN
(angrily)
If you're talkin' about that crazy
murder charge...
CHARLIE
AND other things... Mebbe you thought
you was gettin' away with being
comical about that Indian wife you
took... I bet she wasn't the first
squaw you...
Martin swings wildly but Charlie is a wily fighter. He side-
steps and chops Martin in the jaw and drives him against the
wall. Laurie runs between them.
LAURIE
Stop it! Both of you... I won't have
any fighting in this house.
Martin gently brushes her aside.
MARTIN
It's all right... Charlie, let's
move outside.
CHARLIE
I ain't wearing no gun.
Martin nods and unbuckles his gunbelt. The men head outside
as Laurie runs to get help.
The last of the wedding guests is leaving: Ed Nesby carrying
his bull fiddle and with his wife and daughter and two smaller
children preceding him out the door.
The Jorgensens stand by -- trying to put a good face on the
wedding debacle. Charlie MacCorry is sitting dejectedly,
studying a spot on the floor. Ethan is at the mantel. Laurie
is in her room -- presumably changing out of her wedding
gown. Martin is at a sink, bathing a cut on his lip. Clayton,
still in his clerical coat, is near the door.
NESBY
(a grin)
Well... it was a nice weddin' party...
considerin' no one got married...
'Night.
JORGENSEN
Good night, Ed...
Mrs. Jorgensen puts her handkerchief to her eyes -- letting
down now that the guests have gone. Jorgensen crosses to
her, pats her sympathetically.
JORGENSEN
Now, mamma!...
He leads her away. Clayton faces Ethan.
CLAYTON
I got to ask you and Martin to ride
to the State Capitol with me, Ethan.
ETHAN
This an invite to a necktie party,
Reverend?
CLAYTON
Captain... Nope, wouldn't say that...
Likely you had your reasons for
killin' Futterman... Probably needed
killin'... I'm speaking as a ranger
now, not as a reverend... Fact that
all three was shot in the back is
the only thing that's raised some
question -- that and a missin' gold
piece known to have been on him just
prior to his demise.
Ethan casually reaches into his pocket, takes out a gold
coin and spins it.
ETHAN
(casually)
That so?
Martin crosses to confront Clayton.
MARTIN
I ain't goin' to Austin, Reverend.
Charlie gets to his feet and he has his gun in his hand.
CHARLIE
You're goin' if the captain says
you're goin'...
CLAYTON
Now, now... let's not grow
disputatious...
Fast hoofbeats sound o.s. -- signalling the approach of a
four-man cavalry detail.
CLAYTON
(turning)
What's that? More company?
He and Jorgensen head for the door.
CLAYTON
Kinda late getting here, aren't they?
A voice hails from outside.
LIEUTENANT'S VOICE
Hello there! Captain Clayton?
Clayton stands in the opened doorway, Jorgensen behind him,
looking out. Drawn up outside is the four-man cavalry detail,
led by a young and very crisp LIEUTENANT. We may or may not
see the sixth man, slouched over his horse. The Lieutenant
swings off and crosses.
LIEUTENANT
Is Captain Clayton here, Reverend?
CLAYTON
I'm Clayton.
The Lieutenant gapes at Clayton's ministerial coat.
LIEUTENANT
(doubtfully)
You're Captain Clayton?...
Ethan chuckles, to Clayton's very obvious annoyance.
LIEUTENANT
(recovering, he salutes)
Colonel Greenhill's compliments,
sir.
The Colonel wishes to know how soon you could put a company
of Rangers in the field, fully armed and...
CLAYTON
Hold on, son... Who's this Colonel
Greenhill you're talking about?
LIEUTENANT
Why Colonel Greenhill is Colonel
Greenhill, sir... Commanding Officer,
Fifth U.S. Cavalry... I'm Lieutenant
Greenhill, sir.
CLAYTON
Oh... Now what's this your pa wants
to know?
LIEUTENANT
My pa wants to know... Colonel
Greenhill wants to know how soon you
could put a company of your Rangers
in the field, fully armed and
equipped, for joint punitive action
against the Comanches.
CLAYTON
JOINT action?
LIEUTENANT
Yes sir... We've received information
about a band of Comanches under a
chief named Scar...
ETHAN
What information?
LIEUTENANT
That maybe he's not far from here --
holed up somewhere, waiting his chance
to get back over the border... He
raided north about a month ago...
ran into more army than he bargained
for... Now he's running for cover,
for keeps this time...
CLAYTON
And what makes you think he's in
this territory?
LIEUTENANT
Yesterday, one of our patrols picked
up a man claims he was a prisoner
with Scar till only two days ago...
He talks crazy but I brought him
along... Says he lives here... keeps
mentioning a rocking chair.
ETHAN
(half to himself)
Mose...
And then he is striding to the door, calling it:
ETHAN
MOSE!
MOSE'S VOICE
Ay-he?... Ay-eh?...
And the old man totters in, half-supported by a trooper --
hollow-eyed, weak, almost delirious.
MOSE
Come f'r my rockin' chai'... ole
Mose.
ETHAN
(shouting it)
Where's Scar, Mose... SCAR?
MARTIN
Ask him about Debbie!... Is she all
right, Mose?
MOSE
My rockin' chai'...
MRS. JORGENSEN
(bustling over)
Leave the poor man be! Can't you see
he's out of his mind...
She tries to lead him away, but Ethan shoves her aside and
grips the old man by his arms.
ETHAN
Mose... try to remember!... You were
in Scar's camp...
MOSE
Ay-he... Made out I was crazy...
(he giggles foolishly)
Ate dirt... chewed grass... I fooled
'em, Ethan!... an' I got away...
ETHAN
Scar! Where's he holed in?
MOSE
Seven Fingers... ay-he... Seven...
He staggers and this time Mrs. Jorgensen won't be denied.
MRS. JORGENSEN
Now that's enough!
Here... by the
fire... What you need's a good bowl
of soup...
She leads him away, at last to his rocker by the fire.
During this, Ethan and Clayton have been mulling Mose's
answer.
ETHAN
(blankly)
Seven Fingers?
LIEUTENANT
That's what he told us... but there's
no such place on the maps.
MARTIN
Wait a minute! Isn't that the Caddo
name for where all those canyons
branch on the Malapai?
MOSE
(from his rocker)
Caddo or Kiowa... ay-he... ay-eh...
Sam Clayton wheels on the Lieutenant.
CLAYTON
You tell your pa a company of Rangers --
all fourteen of 'em -- fully armed
an' equipped will be in the field by
daylight... headin' for the south
end of the Malapai. If he can catch
up with us, well an' good...
LIEUTENANT
But... but captain, we can't possibly
take the field tomorrow... for your
own protection...
CLAYTON
Sonny, yonder's a passel of murderers,
complete with Texican scalps an'
white girl captive... You want to
protect us, you just get out of our
way... Now skedaddle!
The lieutenant skedaddles. Sam whirls on Martin and Ethan.
CLAYTON
Ethan, you an' Martin are hereby
appointed civilian scouts -- without
pay... Charlie, hightail it to
headquarters an' spread the word...
CHARLIE
Yes sir...
He leaves. Martin's hands go to his side -- recalling where
he left his guns.
MARTIN
My guns...
He heads for the inner door to the grandmother room.
as Martin enters and crosses to where he had dropped his
gunbelt. Even before he reaches it, Laurie is in the room --
closing the door after her.
LAURIE
Martie... don't go! Not this time.
MARTIN
(staring)
You crazy?
LAURIE
It's too late... She's a woman grown
now...
MARTIN
I got to fetch her home...
LAURIE
Fetch what home?... The leavin's of
Comanche bucks -- sold time an' again
to the highest bidder?... With savage
brats of her own, most like?...
MARTIN
(shouting it)
Laurie! Shut your mouth!
LAURIE
Do you know what Ethan will do if he
has a chance?... He'll put a bullet
in her brain! And I tell you Martha
would want him to!
MARTIN
Only if I'm dead!
He strides out past her.
as Martin re-enters. Ethan and Sam are waiting. Martin looks
hard at Ethan.
CLAYTON
You ready?
MARTIN
(eyes never leaving
Ethan's face)
I'm ready.
As they stride out,
CUT TO:
204-A
LAURIE - NIGHT
as she stands at the window, in her bridal gown, and sadly
watches Martin again going away. Softly the score reprises --
sadly now -- "Skip to My Lou."
DISSOLVE TO:
as Martin enters. One robe, tossed back, shows where Scar
has slept. Against one wall lie the huddled figures of two
squaws. Two other figures -- one being Debbie's -- sleep in
robes. Martin's eyes go to Scar's place and then rove slowly
and hold on:
She moves slightly so that the light strikes her fair hair.
Martin kneels close to her and gently touches her shoulder,
to awaken her. Her eyes open, then widen in fear. Martin
quickly claps a hand over his mouth.
Silently she fights him, trying to pull the hand away.
MARTIN
(a hoarse whisper)
Debbie... don't!
And then her fingernails rake his hand. He winces and lets
go. She screams and tries to leap up. He grabs her. The other
squaws wake -- begin squawking.
MARTIN
(grimly)
I'm takin' you whether you want to
or not...
Debbie sees something beyond him. Her eyes widen.
DEBBIE
(a scream)
MARTIN!
P.O.V. - SCAR
He looms in the flap of the tepee much as he had over the
grave when he first kidnapped her. He has a scalping knife
in his hand. Scar whips his arm back. Behind him we see the
other Comanche -- the one from the horse herd.
Martin spins and his gun is out. He fans the trigger hammer
twice -- and both slugs hit Scar. As the other Comanche leaps
in, Martin's gun speaks again. And then he is on his feet,
catching Debbie by the arm -- unresisting now -- and pulling
her after him through the camp. Shouts and cries bespeak the
awakening of the camp.
