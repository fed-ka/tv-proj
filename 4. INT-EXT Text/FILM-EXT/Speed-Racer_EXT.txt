Speed slides down the railing on his butt, a perpetual
motion machine as he scans the street, smiling as he sees-
Across the street, leaning against his hot rod, his big
brother, Rex Racer.
4.
CONTINUED:
He pauses crossing the street letting two impossibly cool
cars pass by.
Here we begin to see the unique and individualized nature
of the automobile in the world of Speed Racer. In this
world, the grocery store parking lot looks like a car
collector show; vintage and concept cars are as
ubiquitous as the Camry is in our world.
Speed dashes across the street, a tight parabolic arc
around the car, his little head sticking up like a shark
fin circling until--
The car door pops open and snaps shut.
The seat-belt clicks into place before Rex even has a
chance to move. He leans over and looks in the window.
Speed smiles.
REX
.I take it you're ready to go?
Speed nods. Rex climbs in beside him.
REX (CONT'D)
So, who was school?
YOUNG SPEED
Fine. Are you going to the track?
Mom said you were. You don't have
to drop me off, I could just go
with you.
REX
No way.
He starts the car and roadster growls to life.
YOUNG SPEED
Oh, come on, take me with you.
Come on, please.
REX
I can't, Speed. Pops would kill
me.
YOUNG SPEED
He doesn't have to know. I won't
say anything. Nobody will know.
Come on, please, Rex, pleaseplease
pleasepleasepleeeease.
Rex sighs, knowing there's no way he can with this.

CONTINUED: (2)
REX
Are you wearing the socks?
Lickety-split, Speed sticks his sneaker up against the
dash board and pulls back his pant leg revealing--
A bright red sock.
REX (CONT'D)
You roll us again and this'll be
the last time? Deal?
A ten year old's grin spreads ear to ear.
YOUNG SPEED
Deal.
The first gen T-180 screams along the metal raceway.
The car.banks up a wall and roars down, swooping past.
6.
The modern T-180's come flying overhead, slamming down
against the metal track, scattering bright bursts of
shooting sparks in their wake.
It is smaller than a typical crew pit since the cars
don't really pit. There is a panel like a sound mixing
board filled with needled gauges and green-barred light
meters.
Sparky is watching through binoculars.
SPARKY
I figure he'll slingshot after you
in the next turn.
SPEED
I'm ready.
9.
The cars explode into the next turn when Snake uses the
draft to slingshot by the car ahead of him--
Hurling like a bullet straight at Speed as--
Speed thumbs a button on his steering wheel causing jacks
to shoot out of the bottom of the car and sending it up
into the air just as--
Snake flies under it, careening into the bottom of the
turn too tightly, bouncing of the rail, out of control,
ricochetting back at Speed as--
He turns his wheels, catching a part of Snake's car with
the grace of a bull-fighter, sending it spinning away
towards the other cars while--
Speed rockets free--
Eliciting a huge roar from the crowd.
Sparky smiles.
SPARKY
Great move, Speed. Careful on the
butterfly coming up. You may wanna
ease up--
SPEED
Not this time, Sparky.
Speed careens through a butterfly turn like there was a
slot-guide in the track causing another crowd roar.
They can feel that something special might be happening.
Sparky checks his stop watch.
SPARKY
Holy canoli, Speed, You know who
you're racing?
10.
CONTINUED:
He can see him.
SPEED
Yeah...
Just ahead, the ghost of his brother's car launches up
the second jump and when ti comes down we are back in the
past.
Rex drives the older model T-180, a man on a mission,
dominating the race exactly like Speed.
Pops stands watching the race through binoculars Young
Spped is beside him.
YOUNG SPEED
Rex's gonna win, ain't he, Pops?
Pops checks his watch but almost can't believe it. He
goes back to his binoculars.
YOUNG SPEED (CONT'D)
He's gonna win it. He's gonna set
the course record. Nobody's gonna
catch him.
POPS
Quiet, Speed! There's a lotta race
to run.
YOUNG SPPED
No way. It's over. My brother's
the best racer in the world.
Everybody else is running for
second.
The cars rocket through the twisted mobius of steel.
Blackjack Benelli grabs one of the crew chief, knotting
his fists in the fabric of the path-covered cover alts.
BLACKJACK BENELLI
I told you to take him out!
11.
CONTINUED:
CREW CHIEF #1
We're trying, sir. He's just too
fast.
Rex blazes by, the track rattling like a metal roller-
coaster, opening an even bigger lead.
As we move around Rex's car, we see suddenly there is
someone right behind him, a ghost car--
Speed.
As Speed makes his move, he pulls us back into the
present.
in the glass of Pop's binos we can see the dim reflection
of the two brothers racing.
12.
CONTINUED:
Pops stands beside Mom. He is still watching the race
with his trusty binos though he is now a little older,
plumper and balder..
He clicks his stopwatch, checking it at the same time
that Sprittle checks his. Sprittle stands on the chair
next to him.
SPRITTLE
Jeepers, he could do it, Pops. He
could really do it, couldn't he?
Pops goes back to his binos.
SPRITTLE (CONT'D)
What if he does? What if he does
it, Pops?
POPS
Sssh!
SPRITTLE
I don't know if I can watch
this...
He holds the binos as though afraid to look when--
A hairy hand comes in and takes them away.
Chim-chim, sitting on the chair next to Sprittle, puts
the binos to his eyes.
Speed flies through a piece of tricky track drawing
another cheer.
Sprittle grabs the binos back just as the beautiful young
woman, standing on the other side of Pops, lowers her.
Trixie chews at her lip, feeling a knot twist into her
gut.
The little girl wearing the pink barrette is walking with
a pack of girls, their little mouths as sharp as razors.
In the distance we hear a high-pitched motorized whine.
BLONDE PACK LEADER
My Daddy told me he used to work
for the Mishida Motorwerks but he
quit.
(MORE)
13.
CONTINUED:
BLONDE PACK LEADER (CONT'D)
My daddy said that was a
completely crazy thing to do. He
says the whole family is crazy.
TRIXIE
Speed's not crazy.
BLONDE PACK LEADER
No, he's just dumb. Probably the
dumbest kid in class. Ms.
Waterstraat had me alphabetize the
IRB tests and you wouldn't believe
what that retard did--
Sock!
Trixie decks her to the shock of the rest of the pack
just as the whine grows very loud and--
Speed comes rounding the bend on a little go-cart,
wearing his too-big helmet making his big head seem
ridiculously enormous.
Zipping past, he suddenly notices the girl in the pink
barrette standing over another girl; there is something
about her--
Maybe it's way she's got her fists up, like a boy, or
maybe it's the. way her jaw is set, ready to take on
ANYONE--
Whatever it is, when their eyes suddenly meet, he finds
he is unable to look away--
Staring at her, as he drives off the road, crashing
through a hedge and tumbling down a hill.
TRIXIE
Speed!
She runs to help him.
He is laying sprawled out, his car on its side, wheels
still spinning.
TRIXIE (CONT'D)
Are you alright?
He's a bit groggy.
SPEED
.who are you?
TRIXIE
I'm Trixie. I'm in your class.
14.
CONTINUED: (2)
SPEED
.oh .yeah.
He stares at her for a minute, powder-puffs of clouds
floating about her head.
SPEED (CONT'D)
He, would you like to see my car
COLLECTION
She smiles.
TRIXIE
I'd love to.
Feeling the storm of emotions that she knows Speed must
be feeling, she takes a deep breath and raises the binos
back up.
Through the magnifying lenses we see Speed flying around
the track.
Speed blister through the high-banked slalom and it seems
at first that he is all alone but then we see the trace
effect as we realize that the two cars are making
perfectly identical moves until--
They bank into a straightaway, splitting apart, like a
shadow suddenly cut free as both cars accelerate--
Neck and neck, the past a mirror of the present.
YOUNG SPEED (V.0.)
Can I go with you, Re
Speed and the ghost of his brother cross, switching
positions as the memories come faster and faster.
Speed tightens his grip on the wheel.
His jaw locks, as he remains trapped between two
different forces.
19.
Young Speed is clobbering a kid who is twice his size. A
teacher finally pulls them apart.
BIG MOUTH
I just told him the truth! His
crum-bum brother doesn't belong on
a racetrack-- he belongs in jail!
Speed tears free and torpedoes Big Mouth again.
The two cars continue to dance around each other.
Speed presses down on the accelerator and starts to gain,
fighting the emotion welling behind his eyes.
Speed again pulls even with Rex as the finish line comes
into view.

The checkered flag goes up, ready as the two cars come

The large digital clock seemingly synchronized with the
past as--.
Speed looks over at the ghost car, the faintest smile on
his lips as he sees his older brother and then--
Takes his foot off the accelerator, letting Rex's car
surge ahead, crossing just before Speed.
The time is just over the record causing disappointment
to ripple through the crowd except for--
The Racer family who seem both relived and happy.
SPRITTLE
Come on, Let's go! Victory Lane!
The phone is ringing.
The K-Harrier drifts through the polygonal mountain range
where glittering minarets of steel and glass crown
towering cathedrals of commerce.
Helicopters swarm like pollinating bees in summer field.
The vista is filled with the icons of every conceivable
business in very conceivable language. It is a landscape
that merges the pop-art sensibility of Warhol with the
urban sprawl of Blade Runner.
Power gleams off every surface and line of the strata-
scape.
The K-Harrier glides gracefully down to the private
landing pad.
The truck slows, easing onto the shoulder as the black
car follows.
The back of the truck slides up and the gangsters toss
Katsu out, leaving him behind with a spray of gravel.
Katsu looks up into the glaring lights of the black car.
A car door opens. Boots crunch gravel as someone walks
toward us silhouetted by car lights. It is the masked
racer himself---
Racer x.
The same school that Speed attended but now where Rex
used to wait, Speed is leaning against the Mach-5. Chim-
chim is sitting next to him.
The bell rings and the students begin piling out. When
the last few tumble down the stairs, Chim-chim emits a
small, sad whine.
SPEED
Looks like someone's in trouble
again.
A gorgeous blimp shot of the race track which takes up an
entire island of Hawaii-like archipelago.
The track weaves in and out of the lush tropical
landscape set against the ocean shimmering with sequins
of sunlight.
Speed grips the steering wheel, revving the engine which
rattles the car like thunder shaking the sky as-- The
countdown finishes and as the cars explode forward, we
cut back--
The Ghost sees Speed rushing up behind him.
GRAY GHOST
We got ourselves a real race here!
The two cars start dancing around each other; like two
boxers sizing each other up.
GRAY GHOST (CONT'D)
Here we go, here we go.
Wham. Ghost throws the first punch which Speed tries to
slip but, the Ghost anticipates his move and slams Speed
hard.
65.
CONTINUED:
GRAY GHOST (CONT'D)
Come on! Show me something! Show
me what you got!
Speed ducks down the bank, working each wheel into a
hyper drift, reversing their position--
Locking the Ghost up and sending both cars spinning.
GRAY GHOST (CONT'D)
Ohhhh yeah! Yeeeeeahhhhh!
Weaving back and fourth behind Speed, the Gray Ghost
attacks with phantom punches that come out of nowhere.
GRAY GHOST
Here I come, kid! Watch out. Here
I am! Nope--I'm over here!
Wham! Wham! Speed tries to counter punch and the Ghost
slips under.
GRAY GHOST (CONT'D)
You can't.touch me! I'm here! I'm
gone!
Speed is thrown back into the pack of cars that quickly
swallow him up where he is--
Crunched into the wall by the Zokeo Communications car,
pinned until--
Racer X slams into the Zokeo car, freeing Speed but
causing several cars tp swerve wildly at which point--
The Three Roses car torpedoes Katsu's car--
Bursting into a blizzard of metal snowflakes while--
66.
Racer X roars past the debris and the bouncing rubber
cocoons.
Cruncher accepts the congratulations of the goon beside
him.
Another molar-cracking hit as Speed avoids the concrete,
pylon but is then slammed by the Zokeo car--
Underneath both cars, a spear-hook shoots out from a
hidden sleeve, harpooning the under-carriage of the Mach
5--
SPARKY
Speed, get out of there!
SPEED
I can't! I can't move!
The two cars head toward the final jump, locked in some
strange embrace--
They lunge awkwardly, crashing on top of one another as--
Inside Speed's car, his face plate seals and the kwiksave-
foam explodes, swallowing him, as the car tumbles--
Disintegrating into a cloud of smoke and glittering
debris.
67.
The Racer family is frozen. Their faces awash with fear
and disappointment while--
It is pouring rain as a large cab pulls up to drop off
the entire Racer family still wearing their island
clothes.
A dour-faced man beneath an umbrella is waiting for them.
DOUR FACE
Are you Pops Racer of Racer Motors-
POPS
Yeah, but I'm still on vacation-
DOUR FACE
You are hereby served a summons.
POPS
What?
DOUR FACE
You are being sued for IP
infringement by Janus Automakers.
SPEED
That's ridiculous!
DOUR FACE
That's for a jury to decide.
68.
Racer X doesn't like it.
RACER X
This is a bad idea.
INSPECTOR DETECTOR
If it was any other driver, you'd
be here.
Popsopens the door and Racer X sets his jaw.
POPS
Inspector Detector?
INSPECTOR DETECTOR
Good morning, Mr.. Racer. I know
it's been a long time--
74.
CONTINUED:
He extends his hand and Pop shakes it.
POPS
Ten years.
INSPECTOR DETECTOR
Yes. I'm sorry for this
intrusion, but I was hoping to
have a word with you and Speed.
Pops eyes the masked racer.
INSPECTOR DETECTOR (CONT'D)
It's important.
It is raining, the cockpit bubble smeared with the
distant traffic lights.
SPEED
And the way he was looking at me,
I don't know...I just gotta do
something.
TRIXIE
But Pops will never let you go.
SPEED
He won't if I ask him.
TRIXIE
Speed Racer what are you thinking?
SPEED
You weren't in Remmington's
office, Trix. You don't know what
it was like. It felt as though he
had his hand inside my chest and
he was trying to crush everything
in my life that mattered to me.
TRIXIE
I hate him. I'm picturing his
heart clogging with cholesterol
right now.
SPEED
No joke, Trix. If you could have
been in that room, you'd want to
do anything you could to take this
guy down.
She looks straight into his eyes and he doesn't have to
say anything else.
TRIXIE
All right. Let's do it. You're
going to need an alibi. We'll say
we're going skiing.
SPEED
What? No way!
78.
CONTINUED:
TRIXIE
You're going to need my help.
Casa Cristo is a rally. I can
spot from a 'copter.
SPEED
Trixie, this isn't a game. These
people play rough.
TRIXIE
I know. That's why I'm coming with
you. And if you even try to argue
with me, I'll tell Pops right now
and he won't let you out of his
sight.
SPEED
You would, wouldn't you?
He looks into her eyes and knows the answer.
SPEED (CONT'D)
Well...I guess we're going skiing.
She smiles.
We glide through the lines of race cars with x-ray vision
cam, revealing hidden weapons; spring loaded Ben-Hur tire
shredders, all manner of grabbers and grapplers as well
as bladders filled with oil or grease.
The horizon glows brighter, whispy clouds slowly soaking
up the blood-orange light.
TNT. HOTEL SUITE
They speak in Japanese.
HORUKO
This is wrong.what you are trying
to do.
KATSU
I have no choice. Their price is
an insult to four generations of
our family.
HORUKO
And if you die? Will then the
price be high enough?
The Queen sees the sun about to break.
A large memorial commemorates all the drivers who died
during this race: "In memory of those who gave
everything for their love of this sport."
Trixie stands beside Speed, both of them staring at the
name carved into the bronze plaque; Rex Racer.
87.
CONTINUED:
SPEED
I understand it now, Trix. I know
why he left us.
She looks at him.
SPEED (CONT'D)
He was trying to change this
rotten business and they killed
him for it.
The Queen raises a starter's pistol.
The sun cracks the horizon and the Queen fires the gun.
All at once tires explode into a wail of rubber burning
agony, smoke billowing from the sound of their screams.
The cars shoot down through the corridor of the small
streets like shotgun pellets through a barrel.
The cars roar through the streets to the cheers of the
locals, while above, team helicopters circle with the
industriousness of bees.
KNOCKING
Racer X smashes into one of the HydroCell team,
him into a series of billboards.
Katsu again smiles.
KATSU
Arrigato, X. Arrigato.
90:
Katsu roars out of the city onto the desert road.
The chain of cars weave along the ribbon of concrete
while the desert dunes raise up around them.
A red bearded driver named Billy Steel-belted, his team
covered in the Manecks' logo, begins sliding up next to
Speed.
91.
A cobra peeks his head out of a basket, charmed by a
gorgeous woman playing her flute.
In the audience, Cruncher moves up behind Billy.
He hands him a small black velvet bag.
Billy pours out a fistful of star-dust; the glint of
diamonds glitter in the greed of his smile.
Billy smiles revealing his diamond studded teeth then
swerves at Speed.
The Manecks team attacks, their cars flying at Katsu even
as a second team, the Atomic Injectables led by Tyrus
Tropp also attacks.
RACER X
This surprises me.
SPEED
Why?
RACER X
Tyrus is a good man. I wouldn't
expect him to turn head-hunter.
They aren't pulling any punches.
92.
The swerving, weaving chain of cars churns up a massive
cloud of dust in their wake.
Attacking cars are caught and spun out by Racer X and
Speed.
A hurricane of sand and dirt swirl around Katsu who sits
calmly in the eye of the storm while-
His guardian angels go into overdrive.
Racer X and Speed seem like they have been driving
together all their lives.
RACER X
Lead him--
SPEED
Here ya go!
Speed leads an attack straight into Racer X's counter.
RACER X
Wing left.
SPEED
Flying in!
93.
CONTINUED:
He jumps one car and blocks the attack on X.
As their cars merge in.and out from one another,
something seems perfectly clear to Speed--
He is back at Thunderhead with the ghost of his brother,
dancing around each other until--
TRIXIE
Speed!
Wham! Billy slams up against him--
Throwing a lever, a grappler locks on to the Mach 5.
SPEED
He's got me! I'm locked up!
Another lever is pumped like a tire pump and a sheaved
blade begins stabbing at Speed's tires.
Racer X watches unable to leave Katsu unprotected.
Speed hits the D button and the zircon saw blades start
gliding through the grappler.
RACER X
Get out of there! -
SPEED
I'm trying!
The knife slashes the tire which explodes just as the
grappler is cut--
Speed flips away free, hitting the "C" button causing a
new tire to inflate while he's upside down--
Landing on a new tire, without missing a beat.
Tyrus rushes into the opening, but this time it's Katsue
who works a hidden lever and--
A Katana-like blade flashes, a samurai slash across the
front tire--
Bowing it out, flipping the entire car, which tumbles
back straight at Speed, forcing him to try a split-jack
JUMP--
Firing only the rear jump-jacks, launching the back end
of the car while--
94.
CONTINUED: (2)
The front end of the Mach 5 clips against the Atomic
Injectibles car--
Sending Speed flipping end over end but landing with
strangely beautiful grace.
Sprittle and Chim-chim are laying in lounge chairs
wearing bathing suits and tanning goggles, holding
tanning mirrors under their chins.
Pops walks up.
POPS
I've got to go into town for some
parts. I'll be back for lunch.
SPRITTLE
Sure thing Pops.
Pops looks at them, shakes his head and walks off.
HIM
Sprittle slowly lowers his tanning goggles to watch
go.
SPRITTLE (CONT'D)
Let's go!
They drop their mirrors and bolt for the house.
The HydroCell team rear through the cobblestone streets
of the medieval city crossing the finish line to a
cheering crowd.
Another ninja crawls like a spider down to an. open
window.
d a
In the distance, the medieval walled city sinks behin
hill as the sunrises, the sound of rolling thunder
swelling as--
The race cars come flying over the hill, exploding past
us.
107.
Crowds lining the road cheer as the cars scream past.
Already starting to nudge and buck, trying to force an
early mistake,.Speed and Racer X are immediately forced
into their aggressively defensive driving.
Speed seems particularly wired.
SPEED
Watch your line!
Okamoto adjusts.
SPEED (CONT'D)
Cut left! Now!
Speed. flies into block for Okamoto, but Okamoto doesn't
create enough space.
SPEED (CONT'D)
Watch it!
They kiss with the shriek of crashing metal.
Almost on cue, the Medius Rez team launches at Okamoto,
who feints left and jumps, allowing Speed to smash-block
to the inside.

RACER X
Speed, you're too tight!
The cars bounce and Speed takes a hit, spinning for
moment before he regains control.
Speed mumbles to himself.
SPEED
This is completely--
Cruncher's thug watches through binoculars as Horuko
exits the hotel, then reports through his Bluetooth.
THUG
She's leavin' da hotel now.
Horuko is escorted to her waiting helicopter.
109.
The chain of jostling cars weave up the switchback with
the violence of clattering pachinko balls.
Speed is driving like a maniac.
SPEED
Left! Drift tight! Tight!
Okamoto looks like he's about to go over the edge.
110.
CONTINUED:
SPEED (CONT'D)
No!
Katsu's car swerves wildly back into the middle of the
road.
Every winding turn is another click on a fishing rod as
they slowly reel the HydroCell team in.
The Okamoto team moves with synchronized grace while
Snake and his team struggle to hold their line.
SNAKE
Watch it! What're you doin'?!
The mountains undulate, the cars dip and rise caught in
the current of this concrete river--
Flowing one way then another, the cars sawing across the
belly of one bend, drifting into the curve of another
UNTIL--
The Hydrocell emerges over the crest of a hill with the
Okamoto team tight to their bumpers.
SNAKE (CONT'D)
Just try it! Try to pass! Just
try it!
Racer X knows they're ready.
RACER X
Take 'em.
SPEED
With pleasure.
Speed slingshots from the back position, hurling
alongside the HydroCell team until--
Snake blocks him, setting up an attack by one of his team
but this just allows Racer X a hole to punch through.
The cars continue to slug it out still weaving up the
mountain road, climbing it seems to helicopter or blimp
height.
It remains at one level of intensity until---
Snakes bashes Trixie hard into the rail, driving her
almost over the edge, causing her to shriek from the
force of the blow--
And Speed loses it.
His jaw clenches, shifting into a whole new level of
intensity.
He becomes a cyclone, a whirling dervish, enveloping the
HydroCell team in a cloud of chaos---
Throwing, rending,. ripping through them until only Snake
is left.
Speed is not kind; battering him until he's not sure if
he's going forward or backward.
In a panic, Snakes reaches for a hidden lever but before
he can take hold of it, Speed clobbers him again, causing
him to shriek louder than Trixie and then--
Recede quickly away like a dog with its tail tightly
tucked.
The Okamoto team roars up to where everyone is waiting.
Speed climbs out of the Mach-5 and heads straight for
Trixie.
SPEED
I told you--
She turns ready to fight, if that's what he wants.
SPEED (CONT'D)
You are one helluva driver.
She smiles.
TRIXIE
You're not so bad yourself.
Sparky and Pops go to work, changing fuel cells and
starting to pound out some of the serious dents.
Racer X sees Cruncher guarded by the security team.
RACER X
What's he doing here?
KATSU
Stowaway. Weren't sure what to do
with him.
RACER X
Do what he'd do; break his legs
and let him walk back.
Horuko bows to Trixie.
HORUKO
Thank you so much.
TRIXIE
It was a blast.
SPARKY
Cells reloaded!

SPEED
Let's go!
They start to turn until machine gun fires objects.
THUG
Nobody move!
The thugs emerge from the surrounding wood.
POPS
What is this?!
UP
He strides towards the nearest goon but bullets spit
IN
the earth and snow at his feet causing him to freeze
place.
CRUNCHER
This is called a change of plan.
Now freed, one of the thugs tosses him a gun.
THUG
Yeah, that's right. We're
changing your plan that changed
our plan to change your
plan. - .right boss?
Cruncher decides to ignore that.
CRUNCHER
The new plan-- what was it, again?
Break your legs, make you.walk
back? I like that.
He stands smiling in front of Racer X.
CRUNCHER (CONT'D)
But first, I think it's time to
play a little peek-a-boo, I-see-
you.
One of the thugs pins Racer X's arms back as Cruncher
goes for the mask while--
Unnoticed by anyone, the trunk of the Mach-5 pops open
and four eyes peek out.
Cruncher starts to peel back the mask when a rock clips
him on the side of his head.
CRUNCHER
OWL
SPRITTLE
Monkey cookie!
He turns just as--
Whap! A monkey cookie in the kisser.
SPRITTLE (CONT'D)
Nice shot!
Chim-chim howls as Sprittle reloads his sling-shot.
POPS
Sprittle?!
CRUNCHER
Get that monkey!
The goons are confused, distracted, and before they can
control it, the fight is on--
Racer X throws the thug holding him--
Speed and Trixie dish out equal measures of chop-socky
and good of American slug-fu as--
Pops grapples and wrestles his goon into a head-lock.
Racer X hammers Cruncher to the ground where he sees his
gun, scrambling for it but just as he reaches for it--
Katsu steps on his hand.
It's a short quick turn around and--
RACER X
Looks like another change of plan.
119.

WHILE
The security guards herd up Cruncher and the thugs
Pops turns his attention to--
POPS
Sprittlel Get over here!
SPRITTLE
Ahhhh!
He and Chim-chim run behind Speed.
SPEED
Sprittle this isn't a game. You
could've been killed in there.
SPRITTLE
I.know it was bad! I know we
shouldn't have done it. But Chim-
chim was really really scared.
SPEED
Chim-chim?
SPRITTLE
Okay, I was a little scared too.
TRIXIE
Scared of what?
Sprittle clings to his big brother.
SPRITTLE
I didn't want what happened to Rex
to happen to you.
Racer X and Pops feel a hidden wound open.
SPRITTLE (CONT'D)
We just thought if you got into
trouble, maybe we could help and
it's a good thing we did.

Speed looks at Pops as if Sprittle is making

Go! Go! Go!
They rush to their cars, Speed leaping into the Mach-5.
Engines. growl, tires spin and gravel spits as the three
cars shoot back into the race.

C.C. ANNOUNCER
First out of the pass is... the
HydroCell team?
JOHNNY
Uh-oh. They better send the
emergency trailer--
C.C. ANNOUNCER
Wait! Is that--
Like eagles dropping from the sky, the Okamoto ream soars
out of the mouth of the pass.
Moon-white sheaves mottled against coke-bottle colored
ice floes rise up, a glistening wall of glacial plates
surrounding the thin ribbon of road.
Speed enters the first series of caves bored through
earth and ice, a stroboscopic oscillation of light and
dark, ads and no ads as---
The memory of watching Rex disappear down the throat of
one of these caves haunts him.
KATSU
Speed?! What are you doing?
SPEED
Sorry.
RACER X
Are you all right?
SPEED
I'm fine.
Ahead, the HydroCell team grows from small silhouettes
flashing in and out of sight,. closer and closer, larger
and larger until--
once more the three chase cars lock onto their rear
bumper.
The open maw swallows the segmented train of cars, each
one slipping down into an underworld--
122.
CONTINUED:
Where there is no purchase for advertisements--
Only the cold, wet darkness where white lights chase
after red ones.
Speed tries to shake his fear when X calls for the
attack.
RACER X
Now.
The cars split apart, Racer X leading the charge as--
Sparks flash as with the cross of swords, metal striking
metal and--
The ice-crusted walls sparkle with star-bursts of
VIOLENCE--
The cacophony ringing through the first bending curve.
It is obvious that the conditions are much more
difficult, a sword fight on a frozen lake--
Each of the drivers, skidding, wobbling, drifting farther
then they anticipated, but--
The Okamoto team are just too good, eliminating one and
then the other HydroCell cars until--
Speed again has Snake in his sights.
This time, though, Snake is ready.
SNAKE
Not this time, punk!
He throws the lever and beneath his car--
A violent spray of freezing gas immediately skim coats
the road with a fresh shimmering glaze of ice that---
Speed hits going full throttle, immediately spinning
wildly out of control.
He screams trying to hold on as he spits out the end of
the cave--
Smashing through the rail, separating from the earth--
Hanging for a moment against the soundlessness of the
open sky--
Before dropping like a stone.
123.
CONTINUED: (2)
RACER X
Speed!
Speed falls and from inside the cockpit it looks
impossibly far to the bottom but--
The wall of the cliff is not completely vertical and the
Mach-5 begins to rub against the ice.
Speed reacts immediately, hitting one of the control
buttons and--
Crampons shoot out of his tires, giving him just enough
of a hold to try--
A split-jack jump, the front jacks firing, throwing the
car into a somersault across the open ravine--
Slamming against the far side which has slightly more
slope, allowing the crampons to dig in as--
He drive straight up the wall of ice.
TNT. BLIMP.
JOHNNY
He did.not! He did not just do
that!
C.C. ANNOUNCER
Speed Racer is. driving straight up
a cliff face--are we getting this?

CONTINUED:
JOHNNY
This kid is unbelievable!
Speed jumps again, vaulting violently back into the
winding road just behind a disbelieving Snake.
SPEED
Hi. Remember me?
Speed roars up after him and Snake grabs for his lever
again but now it's Speed that's ready--
Jumping over the ice, he body slams Snake, sending him
hard into the rail as Speed shoots into the lead.
SNAKE
Not again! Not again!
He grabs at an ankle holster, yanking out a gun.
Speed doesn't notice until it seems his entire family
screams into his ear--
FAMILY
GUN!
Snakes fires just as--
Speed hits the cockpit bubble and the bullets smack
against it like a sledgehammer into a brick wall.
125.
CONTINUED:
He swerves knowing he won't be able to take many hits as
Snake chases after him, firing as--
Speed hits the crampons again and runs up the side of the
mountain then--
Flips off the wall just as the cliff face drops off,
switching sides as--
Snake now finds himself on the outside as Speed bashes
him out through the guard rail.
Snake tries a similar move to Speed but Snake is no Speed-
And his car bursts apart as he miss-times the flip,
sending a bouncing cocoon to the distant snows below.
The cars weave through the Byzantine streets of San
Bartimeaus.
C.C. ANNOUNCER
-- And victory!
The checkered flag comes down, hundreds of flashbulbs
capturing the moment as Katsu leads Speed and Racer X
across the finish line.
Katsu poses with Speed and Racer X for photographers.
Racer X is clearly not interested.
KATSU
We make a good team.
RACER X
We did our part. Make sure you do
yours.
Racer X stares at Katsu whose face is as expressionless
as a mask but it feels as though Racer X can see right
through it.
KATSU
Of course.
REPORTER 2
Speed, does this mean you've
signed with Okamoto?
SPEED
Uh, no. This was... a mutually
beneficial opportunity.
KATSU
Yes, well put.
127.
CONTINUED:
REPORTER 3
Katsu, does this mean you will be
running in the Grand Prix this
weekend?
KATSU
We'll see. Right now I'm just
going to enjoy this victory.
Without the lights or banners or crowds, the race track
echoes with the same quiet portance as a cathedral. It
is here that Speed has always found himself.
But as he sails through neck snapping turns with reckless
abandon, it becomes clear that he is chasing something
that he has lost.
He seems ready to cry for all the frustration and anger,
wanting so badly to undo the last few weeks of his life.
Suddenly in his rearview mirror there is an answer to his
prayer, a miracle--
His brother.
129.
CONTINUED:
For a moment he believes that he is again driving beside
the ghost of his brother but when the two cars kiss up
against each other, Speed realizes this is no ghost--
It's Racer X.
The masked Racer suddenly becomes the focus of all his
anger and Speed swings his car, wielding it like a club,
trying to clobber him.
Racer X dodges the first blow and swings back, the two have
at one another, banging, shoving one another into the wall--
Until Speed can't take it anymore and he goes at X as
ferociously as he can, throwing him into a tailspin--
Crashing him into one of the grand stands.
Silence embraces the track.
Speed climbs out of the Mach 5.
SPEED
X? Racer X?
There is a small movement in the car, a shuddering as
though in pain and Speed realizes he may have gone too
far.
SPEED (CONT'D)
Racer X?!!
He runs to the car but immediately stops when he realizes
the masked man is not in pan; he is laughing. He
practically falls out of his car.
RACER X
Jeezus, kid. You can drive. I
haven't been thrown like that in
years.
SPEED
What are you doing here?
RACER X
The inspector told me what
happened., I came looking for you.
SPEED
Why?
RACER X
Thought you'd take it hard and
maybe do something stupid.
130.
CONTINUED: (2)
SPEED
Why would you care?
RACER X
Because you're a fighter. And a
friend.
SPEED
Why don't you just tell me the
truth?
Racer X stares at him hard.
SPEED (CONT'D)
You're Rex, aren't you?
RACER X
You mean your brother?

After a long hard moment, Racer X pulls off his
He is not Rex. Speed is stunned.
SPEED (CONT'D)
You're... not Rex.
RACER X
No. I'm sorry Speed but your
brother is dead.
He pulls his mask back on.
SPEED
I'm sorry.
RACER X
Don't be. I'm sure where ever
your brother is, he is immensely
proud of you.
SPEED
For what? Making the same
mistakes he did?
131.
CONTINUED: (3)
RACER X
For trying to make a difference.
From what I've read, that's all he
tried to do.
SPEED
And what good did it do? He got
killed for nothing. Racing hasn't
changed and it never will!
RACER X
It doesn't matter if racing never
changes. What matters is if we
let racing change us. Everyone of
us has to find the reason to do
this. You don't climb into a T-
180 to be a driver. You do it
because you're driven.
SPEED
I don't know why I'm doing it
anymore.
RACER X
That's obvious. At Fuji, you were
trying to prove something. At
Cristo, you were looking for
justice. Neither are the reason
you belong behind a steering
wheel.
SPEED
If you know so much, why don't you
tell me why I should keep driving?
RACER X
Sorry. That's for you to figure
out.
He climbs back into his car.
RACER X (CONT'D)
I just hope when you do, I'm there.
to see it.
He roars away leaving Speed alone.
Nothing we've seen compares to the staggering scope of
this track. It feels like an entire city; grand stands
rising up like can-opened sky scrapers surrounded by
clover leafs of track that seem like origami folded
highways.
Preparations are well under way, ads being positioned,
lights being checked, make-up being applied to Ben Burns
and his announcing partner, Cass Jones.
The crowds have already begun to arrive.
At the players entrance, fans swarm after Cannonball
Taylor who arrives in his gorgeous sports car.
Remmington stands ready to reveal the GRX.
REMMINGTON
Ladies and gentlemen, behold the
future.
It's black, shiny, and beautiful in a malefic way.
A large group of security officials are gathered, staring
at the invitation in Speed's hand.
One of them starts to shake his head when he hears--
INSPECTOR DETECTOR
Is there a problem here, officer?
TNT. GRAND PRIX PENTHOUSE
Remmington is in his element, everything seeming to go
exactly as planned until Gennie comes up behind him and
whispers in his ear.
GENNIE
Sir, we have a problem.
A name flashes on as the driver is added.
FEMALE ANNOUNCER VOICE
Now driving in the twentieth and
final position, Speed Racer.
The roar from the crowd shakes the windows of--
The Racer family finds their seats.
Floating camera blimps seem to hover everywhere including
right next to Speed--
Catching him unawares with a gaper's mouth.
The image of Speed looking overwhelmed is immediately
broadcast onto the jumbotrons eliciting a laugh from the
crowds.
Trixie sees Speed on the big screens.
TRIXIE
Look! There's Speed!
The gorgeous Prince Kabala struts for the crowd while a
team of beautiful female mechanics push his jewel
encrusted car into place.
He sees Speed helping Sparky push the Mach 5 into place.
PRINCE
Hey, mouth-breather, get used to
THIS--
He shows Speed his ass.
PRINCE (CONT'D)
'Cause that's what you're going to
be looking at all day!
Speed tries to ignore him and the other driver's staring
at him like a fox staring at a chicken.
SPARKY
Howya feelin'?
Speed takes a breath as he dares to look around again.
SPEED
.it's big.
SPARKY
Hey, this cockpit is the exact
same size it was at Thunderhead.
SPEED
Right.
SPARKY
Just wanted to say, thanks, for
what could be the most exciting
moment of my life.
SPEED
Couldn't have gotten here without
you.
He hugs him.
149.
CONTINUED:
SPARKY
I'm looking forward to that cold
milk.
SPEED
Me too.
Speed climbs in as the speaker system blares--
FEMALE ANNOUNCER VOICE
Ladies and gentlemen, start your
engines.
The engines erupt, crashing against the waves of the
roaring crowd but--
Inside the Mach 5 everything goes completely silent.
Nothing exists now for Speed except the track as he loses
all separation between himself and his car.
He takes a deep breath and closes his eyes as the
countdown begins.
Again we cut to the many varied expressions of
anticipation: Trixie, Mushi, Okamoto, Sprittle, and Chim-
chim, Katsu and Horuko, Mom and Pops, Remmington and
Racer X who no longer has any socks, until--
The gun sounds--
The cars become bullets hurdled forward, except for the
car in front of Speed which barely moves blocking his
PATH--
He tries to avoid it but can't, rear-ending him while the
car behind him slams into the back of the Mach 5.
150.
A car to the side swerves aiming straight at Speed who
manages at the last second a slip-jack jump--
Flipping over the car as it slams into the pile-up while--
Speed guns his engine in the air so that when he hits the
track there is a scream of burning rubber and the Mach 5
rockets out of the start to the cheering crowd.
The first lap of the Grand Prix is Ben Hur brutal as car
after car takes a shot at Speed but--
He uses their aggressiveness throwing them into each other--
Littering the track with flaming debris and bouncing
cocoons.
Speed executes another beautiful maneuver sending Gearbox
crashing into Boom-Boom--
Both cars going boom-boom, their rubber cocoons bouncing
free.
The Prince tries to sight the Ghost in his mirrors but
the Gray Ghost seems to vanish.
GRAY GHOST
Where am I? Where am I? I'm
here. I am over there. I'm
Savior Faire!
The Prince tries to block the Ghost but he can't seem to
locate him.
GRAY GHOST (CONT'D)
I'm everywhere, baby!
Wham! The Ghost is on him, pouncing, slipping into what
feels like a shoulder throw that sends the Prince
spinning out of control onto the onrushing Nitro--
Shattering the Prince's car like a mis-struck diamond
reduced in one hammer stroke to twinkling dust.
152.
CONTINUED:
The two more cocoons bounce onto the road as the other
cars roar past.
The cars head over as though falling off the end of
Niagara and while other drivers cling to their steering
wheels just trying to hang on--
Speed presses the accelerator, making his move--
Banking higher than anyone up the big wall and when he
dives back down there are only three cars left ahead of
HIM--
The green Mushi motors car, the Gray Ghost, and the Black
GRX.
Speed makes a move and Cannonball blocks, but it is
clumsy and Speed quickly counters--
Bouncing Cannonball into the wall.
SPEED
Come on! Is that it?
He swerves back and the two cars begin to battle but it
is immediately clear who is the better driver, as--
Speed throws Cannonball from one side of the track to the
other.
TNT. GRAND PRIX ANNOUNCER'S BOOTH
CASS JONES
Cannonball Taylor is in trouble.
BEN BURNS
Tear `em up kid!
Sprittle understands immediately what is going on.
SPRITTLE
That cheater! He's using a spear
hook! SPEAR HOOK! SPEAR HOOK!
The surrounding crowd becomes uncomfortable.
POPS
Sprittle, we don't know that.
SPRITTLE
I do! Cannonball Taylor is
nothing but a big cheater!
155.
They exit the butterfly turn and head into the slalom,
both drivers fighting hard to force the other into the
onrushing concrete pylons.
The paint is scraped first from the outside of the Mach 5
and then the GRX as they barely avoid one pylon and then
another, neither car gaining an advantage until--
The Mach 5 begins to rattle, the stronger GRX taking
advantage as they head for the final pylon---
Where the camera that is broadcasting the two cars onto
the jumbo-tron is positioned.
At the last second, Speed hits the two outside jacks
causing both cars to rise up onto the two outside wheels
of the GRX--
Revealing the undercarriage and the hidden spear hook to
the camera.
The crowd gasps.
SPRITTLE
Told you so!
Chim-chim high fives him.
SPRITTLE (CONT'D)
Cheaters never prosper!
The Mach 5 flips down, pancaking the GRX, while the Mach
5 crashes free, leaving the exposed spear hook to hang
limply from the front of the GRX.

Speed tries to start the Mach 5. He hits the
the starter only grinds.
SPARKY
Oh no, come on, don't do this.
Pops watches through his binoculars.
POPS
Don't quit on us now baby.
Speed takes a deep breath and it seems the entire stadium
takes it with him. He closes his eyes and tries to
listen to the car.
SPEED
What do you need?
Something makes him put the car in second gear. He steps
on the accelerator, then hits the starter and---
And the Mach 5 roars to life.
The crowd screams to the wail of burning rubber.
The red socks flash as Speed stomps on it, jamming the
accelerator to the floor.
He's a half-lap behind the entire field but every eye in
the stadium is on the white and red streak of lightening
as it--
Thunders by, rattling the elaborate lace work of concrete
and steel--
Gaining, inch by inch, foot by foot.
Speed comes out of the spiral, glimpsing the back of the
trailers as they go over the Big Drop.
Where they ease over the edge, Speed hurls out, going
airborne, free-falling past two trailers, as--
The grade of the slope reaches up and gently eases the
Mach 5 back onto the track, to the delight of the crowd.
The Mach 5 surfs up the big bank, weaving through another
pair that try to stop him with spectacularly disastrous
results.
outside the Mach 5 a maelstrom of violent chaos churns
WHILE--
Inside, Speed is perfectly at pease.
Speed weaves through the butterfly cloverleaf, taking
each turn at such intense speeds that the cars he passes
seem to be moving in slow motion.
By the end of the slalom, he is back where he left off,
with two cars left ahead of him--
Mushi motors and the Gray Ghost.
GRAY GHOST
Welcome back kid. Been lonely up
here without you.
Pops' chest is out, tears running down to his moustache
as he wraps his arms around Mom, who goes to pieces as
Chim-chim and Sprittle leap up and down, hugging Trixie
AS--
The crowd storms over the barriers, swarming Speed and
the Mach 5.
161.
The crowd lifts Speed up onto their shoulders as we
collage-pan to--
Several of the other driver's led by the Gray Ghost
applaud and salute Speed as--
The Racer family is led through the swarm of
photographers and fans.
TRIXIE
Speed!
She pushes towards him and he sweeps her up into his arms
and kisses her, surrounded by the sparkle of camera flash
AS---
Sprittle covers Chim-chim's eyes.
SPRITTLE
Danger. May cause cookies.
Mom and Pops both hug Speed, their eyes bright with joy
AS--
We rise up, up, and away.
Roll snazzy credits.
