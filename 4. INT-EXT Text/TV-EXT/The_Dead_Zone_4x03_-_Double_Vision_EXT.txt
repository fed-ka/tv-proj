          STREET - DAY)

          Milk, laundry, lightbulbs, etc.  Somebody's having a big
          day.  The VIEW WIDENS TO REVEAL:


          JOHNNY

          crossing items off his to-do list, his scrap of paper
          braced against the steering wheel as he drives.

                                        JOHNNY
                          I need... light bulbs... razor
                          blades... stamps...

          Johnny rolls to a stop at the light.


          AT THE LIGHT

          A hot little car pulls up alongside at the light.  The
          WOMAN behind the wheel makes brief eye contact with Johnny. 
            Striking, late twenties, there's something about her. 
          Johnny smiles politely.  She smiles back.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (to himself)
                          I definitely need one of those.

          Just when Johnny thinks he might have a little thing going
          here, her expression changes as she reacts to something
          beyond Johnny, a flash of concern crossing her face. 

                                        JOHNNY
                          Something I said?!

          The light changes and he starts forward into the
            intersection, when suddenly...


          BAM! A PEDESTRIAN

          Comes flying out of nowhere, running against the light,
            careening off Johnny's right front bumper.  The guy hits
          hard, a heavy gym bag absorbing the impact.  Johnny hops
          out to check on the guy, but he's already hurrying away.

                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "DOUBLE VISION" - TEASER - 3/1/05 - YELLOW  2.


    1CONTINUED:1

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey!  You okay?!  WAIT!

          The woman guns it, cutting Johnny off as she blows through
          the intersection.  We don't know it yet, but she's
            following that guy.

          Johnny watches both of them vanish into traffic, wondering
          if the whole world's gone mad. 



          Johnny pulls into a space and gets out.  He walks around
          his car to inspect the area the pedestrian bounced off
          of, discovering a small crease in the fender.  Curious,
          he reaches out and touches the dent, triggering:



            A multistory office building surrounded by other tall
          buildings.  Johnny stands in front, turning in a slow
          circle, trying to determine where the gunman might be as
          he talks to Walt on the phone.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm standing out in front of the
                          building as we speak.  It's a
                        little creepy.



          Looking up from the scope, a single eye betraying surprise.



          Walt drops Johnny off back at his car.

                                        WALT
                        I'll start the ball rolling, see
                        if I can find a connection between
                        the Insurance agent and this
                        mystery doctor.  I'll call you
                        later. 

                                        JOHNNY
                                  (distracted, troubled)
                        Right.

          A BEE is buzzing Johnny.  He swats at it absentmindedly.

          Walt drives off.

                                        JOHNNY
                        ...damn bees.


  1919P.O.V. - SOMEBODY WATCHING JOHNNY

          As Walt drives away.  The perspective WIDENS TO REVEAL,
          Alex, watching Johnny discretely from a distance.






                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "DOUBLE VISION" - ACT ONE - 3/1/05 - YELLOW  12.

          She's got a blackberry, as she keeps an eye on Johnny.



          Unaware that he's being watched, he reaches the driver's
          side door and opens it, triggering:


  2121VISION: HIS CAR - MOMENTS BEFORE

          ALEX is here, looking in the window of his car, snooping
          around.  Hearing people coming, she looks up, sees Johnny
          and Walt approaching in the distance, the VISION ENDS.



          Comes out of the vision, looking around -- SPOTS HER.


          ALEX

          Surprised, she ducks back out of sight.  Johnny starts to
          walk in her direction.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey!  I need to talk to you!

          Seeing him coming, she exits in a hurry.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (to himself)
                        Great, she's running again.

            Reluctantly, he takes off after her.


          SHORT FOOT CHASE

          Alex crosses a busy street.

          Johnny exits the structure behind her.

          Alex heads for a city bus.

          Johnny crosses the same busy street.

          Alex passes the bus, then hooking the bus stop sign pole
          swings herself into the bus just as the doors are closing.

          Johnny runs to catch the bus, but it pulls away.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "DOUBLE VISION" - ACT ONE - 3/1/05 - YELLOW  13.


    22CONTINUED:22

          Alex, watches him back, giving him a playful smile.  He's
          frustrated for a beat, then gets an idea, crossing the
          street to the bus stop.  He touches the bus stop pole she
          touched.  We hear a small WHOOSH.  A smile crosses Johnny's
          face.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Gotcha.



            Following Alex as she jumps off the bus and hails a cab
          going in another direction.



          As the cab rolls to a stop across the street.

                                        ALEX
                        Stop at the corner.

                                        CABBIE
                        Lady, you realize I just drove
                        you in a giant circle?

                                        ALEX
                        I know, wasn't it fun?  Keep the
                        change.

          She hands him a twenty.

                                        CABBIE
                        Yes, ma'am.  Anytime you want to
                        go nowhere, Marcel's your man!

          He drives off as Alex scans the area for any sign of
          Johnny, then heads toward the parking garage.



          Her on one side, him on the other.  Her thoughtful, him
          smug.  We see her hesitate -- does she sense Johnny's
            presence?

          A silent beat passes.  Johnny starts to get worried when
          she doesn't come through the door like he saw.  He steps
          up to the door, carefully touching it.  In the split screen
          we see them on both sides of the door, frozen, "listening".



          Where the bees rise away from him, regrouping into a dense
          swarm before moving off away from Johnny.

          Johnny follows the swarm across the field, watching in
          horror as it descends on a NINE-YEAR-OLD GIRL.  She runs,
          but the bees overtake her, suffocating her like some kind
          of formless dark spirit.

                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "DOUBLE VISION" - ACT ONE - 3/1/05 - YELLOW  16.


    34CONTINUED:34

          The girl stares up at the sky.  Johnny steps toward her
          as the BEES RISE UP AGAIN, swarming Johnny as THE VISION
          ENDS.



          Johnny checks the valet stub before heading into the hotel.



          Johnny and Alex walk along the sidewalk.

                                        ALEX
                        Thanks for picking up the check.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's the least I could do,
                          considering you made reservations.

          Johnny notices a bee in front of him and swipes at it.

                                        ALEX
                        What's wrong?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Bees.

                                        ALEX
                        Bees?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I keep seeing them everywhere.

                        You look like you're going to

                        In the parking garage.  I had a
                        vision of a little girl... she
                        was attacked by a swarm of bees... 
                                (realizes)

                        I was seven.  Stung over ninety
                        percent of my body.  I went into
                          anaphylactic shock.  Since then
                        I'm hyper-allergic.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's pretty serious.

                                        ALEX
                        Not if you carry this...

          She pulls an epi pen out of her coat pocket.

                                        ALEX
                        When I first went into shock, my
                        heart stopped, before they revived
                        me. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's when you started seeing
                        things differently?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't know, let's find out.

          She smiles as they continue walking up the walk...



          Johnny and Walt stride toward the hospital, both of them
          scanning their surroundings.

                                        WALT
                        The insurance agent from this
                        morning handles all the claims
                        from this hospital.

                                        JOHNNY
                        So?

                                        WALT
                        So, maybe there's a connection
                        between him and the doctor from
                        your vision.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I wish Alex was here.

                                        WALT
                        So she really is a psychic?

                                        JOHNNY
                        You seem disappointed?

                                        WALT
                        It's hard enough getting my head
                        wrapped around one know-it-all. 
                        I'm not sure I can handle two of
                        ya.  Where do think she went?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't know, but she was scared
                        of something.  Something she saw
                        about me.



          An intense looking SEVEN-YEAR-OLD BOY with soulful eyes
          walks bravely across the parking lot, holding someone's
          hand as he leads them toward the entrance.  It's the boy
          from Alex's vision.  The VIEW WIDENS TO REVEAL: Alex,
          holding the boy's hand, wide-eyed as she's led inside the
            hospital.



          Alex leans up against the outside of Walt's patrol car,
          her eyes shut, exhausted.  She wakes up as Johnny
          approaches, pulling two cups from a paper bag.

                                        JOHNNY
                        We're heading over to the mother's
                        house.

                                        ALEX
                        That's not going to be fun.

          A look passes between them.  It's not often they meet
          somebody who knows what this is like.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Why did you take off?  It was me,
                        wasn't it?

                                        ALEX
                        The vision of my death, I've seen
                        it nearly every day since I was a
                        little girl.
                              (a beat)
                        In the vision, there's always
                          somebody trying to help me,
                          somebody I could never quite see...
                        until today.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You think I'm going to be there
                        when you die?

                                        ALEX
                        You always have been, I just didn't
                        know it was you.

                        I've tried everything I could
                        think of to keep myself from being
                        under that particular blue sky. 
                        And after all that running, here
                        I am with you.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe you should keep running.

                                        ALEX
                          Something tells me it isn't going
                        to be that easy.



          Walt's patrol car is parked in front of the Munroe house.

                                        WALT (V.O.)
                        We know this is hard for you,
                        Mrs. Munroe.  But if there's
                          anything you can remember?



          Johnny, Alex, and Walt walk towards the church.

                                        ALEX
                        Some kind of service going on.

                                        JOHNNY
                        There's the priest.


          THEIR POV - THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR

          Father Andrew at the altar, leading a prayer Mass.


          ALEX

          Captivated by something she sees at the back of the church.



          Charlie stands in the doorway of the church, beckoning
          her with his silent presence.


          CONTINUOUS - SOME VISIONS MIXED WITH REALITY

          Johnny notices Alex watching something.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What is it?

                                        ALEX
                        Charlie is here.

          Walt looks, but of course nothing is there.  Alex begins
          walking toward the back door.  Johnny stops her.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Alex wait... If Charlie's here,
                        his father must be here, too.

                                        WALT
                        I'll call for backup.  You two
                        stay here.

          Walt heads back towards his car.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "DOUBLE VISION" - ACT FOUR - 3/1/05 - YELLOW  45.

          Alex looks to the back door, where little Charlie beckons
          her with his sad eyes, then turns, disappearing into the
          church.

                                        ALEX
                        He wants me to follow him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You can't go in there.  We don't
                        know where Frank might be.

          Moved by his concern, Alex turns to Johnny and touches
          his face reassuringly.

                                        ALEX
                        I'll be okay... I've seen the
                        end...
                                (then looking up)
                        ... and it's not like this.

          Johnny follows her look up to the Canadian-gray sky and
            understands.



          Johnny and Alex walk out of the Emergency Room exit and
          head for her car, Alex almost fully recovered by now.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sure you're going to be okay?

                                        ALEX
                        The sun is shining, the birds are
                        singing...

          She notices a parking ticket on the windshield of her car
          and picks it up.

                                        ALEX
                        And I got a parking ticket.  What
                        more could a girl ask for?

          They share a smile.  It's awkward.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I wish you'd reconsider and stick
                        around for a few days.

                                        ALEX
                        I would... but a funny thing
                          happened on the way to my death. 
                          Somebody gave me back the rest of
                        my life.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I guess you'll just have to go
                        live it then.

                                        ALEX
                        Yea, I guess so.

          Another awkward BEAT, then...

                                        ALEX
                        Look, I'm not very comfortable at
                        good-byes.  Usually, I just take
                        off before things get too deep.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Is that what this is... too deep?

          They lean in like they're going to kiss, but both hesitate --
          apparently wary of touching again.

                        Who needs the grief?

          They retreat back into their own personal space, then at
          the same time they grab each other and kiss.  When they
          finally break, they seem to each take an individual
            inventory of themselves...

          Now it's time for the truth.

                          Absolutely.  How could two people
                        that can see everything about
                        each other ever hope to keep a
                          relationship fresh and new?

                        There would be no surprises.

                        Nobody could make that work.

          There's another lull, then...

                        It might be fun trying, though.

          Alex's expression says it all.

                        everything she could do and the
                        rest was up to God.

          She smiles in agreement, studying Johnny one last time.

                                        ALEX
                        You aren't what I expected.

                        Back at ya.

          And off she drives.  The SHOT PULLS HIGH AND WIDE as Johnny
          walks off alone, his fate and those of countless others
          still resting firmly on his shoulders.
