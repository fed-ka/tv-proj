Archie and Petulia start up ramp.
It's a long dark run and they are soon winded,
ARCHIE
(GASPING)
CHARMING
PETULIA
(GASPING)
It shouldn't be charming. You're missing
the whole point. It should be menacing .,,
Another couple in a proper car, rushes by. There is
a blaze of headlights, and a rush of sound.
PETULIA
,..gray . terribly distraught
headlights of passing cars lighting up our
room .,.
Archie tugs at her, and gasps.

PETULIA
(CONTINUING)
... a police car careening down the highway,
sirens going full blast. And I plunge
madly into your arms
But she is now totally winded and cannot say another
word. Archie reacts to a sudden phenomena: a tiny
light on the key in his hand starts flicking on and off
furiously. Just ahead of him is the door of their motel
room. Archie is aghast at the pulsating key.
ARCHIE
(PLAINTIVELY)
My apartment's only four blocks from
HERE
Stark is hardly the word but it will have to do. A
control panel takes care of the drapes, T.V., stereo,
announcements from the office, etc., etc., etc. There
are mirrors everywhere and the first thing Petulia
does is establish contact between the vanity mirror,
the mirror on the bathroom door and the medicine cabinet
mirror so that she is reflected endlessly.
PETULIA
You have 624 women in this room and
I'm still counting.
Archie moves behind her and begins unbuttoning the top
buttons on the back of her dress.
PETULIA
(HARSHLY)
Just wait a minute, okay?
Archie plops on the bed in his coat, a most iropic smile
on his face -- he is beginning to suspect he is not
going to get laid. Petulia is examining all the Petulia
faces in the mirrors.
PETULIA
My great-grandmother is ninety-one and
still has a granite chin.
Archie pushes a gadget beside the bed and it begins to
vibrate. Petulia sees endless Archies vibrating on
endless beds.
12
7 CONTINUED
PETULIA
What a lecherous lot
ARCHIE
She's ninety-ones eh?
PETULIA
But no fun.
ARCHIE
Not at ninety-one, hell
PETULIA
She stopped having fun at twenty-eight when her
husband was killed in the first war, in a
trench looking just like Cary Grant with a
waxed moustache. She can't remember him but
she does remember Cary Grant because he is
from Bristol, too, and often in the news. If
his picture is in the paper he gets a waxed
moustache whether he likes it or not.
She turns to face Archie. She is afraid and she is
angry and she doesn-t know quite what to do from one
moment to the next. But she knows he shouldn't be in an
overcoat jiggling on a jiggling bed,

PETULIA
Stop being so damn casual.
Archie sits up but is still casual,
PETULIA
We're about td become lovers, Did you bring
an instrument, Archie?
ARCHIE
Eh?
PETULIA
Ring for room service. Ask the robot for
something splendid and musical,,
ARCHIE
Saxophone? Electric Organ? Tuba?
PETULIA
A tuba. Absolutely; Bless you, Ar--hie; A
tuba; Something large and twirly and pom
to pom .pomX Archie, this is an event. We
0 are about to become lovers.
7 CONTINUED
ARCHIE
You said that.
PETULIA
It can't be said often enough.
ARCHIE
Are we?
PETULIA
Are we what?
ARCHIE
About to become lovers?
PETULIA
No.
ARCHIE
Ah, you swinging young marrieds.
He leaves.
The elevator doors shut and inside the elevator a
loud speaker begins playing a medley of San Francisco
songs.
PETULIA
You. look like a gargoyle. Poor, dumb Archie.
I'm all mixed up sexually. Old Mum's a
prostitute. The oldest professional lady in
0 all Bristol. Mavis, too, my sister. But
I mean she's not a landmark yet.
9 CONTINUED
During this Archie notices that the back of Petulia's
dress remains unbuttoned. He moves behind her and
begins rebuttoning her. At the touch of his hand,
something happens to Petulia.
Archie's hands are holding a little boy under the bright
lights of a first aid table. The boy is a bloody mess but
Archie's hands are soothing him even as they so gently
prod, examining his injuries. Nurses are cutting the boy's
bloody jeans off him, an expensive watch falls to the
floor, they retrieve it.
Petulia's head presses against Archie's hand. She
kisses it, she rubs her cheek against it.
The elevator has come to a stop and the doors have opened.
Archie sees Petulia's tears on his hand.
ARCHIE
Real honest-to-God tears, Petulia?
PETULIA
Tears, Archie.
0
ARCHIE
Petulia, you're a kook.
He exits the elevator and whistles at a cruising cab.
Archie is sleeping. There is the SOUND of a bell
ringing. After awhile Archie's hand reaches out for
the phone.
ARCHIE
(into phone)
I'm up, thanks.
Then his dizzy brain realizes the ringing is continuing
and is constant. He sees the alarm clock, 6:1 He
stumbles and staggers to the front door.
ARCHIE
Yeah... yeah 000 yeah 000
He opens the door to come face to face with the large
and twirly front end of a tuba. The tuba is stark
white for no particular reason.
Dazedly,.Archie steps back to make room for Petulia
and the tuba.
ARC HIE
I'll make some coffee.
Petulia blows with all her strength, emitting a sad
little peep, then collapses to the floor, tuba and all.

14B Continued
PETULIA
Aren't I a kook? If you think you're
SURPRISED
ARCHIE
(at the same time)
No, I've been up for hours, waiting for
the doorbell to ring,
PETULIA
, 0 think how surprised the-man who owns
the pawnshop is going to be when he sees
all that broken glass.
0 The scene continues.
PETULIA
Wherets it all going to end if the
burglar alarms won't go off? Take me
to bed, Archie,
ARCHIE
Get the hell out of here . please.
He reaches to help Petulia to her feet but as he touches
her waist to lift her, she screams and faints,
But we don't know it's the Danner house. All we see is
Petulia crumpling as she is struck. She hits the floor
and just lies there, not making a sound.
(Also SHOOT in slow motion.)
Archie breaks an ammonia ampule under Petulia's nose.
Her head wrenches away and she opens her eyes. Archie
has begun to prod her side; she is in pain.
17
16 CONTINUED
PETULIA
I've got a broken rib, I think, I can
feel it broken, Archie.
ARCHIE
Don't you know you can puncture a lunge
PETULIA
Hopping around with tubas and stuff --
isntt it kooky, though?
Archie has begun to remove her dress.
PETULIA
When are we going to stop trying to
undress me?
ARCHIE
Shut up.
PETULIA
Leave me alone, Archie.
Archie sees she really means it,
ARCHIE
0
It's just a rib to me,
PETULIA
That's why. Call a proper doctor,
ARCHIE
What do you think I am?
PETULIA
A hairy legged old lecher running around
in pajama bottoms,
ARCHIE
Get your clothes off,
PETULIA
As a woman, not as a rib.
Archie is harassed. The phone begins ringing. He grabs
it angrily.
ARCHIE
(into phone)
I'm awake! I'm awake; How many times
are you gonna call?I
He hangs up, then realizes this was the first wake up call.
18
16 CONTINUED
E ARCHIE
(to Petulia)
You know what a- you'll drive me cuckoo.
He sighs. and begins dialing a number. Petulia is in real
pain. Like a,little child she crawls under the covers of
his bed, pulling the quilt up around her as though Archie's
left over warmth will make the pain go away.
ARCHIE
(into phone)
Barney? Archie. Fine fine , , fine ,
I want you to look at a patient for me.
Now. At my place. My apartment, Barney,
it's very complicated and I haven't had
my morning coffee yet. Her name is Petulia.
I don't know her last name, Barney. Yes,
Petulia. Barney, shut up. I have to get
to the hospital.
16A BARNEY'S BEDROOM MORNING
During the above we catch a glimpse of sleepy Barney
sleepily asking stupid questions.
Archie hangs up, goes to a medicine case which he had
hastily opened for the ammonia ampule and now he takes out
a couple of pills, which he gives to Petulia,. She takes
them obediently,
PETULIA
You've got a super build for a man your age.
Archie says nothing. He crosses to the bathroom and
hastily begins dressing.
PETULIA
Where are all the family pictures?
Archie is busy brushing his teeth,
PETULIA
(LOUDLY)
The family pictures!
He looks out from the bathroom blankly,
PETULIA
Polo and the boys.

Archie goes back to brushing his teeth electrically, with
salt.
19
16B Continued
 PETULIA
I'll bet you named her Polo. Don't ever
start mucking about with "Petulia".
Archie exits from the bathroom, all the time continuing
to dress,
PETULIA
Whats her real name?
ARCHIE
Prudence.
PETULIA
And you named her Polo. That's kind
of sickening, Archie.
Archie stops his dressing long enough to gaze at this girl
in his bed, beyond which is an overturned tuba. Archie
sighs somewhat philosophically, not nearly as amused as
you'd think.
We are in the examining room of the orthopedic ward.
Archie is working on Oliver, the little Mexican boy of

seven whom we have seen earlier as a bloody mess in the
flashback. Now, Oliver is healing nicely, but it's still
not pleasant to be examined. A woman hovers in the back-
ground. A nurse assists Archie. Oliver is a brave, solemn
little boy, with shadows of fatigue around his eyes. He
is also a tough little bastard, let me tell you. He is
now wearing the broken gold watch; though to fit his
skinny wrist the band has been tied in a knot,
ARCHIE
I want him here every day. For therapy.
WOMAN
Si, Yes, doctor. I do,
Oliver speaks only a few words of English, mostly the
necessary scatological and sexual phrases that would be
necessary in his line of business.
ARCHIE
Every day. Tell him that.
The woman says it to Oliver in Spanish. Oliver says
something obviously obscene.
20
17 CONTINUED
ARCHIE
What'd he say?
WOMAN
(EMBARRASSED)
He say yes.
ARCHIE
(dubiously, to woman)
You sure?
(to Oliver)
Otherwise we keep you in the hospital.
You're not well, just better.
(to woman)
Say that.
The woman tells Oliver in Spanish as Archie continues
examining the leg.
ARCHIE
Sorry, pal.
Oliver says something in Spanish.
WOMAN:
(smiling a bit)

Where he learn such words shame on you.
(then in Spanish)
Shame.
Archie realizes Oliver is in great pain and close to tears.
He stops the examination and rubs his hand gently through
the kid's hair,
ARCHIE
Every day. Same time. Two o'clock,
right on the dot.
(he hits watch on wrist.
The last bit of glass falls
out.)
Sorry , ,
Oliver swears in Spanish and the woman clacks her tongue.
WOMAN
(EMBARRASSED)
He terrible.
ARCHIE
(CHUCKLING)
I like the way he heals.

Archie smiles and leaves. The nurse is left with Oliver
who avoids her touch,
NURSE
Cut that out, you little spit,
18 TNT. CORRIDOR
Archie stops to hear what the woman has to say.
WOMAN
About the bill, Doctor.
Barney is passing by.
ARCHIE
Is she okay?
BARNEY
(DARKLY)
Lunch.
Archie looks up at the woman.
 ARCHIE
His leg will be fine. Don't worry too
much about the bill. Just enough to pay it.
WOMAN
I have money to pay it,
A pipe smoking public relations man leads a casually
dressed group past Archie and the woman.
PUBLIC RELATIONS MAN
Yea, we had ABC filming a documentary
here last week
All through the scene Barney and Archie will be served by
topless waitresses while other topless waitresses slide
down a big brass pole in the centre of the room. As the
scene begins Barney is alone, morosely munching a corned
beef sandwich. Now Archie appears, threading his way
through topless fashion show. A topless ANNOUNCER is
doing the fashion commentary into a chrome microphone,
as the topless models majestically move about.

ANNOUNCER
(no fashion cliche untouched)
Springtime in Paree. Our elegante dinner
pajamas. In airy aquamarine chiffon and
Mediterranean blue peau de soie.
Delightfully carefree, yet formal enough
for an ambassadorial reception at the
Palace of Versailles.
BARNEY
"Screw you, Wilma." Why didn't you tell
me?
ARCHIE
How is she?
BARNEY
You tell me.
ARCHIE
Oh, great, terrific, you wouldn't
believe it. Terrific. And her rib?
BARNEY
I taped it. Gave her some seconal.
 Should have a vertical just to be safe.
A waitress hovers
ARCHIE
Why do we have to eat topless?
BARNEY
The best Irish stew in town.
He is eating a corned beef sandwich. Archie is ordering
the same.
BARNEY
She said you beat her up. Kidding,
of course.
Archie bites into his sandwich with small enthusiasm.
Breasts with their pasties always intrude.
BARNEY
You must have been a little rough on her,
daddy.

The second model, a beautiful topless Negress, is now
wandering past the tables. The announcer goes on and on.
ANNOUNCER
Opening Night at the Opera. Though the
curtain has risen on the first act of
Aida, all eyes are on the Royal Box,
Mi Lady in dazzling velvet: Cardinal
Richelieu Rouge. The utter simplicity
of her full-length gown is subtly accented
by the merest suggestion of gay abandon.
Archie eats his sandwich. An off-duty topless waitress
sits in the corner having lunch, holding a napkin over
her bosom with one hand, while eating with the other.
BARNEY
Archie ?
ARCHIE
Barney ?
BARNEY
(UNEASILY)
You know how long I've known you?

ARCHIE
Forever?
BARNEY
That's how long. And Polo and the kids.
That's exactly how long.
Another silence. Archie is watching the brass pole.
Every other girl sliding down looks like Petulia. Archie
accepts his hallucination with mild pleasure. Barney
will not be stopped.
BARNEY'S VOICE
So I have a right to my opinion; It's
breaking Wilma's heart; That's all we
talk about. You think you're different
than anybody else? Every time I leave my
house it's the last time, I'm never coming
back. You're not listening to me, Archie.
ARCHIE'S VOICE
Barney, for Chrissake, I'm listening to you,
BARNEY'S VOICE
You're thinking about that hot cat in your
bed, you bastard.

Now, in the continuous luncheon fashion show, the
"Psychedelic Yvonne" has appeared, topless amid a wild
pattern of lights, The dialogue between Barney and Archie
continues elsewhere as the orgy of colors becomes:
The left side of a patient's face and the right shoulder
and arm of the patient's body are sprayed with a special
liquid which instantly dries a violent blue and then very
quickly starts changing into all the colors of the rainbow.
These various colors indicate physical conditions. They
are watched, measured, and timed by Archie, Barney and
their assistants,
BARNEY'S VOICE
My record is far from spotless, if you
don't know that, who does? But baby, it's
just not the answer, not at our age.
ARCHIE'S VOICE
So what's the answer, baby?
BARNEY'S VOICE
 Someplace you can belch without saying
excuse me!
ARCHIE'S VOICE
I can do that in the steam room at the YMCA.
BARNEY'S VOICE
(going right on)
And if a little monkey business comes along,
whose gonna throw rocks? You and Polo were
a marvellous looking couple.
The patient is in a lead room being scanned by an atomic
computer. The activator moves in a rhythmic, graceful
pattern over the patient's drab, withered body. In the
control area Archie and Barney listen to the strange sounds
emanating from the computer, each sound again indicating a
physical condition. The patient's room looks like a comfy
hotel room: wood paneling, couches, magazines, plants.
The door leading to outside is three inches thick and
solid lead. The noise from the equipment is deafening.

10 BARNEY'S VOICE
Is there something wrong with being a
groovy looking couple? People turning
around to stare? What was it, Archie?
The sex bit? Huh? The ole sex bit ,,,?
ARCHIE'S VOICE
Barney, what would you say if I told you
that one day I just got very tired of being
married?
This is a really glorified pressure chamber where a complete
atmosphere is created to suit whatever surgery is going on.
The patient can no longer be seen. He is draped in plastic
which creates a sub-atmosphere. The doctors and nurses
are swathed in plastic, again in the atmosphere that lets
them function best, (This is for real. It exists, for
instance, at Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York.) The doctors
and nurses communicate with each other through throat
mikes and seem like other world automatons. In all this
the patient simply does not exist. The colors are eerie
yellows and blues with only occasionally and very
impersonally the red of blood,

BARNEY'S VOICE
(he never listens)
It's still better than being out there in
the dark, all by your goddam lonesome!
Nobody has a life anymore. Quicksand,
It scares me. What do you want, Archie?
Archie and Barney are in a white cubicle playing handball.
Their dialogue, of course, continues,
ARCHIE
(GASPING)
I don't know what I want. To feel something,
BARNEY
(GASPING)
That's no answer; Archie, grow up!
The ball comes whizzing at Barney who suddenly wants it
to hit him, which it does,
BARNEY
Archie, what am I going to do about Wilma?

Petulia takes a seat at an open window. The bus is now
stopped for a moment more by the traffic light. Petulia,
under the best of circumstances doesn't make much sense,
and now she's quite groggy.
PETULIA
Will you remember that? "Friends of
the Evergreen."
ARCHIE
Petulia, where are you going?
PETULIA
Mr. Howard. Tell him I'm sorry I goofed.
Archie, you know something? The tuba
makes you look ten years younger, and
. you'know ... Thingy
0 The bus starts with a jolt and Petulia winces in pain.
28
Petulia is wincing with pain as she puts groceries on
the shelf. David is watching her, concerned.
DAVID
Petulia?
PETULIA
Hi.
DAVID
You okay?
PETULIA
Uh huh.
DAVID
Sure?
PETULIA
Of course.
DAVID
Just before ---
I
PETULIA
I'm fine.
DAVID
... for a split second there
PETULIA
Ism okay.
DAVID
I thought maybe you
PETULIA
David.
Somehow or other we begin to sense that madness has
entered what is really a commonplace scene. Something
has gone wrong and we can't for the life of us under-
stand what and before we can even guess, we are:
Petulia is still in the bus and we realize she has
0 imagined the foregoing. She gets off the bus.
29
IN A SLUM HOUSE DAY
Petulia is filling the noisy old electric ice box with
milk, ice cream and fresh fruit. A man enters from
another room. He is a big, sleepy-eyed Mexican. He
has just awakened, is wearing his pajama bottoms and
is hairy, sweaty and fat.
Petulia obviously knows tlleiman, nods hello, to which
the man answers a non-committal grunt. He squeezes
past Petulia to drink from the sink. He sticks his
head under the tap.
0
PETULIA
(she speaks slowly because he
doesn't understand English)
I came by to make sure there was enough
milk and things.
He finds the situation amusing, reaching in past Petulia
to grab an orange. There should be a feeling of a
possible relationship between Petulia and this man.
In the next room a screen door opens and closes.
Petulia closes the ice box door and we and she see
Oliver and the Woman standing in the doorway.
Archie is doing research at a desk. Working from notes,
he is talking into a tape recorder about new techniques
in the treatment of arthritis that would not require
surgery. This is a moment to glimpse Archie as a
thoughtful man. There are a couple of beer bottles
nearby. The bed is still unmade. The tuba stands
in the corner.

The front doorbell rings and Archie crosses over to
let in his wife, Polo, a very attractive young matron.
30

Polo looks about the apartment dubiously, from tuba to
unmade bed. She can't keep her eyes off the unmade bed.
ARCHIE
(after `awhile )
Hi, Polo.
POLO
It's very nice.
Archie looks at her questioningly.
POLO
I've never been here before.
It's very nice.
ARCHIE
Thanks.
POLO
It's strange, coming into your husband's
bachelor apartment for the first time.
Feels slightly illegal. Is that a tuba?
0
ARCHIE
That's a tuba.
POLO
Make a marvelous lamp.
ARCHIE
You just had to say it.
POLO
Predictable Polo.
ARCHIE
"Predictable Polo." Has a certain zing.
How're the kids?
POLO
Looking forward to the weekend.
Lest I forget
She opens her large handbag, takes out a cellophane bag
of cookies.
POLO
As usual, I baked enough for an army.
ARCHIE
Okay.
31
0 30 CONTINUED
POLO
This is very strange. I didntt think
I'd feel like this. Mostly sad.
Archie's sad, too, therefore he is more brusque than
necessary. Also he is bugged by the cookies.
ARCHIE
You need anything, Polo?
POLO
No. Well, yes. Well, yes and no.
ARCHIE
(SMILING)
I think that covers all the possibilities.
Polo laughs, suddenly they share a moment of warmth.
POLO
It's such a puzzle. We really got on
so marvelously. Never fought. Never
screamed at each other. Not once.
 Something in his silence, plus that damned unmade bed,
is beginning to make her angry.
POLO
Everybody we knew envied us.
ARCHIE
We were a handsome couple.
This makes her so angry she can now say what she came
to say.
POLO
I think I've fallen in love. The
man is Warren Smith. He's an engineer
and very good with the children, but he
wants to go back to school and get his
masters in hydraulics.
(very long pause)
Well, say something.
ARCHIE
(BLANDLY)
I think that's fine, Polo.
 POLO
(MILDLY)
Go to hell.

Tie phone begins ringing. Archie crosses to it.
ARCHIE

Hello?
' David is on the phone and Petulia'has just entered.
David hangs up the phone.
PETULIA
 DAVID
PETULIA
She stops. She waits for a moment, wondering if the
scene she imagined on the bus is now going to occur.
Will David now say, "Just for a second there .?"
DAVID
Come on, let's eat. Morrie finally
got a shipment of Dungeness crab.
PETULIA
About time.
DAVID
Well, poor guy. They had all that trouble.
David crosses to the dining area. And that's that.
POLO
Not right away. He's also divorced.
There's alimony ... child support
It looks absolutely obscene.

Archie sees her. looking at his bed.
ARCHIE
(ANNOYED)
So the kids like him, eh?
POLO
Adore him.
ARCHIE
How about that?
POLO
Don't you have maid service?
ARCHIE
(SUDDENLY)
What the hell are you doing, bringing
me cookies?
He flings the bag at her, barely missing her. They
are both stunned by this outburst,
'OLO
 (shakily)
Well ... this is a new side of your
natured For two people who never fight
Absently, Polo sags down on the edge of the unmade bed,
which has so fascinated her. During the following, no
matter what their bodies happen to be doing, Polo and
Archie continue to speak in a most logical manner.
ARCHIE
What's so great about not fighting?
POLO
I came to tell you about Warren,
ARCHIE
You told me about Warren.
He sits beside her, well not really beside her, actually
as far away from her as the bed will permit. She decides
she will instantly get up off the bed, but she does not.
ARCHIE
(CONTINUING)
Warren is working for his m'tstah's
in hydraulics.

0 32 CONTINUED
Polo knows she shouldn't smile at Archie making fun of
Warren, but she does. Archie touches her smile with his
finger, then his hand moves across her face, to the back
of her neck. It is a clumsy gesture and they clumsily
sprawl on the bed.
POLO
Well, I'm afraid well still need
all the money you pay me. And I'll
be seeing him, Archie
It's a nice enough room, which makes what she says
later quite absurd,'
She and Warren are preparing for bed m already in a
boring ritualistic fashion; she with curlers in her
hair, he hanging his trousers on a hanger,
POLO IS VOICE
, (continuing)
., at the house. I mean until Warren

and I get married, which won't be
By now, entirely out of habit, Archie's hand has
pushed up Polo's shirt, as he continues the sex ritual.
Wholly out of habit, Polo lets him. Their bodies, old
friends for so long, and once having been lovers,
simply ignore whatever tripe their mouths happen to
be saying,
POLO
(CONTINUING)
until he is established with some
hydraulics firma I hope it won't be
too long, I mean for everybody's sake.
ARCHIE
If he's a bright guy, he'll make out okay.
POLO
Needless to say there are certain problems.
By now, Archie is on top of Polo, and out of habit she
is adjusting her body for him.
35
32B Continued
POLO
He lives in such a depressing, rented
room. It gives me claustrophobia.
ARCHIE
Poor Polo.
POLO
It's such an icky little room.
Archie is, perhaps, two seconds away from entering Polo,
when he suddenly sits up, wondering what the hell he's
been doing. He walks to the far side of the room,
sticks his shirt in, wipes the sleeve of his shirt
across his face.
Polo feels no particular rancor, the entire thing was
totally unplanned, and she has no more desire to
"make it" with Archie than he has with her. She pulls
down her skirt and adjusts her garters.
ARCHIE
Tell the kids I'll come for them
0 Sunday at eight.
POLO
They'll be ready. I thought the
decent thing was to come here and
talk in a civilized manner. About
the change in my situation.
ARCHIE
I appreciate it, Polo.
POLO
Good night, Archie.
ARCHIE
You've got a run in your stocking.
Polo exits, Archie can't figure out why in the world
he even thought of making love to Polo after all this
time. He sits down on the unmade bed, finds one of
Polo's cookies on the sheets, and pops it into his
mouth.
Mr. Howard is casually testing the valves on the tuba.
MR . HOWARD
She said there was this elderly lady whose
first husband used to play tuba with John
Phillip Sousa. She said it would cheer
her up and make her want to live. She
gave me five bucks.
ARCHIE
(looking at Petulia)
All that broken glass
MR. HOWARD
(finished with the tuba)
Its okay.
Archie crosses to the front door and opens it.
ARCHIE
Goodbye, Mr. Howard. Goodbye, Petulia.
Petulia crosses to Mr. Howard and presses a dollar bill
into his shirt pocket.

PETULIA
Take a taxi. You can at least say
you're sorry, Archie.
ARCHIE
I'm sorry, Mr, Howard. Goodbye, Petulia.
But Petulia just sits on the edge of a chair tapping
her fingers in annoyance. Mr. Howard leaves. The door
remains open for Petulia to leave. May watches Petulia
in amused tolerance.
ARCHIE
What's the next move, Petulia?
PETULIA
I'd like to discuss your irresponsibility.
People are passing in the hallway, peering in.
ARCHIE
Goodbye, Petulia.
He advances on her, somewhat threateningly.

PETULIA
My rib.
Archie slams the door shut ets a bottle and a couple g

ARCHIE
I should explain about Petuliaa She is
a kook. We are going to be married.
PETULIA
Archie, when you try to sound cool and
"with it," you're really pathetic.
We're trying to have an intelligent
conversation...
ARCHIE
About what?
PETULIA
Well, about Polo, among other things.
ARCHIE
Polo is none of your damned business.
PETULIA
That's dumb. Dumb. She's my business
and she's this lady's business. I
happen to hate Polo.
ARCHIE
(to May)
Needless to say she's never even met Polo.
PETULIA
I look at you and I know Polo.
(to Map)
Explain that to him.
May looks at Archie in bewilderment, she is not quite sure
how to react; but when she makes up her mind it will be
the exactly right reaction. Also, in all truth, Petulia
is frightened by May.
PETULIA
How many years were you married., Archie?
Eight? Ten? Anyhow, the best, Wasted.
Gone down the drain.
ARCHIE
Oh, come on ..o
PETULIA
Archie, we are from two different worlds.
We've got nothing to agree on. Except one
thing. You're a lonely screwed up mess.
0 Archie, I'm trying to save you. You're
a very special man.
42
0 35 CONTINUED
ARCHIE
Oh, God.
PETULIA
Tell him, May.
Petulia doesn't like May's amused reaction.
PETULIA
You don't think so?
MAY
I won't put Archie on a pedestal. He'll do.
PETULIA
(ANGRY)
You've got yourself another winner, Archie.
MAY
(to Archie)
It's a joke, you're both putting me on.
ARC HIE
Petulia. I mean it. Tubas. All this
E "I Love Lucy" jazz. It's only cute for
awhile.
PETULIA
It's not meant to be cute. I'm
fighting for your life.
ARCHIE
Who's trying to kill me?
MAY
The two million, five hundred thousand
subscribers to the "Ladies Home Journal"
... right, dear?
ARCHIE
Petulia, go home and save what's his name.
I really don't want to see you anymore.
Archie's voice is cold. Petulia is suddenly defeated,
mostly by May. She gets up and leaves.
It's after 3 a.m. and Archie is hollow-eyed and drenched
0 with sweat from an emergency operation. He is with a
patient in the recovery room, obviously concerned about
43
i 36 Continued
the patient's chances. He crosses to a sink, bathes his
face and hands with cold water. He is exhausted. As we
sometimes glimpse Petulia when no one else is looking
and see beyond the kookiness, so for an instant we see
beyond Archie's look of professional assurance and see
the fearful uncertainty. He now moves into the corridor,
with each step assuming the doctor's look that is expected
of him.
PETULIA'S VOICE
Hi.
Archie turns. Petulia is in the medical library with
books scattered all about her.
ARCHIE
You're kidding.
PETULIA
I think I've discovered a cure for cancer.
ARCHIE
Well, if you're on the brink of something.
How did they let you in.

She joins him.
PETULIA
You look exhausted.
ARCHIE
Do you know it's almost three? Doesn't
Mr. Danner worry at all about things like that?
Petulia looks at him reverently.
PETULIA
(TENDERLY)
Look at you.
Archie is so unaccustomed to hearing a straight line
from Petulia that her tone and look of tenderness stop
him for a moment. Then, without a word, they fall into
step beside each other, leaving the hospital.
Though the streets outside are deserted, the supermarket
is jammed with people. Archie is pushing a market
 basket already piled high with groceries while Petulia
keeps finding things to buy. Archie knows that Petulia
is going through this massive shopping spree simply to
get even for his rejection of the moment she chose to
make love.

ARCHIE
It m not really hungry.
PETULIA
I'm starving.
ARCHIE
Am I being punished?
PETULIA
Loganberry jam ... we'll have a case.
ARCHIE
I'd rather have a new plastic raincoat.
PETULIA
You don't save anything on plastic raincoats.
ARCHIE
Shall I get another cart? Polo can fill
three or four when she really puts her
mind to it.
Petulia gets the point and instantly takes her place
0
in the long line before the cashier.
WOMAN SHOPPER
(as if it's Petulia's fault)
You know what time it is? It's after fivB.
PETULIA
Ilia sorry.
WOMAN SHOPPER
I want to go to bed.
PETULIA
So do we.
Archie is sound asleep, breathing heavily. Petulia sits
wrapped in a blanket on the floor near the window, her
head resting on the sill, lonely.
42 TNT. ARCHIE'S BEDROOM NIGHT
Petulia is sound asleep. Through the open bedroom door
we see Archie drinking a lonesome Coke.
Petulia and Archie are both in the bed, asleep and
somehow as far apart as two human beings can be.
In the midst of her sleep, Petulia begins jabbering in
some language all her own. Archie Is eyes open and he
looks at her and he smiles. Still sound asleep,
Petulia finishes her statement, whatever the hell it
was and settles down on the pillow. Archie looks at her.
She wakes up. They look at each other so gravely that
they both begin to smile. Neither one is having the
best night of their life but both are aware of a sense
 of tenderness that has caught them unexpectedly.
Petulia wakes up suddenly. Though she is nude under the
sheets, Archie is fully dressed for his day with the
boys. Though his clothes are very sporty he looks
anything but sporty as he talks quietly into the phone-
ARCHIE
(into phone)
Okay. Wells why not do some slides anyhow?
(in sudden anger)
To satisfy myself, that's who. Okay.
He hangs up the phone and sees Petulia looking at him.
ARCHIE
Well, we knocked off another one. Another
notch in the old stethoscope.
PETULIA
You're a wonderful doctor, Archie.
ARCHIE
I keep a little black bow tie in my desk. In
0 case the services are in the morning and 1 have
no time to go home. The neekband's all stained
with sweat.

PETULIA
Why are you dressed?
ARCHIE
Have to pick up the, kids, I'm already late.
PETULIA
You're not abandoning me? I mean, I wasn't
all that bad, was I?
ARCH IE
Amateur night,
He leans over and kisses her mouth.
PETULIA
Before I've brushed my teeth? Are you a
communist, Archie?
ARCHIE
I guess so
PETULIA
Tell Mike to watch that weight.

ARCHIE
Will you be here when I get back?
PETULIA
(SMILING)
Dumb, Archie. Dumb.
Archie starts out, then stops, troubled.
PETULIA
Yes?
ARCHIE
WELL
PETULIA
I'm divorcing David, if that's what you mean,
ARC HIE
(SHARPLY)
That's none of my business.
Petulia is suddenly hurt.
PETULIA
Phone me.

ARCHIE
Where?
48
0 45 CONTINUED
PETULIA
Here.
ARCHIE
Listen, this worries me. Really.
PETULIA
Write the Number down so you won't forget.
Archie grins, sighs, and starts out. Petulia will do
anything to hold him one second more.
PETULIA
Hey,, you.
Archie turns at the door.
PETULIA
Don't have any illusions about all those
groceries. I can't cook.
ARCHIE
And you hate loganberry Jam.
PETULIA
No, as a matter of fact, I rather like it.
He smiles, continues out.
It's a hot summer afternoon. Petulia and David have
driven down from San Francisco. They are members of the
"San Francisco Matador Club". David has drunk too much
wine from his bota bag and the sour wine and the hot sun
have made him violently ill. Though there are still two
bulls left to kill, David and Petulia are leaving. As she
moves down the spindly stairway, Petulia becomes aware of
Oliver. He is with a gang of other kids at the butcher
shed where the previous bulls are being dressed for market.
They are all soaking banderillos in blood so they can be
sold as "the real thing" .
While Mike and Stevie are gorging themselves, Archie
is at the wall telephone.
ARCHIE
 Hello there.
LATE AFTERNOON
Archie laughingly hangs up. He goes back to his kids.
54
The boys whoop off up some stairs.
STEVIE
Hey, this is great.
Archie chases them through the floors.
Archie sees a telephone above which is a sign which
says that this phone is for the military and is to be
used only in emergency. Archie approaches it warily,
then loses his nerve and turns back to his kids.
Archie wants to get back to Petulia.
Archie has had a pretty good day with the boys, is thinking
 about Petulia waiting in his apartment, and feels pretty
damn good about the whole thing. He opens the door of
his apartment. He is carrying a bag of Mexican paper flowers
It is empty. Archie knows at once that Petulia is gone.
All the joy goes out of him. The apartment is a mess.
The television set is on: a program without sound of
soldiers fighting. Archie is so disappointed that
Petulia isn't here. He angrily flips the dial getting
the same type of program.
ARCHIE
A nice, neat kid.
After all the exuberance he feels so empty. Everywhere
things are scattered about.
The bedroom is the worst of all. The sheets and blanket
have literally been stripped from the bed and flung pall
mall onto the floor behind. Archie really is annoyed.
Then he stops, he crosses slowly to the tangle of sheets
and blanket on the floor. A lifeless arm protrudes.
Archie crumples to his knees and tears at the blankets.
Petulia is broken, bloodied and seemingly dead.
57
61 CONTINUED
Th-, phone is off the hook. Archie doesn't know where to
turn first. He feels Petulia's throat for a pulse, isn't
sure she has one,
Petulia is wearing his hooded sweatshirt from Se. 23.
Archie attempts heart massage, but Petuliats so taped up
from the broken rib that this is impossible.
Archie presses his mouth over Petulia's to attempt to get
her breathing again. He tries this only for an instant
then crosses to the phone, hangs it up and dials an
emergency number.
Archie goes back to Petulia. He feels again for a pulse
in her throat, can find no pulse. He begins trembling.
As always when a crisis really happens, it isn't as easy
as the Red Cross advertisements say. Her mouth won't
open right. His mouth seems unable to make the connection
with hers. It all looks more like very bad love-making
than a life-saving procedure.
Two special officers are moving Petulia down a hallway on
0
a stretcher. A third walks behind her pressing a rubber
oxygen mask over her mouth.
We feel Sunday late afternoon rudely shattered, but limp-
ing along nevertheless. Television, cokes, sex, stereo,
facials, isometric exercises. funny-papers, ailments;
boring endless Sunday late afternoon -- suddenly bloodied.
Doors are opening up and down the hallway. People come
out to stare. A big friendly old sheepdog wild with
enthusiasm, leaps at the stretcher and almost topples
Petulia. Archie, smeared with Petulia's blood, his
shirt-tails out, in a state of shock himself, whams the
dog as hard as he can. This entire sequence should
seem like a nightmare.
The dog's owner goes berserk.
DOG'S OWNER
Don't you hit Lennie!
Archie is too distressed about Petulia to even respond.
At every door there is a tenant. A jumble of voices all
spoken together.
1ST TENANT
0 That's sex for you.
2ND TENANT
It could be a gas leak.
58
62 CONTINUED
0 3RD TENANT
She's dead.
4TH TENANT
Those rescue cops never give up.
5TH TENANT
Yes'. but they're all racists.
Of course, one of the officers is a Korean and the other
a Negro. All through this we have also been aware of many
T.V. sets, all with programs with various kinds of violence.
One youbgster comes to the door holding a portable T.V. and
we see on the tube war casualties being flown out of the
Jungle by helicopters.
Archie has crossed ahead of the special officers to lead
the way down the steps. Half a dozen "hippies"' loaded
down with Chinese food and a yellow guitar are coming up
the steps. Everything is chaos.
The officers just can't manage the stretcher down the
narrow stairway. Poor Petulia is twisted and turned every
which way - all in the name of saving her life.
7TH TENANT

(a rich old queen in
purple Bermuda shorts)
I had trouble like that with my piano. Two
hundred dollars to bring it through the window.
And its never been the same.
A record player is playing a Herb Alpert recording and
the stretcher seems to move along to its rhythm.
Half a dozen people are working to keep Petulia alive.
They're used to their work, it's no big deal for them.
Actually the feeling should be that they're as relaxed
as if they were mechanics working on a motor car.
Archie sits on a white stool in a corner, watching
everything, not as a doctor any more but as a"deeply
involved man. When one of the doctors hits a vein by
mistake and murmurs "Whoops ." Archie can take no
more and leaves.
Archie sits on a little stone shelf, just letting the
water from the shower hit him.
BARNEY'S VOICE
Hey you.
Barney is looking over the shower door at Archie with a
mixture of concern and anger.
BARNEY
(shouting over sound of shower)
0 Did you know there's a policeman outside
wanting to talk to you?
Archie nods dully.
BARNEY
What the hell is going on?
Archie nods dully.
BARNEY
Can you have dinner with us tonight?
Archie nods dully.
Barney is working the film projector showing slides of a
recent holiday with Wilma and their daughter. Each
slide projects an enormous colored image against an
entire wall. Archie is slumped on a couch popping
peanuts into his mouth.

forty miles in the rain. Almost hit a truck.
Could have been dead and buried three years.
Through this Barney keeps changing slides. Suddenly there
is a picture of Archie, Polo and Wilma on another vacation.
In this slide they are posing in corny T-shirts. The
T-shirts say, "Kiss me you fool" and "I love the
Rolling Stones"., etc.
BARNEY

Oh, hey, I'm sorry.
Wilma looks very superior.

Archie is in Petulia's little cubicle slumped on a
chair, sound asleep. Petulia lies on the bed, tubes
protruding from arms and neck. She is still unconscious.
Archie is awakened by a nun entering the cubicle to
hook up another pint of blood. Archie's presence
disconcerts the nun. She can't show her annoyance
openly, but is so disturbed she does her work badly
this time.
NUN
Who would do such a thing to a girl like
this? She's a child. Is there an
orthopaedic problem, Dr. Bollen?
0
Archie doesn't answer.
NUN
A. doctor should get his sleep.
ARCHIE
You left the needle in.
The nun would like to scream at Archie about the
impropriety of his presence here but she can't.
She is proud of the bottle of blood.
NUN
From the Archbishop's Fund.
ARCHIE
Take the needle out.

0 NUN
All races and creeds. Why hasn't her
husband been notified?
ARCHIE
I suppose they've tried.
NUN
It would be such a nice surprise to have his
picture here when she finally awakens.
Wouldn't that be nice?
ARCHIE
Yes,
NUN
It would give her some small comfort,
ARCHIE
I would put a bit more tape around the needle,
NUN
I mentioned her this morning in the chapel.
I mention all my criticals.
 ARCHIE
In the future be more careful of the needle.
NUN
She hardly makes a bump under the sheets.
She leaves. Archie moves closer to Petulia examining
her throat and eyes for vital signs. He pushes open an
eyelid and Petulia's dead eye stares glassily into his
living face.
We spend awhile watching Archie function as a doctor,
moving through the wards, examining broken legs, arms,
or whatever. In one of these scenes we pass through
the orthopaedic room.
Oliver is being given therapy in a whirling bath. He's
only one of some twenty patients and Archie barely
notices him, simply waving to him as he does to other
patients who don't need his care anymore. Oliver is
too frightened of the whirling bath to give a damn
about the doctor. Archie goes and we stay with Oliver.

OLIVER'S ATTENDANT
Come on, come on, get on with it.
JUST BEFORE DAWN
Three weeks ago. Oliver is wide awake, wolfing down a
loaf.of bread that he has stolen from the Danner kitchen.
As he gnaws on the bread, he listens to indistinct
sounds from the master bedroom. moans and groans,
a sudden cry, all of which he supposes are the sounds
of love-making. He grins to himself in the dark.
Abruptly a door opens and Petulia is coming down the
hall. She has hastily put on a pair of slacks and a
blouse, and is struggling into a coat. Her hair is
tousled, her face filled with anguish.
Petulia is hurriedly taking the hurriedly dressed
Oliver down the steps. He is protesting. Before they
can reach the front door, the door of the master
bedroom opens. David is standing there in his
pyjama pants.
DAVID
Hey, "San Francisco"!
He pronounces it like Oliver does. He comes down
the steps, three at a time. He stops before the kid.
DAVID
(GENTLY)
I sure hope there's no hard feelings.
Oliver understands none of this, and of course David
knows this, but it doesn't stop him.
DAVID
It isn't a question of hospitality, I
want you to understand that. I feel
terrible. Dragging you all the way
up to San Francisco and then not even
showing you Fisherman's Wharf.
Comprehend.?
Petulia goes into the living room to find the keys
to the car.
DA VID
0 Hold it a minute!

DAVID
(to Oliver)
What's the rushy Whereas the fire!
He stoops down beside the boy and shows him a
wrist watch.
DAVID
You've go to have some little memento.
Right?
PETUL IA
David, for God's sakes
The wrist watch is much too big for Oliver's skinny
wrist so David starts to fasten it around Oliver's
biceps. Even this is too skinny so David starts
fastening it around Oliver's lower leg. Oliver
has no idea what is happening, but his hustler's
heart tells him he is being given something very
valuable. Petulia is repelled.
DAVID
(to Oliver)
You see the basic problem is we just don't
have the room for all the folks my old
lady invites for a visit. Were kinda
short of room. I'd give you the shirt off
my back. I'm West-Texas and proud of it.
But start loading up the house with
make-believe kids, plus every Tom, Dick
and Harry whose one and only claim to
fame is that he knows how to do "it" --
Petulia is in a two-bedded room. She has blue Cornflowers
and a hairbrush. She is conscious now but looks quite wan.

In the next bed is a middle-aged lady looking at T.V.
Petulia sees Archie.

Furniture Is pushed back and three pup tents circle the
center of the room. Archie and his sons have been having
a camp-in. They are all dressed in jeans and sweat shirts
and Stevie even wears moccasins - as though they were in
the:High Sierras. The remainders of T.V. dinners are
scattered around plus. Coke bottles plus their bed rolls
from last night. Actually though it :rust: have sounded.
like a great idea the two bogs are very bored, Archie,,:
though trying to be "with-it' is far away,, and they sense
it.

Stevie goes.
MIKE
Is Dad allowed to come to the Roller
Derby? I mean since Uncle Warren
couldn't?
He is so bad at matchmaking that Polo and Archie can hardly
keep a straight face.
The place is almost empty, but the, fans are wildly
enthusiastic and are placed to look ;like thousands for the
T.V. camera. The women's team is on the rink, skating,
0 banging into each other with great good-natured brutality,
One of the skaters bucks another clear off the rink, smashing
through the rail.
The kids are in heaven, but Polo is so shocked she instinc-
tively turns-to Archie and buries her face in his shoulder.
Out of habit, he lets her, even touching the back of her'
head' comfortingly, assuring her no fatality has occurred.

The women are really brutal with each other. One small
blonde lady is being, pummelled unmercifully by several
others. As her head twists and turns from the forest of
fists she seems to become Petulia.
STEVIE
I want to go home.

I'll get it.
He rises quickly and moves to the refreshment counter behind

Archie finds a telephone booth. Polo watches him at the
 phone booth.
Her eyes lose their warmth.
The women's team races around the track. Archie returns with
a box of Cracker Jacks.

Archie is stunned at Polo's abrupt coldness.
ARCHIE

She's not going to die.
POLO
What a shame.
ARCHIE
She has her first visitor. Mr. Danner.
Polo couldn't care less. Five skaters smash into each other
on the rink but Polo doesn't flinch. She wouldn't think of
turning to Archie for comfort.
ARCHIE
"His Mastahs in'Hydraul:ics."
They sit coldly wit4 their children, a million miles apart.
The Mr. Danner who is with Petulia is David's father.
Petulia lies in the bed staring straight ahead at an
enormous cotton giraffe, obviously a gift. The patient in
the next bed has three middle-aged girl friends visiting her.
They are playing bridge. Their presence frustrates Mr.
 Danner. The other patient's T.V. set is on, and on the tube"
we barely notice the continued violence of the outside world.
MR. DANNER
It's been a terrible shock to us...
to Mother and me,..Our sailor boy
and his pretty bride.
He stands at a great eye of a window. Mother Danner is
mournfully quartering apples for an apple pie.
MR. DANNER'S VOICE
As I told Mother, "the values we lived
by just don't seem to mean anything at
all anymore. Our kids can chuck out
two thousand years of Western civilization
..of Christianity...as though it wasn't
worth a red cent.'
80
MR, DANNER
(CONTINUING)
I must say Mother's answer surprised
and, well, really sort of tickled me:
"It's easy to be an angel when you're
old and worn out and nobody wants you
anymore," You see we do try, Petulia.
I mean there you were in that man's
apartment. Where I come from ...in "little
pockets of ignorance" I suppose you'd call
it...you'll find people who still live by
the unwritten law.
MR. DANNER
There's still many a county courthouse
where the husband could kill both
parties and not spend one night in jail,
O.S. We hear SOUNDS of a bell ringing incessantly in short
bursts.
0
The bell is still ringing signifying the end of visiting
hours and the other patient's visitors sigh, put the playing
cards together and prepare to leave. Mr. Danner makes no
move to leave,
MR. DANNER
In the hospital of my dreams people
won't be chased out like sheep. People
are better than most of the medicines
they give you. David has finally'got
around to repairing that wharf. He hired
a couple of boys. The three of them are
really working up a sweat. He's thinking
of sailing all the way down the coast to
Lima. That's in Peru.
All through this there's no response whatever from Petulia.
Her eyes are fixed on the eyes of the giraffe.
MR. DANNER
They say Lima is a terrific city. If
you watch out for flies and take sensible
sanitary precautions. I'll tell you a
secret but don't you snitch: I'm using
propaganda on David so that the four of
0 us can go. Mother's a better sailor than
I am. Even though I served eighteen
months on a mine sweeper. Which should
have prepared me for anything.

A nun looks in.
NUN
(BRIGHTLY)
Visiting hours are over.
MR. DANNER
(taking his turmoil
out on the nun)
I had lunch with your Mr. Pearl less
than two weeks ago;
The nun looks blank.
MR. DANNER
Mr. Pearl happens to be the superintendent
of this Hospital; Two weeks ago at the
Blue Fox Restaurants Just the six of usl
The nun shrugs and leaves. Mr. Danner is really trembling
now from his controlled emotion. Petulia will not take her
eyes from the giraffe. The patient in the next bed is
grumbling something about "what's sauce for the goose should
be' sauce for the gander", etc. Mr. Danner abruptly takes a
 small leather bound photograph from his pocket. It's the
wedding picture of Petulia and David. Without a word he puts
it on the night stand. Petulia will not look at it.
Archie wearing his white doctor's smock enters
Petulia's room.

The'bed where the second patient lay is empty. In
Petulia's bed is the withered old man who earlier had
taken Petulia's place in the Intense Care Unit. He's
quite chipper now but is in many splints and braces.
OLD MAN
I'm not sick! Don't waste time on me!
Archie turns to face the nun in attendance.
ARCHIE
Where is she?
NUN
Mrs. Danner? They picked her up.
Dr. Worthington said it was alright
so long as she had proper nursing.
ARCHIE
Who picked her up.
NUN
Her husband I suppose.
ARCHIE

DANNER
NUN
They had a long talk with Dr. Worthington.
He seemed entirely satisfied.
ARCHIE
They kidnapped hero
He hurries down the hall. The'nun is startled.
OLD MAN
Take care of the sick people! I'm
in tip-top shape!
Petulia couldn't be lovelier, or happier. She's in a
IS
special hospital bed. There are flowers everywhere. She
has her own colour T.V. set which is silently showing
scenes of violence. An efficient nurse is in attendance.
84
85 CONTINUED
0 The nurse is sitting at the foot of the bed, and Petulia
is brushing the nurse's hair.
Archie stands in the doorway overwhelmed at the normality
of it all. Obviously Petulia has fixed her hair too.
PETULIA
Hi Archie.
Dazedly Archie crosses to the night stand where there
is a pitcher of tomato juice. Because he has nothing
else to do he sniffs the tomato juice,
PETULIA
(to nurse)
This is Dr. Bollen of the Hospital.
He's a splendid doctor,
(to Archie)
This is Agnes Lillywhite.
NURSE
Our young lady is doing nicely. We
have a few problems, but nothing
serious.
PETULIA
 I get hiccups.` I go along merrily
hiccupping for hours on end.
ARCHIE
Why did you leave the hospital?
PETULIA
I was feeling ever so much better, Archie.
Mrs. Danner looks in. She is wearing an apron and
stirring a batch of something.
MRS. DANNER
Will you be staying for lunch, sir?
Goodness knows there's plenty of meatloaf.
She goes and David enters. He looks extremely handsome.
He wears white duck pants and a slip-over sweater. And
a happy-go-lucky grin.
PETULIA
You two haven't met.
(to David)
This is Dr. Bollen.

DAVID
(CHEERFULLY)
Yes, I thought so. Hello, there!
David sees that Archie has no intention of shaking
his hand, so he crosses to the bed and begins to
playfully Drank Petulia up and down.
ARCHIE
(to Petulia)
I want you to go back to the hospital.
DAVID
Dr. Worthington says she's doing fine.
He's going to make daily house calls.
PETULIA
He's very good about that.
ARCHIE
Petulia _m !
During this Mr. Danner has entered. He is really the
only one not good at the charade.

PETULIA
(CHEERFULLY)
Well, you're finally meeting our
whole family.
MR. DANNER
Dr. Bollen, I wouldn't exactly call
this good taste. Not to mention
medical ethics.
DAVID
Dad, you old fuddy-duddy, things happen.
Archie suspects he is having a nightmare. With the
exception of Mr. Danner, he has never seen so many
cheerful people in one place.
ARCHIE
(to Petulia)
You told the policeman you had a
dizzy spell.
PETULIA
Right. I fell on my bottom.

You were beaten up. You were somebody's
punching bag.
MR. DANNER
won't have you cross-examining this
girl.
ARCHIE
Your son nearly killed this girl.
DAVID
(FRIENDLY)
Hey now listen, doe, I'll stand still
for only so much.
MR. DANNER
(to the nurse)
I want you to remember what this man
just said.
(to Archie)
Though it's none of your business, my
boy was in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
Looking at boats.
PETULIA
We've decided we're quite happy with
the one we have.
DAVID
When Dad phoned me I was having dinner
with a cousin of ours. Real mouth-
watering Creole cooking.
He and Petulia chuckle at each other as though this
were some kind of private joke. Archie crosses to
Petulia and just stands there looking at her. He
doesn't know what to do.
PETULIA
(HAPPILY)
I'm fine Archie. Except I burp a lot.
Everybody gets dizzy spells.
Archie looks incredulously from Petulia who has resumed
brushing the nurse's hair; to David; to Mr. Danner who's
obviously annoyed at Archie's bad taste; to Mrs. Danner
who is in the dining room setting up an extra place
for Archie. What can he do? Abruptly he rushes from
the house.
87
Petulia looks out the window and sees Archie scrambling
up the cliff, She fits a curler into the nurse's hair.
PETULIA'S VOICE
Going back to the house was the only
thing I could do.
scenes 87A B D .,and E occur only in Petulia's mind.
Petulia now recreates the moment when she first met Archie.
Archie is searching through his pockets for the ticket
to reclaim his coat, Petulia rushes up to him, with
none of the fake nonsense of the actual meeting, but
with absolute desperation. Archie is dressed as he
is on the hill (Scene 86).
PETULIA
I'm Petulia Danner . save me like
you saved Oliver ... save me from David!
Don't lust scramble up the hill like a
 b oody fool o

87B Continued
Archie is stunned.
ARCHIE
I'm looking for the ticket for my raincoat.
PETULIA
NOL
From her bedroom window Petulia watches Archie scramble
up the hill.
PETULIA'S VOICE
Coming for me in that pokey little car.
We are now back in visual reality with Petulia, and
the playful David who is trying to make Petulia laugh,
which she does.
PETULIA'S VOICE
David was the gentlest man I ever knew.
Thirty penguins march around the rim of their pool to the
music of Pomp and Circumstance. Through the Public
Address System, a voice explains that the penguins
represent all nations and are gathered 'here for their
own Olympics which they originated two million years ago,
when penguins were nine feet tall and great athletes.
Archie senses someone staring at him, turns and sees
Petulia sitting in the grandstand with her parcels. He
tries to ignore her by concentrating on his kids, but
he cannot. Actually, he doesn't want to ignore Petulia.
He looks back, she is still there, smiling happily.
Archie gestures for the boys to stay where they are, then
starts toward Petulia.
The penguins are now going through various acrobatics
while the narrator is telling more about their exotic
origins. Archie stumbles through laughing children,
ruins a tourist's snapshot, etc., until he finally reaches
Petulia.
Now one penguin is pushing another penguin in a baby
carriage. Everyone thinks it's adorable.
Archie sits beside Petulia not really knowing what to say.
He hasn't decided whether to be angry that she has followed
him,- or amused, or delighted -- or all three.
92
0 93 CONTINUED
Now the taped music is blaring a Loud marching song as
the penguins lumberingly form into a Roman legion, The
laughter,, music and applause ?make any intimate conversa-
tion almost impossible. But Petulia is waiting for
Archie to say something.
Archie sees that Mike has turned from the penguins to
stare at his father accusingly. Mike won't stop staring.
Mike now tries to make Stevie turn and look accusingly
with him, Archie doesn't know what to do0
Finally, Petulia rises and gathers her parcels,, still
quite pleasant. She drops a parcel and Archie retrieves
it for hero Its from a sportswear shop,, colorful and
gay. As Archie gives Petulia the parcel, she touches
his hand, running her fingers lightly over his skin,
thoughtful, as though wanting to remember something.
Petulia moves quickly through people toward the exit.
Archie almost calls her back, but there is too much noise.
Archie is returning from work, weighted down with
books for his research, plus miscroscope.
He sees his apartment door ajar. His heart stops.
He kicks his door open with his foot, not daring to
think who will be inside.
No, you're wrong. Its not Petulia. Two elderly
gentlemen in spotless dungarees are just finishing
installing a portable greenhouse in Arc hie's living
room. The Mexican paper flowers have been carefully
moved.
FIRST GENTLEMAN
Oh, oho We were supposed to be out of
here before you came home, Dr. Bollen.
So you'd think it came from Santa Claus,
The two elderly gentlemen chuckle at Archie's puzzled
look.
93
95 CONTINUED
FIRST GENTLEMAN
Wonderful. i.sn g t - t ? They sell like
hot cakes. Gives you something alive
in all this stone.
ARCHIE
There must be some mistake.
He sags down on a chair, draped in his research books.
The two old gentlemen couldn't be more pleased.
FIRST GENTLEMAN
Mac and I get a, big kick out of people's
first reaction. Its not a toy. It's
a working greenhouse. You control heat
and humidity with these.
(he indicates dials)
You've got a little bit of everything.
Ornamental plants,, Zinnias, Asters.
Even a little vegetable garden. The
most important thing to remember is
to keep the sun out. These new kind
of lights work so much better, there's
no comparison.

ARCHIE
You've got the wrong apartment l
FIRST GENTLEMAN
(CHEERFULLY)
No we have not s Dr. Bollen3
ARCHIE
What screwball ...?I
Then he stops, He knows what screwball.
ARCHIE
No gift card?
FIRST GENTLEMAN
It might come by mail.
Archie starts chuckling. He crosses to the green-
house, still chuckling.

ARCHIE
This one heat, and this one humidity,
right?
FIRST GENTLEMAN
Exactly. We've left a manual of
operations, and wetll check everything
out in a month. Okay, Dr. Bollen?
ARCHIE
(still chuckling)
Okay, okay! Goodbye,'
He enters the greenhouse, having to stoop almost double, as
the two old gentlemen exit from the apartment.
Though extremely uncomfortable, Archie is entirely happy.
Suddenly he is ripping up flowers and vegetables to make a
kooky bouquet. He is positively exultant. He adds radishes
and turnips to the bouquet. This is the happiest we have
ever seen Archie.

David is stowing food into the refrigerator.
PETULIA
You didn't leave papa alone in that
horrible little town?
DAVID
It's not such a horrible little town.
(he holds up a can)
Hearts of artichokes'

He uses the English way of saying "vitamin," and then a bit
too rakishly he tosses an orange up through the window.
Instinctively, Petulia makes an effort to catch, misses,
and it hits her lightly on the shoulder. Though it causes
no damage,'David is suddenly in terror. He races up out
of the cabin to Petulia.

There's nothing to it. Especially a
girl with your pelvis, You've got a
very superior pelvis.

98B Continued
She begins to ;ry.
ARCHIE
We'd never be apart again0
PETULIA
You don't mean it.
ARCHIE
I do.
Petulia twists in pain. The nurse looks over.
NURSE
That wasn't four minutes.
The nurse makes a note then turns her attention to
another lady who must be wheeled to the Delivery Room,
PETULIA
I hurt. Touch it Archie. Make it hurt less.
His hand touches her belly very gently.
PETULIA
0 It doesn't help.
ARCHIE
You see?
PETULIA
But your hands were magic with Oliver.
ARCHIE
Who?
Her pain has subsided, and she looks up at Archie.
PETULIA
Would you really?
ARCHIE
Yes.
PETULIA
You'd call an ambulance? At this
late stage?
ARCHIE
Say the word.
PETULIA
No. I'm different now. Damn it Archie,
why did I go to that Motel with you?
103
98B Continued
The pregnant ladies react to this.
PETULIA
(CONTINUING)
Do you realize we were actually only
a one night stand? We never even gave
each other a cold, All we really did
was pass each other going the other
way. Have I changed you, Archie?
ARCHIE
You turned me into a nut.
PETULIA
Is that good?
ARCHIE
Yes, I think so, Who knows? I hope
PETULIA
Archie, call the ambulance.
Archie crosses to the phone, picks up the receiver,
then almost at once he puts it down again.
 PETULIA
When I lay dying -- twenty years from
now -- a middle-aged old lady --
wondering what my life was all about,
you won't even cross my mind.
Archie winces. He starts out. He cantt even say
goodbye.
PETULIA
Hey, wait I lied.
ARCHIE
About what?
PETULIA
I'll never forget you, Arnold.
ARCHIE
Arnold?
He starts laughing, then she starts laughing. He crosses
to her and holds her hand in his very tightly. Then he
leaves.

Archie feels unexpectedly giddy and carefree. He
meets David carrying a silly, sweet gift. David
tenses for a show-down, Archie impulsively flips out
David's tie and continues on his way,
100 EXT0 HOSPITAL DAY
As Archie exits from the hospital a kid on a roller
board almost kills him.
He has an ice cream bar. He sees three pretty girls,
one with blonde hair like Petulia's. But it's the
dark-haired girl who feels his gaze and looks back.
Archie, watching the girl, and eating his ice cream,
leans against an electrical appliance shop window.
Inside, among endless other items is a single T.V.
tube, on which the world's violence flickers silently
and unnoticed as before.
As we leave Archie, we feel a sense of euphoria -- well,
what do you know, it all ended rather sweetly after all.
Petulia is looking up at the bright light on the
ceiling. Two hands move toward her face holding an
ether mask. The hands seem infinitely gentle. One
hand touches Petulia's face to reassure her.
PETULIA
(in a whisper)
Archie .?
