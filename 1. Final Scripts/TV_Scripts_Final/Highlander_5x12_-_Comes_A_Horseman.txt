11011101EXT.  MYCENAE, GREECE - 7TH CENTURY A.D.  (BORDEAUX SHOOT)

      On a bleak hillside, the ruin of an ancient STONE TEMPLE
      stands testament to the grace of a vanished people.  Inhabited
      now only by bird-cries and the lonely wind that blows through
      it -- or so it seems.  Then, standing in the shadow of a
      ruined archway we see --

      A MAN, motionless as an effigy carved from stone, leaning
      silently on a wooden staff.  A sentinel.  Coarse robes
      proclaim him a member of some obscure Christian Order.  His
      ancient face, lined by the elements, is as severe as the
      stone he watches over.  He stirs alertly as a lone figure
      approaches him:

      A YOUNG ACOLYTE

      in the same robes, toiling toward him with a woven BASKET. 
      Reaching the old monk, the Acolyte bows respectfully.

                                      ACOLYTE
                    It's a long walk.

      The Monk motions him to follow.

                                    MONK
                    Toil is good for the soul.

      They move to another area of the temple, where they reach --

      A WELL

      set into the stone.  Mossy with age, the opening is blocked
      by an ancient, heavily built GRATING of thick metal bars. 
      There is a small space in them, but a massive metal BOLT
      ensures the grate will never open.  Beyond the grate, a black
      recess stretches deep into the earth.

      The Monk nods to the Acolyte.  The lad lifts the basket,
      filled with grapes, a few figs, some bread -- but he hesitates
      it seems such a waste of good food.

                                      ACOLYTE
                    I thought it was a sin to waste food.

                                    MONK
                    It is only a waste to you.


                                                                (CONTINUED)96511    "Comes A Horseman"    2.   Final Shooting Script 10/24/96

1101CONTINUED:1101

      The Monk motions him severely to continue.  The Acolyte shrugs
      and carries out a ritual: keeping his distance, he carefully
      dumps the contents of the basket through the grate, into the
      well.  The food drops into the darkness.

      Finished, the Acolyte collects the basket and they move away
      from the well.

                                      ACOLYTE
                    And why watch an empty pile of rocks? 
                    It's been sealed for centuries.

                                    MONK
                          (curt)
                    Is there no end to it?
                          (beat)
                    It was sealed for a good reason.

                                      ACOLYTE
                    By pagans.

      The Monk grabs his arm, glares at him.

                                    MONK
                    We do not question the rules of the
                    Order!  We obey them, as we have
                    obeyed them since the beginning!
                          (beat)
                    The ancients were pagans, but they
                    were not fools.

      He grabs the empty basket and limps away.

      The Acolyte shakes his head, bemused, and settles down to
      stand his watch.  He takes a cluster of grapes from his robe,
      but as he begins to eat them -- he hears a sound.

                                      CHILD'S VOICE (O.S.)
                          (very faint)
                    Help...

      The Acolyte pauses, doubting his ears -- was it a voice, or
      just the wind?  Then it comes again.

                                      CHILD'S VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    Please... someone help me.

      The Acolyte is certain now: it's the voice of a child.  He
      scans the ruins, looking for the source.

                                      CHILD'S VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    Please help me.  It's dark!

      No doubt now: it's coming from INSIDE the well.  The Acolyte
      moves toward it, eyes wide in disbelief.


                                                                (CONTINUED)96511    "Comes A Horseman"    3.   Final Shooting Script 10/24/96

                                      CHILD'S VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    I fell... I think my leg is broken.

      The voice is pitiful, a frightened child in distress.  The
      Acolyte wavers, recalling the monk's warning -- but this is
      a child.  He tugs at the heavy grate, but the massive BOLT
      won't budge.

                                      CHILD'S VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                          (a whimper)
                    Help me, please, I'm afraid!

      Crying now.  Pitiful, wracking sobs.  More determined than
      ever, the Acolyte picks up a large rock from the ground and
      strikes at the bolt.  Once... twice... on the third blow it
      comes loose.  The Acolyte drops the rock and shoves the bolt
      free.

      He lifts the heavy grate and shoves it aside, then stretches
      his hand down into the darkness.

                                      ACOLYTE
                    Reach up... take my hand!

      He waits for the child's hand to grasp his -- then his
      expression changes.  The hand that grips his is hard,
      muscular, with a grip like steel.

      The Acolyte struggles to pull free, but he's dragged
        relentlessly towards the opening.  His head thumps into the
      side of the well.  The Acolyte stumbles back, sprawls to the
      ground.

      ON THE ACOLYTE

      lying in the dirt, dazed.  He looks up to see --

      ACOLYTE'S POV

      the creature that struck him: it is a man.  Big, dirty, with
      wild matted hair, a naked back: this is KRONOS, entombed for
      a thousand years and he looks like it.

      Kronos gazes down at the Acolyte and smiles at his fear and
      confusion.  He moves his lips oddly and a voice comes out:

                                      KRONOS
                          (a child's voice,
                            mocking)
                    Help me, please... I'm afraid!

      The child's voice, coming from this huge, frightening face. 
      The Acolyte crosses himself in fear.



                                                                (CONTINUED)96511    "Comes A Horseman"    4.   Final Shooting Script 10/24/96

1101CONTINUED: (3)1101

                                      ACOLYTE
                    God protect me!

      Kronos reaches down, hauls the Acolyte to his feet.

                                      KRONOS
                    What gods do you call on, boy?

                                      ACOLYTE
                    Our Holy Savior... the King of Kings.

      Kronos thinks a BEAT, searching his memory.

                                      KRONOS
                    Never heard of him.

      He lifts the Acolyte and tosses him down a nearby hill.

      Kronos flexes his arms, enjoying the feel of muscles long
      disused, like a pianist warming up after a long absence.

                                      KRONOS (CONT'D)
                    It's good to be back.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                          ACT ONE

      FADE IN:

11021102EXT.  CITY SIDEWALK - OUTSIDE TV STUDIO BUILDING - DAY

      A sign reading: WHEEL OF HISTORY - CONTESTANT TRYOUTS

      BELOW this, a line of waiting FANS stretches along a cordon
      at the studio entrance.  Methos steps from the door, MacLeod
      at his side.  Methos looks perky.  MacLeod definitely doesn't.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I don't believe you did that.

                                      METHOS
                          (lightly)
                    C'mon, MacLeod, the guy handed me a
                    ticket.
                          (beat)
                    It was a selfless act in the interest
                    of historical accuracy.

      The crowd sees Methos and breaks into applause.  Methos
      pauses, smiling, to give a little bow and a wave.

                                      MACLEOD
                    An oversized ego wouldn't have
                    anything to do with it.

                                      METHOS
                    I think they love me.

      MacLeod pulls him away from the crowd.

                                      MACLEOD
                    It's a game show.  They'd love a
                      hammerhead shark if it had a nice
                    smile.

                                      METHOS
                    They asked me back.  What do you
                    think?

                                      MACLEOD
                    One word.
                          (beat)
                    Animal.  Four legs, carries heavy
                    weights.

                                      METHOS
                          (right on it)
                    Donkey.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Try three letters.

                                      METHOS
                    That would be...
                          (beat)
                    Very funny, MacLeod.

      And OFF THIS they turn a corner.

      NEW ANGLE

      as they turn down a deserted street.

                                      MACLEOD
                    What if someone recognized you?

                                      METHOS
                    Not likely.  Besides, I never went
                    on to the finals.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Because you lost.
                          (pointed)
                    Tom Jones did not popularize the
                    twist.

                                      METHOS
                    So I'm a little weak on pop culture. 
                    I mean, who the hell is Chubby Checker
                    in the grand scheme of things?
                          (beat)
                    I know how tall Nero was, and Caesar's
                    favorite food.  I know that Helen of
                    Troy didn't have much of a face, and
                    it only launched a hundred ships. 
                    And Jefferson never...

                                      MACLEOD
                          (interrupting him)
                    Blah, blah, blah.

      The conversation ends abruptly as they get the BUZZ.  They
      stop and look at each other, suddenly serious.

                                      METHOS
                    Expecting anyone?

      MacLeod shakes his head.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Maybe it's your fan club.

      Methos looks worried.

                    There's another way back.  It's
                    longer, but I prefer the view.

      He starts to turn away, but MacLeod doesn't move.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Send me a postcard.

                    You're not coming?

                                      MACLEOD
                    I like to know who's around.

                    Good luck.

      He moves off.  MacLeod continues alone down the street.  The
      BUZZ growing stronger.

      NEW ANGLE

      as MacLeod passes an alley.  The BUZZ is stronger.  Then he
      catches a brief sight of an Immortal at the end of the
      alleyway coming toward him, the same one from the TEASER,
      but he has cleaned up considerably: short hair, black clothes,
      a long jacket.  It is a glimpse obscurred by steam coming
      from a manhole cover.

      As MacLeod stares into the steam, it becomes:

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:

11031103EXT.  SOUTH TEXAS - 1867 - DAY

      Through the SMOKE from a smoldering wagon, five horsemen can
      be seen approaching at a hard gallop.

      They arrive at a wooden BUCKBOARD, or what's left of it: the
      wagon is turned on its side, scorched and still smoking. 
      The result of a vicious attack.

      The riders are TEXAS RANGERS MacLeod is working with, hard-
      faced men wearing long coats.  They are serious, cold-eyed,
      somber.  TIPPET, the leader; PAXTON, two others.

      MacLeod dismounts and moves around the smoldering ruins. 
      Clothes, household items are strewn around -- the rig has
      been ransacked.

                                      MACLEOD
                    It was Koren, all right.  He and his
                      Comancheros left their mark.

      MacLeod's face darkens as he lifts something from the ground:
      it's a soot-covered CHILD'S DOLL.  MacLeod kneels and examines
      the ground, then looks up.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    We're about two hours behind 'em.

                                      TIPPET
                    How many with him?

                                      MACLEOD
                    I make it six, plus the horses they
                    stole.

      He motions toward the horizon.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Didn't even bother to hide their
                    tracks.  They headed straight for
                    Laredo.

                                      TIPPET
                    We're in for a fight.
                          (beat)
                    Those boys of his think Koren's got
                    some kind of magic.  Figure he can't
                    die.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (beat)
                    So I heard.

      He lifts the DOLL he's still holding, looks at it.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    We'll just have to prove they're
                    wrong.

      He lays the doll gently on the buckboard, and mounts up. 
      Tippet shakes his head at the bodies.

                                      TIPPET
                    Hate to leave these poor souls like
                    this.

                                      MACLEOD
                    We'll come back.  Let God watch over
                    them for now.
                          (beat)
                    If we don't stop Koren, there'll be
                    a lot more bodies to bury.

      They spur their horses and ride off.

11041104EXT.  STREET - LAREDO, SOUTH TEXAS - 1867 - DAY

      MacLeod and three of the Rangers are at one end of town,
      their horses tied, waiting.  Tippet smokes a thin cigar,
      looks speculatively at MacLeod.

                                      TIPPET
                    You're quite a tracker, MacLeod. 
                    You been in the military?

                                      MACLEOD
                    I've done my time.

      Tippet draws on his cigar.

                                      TIPPET
                    They say Melvin Koren's been shot,
                      stabbed... some claim he was even
                    lynched, but I find that hard to
                    credit.
                          (beat)
                    His Comancheros call him El Gato,
                    the Cat.  Say he's got nine lives.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Just one, like everyone else.
                          (beat)
                    And he can lose it.

      The fourth Ranger, Paxton, scuttles back to them.

                                      PAXTON
                    Other end of town.  Near the corral.

      MacLeod pulls his gun, spins the chamber.

                                      TIPPET
                    Hope you shoot as well as you can
                    track.

      They check their pistols, slide shotguns and rifles from
        saddle-scabbards, all in grim silence.

                                      TIPPET (CONT'D)
                    Show no mercy and expect none,
                      gentlemen.

      They turn and move slowly down the street.

      ANGLE - THE SIDEWALK

      Townspeople start dispersing, expecting trouble.

      THE RANGERS

      fan out across the street, rifles ready, eyeing rooftops and
      doorways as they walk.

      As they round a jog in the main street ahead of them they
      see --

      THE CORRAL

      and five of the COMANCHEROS there, celebrating.  A mongrel
      mix of Indian, Mexican, white -- they're dirty, brutal, and
      swaggering.  Some wear ponchos, items of Indian clothing,
      bandoleers crisscross their shoulders.  One of the Comancheros
      waves the dead woman's parasol as he swigs from a whiskey
      bottle.

                                      TIPPET
                      Afternoon.

      The Comancheros see the Rangers and react.  They fan out,
        belligerent, hands roving near their guns.

      MacLeod gets the BUZZ.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Steady.  There's another one
                      somewhere.

      From a nearby storefront MELVIN KOREN emerges.  Dressed a
      cut above his gang, he's Kronos, the Immortal from the TEASER. 
      He wears two pistols stuck in his belt, a large bowie knife
      in a scabbard, a scraggly beard.  His eyes rove over the
      Rangers, stop on MacLeod.  Each knows what the other is.

                                      KOREN/KRONOS
                    Look who we have here.  The famous
                    Texas Rangers.

      He looks at MacLeod.

                                      KOREN/KRONOS (CONT'D)
                    And they brought a friend.

                                      TIPPET
                    Melvin Koren, I'm obliged to place
                    you and these men under arrest for
                    murder.

      Koren grins.

                                      KOREN/KRONOS
                    Then what?  A judge in fancy robes? 
                    A lawyer in a nice suit?

                    I like it fine right here.  Saloons,

                    No, I think we'll stay put.

      The Comancheros take the cue, ready themselves.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Either way, Koren.  On your feet, or
                    on your back... but you're finished.

                                      KOREN/KRONOS
                    I think you came a long way to die.

      He suddenly draws both pistols.  In a moment, everyone is
      shooting.  (PLEASE NOTE: It is important for the European
      Version that this be shot stylistically.  Fingers on
      triggers... Horses hooves stumbling about... On men's faces,
      etc.  The fewer bullet hits seen on camera, the better.)
      They're at close quarters -- fifteen to twenty feet apart. 
      The Comancheros blast wildly, missing many shots.  The Rangers
      fire in a measured way, taking aim.

      Ranger, Neville, fires his shotgun --

      COMANCHERO

      flies ass over tea-kettle back into the corral fence.

      The Comanchero with the parasol is shooting wildly at MacLeod. 
      MacLeod takes careful aim -- blows him down.

      KOREN fires, hits Neville in the thigh.  Neville goes to his
      knees, but keeps firing.  The gunfire is deliberate,
      continuous -- if men are breathing, they are shooting.

      Another Comanchero falls.

      Koren starts backing off, firing both pistols, a Comanchero
      beside him.  The gunfire is constant, confusing.  PAXTON
      goes down, wounded.

      Koren turns and slips into the STABLE.

      MacLeod shoots a last Comanchero -- and suddenly there is
      silence.  Smoke everywhere, bodies strewn around.

      Two Rangers are down, one standing wounded, several sprawled
        Comancheros, one still moving.

      The remaining Rangers re-group, and Tippet moves to help the
      wounded Paxton.  As he does --

      MacLeod slips into the stable after Koren.

11051105INT.  STABLE - LAREDO, SOUTH TEXAS - 1867 - CONTINUOUS

      MacLeod moves carefully through the space, gun drawn, knowing
      Koren is in there somewhere.  There are stacks of BARRELS,
      piles of HAY, hanging SADDLES, farm EQUIPMENT -- Koren could
      be anywhere.  Directly ahead of MacLeod --

      A stack of WOODEN BARRELS.  Large enough to hide a man. 
      MacLeod palms back the trigger on his gun.

                                      MACLEOD
                    End of the line, Koren.  Come out
                    and face me.

      No answer.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Have it your way.

      MacLeod FIRES directly into the barrels.  The barrels rock
      with the impact of the slugs.  A BEAT -- and they slowly
      TOPPLE as a body behind them falls, crashing through them,
      lands heavily at MacLeod's feet --

      It's a dead COMANCHERO.

      Shit.  As MacLeod registers this, the HAY PILE next to the
      barrel erupts --

      KOREN

      bursts up with a savage yell and dives at MacLeod.

      MacLeod grapples with Koren, dropping his gun as he does. 
      Koren knocks him back, pulls his sword.  MacLeod grabs a
        BLACKSMITH'S HAMMER from the water barrel, blocks the next
      blow with it, and manages to get his sword out.

      They move around the stable, swinging.  Koren is a tough and
      brutal fighter, easily a match for MacLeod.

      MacLeod presses the fight until they reach the loft, where
      Koren is silhouetted in the OPEN LOFT DOOR.


                                                                (CONTINUED)96511    "Comes A Horseman"    13.   Final Shooting Script 10/24/96

1105CONTINUED:1105

      Koren blocks MacLeod's thrust with his sword, then grabs a
      kerosene lantern hanging on the wall.  He brings it down
      hard on MacLeod's head.

      MACLEOD

      goes to his knees, stunned.

      KOREN

      lowers his sword, and lifts a SCYTHE off the wall.

                                      KOREN/KRONOS
                    I do love the old ways.

      Koren brings back the scythe for the kill --

      BANG BANG BANG! -- three slugs tear into him.  Koren slams
      against the wall, drops the scythe -- and tumbles out the
      door, falling to the ground below.

      MacLeod rips free from the tines of the pitchfork, pushes to
      the open door and looks out:

      MACLEOD'S POV - KOREN

      lying below him in the dirt, dead.  Tippet and another TEXAS
      RANGER stand over him, holding their rifles.

      Tippet looks up at MacLeod.

                                      TIPPET
                    It's over.

      MacLeod slumps against the wall.  He knows it isn't.

11061106EXT.  BOOT HILL - LAREDO, SOUTH TEXAS - 1867 - LATER - DAY

      A bleak, windswept cemetery.  The crosses are simple wooden
      affairs, hastily erected.  This is an outlaw's burial place,
      and no loving hand lingered over these crude markers or laid
      flowers here.

      We see older CROSSES with scrawled messages on them:

      LYLE LEVITT: CARD CHEETER AND THIEF.

      HENRY BLAGGET: GOAT DEFILER.

      CHIP MORGAN: JUST TOO SLOW.  Then, stopping on a newly erected
      cross:

      MELVIN KOREN.  1867.  BETTER THAN HE DESERVED.

      And below the cross, an EMPTY GRAVE.  Koren has dug himself
      out of the shallow hole and escaped.

      MacLeod picks up the cross and looks at it, jaw twitching
      with his frustration for Koren's escape.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Next time.

      He tosses the cross aside, and walks away.

      Koren smiles at MacLeod.  He turns and slips away.  MacLeod
      draws his sword and goes after him.  He reaches the corner --

      Koren is gone.  MacLeod follows, moving warily along the
      street, past storefronts, cars, along deserted streets.  He
      catches sight of Koren, moving ahead of him.  Finally Koren
      ducks into an abandoned building.

      A dark, unpleasant place.  MacLeod threads through a maze of
      empty rooms and columns, searching for Koren.  He picks up a
      BUZZ.

      He moves toward the source, tension rising.

      as he reaches a corner.  His quarry is on the other side. 
      MacLeod takes a breath, readies himself -- and lunges.

      CASSANDRA.

      MacLeod lets out an explosion of released tension and relief,

                    kill someone!

      She starts to push past him.  MacLeod grabs her arm and swings
      her back.

                                      MACLEOD
                      Cassandra.  He's gone.

      His voice cuts through her rage, and they stay like that,
      Cassandra wild-eyed, breathing hard, shaking with anger.

      They move off together.  The camera PANS UP out of BUZZ range
      and there, in the distance, Kronos watches and smiles.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                    I don't want a drink.

      Cassandra paces the loft, tight, waving off MacLeod's offer. 
      This isn't the contained, controlled Cassandra we've seen
      before; she's agitated and emotional.  MacLeod shrugs.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Then you don't mind if I have one.

      He puts the glass and bottle on the table and pours a short
      drink.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    It's not often I nearly take a
                    friend's head by mistake.
                          (pointed)
                    Or she takes mine.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    That was an accident.

                    Glad to hear it.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    I was this close, Duncan.  This close,
                    and he got away!
                          (grim)
                    But not again.  Never again.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You want to tell me about it?

      Cassandra paces, seems not to hear the question.

                                      CASSANDRA
                          (beat)
                    I'm wasting time.

      She starts to the door.  MacLeod takes her arm.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Then waste it.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    I can't!  Don't you understand?

                      Cassandra, I know Koren.  I know how
                    dangerous he is.

      Cassandra stares at him.  Lets out a dismissive sound.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    "Koren?"

                    Melvin Koren.  That's who we're

                          (bitter)
                    You don't know him at all.

      She looks away.  Painful memories flooding in.  She struggles
      to keep them under control.

                                      CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
                    Long before he called himself Koren,
                    he had another name.

                    Kronos.

      She straightens up and looks at him.

                    One of the Four Horsemen.

      It's a bombshell.  MacLeod stares at her.

                          (beat)

                    dead for ages... maybe thousands of
                    years.  The Horsemen are gone.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    I'd give my life to believe that.
                    But it's not true.

      She finds an HOURGLASS on the table and turns it over, and
      as the sand spills into the bottom half --

      (BODEAUX SHOOT)

      SUPER: THE BRONZE AGE

      Spread out in the sand, a scattering of goat-skin tents,
      women and children of the tribe with their animals. 
      (CASSANDRA DESCRIBES IN V.O.)

                                      CASSANDRA (V.O.)
                    It was before science or reason. 
                    When there was a young world waiting
                    to be discovered and understood...
                    or feared.
                          (beat)
                    Life was hard.  A sickness, a broken
                    bone could mean death.  The greatest
                    gift was the skill to heal.

      ANGLE - A TENT

      larger than the others.  We hear a brief YELP of pain.

11111111EXT.  TENT - NOMAD CAMP - THE BRONZE AGE - SAME TIME - DAY

      An injured TRIBESMAN watches fearfully as Cassandra,
      wildhaired and beautiful, applies a poultice to his arm, as
      her mentor, HIJAD, tall, aging, the tribal healer, looks on.

                                      CASSANDRA (V.O.)
                    Hijad was our Tribe's Healer.  He
                    had found me as a baby, and taken me
                    in as his student.
                          (beat)
                    I wasn't yet Immortal, but I had
                    skills, and Hijad trusted me.  Maybe
                    he could sense I was different.

      (NOTE: when Cassandra speaks in this FLASHBACK, she does not
      have a British accent).

                                      CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
                    The pain will leave you soon.  But
                    do not use the arm until I tell you.

      The man moves to rise -- Hijad stops him.  He takes the man's
      hand, then waves his other hand slowly over the poultice,
      muttering an incantation under his breath.  The action has
      an eerie, mystical quality.

      During this, Cassandra stares at Hijad in surprise.

                                      CASSANDRA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    Hijad schooled me in the healing
                    arts until I knew all his secrets.
                          (beat)
                    Or I thought I did.

      Hijad finishes, releases the man's arm.  The Tribesman smiles
      gratefully, then leaves the tent.

      Cassandra turns to Hijad, rebuffed by his actions.

                                      CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
                    Did I make the medicine badly?

                                      HIJAD
                    You made it perfectly.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Then why did you make magic over
                    him?

                                      HIJAD
                    There is more to healing than herbs.
                          (beat)
                    He believes the spell will help. 
                    So, it will help.
                          (beat)
                    Do not worry... you will learn.

      Hijad sets aside some of the pouches.

                                      HIJAD
                    And one day you will pass my simple
                    skills... Then you will be the Healer.

                                      CASSANDRA
                          (objecting)
                    But you will always be here.

      Hijad reaches out, tenderly touches her cheek.

11121112EXT.  THE GREAT DESERT - THE BRONZE AGE - SAME TIME

      Far from the tents, a NOMAD walks the dunes, collecting a
      bundle of DRIED WOOD for the fires.  As he bends to pick up
      a branch -- he pauses at a distant sound.  As he listens, it
      grows louder, until it is clear: HOOVES thundering along the
      sand.

      ANGLE - HORSES HOOVES

      at a full gallop as they chew up the sand.

      THE NOMAD

      looks worried.  He turns, quickly scans the horizon -- and
      freezes in fear.  Coming straight at him --

      THE HORSEMEN

      four MOUNTED WARRIORS are bearing down on him at a FULL
      GALLOP, bodies covered with plates of leather armor, marked
      with METAL SPIKES; heads covered by hideously carved FRIGHT
      MASKS, individual, highly stylized.

      Three of them wield bronze SWORDS of various shapes, the
      fourth carries a huge bronze AXE.  They look elemental, as
      if mounted demons had descended to earth.

      For a BEAT the Nomad is frozen, then fear pushes him into
      action.  He turns with a cry and tries to run.

      THE HORSEMEN

      are bearing down on him.

      THE NOMAD

      runs for his life, but the Horsemen are too fast.  As they
      gallop past, a SWORD flashes -- the Nomad tumbles into a
      lifeless heap in the sand.

      The Horsemen continue at a FULL GALLOP, not slowing their
      pace a bit.

                    Hijad told them I was a gift from
                    the desert... and one did not refuse
                    such gifts.  He saw things that others
                    could not see.
                          (beat)
                    He could not foresee what was to
                    happen.

      As they work, there is an eruption of SCREAMS.  Cassandra
      and Hijad drop what they are doing and race toward them.

11141114EXT.  NOMAD CAMP - THE GREAT DESERT - CONTINUOUS - DAY

      As Cassandra and Hijad come around their tent to find a sight
      of pandemonium:

      The HORSEMEN have hit the camp.  (NOTE: For the Foreign
      Version, please shoot the following stylistically.  On horses
      and faces, showing as little carnage as possible.)  People
      run, women grab children, men try to resist with knives. 
      The Horsemen are fighting machines, people falling, scattering
      for their lives.

                                      HIJAD
                    STOP!

      The Leader of the Horsemen sees Hijad.  He raises his arms --
      and the other Horsemen pause in the slaughter.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    What are they?

                    The Horsemen.

      Cassandra's eyes widen in fear as the leader rides slowly
      towards them.

                                      CASSANDRA (V.O.)
                    Everyone knew of the Four Horsemen. 
                    The destroyers.  The ones who lay
                    waste.
                          (beat)
                    Across the world we knew, people
                    lived in terror of them.  Where they
                    rode, whole villages were destroyed...
                    or simply vanished.  They were without
                    mercy, without fear.

      The Leader spurs his horse toward Hijad.  His mask makes him
      seem a god, or a devil, and his voice booms from inside it,
      oddly distorted.

      Hijad gathers his courage and steps forward.

                                      HIJAD
                    We have nothing you want!

                    No, wait!

      Cassandra turns to the tent, quickly drags out a worked METAL
      CASKET.  She throws it before Kronos.

                    This is all we have, I swear!

      Kronos raises his mask.  Under it, his face is weirdly painted --
      it is as frightening as the mask.

                                      KRONOS
                    Then kill them.
                          (beat)
                    Kill them all.

      Kronos lowers his mask and spurs his horse towards Hijad.

      Cassandra steps in his path, screaming, raises her arms to
      stop him -- but Kronos swings, and she is the first to die.

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

      Cassandra faces the window, remembering, her face wet with
      tears.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I never knew.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Whatever he calls himself, he's
                    Kronos.  He'll always be Kronos.
                          (beat)
                    All the hate.  All the pain I tried

                    It never leaves, does it?

      MacLeod gently touches her face, wipes her tears.

                                      MACLEOD
                      Sometimes.  For a little while.

      She pulls him to her, and they kiss.  He lifts her in his
      arms, lowers her gently onto the bed.  He kisses her eyes.

11181118INT.  JOE'S - DAY

      Dawson looks up from the bar to look at MacLeod and Cassandra. 
      Did he hear right?

                                      DAWSON
                    The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse? 
                    Like in the Bible?

                    No, like in the Kentucky Derby.

      Dawson continues wiping the bar.

                                      DAWSON
                    Right.  So which one you betting on? 
                    War?  Famine?  Pestilence?

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Death.

      Dawson looks at her.  She's not smiling.

                                      DAWSON
                    You're serious.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Dead serious.

                                      DAWSON
                    Look, history is full of mounted
                    raiders.  Stories become legends,
                    legends turn into myths...
                          (beat)
                    The Four Horsemen were symbols of
                    war.

      Cassandra leans across the bar, a thousand watts of juice in
      her eyes.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    A symbol didn't put my tribe to the
                    sword.

                                      MACLEOD
                    The Horsemen were Immortals, Joe. 
                    One is called Kronos.

      Dawson shakes his head.

                                      DAWSON
                    Kronos.  Sounds like something out
                    of the Dark Ages.

                    I know.  I was there.

      She holds his eyes.  Dawson looks at her then back at MacLeod
      for confirmation.  MacLeod nods.

      Dawson wipes a glass a little shakily, leans on the bar.

                                      DAWSON
                    What do you want me to do.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Find Kronos.

                                      DAWSON
                    How?  I mean, supposing he is real,
                    I never heard of the guy until now.

                                      MACLEOD
                    But you've heard of Melvin Koren.

      And OFF Dawson's look --

11191119EXT.  STREET OUTSIDE METHOS' PLACE - DAY

      A modernistic structure, kind of Frank Lloyd Wright in metal
      and glass.  Methos is approaching his 4-wheel-drive vehicle,
      looking tight-lipped.  He's concerned about MacLeod and the
      unknown Immortal.  He stops as he gets the BUZZ.  He reacts
      in relief, starts to turn around.

                                      METHOS
                    MacLeod!  I was starting to worry --

      SCHWING.  He's cut off in mid-sentence, eyes wide in shock. 
      He looks down to see --

      A DAGGER BLADE sunk deep into his chest, right over his heart.

      Kronos, a few feet away.  He smiles at the look on Methos'
      face as his failing heart struggles to beat.

                                      KRONOS
                      Greetings, brother.

      Methos tries to shake his head -- this can't really be
      happening.

                                      METHOS
                          (a whisper)
                    Kronos...

      Then he slumps against the van, dead.

      As he pulls the dagger from the chest of the dead Methos.

11201120INT.  KRONOS HIDEOUT - POWER STATION - DAY

      An abandoned electrical station, a tunnel with unusual,
      dramatic atmosphere.

      Methos lies on a slab, life just returning to him.  He coughs
      and opens his eyes, disoriented for a moment.  Then he sees,
      standing over him --

      Kronos, watching him, his sword held loosely.

                                      KRONOS
                    It's been a long time.  How you
                    feeling?

      Methos wheezes, takes a breath, clutching his chest.

                                      METHOS
                    Like I left my heart in San Francisco.

                                      KRONOS
                    I always thought you had no heart.
                          (re the wound)
                    Does it hurt?

                                      METHOS
                    What do you think?

                                      KRONOS
                    Since you asked?

      Kronos plants his BOOT on Methos' chest and pushes hard.

                                      KRONOS (CONT'D)
                    I think you could use a little pain,
                    brother.  I think it's just what you
                    need.

      He pushes hard to make his point, then lifts his foot.  Methos
      sits up, gasping.

                                      KRONOS (CONT'D)
                    There was a time you'd bounce right
                    up, asking for more.  You're getting
                    soft.

      Methos pushes gingerly to his feet.

                                      METHOS
                    Not soft, Kronos.

                    I just passed through my angry
                      adolescence a little earlier than
                    you.

                                      KRONOS
                    All this time, I thought you were
                    dead.  Never even bothered looking
                    for you.
                          (beat)
                    Then I heard rumors.  A word here, a
                    story there... "Methos, the world's
                    oldest man."
                          (beat)
                    You slipped up, old friend.  You got

                    No one's perfect.

                                      KRONOS
                    But you were close.
                          (beat)
                      I shouldn't be surprised you're still
                    alive.

      He steps up close to Methos and places a hand on his cheek,
      almost tenderly.

                                      KRONOS (CONT'D)
                    You were always the one I counted
                    on.  You weren't the strongest, or
                    the toughest -- but you were the
                    survivor.  It's what you do best.
                          (cold)
                    Or did.

      An ominous ring to this.  Methos looks resigned.

                                      METHOS
                    So.  You came to kill me.

                                      KRONOS
                    It's what I do best.
                          (beat)
                    But you do have a choice.

      Methos hadn't expected this.

                                      METHOS
                    I'm all for choices.

      Kronos whips his sword up in a flash, puts it to Methos'
      neck.

11211121INT.  DOJO - DAY

      MacLeod is just heading into his office when he gets the
      BUZZ.  He turns back to the dojo, tensing -- he's had enough
      surprises in one day.

      Methos steps in.  MacLeod relaxes.

                                      METHOS
                    I was worried about you yesterday. 
                    Glad you made it.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Me too.

                                      METHOS
                    MacLeod, something... unexpected
                    came up.

      Before Methos can continue.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Tell me about it.  You ever hear of
                    an Immortal named Kronos?

                                      METHOS
                    Kronos... ?

      They are interrupted by the BUZZ as the elevator descends,
      the door opens --

      Cassandra steps out.  She sees Methos -- and freezes in shock.

                    You.

      Methos freezes for a BEAT -- then looks back to MacLeod,
      face blank -- he has no idea who she's talking about.

      MacLeod looks from her to Methos -- Methos shrugs.

                                      METHOS
                    Who's this?

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Draw your sword!

      There's no time for Methos to react, for MacLeod to say
      anything -- Cassandra starts to come at him.

                                      METHOS
                    Who is she?  MacLeod!

                                      MACLEOD
                      Cassandra!  What are you doing?

      He blocks her.  She tries to move around him, get at Methos.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Killing him.

      Methos backs away, trying to stay away from her blade.

                                      METHOS
                    I don't know what she's talking about!

      Cassandra is breathing hard, the hate in her eyes palpable.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    You think I could forget you?

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:

11221122EXT.  HORSEMEN'S CAMP - THE BRONZE AGE (BORDEAUX)

      The Horsemen's camp.  FOUR TENTS, each fronting a pole with
      flying cloth COLORS on it.  Strung on one pole is a brace of
      HUMAN SKULLS.  Before the tents, plunder from various raids
      is laid out.  One or two captive SLAVES work over a fire.

      A bundled CARPET is dragged from the back of a horse, flopped
      on the ground.  Hands grip the rim of the carpet, pull hard. 
      The carpet unrolls, and CASSANDRA, clothing torn, sprawls
      out.  She pushes shakily to her knees to see --

      A masked HORSEMAN gazing at her.  His mask is hammered metal,
      a work of stylized cruelty.

                                      HORSEMAN
                    You'll live.
                          (beat)
                    Your type is very hard to kill.

      He offers a hand to draw her up -- suddenly she lunges at
      him, a dagger in her hand.  The Horseman catches her arm,
      twists with practiced efficiency, and disarms her.


                                                                (CONTINUED)96511    "Comes A Horseman"    31.   Final Shooting Script 10/24/96

1122CONTINUED:1122

      He raises his mask -- it is METHOS.  Not the Methos we're
      used to: this man is cold, without compassion or humor.  His
      face is painted half-blue, giving it a barbaric look.

                                      METHOS
                    You'll have to do better than that.

      Cassandra struggles in his grasp.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Where are they?  My people, my tribe,
                    Hijad... take me to them!

      Methos looks puzzled, as if she's asked an odd question.

                                      METHOS
                    You want to see them?

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Yes!

                                      METHOS
                          (shrugs)
                    If you like.

      He waves toward Caspian's tent.

                                      METHOS (CONT'D)
                    Caspian keeps the heads.  He thinks
                    it makes him smarter.
                          (frowns)
                    So far it hasn't worked.

      Cassandra stares in horror.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    You killed them?  All of them?!

                                      METHOS
                    Including you.

      He indicates the blood on her robe.  Cassandra stares at it,
      grief drowned in wonder as she feels her side.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    The wound.
                          (beat)
                    It's gone.  I should be dead.

      She looks at him in wonder.

                                      METHOS
                    You live because I want it.

                          (beat)
                    And you'll keep on living, as long
                    as you please me.

      He slides his hand along her leg.  She slaps him hard he
      instantly cuffs her back, sends her reeling.

                                      METHOS (CONT'D)
                    That did not please me.

      Again he runs his hand along her leg.  This time she flinches,
      but doesn't resist.

                                      METHOS (CONT'D)
                          (approving)
                    Maybe you're clever enough to stay
                    alive after all.
                          (beat)
                    I am Methos.  And you live to serve
                    me.  Never forget that.

      He smiles for the first time.  As she cringes back --

                                      SILAS (O.S.)
                    It's mine.  It belongs to me!

      ANGLE - SILAS' TENT

      As Caspian and Silas spill out of it, each holding the end
      of a beautifully embroidered cloak.

                                      CASPIAN
                    It belongs to whoever can take it!

      Methos shoves Cassandra down on the carpet, and moves to the
      other two.

      NEW ANGLE

      as Methos approaches Silas is quiet, stolid.  Caspian has
      the mercurial temper of a psychopath.

                                      SILAS
                    I saw it first.

                                      CASPIAN
                    I fought as well as you!  I killed
                    more people!

                                      SILAS
                    Women and children don't count.

      Caspian whips out his blade and has it to Silas's throat in
      a second.

                                      CASPIAN
                    I can kill you just as well.

      Silas says nothing.

      CASSANDRA

      sees Methos' HORSE standing nearby.  She starts edging toward
      it.

      RESUME SCENE

      As Methos reaches Silas and Caspian.  He edges around the
      two.

                                      METHOS
                    Lay it down, Caspian.

                                      CASPIAN
                    Why should I?

      Methos whips out his sword with blinding speed, puts it to
      Caspian's neck.

                                      METHOS
                    Because if you don't, I'll kill you.
                          (beat)
                    Look at me, Caspian, and believe. 
                    If I have to lose someone, I'll lose
                    you.

      Caspian sees he's serious.  Slowly he lowers his sword, as
      Kronos steps up.

                                      KRONOS
                    Problems?

                                      METHOS
                    Not any more.

                                      KRONOS
                    There's one way to make sure.
                          (beat)
                    Lift it.

      Caspian and Silas lift the cloak between them.  Kronos draws
      his sword -- swings -- and cuts the cape in half.  He gives
      them a hard look.

                                      KRONOS (CONT'D)
                    We share.  Everything.

      They hear a sound --

      CASSANDRA

      is on Methos' horse, trying to ride past them.  She can barely
      stay on.

      Methos sees her.  He races after her, and as the horse passes,
      he lunges at her and throws her to the ground.  She tries to
      rise, but he pushes her back, puts a knife to her throat.

                                      METHOS
                    You died once today.  Did you enjoy
                    the feeling?

      Cassandra shakes her head.

                                      METHOS (CONT'D)
                    Then remember this well.  I will
                    kill you as often as it takes to
                    tame you.

      He raises his knife for a painful object lesson.  As the
      blade falls --

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:

      Methos is backing away from Cassandra.

                                      METHOS
                    This is crazy, MacLeod, it wasn't
                    me!  Do something!

                                      CASSANDRA

                    He's going to watch you die.

      She swings.  Methos ducks the blow.  Cassandra winds up again,
      but MacLeod grabs her arm.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (to Methos)
                    Get out!

      Methos ducks out the door as Cassandra writhes in MacLeod's
      grip.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Let me go!

      He releases her -- she immediately runs to the door and looks
      out -- but Methos is gone.  She turns back to the dojo to
      look at MacLeod.

                                      CASSANDRA (CONT'D)

                    Ask yourself.  Does it sound like
                    him?  Can you see him murdering women
                    and children for pleasure?

      MacLeod shakes his head.

                                      MACLEOD
                    No.

                                      DAWSON
                    Sometimes all you got to go on is
                    your gut.  If I were you, I'd listen
                    to it.

                                      MACLEOD
                    It's not enough.

                    The Watchers don't know everything,
                    Mac.  You know Methos' history as
                    well as I do.
                          (beat)
                    If it's proof you want... I'm fresh
                    out.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (tight)
                    Then I'll find my own.

      As MacLeod turns and walks out.

11251125INT.  KRONOS' HIDEOUT - POWER STATION - DAY

      Kronos looks up as Methos enters.

                                      KRONOS
                    So you're back.

                                      METHOS
                    What did you think I'd do?  Run? 
                    Hide?  Go somewhere you'd never find
                    me?

                                      KRONOS
                    No, you're too smart for that.
                          (beat)
                    You know I'd track you down.  Country
                    by country, city by city, no matter
                    how long it took.

      He places a brotherly arm on Methos' shoulder.

                                      KRONOS (CONT'D)
                    And then I'd kill you.

                                      METHOS
                    Nice to feel wanted.

                                      KRONOS
                    I need you.  A dozen times I tried
                    to take up the old ways.
                          (beat)
                    But I failed.  The others I rode
                    with were trash... scum.
                          (beat)
                    There was no one to plan my raids. 
                    Or understand the true use of terror. 
                    You are one of a kind, Methos.  As
                    we all were.
                          (intense)
                    There was never a band like us. 
                    Never in all history.

      Methos nods weakly.  Kronos turns his back, starts rummaging
      through a pack.  Methos stares at him.  Thinking.  Kronos is
      vulnerable.

                                      METHOS
                    Why let me out of your sight in the
                    first place?

      It's now or never.  Slowly he draws his sword, moving toward
      Kronos.

                                      KRONOS
                    A lot of time's passed since we rode
                    together.  I had to be sure of you.

      Methos takes a silent breath, raises his sword --

      KRONOS

      suddenly spins around, has a knife to Methos' throat.

                                      KRONOS (CONT'D)
                          (a smile)
                    Now I'm sure.

      Methos throws his sword down.

                                      METHOS
                    Don't you understand?  I can't do
                    this anymore!  I've changed!

                                      KRONOS
                    No.  You pretended to, maybe you
                    even convinced yourself you had --
                    but inside, you're still there,
                    Methos.
                          (beat)
                    You're like me.

                                      METHOS
                    Not anymore!

                                      KRONOS
                    No?  Tell me you haven't missed it.

                                      METHOS
                          (bitter)
                    The killing?

                                      KRONOS
                    The freedom... The power.

      He lowers the knife and puts his arm around Methos' shoulder,
      his voice fervent, mesmerizing.

                    Riding out of the sun, knowing you're
                    the most terrifying thing they ever
                    laid eyes on... that their weapons
                    and their gods are useless against
                    you...
                          (beat)
                    That you're the last thing they'll
                    ever see.
                          (intense)
                    That's what you were meant to be,
                    Methos.

      Methos is silent, but we see it in his eyes: the surfacing
      of a thing long submerged.  He tries to fight it.

                                      METHOS
                    No.

      But it comes out weakly.

                                      KRONOS
                    Don't fight it, Methos.  Feel it. 
                    Embrace it.  Love it.
                          (beat)
                    It's what you are.

      Methos is silent a LONG BEAT, then...

      Kronos pats him on the back.

                                      KRONOS
                    I'm going to do you a favor.
                          (beat)
                    You know Cassandra's here.

                                      METHOS
                          (beat)
                    We didn't exactly exchange gifts.

                                      KRONOS
                    Then you know she'll kill you if she
                    gets the chance.
                          (beat)
                    You never could bring yourself to
                    take her head.
                          (beat)
                    So I'll do it for you.

      Methos is silent.  He knows Kronos is right.

                                      METHOS
                    And in return?

      Methos blanches.

                                      METHOS
                    He's nothing to you... Why MacLeod?

                                      KRONOS
                    Because he's your friend.
                          (moving closer)
                    Because you still need to prove
                    yourself.
                          (intense)
                    And because you owe me.

      He takes out a knife and moves toward his palm.  We are on
      his face as he draws the blade over his hand.

                                      KRONOS (CONT'D)
                    Swear it.

      He holds Methos' eyes, extends the knife to him.

                                      KRONOS (CONT'D)
                    Swear you will kill MacLeod!

      Methos takes the knife, looks at it a LONG BEAT.  Then he
      cuts his own palm, and clasps it to Kronos.  Their hands
      tighten together.  Their eyes lock.

                                      METHOS
                    I swear.

      And OFF this --

                                                                              FADE OUT.

      FADE IN:

11261126EXT.  STREET OUTSIDE METHOS' PLACE - DAY

      Methos is packing his van, tossing in laundry bags full of
      clothes, a satchel, preparing to leave in a hurry.  He gets
      the BUZZ, turns as --

      MACLEOD'S T-BIRD

      screeches to a stop near him.  MacLeod hops out and
      approaches.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Going somewhere?

      Methos turns, heaves more items into the van.  His face is
      tight.

                                      METHOS
                    You shouldn't be here.

                                      MACLEOD
                    What are you running from?  The
                    question or the answer?

                                      METHOS
                    There is no answer.
                          (beat)
                    Leave it be, MacLeod.

      He turns to the van, but MacLeod spins him around to face
      him.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Is what she said true?

                                      METHOS
                    I'm out of here.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Not yet, you're not.
                          (hard)
                    Is it true, or isn't it?

      Methos throws down a satchel in frustration.

                                      METHOS
                    Dammit, they were different times! 
                    I was different... the whole bloody
                    WORLD was different!

                                      MACLEOD
                    DID YOU KILL THOSE PEOPLE!

      Methos finally snaps, turns and HAMMERS the mirror of the
      van, snaps it off.

                                      METHOS
                    Killing was all I knew.  Yes!
                          (beat)
                    Is that what you wanted to hear?

      MacLeod looks at him a long beat.

                                      MACLEOD
                    It's enough.

      He starts to turn away, but Methos stops him.

                                      METHOS
                    No, it isn't enough!
                          (beat)
                    I killed, MacLeod.  But not just
                    fifty... not a hundred...
                          (beat)
                    I killed a thousand.  Ten thousand! 
                    And I was GOOD at it!
                          (beat)
                    And it wasn't because of vengeance. 
                    It wasn't because of greed.  It was
                    because I LOVED IT.

      Now that he's started, it comes out like an eruption.

                                      METHOS
                    Cassandra was nothing.  Her village
                    was nothing.
                          (beat)
                    You want to know who I was?
                          (beat)
                    I was Death in a mask.  When mothers
                    told their children the monster would
                    get them, I was that monster!  I was
                    the nightmare that kept them awake
                    at night!  Is that what you wanted
                    to hear?!

      He finally winds down.

                                      METHOS (CONT'D)
                    The answer is yes.  Oh, yes.

      MacLeod doesn't answer for a moment.

                    We're done.

      He turns and walks back to his car.  And OFF Methos' face,
      watching him --

                    trying.

11281128INT.  MACLEOD'S LOFT - DAY

      MacLeod leans on the counter, brooding, as Dawson paces behind
      him.

                    I'm not defending it, I'm trying to
                      understand.

                                      MACLEOD
                    What's to understand, Joe?  When he
                    rode into a village, there were women,
                    there were children.  There was life. 
                    And when he rode out...
                          (intense)
                    There wasn't.

                                      DAWSON
                    You weren't there.

                    Those were different times, Mac. 
                    Different rules, morals... you can't
                    compare it.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I won't compare it and I can't excuse
                    it.

                    I know what I've done and I live
                    with it, but I'm telling you it's
                    not the same.

                    bastards who burned and raped their

                    bullets somehow missed all the
                    children?

                                      MACLEOD
                    It's different.

                    Because he killed for the pleasure
                    of killing.

      He holds Dawson's eyes.  The moment is broken as a PHONE
      RINGS: Dawson's cell.  He pulls it from his pocket, listens
      briefly.

                    She led us to Kronos.

      MacLeod reacts.  He turns without a word and heads for the
      door.

11291129INT.  KRONOS' HIDEOUT - POWER STATION - DAY

      Kronos is there when he gets the BUZZ.  He smiles, expecting
      Methos.

                                      KRONOS
                    I hope you brought me his sword.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    I brought mine.

      He turns to see Cassandra facing him.

                                      CASSANDRA (CONT'D)
                    It's all I need.

      Kronos examines her with his eyes.

                                      KRONOS
                    You look different somehow.  Maybe
                    because you're on your feet for
                    once...
                          (beat)
                    Instead of your back.

      Cassandra tightens, but remains controlled.  She takes a
      step toward him.

                    Centuries pass.  Nations come and

                    Did you come for me?  I'm afraid
                    Methos is busy.  He's out killing
                    MacLeod.

      Cassandra wavers.

                    Come, let's see what you learned in
                    three thousand years.

                          (using THE VOICE)
                    You're weak, Kronos... tired.  All
                    you want to do is close your eyes.

                    You have to close your eyes.

      Kronos smiles, just laughs it off.

                                      KRONOS
                    Why, so you can kiss me?

                    Then maybe this will.

      She charges, swinging.  Kronos deflects her blow.  She's
      fast and determined, but she's angry.  As Kronos lets her
      flail away, she overreaches --

      Kronos gives his sword a twist, and disarms her.

      Cassandra backs away, using a short table to keep between
      them.  She shoves the table at him hard, trying to stay away. 
      Kronos catches it with his foot.

                                      KRONOS
                    Methos never liked the idea of killing
                    you.
                          (beat)
                    But I do.

      She backs up until she's beside a stack of CONTAINER
      CYLINDERS.  As Kronos steps forward, she grabs a cylinder,
      shoves -- and they come cascading down.

      KRONOS

      is slammed aside.  Cassandra turns and runs.  Kronos throws
      off the cylinders and moves after her.

      NEW ANGLE

      As Cassandra races through the building.  Kronos is somewhere
      far behind her.  Then she feels a BUZZ.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    Damn you.

      She dives at him, ready to take him with her bare hands. 
      Methos takes a hit on the shoulder, then side-steps -- cold-
      cocks her with his sword-pommel.  Cassandra goes down, out
      cold.

      Methos looks at her unconscious form for a BEAT, the sword
      in his hand.  One easy swing is all it would take, and she's
      out of his life, forever.

      He hesitates a BEAT -- he looks up as he gets the BUZZ.

11301130INT.  KRONOS' PLACE - DAY - SAME TIME

      Kronos is moving through the building, looking for Cassandra. 
      He feels a BUZZ ahead of him, and sees a figure standing in
      the shadows.

                                      KRONOS
                    You're dead, witch.

                    Come out now and I'll make it quick. 
                    Make it hard -- I'll make you beg
                    me.

      The figure steps from the shadows -- it's MacLeod, and his
      smile is truly frightening.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Then let's make it quick.

                    I guess it's true.  You wait long
                    enough, everything comes back.

                      Everything but your head.

      He spins the katana around, brings it up one handed, motions
      Kronos towards him with the other hand.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Come and get it.

      Kronos suddenly charges in swinging.  MacLeod parries, and
      they begin to fight.96511    "Comes A Horseman"    48.   Final Shooting Script 10/24/96



11311131EXT.  BRIDGE NEAR STATION  DAY - SAME TIME

      Methos carries Cassandra onto the walkway of the bridge, and
      props her on it, just as she wakes up.  She starts to
      struggle, but he twists her arm behind her.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    You should have killed me when you
                    had a chance.

      Methos doesn't answer.

      He shoves.  Cassandra sails off the bridge and plummets down
      into the water.

11321132INT.  KRONOS' HIDEOUT - POWER STATION - SAME TIME

      MacLeod and Kronos battle around the room.  Their clothes
      are ripped, there are slashes on shoulders, legs -- it's a
      hard, furious fight, but no one shows any sign of slowing
      down.  As they pull apart, there is a CRASH from above, and
      a strange sound --

      THEIR POV - THE ROOF

      as a FLAMING BOTTLE sails through a window, down towards
      them.  They leap apart just as it strikes the floor between
      them and EXPLODES in a blazing fireball.  Flames leap up
      between them, and they fall back.

11331133EXT.  KRONOS' HIDEOUT - POWER STATION - SAME TIME

      Methos stands by the building wall, which has a sheet of
      FLAMES licking up the side.  He holds the open JERRY CAN he
      used to start the fire and to make the Molotov cocktail.  He
      considers the flames a BEAT.

                                      METHOS
                    What the hell.

      He tosses the can onto the flames for good measure, then
      turns to the wall, and yanks a FIRE ALARM there.  The ALARM
      blares out a shrill scream.

      He turns and leaves.

11341134INT.  KRONOS' HIDEOUT - POWER STATION - DAY

      MacLeod and Kronos continue to fight, sweating in the intense
      heat, as the ALARM screams, and the rising flames cast a hot
      orange light on them.

      There's a CRASH -- a FLAMING BEAM falls between them, forcing
      them apart as a wall of FIRE separates them.

      He raises his sword in a mock salute, then turns and
      disappears behind the flames.

      MacLeod tries to follow, but the heat is too intense.  He
      shields his face as the flames rise, and finally breaks off.

      MacLeod enters, looking exhausted.  His clothes are scorched,
      shirt tattered -- he's just back from the fight.  As he
      enters, about to drop his sword -- he gets the BUZZ.  He
      raises the sword instantly --

      Cassandra steps from the shadows.

      MacLeod drops the katana, takes her in his arms.  Cassandra
      just holds him, wanting to feel the solid comfort of a body. 
      Finally she breaks off, looks at him.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    You found Kronos?
                          (MacLeod nods)
                    He's dead?

      MacLeod shakes his head.  Cassandra's face turns ashen.

                    Then I failed.

                    Then we'll find them. 

      Over her shoulder, his eyes are open, far away.

                    It could have gone either way.  I
                    couldn't take the chance.

                    Maybe I was wrong.  Maybe I'll just
                    kill you anyway and make sure.

      He brings back his sword.

                                      METHOS
                    You do that, and you'll never have
                    the Four Horsemen.

                      Caspian... Silas... They're alive.

      Kronos wavers a beat.

                                      KRONOS
                    You're lying.

      He puts the sword to Methos neck.

                                      METHOS
                    It's true.  I can take you to them!

      Kronos searches his face, believes him.  He lowers his sword,
      his eyes lighting up with a searing intensity.

                                      KRONOS
                    Then you live.

                    The Four Horsemen ride again.

      And OFF his look --

      INT.  JOE'S - DAY (VANCOUVER PRESHOOT)

      MACLEOD and DAWSON are leaning against the bar as CASSANDRA
      sits at a nearby table in front of Dawson's LAPTOP.  She's
      paging through the files of Immortal after Immortal from the
      Watcher Database.  Their images flip by.

                                      DAWSON
                    You really think the other Horsemen
                    could still be alive?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Methos and Kronos are.  Under
                    different names, different lives.

      Cassandra pushes the laptop away from her impatiently.

                                      CASSANDRA
                    This is pointless.  We're wasting
                    time.  Let's just go find Kronos.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Starting where?
                          (beat)
                    If they are alive, that's where he'll
                    be going.

                                      DAWSON
                    I've narrowed the search down to
                    white, male Immortals we don't have
                    First Death information on.
                          (beat)
                    It's still a helluva lot of files.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Try narrowing it down by name.

      Look for something similar to what they were using then. 
      Caspian and Silas.

                                      DAWSON
                    You're reaching.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (short)
                    Just try it, okay?

      He catches himself and, as an apology:Vancouver Pre-Shoot        2.       Final Shooting Script 10/24/96

                    It's worth a shot.

      Dawson hits a few keys on the laptop and a few names and
      pictures appear.

                                      DAWSON
                    Andrew Kaspis.

                            head)
                    Cassius Polonius.
                          (Cassandra shakes her
                            head)
                    Evan Casparri.

      As EVAN CASPARRI appears on the screen, a paleness washes
      over Cassandra's face.

                                      CASSANDRA
                          (in a tiny voice)
                    That's him.... that's Caspian.

      CLOSE ON the face of CASPARRI/CASPIAN.

      MACLEOD AND DAWSON

      lean over Cassandra's shoulder to check out the file.

                                      DAWSON
                    He's in Romania.  Just outside
                      Bucharest.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Let's go.

      MacLeod turns from the laptop screen to see that Cassandra
      is already half way out the door.
