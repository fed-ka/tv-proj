notes:

To pop everything into place...

use Courier 10 (or 10 characters per inch)

set top margin at 0.4", bottom margin at 0.4" (or minimums)
left margin at 1", right margin at .25 (or minimum)
   (I had to tell the program I was using legal paper)

page breaks in hard copy indicated by ---page break---

regular tabs, hard returns and right flushes are used 
to position things to look as much like original as possible

sometimes the formatting changes slightly (as in the numbers at the
end of the lines), but I'm going to keep consistent because it's
easier

logo on front page will be noted when used but not included here

as this may be sent in .txt, originally underlined words will 
look like   _this_

I don't know what the (X) means; maybe it means the same thing as the
"*" in the other scripts


Notes:

Typos noted:

On "Locations" page, Newsoom is spelled wrong in original
Page 11, mid page, "alright" misspelled; should be 
     "all right"

   JONATHAN and MARTHA, are center stage, bound and gagged           (X)
   back-to-back and wrapped in enough dynamite to level a
   building.  A wired-up big brass wind-up clock TICKS toward
   twelve.

   MUSICAL STINGER.  LAUGHTRACK.  "Uh-ohs" from the AUDIENCE.

   CLARK enters blithely as Ricky (baggy suit, conga drum,
   accent).

                                    CLARK
                   Lo--is, I'm home! I had a train
                   derailment in Canada, an orphanage
                   fire in London, and a dam broke in
                   India. What's for dinner?

   Senses something odd, sees Jonathan and Martha and jumps,
   startled.  LAUGHTRACK.

                                    CLARK (CONT'D)
                   Oh, my gosh!                                      (X)

                   She was here a second ago.

                                    MARTHA
                   Probably scared witless, the poor
                   thing.

                   that in no time.

   Clark WHIRLS into Superman.  APPLAUSE (as if the 
   ubiquitous "Lucy" guest star has just made an entrance --
   Superman holds for the audience).

                                    SUPERMAN
                   Let's see now... do I disconnect

                   Here I come to save the day!

   LOIS BOUNDS from the bedroom wearing a homemade "Super"
   costume.  She's got a Lucy bandana and curls, a big "SW" on       (X)
   her chest.

                                    LOIS
                   TAA-DAAAA!

                   means we're partners, and that

   Lois Jumps to the clock, grabs it up and its dangling black 
   and white wires.  Superman grabs at the wires.  They tussle
   and tug-o-war.

                        SUPERMAN                         LOIS

    HYSTERICAL AUDIENCE. Jonathan and Martha BLOW UP in a            (X)
    comic "flashpot" explosion.  Lois stands dazed and
    smoke-smudged.  Superman wears that wild-eyed, eyebrows to
    the ceiling look Ricky made famous.  As the smoke clears --

                   Old gifts from Alice.  They're not 
                   getting along and he thinks wearing 
                   them will smooth things over.

                   Yesterday's tie looked like 
                   somebody smoothed a clown over it.
                   With a steamroller.

                                    LOIS

                   I can't imagine loving anybody
                   _that_ much.

    Jimmy moves off.  Clark HEARS A DISTINCTIVE ALARM.

    Clark sighs, hustles Lois around a corner, out of sight.

    Two cop cars.  FOUR COPS.  An ambulance.  A DOZEN WOOZY 
    SCIENTISTS being attended to by FOUR PARAMEDICS.  Lois, 
    wears her bullet-proof vest and paces by the front door.
    Superman exits assisting DR.  PETERSON KLEIN (looking            (X)
    freshly gassed).  Gray smoke wafts from the door.

    Outside Clark's apartment window, the strangest-looking
    remote-controlled toy helicopter we've ever seen hovers into 
    view.  The cockpit is a plastic brain complete with "Bad

    undercarriage is a stainless steel laser-cannon.  It GLOWS 
    RED and emits a HIGH-PITCHED WHINE as it targets on Lois in

    Lois, wearing Clark's glasses, stares at the laser-chopper

                   Lois!

    The laser FIRES!  Clark, halfway across the room, is unable 
    to reach her faster than the speed of light.

    The window EXPLODES!  Clark uses HEAT-VISION to intercept 
    the laser's beam inches from Lois's face.  The searing laser 
    splits in front of Lois's face --

    --and EXPLODES CLARK'S TWO BEDSIDE LAMPS!  The room is 
    plunged into DARKNESS! In the flashing RED STROBE of LASER 
    FIRE we see Clark  grab Lois, shielding her in a protective 
    hug as --

    -- the CHOPPER'S LASER GOES WILD.  Clark takes numerous 
    LASER-HITS.  Things POP and SHATTER flinging sparks and 
    debris down onto them.

    Clark BLASTS HIS HEAT VISION AT THE CHOPPER.  The chopper is 
    hit, sparks, loses control and plunges out of frame.  We 
    hear an offscreen EXPLOSION.

    The place is smoked up.  Black zig-zag patterns on the 
    bedroom walls.  The bedspread charred and smoking.  Burned 
    holes on the floor, and smoky trails on the rug.  Behind 
    where Lois and Clark stood is all that's left of Clark's 
    uniform closet.

    A clock on the wall puts things at 3:11 a.m. Lois with her 
    laptop; text onscreen.  Beside her are jumbled sheafs of 
    paper.  Lois sorts through them for mugshots of Bad Brain.
    Mugshots of accomplices stamped DECEASED.  A photo and bio
    of S.T.A.R. Labs' Dr. Klein.

    Lois's eyes drift to a newspaper clipping of Tim and Amber
    Lake.  She shoves the clipping aside to REVEAL --

    -- a list of the Lakes' professional connections.

    Suddenly a HUGE BLAST OF LIGHT and a CRACK OF THUNDER.  The

    Lois, unconscious, on a bed of white satin sheets.  An eerie
    electronic glow.  Mechanical HUMMING.  Her eyes flutter
    open.  She raises up, confused.  Pain in her head.  She
    touches a swollen knot at the back of her scalp.

    We'll only see the force-field when something comes in

    Superman and Lois watch them from their separate cages.

                   See, Superman, we wanted you alive,
                   and Lois is the lock on your cage.                (X)
                   If either one of you breaks the 
                   light-field on your cages, Lois 
                   gets it.  No matter how fast you 
                   fly, Superman, you'll set it off.

    Tim re-arms the bomb from the wall panel and enters another
    sequence.  A light-grid appears on the floor surrounding the 
    cages.

    Tim reaches for the Superman costume he used to dupe Lois.
    With a R-I-I-I-P he separates the cape from the suit.

    With sly grins, they exit the lair, the panel closing.  The
    lights sink around the cages, leaving them lit and dismal in
    the gloom.  A long silence.

    They stand facing each other, both reaching out, almost
    touching the "walls" of their prison.

                                    SUPERMAN
                   At least this has a _chance_.                     (X)
                        (smiles)
                   Lois, that's what you and I 
                   together are all about -- taking 
                   a chance.

    Superman focuses deep within himself, stares at his arm, it 
    begins to VIBRATE, then BLUR.  He moves it into the force 
    field.  A look almost like pain crosses his face, he 
    withdraws his arm, panting, drained.

                                    LOIS
                   See, it doesn't work!  Clark, it's
                   just too hard...

    Superman wraps his cape tightly around himself, braces
    himself, gives her one last wistful smile.

                                    SUPERMAN
                   Remember.  I love you.

                                    LOIS
                   No!  Clark.  Don't!

    Superman takes a breath, holds it.  He focuses, then begins 
    to vibrate.  Subtle at first.  Then faster until he's nearly 
    a blur.  And then it happens.  His body begins to "smear" in 
    three dimensional space.  Features indistinct.  Colors 
    blending.  Lois stares wide-eyed.  Superman's shape becomes 
    almost transparent, vibrating faster and faster until he's a 
    cloud of color and light.

    He moves forward.  Nears the wall of laser-light.  Lois 
    grimaces expecting the end.  Superman enters the light wall.
    The light wall glows as he passes through it, continues to 
    glow with a strange MOAN, and Lois fears he'll never emerge, 
    but finally he does.  He is nearly transparent now, features
    contorted almost in pain as he wills himself back together.

                                    LOIS
                   Come back to me.

    Finally he grows corporeal, hovering above the floor.  
    Exhausted.

                                    LOIS (CONT'D)
                   You did it!  You did it!

    But he's weak, hovering above the booby-trapped floor.  
    Barely conscious, he dips lower and his cape almost scrapes 
    the floor.

                   Superman!  Clark!  Listen to me.
                   Don't touch the floor.  Honey?
                   You've gotta fly.  _Stay_ _above_
                   _the_ _floor_!

    Superman lifts a little.  Begins to slowly make his way 
    toward the control panel near the door.

                                    LOIS (CONT'D)
                   That's it.  You got it.  C'mon.
                   You're doing great!

    Superman reaches the control panel.  He peels back a steel 
    plate to REVEAL SIX OPEN JUMPERS stacked vertically.  A 
    two-inch gap between each jumper.

                                    LOIS (CONT'D)
                   What's that?

                                    SUPERMAN
                        (weakly)
                   A problem.  If you touch the force 
                   field, a spark is sent across one 
                   of these jumpers and the bomb goes 
                   off.  But I don't know which one.  
                   Five are dummies.  Only one is 
                   live.

                                    LOIS
                   So what do I do?

                                    SUPERMAN
                   Touch the force field.

                                    LOIS
                   What?                                             (X)

                                    CLARK
                   I'll spot the right circuit and                   (X)
                   keep it from closing.

    Superman raises two stiff fingers in front of the jumpers.

                                    LOIS
                        (staring nervously at
                         force field)
                   Are you faster than electricity?

    He looks back at her with a resigned smile.

    Oomph!  Lois sticks her hand through the light-field.  The
    SPARK jumps from the second gap.  Superman's fingers are
    already three.  SPRAKK!  The current flies back down the way
    it came and blows up the control panel.  The LIGHTS on the
    cages flicker out.  The floor's minefield goes dark.  Lois
    jumps from the cage.  Superman slumps still weakened.

                   Actually, we're working on that.

                                    LOIS
                   Definitely.

    Clark pulls away to watch the revelry.  Perry steps up.

                                    PERRY
                   Now I know you two have had a
                   little difficulty in the past few
                   weeks.

                   We're okay, Perry.

                                    PERRY
                   And you'll stay okay.  As long as                 (X)
                   you face things together.                         (X)
                        (raises glass)
                   So.  Here's to being... together.                 (X)

                                    LOIS
                   I'll drink to that.                               (X)

    The staffers toast, APPLAUD.  Clark steps over to his desk.


52  AT CLARK'S DESK                                                52   

    Clark opens his drawer and takes out the engagement ring
    box.  Opens it, looks at the ring, and at Lois laughing in
    the happy crowd.  Clark sees Jimmy watching him with a grin.

                                    CLARK
                   What do you think?

                                    JIMMY
                   C.K.... there's no time like the
                   right time.

    Clark smiles and CAMERA RISES TO INCLUDE A BANNER: "Lois and
    Clark -- Welcome Back!"

                                                        FADE OUT:

                               _THE END_
