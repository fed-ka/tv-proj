notes:

To pop everything into place...

use Courier 10 (or 10 characters per inch)

set top margin at 0.4", bottom margin at 0.4" (or minimums)
left margin at 1", right margin at .25 (or minimum)
   (I had to tell the program I was using legal paper)

page breaks in hard copy indicated by ---page break---

regular tabs, hard returns and right flushes are used 
to position things to look as much like original as possible

sometimes the formatting changes slightly (as in the numbers at the
end of the lines), but I'm going to keep consistent because it's
easier

logo on front page will be noted when used but not included here

as this may be sent in .txt, originally underlined words will 
look like   _this_

NOTES: on front page LOIS & CLARK is in large, bold, underline
The New Adventures of Superman is in not so large, italics
"The Ides of Metropolis" is in same size font, not italicized
EPISODE 14, Written by: Deborah Joy LeVine, Directed by: 
     Phil Sgriccia (and) WARNER BROS. TELEVISION are 
     somewhat smaller, all caps
all other text on first page is in courier 10 

NOTES:
page 2 "Bailiff's" has 's but it's not a possessive word; in original
page 3 "Jonathan walks back up toward the entry 
     area of his apartment" it isn't "his" apartment but CK's; 
     in original.
page 44:  Generator had a capital G in line 
     "Generator room of Harrison's..." in original
page 49:  Lois quotes 'Beware the Ides of March?' and original
     has "?" inside quote.

FADE IN:

 1  INT. METROPOLIS COURTROOM - (DAY #1)

    We are TIGHT on the horrified face of EUGENE LAD a          (X)
    slight mm whose pale skin reflects the many hours spent 
    in front of a computer, but who, now, @ just heard his 
    fate read aloud.  The distorted face and echoed voice of
    the JUDGE is like a nightmare...

                       JUDGE
             To the charge of murder in the first
             degree: guilty.

    The courtroom buzzes.  In the front row, a familiar face.
    LOIS LANE stares at Eugene who looks to her for solace.     (X)
    There is another face, unfamiliar, but who we will later 
    come to know as DETECTIVE BETTY REED.  A female Tommy Lee
    Jones, Reed, all smiles, nods to her Deputy sitting beside
    her.

                       JUDGE (CONT'D)
             Mr. Laderman, before this court
             imposes sentence, do you have
             anything to say?

                       EUGENE                                   (X)
                   (voice shaking)
             I'm innocent.

If the Judge has any mercy, he does not show it.

                       JUDGE
             It is the decision of this court that              (X)
             Eugene Laderman be immediately                     (X)
             transported to the Metropolis Maximum
             Security Prison to begin serving a
             term of life without the possibility
             of parole.

Two Bailiffs appear behind Eugene, take him away. Eugene        (X)
looks back into the courtroom audience at Lois, now
standing, watching as he disappears behind a door.

 2  INT. COURTROOM CORRIDOR - LATER                             2

    Lois argues with one of the Bailiff's (BEN) outside the
    closed door to a room.  Note: There is no door knob...
    just a computerized keypad.

                       LOIS
             Don't tell me what the rules are,
             Ben. I've broken every one of then
             before.

                       BEN
             I can't let you in there, Lois.

                       LOIS
             But you _know_ me. I've been covering
             this trial for months.  I just want
             to get a statement.

                       BEN
             It's against the...

                       LOIS
                   (trying a new tack)
             You a football fan?

                       BEN
             Depends on where I'm sitting.

Lois reaches in her bag, takes out two tickets.

                       LOIS
             How about the fifty yard line?

                       BEN
             Ten minutes.

Ben knows the combination to the keypad, punches it in.
The door opens and they step inside.

             Sorry. What happened to the lights?

                       JONATHAN
             I don't know. Fuse must have blown.                (X)

superman throws i breaker switch at the fuse box and the
lights come on.  When he gets a better look at his Dad, he
sees that something's definitely rotten in Smallville.

                       SUPERMAN
             Have a seat.  I'll just go change.

JONATHAN walks over to the sofa. By the time he sits
down, CLARK exits his bedroom in a T-shirt and jeans.

                       CLARK
             Everything okay at home?

                       JONATHAN
             No.  Son...
                   (long beat)
             I think your Mom's having an
             affair with a younger man.

                       CLARK
             Dad, don't be ridiculous.

                       JONATHAN
             What an I going to do? How can I
             compete?  The guy's forty-seven.  He               (X)
             doesn't need glasses.  He can see his              (X)
             toes.  To top it off: he's an
             artist.

                       CLARK
             Dad, Mom would never...

                       JONATHAN
             Take a look at this. I found it in
             the barn, covered up.

Jonathan walks back up toward the entry area of his
apartment, brings down a covered painting.

             Dad, you said he was an artist.
             There's nothing wrong with him 
             painting her portrait.

    The courtroom staffers are still buzzing over Eugene's      (X)
    escape.  Cops are everywhere.  Lois, Ban standing next to
    her, is being questioned by Detective Reed.

                       DETECTIVE REED
             And when the door opened...

             evidence room was broken into.  A gun              (X)

             Detective Reed, I don't think that...

                       DETECTIVE REED
             You don't _think_, period.  I'll be
             mentioning the fact that you opened
             the door for Ms. Lane in my report.

                       LOIS
             It wasn't his fault.  I... made him
             do it.

                       DETECTIVE REED
             He wasn't following procedure.
                   (beat, to Lois)
             You're free to go. For now.

    Lois' jeep is parked right in front, in a "no parking"
    zone.  She grabs the ticket from the windshield, opens the
    door, gets in.

    Lois starts up the car, looks in her rear view mirror... 
    then whirls around to see Eugene Laderman sitting in the 
    back seat.  Eugene is in shadow, but the gun he's holding 
    is quite visible.

                       EUGENE

             Eugene, this isn't going to work.
             Everyone's looking for you.

                       EUGENE
             I said drive.

                       LOIS
             I know what you said, Eugene. Now

    Eugene starts to tremble, hands Lois the gun.

                       EUGENE
             I never would have...

                       LOIS
             I know you wouldn't.

                       EUGENE
             Ms. Lane. You're the only one I can
             turn to.
                   (desperate)
             You know all the evidence against me               (X)
             was circumstantial.  You know I
             didn't kill Henry Harrison.

    And the look on Lois' face tells us she does know.

 9  INT. CLARK KENT'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING - (DAY #2)      9

    Jonathan, apron on, is busy in the kitchen, when Clark,
    sleepy-eyed, enters from the bedroom.

                       CLARK
             Dad?  It's five-thirty.

                       JONATHAN
             Oh, sorry.  Guess I'm used to getting
             up with the chickens.

                       CLARK
             Couch okay?

                       JONATHAN
             Oh sure, fine.
                   (the truth)
             Guess I'm also not used to sleeping
             without your mother.

    Clark pats his father on the shoulder.

                       CLARK
             So... what's for breakfast?

                       JONATHAN
             Ham 'n eggs, hashbrowns... you want
             some hotcakes, too?

             Uh, no. I think this will do nicely.

    Jonathan picks up the skillet, then immediately sets it 
    down.  The handle is red hot.  He shakes his hand, looks 
    around...

                       JONATHAN
             Where's your pot holder?

                       CLARK
             Never needed one.

    Clark picks up the red hot skillet, empties the food onto 
    the plates.  Jonathan brings the plates over to the table 
    and the men sit.  Jonathan stares at his food, not making 
    a move to sat.

                       CLARK (CONT'D)
             Dad, it's going to be okay.  I 
             promise.
                   (sore subject)
             Are you sure you don't want me to
             call Mom?

                       JONATHAN
             She knows where I am.

                       CLARK
             What'd she say when you left?

                       JONATHAN
             we had a big fight.

                       CLARK
             About the painting?

                       JONATHAN
             And...

                       CLARK
             Did you ask her... I mean, if there
             was anything... ?

                       JONATHAN
             Not in so many words.
                   (miserable)
             I couldn't ask her.

    Just then, the phone RINGS.  Clark moves to pick it up.

                       CLARK
             Hello?
                   (beat, loudly)

             Fingerprints on the gun.  His clothes

             sociopath.

                       CLARK
             No, it's not.  It's not okay.

                       CLARK
             That they're having an affair.

    This is somewhat confusing to all of them.  Clark 
    obviously has more on his mind than Eugene Laderman.

             Well, you know, when Priscilla left
             Elvis, February '72, she went 
             straight into the arms of her Karate
             instructor, Mike Stone, also married
             at the time.  The King was devastated --

             Priscilla to Mike a year before.

             The fugitive is still at large.

                       PERRY
             Is there something specific we can
             help you with, Detective?

                       DETECTIVE REED
             Well, no, not really.  It just seemed              (X)
             to me that during the trial, Ms. Lane
             and the escaped felon, became,
             well... friendly-like.

                       LOIS
             I'm a journalist.  I covered the
             trial.

                       DETECTIVE REED
             Yes.  And, of course, I'm _not_ a
             journalist, but it did seen to me
             that your articles seemed slanted
             toward proclaiming his innocence.

    No response from Lois or Perry.  Reed continues.

                       DETECTIVE REED (CONT'D)
             I was wondering if you might have any
             information as to the whereabouts of
             Mr. Laderman.
                   (beat, pointedly)
             He hasn't called you, has he?

                       LOIS
                   (it's not a lie)
             No.  He hasn't called me.

                       DETECTIVE REED
             Well, just in case, if you do hear
             from him, give _me_ a call, will you?

    Detective Reed hands Lois her card, then turns to exit,
    turns back.

             Don't worry, Ms. Lane.  I brought him
             in once, I'll do it again.  Dead or
             alive.

             Why?

             Because I'm about to tell you the
             biggest one _I_ have, and I need 
             blackmail material.

             Transcripts from the trial, DA's

    Jimmy nods. Lois looks at Clark, arms folded across his
    chest.  He's obdurate.

                       CLARK
             I'm sorry. I can't help the way I                  (X)
             feel.  Just because Eugene _said_ Lena             (X)

             Maybe he's been hanging around 'Mad

    Jimmy laughs at his own joke, but Lois is not amused.  He
    tip-toes off.

             Or, maybe... he found out that his

                       MISS BIRD
             No one knew Mr. Harrison better than
             I did.  I was his personal secretary
             for fifteen years.

             He was a genius, you know.

                       LOIS
             We've interviewed several people who
             also say he was a tyrant.

                   (defending)
             He had a company to run.  It wasn't 
             easy, starting his own line of
             software.  And then, to find out that
             Lena and Eugene were... he didn't
             deserve to be two-timed.

                       LOIS
             There was some evidence that
             indicated Harrison was abusive toward
             his wife.

                       MISS BIRD
             Nonsense.  He loved her.  He would
             never touch a hair on her head.  In
             his will, he left her everything.

             No, he's not.

                       MISS BIRD
             Henry Harrison had a heart of gold.
             one morning he found a homeless man                (X)
             sleeping in the generator room.  He                (X)
             got him a cot.  Brought him food.                  (X)
             Does that sound like a monster to                  (X)
             you?

             like to talk to him.

                       MISS BIRD
             I don't know.  Since the murder... I
             suppose I can't blame him for not
             wanting to sleep in that room
             anymore.

    Nigel launches a clay pigeon into the air, and Luthor
    shoots.

    IN THE AIR

    The clay pigeon shatters to dust.

                       NIGEL
             Excellent shot.

    An intercom buzzer sounds from Luthor's desk.  Nigel goes
    to answer it, then returns.

    Nigel moves through the study to open the door and admit
    Lois and Clark, who are shown through to the balcony.
    Luthor launches another pigeon, shoots.  Again, the clay
    pigeon shatters.  Clark walks to the edge of the balcony,
    looks down.

             What happens if you miss?

             This clay pigeon weighs two ounces.
             We are on the one hundred and
             twentieth floor, approximately
             fifteen hundred feet above street

             the speed... if the object hit the 
             pavement, or some hapless passer-by,
             it would make contact at about two
             hundred miles per hour.  My guess is
             that it would, unfortunately, kill
             him or her, instantly.
                   (beat, with a smile)
             I never miss.

             Yes.  When we downsized the company

             employees were forced out.

             How'd you get this?  And what about
             Reed?  Weren't her men tailing Lena
             as wall?

             Two guys in a car in front of the
             hotel.  Some stakeout.

    Lena walks toward the elevators. Suddenly, a man wearing
    a trench coat and a hat, his face hidden, falls in step
    behind her.  Just before the elevator doors open, Lena and
    the man kiss.

                       LOIS (O.S.)
                   (triumphant)
             So much for the grieving widow.

    Jimmy turns off the machine, turns to face Lois and Clark.

    Clark and his Dad, in their sweats, enter the gym.  It's
    a happening place -- men and women on treadmills,
    steppers, a "Cardio Funk" class going on in the
    background.

                       CLARK
             Dad, are you sure you want to do

             I've got to get back in shape.  Get
             back to the mm your mother married.

                       CLARK
             Dad, I think getting in shape is a
             good idea, but you're doing it for
             the wrong reasons.  Now, if you want
             to feel better, that's one thing, but
             Mon loves you just the way you are.

    A young woman (TRAINER) approaches them.  Her amazing body  (X)

             Thanks anyway, but I pretty much know
             my way around the gym.

                       JONATHAN
             _I_ could use a few... pointers.

             Okay. Just a few light reps, then                  (X)
             we'll hit the showers.

    Clark turns Jonathan to face away from the weight stack
    and is about to sit him down on the bench when a large,
    thick hand clamps on his shoulder.

    Clark turns to see an oversized musclehead looming over
    them.  The BODYBUILDER is an arrogant jerk.

             I didn't see anyone using it.

             No, dad, we'll wait.

             Might be a while.  Once I a

                       CLARK
             Really.

    The bodybuilder gives a mighty push up on the bar:
    nothing.  He looks at Clark, his flush part embarrassment,
    part exertion.  He tries again, straining, straining,
    still nothing...

             Stinking machine's broken.

             That's right.  Put your hands on the
             grips.  Take a breath in, and, as you
             exhale, push up.

    The bodybuilder SNORTS derisively.  But, to everyone's
    including Jonathan's surprise, he lifts with ease.  He
    continues to lift and lower, seemingly without effort.

    father's arm.

             That's enough.

             Once he starts pumping, it's hard to
             stop.

    Jonathan stands, stretches.  Clark starts to lead him 
    away.

    rattled to see Eugene hard at work on her home computer.

             I've straightened out your files,                  (X)

             Well, like I said, I found this now

             program I'd seen. Suddenly he was                  (X)

    enters, walks past Lois, looking around.

                       DETECTIVE REED
             I have a warrant to search the

             My apartment? Are you crazy?

             I don't think so, Ms. Lane.  Call me

             hunch that you're hiding something...
             or someone.

    She nods to her Deputies... who fan out to cover the

                       DETECTIVE REED (CONT'D)
             Why don't you just have a seat on the

             Sorry to have bothered you, Ms, Lane.
             It appears I was mistaken... for the

                       LOIS
             I hope you never find him.  Eugene                 (X)
             didn't kill Harrison.

             Do tell.

                       LOIS
             Lena Harrison killed her husband.

                       DETECTIVE REED
             Interesting theory.  Unfortunately
             at precisely the time of Harrison's
             death, Lena was at a Neighborhood
             Watch meeting.  She was seen by at
             least twenty people who positively
             identified her.

    Lois is momentarily speechless. Then...

                       LOIS
             But why would a man set fire to the                (X)
             room the body was in to destroy the                (X)

             didn't he take the stand in his own
             defense when his attorney begged him
             to?

    Reed is cool as a cucumber, but do we see a faint look
    of...  something in her eyes?

                       DETECTIVE REED
             Good night, Ms. Lane. Remember to
             lock your doors and windows.  We've
             got an escaped killer on the loose.

    Lois and Clark are at their respective desks, each on the
    phone, on hold, with plenty of time to argue with one
    another.

                       LOIS
             Clark, men and women lie to each
             other all the time.  It's a national
             pastime.  Sometimes it's okay to lie.

                       CLARK
             It's never okay.

                       LOIS
             So, you've never lied to me?

                       CLARK
             I didn't say that.  I said, it's not
             okay.  Besides, we're talking
             husbands and wives here.
                   (into phone)
             Yes.  I can hold.
                   (to Lois)
             I just happen to think that it's
             always better to tell the truth, get
             everything out in the open.

                       LOIS
             So, you're saying you'll never lie to
             your wife, assuming someone is crazy
             enough to say 11 do' to you.

                       CLARK
             That's right.

                       LOIS
                   (into phone)
             Transfer me to who?  I've been
             holding ten minutes.... Ugh.
                   (to Clark)
             Okay, here's the scene.  Your loving
             wife of twenty years has spent the
             entire day at the beauty shop.  Dyed
             her hair red, got it cut... all to
             please you.  Except she looks
             ghastly.  She stands there when you
             open the front door, so hopeful...
             and says 'Honey, do you like it?'
             What do you do?

                       CLARK
             My wife would know I love her the way
             she is.  Why would she dye her hair
             red?

    Perry White walks by en route to his office.  Suddenly, 
    the conversation stops.  They both smile at him.  He 
    smiles back.  When he's safely in his office...

                       CLARK (CONT'D)
             Okay.  I'd... tell her the truth.
             That I love her, that I liked her
             hair better before, but that, if
             she's happy with it, that's the
             important thing.

                       LOIS
                   (into phone)
             But I've already left a message.
             Never mind.
                   (hangs up, to Clark)
             Poor woman.

                       CLARK
             Who?

                       LOIS
             Your wife. She's married to Mr.
             Right.  Mr. _Always_ Right.

    Perry sticks his head out of his office.

                       PERRY
             Lois?  Clark?  A moment of your time?

    The following conversation is very cagey, everyone knowing
    what everyone else is saying, although they're saying very
    little.

                       PERRY
             Is there something the two of you
             want to tell me?

                       LOIS
             No, not really, Chief.

                       PERRY
             Huh.  Well... good.

                       CLARK
             Better off _not_ knowing.

             Oh. You do know.

             How do you know?

                       PERRY
             It's better you don't know.
                   (beat)
             'Course, I don't know officially.
             But, let's face it.  If a man in my
             position _didn't_ know, unofficially,
             then, well, he wouldn't be a man in
             my position.

                       LOIS
             So, now that you know, unofficially,
             are you going to tell anyone else
             that you, you know, know?

                       PERRY
             No. I just wanted you to know.

                       CLARK
             Thank you, sir.  I feel much better
             knowing that you know.

                       LOIS
             Me, too.

             There is something I'd like you know,

    Lois and Clark enter with pizzas.  Eugene still sits at
    Lois' computer.  He rushes up to them.

                       EUGENE
             Thank God you're back. You told me
             not to use the phone or go out, or...

                       LOIS
             What happened?

                       EUGENE
             Nothing happened.  It's what's _going_
             to happen.  I think.

    Lois and Clark exchange looks. They're not following.

                       EUGENE (CONT'D)
             All the programs on your computer
             were sluggish today... so I tapped
             into the Daily Planet bank.  Their
             systems are slowed down, too.

                       LOIS
             Eugene, there are more important
             things going on than a temporary
             computer slowdown.

                       EUGENE
             That file that Henry was working
             on... it wasn't a program.  It was a
             virus.  A virus designed to destroy                (X)

             shapes to avoid detection.

             Maybe.  If it had some kind of
             doomsday code on it.

             I've often wondered what would happen

             dissolved.

                       NIGEL
             Perhaps we are _too_ dependent, sir.

                       LUTHOR
             Yes.  Perhaps.  I've never fancied
             myself as being dependent on 
             anything, or anyone.  And yet... I'm
             a slave.  Like you, Nigel, like all

             Just... musing, Nigel.  What it would
             be like.  No Luthor technologies, no
             Luthor Industrial, no Luthor
             communications...

             Could I weather it, Nigel?  Could I,
             a man who never has to think about
             money, could I do without?  It might
             be for the best.  I could got back to 
             nature.  Buy a pair of hiking shoes, 
             get in my car, a car with no driver
             and drive as far as I could before I 
             fell off the edge of the world.
             Could I? Would I?

    Nigel has been placed in a very awkward position.  And
    yet, there still seems to be no answer except...

                       NIGEL

                       CLARK
             Went to the store -- you're here early.

                       MARTHA
             Is he all right?

                       CLARK
             Yeah. But I'm not sure I an.

             Dad says you're having an affair with

             that true?

    Martha leads Clark by the hand to the living area. They     (X)
    sit down on the sofa.

                       MARTHA
             Clark, there are a lot of things that              (X)
             go on between a man and woman,                     (X)

    The door opens and Jonathan walks in, carrying a bouquet
    of flowers.

                       JONATHAN
             I got the peonies.  Martha always
             liked...

    Martha stands.  Now the two of then are standing, just
    looking at one another.  Clark, embarrassed, walks off
    toward the kitchen as Martha slowly approaches Jonathan.

                       MARTHA
             Are those for me?

                       JONATHAN
             There's nobody else.

                       MARTHA
             For me either, Jonathan.

                       JONATHAN
             Is that true?

             Computer records can be falsified.

    Clark notices that Reed and her deputy have their hands
    up.

             Yes, _we_ are... Mr. Law and Order.

    Then, Clark realizes he's training Reed's gun on them.  He
    empties the bullets, drops it to the floor.  The deputy
    picks it up.  Clark walks up to Reed.

    It might be his imagination, but Reed seems to be

             Eugene worked under Harrison.  He saw              (X)
             Harrison develop the virus.  He's the
             only one who can find the antidote.

    Reed takes a moment, then looks to her Deputy.

             I can answer that.  HarriTech was                  (X)
             about to fail.  His virus will make                (X)

             Okay boys and girls.  Fun's over.
             You're under arrest.  You have the
             right to remain silent, the right to

             Thanks, Clark. Thanks for putting up
             with me.

    Clark shakes his head, hugs his dad.  As he loans in to 
    hug his mother...

                       CLARK,
                   (sotto)
             What about the painting?  You going
             to leave it in the barn?
                   (off her look)
             You're not going to hang it in the
             house, are you?

                       MARTHA
             Well, I was going to give it to your
             father as an anniversary present.
             Guess I'll get him that set of socket
             wrenches, instead.

                       CLARK
             Bye, Mom.  Love you.

                       MARTHA/JONATHAN
             Bye son. Take care.

    Nigel throws up a clay pigeon and Luthor shoots.

    As Luthor re-loads...

                       NIGEL
             it is amazing, sir.  All things
             considered, LexCorp came through this
             computer virus relatively unscathed.

                       LUTHOR
             Yes.  Tragedy averted.  For now.

             Yes.  You never know when another
             virus might hit, one that has no
             code, or no code capable of being
             broken.

                       NIGEL
             I suppose so.  What a horrible end
             desperate act, utterly unthinkable.
             Unless...

                       LUTHOR
             Exactly, Nigel.  Unless it belongs to
             me.
                   (beat)
             Pull!

    Nigel tosses the clay pigeon into the air.  Luthor shoots.
    But this time, his timing is a bit off.

                       LUTHOR (CONT'D)
             Ooops.

    Luthor and Nigel walk to the ledge or the balcony, look 
    over and down.  After a moment.

                       LUTHOR (CONT'D)

             Call the lawyers, Nigel.

                       NIGEL
             Yes, sir.  Right away.

             Eugene's a free man, thanks to you.                (X)
             Nice work.
                   (indicating the paper)
             Great story..

    When he exits, Lois and Clark stand, gather up their 
    things.  After a moment of silence...

                       CLARK
             Well, go ahead.  I'm waiting.

                       LOIS
             For what?

                       CLARK

             reporter's instinct' lecture.

                       LOIS
             Clark, you don't need me to remind
             you of your shortcomings.  I would 
             have thought, by now... they'd be 
             obvious.

    Clark leans forward, swats her on the rear with his 
    newspaper.  She laughs.

                       LOIS (CONT'D)
             Come on, I'm starving and you're
             buying.

             And just in case you _did_ miss the

             just the facts, ma'am.

    Clark smiles, shakes his head.  They walk to the elevator
    arm in arm.  On their backs...

                       LOIS (O.S.)
             You know, Clark, I have a funny
             feeling that you didn't tell me your
             _biggest_ secret.

                       CLARK (O.S.)
             Well, just to put your little mind at
             ease Lois... you're right.
