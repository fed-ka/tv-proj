                                  ANDREW

                          (Dispassionately)

                Welcome to "Soulmates.com", I'm Andrew,

                your "Soulmate Specialist".  Today

                we're gonna have you take our signature

                "face-to-face" personality test.  This

                you are so we can find your soulmate. 

                                  CHARLOTTE

                Um, Andrew?  Excuse me.  Can't I just

                take this test at home on my computer? 

                I know most of these dating places let

                you do that.

                                  ANDREW

                Well, most of these "dating places"

                don't care whether or not you find

                your soulmate so they let you lie on

                the test.                                                                2.


                                  CHARLOTTE

                Oh, I wouldn't lie.  You don't have to

                worry about that.

                                  ANDREW

                Really?  It says on your profile you

                were born in 1982.

      CHARLOTTE SMILES SHEEPISHLY.

                                  CHARLOTTE

                Did I write that?  I meant 1980.

      ANDREW STARES AT HER.

                                  CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)

                  Seventy-nine.  Seventy...well, late

                seventies. 

                                  ANDREW

                That's why we do it face-to-face.

                                  CHARLOTTE

                Fair enough.  

                                  ANDREW

                Any questions before we begin?

                                  CHARLOTTE

                Yeah. Do you believe in soulmates?

                                  ANDREW

                        (Smiling)

                No, I don't.  

                        (Loudly)

                Question number one.

      ANDREW LOOKS RIGHT AT HER WITH A SCRUTINIZING EYE.                                                                 3.


                                  ANDREW (CONT'D)

                Would you consider yourself an honest

                person?

                                  CHARLOTTE

                Yes.  Well, no.  Not, I mean, obviously,

                1982, but for the most part, no...yes. 

                Sometimes.

                                  ANDREW

                I'm gonna need you to be more specific.

                                  CHARLOTTE

                It's complicated.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                You are a wonderful girl, Charlotte

                Payne.

                                  CHARLOTTE

                Thanks.

      RICK STARES AT CHARLOTTE.                                                                4.


                                RICK

                I really enjoy spending time with you.

                                  CHARLOTTE

                      (A little weirded)

                Me, too. 

                        (After a beat)

                Rick, are you okay?

                                RICK

                I'm fine.  Would you excuse me for a

                sec?

      HE GIVES CHARLOTTE A BIG KISS AND HEADS OFF. 
      CHARLOTTE'S SMILE FADES AND SHE TURNS TO HER FRIENDS.

                                  CHARLOTTE

                Guys, Rick's acting weird. 

                                  LESLIE

                        (Barely looking up)

                Why?  What did he say?

                                  CHARLOTTE

                Nothing specific, but he's looking at

              me and smiling and telling me that I'm

                a wonderful girl.

                                  LESLIE

                        (Sarcastic)

                Oh, my goodness.  That must be just

                awful for you.                                                                5.


                                MIKE

                Maybe he's got a terminal illness and

                he's appreciating all the things he's

                taken for granted.  He's doing a Bucket

                List!

                                  CHARLOTTE

                He's not doing a Bucket List.

      JILL LOOKS OVER AND SMILES AT HER BODY PAINTER.

                                  CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)

                Jill, honey, I don't know if you should

                flirt with that guy.  He's kinda creepy. 

                                JILL

                He's cute.  Just because your boyfriend

                has a terminal illness doesn't mean I

                can't try to find love.

                                  CHARLOTTE

              He doesn't have a terminal illness.  

                                  LESLIE

                Charlotte, I'm sure it's all in your

                head.  He's just being sweet. 

                                WAYNE

                He's not being sweet.  He's laying

                ground work.

                                  CHARLOTTE

                For what?

                                WAYNE

                He's gonna dump you.                                                                6.


                                  CHARLOTTE

                What?  That's ridiculous.

                                JILL

                Wayne's right.  

                      (A little ominous)

                Public place?  You can't make a scene.

                                  LESLIE

                        (Putting it together)

              He surrounds you with your friends so

                you have an instant support system.

                                WAYNE

                Tells you you're a wonderful girl simply

              to build up your self esteem so he can --

      WAYNE DRAGS THE FOAM FINGER ACROSS HIS THROAT.

                                MIKE

                        (Food in his mouth)

                I still think it's a Bucket List.

                                  CHARLOTTE

                You guys are crazy.  He's not gonna

                dump me.

                        (Pause)

              Is he gonna dump me?

                                WAYNE

                It's how I'd do it.  You know, if I

                ever had a real relationship.                                                                7.


                                  ANNOUNCEMENT (O.S.)

                Ladies and Gentlemen, it is time for

                the seventh inning stretch.

      RICK RETURNS TO HIS SEAT. 

                                RICK

                Charlotte, there's something I need to

                talk to you about.

                                MIKE

                      (To Wayne)

                Oh, it's not a Bucket List.  He's gonna

                dump her.

                                  ANNOUNCEMENT (O.S.)

                Please remain seated for a moment as

              we have a very special announcement.

      AN USHER APPROACHES RICK AND HANDS HIM A MICROPHONE. 
      HIS IMAGE APPEARS ON THE JUMBOTRON. 

                                RICK

                        (Into Mic)

                Can I have your attention, folks? 

                This won't take long.  Tonight there

                are two thing in this room that I love. 

              My Yankees and my girlfriend.  I'm

                gonna spend the rest of my life with

              my Yankees and I want to spend the

                rest of my life with my girlfriend,

                too.

      CHARLOTTE'S FACE IS AS WHITE AS A SHEET.                                                                8.


                                RICK (CONT'D)

                Charlotte Payne, the past three months

                have been the sweetest of my life and

                it's all because of you.  I know it's

                kinda fast, but I also know it's right. 

      RICK DROPS TO ONE KNEE, PRODUCES A RING.

                                RICK (CONT'D)

                Charlotte Payne, will you be my wife?

      THE STADIUM IS PERFECTLY SILENT.  CHARLOTTE IS A
      DEER IN HEADLIGHTS.  SHE LOOKS TO HER FRIENDS WHO
      ARE NO HELP.  RICK PUTS THE MIC UP TO HER MOUTH.

                                  CHARLOTTE

              Uh --

      THERE IS SOME FEEDBACK OVER THE P.A. SYSTEM.

                                  CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)

                Rick, I don't know what to say.  I

                just don't feel that way about you.

      THERE IS A COLLECTIVE WINCE/MOAN FROM THE STADIUM.

                                  CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)

                I hope we can still be friends.

      THE WORD "FRIENDS" ECHOES OVER THE WHOLE STADIUM. 
      RICK'S FACE IS FROZEN IN A HORRIFIC GRIMACE.  HE'S
      IN HELL.  CHARLOTTE SMILES APOLOGETICALLY.  THE
      TENSION IS UNBELIEVABLE.

                                WAYNE

                      (To Mike)

              We really shouldn't have carpooled

                with him.

                        END OF COLD OPEN                                                                9.

                                      SCENE ONE

      INT. RICK'S SUV - LATER

      CHARLOTTE SITS BESIDE A SOBBING RICK.  IT'S TERRIBLY
      AWKWARD.  MIKE, WAYNE, LESLIE AND JILL ARE CRAMMED
      IN THE BACK.

      DESPITE RICK'S LOUD SOBS,  THERE'S A DEAFENING
      SILENCE IN THE CAR.  IT IS BROKEN BY:

                                MIKE

                Rick, could you kill the heat?

      CHARLOTTE SHOOTS A LOOK AT MIKE.

                                MIKE (CONT'D)

                You know what?  I'll just crack the

                window.

      MIKE GOES TO CRACK THE WINDOW.  AFTER A BEAT.

                                MIKE (CONT'D)

                Rick, I think the child lock is on. 

                The window won't go down.

      RICK SOBS.  CHARLOTTE SHOOTS MIKE ANOTHER LOOK.  HE
      RESPONDS WITH A "WHAT?" LOOK. 

                                                                    CUT TO:                                                                10.

                                      SCENE TWO

      INT. CHARLOTTE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

      A SPACIOUS, NICELY FURNISHED APARTMENT WITH A BIG
      KITCHEN.  CHARLOTTE ENTERS, FOLLOWED BY HER FRIENDS.
      WAYNE STILL WEARS HIS FOAM FINGER.

                                WAYNE

                That was brutal!

                                  CHARLOTTE

                Well, what was I supposed to say?  Was

                I supposed to lie?

                                  LESLIE

                Yes. You were supposed to say, "Sure,

                Rick.  I'd love to marry you." Then

                once you got to the parking lot say,

                "You know what, Rick?  I don't want to

                marry you. I was lying before so you

                wouldn't look like a total ass in front

              of the entire world."

                        (Gesticulating with finger)

                That would've been a stronger move.

                                MIKE

              It was horrifying.

                                  CHARLOTTE

                Guys, it wasn't that bad.                                                                 11.


                                WAYNE

                When you said you "hoped you could

                still be friends" my testicles actually

                hurt.  Like, physically hurt.

                                  CHARLOTTE

                Well, I wasn't expecting it.  Because

              of you guys I was expecting him to

                dump me! 

                                MIKE

                Don't look at me.  I thought he was

                doing a Bucket List.

                                  LESLIE

                I'm surprised none of us saw this

                coming.  It's not like it's the first

                time this has ever happened to you.

                                JILL

                Yeah, Charlotte, guys are always

                proposing to you.  Why is that?

                                WAYNE

                She must be wicked in the sack.

                                  CHARLOTTE

                I'm not wicked in the sack.

                                WAYNE

                You're not?

                                  CHARLOTTE

                I can be wicked in the sack.

                                  CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)

                But I'd like to think that there's

                more to it than that.

                                WAYNE

                There's not.

                                  LESLIE

                I've never been proposed to.  How sad

              is that?  What's wrong with me? 

                                MIKE

                Could be worse.  You could be divorced

                like Jill. 

                                JILL

                Hey, at least I was married.

                                MIKE

                For four days. 

                                JILL

              It was what they call a whirlwind

                romance.

                                MIKE

                A whirlwind romance that cost your Dad

                thirty thousand dollars.

      JILL'S PHONE RINGS.

                                JILL

                Speaking of Whirlwind romances.

                        (Into Phone)

                This is Jill.  Oh, hey.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                13.


                                JILL (CONT'D)

                So, have you washed off all your make

                up?  I'm sorry.  "Body paint"?

      SHE GIGGLES AND HEADS TO CHARLOTTE'S BEDROOM.

                                  CHARLOTTE

                Shouldn't he have talked to me about

                it? You know?  Done some reconnaissance? 

                You shouldn't ask that question unless

                you know what the answer will be.  

                                MIKE

                Exactly.  Screw Rick.  He assumes that

                just because he has a strong jaw line

                and a beautiful head of hair that

                everybody's gonna say yes to his every

                whim.  You did him a service. Took him

                down a notch.  The guy's too gorgeous.

      WAYNE REACTS.  LESLIE IS LOOKING AT HER PHONE.

                                  LESLIE

                Charlotte, we lost the Franco account. 

                The bride just sent me an e-mail saying

                she thinks what you did was awful and

                she doesn't want her wedding planned

              by a "cold hearted skank". 

                                  CHARLOTTE

                Let me see that!

      CHARLOTTE GRABS LESLIE'S PHONE TO READ THE E-MAIL.                                                                14.


                                WAYNE

                      (To Mike)

                Dude.  You asked me to let you know if

                you ever sound gay.

                                MIKE

                Was it saying Rick had a beautiful

                head of hair?

      WAYNE TOUCHES HIS NOSE WITH THE FOAM FINGER.

                                WAYNE

                Bingo!

                                  CHARLOTTE

                I'm not a skank!  

      JILL ENTERS FROM THE OTHER ROOM WITH HER CELL PHONE.

                                JILL

                So, I'm meeting the body painter for a

                drink tomorrow afternoon.

                                MIKE

                Doesn't it bother you that you have no

                idea what this guy even looks like?

                                JILL

              He had a great pick-up line.

                                MIKE

                Really?  What was it?

                                JILL

              He said: Are you wearing space pants? 

                Cause your ass is out of this world.                                                                15.


                                MIKE

                You fell for that? That's the stupidest

                line I've ever heard.

                                WAYNE

                        (looking at his phone)

                I've picked up girls with worse lines

                than that.

      LESLIE'S PHONE BEEPS AGAIN.  SHE LOOKS AT IT.

                                  LESLIE

              We just lost the Goldberg Bar Mitzvah. 

                What is going on?  Why are they all

                bailing on us? 

                                  CHARLOTTE

                        (Realizing what's happening)

                Because we were recommended to them by

                Rick. 

                                  LESLIE

                That's right.  Rick's responsible for

                most of our current accounts.  You

                should have said yes!

                                  CHARLOTTE

                Hey, I'm not gonna get married just so

              we can plan the Goldberg Bar Mitzvah. 

                                MIKE

                      (To Jill)

                I can come up with a better pick up

                line than that off the top of my head.                                                                16.


                                JILL

                Let's hear it.

                                MIKE

                Uh...Okay, What's a nice...no,

                wait...Are those angel's...hold on --

                                JILL

                You're an idiot.

                                MIKE

                Give me a second.

      LESLIE'S PHONE BEEPS AGAIN.

                                  LESLIE

                The Williamson party is out. 

                                  CHARLOTTE

                That's Rick's brother-in-law. 

                                  LESLIE

                We're going out of business!

                                  CHARLOTTE

                Would you relax?

                                  LESLIE

                We're event planners, Charlotte. Without

                events we can't plan!

                                  CHARLOTTE

                This is just the initial fall out. 

                This will all be forgotten in the

                morning.

      WAYNE HOLDS UP HIS FINGER.                                                                 17.


                                WAYNE

                That I'm not so sure of. Check it out.

      HE SHOWS THEM HIS PHONE, IT'S PLAYING A "YOUTUBE"
      CLIP OF CHARLOTTE AT THE GAME.

                                  CHARLOTTE

                Where did you find this?

                                WAYNE

                Youtube.  They're calling you the

                "Yankee Bitch".

      THEY HUDDLE AROUND WAYNE'S PHONE.  THEY WATCH FOR
      BEAT.  CHARLOTTE SEES HOW BAD IT WAS.

                                  CHARLOTTE

                Oh, man.  That was really bad. I should

              go talk to him.

                                  YOUTUBE AUDIO (O.S.)

              "I hope we can still be friends."

      WAYNE WINCES AND COVERS HIS CROTCH.

                                MIKE

              Do you clean your pants with Windex? 

                Cause I can see myself in them.  That's

                a good pick-up line!  

      THEY ALL LOOK AT HIM, THE GIRLS ARE DISGUSTED.

                                                              DISSOLVE TO:                                                                18.


                                        ACT ONE

                                      SCENE THREE

      EXT. STREET - AFTERNOON

      CHARLOTTE, LESLIE AND JILL WALK ALONG THE SIDE WALK. 
      JILL IS DRESSED VERY CONSERVATIVELY: HAIR UP, SKIRT
      AND SWEATER, GLASSES. 

      (THROUGHOUT THE SCENE JILL CHANGES HER CLOTHES AND
      PUTS ON MAKE UP, GETTING DOLLED UP FOR HER DATE.)  

                                JILL

                        (Walking and applying blush)

                Why can't we just take a cab?  We're

                all going to the same neighborhood.

                                  CHARLOTTE

                It's eight blocks, Jill.  You'll

                survive.

                                JILL

                It's just that I have to get ready for

              my date with the body painter.  It's

                easier in a cab.

                                  CHARLOTTE

              Do you have any idea what his name is?

                                JILL

              Of course, I do! It's either Tom, Roger

              or something with a "K". 

                                  LESLIE

                Okay, Charlotte. Here's what you do. 

              Go up there and tell him, "Rick, we

                are adults.  The fact that I refused

                your proposal of marriage --                                                                 19.


                                JILL

              In front of the entire world.

                                  LESLIE

              -- Should have no bearing on our

                professional lives." Then you demand

                that he call his contacts and get us

                those accounts back. 

                                  CHARLOTTE

                Leslie, I'm not going over there to

                talk about business.  I feel bad.  You

                saw the way he was crying. 

                                JILL

                Sobbing.

                                  CHARLOTTE

                I'm worried about him.  He hasn't

                returned any of my calls.  I've sent

                texts, e-mails --   

                                JILL

                Maybe he killed himself?

                                  CHARLOTTE

              He didn't kill himself.

                                JILL

                How sexy would that be though?  A guy

                trying to kill himself just because he

                can't have you.  I'd love that.

      THEY ARRIVE AT RICK'S BROWNSTONE.                                                                 20.


                                  CHARLOTTE

                Here it is.

      SHE BUZZES THE DOOR.  JILL REMOVES HER SWEATER, SHE
      IS BRIEFLY IN NOTHING BUT A SKIRT AND BRA.  

                                  LESLIE

                Jill, we're in the middle of the street.

                                JILL

                Hey, man.  I gotta date. I can't show

              up looking like I just graded papers. 

      JILL PUTS ON A TOP AND TAKES HER HAIR DOWN.

                                JILL (CONT'D)

                There.  The transformation it complete.

                                  LESLIE

                You're like the Clark Kent of sluts.

                                  CHARLOTTE

                He's not answering.

                                JILL

                        (Ominously)

                Maybe we're too late. 

      CHARLOTTE OPENS HER PURSE AND TAKES OUT A KEY.

                                  CHARLOTTE

                I'm gonna let myself in.

                                  LESLIE

                Good.  Now, when you talk to him try

                and act sad.  Like you've been having

                a rough night as well.  Match his mood.

                It's a sales technique, works every

                time.                                                                21.


                                JILL

                No!  Act like you're on top of the

                world.  Like he hasn't even entered

                your mind in the past twenty four hours. 

                Guys will do anything for a girl who

                doesn't give a crap about them.

                                  CHARLOTTE

                Guys, please.  I can handle this.

      CHARLOTTE OPENS THE DOOR.

                                JILL

                Charlotte.  After you apologize, give

                him one more tug at the slots.

                                  LESLIE

                Jill!

                                JILL

                It's a consolation prize.

                                  LESLIE

                Actually, it's not a bad idea.  If

                you're really good, he might be more

                disposed to get us those accounts back.

                                  CHARLOTTE

                You've both been very helpful.

      SHE OPENS THE DOOR AND HER FACE GOES SLACK.

                Rick!

      A NICELY FURNISHED GUY'S APARTMENT. MIKE AND WAYNE
      SIT AT A TABLE, EACH HUNKERED DOWN OVER A NOTE PAD,
      WRITING.  CHARLOTTE ENTERS. 

                                  CHARLOTTE

                You are not gonna believe this!  So, I

              go over to Rick's -- 

      MIKE HOLDS UP HIS HAND.

                                MIKE

                Wait!  Don't say anything. We're trying

              to see who can come up with the best

                pick up line.  Ready?  Are you from

                Tennessee?  Because you're the only

                ten-I-see.

                                  CHARLOTTE

                That stinks.  It's terrible.  

                                MIKE

                Really?  It's funny. 

                                  CHARLOTTE

                No, it stinks. 

                                WAYNE

              My turn.  

      WAYNE RISES AND CROSSES TO CHARLOTTE.  HE GETS CLOSE,
      SMILES AND LEANS IN.

                                WAYNE (CONT'D)

                Are you from Tennessee?  Because you're

                the only ten-I-see.                                                                24.


      CHARLOTTE MELTS A BIT. 

                                  CHARLOTTE

                      (A little hot and bothered)

                Actually, it is kinda cute.

                                MIKE

                That's my line! 

                                WAYNE

                I told you, it's not about the line. 

                It's about the delivery.

                                MIKE

                Well, say something that you wrote.

                                WAYNE

                I didn't write anything.

                                MIKE

                What were you doing this whole time?

                                WAYNE

                I was drawing a space ship.

      WAYNE HOLDS UP A POORLY DRAWN SPACE SHIP.  CHARLOTTE
      COMPOSES HERSELF.

                                  CHARLOTTE

                So, guys, listen to this.  I show up

              at Rick's apartment to apologize and -- 

      LESLIE ENTERS.

                                  LESLIE

                Well!  We just lost the Callahan

                account.  You know why?  Cause the

                bride doesn't want the "Yankee Bitch"

              at her wedding.  What happened?                                                                25.


                                  CHARLOTTE

                Well, I went up there --

                                  LESLIE

                Did you apologize to him?

                                  CHARLOTTE

                        (Starting to get frustrated)

                I'm trying to tell you!  People keep

                interrupting me. 

                                  LESLIE

                Sorry.  Go ahead.

                                  CHARLOTTE

                Okay.  So, I go up there.  I let myself

                in.  And get this --

      JILL ENTERS AND THROWS DOWN HER PURSE.

                                JILL

                Get this!  

      CHARLOTTE THROWS HER HANDS UP.

                                JILL (CONT'D)

                So, I go to meet the body painter. 

                                                                  SMASH TO:

      INT. RESTAURANT - EARLIER

      JILL WALKS IN AND SCANS THE ROOM.  THERE IS A BLACK
      GUY, A WHITE GUY, AN ASIAN GUY, A LATINO GUY, AND A
      NATIVE AMERICAN.  SHE HAS NO IDEA WHICH ONE IS THE
      BODY PAINTER.

                                VOICE (O.S.)

                Jill?

      JILL TURNS.  WE DON'T SEE THE "VOICE", WE JUST SEE
      JILL'S REACTION.                                                                  26.


      SHE IS HORRIFIED, BUT TRIES TO SMILE.

                                                                  SMASH TO:

      INT. MIKE AND WAYNE'S PLACE - CONTINUOUS

      THEY ARE ALL IN BREATHLESS ANTICIPATION.

                                  LESLIE

                And?

                                JILL

                Albino!

                                ALL

                Albino?

                                JILL

                Al-bino!

                                                                  SMASH TO:

      INT. RESTAURANT - EARLIER

      JILL STANDS BEFORE THE ALBINO, TALL AND WHITE WITH
      PINK EYES.  SHE IS OBVIOUSLY FREAKED OUT.

                                  ALBINO

                You look hot.

      JILL SMILES AWKWARDLY.

                                                                  SMASH TO:

                                MIKE

                What did you do?

                                JILL

                Well, he sensed that I was a little

                freaked out.

                                                                  SMASH TO:                                                                27.


      INT. RESTAURANT - EARLIER

                                  ALBINO

                What's the matter? Does my translucent

                skin give you the heebie-jeebies? 

                                                                  SMASH TO:

      INT. MIKE AND WAYNE'S PLACE - CONTINUOUS

      THE GROUP IS IN TOTAL DISBELIEF.

                                  CHARLOTTE

              He said that?  He actually used the

                words heebie-jeebies?

                                JILL

                Yup. 

                                WAYNE

                Did it?  Give you the heebie-jeebies,

                I mean?

                                JILL

                Big time. 

                                  LESLIE

                Well, what did you do?

                                JILL

                Well, frankly, I lied.  I said I didn't

                even notice his...albino-ness and we

                had a drink.  Then he asked if he could

                meet up with us later on tonight and I

                said yes.

                                MIKE

                Weren't you freaked out?                                                                28.


                                JILL

                Yeah, but I couldn't tell him the truth! 

                It's like I was hypnotized.  You guys

                have to be there with me tonight. 

                It'll be less creepy if we're all

                together.

                                  LESLIE

                That is wild!

                                  CHARLOTTE

                You want wild?  That story's got nothing

              on what happened to me.

                                JILL

                What happened to you?

                                  CHARLOTTE

                You all might want to sit down for

                this one.

      THEY ALL SIT. 

                                  CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)

                Ready?  So, I go over to Rick's to

                apologize.  I let myself in and, here

              it comes: he was in bed with another

                woman. 

      THERE IS NO VISIBLE REACTION FROM THE GROUP.

                                  CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)

                Guys!  He was having sex with another

                girl.                                                                29.


                                WAYNE

              Of course he was.  

                                MIKE

              He was getting back in the saddle. 

                                  CHARLOTTE

              He cheated on me!

                                  LESLIE

                Honey, technically, you broke up with

                him last night. 

      THE OTHERS NOD IN AGREEMENT.

                                  CHARLOTTE

                Fine. But still, it's a little quick,

                don't you think?    I mean, less than

                twenty-four hours?

                                WAYNE

              If I were him I'd have gotten laid at

                the concession stand last night.

                                  CHARLOTTE

                So, he's completely innocent?

                                  LESLIE

                I think so.  Sorry. 

                                  CHARLOTTE

                Well, that stinks.  He wants to talk

              to me later at the bar.  I was hoping

              we could all be really mad at him.

                                JILL

                Oh, we can be mad at him.                                                                30.


                                  CHARLOTTE

                Really?  You guys would do that for

                me?

                                ALL

                  Absolutely/Sure/You bet.

                                  CHARLOTTE

                You guys are the best.

                How about this: Do you have a map? 

                Cause I just got lost in your eyes.

      THE GIRLS ALL REACT NEGATIVELY.

                                WAYNE

              Do you have a map?  Cause I just got

                lost in your eyes.

      THE GIRLS ALL GIGGLE. 

                                MIKE

                Oh, come on.  It's the same thing.

                                WAYNE

                Michael, it's the singer not the song.

                                MIKE

                That's ridiculous.

                                WAYNE

                I'll bet you a hundred bucks I can

                pick up any woman in this bar with any

                line you write. 

                                MIKE

                Anything I write?                                                                32.


                                WAYNE

                Yup.  It's all in the delivery.

                                MIKE

                You're on. 

      MIKE SCRIBBLES ON A NAPKIN.

                                MIKE (CONT'D)

                There is no way a man could garner a

                woman's interest by saying these words.

      HE SHOWS THEM THE "LINE".  THEY ALL READ IT.

                                  LESLIE

                Okay.  That's just bizarre.

                                  CHARLOTTE

                What would make you write that? 

                                MIKE

                      (To Wayne)

                Any girl, right?  

                        (Mike points)

                Her!

      MIKE'S POINTED TO A STUNNING WOMAN AT THE BAR.

                                WAYNE

                        (Looks from the napkin to

                        the woman)

                Candy from a baby.

      WAYNE TAKES THE NAPKIN AND HEADS OFF.  RICK ENTERS. 
      LESLIE SPOTS HIM.

                                  LESLIE

                Here comes Rick.                                                                33.


                                JILL

                Okay, just play it cool.  Play it cool!

                                MIKE

                What is this?  West Side Story? 

      RICK APPROACHES THE TABLE.

                                  CHARLOTTE

                Hello, Rick.

                                RICK

                I need to talk to you. 

                                JILL

                Tell your story walking, Rick, or Mike's

                gonna kick your ass!

                                MIKE

                What?  No, I'm not.

                                JILL

                Yes, you are.  

                      (To Rick)

                He's not afraid of you, Jackass.

                                MIKE

                Yes, I am.

                                  CHARLOTTE

                Jill!  Please.

      JILL SETTLES DOWN.

                                RICK

                      (To Charlotte)

                Can I talk to you?                                                                34.


                                  CHARLOTTE

              Go ahead.  Talk.

                                RICK

                Alone. 

                                  CHARLOTTE

                      (To her friends)

                Guys, would you excuse us?

      THE FRIENDS LOOK AROUND FOR A BIT.  THE PLACE IS
      EXTREMELY CROWDED.

                                MIKE

                Are you kidding?  This place is packed.  

                                  LESLIE

                We'll never get these couches back

                again if we all leave. 

      THE OTHERS NOD IN AGREEMENT.  CHARLOTTE SIGHS.  

                                  CHARLOTTE

                Fine.

      SHE GETS UP AND CROSSES OFF WITH RICK.

                                JILL

                You better watch yourself, Rick!

                                  LESLIE

                        (Sarcastically to Jill)

                I'm so glad you played it cool.

      WAYNE ACROSS THE BAR - CONTINUOUS

      WAYNE SIDLES UP TO THE STUNNING WOMAN.  SHE IS VERY
      INTIMIDATING.  HE SMILES.  SHE IS NOT INTERESTED.                                                                 35.


                                WAYNE

              In 1775, cancer of the scrotum was a

                common disease among chimney sweeps.

      AFTER A LONG, WEIRD BEAT THE WOMAN SMILES.

                                  STUNNING WOMAN

                        (Totally digging him)

                What's your name?

      WAYNE SLIDES ONTO THE STOOL BESIDE HER.

      CHARLOTTE ACROSS THE BAR: CHARLOTTE STANDS BEFORE
      RICK WITH HER ARMS CROSSED.

                                RICK

                You ran out of there so fast I didn't

                have time to explain.

                                  CHARLOTTE

                Explain what?  What you were doing to

                that woman?  Oh, I didn't need an

                explanation, Rick.

                                RICK

                You know, last night it was very hard.

                                  CHARLOTTE

                Apparently it was "very hard" this

                afternoon, too.

      BACK TO THE LOUNGE: LESLIE AND JILL WATCH CHARLOTTE
      FROM ACROSS THE ROOM.  

                                  LESLIE

                      (RE: Charlotte)

                She looks strong.                                                                 36.


                                JILL

                She looks angry. 

                                  LESLIE

                That's good.  Angry is good. 

      WAYNE APPROACHES, ALL SMILES.

                                WAYNE

                Mike, you mind if I grab that hundred

                from you?  This girl likes her Sangria.

                                MIKE

                How the hell did you pull it off?

                                WAYNE

                Easy.  I'm Wayne.

      MIKE GETS AN IDEA.

                                MIKE

                Double or nothing!

                                WAYNE

                You got a line?

      MIKE SCRIBBLES ON ANOTHER NAPKIN AND HANDS IT TO
      WAYNE.  WAYNE READS IT.

                                WAYNE (CONT'D)

                What's this?

                                MIKE

                The truth.

      WAYNE PUTS THE NAPKIN IN HIS POCKET.

                                WAYNE

                You know, I think I'll just take the

                money and run.                                                                37.


                                MIKE

                You chicken?

                                WAYNE

                No, there are just some thing you don't

                say to a woman.

      CHARLOTTE AND RICK -- CONTINUOUS

                                RICK

                You were my everything, Charlotte. 

                And it was all a lie.

                                  CHARLOTTE

                Lie?  I never lied.  

                                RICK

                It's not that you lied, it's that you

                were dishonest.  

                                  CHARLOTTE

                What?  That's ridiculous!

                                RICK

                You once told me that nine guys have

                proposed to you in your life, right?

                                  CHARLOTTE

                        (Gesturing towards Rick)

                Well, ten now.

                                RICK

                Why do you think we all proposed?  Ten

                guys.  Why?

      SHE THINKS.                                                                38.

                        (Timidly)

                Cause I'm wicked in the sack?

      BACK IN THE LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS

      MIKE, LESLIE AND JILL ARE WATCHING CHARLOTTE AND
      RICK.

                                  LESLIE

                God, Rick sure moves his hands a lot

                when he talks. 

                                MIKE

              He looks mad. 

                                JILL

                It's like he's playing charades.

      A BEAT AS THEY ALL WATCH.

                                  LESLIE

              Be strong, Charlotte.

                                MIKE

                      (RE: Rick's charades)

                I think it's a movie.

                                JILL

                Five words, sounds like --

                                MIKE

                "Children Of A Lesser God".

                                  LESLIE

                Guys, he's not actually playing

                charades.

                                JILL

              Is he doing Bruce Willis?                                                                  39.


                                MIKE

                "Die Hard".

                                JILL

                No. 

                                MIKE

                "The Sixth Sense".

                                VOICE (O.S.)

                Hello.

      THE THREE TURN TO SEE THE ALBINO AND SCREAM AT HIS
      APPEARANCE.

      BACK TO RICK AND CHARLOTTE:

      RICK IS WORKED UP.  HE IS USING HIS HANDS A LOT.

                                RICK

              We all proposed because we thought you

                would say yes.  Why did we think you

                would say yes?  Because you led us to

                believe you'd say yes.  Every time we

                had an opportunity to get closer,

                Charlotte,  you took it.  You were

                dishonest.

      CHARLOTTE'S JAW DROPS.

      BACK IN THE LOUNGE:

      THE ALBINO LOOKS UPSET.  MIKE IS SEVERELY CREEPED
      OUT.

                                JILL

                I'm sorry.  You startled us.                                                                 40.


                                  ALBINO

                You said my translucent skin didn't

                give you the heebie-jeebies. 

                                JILL

              It doesn't.

                                  ALBINO

                Then why would you scream in my face?

                                MIKE

                I thought you were a ghost.

      THE ALBINO IS DISGUSTED.  HE STORMS OFF.  JILL GLARES
      AT MIKE.

                                JILL

                Thanks a lot, Mike.

                                MIKE

                What?  It was scary.

      CHARLOTTE APPROACHES, VERY IRRITATED.

                                  CHARLOTTE

                Rick just called me dishonest.  

                                  LESLIE

                What?

                                  CHARLOTTE

              He said that the reason I've been

                proposed to so many times is that I

                dishonestly lead men to believe I want

                more from them when I really don't.                                                                  41.


                                  LESLIE

                      (To Charlotte)

                Well, remember when you dated Kevin

                the poet?

      THE GROUP MOANS ABOUT KEVIN.

                                  LESLIE (CONT'D)

                You told him that you loved his book

              of poems and that you really thought

              he should get them published. 

                                MIKE

                Those poems sucked.

                                  CHARLOTTE

                I know, but I was trying to be

                supportive.  

                                  LESLIE

                What did he do? He quit his job to

                pursue his dream and popped the

                question. 

                                MIKE

              In the form of a poem.

                                  CHARLOTTE

                So, I'm nice.  Is that a crime?  Being

                nice to crappy poets?

                                JILL

                What about Steve the computer guy?                                                                  42.


                                  LESLIE

                Yeah.  When he asked you to go to the

                Renaissance Festival with him?  You

                didn't say, "You know what, the thought

              of going to a Renaissance Festival

                makes me want to blow my brains out."

                No!  You put on a corset, ate a turkey

                leg the size of a house cat, and shouted

                "Huzzah" every time the Queen went by!

                                  CHARLOTTE

                Going to a Renaissance Festival doesn't

                make me dishonest. 

                                MIKE

              It makes you filthy.

                                  LESLIE

                You never say what you really think,

                Charlotte.  

                                  CHARLOTTE

                That's not true.

                                JILL

                Yes, it is.  You're too sweet.

                                  CHARLOTTE

                I'm an honest person!

                                  LESLIE

                Not when it comes to the tough stuff. 

                You're a big softy.

      CHARLOTTE LOOKS COMPLETELY FRUSTRATED.                                                                43.


                                  CHARLOTTE

                      (To Leslie)

                You need to have more sex!

                                  LESLIE

                Excuse me?

                                  CHARLOTTE

                How's that for honest?  You haven't

                had sex in over a year and you insist

                it's because you work so much.  And

                every time you say that I want to say,

                "No!  That's just an excuse!  You're

                afraid of intimacy."

                                JILL

                        (Enjoying Leslie in the Hot

                        Seat)

                I believe Charlotte is calling you

                frigid.

                                  CHARLOTTE

                        (Still to Leslie)

                You should loosen up.  

      JILL GIGGLES.

                                  CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)

                I mean, don't go crazy.  Don't loosen

              up as much as Jill, but find a nice

                balance.

                                JILL

                Excuse me?                                                                44.


                                  LESLIE

                        (Enjoying the tables turned

                        on Jill)

                I believe Charlotte's calling you a

                whore.

                                  CHARLOTTE

                Jilly, you give your phone number to

                every guy who tells you you're pretty. 

                You gave you're number to a guy who

                was painted from head to toe!  You

                didn't even know what he looked like

                and you still agreed to go out with

                him.

                                JILL

                Looks aren't important to me, Charlotte.

                                MIKE

                Tell that to the albino.

                                JILL

                Shut up, Mike.

                                MIKE

                Charlotte's right.  She's making a lot

                a of sense.

      THE GROUP STARES AT HER FOR A BEAT.

                                  CHARLOTTE

                        (Pointing to Mike)

                Mike's got a weak chin.

      MIKE COVERS HIS CHIN SELF CONSCIOUSLY.                                                                 45.


                                MIKE

                Whoa! How did I get into this?

                                  CHARLOTTE

                You think that it makes you

                  unattractive, but it's all in your

                mind.  You're as good looking as the

                next guy but you have low self esteem

                and girls can smell it on you like

                body odor. 

                                MIKE

                Now, I have body odor?

                                  LESLIE

                Okay, Charlotte, I take it back.  You

                can be honest. 

                                  CHARLOTTE

                And Wayne? 

      SHE LOOKS ACROSS THE BAR AT WAYNE WITH HIS NEW GIRL.

                                  CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)

                Wayne is...just...sexy and spontaneous

                and I can totally see why girls fall

                for him. 

      CHARLOTTE STOPS, SURPRISING HERSELF. SHE CAN'T
      BELIEVE SHE JUST SAID THAT. 

      THE GROUP STARES AT HER IN DISBELIEF.  THEY CAN'T
      BELIEVE SHE JUST SAID THAT. 

      WAYNE WALKS UP HOLDING HIS CELL PHONE.                                                                46.


                                WAYNE

                Check it out.  This girl just took a

                picture of her boobs with my cell phone.

      HE HOLDS UP HIS PHONE.  THE GROUP LOOKS BACK AND
      FORTH BETWEEN THE WAYNE AND CHARLOTTE. 

      IT IS AWKWARD.

                                                                    CUT TO:                                                                47.


                                        ACT TWO

                                      SCENE THREE

      INT. CHARLOTTE'S APARTMENT - LATER

      THE WHOLE GANG SITS ON CHARLOTTE'S COUCH WATCHING
      "THE BUCKET LIST".  THEY'RE EATING ICE CREAM.

                                MIKE

                This movie sucks.  None of these things

                would be on my Bucket List.  If I were

                dying I'd do cool stuff.  Like rob a

                bank, or punch out my boss, or kill a

                shark with a shotgun.  Now, that's a

                Bucket List!

                                  LESLIE

              In no particular order I would get

                fat, meet Oprah, swim with dolphins,

                name a star, adopt a Chinese baby and

                track down Evan Grady, the jerk who

                ditched me at our Senior prom, and

                kick him in the nuts.  

                                  CHARLOTTE

                I'd much rather watch that movie.

                                MIKE

                What about you, Wayne?

                                WAYNE

                I've done everything on my list.

                                MIKE

                No, you haven't.                                                                48.


                                WAYNE

                Listen, when you grow up as rich as I

                did you knock out your Bucket List by

                the time your eighteen.  I'm just glad

                I got it all done before my old man

                cut me off.

                                  LESLIE

                There's got to be something you'd do.

                                WAYNE

                Fine.  A fivesome.

                                  LESLIE

                Fivesome?

                                WAYNE

                Like a threesome, but with five.

                                  LESLIE

                Why not just a threesome?

                                WAYNE

                Because a Bucket List is about doing

                things you haven't done.

                                  LESLIE

                A foursome?

                                WAYNE

                I repeat.  A Bucket List is about doing

                things you haven't done.

                                JILL

                Charlotte, what's on your Bucket List?                                                                49.


                                  CHARLOTTE

                Oddly, I'd like to get married. 

      THERE'S A SWEET SILENCE.

                                  CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)

                Again, guys, I'm so sorry I said all

                that horrible stuff before.  I didn't

                mean any of it.

                                WAYNE

                What exactly did you say?

                                MIKE

                She said that I have body odor and a

                weak chin.

                                JILL

                        (Teasing)

                That's not all she said, Wayne.

                                  CHARLOTTE

                Okay!  It's not important what I said. 

                What's important is that I'm not gonna

              be honest anymore.  You guys are my

                friends and you don't deserve that. 

      WAYNE LOOKS AT HIS PHONE. 

                                WAYNE

                All right, Mike, let's hit it.  This

                kid needs his beauty rest.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                50.


                                WAYNE (CONT'D)

                        (Holds up his phone)

                I've got a date with these boobs

                tomorrow night and I want to be as

                perky as they are.

      THE WHOLE GROUP RISES AND HEADS FOR THE DOOR.  

                                MIKE

                I'm gonna have nightmares about that

                albino.  His red eyes are seared into

              my brain. 

      THEY ALL STOP AND FACE CHARLOTTE.

                                  LESLIE

                You gonna be okay?

                                  CHARLOTTE

                Yeah, I'll be fine.  Thanks.

      THEY ALL EXIT.  CHARLOTTE STANDS FOR A BEAT IN HER
      LIVING ROOM.  THERE'S A KNOCK,  WAYNE ENTERS. 

                                WAYNE

                I left my foam finger here. 

      HE CROSSES TO THE COUCH AND GRABS IT.  HE HEADS
      TOWARDS THE DOOR. 

                                  CHARLOTTE

                What was written on that napkin that

                Mike gave you?

                                WAYNE

                The one thing I wouldn't say to a girl

                I was trying to impress.                                                                51.


                                  CHARLOTTE

                What's that?

      WAYNE REMOVES THE NAPKIN FROM HIS POCKET.

                                WAYNE

                        (Reading)

                "My name is Wayne Rutherford.  My father

              is a billionaire.  Eighteen months ago

              he cut me off.  I've never held a job

                and I have no money.  I sleep on my

                friend's couch and have no idea what

                I'm gonna do with the rest my life."

      WAYNE STARES HEAVILY AT THE NAPKIN.  FOR A MOMENT
      HE IS UNCHARACTERISTICALLY VULNERABLE.

                                WAYNE (CONT'D)

                Now, would that line work on you?

      THE LOOK ON CHARLOTTE'S FACE SHOWS THAT IT ACTUALLY
      MIGHT WORK ON HER.

                                  CHARLOTTE

                        (Shaking it off)

                You're right.  That would never work. 

      WAYNE HEADS FOR THE DOOR.  HE TURNS. 

                                WAYNE

                Rick's wrong, you know.  Those guys

                didn't propose cause you were dishonest. 

                And they didn't propose cause you're

                wicked in the sack.

      CHARLOTTE SMILES.                                                                52.


                                WAYNE (CONT'D)

                There's only one reason they all want

                you to be their wife.

                                  CHARLOTTE

                What is it?

                                WAYNE

                You don't know?

      SHE SHAKES HER HEAD.

                                WAYNE (CONT'D)

                It's because you're Charlotte Payne.

      HE TOUCHES HER NOSE WITH THE FOAM FINGER.  HE EXITS.

      INT. SOULMATES.COM OFFICE -- AFTERNOON

      ANDREW LISTENS TO CHARLOTTE.  HE IS RAPT.

                                  CHARLOTTE

                So, yes.  To answer your question, I

                consider myself an honest person. 

                Most of the time. 

                                  ANDREW

                What ever happened to the albino?

                                  CHARLOTTE

                Turns out he was a software engineer,

                sold his company for ninety million

                dollars and started dating a supermodel. 

                                  ANDREW

                And Rick?

                                  CHARLOTTE

                I hear he's getting married.   

                                  ANDREW

                Okay, I'm gonna be honest with you, at

                first I thought you were, like, a total

                snooze-fest.  Most of these interviews

                make me want to chew on a bullet, but

                that was, like, the awesomest answer

                I've ever heard in the four years I've

                been giving this stupid test.

                                  CHARLOTTE

                Well, thanks.                                                                 54.


                                  ANDREW

                Have you ever been arrested?

                                  CHARLOTTE

                Why would you ask that?

                                  ANDREW

                It's the next question on the test.

                                  CHARLOTTE

                Oh.

      CHARLOTTE THINKS FOR A BEAT.

                                  CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)

                Funny story, actually...

      ANDREW SMILES, HE'S DYING TO HEAR THIS ONE.
