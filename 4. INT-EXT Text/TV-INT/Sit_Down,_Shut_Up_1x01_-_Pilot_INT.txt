    MIRACLE is driving. (Beautiful, spiritual, the  Airhead. )  
    Her field of view is crowded by all manner of spiritual totems

    blue 3-dsunglasses.  He shifts wildly, as we HEAR the engine 
    rev and race and the squealing of tires. 


    THE ENGINE SOUNDS ARE NOW FULL VOLUME again as Stuart pulls 
    his car to a stop (next to and blocking Willard.)  Stuart pops 
    a tape out of the cassette deck and the ENGINE SOUNDS STOP.

    ANGLE ON the cassette, labeled "The Sounds of Nascar."  Stuart 
    looks up and notices something.  ANGLE ON a sign that reads; 
    IMPORTANT MESSAGE TO STUDENTS.  FLU SHOTS, MONDAY.  Stuart 
    approaches it and rearranges some letters. 

                                STUART
                  There.  Much funnier. 

    SUE approaches in her car. (The  Grown Up. )  

                                SUE
                  Excuse me.  That s not your spot.  
                  Perhaps you couldn t tell because of 
                  your... poor choice of eyewear.

                                STUART
                  Can you believe it?  They were just 
                  giving these away for free out of 
                  this dumpster behind the movie 
                  theater.  They really make people 
                  stick out and look kind of koo-koo, 
                  though.

                                SUE
                  Yes, I m noticing that.  I also see 
                  that you ve parked your car in the 
                  spot reserved for the principal.  And 
                  you re not the principal.  You re a 
                  man with garbage on your face. 

                                STUART
                  Oh, yes.  I thought that would be 
                  fine since the principal s still out 
                  because of the... (makes clawing air

                                SUE
                  Yes, well, what you perhaps don t 
                  know is that I m the acting principal 
                  in his absence.                                                                                       6

                  Yeah, it is a little formal, Sue.  
                  Sue, is there a nickname for Sue?  
                  Something shorter than Sue, like Su--  
                  "Se", maybe.  Or (barely a sound now, 
                  yet it actually takes longer to say) 
                  "hs."  Just as a timesaver, hs?

                                SUE
                  Okay, well, why don't we start 
                    with..."Acting Principal Sezno" and 
                  once we're further into the semester 
                  we can replace you.  But right now 
                  let s move that car.

                                STUART
                  I'd love to, but once I've stopped 
                  her running she won't start again for 
                  six hours.  It's not much of a car, 
                  but you sure wouldn't know it when I 
                  have my Nascartape in.  Great!

    Stuart starts off.

                                SUE
                  Stuart, has anyone ever told you that 
                  you're completely oblivious?

                                STUART
                  Not that I'm aware of, hs.Not that 
                  I'm aware of.

    Stuart exits, right through the pile of leaves that Happy has 
    swept up, probably due to the sunglasses.  Happy seethes.

    with a STARVING ETHIOPIAN BOY (her own baby is on her back.)

    point of taking away her students lunches and throwing them in 
    the trash.

    The starving Ethiopegoes for the trash bin, but not before 
    Miracle has poured Pine Sol in after it.

                  Wow... that s really noble of you, 
                  Miracle.  Yeah, anything.                                                                                      8

                  students, you, me, the baby, and...

                  Whoa, wait... You re not going to 
                  feed the baby?  

                                MIRACLE
                  I know, it s not going to be easy.  I 
                  was thinking of pouring pine sol on 
                  my chest. 

    The baby just puts his head in hand.

                                LARRY
                  That s idiotic.  You can t do that!  
                  Are you that stupid?!

    The baby shakes his head yes, as Miracle shakes hers  No.   

                                MIRACLE
                  Only to talk to you!  You re the 
                  worst... P.E. teacherin the world!

    She runs off. Sue approaches Larry, who feels bad. 

                                SUE
                  Larry.  I was hoping to find you.  I 
                  have some rather disturbing news 
                  about something Happy found in one of 
                  your student athlete s lockers. 

    Sue hands Larry a large pill bottle to a distracted Larry.

                                SUE (CONT D)

                                LARRY
                  Huh?  Okay, but just to help me deal 
                  with the disturbing news.

    Larry pops the top off and throws a couple in his mouth.  He 
    crosses to the water fountain.

                                LARRY (CONT'D)

                  The drugs, Larry.  The ones in your 
                  mouth.

    Larry spits them out, aghast.

                                LARRY
                  I had those in my mouth!

                                SUE
                  I think you're missing some of the 
                  subtlety of my point.  There are 
                  children using drugs in this school. 

                                LARRY
                  (This hits Larry.)  Wow. (then)  And 
                  you don t think it s just a Ritalin 
                  or an Adderal... or some other 
                  approved form of child narcotic?

                                SUE
                  No, this isn t just some of run-of-

                                LARRY
                  Well, let s not overreact.  It could 
                  just be a baby-Thorazine -- Of course 
                  it wasn t bubblegumflavored.  (then)  
                  Maybe a DarvosetJr?

                  there s no Bear with a cloud over 
                  him.

    Larry struggles to depict what we ve just seen -- sticking his 
    chest out, and folding his arms like chicken wings behind him 
    and inside his shirt, pointing his tongue.  Then.

                                SUE
                  And you realize she has a baby.  

                                LARRY
                  Yeah, I didn t know where to put that 
                  in there.  Maybe on one of the back 
                  breasts.  But it doesn t matter that 
                  she has a baby.  The problem is every 
                  time I try to talk to her I get so 
                  frustrated I end up lashing out.

                                SUE
                  Well, she suspects that these are 
                  performance enhancing steroids and 
                  thinks some of your athletes are 
                  taking them.

                                LARRY
                  (Lashing out) What?  What does that 
                  quad-jugged freak know about 
                  pharmacology?                                                                                      11

                                LARRY (CONT'D)
                  My kids aren't on steroids.  It's 
                  impossible.  They're crapat every 
                  sport they try.

    QUICK MONTAGE SHOWS 

    1.) A pole vaulter running to vault, but planting the pole 
    which jams him in the stomach into a stop.  Larry calmly pulls 
    it out after which the child falls over.  (a sign in the b.g.
    reads:  Start treating Weak Urinary Stream disorder beforeit 
    happens. Flospray!  500mgEr.)

    2.) Kids on the deck of a pool in water polo helmets.  Larry 
    blows a whistle and they leap into the pool not be seen again, 
    while their helmets float to the top.  Larry calmly gets out a 
    pool scooper.(sign reads: Itchy down there?  Invite in an 
    InvisiTickle! as welcome as a Doctor s index finger. )  

    3.) A boy with a rifle waits next to a skeet machine.  Larry 
    yells pull.  anda skeet flies out.  The boy shoots the 
    machine.  Larry motions calmly  give me the gun.   (sign
    reads:  Feeling left out there s no drug for you?   SIDE-
    EFFEXOR-- twice the side effects, none of the fix! Tapletor 
    Cabsule.) Back to action. 

                                LARRY (CONT D)
                  No, these are performances that have 
                  not been enhanced.  I mean we have 
                  two football players out with 
                  injuries from the last coin toss.  

                                SUE
                  That freshman with the equal-length 
                  legs is pretty good at football.  
                  That red haired kid.

                                LARRY
                    Who..."red-haired kid? 

                                SUE
                  I think that's his name.

                                LARRY
                  Well, sure he's good.  He's twenty-
                  three years old. (remembering) "Red 
                  haired Man."

                                SUE
                  That'swhat it is.

                                LARRY
                  Believe me, if I could get the other 
                  kids to play as well as he does we 
                  actually might have a shot at winning 
                  the big game on Thursday.  (then)  
                  Hey, let s give them the  roids. 
                  (off her look)  It s not exactly 
                  going to be a federal case.

    Cut to a US SENATE Yearbook.  We see a picture of George 
    Mitchell over the words.                                                                                      12

                                SUE
                  Still, they can lead to thinning of  
                  the hair, shorten the temper, shrink 
                  the testicles... (then, realizing)  
                  Larry, do you take steroids?

                                LARRY
                  (Snapping) There s nothing wrong with 
                  my hair!  Look, Sue--you'rethe 
                  acting Principal, if our team does 
                  well this week it might generate some 
                  interest in our school.  You've been 
                  trying to raise funds for new 
                  books...

                                SUE
                  Teachers, but go on...

                                LARRY
                  If we won a game we might be able to 
                  raise some money.  Plus it might make 
                  me look like a winner to Miracle.

                                SUE
                  Well... we d have to test them on 
                  somebody first.  A faculty member -- 
                  But who s that going to be, it could 
                  make them horribly sick?

    Stuart crosses in.

                                STUART
                  Hey, Larry, hs.I thought you'd like 
                  to know.  (startsoff then) Oh, by 
                  the way, if it looks like there's a 
                  scratch on your fender, it's actually 
                  just a dent.  Great!

    Stuart exits.  

                                SUE
                  (to Larry) Well, come on.  Let's get 
                  those drugs in him.


    Willard is there with a large paper sack.  He looks guilty.  
    Stuart enters and goes to his locker.  

                                WILLARD
                  Hey, Stuart... can I grab you for a 
                  second.  Just privately.  You know, 
                  man to man.                                                                                    13


                                STUART
                  (scoffs)  Oh, sorry, I m not really 
                  into that kind of thing.  I ll watch 
                  youthough. 

                                WILLARD
                  Watch me--  No, I just meant... can 
                  we talk? 

                                STUART
                  Oh.  Sure.  I don t have any cash on 
                  me anyway.  You do that while I 
                  change.     

    Stuart starts taking off his scarf and glasses over the 
    following. 

                                WILLARD
                  Well...I was at the local newsstand 
                  this morning...


                                WILLARD
                  I grabbed a couple of cooking 
                  magazines but I think he noticed. 
                  God, I'm so ashamed.

                                STUART
                  Hey, there's no need to be ashamed.    
                  Everyone enjoys food.  Sure it's 
                  strange to read a magazine about it, 
                  but it's not like you were buying 
                  pornography. 

                                WILLARD
                  No...that iswhat happened.  One of 
                  the students caught me buying 
                  pornography.

                                STUART
                  Oh, I missed that.  Must have been 
                  while I was changing.  Do the story 
                  again and this time I'll really 
                  focus.                                                                                    14


    Stuart  focuses.   Willard is exasperated.

                                WILLARD
                  One of the students caught me buying 
                  pornography. 

                                STUART
                  Got it that time!  (highfive, then)  
                  No, you should definitely be ashamed 
                  of that.  You had it right. 

                                WILLARD
                  I'm a lonely man, okay?  And if this 
                  gets out, I m ruined.  And you know 
                  how kids spread lies.  Especially 
                  when they re true.  

                                STUART
                  (tch.) Kids.  (then)  All right, well 
                  this is an easy one.  You just avoid 
                  being in any place where Sue is that 
                  there are also students.

                                WILLARD
                  But... I m a teacher here.  

                                STUART
                  That show I know you!

                                WILLARD
                  Look, Sue s been looking for another 
                  reason to get rid of me -- I m one 
                  month away from tenure.  She s never 
                  been in favor of the German 
                  requirement at this school.

                                STUART
                  I didn t even know kid s learned 
                  German here.

                                WILLARD
                  No one ever actually has.  Which is 
                  probably something else she s going 
                  to try to use against me.  I don t 
                  know... maybe I am too old to still 
                  be connecting with the kids.  (then)  
                  Dammit, why didn t I sign up for the 
                  internet when I got that shiny free 
                  coaster thingy in the mail! (then)  
                  Can you just throw the magazines out 
                  for me?  No one knows you. You ll be 
                  fine. 

    Stuart puts out his hand.  A relieved Willard hands Stuart the 
    bag.  Stuart flips through and focuses on one picture in 
    particular.

                                WILLARD (CONT D)
                  Thanks, Stuart.  Just keep my name 
                  out of it.  If anyone asks...                                                                                    15


                                STUART
                  Hey, I don t know what the hell this 
                  is.

    Willard smiles and pats him on the back, then takes off.  
    Stuart continues to stare at the picture deeply confused.

                                STUART (CONT D)
                  (deeply confused)  I mean, what the 
                  hell is that thing?

    Stuart puts on the his 3-dglasses. 

                                STUART (CONT D)
                  (then, delighted)  Oh, it s a dog s 
                  nipple!

    Stuart looks up surprised to see Willard gone and some 
    students standing before him.

                                STUART (CONT D)
                  Oh, this is just Willard 
                    Deutschebog'sporn. 

    He smiles at the kids.  They look nervous.  He flips the 
    picture around to show them.  They look horrified.  A beat.  
    He turns the picture to us.  It s pretty awful.  (chyron

    THAT DAY

    Students sit quietly in an empty class room.  They listen to 
    Sue over the P.A. system.

                                SUE (OVER P.A.)
                  ...sowhile faculty attend this 
                  mandatory meeting, students are 
                  encouraged to sit quietly in prayer.  


    The teachers are there.  Sue speaks into a P.A. mic.

                                SUE 
                  For those of you who are  separation 
                  of Church and State  buffs, please 
                  feel free to engage in evolution.

                  Evolution.  There s a concept I wish 
                  I could believe in.

                                SUE
                  Well, the good news is you re just 
                  the science teacher.  Now if we can 
                  get this  law of gravity  repealed it 
                  can pretty much just be a free 
                  period.                                                                                     16


                                STUART
                  More time for us to float around.

                                SUE
                  Anyway, thank you for coming.  I know 
                  that Principal Kevin never made you 
                  go to meetings, but as you know, 
                  Kevin is still recuperating from his 
                  (air quotes)  lacerations.   

    The teachers grimace and recall the horror.

                                ANDREW
                  I should have never tried to adapt 
                  Edward Scissorhandsfor the stage.  
                  He completely ruined my show.

                                HELEN
                  Well, it was more like a tie.  
                  Anyway, I m on the job and I m trying 
                  to clean up some of his mess.  As you 
                  may know we didn t exactly  kick ass  
                  with regard to  No Child Left Behind  
                  standards.  

                                STUART
                    (Instinctively barking) Kick ass!  

    All cheer.

                                SUE
                  Okay, my fault, I should never have 
                  used such provocative language.  The 
                  point is they ve cut back our 
                  funding.  

    Larry enters.

                                SUE (CONT D)
                  To that end, we have the big game 
                  Thursday.  And we need to win, so I'm 
                  assigning Stuart Proszakianto work 
                  with Larry as the assistant coach.  
                  Larry, do you have those  vitamins  
                  for Stuart? 

                                LARRY
                  Right here. 

    Sue winks to Larry.  Larry winks back, then turns to look at 
    Stuart.  Stuart winks at Larry.  Larry looks confused.

                                SUE
                  I want everyone to show his or her 
                  support and be at that game.  
                  Teachers and students.  Any 
                  questions?

                                WILLARD
                  Does that include teachers?                                                                                    17


                                SUE
                  Yes, Willard, it does.  I should have 
                  mentioned that.

    Willard looks to Stuart, worried.  Stuart calms him with a 
    wink.  Sue notices the wink and looks at Stuart. Stuart winks 
    at her, then indicates Willard should do the same.  He 
    reluctantly does so. 

                                ANDREW
                  You know, Stuart's new here.  I 
                  should be Larry s assistant coach.  
                  I m the one who really knows him.  
                  His ups and downs.  His ins and outs.  
                  His chest, neck, hips, and pecks.

                                SUE
                  What s your point, Andrew.

                                ANDREW
                  I should be the assistant coach.  I 
                  mean, I know what the man looks like 
                  naked for God's sake.

                                LARRY
                  You do? 

                                ANDREW
                  Well, not yet--butthat just supports 
                  my point. 

                                SUE
                  No, I'd like Stuart to spend some 
                  time with Larry.

    Andrew fumes in jealousy, and shoots daggers at Stuart.  
    Stuart winks to Andrew in response.  Andrew, unable to resist, 
    winks back to Stuart, hating himself for the weakness.

                                SUE (CONT D)
                  But we still need money.  Now it s 
                  come to my attention that in 1991 
                  there was a time capsule planted on 
                  this campus.  


                                STUART
                  God, what a crazy time.  What must 
                  that have been like?!


                                SUE
                  So I'll shortly be assigning someone 
                  to dig for the time capsule. (a 
                  moment, then) Helen, you'll be 
                  digging for the time capsule.

                                HELEN
                  No fair.

                                SUE
                  I m sorry, Helen.  But you re the 
                  librarian.  And should something 
                  happen to you God Forbid we could 
                  always start just using Google.

                                HELEN
                  That s not true.  I also have 
                  philosophy seminars.                                                                                      19

                                HELEN (CONT'D)
                  We had an amazing night discussing 
                  the meaning of reality.


    Helen is before the students.

                                HELEN
                  So what is reality?  Well, to help us 
                  answer that please welcome Fox 
                  programming executive, Mike Darnell.

    Mike takes the podium.

                                MICHAEL
                  Okay, you ve all filled out your 
                  releases, now who s ready to try out 
                  for  Who s Tougher than a Five Foot 
                  Millionaire? 

    The kids look confused.  Mike notices one has a sandwich and 
    dives for it, but Miracle has appeared and covered it with 
    pine sol.


                                SUE
                  Nonetheless, Helen, you ve been 
                  chosen.  Of course you will most 
                  likely be missing the game.  

                                HELEN
                  Great, first the Daytime Emmysparty 
                  gets cancelled and now this. 

                                MIRACLE
                  You know, for what it s worth, I ve 
                  heard that this school is built on an 
                  old Micmac Indian burial ground
                  so there s always the chance that 
                  you ll unlock the secrets of living 
                  your life over again.

                                HELEN
                  (more annoyed)  Great, so I ll have 
                  to dig for it twice. 

                                WILLARD
                  You know, I don t mind missing the 
                  game.  I can dig for it.

                                SUE
                  Oh, please, you wouldn t know which 
                  end of the shovel to hold.

                                WILLARD
                  Which end of the what, now?

                                SUE
                  So.  Anything else?                                                                                     20


                                STUART
                  Yeah, I just wanted to say that I'm 
                  really glad that we're winking in 
                  these meetings now because it makes 
                  it a lot of fun.  And I can't say I 
                  completely get whywe're winking, but 
                  let's just keep it up.  Great!  
                  (winks.No reaction.  A moment, 
                  then)  Okay, I see no one's winking 
                  anymore and I just wanted to say that 
                  I'm secretly glad we've stopped 
                  because I never quite  got  why we 
                  were doing it in the first place.

    Larry reenters with pill bottle as teachers file out. 

                                SUE
                  Larry, you better go easy on the 
                  steroids.  Stuart's starting to act a 
                  little unstable.

                                LARRY
                  I haven't given them to him yet.

                                SUE
                  Okay, well let's get moving on that.

    desk, crotch first.  No reaction.  


    Sue is talking into a Dictaphone, when Andrew enters.

                                SUE
                  ...also the staff needs to know that 
                  my door is always open...

                                ANDREW
                  Acting Principal Sezno?Can I talk 
                  to you for a second?

    Sue holds up a polite finger while she finishes her thoughts.

                                SUE
                  ...so have Happy install a locking 
                  latch so people don't just come in 
                  unannounced.

    Sue clicks off the Dictaphone, then answers Andrew s question.  

                                SUE (CONT'D)
                  No.

                                ANDREW
                  I'd like to work with the girls.

                                SUE
                  Well, that's a change.

                                ANDREW
                  The cheerleaders.  I told them I'll 
                  be taking over the squad.

                                SUE
                  Oh, Andrew.  Must you have?

                                ANDREW
                  I don't "must I have'd"  I have to'd. 
                  I want to contribute, not that I'm 
                  saying I'm a better rallierthan 
                  Stuart, but obviously he does 
                  something for Larry.  I've also 
                  offered to do things for Larry, but 
                  he's obviously not fluent in the 
                  language of double-entendre.Or 
                  "saying something that's secret or 
                  super-sexy, but that seems regular."                                                                                    23


                                SUE
                  I'm familiar with the term.

                                ANDREW
                  Oh, goody.  So, have I not your 
                  blessing?  

                                SUE
                  No.

                                ANDREW
                  I'll take that as a yes!  Isn't it 
                  funny how when you speak 
                  grammatically correct it sometimes 
                    wouldn t vehad hadn t a sound 
                  incorrect?

    Andrew shake his head at the wonderful puzzle of it and exits.  
    Sue returns to the Dictaphone.

                                SUE
                  Let's also get Andrew on steroids.


    Willard is drilling his German class.

                                WILLARD
                  Again guys, come on.  It s been a 
                  whole semester and we re not even out 
                  of the A s.   Auf Wiedersehen.   One 
                  of the most basic German phrases 
                  there is.   Goodbye.   

                                STUDENTS
                  (barely) Goodbye.

                                WILLARD
                  No, that was the English.  And some 
                  of you got that wrong.  Just  Auf ... 
                  Say  Auf  

                                STUDENTS
                  (various, lifeless) Auf...

                                WILLARD
                  Auf!

                                STUDENTS
                  Auf.  Auf...

    Stuart is passing the class and looks in to see the students 
    say their  Auf s.  He bursts through the door, outraged.

                                STUART
                  How dare you laugh at this man!  Your 
                  laughter makes me sick!  It doesn't 
                  even sound like laughter!  Yes, Mr. 
                  Deutschebogbuys pornography!                                                                                      24

                                STUART (CONT'D)
                  Yes, he's chosen some obscure titles 
                  like "Nothing but Fuzz," "Wet and 
                  Jiggly" and "Giant Prawns."  But he s 
                  a homely little gripper and you have 
                  no right to judge him!

    Stuart storms out.  Willard is stunned.  Stuart bursts back in 
    looking through the sack of pornography.

                                STUART (CONT'D)
                  Sorry, "Giant Prawns" is one of his 
                  cooking magazines.  So, instead of 
                  that one let's say... (riffles 
                  through titles)   Squatting.  

    Stuart exits.  The students explode in laughter.

    ANGLE ON: Stuart outside the door. 

                                STUART (CONT D)
                  At least that sounds like laughter.


    A nervous Helen is crouched.  We hear footsteps approaching.


    Mamoudwith a fumigation tank on his bank sprays past a row of 
    lockers.  We hear a THUMP from within one of them.  


    Happy is digging horizontally now and comes to something hard.  
    He brushes the dirt off what appears to be a sign.

    ANGLE ON: Sign.  It reads "MICMAC INDIAN BURIAL TEMPLE (AND 
    KINO!)SECRETS OF IMMORTALITY CONTAINED WITHIN.  DO NOT 
    ENTER!"  

    Music swells as we fade out.

                                  END OF ACT TWO                                                                                    26


                                      ACT THREE


    Happy reads the sign "MYSTICAL INDIAN BURIAL TEMPLE.  SECRETS 
    OF IMMORTALITY CONTAINED WITHIN.  DO NOT ENTER!"

    He doesn't.  Instead, unfazed, he begins digging in another 
    direction.


    Stuart and Larry are returning from the field.

                                LARRY
                  Well, that was another disastrous 
                  practice.

                                STUART
                  Yes, but on the plus side I think 
                  I've got the defensive linemen being 
                  a lot more open and, frankly, a lot 
                  less defensive.

    Larry notices Miracle across the way.

                                LARRY
                  Oh, great.  There she is.  Miracle.  
                  An angel whose eyes are like...lips 
                  sucking on my...soul's neck.

                                STUART
                  Really?  I could never get my wife to 
                  do that.

                                LARRY
                  I wish I knew how to talk to her.  
                  But I always end up blowing it like 
                  the stupid PEteacher that I am.

                                STUART
                  Really?  I could never get my PE
                  teacher to do that.  Look, maybe it's 
                  just the vitamins talking, but you 
                  want to see this girl, you know?                                                                                      27

                                STUART (CONT'D)
                    And...(tearing up) she probably wants 
                  to see you... (more tears) and I want 
                  to see you see her and watchthe love 
                  happen!

    Stuart is overcome.

                                LARRY
                  You're really a good guy, you know 
                  that Stuart?

                                STUART
                  ...or I could maybe film it, so I ve 
                  got a copy, in case one of us is ever 
                  unavailable, but you need to tell her
                  how you feel! 

    Stuart sobs.  Then pops some vitamins.  Larry looks concerned.  
    And a little guilty.

                                LARRY
                  Listen, Stuart... I don t feel right 
                  about this.  There's something I 
                  didn't tell you about those vitamins 
                  before.  They're actually drugs.   
                  Happy found them in a kid's locker.

    Stuart spits them out.

                                STUART
                  A locker!  Did Sue put you up to 
                  this?

                                LARRY
                  Okay, now you're being paranoid.  But 
                  yes, she did.  

                                STUART
                  Well, they re probably just mega-
                  sedatives, or anti-sociopaths.  Was 
                  there a sleepy looking raccoon on the 
                  bottle? 

                                LARRY
                  No, we think they re steroids.  Look, 
                  I feel awful about it.  But she made 
                  me try them out on you before we 
                  could give them to the kids -- to 
                  help them win. 

                                STUART
                  Well, I guess if it's for the kids.  
                  But isn't it true they cause birth 
                  defects?

                                LARRY
                  Only in babies.

                                STUART
                  Well, as long as I'm out of the 
                  danger zone.  (then, all bravado) Now 
                  go.  Talk to that girl!                                                                                    28


    Stuart sends Larry off, who approaches Miracle. 

                                LARRY
                  Oh, hey Miracle.  

                                MIRACLE
                  Hi.  Here's a list of all the 
                  students that are involved in the 
                  four day famine.  Just in case some 
                  are in your class.

    Larry looks at the list.

                                LARRY
                  That's a familiar name.

                                MIRACLE
                  Oh, yeah.  He's been here for years.  
                  He's a freshman.

                                LARRY
                  With red hair?  (offnod)  You've got 
                  "Red Haired Man" on your famine?  
                  (readson) You've got half of my 
                  football team on this list.  No 
                  wonder they've been so lethargic.  
                  Why would you do this?

                                MIRACLE
                  Look, Larry.  I'm idealistic, okay?  
                  That means I believe in doing things 
                  that are unrealistic or have no 
                  effect.  That's whoIam!

                                LARRY
                  But this was our chance to shine.  
                  You've destroyed this with your 
                  stupid famine!  You idiot!  You're a 
                  total idiot!

    Miracle runs off, upset.  Stuart approaches.

                                STUART
                  So, did you tell her how you feel 
                  about her?

    Larry realizes that he forgot.

                                LARRY
                  Oh, shoot.

    Larry looks after her, but she's gone.  Stuart pops another 
    pill.  Then cries.  Larry looks concerned.


    Sue is addressing the faculty.  Helen is absent.

                                SUE
                  No, it turns out we lost.  Apparently 
                  there's some sort of State athletic 
                  standard that disallows game winning 
                  tackles by school librarians.  

                                LARRY
                  I was actually surprised to see that 
                  had come up before. 

                                ANDREW
                  This was my fault.  I should have 
                  done more work with the cheerleaders.

                                LARRY
                  It wasn't your fault, Andrew.  If 
                  anything it was that moron Miracle's 
                  fault with her thick-headed famine.

    Miracle hangs her head ashamed.  Larry mouths "I love you."

                                STUART
                  Besides Andrew, you did a great job.  
                  You know how kids are.  They don't 
                  want quality dance.  At that age they 
                  just want to stare at my heaving 
                  breasts.  (then)  Well, these are 
                  new. 

                                SUE
                  Yes, I think I've gotten to the 
                  bottom of this.  It seems Miracle 
                  misidentified some pills that Stuart 
                  was taking as steroids, when, in 
                  fact, they were female hormone 
                  replacements.

                                MIRACLE
                  That's the word I was looking for.

                                SUE
                  Of course we still don't know who 
                  they belonged to.  And we certainly 
                  don't want to embarrass anyone.

    Helen enters covered in mud holding a bound package.

                                HELEN
                  I found the time capsule!

    The Teachers cheer as Helen starts cutting it open.                                                                                    34


                                SUE
                  Nice job, Helen.  Oh, by the way, 
                  when you were crouching in that boys 
                  locker you left your hormone 
                  replacement pills.

                                HELEN
                  Oh, yeah...I stopped taking those.  
                  (then)  I guess that explains my 
                  recent love of tackling and digging.

                                STUART
                  So, if I stop taking the pills these 
                  hideous breasts will go away?

                                SUE
                  I assume so.

    A moment as Stuart thinks about this.  Then proudly decides;

                                STUART
                  Then I'm going to stop taking them.

    Sue rolls her eyes.  Helen has unwrapped the package.

                                HELEN
                  I give you, the time capsule.

    Applause as Sue reaches in and pulls out some magazines.  She 
    reads the titles, appalled.

                                SUE
                  "Pacific Rim?"..."The Knob 
                      Hobbyist?"..."Spurts Illustrated?"

                                STUART
                  Wow.  I can't believe you found that 
                  so quickly.  I just had Happy bury 
                  all that pornography yesterday for 
                  Willard.

    All eyes turn to a feebly defensive Willard.

                                WILLARD
                  Actually, "Pacific Rim" is a cooking 
                  magazine.

                                SUE
                  Oh, Willard.  You poor lonely man.  
                  (then)  You're fired.

    Willard is devastated.  He looks to Stuart.  Stuart winks.

                                  END OF ACT THREE
