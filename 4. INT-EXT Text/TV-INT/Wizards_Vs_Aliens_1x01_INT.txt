    ROBERT and MARK open their eyes - come face to face with -

  An alien creature - a NEKROSS. VARG - In its hand is a gun - 
    hard-core yet strange tech. It s very alien and deadly. 

                                VARG
                  Earthlings. Welcome to the starship  
                  Zarantulus.

                                ROBERT
                  What - what do you want?

    Varg s head trunks twitch and react to the wizards.

                                VARG
                  Magic!

  Varg closes. Robert and Mark scream!

                                                                          CUT TO:

    MICHAEL dumps his medical bag and pulls a bottle of cola from 
  the fridge, still lecturing TOM.

                                MICHAEL
                  You have to be more careful, son. 
                  Magic isn t for cheating at 
                  football or for doing your chores 
                  around the house.

  As URSULA (a 64 year old firework with reading glasses 
    perched on her head) walks in. Gives Tom a friendly wink.

                                URSULA
                  Well that s fine coming from an 
                  Unenchanted with no Magic. What 
                  have you been up to, Tom.





                                                                          (CONTINUED)

                I used a spell. To help score a 
                  goal. It got us through to the cup 
                  final, Gran.

  As Michael hunts without success for the bottle opener.

                                MICHAEL
                  The point is, what happens if 
                  someone sees, Tom? If they find out  
                  what you are?

                                TOM
                So what s the point of magic if you 
                  can t have a laugh with it?

                                URSULA
                  That s a very good question. The 
                  trick is to be careful where you 
                  have the fun.

    Michael is still hunting for the bottle opener.

                                MICHAEL
                  ...And what s happened to the 
                  bottle opener?

                                URSULA
                  Unenchanteds, you re so helpless!

  She raps her cane -

                                URSULA (CONT D)
                  Mass-fan-wann dah!

    PRAC EFFECT: The bottle top pops off the cola.

    PRAC EFFECT: More bottle tops around the kitchen pop off,  
    spraying contents everywhere. 

    Ursula, Michael and Tom take in the devastation.

    PRAC EFFECT: One more bottle top pops off. 

                                URSULA (CONT D)
                  Oops. I think I have things I 
                  should be doing in the Chamber.

  She heads for the lobby, smiling Tom follows as she opens the 
    downstairs toilet door - just checking.

                                URSULA (CONT D)
                  Nobody in there?

                                TOM
                  No. We re all here, Gran.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)

                  It s only polite to check, Thomas. 

  And she closes the door and raps on it twice with the cane. 

                                URSULA (CONT D)
                  Chamber of Crowe open to me, reveal 
                  yourself on the knock of three.

  She raps on the door once more. And it opens by itself - on 
  to a dark, stone passageway lit by lanterns. There s a 
    distant cry from along the passageway - a bird crossed with a 
    lizard.

  Tom gazes, fascinated, though he s seen this so often before -

                                TOM
                  Maybe I could come and help... with 
                  whatever you ve got to do down 
                  there.

  But Michael is in the kitchen doorway now.

                                MICHAEL
                  You re a long way off ready for the 
                  Chamber of Mysteries, Tom.

                                TOM
                  But that s where the big magic is.

                                MICHAEL
                  Maybe when you stop using magic to 
                  score goals you ll be responsible 
                  enough for what s in there.

    Michael holds Tom s stare. Part of Tom knows he is right.

                                URSULA
                  One day, Tom. Besides, it s your 
                  mum s birthday, and I think there s 
                  something important you have to do.

    Ursula gives him a sad smile- 

                                URSULA (CONT D)
                  Give her my love.

  She enters the passageway and closes the door after her.

                                                                          CUT TO:

                  presence from the humans. 

  As a female Nekross, LEXI watches a video screen - on it 
    ROBERT, alone in a wire cell, scared and angry.

                                ROBERT
                  What have you done with my son?!

  VARG joins his sister LEXI.

                  Wizards are seldom physically 
                  impressive. But they have Magic.

                                LEXI
                  Put the wizard into the Extractor.

  Mark is dragged towards a capsule connected to a network of 
    transparent piping, the EXTRACTOR.

    Mark is immobilized as a light shines on him.  Lexi pulls on 
  a lever. The Extractor comes to life. The machine HUMS.

  FX SHOT: The pipes fill with swirling MAGICAL ESSENCE.

  And from behind large closed doors, the NEKROSS KING -

                                NEKROSS KING (O.S.)
                  Feed me the Magic.

    Varg and Lexi bow towards the closed doors.

                As the King commands, so it is 
                  done.

    Varg turns a handle -

  FX SHOT: The MAGIC is piped behind the closed doors.

  The Extractor shuts down. Mark, aged into OLD MARK, exhausted

  He catches sight of his reflection in a monitor screen.

                  What have you monsters done to me?

  And from behind the closed doors - GLUG! GLUG! GLUG! - The  
    horrible sound of the unseen King feeding.

                                VARG

  FX SHOT: Tom s fingers click - MAGICAL ENERGY.

  PRAC EFFECT: The clock flies at the wall. 

  Tom shrugs off his sheets - sees unfinished homework on his 
  desk. Winces. Then grins. 

  CLOSE ON: Tom clicks his fingers.

  TOM heads to the bathroom - the history books are open, the 
  pages turning by themselves.

  FX SHOT: His exercise book is magically filling with writing.

    CHANGING ROOMS - DAY 2

    URSULA emerges from the toilet as the bird-lizard cries from 
  the dark passageway. She has a feather duster and dusts 
    cobwebs off herself as the kitchen phone goes. She gets it. 

                                URSULA
                  Hello?

  After school. BENNY slips into one of the science labs.

    KITCHEN - DAY 2

  TOM is still on the phone to worried URSULA.

                                URSULA
                  Oh, this isn t good. A wizard 
                  losing a magic ring. Then another 
                  one giving it to an Unenchanted. 

                                TOM
                I didn t give it to him -

                                URSULA
                  I ll be there in a jiffy!

                                TOM
                  What? No! I didn t mean-

  But she s hung up. Tom rolls his eyes - now he s in trouble!

                                                                          CUT TO:



  BENNY has attached electrodes to the ring. Is watching a read-
  out on a screen, taking notes.

  As MISS WEBSTER walks in. Benny feels caught red-handed.

                                BENNY
                  Miss. I - I wasn t going to blow 
                  anything up. This time. Honest.

    Benny s getting a little nervous.

                                BENNY
                  What? You mean this?

  As her eyes fall on the ring the read-out goes mad.

                                BENNY (CONT D)
                  How is that happening?

  Benny grabs the ring. Backs off. MISS WEBSTER stiffens. Tries 
  to play the role.

                                MISS WEBSTER
                I am your superior. You will do as 
                I say. Hand it to me, halfling.

                  Halfling?

                  Well, have this on me! Ava-shen 
                  dah!

  He clicks his fingers - and nothing happens.

    Clicks again.

                                BENNY
                  ... And?

                                TOM
                  No! No way! I ve used up my spells.

  On Tom.

    FLASHBACK MONTAGE: Rapid-fire - Tom clicks to stop the alarm; 
    clicks to finish his homework; clicks to save Benny.

                                TOM (CONT D)
                We only get three spells, sunrise 
                to sunrise. I ve used them. Wasted 
                  them.

                                BENNY
                  What kind of cut-price wizard are 
                  you?

  Lexi leers.

                                LEXI
                A tasty one - and quite 
                  defenceless.

  Tom grabs one of a bunch of footballs on the floor - ready to 
  throw it at Lexi, as -

  The doors behind Tom burst open - URSULA! Pulling herself up 
  to her full height. Doing her best to look threatening. 
    Dramatic.

                                URSULA
                  No-one threatens my grandson!

                                TOM
                  Gran! No! It s an alien! 

                                URSULA
                  Don t be ridiculous. There are no 
                  such things as aliens.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)

                                BENNY
                  Errr - maybe you should take a 
                  closer look.

  Lexi takes Ursula in and grins.

                                LEXI
                  You are the aliens to us, and you 
                  disgust me.

  But Ursula, determined to protect Tom, steps between him and 
  Lexi.  Summoning all her courage, all her steel.

                                URSULA
                  Whatever you are, I may look like a 
                  foolish old crone, but I have the 
                  blood of warrior wizards in my 
                  veins.

                                BENNY
                      (to Tom)
                So she s like Gandalfina, or 
                  someone?

                                TOM
                  ... Not exactly.

    Ursula strikes the floor with her cane - 

                                URSULA
                I am Ursula...

  The amber stone on the head of the cane glows -

                                URSULA (CONT D)
                  ... seventh daughter of a seventh 
                  daughter of the Magical Line of 
                  Crowe. My family have slain demons 
                  and destroyed armies of the 
                  Neverside. Whatever world you come 
                  from, beware.

  But Lexi just smiles.

                                LEXI
                  More Magic. I shall take you both! 

                                TOM
                  What?!

  Lexi presses a button on her wrist device -

  FX SHOT: Ursula, Tom and Lexi glow - and are gone!

    Benny s eyes bulge with shock -



                                                                          (CONTINUED)

                  She beamed them up!

                                                                          CUT TO:



  FX SHOT: TOM and URSULA burst out of a PRAC column of light. 
    (NOTE: Tom still has the football.)

                                URSULA
                  What - what happened? Where are we?

  FX SHOT: At the window - the MOON, and beyond it - not quite 
  fully in view - the distant EARTH.

                                TOM
                  ... I think we re in space. 

    Despite everything - a moment of wonder for both of them.

                                URSULA
                  It s so beautiful.

  LEXI interrupts their wonder. Covering them with her blaster. 
    Behind her - NEKROSS GUARDS.

                                LEXI
                  Earth looks so small. So far away. 
                  Say goodbye to it, wizards. 

  And Lexi throws a lever on a control panel - 

  The transporter PRAC light beam goes off.

                                LEXI (CONT D)
                  Welcome to the Zarantulus. It s 
                  time to meet my father.

                                                                          CUT TO:



  Led by NEKROSS GUARDS and LEXI, TOM and URSULA enter. VARG is 
    waiting. The King s Chamber is flanked by TWO NEKROSS GUARDS.

                                VARG
                  Bow wizards, before the Nekross 
                  King!

                                TOM
                  I m not bowing! Let us go!

  From behind the closed King s Chamber doors -


                                                                          (CONTINUED)

                                NEKROSS KING (O.S.)
                  You defy me, wizard? I who have 
                  bestrode the stars?

                                URSULA
                  Maybe you shouldn t upset him, Tom.

                                TOM
                If you re such a big deal, how come 
                  you don t show your face?

                                NEKROSS KING
                  You would look on the face of the 
                  King?

                                LEXI
                  Behold the King!

  And with a strange fanfare and a huge burst of gas the doors 
  of the King s Chamber part.

                                VARG/ LEXI
                  Hail the might of Nekron!

  Big Reveal! The KING for the first time, as TOM and URSULA 
  lay astonished eyes on him - gigantic, bloated, slimy mass of 
  alien blubber. He is the size of a wall. There s bubbling 
    liquid and belching gas. Pipes and tubes run into him, it s 
  like he s plumbed into the ship. It s gross. 

  The King looks at them -

                                NEKROSS KING
                I shall devour you and all your 
                  kind, wizardblood. The Nekross 
                  shall feast!

                                                                          CUT TO:
