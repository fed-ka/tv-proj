                                          ACT ONE

      FADE IN:


      INT. JUVIE - CAFETERIA - DAY

      CALLIE JACOB (16, offbeat, beautiful, hard behind the eyes) 
      navigates the maze of cement tables, chin up but eyes down, 
      trying to find a place to eat in the buzzing, grey-green 
      cafeteria.  When she spots a COUPLE GIRLS in a shouting match, 
      she reconnoiters to avoid the conflict.

      She spies an empty table on the periphery and sits down 
      quietly.  Before she can finish even a bite of the slop they 
      call a meal in this place, TWO TOUGH GIRLS descend, plopping 
      down on either side of her.

                                    GIRL #1
                  You getting out today?  Huh?  That s 
                  what we heard.

      Callie grips her fork, lets out a deep sigh, and looks down.

                                    GIRL #2
                  Aw, she don t want no trouble.  That 
                  it?

                                    GIRL #1
                  Why you so quiet, bitch?  You was all 
                  mouthy the other day when I cut in 
                  front of you in the showers.  I lost 
                  my yard privileges  cause of you...

      Callie bites her tongue so hard it almost bleeds, then nods 
      her head and grabs her tray.  She stands up slowly, carefully.

      Girl #2 gets in her face.  Callie tries to turn around, but 
      Girl #1 is already there.  She is trapped.

                                    GIRL #2
                  She asked you a question - you 
                    gettin  out today?

      She shoves Callie, who rocks back but does not fall.  The rage 
      and fury behind Callie s eyes is terrifying.  But she still 
      says nothing.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"2.


                                    GIRL #1
                  Huh?  You too good to talk to me, 
                  pretty girl?

      She shoves her again.  Callie s tray falls to the floor with a 
      clatter.

                                    GIRL #1 (CONT D)
                  We oughtta beat the crap outta you.

      Tough Girl #1 shoots a look at one of the GUARDS standing in 
      the corner.

                                    GIRL #1 (CONT D)
                  Nah, you ain t worth it.  You ain t 
                  worth anything.

      But she stays in Callie s face.  These words set off something 
      in Callie, who can t hold her tongue anymore.

                                    CALLIE
                          (with venom)
                  You really need a dog treat for that 
                    breath, bitch...

      And with that, Girl #1 hauls off and CLOCKS Callie, right in 
      the jaw, hard.  Callie staggers to the left, absorbing the 
      blow.  But she does not retaliate.

      This enrages the girls, who both unleash on Callie, pounding 
      her from all sides.  It s almost hypnotic, watching Callie 
      receive punch after punch, never responding.

      IN SLO-MOTION: Callie gets knocked side to side, her eyes full 
      of rage and pain, but even more than that, full of purpose.  A 
      soft, elegiac piece of CLASSICAL MUSIC begins to play on a 
      piano.

      The brutality of Callie s beatdown is highlighted against this 
      soothing, perfect composition.


      INT. HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - DAY

      A dark high school auditorium.  Onstage, BRANDON FOSTER (16, 
      intense, sexy, different, think young Andrew Garfield) plays a 
      baby grand piano and finishes his song.  Behind him, a banner 
      proclaims SAN DIEGO MUSIC SOCIETY ANNUAL COMPETITION.

      Throughout the audience, a smattering of STUDENTS and 
      CHAPERONES wait their turns.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"3.


      Toward the back of the house, STEF FOSTER (about 40, strong 
      but full of heart), still wearing her Police Officer s 
      uniform, proudly bobs her head in time with her son. 

      On the seat beside her, her iPhone lights up   LENA CALLING   
      but she doesn t notice.  It finally stops its silent ring and 
      the screen changes to read SIX MISSED CALLS.


      INT./EXT. VOVLO STATION WAGON - NIGHT/CONTINUOUS

      Inside, LENA FOSTER (35, warm, striking, African-American) 
      sits in her car with her cell phone pressed to her ear. 

                                    STEF (V.O.)
                  Hey, it s Stef.  I m either working 
                  or avoiding your call, so leave a -

      Lena hangs up, takes a breath, then climbs out of the car.


      EXT. JUVIE - PARKING LOT - NIGHT/CONTINUOUS

      Lena approaches DAVID FRESSOLA (32, overwhelmed, harried), who 
      extends his hand.

                                    DAVID
                  Hi, Lena?  I m David.  Nice to meet 
                  you. 

                                    LENA
                    Where s Bill?  I just spoke with him.

                                    DAVID
                  Um, yeah.  One of his cases - well, a 
                  kid in one of his foster homes OD d, 
                  so he had to rush to the hospital.

                                    LENA
                  Oh my God.

                                    DAVID
                  Yeah, it s terrible.  Anyway, I take 
                  it he told you about Callie...

      He consults a file in his hands.

                                    DAVID (CONT D)
                  It seems she s been having a little 
                    trouble with male authority figures 
                  of late, which is why he thought of 
                  you, I guess...

      Lena nods.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"4.


                                    LENA
                    I guess so.  She got into a fight 
                  with her foster father?

      He checks the file again.

                                    DAVID
                  Um, yes.  And she, um, damaged some 
                  of his property.  Which is how she 
                  landed here in juvie.

      This is news to Lena.  She is taken aback.

                                    LENA
                    Damaged his property?  What does that 
                  mean?

      David doesn t know.

                                    LENA (CONT D)
                  Oh, wow.  Um, look, David.  Bill and 
                  I have known each other a long time.  
                  He s been a friend of the family ever 
                  since he placed the twins with us.  
                  And I know he wouldn t have asked me 
                  to do this if he weren t in a jam -

                                    DAVID
                    - yeah, he had someone lined up but 
                  they fell through this afternoon -

                                    LENA
                  - but I can t be bringing someone 
                    violent into my house.  I ve got my 
                  own kids to think about.

                                    DAVID
                          (checking the file)
                  This is the first time anything like 
                  this has ever happened with her.

                                    LENA
                    Still...

                                    DAVID
                  Bill would never have put you in this 
                    position if he thought she was 
                    actually dangerous.

      This is true.

                                    DAVID (CONT D)
                  And if there were any other options.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"5.


      This was a smart move on David s part.  Lena s a soft touch.

                                    LENA
                    I don t know.  I m just not sure this 
                  is the right time for us.

                                    DAVID
                    Please.  We just need a few weeks to 
                  find a more permanent solution.

      A beat.  Lena s wheels are turning.  She wants to help; she s 
      a caretaker by nature.  

      Just then, a LOUD BUZZ and the doors open to reveal Callie, 
      dressed in tight jeans and a ragged T-shirt, her face bruised 
      and bloodied.  Her right eye is swollen almost shut, and her 
      lower lip is cut.  Lena gasps.  Her instinct is to get in her 
      car and leave.  But she doesn t - she looks at David instead.

                                    DAVID (CONT D)
                            (explaining)
                    Sometimes - when kids are getting 
                  out, the other inmates get jealous 
                  and pick fights. 

      He smiles at Lena, then trots over to meet Callie.  As soon as 
      he approaches her -

                                    DAVID (CONT D)
                  Hi, Callie.  I m David.  I work with 
                  Bill at Child Protective Services...

                                    CALLIE
                    Where s Jude?

                                    DAVID
                  Um, I m - I don t know.  

                                    CALLIE
                    I wanna talk to Jude.

                                    DAVID
                    Callie, this is not the time.

      Callie starts to get upset.

                                    CALLIE
                  What the hell?  I wanna talk to Jude!  
                    Where s Bill?  Why isn t Bill here?

      David looks over at Lena, who is watching Callie like a hawk.        "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"6.


                                    CALLIE (CONT D)
                          (then, re: Jude)
                  Why can t I just call him?  I just 
                  got out of juvie!  Jesus!  What the 
                  hell is wrong with you people!

      David shoots one more look to Lena, sure that he s going to 
      lose her.  Then he shuts Callie down.

                                    DAVID
                          (sotto, but intense)
                    Callie!  Enough!  Unless you want me 
                  to turn you around and march you 
                  right back in to Juvenile Hall, you 
                  need to calm down and be quiet! 

      Callie shuts up, but she s not happy about it.  A pause, 
      before David leads her over to Lena.

                                    LENA
                  Hi, Callie, I m Lena.  Nice to meet 
                  you.

      Lena holds out her hand.  Callie does not take it.  A long 
      beat.  David turns to Lena, moves in for the kill.

                                    DAVID
                    I mean, I guess I could take her to 
                  one of the group homes...

      Lena sighs - she knows how awful those homes are.  Callie 
      looks to Lena.  She would never beg, but her bruised eyes say 
      everything.  Please.  Please don t send me away.

                                    LENA
                  It s just for a few weeks, right?

                                    DAVID
                    Absolutely.

      A beat.  A breath.

                                    LENA
                  Okay.

                                    DAVID
                          (a smile over his threat)
                  All right, Callie.  I need you to 
                    behave, okay?  No acting out, no 
                    mouthing off, no running away or 
                  you ll be back in juvie before your 
                  head hits the pillow - got it?      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"7.


                                    LENA
                          (re: David s threat)
                    David...

      But David stands his ground with Callie.

                                    DAVID
                  Got it?

      Callie finally nods.  

                                    DAVID (CONT D)
                  Okay, I ll let you guys head on home.  
                  Thank you, Lena. 

      Lena nods.  David hands Lena Callie s overstuffed, dirty 
      backpack.

                                    LENA
                  You ready, Callie?

      Callie nods again.  She still hasn t said a word to Lena.  
      Lena lets out a tense breath, then leads Callie wordlessly to 
      the car.


      INT. FOSTER HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

      Callie sits in one corner of the kitchen, diametrically across 
      from MARIANA (15, Latina, smart as a whip) and JESUS (15, 
      Mariana s fraternal twin, surfer dude swagger) - who are 
      carefully eyeing this new girl.  They exchange a look of WHO-
            IS-THIS-GIRL-AND-WHAT-IS-SHE-DOING-IN-OUR-HOUSE?

      Lena pulls a bag of frozen peas out of the freezer and hands 
      it to Callie, who puts it on her swollen eye without saying 
      anything. 

                                    LENA
                    Mariana and Jesus were in the foster 
                    program, too.  They came to us about 
                  eight years ago, and we formally 
                    adopted them, what -

                                    JESUS
                  - five years ago.

                                    MARIANA
                          (making an effort)
                  The foster system sucks -

                                    LENA
                    Mariana...      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"8.


                                    MARIANA
                  What?  It does.  

                                    JESUS
                  What happened to your face?  You get 
                  in a fight?

      Callie looks at her for a moment, then shrugs.  She is not 
      ready to open up to these people.  Lena jumps in.

                                    LENA
                    Callie s had quite a day, so why 
                  don t we cool it with the third 
                    degree.  

      An awkward moment.  Callie finally speaks.

                                    CALLIE
                  Is there a - where s the bathroom?

      Lena points down the hall.

                                    LENA
                  Second door on the right.

      Callie nods, disappears down the hall.  Mariana turns to Lena.

                                    MARIANA
                  So... where d she come from?

                                    LENA
                  Um, well - I, um, called Bill - from 
                  Child Protective Services, remember 
                  him? - to talk to him about 
                    something, and he was in a jam and 
                  needed a place for Callie to stay.  
                  She s had a - rough time lately, so I 
                  want you guys to be extra nice to 
                  her... 

                                    JESUS
                    Whaddaya mean, a rough time?

      Lena conspicuously doesn t mention juvie.

                                    LENA
                  She got herself in some - trouble, 
                  that s all.  Don t worry about it.

                                    MARIANA
                          (antenna up)
                  Talk to Bill about what?      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"9.


                                    JESUS
                          (to his sister)
                    Guess...

      Lena considers whether to tell them or not.

                                    LENA
                  I was gonna wait until everyone was 
                  home to tell you guys, but...  I was 
                    calling to see if we could arrange a 
                  visit with your birth mom.

      A beat.  Silence.  Lena looks at them both.

                                    LENA (CONT D)
                          (mostly to Mariana, 
                            confused)
                    I thought you d be more excited.  
                  It s kinda all you ve been talking 
                  about for the last six months.

      Mariana shakes her head, gets a little quiet.

                                    MARIANA
                  Yeah, I know.  I just - I don t think 
                  so.

      Lena is completely shocked by Mariana s response.  Frankly, so 
      is Jesus.

                                    LENA
                    Really?  
                          (then)
                  Did Jesus talk you out of it?  Just 
                    because he doesn t want to -

      Jesus throws his hands up.

                                    JESUS
                  Don t look at me.

                                    MARIANA
                  No.  I just changed my mind, is all.

                                    LENA
                  Are you nervous?  Is that it?  You 
                  know I d be there with you, right?

      Mariana shakes her head again.

                                    LENA (CONT D)
                  Did something change?  I m just not 
                    understanding, Mariana...      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"10.


      Mariana gets up to get herself a cookie.

                                    MARIANA
                          (not unkindly)
                  Look, I just - I decided I m not 
                  ready, okay.  Can we please talk 
                  about something else?

      This doesn t ring entirely true to Lena, but she decides not 
      to push it for the moment.  

                                    LENA
                  Okay.  Well, let me know if you 
                  change your mind.


      INT. FOSTER HOUSE - POWDER ROOM - NIGHT

      Callie sits on the closed toilet with her knees pulled up 
      under her chin.  She stares into space, the first quiet moment 
      she s had in ages.

      There is a soft knock on the door.

                                    LENA (O.S.)
                    Callie?  You okay in there?

      Callie takes a deep breath and opens the door.


      INT. FOSTER HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

      Lena leads Callie back into the kitchen.

                                    LENA
                  Okay, guys, did everybody do their 
                    homework?

      Mariana nods.

                                    JESUS
                  Yeah.

      Lena doesn t quite believe him, shoots a look to Mariana.  
      Mariana shakes her head.

                                    JESUS (CONT D)
                  Man, why you gotta be like that?  
                  Just because you don t ever gotta 
                  study and you get all A s...

                                    LENA
                  We all have our strengths, Jesus.  
                  You heard your sister, get to it.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"11.


      Jesus makes a big show of being annoyed, gets up to head 
      upstairs, when Brandon wanders in, carrying his guitar.  He 
      slaps hands with Jesus, who uses the interruption to avoid 
      going to do his homework.

                                    BRANDON
                  Hey.

                                    LENA
                  How d it go?

                                    BRANDON
                  What?

                                    LENA
                  The music thing.

      Brandon locks eyes with Callie.  He s never seen anyone quite 
      like her - beautiful, but broken.

                                    LENA (CONT D)
                  How d it go?
                          (no answer)
                    Brandon. 

      Callie looks away, snapping Brandon back to reality.

                                    BRANDON
                  Oh - good, good.  I made the finals.

                                    LENA
                  What?  You did?  That s great!


                                      MARIANA/JESUS
                  Oh my God./Nice.

                                    BRANDON
                          (a little sheepish)
                  It s no big deal.

                                    LENA
                  It s a very big deal!  When are they?

                                    BRANDON
                    Tomorrow night.

                                    LENA
                  Oh, I can t wait.

      Brandon tries to deflect the attention, turns to Callie.

                                    BRANDON
                  So...  who s this?      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"12.


                                    LENA
                  Oh!  This is Callie.  She ll be 
                    staying with us for a while.

      Brandon looks to Lena.  This is surprising - and weird - news.  

                                    BRANDON
                  Like staying with us?  Really?  Wow.  
                  Okay.  Nice to meet you.

      Callie nods at him.  A beat.

                                    CALLIE
                  What about him?

      Lena is surprised that Callie is starting to open up a bit.

                                    LENA
                  What?

                                    CALLIE
                  What about him?  How d you get him?  
                          (then, a joke)
                    Amazon?

      Lena laughs, pleased.  This is going better than expected.

                                    LENA
                  Oh, Brandon is my -

      Just then, Stef strides in to the kitchen, STILL IN HER 
      UNIFORM, carrying her bag.

                                    LENA (CONT D)
                    - partner Stefanie s biological son.  
                  Hi, honey.

      Seeing Stef s uniform, Callie s blood goes cold.  She visibly 
      stiffens.  The twins both notice. 

                                    JESUS
                  You okay?
                          (then)
                  What?  Nobody told you our mom s a 
                  cop?

                                    MARIANA
                  See?  This is why no boys ever wanna 
                  come over.

                                    STEF
                  As it should be.
                          (then, to Lena)
                  Hey, babe.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"13.


      Stef kisses Lena.  Callie takes this in.  Her tone becomes 
      less jovial, more defensive.

                                    CALLIE
                  So you re dykes?

                                    JESUS
                  Um, they prefer the term  people,  
                  but yeah, they re gay.

      Stef clocks Callie, and looks around, perplexed.

                                    CALLIE
                  And he s the real son?

      This brings the conversation to a halt.  All the air gets 
      sucked out of the room.  Jesus lets the comment roll of his 
      back, but something in Callie s words hit Mariana where it 
      counts; she ices over instantly.  This pushes even friendly 
      Brandon back on his heels.  After an unbearable pause - 

                                    BRANDON
                            (territorially)
                  We re all their real children.

      Callie just nods - sure. 

                                    STEF
                  And who s this?

      Off Stef s tight smile...

      EXT. FOSTER HOUSE - BACK PORCH - NIGHT

      Lena and Stef step outside.  Stef is a little hot; Lena was 
      prepared for this, and is assuaging her as fast as she can.

                                    LENA
                    I tried to call you.  Several times.

                                    STEF
                  I was with Brandon at his audition.  
                  You knew that.

                                    LENA
                  Look, I m sorry - but it was time 
                    sensitive.  And I knew you wouldn t 
                  want to leave the poor girl -

                                    STEF
                  Oh, no.  No, no.  Don t make this 
                  about me.  We made a deal, a long 
                  time ago -

      Lena tries a new tack.

                                    LENA
                  It s just for a few weeks.

                                    STEF
                  What happened to her face?

                                    LENA
                  She got beat up in juvie.

      Stef grumbles - juvie?

                                    LENA (CONT D)
                      I double-checked with Bill - she s 
                  not violent, she s not dangerous in 
                  any way.  It was a one time thing.

                                    STEF
                  You can t save them all, Lena.

                                    LENA
                  Don t patronize me, please.

                                    STEF
                  Who s patronizing you?  How about you 
                  don t get all uppity with your fancy 
                  words.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"15.


                                    LENA
                    Patronize is hardly a fancy word.  
                  And don t call a person of color 
                     uppity.   It s tawdry.

                                    STEF
                          (mocking her)
                     Person of color? 

                                    LENA
                          (pointing to her skin)
                  Brown.

                                    STEF
                          (pointing at her skin)
                  White.

                                    LENA
                    White s not a color.

                                    STEF
                  Okay, fine.  Sorry, Person of Color.  
                  I d hate to be  tawdry  in my own 
                  home.

      Lena laughs.

                                    STEF (CONT D)
                  It s just a few weeks, right?

      Lena nods.  A moment.  Stef heaves a big sigh - she s knows 
      she doesn t really have a choice.  With a shake of her head, 
      she gestures for Lena to head back inside.

                                    STEF (CONT D)
                          (to herself)
                    Tawdry... don t be tawdry...  stupid.


      INT. FOSTER HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT/LATER

      The other kids have gone to their rooms, leaving Callie alone 
      with Lena and Stef.  Stef explains the house rules.

                                    STEF
                  - and you don t leave the house 
                    without asking permission.  Also, 
                  you ll be going to school while 
                  you re staying here - 

      Callie is surprised to hear this, and is visibly more hostile 
      to Stef than to Lena.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"16.


                                    CALLIE
                  Why do I have to go to school?  It s 
                  not like I live here...

                                    STEF
                    Because you re not staying around the 
                  house all day.  Lena is the Vice-
                    Principal, and all the kids go to 
                  Riley, so you ll be fine.  Everybody 
                  leaves at 7:15, so lights out by -

                                    CALLIE
                          (cutting her off)
                  Where do I sleep?

                                    STEF
                  Excuse me?

                                    CALLIE
                  It s not my first time in a foster 
                  home.  Where do I sleep?

      Callie s attitude rubs Stef the wrong way.  She shoots a look 
      to Lena, who silently gestures for Stef to  breathe.   Stef 
      lets out a long sigh.  Lena whisks Callie away.

                                    LENA
                  Let me show you...


      INT. FOSTER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT/LATER

      Lena finishes making up the couch for Callie to sleep on.

                                    LENA
                  One pillow - or two?
                          (off Callie s shrug)
                  Okay, I ll leave them both.  It s 
                  just for tonight.  Tomorrow I ll move 
                  Jesus in with Brandon so you can have 
                  his room.  There s a bathroom just 
                  down the hall.  You have a 
                    toothbrush?

                                    CALLIE
                  I m not disgusting.  I have a 
                    toothbrush.

                                    LENA
                          (done with the attitude)
                  Okay, Callie?  We re on your side.  I 
                  know you ve had a rough time lately -  
                  but we re the good guys.  So you can 
                  take it down a notch.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"17.


      Callie looks down, then starts digging around in her backpack, 
      then realizes something.  She considers what to do.  Finally -

                                    CALLIE
                          (softer)
                  I need toothpaste.

      Lena smiles a little, to herself.  This is a breakthrough.

                                    LENA
                  Let me get you some.  And I ll grab 
                  you a towel, so you can take a 
                    shower, if you want.

      And Lena makes her way down the hall, then looks back to see  
      Callie standing there, clutching her canary yellow toothbrush 
      like a shiv.  Lena stops.

                                    LENA (CONT D)
                  You okay?

      Callie nods.

                                    LENA (CONT D)
                  You seemed pretty upset when you were 
                    talking to David earlier...

      Callie takes a breath, resolves to take Lena into her 
      confidence.  After a moment -

                                    CALLIE
                  Um, it s just - when they sent me to 
                  juvie -

      Just then Stef comes in from the kitchen.  Callie clams up.

                                    STEF
                  Got enough blankets?  Need anything?

      Callie doesn t say anything.  Lena shakes her head.  

                                    STEF (CONT D)
                  Okay.  Good night.

      Stef continues on upstairs.  Once she s gone - 

                                    LENA
                  You were saying?

      But Callie s moment of openness has passed.  

                                    CALLIE
                  You got that toothpaste?      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"18.


      Lena decides not to press her.  She smiles at her and 
      disappears down the hall.


      INT. FOSTER HOUSE - MARIANA S ROOM - NIGHT

      Mariana and Jesus lounge on the bed, talking in Spanish - 
      never a good sign.  Stef appears at the door.

                                    MARIANA
                          (in Spanish)
                  - I don t trust her, she s weird.

                                    STEF
                  Hey.  You know the rules - no using 
                    Spanish to talk behind people s 
                  backs.

      Mariana doesn t respond.

                                    STEF (CONT D)
                  You guys know it s not true, right?  
                  What Callie said.  You two are every 
                  bit as much our kids as Brandon.  

                                    JESUS
                  We know.

                                    LENA
                    Mariana?

      They look at Mariana, who puts on a smile and nods.  But Jesus 
      notices something in her expression - something unsettling.

                                    STEF
                  Okay.  Love you guys.  Lights out in 
                    fifteen.  Goodnight.


      INT. FOSTER HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

      Callie lets the steaming hot water of the shower run over her 
      bruised body.  She winces with the pain.


      INT. FOSTER HOUSE - BRANDON S ROOM - NIGHT

      Stef looks over Brandon s shoulder as he does his trigonometry 
      homework on his computer.

                                    STEF
                  You need to step up while Callie s in 
                  the house, okay?  I m counting on 
                  you.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"19.


      Brandon rolls his eyes, unsure what that means exactly.

                                    STEF (CONT D)
                  I m serious, Brandon.  Callie s a lot 
                  older than the twins were when they 
                  got here.  

                                    BRANDON
                  So?

                                    STEF
                          (thoughtfully)
                  So... just between us, Callie was in 
                  juvie for a little bit.  Okay?  

                                    BRANDON
                            (protective)
                  She was in - what the hell is she 
                  doing in our house, then?

                                    STEF
                  She s fine, just - keep your eyes 
                  open.  I m counting on you to... I 
                    dunno...

                                    BRANDON
                  Okay, I ll be sure to  I dunno  as 
                  much as I can.

                                    STEF
                  Are you sure you re not Lena s 
                    biological son?

                                    BRANDON
                  Mom.  I ve got homework to do.  MOBY 
                  DICK waits for no man.

      Stef shudders.  Brandon looks at her.

                                    STEF
                          (going for the dirty joke)
                  You said MOBY DICK.  Gave me 
                    flashbacks of your father.

                                    BRANDON
                  Uch, Mom!

                                    STEF
                    Speaking of MOBY DICK, do you need 
                    condoms?  You and Talya are using 
                  them, right?  

                                    BRANDON
                  Oh my God.  I m gonna kill you.  Go!      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"20.


      INT. FOSTER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

      The house is dark and quiet.  Callie, her T-shirt and boxer 
      shorts clinging to her damp body, towel dries her hair.  After 
      a moment, she tosses the towel on the floor starts padding 
      around the room, looking at things, inspecting things - almost 
      like she s casing the place.

      She wanders over to the desk, looking for something specific.  
      She spots the base for the cordless telephone, but the 
      receiver s not there.  Damn.


      INT. FOSTER HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

      The phone receiver lays on the nightstand beside Stef, who is 
      already in bed, watching a rerun of FRIENDS.  Lena comes out 
      of the bathroom, rubbing lotion into her hands.

                                    LENA
                    Haven t you seen that one about a 
                    hundred times?

      Stef gets the message - Lena wants to talk.  She turns off the 
      TV, as Lena sits on the edge of the bed beside her.

                                    LENA (CONT D)
                  I m sorry.  I know we agreed once we 
                    adopted the twins that we weren t 
                  gonna foster again until Brandon was 
                  out of the house, but I just... 
                    Anyway, I get it.  I won t do it 
                  again.

                                    STEF
                  Thank you.  Please don t.  You keep  
                    bringing kids home and it s gonna be 
                  like the Brady Bunch in here.  
                          (then, after a laugh)
                  I know you only did it  cause you 
                    wouldn t have been able to sleep 
                    knowing there was some poor girl out 
                  there with no place to stay...

                                    LENA
                  There are lots of kids out there 
                    tonight, without a place to stay.

                                    STEF
                  Wait!  Come back from the dark place!  
                    Because of you and that big stupid 
                  heart of yours at least one of them 
                  is safe tonight.  It s fine.  
                    Everything is gonna be fine...      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"21.


      She pulls Lena down onto her chest, and the two women lie 
      there, still and quiet for the first time all day.  Then -

                                    LENA
                  Wanna hear something strange?  I told 
                  the twins that we would arrange a 
                    meeting with their birth mom like we 
                  talked about - and now neither one 
                  wants to do it.

                                    STEF
                    Really?  Not even Mariana?

                                    LENA
                  Nope.  She said she wasn t ready.

      A beat.  Stef lets out a long, slow breath.

                                    STEF
                  Good.

      Lena closes her eyes, and drifts off to sleep.  Stef goes back 
      to watching FRIENDS.


      INT. FOSTER HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

      Mariana is in the kitchen, looking for something in a cabinet 
      near the sink.  She grabs a PRESCRIPTION BOTTLE and empties 
      about half a dozen blue and red pills into her hand.  She puts 
      the bottle back, closes the cabinet and turns to see -

      - CALLIE STANDING THERE.  Mariana covertly slips the pills 
      into the pocket of her sweatshirt.  How long has Callie been 
      watching?

                                    MARIANA
                    I needed some water.

      Mariana brushes past Callie and heads upstairs - without a 
      glass of water.


      INT. FOSTER HOUSE - NIGHT/LATER

      Callie tiptoes through the house in the dark, peering in 
      closets and lifting up everything that isn t nailed down - 
      touching it, to see what it is.  This place is foreign to her.

      She wanders down the hall and spies in to Jesus  room, where 
      he sleeps splayed across the bed, almost impossible to see 
      under the clothes and surf magazines.  Mariana s door is shut 
      tight.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"22.


      Then Callie comes to Brandon s room.  The lights are still on 
      and Callie watches through the crack in the door as the golden 
      boy, shirtless in his pajama bottoms, sits at his keyboard, 
      practicing intently, headphones on.  He keeps messing up a 
      chord progression, and is getting frustrated with himself - 
      but he doesn t stop.  He plays it again and again until he 
      finally gets it right.

      There s something almost erotic about the way Callie s looking 
      at him   like she s seeing some exotic animal in its natural 
      habitat.  Then she spots his CELLPHONE, charging on top of the 
      dresser beside the door.

      She holds her breath and reaches inside ever so carefully, 
      keeping her eyes locked on Brandon.  She tugs it free from the 
      wall and silently pulls it out the door.

      Brandon hears something, and pulls off his headphones.  He 
      turns around - but no one is there.


      EXT. FOSTER HOUSE - NIGHT

      Callie slips around the side of the house and dials a number 
      from memory on Brandon s phone.  

                                    CALLIE
                  Hey, it s me.  I m out.  And I m 
                    coming.  I promise.  I just gotta 
                  figure out how to get there.

      She hangs up, lets out a deep sigh.

      EXT. FOSTER HOUSE - DAY

      Day breaks over the charming craftsman.  It s perfectly still 
      and silent out here.


      INT. FOSTER HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

      But it s chaos inside.  Stef, in her uniform, fills a thermos 
      with coffee while Lena dishes up breakfast.  Brandon is still 
      busily doing homework, Jesus is riding his skateboard on the 
      hardwood floor, and Mariana is talking in Spanish to someone 
      on her cell.  Callie is conspicuously not present.

                                    STEF
                  Did you wake Callie up?

                                    LENA
                  Three times.  I ve been trying for 
                    half-an-hour.

                                    STEF
                    Unacceptable.

      Stef sighs, then gets an idea.  She grabs a glass, fills it 
      with cold water.

                                    LENA
                  What are you doing with that?

                                    STEF
                          (with a smirk)
                  I m thirsty.

                    Stef....

      Jesus runs into one of the cabinets.

                                    LENA (CONT D)
                  Jesus!  Enough!  Have you taken your 
                    Ritalin?

      Lena opens a cabinet, grabs a bottle and pours a blue and red 
      pill into her hand.  She hands it to Jesus who swallows it 
      without water.

                                    LENA (CONT D)
                  Jesus, drink something.

      Jesus makes a big show of getting himself a glass.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"24.


      INT. FOSTER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY/CONTINUOUS

      Stef strides into the living room where she finds Callie, or 
      rather a lump under the covers that she presumes to be Callie.

                                    STEF
                    Callie.

      Callie grumbles, rolls over.

                                    STEF (CONT D)
                    Callie, it s time to get up.

      Nothing.  Stef peels back the blanket over Callie s head - 
      then bit by bit POURS THE GLASS OF WATER ON HER.  Callie jumps 
      up, livid.  Callie s eye is still somewhat bruised but she 
      looks decidedly better.

                                    CALLIE
                  What the -

      Stef stands her ground, smiling.

                                    STEF
                  Next time Lena comes to wake you up - 
                  get up.  Breakfast is ready.  You re 
                    leaving in fifteen.

      And she heads back into the kitchen.  Callie glares at her as 
      she goes.  This place might be worse than juvie.


      INT. FOSTER HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY/CONTINUOUS

      Stef returns to the kitchen where the kids are scarfing down 
      oatmeal or cereal and Lena is eating a yogurt at the counter.  
      Lena notices Stef s empty glass and raises her eyebrows.

                                    STEF
                  She ll be in for breakfast shortly.

                                    LENA
                  What did you do?

                                    STEF
                  I have no idea what you re talking 
                  about.  

      Stef grabs her keys, kisses Lena on the forehead and heads out 
      the back door.

      After a moment, Lena notices that Stef forgot her thermos of 
      coffee.  She runs to the back door.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"25.


                                    LENA
                  Stef!  You forgot your...

      Too late - Stef is already pulling out of the driveway. 


      EXT. RILEY CHARTER SCHOOL - DAY

      Lena s car pulls into the parking lot alongside RILEY CHARTER 
      SCHOOL.  Everyone piles out.

                                    LENA
                  Why don t you guys show Callie 
                    around?  She ll be in Timothy s room 
                  to start the day...

      Brandon and Jesus nod.  Mariana takes off like a bullet.  

                                    MARIANA
                  See ya.

      Jesus watches her go - he is a little concerned about her.

                                    CALLIE
                          (under her breath)
                  Man, that girl is sketchy...

                                    JESUS
                  She s just being all weird right now.  
                  Ignore her.

                                    BRANDON
                          (defending his sister)
                  Didn t you just get out of juvie?

      This is news to Jesus, who looks at Brandon, both surprised 
      and impressed.  Callie s unhappy that word is out, and looks 
      around uncomfortably as the boys lead her across the small, 
      grassy quad at the center of the campus.  

                                    CALLIE
                  Thanks a lot.  Just what I want - 
                    everybody in the school knowing I 
                  just got out of jail.

      Jesus laughs.  Brandon mumbles an apology.  SEVERAL KIDS wave 
      hello to Brandon and Jesus, shooting them funny WHO IS THAT? 
      looks. 

                                    JESUS
                  Are you kidding?  That s the best 
                  thing in the world anybody could say 
                  to these asshats.  They ll be scared 
                  as hell of you...      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"26.


      But Brandon can see that Callie s not buying Jesus  logic.  
      For the first time, he feels some sympathy for her situation.

                                    BRANDON
                  But don t stress - we won t say 
                    anything.

      Callie has little choice but to believe them.

      Jesus sees a FRIEND, stops to talk.  Brandon and Callie wander 
      the campus.  An awkward moment of silence.

                                    BRANDON (CONT D)
                  So, um, Timothy s room is over 
                    there...
                          (he points)
                  You ll find it okay?  We ve got like 
                  twenty minutes before class and I 
                  wanna go practice.

                                    CALLIE
                    Practice for what?

                                    BRANDON
                  I have that music competition 
                    tonight.

                                    CALLIE
                  Oh, right.  Okay.  

      Brandon gives her an awkward wave and starts to cross the 
      quad.  Callie feels the eyes of the arriving students on her 
      and calls out to him.

                                    CALLIE (CONT D)
                  Hey - wait up.

      She trots over to him, grateful to have someplace to go.


      INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY

      Brandon sits at the piano, his brow furrowed as he practices 
      his ORIGINAL COMPOSITION.  Callie meanders around the room, 
      touching things and half-listening.

                                    CALLIE
                  What is that?

      Brandon stops playing, slightly annoyed.

                                    BRANDON
                  What, the song?  I wrote it.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"27.


                                    CALLIE
                  You wrote it?  Really?

      Brandon nods.

                                    BRANDON
                  For the contest.  You have to play 
                  one classical piece and one original 
                    composition. It s about the night Mom 
                  and Mama asked me if it was okay for 
                  the twins to come and live with us. 

      Callie stares at Brandon for a moment.

                                    CALLIE
                  How is it  about  that?  It doesn t 
                  have words...

                                    BRANDON
                  Listen -

      He starts to play the simplest melody line from the piece.

                                    BRANDON (CONT D)
                  This is me.  And here -

      He adds two more chords on top of the phrase.

                                    BRANDON (CONT D)
                    - these are my moms.  And then this -

      And now the piece reaches its full resonance - five different 
      lines all working in unison.

                                    BRANDON (CONT D)
                  - this is all of us - me, mom, Lena, 
                  the twins.  See how it all works 
                  better together.

      Callie nods.  She gets it - sort of, anyway.  

                                    CALLIE
                  Nice.

      Brandon shrugs, a little embarrassed by his own geeky 
      enthusiasm.

                                    BRANDON
                    I dunno.  Now I kinda feel like it s 
                    missing something.

                                    CALLIE
                  I like it.
                          (then)
                                    (MORE)      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"28.

                                    CALLIE (CONT'D)
                  They asked you if the twins could 
                  move in?  What were you gonna say, 
                  No?  I bet you wanted to...

      Brandon smiles a little.

                                    BRANDON
                  Nah, I figured there was enough to go 
                    around. 

                                    CALLIE
                  Enough of what?

                                    BRANDON
                    I dunno.  Everything.

      This lands on Callie.  She s never had the privilege of 
      believing there was enough for everyone.

                                    BRANDON (CONT D)
                  It s a good thing I didn t.  Their 
                  mom s a total mess - she couldn t 
                  take care of herself much less two 
                  little kids.  

                                    CALLIE
                  At least they have a mom.

                                    BRANDON
                    Actually, they have two, now.

      Oh.  Right.

                                    BRANDON (CONT D)
                  But you - do you know your mom?  Is 
                  she - around?  Is she -

                                    CALLIE
                          (simply)
                  Dead.  She s dead.

      Brandon wasn t quite prepared for this response.

                                    BRANDON
                  Oh.  Sorry.

      Callie shrugs, smiles a little, shakes off his pity.  

                                    CALLIE
                  Don t be.  It is what it is.  

      Brandon s sense of Callie is changed in this moment - for the 
      better.  A little electricity passes between them.        "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"29.


      Just then, a GIRL S VOICE calls out from behind Brandon.

                                    GIRL (O.S.) 
                  Hey, baby!  Who s this?

      Brandon looks over, smiles at TALYA (16, beautiful, boho 
      chic), who is standing in the doorway.  Talya is the kind of 
      girl who isn t interested in how pretty she is, which makes 
      her surprisingly cool and fun to be around.

                                    BRANDON
                  Hey, Talya.  This is Callie.  
                          (beat)
                  She s staying with us for a while.

      Talya kisses Brandon on the mouth, then offers her hand to 
      Callie.

                                      GIRL/TALYA
                  Hey.  Welcome to Riley.

      Callie manages something that passes for a smile and shakes 
      her hand.

                                    CALLIE
                    Thanks.

      Talya wraps her arm over Brandon s shoulder.  A moment of 
      silence.  Brandon jumps in.

                                    BRANDON
                    Callie s gonna be in Timothy s class 
                  with you, T.  Can you show her where 
                  it is?

                                    TALYA
                  Yeah, sure, of course.  But we should 
                  go.  Timothy gets all parental when 
                  we re late.  And I don t wanna make 
                  him mad - I totally didn t do the 
                    reading last night, gonna have to 
                  wing it...

      And they head out the door, leaving Brandon alone with his 
      piano.


      INT. RILEY CHARTER - CLASSROOM - DAY

      Callie, Talya and about a DOZEN STUDENTS sit in big chairs in 
      a circle, where TIMOTHY (30s, hip) leads a discussion about 
      Kafka s METAMORPHOSIS.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"30.


                                    TIMOTHY
                  - but do you think he participated in 
                  his own transformation?  Did he will 
                  it?  Did he want it to happen?  Or 
                  did it happen to him?

      Talya looks over at Callie and winks.  Then she jumps in, even 
      though she has no idea what she s talking about.

                                    TALYA
                  Huh.  That s a really interesting 
                    question, Timothy.  Because, I mean, 
                  you could really argue it both ways.  
                  Did he want it to happen?  Or did it 
                  happen to him?  I totally see both 
                    sides...

      Callie laughs to herself, starts looking around the room.  The 
      BOY next to her shifts in his seat, and his HEAVY KEYCHAIN 
      jangles on the wood.  Callie looks at it, gets an idea.

      Timothy tries to engage her in the conversation.

                                    TIMOTHY
                  What about you, Callie?  I know you 
                    haven t read the material, but what 
                  would you do if you suddenly woke up 
                  and found yourself living a 
                    nightmare? 

                                    CALLIE
                          (without blinking)
                  If I was living a nightmare?

      Timothy s not quite sure what to say - neither is anyone else.


      EXT. RILEY CHARTER SCHOOL - QUAD - DAY

      Jesus trots up behind Mariana.

                                    JESUS
                  Hey.

                                    MARIANA
                  Oh.  Hey.

      They walk a few steps in silence.

                                    JESUS
                  So I been thinking - I ll go with 
                  you.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"31.


                                    MARIANA
                  What?

                                    JESUS
                  To meet Ana.  I ll go with you.  If 
                  you want.

      Mariana gets a little awkward.

                                    MARIANA
                  You don t even want to meet her.

                                    JESUS
                    I know...

      A beat.  

                                    MARIANA
                  I told you - I don t think I m ready.

                                    JESUS
                    I know, that s why I wanna go with 
                  you...

                                    MARIANA
                  No, thanks.

      And she walks away, leaving Jesus more confused than ever.


      EXT. RILEY CHARTER - BREEZEWAY - DAY

      Callie comes out of class and trots over to the BOY WITH THE 
      KEYCHAIN.  She puts on her most seductive smile.

                                    CALLIE
                  Hey, um - what s your name?

      He slows down.

                                    BOY
                  Aiden.

                                    CALLIE
                  Nice to meet you, Aiden.

                                    BOY/AIDEN
                  You new here?

                                    CALLIE
                  Yeah.  Yup.  New girl.  Just, um, 
                  moved here.  I could really use 
                    someone to show me around...      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"32.


                                    AIDEN
                  That could probably be arranged...

      He s playing it cool, but he s definitely into her.  Callie, 
      however, is after something here - something specific.

                                    CALLIE
                  Yeah?  Cool.  In fact, I was kinda 
                    thinking about checking out San 
                  Ysidro this afternoon.

                                    AIDEN
                          (instantly put off)
                  San Ysidro?  Down by Tijuana?

                                    CALLIE
                  Yeah.  I heard it s cool down there.

                                    AIDEN
                            (cautiously)
                  What, are you looking to party or 
                    something?

                                    CALLIE
                  No, no.  I just - I got someone I 
                  need to see.  
                          (then, glancing at his 
                            keychain)
                  You got a car, right?

      And suddenly he sees through her facade.  And then he notices 
      the remnant of her black eye.  He shuts down entirely.

                                    AIDEN
                  Yeah.  No thanks.  Good luck.

      And he walks away.  Fuck.


      INT. RILEY CHARTER - LIBRARY - DAY

      Mariana sits at one of the school computers, logs on to her 
      Facebook account.  She goes straight to her messages, opens 
      one from someone named ANA GUTIERREZ.  It reads I M SO HAPPY 
      I M GOING TO GET TO SEE YOU.  CAN YOU MEET TONIGHT?

      Mariana looks at it for a long time, not sure exactly how to 
      respond.  After a long moment of going back and forth in her 
      head, she types YES.  AS LONG AS IT S AFTER DINNER.  MEET YOU 
      AT WESTERN HILLS PARK, AS SOON AS I CAN GET THERE.  She 
      presses send.

                                      END OF ACT THREE      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"33.


                                        ACT FOUR


      EXT. RILEY CHARTER - QUAD - DAY

      It s lunchtime.  Kids litter the quad, sitting on the grass or 
      the few tables in pairs or threesomes or foursomes or 
      moresomes.  Mariana is eating lunch with a couple of LATINA 
        GIRLFRIENDS, speaking Spanish, when she overhears Callie 
      talking to a STUDENT nearby.

                                    CALLIE
                  Hey.  Is there a metro stop around 
                  here?

      Mariana crosses to her.

                                    MARIANA
                          (with attitude)
                  You going somewhere?  Gotta meet your 
                  pimp?

                                    CALLIE
                  You wanna back the hell off, Selena 
                  Gomez?

      Callie glares at her, turns to go, then stops.

                                    CALLIE (CONT D)
                  You know, I didn t ask to be brought 
                  into your house, okay?  I m not 
                  trying to steal your family or 
                    something.  

                                    MARIANA
                  You can have  em.  They re pissing me 
                  off.

                                    CALLIE
                            (cautiously)
                  Why?

                                    MARIANA
                  Lena is always in my face, and Stef 
                  jumps down my throat every time I 
                  open my mouth.

      Callie nods - she gets it.

                                    CALLIE
                  Well what do you expect, your mom s a 
                  cop...      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"34.


                                    MARIANA
                  She remind you of the guards from 
                  juvie?
                          (then, off Callie s face)
                  Jesus told me.  What d you do?

      A beat.  Of course he did.  Callie considers whether to take 
      Mariana in her confidence.

                                    CALLIE
                  My foster dad did something really 
                    screwed up, so - I took a baseball 
                  bat to his beloved Mustang.

      Mariana s eyes get wide.

                                    MARIANA
                    Seriously?  That s bad ass.

      Callie shrugs.  

                                    CALLIE
                  Keep it to yourself?

      Mariana agrees.  A beat.

                                    MARIANA
                  So are you leaving?

                                    CALLIE
                  I got some stuff I gotta take care 
                  of.

      Mariana looks at her curiously.

                                    CALLIE (CONT D)
                  Sorry.  Better if you don t know.  
                  That way, if your moms start asking 
                    questions -

      Mariana gets it - she s got secrets of her own.  As Callie 
      turns to head for the front entrance - 

                                    MARIANA
                  Wait.  If you re gonna take off, make 
                  sure you go out the back way - Lena s 
                  office looks out over the front 
                    entrance.  The Metro s three blocks 
                  that way.

      Callie smiles, nods - these two have come to a small, but 
      important, understanding.  The BELL RINGS.  Both girls head 
      off in separate directions.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"35.


      ELSEWHERE ON THE QUAD - Lena stands near the rear exit, 
      talking to a FIRST YEAR TEACHER.  

                                    LENA
                    Believe me, I get it.  I ve got four 
                  of them at home right now.  They can 
                  make you absolutely homicidal.  But 
                  you cannot, under any circumstances, 
                  let them see that they re getting the 
                  better of you, okay?  I learned a 
                  long time ago that as soon as I raise 
                  my voice I lose my power...

      Lena looks over and spots CALLIE HEADED HER DIRECTION.  She 
      waves.  

      With a sigh, Callie changes directions and goes to class.


      INT. POLICE PRECINCT - CAPTAIN S OFFICE - DAY

      CAPTAIN ROBERTS (50s, fatherly) looks up from his desk as Stef 
      enters his office.  MIKE (almost 40, handsome, average joe) 
      stands off to one side.  Stef looks at him quizzically.

                                    CAPTAIN ROBERTS
                          (teasing her)
                  You okay?  You re not gonna start 
                  crying are you?

                                    STEF
                  With all due respect, Sir - screw 
                  you.

      Roberts laughs.

                                    CAPTAIN ROBERTS
                  Well, Vasquez was a pain in my ass, 
                  so as far as I m concerned, 
                    Sacramento can have him.  You re too 
                  good of a cop to be taking care of a 
                    hothead like that anyway. 
                          (then)
                  Now, since you re both partner-less, 
                    starting tomorrow I m gonna pair you 
                  up with Mike.  

      Stef s eyes get wide.

                                    STEF
                  Sir?

                                    CAPTAIN ROBERTS
                  That a problem?      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"36.


      Stef looks around, clearly taken aback.  She looks at Mike, 
      who explains.

                                    MIKE
                    I asked.  That cool?

      Stef considers this a moment, then...

                                    STEF
                  Sure.  No problem.  Sir.

                                    CAPTAIN ROBERTS
                  Good.  Take the rest of the day off, 
                  you guys can hit the beat tomorrow.

      Stef looks at Mike, something strange passing between them, 
      then back to the Captain.

                                    STEF
                    Yessir.


      EXT. RILEY CHARTER - QUAD - DAY/LATER

      The BELL RINGS.  Students flood the breezeways.  Brandon walks 
      with Talya.  His phone BUZZES.  He looks at the screen - SAN 
      YSIDRO, CALIFORNIA.  He IGNORES the call.

                                    TALYA
                  So... my parents are out of town this 
                    weekend.

      Brandon smirks at her.

                                    BRANDON
                  Oh yeah?

                                    TALYA
                  Yup.  Wanna spend the night?

      She puts her hand through Brandon s arm.

                                    BRANDON
                  I d have to sneak out.  

                                    TALYA
                  Or just tell  em you re staying - 

      Brandon looks at her, with a smirk.  Then, out of the corner 
      of his eye, he notices CALLIE HEADED OFF CAMPUS.  He takes 
      off.

                                    TALYA (CONT D)
                  - at Aiden s.  Where are you going?      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"37.


                                    BRANDON
                  Gimme two secs.  Hey, Callie!

      Brandon trots across the lawn, chasing after his new foster 
      sister.

      ELSEWHERE - Mariana hangs by her locker with some girlfriends 
      when Jesus comes striding over, his hand out.

                                    JESUS
                  Hey.  I need some money.

                                    MARIANA
                  Um, rude much?  No - you ve got your 
                  own money.  

                                    JESUS
                  I left my wallet at home.  C mon, I m 
                    hungry.  I didn t eat lunch.

                                    MARIANA
                  Too bad for you.  

                                    JESUS
                  I just want a snack.  I ll pay you 
                    back...  

                                    MARIANA
                  No, you won t.  You never pay me 
                  back, because you never have any 
                  money, because you always spend it on 
                  surf stuff.  So no...

      Mariana turns back to her friends.  

                                    MARIANA (CONT D)
                          (in Spanish)
                  So what were you saying?  Sorry...

      Jesus grabs her purse out of her locker, takes out her wallet.

                                    JESUS
                  Look, just gimme five bucks.  I 
                    promise I ll pay you back tonight.

                                    MARIANA
                  Jesus!  Gimme that!

      She turns to grab her wallet from him, but it s too late - 
      he s opened it to find a WAD OF CASH, mostly twenties and 
      fifties, several hundred dollars all tolled.  He holds it up.

                                    JESUS
                  What is this?      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"38.


      She grabs it from him, stuffs it back in her purse.

                                    MARIANA
                    Nothing.

                                    JESUS
                  Bull.  Where did you get that?

                                    MARIANA
                  Don t worry about it.

      She peels off a five dollar bill and shoves it in his hand.

                                    MARIANA (CONT D)
                  Here.  Now go get something to eat 
                  and leave me alone.

      Jesus knows better than to push her when she s this angry, but 
      he also knows she s lying through her teeth.  He gives her a 
      look, then walks away.

      BACK TO Brandon AND CALLIE - Callie is being more stand-offish 
      than usual.

                                    BRANDON
                  So... where you going?

                                    CALLIE
                  I ve got some stuff to take care of.

                                    BRANDON
                  Stuff to take care of?  Right now? 

                                    CALLIE
                  It s important.

      Brandon looks over and catches Talya staring at them, 
      displeased.  He almost unconsciously takes half a step back 
      from Callie

                                    BRANDON
                  Well, you re not gonna be able to 
                  take care of it if you end up back in 
                  juvie.  My mom s a cop - do you 
                    seriously think she won t track you 
                  down in like a minute flat?  

      Callie loses it.

                                    CALLIE
                  Why can t you just stay out of my 
                    goddamn business!  Your whole 
                    freaking family!      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"39.


                                    BRANDON
                  We re just trying to help you...

                                    CALLIE
                  Well stop!

      Before Brandon can reply, his phone BUZZES.  He pulls it out 
      of his pocket, looks at it, annoyed.

                                    BRANDON
                  God.  Someone s been calling me from 
                  this number all day...

      Callie grabs the phone from him.  

                                    BRANDON (CONT D)
                  Hey - 

      She looks at the screen, then answers.

                                    CALLIE
                  Hey, baby, it s me.  What s going on?

      Brandon overhears something.  It sounds something like a teen 
      boy saying YOU GOTTA GET ME OF HERE.

                                    CALLIE (CONT D)
                  What?  What do you mean?
                          (a beat)
                  Jude, what are you saying?

      Someone interrupts the call.  Callie gets mad.

                                    CALLIE (CONT D)
                  Let me talk to Jude.
                          (a beat)
                  Put him back on!

      The line goes dead.  Callie dials a number and presses send - 
      but no one answers.

      Brandon stares at her, disturbed by what he overheard.  Callie 
      is clearly devastated.  

                                    BRANDON
                  What s going on?  Who was that?  And 
                  why were they calling my number?

                                    CALLIE
                    I borrowed your phone last night.  
                  Look, I gotta go.  Now.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"40.


                                    BRANDON
                  So who was that?  Your boyfriend or 
                    something?

      Callie looks at him, shakes her head.

                                    CALLIE
                  No.  It s my brother.

      Not the answer Brandon was expecting.  He takes in her scared 
      but determined face. 

                                    CALLIE (CONT D)
                  He s all I got.

                                    BRANDON
                  Let me call my mom.  She can help.

      Callie is instantly against it.

                                    CALLIE
                  Who?  Stef?  No way.

                                    BRANDON
                  She s a -

                                    CALLIE
                  No cops.  I don t trust -

                                    BRANDON
                  My mom s not like that.

                                    CALLIE
                  If you call your mom she s gonna look 
                  in the system and find all these 
                    complaints my foster father filed 
                    against me.  I kept trying to tell 
                  the police my side of the story, but 
                  they didn t care.  And then they 
                    arrested me instead of him.  You re 
                  just gonna get me sent back to juvie 
                  and Jude is still gonna be stuck in 
                  that house.
                          (then)
                    I gotta go.  I gotta go now.

      And she takes off, leaving Brandon to decide who he wants to 
      be - the good boy he s always been, or the great man he might 
      become.  He watches her disappear through the rear gate - and 
      after a deep breath, he takes off after her.

                                        ACT FIVE


      EXT. STREET - DAY

      Brandon comes up behind Callie, who is moving at quite a clip.

                                    CALLIE
                  I m not coming back.

                                    BRANDON
                  I m not asking you to.  I m coming 
                  with you.

      Callie is shocked to hear this.  And not 100% sure she trusts 
      him.  She stops.

                                    CALLIE
                  You re not gonna call your mom?

      He shakes his head.  A beat.

                                    CALLIE (CONT D)
                  Okay.

      And together they take off down the street.


      INT. METRO TRAIN - DAY

      Brandon and Callie sit tensely on the subway, Callie deep in 
      thought.  Brandon notices their knees are touching and looks 
      over at her.  Callie suddenly remembers something.  

                                    CALLIE
                  Don t you have that music thing 
                    tonight?

                                    BRANDON
                  It s just a - don t worry.  There ll 
                  be others.

      A beat.  She looks at him gratefully.

                                    BRANDON (CONT D)
                  So what happened?  In the house?

      Callie takes a breath.

                                    CALLIE
                          (matter of fact)
                    Well... 
                                    (MORE)      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"42.

                                    CALLIE (CONT'D)
                  my foster father caught my brother 
                    wearing one of his ex-wife s dresses, 
                  and started beating the crap out of 
                  him.

                                    BRANDON
                    Seriously?  He hit him?

      Callie nods, half-laughs.

                                    CALLIE
                  Um, yeah.  He used to hit me all the 
                  time, which, you know, whatever... 
                  But when I saw him going after Jude, 
                  I just went nuts.

      Brandon knows what it means to protect your siblings.

                                    CALLIE (CONT D)
                  So I got his baseball bat and whacked 
                  him on the knees.  And then I went 
                    outside and beat the hell out of his 
                  car.  When the cops came, he told 
                  them he was defending himself.  
                  Nobody seemed to care much about my 
                  side of the story.

                                    BRANDON
                  If he was so awful to you guys, why 
                  was he even a foster father in the 
                  first place?

      Callie looks at him with a knowing laugh.

                                    CALLIE
                  The money.  He doesn t have a job, 
                  so...

      Brandon is horrified to hear this.  After a moment, he places 
      his hand on her knee, as reassurance.  She looks down at it, 
      unsure what to do, as the train rockets through the city.


      INT. FOSTER HOUSE - JESUS  ROOM - DAY

      Jesus flops across his bed, playing a surf game on his 
      computer.  Lena appears.

                                    LENA
                          (casually)
                  So - what s going on with Mariana?      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"43.


                                    JESUS
                          (playing dumb)
                    Whaddaya mean?

                                    LENA
                  Has she said anything to you?  Any 
                  idea what s up with her?

                                    JESUS
                    I dunno.  Maybe it s her time of the-

                                    LENA
                          (playfully)
                  If you say,  Time of the month,  I m 
                  going to sign you up for a Women s 
                  Health Workshop at Planned 
                    Parenthood.  Don t ever say that in a 
                  house full of women.  

                                    JESUS
                  Okay, fine.  Jeez.

                                    LENA
                  And you re sure you don t want to 
                  meet with Ana?  Don t you think it 
                  would be good to have some, um, 
                    cultural influences?  Someone to ask 
                  about your heritage?  I know for me 
                    growing up in a white neighborhood, 
                  it was really important to hear 
                  family stories and things.  Helped me 
                  feel less... out of place.

      He shrugs, shakes his head.  It s just not his thing.  Mariana 
      comes upstairs, listens from the hall.

                                    LENA (CONT D)
                  Well, if M says anything or you 
                  notice anything, let me know, okay?

      Mariana can t believe what she s hearing, gets furious.

                                    MARIANA
                  You want him to spy on me?
                          (then, in Spanish)
                  You might as well put me in juvie 
                  like Callie!

                                    LENA
                    Mariana...

      She storms into her room, slams the door.  Lena looks to 
      Jesus, who just laughs at her.  Stef s voice rings out from 
      downstairs.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"44.


                                    STEF (O.S.)
                  I m home!


      INT. FOSTER HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

      Stef is shoving some string cheese into her mouth, staring off 
      into space, when Lena descends upon her.

                                    LENA
                  So Mariana overheard me asking Jesus 
                  if something was going on with her 
                  and completely flipped out on me. 

                                    STEF
                  Okay.  We ll talk to her.  So listen -

                                    LENA 
                  You re gonna have to talk to her, 
                    because I swear I m going to lose it!  

                                    STEF
                  Okay, fine.  Can we get into this 
                  later?  I m not in a great mood - 
                  today was Vasquez s last day.

      Lena feels horrible, shifts gears.

                                    LENA
                  Oh.  Right.  I forgot.  You okay?

      Stef nods.

                                    STEF
                  And in other exciting news - guess 
                  who they re partnering me with now?

                                    LENA
                  Who?

                                    STEF
                  Mike.

      Lena actually falls speechless.  A beat. 

                                    STEF (CONT D)
                    I guess he asked for me.

                                    LENA
                          (not cool with this)
                    Uh-huh.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"45.


                                    STEF
                  Oh, God.  Don t go all non-verbal on 
                  me.  It s fine.

      It may be, but Lena is not.  Stef goes to the fridge, grabs 
      herself a beer.  The DOORBELL RINGS.  


      INT. FOSTER HOUSE - FOYER - DAY

      Lena opens the front door to reveal MIKE, still in his 
      uniform.  She looks at him dryly, raises an eyebrow.

                                    MIKE
                  Hey.  You guys ready?

                                    LENA
                    Brandon!  Your dad s here!  Time for 
                  your contest!

      No answer.  They wait an uncomfortable moment.

                                    LENA (CONT D)
                  He ll be down in a second.  I think 
                  he s nervous.  Brandon!

      The tension is so thick you would need a hacksaw to cut it.  

                                    LENA (CONT D)
                  So I hear you and Stef are gonna be 
                  back on the beat together.

                                    MIKE
                  Oh.  Yup.

                                    LENA
                            (territorially)
                  Stef said you asked for her?

      A breath, while Mike figures out how to explain.

                                    MIKE
                  Look, it was either me or some 
                    rookie.  I never felt comfortable 
                  when she was working with Vasquez.  I 
                  just - I feel better knowing I m 
                    around.  I mean, we ve got the kids 
                  to think about.

      Lena takes a deep breath of her own.  She s a little 
      embarrassed by her assumptions.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"46.


                                    LENA
                  Oh, okay.  Thanks.
                          (then, lightly)
                    I mean, the feminist in me is 
                    offended, but as her wife, you 
                    know... thanks.

                                    MIKE
                  Don t tell Stef I said that, okay?

      Lena shakes her head - of course not.  Another moment passes 
      between them.

                                    LENA
                  Mind if we take separate cars?  Stef 
                  and I can meet you there.

      He agrees.  Another beat.

                                    LENA (CONT D)
                  God, where is that kid?  

      Stef wanders in from the kitchen, nods at Mike.

                                    STEF
                    Brandon!  Let s go!  You re gonna be 
                  late!

      Jesus appears at the top of the stairs.

                                    JESUS
                  He s not here.

                                    STEF
                  Wait.  Where s Callie?

                                    JESUS
                    I haven t seen them since school.

      Stef and Lena share a concerned look.  This isn t like 
      Brandon.  

                                    STEF
                  So where the hell are they?


      EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT

      Dusk has just fallen.  Brandon follows a step or two behind 
      Callie, who storms up the street on a mission.

                  He s not answering.

                  Guys, I m sure he s fine.  Let s not 
                  freak out.  Maybe he thought we were 
                  gonna meet him over there?  At the 
                    contest?

      Maybe...

                                    MIKE (CONT D)
                  Why don t I head over there and 
                  check.

      Stef nods, and he heads out the door.  Then she gets an idea.

                                    STEF
                  Jesus - hand me my phone.

      He reaches across the counter and hands it to her.

                                    JESUS
                  Who you gonna call?

                                    STEF
                    Nobody.

      She starts up an app on her cell.

                                    STEF (CONT D)
                  I put that tracking app on all our 
                    phones, since you -
                          (to Jesus)
                  - are always leaving yours 
                    everywhere.

      Lena hangs up, rejoins the conversation.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"48.


                                    LENA
                  She says the last time she saw him he 
                  was talking to Callie before seventh 
                    period.  Maybe Mike s right - maybe 
                  we re over-reacting.

      Stef checks the screen in front of her

                                    STEF
                  If we re over-reacting - what are 
                  they doing in San Ysidro?

      A beat.  Nobody has an answer.  Stef shoots Lena an I-TOLD-YOU-
        THIS-WAS-A-BAD-IDEA look.

                                    LENA
                  Are they going to Tijuana?

                                    STEF
                  I m gonna kill him.  Where are my 
                  keys?

                                    JESUS
                  You want us to come?

                                    STEF
                  No, stay here with your sister.  
                  We ll be back soon.

                                    LENA
                  Don t forget to take your pill.  And 
                  finish your homework.

      And she and Lena take off.  Jesus opens one of the cabinets, 
      pulls out his bottle of Ritalin, opens it.  He dumps one into 
      his hand when he notices that there are VERY FEW LEFT.  


      INT. FOSTER HOUSE - MARIANA S ROOM - NIGHT

      Mariana watches out her bedroom window as Stef and Lena pull 
      out of the driveway.  She immediately grabs her purse and is 
      headed for the door when Jesus appears in the hall.

                                    JESUS
                    Brandon and Callie are missing...
                          (then)
                  Where are you going?

                                    MARIANA
                  What do you mean, missing?

                                    JESUS
                  They never came home from school.        "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"49.


                                    MARIANA
                  Oh.  Huh.  I guess Brandon went with 
                  her.

                                    JESUS
                  Where?

                                    MARIANA
                  She wouldn t tell me...

      Mariana is clearly trying to get out of her room, but Jesus 
      doesn t clear the door.

                                    JESUS
                  Hey - you didn t take any of my 
                    Ritalin, did you?

      Mariana freezes, just for a millisecond.

                                    MARIANA
                  What?  No, why?

                                    JESUS
                   Cause Mom just picked me up a new 
                    bottle, and now it s almost gone.

                                    MARIANA
                  What are you looking at me for?

                                    JESUS
                  I was just asking.

      She s avoiding eye contact with him.  But he s onto her.

                                    MARIANA
                  Well ask Brandon.  Or Callie.  Now 
                  excuse me, I gotta go.

      She tries to push past him into the hall, but Jesus stops her.

                                    JESUS
                  Is that how you got all that money?  
                          (then)
                  Are you selling my freaking pills?

                                    MARIANA
                  Wha-  No...

                                    JESUS
                   Cause Mama sure as hell didn t give 
                  you that big wad of cash.  Or did 
                  she?  Should I ask her?

      Her silence is the only confession he needs to hear.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"50.


                                    JESUS (CONT D)
                  Why?  Why would you do that?  It s so 
                  damn stupid.  What the hell do you 
                  need all that money for, anyway?

      A long beat.  Mariana decides to tell him the truth.

                                    MARIANA
                  I been talking to Ana.

                                    JESUS
                  Ana, our birth mom?

      Mariana nods.  Jesus can t believe what she s saying.

                                    MARIANA
                  She got back in town last month. 

                                    JESUS
                  Wait - what?  I thought you didn t 
                  want to meet her...

                                    MARIANA
                  No - I just didn t want Stef and Lena 
                    sticking their noses all up in my 
                    business, okay?  They wouldn t get 
                  it.  Ana needs some money.  I just 
                  want to help her out a little.

                                    JESUS
                  You re giving her money?  For what?

      Mariana shrugs.  He glances over to her desk, where she has a 
      FRAMED PHOTO of the two of them, at THREE YEARS OLD, sitting 
      on the lap of a WOMAN in her mid-twenties (who looks 
      remarkably like JENNIFER LOPEZ), all smiling radiantly.

                                    JESUS (CONT D)
                  Why?

                                    MARIANA
                    Whaddaya mean, why?   Cause she s our 
                  mom.

                                    JESUS
                  She s not our mom!  Our moms live 
                  here, in this house!  What the hell 
                  is wrong with you?

                                    MARIANA
                  I knew you wouldn t understand.  
                  That s why I didn t tell you.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"51.


                                    JESUS
                    Understand what?!  That woman is not 
                  our mom, Mariana.  She freaking 
                    abandoned us!  That woman -

      Jesus grabs the framed photo, RIPS open the back of the frame 
      and yanks out the picture.  He shoves it in Mariana s face.

                                    JESUS (CONT D)
                  This woman is not our mother.  She s 
                    a monster who left her two babies so 
                  she run off with some dumbass and 
                  screw whoever she wanted!  This. 
                  Woman. Is. Not. Our. Mother.

      And with every word, he tears the photograph into smaller and 
      smaller pieces.  

                                    MARIANA
                  Jesus, stop!

      But it s too late.  Mariana starts to cry, in spite of 
      herself.  It s obvious how much Ana represents to her.  

                                    JESUS
                    I thought you were supposed to be the 
                  smart one.

      As soon as he is gone, Mariana takes the pieces of the photo 
      and starts taping them back together, her heart as broken as 
      the picture.


      INT./EXT. XTERRA - NIGHT

      Stef drives as Lena stares out the window apprehensively.  
      Stef s phone rings.  Lena picks it up, looks at it, answers 
      it.

                                    LENA
                  Hey, it s Lena.

                                                                            INTERCUT


      INT. HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

      Mike stands inside the auditorium, looking through the CROWD 
      for some sign of Brandon.

                                    MIKE
                  No sign of him here.  He hasn t 
                    checked in yet either.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"52.


                                    LENA
                  We tracked his phone.  He s in San 
                    Ysidro.  We were afraid they were 
                  headed to TJ but it doesn t look like 
                  it.  We re on our way now.  I ll call 
                  you as soon as I hear something.

      And she hangs up, the urgency filling the silence.


      EXT. MODEST HOUSE - NIGHT

      A modest house in a nondescript neighborhood.  A DENTED 
      MUSTANG sits in the driveway.  Callie drops her backpack 
      silently on the patchy grass, and signals to Brandon with a 
      head nod.  He goes to the front door and KNOCKS.  

                                    BRANDON
                  Hello?  Anyone there?  Can you help 
                  me?  I m lost...

      Callie sneaks over to one of the windows on the side of the 
      house and taps on it lightly.

                                    CALLIE
                          (just louder than a 
                            whisper)
                  Jude?  Jude?  

      No response.  Callie taps again.

                                    CALLIE (CONT D)
                          (a little louder)
                  Jude?  

      A light turns on in the house.  Callie drops to the ground.  
      Brandon knocks again.

                                    BRANDON
                  Hello?  Anybody home?

      Callie gets up, tries once more.

                                    CALLIE
                  Jude?

      Still nothing from Jude.  The front door opens.  JIM PIERSON 
      (40s, imposing) peers out through the screen.

                                    PIERSON
                  Can I help you?

      Callie disappears around the back of the small bungalow.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"53.


                                    BRANDON
                  Um, yessir.  I was... I was just...  
                  I m looking for the, um, Metro?

                                    PIERSON
                  The Metro s a few miles from here.

                                    BRANDON
                    Yessir.  Guess I got kinda lost.

      Over Pierson s shoulder, Brandon can see all the way to the 
      back of the tiny house, where Callie slips in the kitchen 
      door.  She creeps into the house as quietly as she can.

                                    PIERSON
                  Well, you gotta go about six blocks -

      Callie steps just a little too hard, making a small THUD.  
      Pierson whips around.

                                    PIERSON (CONT D)
                  What the hell are you doing in here?  
                  Get outta my house.

                                    CALLIE
                  I just want to see Jude.  Just for a 
                    minute.

                                    PIERSON
                  No.

      She moves toward the hallway.  Pierson grabs her by the arm.

                                    PIERSON (CONT D)
                  I said No!  You made a lot of trouble 
                  for me the last time you were here.

                                    BRANDON
                  Hey!  Don t touch her!  

      Brandon reaches for Pierson.  Pierson whips around and shoves 
      Brandon against the wall.

                                    CALLIE
                  Look, I m sorry about your car.  I ll 
                  pay to have it fixed.  I just want to 
                  talk to Jude, okay - please?

      She shakes him off.  He grabs for her, but she slips past him.

                                    CALLIE (CONT D)
                  Jude!

      Pierson opens a desk drawer and pulls out a gun.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"54.


                                    BRANDON
                    Callie!

                                    PIERSON
                  Get the hell outta my house!

      She freezes.

                                    BRANDON
                  Hey, man!  Calm down.

                                    PIERSON
                  Don t you move.


      EXT. MODEST HOUSE - NIGHT

      Just then, Stef and Lena pull up in Stef s XTerra.  Stef, 
      (still in uniform) jumps out and sprints to the front door.  
      Through the window, she can see Pierson with his gun drawn.  
      She pulls out her pistol.

                                    STEF
                    Brandon, get back!
                          (then)
                    Freeze!  Police!

      Pierson puts his hands up.  

                                    STEF (CONT D)
                  Set down the gun, slowly.  

      He does.  As soon as he lets go of the gun, Callie DASHES DOWN 
      THE HALL.

                                    PIERSON
                    Damnit!  Tell her to stay outta my 
                    goddamn house!

                                    STEF
                  Don t you move!  Now back away.  And 
                  get on your knees.

      Callie comes out of the back with JUDE (13, artistic, 
        effeminate).

      Stef and Lena watch as Callie hugs this boy.  There s a 
      softness to Callie in this moment, a vulnerability not seen 
      before.

                                    CALLIE
                  You okay?      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"55.


                                    JUDE
                  Yeah.

      She notices that Jude has a BAD BRUISE on his arm.

                                    CALLIE
                  Did he hurt you?

      Jude doesn t answer.  Brandon walks over to Lena.

                                    LENA
                  Who is that?

                                    BRANDON
                  That s her brother.

      Not the answer Lena was expecting.  Stef snaps cuffs on 
      Pierson, then leads him outside.


      EXT. MODEST HOUSE - NIGHT

      Stef sits Pierson down on the gravel drive.  Lena leads 
      Callie, Brandon and Jude out of the house.  After a moment, 
      Lena makes her way over to Stef.

                                    STEF
                  So what do we do now?  Call Child 
                    Protective Services?

      A beat.  Lena looks at her, something hopeful in her 
      expression.  Stef knows where this is headed.

                                    STEF (CONT D)
                          (quietly)
                    Lena...

                                    LENA
                  We can t - send these kids away...

                                    STEF
                  We don t have enough room as it is.

                                    LENA
                  We ll make room.  

      Stef looks to Brandon.  He nods his approval.  With a sigh, 
      Stef surrenders.  Lena smiles, turns to Callie.

                                    LENA (CONT D)
                    Callie, introduce us.

      Callie leads Jude over.  She is a little hesitant, afraid 
      there might be consequences for her actions.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"56.


                                    CALLIE
                  This is Lena and Stef.  This is Jude.

      Jude hangs back, uncertain.  Callie takes in Lena s face.

                                    CALLIE (CONT D)
                  It s okay - they re on our side.

      Slowly, Jude reaches out his hand.  Lena takes it.

                                    LENA
                  Nice to meet you, Jude. 


      EXT. PARK - NIGHT

      Mariana sits on the top of a damp picnic table, under the 
      harsh glow of a street lamp.  She holds the taped-up photo in 
      her hands, tracing the cracked lines with her fingers.  

                                    ANA (O.S.)
                    Mariana?

      Mariana looks up to see her birth mother ANA (40s, beautiful 
      but tired), for the first time in over a decade.  She swallows 
      and stands up.

                                    MARIANA
                          (quietly)
                  Hey.

      A long moment.  Ana seems even more anxious than Mariana.  Is 
      it just nerves?  Or something else?  

                                    ANA
                  You re really pretty.

                                    MARIANA
                    Thanks.  So are... you.

      Ana just shakes her head.

                                    MARIANA (CONT D)
                  How are you?

                                    ANA
                  I m good, I m good.  Back in town, 
                  you know - trying to get back on my 
                    feet...

      And with that, Ana s agenda becomes pretty transparent.  It 
      hangs in the air, until Mariana reaches in her purse, pulls 
      out the cash.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"57.


                                    MARIANA
                  Oh.  Here.  Hope this helps.

      Ana looks at it, resists the urge to count it.  The 
      humiliation on her face is easy to see.

                                    ANA
                  It will.  Trust me.  Thank you so 
                  much.

      Mariana just nods.

                                    ANA (CONT D)
                    Promise I ll pay you back.  Once I 
                  get a job and stuff...

      Now that Ana has the money, she s ready to go.

                                    ANA (CONT D)
                  So... you better get home, huh?  Your 
                    folks ll be wondering where you 
                  are...

      And suddenly it all clicks for Mariana.  This is not going to 
      be the mother-and-child-reunion of her fantasies.  She 
      hardens, just a bit.

                                    MARIANA
                  My moms.

                                    ANA
                  What?

                                    MARIANA
                  My moms will be wondering where I am.  

      Ana nods - right.  Another beat.

                                    ANA
                  Okay.  Well...

      And she gives Mariana a very awkward hug.  Ana s eyes well 
      with tears that do not fall.  As she turns to go, she holds up 
      the money.

                                    ANA (CONT D)
                  Thanks again.

      Mariana nods, then watches as Ana disappears into the dark.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"58.


      EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - NIGHT

      As they load Jude s few things into the back of the car,  Lena 
      gives Brandon a stern look, shakes her head.

                                    BRANDON
                  I was trying to do the right thing.  

      It s true.  A moment.  

                                    LENA
                  I get it.  But you re still in all 
                  kinds of trouble.  We ll talk about 
                  it later.

      He wisely chooses not to argue.

      ELSEWHERE - Stef gets a moment alone with Callie.

                                    STEF
                  So I need to ask you... Why didn t 
                  you come to us?  

      Callie has nothing left to lose, tells the truth.

                                    CALLIE
                  The last time I told a cop the truth, 
                    I ended up in jail.

                                    STEF
                  Well I m really sorry to hear that.  
                  I m a cop, but I m telling you, I m 
                  not like that.

                                    CALLIE
                  Look, if you guys wanna send me back 
                  to juvie now, at least I know Jude ll 
                  be somewhere safe.

                                    STEF
                    Callie, I want you to listen to me - 
                  we re not going to send you back, 
                  like you re a... bad steak or 
                    something.  You re not disposable.  
                  You re not worthless.

      These words land hard on Callie.  It s the first time in her 
      life she s heard something like this.  If she were a different 
      girl, she would cry.  But she s not a different girl, so she 
      simply lowers her eyes to the ground and nods her head.

      Stef places a hand on her shoulder with a smile.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"59.


                                    STEF (CONT D)
                  Come on - let s go home.

      MUSIC UP:  BRANDON S COMPOSITION

      Brandon s flawless composition starts to play. 


      INT. FOSTER HOUSE - MARIANA S ROOM - NIGHT

      Jesus is searching through Mariana s things, looking for 
      something.  He digs into the bottom of her backpack from 
      school, where he finds a baggie containing a few of his 
      Ritalin pills.  Damn.


      INT./EXT. XTERRA - NIGHT

      Stef and Lena drive Jude, Callie, and Brandon home in silence.  
      Stef places a comforting hand on Lena s leg.

      Callie is draped protectively around Jude.  Brandon stares at 
      her, more taken with this confounding creature than ever.  She 
      looks over at him with a soft smile.  Then something occurs to 
      him.

      Just then, Brandon s music begins to build, but this time 
      there is an ADDITIONAL LAYER - TWO new components adding to 
      the complexity of the piece.  It makes the sound richer, 
      darker even - but also more harmonious.  It s beautiful.  

      Brandon ever so SUBTLY PLAYS AN IMAGINARY KEYBOARD along with 
      the music.  He glows with satisfaction.


      INT. FOSTER HOUSE - JESUS  ROOM - NIGHT

      Jesus pulls up Mariana s name on his cell phone, presses send.


      EXT. PARK - NIGHT

      Mariana sits on the bench, not yet ready to go home.  Her 
      cellphone rings.  She looks at the screen, ignores it.


      INT./EXT. XTERRA - NIGHT

      The SUV cruises down the boulevard, framed by palm trees and 
      the street lamps.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"60.


      EXT. FOSTER HOUSE - NIGHT

      The XTerra pulls into the driveway.  

      Stef, Lena, Brandon, Callie, and Jude tumble out, carrying 
      Jude s few belongings.  Jesus comes out on to the porch to 
      meet them.  Stef introduces him to Jude.  They shake hands.

                                    STEF
                    Where s Mariana?

      Jesus tries to figure out how to answer the question, but is 
      saved as she comes jogging up the driveway.

                                    MARIANA
                  Here I am.
                          (then, off Stef s look)
                  I was over at Blanca s.

      Stef shoots an I m-not-buying-it look to Lena.  Jesus tries to 
      distract them, cover for his sister.

                                    JESUS
                  This is Jude, Callie s brother.

      Mariana smiles and waves hello.  And one by one, they file 
      inside the house, until only Brandon and Callie remain.  As he 
      heads into the house, she grabs him by the wrist and pulls him 
      back onto the porch.  

      They stare at each other for a long moment - something 
      unspeakable passing between them.  Finally...

                                    CALLIE
                  Thank you.

      Stef appears at the door, wondering where they are - and 
      notices the tension.  Callie carefully extracts her hand and 
      goes inside.  

      Stef gestures for Brandon to come in, then closes the front 
      door, shutting out the danger, and heartbreak, and hardship 
      that awaits them all in the rest of the world.  Tonight, they 
      are safe.  Tonight, they are family.  Tonight, they are home.


                                        END OF PILOT.
