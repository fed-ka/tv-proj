    of our characters look directly into camera and communicate
      through BLUETOOTH HEADSETS like a conference call.)

    We see WILL KEEN (The Leader, 30's, husband, father.  An
      EVERYMAN balancing family, work and making time for himself)
      sitting in front of his TV in a nicely furnished home.  He
      holds a PLAYSTATION 3 CONTROLLER and wears a HEADSET.

                                    WILL
                    Rogue719, do you copy?

                                      VOICE (O.S.)
                    You like frag grenades, you little
                    bitch?  I'll give you frag grenades!

                                    WILL
                    Kenny, focus!

      INTERCUT WITH -- KENNY HAYDEN (The Joker, 30's, sarcastic,
      immature, slight geek who doesn't know it) His apartment is
      barely furnished, but littered with TOYS.

                                      KENNY
                    Sorry! This French kid keeps calling
                    me names.  Parle-vous Asshole?

                                    WILL
                    Craig, where are you?

      INTERCUT WITH -- CRAIG GRIFFITH (The Poet, 30's, sensitive,
      heart on his sleeve, falls in love at the drop of a hat)
      sits in a neat/dull apartment.

                                      CRAIG
                    These guys keep sniping me and it
                    respawns me back at the fountain.

                                    WILL
                    Guys!  It's cooler if you respond
                    with Roger, Copy or Over! Got it?

                                      CRAIG/KENNY
                    Fine.  /Whatever.                                                                                        2.

                                    WILL
                          (Rolls his eyes)
                    All right. I'm gonna grab their flag
                    and run it.

                                      KENNY
                    Craig, how do you say "Your mother"
                    in french?

                                      CRAIG
                    Votre Mere.

                                      KENNY
                          (Screaming)
                    Votre Mere, you little baguette!

                                    WILL
                    I got their flag! Kenny, go get the
                    Sniper Rifle and cover me from the
                    East side of the Munitions factory. 
                    If these guys light me up, you get
                    in here and grab this flag.  Craig,
                    protect our base!  I'm running!

      The MUSIC swells on the game as Will plays intently, he is
      CHEERED ON by Kenny and Craig.  Suddenly, the guys all
      celebrate.  Will has successfully captured the flag.

                                    WILL (CONT'D)
                          (Yelling)
                    Yeah! Who's the man?!

                                      KENNY
                    You're the man!

                                      CRAIG
                    You are definitely the man.

                                    WILL
                    I'm the MAN!!  I'M THE MAN!!

                                      WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Will!  The kids are sleeping!

      Will immediately winces. 

                                    WILL
                    Sorry, honey. 
                          (Whispering cheer)
                    I'm the man!

                                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

                         MAIN TITLES                                                                                          3.


      The guys have calmed down.  They still play, but it's casual.

                                    WILL
                    Alright, boys.  That was one victory. 
                    Let's not get cocky.  

                                      KENNY
                    How'd you get Theresa to let you
                    play tonight?

                                    WILL
                    I gave her no choice.


      Will's wife Theresa folds clothes.  Will comes up and rubs
      her shoulders.  

                                    WILL
                    You wanna have sex tonight?


                                    WILL
                    Getting game time is easy.  It's
                    Nathan's birthday gift that's hard. 

                                      KENNY
                    You're still on that, huh?

                                    WILL
                    It's important. He's turning thirteen. 
                    My son's becoming a man.  I need to
                    find a gift that says 'I'm no longer
                    a child'. 

                                      KENNY
                    Then get him a hooker.  Or a shotgun. 

                                    WILL
                    Actually, those both sound like really
                    awesome birthday gifts. 

                                      CRAIG
                    Get him a journal. 

                                    WILL
                    A journal?

                                      CRAIG
                    Yeah.  Thirteen can be a very
                    confusing age.  
                                      (MORE)                                                                                        4.

                                      CRAIG (CONT'D)
                      A journal's a good place to put all
                    your thoughts. You know? Hopes and
                    dreams.  Poetry. 

                                      KENNY
                    You know, another good place to put
                    all those things is in your vagina. 

                                      CRAIG
                    Forget it. 

      Craig is silent. 

                                    WILL
                    Craig, what's going on?  Something's
                    bothering you.  You've been sulking
                    all night.  I'm watching you stab
                    people, shoot people, blow up cars
                    and the joy's just not there.  What
                    gives?

                                      CRAIG
                    I don't want to talk about it.

      Kenny and Will wait a beat.  Then: 

                                      CRAIG (CONT'D)
                    I saw Lisa tonight.

      Kenny rolls his eyes.  Will nods a'la: "That's about right."


      Craig sits across from LISA DOWNY, his ex-girlfriend. 

                                    LISA
                    I'm getting married this Saturday. 
                    And I don't know, I just...felt like
                    I had to see you again.  You know? 
                    I was thinking about how in sophomore
                    year you would come to my dorm room
                    with your guitar and sing "Brown-
                    Eyed Girl".  Do you remember that?

      Craig nods, hopelessly in love. 


                                      CRAIG
                    What do you think? Do you think it
                    might have been a cry for help?                                                                                         5.

                                    WILL
                    No, Craig.  She's just nervous about
                    getting married.  That's all.

                                      KENNY
                    You haven't seen that nut in a year. 

                                      CRAIG
                    Don't call her a nut, Kenny.  I love
                    her.

                                      KENNY
                    I'm sorry. She's a nut!  Trust me. 
                    I know about nutty girls.  I married
                    one.  And the best thing that ever
                    happened to me was getting divorced. 
                    You should avoid it all together. 

                                    WILL
                    Speaking of which.  There's something
                    I have to tell you, Kenny.

                                      KENNY
                    What?

                                    WILL
                      Bridgette's gonna be at Nathan's
                    birthday party on Saturday.  

      Kenny is pissed.  He picks up his CELL PHONE and dials.  The
      HOME PHONE in Will's house rings. 

                                      KENNY
                    Tell my sister to pick up the phone!

                                    WILL
                          (Yelling)
                    Theresa!  Pick up the phone. 

                                      THERESA (O.S.)
                    Who is it?

                                    WILL
                    It's Kenny!

                                      THERESA
                    Did you tell him that Bridgette's
                    coming to the party?

                                    WILL
                    Yes.

                                      THERESA
                    Tell him I'm a sleep.                                                                                        6.

                                      KENNY
                    Tell her I can hear her.

      Craig starts sadly singing "Brown-Eyed Girl".

                                      CRAIG
                      "Sha-la-la-la --"

                                    WILL
                    She's not gonna pick up the phone.

                                      KENNY
                    Fine. I'll call her cell.

                                      CRAIG
                    I'm gonna call Lisa.

      Craig and Kenny both get up to make CALLS. 

                                    WILL
                    Guys!  Guys!! You're supposed to be
                    covering me!  Oh, come on! 

    We hear the sounds of Will BEING SLAUGHTERED.


      Will pours a CUP OF COFFEE as his wife THERESA HAYDEN KEEN
      (30's playful, supermom/wife) sorts through the MAIL in the
      kitchen.  Her LAPTOP is open on the counter. Lucy eats a
      BOWL OF CEREAL and plays with a MERMAID DOLL.  Theresa holds
    up a PACKAGE to Will.

                                      THERESA
                    Can you open this for me?

                                    WILL
                    This is a job for...

      Will takes out a SMALL POCKET KNIFE.  Lucy GIGGLES.

                                    LUCY
                    The Old Mohaska!

      Will smiles as he cuts the package open.

                                      THERESA
                    Where is Nathan?

                                    LUCY
                    He's trapped in the bathroom because
                    he saw a spider. 

      Will opens the package, it's a VIDEO GAME.                                                                                        7.

                                    WILL
                    Dead Space 2!  Awesome! Thanks, Hon. 

                                      THERESA
                          (Laughing)
                    It's not for you.  It's a birthday
                    present for Nathan. 

                                    WILL
                    Okay, see?  This is a great gift. 
                    It's violent, it's scary, it's not
                    for kids.  This would have been a
                    great gift for me to give him.

                                      THERESA
                    So, we'll put both of our names on
                    it.  I don't care.

                                    WILL
                    Theresa, you don't understand.  I'm
                    his father.  I've got to give him
                    something that will prepare him for
                    manhood.

                                      THERESA
                    You're over-thinking this.

      Will looks into the fridge.

                                    WILL
                    We need more Hazelnut creamer.  And
                    next time get the non-dairy stuff.   

                                      THERESA
                    Did your father give you something
                    special when you turned 13?  Is that
                    what this is about?

                                    WILL
                    Are you kidding me?  My father didn't
                    even know it was my birthday!  He
                    didn't get off the couch.  He didn't
                    even put on pants. 

      Theresa giggles. 

                                    WILL (CONT'D)
                    I've got to give Nathan something
                    that signifies his entry into manhood. 
                    I don't expect you to understand it. 
                    You're a woman.  I'm a man.  

                                      THERESA
                    Oh, please, Will.  
                                      (MORE)                                                                                        8.

                                      THERESA (CONT'D)
                    Your grandfather fought in World War
                    Two.  Your father fought in Vietnam. 
                    You play Call of Duty on Playstation
                    3 and drink non-dairy Hazelnut
                    creamer.  

                                    WILL
                    Are you saying I'm not a man?

                                      THERESA
                    I'm saying that the whole "real man"
                    thing died out a generation ago.

                                    WILL
                    Is this about my pomegranate body
                    wash?

      Theresa giggles.

                                      THERESA
                    It's not a bad thing!  It's a good
                    thing.  You're evolved.  You're
                      socialized. You're sensitive.  

      She kisses him and sits at her COMPUTER. 

                                      THERESA (CONT'D)
                    It's why I married you.

                                    WILL
                    Let me tell you something.  You really
                    don't know me.  Because I protect
                    you from the violent, primal beast
                    that lurks deep within.  

                                      THERESA
                    You mean the primal beast that cries
                    during Grey's Anatomy?

                                    WILL
                    That's the one!  Izzie was very brave
                    battling that cancer.  

      NATHAN KEEN (13, dorky) enters holding the CORDLESS PHONE. 

                                      NATHAN
                    Dad!  Samantha just called and said
                    she is coming to my party tomorrow. 
                    This girl is a firecracker.  What do
                    I do?

                                    WILL
                    Try to get her in the bounce house.                                                                                        9.

                                      THERESA
                          (Appalled)
                    Will!!

                                    WILL
                    It wasn't a euphemism, T.  I was
                    being literal.

                                      THERESA
                          (Embarrassed)
                    Oh.

                                    WILL
                    A bounce house is like a twelve year-
                    old's bachelor pad.  She'll be putty
                    in your hands.

                                      NATHAN
                    Got it!

      Theresa sees something on the COMPUTER that jars her. 

                                      THERESA
                    Nathan! Did you just defriend me on
                    Facebook?

                                      NATHAN
                    Well, you update your status too
                    much and it's embarrassing. 

                                      THERESA
                    No, it's not. 

                                      NATHAN
                    "Nathan's turning thirteen.  Mommy's
                    little baby boy all growed up! Waaah!"

                                      THERESA
                    That's not embarrassing.  It's sweet.

                                      NATHAN
                    Dad?

                                    WILL
                    It's very embarrassing, T.  

      Theresa crosses to her son, holds his face in her hands. 

                                      THERESA
                    Well, I'm sorry that I love you. It
                    makes me sad that you're growing up. 
                          (Kisses him)
                    Now, go refriend me or you're
                    grounded.                                                                                         10.

      Nathan sighs.

                                    LUCY
                    Nathan, daddy is gonna get you a
                    special birthday gift.

                                      NATHAN
                    Really, Dad?

                                    WILL
                    You bet.  You're becoming a man. A
                    real man!  Just like your Dad.   

      Will and Nathan do a CHOREOGRAPHED HANDSHAKE: A series of
      fist bumps that ends with them about to take a drag on an
      imaginary JOINT, but they simultaneously think better of it. 

                                      NATHAN
                    What is it, Dad?  Give me a hint.

                                    WILL
                    Nope.  It's a surprise.  Nobody knows
                    what it is.  I mean, literally, nobody
                    in this room knows what it is.

      Kenny bursts in through the BACK DOOR.

                                      KENNY
                          (To Theresa)
                    You turn your phone off now?

                                      THERESA
                    I do when you're acting like an idiot. 

                                      KENNY
                    She can't come, T.  We're divorced!  

                                      THERESA
                    She's Nathan's Godmother!

                                      KENNY
                    I'm his Godfather.  That's a higher
                    rank.

                                      THERESA
                    Look, I realize that you guys couldn't
                    work it out, but I've decided that
                    for the sake of the kids you're gonna
                    have to deal with each other like
                    adults.  She's my best friend.

                                      KENNY
                    Well, I'm your brother. I'm putting
                    my foot down.  You hear me?  
                                      (MORE)                                                                                        11.

                                      KENNY (CONT'D)
                    She is not welcome in this house. 
                    Bridgette is no longer a part of
                    this family. 

                                      FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                    Hello!

                                    LUCY
                    Aunt Bridgette!

      Lucy gets up and runs to hug BRIDGETTE HAYDEN (30's, pretty,
      lots of energy) entering the kitchen.  Kenny is frustrated.

                                      BRIDGETTE
                    Hi, everybody.  And Kenny. 

                                      KENNY
                    Bridge, we're gonna have to set some
                      boundaries.  Alright?  I'm sorry,
                    but you can't come to Nathan's party. 

                                      BRIDGETTE
                    Theresa invited me.

                                      KENNY
                    Well, I'm uninviting you.

                                      BRIDGETTE
                    It doesn't work like that.

                                      KENNY
                    Oh, it doesn't?!  Well, I'm the
                    Godfather!  How about that?

      Will rises and grabs Kenny's arm.

                                    WILL
                    Okay. Time out! Kenny, come with me.

                                      KENNY
                    This is why we're divorced.  You
                    always have to push my buttons!

                                      BRIDGETTE
                    We're divorced because you sold my
                    Kitchen Aid mixer so you could buy a
                      twelve-inch Boba Fett on Ebay!

                                      KENNY
                    It's a collector's item!

      Will drags Kenny out the door.  Bridgette and Theresa hug.                                                                                        12.

                                      BRIDGETTE
                    Is this gonna be a problem, T?  I
                    don't want to cause trouble. 

                                      THERESA
                    Oh, yeah.  Cause you never want to
                    cause trouble.


      Kenny and Will huddle together. 

                                      KENNY
                    I swear she's just doing this to get
                    a rise out of me.

                                    WILL
                    Well, it's working.  You freak out,
                    she wins.  You gotta play it cool.
                    Think of the coolest guy you can
                    think of and act like him.  Now,
                    who's the coolest guy in the world?

                                      KENNY
                    Tobey Maguire.

                                    WILL
                          (Puzzled)
                    Uh...Okay.  Sure.  Tobey Maguire. 
                    Fine.  Ask yourself, "What would
                    Tobey Maguire do?"

      A calmness falls over Kenny.  He looks serene and confident. 

                                      KENNY
                    Right.  W.W.T.M.D. Got it.  


      Will and Kenny reenter the kitchen.  Kenny is cool.

                                      KENNY
                    You know what?  It's totally cool. 
                    You can come to the party. 

      A calm beat as Bridgette and Kenny LOCK EYES for a moment.

                                      BRIDGETTE
                    Just so you know I'm bringing a date.

      Theresa sighs.  Kenny is no longer Tobey Maguire. 

                                      KENNY
                    NO! That's it!  Absolutely not!                                                                                        13.

                                      BRIDGETTE
                    I'm an adult, Kenny.

                                      KENNY
                    Nathan!  Do you want Aunt Bridgette
                    to bring a date to your party?

                                      NATHAN
                    Will he bring me a gift?

                                      BRIDGETTE
                    Of course he will. 

                                      NATHAN
                    He can come. 

      Kenny steams.  Nathan grabs his knapsack and exits. 

                                      NATHAN (CONT'D)
                    This is gonna be the best party ever. 

                                      KENNY
                    Tobey Maguire wouldn't put up with
                    this crap!

      Kenny storms out.  Bridgette follows him and they argue. 

                                    WILL
                            (Sarcastically)
                    Yeah, this is gonna be the best party
                    ever. 

    He kisses his wife and exits.

                                    END OF ACT ONE                                                                                        14.

                                        ACT TWO


      A boring office of a major Insurance company. Will sits at
      his desk in his modest office talking on a HEADSET. He opens
      and closes his "OLD MOHASKA" as he talks.  It's a habit. 

                                    WILL
                    Okay.  I have two questions for you. 
                    One: how much is the Springster B-
                    2800?  And two: do you think a
                    trampoline is an appropriate gift
                    for a adolescent boy's transition
                    into manhood --

      Behind Will, Kenny enters carrying a giant DUFFEL BAG with
      the name FLAXODRYL on the side.  He wears a NAME TAG. 

                                    WILL (CONT'D)
                          (Loudly)
                    -- Well, Mr. Conroy I think that
                    blanket policy should just about
                    cover all your properties as well as
                    liquid --
                          (Sees that it's Kenny)
                    Oh.  It's you.  Thought you were my
                    boss. What are you doing here?

                                      KENNY
                    Lunch.

                                    WILL
                    It's ten forty-five.

                                      KENNY
                    I finished my route early.

                                    WILL
                    You're done for the day?

                                      KENNY
                    A good drug rep doesn't linger.  And
                    normally it takes longer, but this
                    product, Flaxodryl, isn't a big hit. 

                                    WILL
                    What does it do?

                                      KENNY
                    Flaxodryl provides relief for
                    bacterial infections of the skin and
                    soft tissue, such as infected ulcers,
                    wounds or burns, abscesses, impetigo,
                    and boils.  You want the side effects?                                                                                        15.

                                    WILL
                    Not unless you're gonna tell me about
                    panic attacks and loose stool.

      Craig enters, hangdog.

                                      WILL/KENNY
                      Blitzcraig!

                                      CRAIG
                    Lisa didn't call me back last night. 

                                    WILL
                    I'm guessing you called her six times? 

                                      CRAIG
                    No.  Only four. 

                                    WILL
                    Four.  Of course.  Wouldn't want to
                    freak her out. 

                                      CRAIG
                    Now, I have a headache. 

      Kenny digs through his bag, tosses a DRUG SAMPLE to Craig. 

                                      KENNY
                    Here. Take this.

                                      CRAIG
                    What is it?

                                      KENNY
                    Just take it.  It'll get rid of your
                    headache. 

      Craig shrugs and pops the pill.

                                      KENNY (CONT'D)
                    You might get a boner for a few hours. 

                                      CRAIG
                    What?!

                                    WILL
                    Hey. You know what Theresa said to
                    me today?  That I'm not a real man.

                                      VOICE (O.S.)
                    You're not!

      A VERY ATTRACTIVE GIRL enters.  This is DANA STAATS (27,
      super hot, alpha female).                                                                                         16.

                                    DANA
                    You're a whole generation of pussies.

                                      KENNY
                    Hey, Dana.  I'm sorry, they don't
                    allow skanks in this building.

                                    DANA
                    Stick it, Kenny. 
                          (To Will)
                    How's your morning, Will?  Mine?  I
                    sold four policies before 10am.  Two
                    life, one home and a boat.  I can't
                    wait until the sales meeting when I
                    show Ross how badly I trounced you
                    this quarter.  

                                    WILL
                    This quarter ain't over yet, Staats. 

                                    DANA
                    Yeah, but your so preoccupied with
                    getting your son a "special" birthday
                    gift that you can't keep your eye on
                    the prize. 

                                    WILL
                    How do you know that?

                                    DANA
                    Your wife just updated her Facebook
                    status.  

                                    WILL
                    You get my wife's status updates?

                                    DANA
                    Most of the people in the office do.  

                                    WILL
                    Since when?

                                    DANA
                    Since the company picnic.  They all
                    think she's a "hoot".  I just read
                    them cause it keeps me informed on
                    what you're up to.  Know your enemy.  

      Dana's PHONE BUZZES.

                                    DANA (CONT'D)
                          (Reading her phone)
                    That's her.  Apparently, Kenny's
                    wife is bringing a date to Nathan's
                    party?                                                                                        17.

                                    WILL
                    She's in a Yoga class!  How the hell
                    can she be updating her status?


      Twenty people sit in front of a teacher, mid-class. Theresa
    is in an impossible yoga position while TYPING ON THE PHONE.


                                    DANA
                    So. Your kid's becoming a man?  Get
                    him a hooker.

                                      KENNY
                    How much do you charge?

                                    DANA
                    Don't lash out at me just because
                    your wife is banging another guy. 
                    Cheer up. You'll find another beard. 
                    Toodles, Bitches.

      She turns and Exits. 

                                      KENNY
                    The only beard around here is yours!
                          (Softly)
                    God, she's so pretty. 

      After a beat, Will jumps up excitedly.

                                    WILL
                    That's it! I got it!  The perfect
                    gift.  I gotta run. 

                                      KENNY
                    I thought we were grabbing lunch. 

                                    WILL
                    I can't.  I'll catch you guys later. 

      Will exits.  Kenny and Craig sit quietly for a beat.

                                      CRAIG
                    Pill kicked in.

                                      KENNY
                    Headache's gone?

                                      CRAIG
                    No.  The other.                                                                                        18.

                                      KENNY
                    Oh.  I'm gonna go. 

                                      CRAIG
                    I thought we were having lunch.

                                      KENNY
                    Yeah, I can't be alone with you...and
                    that.  Sorry.

      Kenny exits.  Craig looks uncomfortable.


      Craig drives, and looks very intense.  Will is shotgun, on
      his CELLPHONE.  Kenny in the back.

                                    WILL
                    A shaving kit. What are the odds?!

                                      THERESA (O.S.)
                    When are you coming back?

                                      KENNY
                    He calls her Bridge already?

                                    WILL
                    Theresa, I have to get him something! 
                    Who gives a gift like that to a kid
                    he's never met? 

                                      KENNY
                      A touchy-feely jerkoff.  That's who! 
                    I can't believe I shook his hand!                                                                                         22.

      INTERCUT WITH --


      The party is still going.  Theresa is in the kitchen. 

                                      THERESA
                    Well, Will, people have to leave at
                    five-thirty.  I'm cutting this cake
                    at five o'clock.  You'd better be
                    here.  You've got forty-two minutes. 

                                    WILL
                    Okay. I'll be there. 

      Theresa hangs up. Bridgette sips a beer and watches Grant as
    he chats up THREE MOTHERS in the kitchen.   

                                      GRANT
                    Pilates changed my life.  I sleep
                    better, I have more energy at the
                    office. 
                          (Side of his mouth)
                    And in the bedroom.

      The Ladies chuckle. 

                                      GRANT (CONT'D)
                    I'm kidding. 
                          (Side mouth)
                    Or am I?

      They chuckle again.  Bridgette approaches Theresa.

                                      BRIDGETTE
                    Where's Kenny?

                                      THERESA
                    With Will getting Nathan a gift.
                    Why?

                                      BRIDGETTE
                    Oh, well, Grant's gonna do some magic
                    tricks and...Kenny likes magic, so...

                                      THERESA
                    Oh, yeah.  That's why you're looking
                    for Kenny.  You're ridiculous.

                                      BRIDGETTE
                    What?  What am I doing?                                                                                        23.

                                      THERESA
                    Bridge, I've known you since ninth
                    grade.  And even then you and my
                    brother were playing these stupid
                    games.  Give me a break.

                                      BRIDGETTE
                    Theresa, what Kenny and I had is
                    over.  Grant is a part of my life
                    now.  This isn't about making Kenny
                    jealous.  This is about moving on. 

                                      THERESA
                    Grant's Salsa Dancing with Tucker's
                    mom. 

      Bridgette looks over at Grant SALSA DANCING with a MOTHER.

                                      BRIDGETTE
                          (Looks at her watch)
                    Dammit, where is he?

      Theresa shakes her head.


      They drive.  Will is in action.

                                    WILL
                    Okay, we'll hit Best Buy.  Kenny, I
                    want you in DVD's.  Look for classics.
                    Anything that speaks to a child's
                    transition to manhood.  Nothing with
                    Brendan Fraser.  Craig and I will
                    look at music and gadgets. 

      Craig PULLS THE CAR OVER and starts crying. 

                                    WILL (CONT'D)
                    Craig, what's the matter? 

                                      CRAIG
                    I can't take it.  I need closure. 

                                    WILL
                    You need what?

                                      CRAIG
                    Closure.  I need closure!

                                      KENNY
                    You need to closure vagina.                                                                                        24.

                                      CRAIG
                    I need to see if she's really doing
                    it. 

                                    WILL
                    What are you talking about?

      Will looks around and sees that they are in front of a CHURCH.

                                    WILL (CONT'D)
                    Craig, is this Lisa's church?

                                      CRAIG
                    I just need to see her.  If I see
                    her doing it, actually getting
                    married, then maybe it will be over
                    for me and I'll have closure. 

                                    WILL
                    Craig, I've got thirty-seven minutes
                    to find a gift.  If I'm not back
                    there, Theresa will kill me. 

                                      CRAIG
                    It'll take two minutes.  I just need
                    to see her.

      Will stares at Craig for a beat.  He softens. 

                                    WILL
                    Fine.  You go in there, you see her,
                    get your...closure and we go.

      Craig nods, wipes his eyes and gets out of the car.  After a
      beat he opens the trunk and removes a GUITAR.

                                    WILL (CONT'D)
                    Jesus!  He's got his guitar!

      Will and Kenny go to jump out of the car.  The doors are
      locked.  They struggle for a beat.

                                      KENNY
                    Why won't they open?

                                    WILL
                    He hit the child locks!  Driver's
                    door. 

      They both pile out the DRIVER'S DOOR.


      A packed house.  A beautiful ceremony.  LISA AND HER GROOM
      stand side by side.                                                                                          25.

      The preacher is giving a beautiful sermon.  The moment is
      interrupted by A GUITAR BEING STRUMMED.

                                      CRAIG
                          (Singing Loudly)
                    "Hey, where did we go?  Days when
                    the rains came."

      The entire congregation turns in their seats and GASPS when
      they see Craig, now walking confidently towards LISA.  Will
      and Kenny watch as Craig belts out the song.  The GROOMSMEN
      are a pack of SERIOUS LOOKING FRATBOYS.  THE GROOM stares
      daggers at Craig.  Lisa looks stunned.  Craig beams.    

                                      CRAIG (CONT'D)
                    "Do you remember when we used to
                    sing Sha-la-la-la..."

    He howls out the song.  It's going well.  Will and Kenny
      join in awkwardly.  Lisa watches in amazement.


      Will drives.  Craig cries, shotgun.  Kenny in the back.

                                    WILL
                    That happened!  That actually just
                      happened...for real!  You actually
                    crashed that wedding with a guitar! 
                    I'm in shock right now.  Sweet lord,
                    what the hell were you thinking?! 

                                      CRAIG
                    Bridgette said she wanted me to stop
                    it.  

                                    WILL
                    You listen to Bridgette? I'll remind
                    you this is a woman who married Kenny!

                                      KENNY
                          (Singing to himself)
                      "Sha-la-la-la --"

                                    WILL
                    Kenny.  You mind?

                                      KENNY
                    Sorry.  It's a catchy song. 

                                      CRAIG
                    I love her so much. 

                                    WILL
                    Dammit, Craig, man up!  You know
                    what?  Theresa's right.  We're not
                    men anymore.  Our fathers were men.

                                      KENNY
                    I'm a man.

                                    WILL
                    Oh, yeah?  Then why is your ex-wife
                    parading another man in front of you
                    and you're doing nothing about it?

                                      KENNY
                    You told me to be Tobey Maguire!

                                    WILL
                    I'm just saying that none of our
                    fathers would do any of this.  
                                      (MORE)                                                                                        27.

                                    WILL (CONT'D)
                    Singing in churches and searching
                    for the special birthday gifts!  You
                    know why I can't find a gift for my
                    son?  Cause I don't know what it is
                    to be a man anymore!  They were men. 
                    Real men!  Not the over-evolved,
                    half-assed generation of panty waists
                    that we've become!  We should be
                    storming beaches, drinking whiskey
                    and killing tigers. 

                                      KENNY
                    Tigers?

                                    WILL
                    I'm sick of it!  I'm done with it! 
                    It's time to man up!  MAN UP!

      A long beat of silence as Will stews. He looks at his watch.  

                                    WILL (CONT'D)
                          (Softly)
                    Theresa's gonna kill me. 


      Theresa puts candles on a CAKE.  Will enters quickly.

                                    WILL
                    I'm sorry.  I know.

                                      THERESA
                          (Smiling)
                    Well, you better have a good excuse.

                                    WILL
                    You want a good excuse?  How 'bout
                    this?  Craig crashed Lisa's wedding
                    and started singing "Brown-Eyed Girl"
                    at the top of his lungs.

                                      THERESA
                    Shut up!  He did not. 

                                    WILL
                    Oh, he did!

      Nathan and SAMANTHA (13, cute) run up with a BASEBALL HAT. 

                                      NATHAN
                    Dad, Samantha needs this tag cut off
                    her hat.  Use the Old Mohaska! 
                          (To Samantha)
                    That's my Dad's knife.                                                                                        28.

      Will instinctively takes out his KNIFE and cuts the tag.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Thanks, Mr. Keen.

      She runs off.

                                      NATHAN
                    She wants me to take a picture of
                    her in her hat.  I told her the
                    lighting was best in the bounce house. 
                    Any last minute advice?

                                    WILL
                    Yup.  Bring hand sanitizer with you
                    into the bounce house.  Those rentals
                    are like a bacteria circus.

    He nods and they do their SIGNATURE HANDSHAKE. Nathan runs
      off.  Will shakes his head.

                                    WILL (CONT'D)
                    What chance does he have of becoming
                    a real man when his father's only
                    advice for trying to kiss a girl is
                    'bring hand sanitizer'? 

                                      THERESA
                          (Laughing)
                    He sang Brown-Eyed-Girl?


      Theresa is laughing hysterically.

                                    WILL
                    T, it really wasn't funny.  Craig's 
                    laying on the couch right now, crying.

                                      THERESA
                    Oh, honey.  Bless his heart.  Did
                    you find a gift for Nathan?

                                    WILL
                    No.  This day couldn't get any worse.

      They are interrupted by someone blasting a CAR HORN.  


      Will and Kenny enter as Craig RISES OFF THE COUCH.  They
      cross to the window and pull aside the curtain.

                                      KENNY
                    This shit just got real. 

                                    WILL
                    All right, listen up.

    He rolls up his sleeves as OUR BOYS...make that MEN, huddle
    up by the front door.  The ENTIRE BIRTHDAY PARTY gathers in
      the living room, wondering what's going on.

                                      THERESA
                    Will, what's happening?

                                    WILL
                    Not now, Honey. 
                          (To the boys)
                    We got three on the grass, two in
                    the SUV.  Now, they're drunk so
                    they'll fight sloppy, but they'll
                    also fight hard.  Craig stay on the
                    porch and keep an eye on the SUV. 
                    Kenny, go through the garage, get
                    Nathan's hockey stick, and cover my
                    flank halfway down the driveway. 

                                      VOICE (O.S.)
                    What do I do, Will?

    We reveal GRANT, still shirtless, in the huddle.

                                      KENNY
                    No!  No!  He's not on this team.

                                      GRANT
                    Kenny, we must put aside our
                      differences for the greater good.

                                      KENNY
                    Will!                                                                                        31.

                                    WILL
                    Just stay on the porch with Craig. 

                                      GRANT
                    Don't worry.  I'll do something cool.

                                    WILL
                    No. Grant, don't do anything.  

      Will peeks through the WINDOW.

                                    WILL (CONT'D)
                    This is it.  Craig, you good?

      Craig nods. 

                                    WILL (CONT'D)
                    Kenny?

                                      KENNY
                    I'm Tobey Fucking Maguire. 


    In the clutter, Kenny scrambles to find Nathan's HOCKEY STICK. 

                                      KENNY
                    Where is it?  This place is a mess. 


      The party is over.  The guests have gone home.  Bridgette
      and Theresa FINISH UP THE DISHES as Will, Kenny and Craig
      sit around the kitchen table drinking BOTTLED BEER.  

                                    WILL
                    Dude, that was intense!

                                      KENNY
                    Did you see me? I was about to go
                    Jedi with that pogo stick! 

                                      CRAIG
                    Yeah, you were ready.  That was sweet.

                                    WILL
                    You know who you looked like?  Conan
                    the Barbarian.  Like a short pale
                    Conan the Barbarian.

                          (Pleased)
                    Thank you, Will.                                                                                        33.

      They all CLINK their beers.  Bridgette turns. 

                                      BRIDGETTE
                    I'll remind you guys that Grant is
                    the only person who actually got
                    into a fight tonight.

                                      KENNY
                    No!  Grant's the only person who
                    choked tonight.  He lost his cool.   

                                    WILL
                    Yeah, we stayed the course. 

                                      BRIDGETTE
                    Well, Grant's the only one who was
                    arrested when the cops showed up
                    because he was the only one at the
                    bottom of that pile of groomsmen. 
                    Now, you're all slapping each other
                    on the back and drinking a beer like
                    you had anything to do with it!

                                      THERESA
                    Will's drinking a diet root beer.

                                    WILL
                    I can't have caffeine this late.

                                      KENNY
                    I won't let you rain on this, Bridge. 
                    We were rock steady!  Who the hell
                    screams Barracuda in a fight?

      Will looks into the living room.  Nathan is sitting on the
      floor with ALL HIS GIFTS.  Will rises and approaches him. 

                                    WILL
                    Did you have a good birthday?

                                      NATHAN
                    It was the best day of my life.  The
                    party, the fight.  Man, when you
                    went out there I was so scared, but
                    you weren't.  You're so tough. And
                    guess what?  I kissed Samantha in
                    the Bounce house.  

      Will smiles.  

                                    WILL
                    That's great. 
                          (Beat)
                    Did you use the hand saniti-                                                                                        34.

                                      NATHAN
                    Yeah, I did. 

                                    WILL
                    Okay, good. Listen, about your
                    birthday gift.  I wanted to get you
                    something special --

                                      NATHAN
                    Yeah, Mom gave it to me. I love it. 

      Nathan holds up the video game, "DEAD SPACE 2".

                                      NATHAN (CONT'D)
                    I know it's violent and scary, but I
                    promise I won't get nightmares.  I
                    think I'm old enough for it now. 
                    Thanks so much, Dad. 

      Nathan hugs Will who looks up to find Theresa watching from
      the stairs with a HUGE SMILE on her face.  Will could cry. 
      Nathan starts gnawing on PLASTIC on the game.  Will takes
      out the "OLD MOHASKA" and opens it.  An idea comes to him. 

                                    WILL
                    I think you're old enough for
                    something else, too. 

    He hands Nathan his KNIFE.  Nathan's eyes go wide.  

                                      NATHAN
                    Are you serious?  The Old Mohaska?  

                                    WILL
                    Yeah.  Every man needs one. 

      Nathan is beside himself. 

                                      NATHAN
                    Thanks, Dad.  I love you.

                                    WILL
                    Happy Birthday, Nate. 

      Will kisses him and rises.  He crosses to Theresa and sits
      beside her.  Theresa types on her phone.

                                    WILL (CONT'D)
                    What are you doing?

                                      THERESA
                    Updating my status.                                                                                         35.

                                    WILL
                    Telling people that your husband did
                    pretty good today, huh?

                                      THERESA
                    No.  I'm telling people that my
                    husband thinks it's a good idea to
                    give a thirteen year-old boy a knife.

                                    WILL
                    Theresa, he'll be fine.

      Theresa shakes her head and exits.

                                    WILL (CONT'D)
                    I should'a just gotten him a hooker.


    We are back in the game.  Our guys, IN THEIR RESPECTIVE HOMES,
      play as they did in the opening, LOOKING DIRECTLY INTO CAMERA. 

                                    WILL
                    What happened when you took her home?

                                      KENNY
                    What else happens when two consenting
                    adults find themselves alone?

                                    WILL
                    Knowing you two I'd say you started
                    arguing and then you stormed out. 

                                      KENNY
                    No, William, we engaged in sexual
                    intercourse.  And for the record,
                    sex when you're divorced is so much
                    hotter than when you're married. 

                                    WILL
                    If it was so great than why aren't
                    you sleeping there?

                                      KENNY
                    Because afterwards we started arguing
                    and I stormed out. 

                                    WILL
                    That's about right. 

                                      CRAIG
                    I just thought of something.  If
                    those guys showed up right after we
                    did, then the actual wedding must
                    not have happened.                                                                                        36.

                                    WILL
                    Yeah.  And?

                                      CRAIG
                          (Excited)
                    Well, then I broke up the wedding! 

                                    WILL
                    Craig, leave it alone.

                                      CRAIG
                    I've got to call her!

      Craig JUMPS UP and exits. 

                                    WILL
                    Craig!  Craig! Oh, Geez. 

                                      KENNY
                    So, Nathan liked his gift, huh?

                                    WILL
                    He loved it.  I can't believe I didn't
                    think of it sooner.  My dad actually
                    gave me that Old Mohaska.  It wasn't
                    a birthday gift.  Some kid kept
                    tripping me on the soccer field and
                    my dad told me to stab him if he
                    ever did it again.  I just started
                    using it to open letters and stuff. 
                    Yeah, it was the perfect gift.

                                      THERESA (O.S.)
                    Will!

                                    WILL
                    What's the matter?

      Theresa enters with Nathan, his hand in A BLOODY TOWEL.

                                      THERESA
                    He cut his hand with that stupid
                    knife!  Get the car.

                                    WILL
                    Kenny, I gotta go.  There's shotgun
                    ammo at the base of the water tower.  

                                      THERESA (O.S.)
                    WILL!

                                    WILL
                    Sorry! I'm coming.   

                                                                                FADE OUT:
