  11EXT. MAINE STOCK - DAY - ESTABLISHING


  22EXT. SMITH NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - CLOSE ON THREE KIDS

          playing army... slithering on their stomachs through bushes
          and foliage.  These are ERIC, 9, JIM, 7 and most
            particularly LINDSAY, 10, a girl who never has, never
          will play with dolls.  Eric has a pair of binoculars...
          whispers excitedly...

                                        ERIC
                        Visual contact!

                                        LINDSAY
                        Let me see...

          A brief struggle for binoculars...

                                        JIM
                        No, it's my turn...

                                        LINDSAY
                        It's your turn when I say it's
                        your turn.

                                        JIM
                                (above a whisper)
                        Not fair.

                                        LINDSAY
                        Shut up, they'll hear you.

          She puts the glasses to her eyes...


          P.O.V. (BINOCULAR MATTE)

          Johnny is in work clothes, restoring a vintage Jeep in
          his driveway; Bruce's car is parked behind it.  We can't
          hear what they're saying but BRUCE is handing Johnny a
          tool...

                                        LINDSAY (O.S.)
                        He... he looks so... weird.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: THE HOUSE - TEASER - 4/11/02 - WHITE    2.


    2CONTINUED:2

          Johnny does something mechanical under the hood... 


          RESUME KIDS

          Jim grabs the binoculars... looks through them... repeating
          as little kids do --

                                        JIM
                        He looks so weird.


          RESUME P.O.V. (BINOCULAR MATTE) - JOHNNY AND BRUCE

          All whispers:

                                        ERIC (O.S.)
                        Is it true about the cane, you
                        think?

                                        LINDSAY (O.S.)
                        What about the cane?

                                        ERIC (O.S.)
                        That he uses it to kill rats in 
                        his basement?

                                        LINDSAY (O.S.)
                        Why would anyone use a cane to
                        kill rats, stupid?

                                        ERIC (O.S.)
                        Because it's fun?

          Suddenly Johnny looks directly over at them...

                                        JIM (O.S.)
                        He's looking over here!


33NEW ANGLE - FAVORING JOHNNY AND BRUCE'S POV - OF THE KIDS
          DUCKING FOR COVER

          Johnny and Bruce pretending not to look.

                                        BRUCE
                        Yeah, it's them again, all right.

                                        JOHNNY
                        When did I turn into Boo Radley,
                        huh?

          He shakes his head...



                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: THE HOUSE - TEASER - 4/22/02 - Blue     3.


    3CONTINUED:3

                                        BRUCE
                        Maybe you should talk to some of
                        their parents.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The parents are more afraid of me
                        than the kids are.  People walk
                        their dogs on the other side of
                        the street.

                                        BRUCE
                        Good news for your lawn, man. 
                        It's all how you look at it.

          Johnny tries to start the jeep... it cranks but doesn't
          turn...

                                        BRUCE
                        Why don't you just buy a new one?

                                        JOHNNY
                        This one's the perfect fit for
                        me.  Out of commission for a few
                        years, needs to be rebuilt from
                        the inside out but still a classic.

          He cranks it up again... in the background the mailman
          arrives and Bruce takes the mail... the car still won't
          start...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (to the car)
                        We'll get there, Nellie Belle.

                                        BRUCE
                        Good luck.  Got to get to the
                          hospital.

          Bruce hands Johnny his mail as he gets into his car, starts
          the engine on the first try...

                                        BRUCE
                                (re: the engine)
                        Modern technology.

          And drives off while Johnny walks to the mailbox and gets
          his mail as he waves good-bye.


  44BACK WITH THE KIDS

          Lindsay has the glasses again...




                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: THE HOUSE - TEASER - 4/11/02 - WHITE    4.


    4CONTINUED:4

                                        JIM
                        You think he saw us?

                                        LINDSAY
                        Oh, he knows we're here.

                                        ERIC
                        How do you know?

          She lowers the glasses, Eric takes them.

                                        LINDSAY
                        Because he's psychic, stupid.

                                        JIM
                        What's 'psychic' anyway?

          Eric looks through the glasses --

                                        ERIC
                        Hey!


          P.O.V. (BINOCULAR MATTE) - NO SIGN OF JOHNNY

                                        ERIC (O.S.)
                        Where'd he go?


          RESUME

                                        LINDSAY
                        Give me those.

          She looks...


          P.O.V. (BINOCULAR MATTE) - LOOKING FOR JOHNNY

          no luck...

                                        LINDSAY (O.S.)
                        You lost him, Eric.  He could be
                          anywhere.


          ANGLE - WITH LEGS AND A CANE IN FRAME BEHIND THEM

                                        JOHNNY
                        He could even be right behind
                        you.

                                        KIDS
                        AAAAAAAAH!


                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: THE HOUSE - TEASER - 4/11/02 - WHITE    5.


  4CONTINUED: (2)4

          They scramble out of the bushes and run for their lives. 
          Moving to Johnny's face watching them go... smiles, but
          it's a defensive smile that speaks to his isolation...


  55INT. SMITH HOUSE - DAY

          As Johnny enters, moves into the living room and begins
          to thumb through the mail, typical collection junk mail,
          some catalogues, bills, and a manilla envelope from a
            lawyer...  Johnny reacts to that one and opens it...


          CLOSE - ON THE DOCUMENTS

          A cover letter from a law office briefly states that these
            documents have been in their possession for several years
          and are forwarding them for Johnny's files.  We don't
          have to read that... but as Johnny flips through them, we
          can see the papers are related to his mother's estate,
            including her signed will.


          JOHNNY - CLOSE

          as Johnny touches the will, suddenly the silence is
          interrupted by the CREAK of a wood floor... Behind him,
          we see - but he doesn't - the legs of a child in short
          pants crossing the foyer shrouded in shadows.  Johnny
          reacts, turns too late to see anything...


          MOVING WITH HIM

          as he moves into the hallway... listens... nothing...

                                        JOHNNY
                          Hello...?

          He hears a footstep and turns too late to see anything,
          but out of the corner of his eye --


          ANGLE - THE STAIRWAY

          One of the shadows barely moves before it disappears into
          the darkness going up the stairs... Johnny reacts...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Okay, gang.  Fun's over.  Not in
                        my house, okay?

          Begins to climb the stairs...



                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: THE HOUSE - TEASER - 4/11/02 - WHITE    6.


    5CONTINUED:5

          TOP OF THE STAIRS

          he pauses...


          P.O.V. - DOWN A LONG UPSTAIRS HALLWAY 

          Barely a glimpse of a shadow disappearing into the master
          bedroom...


          JOHNNY

          moves down the long hallway...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm not fooling around now.

          ...reaches the master bedroom.


  66INT. MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Vera Smith's old bedroom - not a room that Johnny goes in
          often - curtains are drawn; it's dark, gloomy... he moves
          inside, looks around...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I know you're in here...

          He walks through the dark room... moves to the bathroom
          door which is closed... he opens it slowly... the door
          creaks as he does... he switches on the light and enters...


  77INT. BATHROOM - DAY

          Tiled with antique porcelain fixtures - all sparkling
          white.  Johnny looks around curiously at the empty room
          and is about to leave when he hears a gurgle from...


          THE DRAIN IN THE TUB

          The gurgle continues as...


          JOHNNY

          leans down to look at





                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: THE HOUSE - TEASER - 4/11/02 - WHITE    7.


    7CONTINUED:7

          THE DRAIN

          as a trickle of blood backs up into the tub...


          JOHNNY

          reacts as...


          THE TRICKLE BECOMES A FLOOD

          Blood filling the tub... and faster, punctuated intercuts
          with --


          JOHNNY - CLOSE-UPS -  FREEZE FRAMES

          reacting with horror as...


          THE TUB OVERFLOWS

          and blood spills all over the white tiled floor and...


          JOHNNY

          recoils back into the bedroom trying to escape....


          THE RIVER OF BLOOD

          coming toward him from the bathroom door... but as it
          reaches...


          JOHNNY

          it disappears as the vision ends and...


          NEW ANGLE - JOHNNY

            reacts... looks back into the bathroom which is as clean
          and white as it was before.  On his reaction...

                                                                              FADE OUT:

  88EXT. FAITH HERITAGE UNIVERSITY - DAY - ESTABLISHING


  99INT. UNIVERSITY ATRIUM - DAY

          Purdy strolling with Dana eating a Good Humor bar on a

                                        DANA
                        He's keeping a low profile, stays

                        Is he seeing anyone?

                        One date.  If you ask me, I think
                        he still has an eye for the
                          sheriff's wife.

                        Oh, we don't want that.  We need
                        to find Johnny a good god-fearing
                        woman.

          A pair of comely co-eds pass by and smile at Purdy... he
          gives them a warm nod...

                        Why, we might even find one right
                        here on the university campus.

                        I just want him to be happy. 
                        Loving another man's wife will
                        lead to nothing but trouble.

                        God has spoken to me about Johnny,

                        He told me the world needs a little
                        Johnny Smith right now.  If Johnny
                          inspires faith and a belief in a
                        greater power, God would welcome
                        it.

                        There will always be skeptics. 
                        Can Johnny do what people think
                        he can do?  Who knows?  The
                          important thing now is to put the
                        story of Johnny Smith in the proper
                          context.  In difficult times,
                        people need something or someone
                        to believe in.  Why not Johnny
                        Smith?

  1010EXT. PARK - DAY

          Little Johnny playing soccer in a junior league.  Moving
          to find Sarah and Johnny watching... Johnny's mind still
          preoccupied with the vision...

          Off someone's look across the field (they see her, we
            don't)... 

                                        SARAH
                        Mrs. Stanton is giving us the eye
                        again.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Which one is she?

                                        SARAH
                          Pruneface with the fat kid.  I
                        don't think she approves of me
                        being here with you.

                        I feel the scarlet letter on my
                        bosom.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe I should go.

                                        SARAH
                        And give her the satisfaction?  
                        Never.  Come on, Mighty Clams!
                                (beat)
                        I'm sorry.  'Clams' is not a good
                        sports name.

          A beat.  Johnny's mind is obviously not on the game.

                        her sleep.  Mrs. Runyon found her
                        in the morning and called the

          As we push into Johnny's face...


  1111EXT. SMITH HOUSE - NIGHT

          Ominous in this context now.  Finding Johnny who has
          returned home, standing in front, considering it.  


          POV - BINOCULAR MATTE - JOHNNY

          mind still thinking about the vision as he moves toward
          the house...


          THE KIDS

          in a new hiding spot... watch him go inside...

                        He's going inside.  Let's go.

          They crawl out from their cover... move toward the Smith
          house...


  1212INT. SMITH HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

          The dark quiet emptiness makes it unsettling.  As Johnny
          enters, he pauses as he hears the sound of A WOMAN
            CRYING... inconsolable weeping... it's coming from upstairs
          again... 


  1313INT. UPSTAIRS SMITH HOUSE

          as Johnny reaches the top of the stairs and the sound of
          the sobbing is closer... and once again, it's coming from
          the master bedroom...

          JOHNNY

          moves to the door which is closed.  Johnny slowly opens
          it.


  1414HIS POV - THE ROOM

          is empty and the crying has stopped but the window is
          open and the draft makes the curtains blow lightly,
            eerily... a rocking chair by the window slowly eases back
          and forth in the breeze... there's a photograph of Vera
          and five-year-old Johnny on the nightstand...


          JOHNNY

          enters the room cautiously, turns on the light... shuts
          the window... wondering who left it open... we move with
          him to...


          ANGLE TO THE BATHROOM

          which has a bathtub filling with blood...


            A REVERSE ANGLE PAST JOHNNY AS HE REACTS TO THE TUB

          to include the open door to the hall... we catch a shocking
          glimpse of a shadowy figure of an old woman as she moves
          past the door in the hall behind him... (Later, we will
            recognize her as MRS. RUNYON, 56, the housekeeper who
          died of cancer a few years ago.)  Johnny never sees her.

          We hear A WINDOW BREAKING downstairs... Johnny reacts...

          The bathroom is normal again.

          He hears the sound of RUNNING FEET outside... he frowns,
          moves quickly out of the room...


          DOWN THE STAIRS - JOHNNY

          moves quickly to investigate the broken glass... sees a
          small window broken with a rock inside on the floor with
          the glass... looks out the broken window to see the kids
          scrambling for cover... bolts out --          THE DEAD ZONE: THE HOUSE - ACT ONE - 4/11/02 - WHITE  14.


  1515EXT. SMITH HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

          Johnny coming out moving as fast as he can with his cane...
          moving straight to the kids' hiding place...

          They push their way out of the bushes... but Lindsay trips
          on a root and falls and it's long enough for Johnny to
          grab her... as he does --


1616A JOHNNY FLASH - A FRONT DOOR OPENS - DAY

          to reveal a pair of stern-faced NAVAL OFFICERS... Lindsay
          is holding the door open looking up at them curiously...
          the flash ends as we...

          who reacts, puzzled at the vision, but has his hands full
          as the little girl struggles like mad to get out of his

                        I'm not from around here.

          Johnny chuckles.

                        What's so funny?

          They're both out of breath and tired of the struggle... 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Just that I remember saying the
                        same thing to old Mr. Fordyce
                        down the street after I painted
                        his cat.  I was a little younger
                        than you.

                                        LINDSAY
                                  (surprised)
                        You lived in this neighborhood? 

                                        JOHNNY
                          I wasn't always a zombie.  I was
                          actually a kid once.  If I let go
                        of you, you gonna run?

                                        LINDSAY
                        No.

                        Because it's hard to hold you and
                        this cane and walk at the same
                        time...

                                        LINDSAY
                        I told you, no.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Our legs would get all entangled...
                        see?

          Johnny illustrates how walking with the cane and holding
          her would be almost comical... he lets go...  

                                        JOHNNY
                        Besides I know your name is
                          Lindsay.  I heard your friends. 
                        Lindsay what?

                                        LINDSAY
                        I know a trick question when I
                        hear one.

                                        JOHNNY

                        for old time's sake...

                        Sorry, doesn't work that way. 
                        You get old and mean and busting
                        kids is one of the few pleasures
                        left in life, you know?

          Lindsay studies him, shakes her head, gives up.

                                        LINDSAY
                        It's the grey house over there.

          And they begin to walk toward a house across the street,
          just a little up the block ...

                        I don't kill rats with my cane.

                        I mean that you see things.  Like
                        the future and stuff.

  1919NEW ANGLE - AT THE HOUSE

          as Johnny rings the doorbell... Lindsay's father (MR.
          DAVIS) answers the door... reacts as he sees Johnny
          standing there with his daughter...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm sorry to bother you, but my
                        name is Smith, I live across the

                        Are you all right?

          MRS. DAVIS moves into view behind her husband... these
          are two people who look at Johnny with fear and loathing,
          like a mentally disturbed person who has moved onto their
          block.  Lindsay's father leans down and grabs her by the
          arm and pulls her inside...

  2020EXT. SMITH HOUSE - NIGHT

          As Johnny returns... moves toward the house as he studies
          it with a deep concern... and the house seems to take on
            a personality of its own in these shots...


          ANGLE - AS HE LOOKS UP TO THE SECOND FLOOR WINDOW

          at Vera's room... the light still on before...and there
          seems to be a figure of a woman sitting there, looking
          out... or is it his imagination...?


          JOHNNY'S EYES NARROW

          He moves quickly into the house...


  2121INT. SMITH HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

          Johnny enters... but his movement toward the stairs is
          halted when he catches two dark figures moving through
          the shadows of the living room... he reacts... moves
          quickly into the living room and sees....


          THE FIGURES

          moving away toward the other door... pausing to glance
          back in his direction... and their faces are illuminated
          for an instant by moonlight from a window... and it's the
            damnedest thing you've ever seen because it sure as hell
          looks like Elvis Presley and Marilyn Monroe... and then
          they move out of view and disappear into the shadows...


          JOHNNY

          reacts with appropriate confusion... but his attention is
          promptly drawn to an eerie sound coming from upstairs...
          a young boy singing...

                                        BOY'S VOICE
                        "This little light of mine... I'm

                        light of mine... I'm gonna let it
                          shine..."

          He moves back to the staircase, looks up toward the voice.

  2222INT. VERA'S ROOM - NIGHT

          VERA, age 31, is sitting, brushing the hair of FIVE YEAR
          OLD JOHNNY who is wearing short pants, singing "Let It
          Shine" (they are the same pair in the photograph on the
            nightstand)...

                                        FIVE YEAR OLD
                        "On Monday, he gave me the gift
                        of love; On Tuesday, peace came
                        from above..."

          Move to find adult Johnny entering at the door watching...
          Vera joins the child for the next few lines (using as
          much of the song as necessary to support the action)...

                                        VERA & FIVE YEAR OLD
                        On Wednesday told me to have a
                        little more faith; On Thursday,
                        gave me a little more grace.

          Johnny moves inside slowly and kneels down and looks at
          the boy who doesn't see or acknowledge his presence...

                                        VERA & FIVE YEAR OLD
                        On Friday, told me to watch and
                        pray; On Saturday told me just
                        what to say.  On Sunday, gave
                        power divine; Just to let my little
                        light shine...

          As Johnny reaches out to touch the boy that he once was,
          the mother and child vanish, the last line of the song
          drifting off into echoes... as we stay on Johnny as he
          reacts to the creaking of...


          THE ROCKING CHAIR

          ...that moves back and forth, back and forth, as it faces
          the window... and the gurgle from the drain in the
          bathroom... brings Johnny's attention back to...

                        mean to doubt that you saw
                          something... but that doesn't

                          carefully if you'd like...

                                        JOHNNY
                          I appreciate it.  I owe you one.

                                        DANA
                        Never say 'I owe you one' to a
                          reporter because you know what?
                        Now you owe me one.

          And she's serious.  She smiles... her cell phone rings.  

                                        DANA
                        This is Dana.
                                (listens)
                        Got it.  I'll get right over there.
                                (hangs up, to Johnny)
                        I have to go over to Cleaves Mills. 
                        Can I give you a lift?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sure.  What's going on?

                                        DANA
                        Sad news.  A local navy flier has
                        been reported missing in action.

          As Johnny reacts...

  3131EXT. SMITH HOUSE - DAY

          Johnny gets out of Dana's car... and watches her go down
          the block to Lindsay's house.

          JOHNNY

          reacts, grim, moves toward his house... reacts as he sees --

          sitting on his porch, waiting for him... her eyes are dry
          now but she's been crying recently... he moves to her...

                                        LINDSAY
                        Tell me if my brother's alive.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Lindsay, I'm sure as soon as they
                        have any news, they'll...

                                        LINDSAY
                        He may be hurt somewhere... you
                        might be able to help rescue him...

          A beat.  Johnny really has no alternative...

                                        JOHNNY
                        It doesn't always work.

                                        LINDSAY
                        Please.

          Johnny looks at her... and reaches out to take her arm...
          on his touch, ramp to his face as a vision begins...


  3232VISION - JOHNNY IN A NAVY AIRCRAFT COCKPIT

          There are two crewmen and Johnny is sitting behind the co-
          pilot.  The desert horizon of Afghanistan is visible in
          the windows, twisting and turning... there are explosions
          on all sides... the ride is lurching...  The pilot,
            Lindsay's brother, with the name, "Davis" on the uniform...
          is desperately doing everything he knows how to do to

          the vision ends on a --

          He feels the horror... but does the best to control what

          WIDER

          Lindsay looks at him curiously...

                        What did you see?

          Johnny takes a beat to collect himself.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Nothing.  I'm sorry.

                                        LINDSAY
                          Nothing.

                        I told you.  It... doesn't always
                        work.

          She looks at him, disappointed and angry.

                        any powers.  

          She charges away... but turns back and yells at him for
          the world to hear...

          And moves down the block toward her house...  Johnny looks
          at her as she moves across the street toward her house...
          Johnny looks to --

          He can see the distinct figure of a woman sitting at the

          looking out from Vera's window earlier.  As...

          Johnny and Bruce working on the old car...

                        What was I supposed to do?  I
                          couldn't refuse, I couldn't tell

                        You're sure he's dead...  

          Johnny nods, feeling helpless, angry.  He puts more force
          into a wrench he's turning...

                        right - I should go on the psychic
                        channel and make money...  Hi,

                        I'm tired of The Johnny Trick. 
                        I'm tired of seeing more than I
                        ever wanted to see.  I've got to

                        There used to be a guy a few
                        streets over when I was a kid...
                        used to sit on the curb and yell
                        at people going by... I was scared
                        to death of him... like people
                        are scared of me now... for the
                        longest time, I swear I thought
                        he was Charles Manson... he had
                        long hair and those crazy eyes,
                        you know... and he'd just sit
                        there and yell... about government
                          conspiracies and Vietnam and

                        I can understand why people don't
                        want me in the neighborhood.

                        Hey, there are neighborhoods where
                        they don't want me, you know?

          Johnny reacts, looks at Bruce who is very, very serious.

                        It's easy to start thinking that
                        they're right.  The way they look
                        at you.  But you're not crazy,
                        John.  You're different.  You are
                        who you are.  And you don't
                          apologize for being who you are.

                        And by the way, I'm really into
                        this psychic network idea...

          Johnny smiles... then reacts as he hears music from inside
          the house... a cha cha... Bruce doesn't hear the music
          but notices the look on Johnny's face...

                        seeing this...

                        Why do white people always stay
                        in the house?

          He moves to Marilyn and Elvis who are doing the cha-cha
          on the dance floor... they don't acknowledge Johnny...
          but Johnny gets a close look at Marilyn Monroe...

                        It isn't Marilyn Monroe.  It's my
                        mother.
                                (looking at Elvis)
                        And father.  They're so young.

          The song ends... and everyone laughs, party walla... and
          some clap... Johnny's dad, HERBERT (29) holds on to his
          wife...

                                        HERBERT
                        Wait... before we put on another
                          record... we have an
                          announcement...

          Bruce moves beside the bar, standing, without realizing
          it beside a man who is dressed as Zorro... with a black
          cape and a handkerchief mask and the typical hat... we'll
          come to realize this is a YOUNG GENE PURDY...

                                        HERBERT
                        We're going to have a baby.

          Everyone cheers.  Rush to congratulate them, slap him on
          the back, hugs and so forth... young Vera's cheeks turn
          rosy, blushing...

  4040INT. PARLOR - 1960S

          Purdy, next to Bruce, is clearly heartsick at the news...
          hides his reaction as everyone else moves to the couple. 
          Johnny notices (and recognizes him because he's known
          Purdy all his life)...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Zorro doesn't seem very happy for
                        them.  It's Purdy.  Right beside
                        you.

                        How ya doin', Reverend?

          Someone pops some champagne and in mid-spritz, time seems
          to stand still... the action freezes, Johnny moves slowly
          through the still-life people to Purdy who is clearly
          bitter in this moment...

                                        JOHNNY
                        This was before he was a Reverend. 
                        But not before he loved my mother. 
                        When I was growing up, I used to
                        hate it when he came around...
                        there was always mom and dad...
                        and this other guy...

                        Oh, you mean, like Walt 'n Sarah
                        'n you.

          That cuts through Johnny like a knife because it's true...

          looking at Johnny's continued reaction...

                                        BRUCE
                        He loved her his whole life.  But
                        you still think he killed her.

          It challenges Johnny's assumptions... suddenly, he's not
          so sure... his eyes fill with uncertainty... looks back
          at --


  4242INT. PARLOR - 1960S - PURDY

          The action jump starts.  Purdy tries to compensate for
          his bitterness... he's already a little drunk... fills
          his glass with more champagne... puts on a brave face...

                        She never married him.  Even after
                        dad died.  And I know he asked
                        her more than once.

                        too often.

          But he's not sure.  Could this man who loved his mother
          actually be driven to kill her some day?  It's all part
          of the mystery for Johnny.

          Voices cheer, 'hear, hear'... classes clink... and Purdy's

                        She expressed them to me.  I don't

                        after she died?

                        I'd known Mrs. Runyon for years. 
                        We needed help.  She needed a
                        job.  Are you accusing me of
                        something?

                          Johnny...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Thanks for stopping by, Reverend.

                                        PURDY
                        'Gene', please.  Aren't we past
                          formalities after all this time?

          Johnny grins pleasantly...

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's hard to break a habit.  After
                        all, I was brought up to call you
                          'Reverend'.

          And we begin a remarkable ballet that will take us through
          this sequence - as the people Johnny and we have seen in


                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: THE HOUSE - ACT FOUR - 4/11/02 - WHITE  41.

          the house during his visions, move about the present day
          action.  For musical theater fans, it may remind of the
            showgirls of the past that haunt the stage of Stephen
          Sondheim's Follies.  Johnny and we see them; obviously
          Purdy does not.

          Our camera is moving, fluid throughout and we pick up
          glimpses of them as the camera moves by them... or they
          move in and out of shadows...  Here, the five year old
          Johnny in short pants plays on the floor with a toy of
          the era... 

                                        PURDY
                        Well, it seemed more appropriate
                        when you were five.  And the
                          alternative would have been, augh,
                        'Uncle Gene'...

          Johnny laughs casually, nods as they walk into the living
          room...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Can I get you something?

                                        PURDY
                        No, I'm fine...

                                        JOHNNY
                        A soft drink?  A glass of
                        champagne?  

          Vera as Mariyn Monroe laughs and drinks champagne in the
            background...

                                        PURDY
                        I'm fine, thank you. 

          They sit.  Purdy on a couch.  Johnny takes a chair across
          the room a few feet, sits on the footrest.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I asked you to come over because
                        I still have questions about mom...

                                        PURDY
                        If there's anything I can do to
                        put your mind at ease...

                                        JOHNNY
                          I appreciate that, Gene.  Maybe
                        there is.
                                (beat)
                        It's interesting.

                        Living in a house where you and
                        your family have lived for what? -
                        fifty years?

                                        PURDY
                                (nods)
                        Your mom and dad bought this house
                        in the sixties.  

                                        JOHNNY
                        You walk in your own footsteps...
                        and theirs... and most of the
                        time never stop to think about
                        it.  But they were right here in
                        this room...

          Another Vera, the one who brushed little Johnny's hair,
          moves by...

                          halls... sleeping in these beds...
                        dancing at parties...

                                        PURDY
                        There were some wonderful times
                        in this house.  Your dad was such
                        a good friend...

                          sometimes...

                                        PURDY
                        You were still a little boy when
                        he passed.

                                        JOHNNY
                        In a way, I almost feel a part of
                        him is still here, with me.  Not
                        in a literal sense, of course. 
                        But a trace of him.  A molecule. 
                        I can see him sometimes.  I can
                        see Mom too...

                        about your... abilities.  At an
                          appropriate time, I'd... I'd love
                        to explore the spiritual meaning

          Johnny is on his feet, Purdy rises uncertainly, follows
          him...


  5151MOVING WITH THEM UP THE STAIRS

          From upstairs, the sound of a woman crying... the five
          year old, runs by them up the stairs...

                                        FIVE YEAR OLD
                        "This little light of mine... I'm

                        This'll just take a sec.


  5252INT. HALLWAY

          The old housekeeper rushes past them in the hallway... as
          Johnny leads the way to...


  5353INT. MASTER BEDROOM

          As they enter.  Johnny turns on the lights.

                        This is where I've been seeing
                        those visions I talked to you

                        Johnny, you never had a chance to
                        mourn her passing.  This may be
                        your mind's way of...

                        But one of the images in this
                        room that I find the most confusing
                        is the one of... you... Gene...

                        With blood on your hands.

          Purdy's eyes narrow.  This is his first direct exposure
          to Johnny's powers... there's a long beat...

                                        PURDY

5454A VISION BEGINS - SAME ROOM FIVE YEARS AGO - PURDY

          Blood on his hands as we saw in the earlier flash... then
          after a long beat of this...

                        Does anyone else know about this?

          And finding Johnny standing there, forcing himself to
          watch... Purdy is kneeling by the bloody bathtub, the
          figure of Vera's nude body is suggested but blocked by
          Purdy and the housekeeper... Purdy bows his head and says
          a quiet prayer for Vera... Johnny sees a bloody razor
          blade on the side of the tub.


          ANGLE - PURDY

          rises, moves back into the room, there are tears in his
          eyes... moves to the phone... dials...

                        This is Gene Purdy.  I need a
                        hearse out at Vera Smith's house. 
                        She died in her sleep last night. 
                        The housekeeper found her this
                          morning.  ...Yes, she's to be
                        taken to our mortuary and cremated
                          immediately.  No, I'll contact
                        the Sheriff's office, thank-you.

          Purdy collects himself and turns to Mrs. Runyon.

                        No one is ever to know what

                        I tried to console her.  I
                          couldn't.  She spent almost every
                        day in this room, crying, sitting
                        in her rocking chair... staring
                        out the window...

          Johnny turns and sees an older, tortured Vera Smith sitting
          in the rocking chair looking out the window...

                                        PURDY
                                (beat)
                        They told her you'd never recover.   
                        She'd lost her only son.  And her
                        faith in God.

          Johnny moves closer to examine the mournful eyes of his
            mother...

                        I made the choice to protect her
                        name and her legacy. 

          Johnny looks to him...

                                        PURDY
                        And yours, Johnny.


  5656EXT. SMITH HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

          On the front step.  Purdy is leaving.  Johnny is
          preoccupied with the revelations of the preceding scene.

                                        PURDY
                        Dana Bright has been asking
                        questions.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I know.  I'll call her.

                                        PURDY
                        What will you tell her?

                                        JOHNNY
                                (beat)
                        That I was wrong.  That it's
                          private.  That there's no story
                        here.

          Purdy nods and leaves Johnny alone with his thoughts.

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:


  5757EXT. SMITH HOUSE - NIGHT - DRIVEWAY

          Johnny, stares at the engine of the old jeep... a wrench
          in his hand... his mind far away from cars...

                                        LINDSAY
                        Kind of late to be working on
                        your car, isn't it?

          Johnny looks up to see her standing there.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I just needed to get out of the
                        house, you know?

                                        LINDSAY
                        Me too.

                                (beat, grim)
                        They found my brother's plane. 
                        It crashed in some mountains. 
                        They said he died right away. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm sorry.

                                        LINDSAY
                        They're sending us a medal.   

          She studies him.

                                        LINDSAY
                        You knew, didn't you.  You just
                        didn't want to tell me.

                                        JOHNNY
                          I didn't know how to tell you.

                                        LINDSAY
                        I'm sorry for calling you a...

                        Forget it.  It doesn't matter.

          She lets out a deep breath... a tear runs down her cheek...
          She doesn't know what else to say...

                                        LINDSAY
                                (nods, a beat)
                        Well, I better get back.  My mom
                        is... she's really upset...

          She swallows hard and the tears come and Johnny moves to
          comfort her... puts his arms around her and as he touches
          her...

  6363EXT. STREET - NIGHT

          Johnny has moved to the street, mind working, Lindsay not
            understanding what's happening... he looks at the Davis
          house... the woman is at the window at the second floor...

                                        LINDSAY
                        What is it?


          JOHNNY

          feels a chill run up his back...


  6464INT. DAVIS HOUSE FOYER - NIGHT

          Moments later... in the foreground, Dana is interviewing
          Mr. Davis in the living room... family pictures are
            scattered about.  They react as the front door opens and
          Johnny and Lindsay enter...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm sorry to bother you at a time
                        like this... but I have to talk
                        to Mrs. Davis...

          And Mr. Davis doesn't want the weirdo next door anywhere
          near his wife...

                                        MR. DAVIS
                        She's not seeing anyone...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sir, it's very important.

                                        MR. DAVIS
                        Look, I don't want to be rude...
                        I'm sure you're a very nice man
                        but I don't want you here, okay...

          Dana sees the urgency in Johnny's face... isn't sure what's
            happening but wants to be supportive...

                                        DANA
                        Mr. Davis, I know how it must
                        seem but I've seen Johnny do some
                        remarkable things...



                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: THE HOUSE - ACT FOUR - 4/11/02 - WHITE  50.

                                        MR. DAVIS
                                (losing patience)
                          Remarkable.  Our son is gone. 
                        Can you bring him back to life?

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's your wife I'm concerned about. 
                        Her life, sir.

          Davis reacts. 

                                        LINDSAY
                        Dad.  Let him.

          Davis looks at his daughter...

                                        LINDSAY
                        Please.

          And against his better judgment, he leads the way
          upstairs...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (to Lindsay)
                        Stay here.

          Johnny looks to Dana who acknowledges she'll watch the
          girl, puts a comforting hand on her shoulder...


  6565INT. DAVIS MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

          As Mr. Davis enters with Johnny... Mrs. Davis is sitting
          by the window... depressed and detached... her eyes are
          cried out... she's sullen, angry at life itself... she
          turns and sees Johnny entering... 

                                        MRS. DAVIS
                                (dull, to Johnny)
                        Please.  Go away.  

                                        JOHNNY
                        Mrs. Davis, I've seen you at the
                          window...

                                        MRS. DAVIS
                        Leave us alone!

                                        MR. DAVIS
                        This isn't a good...
                                (idea)

          But Johnny has seated himself opposite the woman...

                        Maybe Lindsay has told you... I

                          something about you, tonight...

          Her eyes connect with his... he puts his hand on hers...

  6767RESUME

          Mrs. Davis looks at him.  She knows he knows.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Mrs. Davis, the pain you feel...
                        I can't say it will go away soon...
                        but I'm sure if your son could
                        speak to you now, he would want
                        you to know...

          Moving as we did in Johnny's house - to find the image of
            Lindsay's brother in his uniform and he speaks in unison
          with Johnny this one line:

                                        JOHNNY & BROTHER
                        ...that you are loved and needed
                        in this house.

          That's all and then Johnny finishes...

                                        JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                        This house could never recover if
                        you were to do harm to yourself.

          She begins to cry.  Her husband rushes over and embraces
          her.  The image of the brother is gone.

                                        MR. DAVIS
                                (to Johnny)
                        You're upsetting her...

                        Mrs. Davis...

                        weren't you...

          And she just looks at him as tears flow and finally she
          nods... she looks to her husband, desperate for help. 
          Shocked, he holds her as she cries in his arms...

                        this.
                                (to Johnny, awkwardly)
                        I need to take her to the hospital.
                          I wonder if... I know that I have
                        no right to ask after the way
                        I... but...

                        I'll look after Lindsay while
                        you're gone.

          Davis nods in appreciation.


  6868EXT. DAVIS HOUSE - NIGHT

          As Dana, Lindsay and Johnny watch the Davises pull out of
          the driveway...

                                        LINDSAY
                        Is she going to be all right?

          Johnny puts a hand on her shoulder... whatever he sees we
          don't get to share... but his face tells us he's pleased.

                                        JOHNNY
                        After awhile.  Yeah.  You're all
                        going to be all right.  

          He grins at Lindsay who takes comfort from his words.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (to Dana)
                        Well, I guess you got a story
                        after all.

                                        DANA
                        Story.  What story.  I didn't see
                          a thing.  

          Johnny reacts with new appreciation for her... and as
          they walk inside the Davis house, we pull back and up and --

                                        DANA
                        Mind if I keep you guys company?
