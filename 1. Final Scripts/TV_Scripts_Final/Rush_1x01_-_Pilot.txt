RUSH

PILOT

By Jonathan Levine
June 2013      FROM BLACK TO

      We re not sure, really. An amorphous blur. Abstract. 
        Unidentifiable. Music echoes soft, as though we re rising up 
      from underwater. Something rousing, indie, anthemic. Bubbling 
      to the surface. It crescendos, as

      A YOUNG HOTTIE shoots into our frame: sunken cheekbones 
      covered in sweat; coke residue on her perfect nose. She wipes 
      it, looks into lens:

                                  YOUNG HOTTIE
                    I m no one.

      ANGLE ON THE MAN who sits across from her. He s in his early-
      30 s. Handsome, in a perfectly-fitting button-down shirt 
      that s been unbuttoned one button too far.

                                  THE MAN
                    Excuse me?

                                  YOUNG HOTTIE
                    I saw you looking at me like  where 
                    do I know this girl from? , but I m 
                    not really famous. Not yet anyway. 
                    I was on this show, once, called 
                    Thank You For Nothing, maybe that s 
                    how you know me? 
                          (he tries to speak, but--)
                    And I just did this video. Kanye 
                    featuring T Pain? 

                                  THE MAN
                    That must be it.

                                  YOUNG HOTTIE
                    It got, like, thirty million hits 
                    on YouTube...

                                  THE MAN
                      Congratulations.

      PULL BACK to reveal a meticulous, classically decorated HOTEL 
      ROOM. More Chateau Marmont than Ian Schrager. The Man and the 
      Young Hottie sit over a 1930 s mahogany coffee table, upon 
      which lie two amber vials of coke. 

                                  YOUNG HOTTIE
                    Yeah, Yeezy was supercool to work 
                    with.

      The Young Hottie cuts up another line, puts the dollar bill 
      to her nose, SNORTS.                                                                                      2.


                                  THE MAN
                    Shouldn t use dollar bills. Puts 
                    you at a high risk for Hep C.

      This barely registers with The Hottie. The Man tears off a 
      piece of hotel stationary, expertly wraps it into a tube, and 
      SNORTS his own line. He rises up with a satisfied smile:

                                  YOUNG HOTTIE
                    So, who are you? I mean, like, what 
                    do you do, or whatever?

                                  THE MAN
                    Guess.

                                  YOUNG HOTTIE
                    You re an agent.

                                  THE MAN
                    Christ, no.

                                  YOUNG HOTTIE
                    A lawyer.

                                  THE MAN
                    You know what? This game s boring. 
                    Can we just make out?

      The Young Hottie nods affirmatively, holds up the  one 
      second  finger, does yet another line. She rises up, and

      BLOOD STREAMS FROM HER NOSE. She starts to shake and cough. 
      Her eyes roll into the back of her head. 

      SUPER:  2 Hours Ago... 

      INT. SOHO HOUSE - NIGHT

      The same Man sits at the bar, shirt buttoned all the way up. 
      He sips scotch. The Hottie stands close, pressed even closer 
      by the encroaching crowd. Conversation in medias res--

                                  YOUNG HOTTIE
                      ...So--you like to have fun?

                                  THE MAN
                    It s sort of a specialty of mine.

                                  YOUNG HOTTIE
                    Well, I ve got 2 grams of cocaine 
                    and no panties. I m a fun girl.

                                                                    MATCH CUT TO:                                                                                      3.


      The unconscious Hottie, right where we left her. The Man eyes 
      her with something that borders on annoyance. He calmly rises 
      up and walks across the room... 

      To the couch, where a LEATHER BAG, something between a 
      briefcase and a duffel, rests. One song ends. A new one 
      begins. Hip hop. Bass pumps as the Man casually sifts through 
      his bag. His eyes dart to the chaise lounge. She s turning 
      blue. 

      Now, The Man finds what he s been looking for: a SYRINGE. He 
      walks back across the room, to the Hottie. She s frozen, 
      lifeless. The Man eyes her up and down

      AND SLAMS THE NEEDLE INTO HER NECK. Her eyes shoot open with 
      a start of adrenaline. 

                                  YOUNG HOTTIE (CONT D)
                    Damn. 
                          (beat)
                    That is some really good shit.

                                  THE MAN
                    Sure is.

      He leans across, removes the syringe from the Hottie s neck. 
      When she sees it, a light bulb goes off--

                                  YOUNG HOTTIE
                    I got it. You re a doctor!

                                  THE MAN
                    Something like that.

      Meet DR. WILLIAM RUSH.

      EXT. CEDARS SINAI HOSPITAL - SOON AFTER

      A pristine 1963 Ferrari Lusso convertible squeals into the 
      parking lot. Will Rush gets out, walks to the passenger side, 
      opens the door:

                                  RUSH
                    We re here.

      The barely conscious Young Hottie looks up, smiles. A low 
      groan of effort, as Rush hoists her up, throws her arm over 
      his shoulder. They begin the slow shuffle to the Hospital. 
      The Young Hottie slurs:

                                  YOUNG HOTTIE
                    What club did you say this was 
                    again?                                                                                      4.


                                  RUSH
                    It s very exclusive. Just opened.

                                  YOUNG HOTTIE
                    What s it called?

                                  RUSH
                      Emergency.

                                  YOUNG HOTTIE
                    You sure we ll be able to get in?

                                  RUSH
                    Don t worry. I know the door guy.

      INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

      Rush and the confused Hottie enter through sliding doors.

      RUSH POV: A fluorescent-lit Calcutta: homeless people, old 
      men, children with head wounds, women with black eyes. Rush 
      is disgusted. 

                                  RUSH
                    Ugh.

      Rush s eyes settle upon an ER DOCTOR, mid-30 s, balding but 
      handsome. He stands at an ELDERLY WOMAN s bedside. She blows 
      into a SPIROMETER: 

                                  ER DOCTOR
                    That s perfect, Mrs. Weiss. Just 
                    like that.

                                  RUSH (O.S.)
                    Yo McDreamy.

      The ER Doctor turns around, sees Rush and the very confused 
      HOTTIE propped up against him:

                                  RUSH (CONT'D)
                    I believe this girl s had a 
                    coronary incident of some sort. Her 
                    heartbeat is febrile. She s 
                      disoriented. I d keep her overnight 
                    for observation if I were you.
                          (telling a secret)
                    It s possible she s had a heart 
                    attack.

                                  ER DOCTOR
                    And how would you know that?
                          (off his look)
                    OK. We ll check her in.                                                                                      5.


                                  RUSH
                    Good. See you tomorrow.

                                  ER DOCTOR
                    Tomorrow?

                                  RUSH
                    Elliot s birthday. Remember--?

      This is DR. ALEX THOMAS, Rush s best friend. 

                                  ALEX
                    Yes. He s my son, Rush. I just 
                    didn t think you d remember.

                                  RUSH
                    He s my godson. How could I forget?
                          (beat)
                    Plus, Eve puts all that stuff on my 
                    calendar. Then she reminds me the 
                    day before. And calls me the day 
                    of.

      Alex turns to an ATTENDING NURSE, a luscious, full-figured 
      African American woman named TASHA. She s sitting at a desk, 
      scanning a computer screen:

                                  ALEX
                    This guy couldn t even tie his shoe 
                    without a detailed email from his 
                      assistant, but he can remove an 
                    appendix with his eyes closed.

                                  RUSH
                    And I ve had to, on occasion.
                          (to Alex)
                    You re no slouch yourself. Did he 
                    tell you he graduated second in his 
                    class at Harvard?

                                  TASHA
                          (smiles)
                    He did not.

                                  RUSH
                    Yeah, well, you know what they say: 
                    second place is the first loser.
                          (extends his hand)
                    Will Rush. First in my class. 
                    Pleasure to meet you.

      She takes it. Charmed.                                                                                      6.


                                  ALEX
                    A lot of good it did you.

      He flicks his eyes over to the Young Hottie, who s attempting 
      to light a cigarette:

                                  RUSH
                    I don t think you can smoke in 
                    here, sweetheart.

      Now, Alex pulls Rush aside. Hushed voices:

                                  ALEX
                    You are completely jacked up right 
                    now--

                                  RUSH
                          (re: Tasha)
                    Is she new?

                                  ALEX
                    Yeah.

                                  RUSH
                    She seems very--
                          (beat)
                      Competent. You re supposed to keep 
                    me apprised of all the new talent 
                    here at the hospital. You re my 
                    inside guy-- 

                                  ALEX
                    I m not your anything. How much 
                    blow have you done?

                                  RUSH
                    Spare me the moralizing, Doctor. I 
                    just saved this girl s life. Now, 
                    if you ll excuse me--
                          (to the Hottie, making 
                             hand phone  gesture)
                    Call me.

      He looks at Alex, then to the Hottie:

                                  RUSH (CONT'D)
                    Keep an eye on this one. 
                          (whispers)
                    She s a total fucking mess.

      And with that, he s gone.


                                    END OF TEASER                                                                                      7.


                                        ACT ONE

      EXT. CEDARS SINAI - DAWN

      Rush exits the hospital, squints into the oncoming dawn. It s 
      a quiet morning, punctuated by low chatter from the PATIENTS 
      and HOSPITAL EMPLOYEES that dot the parking lot. 

      Now, an AMBULANCE speeds in. Attendants swarm it, surround a 
      WHEEZING WOMAN, mid-60 s. Her HUSBAND is by her side. His 
      terrified SCREAMS pierce the morning air.

      BEEP-BEEP. Rush clicks his keychain. The Ferrari unlocks. He 
      doesn t break his stride.

                                  RADIO DJ (O.S.)
                    ...Gonna be a hot one today, Los 
                      Angeles...

      EXT. 101 FWY - MORNING

      A bright and beautiful LA Morning. Rush drives, sunglasses 
      on, holding his Blackberry against the wheel. His other hand 
      scans the radio.

      His car is filled with Banker s Boxes, files, CD s, empty Red 
      Bulls. An archaic pager rests on the dash. It s a makeshift 
      office. Although a disaster, it s got a sort of messy logic 
      to it. Kind of like Rush himself.

      His CELL PHONE RINGS. He picks up:

                                  RUSH
                    My car s making a strange noise--

      On the other end, EVE, Rush s assistant:

                                  EVE (O.S.)
                    I m not a mechanic. You re late.

      Rush clicks on his Bluetooth, tosses the Blackberry onto the 
      passenger seat:

                                  RUSH
                    I m close. Can you order me the 
                    poached eggs with wasabi oil and 
                    shiitake chutney? Actually, you 
                    know what? Just a burger.

      INT. MAISON CRESSON HOTEL - DAY

      EVE walks through the lobby of an opulent boutique hotel. She  
      is a beautiful young pixie: innocent, stylish, sexy.                                                                                       8.


                                  EVE
                    Martin Hanover called--

                                  RUSH
                    How s he doing?

                                  EVE
                    Finally breathing on his own. 

        INTERCUTTING

      Rush throws a pill into his mouth. He reaches under his seat 
      and brandishes a Vitamin Water, gulps it down. 

                                  RUSH 
                    And his wife?

                                  EVE
                    She checked back into rehab.

                                  RUSH
                    Nothing scarier than a drunk chick 
                    with a gun--

      He leans over to the passenger seat, where stacks of MIX CDs 
      are strewn about, scratched, exposed. Upon each, in black 
      sharpie, a scrawled label:  SORRY 4 YOURSELF ,  SMOOTH 
      OPERATOR , etc. Rush sifts through them--

      Rush finds a CD that reads,  IRONIC HAPPY MUSIC , puts it in 
      the stereo. Bubblegum pop rises on the soundtrack. 

      INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - DAY

      Eve passes the CONCIERGE, gives him a nod:

                                  EVE
                    Can you turn that music down, 
                    please?

      EXT 101 FWY - CONTINUOUS

                                  RUSH
                    You got something against Debbie 
                    Gibson?

      The CD starts to skip. 

                                  RUSH (CONT'D)
                    My CD s are skipping.

                                  EVE
                    You re living in the aughts, Rush. 
                    No one listens to CDs anymore. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                      9.

                                  EVE (CONT'D)
                    There s this new thing called an 
                    iPod. I can install one in your  
                    car--

                                  RUSH
                    I thought you weren t a mechanic.

      Rush turns into a West Hollywood parking lot, lined with tall 
      plants, well manicured grass. This is the exterior of the 
      Maison Cresson. A VALET moves quickly to the Ferrari, as Rush 
      puts it in park. The Valet opens the door for him.

                                  RUSH (CONT'D)
                    Thank you.

      As Eve approaches. They both hang up their phones: 

                                  RUSH (CONT D)
                    Did you order my breakfast?

      Eve just looks at him.

      INT. HOTEL - DAY

      Rush strides through the hotel lobby. Eve tries to keep up:

                                  EVE
                    You look like shit.

                                  RUSH 
                    And you look very pretty.

                                  EVE
                    You didn t sleep again, did you?

                                  RUSH
                    The human body can chronically 
                    restrict its own sleep cycle 
                    without any noticeable effects. 
                    I've tricked my neurochemical and 
                    hormonal emission/production cycles 
                    to activate in my waking state. So, 
                    you know, I need less sleep than 
                    normal humans.

                                  EVE
                    But you re still human, Will.

                                  RUSH
                    It s so cute that you think that.                                                                                    10.


      INT. RUSH S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

      A palatial suite. Rush showers. A half-eaten breakfast sits 
      on a room service table. Eve speaks from the other room.

                                  RUSH
                    I can t just give her more  
                      methadone. She has to manage it. 
                    That s the whole point. Give her a 
                      prescription for weed if she needs 
                    something so bad--

                                  EVE
                    You re prescribing marijuana to a 
                    junkie?

                                  RUSH
                    Yes I am. It works, trust me. 

      Eve averts her eyes as Rush snatches a towel, wraps it around 
      his waist.

                                  RUSH (CONT'D)
                    That it--?

                                  EVE
                    Red Cummings called.

                                  RUSH
                    When?

                                  EVE
                    A few hours ago.

                                  RUSH
                    And you tell me now? What did he 
                    want?

                                  EVE
                    What do you think he wanted? 

                                  RUSH
                          (sharply)
                    You have to tell me as soon as 
                    Cummings calls. You know that.

                                  EVE 
                    You shouldn t enable an asshole 
                    like that--

                                  RUSH
                    I m an asshole. You enable me every 
                    day.                                                                                    11.


                                  EVE
                    You re not like him, Rush.

                                  RUSH
                    It s all degrees, baby.
                          (beat)
                    You know the policy: we don t 
                    screen, we don t discriminate, we 
                    don t judge. I m not a shrink, I m 
                    not a lawyer, I m not a priest, I m 
                    not a cop.
                          (beat)
                    We treat people who pay. And Red 
                    Cummings pays.

      EXT. STUDIO CITY MCMANSION - DAY

      Rush rings the doorbell of a palatial Studio City home. The 
      door SWINGS OPEN, and on the other side--RED CUMMINGS, tall, 
      thick, Midwestern, and American as apple pie. Cleanup hitter 
      for the Los Angeles Dodgers.

                                  RED CUMMINGS
                    Took a while.

      Rush ignores him, enters the house. The interior is straight 
      out of MTV Cribs: massive, sparse, with wall-to-wall white 
      carpet. The only personal touch is some of Red s sports 
      memorabilia on the walls.

      And in the Living Room, Rush spots a WOMAN slumped against 
      the couch. Blood dripping from her lip onto the white carpet 
      beneath her. Cut beneath her eye. This is Hannah. Rush shoots 
      Red a look.

                                  RED CUMMINGS (CONT'D)
                    She drank my juice.

                                  RUSH
                          (incredulous)
                    She drank your juice.

      Rush sighs, moves to the woman quickly, opening his medical 
      bag as he does:

                                  RED CUMMINGS
                    Doc, that juice is hand-squeezed by 
                    a Tibetan monk and imported daily 
                    from Nagchu. It keeps me centered.
                          (off his look)
                    ...And I ve been in this goddamned 
                    slump for weeks. I m sorry, but 
                    that stuff gets to a ballplayer. 
                    They all say it don t, but it does--                                                                                    12.


      Rush kneels by Hannah, gets a closer look:

                                  RUSH
                    Well, that s gonna cost you 15 
                    grand.

      Red looks at him, nods, disappears into the other room. Rush 
      begins to attend to Hannah, removing items from his kit. 
      She s dazed, numb. Red returns, stands over Rush, several 
      stacks of cash in his hand:

                                  RUSH (CONT'D)
                    Next time, could you at least take 
                    off your rings before you hit her?

                                  RED CUMMINGS
                    I know, Doc. I know. But those are 
                    World Series rings. You win  em, 
                    you leave  em on. That s just what 
                    you do. People have to know you re 
                      a champion.
                          (beat)
                    But there ain t gonna be no next 
                    time, Doc. I m gon  get this thing 
                    under control--

      Rush offers no response. Instead, his eyes turn to the cash:

                                  RUSH
                    It s all there?

                                  RED CUMMINGS
                    Count it.

                                  RUSH
                    You count it. I ll take care of 
                    your lady.

      INT. STUDIO CITY MCMANSION - LATER

      PULL BACK from Hannah s lip, as Rush DRAWS A NEEDLE through 
      it. He s just about done with the stitches. Hannah holds an 
      ICE PACK to her cheek, silent... In the background, Red walks 
      back and forth on the phone, swinging a bat. He s distracted:

                                  RED CUMMINGS
                    Look, let me make this simple: I m 
                    not goin  if Bradley s goin . Not 
                    after what he tweeted about me! I 
                    don t care if it s for charity, 
                    some shit s a matter of principle. 
                    Them kids re just gon  have to wait 
                    for the hospital to make me an 
                    exclusive offer--                                                                                    13.


      Rush tries to ignore him. He squints with concentration, 
      forcing the needle through Hannah s lip one last time... Rush 
      snips the string with a small scissors... 

      And Hannah just looks at him. With hopelessness, with fear. A 
      silent plea. Rush s eyes lock with hers. 

                                  RUSH
                    Can I give you some advice?

      She nods.

                                  RUSH (CONT'D)
                    Don t drink his juice.

      INT. EL COMPADRE MEXICAN RESTAURANT - DAY

      One of those classic Los Angeles Mexican restaurants where 
      even the pictures of the food look disgusting. Health Board 
      rates it a  C , and they re proud of it. Dimly lit with 
      flickering fluorescents. Dotted with hipsters and cholos.

      Rush sits in the back, sipping a Michelada. Music plays 
      softly. Out the window, in blazing sunlight, a MAN pulls up 
      on a CHOPPER. This is MANNY MARQUIS, part surfer dude, part 
      Cholo. He strides through the front door, sits down:

                                  MANNY
                    Sorry I m late, Bro. That Andrew 
                    McCarthy can talk. 

      Manny slides into the booth. He reaches into his FANNY PACK, 
      pulls out a CORNUCOPIA OF NARCOTICS: pills, powders, liquids, 
      etc. He holds them just beneath the table:

                                  MANNY (CONT'D)
                    What you want today, Bro? Same 
                    shit? 

                                  RUSH
                    Same shit.

                                  MANNY
                    Steady and precise. Like an egg 
                    timer. You cook eggs? That s the 
                    only shit I cook, bro. My doctor 
                    has me on a paleo diet. Pre-
                      agricultural and shit, like cavemen 
                    eat--

      Manny removes a PAPER BAG from his fanny pack, slides some 
      baggies, pills, etc. into it:                                                                                    14.


                                  MANNY (CONT D)
                    Most people I see, they buy an 
                    eight ball in the afternoon, next 
                    thing you know I m getting a call 
                    at 6 in the morning asking me for 
                    more shit. Not you. You got 
                      discipline. It s damn near 
                      admirable.

                                  RUSH
                      Homeostasis.

                                  MANNY 
                    Homey, what?

                                  RUSH
                    It s the property of a system--in 
                    this case, the human body, that 
                    regulates its internal environment 
                    so as to maintain a stable, 
                    constant condition.
                          (taking the paper bag)
                    Some systems just need a little 
                    more help than others.

      Rush reaches into his MEDICAL BAG, removes up his 
        PRESCRIPTION PAD, tears off a wad of papers:

                                  RUSH (CONT'D)
                    Remember, never fill more than 2 of 
                    these at a time.
                          (beat)
                    Can I ask you a question, Manny?

      Manny nods warily:

                                  RUSH (CONT'D)
                    You still giving Red Cummings 
                    steroids?

                                  MANNY
                    Hell no. That shit s way too hot 
                    right now, Rush. You think I need 
                    to be testifyin  in front of a 
                    grand jury and shit? 
                          (beat)
                    Why you think he s having such a 
                    shitty season?

      INT. MEXICAN RESTAURANT BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      A grimy bathroom. Flies buzz, as Rush stares into the 
        graffiti-covered mirror.                                                                                     15.


      He puts a little coke between his thumb and forefinger, 
      SNORTS.His phone vibrates now. He reaches into his pocket--

      1 TEXT MESSAGE. From EVE. REMINDER ELLIOT BIRTHDAY PARTY @ 3.

      Rush checks his watch. Shit.

      EXT. ALEX THOMAS  HOUSE - DAY

      A beautiful Silver Lake house: simple, tasteful. Rush s 
      convertible screeches into the driveway, pulling alongside 
      Minivans and Station Wagons... He approaches the front door,

      And he s intercepted by Eve, who carries a WRAPPED PRESENT:

                                  EVE
                    It s a Lego Racer. He ll love it.

                                  RUSH
                    What would I do without you?

                                  EVE
                    It wouldn t be pretty.
                          (beat)
                    Uh, Rush?

      He looks at her. She moves in close, wipes a bit of coke from 
      beneath his nose. He gives her the thumbs-up, a wink:

                                  RUSH
                    Keep up the good work.
                          (beat)
                    You sure you don t want to come in? 
                    Could be some cute guys in there--

                                  EVE
                    It s a six-year-old s birthday--

                                  RUSH
                    Please. Just for a second. You know 
                    how much Laurel hates me. You could 
                    run interference--

                                  EVE
                    As enticing as that sounds, I 
                    can t. I have plans this evening.

      Rush s ears prick up:

                                  RUSH 
                    Really?                                                                                    16.


                                  EVE
                    Yes. I do have a life outside of 
                    this job, you know.

                                  RUSH
                    I did not know that, actually. But, 
                    for what it s worth, I m glad 
                    you re dating. I think it s 
                    healthy. 

                                  EVE
                    Coming from the expert on health.

                                  RUSH
                    I am a doctor.
                          (beat)
                    So, who is it? The bartender from 
                    Harvard and Stone? The one who s 
                    doing Blue Steel in all his 
                    Facebook pics?

                                  EVE
                    Bye, Rush.

                                  RUSH
                    No way. Not Hairplugs Guy from 
                    Tender Greens?

      She walks away. Rush calls after her:

                                  RUSH (CONT'D)
                    Don t go down on him! He ll never 
                    call you again!

      INT. ALEX THOMAS  HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

      Decorations everywhere. Balloons, streamers, etc. And Rush 
      enters, surveys the room... Kids run around, playing. Parents 
      immersed in conversation. Now, he spots Alex, his wife LAUREL 
      (late 30 s), pretty, high strung. They re talking to an OLDER 
      COUPLE. Rush approaches. Alex looks taken aback:

                                  ALEX
                    You made it.

                                  RUSH
                    Sure did. Brought a gift too.

                                  LAUREL
                          (forced smile)
                    How sweet. Thank you. I ll give it 
                    to Elliot.                                                                                    17.


                                  RUSH
                    I d kinda like to give it to him 
                    myself--

                                  LAUREL
                          (grabbing the present)
                    Oh, he s in the back. Playing with 
                    his friends. I ll get it to him--

      She walks off. Rush shoots Alex a look. He shrugs 
        apologetically, follows his wife--

                                  LAUREL (CONT'D)
                          (whispers)
                    Why is he here? I thought we had a 
                    deal--

                                  ALEX
                    I didn t think he d remember. He 
                    never remembers.

                                  LAUREL
                    He s on something.
                          (beat)
                    Oh my God, he s talking to them--

      She turns back, sees Rush talking to the Older Couple. He 
        gesticulates wildly. The Older Couple nod politely. Alex and 
      Laurel can t hear what he s saying. That s what scares them.

                                  LAUREL (CONT'D)
                    Those people are about to make you 
                    Chair, sweetheart. We have to keep 
                    them as far away from Will Rush as 
                    possible.

      ANGLE ON Rush. As he asks the Older Couple--

                                  RUSH
                    ...I m parched. Do you happen to 
                    know where the bar is?

                                  OLDER WOMAN
                    I m not sure there is one.

                                  RUSH
                    That s OK. I know where they keep 
                    the good stuff.

      Rush exits, dodging the kids, en route to the kitchen. When 
      he turns the corner, he FREEZES. And just about melts.

      RUSH POV: Across the room, SARAH (mid-30 s), elegant, 
      gorgeous...                                                                                    18.


                                  RUSH (CONT'D)
                    Sarah--?

      Sarah turns. When she spots Rush, her face drops:

                                  SARAH
                    I didn t think you d be here.

                                  RUSH
                    The kid s my godson. I never miss a 
                      birthday--

                                  SARAH
                    Lucky me.

                                  RUSH
                    What are you doing here?

                                  SARAH
                    I had a job interview yesterday at 
                    UCLA. I m just in town for the 
                    weekend.

                                  RUSH
                      Wait--you re moving back?

                                  SARAH
                    Don t worry. I doubt I ll get the 
                    job. I m barely qualified.

                                  RUSH
                    You re overqualified for everything 
                    and you know it. You re brilliant.

                                  SARAH
                    I dated you for four years. How 
                    smart can I be?

                                  RUSH
                    You look beautiful. 

                                  SARAH
                    You look the same.

                                  RUSH
                    You re all grown up.

                                  SARAH
                    Some people do that.

      An awkward beat:

                                  RUSH 
                    I quit smoking.                                                                                    19.


                                  SARAH
                    That s great, Will.

      They lock eyes. Unspoken, shared memories. Rush is thrown:

                                  RUSH 
                    Will you excuse me for a second?

      INT. ALEX THOMAS  BATHROOM - DAY

      Rush inhales deeply off a joint. He exhales out the window, 
      flips through PARENTING magazine. There s a KNOCK at the 
      door. Rush leaps up, starts wafting the smoke out the window:

                                  RUSH
                    One second.

                                  ALEX (O.S.)
                    It s me.

      Rush opens the door, Alex sneaks in:

                                  ALEX (CONT'D)
                    Rush, this is my son s birthday 
                    party.

                                  RUSH
                    Sarah? You invite Sarah without 
                    telling me--?
                          (realizing)
                    You didn t want me here.

      Alex looks at him, busted.

                                  ALEX
                    She s just in town for the weekend. 
                    She s one of Laurel s best friends, 
                    Will. And you never show up--

                                  RUSH
                    I always show up.

                    Why did we break up again?

                                  ALEX
                    You were terrible to her.

                                  RUSH 
                    I was a kid.

                                  ALEX
                    You were 30.                                                                                    20.


                                  RUSH
                    Barely.

      Rush thinks. A beat.

                                  RUSH (CONT D)
                    No. Nuh-uh, She was stubborn.
                          (beat)
                    She would never shave it, you know 
                    that? Not even a trim--

                                  ALEX
                          (heard this before)
                    Yes. I know.

                                  RUSH
                    I need to sober up.

      He s about to toss the joint into the toilet, when:

                                  ALEX
                    Easy, easy. 
                          (snatches the joint)
                    Just one hit.
                          (beat)
                    Birthday parties stress me out.

                                  RUSH
                    You re an ER Doctor--

                                  ALEX
                    I know. I m talking to my therapist 
                    about it.

                                  RUSH
                    Her being here. It s like--what s 
                    that thing Scientologists believe 
                    in? Fate. 

                                  ALEX
                    Don t open this up if you can t 
                    follow through, Will.

                                  RUSH
                          (nodding)
                    I know. I know. You re right.

      They sit there, a beat:

                                  RUSH (CONT'D)
                    Give me one more hit.

                                        ACT TWO

      INT. ALEX THOMAS  HOUSE - AFTERNOON

      Alex opens the bathroom door, trying to hide his guilt. He 
      reenters the party,

      ANGLE ON ELLIOT THOMAS, 6, adorable. Eyeing the bathroom with 
      skepticism. After a beat, Rush opens the door...

                                  ELLIOT
                    Rush!

                                  RUSH
                    Hey, kid.

      Elliot runs up to Rush, gives him a hug:

                                  ELLIOT
                    Thanks for the Lego!

      Rush pulls Elliot aside. Hushed voices:

                                  RUSH
                    You know it s a cover, right?
                          (off his look)
                      I deposited another 5k in the money 
                    market account I opened for you. 
                    Legos are nice, but they re no 
                      substitute for cash.

      Elliot nods, taking this in:

                                  RUSH (CONT'D)
                    Don t forget, you only use it--

                                  ELLIOT
                    For emergencies.

                                  RUSH
                    ...Or really pretty women.

      Elliot smiles. And Rush looks up, sees Sarah watching him:

                                  RUSH (CONT'D)
                     And he s good with kids? Is this 
                    guy perfect or what? 

      As much as she tries not to, Sarah smiles. Rush moves closer:

                                  RUSH (CONT'D)
                    Have dinner with me tonight.                                                                                    22.


                                  SARAH
                    I don t think that s a good idea.

                                  RUSH
                    Please. It s been so long. Don t go 
                    back to San Francisco without 
                    seeing me again--
                          (to Elliot)
                    Don t you think Sarah should have 
                    dinner with Uncle Rush tonight?

      Elliot nods.

                                  SARAH
                    That s a dirty trick.

                                  RUSH
                    He s got really good judgment.

                                  SARAH
                    I just saw him eat dirt. 

                                  SARAH (CONT D)
                    Look, Will, you and I--
                          (beat)
                    You re like Paxil; I m like 
                      thioridazineare. Each one functions 
                    fine on its own. Once or twice, you 
                    can take them together. You might 
                    even catch a pretty good buzz--

      Rush raises his eyebrow, smiles:

                                  SARAH (CONT'D)
                    But repeated usage becomes toxic 
                    and results in death.

      Rush sighs. And now, the CAKE comes out. Rush starts singing 
       Happy Birthday , staring right at Sarah, not giving up.

       Happy Birthday to you... 

                                  RUSH 
                    It s just dinner--

      She shakes her head.

                                  RUSH (CONT D)
                    Just sex then?

       Happy Birthday to you... 

                                  RUSH (CONT'D)
                    I m different. I m better.                                                                                     23.


       Happy Birthday, dear Elliot... 

                                  RUSH (CONT'D)
                      I promise. 
                          (beat)
                    Please. I really missed you, Sarah. 

       Happy Birthday to you! 

      He looks at her. She looks at him, exhales:

                                  SARAH
                    Fine.
                          (beat)
                    To dinner. Not sex.

      EXT. HOLLYWOOD STREETS - AFTERNOON

      Rush drives, grinning wide. An 80 s power ballad blasts from 
      his stereo. His phone rings. He grabs it:

                                  RUSH
                    This is Rush.

                                  EVE (O.S.)
                    We received an emergency call from 
                      Brentwood.

                                  RUSH
                    What is it?

      INT. RUSH S HOTEL ROOM CONTINUOUS

      Eve sits at a DESK, on the phone:

                                  EVE
                    It s a first.

      EXT. BRENTWOOD MANSION - AFTERNOON

      A BARELY-CLAD WOMAN opens the door to a giant mansion: 

                                  RUSH
                    I m here to see Billy Bloom.

      She nods. Behind her, remnants of a party that s been going 
      on all night and into today. She turns, leading Rush past 
      young hipster girls, older musicians, a few androgynous 
      youngsters, upstairs and into the

      INT. BRENTWOOD BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

      A giant room, tastefully decorated. A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN sits on 
      a large canopy bed, bathrobe covering black underwear.                                                                                     24.


      She smokes a cigarette, taps at her phone. Film posters line 
      the walls. Dailies play on a flatscreen TV.

      And right in Rush s face, a Jewish man, mid-30 s, well 
      groomed and vaguely handsome, if slightly overweight. He 
      wears a Nike windbreaker and towel around his waist. 

                                  RUSH
                    Mr. Bloom--?

      He nods.

                                  RUSH (CONT D)
                    Big fan.

                                  BILLY
                    Thank you. Thank you. Very kind. 
                    Listen, I think I broke my cock.

      The girl on the bed pays no attention, exhales smoke.

                                  RUSH
                    Excuse me?

                                  BILLY
                    I ve been sitting here with a 
                    broken cock for two hours now. It s 
                      excruciating--
                          (beat)
                    I should have just trusted my gut 
                    and jerked off.
                          (to the Girl)
                    I go down on you for 45 minutes, 
                    and this is the thanks I get?

                                  BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
                    It wasn t 45 minutes.

                                  RUSH
                    May I see?

      Rush walks over to Billy, who gingerly lifts up his towel. 
      Rush peers under it for a moment, looks Billy in the eyes:

                                  RUSH (CONT'D)
                    20 grand. Cash.

      Billy furrows his brow:

                                  BILLY
                    You think I keep that kind of money 
                    lying around the house? Trust me. 
                    I m good for it.                                                                                     25.


                                  RUSH
                    I m sorry, Mr. Bloom. I believe my 
                    assistant informed you that we 
                    require cash in advance before we 
                    render any medical assistance.

                                  BILLY
                      Buddy--bro--you ok? My assistant 
                    offer you something to drink?

                                  RUSH
                    I m fine.

                                  BILLY
                    OK. Good. Look around this room--

      He points to a decanter that rests on the night stand:

                                  BILLY (CONT D)
                    That s Baccarat crystal.
                          (he points to a painting 
                          on the wall)
                    That s a Rothko...
                          (beat)
                    Tell you what, Google how much I m 
                    worth when you re done fixing my 
                    cock. Now, please...this is killing 
                    me!

                                  RUSH
                    Again, really sorry. I ll be happy 
                    to call an ambulance for you--

                                  BILLY
                    Bro, you kidding? I m a public 
                    figure. And this girl here, she s a 
                      semi-famous actress--

                                  BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
                    Hey!

                                  BILLY
                    ...Who was on her way to becoming a 
                    more famous actress until she 
                    decided to treat my cock like a 
                    fucking rental car.
                          (beat)
                      GODDAMMIT! THIS HURTS. The point 
                    is, I don t want to read about my 
                    broken dick when I m checking out 
                    at Whole Foods, OK? We are talking 
                    Us Weekly cover story material 
                    here. Please. This is an emergency.                                                                                    26.


                                  RUSH
                    I only handle emergencies. This is 
                    standard.

                                  BILLY
                    THIS IS STANDARD?

      Rush starts to walk out.

                                  BILLY (CONT D)
                    I ll pay you double--

      Rush stops, turns around:

                                  BILLY (CONT D)
                    Forty grand--

                                  RUSH
                    Wired into my account by close of 
                    business today--

                                  BILLY
                    Yes, yes. Please. Just fix it.

      Rush nods, walks back. He reaches over, lifts the towel up:

                                  RUSH
                    Did you hear a pop?

                                  BILLY
                    Yeah.
                          (beat)
                    Is that bad?

                                  RUSH
                    You ve ruptured your corpus 
                      cavernosum. I have to drain it.

      Rush looks to the naked girl on the bed:

                                  RUSH (CONT'D)
                    My dear, do you have any nursing 
                      experience? 

                                  BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
                    I was a sexy nurse for Halloween 
                    once.

                                  RUSH 
                    Perfect. Little help over here?

      She drops her cigarette into a champagne glass, gets up. Rush 
      removes a LARGE SYRINGE. CU on Billy, sweating, terrified.                                                                                     27.


      INT. EVE S APARTMENT - NIGHT

      An immaculate West Hollywood studio. Sparse, Ikea-furnished. 
        Sportscenter plays on TV. A phone rings in the background. 
      Eve exits the bathroom, freshly showered, throwing on her 
      blouse. She grabs her Blackberry:

                                  EVE
                    Hello--

                                  RUSH (O.S.)
                    Billy Bloom was supposed to wire 
                    40k into the primary business 
                    account by 6pm today. Can you check 
                    the balance for me?

      Eve opens her laptop, logs into the bank website.

      INT. RUSH S HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

      Rush stands in the shadows of his darkened suite, buttons his 
      crisp shirt, stares out the window at the twinkling panorama 
      beneath him. Night has come to Hollywood.

                                  EVE (O.S.)
                    No recent activity.

                                  RUSH
                    You re kidding me.

                                  EVE 
                    I am not.
                          (beat)
                    What happened to  cash up front ? I 
                    thought that was our policy?

                                  RUSH
                    We made an arrangement. I doubled 
                    my fee.

                                  EVE
                    Only if he pays.

                                  RUSH
                    It s under control, Eve.

      Rush walks to the wet bar, pours himself some scotch:

                                  RUSH (CONT'D)
                    Listen, no more calls tonight. I 
                    don t care what it is, I don t care 
                    how much they offer. Just say I m 
                    out of town--                                                                                    28.


                                  EVE
                    Wow. I ve never heard you talk like 
                    that before. Who is she?

                                  RUSH
                    My first love. My only love, unless 
                    you count that night in Belize. But 
                    I m fairly certain that was the 
                    vicodin talking--

      Eve looks into the phone. A bit taken aback. Jealous, maybe? 

                                  EVE
                    Poor girl.

      Rush enters the bathroom, looks in the mirror. He shakes his 
      head, unbuttons his shirt--

                                  RUSH
                    I m gonna convince her to give me 
                    another chance. What does a 
                    reformed asshole wear to dinner--?

                                  EVE
                    You re reformed? 

                                  RUSH
                    Yes, I m reformed.

                                  EVE
                    I didn t get the memo. You sure 
                    this is such a good idea?

                                  RUSH 
                    Are you sure it s such a good idea 
                    to go out with Dry Cleans His Jeans 
                    Guy?

                                  EVE
                    Goodbye, Rush. Enjoy your date.

                                  RUSH
                    Yeah. You too.

      And Eve hangs up the phone, turns her attention to, THE TV. 
      The Dodgers pregame show. Vin Scully interviews Red Cummings.

                                  VIN SCULLY
                    Last night, Red, you went 0 for 5, 
                    extending your hitless streak to 
                    three games. Manager Don Mattingly 
                    has dropped you 2 slots in the 
                    batting order. How do you get 
                    yourself out of a funk like this?                                                                                    29.


                                  RED CUMMINGS
                    You just keep showin  up at the 
                    ballpark. That s all you can do. 
                    Look, I ve been through slumps 
                    before. The team s winning. That s 
                    the most important thing.

      She grabs the remote, flips it off. 

      INT. RUSH S BATHROOM - NIGHT

      Rush, in a new button down shirt, eyes himself in the mirror. 
      In front of him, DRUGS: the ones he got from Manny, along 
      with prescription bottles, etc. Laid out next to each other 
      in careful alignment. Rush grabs a handful, and--

      SUPER:  2 Hours Later... 

      INT. SARAH S HOTEL - LATER

      Rush sits across from Sarah, eyes bulging and dilated. He 
      grinds his teeth, grips his wine glass tightly...

                                  SARAH
                    You all right?

                                  RUSH
                    Me? Sure, I m fine.

      The glass SHATTERS in his hand. Red wine spatters his face. 

      INT. RUSH S BATHROOM - PRESENT

      Rush puts the pills back. Not tonight.

      INT. SUNSET TOWER HOTEL - OUTDOOR DINING PATIO - LATER

      Rush walks nervously through the restaurant. At a table by 
      the pool, he spots Sarah. She sits straight up, demure, 
      collected, gorgeous. Rush stops a beat, steels himself. He 
      steps forward:

                                  RUSH
                    Jesus, it s like the seventh level 
                    of hell in here. Is that Lindsey 
                    Lohan?

                                  SARAH
                    Hello, Will.

      Rush sits down, smiles sweetly. Bobs nervously in place.

                                  SARAH (CONT'D)
                    You all right?                                                                                    30.


                                  RUSH
                    Me? Perfect.
                          (beat)
                    Kind of nervous, actually.

                                  SARAH
                    Don t be. I m not going to sleep 
                    with you.

                                  RUSH
                    That s a relief. Now I can be 
                    myself. Wine?

      EXT. TEDDY S BAR - NIGHT

      Bass. Beautiful people. A scene. The din of the crowd 
      jockeying for position to get in...

      Eve waits quietly, completely out of place in this setting. 
      The DOORMAN scans the crowd, lets a few people in: 

                                    DOORMAN
                    ...And you.

      EXT. TEDDY S BAR, POOLSIDE - NIGHT

      Eve walks past gorgeous girls and gawking guys. She feels 
      their eyes on her, as she moves to the bar. She looks around, 
      nervous. A HANDSOME GUY approaches:

                                  HANDSOME GUY
                    You here alone?

                                  EVE
                    I m waiting for someone.

      He nods, contemplating his next move. Then:

                                  HANDSOME GUY
                    Nice skirt.

      She doesn t answer, scans the bar:

                                  HANDSOME GUY (CONT'D)
                    Must be really popular--
                          (beat)
                    I ve seen a lot of girls wearing it 
                    tonight.

                                  EVE
                    I get it.
                          (beat)
                    The compliment that s really an 
                    insult. From that pickup book?                                                                                    31.


      He looks at her, thrown:

                                  EVE (CONT'D)
                    It s supposed to make me feel just 
                    a little insecure? Supposed to make 
                    me long for your approval?
                          (off his look)
                    I don t want your approval. 
                          (beat)
                    I would try the crowd at the end of 
                    the bar. They seem a bit more your 
                    speed. Not as well-read.

      He stares, dumbfounded. Then turns and walks away. A FEMALE 
      BARTENDER approaches:

                                  FEMALE BARTENDER
                    You make it look easy.

                                  EVE
                    I have a real knack for repelling 
                    men.

      The Female Bartender leans in. In CLOSEUP we see it s

      HANNAH. Red Cummings  girl. Other than the thin scab on her 
      lip, no evidence of the beating she took earlier. She wears 
      the uniform of this place: jeans and a black tank top.

                                  HANNAH
                    What can I get you?

                                  EVE
                    Glass of Shiraz, please.

      Hannah pours the drink, and Eve looks at her,

      As Hannah brushes her hair behind her ear, revealing a 
        particularly nasty bruise. 

                                  EVE (CONT'D)
                    I think you need a little more 
                      cover-up--

      Hannah instinctively touches her bruise. She looks at Eve:

                                  EVE (CONT'D)
                    He s not going to stop, you know.

                                  HANNAH
                    I m sorry?                                                                                    32.


                                  EVE
                    Your boyfriend. He s not going to 
                    stop hitting you.

                                  HANNAH
                          (taken aback)
                    You don t know anything about me.

                                  EVE
                    ...You re beautiful. You re young. 
                    You come to Los Angeles--from the 
                    South maybe, judging by that little 
                    bit of an accent you re trying to 
                    hide--to live out your dreams, 
                    right? 
                          (off her look)
                    Actress? 

                                  HANNAH
                    Musician.

                                  EVE
                    ...You meet a guy. He s handsome. 
                    He s famous. He s rich. He takes 
                    you to nice places. Maybe you re in 
                    love with him. Probably not...
                          (beat)
                    ...And then he starts hitting you. 
                    And before you know it, you ve 
                    never felt so stuck in your whole 
                    life, and you can t imagine any way 
                    out--

                                  HANNAH
                    Who are you? 

                                  EVE
                    I work for Will Rush. 
                          (beat)
                    Red Cummings is a bad guy. Bad guys 
                    don t change. Trust me on this. 

      They look at each other. There s a mutual sadness they share. 
      Hannah s eyes glaze over with tears. A beat.

      And just as quickly, Hannah s look shifts. She glares at Eve. 
      Steely now:

                                  HANNAH
                    Listen, I appreciate the gesture, 
                    or whatever this is--
                          (beat)
                    But if you don t leave right now, 
                    I m going to have to call security--                                                                                    33.


      And she moves down the line, to a GUY IN A SUIT:

                                  HANNAH (CONT'D)
                    What can I get you, sweetie?

      And Eve watches her, shakes her head. Walks away.

      INT. SUNSET TOWER HOTEL - LATER

      Rush and Sarah, on the tail end of a bottle of wine:

                                  RUSH
                    While it was moving?

                                  SARAH
                    Right onto the street. You thought 
                    the cab driver was trying to kidnap 
                    us--

                                  RUSH
                    He wasn t?

      Sarah shakes her head.

                                  RUSH (CONT'D)
                    Huh. I don t recall that.

                                  SARAH
                      Unsurprising.

                                  RUSH
                    For what it s worth, I haven t 
                    blacked out in 7 years. I haven t 
                    lost my car in 6. Haven t been 
                    arrested in 5 and a half. And I 
                    can t remember the last time I got 
                    my ass kicked--

                                  SARAH
                    The night s still young.

                                  RUSH
                    Is that a proposition?

                                  SARAH
                    It s a threat.
                          (beat)
                    You never give up, do you?

                                  RUSH
                    I won t make the same mistake 
                    twice.

      She looks down. She won t get sucked in:                                                                                    34.


                                  SARAH
                    No. You ll make it a hundred times.

                                  RUSH 
                    Can I say something serious--?

                                  SARAH 
                    Sure.

      He looks at her, now. Really looks at her:

                                  RUSH
                    I m sorry.

      We don t know what for, but we know he means it. And we know 
      that she s been waiting for those words for years. And it 
      throws her. She shakes her head:

                                  SARAH
                    You think that s gonna fix things?

                                  RUSH
                    No, but it s a start.

      A beat. They look at each other...

                                  SARAH
                    You re a real asshole, Rush.

      INT. SARAH S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

      Rush and Sarah kiss. It s heated, intense. Beneath music, the 
      rhythm of their soft breathing. Sarah takes off Rush s tie, 
      unbuttons his shirt. They fall into bed, kissing hard.

      Rush unbuttons her shirt, kisses her neck, touches her 
      breasts... Now he pulls back, looks at her:

                                  RUSH
                    They re different.

                                  SARAH
                    They re new.

                                  RUSH
                          (confused)
                    But your tits were spectacular.

      Sarah weighs going on, then--slowly, softly:

                                  SARAH
                    I tested positive for the BRCA-1 
                      mutation--                                                                                    35.


      Rush sits up. He wasn t expecting that. A beat, then:

                                  RUSH
                    Not everyone with that gets sick.

                                  SARAH
                    89%. That s enough.

                                  RUSH
                    So you--

                                  SARAH
                    Yeah. I Angelina d them.

      She looks at him, waiting for words of comfort, any words at 
      all. But all Rush can do is stare at the ground. Confused. 
      Hurt. Speechless.

                                  SARAH (CONT'D)
                    Rush--? Can you say something 
                    please?

                                  RUSH
                    Wow. I m sorry. That s--just--
                          (beat)
                    A lot.

      Sarah smiles sadly. A long, lingering beat, until

      RUSH S PHONE RINGS... And he sits, frozen. As it rings again. 
      And again. Finally:

                                  RUSH (CONT'D)
                          (annoyed)
                    I told her, no work calls--
                          (beat)
                    I m sorry--

                                  SARAH
                    Not a problem.

                                  RUSH
                    It must be important. Just one 
                    second. 

      INT. HOTEL BATHROOM  - NIGHT

      Rush picks up his cell phone:

                                  RUSH
                    What.

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                    I need your help.                                                                                    36.


                                  RUSH
                    Who the hell is this?

      INT. EAST LA WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

      Manny, anxious, stands in the corner, on his cell phone.

                                  MANNY
                    It s me, Rush. It s Manny.

                                  RUSH
                          (hushed)
                    I m off the clock, Manny.

                                  MANNY
                    I know, man. I know. But there s 
                    been some trouble, Rush. Some 
                    business associates of mine--

                                  RUSH
                    Business associates?

                                  MANNY
                    You know what I mean.

                                  RUSH
                    Not my crowd.

                                  MANNY
                    Please, Rush. Shit is deep, bro. 
                    Shit is deep. I need you--

      Rush opens the bathroom door a crack. Sees Sarah sitting on 
      the edge of the bed, buttoning her blouse. He considers...

      INT. RUSH S HOTEL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      Rush stands over Sarah:

                                  RUSH
                    It s an emergency. I ll be back 
                    soon. I promise--

                                  SARAH
                          (resigned)
                    It s OK, Rush.

                                  RUSH
                    No. We re going to talk about this. 
                    Two hours. Tops. I promise. I m 
                    sure this thing, whatever it is, 
                      it s...manageable.                                                                                    37.


      INT. EAST LA WAREHOUSE - LATER

      Rush stands, numb, takes in the scene:

      2 GANGBANGERS lie opposite each other on a concrete floor. 
      One man, African American, is dead. The other, a YOUNG 
      MEXICAN MAN, has been shot in the stomach. Blood pools at 
      Rush s feet.  

                                  YOUNG MEXICAN MAN
                    My God! Help me! It hurts. It 
                    fuckin  hurts so bad. Please! 
                    Please, YOU HAVE TO HELP ME!

      Rush is horrified. He kneels, looks in the Man s eyes:

                                  RUSH
                    What s your name?

                                  YOUNG MEXICAN MAN
                    Julio.

                                  RUSH
                    Julio, please stop talking.

      Rush moves to Julio s bloodstained shirt, unbuttons it, pulls 
      it to the side, revealing The BULLET WOUND. Blood gushes from 
      it. Rush gets up now, walks across the room--  

      Where a BIGASS MEXICAN DUDE looms large, flanked by drug 
      dealer Manny and 3 other gang members. This is Raoul. 

                                  RUSH (CONT D)
                    This man is in serious condition. 
                    He s losing blood. I m going to 
                    need to get him to a hospital.

                                  RAOUL
                    That s not an option, doc.

                                  RUSH
                    That s the only option.

      Suddenly, Raoul pulls a GLOCK, holds it to Rush s temple:

                                  RAOUL
                    I m sure you ll figure something 
                    out.

      Rush winces. This is not good. 


                                  END OF ACT TWO                                                                                    38.


                                      ACT THREE

      In a small, dimly lit room, filled with MEDICAL EQUIPMENT, 
      HAROLD WATERS, long hair, rail thin, bangs a GORGEOUS BLONDE 
      against the wall. They both sweat profusely. Now, his PHONE 
      RINGS. She looks at him:

                                  HAROLD
                    Gotta get it. I m on call. 

      He checks caller ID, picks up:

                                  HAROLD (CONT'D)
                    Rush, my man!

      INT. EAST LA WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

      Rush, sweat pouring down his face, on the phone. Raoul stands 
      over him, holding the gun:

                                  RUSH
                    Listen, I need some help.

                                  HAROLD (O.S.)
                    What you need, brother?

                                  RUSH
                    I need blood.

        INTERCUTTING

      Harold pushes through double doors, revealing

      A CITY STREET. He was in the back of an unmarked ambulance. 
      He shakes his head:

                                  HAROLD
                    Why are you calling me? Call Ivan 
                    for that shit.

      SUPER:  5 Minutes Ago... 

      INT. CHEETAH S - NIGHT FLASHBACK

      Ivan, a burly, goateed Russian in ORDERLY SCRUBS, gets a LAP 
      DANCE. A STRIPPER grinds up against him:

                                  STRIPPER
                    You re vibrating.

      She reaches into his pocket, hands him the phone. He checks 
      caller ID: RUSH

      He sends it to voicemail.                                                                                    39.


                                  RUSH (O.S.)
                    He didn t pick up.

      EXT. LOS ANGELES STREET - NIGHT

      Harold lights a smoke:

                                  HAROLD
                    Wish I could help you, brother.
                          (beat)
                    You want blood, you gotta go 
                    inside.

      INT. EAST LA WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

      Rush hangs up, exhales. Julio s screams echo through the 
      warehouse. Raoul stands over him still, gun held high. Rush 
      rubs his temples, thinks.

      INT. CEDARS SINAI PARKING LOT - NIGHT 

      Alex Thomas sits in his station wagon, stares straight ahead. 
      In the distance, the ER entrance glows in the night.

      He looks in the mirror, steels himself.

      SUPER:  45 Minutes Ago... 

      INT. ALEX THOMAS  BEDROOM - NIGHT

      Alex, in bed, on his cell phone, hisses:

                                  ALEX
                    No way-- 

      His wife stirs next to him. Alex lowers his voice:

                                  ALEX (CONT'D)
                            (whispering)
                    No way, Rush.

        INTERCUTTING

      Rush stands there, sweating, gun to his temple

                                  RUSH
                    Please, man. Please. Have I ever 
                    called you with anything like this?
                          (no response)
                    No, I haven t. Trust me, I wouldn t 
                    be asking unless it were very, very 
                      important...                                                                                    40.


      INT. CEDARS SINAI BLOOD BANK - NIGHT (PRESENT)

      Alex, in scrubs, looks over his shoulder as he enters the 
      blood bank. Outside, through a glass partition, light 
      hospital traffic flows.

      In front of Alex, BAGS of BLOOD sit in a case, behind frosted 
      glass.

      Alex enters a CODE, unlocks the case. He pulls open the door. 
      His eyes settle on the bags of O NEGATIVE. He scans the room. 
      Mounted on the ceiling above: A CAMERA.

      CAMERA POV: Alex positions his body in front of the cooler, 
      shields what he s doing from the camera s view. He slides 
      something into his jacket.

      EXT. EAST LA WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

      Rush, flanked by two GANG MEMBERS, pops the trunk of his 
      Ferrari. It s filled with Pelican cases, leather bags, etc. 
      Rush slings a bag over one shoulder, grabs a case, looks at 
      the other guys:

                                  RUSH
                    That your friend in there?

      They nod.

                                  RUSH (CONT'D)
                    If you want him to live, you ll 
                    grab some heavy shit.

      EXT. CEDARS SINAI PARKING LOT - DAY

      Alex, wearing a HOODIE over his scrubs now, moves through the 
      ER entrance into the brisk night. Head down. Eyes up. He 
      passes Tasha, smoking a cigarette. She looks up,

      Just in time to see him get into his car.

      EXT. EAST LA WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

      Alex drags a COOLER across a parking lot--empty, save Rush s 
      car and an unmarked van. Far off in the night, a siren 
      passes. He approaches a corrugated metal gate, slides it 
      open, revealing the CARNAGE. 

      In the corner, 2 gangsters wrap a dead body in blankets, 
      sheets. In the center, Julio on a table, shirtless. Rush 
      preps him, DOUSING his stomach with DISINFECTANT. An IV Rack 
      stands next to them, along with a MOBILE vitals monitor. It s 
      the kind of equipment military doctors use in the field. 
      Raoul walks toward Alex, gun held high. His BOYS follow.                                                                                     41.


                                  RAOUL
                    Who the fuck are you?

                                  RUSH
                    He s with me--

      Raoul presses his gun to Alex s head:

                                  RAOUL
                    Open it.

      Alex s hands shake, as he opens the cooler, revealing 2 BAGS 
      of BLOOD atop dry ice.

                                  RAOUL (CONT'D)
                    Good.

                                  ALEX
                    I took it out of controlled storage 
                    19 minutes ago. You ve got 11 to 
                    get it into him.

                                  RUSH
                    Thank you. You can go now.

                                  RAOUL
                    Hold up. Not so fast. 

      Rush looks at Raoul:

                                  RAOUL (CONT'D)
                    Your boy s seen an awful lot to 
                    just go and walk away now. Nuh-uh. 
                    He stays  til you re done.

                                  RUSH
                    He leaves or this man dies.

      Raoul looks at him. Rush looks back, eyes steel:

                                  RUSH (CONT'D)
                    Try me.

      Raoul smiles:

                                  RAOUL
                    Fine. 
                          (to Alex)
                    Get out.

                                  ALEX
                    No.

      Rush looks at him:                                                                                    42.


                                  ALEX (CONT'D)
                    I m not leaving you like this.

      Rush pulls him aside:

                                  RUSH
                    You have a wife. You have a kid.

      Alex looks at Rush, angry, concerned. About to say something:

                                  RUSH (CONT'D)
                    Leave.

      And he nods, walks away. Rush watches him go. When he reaches 
      the door, Alex checks his watch:

                                  ALEX 
                    Nine minutes, thirty seconds, Rush.

      And with that, he s gone.

      EXT. EAST LA WAREHOUSE - SOON AFTER

      Rush, in scrubs now, works quickly, hanging ANASTHETIC, 
      FLUIDS, etc. on the IV UNIT. 

                                  JULIO 
                    I don t wanna die.

                                  RUSH
                    No, I would imagine not.

      He rubs alcohol on Julio s arms, jams TWO BIG IV s into 
      Julio s elbow joints...

                                  JULIO
                    I m a good man, doctor. I have a 
                    kid. A little 2 year old kid. I 
                    wanna see all the great shit she s 
                    gonna do in her life. Don t let me 
                    die, please. Don t let me--

                                  RUSH
                    Go to sleep, Julio.

                                  JULIO
                    Please. Pleeeease--I m 
                      a...good...man--

      And he s out.

                                  RUSH
                    Good men don t usually wind up in 
                      situations like this, ese.                                                                                    43.


      Rush checks his watch. It reads 2 MINUTES

                                  RUSH (CONT'D)
                    I need an outlet.

      Raoul, standing by, nods toward the back wall... Rush runs 
      the cord from his RAPID INFUSER (a device that warms the 
      blood prior to any transfusion) to the wall--

      Now, he opens Julio s mouth, intubates. It s a tube that runs 
      to what looks like a little scuba tank. A portable 
      VENTILATOR.  Rush drops to his knees, removes the bags of 
      blood from the cooler.

      He checks his watch. 1:14:00

      He hangs the bags of blood on the IV Rack, grabs the tube,

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                    OH MY GOD!

      Rush TURNS to the entrance, sees a MEXICAN WOMAN running 
      toward the OPERATING TABLE. 

                                  RUSH
                    What s the hell is going on here?

      The Woman THROWS herself onto Julio, copiously WEEPING.

                                  SONYA
                    OH MY GOD! OH NO!

      Rush looks at his watch. 00:24:00. He quickly connects the 
      blood tube to the IV...

                                  RAOUL
                    It s OK. It s OK--

                                  SONYA
                    It s not OK, Raoul! This is your 
                    fuckin  fault! 

      Blood starts running down the tube. Raoul pulls Sonya off. 
      Rush looks to her, flustered.

                                  RUSH
                    Who is this?

                                  RAOUL
                    Sonya. My sister.
                          (beat, to Julio)
                    His wife.                                                                                    44.


                                  RUSH
                    OK. Not a good idea to bring the 
                    wife of the victim into the 
                      Operating--
                          (looks around the 
                            warehouse)
                    Place--

      Raoul holds his sister in his arms. He glares at Rush:

                                  RAOUL
                    Just fix him.

                                  RUSH
                    Fine. Keep her away from me.

      Rush s tools are laid atop a PIECE OF CLOTH on a steel TABLE 
      behind him. He grabs the SCALPEL, CUTS into Julio s stomach. 
      Sonya SCREAMS. Rush grabs his head:

                                  RUSH (CONT'D)
                    Jesus. Listen, I ve got a wicked 
                    hangover setting in right about 
                    now, so can we keep the screaming 
                    to a minimum?

      Rush grabs a RETRACTOR, proceeds to OPEN Julio s stomach...

                                  SONYA
                    Oh my God. What are you doing to 
                    him?

                                  RUSH
                    I believe he s been shot in his 
                    spleen. I m going to take it out. 
                    You don t like it, I suggest you 
                    look the fuck away.

      Rush takes CLOSED SCISSORS, uses them to lift the STOMACH out 
      of the way. Beneath, he sees the SPLEEN. Blood spurts up: 

                                  RUSH (CONT'D)
                    Whoa.

      Rush moves in, applies pressure.

      The bullet s lodged in there. Rush eyes the artery that feeds 
      into the spleen. He grabs a clamp, clamps down upon the 
      artery. He ties the artery off, brandishes his scissors--

      Snip. He cuts it, and

      THE LIGHTS GO OUT.                                                                                    45.


                  RUSH (CONT'D)RAOUL
      What just happened?What was that?

      TOTAL DARKNESS. Save a whisper of sodium vapor street light.

                                  RUSH (CONT'D)
                    We blew a fuse.

      Raoul s silhouette moves up behind Rush. We hear the COCK of 
      a gun.

                                  RAOUL
                    Fix it.

                                  RUSH
                    Waving that thing in my face is not 
                    going to help.

      Raoul looks at him, helpless. Rush looks back.

                                  RUSH (CONT'D)
                    Please.

      Raoul drops the gun. Rush thinks quickly, then:

                                  RUSH (CONT'D)
                    I need everyone over here! Right 
                    now!

      Feet shuffle:

                                  RUSH (CONT'D)
                    OK, I need light: cell phones, 
                    lighters, anything you got. Let s 
                    go.
                          (beat)
                    Faster! Faster!

      The gangsters line up around the perimeter, hold up their 
      CELL PHONES, illuminating Julio... Rush drops to his knees, 
      starts sifting through his bag.

                                  RUSH (CONT'D)
                    Where s Manny--?

                                  MANNY
                    Me?

                                  RUSH
                    You. Here. Now.

      Rush grabs something from his bag. Manny approaches. Rush 
      holds up an AMBU BAG. He places the bag in Julio s mouth:                                                                                    46.


                                  RUSH (CONT'D)
                    I need you to breathe for him. Like 
                    this.

      Rush pumps the bag, in rhythm. Manny nods, freaked out. He 
      grabs the bag, takes over. Pumps in rhythm. Rush checks 
      Julio s pulse:

                                  RAOUL 
                    Is he OK?

                                  RUSH
                    I don t know. I m going in--

      Raoul watches, holding his breath, gripping Sonya s hand 
      tight. As Rush starts to separate Julio s spleen from the 
      surrounding organs, 

      Now Rush reaches in with both HANDS,

      Grabs the spleen. Pulls it out, places it on the rusty steel 
      table...

                                  RUSH (CONT'D)
                    A little more light please...

      Raoul steps closer, holding his cell phone above Julio s 
      chest, as Rush goes back in, REMOVES THE CLAMP--

                                  RUSH (CONT'D)
                    Keep pumping, Manny.

                                  SONYA
                    What s going on? Is he OK--?

      Rush doesn t answer. Manny still pumps the ambu bag, in 
      rhythm. As Rush manually checks Julio s vitals: heartbeat, 
      blood pressure, etc... 

                                  RAOUL
                    IS HE OK?

      Raoul looks at him...

      And Rush nods. Exhausted.

      INT. EAST LA WAREHOUSE - DAWN

      The pink light of dawn streams in now. Rush finishes SEWING 
      UP Julio. A quiet has taken over... Sonya sleeps sitting up, 
      atop a bunch of PALLETS.                                                                                    47.


      INT. WAREHOUSE - LATER

      Raoul nods, hands Rush a BRIEFCASE full of cash. The 
      Gangsters carry his equipment. Rush s face is worn. He won t 
      forget this night. His hands shake as he hands over two 
        prescription notes:

                                  RUSH 
                    ...And fill these immediately. If 
                    his condition changes at all, call 
                    my assistant right away...

                                  RAOUL
                    Doc-- you ever need anything, you 
                    don t hesitate to ask, aiiight?

                                  RUSH
                    I won t need anything.

                                  RAOUL
                    Well, if you do... I owe you.

                                  RUSH
                    You and me, we re cool--
                          (to Manny)
                    You owe me.

      EXT. EAST LA WAREHOUSE - DAWN

      The warehouse doors slide open. Rush squints into a bright 
      and brilliant LA morning. Rush walks. Just the sound of the 
      breeze, the birds, a few passing cars, 

      And the BEEP-BEEP of his keychain, as the Ferrari unlocks.

      INT. RUSH S CONVERTIBLE - MOMENTS LATER

      Rush slumps into the driver s seat, looks in the rear-view 
      mirror: bloodshot eyes, blood-flecked face, wild hair... He 
      reaches into the center console of his car, slides open his 
      secret panel,

      TOSSES A HANDFUL OF PILLS INTO HIS MOUTH.


                                  END OF ACT THREE                                                                                    48.


                                        ACT FOUR

      INT. SUNSET TOWER - RESTAURANT - DAY

      Euros, celebs, fashion editors eat a poolside breakfast in 
      bright LA sunshine. And Rush enters, weaving past all of 
      them. We hear silverware drop as he moves by. He s a total 
      mess, zonked out on pills, bloody shirt, etc. 

      Sarah sits, newspaper and coffee in front of her. She looks 
      up to see Rush. He sits down, puts his napkin in his lap: 

                                  RUSH
                    They make a great Bellini here. The 
                    secret is cherry juice--

                                  SARAH
                    I was just leaving.

      She s about to get up, when:

                                  RUSH
                    Why didn t you tell me?
                          (off her look)
                    I could have handled it--

                                  SARAH
                    Like you handled last night?

      Rush looks down.

                                  SARAH (CONT'D)
                    I m not one of your patients, Will. 
                    With them, you re a tourist. Not 
                    with me. I can t have you be that 
                    way with me. You never wanted any 
                    of the real stuff. You could never 
                    stomach it--
                          (beat)
                    It s OK. I get it now. I can t 
                    count on you like that. It s just 
                    not who you are.

      Rush looks at her, nods in quiet agreement. A beat.

                                  RUSH 
                    So it s gone? You re gonna be OK?

                                  SARAH
                    I m going to live a long and 
                    healthy life--                                                                                    49.


      But not with him. They look at each other. Both wishing it 
      could be different; both wishing he could be different. Until 
      Sarah closes her eyes,

                                  SARAH (CONT'D)
                    Take care of yourself, Rush.

                                  RUSH
                    You too.

      ...She gets up, looks back at him:

                                  SARAH 
                    I got the job, by the way.
                          (beat)
                    I think your email to the head of 
                      Pediatrics helped.

      Rush nods, stares straight ahead. A beat.

                                  RUSH
                    I think you d like Los Feliz. I can 
                    put you in touch with a realtor, if 
                    you d like. She owes me a favor. 
                    They ve got a great Farmer s Market 
                    on Saturdays. I remember you always 
                    used to like to get up early on 
                    weekends, and do stuff like that--
                          (beat)
                    Oh, and parking rules have changed 
                    a lot since you were here. So, you 
                    know, just make sure you read the 
                    signs carefully--

                                  SARAH
                    Will--

                                  RUSH
                          (beat)
                    I ll try not to bump into you.

      And she leaves him there, alone.

      Justin Timberlake s  Mirrors  rises on the soundtrack.

      EXT. 101 FREEWAY - DAY

      As in the beginning: Rush in the car, on the freeway, music 
      blasting, sunglasses on. Only this time, his face is covered 
      in dried blood and stubble. And the CD starts to skip.

      Skip. Skip. Skip. He ejects it, 

      And his phone rings. He picks up:                                                                                    50.


                                  RUSH
                    Can you install a fuckin  iPod in 
                    this car, please?

                                  EVE (O.S.)
                    You need to get to Red Cummings  
                    house--

                                  RUSH
                    What I need is a shower--

      INT. EVE S CAR - DAY

      She drives, phone to her ear:

                                  EVE
                    Now, Rush.

      EXT. STUDIO CITY MCMANSION - DAY

      Rush puts his car in park, gets out. Eve s already there, 
      leaning against her car. When she sees Rush, she goes to him:

                                  RUSH
                    What are you doing here?

                                  EVE
                    He said she was unconscious--

      Rush looks at her, moves to Red Cummings door, knocks. The 
      door swings open, revealing Red. Shaken, flustered. Rush 
      moves right past him, through the house. Red follows:

                                  RED
                    She wouldn t even look at me, Doc. 
                    She can t never look at me after I 
                    have a bad game.
                          (beat)
                    Damn,  why d she have to be like 
                    that, Doc? 

      RUSH POV: Past the KITCHEN, down the HALLWAY, into the 

      BEDROOM

      Where, Hannah lies on the ground, unconscious. Blood streams 
      from her head; her lip hangs off her face. Rush runs to her:

                                  RED 
                    I m telling you, Doc. She was 
                    saying all this crazy stuff-- 

      Rush opens Hannah s eyes, peers in. Red stands over, 
      concerned.                                                                                     51.


                                  RED (CONT'D)
                    She dead?

                                  RUSH
                    Close.
                          (beat)
                    She needs to go to a hospital.

                                  EVE
                    You want me to call?

      Red shoots a look at Eve:

                                  RED
                    Who the hell are you anyway? You 
                    the one talking to my girl? 
                          (beat)
                    She told me someone came to her. At 
                    work. That you? You the one who did 
                    that? 

      Eve looks down, doesn t answer. Rush looks at her. What the 
      fuck? His head is spinning. He tries to focus:

                                  RUSH
                    Red, I said she needs to get to a 
                    hospital. Immediately.

                                  RED
                    I can t have my business in the 
                    papers like that. I mean, can t you 
                    just see the front page of the LA 
                    Times tomorrow?

                                  RUSH
                    Listen, I know a guy--
                          (beat)
                    He s got his own ambulance service. 
                    Unmarked. He can be here in 20 
                    minutes. No one would know--

      Red stops, really thinking now:

                                  RED
                    And it can t touch me? You sure 
                    about that?

      Eve eyes Hannah s prone body, anxious:

                                  EVE
                    Will--                                                                                    52.


                                  RUSH
                    No one would know, Red. You have my 
                    word.

      Red thinks, then:

                                  RED
                    Fine. 
                          (beat)
                    Fine. OK.

      Eve picks up her phone, dials:

                                  RED (CONT'D)
                    Just so long as you keep my name 
                    out of it.

      EXT. RED CUMMINGS  HOUSE - DAY

      Eve sits in the back of the unmarked ambulance, next to an 
      unconscious Hannah. 

      Harold, from earlier, long hair in a net, wearing an EMT 
      uniform, straps her in.

      EVE POV: Rush, standing on the street. He peers in. They look 
      at each other.

                                  EVE
                    I was just trying to help.

      The ambulance door closes. Rush looks down.

      INT. RED CUMMINGS  LIVING ROOM - DAY

      Red counts out some money, on the coffee table. He s trying 
      to breathe slow now, calming himself. Rush stands over him, 
      trying to focus. His face blank.

                                  RED
                    Gave you an extra 10k, Doc.

      Red forces a laugh:

                                  RED (CONT'D)
                    You got me out of some deep shit 
                    this time, man...

      Rush nods. His eyes dart around the room. Avoids eye contact:

                                  RUSH
                    Just give me the money, Red.

      He does. Rush pockets it.                                                                                     53.


                                  RED
                    She ll be OK, though, right? And 
                    none of this, none of this is gonna 
                    come back to me, right?

      Rush speaks through clenched teeth, anger building:

                                  RUSH
                    I m leaving now, Red.

      And he turns, starts to walk. Red nods, jittery:

                                  RED
                    Right. Right. You should go. Thanks 
                    again--  
                          (beat)
                    I can always count on you, Doc.

      Rush freezes.

                                  RUSH
                    What?

                                  RED
                    I said, I can always count on you. 
                    Thank you.

      Next to the front door, Red s SOUVENIR BAT hangs on the wall. 
      Rush eyes it. 

                                  RED (CONT'D)
                    Doc?

      Rush grabs the bat, turns around. He moves to Red, 

      SLAMS THE BAT INTO RED S FACE.

      Red collapses to the ground. Rush HITS him in the stomach... 
      On TV, a commercial for CAT FOOD. Rush CRACKS the bat into 
      Red s rib cage. He slams it into Red s knee. It s quick, 
      brutal.

      On the ground, Red bleeds, clutches his leg, crying. Rush 
      looks down at him:

                                  RUSH
                    I ll call you an ambulance--
                          (beat)
                    Just keep my name out of it.                                                                                    54.


      INT. CEDARS SINAI - DAY

      Eve watches as Hannah s stretcher is PULLED INTO THE ER. Her 
      battered face recedes from view. And Eve looks after her, 
      desperate, lost...

      EXT. CEDARS SINAI - DAY

      Eve walks through the sliding double doors of the ER, just as 
      an AMBULANCE pulls up. EMTs and Triage Nurses hurry to it. 
      Eve turns, as the back door opens. And, there,

      RED CUMMINGS lying on a stretcher, wincing in pain. The EMTs 
      grab the stretcher, take it down the ramp. Where

      RED S EYES MEET EVE S...

      He looks at her. His eyes widen with recognition. And we PUSH 
      IN ON  Eve, as she puts it all together. A look of 
        satisfaction crosses her face...

      INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - LATER

      Alex Thomas walks down the hallway, holding a coffee, 
      consulting a clipboard. Tasha, the nurse from earlier, walks 
      by him:

                                  TASHA
                    Dr. Thomas?

      He stops, they move to the side:

                                  TASHA (CONT'D)
                    Dr. Rothstein was asking to talk to 
                    you--
                          (beat)
                    Some blood went missing from the 
                    blood bank yesterday. Guess they 
                    thought you might know something 
                    about it--

      Alex nods through gritted teeth, says nothing.

                                  TASHA (CONT'D)
                    Don t worry, I covered for you.

      He exhales.

                                  TASHA (CONT'D)
                    I know you wouldn t do something 
                    like that. 
                          (beat)
                    Not unless you had a good reason.                                                                                    55.


                                  ALEX
                    No. No, I wouldn t.
                          (beat)
                    Thank you, Tasha.

      She smiles:

                                  TASHA
                    Anytime, Doctor.

      INT. EVE S PRIUS - DAY

      Eve sits in traffic, staring miles into the distance. Her 
      PHONE RINGS. She picks up...

        INTERCUTTING

      Rush, in his car:

                                  EVE (O.S.)
                    Hey.

                                  RUSH
                    Hey.
                          (beat)
                    Look, if we re going to continue 
                    this, you have to understand 
                      something:
                          (beat)
                    What I do is complicated. It s not 
                    about feelings. It s not about 
                    wrong or right or good or bad. I m 
                    not Patch Adams, Eve. We cannot 
                    care, OK? 

                                  EVE
                    I know, Rush. I know.

                                  RUSH
                    We don t give a shit.

                                  EVE
                    I got it.

                                  RUSH
                    Good. It s important.

      A beat. And Eve smiles:

                                  EVE 
                    By the way, I just heard on the 
                    radio, Red Cummings is out for the 
                    season--                                                                                    56.


      INT. RUSH S CONVERTIBLE - PRESENT

      Rush pulls to a stop in the CEDARS SINAI PARKING LOT.

                                  RUSH
                    Probably for the best. He was 
                    having a shitty year.

                                  EVE
                    You know, Rush, if we followed your 
                    rules, we never would have met.

                                  RUSH
                    You were an exception.

      A silent beat of understanding, followed by:

                                  EVE
                    Rush, this may not be the time,  
                    but--
                          (beat)
                    Billy Bloom never paid.

      Rush s face turns red. Through gritted teeth:

                                  RUSH 
                    It s under control.

      EXT. BILLY BLOOM S POOL - DAY

      Billy, in swimming cap and goggles, swims laps in his pool.

      Suddenly, 4 pairs of Timberlands step into foreground, 4 
      pairs of baggy jeans...

      Raoul and his men. 

      BILLY POV: Rising up from beneath the water to see these 4 
      big badasses. He looks at them, knows he s fucked. 

      He gets out of the pool, saying nothing, just indicating with 
      his eyes, follow me.

      INT. BRENTWOOD MANSION - DAY

      Raoul and his men follow Billy into his bedroom. Behind his 
      bed, Billy reveals a HIDDEN SAFE. He locks in the 
        combination. Raoul scans the posters on the wall:

                                  RAOUL
                    Yo, you directed  Dead Bolt 3 ?

      Billy looks at him, proud:                                                                                    57.


                                  BILLY
                    Sure did.

      He pulls out several stacks of money, hands them to one of 
      Raoul s men. Raoul smiles.

                                  RAOUL
                    That movie sucked. I want my money 
                    back.

                                  BILLY
                      Everybody s a critic.

                                  RAOUL
                    No, really. I want my money back. 

      And Raoul scans the room. He settles upon the Rothko.

      EXT. BRENTWOOD MANSION - DAY

      Raoul and his men walk to their Escalade. One of his boys 
      holds the Rothko.  Raoul gives it a sideways glance, as he 
      stuffs some bills into his pocket:

                                  RAOUL
                    My sister s gon  flip. She loves 
                    art.

      INT. POST-OP - DAY

      Hannah lies in a bed, bandaged, unconscious. A shell. 

      And, next to her, Will Rush slumps in a straight-backed 
      chair. He stares at her. He breathes heavy. This isn t easy. 
      His heaving breaths mingle with the rhythmic beep of the 
      heart monitor. We move closer, closer--right into his eyes. 
      Something new flickers there. Sympathy perhaps.

      Now, Hannah s eyes flutter. They turn slowly to Rush, who 
      sits up straight, as though he s been caught. Their eyes meet 
      there, for a moment--

      Until Rush gets up, turns, walks away--

      Past ROW AFTER ROW OF PATIENTS, their families. The CORONER 
      rolls a BODY BAG right past him. And Rush strides forward, 
      pushing himself, forcing himself, opening himself to their 
      pain. A hint of a bittersweet smile on his face. 

      EXT. CEDARS SINAI HOSPITAL - DAY

      Rush strides through the sliding double doors. He spots a 
      RAGGED MAN sitting on the curb. He walks to him, holds out 
      his hand. In it, a $20.                                                                                     58.


                                  RUSH
                    Here.

      The RAGGED MAN takes the money, looks at Rush, who s moved on 
      into the parking lot:

                                  RAGGED MAN
                    I m not homeless.

      Rush freezes, turns around,

      Snatches the $20 back. 

      INT. RUSH S CAR - CONTINUOUS

      Rush drops into the front seat of his car, as his phone 
      VIBRATES. He reaches into his pocket, checks it. 

      1 TEXT MESSAGE. From RAOUL. 

      TOOK CARE OF IT. NOW YOU OWE ME.

      Rush lingers on that message for an extended beat. Finally, 
      he exhales, tosses the phone onto the passenger seat, fires 
      up the Ferrari s V-12. And Crosby, Stills and Nash s 
       Helplessly Hoping  rises on the soundtrack.

      EXT. MULHOLLAND DRIVE - DAY

      Rush s Ferrari crests a hill. Los Angeles looms below him. 
      The smog hangs low, an orange-blue haze in the air. And his 
      CD starts to skip.
