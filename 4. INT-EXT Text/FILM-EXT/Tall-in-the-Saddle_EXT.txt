CLOSE SHOT -- station signboard. It reads:
"GARDEN CITY"
CAMERA PANS to show the dusty platform of a typical small
Arizona town of the late nineties.
CAMERA TRUCKS ALONG platform PAST a line of sleeping figures,
consisting of a couple of drunks, an Indian, two Mexicans
and a mongrel dog.
CAMERA STOPS on the window of the ticket office. Inside the
office can be glimpsed the Station Agent dozing in a chair
with his feet up against the grill of the ticket window. The
clicking of the signal indicator is heard. The agent opens
his eyes, flips up the indicator and begins to get to his
feet sleepily.
MED. SHOT
line of sleeping figures, with dog in f.g. The sound of a
distant train whistle is heard o.s. The dog, which up to now
might have been dead, opens one eye and looks past camera.

and runs out of shot past camera. The sleeping figures come
to life and look toward camera. At the same time, the door
of the ticket office opens and the agent appears.

railway track. The train is now almost at the station.
FULL SHOT -- with the line of men now standing on the edge
of the platform looking toward camera. Train steams slowly
in past camera, and stops, with a tall, wide-shouldered man
of about 28 (Rocklin), dressed in new store clothes, cowboots
and a broad-brimmed white hat, in f. g. standing on steps of
day coach with a small valise and saddle in his hands. Behind
Rocklin a conductor.

and waves to the conductor o.s. and begins to close the doors
of the baggage car.
MED. CLOSE SHOT
on Station Agent and conductors. The latter signals the
engineer. The train whistle sounds again o.s. and the shadow
of the moving train begins to pass across the Station Agent's
face.
TRUCKING SHOT
As Rocklin comes along the platform carrying the valise in
one hand and balancing the saddle on his shoulder with the
other, a man behind him picks up the two mail sacks and exits
from scene. The station bums look at Rocklin curiously. His
expression giving no encouragement, they slink back out of
the sun and begin to settle down in their old places again.
At the ticket office, Rocklin pauses and looks around
uncertainly.
STATION AGENT
(at office door)
Expectin' someone?
ROCKLIN
(after a second's
pause)
I guess not. Where's the stagecoach
office?
STATION AGENT
(pointing)
Back of the depot.
The stage is drawn up in front of the depot, over which is a
sign --
RED ROCK STAGE
J. Harolday Proprietor
Rocklin, making his way along the walk, almost reaches the
depot when his attention is arrested by the sight of Dave,
the stage driver, who has just rounded in front of the lead
horses. He pauses close to one horse's head. Rocklin sees
Dave take a bottle from his person, uncork it as he glances
around, and raise it to drink. The bottle is almost to Dave's
lips when the horse shies, swinging its head. The bottle is
knocked from the old fellow's hands and smashes on the ground.
Now Rocklin witnesses a scene of intense fury, which he finds
amusing despite its seriousness. Old Dave rants and snorts --
beats his thighs, his heads, flings his arms wildly and
exhibits his utter disgust generally.
DAVE
(to horse)
Consarn you, Blossom -- lookit that --
jus' lookit what you done --
(some more pantomime)
I'm tellin' you, Blossom that --
(indicating broken
bottle)
-- makes you the most aggravatin'
female as ever I had a despise fer --
I've got a good notion to pizen you --
an' what's more --
He stops talking abruptly because his hand has, quite by
chance, felt the spare bottle he carries, which he has
forgotten in his anger. A most satisfying smile lights his
bewhiskered face as he brings the bottle into view. He uncorks
it, and stepping a few paces from the horse, raises the
bottle.
DAVE
(to Blossom)
Heh-heh -- fooled you, didn't I? --
(chuckles)
Fooled myself, too.
ON ROCKLIN
who has been watching Dave's performance. He smiles his
amusement and now proceeds toward the stage office.
The Stage Agent, carrying a mail sack, and Rocklin come from
the stage depot and reach the stage as Dave is in the act of
climbing up to the driver's seat.
STAGE AGENT
Here's your mail, Dave --
Dave looks over his shoulder at the Agent and steps to the
ground, as Rocklin climbs up to the driver's seat.
ROCKLIN
(as he steps up to
the seat)
-- and a passenger.
Dave glares at Rocklin climbing up to the seat, and he is
about to order him down when Rocklin, now seated, looks down
at him and asks rather wistfully --
ROCKLIN
Mind if I ride up here?
Dave does mind, but his better judgment tells him to step
carefully in his attitude toward this stranger, who does
things first, then asks permission. His only answer to Rocklin
is a characteristic grimace which is eloquent enough. And
now Dave turns on the Agent, who becomes the target of his
pent-up wrath.
DAVE
Where's them wimmen?
STAGE AGENT
Up at the hotel.
DAVE
(yanking mail sack
from Agent)
Why ain't they here? -- This is the
stage depot, ain't it -- ?
(heaves sack into
boot)
Ain't it?
STAGE AGENT
You can pick 'em up there -- it's
only up the street --
DAVE
On'y up the street -- an' they cain't
walk it -- What's the matter -- don't
Easterners have laigs like other
folks?
Dave stalks around the rear of the coach. The Agent meantime
stretches himself up toward Rocklin.
STAGE AGENT
(so Dave won't hear)
Hold tight when you git in the
mountains, mister -- When he gits
riled you can hear the passengers
prayin' for miles.
Dave has climbed to his seat, and now the coach lurches away,
leaving the Agent shaking his head dubiously.
From the porch of the hotel. We see the stage approaching as
the hotel handyman brings a trunk and a couple of bags from
the hotel to the street. The coach pulls up and stops.
DAVE
(to handyman)
Whar's them wimmen? -- They waitin'
for you to carry 'em out?
Before the handyman can answer, Dave's attention is taken by
someone calling his name from across the street. Meantime,
an Indian squaw wobbles from the hotel with bow and arrow,
etc. Rocklin buys bow and arrow.
SADDLER
(as he comes to Dave)
Dave -- Dave -- tell Arly Harolday
her saddle ain't ready yet, will ya?
DAVE
(getting to the ground)
I ain't tellin' that crazy female
nothin' -- Last time I seen her she
threatened to rip the hide off'n me
and bat me dizzy with it.
Dave goes to the rear of the coach.
SADDLER
(looks up to Rocklin)
Mister -- will you tell the Agent at
Santa Inez to tell Miss Harolday her
saddle ain't ready yet?
ROCKLIN
(nods)
I'll say that.
PORCH OF HOTEL
Miss Martin steps out onto the porch followed by Clara and a
gentleman, presumably the hotel manager or clerk. The women
are obviously Easterners and are attired in the good taste
of the period. Miss Martin is a domineering woman, approaching
middle age. Her niece, Clara, is a well-bred, attractive
girl of twenty-one and completely under the influence of the
older woman.
CLERK
(as group comes through
door)
By next year, madam, we expect to
have a bathtub on each floor.
Miss Martin stops short and looks o.s.
ON DAVE AT REAR OF THE COUCH
having a time lifting the trunk up into the boot. Miss Martin
and the others come into the scene.
MISS MARTIN
Now don't drop it --
Dave pauses to see who is talking.
MISS MARTIN
At your age you'd best not be lifting
things so heavy.
DAVE
(grimaces)
Mebbe you're young enough to hoist
her up your own self.
(tries to lift trunk
again)
CLOSE SHOT
on Clara. She is looking rather timidly up at Rocklin.
CLOSE SHOT
on Rocklin. He is grinning appreciatively at old Dave. Now
he notices Clara and regards her soberly a moment.
FULL SHOT
Dave has heaved the trunk in place and is securing it.
Miss Martin, about to enter the coach, notices Clara staring
up at Rocklin.
MISS MARTIN
Clara!
Clara snaps her attention from Rocklin to her aunt. The Clerk
steps to the side of the coach and opens the door. He assists
Clara inside -- and now Miss Martin.
Dave, Rocklin and Clerk. Dave is at the moment climbing to
his seat on the other side of the coach. The Clerk swings
the door closed and looks up to Rocklin and speaks more or
less confidentially.
CLERK
Try to hold him down or he'll scare
the women to death.
ON ROCKLIN
He is looking down at the Clerk and answers quite casually,
but loud enough to be heard by the women.
ROCKLIN
I never feel sorry for anything that
happens to a woman.
On Dave and Rocklin.
DAVE
(mutters)
Wait till I get you on the road, you
old buzzard, you'll be surprised all
right.
He takes up the reins and shouts the team away.
DISSOLVE OUT
DISSOLVE IN
EXTREME LONG SHOT -- with the stage hardly more than a black
dot below, its curl of rising dust in the midst of the whole
broad expanse. As the coach disappears from shot, the two
mounted men appear riding at an easy pace and continue in
the same direction as the coach.
MED. CLOSE SHOT -- Dave and Rocklin, the latter staring
straight ahead. As they roll with the roll of the coach,
Dave steals a look at his companion.
DAVE
I wonder why a young feller who don't
have to wants to come into this God
danged country?
Rocklin ignores Dave's question and continues staring ahead.
Dave glances down toward the women.
DAVE
Say -- did you mean what you said
back there about wimmen?
ROCKLIN
(grimly)
Every word of it.
DAVE
(chuckling)
Then you're smarter than most.
ROCKLIN
Maybe I seen more of 'em than most.
DAVE
(looking at him
admiringly)
Shouldn't be surprised. Shouldn't be
a leetle bit surprised.
(reflectively)
All the same...
He breaks off and chuckles again.
ROCKLIN
(unsmilingly)
All the same -- what?
Dave doesn't reply, but lifting the pint of whiskey, jerks
out the cork with one movement of his thumbnail.
DAVE
(offering bottle to
Rocklin)
Take a slug.
Rocklin drinks and gives the bottle back to Dave, who all
but empties it in one pull.
DAVE
(holding up the bottle
and squinting through
it)
Whiskey and wimmen -- ever think how
much alike they are? Both fool you,
but you never figger out how to do
without 'em.
Rocklin makes no reply. Dave offers the bottle again.
DAVE
Take another.
ROCKLIN
Not just yet.
DAVE
(unoffended)
Well...
(putting the bottle
to his lips)
Here's to her.
ROCKLIN
Who?
DAVE
The next one that fools you.
He empties the bottle and shies it away. At the same time,
the coach hits a particularly bad patch of road and there is
muffled exclamation from inside the coach. Dave leans over
and looks down o.s.
Dave straightens up, grinning.
DAVE
(with relish)
Mighty rough stretch along here.
He whips up the team, at the same time weaving a little
unsteadily in his seat.
ROCKLIN
Like me to speel you a while?
DAVE
Nope. I've had a few snorts but that
don't make no difference. Leas'ways,
never has...
(after a second's
pause)
Don't ever git wore out, and useless,
like me.
ROCKLIN
Who're them as say you are?
DAVE
Harolday, for one. Oh, I ain't belly-
aching. Reckon he's entitled to his
opinion. But him and me never did
see eye to eye.
ROCKLIN
What's wrong?
DAVE
It's constitootional, I reckon. Like
that step-daughter of his is crazy --
he's too sane. Believes In law and
order.
ROCKLIN
(grinning)
What's wrong with law and order?
DAVE
Depends on who's a-dishin' it out.
Never was good at takin' orders
meself. As for the law -- well, you'll
soon find out what that means 'round
these parts.
The coach hits a particularly bad bit of road and there is
an exclamation from inside. Dave grins and urges the team on
cheerfully.

MISS MARTIN
Driver? Driver, what's the matter?
DAVE
Nothin'. Restin' hosses. Git out and
stretch yore laigs if you want.
MISS MARTIN
Resting horses? What for? I can see
with my own eyes it's downhill.
Dave brightens visibly at this challenge.
DAVE
You in such an all-fired hurry, lady?
MISS MARTIN
Certainly, we are in a hurry.
DAVE
(beaming)
Well -- we'll hurry some.
His whip cracks like a rifle shot and the startled horses
literally jerk the heavy stage over the rim and down the
grade.
LONG SHOT

narrow road and around the sharp bends.
CLOSE FULL SHOT
Dave and Rocklin on stage as it thunders downhill. Dave is
leaning out and listening hopefully for the outcries from
within. None come. Rocklin is hanging on with both hands and
mildly amused.

he were walking. Dave is more and more pleased with himself.
He again leans out to listen.

or interfere.

second, Dave pulls in the horses and negotiates the turn in

CLOSE SHOT

expects from the women within. The old lady's head bobs out
of the window.
MISS MARTIN
(fiercely)
Now what's the matter. Why are we
stopping again?
Old Dave's mouth drops open, and as Rocklin begins to grin
at his discomfiture.
DISSOLVE
FULL SHOT of lonely adobe which serves as a combination
roadhouse, stage station and bar. As the coach rolls into
f.g., a little Mexican boy (Pablo) runs out to change the
horses.
PABLO
(as Rocklin swings
down)
Buenas noches, senor.
ROCKLIN
Buenas noches, amigo.
PABLO
(grinning at the
friendly tone)
Ha llegado anticipademente, senor.
ROCKLIN
Tuvimos suerte en haber llegado.
He glances pointedly at Dave who is climbing down unsteadily
and Pablo bursts out laughing.
MED. CLOSE SHOT
on door of coach. As Dave comes into shot, Miss Martin's
head pops out of the window.
DAVE
(gruffly)
We stop here.
MISS MARTIN
Why do we stop here?
DAVE
If you wanta eat and stretch yore
laigs.
MISS MARTIN
Will you please stop referring to my
legs!
DAVE
You got some, ain't you?
He turns and lurches toward the roadhouse.
MED. SHOT -- coach as Rocklin moves toward it from the house.
A crudely made arrow shoots in and hits Rocklin lightly. A
warning hiss is heard o.s. and he turns quickly in the
direction of the sound.
MED. SHOT -- door of stable. The little Mexican who attended
the horses is peering out from the stable.
MEXICAN
(in a whisper)
Venga con migo, senor.
The kid disappears inside the stable. Rocklin comes into

STABLEMAN

ROCKLIN

Nope.

The two move out of shot across the road, followed by the
indignant gaze of Miss Martin.

Suddenly, there is the clatter of a horse's hooves and Arly
gallops into shot, forcing the mare up onto the sidewalk and
barring Rocklin's progress.
ARLY

Is your name Rocklin?
ROCKLIN
(coldly)
Yes.
ARLY
(contemptuously)
I want that money you took from my

Before Clint can reply, she wheels the mare and gallops out

Clint Harolday is seen at the window peering furtively toward
the Sun-Up Saloon. He suddenly notices something o.s. which
prompts him to say something which we of course cannot hear.
Now Garvey appears at the window.
Rocklin, FROM Garvey's ANGLE as he leaves the Sun-Up and

ROCKLIN APPROACHES - LOOKS THE PLACE OVER - AND ENTERS
ON Arly and Juan, mounted. They see Rocklin going into
Garvey's place.
Arly and Rocklin walking along the street, not far from
Harolday's office. Rocklin glances back toward Julio, who is
following a few paces behind them. He rides his horse and is
leading Arly's.
ROCKLIN
(to Arly, indicating
Julio)
Does he always follow you?
ARLY
(defiantly)
He's not following me -- he's with
me -- he's always with me.
ROCKLIN
(takes it mildly)
Oh -- just an old Indian friend.
ARLY
(straight at him)
The best friend I've got.
Rocklin nods, looks back again at Julio, then back to Arly
as they go out of shot.
LONG SHOT -- from stagecoach office window. The center of

As George Clews steps outside, a mangy mongrel dog, basking

down the middle of the street.

MED. SHOT
George, as he stands bewildered and open- mouthed. Rocklin
enters scene, suddenly whips out his gun and brings it
crashing down alongside George's head. The barrel strikes
though the crown of his hat and he goes down like a pole-
axed steer.
MED. SHOT -- Rocklin and crowd as they swirl around him
offering congratulations. Dave pushes his way through the
crowd and thumps Rocklin on the back in wild enthusiasm. At
the same time, the sound of a horse cantering is heard, and
Jackson comes into shot.
JACKSON
(to Rocklin)
Hey, you! What's this you been up
to?
ROCKLIN
I just laid a gun barrel over the
head of a drunk friend of yours --
same as you did over Dave's here
yesterday.
DAVE
(surprised)
Eh?
JACKSON
(blustering)
I don't know what you're talking
about.
ROCKLIN
(calmly)
You're a liar!
He turns contemptuously and begins to move back towards the
stage office completely ignoring Jackson, who rides alongside
blusteringly.
JACKSON
Now you lookee here, young feller.
You go on talking that way and you'll
find yourself in trouble.
The crowd which has been following now begins to razz him
openly. He turns and glares, but without effect. He gives a
final shout to Rocklin.
JACKSON
Don't say you ain't been warned.
Pulling his horse around, he sets off in a lope up the street.
MED. SHOT
as Miss Martin comes along the street, determinedly, followed
by Clara, until she is face to face with Rocklin outside the
stage office where Arly and Juan are mounted ready to move
off.
MISS MARTIN

I saw you. I saw you strike that
poor man.
ROCKLIN
Yes, ma'am. As hard as I could.
MISS MARTIN
You ruffian, you!
Clara pulls her sleeve imploringly.
MISS MARTIN
Let me go!
(to Rocklin)
I knew the sort you were the moment
I set eyes on you. You can't fool
me! You're nothing but a common
adventurer! Come, Clara!
She takes Clara by the arm and sweeps past them towards the
hotel. Rocklin looks after them with a grim expression and
then up at Arly, who has been listening intently. She returns
his look steadily for a second. Then, with a mocking smile,
she wheels the mare and canters out of shot, followed by
Juan. He looks after her for a second; then with the same
grim look, enters Harolday's office.
On Dave and Pap Fossler engaged in conversation in front of
Pap's store. In the b.g. -- across the street, we carry the
entrance to the Sun-Up Saloon.

talk)

call on me services. They's lots of
other folks lookin' fer a good man,

you better hurry and speak up because --
During Dave's speech Rocklin has come from the Sun-up carrying
his valise. He pauses a moment, looking around. Dave sees
him.
DAVE
'scuse me, Pap -- Be right back to
find out when I start.
He hurries across the street toward Rocklin.
On Rocklin just stepping off the curb. Dave comes in to him.
DAVE
Whar you off to?
ROCKLIN
I'm riding for the Topaz Ranch.
They start across the street, slowly toward the stage office.
DAVE
What! -- Have you gone plumb loco?
ROCKLIN
Good money -- sixty a month
DAVE
There ain't enough money in this
town to make it worth your while to
work for that gal.
Rocklin gives Dave a quizzical look, which Dave mistakes for
weakening.
DAVE
When she gits goin' she can be
meaner'n a skillet full o' snakes.
She ain't goin' to forget the way
you made a fool of her today -- in

PAP FOSSLER'S VOICE (O.S.)
Hey, Dave.
DAVE

It's pizen that's what it is -- jus'

Dave and Rocklin have reached middle of the street. Pap
Fossler's voice comes again from o.s.
PAP FOSSLER'S VOICE
Hey, Dave.
Dave reacts with a squint in Pap's direction. He runs out
toward Pap, but would rather stay with Rocklin. THE CAMERA

for Rocklin. A third horse is standing by with Rocklin's
saddle on it.
Rocklin, upon reaching the front of the stage office, pauses

Arly, Juan and Rocklin, with Miss Martin in F.g. The latter
scowls and looks quickly to her front as the riders draw
level with the buggy, Rocklin coining to the right, alongside
Clara.
CLARA
Good afternoon, Mr. Rocklin.
(looking at the sky)
Lovely day, isn't it?
ROCKLIN
Reckon it is pretty nice. So you're
moving in on the "K.C." eh?
CLARA
(hesitating and
throwing a look toward
Miss Martin)
We-el, not exactly moving in. You
see...
MED. SHOT
with Miss Martin in f.g. and SHOOTING OVER her shoulder to
include Clara and Rocklin.
MISS MARTIN
(acidly, locking
straight ahead)
Do you have to discuss our private
affairs with every rag-tag-and-bobtail
cow-person we meet, Clara?
CLARA
(in a low voice)
Auntie!
ROCKLIN
Sorry if I butted in, ma'am. Jest
passing the time o'day.
MISS MARTIN
We can do very well without it --
thank you.
(with a look over her
shoulder)
And you're keeping your lady friend
waiting.
Rocklin looks quickly in the same direction.
MED. SHOT
from Rocklin's ANGLE, with Arly and Juan at the fork in the
road. They are looking back towards the buggy which has taken
the lower road to the right of the copse.
REVERSE SHOT
with Arly and Juan in f.g. and the buggy in the distance.
Rocklin raises his hat to the women in the buggy and canters
back to Arly, who has been watching with a peculiar
expression.
ARLY
(coldly)
I thought maybe you'd changed your
mind again.
ROCKLIN
(cheerfully)
Nope.
She looks at him angrily for a second as if about to say
something sarcastic. Then, repressing herself, she wheels
her horse and canters off along the side of the copse. Rocklin
throws an amused glance, at Juan, who has been watching with
an enigmatic expression. He returns Rocklin's look with a
stern, menacing frown. Then, with a gentle flick of the rein,
he urges his horse after Arly. Completely baffled, Rocklin
scratches his head for a second, then follows.
DISSOLVE
MED. SHOT -- as the three canter up the driveway to a smart-
looking ranch house. Arly dismounts and throws her reins to
Juan.
ARLY
(over her shoulder to
Rocklin)
Juan'll show you the bunkhouse. I'll
talk to you about your duties in the
morning.
Before Rocklin can speak, she runs quickly up the steps of
the verandah and disappears into the house. Leading Arly's
Horse, Juan moves out of shot to the left of the ranch house
and Rocklin follows.
MED. SHOT -- as Juan comes into shot leading the mare,
followed by Rocklin. They both dismount and begin to off-
saddle.
ROCKLIN
How far is the line-camp at Table-
Top?
JUAN
Twenty-five -- thirty mile.
ROCKLIN
I'm moving out there first thing in
the morning.
(as Juan turns and
stares)
Boss' orders. Care to show me the
way?
There is a moment's pause. Then, what almost amounts to a
smile of relief, crosses Juan's face.
JUAN
I will show you.
DISSOLVE
LONG SHOT -- as Rocklin and Juan ride out from the ranch
through the early morning mist and turn off in the direction
of the distant line of mountains.
DISSOLVE
LONG SHOT -- as the two leave the open country and enter the
mouth of a steep and narrow gorge at the foot of the mountain
range.
MED. CLOSE SHOT
as Juan pulls up and dismounts, followed by Rocklin.
JUAN
(pointing ahead)
The trail is straight ahead. You
will find the cabin at the top.
(turning back to his
horse)
Adios, Senor.
ROCKLIN
(challenging, but
perfectly friendly)
Senor Romerez, it appears that you
do not like me.
For a second Juan does not reply. Then, as he speaks, he
takes a tobacco pouch from his pocket. Rocklin, his mind on
other things, does not take particular notice of the pouch,
but we cannot help notice the pouch ornament -- a steer's
head of hammered silver.
JUAN
(during the above
business)
Senor, that is true. I do not like
you.
ROCKLIN
Why?
JUAN
(extending the pouch)
Permit that I offer you a cigarette.
Rocklin shakes his head. Juan, having spilled tobacco in a
paper, now puts away the pouch and rolls his own.
JUAN
It is not your fault that your shadow
is black. But you will only bring
unhappiness to my senorita. I do not
blame you, but I fear I must hate
you.
He turns abruptly and mounts the waiting horse; then looks
down from the saddle.
JUAN
Adios, Senor.
He rides quickly out of the shot.
DISSOLVE
MED. SHOT -- as Rocklin forces his horse up the last few
feet of the steep trail at the top of the canyon, and pulls
up at the top of the rise with a look of amazement.
FULL SHOT - FROM ROCKLIN'S ANGLE
A rich meadow stretches ahead with a stream running through
it, and a cabin at the far end. Steep escarpments surround
the lush meadow land, making an idyllic scene. As Rocklin
comes slowly into shot with the same look of startled
appreciation on his face and begins to move toward the cabin,

LONG SHOT -- of Juan, as he canters across open country toward
the ranch.

wagon, which we now see is being driven by Dave. On the side
of the wagon is written: TRANSPORT & GENERAL FREIGHTAGE --
Pap Fossler and Sons. Juan canters into shot and pulls up
alongside the wagon.
DAVE
Hiya there.
JUAN
Buenos dias, Senor Dave.
(looking at name on
wagon)
You have found new employer, eh?
DAVE
Yeah. Haulin' freight for ole Pap
Fossler. Got a letter here for that
crazy galoot, Rocklin.
(with a little Wink)
From the little Caldwell girl. Seems
mighty took up about sumpin'. Made
me promise to deliver it personal.
(indicates letter)
JUAN
But Senor Rocklin is not here.
DAVE
Lordy -- he ain't quit already...
JUAN
(shakes head)
I have just accompany him to Table-
Top.
DISSOLVE IN
Shelley, a Negro servant of the Harolday household, is
discovered sweeping the front porch. Behind him we see Clint
open the door -- peer furtively out -- then cross the porch
to its edge when he looks o.s. as though searching for
someone.
Shelley, meantime, has noticed Clint, but goes right on with
his sweeping. His only reaction is a disparaging glance over
his shoulder.
CLINT
(turning to Shelley)
Have you seen Arly?
SHELLEY
No, suh, Ah didn't see Miss Arly
today, but Ah seed her las' night,
and she shore was mad.
To emphasize his point, Shelley puckers his mouth in a
whistle.
SHELLEY
Plenty mad!
Clint's face tightens as he anticipates what is in store for
him. Over the scene comes the gradually increasing sound of
a feminine voice, gayly humming the notes of a popular tune
of the period. Clint's strained features relax in a can-that-
be-Arly expression, while Shelley stops dead in the middle
of a sweep, and now both stare incredulously, o.s.
ANGLE
From their ANGLE we first see only the corner of the house,
while the owner of the voice approaches from the other side.
Now Arly comes into view, entirely oblivious of Clint and
Shelley watching her. She seems more attractive, in a feminine
way, this morning. It may be the skirt and blouse she is
wearing. Then again it may be the flower she is, even now,
adjusting in her hair. The presence of the two men suddenly
startles her. The song ends abruptly, while her hands fall
quickly away from the flower.
ARLY
As Arly moves toward the porch, Shelley snaps back to life
and resumes sweeping -- but furiously. Clint regards the
girl in the vague manner of the puzzled gent he is.
CLINT
(not too definitely)
'Mornin', Arly --
Arly is coming toward Clint.
ARLY
(pleasantly)
'Mornin', Clint.
She steps close to Clint, and he slowly backs up a step, for
he does not know she came up to him merely to pick up her
jacket lying on the ground near the step.
CLINT
(as Arly leans down
to pick up the jacket)
You must be feeling pretty good.
Arly straightens up with the jacket in her hand, and the
corner of her mouth curls in a faint smile. She turns now
and starts along the walk, and takes only a few steps when
Clint comes to her side.
ARLY AND CLINT WALKING
CLINT
(as he joins Arly)
Say, Arly -- about that poker game,
night before last, I ---
ARLY
(tossing it off)
Forget it.
CLINT
(did he hear correctly)
Forget it?
Arly pays no attention to Clint. She is looking o.s. and
stops walking.
Tala, on his horse, as seen by Arly. Over the scene comes
Arly's voice calling from a distance.
ARLY
(calling)
Tala.
Tala reacts to the call by heading his horse at a slightly
different angle.
ARLY AND CLINT
Arly is looking o.s. toward Tala. Clint is now eyeing his
sister up and down quite openly. She turns her head now and
catches Clint looking her over.
ARLY
(after a stilted pause)
Well --
CLINT
(with a perplexed
smile)
What is this? --
A gesture of his hand indicates the way Arly has gotten
herself up. That quick, Arly's hand goes to the flower in
her hair. And, that quick, she guiltily withdraws it.
ARLY
(bravely nonchalant)
What do you mean?
CLINT
What do I mean? --
Before he can explain, Tala pulls up in his horse and we
hear his voice over the scene.
TALA'S VOICE
Good morning, Arliete.
ARLY, TALA AND CLINT
Tala sitting astride his horse smiles down at the girl.
ARLY
Good morning, Tala.
TALA
You have make yourself very pretty
today.
Arly is jolted by Tala's innocent remark, and she can't help
giving Clint a little side glance in the way of reaction.
Clint has not missed Tala's crack nor Arly's glance, and
when she gives it to him he says:
CLINT
(pleasantly)
See what I mean?
He tosses her an altogether knowing look now, and leaves,
going up the walk toward the house. Arly turns to Tala.
ARLY
Have my horse saddled and sent around
right away -- will you?
(then as a casual
afterthought)
You can have that Rocklin bring it.
She glances over her shoulder toward Clint going up the walk.
And then, looking back to Tala, finds he hasn't moved, but
remains smiling down at her.
ARLY
What's the matter?
TALA
(easily)
Rocklin is not here.
ARLY
(breathlessly)
He quit?
TALA
He has gone to the line camp at Table
Top.
ARLY
What?
TALA
It was Mr. Harolday's orders.
Arly looks away. Her eyes stare blankly into space as she
struggles with the mixed emotions of anger and disappointment.
Tala, aware of her plight, slowly dismounts and comes to the
girl's side.
TALA
(in a fatherly manner)
Why do you make your heart heavy
with thoughts of him, little one. --
He is not for you.
ARLY
(bitterly)
Be quiet.
TALA
He has made the choice, Arliete.
With your own eyes you saw it
yesterday.
ARLY
(impatiently)
Oh --
TALA
And she, too, has opened her heart
to him -- Already she has summoned
him to her.
ARLY
(this turns her around)
What do you mean?
TALA
Dave -- of the white beard -- carries
a letter to Rocklin -- It is from
her.
ARLY
How do you know that?
TALA
I have just now met Dave, and he
tell me. -- So now he rides to Table
Top.
Arly is quiet a moment.
TALA
Little one you --
ARLY
(quickly, as she starts
for the house)
Oh, leave me alone.
LONG SHOT
entrance to ranch. Entering the driveway from the direction
of Santa Inez, comes Harolday, still looking the distinguished
citizen.
HAROLDAY RIDES UP TO THE PORCH - CLOSE TO ARLY AND JULIO
HAROLDAY
Good morning, Julio -- morning Arly.
(to Julio as he
dismounts)
Fetch my briefcase -- it's on my
desk.
Julio exits.
HAROLDAY TURNS HIS ATTENTION TO ARLY WHO
still smarting under the disappointment about Rocklin, seems
lost in thought. After regarding her a moment Harolday speaks.
HAROLDAY
Looks like we're going to get that
land we've been wanting along the
river bottom.
Arly turns her eyes on Harolday, who continues.
HAROLDAY
I didn't tell you -- but I bought
the mortgage on the Hardman ranch,
and it's due today -- On my way over
there now.
Arly's eyes burn as she tosses her head slightly.
ARLY
Did you send that Rocklin to Table-
Top?
HAROLDAY
I did.
ARLY
(furiously)
Well, let's get things straight.
This place was my mother's -- now
it's mine and Clint's -- It's true
you've been helping out -- but the
way things are going we'll soon be
able to pay you back every penny we
owe. Meanwhile, I'm running this
outfit and I expect to give the
orders.
HAROLDAY
You generally do.
ARLY
Why did you send Rocklin up to Table-
Top?
HAROLDAY
It seemed to me a good idea -- what
with all this rustling going on --
ARLY
Who'd ever try driving cattle over
Table-Top? -- Unless they were crazy.
HAROLDAY
(coldly)
I don't agree with you. In any case --
if you must have it -- I'd no
intention of engaging a man at
foreman's wages just to gratify the
whims of a jealous woman!
ARLY
(dangerously)
You take care what you're saying.
HAROLDAY
(very controlled)
It's you should take care, my dear.
I'm afraid there's one man you can't
rawhide into jumping the way you
want. You've made a fool of yourself
over him once. Better watch out you
don't do it again.
He turns abruptly and walks off the verandah.
MED. SHOT
as Harolday comes from the verandah to his horse. Juan is
standing there with the briefcase which Harolday takes with
a yank, mounts his horse and rides out.
The CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE on Arly, who stands in furious

Old Dave is jogging along in his wagon. A rumble of thunder
echoes through the canyon. Dave reacts with a look toward
the sky.

of storm clouds gathering.
DISSOLVE
A night shot of the mountain road near Table-Top. It is a
wooded section of the plateau, and occasional flashes of
lightning illuminate the big trees skirting the road. Dave,
in his wagon, looms out of the b.g., and as he nears the
camera we hear him urging the team through the downpour. As
he passes and continues hurriedly on his way, we
FADE OUT
FADE IN
Rocklin and Dave stand close to the cabin, just clear of the
door, tensely scanning the surrounding darkness.
Water can be heard dripping from the cabin roof, and an owl
hoots in a near-by tree.
The sound of neighing horses comes from the direction of the
corral. Both men re-act.
DAVE
My team.
Almost immediately the neighing is repeated, but this time
from another direction entirely -- and from a distance.
ROCKLIN
That's not your team.
He moves to the corner of the cabin, followed by Dave.
HORSE IS STOMPING NERVOUSLY
and now it starts away, galloping through the deep grass at
the edge of the clearing. Only the lower part of the animal
is seen, along with the legs of the rider.
ROCKLIN AND DAVE HEAR THE SOUND OF RETREATING HOOF BEATS
And they can barely make out their quarry riding hell-bent
toward the deep blackness of the trees.
Rocklin fires and runs out into the moonlight in the clearing --
Dave close behind.
Rocklin halts -- fires again -- and again. Dave fires.
The mysterious rider is now swallowed by the night.
Dave starts after him again. Looking back, he sees Rocklin
has not moved.
DAVE
Come on --
ROCKLIN
No use -- he's gone.
DAVE
Mebbe we winged him.
He starts through the wet grass alone. Rocklin turns back
toward the cabin.
DAVE - PLOUGHING THROUGH THE GRASS
He has reached the edge of the clearing where a slight
embankment leads to the level of the trees. He is just
starting up to higher ground when his eyes catch something
on the embankment, shining in the moonlight. It proves to be
a tobacco pouch bearing a steer's head of hammered sliver.
It is dry, so has evidently just been dropped. Dave pockets
it, and proceeds warily along the mystery rider's trail.
ROCLKLIN - WHO HAS JUST ABOUT REACHED THE CABIN
He looks back in Dave's direction, and then looking toward
the cabin, suddenly stops and tenses.
THE CABIN DOOR IS PARTLY OPEN
and through it Rocklin can plainly see an indistinct form
moving in the faint glow of the dying fire.
ROCKLIN DRAWS HIS GUN AND MOVES STEALTHILY TOWARDS THE CABIN
DOOR
Rocklin is headed for the corral as Dave catches up to him.
DAVE
(glancing back to the
cabin)
Fer a man who's got a despise fer
wimmin, you sure do get all snaggled
up with 'em.
LONG SHOT -- of Rocklin as he comes riding into town. As he
nears the corner where the stage and Harolday's office is
situated, the CAMERA MOVES IN, getting Rocklin and one of
the Harolday employees repairing the wooden sidewalk near
the hitching rail.
ROCKLIN
(as he dismounts)
You work for Harolday?
The man nods.
ROCKLIN
Here's one of his horses -- I'll
pick up my saddle later.
He enters the building.
MED. SHOT from office window. Clint is hurrying across from
the direction of the Sun-Up Saloon toward the office.
The sound of breaking glass attracts the attention of passers-
by, as well as Miss Martin seated in her surrey with Sammy,
the K.C. China-boy.
Dave pulls up in his wagon.
Rocklin and Dave as they walk from Garvey's office. Dave has
a time hopping along against Rocklin's strides.
DAVE
-- Find out who owns that tobaccy
pouch yet?
ROCKLIN
(staring straight
ahead)
No -- but get hold of Clint Harolday.
DAVE
Clint -- Is he in on it?
ROCKLIN
Can't say for sure -- Bring him to
the Sun-Up, and don't take no for an
answer.
Dave leaves and exits from shot in the direction of the stage
office. Rocklin goes off toward the Sun-Up.
PANNING SHOT. Juan is lounging against the corner of the
building, soberly watching Rocklin's approach. As Rocklin
comes into the scene he spots Juan, and stops a moment as
though deciding whether or not to question him. During this,
Juan casually takes his ornamental tobacco pouch from his
pocket and begins to roll a cigarette.
The CAMERA PANS Rocklin to the side of the building and up
the outer stairs.
ON Clara hurrying toward the front door in a suppressed state
of excitement. She has presumably just arrived at the ranch
in advance of Miss Martin. She enters the house after a glance
toward the gate.
Garvey comes from around the building's corner and peers
furtively through the darkness toward the lighted windows of
Rocklin's room.
The area in front of the Sun-Up. Dave's wagon pulls up to
the hitching rail in front of the saloon. Clint, stripped of
his gun, is driving with Dave, alertly watching him. They
get down from the wagon and Dave prods Clint toward the corner
of the building.
Garvey has left the spot where we saw him look up to Rocklin's
window. We now see him as he rounds a rear corner of the
building and goes toward the outer stairs leading to the Sun-
Up's second floor. He starts up the steps and stops almost
immediately and stares o.s.
ANGEL
From Garvey's ANGLE as he sees Dave bringing Clint from around
in front of the building toward the stairway.
CAMERA HOLDS
Garvey steps quickly to the ground and takes up a position
around the roar corner. He watches the two men approach the
stairway and go up. He moves out of the shot now, going toward
the street. The CAMERA HOLDS on the corner, and we see Tala
come into view, as though from nowhere, and take the exact
position at the building's corner vacated by Garvey only a
moment before. It is apparent that he is watching Garvey,
and after a momentary pause he too moves stealthily out of
the scene.
An unidentifiable form is seen moving through the darkness
toward the outer stairway. As it nears the stairway, the
CAMERA MOVES IN so that as the mysterious figure begins
stealthily up the stairs, we see only the feet through the
rungs.
The CAMERA THEN PANS QUICKLY AND ZOOMS INTO A CLOSE SHOT of
Juan, across the alley. And now through Juan's eyes we watch
the ascent of the mysterious intruder: The Mexican's line of
vision gradually raises, then the eyes slowly move across
the camera as the dark figure proceeds along to the rear
portion of the verandah.
The mysterious form has moved past the darkened windows along
the verandah and is nearing Rocklin's lighted room -- stops
close to the open window.
Rocklin, as he picks himself off the ground, having dropped
from the verandah. He starts quickly away.
SHOOTING INTO the room, we see Arly and Dave shoved to one
side by Jackson and Garvey. The window goes up and Jackson
steps out, followed by Garvey, Harolday, Arly, Dave, and
others.
The hitching rail in front of the Sun-Up. There are a dozen
or so horses tied up to it and close to it is Dave's team
and wagon. Rocklin comes from around the corner of the
building and races to the hitching rail.
TOP OF OUTSIDE STAIRS
Jackson and Garvey come from around the corner of the porch
followed by Harolday, Arly, Dave, and others. At the stairs
they collide with some of the men who have raced down the
hall, only to reach the stairway at the same moment. There
is another jam on the landing as the mob all try to get down
at once.
ROCKLIN AT THE HITCHING RAIL
He has cut the lines of the horses tied to the rail. We see
him cutting the last line and fire into the air. The horses
rare and stampede.
THE MOB - WITH JACKSON AND GARVEY LEADING - COME FROM AROUND
THE BUILDING
And now there is a state of utter confusion as the mob and
horses rush in all directions as the men try to retrieve
their mounts. Rocklin is no where in evidence.
GARVEY AND JACKSON - AS HAROLDAY JOINS THEM NEAR DAVE'S WAGON
HAROLDAY
(sarcastically)
Well, Sheriff -- you certainly are
to be congratulated.
JACKSON
(harassed)
Look, Mr. Harolday -- you saw what
happened --
GARVEY
(deeply concerned)
Never mind that -- Let's get going
for Garden City -- that's where he's
headed for.
HAROLDAY
You sure?
GARVEY
I'm positive.
Dave climbs into his wagon behind the group as Jackson exits
quickly.
At hitching rail. There are four or five horses tied up here.
Arly and Juan enter and mount their horses, and almost
immediately Garvey and Harolday come hurrying into the scene
after two of the other horses.
ARLY
(shouts from her horse)
Where do you think he's gone?
Before either of the two men can answer, Jackson's voice is
heard shouting o.s.
JACKSON'S VOICE
All right, men -- follow me --
The CAMERA PANS AROUND, getting Jackson, now mounted, as
others come riding in. He rares his horse around and starts
away followed by the mob, including our principals. They do
not get very far when Dave's wagon comes into the shot, going
hell-bent in pursuit.
The posse riding hard, with Dave's wagon following.
CLOSE SHOT
Dave, half standing as he urges his team on. Behind him are
the closed flaps of the wagon top.
WIDER ANGLE
as a hand reaches out from between the flaps and grasps the
reins. Dave takes it, and looks wildly around -- falls back
on the seat.
ON ROCKLIN - AS HIS HEAD COMES FROM BETWEEN THE FLAPS
CAMERA PULLS BACK to include Dave, smiling broadly. Rocklin
is pulling hard on the reins.
DAVE
I mighta knowed you'd do somethin'
like this.
(as Rocklin slows the
team)
What are we doin'?
ROCKLIN
Headin' for the K.C.
With that Rocklin starts swinging the team around.
ON THE WAGON AS IT SWINGS AROUND AND BECOMES LOST IN THE
DISTANT NIGHT
WIPE
A raspy voice is heard coming out of the darkness singing a
ribald song of the periods. And now Old Zeke, riding his
burro, comes into view. As he passes close to the camera, we
PAN and get the posse coming out of the darkness in the
opposite direction Zeke is travelling.
As the posse pulls up to Zeke, the CAMERA MOVES IN on a group
including Zeke, Jackson, Garvey, Harolday.
JACKSON
Seen anybody ridin' hard for Garden
City.
ZEKE
Bin on the road since sundown --
ain't seen a livin' soul -- be he
man or beast.
JACKSON
He mighta taken the cutoff through
Jaw Bone Canyon.
HAROLDAY
After that storm? -- He'd never make
it.
GARVEY
There's only one other place he might
have gone -- the K.C.
JACKSON
You think so?
GARVEY
(very definitely)
I'm positive.
HAROLDAY
That's what you said before.
JACKSON
(shouting to the posse
milling around)
To the K.C., men.
The posse swings around and starts back toward Santa Inez.
ARLY AND JUAN
Arly watches the posse, then turns to Juan.
ARLY
(excitedly)
Take me through the canyon.
JUAN
It is dangerous, senorita.
ARLY
But if we get through we'll beat
them to the K.C.
JUAN
You would risk your life for Senor
Rocklin?
Arly does not answer in words. But Juan sees the answer in
her eyes. Now she tosses her head defiantly and swings her
horse off the road in the direction of the canyon. Juan
watches a moment, then spurs his mount after her, as we
DISSOLVE
ON the posse, riding hell-bent.
Arly and Julio, as they slowly pick their way along the
difficult trail, skirting a roaring torrent. Julio is leading
and close behind him Arly is having a time negotiating the
unsteady ground of a landslide.
ARLY AND JULIO AS THEY STAND CLOSE TO A DANGEROUSLY FORBIDDING
PORTION OF JAW BONE CANYON
She notices Julio staring o.s. and slowly shaking his head.
ARLY
Afraid?
Julio nods his head slowly, deliberately.
JULIO
Only for you -- you must not do this --
I will go through from here alone.
A faint smile of admiration brushes Arly's face.
ARLY
No, -- we're going through together.
Arly lashes her horse away. Julio realizes the futileness of
further pleading and now moves his horse out after Arly.
The wagon with Dave and Rocklin coming out of the night.
CLOSE SHOT
Dave is driving the team for all it is worth. Rocklin is
looking back. He turns to Dave.
ROCKLIN
You can ease up now.
DAVE
We're just about there.
WIPE OUT
WIPE IN
A wooden gate is swung closed across the roadway. On the
gate is a crudely printed weather-beaten sign: K.C. RANCH.
Over the scene comes the SOUND of the wagon approaching.
THE WAGON PULLS UP TO THE GATE
Rocklin hops out, opens the gate. Dave drives the wagon
through. As Rocklin lets go the gate, it swings closed of
its own accord.
The shed is a short distance from the Caldwell house. Bob
Clews is standing at a corner of the shed looking o.s. Over
the scene comes the SOUND of the wagon.
BOB CLEWS
(peering into shed)
Hey, George -- George, get up.
The wagon moving slowly through the cottonwoods, along the
drive not far from the house. It stops now, and the CAMERA
MOVES CLOSER to get Dave and Rocklin as they leave the team
and start stealthily toward the house seen in the moonlight
in the b.g.
Bushes near the house. George and Bob Clews are crouched,
watching.
GEORGE CLEWS
Come on --
They move out.
The posse riding hard.
We see Arly and Julio as they descend a steep embankment
toward the raging torrent. They both are riding Julio's horse.
CLOSE SHOT
Arly and Julio; Arly seated behind Julio, considerably
disheveled and sobbing.
JULIO
(comfortingly)
You are crying, senorita --?
ARLY
(lying bravely)
No.
JULIO
(knows she is)
It is too bad we lose your horse.
She was good horse, for sure.
ARLY
If only we make it in time.
As they move away into a longer shot, a huge boulder comes
crashing down the canyon side, across their path, and tumbles
with a great roar and splash into the torrent.
The posse riding.
Arly and Juan leave the hazardous trail behind and now start
across the flat on a run.
The posse riding.
Dave's wagon. Bob Clews is seen dumping Dave into the rear
of the wagon. George Clews stands near him with Rocklin's
unconscious form over his shoulder. Now he puts Rocklin in.
GEORGE CLEWS
Get our horses and meet me at the
gate.
Bob runs after the horses. George gets onto the wagon seat --
swings the team around and heads for the gate.
Arly and Juan riding hard.
George Clews sits in the wagon waiting for Bob, who now comes
out of the darkness with their horses. He dismounts, ties
the horses to the back of the wagon, comes around in front
to the gate. He is about to swing it open when he looks past
the camera at Arly and Juan, who now pull up to the outside
of the gate. Arly dismounts quickly, her gun in her hand.
Bob Clews backs up toward the wagon as Arly walks through
gate.
CLOSE SHOT
of Arly.
CLOSE SHOT
George Clews on the wagon seat. He is smiling and is going
to try to bluff it out.
GEORGE CLEWS
(to Arly)
What are you doin' with that gun,
Arly?
CLOSE SHOT
Arly.
ARLY
Get down from there before I show
you.
The horses tied in back shy as Rocklin falls to the ground.
Arly, as she takes it and starts toward the rear of the wagon.
BOB CLEWS - STANDING CLOSE TO GEORGE - WHO IS STILL ON THE
SEAT - SEES HIS CHANCE TO GET ARLY AND SLOWLY REACHES FOR
HIS GUN
He no more than gets it out when a knife whirls in from o.s.,
getting him in the small of the back.
JUAN
He sits calmly astride his horse, his gun leveled on George
Clews.
Arly is cutting the rope binding Rocklin.
ARLY
-- And they're headed this way and
should get here any minute --
Rocklin gets to his feet. Arly notices something shining on
the ground where Rocklin lay. She picks it up. It is the
tobacco pouch with the steer's head of hammered silver.
ARLY
Where'd you get this?
ROCKLIN
(taking the pouch)
That belongs to the man who shot at
me on Table-Top -- Dave found it.
Rocklin has come to George clew and we see him wrest the gun
from his hand and yank George down from the wagon seat. Once
down, he lets him have a hard right that sends him sprawling.
ON GEORGE CLEWS GETTING UP OFF THE GROUND AND ROCKLIN CLOSING
IN
They start fighting viciously. Arly rushes in crying wildly.
ARLY
(trying to stop Rocklin)
You've got to get away -- they'll be
here -- they'll catch you --
CLOSE SHOT
Rocklin. There is but one thought in his enraged mind --
Clews. He tears into him again.
ON ARLY AS DAVE JOINS HER
ARLY
(frantically)
You've got to stop him -- he's got
to get away.
THE FIGHT - AS DAVE AND ARLY FUTILELY ATTEMPT TO BREAK IT UP
ON DAVE AS HE GETS IN THE WAY OF ONE THAT SITS HIM DOWN
ON THE FIGHT AS ROCKLIN GETS IN A SUNDAY PUNCH THAT SENDS
GEORGE BACKWARD INTO A SHALLOW DITCH OUT OF SIGHT
ON GEORGE CLEWS LYING UNCONSCIOUS IN THE DITCH
The posse approaching.
Rocklin, Arly, Dave, Rocklin is about done in from the fight.
DAVE
(anxiously)
Come on -- let's git goin' --
ROCKLIN
(as he walks to wagon)
Where's the girl?
DAVE
Back at the house --
ROCKLIN
We've got to get her.
ARLY
You haven't time -- they're coming --
don't you believe me? --
ROCKLIN
(to Dave)
Come on --
Arly's plea goes unheeded and he starts away toward the house
on the run.
DAVE
(mutters)
Stubborn as an ole mule.
(shouts)
You're puttin' a rope around your
neck --
Dave runs after Rocklin.
ARLY AND JUAN - ARLY CLIMBING HURRIEDLY UP ONTO THE WAGON
SEAT
ARLY
Get him --
(indicates Bob Clews)
-- out of sight, and follow me.
She takes up the reins now and swings the team around and
off the road into the thickness of the trees.
Rocklin and Dave. They are approaching the house warily.
DAVE
(softly)
But what'll we do with the ole lady?
ROCKLIN
Anything you like.
DAVE
I'd like to pizen her.
Arly is seated on the wagon seat looking toward the gate as
Juan comes in on his horse.
ARLY
(pointing o.s.)
Look.
At gate. The posse rides up. The gate is swung open and they
ride through.
At wagon. Arly jumps to the ground and speaks to Juan.
ARLY
Come on.
As she starts toward the house, Juan dismounts and follows.
The posse comes riding in. Jackson, Garvey, Harolday, and a
few others dismount and go toward the door.
ARLY AND JUAN
as they move stealthily into a spot shielded by undergrowth,
which gives them full view of the front and one side of the
house.
At front door. Miss Martin opens the door, confronting Jackson
and the group. She is bewildered.
JACKSON
Evenin' ma'am -- hate to bother you
like this, but --
MISS MARTIN
(seeing Garvey,
interrupts)
I'm so glad you've come, Mr. Garvey,
the most awful --
(as though seeing the
crowd for the first
time)
-- Why -- what are all these people
doing here?
GARVEY
We're after Rocklin -- has he been
here?
MISS MARTIN
(smugly)
Oh yes -- here and gone.
JACKSON
What!
GARVEY
(astounded)
Gone --
MISS MARTIN
(triumphantly)
Yes -- the two men you sent out are
taking him and that horrid old man
back to town.
GARVEY
The Clewses -- funny we didn't see
them.
JACKSON
Somethin' musta gone wrong -- We
better fan out and see what's goin'
on.
MISS MARTIN
(quickly)
Don't leave, Mr. Garvey -- I've got
to talk with you, privately --
As all but Garvey and Harolday go back to their horses, Garvey
speaks.
GARVEY
But, madam --
MISS MARTIN
It's very important.
Garvey looks at Harolday in a manner evidencing his distaste
and impatience.
HAROLDAY
We'll go on and meet you in town.
GARVEY
Perhaps you'd better.
(calls to Jackson
o.s.)
I'll meet you in town, Jackson.
JACKSON'S VOICE
Right -- come on, men.
The sound of running horses comes over the scene as Harolday
hurries away and Garvey enters the house.
ON HAROLDAY AS HE GOES TO HIS HORSE
He starts to mount, but instead leads the horse into the
bushes close to where Juan and Arly are watching.
ARLY AND JUAN - WATCHING
Arly and Juan, as they watch Harolday approach the house and
go to the hall window.
At hall window -- on Harolday watching.
Harolday at hall window. He raises his gun -- he is about to
fire when a knife whirls out of nowhere and sticks in the
window frame, inches from Harolday's head. He spins around
and stares wildly here and there at the darkness.
GROUNDS AND BUSHES NEAR THE FRONT DOOR - FROM HAROLDAY'S
ANGLE
There is no one in evidence.
ARLY'S VOICE
Drop that gun.
ON HAROLDAY AT THE HALL WINDOW - STARING HARD - TRYING TO
LOCATE THE VOICE
He drops the gun. Arly and Juan come in to him. Arly has him
covered.
The CAMERA PULLS BACK to a WIDER ANGLE, getting the front
door as it is opened by Rocklin, who evidently heard Arly.
AT FRONT DOOR
Arly is prodding Harolday into the scene.
ARLY
(to Rocklin)
He was just getting ready to finish
you off, through that window.
On Harolday as he rushes madly across the clearing toward
the bushes where his horse waits.
The CAMERA SWINGS BACK to the porch in time to catch Julio
crossing it in pursuit of Harolday. Arly and Rocklin come
through the open door and stand on the porch watching.
THE BUSHES WHERE HAROLDAY'S HORSE IS HIDDEN - ARLY AND
ROCKLIN'S ANGLE
They see Julio disappear in the brush. For a moment nothing
happens; now Harolday's horse bolts out, riderless, and
gallops away. Now Julio comes slowly into view. He moves
slowly and deliberately back toward the house.
AT PORCH
Julio comes in to Rocklin and Arly. The three exchange
significant glances as we
DISSOLVE
Arly is seated on the shaft of an old wagon. The first rays
of the morning sun streak through the trees across her as
she smiles wistfully down at the antics of a little woodchuck
cavorting on the ground close to her. In a moment Rocklin
comes into view in the b.g. He spots Arly, who has her back
to him, and walks over. His approach frightens the woodchuck
away, and turns Arly's head toward him. Neither has anything
to say. Now Rocklin sits beside Arly, but faces the other
way.
ROCKLIN
(after a pause)
Thanks.
ARLY
For what?
ROCKLIN
Everything.
There is another stilted pause.
ARLY
(her eyes sweeping
the morning)
Beautiful day.
ROCKLIN
(reflecting)
It didn't start out so beautiful.
ARLY
That's true of lots of things.
ROCKLIN
Fer instance?
ARLY
(hesitantly)
Well -- you and -- me.
There is another pause. But worlds are being said in the
language of eyes. Their heads move closer and now Rocklin's
arms sweep around the girl and they kiss.
GROUNDS NEAR ARLY AND ROCKLIN DAVE AND JULIO HURRYING THROUGH
THE GRASS
DAVE
(shouting)
Hey, Rock -- Rock -- get out your
pencil and paper --
The two stop abruptly and look o.s.
ON ROCKLIN AND ARLY KISSING ON DAVE AND JULIO
DAVE
(grimacing)
Doggone it -- here Garvey is back in
this world -- an' they're out of it.
FADE OUT
