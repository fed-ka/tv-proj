Celia delicately prunes two rosebushes. Her long pink
fingernails wrap easily around a pair of sheers.
As Celia stands back to admire her work, We widen to see the
Foote estate. Ancient oaks dripping in Spanish moss surround
a perfectly manicured lawn. "Tara" pales in comparison.
Oddly, the two rosebushes have been planted in the center of
the lawn, jeopardizing the Antebellum Feng Shui.
AIBILEEN (V.O.)
Now, Miss Celia had her a man.
`Bout the best lookin' man in all
of Mississippi. But, no baby and
no friends.
JOHNNY FOOTE, 23, Celia's ridiculously handsome husband,
sneaks up behind her as he removes his jacket and tie.
17.
JOHNNY
Roses look like weeds next to you.
Celia turns with a yelp. She slaps him playfully.
CELIA
Johnny, you scared the daylights
out of me!
Johnny begins kissing her neck.
CELIA (CONT'D)
You're home early.
Celia pushes him back.
CELIA (CONT'D)
Johnny, I can't get any of your old
friends from school to call me
back.
JOHNNY
Oh, who cares, honey. We got all
we need right here.
Johnny kisses her again and lowers her to the grass.
CELIA
Johnny, honestly!
JOHNNY
Doctor's orders.
Johnny starts kissing Celia's breasts. She becomes uneasy
and rolls out from under him.
CELIA
I don't know what's taking us so
long. I'm sorry.
Johnny brushes hair from Celia's face.
JOHNNY
Hey, we've never done it in the
yard. Maybe that's the trick.
Celia seductively bites her lower lip.
CELIA
Watch my hair.
Johnny's hand slides up her thigh.
Skeeter speeds down a country road lined with ancient oak
trees in a white Cadillac.
AIBILEEN (V.O.)
I knew I had said too much to Miss
Skeeter, but Constantine's story
weren't mine to tell. Some things
a girl shouldn't have to know about
her own mother.
Her frizzy hair swirls about as she passes a truck full of
cotton.
Skeeter's car pulls into the overgrown yard of an old shack
with a rusted-out tin roof.
Two clapboard rooms are separated by an open breezeway. The
front door is cracked opened.
Skeeter gets out and walks toward Constantine's home.
Skeeter pulls in front of a grand antebellum home and parks
to the side of her family's graveyard.
Skeeter carries her black dress up the stairs of a covered
porch.
An old black man with white hair, JAMESO, 70, tightens a
porch swing.
SKEETER
Hey, Jameso.
JAMESO
Hello, Miss Eugenia.
Skeeter sits at a picnic table smoking a cigarette.
Constantine smokes tobacco out of a corn pipe.
SKEETER
I just couldn't tell her I didn't
get asked to the dance.
CONSTANTINE
Some things we should just keep to
ourselves.
Skeeter looks down to her long, bony legs.
SKEETER
I'm already taller than the boys'
basketball coach. How tall are
you, Constantine?
CONSTANTINE
I'm five-thirteen, so quit feeling
sorry for yourself.
SKEETER
Momma was third runner up in the
Miss South Carolina pageant.
CONSTANTINE
"Miss" what? Shoot, Child! You
gone be "Miss Something Better."
Constantine grabs Skeeter's hand and presses her thumb firmly
to her palm.
CONSTANTINE (CONT'D)
Now you listen. Your momma didn't
pick her life. It pick her, and she
done even know it. You gone do
something big with yours. Bigger
than your momma or your brother.
Constantine lets go of Skeeter's palm and wipes a tear from
her face.
28.
SKEETER
What about you? What did you want
to be, Constantine?
Constantine laughs.
CONSTANTINE
Oh, Child! We don't get to pick.
This pick us, and that just how it
is.
Tight on Skeeter's face as Constantine gives her a big hug.
Skeeter lies in bed staring holes into the ceiling as a
rooster announces the morning.
A sudden revelation washes over her. In a flash, Skeeter is
out of bed and running down the stairs.
Skeeter stands in her backyard facing Jackson. Cool winds
head toward the dark, swirling horizon.
In the distance, lightning strikes.
Celia leans on the porch railing, gazing helplessly as the
relentless hail storm pummels her two rosebushes.
AIBILEEN (V.O.)
God don't pay no mind to color or
class once he sets a tornado loose.
Within seconds, the rose blossoms are gone.
Aibileen uses the newly completed bathroom Hilly has built in
the garage. The walls consist of unpainted plywood with a
small window hugging the ceiling.
Beads of sweat glisten on Aibileen's forehead under a single
bulb hanging above.
AIBILEEN (V.O.)
Soon after, that bitter seed inside
of me had sprout and was growing
fast...
Well into her second pregnancy, Elizabeth exits the house
with Mae Mobley at her side. She wears an awful, homemade
maternity dress.
ELIZABETH
Hurry, Aibileen. Mae Mobley's up,
and I'm off to the doctor.
Aibileen reaches behind and flushes the toilet. Mae Mobley
gets excited and points to the garage bathroom.
37.
MAE MOBLEY
Aibee bafroom, Momma!
Mae Mobley walks toward the bathroom and calls out.
MAE MOBLEY (CONT'D)
Aibee?
Elizabeth grabs her and forces her down on the back step.
ELIZABETH
No!
AIBILEEN
Be right there, Baby Girl.
Aibileen pulls up her panty-hose.
Aibileen waits with YULE MAY, 45, as well as other maids and
black males at a bus stop. Yule May is tall, pretty and
graceful. Her hair is pulled tightly into a bun.
Skeeter walks down the sidewalk toward them. She and
Aibileen catch eyes. Skeeter waves.
Yule May inches away from Aibileen. One BLACK MAN in
particular looks with concern as Skeeter walks up.
SKEETER
Afternoon, Aibileen.
Aibileen nods nervously, looking at the other domestics.
SKEETER (CONT'D)
Can I talk to you?
A bus pulls up.
AIBILEEN
You got some "Miss Myrna" questions
for me?
SKEETER
No.
Yule May and others board. Skeeter grabs Aibileen's arm.
SKEETER (CONT'D)
Please.
Aibileen signals to Yule May to go on ahead without her.
AIBILEEN
Yes, ma'am.
The bus pulls away.
38.
SKEETER
Please let me interview you. I
know it's scary, but I really
believe this has to be done. We'll
be careful.
AIBILEEN
This already ain't careful, Miss
Skeeter. You not knowing that is
what scares me most. I'm sorry.
Skeeter hands Aibileen a piece of paper with her phone number
written on it. Aibileen turns and walks off down the
sidewalk.
Dark outside, Aibileen approaches another, more integrated
bus stop.
AIBILEEN (V.O.)
I know pretty well what happens if
the white ladies found out we was
writing about them. Womens, they
ain't like men. Women don`t beat
you with a stick. Naw, they like
to keep they hands clean. Got a
shiny set a tools they use, sharp
as witches' fingernails.
As Aibileen ambles toward a bench, TWO WHITE WOMEN in nurse
uniforms push in front of her and sit.
Skeeter sits at a long table surrounded by books piled high
as if to provide a shield of sorts.
Lying before her, is an old, thin, onionskin booklet curling
at the edges. It's titled:
"Compilation of Jim Crow Laws of the South"
Skeeter opens the booklet and begins reading.
AIBILEEN (V.O.)
Any person printing, publishing or
circulating written matter urging
for public acceptance of social
equality between whites and negroes
is subject to imprisonment.
Minny stands on Hilly's porch holding a chocolate pie.
MINNY (O.S.)
I cain't tell! I ain't tellin'
nobody! I done a terrible awful
thing to that woman. And now she
knows what I did!
Hilly answers the door and snarls at Minny. Minny presents
the pie and says "I am sorry."
Hilly waves Minny inside.
Wearing a black scarf over her hair and clutching her red
satchel, Skeeter approaches a small, one-story wood
structure. White paint peels, hydrangeas fill the yard.
Skeeter spies an old pickup truck parked on the side of
Aibileen's house, completely covered in years of dust.
Skeeter checks over her shoulder several times. The porch
steps creak under her big feet.
Aibileen quickly opens the door and waves her inside.
Skeeter turns a corner and sees Hilly leaning on her car.
SKEETER
Hilly? Do you need a ride?
Hilly shakes her head with little emotion.
SKEETER (CONT'D)
I'm sorry about the newsletter.
Hilly nods. A soft smile begins to form.
SKEETER (CONT'D)
With Momma being sick and-
Hilly erupts with excitement.
HILLY
He's coming! Oh, Skeeter, he's
definitely coming this time. This
Saturday night.
SKEETER
Oh, Hilly, he's cancelled twice
before. Maybe it's a sign.
HILLY
Don't you dare say that!
SKEETER
You know I won't be his type.
Hilly grabs Skeeter by the shoulders.
46.
HILLY
It's your time, Skeeter. And
damnit, I'm not going to let you
miss this just because your mother
convinced you you're not good
enough for somebody like him.
Minny steps off a bus and walks down an old country road.
MINNY (V.O.)
Number Three: When you're cooking
white food, taste it with a
different spoon. They see you put
the tasting spoon back in the pot,
might as well throw it all out.
Spoon, too.
47.
Minny approaches the Foote estate. She stops just short of
stairs leading up to the front porch.
MINNY (V.O.)
Four: You use the same cup, same
fork, same plate every day.
Minny takes her first step on the stairs.
MINNY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Five: Don't hit her kids. White
people do they own spanking.
Minny slowly raises her hand to knock on the front door.
MINNY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Six: No sass-mouthing!
Minny knocks.
MINNY (CONT'D)
(TO HERSELF)
Number six, Minny. Number six.
The door flies open. Celia Foote answers. She's covered in
tight pink clothes. Flour covers her face and hair.
CELIA
Hey there! I'm Celia Rae Foote.
Aibileen said you'd be on time.
Minny looks down disapprovingly to Celia's bare feet.
CELIA (CONT'D)
Can I get you a cold Coca-Cola?
MINNY
No, thank you. I'm Minny
Jackson... You...cooking
something?
CELIA
One of those upsidedown cakes from
the magazine. It ain't workin' out
too good. Come on in.
Hilly, Elizabeth and Jolene French stand with Hilly's
contractor. He unrolls a set of bathroom plans.
Hilly and Elizabeth look to Jolene and nod approvingly.
Skeeter pulls away in a rusted 1941 Chevy farm truck with a
huge motor grader attached. Charlotte runs next to the
truck. Her wig is askew.
CHARLOTTE
Don't mope. Remember to smile!
Skeeter floors it. Charlotte runs faster.
CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
And, don't sit like some squaw
Indian. Cross! Your! Ankles!
Skeeter leaves her mother in a cloud of dust.
CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
(SHOUTING)
I love you!
Aibileen and Minny continue their conversation while waiting
with several other maids at a bus stop in front of the store.
AIBILEEN
Lotta of folk think if you talk
back to your husband, you crossed a
line...need to be punished.
MINNY
You know I ain't studying no line
like that.
AIBILEEN
Cause it ain't there. `Cept in
Leroy's head. Lines between black
and white ain't there either.
Minny and Aibileen watch as Celia exits the store with her
groceries and prances toward her car.
MINNY
So, I ain't crossing no line if I
tell Miss Celia she ain't good
enough for Miss Hilly? Tell her
she ain't in Miss Hilly's league?
AIBILEEN
All I'm saying is kindness don't
have no boundaries.
Just then, MYRLIE EVERS, 30, (Medgar Evers wife) approaches
the bus stop with her three Children. SONS, 10 and 3, and a
DAUGHTER, 8.
Aibileen and Minny nod as the Evers walk past and sit on a
bench.
AIBILEEN (CONT'D)
Law, the Evers children have gotten
so big!
MINNY
(QUIETLY)
Cause they happy. Myrlie got her a
good man...And you better not try
to say they ain't no line between
her Medgar and my Leroy.
69.
AIBILEEN
No. You got me.
A bus pulls up and the doors open. Minny, Aibileen and the
other maids step aside to let the Evers family board first.
Aibileen has come along to aid Yule May with Elizabeth's baby
shower.
A table is set in the middle of the yard covered in white
linens and Hilly's best sliver.
Hilly's son sits on her lap. The other girls' children wear
bathing suits jumping noisily in and out of two plastic kiddy
pools.
Yule May clears cake plates while Aibileen removes crumbs
with a sterling crumb scraper.
Mae Mobley wanders up to the table. Her belly almost looks
distended crammed inside last year's one piece.
MAE MOBLEY
Mae Mo hungry, Momma.
Elizabeth turns to Mae Mobley but never gets up.
ELIZABETH
She's always hungry.
All the women laugh except for Skeeter.
SKEETER
You know she can hear you,
Elizabeth?
Elizabeth looks down to her plate. Aibileen sets down the
scraper and kneels down to Mae Mobley.
AIBILEEN
I'm on cut you some cake, Baby.
ELIZABETH
Aibileen, we gave that scraper to
Hilly and William for their wedding
present. Chantilly!
AIBILEEN
It so pretty.
Hilly begins bouncing William Jr. on her knee.
HILLY
Aibileen, are you enjoying your new
bathroom over at Elizabeth's?
Hilly nods with a tight smile and glances to the ground at
Skeeter's red satchel.
70.
HILLY (CONT'D)
Nice to have your own, isn't it?
AIBILEEN
Yes, ma'am.
HILLY
Separate but equal. That's what
Ross Barnett says, and you can't
argue with the Governor.
SKEETER
Not in Mississippi. Birthplace of
modern day government.
Hilly narrows her eyes at Skeeter and turns to Aibileen.
HILLY
Aibileen, did you know that me and
Mister Holbrook arranged for that
bathroom? Sent the boys over and
the equipment, too.
Hilly stays on Aibileen, waiting for her to say something.
Skeeter fumes, hoping Aibileen doesn't say it.
AIBILEEN
Yes, ma'am...And I thank you.
Hilly smiles and nods.
HILLY
Well...You. Are. Welcome.
Hilly shoots Skeeter a last look. William Jr. leans into
Hilly and hugs her.
AIBILEEN (V.O.)
One thing I got to say about Miss
Hilly, she love her children.
Always tellin' them they smart and
beautiful. Can't go more than ten
minutes without givin' one a kiss.
Hilly kisses her son gently.
AIBILEEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
And, law, do they love her back.
When she starts up on me, I just
try and think a my sweet Treelore
and how much he loved me. That
kind a love makes me cry. Even
when it going to Miss Hilly.
Hilly again glances to the red satchel, staring quizzically
at the worn booklet of The Jim Crow laws sticking out.
Skeeter types feverishly while smoking a cigarette. Keys type
out: "Home Help Sanitation Initiative."
Skeeter picks up Hilly's document and shakes her head. She
types: Don't risk your children's and family's health!
Skeeter and Stuart stand beneath an old Cypress tree as
Charlotte peeps from an upstairs window.
STUART
Look. I know it was a few weeks
back, but I came here to say I'm
sorry for the way I acted.
SKEETER
Who sent you? William or Hilly?
STUART
Neither. I was rude, and I've been
thinking about it a lot.
SKEETER
Well, I haven't. So, just go.
STUART
Now, look. I told Hilly I wasn't
ready to go out on any date. I
wasn't even close to ready.
Stuart shoves his hands in his pockets like a boy.
STUART (CONT'D)
I was engaged last year. She ended
it.
Skeeter refuses to pity him.
75.
STUART (CONT'D)
We'd been dating since we were
fifteen. You know how it is.
SKEETER
Actually, I don't. I've never
dated anyone before.
Stuart looks up and starts laughing loudly.
STUART
Well! That must be it then.
SKEETER
What?
STUART
I've never met a woman that said
exactly what she was thinking.
SKEETER
I've got plenty to say...
STUART
Would you like to...come downtown
with me and have dinner? We could
talk... We could listen to each
other this time.
SKEETER
I can't think of anything worse.
Stuart looks down and nods.
STUART
Then, I'm sorry. That's what I
came to say and...I said it.
Stuart turns and walks towards his car, self-consciously
weaving his strong fingers through his hair.
Skeeter looks up to her mother's empty window and shouts out
to Stuart.
SKEETER
Just give me a minute!
Stuart turns.
SKEETER (CONT'D)
Let me get my sweater.
Stuart and Skeeter make out HARD in the back of the
Holbrook's convertible. Hilly and William sit in the front.
Hilly peers into the rearview mirror to get a better view.
Proud of herself, she pats William's leg.
William slides his hand up Hilly's leg. She jerks it away.
Aibileen sits on the kitchen floor next to a bucket. She
feverishly scours grease off the baseboards.
Elizabeth's car pulls up. Aibileen smiles.
AIBILEEN
Baby girl home.
77.
The car door slams shut.
ELIZABETH (O.C.)
Aibileen! My trunk's full!
Aibileen rises slowly, placing a hand on her knee. Outside,
Elizabeth suddenly shouts out hysterically.
ELIZABETH (O.C.) (CONT'D)
Mae Mobley! No! Stop!
Aibileen panics. She gets up, looks out the window.
Elizabeth wobbles briskly up the street holding her pregnant
belly. Aibileen and Mae Mobley follow.
A stream of people walk toward them, laughing.
They round a corner to see FIFTY OLD TOILETS, in every shape
and color imaginable, littering Hilly's lawn.
Some have towering tanks with chain pulls at the top,
providing amusement to the procession of cars driving by.
The Holbrook's station wagon sits in the driveway, doors
still open with LUGGAGE tied to the roof.
Two OLD BLACK MEN struggle to remove a toilet under William's
supervision.
79.
Aibileen hides her smile. Mae Mobley points.
MAE MOBLEY
Look! Look, Aibee.
Hilly flies out of her house as a REPORTER snaps a picture of
her.
HILLY
Get out of here!
Hilly pushes him in the bushes and runs up to Elizabeth.
HILLY (CONT'D)
Skeeter! She put it in the
newsletter. I specifically said
old coats are to be dropped at my
house. Not commodes!
Hilly faces the toilets again and screams.
HILLY (CONT'D)
She put it in the newsletter when
she knew we'd be down at the beach.
Hilly steps up to Aibileen and points to the old men.
HILLY (CONT'D)
Go help those boys GET THOSE
TOILETS OFF MY LAWN!
Aibileen and the young man walk along a dark street. The
sound of cicadas and sirens fill the air.
YOUNG BLACK MAN
You all right? You close to home?
AIBILEEN
I be all right. My house is seven
blocks from here.
YOUNG BLACK MAN
Want me to walk you?
AIBILEEN
Naw, thank ya. I'll be fine...Law,
I hope this ain't as bad as-
Aibileen turns to discover the young man is gone. She stares
into the darkness. Scared, she begins to run.
She cuts through a yard and trips over a hedge. She falls
hard to her knees.
Terrified, Aibileen begins to sob. She sees Minny's porch
light and pulls herself up.
Stuart, on the deck of an offshore oil rig, laughs as he
looks at Hilly's picture inside a local newspaper.
He writes on the back of a postcard addressed to Skeeter:
I guess you potty trained Hilly!
Much love, Stuart.
Skeeter parks and gets out of her car. She suddenly finds
herself face to face with Hilly.
HILLY
You are sick. Do not speak to me.
Do not look at me. Don't say hello
to my children. How long had you
been planning to humiliate my
family?
SKEETER
That's not it, Hilly.
HILLY
You thought you were so clever,
didn't ya? But I've already
installed three of those old
toilets in people's garages.
SKEETER
Technically, it was a typo, Hilly.
HILLY
I intend to tell Stuart he's
ruining his reputation by
associating with you. Jolene's
yard boy saw you hanging around the
colored bus stop.
SKEETER
I wasn't hanging-
83.
HILLY
I guess your car was in the shop?
Skeeter looks away.
HILLY (CONT'D)
You know as well as I do, people
won't buy so much as a slice of
pound cake from an organization
that harbors racial
integrationists!
Skeeter steps forward.
SKEETER
Hilly, just who is that pound cake
money being raised for, anyway?
Hilly rolls her eyes.
HILLY
"The Starving Children of Africa."
Skeeter nods and walks away. Hilly shouts out.
HILLY (CONT'D)
Just so you know, Lou Ann Templeton
has taken your seat at bridge club.
Celia digs a hole next to the two existing rosebushes. A
closed shoebox and new rosebush wait to be planted.
Celia lowers the box in the grave, covering it with dirt.
Skeeter sits alone on the porch swing in her nightgown,
shifting through the Miss Myrna letters.
Charlotte steps onto the porch.
CHARLOTTE
Honey, would you like me to drop
you off at bridge club on the way
to my doctor's appointment?
SKEETER
(COVERING)
No, Ma'am. It's been cancelled.
Mae Mobley's sick or something.
88.
Skeeter enters quietly through Aibileen's kitchen door.
She is surprised to see twenty other black women standing
solemnly around the kitchen and the living room.
Aibileen approaches with a worried look.
SKEETER
What's wrong?
AIBILEEN
Yule May in prison, Miss Skeeter.
Gone be there four years.
Minny shouts out across the kitchen.
MINNY
Hilly Holbrook been sent from the
devil to ruirn all our lives.
A bank's clock shows twelve noon in downtown Jackson. It's
eerily quiet, not a soul on the street...
We hear archival footage of Walter Cronkite addressing the
nation.
Hilly sits with her son William playing on a blanket on the
front lawn.
A neighbor suddenly pulls up in his car stopping in front of
Hilly. He leans out and tells Hilly the tragic news.
In complete disbelief, Hilly puts her hand over her mouth.
She then grabs William, pulls him in close as if he's somehow
in danger.
Aibileen huddles with a dozen other maids in a circle.
They're all crying. Some throw their hands in the air.
Hilly and William walk to their car. Missus Walters follows
closely behind, holding Minny's pie.
HILLY
Just come on home and stay with us
tonight, Mother.
MISSUS WALTERS
No thanks, I got a pie to eat.
Hilly spins around and sees the pie.
108.
HILLY
You throw that pie away right now!
MISSUS WALTERS
I spent good money on this. Won it
just for you...
HILLY
You?! You signed me up?
Missus Walters steps up to Hilly.
MISSUS WALTERS
I may have trouble remembering my
own name and what country I live
in. But there's two things I can't
seem to forget. That my own
daughter threw me in a nursing
home...And that she ate Minny's
shit.
Missus Walters winks at Hilly and ambles to a waiting taxi
cab.
Celia lies in bed with the covers pulled over her face.
Minny enters carrying a tray of food, setting it down next to
two other trays of uneaten food.
MINNY
Ain't Mister Johnny gone wonder how
dinner got on the table if you laid
up in bed?
Celia pulls the covers off her head and sits up a little.
CELIA
The way Hilly looked at me. Like I
was trash on the road.
Celia pulls a letter out from under the covers.
CELIA (CONT'D)
She billed me for her dress. In
lieu of payment, she's asked that I
send two-hundred dollars to the
African Children's Fund and then
she banned me from all future
League events.
MINNY
She don't count. Don't judge
yourself by the way she see you.
CELIA
I'm not right for this kind of
life, Minny. I don't need a dinner
table for twelve people.
109.
CELIA (CONT'D)
I couldn't get two people over here
if I begged. She called me a liar
and accused me of getting her that
pie. I wouldn't have thrown up if
it wasn't for that! I can't do
this anymore to Johnny. I'm going
back to Sugar Ditch.
MINNY
You gone leave your husband cause
you threw up at some party?
Celia sobs.
MINNY (CONT'D)
Lord, I reckon it's time you knew.
Constantine hobbles with a cane down a gravel road still
wearing her soiled dress. She turns and looks one last time
at the Phelan Plantation...
CHARLOTTE
I told her she couldn't work here
anymore and to go on home.
Skeeter stands on the back patio crying. She slowly walks
off into the yard.
AIBILEEN (V.O.)
Constantine's story finally made it
in our book. But the reason she
got fired did not. Miss Skeeter
just couldn't put that kind a shame
on her own mother.
The front window of a bookstore displays many of the nation's
top selling books.
A clerk sets a tiny stack of books in the far corner.
AIBILEEN (V.O.)
They printed a few thousand copies
with the worst advance Miss Stein
had ever seen.
The stack is "The Help," in hardcover. It's wrapped in pale
blue. A white peace dove spreads its wing under the title.
Minny knocks on the door holding bags of groceries.
MINNY
Come on, Miss Celia! Get out a
that bed and let me in. It's
twelve noon. I did all the
shopping just like you asked.
The door slowly opens. Celia steps out onto the porch,
looking beautiful, still dressed tacky.
MINNY (CONT'D)
Well, look at you, Miss Celia.
Skeeter sits on the swing with Stuart who's just arrived from
the rig, still wearing his dingy work clothes.
121.
STUART
That month felt like a year. I
missed you so much.
SKEETER
Me, too.
STUART
Skeeter, I told Daddy I'm not going
back on the rig.
Stuart nonchalantly pulls out a ring from his front pocket
and places it in Skeeter's lap.
A huge diamond is surrounded by twelve small sapphires.
Skeeter's smile quickly fades as she raises the ring.
SKEETER
Stuart...I have to tell you
something.
STUART
How about "yes?!" I had this with
me down in New Orleans, you know.
Skeeter touches Stuart's face.
SKEETER
I'm serious...and...you have to
promise not to tell anyone.
STUART
Hang on. Did you say `yes'?
SKEETER
Yes.
Stuart hugs Skeeter. She pulls back.
SKEETER (CONT'D)
But listen. Can I have your word?
Skeeter has again ruined Stuart's big moment.
STUART
Sure. You have my word.
Stuart storms off the porch, dumbfounded. Finally.
STUART
This is what you've been writing
for the last twelve months?! What
happened to the cleaning column?
SKEETER
I did both.
122.
Skeeter approaches Stuart.
STUART
So, the talk in town? I said they
were dead wrong. Told them you
were too smart to get mixed up in
anything like that.
Skeeter reaches to calm him. He pulls away.
STUART (CONT'D)
That joke you played on Hilly with
the toilets. Hell, that's funny.
But this? I don't understand why
you did this...why you even care.
SKEETER
What?
STUART
Things are fine around here. Why
stir up trouble?
SKEETER
I'm not stirring up trouble,
Stuart. Trouble's already here.
STUART
I guess it is.
Skeeter grabs his arm.
SKEETER
I had to tell you. You needed to
know.
Stuart shakes his head and pulls away...
STUART
I guess I don't really know you,
Skeeter. And I can't marry somebody
I don't know.
Stuart looks down at the ring.
STUART (CONT'D)
That was my grandmother's.
Skeeter hands the ring back. Stuart shoves it in his pocket.
STUART (CONT'D)
Don't worry. I won't tell anyone.
SKEETER
Just leave.
Hilly drives in front of Jitney Jingle grocery store. She
wears a scarf on her head and big sunglasses. One-armed
Ernestine rides in the passenger seat.
Hilly slows in front of the store's big glass entrance. She
hurriedly waves Ernestine out of the car.
AIBILEEN (V.O.)
The voters of Hinds County had
spoke. Mister Holbrook wasn't gone
have no political career.
One-Arm Ernestine races to the storefront and removes
William's campaign poster taped to the window.
Minny lies in bed sleeping. Her eyes pop open. But, this
time, Hilly's scream fades as knocks at the door grow louder.
Knocking that has actually stirred Minny awake.
Sugar and Kindra enter, jumping in bed with Minny.
SUGAR
Momma, there's a white man at our
door!
MAN (O.C.)
Minny Jackson! Are you in there?!
Minny covers the girls with a blanket. She puts on a robe and
grabs a bat from behind the door.
MAN (O.C.) (CONT'D)
I can hear you. Open the door.
Aibileen and Minny walk into the church parking lot wearing
their Sunday best.
Minny takes note of all the cars.
MINNY
We late? Looks like Bible study
done already started.
AIBILEEN
No. We ain't late.
Skeeter stands next to the barn smoking a cigarette reading
the Harper and Row offer for the hundredth time.
Tires crunch gravel down the drive. Skeeter sees a car
moving toward her with the headlights off.
Worried, Skeeter looks toward her home. Charlotte can be
seen in an upstairs window.
Skeeter soon recognizes the car as Hilly's.
Hilly parks, lights a cigarette and gets out of her car.
Skeeter charges toward her.
SKEETER
What are you doing here?
Hilly screams and throws her lit cigarette at Skeeter.
HILLY
Don't you get an inch closer!
Hilly's a mess. Her shirt is half tucked. Her shorts strain
to contain a newly developed layer of fat.
A horrible fever blister burns hot on Hilly's upper lip.
HILLY (CONT'D)
I've contacted my lawyer, Hibbie
Goodman. He's the best libel
attorney in Mississippi. You're in
big trouble, Missy. And you're
going to jail.
SKEETER
You can't prove anything, Hilly.
HILLY
I one-hundred-percent know you
wrote it `cause nobody else in town
is as tacky as you. Those nigras of
yours are in a lifetime of trouble.
SKEETER
Exactly who are you talking about?
You don't know anything.
131.
HILLY
I don't, do I? You tell Aibileen,
the next time she wants to write
about my dear friend Elizabeth...uh-
huh. Remember her? Had you in her
wedding? Let's just say, Aibileen
ought to've been a little bit
smarter before putting in the L-
shaped crack in poor Elizabeth's
dining table. And that nigra,
Minny? Do I have plans for her.
SKEETER
Careful, Hilly. Don't give
yourself away now.
HILLY
That was not me WHO ATE THAT PIE!
Hilly storms up the porch steps. Skeeter follows.
SKEETER
I did not invite you here!
Skeeter yanks Hilly's arm hard.
HILLY
I've come to tell your mother what
a hippie you've become. She's
gonna be disgusted by you.
Skeeter can't help but laugh.
SKEETER
You're telling my mother on me?
Hilly opens the door. Skeeter grabs her. They struggle.
SKEETER (CONT'D)
You get out of here!
Charlotte suddenly appears. Skeeter lets go of Hilly.
CHARLOTTE
Why, Hilly...It's been such a long
time, Dear. Everything okay, you
two?
Hilly is shocked by Charlotte's frail appearance.
HILLY
Missus Phelan, I'm...I'm here to-
CHARLOTTE
Hilly, you're a mess. Are you ill?
Hilly self-consciously licks her fever blister.
HILLY
Well, I...I didn't have time to get
fixed up before-
132.
CHARLOTTE
Darling, no husband wants to come
home and see this.
Charlotte peers closely at Hilly's cold sore.
CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
And that...that is horrendous.
HILLY
Missus Phelan, I'm here-
CHARLOTTE
You know, Hilly. If I didn't know
any better, I'd say you've been
eating too many...SWEETS?
Hilly's face turns purple with embarrassment. Charlotte
moves in for the kill.
CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
In fact. I'm sure of it. Now GET
OUT OF MY HOUSE...before we all get
one of those on our lip.
Hilly looks back and forth between Skeeter and her mother,
not knowing what to say.
Hilly runs out of the house as Charlotte sashays quietly into
the living room.
Shocked, Skeeter stands alone in the foyer. Hilly sprays
gravel across the Phelan yard as she speeds away.
CHARLOTTE (O.C.) (CONT'D)
Eugenia?
SKEETER
Yes, Ma'am.
CHARLOTTE (O.C.)
Come in here, please.
Skeeter gulps as she heads toward the living room.
Minny stands barefoot inside a phone booth, her lip swollen,
face bleeding. Her kids stand outside, crying.
MINNY
They fired Leroy last night! And
when Leroy ask why, his boss say
Mister Holbrook told him to do it.
Said his nigger wife the reason.
AIBILEEN
Oh, Law!
MINNY
He try to kill me with he bare
hands! He threw the kids in the
yard, lock me in the bathroom, and
say he gone set the house on fire.
134.
AIBILEEN
Where are you now?!
MINNY
The gas station. I climbed out the
window, and we all ran here.
AIBILEEN
I'm on come there now.
MINNY
Wait, Aibileen...I'm pregnant.
AIBILEEN
Minny, now, you listen to me. That
baby gone be fine, and you ain't
never gone lose your job. Mister
Johnny told you that hisself.
They's more book money coming.
Your baby ain't gone know about
gettin' beat. You hear me? You
free, Minny! You are free.
Minny lets out a chuckle of relief and wipes her eyes.
AIBILEEN (CONT'D)
You hear me?
MINNY
I hear you...
The Leefolt front door opens. Elizabeth calls out.
ELIZABETH (O.C.)
Aibileen?
Aibileen steps out of the house with her purse.
She walks stoically down the driveway. Tears stream down her
face.
Mae Mobley runs to the living room window crying. She beats
on the glass from inside.
MAE MOBLEY
Aibeeeee! Don't go!
Aibileen never turns.
138.
AIBILEEN (V.O.)
Mae Mobley was my last baby. In
just thirty minutes, I felt like my
whole life was done. Of the
thirteen maids, seven of us got
fired. Several other maids got
fired who had nothin' to do with
our book. Guess our stories
weren't so unique after all...But,
like Minny, we was all free.
Minny folds laundry on a picnic table.
AIBILEEN (V.O.)
Ever so often, we all get a nice
piece of book money in the mail.
`Manna from heaven' we like to call
it.
Minny looks across the table and smiles at Celia who is
holding and playing with Minny's newborn child.
Close on tombstone:
CONSTANTINE JEFFERSON
Born December 24th 1883
Died March 15th, 1963
A bouquet of flowers lay at the foot of the tombstone. A
copy of "The Help" leans against it.
In the distance, a cab slowly pulls away with Skeeter inside.
