On the backslope of a mound of rubble, a three-man TV
crew (field producer, reporter, and cameraman, all
wearing flak jackets) waits while the cameraman, JEFFREY
TAYLOR, works to repair his malfunctioning minicam.
Throughout this sequence, ROD, the reporter, types on a
laptop computer, oblivious to what is happening around
him.
HOWARD, the field producer, lies on his stomach, peering
cautiously over the crest of the rubble through
binoculars.
Beyond him we see an empty street. It is lined with
buildings blasted by shells: a sawtooth wall in the
f.g., a ruined high-rise at the end of the street,
billboards in an unrecognizable foreign language.
HOWARD
How about it, Jeff?
Jeff finishes his repair job, snaps the minicam closed.
JEFF
Done.
Jeff slips the knife back in his pocket, scrambles over
the loose bricks and stones to a position next to Howard.
A frightened woman lurks nervously in the shelter of the
wall. She is young, in her early twenties, with shining
dark hair down to her shoulders. She's carrying an
armload of books.
Jeff focuses the minicam.
2.
MINICAM POV
FRAMED in the viewfinder we see the frightened woman.
HOWARD (O.S.)
Nice legs.
Jeff ignores Howard, PANS the minicam DOWN the street.
In the viewfinder we see the flash of sun on metal.
A row of blasted windows. In one of the windows, a
sniper crouches. Sunlight glitters on his rifle barrel.
JEFF
(matter-of-fact)
Sniper.
HOWARD
Where?
JEFF
High-rise. Top floor.
Window in
the middle.
HOWARD
(looking through
his binoculars)
Stay on him. Stay on him.
Now go
back to the woman. Now!
Jeff swings the minicam and --
-- the image blurs, then holds steady on the frightened
woman. Nervously, she peeks around the corner.
HOWARD (O.S.)
Back to the sniper.
HOWARD
Stay tight on the sniper.
Jesus -- look at him! He's about
fourteen! Don't lose this!
Jeff kneels on the ridge, minicam on his shoulder.
3.
Jeff's minicam ZOOMS IN ON the sniper. The sniper sees
the woman peeking and gets his rifle in firing position.
JEFF
He sees her.
HOWARD
Stay on her. If she runs, widen
and try to get her and sniper in
the same frame.
Jeff turns his head away from the camera and stares at
Howard.
JEFF
I said he sees her.
HOWARD
I heard you.
Stay on her.
Jeff looks to Rod for support but he's busy typing,
oblivious.
Jeff hesitates, then lifts the minicam to his eye again.
The sniper, taking aim.
The frightened woman decides to make a dash for it.
She
takes off her high-heeled shoes, inhales deeply,
gathering herself to run.
Jeff watches through his viewfinder:
JEFF
(under his breath)
No... no...
The frightened woman bolts, sprinting barefoot across the
cobblestones, skirt lifted, slender legs flashing.
4.
Jeff jumps to his feet, waves the minicam, shouting:
JEFF
Sniper!
Sniper! Sni--
STREET
The woman looks up in Jeff's direction, confused,
breaking stride --
We hear a burst of automatic gunfire --
RUINED HIGH-RISE
In the window, the winking muzzle-flash of the sniper's
AK-47.
STREET
The woman's body jolts from the impact of the bullets.
The books go flying from her hand. She spins to the
pavement, her hair billowing.
JEFF
just stands there, a shattered expression. The camera
hangs at his side. He stares at the dead woman as a pool
of dark blood expands around her body.
CUT TO:
NIGHT
A 747 touches down on the tarmac.
CUT TO:
A late-model Jeep Cherokee is parked at the arrival curb.
AMY TAYLOR, Jeff's wife, peers out from behind the wheel,
scanning the crowd.
HER POV
Jeff, carrying a single bag slung over his shoulder,
emerges from the terminal.
5.
BACK TO SCENE
Amy gets out of the car, grinning. Jeff sees her and
hurries over. He drops his bag and they fall into each
other's arms, kissing hungrily. These are two people
passionately in love with each other.
AMY
God, I missed you.
JEFF
Me too.
AMY
Let's get out of here. Where's
your equipment? Don't tell me you
checked it?
JEFF
(holds up his bag)
This is it.
AMY
No camera?
Jeff shakes his head no.
AMY
No nothing?
Again Jeff shakes his head.
Amy arches an eyebrow.
AMY
Ah ha.
CUT TO:
DAY AND NIGHT
The metallic grill of the Cherokee explodes INTO FRAME as
the car whooshes over us, hurtling down the Massachusetts
Turnpike.
In a SERIES OF SHOTS, with CREDITS OVER, we see landmarks
form the cross-country trip: a Pennsylvania Dutch
farmhouse, a smoke-spewing factory in Ohio, the
Mississippi River, Kansas wheat fields, Loveland Pass and
the Continental Divide.
DISSOLVE TO:
The middle of nowhere. Sand, weeds and sagebrush. A
two-lane highway stretches to the horizon like a ribbon
of asphalt.
The Cherokee cruises along the road. Its Massachusetts
plates seem out of place in this stark landscape.
There are no other vehicles.
MOVING CLOSER, we see that Jeff is driving.
Amy is sound
asleep in the reclined passenger seat.
In back, luggage, moving boxes, camera cases.
A slow-moving Dodge Ram pickup truck is approaching the
highway along a small road that cuts across the desert
floor.
The pickup, equipped with oversized tires, roll bar, and
a CB whip antenna, bounces over the uneven terrain and
turns onto the highway, stopping just before entering
Jeff's lane.
The Cherokee goes into a wild looping skid. The Ram
jerks to a halt as the Cherokee whips past, averting a
collision by inches.
A small desert gas station/mini-mart just off the
highway. A sign over the building: "Last Gas For 30
Miles." The Cherokee is parked at the pumps, hood
raised.
Jeff comes out of the mini-mart, carrying a
plastic quart
of oil. He unscrews the cap and starts to
fill the
crankcase, careful not to spill on the new
engine. In
the b.g., Amy is visible inside the store,
browsing a
magazine rack.
As Jeff continues pouring the oil, he doesn't notice the
mud-streaked Dodge Ram pickup pulling up to the pumps
behind him. The driver, EARL, climbs out. The other man
remains in the cab with the smoked windows rolled up.
Earl is a beefy man about Jeff's age. He wears a sweat-
stained Western hat, cowboy boots and a T-shirt with the
sleeves cut out to display his tattooed biceps. He
saunters over to the Cherokee, stands there a beat,
looking over Jeff's shoulder.
Jeff senses something behind him, turns. His eyes widen
as he sees Earl, recognizes the pickup as the one he
nearly hit a few minutes before. Earl stares at him,
unsmiling.
EARL
(flatly)
Nice car.
Jeff is in an awkward position. He's got a half-full
upside-down bottle of oil in his hands. If he lifts it
now, he'll spill on the engine. He turns his gaze back
to the engine, decides to keep pouring.
JEFF
Thanks.
Earl steps around to the open passenger window, peers in.
Jeff watches him, wary.
(CONTINUED)
13.
CONTINUED:
EARL
Air, C.D., leather -- I guess you
sprung for the whole nine yards.
JEFF
I guess.
EARL
Then again, out here, what you
really need's a C.B. radio.
JEFF
Is that right?
The oil bottle empties
out. Relieved, Jeff pulls it away
and screws back on the
crankcase cap. He shuts the hood
with a thunk and moves
around to the side of the car to
remove the gas nozzle
from the tank. Earl blocks his
path.
EARL
'Course, if you use a C.B., you
gotta have a handle.
Jeff says nothing.
This is not a friendly conversation.
EARL
How about Shit-for-Brains?
(beat)
You damn near killed us back
there, boy.
JEFF
Look, I'm sorry, I didn't see you.
You pulled out in front of me.
EARL
The hell I did. I saw what
happened.
Looking past Earl, Jeff sees Amy come out of the mini-
mart with a bag of groceries. He speaks carefully,
anxious to avoid a confrontation.
JEFF
How about if we just forget it,
okay? I'm sorry it happened. I
don't want any trouble.
EARL
(snorting)
Yeah.
I bet you don't.
(CONTINUED)
14.
CONTINUED:
Earl glares at Jeff before turning away.
He passes Amy,
gives her a broad smile.
EARL
Howdy, ma'am. Caught this fellow
tryin' to steal your Cherokee.
Amy takes in the situation. She nods politely. Earl
continues into the mini-mart. She approaches Jeff,
puzzled.
AMY
What was that about?
JEFF
Nothing. Guy in the truck.
Thinks I tried to hit him.
Jeff glances apprehensively at the man in the pickup, who
has not moved during the scene. He looks back at the
mini-mart.
JEFF
C'mon, let's go.
AMY
You want me to drive?
JEFF
Later.
Just get in.
AMY
Is something wrong?
JEFF
No, let's just go.
Jeff climbs in behind the wheel. Amy glances at him and
gets in the car. Jeff keys the IGNITION and pulls away.
Far below us, the Cherokee traces the empty highway.
There are no buildings, no houses, no other vehicles.
DISSOLVE TO:
Steam pours from under the
hood of the Cherokee. Amy
gets out and looks around
at the scorched wasteland.
Jeff goes to the front of
the car, gropes under the hood
for the release latch. He
yanks his hand away, burned by
the hot metal.
JEFF
Ow!
(CONTINUED)
18.
CONTINUED:
AMY
Are you okay?
JEFF
I'm fine.
Amy moves to Jeff to examine the burn.
She reaches out.
JEFF
(annoyed)
I said I'm fine, okay?
Jeff lifts the hood, examines the engine. He tugs on a
cable, checks the battery connection and radiator.
He goes to the passenger's side and takes a hand-held
cellular phone from the glove box. He dials zero and
hits "send." The PHONE BEEPS.
AMY
Out of range?
Jeff grunts, tosses the phone on the seat. It bounces
and lands on the floor. Amy watches as he returns to the
engine and begins unscrewing the radiator cap.
AMY
What's going on, Jeff?
JEFF
What's it look like?
I'm trying
to fix the car.
AMY
Not the car.
JEFF
What?
AMY
What's going on with you?
Jeff busies himself with the engine, not answering.
AMY
It's been a month since you got
back. You can't keep shutting me
out like this.
Jeff says nothing.
AMY
Jeff, I'm talking to you.
(CONTINUED)
19.
CONTINUED:
JEFF
(flaring)
Look, I really don't want to go
into this right now. I'm changing
jobs, our finances are fucked, and
we're stuck in the middle of
nowhere. So could we maybe just
fix the --
He stops in mid-sentence. There is a RUMBLE in the
distance. They look down the road.
JEFF
Christ, not these guys...
JEFF'S POV - DODGE RAM PICKUP
approaching fast on the road. As it streaks past, Earl
yells and launches a beer bottle from the window. The
BOTTLE SHATTERS on the asphalt.
BACK TO JEFF
watching the Ram speed away.
JEFF
Asshole...
AMY
(looking down
the road)
Jeff --
A quarter-mile away, the pickup is slowing. It pulls a
U-turn and stops, facing the Cherokee. It just sits
there, ENGINE IDLING.
JEFF
What the hell?
AMY
What's he doing?
JEFF
I don't know.
Jeff watches the pickup, frowning. Then, from the
opposite direction, they hear a LOW RUMBLE. They turn
and stare at --
20.
MASSIVE TRACTOR-TRAILER
coming over a crest in the road.
It's a huge eighteen-wheeler. A white 1988 Peterbilt.
It grinds into low gear and slows, BRAKES CREAKING.
The TRUCK comes to a halt with a HISS of compressed air.
DOWN HIGHWAY
the PICKUP STARTS UP again. It pulls another U-turn and
drives away, melting into the desert.
AMY
breathes a sigh of relief.
The driver dismounts from the cab, leaving the ENGINE
IDLING. We recognize him as the Trucker in the mini-
mart. He removes his cap, revealing a shock of
prematurely white hair. He is well-shaven, his clothes
immaculate. His name is Red.
RED (TRUCKER)
You folks all right?
JEFF
Yeah.
Our car broke down.
RED
(chuckling)
I figured that much. You want a
hand pushing it off the road?
JEFF
Thanks, I'd appreciate it.
Amy,
you want to steer?
Amy gets behind the wheel and puts the shift in neutral.
Jeff and Red push the car to the shoulder. As they push,
Jeff glances at the CB antenna on Red's cab.
JEFF
Think you could radio a tow truck
for us?
RED
I sure would if I could, mister,
but my C.B. blew a fuse this
morning. I'm waiting till I hit
the truck stop on I-40 to get it
fixed.
(CONTINUED)
21.
CONTINUED:
JEFF
How far is that?
RED
About 60 miles.
JEFF
(disappointed)
Oh.
Red walks around to the front of the car and peers down
at the exposed engine.
RED
I'd offer to take a look, but it's
hard to say with these new
engines. Used to be, you could
give 'em a kick and a holler and
they'd start right up. Now it's
all computers and chips.
JEFF
It's a new car.
RED
That could be the problem. You
been running it pretty fast?
Amy gives Jeff a reprimanding look.
It's subtle, but Red
notices.
RED
Tell you what. If you want a
ride, there's a little diner up
the road. Belle's. They got a
pay phone. You could call a tow
truck from there.
Jeff considers this, glances back to where the Dodge Ram
was last seen.
JEFF
Nice
of you to offer. But we've
got a
lot of stuff in the car. I
think
we're better off waiting for
a cop
to come along.
Amy rolls her eyes. Red sees the look, trying not to
smile. He glances up at a small plane flying overhead.
(CONTINUED)
22.
CONTINUED:
RED
(casually)
Suit
yourself. Not many cops on
this
road, that's why the truckers
use
it. Maybe you'll get lucky.
(tipping his cap)
Good
luck.
He turns and heads back toward his truck. Amy looks at
Jeff. She waits till the trucker is out of earshot.
AMY
Are you nuts?
JEFF
We don't know this guy.
AMY
He's offering to help. It
could
be hours before anyone else
comes
along. It's 100 degrees.
You
really want to be stuck out
here?
JEFF
Amy, I've got my equipment in the
car. All our stuff. What if
those guys come back and we're not
here?
(turns away,
quietly to
himself)
Jesus... don't be stupid...
Amy hears this.
She's had enough.
Flares.
AMY
Stupid is sitting out here waiting
for a cop when we already have a
ride.
In the b.g., the TRUCK is THROTTLING UP.
Then, mad and
careless:
AMY
Stupid was letting you talk me
into leaving Boston.
She turns away. The truck starts to pull out. She bites
her lip, thinking, then steps into the road and flags the
truck down. Red brakes.
AMY
Excuse me? Do you think you could
drop me at that diner?
(CONTINUED)
23.
CONTINUED:
RED
(surprised)
Sure thing. How about you,
mister? I could take you both
just as easy.
AMY
That's okay. My husband wants to
stay with the car. I'll just get
my purse.
She goes to the passenger side of the Jeep for her purse.
Jeff follows, lowering his voice.
JEFF
What do you think you're doing?
AMY
I'm going to the diner. I'm going
to call a tow truck. Then I'm
going to order an iced tea and
wait. Good-bye, Jeff.
JEFF
(firm)
You're not riding with that guy.
End of story.
AMY
You wanted to be alone. Well...
you're alone. Why don't you take
the time to get your head
together?
She walks to the truck. Jeff stands there. She climbs
into the cab. Red moves some papers out of the way.
RED
Watch your step, ma'am.
She pulls the door shut. The TRUCK THROTTLES UP and
pulls away. Jeff watches the truck dwindle in the
distance, flashers blinking. After a beat, the flashers
cease.
SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
Beneath a blazing sun, Jeff paces restlessly in front of
the Cherokee, checking his watch, wiping beads of sweat
from his face. He looks down the highway.
(CONTINUED)
24.
CONTINUED:
Nothing in sight. Extremely bored, he wanders over to
the raised hood and studies the engine again.
After a few moments, something catches his eye. Curious,
he kneels down and peers under the chassis. He frowns.
JEFF'S POV - LOOSE WIRE
dangling under the engine.
BACK TO JEFF
JEFF
Oh for Christ's sake...
He pulls his Swiss Army knife
from his pocket and slides
under the car. Working with
the screwdriver blade of the
knife, he reconnects the plug
to its socket. In the
process, his hands and shirt
become stained with grease.
Jeff slides out from under the car, brushes himself off
and gets behind the wheel. He tosses the Swiss Army
knife on the center console and keys the ignition. The
ENGINE ROARS to life.
CUT TO:
The Cherokee speeds down the empty highway.
The Jeep blows past.
DISSOLVE TO:
A weather-beaten structure with a gravel parking lot.
A
peeling sign on the roof: "Belle's: Beer & Food."
There is a phone booth outside.
The Cherokee pulls in and parks.
Jeff CHIRPS the ALARM,
heads for the entrance.
25.
Jeff squints in the bright sunlight.
Maybe he got this place confused with a different diner.
He peers up at the sign. It says "Belle's," all right.
He walks to the phone booth, looks inside.
The phone
book is missing.
He picks up the receiver, listens for the dial tone...
Phone works okay. He hangs up.
He stands there for a moment, scanning the horizon in all
directions. There is nothing else out here, nowhere else
she could have gone.
Jeff marches back into the diner...
Jeff marches briskly to his car and opens the door,
forgetting to deactivate the alarm. The SIREN WAILS.
Jeff fumbles for the remote and shuts if OFF.
HIGH ANGLE - MOMENTS LATER
The Cherokee pulls out of the parking lot, kicking up
gravel.
CUT TO:
The Cherokee crests a rise...
The Cherokee turns sharply onto the other road.
The Cherokee speeds down the road, gaining on the
Peterbilt. It comes up behind.
29.
Jeff and Red keep a careful eye on each other as the
Sheriff climbs down from the cab, wiping his hands.
SHERIFF BOYD
(to both of them)
All right, let's see your license
and registration.
Jeff and Red fish into their wallets and hand over
I.D.'s. The Sheriff examines them, comparing faces to
pictures and writing down names.
SHERIFF BOYD
What are you hauling today, Mr.
Barr?
RED
Nothing, empty load. I'm heading
to Fresno for a pick up -- ball
bearings or something.
SHERIFF BOYD
(eyeing him)
Long way to go empty.
RED
Tell me about it. Too much
competition nowadays. One horse
guys like me gotta drive halfway
'cross the country just to get a
payin' job.
JEFF
(to Sheriff,
impatient)
Are we gonna keep looking or what?
The Sheriff hands back the I.D.'s.
SHERIFF BOYD
Yes, we are.
(to Red)
Sir, I'm gonna have to see
everything.
RED
No problem.
I understand.
35.
Jeff and the Sheriff observe as Red unlatches two heavy
padlocks. Grunting, he raises the slatted METAL DOOR.
It retracts along the ceiling with a noisy RATTLE.
INSIDE
The cavernous interior is mostly empty, except for a few
randomly strewn cardboard boxes, too small to contain a
person.
SHERIFF BOYD
(re: boxes)
Those yours?
RED
Yeah. Personal stuff. Clothes
and whatnot. You want to take a
look?
The Sheriff considers it, shakes his head.
SHERIFF BOYD
No. I think we're pretty much
done here. You're free to go.
JEFF
(reacts)
Whoa, whoa -- wait a sec. That's
it? You're not going to question
him anymore?
SHERIFF BOYD
Sir, I searched the truck.
There's no evidence of suspicious
activity, no sign of struggle.
Red has been looking on.
He chimes in, trying to be
helpful:
RED
Look, I don't mean to butt in, but
maybe you got my truck confused
with someone else's.
JEFF
(lunges)
Go to hell, you sonofabitch --
The Sheriff grabs Jeff, holds him back.
(CONTINUED)
36.
CONTINUED:
SHERIFF BOYD
Hey! Hey! You want to get
arrested? Now the man has a
point. This is a plain-looking,
John Doe truck. Maybe you did get
them mixed up.
Jeff stares at the Sheriff a beat, then bolts suddenly
for the front of the truck. He yanks open the door and
leaps up into the cab.
SHERIFF BOYD
Hey!
The Sheriff jogs after him.
Red walks to the cab,
unconcerned.
Sheriff Boyd looks up sternly as Jeff continues searching
the cab. Red watches calmly.
SHERIFF BOYD
Mr. Taylor, either you come down
from there or I'm going to have to
arrest you.
Jeff gives up reluctantly. He looks lame and desperate
and he knows it. He steps down from the cab, gritting
his teeth.
JEFF
It was him.
It was this truck.
SHERIFF BOYD
Uh-huh, I can see that. Did you
get a license plate?
Jeff stares at him, knows where this is going.
JEFF
No.
SHERIFF BOYD
What about the information on the
door panel. You recall any of
that?
(CONTINUED)
37.
CONTINUED:
JEFF
I wasn't paying attention.
The Sheriff studies him a beat, nods.
SHERIFF BOYD
Mr. Taylor, did you by any chance
have a beef with your wife today?
JEFF
What does that have to do with
anything?
SHERIFF BOYD
Well, for starters, maybe she left
you.
JEFF
I don't believe this...
SHERIFF BOYD
I've seen it a hundred times.
Lovers, married couples, gay guys.
You put two people in a car long
enough, they'll go at it. Hell,
I've even seen men dump their
women on the side of the road, and
vice versa.
Jeff stares at the cop.
Emphatic:
JEFF
My wife did not leave me.
RED
(cuts in)
Officer, I'm sorry, I'd like to
stay and help, but I really got to
make it to Fresno...
SHERIFF BOYD
I understand. Go ahead, sir.
I
appreciate your cooperation.
JEFF
This is insane. You're just going
to let him go?
SHERIFF BOYD
I've got his information. If we
need to find him later, we'll know
where to look.
(CONTINUED)
38.
CONTINUED:
RED
Much obliged.
(to Jeff)
Good luck findin' your wife,
mister. No hard feelings.
Red climbs into the cab. Jeff watches helplessly,
resigned to the fact there's nothing more he can do.
The
Sheriff goes to the cruiser and speaks on the radio.
As
the truck drives off, Jeff goes over to the cruiser.
SHERIFF BOYD
Sir, I believe you that your wife
is missing. Maybe you got
confused about what truck she got
into, maybe you had a fight -- you
don't have to tell me. The point
is I'm trying to help.
He hands Jeff a card with an address printed on it.
SHERIFF BOYD
The town of Brackett's 31 miles
that way. My deputy's name is Len
Carver. He's a good man. He'll
help you fill out the necessary
forms if you want to report your
wife missing.
Jeff clenches his jaw as the words sink in.
The Sheriff
softens, his tone sympathetic.
SHERIFF BOYD
If you want my opinion, your wife
is probably around here. Lost or
plenty pissed off and giving you a
scare. Either way, she'll turn
up.
As Jeff stares at the Sheriff, the police RADIO SQUAWKS.
DISPATCHER (V.O.)
(filtered)
Sheriff, this is dispatch. Mrs.
Gilbert's locked out of her
trailer again. Can you respond?
SHERIFF BOYD
(into mike)
10-4, dispatch. Tell her I'm on
my way.
He racks the mike.
(CONTINUED)
39.
CONTINUED:
JEFF
I want your name and badge number.
The Sheriff looks up at Jeff, sighs.
SHERIFF BOYD
Sheriff Arthur Boyd. 226-93.
This really isn't necessary --
JEFF
Don't tell me what's necessary,
goddamnit. I'm noting the exact
time of this conversation. 10:52
A.M.
SHERIFF BOYD
(exhaling)
Suit yourself, Mr. Taylor.
The Sheriff shifts into gear and drives away. Jeff is
left standing on the side of the road, desert in all
directions.
CUT TO:
From this high vantage point, we see Jeff's car
approaching.
The Cherokee pulls up to the side of the building.
Jeff
gets out and walks inside.
Jeff exits, breathing hard, and runs to the phone booth.
PHONE BOOTH
is occupied by a YOUNG MAN with an awkward oversized
frame, ill-fitting clothes. Jeff raps on the glass
anxiously.
JEFF
Please, I need the phone -- I have
to call the police!
(CONTINUED)
44.
CONTINUED:
The Man looks up, dull and glassy-eyed. His sluggish
demeanor suggests mental retardation. He hangs up and
slowly opens the door.
SLUGGISH MAN
(drawls)
My name's Billy. You the feller
lookin' for his wife?
JEFF
How'd you know? Did you see her?
The Sluggish Man hesitates. There's something holding
him back. Jeff senses this.
JEFF
Please, if you know something,
anything, tell me.
BILLY (SLUGGISH MAN)
(a beat)
I seen her... maybe.
JEFF
What?
When?
Billy is about to answer. In b.g., the Bartender sticks
his head out of the diner. Billy backs away, spooked.
BILLY
Oh man. Never shoulda opened my
damn mouth. Now I'm gonna git it.
Billy breaks into a loping run through the parking lot.
Jeff hurries after him and catches up, cornering Billy
between two cars, trying to calm him.
JEFF
No one's going to hurt you, Billy.
Just tell me what you saw.
Billy glances around nervously, swallowing.
BILLY
She came in on a truck.
A big
white one.
JEFF
Yes...
BILLY
Then she... she got in another
truck.
(CONTINUED)
45.
CONTINUED:
JEFF
Another truck? With who?
BILLY
Dunno. Some men. Bad men. They
say I'm a dummy, but I ain't. I
see things.
Jeff reels, struggles to stay focused.
JEFF
Do you know where they went?
BILLY
Uh-huh.
Route seven.
Up by the
river.
JEFF
Where by the river?
BILLY
Dunno. They don't tell me that
kind of stuff.
JEFF
Who doesn't? The bartender?
The
men in the truck?
Billy's expression darkens.
He starts backing away.
BILLY
I ain't talking to you no more.
JEFF
Billy, I need you to come to the
police. If you tell them what you
saw, they'll be able to help me.
Billy laughs.
BILLY
Man, you're the dummy.
Jeff looks at him, confused.
BILLY
Don't you git it? The police is
the ones in on it!
Billy turns and runs back into the diner.
ON Jeff's
sickened reaction, we --
CUT TO:
46.
The highway intersects Route 7. The Cherokee slows just
enough to take the corner without tipping over.
It flies past a sign:
"Route 7 - North."
CUT TO:
The road ascends into the rocky hills above the desert
plain. The route is narrow and windy, forcing Jeff to
reduce his speed.
The road curves through a tunnel, then climbs higher,
past sharp cliffs and drop-offs. Jeff follows the signs
for "Route 7."
Jeff has climbed to higher ground. He lies flat on his
belly and peers THROUGH a gap in the rocks at the river
valley below.
JEFF'S POV - RIVER
The men have given up their pursuit.
The moving van, a jumbo three-axle GMC, has turned around
and backed up to the edge of the ravine.
A stocky man, AL (whom we recognize as Earl's passenger
at the minimart), operates a gas-powered winch in the
cargo door of the van.
A cable runs from the winch down to the Cherokee in the
river.
Standing knee-deep in the current, Earl signals to Al
while the winch slowly tugs the Cherokee onto its wheels,
then backwards out of the river.
54.
BACK TO JEFF
watching in amazement.
He can hear only snatches of
their conversation.
AL
... can't believe you let him get
away...
EARL
You try chasing... through this
shit...
AL
Fuck... this is what happens when
you get one without the other...
Jeff can't believe it. The Cherokee is being pulled
backwards up the slope toward the road.
He belly-crawls back from the outcropping, gets to his
feet and climbs higher.
CUT TO:
Jeff has moved to higher ground. He crouches behind a
stand of manzanita and looks down at the activity below.
JEFF'S POV - ROAD
The Cherokee is now back on the road.
Operating the winch with precision efficiency, Earl and
Al drag the Cherokee up a ramp into the rear of the
moving van.
Once the vehicle is aboard, they stow the ramp and close
the van doors.
BACK TO JEFF
watching in amazement, straining to hear what Earl and Al
are saying. Behind Jeff, a PEBBLE SKITTERS on the rock.
He turns, reacts.
It's Billy -- the halfwit from the diner! Wielding a
shotgun like a club, he swings the butt at Jeff's skull!
Jeff drops to the ground, unconscious.
CUT TO BLACK.
55.
FADE IN:
There is a CREAK and the TRUNK opens. Jeff squints into
the sun. Earl and Billy stand over the trunk.
EARL
Get out.
Don't try anything
stupid.
Jeff gets out, grimacing.
His clothes are stained with
grease and tire grime. He
sets his feet unsteadily on
the ground, looks around.
We see that he has been
confined in the trunk of a
Pontiac Firebird.
The Firebird and Dodge Ram are parked on a bluff. Red
stands on the highest point, peering through binoculars
at the desert below. He glances at Jeff.
RED
You're a tough man to get a hold
of, Jeffrey.
Jeff stares, a mix of emotions -- anger, fear, confusion.
JEFF
(barely able to
control himself)
What do you want?
RED
It's not me we're talking about.
Question is what you want.
Jeff looks at him with loathing.
RED
See, I've got something you might
want to buy. Can't show you the
merchandise right now, but I can
describe it for you. About five-
five, hundred and fifteen pounds.
I'd say three, maybe four of that
is tits. Black curly hair
upstairs and down. Interested?
(CONTINUED)
58.
CONTINUED:
Jeff's anger bubbles over...
JEFF
You sonofabitch --
He advances toward Red. Billy and Earl grab him from
behind and tackle him to the ground. Billy drives a fist
into his kidney. Jeff gasps in pain.
Red nods impassively.
RED
Bring him up here.
Earl and Billy hoist Jeff to his feet and propel him up
the mound closer to Red.
From here, Jeff can see a small desert town spread out
below, as well as the highway leading through it. Red
gestures.
RED
Welcome to Brackett, Jeff. If
ever there was a two-bit shithole
in the middle of nowhere, this is
it. One gas station, a half-dozen
stores and a V.F.W. hall.
(pointing)
See that building?
Jeff follows his gaze.
RED
That's the bank. Brackett
Commerce Bank. You with me?
Jeff nods tightly.
RED
Then here's the drill. You're
gonna walk in there and tell the
manager you want an express wire
in the amount of $90,000 from your
account in Boston. Got your
wallet?
Jeff nods.
RED
You ask for the money in cash.
Small bills.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
59.
CONTINUED:
RED (CONT'D)
Today's payday at the copper mine,
so don't take any horsecock about
how they haven't got it. If the
manager gives you a hard time,
that's your problem. It's your
wife who's counting on you.
JEFF
How do I know she's still alive?
Billy slugs him in the gut again.
Jeff doubles over.
BILLY
Shut up.
RED
She's tucked away someplace safe.
You get her back as soon as we get
the money. Simple as that.
Jeff compresses his lips.
RED
Now a smart guy like you, you're
already thinking about calling the
cops, right?
Jeff says nothing. Red raises a hand-held CB to his
mouth. He keys the transmitter.
RED
(into mike)
Iron Man to Blacktop, let's open
the gate.
AL (V.O.)
(filtered)
Copy that, Iron Man.
Red turns back to Jeff.
RED
Like I said, Jeff, if you want to
call the cops, there's nothing I
can do. Hell, with the fire
you've got in your eyes right now,
I figure you're fixing on calling
the F.B.I., C.I.A. -- even the
82nd Airborne.
Jeff stares back.
(CONTINUED)
60.
CONTINUED:
RED
Problem is, you can see this town
for miles around. So ask
yourself: How's the law gonna get
here? They gonna fly in? Drive
in? Either way, we'll see 'em.
So let me be very clear: if we see
one unmarked car, one plane, one
human being who even smells like a
cop -- this deal is dead.
He tosses Jeff the binoculars.
RED
Now take a look at the building
with the flagpole.
Jeff hesitates, then raises the binoculars.
THROUGH BINOCULARS
The IMAGE SHIFTS, then STEADIES and FOCUSES ON a small
building with a police cruiser out front and a barely
legible sign: "BRACKETT SHERIFF." It's the police
station where Jeff filed the missing persons' form
earlier.
RED (O.S.)
There's exactly two cops in this
town. One of them's inside
pulling ass duty; the other's on
patrol in the foothills. Now a
minute ago one of my men called in
a non-injury accident on the I-40
connector.
Deputy Carver comes out of the building gulping down a
sandwich. He gets in the cruiser and pulls away, lights
flashing.
RED (O.S.)
It'll take that good ol' boy 20
minutes to get to the connector,
another 10 to see there's no
accident, and another 20 or so to
tool his way back. 50 minutes all
in.
The cruiser pulls away down the highway.
61.
JEFF
lowers the binoculars and looks at Red.
RED
That's your deadline. If for any
reason one of those cops pulls
into town before I'm looking at a
bag of money, your wife is dead,
you're shit out of luck and we're
gone for good.
He smiles at Jeff.
RED
See, that's why there's no risk to
us in this thing. You do the
legwork. We sit back, we watch,
we listen to our scanners, we
monitor you every step of the way.
If at any moment we don't like
something, we split. Period.
(beat)
Helluva lot safer than sticking up
7-11s, wouldn't you say?
They lock eyes.
Red tosses Jeff a Windbreaker.
RED
Put this on. You can't go into
the bank like that.
Jeff puts on the jacket.
It covers his filthy shirt.
Red checks his watch.
RED
How about it, Jeff? Time to get
the show on the road?
ON Jeff's expression...
CUT TO:
Jeff stumbles and nearly falls as he descends
the loose
rock at the foot of the mesa. He looks up at
the ridge,
but Red and his crew have pulled back out of
view. Jeff
starts across an open field toward the town,
first
jogging, then running.
62.
Jeff hurries toward the bank. He looks back at the mesa
again. The gang has disappeared.
Up ahead, a mud-streaked pickup cruises the main street.
Jeff eyes it warily. Is it one of theirs? The truck
pulls around a corner.
Jeff comes out of the bank with a manila envelope,
glancing up and down the street. There's no sign of the
men. He squints toward the mesa. No sign of them there
either.
He stands there. What's he supposed to do now? He
checks his watch, growing anxious. Finally he is about
to jog back in the direction he came, when... a PHONE
RINGS.
Jeff turns. There's a pay PHONE down the street. It
RINGS again. He approaches quickly, lifts the receiver.
JEFF
I'm here.
RED (V.O.)
(filtered)
No shit. I can SEE that.
How
much you got?
Jeff looks up and down the street, trying to figure out
where they're watching from. He looks toward the bank,
glimpses the manager peering through the window.
JEFF
The whole thing. Ninety thousand.
(CONTINUED)
66.
CONTINUED:
RED (V.O.)
(filtered)
Good. Turn left and start walking
toward the main road. Get in the
first car that stops.
JEFF
When do I see my wife?
RED (V.O.)
(filtered)
When I say so. Now walk.
The LINE CLICKS.
Jeff hangs up and starts walking.
CUT TO:
Jeff walks along the road, carrying the envelope.
Various cars pass in either direction, but none slow
down.
Jeff stiffens as an 18-wheeler approaches. But the TRUCK
THUNDERS past, blowing a cloud of dust and sand in his
face.
Jeff continues walking, anxiously checking over his
shoulder every few moments. His eyes narrow.
The Dodge Ram pickup is cruising toward him. It slows,
then brakes to a halt. The passenger door opens. Earl
sits behind the wheel, aiming an automatic pistol.
EARL
Toss the envelope on the seat.
(CONTINUED)
67.
CONTINUED:
Jeff stands firm.
JEFF
No.
First you tell me where she
is.
EARL
Wrong, asshole. First you give me
the money, then you find out.
Unless you want me to shoot you
dead right here on the highway.
Jeff looks around, wonders if Earl would risk shooting
him in view of passing traffic.
Jeff hesitates, then tosses the envelope on the
seat.
Earl opens it, reaches in and pulls out several
packets
of currency. They are wrapped with paper bands
and
appear to be stacks of fifties and hundreds. He
replaces
them and gestures at Jeff with the gun.
EARL
Now lift your shirt and jacket and
turn around.
Jeff complies. Earl sees that he isn't carrying a gun.
He beckons Jeff toward the truck with the automatic.
EARL
Turn around, hands behind your
back, and step toward the truck.
Jeff takes two backwards steps toward the passenger side
door. Earl grabs his arms, yanks roughly and wraps them
with several layers of duct tape.
EARL
Now get up in the truck, knees on
the floor. Do it now!
Jeff struggles into an awkward kneeling position on the
floor, facing the rear of the pickup, his belly pressed
against the seat.
Earl reaches over and pulls the door shut. He throws the
truck in gear and starts driving. Jeff grimaces, looking
up at him.
JEFF
I gave you the money.
Now let her
go.
(CONTINUED)
68.
CONTINUED:
EARL
'Let her go.'
Do I look like I
have her?
JEFF
What the hell --
Earl backhands Jeff against the passenger door. There is
a RINGING sound and Earl pulls a CELL PHONE from his
pocket. He presses a button and raises it to his face.
EARL
(on phone)
It's done. I'm heading in.
(a beat;
listening)
Gotcha.
He ends the call and tosses the cell phone on the dash.
EARL
You gotta be the dumbest
motherfuck yet. You think we
picked you out of the blue? New
car, Massachusetts plates --
probably be days before anyone
misses you. Hell, you shoulda got
the bumper sticker that goes with
it: 'Rich Assholes Looking for
Trouble!'
He tucks the pistol in his belt.
Jeff looks at him,
seething.
Jeff tries to squirm free. Earl sees it and belts him
across the temple. Jeff slams into the passenger door,
wincing.
EARL
I'd have loved to see the look on
your face when that car seized up.
(mimicking panicked
driver)
Help, help, I ain't got no power!
Earl laughs. Jeff has come to rest with his back against
the door. By contorting his arms, he is able to draw the
letter opener from his pocket.
He manipulates the letter opener into position and begins
cutting the duct tape that binds his wrists.
(CONTINUED)
69.
CONTINUED:
Steering with one hand, Earl reaches into the envelope,
pulls out a packet of bills and waves it in Jeff's face.
Jeff saws faster at the duct tape.
EARL
You know what I'm gonna do first
with your money, boy? Well, do
you?
Jeff glares at him.
EARL
(fluttering bills
under his nose)
I'll give you a hint. Only one
thing smells better than money.
You wanta guess what?
Earl laughs obscenely. He riffles the bills under his
nose again, then stops abruptly, frowning. He looks down
at the bills.
EARL
What the hell?
Earl stares at the bills. Jeff works feverishly behind
his back. Earl pulls out another packet, then another,
examining the bills.
EARL
These are... it's nothing but
singles...
(erupting)
You lyin' sonofabitch!
There is a RIPPING SOUND. Jeff wrests his hands free and
lunges across the cab. He plants the letter opener in
Earl's shoulder!
EARL
Aaagghh!
The pickup veers across the center line on the narrow
mountain road. It swerves back, over-correcting wildly,
and drifts for the opposite shoulder.
The pickup careens back and forth across the treacherous
roadway.
The PICKUP SCREECHES and comes to a halt straddling the
road.
The Two Truck Driver leaps out of the way as the pickup
surges forward, tires smoking. He stares open-mouthed
after the departing vehicle.
The Ram driving erratically and weaving back and forth
across the road.
As the Ram passes, Sheriff Boyd throws the cruiser into a
SCREECHING 180-degree turn. He flicks on the SIREN and
takes off in pursuit.
73.
The cruiser pulls up alongside the pickup...
The cruiser skids to a stop. Jeff leaps from the pickup
with the pistol in his hand. He rushes toward the
cruiser. Sheriff Boyd hops out, levels his service
revolver.
JEFF
I know where she is!
My wife!
SHERIFF BOYD
(ignoring him)
Drop the gun!
Jeff pitches the gun away and it skitters down an
embankment. He raises his hands.
JEFF
You don't understand!
She's been
kidnapped!
SHERIFF BOYD
I understand plenty. Now get down
on the ground or I'll shoot!
He means it.
75.
Jeff is spread-eagled on the ground. Sheriff Boyd calls
out to Earl in the cab. He keeps his gun leveled.
SHERIFF BOYD
You there -- in the pickup! You
all right? Can you get out?
EARL
Yeah! Just don't shoot me,
officer! He's crazy, I tell you!
SHERIFF BOYD
Well, get out dammit!
JEFF
Officer, please. You gotta listen
to me --
SHERIFF BOYD
(glances down
at Jeff)
Shut up.
(to Earl)
C'mon out, sir. It's safe --
Earl sets one foot on the road. The headrest dangles
against his back, still taped to his neck. Suddenly Earl
whirls, holding a .22 snub-nose REVOLVER and FIRES!
The sheriff stumbles away, blood spurting from his
shoulder, the gun flying from his hand.
Jeff looks up in horror as the sheriff falls.
(CONTINUED)
76.
CONTINUED:
Earl comes around the pickup after Jeff, raising the gun
to fire. Jeff scrambles to his feet and dives down the
embankment.
Earl runs to the edge of the embankment. Down below,
Jeff is reaching for the automatic pistol the sheriff
ordered him to drop.
He finds it... too late...
Earl is aiming at point-blank range from the top of the
embankment. He is already squeezing the trigger when...
BLAM! Earl's chest erupts outward as a bullet passes
through his body from behind!
Earl staggers and flops down the embankment. He comes to
rest near Jeff, blood gurgling from a massive chest
wound.
Jeff climbs the embankment. The sheriff is lying on the
road, critically injured, gun lying nearby and still
smoking from the shot that killed Earl.
The sheriff is struggling to speak into a remote
transmitter strapped to his uniform.
SHERIFF BOYD
(weak)
Shots fired... Officer down...
Suspect...
DISPATCHER (V.O.)
Help is on the way, Sheriff. Just
hang on. I have units and an
ambulance en route.
Jeff bends over the Sheriff and examines his wound with a
grimace. He is verging on unconsciousness. Jeff
deliberates, torn. There is nothing he can do here.
Making up his mind, Jeff runs to the pickup. The hand-
held cellular phone has spilled into the road. He scoops
it up, jumps behind the wheel and LAYS RUBBER.
CUT TO:
Jeff stands on a ridge overlooking a Texaco truck stop.
Behind him, the Dodge Ram pickup lies hidden in a growth
of scrub oak and tumbleweeds.
Jeff looks overwhelmed by what he sees spread out below.
77.
JEFF'S POV - TEXACO TRUCK STOP
It's a giant truck stop. There are hundreds of big rigs
parked in rows like silvery sardines.
A sign towers over the main building:
"DIESEL $.99 GAL."
BACK TO JEFF
He looks shaken. How will he ever find Red here?
It
seems impossible.
He descends the bluff to the truck stop.
Jeff skids on his heels down the loose hillside and
reaches the edge of the parking lot. There are trucks
everywhere. Diesel MOTORS RUMBLE. Exhaust fills the
air.
He reaches the end of a row of big rigs, starts searching
the grounds for the markings of Red's 18-wheeler.
It's nowhere in sight.
A high-pitched FEMININE SQUEAL from an adjacent truck's
sleeping compartment startles Jeff.
TRUCKER (O.S.)
(muffled)
C'mon, baby, give it up!
The woman GIGGLES, O.S. Jeff ignores it, scanning the
truck stop. He stiffens.
A police car is arriving at the truck stop.
Staying out of sight, Jeff passes quickly to the rear of
a tractor trailer.
Jeff peers out from behind a parked mini-van as trucks
emerge wet and dripping from an immense truck wash.
Across the way, trucks are filling up on diesel at the
gas islands. Jeff's eyes narrow. Is that Red's
Peterbilt among them?
He quickens his pace, then falls back, slumping. The
rig's black driver is getting in the cab. Jeff glances
to the side, frowns.
(CONTINUED)
78.
CONTINUED:
An older vacationing couple is eyeing Jeff warily.
Jeff looks down, cops to it instantly. His clothes are
ripped, caked with blood. He ducks between two parked
cars, using a side-view mirror as he hastily wipes blood
off his face. He checks to be sure no one is watching.
Something catches his eye.
A highway patrol car with flashing lights is parked near
the place where Jeff ditched the pickup. Beside it, a
state trooper surveys the truck stop with binoculars.
Jeff's jaw tightens. He glances toward the road, sees
two more highway patrol cars cruising the perimeter of
the truck stop.
Swearing, Jeff turns on his heels and walks away in the
opposite direction, shielding his face.
Jeff emerges from between two vehicles, glancing over his
shoulder nervously. He keeps his head down, moving fast.
He scans the truck stop in all directions. The patrol
car is still parked on the ridge, the patrolman peering
through binoculars.
Jeff quickens his pace alongside the truck stop building,
passing a row of pay phones. He looks up, stops dead.
Red is talking on a pay phone six feet away.
Jeff stares. Red is facing away, unaware of his
presence. Jeff darts into an adjacent pay phone.
He shields his face with the receiver and listens.
RED
(on phone)
I don't know, dammit, he was
supposed to be here a half hour
ago. There's reports on the
police band about a cop down and
this place is crawling with
uniforms...
(CONTINUED)
79.
CONTINUED:
Red waits, listens.
RED
Look, I'm getting out of here.
Stay off the airwaves. Bring the
girl and meet me at the barn...
You got that?
He hangs up.
Jeff presses the phone against his face and
turns away.
When he looks up, Red is walking toward his Peterbilt
truck, parked in a row of big rigs. Jeff starts to
follow, then freezes.
Several cops are fanning out on foot, questioning
everyone they encounter.
Jeff sees Red getting into his truck. The ENGINE KICKS
OVER. The BRAKES HISS and the truck begins pulling out.
Jeff whips around. The older vacationing couple are
talking to a cop fifty yards away. The husband points
toward the pay phones.
Jeff makes a sudden decision, doubles back behind a
rolling farm truck.
COP
thanks the couple, calls out something to his fellow
officers.
JEFF
runs alongside the farm truck, using it as a shield. He
overtakes the truck, cuts across its path. The farmer
BLARES his HORN.
Jeff glances left. Red's tractor trailer is traveling
across the crowded parking area, slowly gaining speed.
Jeff sprints in front of a moving car.
The driver jerks to a halt and HONKS, catching the
attention of a nearby cop. Jeff quickly turns away,
avoiding being seen.
Red's 18-wheeler turns toward the access road. Jeff
looks around, panicked. More cops are spreading out on
foot. They'll notice him any second.
(CONTINUED)
80.
CONTINUED:
Jeff crouches low and scurries underneath a slow-moving
postal truck. The truck speeds up, nearly crushing him
under the rear wheel assembly.
Jeff rolls out of the path of the giant wheels, gets to
his feet on the other side and finds himself...
... in the path of another huge truck!
A cop is standing only 20 feet away! Jeff goes
underneath another trailer, crawling between the moving
wheels. He springs to his feet.
Red's Peterbilt is pulling away!
Jeff runs for all he's worth. His arms and legs pump
furiously. He runs abreast of the truck...
... and seizes the spare tire mount!
Jeff hangs on for dear life. His legs drag over the
asphalt. He lets out a cry of pain.
The truck is joining the highway, accelerating.
Grimacing, Jeff swings his legs over the universal joint
as the roadway races past below. The huge TIRES are a
HOWLING blur.
Suddenly his grip falters on the grease. His back
scrapes the rushing asphalt. Jeff gasps, makes a grab
and holds firm.
As he hangs on, a station wagon overtakes the Peterbilt
in the passing lane. A three-year-old boy sits in the
rear compartment, staring out at Jeff, a puzzled
expression on his face.
Jeff stares back. It's an odd moment between the two.
The station wagon continues forward and EXITS FRAME.
The PETERBILT THUNDERS over a patch of highway that is
being graded for paving.
81.
The tires kick up a hail storm of loose gravel and dirt,
pelting Jeff all over his body.
He realizes he can't stay where he is. Grunting with
effort, he works his way hand over hand along the
underside rigging toward the cab.
He seizes the trailer hitch and hoists himself up.
Standing on the coupler, Jeff clutches his ribs and
catches his breath. He's in pain. The road whips by
below his feet.
The truck hits an uneven stretch of road and bounces
violently. Jeff grabs the coiled brake line for support.
The truck is doing 70 mph, exhaust racketing.
Jeff pulls the cell phone from his pocket and dials 911.
He holds it tightly to his ear, shouting above the wind.
JEFF
(on phone)
Hello? Can you hear me? This is
Jeff Taylor. I need to talk to
the deputy.
He strains to hear the reply.
JEFF
The name is Jeffrey Taylor. I
just witnessed your sheriff being
shot. Now put someone on,
goddammit!
He waits.
Jeff clutches the cell phone to his ear, waiting.
He
reacts suddenly as the call is put through.
JEFF
Hello?
INTERCUT WITH:
82.
The truck streaks along the interstate.
Sitting on the
coupler, Jeff is a picture of despair.
DISSOLVE TO:
Hours later.
The truck races toward the bloated lowering sun, with no
sign of slowing down. Jeff lies curled under the
windfoil on the roof of the cab. He hugs himself,
shivering in the cold draft.
DISSOLVE TO:
The TRACTOR TRAILER RUMBLES in low gear along a sparsely
populated two-lane road. A neighborhood DOG YAPS.
From his hiding place under the windfoil, Jeff peers out
into the darkness, unable to figure out where he is.
He catches his balance as the truck turns a corner and
slows, driving past a tract of undeveloped land, before
turning into the driveway of a...
and braking to a halt under the broad overhanging eave of
an old dilapidated barn.
(CONTINUED)
83.
CONTINUED:
Behind the two-story farm house, a rusted Volkswagen bus
and satellite dish hunker in the weeds. A newer car, a
1981 Cadillac Deville, is parked to the side.
Red kills the engine and climbs out of the cab. As he
walks toward the house, a screen DOOR SLAPS. DEKE, 9,
squirts across the lawn in his pajamas.
DEKE
Daddy, you're home!
Red scoops him up.
RED
Hey, Deke, you miss me?
ARLEEN, 35, comes out of the house in a bathrobe.
ARLEEN
Deke, get back to bed! I said
now!
(to Red)
Warren? I thought you were coming
back next week.
She comes out into the yard.
Jeff flattens against the sleeper. He can see Red
greeting his wife, their words carrying faintly across
the lawn. Jeff is baffled by this domestic scene.
Arleen reacts with disappointment to something Red's told
her.
ARLEEN
... but it's four in the morning.
Why can't Al and Billy come some
other time?
RED
(reasoning)
I told you, we've got some stuff
to take care of. Won't be more
than a couple of hours -- I
promise.
Red turns to his son, extends a key.
(CONTINUED)
84.
CONTINUED:
RED
Say, Deke, how 'bout opening up
the barn for your daddy?
Deke takes the key and sprints for the barn while Red
returns to the cab, passing within several feet of Jeff's
hiding place.
He reaches into the cab, brings out a duffel bag and
unzips it. Jeff keeps his breathing shallow, squeezes
against the windfoil.
RED
Deke, c'mon over here, I got
something for you.
Deke runs up, breathless. Red holds two hands behind his
back. Red and Deke are just six feet from Jeff.
RED
Guess which hand.
DEKE
(pointing to
right hand)
This one.
Red opens his right hand.
Empty.
RED
Nope.
Try again.
DEKE
(pointing to left)
This hand.
Red opens his left.
Empty.
RED
Nope.
DEKE
(he's been
tricked)
Dad...
RED
(laughing)
Okay, okay, I'll give it to you.
He opens his hand, revealing Jeff's Swiss Army knife.
DEKE
Cool!
(CONTINUED)
85.
CONTINUED:
Deke takes the knife and runs off. Red goes to the rear
of the trailer, unlocks it and raises the slatted door.
He hops up inside. His FOOTSTEPS ECHO in the metal
trailer. We hear him SHIFTING BOXES.
Jeff seizes his chance. He crawls out from under the
windfoil and hoists himself onto the overhanging eave.
The STRUCTURE CREAKS under his weight.
INSIDE TRAILER
Red sticks his head out of the trailer, puzzled.
RED
Deke?
Deke, you back there?
Jeff crouches in the shadows. He can see Red poking his
head out from the trailer, peering up at the roof.
INSIDE TRAILER
Red shrugs, lets it go. He resumes unloading boxes,
tosses down a full set of Louis Vuitton luggage. He lugs
the items into the barn.
Jeff goes to a second-story window. A board has been
nailed over the window. He pulls it away, steps into...
Red looks up from toting a box of car stereos and snarled
wiring as the moving van and Pontiac Firebird arrive at
the barn.
He beckons for the vehicles to pull forward into...
Jeff climbs out of the window onto the broad overhanging
eave. He steps to the edge of the roof and lowers
himself onto the Peterbilt cab, then drops to the ground.
He looks around. Red's is the only house visible. A
light flickers in the trees a mile away. It could be
anything.
Jeff moves toward the house.
Jeff holds the gun ready as he eases open the screen
door. The DOOR CREAKS on its hinges. Jeff steps into...
Jeff trains the pistol as his captives stand at the
entrance to the barn. He glances around, keeping an eye
out for Billy.
JEFF
(to Red)
Okay. Reach into your pocket and
hand the key to your wife.
RED
This ain't gonna work, boy.

JEFF
(jams pistol
at him)
Do it.
Red fishes a key ring out of his pocket and extends it to
Arleen. She just stands there.
RED
It's okay, Arleen.
Take it.
She takes the keys.
JEFF
(indicating
barn door)
Okay, now unlock it.
Arleen inserts a key, opens the padlock.
JEFF
Good.
Now give me the keys.
(turning to Deke)
Deke, push the door open.
Quickly.
Deke looks at his father. Red nods.
Deke goes to the
door, begins wheeling it open.
JEFF
That's enough, Deke.
(gesturing them
inside with gun)
Let's go. Move it.
Jeff herds all four into --
The first rays of sunlight are beginning to poke over the
horizon.
Jeff wheels the barn door shut and locks it.
He sees Amy
running toward Red's house.
JEFF
Amy, no!
It's not safe --
AMY
(turning)
But there's a phone inside.
We
have to call the police.
(CONTINUED)
101.
CONTINUED:
JEFF
One of them's still loose.
C'mon
-- this way!
It's too much to explain. Jeff grabs her arm. As they
take off running toward the light flickering in the
distance.
REVEAL BILLY
lurking in the shadows at the corner of the barn,
watching.
Jeff and Amy are tiny figures sprinting across the flat
terrain, illuminated by the red glow of a rising sun.
CUT TO:
The morning sky is lighter now.
A rickety trailer surrounded by a chicken coop, junked
appliances and a clothesline. There's an old utility
pickup truck parked in front. Jeff and Amy arrive out of
breath. Jeff pounds on the door.
JEFF
Hello?
Hello?
Anybody home?
There's no answer. Jeff puts his shoulder to the door
and rams it open. The flimsy door gives way easily.
Police cars and official vehicles are parked outside the
house. RADIOS CHATTER. Yellow crime tape holds back
onlookers and news reporters.
Cops and evidence technicians work the scene. A
criminalist photographs stolen property as it's carried
out of the barn.
A plainclothes FBI AGENT closes a cellphone and walks
over to where Jeff and Amy are sitting at a picnic table.
They are battered and bandaged.
JEFF
How's the sheriff?
FBI AGENT
Out of surgery. It looks like
he's gonna make it. As for the
wife and kid, she's not talking,
he's being turned over to
Protective Services.
Jeff nods soberly.
FBI AGENT
We've got I.D. on the dead
suspects. Turns out they were all
licensed truckers. One of 'em had
a rap for check kiting. Otherwise
they could've been model citizens.
JEFF
What about the leader?
FBI AGENT
Same thing. His real name's
Warren Claney. Three speeding
tickets in five years -- apart
from that, he's clean as a
whistle.
Amy watches as cops stack windshields outside the barn.
AMY
(dazed)
How could they do it? How could
they treat it like a... business?
FBI AGENT
(shaking his head)
I don't know. I've been doing
this 15 years, I've never seen
anything like it.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
117.
CONTINUED:
FBI AGENT (CONT'D)
It was simple, efficient and
organized. They stayed on the
move, spread it over a dozen
states. As long as no witnesses
survived, it's an untraceable
crime.
(looking at them)
You were just a couple of the
lucky ones.
Up ahead, a television news helicopter is landing on the
road. A cameraman, reporter and producer hurry over.
Jeff watches the news crew, a bemused expression.
It
seems like a million years ago...
The FBI Agent shakes his head, disdainful.
FBI
(re: media)
C'mon -- let's get you folks out
of here before things really get
hairy.
He escorts them to a waiting sedan. As they climb in,
Jeff looks back over his shoulder, surveying the scene
one last time.
He gets in and the car pulls away just as the frenzied
news crew arrives, mikes and cameras at the ready,
running alongside the departing sedan, shouting
questions.
Through the rear window, we see Jeff putting his arm
around Amy, pulling her close as we hear:
AMY
Promise me one thing...
JEFF
Name it.
AMY
Next time... we fly.
Over this last line, the sedan drives away, and we CLIMB
HIGHER and HIGHER AWAY FROM the bristling crime scene
until the ranch house is just one in a town of modest
houses and the pink desert floor spreads out endlessly in
every direction.
FADE OUT.
