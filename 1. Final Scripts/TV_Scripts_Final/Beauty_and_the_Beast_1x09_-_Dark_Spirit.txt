                                    ACT ONE



FADE IN

THE NEW YORK SKYLINE AT NIGHT

The city at her proudest, adorned with the jewelry of
glittering lights. As CAMERA PULLS BACK, we discover her
opulence is merely the million dollar backdrop to:


INT. CHIC MANHATTAN PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

where a black-tie soiree is in progress. Servants circulate among the
well-heeled guests, proffering delectables on silver trays. CAMERA
FOLLOWS a tray to a cluster of people gathered near a lacquered
piano. ROGER HARDING, tall, dark and corporate, helps himself to an
hors d'oevre and turns to WILLIAM TOUSSANT, 50, the evening's host.
MIRIAM HARDING, Roger's sequined wife-ornament, listens with cocktail
party intensity.


                                      ROGER
                  I've got to hand it to you, old man.
                  That leveraged buy-out was a
                    brilliant maneuver.

                                        TOUSSANT
                                      (modestly)
                    I happened to be at the right place at
                  the right time.

LINDSEY WELLER, an exotic young woman in a slim black dress,
approaches and hands Toussant a drink.

                                        TOUSSANT

                    You're an angel.
                      .

He smiles at her, seems glad to have her near.

                                        MIRIAM
                  Don't be so modest, William.
                    What's your real secret?

                                        TOUSSANT
                  You know I never kiss and tell.

                                        ROGER
                    Forbes is calling you one of the most
                      successful entrepreneurs of the
                    decade.

A white-jacketed black servant, HECTOR OCALA, materializes at
Toussant's elbow. He speaks with a slight accent.

                                        OCALA
                      Dinner is served, sir.

                                          TOUSSANT
                    Thank you, Hector.
                      (with a gracious gesture
                        to his friends)
                    Shall we?

The guests begin to move towards the dining room.Toussant
follows them, taking a nervous gulp of his drink.

                                                                DISSOLVE TO:


INT. PENTHOUSE DINING ROOM - LATER

As the servants pour coffee and serve brandy, CAMERA PANS around
the table, picking up snatches of after-dinner conversation. An
older guest, ARTHUR MARCH, chats with his companion.


                                          ARTHUR
                    It's a legitimate write-off, even
                    under the new laws. Wouldn't you
                      agree, William?

Heads turn to Toussant, but he doesn't respond. A light sweat dots
his brow, and he looks pale. Suddenly aware that a response is
required, he snaps back to reality, trying to compensate for having
tuned out.

                                          TOUSSANT
                      You're absolutely right.

                                          ARTHUR
                                        (jovially)
                    It happens occasionally.

Arthur turns away, and Toussant leans over to Lindsey, seated to
his right.

                                                                  CONTINUED                                                                              3.

                                      TOUSSANT
                  Is it hot in here?

                                      LINDSEY
                  I don't think so.

                                      TOUSSANT
                  I'm burning up.

He takes a sip of brandy, then suddenly stares transfixed at the
glass.

                                      TOUSSANT

                  My God -

TOUSSANT'S POV

The brandy glass in his hand is crawling with a black mass of
beetles and vermin.

RESUME

Toussant stares horrified at the glass -- which, in this angle,
contains nothing more than a splash of gold liquid. He begins to
tremble.

                                      LINDSEY
                  Are you all right?

TOUSSANT'S POV

The bugs have started to crawl onto his hand.

                                      ROGER (O.C)
                  I'd like to propose a toast.

CAMERA TILTS to Roger, whose face and voice are ominous and
distorted.

                  . ROGER
                  To our gracious host -

CAMERA SWINGS BACK to the brandy glass. The bugs are
now on Toussant s arm, on his jacket --


ON TOUSSANT

He leaps from the table and throws the brandy glass against the wall
behind him. The guests are stunned, not seeing what he sees                                                                                    4.

                                          TOUSSANT

                    Stop it!

He wriggles and writhes, struggling to brush the imagined bugs
away. To those on this side of reality, his thrashing resembles a
bizarre, violent seizure. The guests start to get up and back off,
alarmed. Emily Post doesn't have rules for this one. Roger moves to
help Toussant.

                                        ROGER
                      What's wrong?

                                          TOUSSANT
                            (pure terror and paranoia)
                    He's here!

                                          ROGER
                              (restraining him)
                    Just sit down and relax.

                                          TOUSSANT
                      He'll kill me! He'll kill all of you!


                                                .
He breaks loose and dashes from the dining room into


INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Toussant stumbles across the living room as if grappling with an
unseen demon. The madness has overtaken him.

                                          TOUSSANT

                      Let me go!

Toussant struggles, choking, then as if thrown by his invisible
opponent,

hurles himself through the glass window, tumbling into black
oblivion.

Bathed in the sanity of daylight.                                                                                    5.



INT. JOE MAXWELL'S OFFICE - DAY

MAXWELL is behind his desk when CATHY enters.

                                          CATHY
                      You wanted to see me?

                      Got a case that's tailor-made for
                      you, Radcliffe. 'Wealthy

                      servant.'

                                front of her)
                      Park Avenue all the way.

                                          MAXWELL
                      The guy's name is Hector Ocala.
                      Police found the poison in his
                      room. And it's not the usual junk
                      off the streets, either. The lab
                      boys say it comes from Haiti.


                                          CATHY
                      Haiti?

                      Get this -- it's used in some kind
                      of voodoo ritual. Ocala's a self-
                      professed high poo-bah, or whatever
                      the hell they call 'em. His boss
                      left him fifty thousand dollars in
                      his will.

                      It sounds like this one's pretty well
                      sewn up.

INT. COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR - DAY

Cathy and BRAD PHILLIPS, 35, an overworked attorney from the
p.d.'s office who looks like he sleeps in his clothes, stride
down the hallway.

                                        BRAD
                    I'm telling you, he's in some
                    kind of trance.

                                        CATHY
                    Be serious, Brad.

They stop at a bank of vending machines.

                                        BRAD
                    I am! All he does is sit in a corner of
                    his cell and chant. He won't eat, he
                    won't sleep, he won't answer questions. .
                            (scanning the candy bar machine)
                    You got a quarter?

                              and handing him a quarter)
                    The last time I checked, "voodoo trance"
                    wasn't grounds for dismissal.

                                        BRAD
                    You put Ocala on the stand, and he's
                    just gonna babble.

                                        CATHY
                    This is the worst ploy for a
                      postponement I've ever heard.

He drops the coins in the slot and pulls the knob. Nothing
happens. Frustrated, Brad bangs on the candy machine. Still
nothing happens.


                                      BRAD

she heads off:

EXT. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - EST. SHOT - DAY


INT. ANTHROPOLOGY BUILDING LOBBY - DAY

Cathy checks the directory, then hurries to an elevator just as the
doors are about to close.


INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

Cathy squeezes into the crowded car. A few students hurry in after
her, and she bumps into a man in a tweed jacket.

                                      CATHY
                  Excuse me.

                                      MAN IN TWEED JACKET

                  My pleasure.


She glances up at him politely, then steals another look --
realizing she's wedged against one of the most dangerously
attractive men she's ever met. Though not classically handsome,
there is a brooding quality about him that is irresistably
compelling. At the moment, there is an amused twinkle in his
deep brown eyes. Cathy is suddenly aware of how close they're
standing. She glances away shyly.

       INT. ANTHROPOLOGY BUILDING ELEVATOR CORRIDOR - DAY

The elevator doors slide open. Cathy steps out, followed by the crowd
of passengers who quickly disperse. Trying to appear inconspicuous,
she casually glances back at her companion from the elevator -- whom
she catches stealing a glance at her before disappearing down an
adjoining corridor. Cathy approaches the information window.


                                                  CATHY
                              Can you tell me where Professor

                              Come.


      INT. ALEXANDER'S OFFICE - DAY

      Cathy steps inside. The office is dark, lined with book shelves.
      Eclectic curios are everywhere -- statues, dolls collections of
      shells, strands of beads.

                                                  CATHY
                              Professor Stone, I'm -

      She stops mid-thought, startled to find that the academician seated
      behind the desk is none other than the dark-eyed Adonis from the
      elevator.

                                                    ALEXANDER

                              phoned.

                                                  CATHY
                              I hope I haven't caught you at a
                              bad time.

                          Not at all. Sit down.

                          Haven't we met somewhere before?

                          Not officially.

                                                ALEXANDER

                        So what can I do for you, Cathy
                          Chandler?

                                              CATHY
                          I've been told you're an authority on
                            voodoo.

                                                ALEXANDER
                          I know something about it.

                                                CATHY
                          You spent five years in Haiti
                            studying the customs, and you
                          have a doctorate from Yale.

                                                ALEXANDER
                                                (impressed)
                          You've done your homework.

                                                CATHY

                          So have you.

  He studies her carefully, as if he can look into her soul.

                                                ALEXANDER
                          Why would a beautiful lady D.A. want
                          to know about voodoo?

                                                CATHY
                            I have a suspect who appears to be in a
                            trance. You're probably the only person
                          in New York who can tell me if it's a
                            put-on or not.

                                                ALEXANDER
                            Voodoo is a way of life for some
                            people.

  He gets up and paces, fiddling with some of the curios on the
    shelves. His words weave a spell.

                                                                        CONTINUED                                                                                        10.

                          you're on the inside, you're
                            protected. If you're on the outside,
                          you're the enemy.
                          Their gods and demons are everywhere.

                                      desk, fixing her with

                          They take all forms -
                          birds, clouds, beasts.


  Is it Cathy's imagination, or did he hesitate slightly before that
  last word?

                                              ALEXANDER
                          They see things where we see
                            nothing.

                          What do you mean?

  He picks up a shell from the desk.

                          What do you see?

                            A shell.

                          No. The key to the universe. A
                          beacon to the gods.

                          What a beautiful thought.

  She starts to give the shell back, but Alexander closes her hand
  around it, not taking his eyes off her. His hand lingers on hers a
  beat too long. His touch is magnetic.

                                                ALEXANDER
                          Keep it.

                          audience is so captivating. You're
                          probably bored stiff.

                          You're too polite. You didn't come here
                          for a seminar. You came here to ask a
                          simple question which I really can't
                          answer without more information.

                          Would you mind going down there
                          and having a look?

                          I was hoping you'd ask.

    Alexander's tone indicates he's interested in more than just the
    research value of the project. Cathy's smile indicates she doesn't
  mind.


    INT. VINCENT'S CHAMBER - DAY

  In the flickering candlelight, Vincent comforts Kipper, whose
    face is stained with tears.

                        It was only a dream. And dreams are
                          nothing to be frightened of because
                          they aren't real.

                          we wouldn't be human. But when we
                          face those fears, they go away. Do
                          you understand?

    Reassured, Kipper's heavy eyelids droop close.Vincent tucks a

  INT. JAIL CORRIDOR - DAY

    A GUARD leads Cathy and Alexander to Ocala's cell.

They reach Ocala's cell. Huddled in the corner is a pathetic
creature that rocks back and forth, chanting in a monotonous
drone.

He repeats it continuously, oblivious to their presence.

                        Hey -- you got company.

Continuing to chant, Ocala turns around, a shadow of his former
self. His face is ghastly and gaunt, his glazed eyes sunk deep
into hollows. Suddenly, the fire of recognition lights in his
eyes. He lunges at them, held back by the bars.

                                            OCALA
                        Beast!

  Alexander and Cathy shrink back instinctively, Alexander
  shielding Cathy.

                        Take it easy!

                        over.


ANGLE ON CATHY

  glancing back at Ocala, wondering what his words mean, as the
guard leads them away.                                                                                    14.


INT. ADJOINING CORRIDOR - LATER

Cathy and Alexander head for the exit.Alexander seems
  distracted.

                        It was an invocation against evil
                        spirits. Most of it was, anyway.

                            A hallucination. I didn't
                        like the sound of it at all.


                                            CATHY.

                        It's nothing for you to worry
                        about. All you need to know is
                        that, in this expert's opinion,
                        he's on the level.

Cathy looks concerned.


  EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

  Downtown ethnic. A cab pulls up in front of a store bearing the
  sign "The Magic Eye". Cathy hops out and heads inside. The street
  people stare at her as she walks by -- this isn't the usual haunt
of uptown girls.


  INT. MAGIC EYE STORE - DAY

  A boutique of the occult, selling everything for the do-it
  yourselfer, from crystal balls and manuals to candles, dolls,
  incense and amulets. Cathy approaches the girl behind the

                          Cathy Chandler. I'm with the
                          D.A. I'd like to ask you about
                          the Toussant murder.

                          I've already talked to the police.

                          We've come up with some new
                            information on our suspect.
                          It seems he practices a religion
                          called voodoo. I would imagine
                          you're familiar with it.

                          I tried to tell the police, but
                          they thought I was crazy.

                  He came in here desperate. He was
                    convinced this man who worked for
                  him - Hector Ocala had put him
                  under a curse. I thought he was a
                    refugee from Bellevue -- at
                  first.

                                                CATHY
                  What convinced you he wasn't?

                                      LINDSEY
                  His eyes. I've never seen anyone look
                          so frightened. He literally
                  begged me to help him.

                                      CATHY
                  Did you?

                    I tried, but I'm no expert. My
                    parents lived in Haiti when
                  I was a kid. I've seen some
                  of the rituals, but that's about
                  it. Everyone thinks I know more
                  than I do.

                  What happened the night of the

                    William phoned and insisted I
                  come to the party. It was as if
                  he thought my being there could
                    protect him from Ocala's power.
                              (sadly)
                  It didn't.

                      (the voice of reason)
                    Toussant was poisoned. He
                    didn't die from a curse.

                                        LINDSEY
                    That's what I keep telling

body, covered by a sheet, being wheeled out on a stretcher. She
hurries over to Brad Phillips, who stands near one of the medics.

INT. CATHY'S APARTMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

Twelve-hour exhaustion weighing on her shoulders, Cathy stops
outside the door to her apartment and digs through her purse for
her keys. She comes across the shell Alexander gave her. Smiling,
she opens the door and steps inside.                                                                              19.

INT. CATHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Dark. Cathy flips on the light. She freezes, shocked at
what she sees.


CATHY'S POV

Her apartment's been trashed in a deliberate, ritualistic way.
Pictures have been hung upside down, furniture has been turned
over. All the mirrors are shattered. There's a photo album on the
floor, its contents scattered everywhere. Cathy looks up to see her
name spray painted backwards in red on the wall.


ON CATHY.

as her eye catches something even more horrifying.


CATHY'S POV

Next to the writing on the wall is a primitive drawing of a
beast. It bears an uncanny resemblance to Vincent. As CAMERA
FOCUSES IN ON the drawing,

    Cathy, horrified, crosses to the spray painted icon and touches it.
    The red paint comes off on her hand, still wet, staining her
    fingers blood red. A NOISE from the balcony makes her look up
      quickly.


    CATHY'S POV

    Vincent gazes in through the french doors.


    CATHY

    jumps, startled at first by his appearance. Then, remembering who
    it is, she hurries onto

                      I've seen how they work.
                      Ocala was a powerful man, an evil
                      man. He has followers -they feed
                      off fear. His spirit is very much
                      alive.

                                          CATHY
                      What do they want from us?

                                          ALEXANDER
                      Plain and simple, we're being
                      blamed for his death. We're the
                      enemy, and they're going to make
                      us pay.

                                          CATHY
                      I don't scare easy.

                      I know. It's part of your mystique.

                              hair from her eyes)
                      So beautiful -- and so strong.

She blushes at the touch of his hand. Their eyes meet. Cathy can
feel her heart pounding. It's one of those moments when anything
can happen -- if she lets it. She doesn't.

                                          CATHY
                      It's getting late.

She starts to move away, but Alexander turns her towards him. His
grasp is gentle but firm.

                                          ALEXANDER
                      Have dinner with me tomorrow.

                          (almost a whisper)
                      Say yes.

There is something irresistibly seductive in his flashing eyes.
Cathy has no choice.

                                          CATHY
                      Yes.

      Cathy hesitates a beat, then takes the rose. She s

      INT. FATHER'S CHAMBER - DAY

      Father peruses one of the tomes from his library shelf.
      Vincent stands near. Father, answering Vincent's question,
      barely looks up, distracted by his own research.

                                                FATHER
                            It is known by several names --
                              chango, saneria, macumba, voodoo. It
                            is the national religion of Haiti,
                              though it's practice is strictly
                              against the law.

                                                VINCENT
                              Because it is dangerous?

                                                FATHER
                              Because people who control by
                              fear are dangerous.

      Father puts his book back and turns his full attention to
      Vincent, scrutinizing him carefully.

                                                FATHER
                              Why this sudden interest
                            in things that don't concern
                              you?

                                                              VINCENT
                              It's Catherine. Someone is trying
                              to harm her.

                            I'm not sure. That is why I must
                            go see Narcissa.

                                                FATHER
                            For what possible reason? I can
                            tell you everything you need to
                            know about such things.

                            in a make-believe world. She isn't
                            one of them, and she isn't one of
                            us. I don't even know how you would
                            find her.

                                              VINCENT

                            The way is dangerous. There is an
                            endless maze of tunnels down
                            there. You could be lost forever.


                                              VINCENT
                            The tunnels are my home, Father. I
                            could never be lost.

INT. D.A. COMPUTER ROOM - DAY

EDIE sits in front of her computer, tickling the keys.
Cathy is behind her.

                                      EDIE
                    These are your suspects in the
                    Levinson case. You want me to
                  run them for priors?

No Response.  Edie glances up, noticing that Cathy is staring

into space.

                    Earth to Cathy. Come in,

Cathy snaps to attention.

                      Sorry. Where were we?

                                      EDIE
                    That look can only mean one of two
                    things -- either he's tall, dark and
                    handsome, or you just won the lottery.

Disappointed, Edie turns back to her screen.


INT. TUNNEL DAY

Vincent makes his way down a deserted tunnel.He reaches what

    appears to be a dead end. Mustering tremendous strength, he
    begins to move the rocks that choke the end of the tunnel,
    creating an opening. As he disappears through it,

    INT. OLD TUNNEL - DAY

    Vincent makes his way through a dingy tunnel filled with water and
    cobwebs, evidence it hasn't been traversed in years. The distant
    rumble of the subway causes bits of gravel to shake loose. Vincent
    wipes the dust from his eyes and continues on. He steps out of the
    tunnel and into


    INT. CIRCLE OF THE ANCIENTS - DAY

    An ancient-looking rotunda, resembling the remnants of a Greek
    ruin. Vincent glances around. Along the perimeter of the rotunda,
    like spokes branching out from a wheel, are arched entries to a
    myriad of identical tunnels. Vincent sweeps away the loose gravel
    on the floor, revealing a faded painting of a star. He follows its
    top point to the mouth of one of the tunnels and disappears
    inside.


    INT. ROTUNDA TUNNEL - DAY

    A steep decline. Vincent makes his way carefully down the tunnel,
    bracing himself against the walls to keep from sliding. The way
    levels out and widens -- and Vincent sees:


    VINCENT'S POV

    a light flickering in the distance.


    RESUME

    Vincent continues, coming to a rickety bridge over what appears
    to be a bottomless drop. He crosses the bridge and enters:

  bottles filled with colorful liquids line the walls, giving the
  chamber the appearance of an apothecary shop. A car radiator steams
  in the corner, adapted to provide heat. Vincent approaches a table
  where NARCISSA, a small black woman sits, her back to him. She
  tosses out a handful of shells onto the table as if she were
    throwing dice. Her voice is flavored with a South Seas accent.

                          Welcome Vincent.

  She swings around. Her animated face is dominated by eyes
    brilliantly white with cataracts. Her vision is intuitive
    rather than ocular.

                                      There was a drawing on the wall -

                                                        NARCISSA
                                      Drawing is veve. It is used to
                                      summon the spirit. Bizago work for
                                      the spirit Baka. Guardian of the
                                      crossroads. Keeper of the dead.


                                                        VINCENT
                                              (anticipating the answer)
                                      And this Baka -- what does he look
                                      like?

                                                          NARCISSA
                                      A fierce beast -- like a lion.
                                      All who see him tremble. No magic
                                      is as great as Baka - no magic is
                                      as evil.

                                                          VINCENT
                                      Magic is a state of mind.

                                      Magic is power. Watch your friend,
                                      Vincent. Watch day and night. See that
                                      the magic doesn't touch her. Watch
                                      with your heart.

                                                          VINCENT
                                      There is no other way.

                      As Vincent thinks of Cathy,

                                                                                CUT TO:                                                                                          29.


        CATHY'S PICTURE

        Perfectly manicured female hands drop it into a metal pot. The pot
      is ringed by a circle of red candles. A male voice chants in the
        background, accompanied by the SOUND OF A RATTLE.

                                                  MALE VOICE
                                Ayida-wedo, ma deese des serpents,
                              Quand vous venez, c'est comme un coup
                              de foudre.

        The hands lower a snake, a mosaic of red and yellow markings on its
        side, into the pot. The chant is repeated.

                                                  MALE VOICE
                                Ayida-wedo, ma d'ese des serpents,
                              Quand vous venez, c'est comme un coup
                              de foudre.


        INT. PARKING STRUCTURE - NIGHT

      An underground garage. Cathy steps from the elevator and crosses
      to her car, gets inside. She begins to pullout when she feels
        something strange and uncomfortable. Concerned, she looks down -



        CATHY'S POV

        A large slimy snake, with the same red and yellow
        marking, has begun to wrap itself around her leg.


        ON CATHY

        She gasps and quickly slams on the brakes, sending the car into a
        spin. She throws open the car door. Adrenolin pumping, he grabs the
        snake and pulls it from her leg.


        ANGLE ON THE SNAKE

        It slithers down a drain in the garage floor and disappears
        from sight.


        CATHY

          Shaken, she sinks into the seat of her car and slowly catches her
          breath. FOOTSTEPS echo in the distance. Cathy quickly glances
          around, but it's too late. The receding footsteps have faded into
        silence.                                                                                        30.


    EXT. ELEGANT OUTDOOR RESTAURANT - NIGHT

    A romantic setting near the water. CAMERA PANS PAST the little
    white lights that sparkle in the trees to an intimate table shared
    by Cathy and Alexander. Cathy, dressed elegantly for evening, is in
    the middle of animated narration.

                                                CATHY
                            -- I heard footsteps, but it I
                            didn't see anyone.

                                                ALEXANDER
                            May I make a suggestion?

                                                CATHY
                            Please.

                                                ALEXANDER
                            Try the champagne.

                                                CATHY
                                        (taking the glass from him)
                              I guess I've been rambling on.

                                                ALEXANDER
                            It's all right.
                                    (putting his hand on hers)
                              You're safe now.

                                                CATHY
                                    (not referring to the case)
                            Am I?

                                                ALEXANDER
                                      (not referring to the case)
                            Not really.

    He reaches under the table and pulls out a box wrapped in
      distinctively Bloomingdale lavender and white.

                                                CATHY
                              What's this?

                                                  ALEXANDER.
                            An impulse. I went for a walk this
                              afternoon and saw it in a window.
                              I thought it would cheer you up.
                                      (as she opens the box)
                            You probably won't like it.

            Cathy lifts out a gossamer, shimmery white dress.

                                                                        CONTINUED                                                                                          31.

                                                ( overwhelmed )
                                It's beautiful. But I can't let
                                you do this.

                                                    ALEXANDER
                                Indulge me.

                                                    CATHY
                                  I don't know what to say.

                                                    ALEXANDER
                                Then we should dance.

        He pulls her onto the dance floor and holds her close.As they
          circle, Cathy begins to let down her defenses.

                                                    CATHY
                                I'm feeling so confused.

                                                      ALEXANDER
                                About what?

                                                    CATHY
                                About everything.
                                          (growing bolder)
                                About you. This whole thing has
                                  brought us together so quickly.

                                                      ALEXANDER
                                Then it hasn't been so bad
                                  after all.

                                                    CATHY
                                  Alexander -- there was a drawing on
                                  the wall of my apartment of a kind
                                of a -- creature.

                                                      ALEXANDER
                                  The beast. La bete noire. A
                                  god of great power. They say that
                                  those who master the gods are
                                  masters of the power.
                                        (noticing that Cathy is
                                        off balance)
                                  Are you all right?

                                                    CATHY
                                  Just a little dizzy. It must be the
                                  champagne. I wish I could stop
                                  thinking about what's happened.

                                                                            CONTINUED                                                                                            32.

                                Let me change the subject.

          Alexander tilts her chin up and kisses her gently. Their lips part
        -- and then are drawn together in a luscious, romantic kiss. As
          they embrace, CAMERA PULLS BACK, leaving them intimately entwined
        on the dance floor under the white lights, the crowning touch to a
          picture postcard of romance.


          EXT. CATHY~S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

          Alexander walks Cathy to the front door and puts his arms
          around her.

                                                      ALEXANDER
                                  You're sure you're going to be
                                  all right?

                                                    CATHY
                                  I'm sure.It was just the champagne.


                                  I could stay ---

          It's a tempting offer, but Cathy resists.

                                                    CATHY
                                  I'll be fine.

                                                      ALEXANDER
                                  You'll call me if you're not?

                                                      CATHY

                                  I promise.

          She kisses him lightly, knowing that saying good-bye is the
          only way to prevent herself from asking him to stay.

                                                      CATHY
                                  Thank-you.

                                  For what?

                                                      CATHY
                                  For giving me something else to
                                  think about.

                                                      ALEXANDER
                                    Good-night.

            CONTINUED

    Cathy closes the door. Alexander heads down the steps. CAMERA
    HOLDS on the greenery that lines the walkway, finding Vincent
    watching, carefully hidden. Stealthily, he moves to follow
    Alexander.


  INT. CATHY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

  CAMERA FOLLOWS a crack of moonlight that spills from the window
  to the bed, where Cathy tosses and turns, moaning softly as if
  haunted by a terrible dream. Her eyes flicker open as she
  comes to consciousness. Queasy, in a cold sweat, she reaches for
  the lamp next to the bed. She flips the light on and starts to
  lean back when her eyes widen with shock and terror.


    CATHY'S POV

    Furry black objects scurry across the bedclothes.Tarantulas
    Lots of them.


    CATHY

    jumps from the bed, choking down her horror. In a frenzy, she
    grabs the nearest loose object -- a heavy magazine from the
    night table. As she begins to swing at the spiders,

                                                                            CUT TO:


    A PICTURE OF CATHY SMILING HAPPILY

  The male voice chants calmly, counterpointing Cathy's frenzy.

  The pot, ringed with candles in orange skins, sits on a simply
    table. There are flowers to one side and a pile of coins-- the
    offering. This isn't Saturday matinee melodrama, but rather a
    study of the familiar made strange. A photograph of

    we've been hearing belongs to Alexander Stone, a rational, modern
    man practicing an ancient ritual.

                            I have seen you, Lord Baka.
                            I have seen you in her.

    Lindsey Weller steps into FRAME. She hands Alexander an opaque
    glass bottle, probably an old soda bottle. Alexander pours a clear
    liquid into one of the cups.

                                              ALEXANDER
                          You have made yourself known, and we
                            understand. We understand we must
                            return to you her life so that we may
                            increase in strength. Already your
                            magic is working on her.


    Lindsey hands him another bottle. He pours a liquid into the cup
    on the other end. The liquid is red.

A quiet KNOCK. Cathy, in her robe, hurries to the door and

He fills a cup with water, puts the tea bag in it, then takes a
  vial from his jacket pocket. He empties the vial into the tea and
  stirs it until it dissolves.                                                                                    36.

      behind him. Her eye falls on the shell on the table near the door.
      As she picks it up, a NOISE from the balcony catches her attention.
      She crosses to the french doors.

                                           EDIE
                                  I think you better sit down.

                                                      CATHY
                                      (confused and embarrassed)
                                  Leave me alone!

          Cathy rushes out of the computer room.


          INT. LADIES' ROOM - DAY

        Cathy bursts inside. Alone at last, she struggles to calm down.
        She takes a few deep breaths, concentrating on relaxing. Feeling
        a little better, she crosses to the sink and splashes cold water
        on her face. She looks up to grab a paper towel and glances at
        the mirror.                                                                                            41.


      CATHY'S POV

    Cathy's reflection gazes back at her -- but her face has broken out
    in ugly red welts. Horrified, Cathy lifts her hand to her cheek--



      ON CATHY

    Her skin is as clear as ever -- but her terrified expression
      indicates she's seeing something else.

                                                                            INTERCUT:

    VINCENT

    in a relapse of pain. Father tries to get him to
    swallow a tablet.

                                        FATHER
                        Take this.It will ease the pain.

                                      VINCENT
                                    (refusing)
                                  It won't help Catherine.
                                          (struggling to get up)
                                  I must go to Narcissa.

          He stumbles out.


            INT. CATHY'S CUBICLE - DAY

            Cathy hurries into the cubicle, looking down, trying to hide her
            face. Her hand shaking, she picks up the phone and dials.

                                                      CATHY
                                            (into phone, urgently)
                                    Professor Stone, please.
                                                (a beat)
                                  When do you expect him? This is
                                    Cathy Chandler. Tell him to
                                  call me as soon as he gets
                                    there -- it's an emergency.


            She slams down the phone. Maxwell's voice startles her.His
            manner is softer than normal -- he's clearly concerned.Edie
            Is with him.

                                                        MAXWELL
                                  You got a problem?
                                                                              CONTINUED                                                                                              42.


            CONTINUED

            Cathy fights to seem normal, though she can feel the rug of
            reality being pulled out from under her.

                                                      CATHY
                                  No.

            Maxwell doesn't budge.

                                                      CATHY
                                    Would you please let me get
                                  back to work?

                                                        MAXWELL
                                  The work can wait if there's
                                    something wrong.

                                                        CATHY
                                    There's nothing wrong!
                                      (the paranoia starting to show)
                                    Why is everyone so worried about
                                    me? I skipped lunch, so I'm a
                                    little shaky, that's all.

                                                        MAXWELL
                                    Why don't you take the rest
                                    of the day off?

                                                        EDIE
                                    That's an offer I couldn't refuse.

                                                        CATHY
                                      (trembling with anxiety)
                                    Can't you both just leave me
                                    alone?

        Maxwell and Edie exchange a look. Cathy, realizing the cracks in
        her facade have begun to show, takes another tact.


                                                        CATHY
                                    I guess you're right. I'm over-
                                    tired. I'll get a cab.

                                                        MAXWELL
                                    I'll have someone take you home.

                                                        CATHY
                                    No! I'll be fine.I'll check in
                                    later.

          She quickly gathers up her briefcase and coat and hurries out of
          the cubicle.                                                                                            .

      INT. OFFICE AREA - DAY

        Struggling to keep her eyes forward, Cathy makes the trek past the
        endless rows of desks. The secretaries and clerks stare at her as
      she passes, whispering and laughing. The whispers become louder and
          distinguishable.



      The laughter grows cacophonous and surreal. Cathy swings around
      to confront her persecutors, but instead of seeing the
        secretaries, she sees: .


        CATHY'S POV


      Huqe black ravens perched on the desks, cawing incessantly.


      ON CATHY


      The cawing continues, coming from all directions.  Unable to
      stand the din, Cathy starts to run.


                                                ALEXANDER'S VOICE
                            They feed off your fear -

                                              LINDSEY'S VOICE
                          It wasn't poison that threw him
                            through that window.


                                              SECRETARY #3 VOICE
                          Did you see her face?

                                                ALEXANDER'S VOICE
                            I would have been scared out of my
                            mind.


      The line between sanity and madness is all but obscured.


      EXT. CRIMINAL JUSTICE BUILDING - DAY


      Cathy hurries out of the building, and takes a deep breath. The
      fresh air seems to momentarily revive her. The hallucinations


                                                                                      CONTINUED                                                                                      44.

    have stopped. Spotting a telephone booth, she hurries over to it
    and steps inside. She drops the coins in the slot and dials.


                                              CATHY
                                    (into phone, urgently)
                          Is Professor Stone there yet?
                              (anxiety darkens her face)
                            Where is he?

    An impatient man taps on the glass of the booth. Cathy turns
    away, trying to ignore him, and faces the opposite direction.

                                              CATHY
                            I don't want to leave a
                            message! Just tell me
                            where he is!

    The impatient man taps on the glass again.Cathy looks around
    and gasps.


    CATHY'S POV

    The man's face is grotesquely distorted, covered with welts.


    CATHY

    chokes down a sob of horror and bolts from the phone booth,
    running recklessly into the street.


    INT. NARCISSA'S CHAMBER - DAY

    Vincent doubles over in sudden pain, clasping his head.
      Narcissa hovers near him.

      Cathy bursts in, pale, on the ragged edge.She flips on a
      light and hurries into:


      INT. BATHROOM - DAY

      where she gazes into the mirror.


      CATHY'S POV

      Her reflection stares back at her.  The welts have gotten
      much worse.                                                                                    46.


      RESUME

    Feeling totally out of control, Cathy breaks down, sobbing. She
    spots the shell and picks it up, clutching it tightly, fighting to
    hang on to a shred of sanity. She becomes aware of a familiar
      TAPPING. Distraught, she doesn't move. The TAPPING continues. Cathy
      starts for the living room.


      EXT. BALCONY - NIGHT

      Vincent waits.Cathy steps outside, crying.

      CATHY'S POV

      Vincent's face has become distorted, his hair matted, his
      features haggard like a death mask. His voice sound ominous and
      evil.

                                                  VINCENT

      Her expression is sheer terror.

                              You're doing this to me, aren't

CONTINUED

Vincent doubles over, stabbed not only be her words but by the
anguish his presence is causing her. He has no choice. Crippled
with pain, he crawls over the railing and disappears out of sight.
Cathy's sobs subside. Glancing down at the shell, she hurries
into:


INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Cathy rushes to the phone. Like an addict needing a fix, she
anxiously dials the number. Fidgeting with the shell, she waits
for what seems to be an interminable period of time. Finally
someone answers. The light of last hope dawns in her eyes.


                                        CATHY
                      Alexander?

FADE IN

INT. CATHY'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

An expensive silk dress is dropped in a heap on the floor. Another
is dropped on top of it. ANGLE WIDENS TO REVEAL Cathy standing in
front of her closet, methodically pulling each item out and letting
it fall at her feet. She isn't in a cliched zombi trance -- rather,
she works with a diligent, singleminded purpose, like a determined,
desperate child. At last, she comes to the beautiful white dress
Alexander gave her. Relieved, she puts it on the bed. She slips out
of her shoes and begins to change.



INT. ALEXANDER'S LOFT - NIGHT

Moonlight shines through the dramatic skylight.Stone opens
the door, admitting Lindsey, who seems nervous.

                                        LINDSEY
                      Where is she?

                                          ALEXANDER
                      She'll be here soon.

Lindsey looks at the altar. The set-up is more elaborate than
before -- there are more candles, and they're surrounded by
stones, beads and shells. There is also a crucifix, and a plate
heaped with fruit. The flowers and coins are where they were
before, as are the pictures of Toussant and Ocala.

                                          ALEXANDER
                                (sensing Lindsey's
                                  uneasiness)
                      What's the matter?

                                          LINDSEY
                      Nothing.

                                          ALEXANDER
                                  (intently)
                      She controls him, Lindsey. This
                      is the only way the power of the
                      beast can be returned to us. It's
                      the only way to make things the
                      way they were.

His sincerity is soul-piercing, his magnetism undeniable.                                                                                            50.




        INT. NARCISSA'S CHAMBER - NIGHT

        PAN from the shells on the table to Vincent and Narcissa.

                                                    NARCISSA
                              The shells have predicted it. It
                              is too late for your friend. The
                              magic has touched her.

                                                    VINCENT
                              You must come with me.

                                        (shaking her head)
                                Bizago magic is strongest at night.
                              Too strong for Narcissa.

                                                    VINCENT
                                But she needs our help.

                                                    NARCISSA
                                          (terrified for him).
                                You cannot go back. He knows you are
                                here, Vincent. The priest who serves
                                with his left hand.
                              He will steal your soul.

                                                    VINCENT
                                He can't hurt me if I'm not
                                afraid.

                                                    NARCISSA
                                    (offended at his heretical
                                      attitude)
                                No! Bizago magic is real! You
                                must leave now! Narcissa will not help
                                you!

                                Let me take the antidote with me.

                                                    NARCISSA
                                There is no antidote without magic!

                                                    VINCENT
                                Where is it?




                                                                          CONTINUED                                                                                      51.

                          He will steal Narcissa's soul!
                          You must leave!

                                              VINCENT
                                  (grabbing her by the
                                    shoulders)
                          Where is it?

  He follows her inadvertent glance to a silver vial on the counter
  and hurries over to it. As Vincent reaches for the vial, he
    accidentally knocks over a bottle. Its contents spill out,
    instantaneously igniting into a sudden fireball.

                                              NARCISSA
                                    (her worst suspicions confirmed)
                          He will not let you live!

    Vincent grabs the vial and hurries out.


    INT. ALEXANDER'S LOFT - NIGHT

  PAN ACROSS the flickering candles. Alexander pours the liquids
    into the bowls. Lindsey is nervous, but she goes along with
  it.


                                              ALEXANDER
                          Bizago brings joy, it brings peace.
                          Nous sommes les etoiles. Nous
                            travaillons dans la nuit, mais nous
                          sommes partout.

                          Le jour est la nuit
                          Le fin est le commencement.

                                              ALEXANDER
                          We sacrifice a life to free the
                          great and powerful spirit.
                          The spirit of Baka,
                          The spirit of the beast.

    CAMERA PANS across the altar, coming to rest on Cathy's picture,
    which leans against a black candle. Alexander's hands place a knife
    in front of it -- an ordinary hunting knife, rusted from use.                                                                                      52.


  INT. CATHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - ANGLE ON A MIRROR

  Cathy is now wearing the shimmery white dress. Her hair has
  been crimped, framing her face in waves. She leans into the
    mirror, and with that single-minded concentration, carefully and
    deliberately applies the final touches to her exotic-looking make-
  up, though her hands shake. Her lips are sensuously red; her eyes
  are dramatically highlighted with unusual colors. The effect is
    primitive and sensual. Satisfied with the result, Cathy turns off
  the light, moves quietly through the living room and slips out the
  front door.


    INT. OLD TUNNEL - NIGHT

    Vincent makes his way through the dark, narrow tunnel. The rumbling
  of the subway grows until it shakes lose a slide of rocks and
    gravel, knocking him to the ground. Bruised but undaunted, Vincent
    shields himself from the shower of stone and continues on.



    INT. ALEXANDER'S LOFT - DAY

    Alexander slides open the door. Cathy steps inside. She looks to
    him like a helpless child, dizzy and weak from the drug.

                                              CATHY
                                (a tortured plea)
                            Help me?

                                              ALEXANDER
                            I will.

                                              CATHY
                            I feel so dizzy.

                                              ALEXANDER
                            It's all right.


    CATHY'S POV

    She glances around the loft, startled by the strange sight of the
    candles and the altar.

                                              ALEXANDER (O.C.)

                            You're safe now.

    Cathy focuses on the pictures on the altar. They re blurry but
      distinguishable.
                                                                      CONTINUED                                                                                        53.

                          Relax.

    Cathy spots Lindsey and starts to realize that the pieces are
    coming together -- and something is very wrong.

    Lindsey approaches Cathy with a cup.

    In her drugged state, Lindsey looks distorted, menacing.


    RESUME

    Cathy, frightened, backs away.

                                                ALEXANDER

                            Lord Baka, she is here. We offer
                          her life to free your spirit so
                            that we may reign in power.


    RESUME

    Cathy, fighting to come out of her haze, knocks the cup from
    Lindsey's hand. Alexander grabs her and wrestles her towards the
    altar. Cathy kicks and struggles, but in her weakened state, she's
    no match for him. Alexander grabs for the knife. As his hand closes
    around its handle, there is suddenly a great SHATTERING OF GLASS.                                                                                        54.


    ANGLE ON THE SKYLIGHT

    Vincent crashes through it, rolling to safety on the floor.


  ON ALEXANDER AND CATHY

    Alexander's face blazes- with the wonderment of a true believer
    witnessing a miracle.

                                              ALEXANDER
                          Beast of the night!

    Vincent snarls, and Lindsey backs up in terror, knocking over the
    altar -- and knocking herself unconscious. The candles fall over,
    igniting the contents of the bowls, which instantly burst into
    flames. The fire spreads quickly.

                                              ALEXANDER
                          The power will be mine!

  He raises the knife aloft and is about to plunge it into Cathy.
    Cathy struggles valiantly, but it isn't a fair fight. With a fierce
    cry, Vincent lunges at Alexander.

    The fire has continued to spread, providing a hellish backdrop to
    their struggle. Vincent throws Alexander down -- and he falls on
    his knife. Vincent grabs Cathy, and they escape through the
    flames.

                          I'm sick of watching the Rangers
                            lose. Besides, it'll probably be
                          ten o'clock before I clean off my
                            desk.

                                Did you hear about the twist on the Ocala
                                case?

                                    There was a fire in a loft down in
                                    the village. Police found enough of
                                    that voodoo poison to wipe out half
                                    the neighborhood.

                                    Yep. It belonged to a Columbia
                                      professor -- Alexander Stone.
                                    Seems he was into all that voodoo
                                    hocus pocus.

            Cathy appears in the door, listening.

                                                        MAXWELL
                                    Hey Radcliffe -- how you feeling?

                                                      CATHY
                                    Great. You were right.
                                    I was overtired.

                                    How do they know for sure this
                                      professor killed Toussant?

                                                        MAXWELL
                                    Stone was a gonner when they got
                                    there, but his girlfriend confessed to
                                      everything before she cashed in.
                                    Toussant was a member of their merry
                                    band.
                                            (shaking his head)
                                    Can you believe it? A three
                                    piece suit like him?

                                                        CRONIE #2
                                    Why'd they kill him?                                                                                        56.

                            He got cold feet. Didn't like
                            what they were up to,
                            so he threatened to go to the
                            police. Stone had the girl
                            poison him and plant the
                              evidence on Ocala.

                            I tell ya, there are a lot of
                            wierd people into a lot of wierd
                            stuff in this town.

                            You're tellin' me.

      Cathy smiles in agreement, but her thoughts are far away.

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


    THE SHELL

      EXT. PARK RENDEZVOUS - NIGHT

      Cathy contemplates the shell.Vincent is at her side.

                                                CATHY
                                  (gazing at it thoughtfully)
                            How did he know, Vincent? How did
                            he know about you?

                                                VINCENT
                              Coincidence perhaps. He could
                            have seen. He could have
                              sensed.

                                                  CATHY
                              (agreeing with the last
                                    idea)
                            He did have incredible power.

                                                VINCENT
                              Fear is a powerful emotion. To
                              conquer it is the beginning of
                              wisdom.                                                                                      57.

                              I'm not afraid anymore.

      With all her might, she hurls the shell into the darkness.

                                                  CATHY
                              I want to pretend it never
                              happened.

                                                  VINCENT
                              The difference between fantasy
                              and reality is only what you
                              choose to believe in.

                                                  CATHY
                              I believe in you, Vincent.

      She smiles at Vincent, and they embrace. CAMERA PULLS back as they
      part. Vincent disappears into the mist.

                                                                        FADE OUT
