WAGON - DAY
Mist momentarily obscures a man's face.
Frozen breath.
The man is in his 20's, imperious and handsome.
He is
swathed in fur, only his face exposed.
He is COMMODUS.
He glances up.
COMMODUS
Do you think he's really dying?
The woman across from him returns his gaze evenly.
She is
slightly older, beautiful and patrician.
A formidable
woman.
She is LUCILLA.
LUCILLA
He's been dying for ten years.
COMMODUS
I think he's really dying this time.
A beat.
Their breath turns instantly to mist.
COMMODUS
He has to be bled every night now.
LUCILLA
How do you know that?
COMMODUS
I've been so informed.
She arches an eyebrow.
COMMODUS
If he weren't really dying he
wouldn't have sent for us.
LUCILLA
(a smile)
Maybe he just misses us.
COMMODUS
And the Senators.
He wouldn't have
summoned them if --
LUCILLA
Peace, Commodus.
After two weeks on
the road your incessant scheming is
hurting my head.
A beat.
COMMODUS
The first thing I shall do is honor
him with games worthy of his
majesty.
LUCILLA
The first thing I shall do is have a
hot bath.
The wagon rumbles to a halt.
Voices are heard outside.
Commodus leaps out...
HOSPITAL TENT - NIGHT
Maximus enters a large tent and is met by a spectacle of
the dead and dying.
Roman surgeons are working feverishly
to save lives.
Limbs are amputated, the bloody stumps
quickly cauterized with hot irons.
Leeches and bronze
cups are employed for blood-letting to balance "humours."
Anesthesia as we know it is nonexistent.
Wine amphoras
are passed around and orderlies fan narcotic smoke toward
the patients.
Mostly, though, they just hold down the
writhing patients.
Maximus moves through the tent, offering a word of comfort
here and there.
All the wounded are delighted to see him.
He goes to an older soldier, GALLUS, who has one wooden
hand.
His other hand is bandaged.
MAXIMUS
What, Gallus, losing your other
hand?
GALLUS
Aye, General, they're going to make
a bronze one for it.
Long fingers
this time.
MAXIMUS
And the women of your village will
crave your touch even more.
GALLUS
Ah, then you know the women of my
village.
Maximus smiles and moves on.
He stops at a young soldier, VALERIUS, whose head has been
shaved.
A hole has been bored into his skull to relieve
the pressure on his brain.
The young soldier is dying.
MAXIMUS
What's your name, son?
VALERIUS
Valerius, General.
MAXIMUS
The name suits you.
VALERIUS
Why am I dying?
A beat.
Maximus sits by his cot.
He takes Valerius'
hand.
MAXIMUS
You're dying because you love Rome,
as I do.
VALERIUS
I've never been to Rome.
MAXIMUS
Neither have I.
Rome for us lives
here...
(he touches his
heart)
... it's a thing inside us that came
from our ancestors and that we give
to our children.
VALERIUS
It must be glorious, Rome.
I've
only seen pictures.
Is it a
glorious place?
A beat.
MAXIMUS
Yes, it's a glorious place.
VALERIUS
It must be.
He smiles.
And he is dead.
Maximus sits for a moment.
He gently closes Valerius'
eyes.
And Maximus finds that he is weeping.
He is not ashamed of the tears.
MESS TENT - NIGHT
An immediate swirl of noise.
The grand mess tent is
crowded with soldiers.
They are still filthy with caked-
on mud and blood.
Wounds are bandaged and tankards are
raised in celebration of the victory.
Marcus sits in a central position and receives visitors.
Currently two Senators, FALCO and GAIUS, are bowing before
him.
FALCO
Hail, Marcus Aurelius.
MARCUS
Stand up, Senators.
That unfamiliar
posture doesn't suit you.
GAIUS
We live in supplication to your
glory.
MARCUS
All the while conspiring with that
fat man in Rome.
How is the old
monster?
GAIUS
Senator Gracchus is hale, sire.
MARCUS
Still damning me to the four winds?
GAIUS
Still eager for your triumphant
return to Rome, Caesar.
MARCUS
I would have silenced him decades
ago -- but I just like him too much.
Meanwhile, Maximus stands with his lieutenants, Titus and
Quintus.
A wound on Maximus' arm has been bound.
MAXIMUS
(to Titus)
If you want to stay on, I support
you.
So do the men.
I'll ask the
Emperor to appoint you in my place.
TITUS
It won't be the Felix Regiment
without you.
MAXIMUS
I'll return after a season at home.
Maybe two.
QUINTUS
That means after three or four more
babies.
TITUS
And you'll be too fat from Vibia's
cooking to get on your horse by
then.
MAXIMUS
Should the Gods so bless me.
I
would be thankful.
Commodus perambulates up to them.
COMMODUS
Hail, warriors.
My congratulations.
TITUS AND QUINTUS
(bowing)
Highness.
COMMODUS
(to Maximus)
My old friend, my father tells me
you're returning to Spain?
MAXIMUS
Yes.
COMMODUS
A pity.
I'll need men like you in
my army...
An awkward glance between the soldiers.
This sort of talk
is offensively premature.
COMMODUS
There are larger division that might
appeal to you.
Even the Praetorian
Guard.
You've never been to Rome.
Imagine arriving as head of the
Praetorians!
They have really
splendid uniforms.
MAXIMUS
(cold)
I'm going home.
Senators Gaius and Falco join them.
GAIUS
(to Maximus)
... And why not apply for entry to
the Senate?
FALCO
A war hero with a handsome face and
a strong heart could go far.
COMMODUS
General Maximus, may I present
Senators Gaius and Falco.
Beware of
this Gaius, he'll pour a honeyed
potion in your ear and you'll wake
up one day and all you'll say is
"Republic, Republic, Republic..."
Laughter.
FALCO
Have you never considered Rome?
MAXIMUS
No.
COMMODUS
You've had my ear since we were
children.
You could be a valuable
ally in the Senate.
GAIUS
Are you a believer in Republicanism?
COMMODUS
(laughs)
There -- I warned you.
MAXIMUS
I'm a soldier, not a politician.
Meanwhile, a dark eye is studying the men through a hidden
slit in the tent wall.
The eye is particularly drawn to
Maximus.
GAIUS
If your heart lies with the people,
I would back you for the Senate.
I'm sure Gracchus would as well.
COMMODUS
Not a word about that sodomite
bastard.
GAIUS
(smiles to Maximus)
The august Senator Gracchus has been
rather a gadfly on the flesh of the
imperial family.
FALCO
He's a damned provocateur.
GAIUS
He lives under the antiquated
assumption that the Senate should
represent the people with vigor.
COMMODUS
I won't tolerate it.
His incessant
criticism exhausts me.
The man can
speak for five hours without taking
a breath.
GAIUS
He serves Rome best when he serves
it with honesty.
COMMODUS
(sharply)
Enough... Maximus, I would like to
inspect the Felix Regiment at dawn.
Please arrange it.
MAXIMUS
I can't do that.
COMMODUS
Excuse me?
MAXIMUS
My men have been fighting for five
solid days.
They're too busy dying
to go on dress parade.
A beat.
Commodus' eyes flash fire at this public rebuke.
He very quickly gets control.
COMMODUS
(smiles)
Of course, how foolish of me.
Some
other time...
He notes his father being helped out of the tent by
several body slaves.
COMMODUS
Caesar retires early tonight.
TENT CORRIDOR - NIGHT
Marcus is helped out of the mess tent into a tent corridor
attached.
He sees his daughter Lucilla in the corridor, spying in
through the slit in the tent wall.
He watches her,
smiles.
MARCUS
If only you had been born a man...
She turns to him.
He leaves his body slaves and goes to
her.
LUCILLA
Father.
MARCUS
What a Caesar you would have made.
LUCILLA
You're right.
MARCUS
I think you would have been strong.
I wonder if you would have been
just?
LUCILLA
I would have been what you taught me
to be.
A beat.
They stare at each other.
He finally smiles.
MARCUS
Well, pretend to be my loving
daughter tonight and walk with me to
my chamber.
She smiles and takes his arm.
They slowly walk down the
tent corridor as:
MARCUS
This is a pleasant fiction, isn't
it?
They disappear into darkness.
MARCUS' TENT - DAY
Maximus enters Marcus' darkened tent.
Flickering braziers
provide the only light in the enormous Imperial tent.
Heavy beams support the canopy and they creak like the
timbers of a ship as the tent sways slightly in the wind.
Marcus stands before a map of the Roman Empire.
MAXIMUS
(bows)
Caesar.
Marcus holds out a scroll.
MARCUS
Read this.
MAXIMUS
I never acquired the art, sir.
MARCUS
Of course.
No matter.
In this
letter I denote my intention to
nominate you to stand for the
Emperorship after my death.
A stunned pause.
Maximus stares at him.
MARCUS
My son is not a moral man.
You have
known this since you were young.
He
cannot rule.
MAXIMUS
Caesar, I am honored but --
MARCUS
For twenty years I have been
spilling blood.
For twenty years I
have written philosophy and
ruminated and conquered.
Since I
became Caesar I have only had four
years without war.
Four years of
peace in twenty.
So perhaps I can
be... forgiven.
A long beat.
MARCUS
While I have been fighting, Rome has
grown mad and corpulent and
diseased.
I did this.
And now I
shall make it right.
MAXIMUS
Sire, you brought the light of the
Gods to barbarian darkness.
You
brought civilization and justice to
the farthest --
MARCUS
(fierce)
I have brought the sword -- nothing
more!
Rome is far away and we
shouldn't be here.
What matter is
it to the Gods if we subdue one more
tribe of Parthians or Gauls?
What
matter is it to Rome if a thousand
more barbarians bend to our lash?
A beat.
Marcus sits.
He doesn't look at Maximus.
A pause.
MARCUS
Winter, Maximus.
It's winter now...
A beat.
MARCUS
There was a dream that was Rome.
I
can only whisper of it now.
Anything more than a whisper and the
dream vanishes.
It's so... fragile.
The true glory of Rome is in a very
fragile idea.
Imagine a place
devoted to the rights of the
citizen.
Where every free man has a
voice.
That was the dream... And I
fear it will not survive the winter.
He holds out a hand to Maximus.
Maximus takes his hand,
deeply moved, kneeling.
MARCUS
Let's just whisper here, you and I.
MAXIMUS
Yes, Caesar.
MARCUS
If the dream is ever to live again
the people must have a true voice.
The voice I took from them.
That
all the Caesars took from them, bit
by bit, conquest by conquest.
And
now that I am dying I am going to
give them that voice again.
MAXIMUS
You're not dying.
MARCUS
I am, Maximus.
It's strange... I
find as I near the end I think
little of the waning moments around
me... instead I think much of the
past... and of the future.
How will
the world speak my name in years to
come?
Will I be known as the
philosopher?
The warrior?
The
tyrant?
Or will there be a more
golden sounding to my name?
Will I
be the Emperor who gave Rome back
her freedom?
A beat.
MARCUS
Before I die I will give the people
this final gift.
I will give them
the Senate reborn.
The voice of the
people empowered again, as it was
always meant to be.
It is my design
that they will elect the next
Emperor.
And I would put forward
your name with my backing.
MAXIMUS
Caesar, you do me honor -- but your
son has pride of place for
succession.
MARCUS
You are the son I should have had...
Although I fear in my deepest heart
that if you had truly been my son my
blood would have polluted you as it
did Commodus.
We're a cursed
bloodline.
We have lived so long in
power and depravity that we no
longer remember a life without it.
We can no longer even imagine a life
without it.
A beat.
MARCUS
Look at me, son.
Maximus looks at him.
MARCUS
Son... I know that one grove of your
vineyard is worth more to you than
all the treasures of Rome.
I know
one loving word from your wife is
worth more than the accolades of an
Empire.
But... a fond old man, who
loves you more than he can say, begs
you to at least think about what he
has said tonight.
MAXIMUS
I shall, Caesar.
A beat.
MARCUS
I'll keep this letter to myself.
I
hope that with the sunrise you will
agree.
And embrace me as a father.
Maximus nods and rises.
He begins to go.
Stops.
MAXIMUS
You have always been my father.
He goes.
TENT CORRIDOR - DAY
Maximus emerges from Marcus' tent into a long tent
corridor, deep in thought.
LUCILLA'S VOICE
He always favored you...
He turns.
Lucilla is waiting.
She glides to him.
LUCILLA
Even over his son.
MAXIMUS
(turning away)
That's not true.
LUCILLA
Maximus, stop...
(he stops)
Let me see your face.
He turns to her.
LUCILLA
You've been crying.
MAXIMUS
I lost too many men.
LUCILLA
What does my father intend?
He turns and walks.
She walks with him.
MAXIMUS
I don't know.
LUCILLA
You're lying.
I could tell when you
were lying even when we were
children.
You hate it.
MAXIMUS
I never acquired your comfort with
it.
LUCILLA
True.
But then you never had to.
Maximus, stop...
(he stops again)
... Is it really so terrible seeing
me again?
MAXIMUS
No.
I'm sorry.
I'm tired from the
battle.
LUCILLA
And you are hurt to see my father
dying.
A beat.
LUCILLA
He will announce Commodus'
succession.
That's why he summoned
us.
Will you serve my brother as
you served his father?
MAXIMUS
I will always serve the ideals of
Rome.
A beat.
LUCILLA
Do you know I still remember you in
my prayers...?
Oh yes, I pray...
Ever since that day you saved me
from drowning off Capri.
Do you
remember?
MAXIMUS
Yes.
LUCILLA
Commodus was so angry that a mere
peasant -- a Spaniard no less --
touched the royal person, do you
remember his anger?
MAXIMUS
Yes.
LUCILLA
Mark this, Maximus:
that is the man
who will be Emperor.
A beat.
MAXIMUS
May I be permitted to go, Highness?
She smiles sadly.
LUCILLA
There was a time when you didn't
call me "Highness."
MAXIMUS
And there was a time when you were
just a little girl drowning in the
sea.
All that was a different life.
LUCILLA
(quietly)
Very different... I wonder if it was
better?
MAXIMUS
It was more honest.
A moment between them.
We sense there is much to be said,
much that could be said.
Finally:
MAXIMUS
I thank you for your prayers.
He goes.
She watches him walk away.
MAXIMUS' TENT - NIGHT
Maximus kneels before a small altar in his tent.
He faces
six small figures that represent his dead ancestors.
MAXIMUS
Ancestors, true bloodline, I ask you
for your guidance.
Bring me your
solace and your wisdom.
Blessed
Mother, come to me in my dreams with
the Gods' desire for my future.
Blessed Father, watch over my wife
and my son with a ready sword.
Keep
them safe until my return.
Whisper
to them in their sleep that I live
only to hold them again and all else
is dust and air.
Ancestors, true
bloodline, I honor you and will try
to live with the dignity you have
taught me.
He looks at his "ancestors" for a moment and then blows
out the candles around them.
MARCUS' TENT - NIGHT
Commodus' eyes are red with weeping.
He sits, head down,
at the foot of Marcus' bed and speaks to his father.
COMMODUS
(quietly)
I search the faces of the Gods for
ways to please you... to make you
proud... and I can never do it.
One
kind word -- one full hug where you
pressed me to your chest and held me
tight -- would have been like the
sun on my heart for a thousand
years... What is it in me you hate
so much?
My eyes are your eyes.
My
hands are your hands.
All I have
ever wanted was to live up to you.
Caesar.
Father.
He stands.
We see that he is holding the scroll denoting
Marcus' intention to nominate Maximus as Emperor to the
Senate.
Commodus cannot control his tears.
COMMODUS
Why does Maximus deserve what I
could never have? -- Why do you love
his eyes over mine? -- I would
butcher the whole world -- if you
would only love me...
Commodus weeps.
MAXIMUS' TENT - NIGHT
Quintus is waking Maximus --
QUINTUS
General -- Maximus --
MAXIMUS
Quintus -- ?
QUINTUS
The Emperor needs you.
It's urgent.
Maximus leaps up and throws on a cloak, strides out with
Quintus...
MARCUS' TENT - NIGHT
Maximus and Quintus stride into the tent -- Maximus slams
to a halt.
Stunned.
Commodus stands before him.
Lucilla stands in a corner of
the tent, head down.
And Marcus Aurelius dead, lying on his bed.
Maximus stares at Marcus.
COMMODUS
Lament with me, brother, our great
father is dead.
I want --
Maximus, not even hearing, steps past him to Marcus.
He stands for a moment and then slowly kneels before
Marcus and gently kisses the old man's forehead.
A ritual
farewell.
A moment of silent mourning and then Maximus stands.
He
turns very, very slowly to Commodus.
COMMODUS
General, the Gods' have taken the
great man and left me alone.
My
first desire as Emperor is that you
take my hand in friendship.
I need
you at my side, Maximus, at this
moment above all others.
Stand with
me.
Maximus glares at him:
MAXIMUS
How did he die?
Commodus does not respond.
MAXIMUS
How did he die?
COMMODUS
The surgeons say it was his breath
that gave out.
Maximus glances to Lucilla, she avoids his eyes.
COMMODUS
Take my hand, Maximus.
I only offer
it once.
A beat.
Maximus turns back to Marcus.
MAXIMUS
How will the world speak your name
now, old man?
Without a glance to Commodus, he stalks out.
A silent beat.
Then Commodus nods to Quintus.
Quintus
goes.
Lucilla looks at Commodus for a long moment, her face an
enigmatic tornado of complex emotions.
Then:
LUCILLA
Hail, Caesar.
MAXIMUS' TENT - NIGHT
Maximus is kneeling before his ancestors, head down, his
fists clenched, praying.
Quintus and four Praetorian ASSASSINS suddenly burst in --
the assassins move immediately to bind Maximus -- swords
at his throat --
MAXIMUS
What -- ?!
QUINTUS
(ashamed)
Please don't fight, Maximus --
MAXIMUS
Quintus --
Quintus goes to Maximus' armor, which hangs nearby, and
slowly removes his seal of office.
QUINTUS
I'm sorry, General, Caesar has
spoken.
They pull Maximus out --
MAXIMUS' TENT - DAY
Lucilla stands in Maximus' tent.
She looks around.
She
gently touches his Lorica Segmentata.
Her fingertips move
along the contours of his armor.
She tries to retain her
neutral demeanor.
She notes his "ancestors" on the small alter.
PROXIMO'S SCHOOL - MAXIMUS' CELL - NIGHT
Maximus and Juba share a small, filthy cell.
The cell
door faces the open compound.
Across the compound they
can see the much more comfortable cells of the "star"
gladiators such as Vibius.
They both sit on the floor, leaning against the wall.
Juba is eating a bowl of food with a wooden spoon.
Maximus' bowl and spoon are at his side, he has not
touched them.
JUBA
Have you killed a man before?
Maximus does not respond.
JUBA
You should eat.
You'll need your
strength tomorrow.
Maximus does not respond.
JUBA
I've never killed a man.
But I
think you have.
Maximus does not respond.
JUBA
I almost killed once.
The Romans
destroyed my village.
I was with a
hunting party and when we
returned... I would have killed
every Roman in the world.
A long beat.
JUBA
If you don't eat you will die.
Maximus does not respond.
A beat.
JUBA
In the village I come from there was
a man once.
He went fishing one day
and his boat was attacked by
crocodiles.
One of them ate his
leg.
He pulled himself to the shore
and a lion attacked him.
It ate one
of his arms.
He dragged himself
through the desert on the way home
and a scorpion stung his eye.
So he
only had one eye.
When he reached
the village I sat with him.
I said,
"You have lost a leg, an arm and one
eye.
You must have a mighty will to
live."
He said, "No, Lord, it's
just better than the alternative."
Maximus finally looks at him.
JUBA
Life is a gift from our fathers to
us.
Who are you to give it up for
lack of lifting a spoon?
Maximus does not respond.
PALACE - THRONE ROOM - DAY
Emperor Commodus is standing before a group of male
children and their tutors in his throne room.
The throne room is still very much the province of his
father.
Manuscripts and astronomical charts and papyrus
scrolls and wax tablets litter the heavy desk.
A large
bust of Marcus Aurelius is in one corner.
Lucilla and Senator Falco are present.
So too Senators
Gracchus and Gaius and Captain Marcellus.
A well-rehearsed child presents Commodus with a laurel
wreath.
CHILD
We honor Caesar with the laurel to
show our love and appreciation for
his benevolence.
COMMODUS
Caesar is honored to accept your
tribute, Citizen Scholar.
The child smiles and moves back to his fellows.
COMMODUS
(to all)
It is the most sacred duty of the
Emperor to oversee the education of
the young.
If I could leave no
other legacy than the scholarship of
all children my life would be
blessed.
Tutors, you hold the
future of Rome in your hands.
Teach
them well so that they will bring
honor to the Empire.
I salute you.
Commodus actually bows before them, an unimaginable honor.
The tutors bow in response and herd the children out.
COMMODUS
Look at them, Senators... my truest
gift to Rome.
GRACCHUS
Darling children, to be sure, now if
I may proceed?
COMMODUS
(sighs)
Very well...
Commodus moves to the desk, standing over it and gazing at
Marcus' scrolls as:
GRACCHUS
Caesar, your presence in Rome is an
invaluable opportunity to begin
correcting some of the ills that
have beset the city since your
father went to the wars.
We would
like to --
COMMODUS
Peace, good Gracchus, peace...
Commodus slowly begins pushing Marcus' papyrus scrolls off
the desk to the floor, one by one, as:
COMMODUS
My beloved father was a careless
shepherd to his flock.
I shall be a
good father to my children.
I shall
remain in Rome and show them how
they are loved.
GRACCHUS
With respect, sire, the people don't
need love -- they need law.
The
Senate has prepared a series of
protocols to begin addressing the
corruption in the city --
(Gaius hands him a
scroll)
-- starting with basic sanitation in
the Hebrew Quarter.
If Caesar could
study this and --
COMMODUS
You see that's the very problem,
isn't it, my old, old friend?
My
father spent all his time at study.
At books and learning and
philosophy...
As Commodus speaks he moves to the chair behind the desk,
tries it, doesn't like it, nods to a slave.
The chair is
whisked away.
COMMODUS
He spent his twilight hours reading
scrolls from the Senate.
All the
while, the people were forgotten.
GRACCHUS
The Senate is the people.
COMMODUS
I doubt many of the people eat so
well as you do, Senator Gracchus...
As Commodus speaks he moves to the bust of Marcus, studies
it, doesn't like it, nods to a slave and the bust is
whisked away.
Lucilla watches this closely.
COMMODUS
I doubt many of the people have such
splendid armor, Captain Marcellus.
Or such fine mistresses, Senator
Gaius.
No... only their true father
knows what the people need.
I shall
show them they are loved.
I shall
hold them to my bosom and embrace
them tightly --
GRACCHUS
Have you ever embraced someone dying
of plague, sire?
Commodus stops.
Looks at him.
A lethal moment.
COMMODUS
No.
But if you interrupt me one
more time I assure you that you
shall.
I will emulate the immortal
Caesars of the past.
I will give
the people what they truly want.
Starting this day I will draw all of
Rome to the Colosseum.
I will give
them bread.
And they will want
nothing more.
Startled looks between Gracchus, Gaius and Marcellus.
GRACCHUS
You want to hold games?
COMMODUS
Not just any games, Senator!
A
series of games that will make the
Gods envious and leave my children
happy!
I will subsidize the arena
from this day forth -- and I will
culminate this celebration in a
great spectacle the likes of which
the world has never seen!
A great
spectacle to honor my father!
Magnificent, unending weeks of
festivity all in the name of Marcus
Aurelius!
A beat.
GRACCHUS
If I may, Caesar... how are you
going to pay for this?
COMMODUS
That is not your concern.
Gracchus ignores a warning look from Gaius.
GRACCHUS
Respectfully, sire, taxation and
import duties are the exclusive
province of the Senate --
Commodus spins on him so quickly and with such feral
violence that everyone is shocked --
COMMODUS
MY FATHER DESERVES TO BE HONORED AND
I WILL HONOR HIM! -- AND THE PEOPLE
WILL LOVE ME! -- AND THE SENATE WILL
OBEY ME OR EVERY ONE OF YOU WILL
BURN!
BURN!
BURN! -- I WILL HAVE
ORDER!
He snarls like a great jungle cat and he stalks away.
Senator Falco quickly follows.
A dreadful silence.
Then:
LUCILLA
Gentlemen, in the future do not
concern my brother with these
matters.
Come to me.
She sweeps out.
A beat.
MARCELLUS
Games?
He wants to hold games?
GAIUS
It's madness.
GRACCHUS
No... it's not...
A beat.
GRACCHUS
He knows who Rome is.
Rome is the
mob.
He will conjure magic for them
and they will be distracted.
And he
will takes their lives.
And he will
take their freedom.
And still they
will roar.
The beating heart of
Rome isn't the marble of the Senate.
It's the sand of the Colosseum.
He
will give them death.
And they will
love him for it.
PROVINCIAL ARENA - DUGOUT - TUNNELS - DAY
Maximus is marching relentlessly through the dugout and
cramped, serpentine trench-like tunnels that lead to the
arena.
We don't really see Maximus well in the dark tunnels.
Proximo scurries to keep up with him -- they brush past
gladiators who line the walls.
Some are wounded, some are
being attended to by surgeons, some are shell-shocked,
some are nervously waiting to go on, whispering prayers.
We twist and turn in the tunnels with Proximo and Maximus
as:
PROXIMO
(quickly)
I've wagered on you against the
Celts -- ignore the others and go
for them -- there are two axe-and-
net and two long spear.
Now the
Celts aren't used to the sun so you
have the advantage there...
The roar of the crowd is growing, they are nearing the
arena...
PROXIMO
And keep them moving, their lungs
aren't strong, ground the spears as
soon as you can and then go for the
ax-men.
If you get all four there's
an extra bonus so don't be
distracted by the Spartans...
Without a word to Proximo, or a moment's hesitation,
Maximus strides into the arena.
PROXIMO'S SCHOOL - PROXIMO'S CHAMBER - NIGHT
Proximo sits on a terrace overlooking his compound,
sipping wine.
Various gladiators can be seen working out
below.
A guard brings Maximus.
Proximo nods for the guard to
leave.
PROXIMO
(holding up a plate)
Butterfly?
The plate is filled with honeyed butterflies, their wings
still moving slightly.
Maximus shakes his head.
Proximo pops one into his mouth.
He chews as he looks at Maximus.
PROXIMO
Perhaps you'd like a woman?
Maximus shakes his head.
PROXIMO
Boy?
Maximus shakes his head.
A beat.
PROXIMO
Gold?
Maximus shakes his head.
PROXIMO
Well, I have nothing left to offer
you!
A man who turns down a
butterfly, a woman, a boy and gold
confuses me.
Personally, I'd grab
them all and then grab some more
because the Gods are fanciful and
take us at their whim.
Does the
Spaniard have any needs?
Maximus shakes his head.
A beat.
Proximo studies him.
PROXIMO
You fight like a soldier.
You have
wounds like a soldier who has been
on long campaigns.
You eye the
world around you like an enemy.
What is your name, Roman soldier?
MAXIMUS
Gladiator.
A beat.
PROXIMO
And nothing more?
MAXIMUS
Nothing more.
A beat.
Proximo watches Maximus very closely for the following:
PROXIMO
In two days we leave for Rome.
Maximus' eyes suddenly flash to Proximo.
He is
transfixed, his eyes burning.
PROXIMO
Ah... so it's Rome you want.
Well
you shall have her, Gladiator.
The
new Emperor has ordered a series of
matches to culminate in a grand
spectacle.
If you do well I shall
become very, very rich.
If you do
well enough I shall set you free.
Is it freedom you want?
A beat.
Maximus shakes his head.
PROXIMO
(quietly)
Not even that.
MAXIMUS
(barely controlled)
The Emperor -- will he be there?
PROXIMO
Oh yes.
He's apparently quite mad
about the games.
Spending a
fortune, which is, needless to say,
good for me again.
But what is good
for you, Gladiator?
MAXIMUS
Have you -- how does one meet the
Emperor?
PROXIMO
As a gladiator?
MAXIMUS
Yes.
PROXIMO
One doesn't.
A beat.
Proximo sees that Maximus' mind is racing.
PROXIMO
Except... If one has proven oneself
in battle.
If at the end of the
games you are the final man standing
-- the Emperor will present you with
a small wooden sword.
The sword is
your freedom.
MAXIMUS
He give it personally?
PROXIMO
He did to me...
(Maximus is surprised
at this)
Our great father Marcus Aurelius
looked into my eyes and touched me
on the shoulder.
MAXIMUS
You knew Marcus?
PROXIMO
I didn't know him.
He touched me on
the shoulder.
Just once.
But that
was enough.
A beat.
PROXIMO
All right, Gladiator.
We shall go
to Rome together and have bloody
adventures.
The Great Whore will
suckle us until we are fat and happy
and can't suck another drop.
That
is Rome.
SLAVE WAGON - OUTSIDE ROME - EVENING
Maximus is crouched in the back of an enclosed slave wagon
with Vibius, Juba and a few other gladiators.
In the distance, Rome.
PALACE - COMMODUS' BEDROOM - NIGHT
Commodus sits on his bed, rubbing his aching head.
Lucilla is preparing a drink for him, a medicinal tonic.
COMMODUS
All my desires are splitting my head
to pieces -- there's so much I want
to do -- but all my efforts to show
my children they are loved go
unappreciated by those dragons in
the Senate --
LUCILLA
(mixing tonic)
Quiet, brother...
Unseen by him, she adds a little special powder to the
drink from a vial secreted in her robe.
LUCILLA
Leave the Senate to me.
Don't
trouble yourself.
COMMODUS
All I want is to be a good father to
my people.
Why don't they
understand that?
She goes to him.
LUCILLA
Shhh.
The tonic will help...
She takes a sip and then hands it to him.
LUCILLA
Yes, just drink this down.
She sits on the edge of the bed.
He drinks as:
COMMODUS
I must take a firmer hand with them.
They must know their father can be
firm.
As our father was firm with
us.
LUCILLA
Our father lost his way.
His
mistake was believing the old songs
of the "Republic."
We know better.
So let the Senate talk.
They have
no real power.
COMMODUS
Yes... yes... you always know the
way.
You were always so wise in
these matters...
(he takes her hand)
You know if I didn't have my duty to
Rome I think I should be an artist.
I should go away and paint pictures
of the sea and leave all the
politics to you...
A beat.
He is sleepy, he lies back on his bed.
COMMODUS
Will you stay with me?
LUCILLA
(smiles gently)
Still afraid of the dark, brother?
COMMODUS
Still.
Always.
A beat.
COMMODUS
My dreams would terrify the world.
A beat.
LUCILLA
I'll stay with you until you are
asleep.
COMMODUS
(falling asleep)
And after... just sit with me.
Keep
me safe...
He is asleep.
She watches him for a moment and then rises.
She goes.
PALACE - HALLWAY - NIGHT
Lucilla moves down a long corridor in the palace and blows
out candles as she goes.
She finally arrives at her own chamber and enters...
PALACE - LUCILLA'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT
Senators Gracchus and Gaius and Captain Marcellus are
waiting.
LUCILLA
He's asleep.
Be quick.
GRACCHUS
We've taking a sounding, the Senate
is with us.
LUCILLA
Good.
GRACCHUS
But we are only words.
We are air.
We need steel.
MARCELLUS
The City Guard is faithful to the
Republic.
But we don't stand a
chance against the Praetorians.
LUCILLA
Can they be bought?
MARCELLUS
They are zealots -- totally
committed to your brother.
GRACCHUS
Well, can they at least be rented
for a day?
MARCELLUS
I doubt it.
He pays them exorbitant
salaries and lets them loot and
extort as they see fit.
The city
belongs to them.
LUCILLA
And they've started arresting
scholars now.
Anyone who dares
speak out -- even satirists and
chroniclers.
MARCELLUS
And mathematicians and Christians.
All to fill the arena.
GAIUS
And what pays for it?
These games
are costing a fortune and yet we
have no new taxes.
LUCILLA
The future.
The future pays for
it...
A beat.
She looks at them.
LUCILLA
He's started selling the grain
reserves.
GAIUS
No.
MARCELLUS
That can't be true...
LUCILLA
He's selling Rome's reserves of
grain.
The people will be starving
in two years.
I hope they are
enjoying the spectacles because soon
enough they will be dead because of
them.
MARCELLUS
Rome must know this.
LUCILLA
And who will tell them?!
You,
Marcellus?
You, Senator Gaius?
Will you make a speech on the Senate
floor denouncing my brother?
And
then see your family in the
Colosseum?
What town-crier would
dare?
A long beat.
LUCILLA
He must die.
A beat as her words sink in.
GAIUS
The Praetorians would only seize
control themselves.
LUCILLA
No -- cut off the head and the snake
cannot strike.
GRACCHUS
Lucilla, Gaius is right.
Until the
City Guard can neutralize the
Praetorians we can accomplish
nothing.
MARCELLUS
And I haven't enough men.
LUCILLA
What about the army?
GAIUS
No Roman army has entered the
capital in a hundred years.
LUCILLA
So we do nothing?!
A door opens, a voice...
LUCIUS' VOICE
Mother...
An eight-year-old boy stands in a doorway, sleepy.
He is
LUCIUS, Lucilla's son.
LUCIUS
I heard voices...
LUCILLA
(going to him)
It's all right, darling, you --
Lucius suddenly notices Senator Gracchus:
LUCIUS
(running to Gracchus)
Senator!
What did you bring me?!
He leaps onto Gracchus -- Gracchus laughs and pulls
something from his robe.
GRACCHUS
For you prince Lucius... a sea
monster!
Gracchus gives Lucius a beautifully painted toy of a sea
serpent.
GRACCHUS
Off the coast of Achaea they grow
twenty times this size, with
snapping teeth to devour any nasty
Praetorians they come across... now,
where is Achaea?
LUCIUS
Below Macedonia!
GRACCHUS
Show me on the map.
Lucius runs to a map and stabs his finger at Achaea.
We
sense this is an old game between them.
LUCILLA
Lucius, you go in now, I'll be in
shortly.
LUCIUS
(to Gracchus)
Thank you, Senator Mountain!
GRACCHUS
You're welcome, Prince Anthill!
Lucius goes.
Lucilla shuts the door after him.
A moment.
She turns to the others, a deep anguish in her eyes.
LUCILLA
What are you going to do?
Gracchus goes to her, holds her.
GRACCHUS
Peace child... One dark night the
Gods will light our path.
They will
give us the voice we need.
Have
faith in that.
Have faith.
ROMAN STREETS - SLAVE WAGON - NIGHT
Maximus cranes for a sight of the Eternal City through a
hole in the wooden slats that cover the slave cart.
He can see only glimpses of Rome as they pass.
But the
images are not what he expected.
Alongside the undeniable
glory of the city, the madness and disease Marcus Aurelius
spoke of are readily apparent.
Maximus sees flashes of plague victims being tossed on
carts heaped with bodies -- he sees getting and spending
and commerce everywhere -- he sees fascist Praetorian
Guard units trooping past -- he sees the magnificent
architecture of the city -- he sees starving children
begging from filthy gutters -- he sees rich citizens out
for a stroll -- he sees a swirling combination of
sophistication and depravity, of civilization and
corruption.
He sits back in the cart, deep in thought.
Vibius looks
at him.
VIBIUS
Not what you expected?
MAXIMUS
No.
VIBIUS
Rome is nothing but a slaughter
house.
And we are the meat.
PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - CELL - NIGHT
Later.
Maximus and Juba again share a cell.
It is more
comfortable than their cell in Morocco, befitting Maximus'
new status as one of the "stars."
A high, barred window
on one wall opens to the city.
Another barred window is
directly over them, twenty feet above.
Maximus pulls himself up to the side window, he looks out.
And sees at last... The Colosseum.
It is a breathtaking sight.
Monolithic Albert Speer-like
columns of light shine up from the Colosseum.
It seems to
illuminate the whole city and the heavens above.
Maximus drops back to the floor.
JUBA
Do you think it will be much
different?
Here in Rome?
MAXIMUS
Bigger arena.
Same killing.
A beat.
JUBA
Are you scared for tomorrow?
MAXIMUS
No.
A beat.
JUBA
Me too.
A beat.
JUBA
I never though it would be so easy
to kill.
A beat.
JUBA
So you're finally home.
MAXIMUS
This isn't my home.
JUBA
For all Romans... this is home.
A beat.
JUBA
(quietly)
Among my people we honor the soil of
our home.
Our ancestors are in that
soil.
All their dreams live there.
I will never see my home again.
The
soil is dead and no one honors them,
so the dreams die.
A beat.
MAXIMUS
Perhaps one day you'll return.
Juba looks at him.
JUBA
How can I go back?
I am not what I
was.
When a man kills for no
reason, he has lost himself.
A long beat.
Juba leans his head back and quietly begins to sing.
A
haunting lament in his native tongue.
COLOSSEUM - ROUTE TO HOLDING CELLS - DAY
The interior of the Colosseum is a busy world unto itself.
Maximus and the others are lead by Proximo's guards down a
long ramp and past countless animal cages.
Gamblers
circulate everywhere and observe the warriors, angling for
the best odds and the best matches.
Maximus and the others are led even deeper into the bowels
of the Colosseum to a new whole subterranean realm.
Numerous cells line the walls.
Racks and racks of
weaponry and armor.
And, most striking, everywhere around them is the heavy
machinery of the spectacles above.
Huge "elevator"
platforms and ramps and pulleys and counterweights are
manned by teams of sweating slaves.
COLOSSEUM - HOLDING CELLS - DAY
Finally, Proximo's guards lead the gladiators to their
holding cells.
These cells are right at the edge of the
arena.
Barred windows offer a sand-level view of the
action.
Maximus immediately goes to a window and looks out.
He cannot see much of the entire arena, but what he does
see transfixes him.
A band of Christians are huddled together.
An eerie
silence from the Colosseum but for the prayers of the
Christians.
Maximus watches them.
One little girl peels past her
mother's arm.
She sees Maximus.
She smiles.
Suddenly a dozen ferocious lions race up a ramp by Maximus
-- they roar into the arena --
We do not see the carnage.
We watch Maximus' face as we
hear the sounds of the slaughter.
And the sound of the roaring crowd.
Maximus finally cannot watch.
He drops his head.
COLOSSEUM - TRAINER'S LAIR - DAY
Proximo is with a dozen other gladiator trainers and the
Colosseum's orator and majordomo, CASSIUS.
They are
haggling in an secluded area not far from the arena
itself.
Huge chalkboards chart the day's matches and
wagers and odds.
Colosseum touts continually erase and mark new figures on
the chalkboards to keep up with the swiftly changing
bouts.
The roar of the lions and the unnerving screams of the
Christians can clearly be heard.
CASSIUS
... and the Emperor will have no
more animal battles today --
Upset roars from some of the trainers.
TRAINER #1
You promised me a bear match,
Cassius!
TRAINER #2
I have ten damned gorillas!
You
said gorillas yesterday!
CASSIUS
Talk to the man in the imperial box.
Who has the next slot...?
(he checks the
boards)
-- Lentulus, Gideon, Trebonius and
Proximo --
(to Proximo)
-- Nice to have you back, you
piratical bastard -- now listen, the
Emperor wants the Carthage
spectacle.
The four trainers explode in a flurry of resistance --
PROXIMO
No -- have pity, Cassius -- !
TRAINER #3
My men are too good for -- !
CASSIUS
You give us the Carthage match or
lose your spot on the rotation --
but don't worry -- gold is flowing
from the Emperor's fingers.
TRAINER #3
It'll cost you --
PROXIMO
I won't do it for less than 100,000
sesterces -- !
TRAINER #4
120,000!
All I have is my best
Thracians!
CASSIUS
(to Proximo)
And I want to see this famous
Spaniard of yours -- his reputation
soars from the provinces.
The
people are eager for him --
PROXIMO
I won't throw my Spaniard into a
spectacle!
Damn you and damn the
rotation!
CASSIUS
You will and the price will be
90,000 sesterces each --
(to all)
-- which you all know is exorbitant
-- AND IF YOU EXTORTING BLOOD-WHORES
TRY TO PAWN OFF LESSER FIGHTERS ON
ME I WILL SEE YOU DEAD IN THE ARENA
TOMORROW!
TRAINER #4
My Thracians are worth -- !
CASSIUS
Give me your best, brothers.
They
die before Caesar.
He strides back to the arena.
The touts instantly begin
making new marks on the boards to represent the mysterious
"Carthage Spectacle" as some of the trainers hurry out.
Proximo walks with Trainer #4:
PROXIMO
I give you 30,000 my Spaniard will
kill at least one of your Thracians.
TRAINER #4
30,000?!
On a Spaniard?!
That
provincial sun has curdled your
brain!
PROXIMO
Then make the wager, you smug
bastard!
They disappear down a dark corridor, negotiating all the
while.
COLOSSEUM - HOLDING CELLS - DAY
Maximus, Juba, Vibius and another of Proximo's gladiators
are being armed.
They all wear mask-like helmets.
Proximo hurries to them.
PROXIMO
All right -- there are three other
teams, four men each --
(to Maximus)
You know what a Thracian looks like?
MAXIMUS
Yes, but --
PROXIMO
Ignore the others -- go for the
Thracians.
The sun is to the east
-- over the gate -- keep your back
to the gate and you won't have the
sun.
MAXIMUS
What -- ?
Trumpets begin sounding from the arena.
PROXIMO
Hurry -- !
The guards quickly bustle the four toward a gate leading
to a dark tunnel to the arena.
PROXIMO
Die well and we'll sing songs about
you for a generation.
Short swords are shoved into their hands and the gate
rises.
They are pushed into the dark tunnel leading to
the arena.
The gate closes behind them.
The four gladiators stand for a moment and then slowly
walk down the tunnel to...
PALACE - THRONE ROOM - NIGHT
To our great surprise, Commodus is not raging.
He sits
quietly on the polished marble floor in front of a model
of the Colosseum.
He moves model pieces around in the
Colosseum, planning his festival.
Lucilla stands, tense.
COMMODUS
Why is he still alive?
LUCILLA
I don't know.
COMMODUS
He shouldn't be alive.
That vexes
me.
I am terribly vexed...
Lucilla watches her brother cautiously, expecting the
explosion.
He carefully moves some model pieces in the
arena.
COMMODUS
There, that's better.
Do you like
the platform here?
LUCILLA
Mmm.
COMMODUS
I do too.
Simple, elegant...
Lucilla is growing more and more unnerved at Commodus'
unusual serenity.
COMMODUS
Father would have wanted something
more ornate but he's dead now.
A beat.
Commodus laughs.
A beat.
COMMODUS
Maximus Meridas haunts me.
I see
Father turning away from me and
gazing at him.
How many times did I
suffer that indignity, I wonder?
LUCILLA
What are you going to do?
COMMODUS
I'm going to kill him.
LUCILLA
Good.
COMMODUS
(glances at her)
Oh, you're too clever, Sister.
Don't tell me part of you won't weep
for him.
LUCILLA
When he defies my brother the
Emperor, he defies me.
But you
shouldn't send assassins.
COMMODUS
No?
LUCILLA
The people embraced him today.
They
will be expecting his next match...
(she kneels next to
him)
... let him die in the arena like
the slave he is.
Let the people see
what comes of defying Caesar.
A beat as he looks at her.
COMMODUS
He wounded you deeply, didn't he?
Long ago.
She does not answer.
COMMODUS
Nonetheless, your political acumen
is, as always, unerring.
He picks up a model tiger and puts it in the arena.
He
looks at the model tiger and smiles.
PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - CELL - NIGHT
Maximus silently awaits Commodus' assassins with Juba.
They hear footsteps outside the cell.
Maximus stands,
preparing for death.
JUBA
(also standing)
I will fight with you.
MAXIMUS
This isn't your battle.
JUBA
Better to die for a friend than to
die for gold.
The door swings open and they are surprised to see Proximo
sweeping in with a cloaked woman.
The woman gives Proximo
a bag of money.
PROXIMO
Enjoy yourself, Madame...
(he glances to
Maximus)
General, perform well and there will
be riches for you.
He beckons to Juba, they go, shutting the door behind
them.
The woman pulls off her cloak, it is Lucilla.
Maximus glares at her, his muscles tensing.
LUCILLA
Rich matrons pay well to be
pleasured by the bravest champions.
Maximus backs up, fighting the urge to strangle her on the
spot.
He finally bumps into a wall of the cell.
MAXIMUS
I knew your brother would send
assassins.
I didn't think he would
send his best.
LUCILLA
Maximus, listen to me --
MAXIMUS
My family were crucified and burnt
while they were still alive.
LUCILLA
I knew nothing of that.
MAXIMUS
(low)
Don't lie to me.
LUCILLA
I wept for them.
MAXIMUS
Don't.
A long, tense moment.
She does not look at him.
LUCILLA
Do you know what it is to be the
daughter of the Emperor?
I learned
on the night my father had my
husband killed.
I loved my husband
very much.
Very... simply.
He was
a man who believed in the Republic.
He was a man who thought Marcus
should be tending to Rome and not
conquering the world.
One night my
father had him strangled for
conspiring with the Senate.
My
father never spoke of it.
I never
spoke of it.
That is what it is to
be the daughter of Rome.
She finally looks up at Maximus.
LUCILLA
My son will live.
He will survive
this cursed bloodline.
Rome will
die and the jackals will pick her
clean -- but my son will survive.
Empires come and go.
Cities crumble
to dust.
Only family matters.
A beat.
Despite himself, Maximus is moved.
MAXIMUS
My son was innocent.
LUCILLA
So is mine.
A beat.
MAXIMUS
I want your brother dead.
LUCILLA
So do I.
A beat.
Maximus is surprised at her direct answer.
LUCILLA
My son will never be safe while he
lives.
A beat.
MAXIMUS
How do you plan it?
LUCILLA
The Senate is with us, and the City
Guard.
We have growing power in the
streets.
But we need a leader.
Someone the people can --
MAXIMUS
So the crown passes to your son.
LUCILLA
No.
So that my son will be safe.
So that we may leave this charnel
house forever and never look back.
Look into my eyes, Maximus, and
believe what I say to you...
She rivets him intensely with her eyes.
LUCILLA
By all the Gods, and in the name of
my father who loved you, and in the
name of the husband I loved... I
swear to stand by your side in this
now and always.
A beat.
MAXIMUS
What is your son's name?
LUCILLA
Lucius Verus.
Like his father.
MAXIMUS
I weep for him.
A long beat.
Maximus' cold eyes give away nothing.
Lucilla turns and starts to go.
She stops, not looking
back.
LUCILLA
Commodus plans to kill you in your
next match in the arena.
He's
planning something.
I will pray for
you.
As I have always done.
She then pulls something from her robes and sets it down,
a little bundle wrapped in cloth.
She sweeps out.
The
sound of the door being bolted shut on the other side.
Maximus stands for a moment and then goes to what she has
left.
He opens the cloth.
Inside are his six "ancestor"
figures.
He picks up one of the figures.
He looks at it deeply,
gently feeling along the contours with a finger.
COLOSSEUM - HOLDING CELLS - DAY
Proximo stands with Maximus, who is busy strapping on
armor.
PROXIMO
Gods!
That old Homicide!
The
Emperor must truly hate you.
MAXIMUS
What can you tell me?
PROXIMO
He cheats.
COLOSSEUM - ARENA - DAY
Tiger waits.
He stands in the center of the arena.
He
has only a traditional short sword.
The crowd is
breathless with anticipation.
As:
CASSIUS
(orating)
And from the rocky promontories and
martial bloodlines of Spain...
representing the training lyceum of
Proximo Antoninus... I give you...
THE WARRIOR MAXIMUS!
The crowd cheers.
Maximus appears from his gate.
His
fans have increased in number considerably.
They eagerly
crane forward and celebrate him.
Meanwhile, Maximus looks at Tiger.
Only one man with a
sword?
Maximus approaches, cautious but confident.
He stops a few feet from Tiger.
They lock eyes, salute
each other and then turn to the Imperial Box, raising
their swords.
The crowd waits eagerly for the immortal words...
MAXIMUS AND TIGER
We who are about to die salute you.
The crowd cheers and Maximus immediately turns and starts
slashing -- Tiger easily blocks and strikes back --
The sword play is very fast -- they block and parry and
hack like lightning -- constantly attacking -- they are
perfectly matched --
As he fights Maximus becomes aware of a strange sound over
the roar of the crowd -- a low rumbling -- then he feels
something -- a vibration in the ground --
Suddenly traps doors swing open and four enormous
platforms rise into view.
On each platform is a snarling
Bengal tiger restrained by a chain.
Tiger's teams of
"cornermen" hold the chains through a pulley system.
The
cornermen are safely inside cages.
The platforms stop at
ground level.
The four ferocious tigers now mark the four corners of the
battleground.
Tiger takes advantage of Maximus' momentary confusion and
assaults brutally -- forcing him back toward one of the
tigers -- the tiger claws for Maximus -- Maximus just
evades it claws -- rolls for a new position -- another
tiger snaps at him --
Tiger attacks -- Maximus is on the defensive -- fighting
off Tiger and evading the four snarling beasts --
And then all four tigers are suddenly closer.
The teams
of cornermen are letting the chains play out, bit by bit,
gradually reducing the size of the battle ground.
The
crowd roars.
But the fight is hardly fair.
Whenever Tiger is near one of the tigers the cornermen
pull back the tiger slightly -- when Maximus is near a
tiger they let it out a bit.
Maximus and Tiger fight -- swirling action -- finally,
Maximus has the edge -- he circles so that the sun stabs
into Tiger's eyes -- then Maximus lunges forward under
Tiger's swinging sword and SLAMS into him -- they fall --
a tiger swats at Maximus' face -- he jerks his head back
-- he shoots out a leg and kicks Tiger's sword toward one
of the tigers -- it is out of reach -- Maximus leaps up
and stands over the winded Tiger, sword to his throat.
Tiger is gasping for breath, crushed.
Then one of Tiger's corners suddenly cheats -- they
completely release a tiger -- it leaps for Maximus --
Maximus barely has time to turn -- the tiger crashes into
him -- its claws slashing into his back, cutting through
his leather armor -- Maximus shoves an armored forearm
into the tiger's jaws and stabs with his sword --
Tiger takes this chance to pull himself up -- one of his
corners throws him another sword -- the crowd boos --
Maximus wrestles with the tiger -- spinning it around with
superhuman effort so it is always between himself and
Tiger -- so that Tiger can't get at him --
Maximus finally kills the tiger and leaps for Tiger -- he
quickly disarms him and tosses him to the ground --
Maximus stands over him -- ready to administer the coup de
grace.
All eyes turn to the Emperor.
Commodus slowly stands and steps to the edge of the
Imperial Box.
He raises his arm and gives the fatal
thumbs down.
Maximus looks up at him.
And then defiantly tosses the sword to the ground,
refusing to kill Tiger.
Commodus is stunned.
The crowd gasps -- a collective intake of breath -- and
then an enormous roar building.
It cascades around the
Colosseum.
It is a roaring celebration of the unexpected
act of mercy.
And the delicious act of defiance of the
Emperor.
Commodus slowly sits.
Maximus walks across the arena -- the people stand and
cheer for him.
Cries of "Maximus the Merciful" can be
heard.
It is the birth of a hero.
COLOSSEUM - HOLDING CELLS - DAY
Maximus is resting in his cell after the battle, head
down, deep in thought.
LUCIUS' VOICE
Is it true you're a General...?
Maximus looks up, Lucius is standing at his cell.
Maximus
has no idea who the boy is -- just another young fan --
but Maximus is immediately struck by Lucius' resemblance
to his own son.
MAXIMUS
I was a General.
LUCIUS
I saw you fight.
The Carthage
battle too.
I've never seen so much
courage.
MAXIMUS
It doesn't take courage to kill.
LUCIUS
My father was killed.
A beat.
MAXIMUS
I'm sorry.
LUCIUS
He still comes to me in my dreams.
Do you have a father?
MAXIMUS
I had a father.
He wasn't really my
father but I cared for him very much.
LUCIUS
I hope he comes to you in your
dreams.
My father and I ride horses
in mine.
These simple words strike something deep in Maximus.
Lucilla appears from the shadows and puts her hands on
Lucius' shoulders.
LUCILLA
Lucius, run along now.
I need to
talk to the General.
Lucius runs off to his Male ATTENDANT, who leads him away.
A long beat as Maximus and Lucilla look at each other.
Finally:
MAXIMUS
Where is my army?
A drum beat is heard.
It increases throughout the
following scenes, building momentum like a Roman gallery
accelerating to ramming speed.
The conspiracy scenes are enclosed in a montage of scenes
in and around the arena showing Maximus' growing
popularity with the People of Rome...
THE SENATE - DAY
Lucilla conspires with Senators Gracchus and Gaius and
Captain Marcellus in a dark corner of the Senate.
Whispers.
LUCILLA
... Maximus will summon his army
from Ostia and he will strike from
the inside as his army strikes from
the outside.
But he insists that
the Senate be present.
GAIUS
We've been ordered to attend.
LUCILLA
How many are with us?
GRACCHUS
About half.
But once the tyrant is
dead.
All.
A beat.
GRACCHUS
I want to meet him.
LUCILLA
I'll arrange it.
GAIUS
And what of the Emperor?
A beat.
LUCILLA
He has withdrawn.
He's not eating.
He doesn't go out.
He won't even
see me... I don't know what tempests
rage within him but...
GRACCHUS
We should fear for the blackest
storm.
LUCILLA
Yes.
A beat.
GAIUS
One question... who is to be the
actual Regicide?
A beat.
She glances at him.
The drums continue...
COLOSSEUM - HOLDING CELLS - DAY
Maximus returns to the holding cells.
Vibius and Juba are
waiting.
VIBIUS
You didn't kill him.
MAXIMUS
I will not kill another warrior.
There is no honor to it.
Maximus goes.
Vibius thinks about it, listening to the
adulation of the crowd.
The drums continue...
SLAVE WAGON - ROMAN STREETS - DAY
Maximus and the other gladiators are in a slave cart on
the way from the arena.
A gang of children run alongside
the cart, cheering and chanting:
KIDS
Maximus the Merciful!
Maximus the
Merciful!
The drums continue...
PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - CELL - NIGHT
Maximus and Juba are with Lucilla and Gracchus.
Lucilla
is writing on a piece of parchment.
MAXIMUS
Tell him we will enter Rome on the
first day of Commodus' festival.
LUCILLA
And they will march on Rome for you?
MAXIMUS
Yes.
But this letter must go to the
lieutenant named Titus, no one else.
LUCILLA
Captain Marcellus will take it.
And
his City Guard will by with you when
you get to Rome.
Is that enough to
face the Praetorian Guard?
MAXIMUS
(looks to her)
The Felix Regiment will never be
defeated.
A beat.
GRACCHUS
I only have one question for you,
General... Why?
A beat.
GRACCHUS
You will lead an army of your
brothers on Rome.
Many will die.
Why?
MAXIMUS
I want Commodus dead.
GRACCHUS
That's not the reason.
Tell me the
truth.
A beat.
MAXIMUS
Because one night an old man
whispered to me about a dream.
I
will die for that dream.
A long beat.
GRACCHUS
I knew the old man well.
And I
loved him very much.
In our youth
we would spend hours building that
dream together.
After he went to
the wars and lost his way... I was
very cruel.
I tormented him to
remember that dream we spoke of.
MAXIMUS
He did.
GRACCHUS
You can have no idea how much that
means to me.
A beat.
GRACCHUS
Any man who will die for a whispered
dream deserves my respect.
I honor
you, General.
The drums continue...
PALACE - LUCILLA'S CHAMBER - DAY
Lucilla is with her HANDMAIDEN.
They sit before a large
mirror, the Handmaiden perfecting Lucilla's makeup for the
day.
One of Commodus' Centurion Body Guards enters, bows.
CENTURION
Madame, the Emperor would like to
see you.
Lucilla quickly glances to her Handmaiden in the mirror
and then braces herself, stands, and quickly leaves with
the Centurion.
PALACE - HALLWAY - DAY
Lucilla strides quickly, nervously, down the long corridor
to Commodus' chambers.
She enters...
PALACE - COMMODUS' BEDROOM - DAY
Commodus is wrapped in a sheet, gazing out a window.
LUCILLA
Caesar...
He turns.
She stops.
He looks as if he has not slept for days.
If a word could
now sum up his clouded face it is this:
tormented.
She goes to him, embraces him.
He holds her tightly.
COMMODUS
I am sorry to have kept you away...
I needed this time to think...
LUCILLA
Of course...
He moves away from her, slowly moving around the room.
COMMODUS
I limited my world to these four
walls so as to let my mind free...
again and again my mind settles on
but one question... What kind of
world are we making when the people
of Rome prefer a slave in the arena
to their father?
A beat.
Commodus' strange philosophical bent is unnerving
Lucilla.
COMMODUS
It is my responsibility to make the
world as it should be.
How is it I
have made this world?
LUCILLA
Brother, do not be influenced by the
mob.
They are a great, faceless
beast --
COMMODUS
They are not "the mob," Lucilla,
they are the people.
They are my
children and all I want to do is
love them.
A beat.
He stands before a bust of Marcus Aurelius.
He
touches it.
COMMODUS
Our father loved Maximus... and I
love him still... yet he defies me,
he tasks me in front of my children.
And they love him for it.
Just as
Marcus loved him for it.
Tell me
why, Lucilla.
LUCILLA
They see themselves in him.
They
throw in their own sad dreams
alongside his.
They think he fights
for them.
COMMODUS
And what do I do but fight for
them?!
I give them games to please
them.
I strangle dissent to give
them peace.
I empower the
Praetorians to give them order.
What more can I do?!
A beat.
COMMODUS
Say I should fight him, in the
arena.
Let my children see who the
Gods truly favor.
LUCILLA
And what if he should win?
A beat.
Commodus continues to slowly move around the room.
COMMODUS
A God is more powerful than a man...
This odd statement hangs in the air for a moment.
Then:
LUCILLA
Caesar, you let this unduly worry
you.
At best he is a passing fancy
-- he is a name, an image on a
banner, ephemeral -- he will be
forgotten as the next fancy
appears --
COMMODUS
But I need to know -- why do they
love him?
LUCILLA
Mercy.
He stops.
Looks at her.
LUCILLA
He will not kill in the arena.
He
is merciful.
As they all wish they
were in their own hearts.
Something in her words has struck a chord in him.
COMMODUS
And for that moment in the arena
they are merciful too.
For a
moment... they are Gods.
Offering
life.
He looks at her.
COMMODUS
But who can be more merciful than
the Emperor of Rome?
PALACE - LUCILLA'S CHAMBERS - EVENING
Commodus sweeps in.
Thinks Lucilla is standing there.
The woman turns, it is Lucilla's Handmaiden.
COMMODUS
Where is my sister?
HANDMAIDEN
She's out, sir...
COMMODUS
Where?
HANDMAIDEN
I... don't know, Caesar.
Commodus looks at her for a moment.
And then he slowly walks right to her.
His face an inch
away from hers.
COMMODUS
Where is my sister?
PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - PROXIMO'S CHAMBER - NIGHT
Proximo sits, considering Maximus.
MAXIMUS
Was it Centurion...?
General...?
PROXIMO
Captain.
A beat.
PROXIMO
How did you know?
MAXIMUS
A soldier knows a soldier.
A beat.
PROXIMO
All that was a long time ago.
Too
much wine and too many women.
And
too much money.
MAXIMUS
No --
PROXIMO
This is who I am...
(he pats his ample
belly)
You see?
There was a time I would
stand against ten men and never give
an inch, spitting into the jaws of
Hades all the while.
There was a
time my heart swelled to strap on
the armor of Rome.
But now...
Something flashes across Proximo's eyes, something like
tragedy.
PROXIMO
Now I am just an entertainer.
A pause.
MAXIMUS
You said something to me once.
You
said in this life, we all die.
All
we can choose is how we die.
And
how we are remembered.
Do you
recall those words?
PROXIMO
Yes.
MAXIMUS
Then be remembered proudly.
This is
your time, Proximo.
Stand at my
side and be what you were.
What you
truly are.
One last time.
A beat.
Proximo suddenly begins to weep rather histrionically --
Maximus is a bit taken aback -- Proximo dramatically
flicks tears from his eyes -- and then can't keep the show
up -- he bursts into laughter.
Maximus stares at him.
PROXIMO
(laughing)
You might have spared yourself the
speech, General.
The lady Lucilla
bought all my gladiators two hours
ago!
MAXIMUS
You pox-ridden bastard -- !
PROXIMO
I am the richest trainer in the
Empire!
And I will let my
gladiators do anything you like!
Conspire away, General!
Maximus can only laugh as well.
PROXIMO
But I tell you -- if you survive
this madness I want you to go into
business with me.
I'll give you a
quarter of my holdings.
MAXIMUS
(standing)
A quarter?!
PROXIMO
A third.
And not a hair more.
And
you'll have to start in the
provinces!
Cleaning up the lion
shit!
MAXIMUS
You know, if you were half so awful
as you pretend, you'd be a
terrifying man.
Maximus shakes his head, smiling, and goes.
Proximo sits for a moment.
Then he rises and goes to a heavy chest.
He looks at the
chest for a moment and then opens it.
Inside is his old Lorica Segmentata.
He gazes at his
armor, considering what he once was.
And what he now is.
PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - CELL - NIGHT
Maximus enters.
Lucilla is waiting, extremely tense.
MAXIMUS
Lucilla --
LUCILLA
Don't even say it.
I know it's
dangerous -- but I had to see you.
Captain Marcellus has gone to the
army with your message as you
instructed.
MAXIMUS
Good.
LUCILLA
He says the City Guard will be ready
at the south road at noon.
They can
only wait for an hour so --
MAXIMUS
You've told me this already.
LUCILLA
Did I?
All right then.
So
everything is prepared.
The Senate
will be in attendance and you have
your gladiators -- the usual cohort
of Praetorians will be inside the
arena --
MAXIMUS
Lucilla... why are you here?
A pause.
LUCILLA
Tell me honestly... please... do you
think it will work?
A beat.
MAXIMUS
No.
LUCILLA
Do you think we'll all die?
MAXIMUS
Yes.
She leans against a wall.
A pause.
LUCILLA
Will you swear something to me?
MAXIMUS
Yes.
LUCILLA
Will you swear it on the memory of
your son?
A long beat.
MAXIMUS
Yes.
LUCILLA
By all that you have ever loved...
swear that if you survive you will
take my son out of Rome.
Swear that
you will go far away and never
return.
He steps to her.
MAXIMUS
(deeply)
I will.
A beat.
MAXIMUS
And if I should not survive... swear
to me that you will honor my family
in your prayers always.
LUCILLA
I will.
A long, difficult beat.
She fights back tears.
LUCILLA
Had I not been the daughter of
Rome...
He puts a gentle finger to her lips.
MAXIMUS
Shhh... my heart breaks enough.
He holds her closely, tenderly.
PALACE - LUCILLA'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT
Lucilla enters, deep in thought, still drained from her
meeting with Maximus.
She suddenly stops.
Frozen.
Commodus is sitting across the chamber, Lucius at his
knee.
An open scroll on Commodus' lap.
COMMODUS
Sister... join us.
I've been
reading to dear Lucius.
LUCIUS
I've been reading too.
COMMODUS
Yes, he's a very smart little boy.
He'll make a grand Emperor one day.
Lucilla has not moved.
COMMODUS
Join us, sister.
Lucilla goes to them, sits.
COMMODUS
We've been reading about the great
Julius and his adventures in Egypt.
LUCIUS
She killed herself with a snake!
COMMODUS
(to Lucius)
And just wait until you hear what
happened to some of our other
ancestors!
If you're very good,
tomorrow night I'll tell you the
story of Emperor Claudius.
He was
betrayed!
By those closest to
him...
(he glances up to
Lucilla)
... by his own blood... they
whispered in dark corners and went
out late at night and conspired and
conspired...
Lucilla looks as if she is going to be ill.
Lucius is busy scanning the scroll.
Commodus gently
strokes his hair, his cold eyes never leaving Lucilla's.
COMMODUS
But the Emperor Claudius knew that
they were up to something dire.
He
knew they were busy little bees.
And one night he sat down with one
of them and he looked at her and he
said:
"Tell me what you have been
doing, busy little bee, or I shall
strike down those dearest to you.
You shall watch as I bathe in their
blood."
And the bee knew he spoke
the truth, for the Emperor always
speaks the truth.
And what do you
think happened then, Lucius?
LUCIUS
(still pouring over
the scrolls)
I don't know, Uncle.
COMMODUS
(glaring at Lucilla)
The bee told him everything.
Lucilla's face is tortured.
PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - PROXIMO'S CHAMBER - NIGHT
Proximo is asleep -- a sound outside wakes him -- the
steady clip-clop of horses on stone.
A lot of horses.
He rises and goes to a window overlooking the street
outside.
A stern Praetorian Guard cavalry unit is cantering into
position at his gates.
Proximo grabs his clothes --
TUNNELS - NIGHT
Proximo is leading Maximus and Juba quickly through a
decaying cramped tunnel.
PROXIMO
All the old gladiator schools have
tunnels to the Colosseum -- most
have long since collapsed --
JUBA
How did they know?
MAXIMUS
We were betrayed.
JUBA
(stops)
I'll stay here.
In case they
follow.
Maximus stops as well.
JUBA
Go!
Bring us the army!
Maximus nods.
PROXIMO
Quickly --
He leads Maximus down the disintegrating catacomb of
tunnels --
COLOSSEUM - SUBTERRANEAN - NIGHT
Proximo and Maximus emerge deep in the bowels of the
Colosseum.
PROXIMO
(points)
Down that corridor is the butchery
-- the blood sloughs lead to the
Tiber.
Gods watch over you.
MAXIMUS
You're not coming?
PROXIMO
They are killing my men!
He races back into the tunnel.
Maximus moves quickly down the corridor.
He can finally
see...
COLOSSEUM - BUTCHERY - NIGHT
Grisly carcasses of every description hang from hooks.
Two bored butchers hack them up.
The good bits are tossed
into a wagon to fed to the Colosseum animals.
The waste
and offal are shoveled into a large sewer opening.
A
butcher occasionally lifts a sluice-gate and a gush of
water flows into the sewer from above, washing down the
blood and carcasses.
Maximus crouches and creeps through the nightmare of
hanging carcasses and flies.
When the butchers are looking elsewhere, Maximus creeps to
the sewer opening and climbs in -- he immediately slides
down for a few yards in the slanting, slippery blood
sluice -- out of sight --
Then he thuds to a stop.
He can go no further because the
remains of an animal carcass blocks his way.
He tries to
slither past the carcass --
Finally, one of the butchers above lifts the sluice-gate
and a torrent of water flows down.
Maximus is washed down the hideous sewer.
TUNNELS - NIGHT
Proximo and Juba are quickly marching back down the tunnel
toward the compound -- they are very close now -- the roar
of flame is heard -- the creak of falling timber -- and
the screams of burning men.
They run.
They round a corner and see there is no way past the world
of flame ahead of them.
The tunnel to the compound has
collapsed.
PROXIMO
Gods... they're killing them all.
Proximo leads them up a cramped stairway to...
VARIOUS LOCATIONS - ARREST MONTAGE - NIGHT
A quick sequence of brutal arrests as Praetorian Guard
units round up many associated with the plot.
And many
that are not.
GAIUS' BEDROOM:
Gaius and his wife are yanked awake and
hauled out.
CHRISTIAN HOME:
A congregation of Christians is chained
together, their secret altar smashed.
CAFE:
Greek Scholars are hauled away from their scrolls.
STREET THEATER:
Actors are dragged off in the midst of a
performance.
GRACCHUS' STEAM ROOM:
Gracchus is enjoying grapes with
his handsome catamite.
A unit of Praetorian bursts in.
Gracchus looks at them.
Sighs.
PALACE - THRONE ROOM - NIGHT
Commodus stands with Lucius on a balcony overlooking the
city.
The roaring flames of the fire at Proximo's compound can
easily be seen.
LUCIUS
What is that fire?
COMMODUS
Why that's a bonfire, Lucius.
I
arranged it just for you.
He puts his hand on the boy's shoulder.
Behind them, Lucilla sits slumped in a chair.
Her face is
a mask of anguish at what she has been forced to do.
Two Praetorians enter with a bucket.
PRAETORIAN
Caesar...
Commodus goes to them.
He talks quietly with them for a
moment and glances at what they are carrying.
COMMODUS
Oh... that's for my sister.
They bring the bucket to Lucilla and set it before her.
Commodus ignores her and goes back to Lucius on the
balcony.
Lucilla glances inside the bucket...
Captain Marcellus' head is floating in brine.
Lucilla
moans.
All is lost.
PALACE - COMMODUS' BEDROOM - MORNING
A castrati choir sings a gentle hymn of celebration.
Their eerie voices and otherworldly harmonies undulate
around Commodus' bedroom.
The Emperor himself is in a chair, wrapped in a robe.
His
body slaves work over him closely.
He is staring into a mirror, lost in another world as the
slaves carefully apply golden eye makeup to him.
The castrati hymn continues...
COLOSSEUM - BOWELS - DAY
Proximo leads them through a series of catacombs -- damp
tunnels shoot off in every direction -- everywhere around
them the heavy machinery of the games rise like mammoth
creatures to the arena above -- a baroque network of ropes
and pulleys and counterweights and elevator platforms and
air shafts and blood sewers -- And they suddenly run
directly into Commodus, dragging Lucius, and his six
Centurions coming the other direction.
The final battle begins with no preamble --
Maximus launches himself forward -- instantly separating
Commodus and Lucius -- he slams at Commodus with his sword
-- Commodus slams back --
Proximo and Juba race into the six Centurions -- a wild
free-for-all as they prove their worth as warriors -- Juba
fights with his usual elegant precision -- Proximo fights
as a man reborn, alive again --
Proximo takes cagey advantage of his knowledge of this
subterranean world -- spinning around machinery and
leaping over blood sewers and swinging heavy
counterweights --
Maximus and Commodus hack at each other with all the fiery
passion in them -- Commodus is a perfect match for Maximus
and equally ruthless -- their swords thrust and parry and
slice at amazing speed -- one false move, one mistake,
means death --
Meanwhile, the battle is turning into a victory for Juba
and Proximo -- they are defeating the Centurions --
Commodus sees this -- and sees Lucius crying in a
corner --
He screams to one of his remaining Centurions:
COMMODUS
KILL THE BOY!
Maximus whirls to Lucius -- Commodus attacks -- slashing
Maximus' shoulders -- Maximus sees Proximo racing to try
and save Lucius as he spins back to battle Commodus --
A Centurion raises his sword to kill Lucius -- Juba kills
his final opponent, turns -- Proximo just manages to push
Lucius out of the way -- the Centurion's sword slices into
him --
Juba flings his sword across the room -- the final
Centurion falls --
Maximus sees Proximo collapse to a wall -- dying --
Proximo locks eyes with Maximus as he slides down the
wall.
The old pirate shrugs.
And is dead.
Juba races to Lucius and holds the boy, turning his face
away from the slaughter --
Maximus, his furious passion redoubled at Proximo's death,
attacks Commodus with every ounce of strength in him --
Commodus' eyes begin to flash with something we have never
seen before, fear.
Maximus strikes mercilessly -- forcing Commodus steadily
back until they are fighting atop one of the elevator
platforms to the arena above.
MAXIMUS
For my wife!
Maximus strike hard -- Commodus barely blocks the blow --
MAXIMUS
For my son!
He strikes harder -- Commodus is losing --
MAXIMUS
For my father!
He strikes with everything he's got -- slashing Commodus
-- Commodus sails back -- his sword falling --
Maximus stands over him.
Glaring.
Commodus is panting,
defeated, glaring up at him.
A beat.
MAXIMUS
We who are about to die salute you.
Maximus raises his sword high -- Commodus raises an arm --
Maximus SMASHES the sword down -- and Commodus is dead.
A moment as Maximus stands over Commodus.
Then he looks
at the series of counterweight ropes around the elevator
platform.
He slices through one of the ropes and the platform begins
to rise...
