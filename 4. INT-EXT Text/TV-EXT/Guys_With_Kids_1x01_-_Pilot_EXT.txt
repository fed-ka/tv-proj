      NICK S WIFE EMILY, WHO IS AS CUTE, BUBBLY AND ENERGETIC AS 
      NICK IS LAID BACK, FEEDS FRED IN A HIGHCHAIR.  NICK CRAWLS IN 
      ON ALL FOURS WITH VIOLET RIDING HIM LIKE A HORSE.

                                  NICK

                Are we doing anything next Saturday 

                night?

                                  EMILY

                Why?  You re not going to try and make 

                me like The Walking Dead again are 

                you?

                                  NICK
                      (Standing)

                No.  I was thinking it s been a while 

                since I ve taken you out for one of my 

                famous Rico Suave nights of pleasure 

                and decadence--

      BEFORE NICK CAN FINISH EMILY HAS SPRINTED ACROSS THE ROOM AND 
      MOUNTED HIS CHEST LIKE A BABY CHIMP.

                                  EMILY

                I love you, I love you, I love you. 

                Wait, wait, wait...

      WHILE STILL CLINGING TO NICK EMILY REACHES PAST HIS HEAD AND 
      PULLS TWO GLASSES AND A BOX OF EMERGEN-C FROM THE CABINETS. 

                                  EMILY (CONT D)

                We cannot get sick.  

                                  NICK

                I m not going to get sick.                                              DILFs - "PILOT"              20.


                                  EMILY

                Nick, you re exhausted.  You work 

                until 9 and then you re up at 5 with 

                Freddie.  

                                  NICK

                Hey, when Freddie Nelms throws a 

                Bristle Block party you show up.

                                  EMILY
                      (Emily pries open Nick s 
                        mouth and peers in)

                It s like a canker sore convention in 

                there.  You re exhausted.  You do too 

                much.  And if you get sick and miss 

                our date I will kill you.  I love you.  

                Drink it.  Now.

      NICK CHOKES IT DOWN.  THERE S A KNOCK AT THE DOOR.  EMILY 
      ANSWERS IT.  IT S CHRIS.

                                  EMILY (CONT D)
                      (Giving Chris a warm hug)

                Chris!  Congratulations!  Nick says 

                you, like us, have a hot date.

                                  CHRIS

                Hot doesn t do it justice.  This woman 

                is so... 
                      (noticing Violet)

                Smart and nice and good at math and 

                science.

                                  EMILY

                But you re going to lie to Sheila 

                about it.  That s not right.                                              DILFs - "PILOT"              21.


                                  CHRIS
                      (To Nick)

                Wow, you really do tell her 

                  everything.  Well, it just so happens 

                I took your awesome advice and told 

                Sheila I have a date.  And she will 

                not watch Ernie.  So I m getting a 

                  baby-sitter.

                                  NICK

                And Sheila s cool with that?

                                  CHRIS
                      (Carefully wording)

                She was really glad we discussed it. 

                                  NICK
                      (Buying it)

                See,  I told you moving into my 

                building was a good idea.  
                      (Taking Chris s hands)

                I knew that, together, we could find 

                your balls. 

                                  CHRIS

                Well, now you have to find me a baby-

                sitter.  Preferably someone super 

                illegal.  

                                  EMILY

                Oh, Kelly would be great!  Babies love 

                her.  She s morbidly obese.

                                  CHRIS

                Done.                                            DILFs - "PILOT"              22.


                                  NICK

                Awesome.  Now, what are you going to 

                wear? 

                                  CHRIS

                Those jeans that show my bulge?

      CHRIS LOOKS TO EMILY FOR APPROVAL.  SHE NODS:  SURE. 

                                  NICK

                Well, whatever shirt you pick, make 

                sure it has applesauce and puke stains 

                on it like the one you re wearing now.
