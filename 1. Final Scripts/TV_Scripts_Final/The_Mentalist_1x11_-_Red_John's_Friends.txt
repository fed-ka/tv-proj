      FADE IN:

      EXT. RENFREW ESTATE. SACRAMENTO - DAY (D/1)11

      A big old house with extensive grounds behind high walls and 
      ornate iron gates.  Police vehicles are parked every which 
      way.  A mobile command center is set up.  Cops hustle to and 
      fro.  A SWAT TEAM enters the house.

22INT. RENFREW ESTATE - CONTINUOUS 

      The SWAT team moves cautiously through the graceful old 
      house. 

      INT. BACK HALLWAY. RENFREW ESTATE - CONTINUOUS33

      THREE SWAT GUYS creep across a wide, bare hallway (used 
      partly for storage) in the old servant's quarters; toward a 
      closed door.  They reach the door, and one very carefully 
      tries the handle.  Locked.  The SWAT guys exchange hand-
      signals, prepping to go in...

      INT. BACK BEDROOM. RENFREW ESTATE - DAY44

      JARED RENFREW (30 s) sits on the edge of a bed, in a daze.  
      He s covered in blood.  Next to him on the bed is a bloody 
      knife.  In the other, he holds the cold dead hand of UNDINE 
      KOPECKI, a young woman lying dead on the bed in her 
      underwear, stabbed to death.  

      We note the old fashioned key in the door.  A small barred 
      window.  The closed door suddenly BURSTS OPEN, kicked in by a 
      masked SWAT GUY.  

                                  SWAT GUY
                    Down on the floor!  Down on the 
                    floor! 

      As the SOUNDS of a violent takedown continue O.S.,              
      WE MOVE IN CLOSE and stay on Undine's melancholy face. 

      EXT. FRONT GATEHOUSE. FOLSOM PRISON - DAY (D/2)55

      PATRICK JANE stands still, gazing into space, waiting. 

      A door opens, and he moves forward, makes his way through 
      security gates and metal detectors into the prison.  

      CAPTION: TWO YEARS LATER          THE MENTALIST    "Red John's Friends"    GREEN 10/22/08    2.


      EXT. EXERCISE YARD. FOLSOM PRISON - DAY66

      Jane stands opposite Jared Renfrew, separated by a fence.  
      Jane s anxious, suspicious, watchful.  Jared is a well-spoken 
      clever sexy rich bad boy who took one too many wrong turns in 
      life.  

                                  JARED 
                    Thank you for coming.

                                  JANE
                    You said you have information about 
                    Red John.

                                  JARED
                    Yes I do.  He killed your wife and 
                    daughter eh?  

                                  JANE
                    Yes.

                                  JARED
                    I've heard a lot about you.  I 
                    heard that you can tell when people 
                    are lying.  

                                  JANE
                    Do you have information about Red 
                    John?

                                  JARED
                    I have dynamite information about 
                    Red John.  Enough to catch him.

                                  JANE
                    How do you come by this 
                      information?

                                  JARED
                    Red John is a friend of a friend of 
                    mine.

                                  JANE
                    Is this friend in prison too?

                                  JARED
                    I have friends from all walks of 
                    life.

                                  JANE 
                    Okay.  Tell me. 




                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST    "Red John's Friends"    GREEN 10/22/08    3.

                                  JARED 
                    I'm serving twenty-five to life for 
                    a crime I didn't commit.  My last 
                    appeal just failed.  Get me out of 
                    here and I will give you Red John.

                                  JANE
                    You raped and murdered your family 
                      housekeeper's daughter.  If you 
                    have heard a lot about me, you'd 
                    know I m not a real magician.  

                                  JARED
                    I didn't do it.

                                  JANE
                    I read the case file.  The physical 
                    evidence and the testimony of all 
                    the witnesses, including your own 
                    family, says you did. 

                                  JARED
                    I didn't kill her.  I loved Undine.  
                    I was going to marry her.  Thought 
                    about it anyhow.  I didn't kill 
                    her. 

                                  JANE
                    What happened?

                                  JARED
                    I don't know.  We were partying.  
                    I did some blow, a little meth.  We 
                    had sex, I fell asleep.  Next thing 
                    I know, it's morning, Undine's dead 
                    and the cops are busting in.  Good 
                    morning to you too.

                                  JANE
                    The door was locked from the 
                    inside.  

                                  JARED
                    Yes.  I locked it when we got 
                    there. For privacy.

                                  JANE
                    So how is it even physically 
                    possible that anyone else could 
                    have done the murder?





                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST    "Red John's Friends"    GREEN 10/22/08    4.

      CONTINUED: (2)66

                                  JARED
                    I don't know.  But I didn't.  Ergo, 
                    someone else did.  Someone that you 
                    can find.  You see me.  Am I lying 
                    to you?  

                                  JANE 
                    You seem to be telling the truth.  
                    But you're a clever and 
                      unprincipled narcissist in a 
                    desperate corner.  Even if you are 
                    innocent, it doesn't mean you know 
                    anything about Red John.  It's a 
                    close call.  I have to say no.  

      Jane turns to go.

                                  JARED
                    Your wife, Red John painted her 
                    toenails, didn't he?

      Hooked, Jane stops, does a slow turn.

                                  JARED (CONT'D)
                    Yes.  Painted them with her blood.  
                    Creepy.  The cops never made that 
                    public, did they?  

      Jane stares, transfixed.  

                                  JARED (CONT'D)
                    She's the only instance he did that 
                    huh?  A little touch of elegance 
                    for you alone.  

      Beat.  Jane looks stern, almost menacing.

                                  JANE
                    How do you know that?

                                  JARED
                    I told you, Red John is a friend of 
                    a friend of mine.  

                                  JANE 
                    What's the name of your friend?

                                  JARED
                    His name is get me out of here, 
                    then I will tell you.  That and 
                    much more.  I will sing like a 
                    bird.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST    "Red John's Friends"    GREEN 10/22/08    5.

                    Okay.  

      Jane looks around, studying the place, as if he might get him 
      out there and then. 

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    I'll get you out of here.

      INT. MINELLI'S OFFICE. CBI HQ - DAY (D/2 CONT'D)88

      MINELLI, Jane and LISBON sitting around the desk

                                    MINELLI
                    No.  I said no.  And I mean no.  
                    It's not that I don't want to help 
                    you.  I want to help you.  But it's 
                    not physically possible.  Jared 
                    Renfrew was tried and convicted.  
                    It's a closed case.  I have no 
                    authority to re-open it without 
                    cause.  

                                  JANE
                    There is cause.

                                    MINELLI
                    For you there's cause.  Not for the 
                    State of California.  We can't 
                    touch it.

                                  JANE
                    But we could --

                                    MINELLI
                    -- Closed case.  Nothing to be 
                    done.  The Justice Department 
                    doesn't go about undoing its own 
                    work.  

      Jane takes a beat, restrains himself.

                                  JANE 
                      I understand.  No problem. If we 
                    can't touch it, we can't touch it. 

                                    MINELLI
                    I'm sorry.

      Jane stands up to go.

                                  JANE
                    Hey, no.  The law is the law.  
                    My desire for revenge doesn't 
                    outweigh the rules.  I have to 
                    accept that.

                                  JANE
                    Thanks for your time.

      Jane exits.  

                                    MINELLI
                    Lying through his teeth, isn't he?

                                  LISBON
                          (rueful smile)
                    Yes.

                                    MINELLI 
                    Don't let him out of your sight.

                                  LISBON
                    Who am I, secret squirrel?  I'm not 
                    going to spy on him.

                                    MINELLI
                    But you have to keep him under 
                    control somehow.  

                                  LISBON
                    How?  This is the reason he's 
                    alive.  To find Red John. 

                                    MINELLI
                    He's going to go crashing into this 
                    thing and cause a huge mess.  I can 
                    feel it.  

                                  LISBON 
                    Probably.  It was bound to happen 
                    some day.  Nature of the beast.  
                    You knew that.

                                    MINELLI
                    Do you really want to lose him?  
                    Because that's what'll happen if he 
                    goes off the rails.  We lose him.

                    Jane, I know better than to try and 
                    stop you from doing what you think 
                    you have to do.  

                                  JANE
                    No, no, I'm fine with it.  I can 
                    see Minelli's point.  I can't be 
                    running after every nutbag with a 
                    good story, can I?

      Lisbon doesn't believe him for a second.

                                  LISBON
                    Sure.  You're fine with it.  Will 
                    you do me the favor of listening to 
                    me for one moment?  So I can say I 
                    told you so later?

                                  JANE 
                    Yes.

                                  LISBON
                    Jared Renfrew was found hugging the 
                    corpse of Undine Kopecki in a 
                      windowless room, locked from the 
                    inside.  He was naked, high as a 
                    kite, with a bloody butcher knife 
                    in his hand.  His semen was found 
                    inside her.  He'd been stalking her 
                    for weeks.  He has a history of 
                    violence going back fifteen years.  

                                  JANE
                    What's your point?

                                  LISBON
                    He's guilty.  You're being conned.

                    Possible.  I don't think so.  But I 
                    have to find out, one way or the 
                    other.  

                                  LISBON
                    Even if he's telling the truth 
                    about the murder, he could still be 
                    lying about Red John.     

                                  JANE
                    Also possible.  I have to take the

      Lisbon kind of leans back in a tacit acceptance that Jane

                    Minelli wants me to keep watch on

                    I'm not going to follow you around.    
                    Let's compromise.  When you get 
                    into trouble, call me first, so I 
                    can try and limit the damage.

      Jane raises a hand in acknowledgement as he goes.  

      EXT. RENFREW ESTATE - DAY1010

      Jane strolls up to the closed iron gates, presses a button on 
      an up to date intercom system. 

                                    HOUSEKEEPER (O.S.)

      A beat.  Jane waves his arms in a wizard's open sesame 
      gesture, and as if prompted by him, the GATES GLIDE OPEN

      house.

1111INT. LIVING ROOM. RENFREW ESTATE - DAY 

      Amid elegant, but casual country club decor, GARDNER RENFREW 
      (late 30's) is an affable, but hard-nosed investment fund 
      manager type of guy.  Sitting alongside him is his regulation 
      issue pretty brunette Van Cleef and Arpelled WASP wife -- 
      BRECK (30's) -- who affects that non-committal half-smile of 
      the well bred lady.  Gardner looks at Jane with wary 
      suspicion.  He fingers a pack of cigarettes and a lighter, 
      but never uses them. 

      A HOUSEKEEPER puts a glass of water down in front of Jane.

                                  JANE 
                    Thank you so much.

                    Is that your father?

                                    GARDNER
                    Yes.  What's this all about, Mr. 
                    Jane?  Who are you and what do you 
                    mean by this?

                                  JANE
                    Do you think your brother is

                                    GARDNER
                    You said you can prove he's 
                    innocent.  You said you know who 
                    really did it.

                                  JANE
                    Oh that was just to get inside the 
                    house.  I have no idea who might 
                    have done it.  It might have been

                    He seemed to be telling the truth.  
                    What do you think?

      Gardner's mad.  He goes all quiet and calm.

                                    GARDNER
                    I think you had better leave right 
                    now, Mr. Jane.  I haven't the time 
                    or patience for tomfoolery.

      Gardner stands, Breck follows suit.  But Jane is perfectly 
      happy to remain seated.

                                  JANE
                    So you think he's guilty.  I'm 
                    wasting my time.

                                    GARDNER
                    We're done talking.

                                  JANE
                    Suppose I could prove he was 
                    innocent?  Wouldn't you want that?  
                    Wouldn't you want that blot on your 
                    name expunged? 

                                  BRECK
                    Of course he would!  

                                    GARDNER
                    Nothing would make me happier.  
                    But my brother is guilty.  He 
                    violated that poor girl.  He 
                    violated this house.  He violated 
                    this family.  

                                  JANE
                    That's all I needed to know.  
                    Thanks for your time.  Your mother

                    Breck, go call the police.

      Jane looks around and heads for the most likely route to the 
      back of the house.  Gardner follows.  Then Breck, on the 
      phone.

      Jane emerges from the main house and heads for the little 
      guesthouse. 

      When Gardner hurries to catch him, Jane breaks into a trot. 

      MURIEL RENFREW (60's) -- high class and knows it -- is 
      gardening or rather, supervising a GARDENER when she sees 
      Jane and her son come hurrying across the lawn toward her.

                                    GARDNER

                    He's some kind of crazy person. 

      Jane smiles winningly.

                    I'll deal with him Mother.  The 
                    police are on their way.  Just go

                    I'm a friend of his.  I'm trying to 
                    prove his innocence.

                                  MURIEL
                    Come and sit down.

      She leads Jane toward a patio and a table and chairs...

                                    GARDNER
                    Mother.  You're being childish. 

                                  MURIEL
                    Go away, Gardner. 

                                    GARDNER
                    Mother...

                                  MURIEL
                    Go away.

      He goes away.  Muriel and Jane sit down on the patio.  
      There's a tea serving tray and a PAPERBACK MYSTERY NOVEL on 
      the table (Agatha Christie).  Muriel studies Jane.  He looks 
      back without guile.

                                  MURIEL (CONT'D)
                    Jane.  Like the girl or the Indian 
                    religion?

                                  JANE
                    Like the girl.  

                                  MURIEL
                    Now tell me Mr. Jane, why do you 
                    wish to prove my son's innocence?

                                  JANE
                      Friendship.  Justice. 

      Muriel's polite smile and silent gaze manages to convey that 
      she doesn't believe a word and won't cooperate until she's 
      satisfied.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    I have reasons of my own.  You 
                    don't need to know about them. 

                                  MURIEL
                    Of course.  As usual with Jared. 
                    Some sinister intrigue.

                    I can promise you I'm not up to 
                    anything sinister, ma'am.  
                    My motives are pure.  Well, I try 
                    anyway.  It's difficult, isn't it?     
                    To have pure motives.  Things get 
                    jumbled up.  

                                  MURIEL
                    Yes they do.

                                  JANE 
                    Tell me about Jared.

                                  MURIEL 
                    I love him dearly, but I'm not 
                    surprised he is where he is.  He 
                    was a troubled child.  Charming and 
                    bright, but a bully and a liar. 
                    Something of a sadist.

                                  JANE
                    Which were qualities you rather 
                    liked in him I expect.  At first.

      Muriel is quietly impressed by the insight.

                                  MURIEL
                    Yes.  I did.  I found him rather 
                    amusing.  At first.  One doesn't 
                    want a wimp for a son.  But there 
                    must be a sense of proportion and 
                      moderation.  As he got older, he 
                    got worse.  Fell in with bad 
                    people.  It was one scandal after 
                    another.  In and out of prison.    
                    A common criminal.

                                  JANE
                    But he turned himself around, 
                    didn't he?

                                  MURIEL
                    He claimed he had.  He gave up the 
                    drink and drugs and the 
                      gallivanting.  Made peace with his 
                    brother, and came home to help run 
                    the family businesses. 

                                  JANE
                    The prodigal son.

                    Yes.  George, his father, was 
                      overjoyed.  I was skeptical.  
                    Pleased of course.  But skeptical.  
                    As my mother used to say, y'are 
                    what y'are. 

                                  JANE
                    I guess she was right.

                                  MURIEL
                    Yes.  Poor George dropped dead a 
                    week after the murder.  Broke his 
                    heart, people said.  George didn't 
                    really have a heart in that sense.  
                    He died of embarrassment.  A 
                    Renfrew in the pokey for murder. 
                    Quelle horreur. 

                                  JANE 
                    What happened the night of the 
                    murder? 

                                  MURIEL
                    You saw it in the news like 
                    everyone else no doubt.  Jared went 
                    on a drug binge and raped and 
                    killed Undine.

                                  JANE
                    You're sure it was him.

                                  MURIEL
                    How can I doubt it?  I wish I 
                    could.  

                                  JANE
                    Will you show me where it happened?

1414INT. BACK HALLWAY. RENFREW ESTATE - DAY 

      Jane and Muriel walking and talking, entering a wide UTILITY 
      AREA in the servants' quarters.

                                  JANE 
                    Who else was in the house?

                                  MURIEL
                    I had a small dinner party.  
                    Probably ten people all told.  
                    After they left, it was just 
                    family.  Wesley and Breck and 
                    George and I.  And Jared of course.

                                  MURIEL
                    No.  She didn't live in.  Undine 
                    was only here to help the cook with 
                    the dinner party.

      They enter...

      INT. BACK BEDROOM. RENFREW ESTATE - DAY1515

      The room is empty now, except for the bed frame.  And a table 
      and chair.  Jane looks around.  Muriel watches him.

                                  MURIEL 
                    She was a lovely girl.  Full of 
                    life and promise.  Her mother 
                    Mariska had been with us for twenty 
                    years.  Part of the family. 

                                  JANE 
                    Jared says he and Undine were 
                    having an affair.  That he loved 
                    her.  Would never have hurt her.

                                  MURIEL 
                    Undine told her mother that he was 
                    stalking her.  She was scared of 
                    him.  She didn't go to the police 
                    out of respect for the family.

                                  JANE
                    I'd like to speak to her mother. 
                    Mariska, is it?

                                  MURIEL
                    She left our employ I'm afraid.  It 
                    was too difficult.  For both of us. 

                                  JANE
                    Where is she now?  

                                  MURIEL
                    I have an address somewhere.

                                  JANE
                    I'll need that.

                          (vaguely)
                    Yes, I'll have a look for it.

      He says it with such charm that she obeys.

                                  MURIEL 
                    As you wish.

      Muriel exits to get the address.  

      INT. BACK HALLWAY. RENFREW ESTATE - DAY15A15A

      Moving back out into the hallway, Jane looks around, noting 
      the stuff stored in the hallway (including fishing tackle).  
      He closes the bedroom door and kneels to study it at floor 
      level.  There's an inch gap at the bottom of the door.  Jane 
      puts his fingers under the door.  He takes the door key out 
      and examines it closely, then he peers through the keyhole.  
      Standing up, he has a big smile on his face, which fades when 
      he sees TWO BEEFY POLICEMEN are coming down the hallway.  
      Behind them, Gardner and Breck.

                                  POLICEMAN
                    Sir, would you come with us?

                                  JANE
                    Why?

                                  POLICEMAN
                    You're trespassing here.

                                  JANE
                    No I'm not.

                                  POLICEMAN
                    Okay, sir.  This man here is the 
                    home owner and he says you don't 
                    have permission to be here.  So 
                    let's go, partner.

                                  JANE
                    Officer, it's the other way around.  
                    I'm the home owner and that man's 
                    the intruder.

                                    GARDNER
                    That's a lie.  He's lying.

                                  JANE
                    Listen to the madness in his voice.  
                    Will you please take him somewhere 
                    he can get help?

                    Yes yes.  It's quite alright, 
                    Officer.  You can go.

      She makes a peremptory shooing gesture at the Cop and offers 
      Jane the slip of paper.

                                  JANE
                    Thank you so much.  Goodbye, Mrs.

                    I am asking you, man to man, as a 
                    fellow human being, don't make us 
                    relive the horror of what my 
                    brother did.  

                                  JANE
                    Where were you the night of the 
                    murder?

                                    GARDNER
                    You sonofabitch.

                                  JANE
                    Were you here?  

      Gardner swings at Jane amateurishly enough for Jane to avoid 
      the blow. 

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    I'll take that as a yes.  You 
                    always hated your brother, didn't 
                    you?     

                                    GARDNER
                    Get out of here!

      Jane raises a hand in farewell and walks away.

      Minelli in a bad temper, pacing.  Jane seated.  Lisbon 
      leaning in the doorway.

                    Gardner Renfrew is a player in this

                    and screw around with him.

                    Why not?  It's a free country.

                    Well you should have lied as you so 
                    often do, because now I have to 
                    give you an official reprimand, and 
                    order you in the strongest possible 
                    terms to leave the Renfrew family 
                    alone and drop the whole matter.  

                                  JANE 
                    I'm sorry.  I can't do that.  

      Minelli sighs.

                                    MINELLI 
                    You have to.  This is straight from

                    Do you have evidence of that?

                    Not yet.  I have pieces.  That I'm 
                    piecing together.  He's innocent.  

                                    MINELLI
                    Wake up, Dorothy, you're not in Kansas 
                    anymore.  There's innocent men in 
                    jail.  It happens.  Is he one of them?  
                    I don't know.  I doubt it.  In any 
                    case, we can't re-open his case.  

                                  JANE
                    If I'm Dorothy, who are you?

      Minelli considers that for a beat.  Lisbon smiles.

                                    MINELLI
                    Never mind who I am.  We'll find 
                    other ways of making Renfrew talk 
                    to you.  There's a lot that can be 
                    done to make a prisoner's life 
                    easier, if he cooperates.

                                  JANE 
                    That won't work.  He's innocent.

                    Okay, here it is.  If you pursue this 
                    any further, I'll have to throw you 
                    out of the CBI.  We can't take the 
                      liability.  I very much do not want to

      FADE IN:

      EXT. SACRAMENTO STREET - DAY (D/3)1717 *

      Jane, walking down one of those surreal Bay area streets 
      where a vista of sea, sky and graceful bridges are the 
      gorgeous backdrop to heavy-duty urban funk.  Battered little 
      shotgun bungalows with dirt yards.  

      Jane checks the slip of paper and goes to the door of one of 
      the bungalows.  It's abandoned, padlocked and shuttered like 
      several others on the block.  A HIGH-END BUT N.D. BLACK SEDAN  
      rolls up across the street.

      Jane looks around for someone to ask.  A scruffy woman four 
      doors down peers at him warily.

                                  JANE
                    Hi.  I'm looking for Mariska 
                    Kopecki?

      The woman slinks out of sight silently.  On Jane, stymied. 

1818INT. LISBON'S OFFICE. CBI HQ - DAY 

      At her desk, Lisbon's typing out a report.  She looks up to 
      find CHO, RIGSBY and VAN PELT standing at her desk with 
      solemn expressions.

                                  LISBON
                    Don't bother.  I know.  I feel the 
                    same.  Nothing to be done.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Now when he really needs our help, 
                    we're letting him down. 

                                  LISBON
                    I want to help him as much as you 
                    do.  Our orders state that we must 
                    leave this case alone. 

                                  VAN PELT
                    I don't care what our orders say.  
                    It's not right.

                    Cases are not the point.  It's not 
                    that we need him.  He needs us.

                                  LISBON 
                    Yes, but he needs our help on a 
                    fool's errand.  Renfrew's a conman.  
                    He doesn't know anything about Red 
                    John.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Suppose we found a connection 
                    between Renfrew and Red John?  

                                  LISBON
                    That would... Oh wait. 

      Lisbon has spotted the file in Van Pelt's hand that she is 
      about to present to Lisbon in triumph.

                    What's in the file?  Let me guess.  
                      A connection between Renfrew and 
                    Red John.

      Van Pelt hands over the file, blushing, but pleased with her 
      work.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Seven years ago, Renfrew was 
                    serving time on a narcotics 
                      conviction.  Shared a cell in 
                    Lompoc with a man named Orval 
                    Tanner.  Tanner claimed at his 1998 
                    trial for murder that he had only 
                    been an accomplice, that the real 
                    killer was a man who went by the 
                    name Red John.  Nobody believed 
                    him.

                    98, near the beginning of Red 
                    John's career.  Where's this Tanner 
                    now?

                    if we weren't ordered to stay away 
                    from this case.

                    assistant to the Deputy Records

                    Why do people say Eureka when they 
                    do something good?

                    It's greek for bingo.  

                                  VAN PELT
                    Well so, eureka.  I found the 
                    autopsy reports and they back up 
                    Orval Tanner's story. The body of 
                    his alleged victim was cut up in 
                    the Red John style.  

                                  RIGSBY 
                    Which means Renfrew was telling at 
                    least some kind of truth about his 
                    Red John connection.

      Too late, they see Minelli enter and all switch to some other 
      mundane task with guilty looks.  Minelli cannot but be 
      suspicious.  He turns to the most vulnerable looking of them.

      Lisbon appears from her office.  She pretty much knows what 
      must have happened as soon as she sees their faces, but she 
      has to play it out...

                                  LISBON
                    Hey boss.

                                    MINELLI
                    I gave this unit a direct written 
                    order and they have flagrantly 
                    disobeyed that order.  Did they do 
                    this with your knowledge?

                                  LISBON
                    I ordered them to do it.  I told 
                    them that you countermanded your 
                    earlier order.  They had no 
                    knowledge whatsoever that they were 
                    doing anything irregular.  

      A mordant smile from Minelli

                    Nice try, Mother Teresa, but they 
                    already gave themselves up.

      Rigsby clams up, silently cursing his big mouth.  Lisbon 
      glares at them all for idiots, to blow it so easily.

                                  LISBON
                    I stand by my story.  They didn't 
                    know they were out of line.  

                                  CHO
                    Sir, the opposite is true.  We 
                    forced Agent Lisbon to let us do 
                    this.

                                    MINELLI
                    Very touching.  My wife would love

                    result in immediate suspension.  

      Lisbon takes a deep breath, and jumps in the deep end.

                    Sir, you might as well suspend me 
                    now.  Because there will be further 
                      infractions.  Jane needs our help, 
                    and he's going to get it.  I'm not 
                    going to lay off just because some 
                    fat cat has put the pressure on.

      Minelli does a slow burn.  He studies his mutinous unit with 
      a clinical eye.

                    You're all suspended, starting right 
                    now, for gross insubordination.

      Minelli exits, leaving them all stunned.

                    Renfrew couldn't dispute the

                    her.  Undine's mother testified

                    Nobody's allowed to do that.

                                  JANE
                    Yes.  Which means Renfrew is 
                    telling the truth.  He has the 
                    goods on Red John.

                                  LISBON
                    Take it easy, we've got nothing 
                    yet.

                                  JANE
                    Yes, we have to get Renfrew out of 
                    jail first.   

                                  LISBON
                    That's all.

                                  JANE
                    We will.  And then Red John will 
                    come after him.  He has to break 
                    cover.  He has to.  And we'll be 
                    waiting.  

      Jane's energized.  His eyes gleam with the thrill of the 
      hunt.  Lisbon looks worried.

                                                                          FADE OUT.

      EXT. MARIN CONDO APARTMENTS - DAY (D/4)2626

      STOCK - A high-end senior's lifestyle apartment complex with 
      a nautical theme.  A very different place from Mariska's 
      previous address.  

2727INT. HALLWAY. MARIN CONDO - DAY 

      Lisbon and Jane waiting at an apartment door.  Lisbon takes 
      out her badge wallet to show.

                                  JANE
                          (shakes his head)
                    Uh....

      Lisbon remembers, to her dismay, that she's not an agent. 
      Puts away the badge.  

                                  LISBON
                    Damn.

                                  JANE
                          (amused)
                    Yes, how are you going to get us in 
                    without your magic badge?

                                  LISBON
                    You do the talking.

                                  JANE
                    No, you try.

                                  LISBON
                    Don't be childish.  This is not...

      The door opens before Lisbon can say more.  MARISKA KOPECKI 
      (late 50's) is a Polish immigrant.  She's seen hard times, 
      and it shows, despite the designer label resort clothes and 
      botox.   

                                    MARISKA
                    Oh, I thought it was Harry.  Who 
                    are you?

                    Hi.  Vanna Clooney?

      Lisbon tries a smile.

                                  LISBON
                    I'm Teresa.  And this is Patrick.

                                    MARISKA 
                    Yes?

                                  LISBON
                    Can, can we come in for moment?

                                    MARISKA
                    What d'you want? 

      Lisbon gives Jane a pleading look.  Jane looks around 
        conspiratorially and leans in close to Mariska.

                                  JANE
                    It's about Harry. 

                                    MARISKA
                    What about him?

                                  JANE 
                    Best not to speak out here in 
                    public.

      Mariska's curiosity gets the better of her.  She lets them 
      in.

2828INT. LIVING ROOM. MARIN CONDO APARTMENT - DAY 

      Mariska, Jane and Lisbon sit down in a showily perfect living 
      room, straight out of a 'classy' catalog.  Not a single 
      personal touch.   A harassed looking MAID moves slowly around 
      the room, dusting methodically while Mariska watches her like 
      a hawk.  We see a PICTURE of Undine and Mariska together; 
      mother and daughter smiling at each other outside their 
      shabby old house.  

                                  JANE
                    I lied just now.  We're here to 
                    talk to you about your daughter, 
                    Undine.

      Mariska stands up.

                                    MARISKA
                    Get out.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST    "Red John's Friends"    GREEN 10/22/08    36.

      Jane fixes her with a firm Jedi gaze.

                                  JANE
                    Sit down, Mariska.  Sit down.

      Mariska obeys.  

                                    MARISKA
                    Who are you?

                                  JANE 
                    Listen to me.  The guilt and pain 
                    and shame you feel won't ever go 
                    away.  It won't go away until you 
                    tell the truth.  

                                    MARISKA
                          (agitated)
                    What truth?  What are you crazy?  
                    You don't know me, you don't know 
                    what I feel. 

                                  JANE
                    I know you.  When you came to this 
                    country as a young woman, you 
                    dreamed of doing great things.  
                    What a life you'd have!  And what 
                    did fate bring you?  Twenty-five 
                    years of drudgery.  A servant's 
                    life.  You hated every day of it.

                                    MARISKA
                    Who wants to be a servant?  Nobody.

                                  JANE
                    You did it for her, for Undine.  So 
                    that she would have a better life.

                                    MARISKA
                    Yes.

                                  JANE
                    And then she was gone.  Taken from 
                    you.  In a flash, your whole life, 
                    all those days of drudgery and 
                      humiliation, wasted.  What a joke 
                    eh?

                                    MARISKA
                    Yes.  A joke.  Ha ha.  What do you 
                    want from me?

                                    MARISKA
                    What's it matter who killed her?  
                    She's gone.  

                                  JANE 
                    You didn't say Jared.  That would 
                    be the obvious answer.

                                    MARISKA
                    Okay.  Jared killed her.  I don't 
                    care.

                                  JANE 
                    It's true, there's nothing you can 
                    do that will bring her back.  If 
                    you get paid to lie about what 
                    happened, where's the harm?    

      Mariska rubs her face. 

                                    MARISKA
                    What paid?  Nobody paid me 
                    anything.

                                  JANE
                    Don't lie to me.  Tell me the 
                    truth.  You took your twenty pieces 
                    of silver and bought the life you 
                    always wanted.

                                    MARISKA 
                    No.

                                  JANE
                    It's what you always wanted, but it 
                    means nothing, does it?  You regret 
                    taking that money now, don't you?  
                    Your life is empty. 

                                    MARISKA

      A JUNIOR DOJ LAWYER is passing through, pauses on seeing 
      Lisbon and Jane.

                    you're here?   

      Lisbon gives him a brief, deadly look.

3131EXT. RENFREW ESTATE - DAY 

      Wearing a stoic expression, Lisbon shows her CBI badge to 
      Breck Renfrew and the Housekeeper at the front door.  Rigsby 
      stands a step back...

                                  LISBON
                    We need to speak with your husband, 
                    ma'am.

      Off Breck's puzzled glance... 

3232INT. BACK HALLWAY. RENFREW ESTATE - DAY 

      Muriel and Breck are with Rigsby and Lisbon.  Gardner enters, 
      angry.  

                                    GARDNER
                    This is ridiculous.  Who's the 
                    agent in charge here? 

                                  LISBON
                    I'm Agent Lisbon.  I think you 
                    already know my colleague, Mr. 
                    Jane.  

      Jane appears, from nowhere, it seems.

                                  JANE
                    Hello.  I expect you're wondering 
                    why I gathered you all here.

                                    GARDNER
                          (outraged)
                    Breck, go call the police.

      Jane lays on the Jedi firmness.

                                  JANE
                    Mr. Renfrew.  Wait.  If you don't 
                    want your family ruined in a deluge 
                    of sordid scandal, you'll listen to 
                    me.

      Gardner hesitates...

                                    GARDNER
                    What are you talking about?

      Gardner takes a beat to process that.

                                    GARDNER
                    So what?  The fact is they were 
                    found in a locked room.  It's not 
                      physically possible for someone 
                    else to have gotten into the room 
                    to commit the murder. 

                                  JANE
                    Yes.  There's the rub, isn't it.  
                    The key was in the door.  Watch 
                    closely.  

      Jane takes off his jacket (or some such flourish).

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Rigsby, go inside and lock the 
                    door, would you?

      Rigsby goes inside the little bedroom, locks the door.

      OUT IN THE HALLWAY -- Jane takes a rolled newspaper from his 
      jacket pocket.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Suppose Jared and Undine are in the 
                    room, asleep. 

      He takes one sheet of newspaper, and slides it under the 
      bedroom door.  Taking a pencil from his pocket, he inserts it 
      into the keyhole.  With a sharp tap on the pencil end...

      ANGLE:  The key is knocked out of the keyhole and falls onto 
      the sheet of newspaper.  Jane pulls the sheet back under the 
      door, bringing the key with it.  He picks it up, unlocks the 
      door, opens it to reveal Rigsby, smiling. 

                                  BRECK
                    That's all very clever.  But how do 
                    you get out again?

      Jane closes the door again, locks it, extracts the key.  
      Then, he takes a five foot long piece of nylon fishing line 
      from his pocket.  He threads one end through the keyhole, and 
      feeds the line through until one end is touching the floor.  
      There's just enough room under the door for Jane to reach 
      under the door, grasp the line between two fingers and pull 
      it through.  He then swiftly ties the door key to the line, 
      (with a little hitch around the haft so that it hangs right)  
      and pulls the line gently back through the keyhole until the 
      key is drawn up and into the hole with a satisfying click.  




                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST    "Red John's Friends"    GREEN 10/22/08    43.

                    The line's still attached.

                                  JANE
                          (to Gardner)
                    May I borrow your lighter?

      Gardner is caught up in the show, doesn't think of refusing, 
      and gives Jane a disposable lighter.  Jane puts a flame to 
      the nylon line and in an instant it's gone without a trace.  
      Jane's very pleased with himself.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    That's how Jared was framed.  Cool 
                    uh? 

                                    GARDNER
                    Doesn't prove Jared's innocent, and 
                    it certainly doesn't prove anyone 
                    else is guilty.  It's a party 
                    trick.

                                  JANE
                    A party trick that a jury will 
                    love.  Put that together with 
                    Mariska's testimony, I think we 
                    have a pretty good chance of 
                    winning a new trial.  And then the 
                    truth will come out somehow I 
                    expect.  It always does.  Unless... 

                                    GARDNER
                    Unless what?

                                  LISBON
                    Unless we can work out some kind of 
                    financial deal here.  That would 
                    make it worth our while dropping 
                    the whole thing.   

      It takes a beat for this to sink in. 

                                    GARDNER
                    You want money?  You're trying to 
                    blackmail us?

                    nor there.  I asked you your price.

                                  JANE 
                    Your late husband was a handsome 
                    man.  

                                  MURIEL
                    Yes he was.  What's that to do with 
                    anything?

                                  JANE
                      Domineering though.  Had to have 
                    things his way.  He died how long 
                    after the murder?

                                  MURIEL
                    A month.  Aortic aneurysm.  

                                  AGNES
                    And when did Mariska leave your 
                    employ?

      Jane sees the guilty look that flashes across her face, and 
      knows he has found the truth.  Muriel tries to be casual.

                                  MURIEL
                    Around the same time.

                                  JANE 
                    After he died though.  

      Muriel is conscious of being found out.  

                                  MURIEL
                    Yes.

      Jane locks eyes with her.  Jane lets silence hang before 
      bringing down the axe.

                                  JANE 
                    You got rid of her as soon as you 
                    could after he died.  Because 
                    Undine was your husband's child, 
                    wasn't she?

                          (faintly)
                    Yes.  



                                  JANE
                    Did you ever confront him?  Or 
                    Mariska? 

                                  MURIEL
                    No.  I decided that I liked my life 
                    as it was.  I didn't want a drama, 
                    and I didn't want to be lied to.  
                    They never knew that I suspected.

                                  JANE
                    Eighteen years of secret anger.  
                    How did you stand it?

                                  MURIEL
                    Nobody's life is perfect.

                                  JANE
                    But then when you found out about 
                    Undine's affair with Jared, you 
                    must have been enraged. It's 
                    incest, practically.

                                  MURIEL 
                    It is.  It is incest.  When I found 
                    out, I told Jared that he was not to 
                    continue the affair.  He refused.  
                    Said he was in love with her.  
                    Refused to stop seeing her.  

                                  JANE
                    Didn't you tell him why you 
                    objected?

                                  MURIEL
                    Certainly not.  I couldn't tell 
                    him.  It was too sordid.  Too 
                      humiliating.  

                                  JANE 
                    So instead you killed Undine, paid 
                    off her mother, and sent your son 
                    to jail for life.   

                                  MURIEL
                    No.  I wouldn't do that. 




                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST    "Red John's Friends"    GREEN 10/22/08    49.

      Muriel takes up her handbag, opens an inner compartment, and 
      comes up with a small transparent vial of something dark and 
      congealed.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Is that...?

      MONTAGE:  The murder of Undine.  Which begins with Muriel 
      seeing Jared and Undine kissing passionately, then locking 
      themselves in the little bedroom.  Muriel puts on a long 
      plastic raincoat over her evening dress... Montage ends as 
      Muriel holds the sample jar in a stream of Undine's blood.  
      Jared lies beside Undine all the while, unconscious from

      Muriel hands Jane the vial.

                                  MURIEL
                    It's proof that I did it.  I took 
                    it so that I could confess and have 
                    Jared freed when I chose. Just as 
                    soon as he learned his lesson. 

                                  JANE 
                    What lesson is that?

                                  MURIEL
                      Everything in moderation.  
                    And listen to your mother.

                                  JANE
                    Can't argue with that.

                    We're ready to go get Jared 
                    Renfrew.  Is the safe house 
                    prepped?

                                  LISBON 
                    Yes.

                    Jane.  Please be careful.  Remember 
                    this is playing out just like Red 
                    John wants it to.

                                  JANE 
                    It's playing out like it has to.  
                    He has no choice but to try and 
                    silence Renfrew.  He has to show 
                    himself.  We're getting close.  
                    I can feel it.

                                  LISBON
                    You can feel it?  Like a psychic

                    You think you're playing him.

      Jane, Cho and Rigsby waiting for the gates to open.  When

                    Thank you.

                    I've kept my side of the bargain.  
                    Now it's your turn.  Tell what you 
                    know.

                                  JARED
                      Absolutely.  All will be revealed.

                    then we'll sit and talk as long as 
                    you like.  I got a lot to tell and 
                    I owe you big time, man.  I owe you 
                    my life.  In the meantime, I would 
                    kill for a a cheeseburger and 
                    fries.    

                                  JANE
                    Fair enough.

        Rigsby hands him a bulletproof vest.

                    Put this on.

                    You can't say please?  I'm a free 
                    man, aren't I?  

      Jane gives Rigsby a nod -- humor him.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Put this on, please.

                    Sure.

      Jared straps on the bulletproof vest.

      Rigsby at the wheel.  Jane and Jared and Cho handling burgers

      A STREET PROTEST halts traffic.  A mob of young unruly

      Cho and Rigsby look nervous.  The protesters eddy around the

                    He vanished eight hours ago and

      Jared sits on the end of a bed, holding a pink tiger skin 
      print cellphone to his ear.  Across the room, a dyed blonde 
      HOOKER is slowly and wearily taking off her clothes. 

                                  JARED
                    Mr. Jane, I'm calling to apologize 
                    for letting you down.

      INTERCUT JANE AND JARED:

                                  JANE
                    Hello, Jared.

      The team is galvanized.  Van Pelt starts tracking the call 
      via the computer. 

                                  JARED 
                    It's dishonorable, I know.  But 
                    crossing Red John is just too 
                      dangerous.  

                                  JANE
                    You already have crossed him.  You 
                    need our protection.

                                  JARED
                    I've given you nothing.

                                  JANE
                    How is he to know that?

                    Wouldn't you like to know.  Thanks 
                    for giving me my life back. 
                    I'm grateful.

                    Jared, listen to me.  They're not

      Jared turns off the phone, tosses it back to the Hooker, who 
      is now in her underwear.

      He puts down the phone.

                    Damned fool.  Friends he says.  Red John 
                    probably has his location already.

                    He wouldn't call if he didn't think 
                    he was out of our reach.  I could 
                    hear Latin music and sirens and 
                    horns and a whole neighborhood in 
                    the background, which suggests thin 
                    walls and a city.  Hence, a Tijuana

                    He must be using somebody's phone.  
                    And he's been in prison for a year.  
                    Hence, hooker.

                    The phone belongs to Juana Porfiria

      Cho touches Jane's arm and makes a sizzling noise.

                    I'll go reach out to the Federal

                    with me.

      Cho and Rigsby exit with Minelli.  A moment of clicking 
      silence while Van Pelt works...

4747EXT. TIJUANA (ESTABLISHING) - LATE DAY 

      A birds-eye view of the city from a chopper.

      INT. MOTEL ROOM. TIJUANA - NIGHT (N/5)4848

      The room that Jared and the Hooker were in.  Now empty. 
      There's an ineffable sense that someone has just left the 
      room.  And a faint, but ominously unidentifiable SOUND from 
      the bathroom, which is lit, though we can't see into it.  
      There's a broad swathe of blood like a giant red brush-stroke 
      across the floor and into the bathroom.

      BOOOOM!  The front door is kicked in.  Rigsby and Lisbon 
      enter the room in a wary crouch, guns drawn.  Jane peers 
      through the door, waiting to see what happens.  

      Rigsby's the first to go into the bathroom.

                                  RIGSBY (O.S.)
                          (horror)
                    Oh no.  Oh.

      Rigsby exits the bathroom, goes out the front door and shouts 
      to accompanying Mexican Cops. 

                                  RIGSBY (O.S.) (CONT D)
                          (in Spanish with 
                            subtitles)
                    Red John was here, a moment ago. 
                    He's still close by.  We can catch 
                    him if we set up a perimeter fast.

      As Jane and Lisbon and CAMERA go to the bathroom, a couple of 
      UNIFORMED MEXICAN COPS enter the front door. 

      INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS4949

      We get only an oblique glimpse of the bodies of Jared and the 
      Hooker in the bathtub, still warm, the last breath just gone 
      out of them. 

      Jared's finger still reaches out to the wall above the bath, 
      where he's written, in blood - 'HE IS MA.'

      INT. MOTEL ROOM. TIJUANA - A LITTLE LATER5050

      While MEXICAN FORENSICS GUYS do their work, Jane and Lisbon 
      sit on the edge of the bed, weary and disconsolate and dirty, 
      like lovers after an illicit tryst. 

                                  JANE
                    You can say it now.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST    "Red John's Friends"    GREEN 10/22/08    57.

                    Don't really feel like saying it 
                    right now.  Let me take a rain 
                    check on that. 

                                  JANE
                    Sure.

                                  LISBON 
                    What d'you think it means?

                                  JANE
                    It means Red John is far more 
                    powerful than I thought.  He's been 
                    way ahead of me the whole time.  

      She points to the bathroom.

                                  LISBON
                    I mean, the writing on the wall.  
                    "He is ma."

                                  JANE
                    Oh.  I have no idea.

                                  LISBON
                    It's a good clue though right?  
                    Jared was trying tell us something 
                      important. 

                                  JANE
                    Maybe.

      Beat.  Lisbon wants to give him a hug, he looks so sad.  But 
      she can't do that.

                                  LISBON 
                    Next time, we'll get him.

                                  JANE
                    Next time.

      Lisbon puts a consoling hand on his arm.  

      Suddenly, on the bedstand, the Hooker's PHONE BLASTS a 
      raucous snatch of CUMBIA.  Someone's calling.  

      Jane and Lisbon look at one another.  Jane's nearest.  He 
      answers it.  Listens.  Nothing said, but someone's there, 
      breathing.





                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST    "Red John's Friends"    GREEN 10/22/08    58.
