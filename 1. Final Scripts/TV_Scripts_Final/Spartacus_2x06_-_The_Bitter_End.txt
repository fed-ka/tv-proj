  FADE IN:


  INT. ATRIUM - BATIATUS  VILLA - DAY

  CLOSE on TITUS  DEAD FACE. Rot and decay have set in.  
  PERFUME AND FLOWERS burn to mask the stench.

  BATIATUS

  gazes down at Titus laying peacefully on a FUNERARY COUCH, 
  dressed in a ROMAN TOGA. Batiatus himself wears the rough 
  black robes of mourning, his face unshaven since his 
  father s death.

                                          MAGISTRATE SEXTUS (O.S.)
                      It is a heavy thing...

  Batiatus looks up to see MAGISTRATE SEXTUS. A knot of other 
  HONORED ROMANS mill about, paying their final respects.

                                          MAGISTRATE SEXTUS
                        Seeing a father, so strong in life, 
                        unable to rise.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The weight of it keenly felt.

                                          MAGISTRATE SEXTUS
                        Titus was much loved by this city.  
                        Hold comfort in the knowledge.

  Sextus moves off, nodding politely at LUCRETIA as she joins 
  Batiatus. Lucretia wears simple robes, her hair unwashed for 
  the period of mourning.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        The magistrate himself pays 
                        respect? A great honor.

                                        BATIATUS
                                  soft)(
                        For my father.

  Batiatus is a swirl of conflicting emotions.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Years I wished for blistering 
                        tongue to cool. Only to long for it 
                      to scorch ear once more.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    2.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        I know you did not wish him gone in 
                        such a manner. Nor did I, despite 
                        our many differences. Yet the gods 
                        have willed it.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The gods had no fucking hand in 
                        this.  Tullius  alone inflicts 
                        injury.

  Lucretia gauges the fire in Batiatus  eyes. Carefully stokes 
  the flames, wanting vengeance for what Tullius did to Gaia.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        And how shall it be answered?

  SOLONIUS interrupts.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Apologies. Unwelcome guest makes 
                        appearance.

  Batiatus follows Solonius  eyes, inflamed to spot VETTIUS.  
  Vettius smiles, moves across the room towards them.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Vettius.

                                  whispered)(
                        Temper emotion, and greet him with 
                        measured voice. It would serve no 
                        purpose to have confrontation in 
                        presence of the Magistrate.

                                          VETTIUS
                        Good Batiatus. My sympathy for the 
                        passing of your father. A titan, 
                        standing far above all who follow.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You come absent Tullius? I thought 
                        nothing could keep the man from 
                        observance of such tragedy.

                                          VETTIUS

                      of mourning comes to conclusion. 
                        Tomorrow the sun greets a ninth 
                        day, and with it we expect delivery 
                      of Gannicus.

                                        BATIATUS

                        and see yourselves well satisfied.

                        Then Tullius will be forced to

                      in the opening games of the new 
                        arena. And all that follow.

  Vettius exits. OFF BATIATUS  mounting fury...


  INT. BARRACKS - BATIATUS  LUDUS - DAY

  The air hangs solemn as CRIXUS straps on his gladiator gear.  
  BARCA, RHASKOS, and GNAEUS do the same.

                                        GNAEUS
                        Titus condemns our brothers to the 
                        mines.  Now we fucking honor him?

                                        CRIXUS
                      He was the dominus of this house. 
                        And deserves no less.

                                        BARCA
                        Spoken as a true champion.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    4.
  CONTINUED:

  Barca grins at Crixus. He half-heartedly returns it, his 
  attention pulled to GANNICUS as he passes. Heading for 
  Oenomaus  cell. Lost in troubled thought. OFF CRIXUS, 
  wrestling with his own over how he gained the title of 
  champion of the House of Batiatus...


  INT. OENOMAUS' CELL - BATIATUS  LUDUS - DAY

  Candles burn at OENOMAUS  altar. He kneels, stripped to the 
  waist, silently praying before a simple OSSUARY containing 
  Melitta s ashes.

  GANNICUS

  appears in the doorway behind him. He hesitates, devastation 
  and guilt welling. Oenomaus pauses, sensing him.

                                        GANNICUS
                        Apologies. Batiatus summons the 
                        men.

  Oenomaus nods, rises to strap on his chestplate. Silence 
  hangs heavy. Gannicus  eyes fall to the ossuary.

                                          GANNICUS(cont'd)
                        You will see her ashes beneath the 
                        ground?

                                        OENOMAUS
                      As her people s custom.

                                        GANNICUS
                        I did not know of them. There were 
                        many things I did not pause to ask 
                        her of.  Now I am filled with 
                        questions.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        None knew her as I did. We will 
                        speak of her, in quiet moments. And 
                        see them answered.

  Gannicus absorbs that, his conscience consuming him. Burning 
  for the release of confession.

                                        GANNICUS
                        Oenomaus, she --

  Oenomaus looks to him, his own pain and loss etched deep.  
  Gannicus veers in favor of a more comforting truth.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    5.

                        She was the rarest of women. A 
                        flower of beauty and compassion, in 
                        a world of shit. I would assume her 
                        place, so that her laugh may yet 
                        fill solemn air.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        She would not wish it. She loved 
                        you.

  Gannicus tenses.

                                          OENOMAUS(cont'd)
                      As a brother.

  Gannicus realizes Oenomaus is unaware of the betrayal. Which 
  only makes it worse.

                                        GANNICUS
                                  soft)(
                      As I loved her.

  OFF GANNICUS, his heart breaking...


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE/BALCONY - BATIATUS  4 LUDUS - SUNSET

  The darkening sky FLASHES, a storm brewing. The men have 
  gathered. Batiatus leads a procession as Titus  body is 
  carried out on the funerary couch by Oenomaus, Gannicus, 
  Barca, Rhaskos, and Crixus. All in full gladiator gear.

  LUCRETIA

  bears witness from the balcony, her face unreadable.  
  Standing with her are Solonius, NAEVIA, Magistrate Sextus, 
  and a few other Romans.

  TITUS  FUNERARY COUCH

  is placed on a pyre near the edge of the cliff. Ringing it 
  are pedestals displaying the images (im-mag-ees): busts and 
  funerary masks of illustrious ancestors. Gannicus and the 
  other bearers take their place among the men.

                                        BATIATUS
                         We stand upon sacred ground. 
                        Watered with tears of blood.  Words 
                        I often heard spoken in my youth. 
                      By my father.  By his father before 
                        him. Yet only now do I truly 
                        understand them.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    6.

  Batiatus solemnly takes in the assembled men.

                      We have all suffered the bitter 
                        sting of loss.

  ANGLE ON OENOMAUS: Feeling it most profoundly.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        And yet here we stand. We have felt 
                        the agony of heart ripped yet 
                        beating from sundered chest.

  ANGLE ON GANNICUS: Tears of regret welling in his eyes.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        And yet here we stand. The House of 
                        Batiatus is no stranger to 
                        misfortune. To the cruel whims of 
                        the gods, and base men that would 
                        position themselves as such. And 
                        yet. Here. We. Stand.

  Batiatus pauses, letting the power of that sink in.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        This house is built atop unshakable 
                        foundation of respect and honor. 
                        And in no one were such qualities 
                        more evident than Titus Lentulus 
                        Batiatus. A man I often challenged. 
                        A man I often...

  The word  hated  sticks in his throat. He recovers, 
  continues.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        You were the very life coursing 
                        through his veins. Even after his 
                        passing, his love for you and this 
                        ludus will live on.  Through 
                        actions of worthy son. I will laud 
                      my father s memory by seeing the 
                        House of Batiatus elevated beyond 
                        the imagining of my ancestors. I 
                        will need all of you to see it 
                        done. Men of hard purpose and 
                        desire.

  ASHUR tenses as he spots DAGAN emerging from the infirmary 
  to join the assembly. A blood-crusted cloth is tied around 
  his ruined eye. His good one burns a hole in Ashur.

                        Much has slipped from grasp in 
                        recent days. I would close 
                        trembling fingers into tight fist, 
                        and see no more follow in 
                        unfortunate wake. Let previous 
                        decision fall aside. None among you 
                        will be sent to the mines, 
                        regardless of standing!

  Rhaskos and the men react, overjoyed. Dagan glares at Ashur, 
  the implication of impending violence for taking his eye 
  clear.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        The sun has set on an era. Let us 
                        celebrate the name of Titus 
                        Lentulus Batiatus with drink and 
                        the clash of swords! Their sound to 
                        carry my father to the afterlife!

  Oenomaus CRACKS his whip. Three pairs of men move into 
  position: Gannicus and Barca; Rhaskos and Gnaeus; Crixus and 
  DURATIUS. Crixus whispers to Gannicus as a SLAVE hands them 
  their weapons. [NOTE: Real weapons, not practice ones.]

                                        CRIXUS
                        Will you fight your man to 
                        conclusion?  Or drop defense and 
                        allow hollow victory, as you did 
                        with me before Titus?

  Gannicus tightens, deadly anger flaring in his eyes.

                                        GANNICUS
                        You are champion now. Do not 
                        fucking broach subject again.

  Gannicus moves into position opposite Barca. Crixus  gaze 
  lingers in discontent before turning to Duratius across from 
  him. Oenomaus hands Batiatus a torch.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Let contest be ad vulna, to the 
                        wound.  Spill blood upon the sand, 
                        yet live to one day die with glory 
                        and honor in the arena!

  Batiatus lights the pyre.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Begin!


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    8.
  CONTINUED:

  The three pairs clash together. Batiatus drinks from an 
  AMPHORA OF WINE. Jugs are passed out to the men as they 
  shout encouragement to the combatants. SLOW PUSH IN ON 
  BATIATUS as he watches the fight, the fire illuminating a 
  face etched in stone as hard as that of his ancestors...


  INT. OFFICE CHAMBER - BATIATUS  VILLA - NIGHT

  The storm has arrived. Rain hammers down outside as we TRACK 
  ACROSS the open ledgers and scattered parchment littering 
  BATIATUS  DESK.

                                        BATIATUS (O.S.)
                        This is all that remains. When the 
                        smoke clears and the embers die. 
                        The sum total of a man s life.

  REVEAL Batiatus as he picks up a scroll.

                                        BATIATUS
                        This was my father s last act 
                        before his death.

  REVERSE to find Gannicus standing before him, dirty and 
  bruised from his bout with Crixus.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        A bill of sale, transferring your 
                        ownership. The cause that moved you 
                      to seek audience, on the day I 
                        watched my father burn?

                                        GANNICUS
                        Apologies, Dominus. I could wait no 
                        longer.

                                        BATIATUS
                      We again find ourselves in 
                        unpleasant position. To honor my 
                        father s wishes would see you fall 
                      to control of a man most hated. To 
                        defy it would see this house 
                        forever excluded from the arena. A 
                        cock in the ass, from either 
                        direction.
                                  re: scroll)(
                        Speak, and give fucking reason to 
                        see this join my father s ashes.

                        I have no words towards such an 
                        end. I come to see agreement 
                        honored.

  Batiatus weighs the surprise of that with a frown.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You wish to leave this house?

                                        GANNICUS
                        I wish for blood. See me given to 
                        Tullius  care, and I will have his 
                        life for your father s.

                                        BATIATUS
                        A noble offer. Yet I fear your life 
                        would be forfeit in such attempt.

                                        GANNICUS
                        A price willingly paid.

                                        BATIATUS
                      My father never aimed a favored 
                        word towards you. Now you entreat 
                      to be the instrument of his 
                        vengeance?
                                (a beat, dissecting 
                                  him)
                      Or is it another you seek it for?

  Guilt breaks the surface of Gannicus  anger. Batiatus spots 
  it.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        You would sacrifice your life, in 
                        the memory of hers?

                                        GANNICUS
                        A thousand lives, if I but had 
                        them.

  Batiatus unearths something else beneath the guilt and 
  anger.  An emotion he did not expect to find.

                                        BATIATUS
                      If you had such stirrings for 
                        Melitta, why did you not fight 
                        harder in the contest before my 
                        father? You could have taken 
                        Crixus, and remained here, close to 
                        your desires.

                        The same can be said of your plan 
                        against Tullius. He is forever 
                        surrounded not only by his own men, 
                        but by good citizens who would 
                        quickly aid such a  noble  Roman.

  INT. TRICLINIUM - BATIATUS  VILLA - NIGHT

  Naevia pours wine for Solonius and Lucretia.

                        Vettius  appearance was ill timed.

  Naevia exits.

                        The hand that grips his leash is of 
                        greater concern. Has Quintus voiced 
                        thought towards Tullius?

                                        LUCRETIA
                      He has not. Yet what would any of 
                      us do, to see the death of one so 
                        loved avenged?

  Her eyes cloud with sadness. Not over Titus, but in memory 
  of Gaia.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        The very heart of my concern. To 
                        take action against Tullius is to 
                        invite mortal consequence.

                        beneath my roof.

  Lucretia is taken aback by the sincerity of that. And the 
  glimmer of deeper desires lurking behind the offer. Solonius 
  quickly backpedals.

  Naevia hustles in with an amphora of wine. Batiatus grabs it

  Naevia scampers. Batiatus pours himself a tall drink.

                        Fuck resolution. The man desires 
                        only proximity to Tullius, and the 
                        villain's throat beneath his hands.

  Lucretia s eyes narrow hungrily at the news.

                        You speak of madness! Tullius is 
                        far too cautious to ever lower 
                        guard. Especially in the presence 
                      of a man loyal to the House of 
                        Batiatus.

                        were he in my fucking place?! Turn 
                        blind eye towards the murder of his

                        appropriate target. What if Tullius 
                        had no part in this?

                        But was it by Tullius  hand? Or 
                        another moved by equal grievance? 
                        What if Vettius is the true cause 
                      of this? The boy s hatred for you 
                      is well known.

  Lucretia relaxes. Solonius suspects nothing. Batiatus 
  glowers, concedes the point.

                        forever bowing and scraping in the 
                        shit of his betters. Is it any 
                        wonder no woman would have you?

  Solonius reels from that, deeply stung.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Emotion carries us past reason.  
                        Solonius has been as a brother.

  Batiatus regains his composure, embarrassed by the vehemence 
  of his outburst.

                                        BATIATUS
                      It has been a trying day, in a long 
                        succession of many. Apologies.  I 
                        have asked much of our friendship, 
                        with little reward. Yet I must seek 
                        more, to see injuries against this 
                        house redressed.

  Solonius considers that, nods. Clearly not happy with 
  Batiatus but willing to hear him out.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        What are your thoughts?

                                        BATIATUS
                        They yet stand clouded. Come. Let 
                      us put minds together, and see them 
                        cleared.

  Solonius reluctantly moves off with Batiatus. Lucretia 
  watches them go, her plan to rid herself of Titus and propel 
  Batiatus to take action against Tullius finally bearing 
  deadly fruit. OFF the bloom of a satisfied smile...

  painfully tattoos her with the familiar BUTTERFLY MARK from

                        honor.

  WIDEN TO REVEAL Lucretia. House Mother roughly taps a thin, 
  sharpened stick dipped in ink with a small mallet. Naevia 
  flinches as it bites into her skin.

                        slave. And shall be missed beyond 
                        the measure of words.

  Lucretia s eyes fill with genuine regret over the death of 
  Melitta -- and her inadvertent part in it.

  Naevia tenses. Lucretia mistakes the reason.

  House Mother nods to Lucretia, finished. Lucretia smiles 
  warmly, stroking a stray lock of hair from Naevia s face.

  Batiatus moves off to attend to his beard and robes. A dark 
  smile bends Lucretia s lips. Her plan to maneuver action 
  against Tullius has worked. Gaia s murder will be avenged.  
  OFF the triumph...


  INT. GANNICUS' CELL - BATIATUS  LUDUS - NIGHT

  Gannicus sits in his subligaria, drinking from a jug of 
  funeral wine. Lost in dark thoughts. Oenomaus enters, wet 
  from the storm. Gannicus laughs mirthlessly.

  The words hang heavy in the air between them. Gannicus

  Pain wells in Gannicus  eyes. He forces it aside in favor of 
  mounting anger. At Tullius. The Fates. But mostly himself.

                        This is how it must be.

                                        OENOMAUS
                                  flaring)(
                        She would not have wanted this. 
                        When I meet her in the afterlife, I 
                      do not wish to explain why I let a 
                        man we both loved forfeit his life.
                                  a whisper)(
                        I have lost my wife. I would not 
                        see my brother follow.

  That hits Gannicus hard. Tears stain his cheeks.

                                        GANNICUS
                      He deserves no less.

  Oenomaus looks at him questioningly, not understanding.  
  Gannicus can contain his guilt no longer.

                                          GANNICUS(cont'd)

                                        BATIATUS (O.S.)
                        The time for words has passed.

  They turn to find Batiatus in the doorway. Clean shaven.  
  Wearing proper robes and a hooded cloak. An ORNATE CLOTH BAG 
  a bit larger than a coin purse in hand, containing his 
  father s ashes. Oenomaus starts to protest Gannicus  sale.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    19.

                        Prepare the wagon. We leave at 
                        once.

  Oenomaus sees there is no convincing him or Gannicus. He 
  nods, exits. Batiatus turns on Gannicus, hissing to him.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        What words were you about to 
                        fucking speak?

                        Ones weighted with truth.

                        Towards what purpose?

                                        GANNICUS
                      He deserves to know.

                                        BATIATUS
                        This is not about him. It is about 
                        Gannicus and his fucking 
                        conscience. Speak it, and see 
                        memory of beloved wife forever 
                        tainted.

                        I cannot keep what I have done 
                        buried.

                        Then see it remain in shallow grave 
                        but a while longer.

                        How am I to unearth it, once I have 
                        been sold to Tullius?

                                        BATIATUS
                        I do not sell you to Tullius.

  Gannicus registers surprise.

                        Yet the man shall fall. By my hands 
                        alone.

  INT. NESTOR'S MEAT SHOP - NIGHT

  TULLIUS overturns his small meeting table, furious.

                                          TULLIUS
                        Batiatus again spits in my face?

  REVEAL the traitorous Solonius nervously standing before 
  him, having just delivered the news. Vettius snorts next to 
  him.

                                          VETTIUS
                        News absent surprise. A snake by 
                        nature favors maneuvering upon its 
                        belly.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        I would stand upright. Among 
                        honorable men.

  Tullius bores a hole through him. Solonius moistens dry 
  lips, his heart in his throat. This could end very badly if 
  he isn t careful.

                                          TULLIUS
                        Where does he take Gannicus?

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Batiatus sent me to secure sale to 
                        the Syrian trader Galeagra. By 
                        morning Gannicus will be on a ship 
                        sailing towards points unknown. 
                        Forever beyond your reach.

                                          TULLIUS
                        You aided Batiatus in this?

                                        SOLONIUS
                        I have known the man for many 
                        years. I was... conflicted.

                                          TULLIUS
                      As I am now.

  He picks up a carving knife.

                                          TULLIUS(cont'd)
                      On whether to strip flesh from your 
                        fucking face.

  He nods to his bodyguard THERON. The brute grabs Solonius, 
  his meaty arm constricting around his throat.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    21.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Wait! I came to you with this!

                                          VETTIUS
                        After the fact.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        There is still time! He meets the 
                        Syrian at the edge of the city!

  Tullius considers that for a long beat. Solonius struggles 
  vainly, gasping for breath.

                                          TULLIUS
                                to Theron)(
                        Gather the men.

  Theron releases his grip, exiting. Solonius sucks air.

                                          VETTIUS
                        I cannot believe even Batiatus so 
                        thick, to imagine concealing such 
                      an act.

                                        SOLONIUS
                      He will spin story... of Gannicus 
                        escaping. To perhaps follow his 
                        slave Diona, who recently went to 
                        foot.

                                          TULLIUS
                      He thinks me the fool, to accept 
                        the tale?

                                        SOLONIUS
                      He is counting on you not to. 
                        Batiatus knows you will summon him 
                      to meeting. To  discuss  the 
                        matter. He lays plans to see much 
                        coin in your men s hands.  Payment 
                      in aid against your life when he 
                        stands before you.

  Vettius laughs in disbelief.

                                          VETTIUS
                        The fucking cock on him.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Batiatus has always thought himself 
                        above those around him. Even 
                        closest friend.

                        see fucking son join his father.

  OFF TULLIUS, murder flashing in his eyes...


  EXT. CAPUA - STREET - NIGHT

  Batiatus cautiously moves down the street, deserted due to 
  the rain. The hood of his cloak raised to better 
    concealment.

  Oenomaus and Barca, also cloaked, follow with Gannicus.  
  Gannicus  hands are bound in chain. Batiatus pauses, peering 
  into the gloom.

                                        BATIATUS
                                  harsh whisper)(

                        I will search ahead.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Stay where you are. I would not 
                        have you from my side.

                                        GANNICUS
                      If you had sold me to Tullius, only 
                      my life would be at risk.

                                        BATIATUS
                        With great risk comes greater 
                        reward.  And I shall have mine.

                                        OENOMAUS
                                  spotting something)(
                        The Syrian arrives.

  Batiatus turns to see two CLOAKED FIGURES emerge from the 
  shadows at the far end of the street. Batiatus sags in 
  relief. It is short lived.

                                          TULLIUS (O.S.)
                        I have grown weary of these games, 
                        Batiatus.

  Batiatus whirls. Tullius and Vettius appear with Theron and 
  half a dozen well-armed THUGS. Solonius lurks nervously in 
  their wake. Batiatus tenses.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    23.

                        And would see them to bitter end.

  Batiatus eyes Tullius  men -- and grins.

                                        BATIATUS
                      As would I.

  Rhaskos, Duratius, AMBIORIX, and half a dozen of Batiatus  
  armed Gladiators materialize from the darkness (NOTE: Crixus 
  and Dagan are not among them). The Syrian and his companion 
  throw back their hoods, revealing Ashur and Gnaeus. Tullius  
  face drops.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Come. Let us embrace, you fucking 
                        cunt.

  All hell breaks loose as Batiatus  Gladiators attack.  
  Gannicus fends off an attack with his chain, whipping it to 
  smash the teeth out of a Thug.

  OENOMAUS

  goes for Tullius. A Thug intercepts him. Oenomaus snarls, 
  rage exploding as he brutally lays into the Thug.

  WEAPONS CLASH

  in the night. Blood flows. One of Batiatus  men is struck 
  down, landing at Solonius  feet. Solonius gawks at the 
  carnage, paralyzed by blind fear.

  VETTIUS

  grabs up the sword of Batiatus  fallen man and desperately 
  attempts to aid Tullius -- only to be clocked by Gannicus  
  chain. Vettius goes down hard, unconscious.

  ASHUR

  splits a Thug open, laughing as the man s blood splashes the 
  ground. Gnaeus hacks a Thug s arm off nearby.

  TULLIUS

  kicks Rhaskos back, tries to make a break for it.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Stop him!

  Gannicus tries to get to him, his eyes wild with bloodlust 
  as he smashes Thugs out of the way with his chain.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    24.

  THERON

  appears behind Batiatus, sword raised for the death blow.

                                        BARCA
                        Dominus!

  Batiatus whirls just as Barca slams into Theron. The two 
  exchange blows, but Barca is stabbed in the side. He grunts 
  in surprise as Theron moves in for the kill. Theron suddenly 
  stiffens, reaching in shock to feel the back of his head.

  THERON CRUMBLES,

  revealing a DAGGER sticking out of the back of his skull, 
  courtesy of Batiatus. Batiatus goes nuts, kicking at the 
  dead man s body.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Fuck your cock! You fucking shit! 
                        Fuck!

  Tullius runs a man through. He raises his sword to strike 
  Oenomaus, who is distracted trading blows with a Thug.  
  Gannicus whips his chain around Tullius  neck, yanking him 
  back.

  TULLIUS GASPS,

  his sword falling as the chain bites into his flesh.  
  Gannicus tightens it with all his strength, his eyes wild 
  with the thirst for revenge.

  OENOMAUS

  spots the struggle. He finishes off his man and rears his 
  sword back with a snarl to kill Tullius.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Hold!

  Oenomaus whips his head around to find Batiatus approaching, 
  out of breath and splattered with blood. The fight is over.  
  Vettius lays unconscious. Barca wounded. Tullius  men dead 
  or nearly so.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Such a death... would be far too 
                        quick.

  Gannicus looks to Oenomaus. Willing to disobey if Oenomaus 
  chooses it. Oenomaus barely controls his rage, lowering his

  Gannicus and Oenomaus move to comply. Batiatus levels his 
  gaze at Solonius, still frozen in place.

  Batiatus breaks into a shit-eating grin.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        You fucking played this to 
                        perfection!

  Solonius bows with a humble smile. Ratting Batiatus out was 
  all part of the plan.

                                        SOLONIUS
                      It was not difficult. When passion 
                        for vengeance overtakes caution, 
                        even the keenest mind is easily 
                        deceived.

  Batiatus nods, turning to Tullius who has been bound and 
  gagged.

  INT. NESTOR'S MEAT SHOP - NIGHT

  TIGHT ON VETTIUS  FACE as he slowly comes to -- and realizes 
  he s hanging by bound hands from one of Nestor s meat hooks.  
  Solonius, flanked by a Bodyguard, smiles down at him.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        The lamb finally wakes.

  Vettius struggles, tries to scream for help through his gag.

                                          SOLONIUS(cont'd)
                        Calm yourself. I merely wish to 
                        break words. Seek to raise alarm, 
                        and find throat slit well in 
                        advance of aid. We are clear?

  Vettius nods, his eyes wild with fear. Solonius removes the 
  gag. Vettius sputters.

                                          VETTIUS
                        You are fucking dead.

  Solonius laughs, pours himself a cup of wine.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Threats absent form, without 
                        Tullius to support them.

                        Me? I have done nothing. In all of 
                        this, I have never known quarrel 
                        with good Tullius. Yet Batiatus... 
                      he is of a contrary nature. And 
                        moves even as we speak to end his 
                        conflict with your man.  Forever.

  Vettius glares in disbelief.

                                          VETTIUS
                        The opening of the arena is upon 
                        us.  Tullius  absence will be 
                        noted. And your part in it quick 
                        upon heel.

                        You are mistaken. No one will 
                        suspect Tullius has left this 
                        world. Not when trusted Vettius 
                        heralds news that he has 
                        unexpectedly set sail abroad. To 
                        attend pressing concerns in 
                        Antioch.

  Vettius eyes him in surprise.

                                          VETTIUS
                        What would move tongue to voice 
                        such fucking lie? It more easily 
                        forms words to see you and Batiatus 
                        executed for your crimes.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Based upon what evidence? We were 
                        not discovered knife in hand, 
                        kneeling beside body. A body that 
                        even now Batiatus conceals beyond 
                        reach of human eyes. No, my concern 
                        rests with your safety.  Attempt to 
                        raise unwarranted suspicion, and 
                        Batiatus would be sure to take 
                        offense. And without Tullius to 
                        protect you...

  Vettius wrestles with that, sees the truth in it. Solonius 
  catches the shift in his eyes, smiles in satisfaction.

                                          SOLONIUS(cont'd)
                        Ah. Youth finally matures. Now that 
                      we have settled issue, let us turn 
                      to other matters. Of a more 
                        personal nature...

  A faint smile tugs at Lucretia s lips as she moves closer.

                        I did not think I pleased you. When 
                        last called to your chambers.

  Lucretia hesitates, a great sadness welling in her eyes.

  INT. HOLDING CELL - ARENA - NIGHT

  The cell that Spartacus was held in at the beginning of 
  episode 101. Tullius is roughly deposited at Batiatus  feet 
  by Oenomaus and Gannicus. Duratius and Ambiorix stand off to 
  the side, near stone and mortar of a half finished wall.

                        Alone at last...

  Batiatus produces a dagger. He descends on Tullius -- and 
  cuts his gag free. Tullius immediately screams for aid, his 
  voice hoarse from Gannicus  chain.

                                          TULLIUS

                        young Vettius, moving him towards 
                        offering proper excuse for your 
                          disappearance.

                                          TULLIUS
                        Vettius?

                                        BATIATUS
                        The boy will carry news of urgent 
                        business calling you to Antioch. A 
                        treacherous journey. One that 
                        better men than you have often 
                        vanished from, never to be heard 
                        after. The city will mourn.  Soon 
                        your name will be spoken of less 
                        and less. Until it is lost to 
                        history.

  A tense beat. Broken by Tullius  mirthless laugh.

                                          TULLIUS
                        I should have had your life at the 
                        beginning of this. The mistake is 
                        mine, for staying hand in respect 
                      of your father.

  Batiatus tightens.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Respect? Then pay it to the remains 
                      of the man himself!

  Batiatus produces the ornate bag holding his father s ashes.  
  He reaches in and scoops out a handful, screaming at Tullius 
  as he forces them into his mouth.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Tell him how high you fucking hold 
                        him!  Even as your poisoned wine 
                        robs him of fucking life! Tell him! 
                        Tell him, you fucking shit!

  Tullius chokes and sputters. Locks eyes with Batiatus.

                                          TULLIUS
                        I am guilty of many things. The 
                        death of your father does not stand 
                        among them.

                        faced with eternal silence.

                                          TULLIUS
                        Why would I strike against your 
                        father?  He was an honorable Roman.

  Batiatus  eyes go cold.

                      As I know yours.

  Tullius laughs, accepting his fate.

                                          TULLIUS
                        There will be an accounting, 
                        Batiatus.  For this and all that 
                        follows. The gods will see to it 
                        some day.

                                        BATIATUS
                        But not this one.

  Batiatus whips his dagger out and stabs Tullius. Gannicus 
  and Oenomaus join in, stabbing him with their own weapons.  
  Tullius screams. Blood flows.


  INT. BEDCHAMBERS - BATIATUS  VILLA - NIGHT

  Crixus makes love to Lucretia. Passions build. Lucretia 
  roughly grabs hold of him, silently urging him to thrust 
  harder.

  LUCRETIA CLIMAXES,

  a smile bending her lips. Of satisfaction. Of knowing that 
  at this very moment Tullius is meeting his end...


  INT. HOLDING CELL - ARENA - NIGHT

  Tullius collapses. Gurgles. Barely alive.

                                        BATIATUS
                                  winded)(

  CONTINUED:

  He motions for Duratius and Ambiorix. They roughly shove 
  Tullius into the unfinished wall. Tullius tries to scream.

  A wet, ugly sound. Batiatus basks in the grim victory as 
  they mortar Tullius into the wall.

  PRE-LAP: THE ROAR OF THE CROWD fades in as we RISE UPWARD 
  THROUGH THE CEILING, TRANSITIONING US TO --


  EXT. ARENA - DAY

  The arena we are used to seeing from season one. The crowd 
  cheers as HORSEMEN parade around the sand. MEN follow 
  carrying the carcass of a SLAUGHTERED BULL split in half.

  PULVINUS

  Magistrate Sextus, VARUS, COSSUTIUS, and other Romans drink 
  and laugh. Batiatus stands with Lucretia (red wig). Naevia 
  attends. Batiatus takes in the arena, his heart swelling at 
  finally achieving a seat in the pulvinus.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Have eyes ever beheld such a sight?

                                          MAGISTRATE SEXTUS
                        The laurel crown of the Republic.

                                        VARUS
                        Its majesty even more evident when 
                        viewed from the pulvinus.

  Varus allows Batiatus and Lucretia a measured smile.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      An honor, to be invited by Tullius.

                                        BATIATUS
                        One I fear undeserved. Yet he is a 
                        difficult man to turn from.

                                          COSSUTIUS
                        A fact well known to all present.

                                          MAGISTRATE SEXTUS
                        I am surprised by his delay. The 
                        opening of the arena has been the 
                        only subject on his tongue. Now he 
                        stands late to his own celebration.

  Vettius enters with Solonius in tow.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    34.

                        Apologies. Tullius regrets he will 
                      be absent altogether.

  The pulvinus erupts in stunned murmurs. Batiatus interjects, 
   concern  tinging his words.

                                        BATIATUS
                        What could wrest him from so high a 
                        perch?

  Vettius swallows his hatred for Batiatus with a smile.

                        Pressing concerns abroad in 
                        Antioch. His departure was... 
                        unexpected.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        The arena would not exist without 
                        Tullius. We would not be standing 
                        here, were it not for his actions.

  Lucretia allows herself the hint of a smile.

                                        BATIATUS
                      We must halt the ceremonies until 
                        his return.

                        Agreed. I shall address the crowd 
                        ---

                                          VETTIUS
                        Tullius sends hard instruction for 
                        ceremony to carry without him. This 
                        arena was a gift to his beloved 
                        city. He does not wish misfortune 
                      to stand in the way of the giving 
                      of it.

  Sextus considers the request with a troubled frown. Batiatus 
  tensely glances at Solonius. The moment of truth.

                                          MAGISTRATE SEXTUS
                        A most gracious offer, well 
                        received.  Come. Haunt Tullius  
                        place by my side, possessing his 
                        spirit for the occasion.

                        Again I must offer apology. I make 
                        preparation to follow Tullius to

                        more befitting a man of breeding.

  Batiatus frowns at the slight. Vettius takes satisfaction in 
  the minor victory.

                                        VARUS
                        All flee to dark corners!

                        I would not see your brief years of

                        I can make fair offer to divide 
                        them.

  He shoots Solonius a look. Solonius returns it with a deadly 
  smile.

                        future games.  Tullius and I would

  Batiatus sees suspicion flare in Varus  eyes. Quickly moves 
  to extinguish it.

                        Vettius has always been little more

                      he rushes to heel when leash is 
                        jerked?

                        mind, and turn towards the glories 
                      of the day.

  Magistrate Sextus raises his cup. Batiatus follows suit with 
  a smile, barely hiding the sting of Solonius  betrayal...


  INT. STAIRS TO THE PULVINUS - ARENA - DAY

  Vettius comes down the stairs, flush with humiliation.  
  Solonius follows in a cloud of smug satisfaction.

                        Avoid them forming a noose, and 
                        never return to Capua while I draw 
                        breath.

                        I shall pray for the day it ceases.

  Vettius exits. Solonius turns to head back up. Batiatus 
  intercepts, furious.

                                        BATIATUS
                                  harsh whisper)(
                      We were supposed to divide Vettius  
                        men among us. What the fuck are you 
                        doing?

                                        SOLONIUS
                        What it takes to make a name in 
                        this world. After years of  bowing 
                        and scraping in shit .

                                        BATIATUS
                      Is that what this is about? A few 
                        words spoken in anger absent 
                        thought?

                                        SOLONIUS
                        A few words? You name me friend and 
                        brother, yet at every turn remind 
                        that I lack this trait or that. You 
                        take information given to aid and 
                        move against Tullius, absent regard 
                      of the difficult position it places 
                        me.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You talk of nothing.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Every tongue that is not your own 
                      is accused of the same. It has 
                        taken years and the price of blood, 
                        but I at last see you for what you 
                        are. A man that holds no one in 
                        esteem beyond himself.

  Batiatus is stunned by the vehemence of Solonius  assault.

                                          SOLONIUS(cont'd)

                        closest to me.

  Solonius sweeps back up to the pulvinus. OFF BATIATUS, left 
  to wrestle with the truth of Solonius  words...


  EXT. ARENA - DAY

  The CROWD loudly BOOS and throws garbage at an unseen 
  offense. Batiatus returns to the pulvinus, a tight smile 
  hiding his roiling emotions towards Solonius.

                                        LUCRETIA
                                  whispered)(
                        What fucking excuse does Solonius 
                        give?

  Batiatus shoots a withering look at Solonius, who sits at 
  the Magistrate s side in Tullius  honored seat.

                                        BATIATUS
                        None that merit consideration.

  He shifts his attention to the crowd, wishing to change 
  subject.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        What has the crowd in such a state?

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Sextus announces executions before 
                        the games begin.

  Batiatus glances down to the arena where half naked 
  PRISONERS in chains are dragged out and forced to kneel. 
  Cossutius  eyes narrow, spotting a familiar face.

                                          COSSUTIUS
                      Is that not one of yours, Batiatus? 
                        The girl on the end, what was her 
                        name...

  Naevia constricts, heart sinking as she spots her.

                                        NAEVIA
                        Diona.

  DIONA, dirty and bruised, looks to the pulvinus, her eyes 
  wild with fear. Cossutius laughs, recalling her now.

                                          COSSUTIUS
                        Diona, yes.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    39.

                                          MAGISTRATE SEXTUS
                        Apologies, Batiatus. The girl was 
                        only rounded up this morning. If 
                        you wish her removed to be dealt 
                        with personally...

  Naevia tenses, hope surging. Only to be dashed as Batiatus 
  waves the offer away.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Let her death stand as warning. To 
                        all others who would seek to betray 
                        me.

  He levels a veiled smile at Solonius. Naevia looks down at 
  Diona. Tears well in each of their eyes as CABURUS, a big 
  ugly gladiator from Vettius  stable, approaches with sword 
  in hand. He looks up to the pulvinus for the signal.

                                          MAGISTRATE SEXTUS
                        Caburus is your man now, Solonius. 
                        Rise, and see him to purpose.

                                        SOLONIUS
                      As you wish.

  He rises, basking in the moment as he gives the signal to 
  Caburus to begin. The crowd ROARS in approval. Batiatus 
  darkens. Naevia s heart seizes as Caburus rams his sword 
  through the back of Diona s throat and out her neck.


  INT. CHUTES - ARENA - DAY

  Crixus (now shaven with short hair), Ashur, Gnaeus, and a 
  knot of Gladiators watch Diona s execution from the gates.

                                        ASHUR
                        A pity, to lose one so fetching.

  Dagan grunts, his bad eye still shielded by a bloodied 
  cloth.

                                        DAGAN
                        Soon you join. Cunt.

  Ashur chews on the statement with obvious concern. He moves 
  off to finish gearing up, passing Barca and Oenomaus.  
  Barca s wounded side has been bandaged.

                                        BARCA
                        I can fight, Doctore. Have word 
                        with dominus --

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    40.
  CONTINUED:

  Oenomaus responds by pressing the butt of his whip into 
  Barca s bandaged side (from his injury in the attack on 
  Tullius). Barca grunts in pain as blood seeps.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        I already have. Aid your brothers 
                      in preparing for the day. You will 
                        fight again when you are able.

                                        BARCA
                        Yes, Doctore.

  Barca moves off in disappointment, favoring his wound.  
  Oenomaus  eyes fall on Gannicus. He sits alone in quiet 
  reflection, ignoring the world around him.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        You will face Tasgetius and 
                        Synetos. In the match before the 
                        primus.

  Gannicus nods, numb. With Tullius gone, the fire of revenge 
  has followed. All that is left is pain and regret.

                                          OENOMAUS(cont'd)
                        Our days have been filled with 
                        anguish and wounded heart. Yet now 
                        thoughts must turn upon the games. 
                        Show all of Capua why you are 
                        considered such a prize.  Show them 
                        why so many died to possess you. 
                        Fight. And honor the House of 
                        Batiatus.

  Gannicus smiles sadly.

                                        GANNICUS
                        There are many things I would die 
                        for.  Many I deserve to die for. 
                        This house is no longer among them.

  Oenomaus absorbs that for a long beat.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Then fight for her. Every life you 
                        take.  The blood you will shed. She 
                        will see it from the afterlife.

  A beat. Gannicus rises, the fire returning.

                                        GANNICUS
                        Then I shall fill her eyes.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    41.

  OFF GANNICUS, burning with deadly purpose...


  EXT. ARENA - DAY

  The crowd ROARS. Naevia watches as Diona s corpse is dragged 
  off with the rest of the executed prisoners by LIBITINARII.

                        more is demanded on such a day. And

                        given! The victors all to face each 
                      in the primus!

  The crowd goes insane. Lucretia sears Solonius with a 
  withering look.

                        A lesson to be remembered.

  He tries not to let her see the worry behind his bravado.

                                          MAGISTRATE SEXTUS
                      It shall be a spectacle the likes

                        never witnessed!  Glory to Capua! 
                        Glory to Rome!

  The ROAR of the crowd propels us into a glorious MONTAGE OF 
  BLOOD AND DEATH:

  - Gnaeus entangles a Gladiator in his net and spears him 
  with his trident.

  - A bloodied Ashur hacks open his opponent s throat.

  - One of Batiatus  GLADIATORS goes down in a spray of blood.  
  Batiatus glowers in the pulvinus.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    42.
  CONTINUED:

  - Dagan brutally hacks apart a Gladiator, then points his 
  bloody sword at Ashur in the chutes. You re next, fucker.

  - Crixus narrowly wins a vicious match.

  - Solonius  new acquisition Caburus decimates two of 
  Batiatus  men.

  - Gannicus returns the favor, slaughtering Tasgetius and 
  Synetos in a frenzy of blood. He raises his gore-drenched 
  swords to the pulvinus, framed in gold by the setting sun.

  The MONTAGE ends as Batiatus surges to his feet.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Once more Gannicus proves himself a 
                        god of the arena! Were that Tullius 
                        present to witness such triumph!

                                        VARUS
                        Yet I fear the numbers stand 
                        against you in the primus. Solonius 
                        holds twice your men.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Numbers are meaningless. A lesson 
                        good Solonius is about to discover.

  Varus and the Romans laugh, delighted. Solonius glowers at 
  Batiatus. OFF BATIATUS  challenging grin...


  INT. CHUTES - ARENA - NIGHT

  Torches are lit. Gannicus and the other battered men rest 
  before the primus. Crixus sits next to Gannicus, offering 
  him water. Gannicus takes it, sips, hands it back. A beat.

                                        CRIXUS
                        So. We at last meet upon the sands.

                                        GANNICUS
                        Two among many.

                                        CRIXUS
                        I do not give concern towards the 
                        other men. There is only one I 
                        would prove myself against in 
                        proper contest.

  Gannicus eyes him with a frown. This guy just never stops.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    43.

                      We face Solonius  men, not each 
                        other.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Only until they fall. Then we shall 
                        stand alone, absent thought of 
                        brotherhood. The true title of 
                        champion in the balance.

  Caburus snorts in contempt, passing with a few of Solonius  
  Gladiators.

                                          CABURUS
                        One you fucking cunts will never 
                        hold.

  Crixus surges to his feet, ready to fight. Gannicus holds 
  him back.

                                to Crixus)(

                                to Caburus)(
                      In the arena.

  Caburus laughs, moving off with his men. Batiatus glares at 
  them as he enters with Oenomaus, interrupting.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Attend. Your Dominus would have 
                        words.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Everything we have dreamed of. 
                        Suffered and died for.
                        The worth of it all turns upon this 
                        single moment. You face the House 
                      of Solonius, and his ill gotten 
                        men. You stand outnumbered. But not 
                        outmatched.  Only one man will 
                        claim victory this day and earn the 
                        title Champion of Capua.  And by 
                        the gods that man will fucking be 
                        from the House of Batiatus!

  The men CHEER. Batiatus locks eyes with Gannicus. His 
  champion. His best hope. Gannicus burns with bloody purpose. 
  He will honor the memory of Melitta with an offering of 
  blood -- and a glorious death, if the gods so will it. The 
  CHEERS drowned out by the ROAR OF THE CROWD as we TRANSITION 
  TO --                                                                                    44.


  EXT. ARENA - NIGHT

  The victors from the day s matches take to the sands. From 
  the House of Batiatus: Gannicus, Crixus, Gnaeus, Ashur, 
  Dagan, Duratius, and Ambiorix. From the House of Solonius: 
  Caburus and twelve others. A total of twenty men.

  MAGISTRATE SEXTUS

  steps to the pulvinus railing. The crowd quiets.

                                          MAGISTRATE SEXTUS
                        Many have fought this day. Many 
                        have died, their blood staining the 
                        sands.  Yet this arena towers above 
                        all others in the republic. It is a 
                        vast beast. And it yet hungers!

  The crowd ROARS.

                                          MAGISTRATE SEXTUS(cont'd)
                        Two great houses face each other. 
                        Yet every man must ultimately stand 
                        for himself and himself alone.

  Sextus gives a signal. CALONES (arena attendants) rush in 
  with huge jugs of oil, pouring it in a gigantic ring around 
  the Gladiators. The crowd MURMURS. The Gladiators shift 
  nervously. All except Gannicus, who keeps steely focus on 
  the pulvinus.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        What are they doing?

  Batiatus notes Gannicus  hard purpose, waves the question 
  away.

                                        BATIATUS
                      It does not matter.

                        Fire burns within their breasts. 
                        And it is fire that shall bind them 
                      in final contest!

  A Calone sets a torch to the oil. It ignites around the 
  Gladiators with an impressive WHOOSH. The crowd ERUPTS.

                                          MAGISTRATE SEXTUS(cont'd)

                        from the primus.  Fall within them,

                        Take position!

  The two houses move to opposing sides within the ring of 
  fire. Ashur eyes the overwhelming force, whispers to Dagan.

                                        ASHUR
                                in Aramaic)(

                        [Perhaps it is wise to place 
                        grievance aside, and fight once 
                        more as brothers.  At least until 
                        our enemies have fallen.]

  Dagan chuckles in response. Ashur tightens, knowing he s in 
  deep shit. Crixus glances at Gannicus, his hand tightening 
  on his sword.

                                        CRIXUS
                      Do not die before we meet.

  Gannicus ignores him, his eyes fixed on Caburus. The brute 
  grins, lusting for blood.

                                          MAGISTRATE SEXTUS
                        Split heaven with the sound of your 
                        fury!  Begin!

  The crowd ROARS as the two houses rush each other. Except 
  Dagan, who immediately whirls on Ashur with his sword. Ashur 
  barely deflects with his shield, the blow staggering him.

                                        SOLONIUS
                                  laughs)(
                        Batiatus  men think so little of 
                        his house, they seek to kill each 
                        other from the start.

  The Romans CHUCKLE. Batiatus seethes. Ashur manages to 
  scamper out of reach. Dagan is intercepted by a Gladiator 
  (S1) and is forced to engage him.

  GANNICUS

  flips an attacking gladiator (S2) out of his way and slams 
  into Caburus. Thunderous blows are traded. Caburus catches 
  Gannicus in the face with his shield, smashing him back.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    46.

  AMBIORIX

  rushes in, hacking at Caburus. Caburus counters, splitting 
  Ambiorex s head open in a SPRAY OF GORE. The Crowd CHEERS.  
  Varus laughs in delight.

                                        VARUS
                        First blood to Solonius!

  The Romans applaud. Solonius hits Batiatus with a smile.  
  Batiatus returns it tightly.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      He seizes blessing and position

                        Pray he does not also seize title 
                      of Champion. It is leverage we must 
                        hold to regain favor.

  The crowd CHEERS as Gannicus severs a man s arm (S3), 
  spinning to send his head following. Crixus slices open a 
  man (S4) -- and finds himself facing Gannicus.

  CRIXUS ATTACKS,

  his sword flashing. Gannicus deflects, cracking him with his 
  hilt. Crixus stumbles, his face nearly going into the 
  flames.  He scampers back, but Gannicus has already moved on 
  to aid

  GNAEUS,

  against two Gladiators (S5, S6). Gnaeus sweeps S5 off his 
  feet with his net and spears him with his trident. Gannicus 
  cuts down S6, twin swords arcing blood.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Yes! It is a pity you did not land 
                        more men in the primus, Solonius. I 
                        fear you to be eliminated 
                        prematurely.

  Solonius  turn to fume.

  ASHUR

  narrowly avoids an assault, stabbing the m an (S2) in the 
  groin and ripping him open to his chin. Dagan attacks.

  Ashur is driven back to the edge of the flames. Desperate, 
  he kicks up

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    47.
  CONTINUED:

  A SPRAY OF SAND

  with his sword, blinding Dagan s good eye. Dagan grunts in 
  surprise as Ashur runs him through to the hilt. Ashur grins 
  up at the dying man.

                                        ASHUR
                        Who now stands the cunt?

  Dagan spits blood in Ashur s face -- and grabs the sword in 
  his gut as he falls dead, depriving Ashur of his weapon. 
  Ashur frantically dodges Solonius  remaining men as he 
  scrambles for a replacement from one of the fallen 
  Gladiators.

  GNAEUS

  entangles a Gladiator (S7) in his net, yanking the man from 
  his feet. The man tumbles into the fire, screaming as his 
  flesh is set ablaze. The fire also ignites Gnaeus  net.

  CABURUS CHARGES,

  striking Duratius down as he rushes Gnaeus. Gnaeus throws 
  his flaming net. Caburus dives under it, slamming into 
  Gnaeus as he rolls to his feet. Gnaeus sails beyond the 
  flames. He lands hard, spitting blood. Out of the match.

  BATIATUS TIGHTENS,

  calculating the remaining odds. Only Gannicus, Crixus, and 
  Ashur remain against Caburus and Solonius  men.

  CRIXUS

  finds just the right angle to cleave a Hoplomachus  head 
  from his shoulders (S8). Ashur screams to him as he dodges a 
  Gladiator (S9) intent on ending him.

                                          ASHUR(cont'd)
                        A weapon! Give me a fucking weapon!

  Crixus kicks the Hoplomachus  spear up in the air. Ashur 
  snatches it and just manages to kill S9.

  GANNICUS

  trades blows with Caburus. One of Solonius  men (S10) joins 
  the assault, quickly gets hacked open by Gannicus. Caburus 
  seizes the distraction and slices open Gannicus  arm, 
  causing him to lose one of his swords.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    48.
  CONTINUED:

  CRIXUS AND ASHUR

  battle the last of Solonius  men (S11, S12). Together they 
  manage to kill them, mostly due to Crixus  prowess. Ashur 
  turns attention to Gannicus across the sands, his back 
  towards them as he fights Caburus. Ashur grins.

                                          ASHUR(cont'd)
                        Let us press advantage, brother! 
                        Then decide who is champion between 
                        us!

  Ashur rears back to hurl his spear at Gannicus.

                                        CRIXUS
                        No!

  Crixus knocks the spear up, attacking Ashur. Varus laughs in 
  disbelief up in the pulvinus.

                                        VARUS
                                to Batiatus)(

                      To be expected, when animals are 
                        not properly trained.

  Batiatus glares. Ashur screams at Crixus far below.

                                        ASHUR
                        What are you doing, you mad fuck?!

  Ashur stabs with his spear. Crixus blocks the attack, 
  spinning low to HACK OPEN ASHUR S RIGHT SHIN. Ashur screams.  
  Crixus surges up, smashing him in the face with his shield.

  ASHUR SAILS BACK,

  landing in the flames. He shrieks, rolling out of the ring 
  of fire -- and out of the match. He grunts in agony, barely 
  conscious. His left shoulder hideously burned. Right shin 
  mangled, the shattered BONE protruding.

  GANNICUS

  is getting hammered by Caburus. Crixus rushes in, aiding 
  Gannicus. Batiatus allows himself a relieved smile.

                                        LUCRETIA

  Batiatus brightens. Solonius forces a strained smile.

  GANNICUS AND CRIXUS

  hammer Caburus. Caburus counters, kicking Gannicus back and 
  slicing open Crixus. Crixus reels. Caburus raises his sword 
  for the death blow.

  GANNICUS

  makes a quick decision and HURLS HIMSELF AT Caburus and 
  Crixus. Caburus staggers. Crixus gets slammed back through 
  the flames, landing on the other side. Crixus slams his fist 
  into the sand in frustration, disqualified.

                                        SOLONIUS

                        The odds return to balance.

  CABURUS

  attacks the bloodied and exhausted Gannicus. Gannicus barely 
  fends him off. Caburus presses. Gannicus is hammered to his 
  knees, his remaining sword stripped from him in the process.  
  Caburus roars to the crowd. They respond in kind.

  THE CONCUSSIVE DIN

  reaches Gannicus in distorted waves, the world swimming in 
  and out of focus. His eyes look beyond Caburus to find

  OENOMAUS

  watching from the chutes. His face stricken with 
  disappointment.  And the hard loss of yet another so close 
  to him.

  CABURUS

  brings his sword down to finish Gannicus. But Gannicus bends 
  out of the way at the last moment, the blade SLICING OFF a 
  hunk of Gannicus  hair. Gannicus rolls and hurls the only 
  weapon within reach -- Gnaeus  fucking net.

  THE NET

  entangles Caburus  shield. He flings it aside, but Gannicus 
  has already grabbed up a spear. He attacks, running Caburus 
  through the thigh.





                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    50.

  CABURUS

  grunts in pain, his sword smashing down to break the spear 
  off. He attacks Gannicus, who now only has the jagged shaft 
  of the spear left as a weapon.

  GANNICUS DEFENDS HIMSELF,

  grim purpose once again welling in his eyes. He deflects a 
  blow and RAMS THE BROKEN SPEAR SHAFT THROUGH CABURUS  MOUTH.  
  The crowd ROARS. Batiatus goes insane.

  CABURUS DROPS TO HIS KNEES,

  gushing blood but still alive as he grasps at the deadly 
  shaft. A faint smile tugs at Gannicus  lips.

                                        GANNICUS

  Gannicus jerks up hard on the shaft, RIPPING CABURUS  HEAD 
  APART. He goes down in a gory spray. The arena EXPLODES.

  OENOMAUS

  locks eyes with Gannicus. Nods to him with a proud smile.

  PULVINUS

  Solonius sags. Lucretia beams beside her exuberant husband.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Yes! The House of Batiatus stands 
                        fucking triumphant!

  He catches himself for the profanity slip, sheepishly 
  looking towards the Magistrate.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Apologies.

                                          MAGISTRATE SEXTUS
                                  laughs)(
                        None required. A most impressive 
                        showing.

                                        BATIATUS
                        I but honor our city. And would 
                        have my champion continue to do so.

  He shoots Solonius a smug grin as the crowd chants Gannicus  
  name. He has once again reversed fortune towards his favor.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    51.

                                        CROWD
                        Gannicus! Gannicus! Gannicus!

                                          COSSUTIUS
                        I have mind towards your man for my 
                        own games.

                                        VARUS
                      As do I. Listen how he ignites the 
                        crowd.

  Solonius tenses, sensing opportunity for recovery.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Would they not forever remember 
                        this day, and the men responsible 
                        for it... if Gannicus were granted 
                        freedom?

                                        BATIATUS
                        Freedom?

                                        SOLONIUS
                        I would have granted the same in 
                        deference to the crowd. Had my man 
                        survived.

                                          MAGISTRATE SEXTUS
                      An excellent suggestion.
                                to Batiatus)(
                        You can always train another 
                        gladiator.  Yet to conclude the 
                        opening ceremonies with such a 
                        blessing...

  The Magistrate smiles politely. There is only one acceptable 
  answer, and Batiatus knows it. He forces a smile.

                                        BATIATUS
                      As I said. I honor this city.

  Solonius gloats as the Magistrate rises to address the 
  crowd.  Batiatus is forced to watch as everything he has 
  struggled for slips from his grasp.

                                          MAGISTRATE SEXTUS
                        Gannicus has proven himself to the 
                        city of Capua! Let him be 
                        rewarded... With freedom!

  The crowd ERUPTS. OFF GANNICUS  SHOCK...                                                                                    52.


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE/BALCONY - BATIATUS  LUDUS - DAY

  Batiatus and Lucretia stand on the balcony. Naevia attends, 
  thoughts of Diona still fresh.

  Gannicus, now dressed in the simple tunic of a freedman, 
  says his somber good-byes to the men assembled in the square 
  below.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        After all we have suffered. 
                        Gannicus is still lost to us.

                                        BATIATUS
                        I offered the man coin. Freedom to 
                        come and go as he pleases. If he 
                        would yet fight for this house.

  He takes note of Gannicus  solemn mood and forced smile as 
  the other men laugh and celebrate his release.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Memories haunt the man. Driving him 
                        from our walls.

  Lucretia s eyes fall on Crixus.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Crixus afforded himself well in the 
                        games. Let us turn hope towards 
                        him, that he may bring honor and 
                        good fortune.

  Batiatus notes the sparkle in her eyes. He is no fool, yet 
  sees the man pleases his wife. And would have it so.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Yes. Let us place stock in the 
                        Gaul.  And see what end he may 
                        service.

  TRAINING SQUARE

  Gannicus nods and grips arms with the men as he heads for 
  the gate. Barca bids grinning farewell.

                                        BARCA
                        I shall join you one day, you mad 
                        fuck.

                                        GANNICUS
                        I have no doubt.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    53.
  CONTINUED:

  Gannicus moves on. Crixus grasps his arm, holds it.

                                        CRIXUS
                      We still have not had proper 
                        contest.

                                        GANNICUS
                        Win your own freedom, and seek me 
                        out.

  Gannicus turns away, pauses. He turns back, undoing his 
  leather necklace.

                                          GANNICUS(cont'd)
                        This was given to me when I became 
                        champion of this house.

  He tosses it to a surprised Crixus.

                                          GANNICUS(cont'd)
                        Wear it with more honor than I 
                        have.

  Gannicus heads for the gate. Crixus considers the gift, a 
  smile bending his lips as he puts it on. He doesn t see 
  Ashur glaring from the shadows. Shoulder scarred. Leg bound 
  in a familiar brace. Silently swearing vengeance.

  OENOMAUS

  greets Gannicus at the gate with a RUDIS. The traditional 
  wooden sword presented to a gladiator that has won freedom.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        You have earned the rudis. Proof 
                        you no longer stand a slave.

  Gannicus takes it, eyeing all his victories carved into it.  
  There is not a square inch that has escaped.

                                        GANNICUS
                        A lifetime of blood.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        And victory. It lifts troubled 
                        heart, to see my brother gain his 
                        freedom. She would have been proud.

  Gannicus wrestles with his betrayal, his need to confess.

                                        GANNICUS
                        Oenomaus...


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    54.
  CONTINUED:

  He pauses, glancing up at Batiatus. Recalling his words of 
  warning.

                                          GANNICUS(cont'd)
                                  soft)(
                        She loved you. Above all others.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        The thought shall keep me warm. 
                        Until I join her in the afterlife.

                                        GANNICUS
                        I shall meet you there.

  Oenomaus grasps his arm, his love for Gannicus obvious.  
  Gannicus takes a last look at the life he knew, then heads 
  out of the gate. Oenomaus watches him for a long beat.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Doctore. Begin the day s training.

  Oenomaus nods. He unfurls his whip and CRACKS it, calling to 
  the men in his familiar commanding voice.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Practice swords!

  BALCONY

  Batiatus looks out across his Gladiators as they begin 
  training. His jaw sets in grim determination.

                                        BATIATUS
                                to Lucretia)(
                        I would not hear the name Gannicus 
                        spoken again. Nor that of Tullius 
                      or his cock eating apprentice. 
                        These things are of the past. We 
                        must look towards brighter future.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      My eyes are firmly fixed.

  She steals a glance at Crixus below.

                                        BATIATUS
                      We will see this house elevated. 
                        Beyond my father. Beyond Solonius. 
                        Beyond the gods them fucking 
                        selves. We shall leave our mark 
                        upon this city. And one day, see 
                        proper reward for all we have done.                                                                                    55.


  INT. ATRIUM - BATIATUS  VILLA - NIGHT

  The final scene from Ep 113. Batiatus lays dying next to a 
  wounded Lucretia. Spartacus addresses the blood drenched 
  Gladiators and frightened Slaves.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Your lives are now your own. Forge 
                        your own path... or join with us, 
                        and together we shall see Rome 
                        tremble!

  The Gladiators and Slaves CHEER.

  TIGHT ON BATIATUS,

  the roar of rebellion coming through in distorted waves as 
  the life fades from his eyes. Death and blood his true 
  reward. Finally earned.

                                                                          FADE OUT.
