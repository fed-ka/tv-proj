          FADE IN:

  11INT. JOHNNY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

          JOHNNY has a visitor, PENNY BARTON.  She's mid-20s,
          definitely attractive and completely at home as she
          shuttles around Johnny's kitchen, fixing a meal.  The
          table in the b.g. is set for two, candles burning.  A
          classic song plays on the stereo.

                                        PENNY
                        I'm so glad we're finally able to
                        do this, you know?  I can't tell
                        you how long I've been wanting to
                        cook for you.
                                (looks around)
                        Frying pan... big one?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Oh, uh... down there.

          Johnny points to a cabinet, looking on from a seat at the
          counter.  He's oddly dressed considering the occasion:  
          pajamas, hair mussed.  Penny doesn't seem to mind.  She
          finds the pan, puts it on the heat, tosses in a slab of
            butter...

                                        PENNY
                        Your house is amazing.  I've been
                        sort of picturing it in my mind,
                        but it's even nicer than I
                          expected.  Comfy, you know?

          She goes to a GROCERY BAG on the counter, reaches in,
          then STOPS, hesitant to reveal what's inside.

                                        PENNY
                        Okay.  I don't know if you're a
                        seafood guy, but you have to trust
                        me on this.
                                (takes out a bag of
                                  shrimp)
                        You'll love it, I promise.  It's
                        sort of my specialty.  Olive oil?

                                        JOHNNY
                                (points to cabinet)
                        Uh, in there... Next one over.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: MISBEGOTTEN - TEASER - 11/14/02 PINK        2.

          She finds it, starts measuring... Stops, smiles, honest...

                                        PENNY
                        All right, confession... I've
                        been practicing this recipe all
                        week.  Probably made it six times.
                                (barks a laugh)
                        If my cats never see another shrimp
                        again, they'll be happy.

                                        JOHNNY
                        So you've got cats.

                                        PENNY
                        Yeah.

                                        JOHNNY
                        A whole bunch, I bet.

                                        PENNY
                                (smiles, touched)
                        I do.  How'd you know?

          Johnny shrugs, waves it away with a smile.  The shrimp
          hit the frying pan with a sudden SIZZLE.

                                        PENNY
                        Okay, the key is, three minutes a
                        side.  Any more, they go rubbery.

          She sips her wine, eyes Johnny, smiling, so happy to be
          here.  Then her hand finds a LARGE KNIFE in the knife
          block.  Shing!  Johnny's eyes go wide.

                                        PENNY
                        Geez, look at you.  A little jumpy
                        tonight or what?

          As she starts slicing a lemon, a NOISE comes from the
          hall, the DOOR OPENING.

                                        DEPUTY'S VOICE
                        Mr. Smith?

                                        JOHNNY
                        In here!

                                        PENNY
                                (confused, pouting)
                        Johnny, I thought it was just
                        gonna be us tonight.  

          TWO DEPUTIES enter.  One sees the knife, goes for his
          gun.  Johnny raises a hand --


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: MISBEGOTTEN - TEASER - 11/08/02 BLUE        3.


  1CONTINUED: (2)1

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's all right.  She's pretty
                        much harmless... I think.

          Penny sets the knife aside, hurt.

                                        PENNY
                        Johnny, what's going on?

                                        DEPUTY
                        C'mon, sweetie.  Time to go.  

                                        JOHNNY
                        She said she rowed a boat across
                        the lake...

                                        DEPUTY
                                (to Penny)
                        You scaled that rock wall out
                        back?

          He shakes his head in disbelief.  She smiles, shrugs...

                                        PENNY
                        I knew he'd like me if he got to
                        know me.

          As she's cuffed and led out, she calls back to Johnny --

                                        PENNY
                          Remember, three minutes a side. 
                        Anymore and they're rubber.

          Off Johnny...

                                                                              FADE OUT.

          SUPER: A WEEK LATER

                                        BRUCE (V.O.)
                        You have a public profile now,
                        man.  People are out there, aware
                        of you, watching you, thinking
                        about you...

          INT. JOHNNY'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

          PURDY and BRUCE look on as a pair of SECURITY TECHS work
          on Johnny's system.  Holes in the plaster, ladders, bundles
          of Cat 5 cable suggest a major upgrade in progress.  Johnny
          looks on ruefully... unhappy that his life's been
            disrupted...

                                        BRUCE (CONT'D)
                        I know you don't like to think
                        about it but you've got to now. 
                        Before someone decides to shoot
                        you to impress Jodi Foster.  People
                        do these things.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (shakes his head)
                        Why don't we just dig a moat while
                        we're at it, fill it with sharks?

                                        BRUCE
                        Hey, don't knock it.  It worked
                        for Rob Roy.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Rob Roy.

                                        BRUCE
                          Scottish dude.  Kilts and castles.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Every new lock on the door doesn't
                        just lock the crazies out... it
                        locks me in, Bruce... I feel
                          isolated enough as it is... I
                        used to have a life once...  

          Purdy enters with a contractor... holding a set of plans...
          moves to Johnny... hands him the plans...

                                        PURDY
                        Safe room.  Reinforced walls,
                        steel door, separate communication
                          system...  Impenetrable.

                                        JOHNNY
                        No.

                                        PURDY
                        All the best homes have them
                          nowadays.  Nothing to be
                          embarrassed about.

  2CONTINUED: (2)2

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm not embarrassed.  I'm
                          speechless.  Thanks anyway.

          Purdy accepts the verdict, moves off with the contractor...

                        around the perimeter... are you
                        sure 200 feet is enough...?

          He's gone.  Johnny shakes his head...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I gotta get out of here.  I have
                        a lunch date with Dana...

          Moving with them toward the front door...

                        I don't know.  Didn't call her
                        for awhile, then called and
                          canceled once...

                        So, you're screwing up.

                        And of course, she thinks it's

                        was a one night mistake...

  33INT. JOHNNY'S CAR - DAY

          Johnny drives, piloting the Jeep down a tree-lined stretch
          of country road, no other cars in sight.  He's lost in
          thought, the Dana/Sarah dilemma heavy on his mind. 
            Suddenly, Johnny SEES SOMETHING, snaps from his trance...


  44JOHNNY'S P.O.V. - UP AHEAD

          An ACCIDENT -- an old Chevy, veered from the road, nose
          against a tree.  Steam rises from the hood.  A single
          passenger, slumped behind the wheel.  Johnny brakes hard,
          pulls off the road...


  55EXT. ROADSIDE - DAY

          Johnny hops from the Jeep, approaches the Chevy.  And we
          may notice California plates, some industrial band bumper
            stickers, but Johnny's eyes are on the driver:  a very
          attractive woman in her early thirties, ANITA... she seems
          dazed and disoriented...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Are you hurt?

          Anita has to think about it for a second.

                                        ANITA
                        I... I don't think so.  God, I
                        don't know what happened.  I only
                        looked down for a second...

                                        JOHNNY

                                        ANITA
                        No.  I-I think I'm all right...

          Dana on her cell as she waits for her car at a valet stand.

                        About twenty times.  Do you have
                        any idea where he could be?

                        Dana, if Johnny had a date with
                        you, he wouldn't...

                                        DANA
                        If he checks in, ask him to give
                        me a call.  That is, if it isn't
                        too much trouble.

          She clicks off, thinks for a beat.  Then grabs her bag
          and goes.


    1010INT./EXT. BANNERMAN HOUSE - FOYER - DAY - LATER

          The doorbell RINGS.  Footsteps, then SARAH appears. 
          Upbeat, smiling, she opens the door.  The smile fades...

                        Excuse me, I'm very busy.

          Closing the door in her face... Dana sticks her foot in
          the door... the door jams against it...

          Walt's a little thrown by this.

          A old rambling structure that juts starkly from the

          talk a little about these three women - all of them are
          quite attractive in their own way but all quite different
            personalities.  Anita, the oldest, is intense in a
            Sigourney Weaver 'Alien' sort of way, quite dedicated to
          solving the mystery at hand... Penny, the middle one is
          soft and affectionate and needy... Maddy is a bundle of

          Walt addressing Roscoe and his other DEPUTIES, along with
          Sarah, Dana and Bruce.  Mid-scene as he answers a question.

                        We don't know for sure that this
                        is an abduction, but we're gonna
                        treat it as one to be safe.  
                        Roscoe, we need to be ready if
                        the kidnappers call.  Take Rudy
                        and Alice, get set up on the phones
                        at Reverend Purdy's office,
                          Johnny's house and here as well,
                        just to cover our bases...

                        What about the girl who broke

                        First call I made was to the
                        Sheriff up in Braxton.  They're
                        trying to locate her now.

                        I want an embargo on this story
                        for 48 hours... I don't want every
                        looney tune coming out of the

                        retrace Johnny's movements over

          need to see it.

                        Look, whether you believe me or
                        not, this is just a bad idea...
                        you don't want to go to prison,
                        do you?

  3333INT. MASTER BEDROOM - DAY (TWENTY YEARS AGO)

          CHERYL CONNOR, 39, is slipping on a plain farm-type
          dress... she has a weathered but proud look... dark hair
          in a bun, simple...

                                        MRS. CONNOR
                          I thought I'd buy a roast...

          DANIEL CONNOR, 47, bushy moustache, silver hair, walks in
          from the bathroom, buttoning his checkered shirt, a genuine
          farmer who works with his hands... Johnny is standing
          there observing the most routine of conversations...

                                        MR. CONNOR
                        I can pick one up on the way back
                        from town.

                                        MRS. CONNOR
                        If you want, I'll bake a pie. 
                        There were nice peaches
                          yesterday...

                        A man and wife... the radio is

          He turns to ---

          who is standing there in a split reality (lighting on her
          is different) with her file... her eyes narrow... (the
          other women are not visible)...

                        Yes.

                                        MR. CONNOR
                        You want to invite the Petersons?

                        He drinks too much.  And he gets
                        mean when he's drunk.

                        Yes.  In a bun.

          She walks incongruously into this vision, shows him a
            photograph... the moment he looks, the Connors FREEZE in
            mid-action...

          INSERT - THE PHOTOGRAPH

          a B&W shot of the same couple lying dead at the base of a
          stairwell, their clothes slashed and bloodstained... quick,  
          more of an impression than a good look...


          JOHNNY REACTS TO THE HORRID PHOTO

                          Someone's singing.  A girl.  In a
                        near-by room.

          Johnny follows the sound of the voice, moving past the
          frozen Connors...


  3535INT. FARMHOUSE - PLAYROOM - DAY - PAST - VISION

            A twelve-year-old girl (TINA) is swinging a jump rope...
          as Johnny walks in... a beat later, Anita follows...

          looks away... then notices --


          ANGLE - ANOTHER KID IN THE ROOM 

          that he hadn't noticed before... a boy this time, twelve...
          he's over in the corner... reading... and he's the sort
          of kid you might not notice, just beginning to fill out,
          gawky, pimply, glasses... he's frozen too...

                                        JOHNNY

                        crawlspace during the killings. 
                        They didn't find him for three
                        days.  He couldn't speak for a
                        year afterwards.  He's spent most
                        of his life in and out of mental
                          institutions.  No one's heard
                        from him in two years... I've
                        tried everything to find him...

          And as Johnny turns back to look at the frozen boy, there's
          a --


  3636FLASH

          and we pull out to find Johnny is still bound to his chair -
          though he's been wheeled into the playroom while we've
          been in the vision... Anita holding the photograph for
          him to see... further revealing Penny and Maddy... the
          kids are gone and it's present day again...

                                        MADDY
                        Great stuff!  I have to recharge
                        the batteries.  Johnny, if you'll
                        give me the details, I'll dramatize
                        the visions with actors later on. 
                          Wonderful work everyone.  We'll

          Anita shrugs, but she tries to explain, in her own way.

                        I'm just trying to solve a mystery.

                        be alive for all we know.  It's
                          important to me that we find him.

                        Why?

                          murderer action figures on the
                        net, Mr. Smith?  Bundy, Manson,
                        Gacey in his clown outfit.  They're
                        all in jail or dead.  Which is
                        why they don't frighten us any
                        more, why they can be toys.  I'd

          Then she leaves him alone.  A beat, then Johnny starts to
          struggle with his bonds...

          So dark we barely can see... but something is moving in

          to make sure the sound isn't too loud... then gently opens

  3838INT. FAITH HERITAGE MAIL ROOM - NIGHT

          Dana and Sarah sorting through mail... Sarah pausing on
          one...

                                        SARAH
                        Whups, think I've got another
                        one...

                                        DANA
                        Penny Barton?

                                        SARAH
                                  (acknowledges)
                        Same handwriting as the others. 
                        Same return address.

          She opens it... nods...

                                        SARAH
                          'Johnny, if you touch this letter,
                        you'll be touching me...' Russell
                        Crowe doesn't get letters like
                        these.

                                        DANA
                        Sure he does.

                                        SARAH
                        That makes thirteen letters in
                        three months from this Barton
                        woman.

          She refolds it and puts it on a stack of maybe a dozen
          others that she's set aside from the bigger pile...

                                        DANA
                        I've still got you by two... with
                        my pile from... Mrs. Hazel Glim
                        of Butte, Montana who thinks
                          Johnny's a sign from the Lord
                        that the world is coming to an
                        end...

          Sarah nods wearily.  We sense this seemingly futile search
          has forged a fragile truce between the two.

                                        SARAH
                        All these people... complete
                          strangers... and every one of
                        them convinced that they know
                          Johnny...

                          Intimately.

          They continue sorting mail.

                        They should talk to us.  We'd
                        tell him the skinny on the guy...
                        how he wears the same clothes for
                        two days in a row sometimes...

                                        SARAH
                        Oh, I hate when he does that. 
                        And... and... sings off key with
                        the radio in the car...

                        ...his mouth full... uh huh, uh

                        And snores.

          Sarah avoids that one... with a 'does he, really?' look. 
          More sentiment:

                                        SARAH
                        He's good at finding lost car
                        keys though.

                                        DANA
                        Yeah.  And he doesn't watch a lot
                        of sports on TV because he knows
                        who's gonna win, poor guy.

                                (sighs)
                        You think he's okay?

                        What we need is a psychic to find

                        one behind Hazel.

          This letter is not the same girlish stationery of the
          other Penny letters but instead bears the LOGO of the
          Travelodge motel chain (no return address, though).  Sarah
          checks the postmark.

                                        SARAH
                        This one was just sent a few days
                        ago... wonder what she was doing
                        at a motel in Bangor...  

          And off their curious looks...


  3939INT. FAITH HERITAGE - PURDY'S OFFICE - NIGHT

          As Purdy enters with in-house counsel MIKE KENNEDY.  An
          artist's rendering of the new Faith Heritage Theology
          Building is on an easel. 

                                        KENNEDY
                        Somehow they tracked down our IP
                          address, breached the firewall,
                        and shot their videostream down
                        our T3 line.

                                        PURDY
                        How much are they asking for?

                                        KENNEDY
                          Actually, they want to pay us.
                                (off Purdy's reaction))
                        Just promise me you'll watch the
                        whole thing before you say no.

          Kennedy has already pressed a button on the computer and
          an animated PRESENTATION PACKAGE unfolds on the screen.


          ON THE MONITOR

          ANIMATED MADDY strolls onto the screen -- smiles and
          waves...

                                        ANIMATED MADDY
                        Sorry I can't join you in person
                        today, Reverend... but I'm on
                          location on production of my new
                        movie coming soon to a multiplex
                        near you.  Here's a sneak preview.

          A remote control appears in animated Maddy's hand and she
          aims it at camera.  VIDEO FOOTAGE fills the screen.  First,
          Johnny's abduction.  Then in his chair.  Reactions.

                        the Sheriff...

                        The deputies are downstairs...

          The footage continues as:

                                        ANIMATED MADDY (V.O.)
                          Johnny's fine... there's nothing
                        to worry about... he will be
                          released shortly if you follow
                        these instructions.  Attached to
                        this file is a seven minute trailer 
                        for our film that we'd like you
                        to run on the Faith Heritage
                        Network tonight at ten.  We have
                        already advised potential
                          distributors of this broadcast
                          schedule.

          The animated Maddy reappears.

                                        ANIMATED MADDY (CONT'D)
                        In return, we're prepared to give
                        Faith Heritage Charities five
                        percent of the adjusted gross
                        profits should distribution be
                        secured as a result of your
                          telecast.  It's only reasonable...
                        and we are reasonable people,
                          Reverend... for Johnny's sake, I
                        hope you are too.  See you on the
                        tube...

          The animation ends.  Purdy is outraged, outraged.

                                        PURDY
                        They may think they're going to
                        soothe their conscience or evade
                        prison with this blood money, but
                        I can assure you... 

          Kennedy shrugs, hands Purdy a document...

                          million, foreign.  Eight-five
                          million, Video, DVD, cable and
                          pay-per-view.  Five percent would
                        come to the neighborhood of
                          seventeen million. 

          Purdy sits, dazed at the numbers...

                        I know how disappointed you've
                        been with the fund raising efforts
                        for the new Theology Building...  

          Purdy looks at him... looks at his lovely plans for the
          Theology Building... almost has to laugh at the ridiculous
            suggestion... almost laughs but not quite...


  4040INT. FARMHOUSE - PLAYROOM - NIGHT

          Johnny is practicing using his toes to slowly move the
          chair... it's difficult but not impossible... it's hard
          to see how this might help but it's the human spirit of
          survival driving him on.  He brushes up against a small
          dressing table with a mirror and...


  4141INT. PLAYROOM - DAY - PAST - VISION

          STARTING ECU on long red hair being brushed out.  The
          hair crackles with static as the brush passes along.  The
          hair is luxurious, the brush's passage electric, charged. 
          It feels almost sensuous... we should feel this too.

          PULLING BACK to find Nicholas standing behind his sister,
          TINA, as he brushes her hair, while Tina eyes her
          reflection in the mirror.  The brush hits a knot.

                                        TINA
                        Ouch.  Nicholas, be careful.

          Nicholas keeps brushing... he glances at the mirror, sees
          his own pimply reflection, then looks away unhappily...
          back at his sister's hair.

  4242RESUME - PRESENT

          As Johnny looks up to see Penny knocking.  She enters
          with a tray of food.

                                        PENNY
                        Ready for some dinner?

                        You have to eat.

                                        JOHNNY
                        No really, the toll house cookies
                        were really filling.

          She puts the tray down on a child's round table... and
          sits in a child sized chair opposite Johnny.

                                        PENNY
                        You're angry with me.

          She shyly sits on his taped lap... tries to snuggle in

          his fear of this crazy person... stays with his plan to
          turn her into an ally...

  4343INT. MOTEL RECEPTION - NIGHT

          A young MOTEL MANAGER (SPICUZZA) is checking his computer,
          talking to Dana and Sarah...

                                        MANAGER
                        I'm sorry, as I told you on the
                        phone, no Barton has been
                        registered here recently...

          Dana slides a photograph of Penny across the counter...

                                        DANA
                        Maybe you've seen her?

          The manager glances at the photo... recognizes her...

                                        MANAGER
                        Yes!  She sang in our karaoke bar
                        a few nights ago. "Summer Wind" I
                        think it was.

          That seems like a dead end.

  4444INT. PLAYROOM - AS BEFORE

          Penny is unbuttoning her blouse...

                        brought us together... brought us
                          together on this night.

          And her skirt hits the floor, leaving her in just her bra*
          and slip, Johnny staring at her in disbelief...*

          walk out of the bedroom in a split reality... both holding
          hunting rifles... the father is stern-faced... the boy is
          unhappy... they may have just had an argument... but it's
          quick, they pass by Johnny and are gone from view...

          are out of eye-line, though he can see the sickle on the
          wall...

          He pushes himself quickly past the door... propels himself
          farther along.  He rounds a corner... and finds himself
          at the top of a flight of stairs, a landing halfway down. 
          Shit.  No way he's getting out this way, not tied to the

          Penny is helping him turn himself right side up...  The

          Anita, hereafter NICHOLAS/ANITA, struggles to find reality.

          break.

          Suddenly Nicholas/ANITA STOPS, realizing that the mirror,
          the whole MEDICINE CABINET, IS LOOSE.

          She tugs the cabinet, pulling it from the wall and opening
          a 12" x 20" hole.  Unsure, driven by a faint memory, she
          reaches inside... and pulls out the blood-encrusted SICKLE,
            HORRIFIED but THRILLED at the discovery.  She holds the
          sickle, running her fingers over the encrusted blood, the 
          still sharp edge.  Even after twenty years, the metal 
          retains enough polish to offer a rough reflection...

          No answer.  He moves cautiously toward the bathroom...
          the door is cracked open... he pushes it... Anita's not

                        lashed out... violently... at his

          turns again, sensing the motion but missing it.  As he
          starts back down the stairs...

                                        JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                        But some part of him must've wanted
                        the truth to come out...
                                (beat)
                        That's why you brought us back
                        here, isn't it?  To tell yourself
                        the truth... and get the help you
                        must know you need...

          At the base of the stairs, he enters the kitchen... as a
          shadow moves into frame behind him... a hand with the
          sickle visible in silhouette... Johnny senses it just
          before it swings... there's a blur of a slashing sickle...
          And Johnny reels back, his shirt ripped by the blade...
          he runs out of the kitchen.. the face of Nicholas/Anita
          moves past camera, sickle raised for another slashing
          attack.


  6666INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          TIGHT ON the video camera, unmanned, propped on the tripod,
            recording... as Johnny stumbles in...


          VIDEOCAM POV

          As Nicholas/Anita follows, Johnny using his cane to block*
          some more crazed slashes, ducking others, as furniture is*
          SLICED, lamps are SMASHED... and this all happens very*
          fast:*


          RESUME FILM - FOLLOWING THE SICKLE

          As it swings again, Johnny springs at her and they go
          down to the floor but she/he's deceptively strong... and
          has the brief advantage, raises the sickle up high for a
          final blow...


          CLOSE ANGLE - NICHOLAS/ANITA'S HANDS GRIPPING THE SICKLE'S
          HANDLE SWING DOWN...

          ...and are CAUGHT by Johnny's hands, just in time... as
          camera now travels down the curving blade to find the
          point suspended just over one of Johnny's eyes.


            NICHOLAS/ANITA

          puts all her strength and weight behind the blade, trying
          to force it into Johnny's skull, and Johnny resists.  But
          she has a frenzied strength and he's battered and
            weakening...

            Suddenly, he rolls, manages to pin her wrists... her wig


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: MISBEGOTTEN - ACT FOUR - 11/08/02 BLUE     53.


    66CONTINUED:66

          falls off, revealing a balding male pattern head... Johnny
          pulls the sickle from her hand.  He holds her down,
            breathing hard.  Sirens arriving outside.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's over, Nicholas.  It's over.

          And just as suddenly, the strength and madness ebbs out
          of her, and she begins to sob... like a child...

          SMASH!  The door busts in and Walt, his deputies and New
            Hampshire State police pour inside... Walt stopping as he
          and Johnny exchange relieved looks...

                                                                          TIME CUT TO:


  6767INT. FARMHOUSE LIVING ROOM -  NIGHT

          A short time later.  The women are being led out in
          cuffs... 

                                        MADDY
                                (to cops)
                        That camera and all videotapes
                        are my property.  My entertainment
                          attorney is in L.A.... his card
                        is in my back pocket...

                                        WALT
                        I don't think an 'entertainment'
                          attorney is exactly what you need
                        right now...

          Penny moves by escorted by a state trooper...

                                        PENNY
                        You really would have, you know...
                                (off Johnny's look)
                        Liked me... when you got to know
                        me.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Take care of yourself, Penny.

                                        PENNY
                                (as she's moved away)
                        Write me?

          For Johnny's benefit...

                                        DANA
                        What in the world does she see in
                        him?

                                        SARAH
                        Got me.

                                        DANA
                        Come on.  I'll give you a ride
                        home.  

          The two women smile at Johnny, go off together...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (to Bruce)
                        When did those two start...
                                (buddying up)

                                        BRUCE
                        I think when they saw the
                          autographed bras and panties you've
                        been getting...

                                        JOHNNY
                        That reminds me.  I've got to
                        talk to Purdy about form letters.  

          As Johnny prepares to go, camera swings to show the video
          camera on the tripod, its red recording light still
            blinking.


          VIDEOCAM POV

          Of the group leaving.  Then Johnny looks back.

                                        JOHNNY
                        One second.

          He approaches, reaches toward the viewfinder, and the
          screen goes BLACK...

                                        END OF ACT FOUR

                                              THE END

          Well, almost... because after all the credits run and the
          logos do too... we fade in on a marquee on a city street...
          it says FARMHOUSE, A MADDY POWERS FILM... A line wraps
          around the corner for the next show.          DEAD ZONE: MISBEGOTTEN - ACT FOUR - 11/14/02 PINK     55.
