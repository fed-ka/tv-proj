      The fifty members of the FBI GRADUATING CLASS, resplendent in
      their best dark suits and dresses, are seated in the first
      four rows. The rest of the auditorium is filled with SPECTATORS -
      friends and family - here to witness the graduation.

      Quantico Section Chief, Special Agent RAY CAMPBELL, speaks
      from the podium, the Shield of the Federal Bureau of
      Investigation hanging prominently above him. Campbell is 55,
      his features hardened by a quarter century of work as a field
      agent. Also on the dais are a number of dignitaries, including
      the FBI's Deputy Director. This is a big deal. 

      Campbell looks at the young faces as he begins:

                                      CAMPBELL
                    We are here today to honor the fifty
                    newest agents of the Federal Bureau
                    of Investigation. I'm talking to
                    you, ladies and gentlemen, because
                    inside these walls you are the best
                    of the best... 
                          (pauses for effect)
                    Inside these walls. I want you to
                    take a moment and think about what's
                    going to happen outside those doors...

    As Campbell continues his speech we begin to --

                                                                        INTERCUT WITH:


      Campbell continues with a slightly bemused grin.                                                                                        3.


                                      CAMPBELL
                    Drop those worried faces. None of
                    you accused me of being warm and
                    fuzzy.

      Light laughter from the cadets. 

                                      CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
                    For most of you - not all - that's a
                    long way off. You're just starting
                    this journey. 

      Campbell's gaze settles on one cadet in particular: MIKE
      WARREN - 27, clean cut - as perfect a boy scout as ever was.
    He winks at Mike. Mike can't help but break into a grin.

                                      CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
                    If you have a dream, now is the time
                    to pursue it. Because everything you
                    have acquired of value in your very
                    short time on this earth - with the
                    exception of some piece of shit car
                    and that one nice suit I know you
                    bought just for today...

      That gets some titters from the parents.

                                      CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
                    Everything you are worth is locked
                    inside you. 

                                                                        INTERCUT WITH:


      Campbell takes in all the cadets.                                                                                        4.


                                      CAMPBELL
                    I will leave you with this...

                                                                        INTERCUT WITH:


      Campbell looks from cadet to cadet earnestly.

                                      CAMPBELL
                    When that day comes... Ihope you
                    will have the brains, the guts - and
                    just the straight up good luck - to
                    survive it.

      A long moment of anticipation as we CUT TO:


      Campbell, smiling at them now:

                                      CAMPBELL
                          (a beat, then big)
                      Congratulations. You are now agents
                    of the Federal Bureau of
                      Investigation.                                                                                         6.


      The fifty newly minted agents rise, cheering themselves,
      then turn to wave to their audience as APPLAUSE mounts.

    We stay with Mike. Campbell catches his eye. He smiles at
      him with quiet pride. Mike smiles back, his happiness
      contagious.


      This is the Los Angeles field Division of the DEA, the office
    of ELIZABETH O'CONNOR, Special Agent in Charge of Operations
      for the L.A. Division. She's 45, tough as nails.

      Across from her is GERRY SILVO, a DEA group supervisor. He
      has a deeply lined face, making his thirty-odd years a good
      guess at best. There is no love lost between these two. 

                                      O'CONNOR
                    You have a room open in Graceland.

      Silvo sits stone faced. He's genuinely surprised by this.

                                      SILVO
                    I wasn't aware of that.

                                      O'CONNOR
                    One of your DEA agents was shot twice
                    in the chest.

                                      SILVO
                    He's not dead.

                                      O'CONNOR
                    Do you expect him back to work soon?

      Silvo glares. This is harsh, even for her.

                                      SILVO
                    His name is Donnie Martinez. He's
                    critical but stable. Thanks for your
                    concern.

      The two stare at each other. Silvo has never liked politics.
      O'Connor thrives on it. She slides over a thin folder.

                                      O'CONNOR
                    I'd like you to move this agent into
                    his room. His name is Mike Warren.
                    He's with the Bureau.

      Silvo flips through the folder, stopping on a picture of
      Mike - our boy scout. Silvo flashes a wry grin.

                                      SILVO
                    Top of his class at Quantico.

                                      O'CONNOR
                    Yes. You're lucky to have him in the
                    house.                                                                                        7.


                                      SILVO
                    And having Quantico's number one in
                    L.A. sure looks good for you.
                          (re: the file)
                    He requested D.C. He's not going to
                    be happy.

                                      O'CONNOR
                    He can learn to surf, work on his
                    tan.

                                      SILVO
                    He doesn't have the language skills
                    for L.A. He can't speak Spanish.

                                      O'CONNOR
                    We'll put him through linguistics
                    training. I'd like this handled
                    immediately.

                                      SILVO
                    So this isn't a discussion?

                                      O'CONNOR
                    No.

      She turns her attention to some paperwork on her desk,
      summarily dismissing him. Off Silvo, not at all happy about
      the situation.


      The local watering hole for cadets and agents. It's LOUD -
      food, beer, dancing - as the new grads celebrate ferociously.

    We focus on a table in the back: two new agents - they won't
    be with us long but I'll name them Steve and Terry to keep
      things simple (they are, of course, good-looking). They talk
      intently over a pitcher of beer and a bottle of tequila.
      They both have a healthy buzz going. They perk up as Mike
      enters and makes his way to them.

                    STEVETERRY
          Well?Did you get it?

      Mike slaps down a piece of paper on the table.

                                    MIKE
                    Gentlemen, you are looking at the
                    bureau's newest D.C. undercover field
                    agent. I report in the morning.

      They backslap and high-five him. Steve pours him a beer and
      a shot.

                                      TERRY
                    They don't waste any time.                                                                                        8.


                                      STEVE
                    That's because they friggin' love
                    him. They got him on the management
                    track.

                                      TERRY
                    You'll be running the Bureau before
                    you're 30.

                                    MIKE
                    Don't be ridiculous... 
                          (with unusual bravado)
                    Before I'm 40.

      Terry raises a shot glass. Mike and Steve raise theirs.

                                      TERRY
                    To power, the ultimate aphrodisiac.

                                    MIKE
                    If it got Kissinger laid it must be
                    true.

                                      STEVE
                    I'll drink to that.

      They down their shots and chase it with the beer.

      ANGLE: NEAR THE ENTRANCE AS CAMPBELL ENTERS

    He surveys the celebration. He spots Mike and his friends
      sitting at the back table and starts over.

      ANGLE: MIKE, TERRY AND STEVE

      Steve reloads their shot glasses.

                                      STEVE (CONT'D)
                    Here's to the slim chance of Mike
                    finally landing a woman he deems
                    worthy.

                                      TERRY
                    To the abuse of power!

                                    MIKE
                    The abuse of power! Here here!

      Once again they down the shots. Mike chases it with a beer,
      this time chugging it, draining the glass. He slaps the empty
      onto the table just as Campbell arrives.

                                      CAMPBELL
                    Gentlemen.

      The guys stumble to stand up, Terry and Steve swaying slightly.

                                      TERRY
                    Special Agent Campbell.                                                                                        9.


                                      CAMPBELL
                    Are you men drunk?

      They all exchange guilty looks.

                                      TERRY / STEVE
                    Yes sir.

                                    MIKE
                    Getting there sir.

      Campbell pulls over a passing waitress.

                                      CAMPBELL
                    Miss, how many drinks have these men
                    had? 

                                      WAITRESS
                    Two pitchers of Tecate and half a
                    bottle of Cuervo.

    He glares intimidatingly at the guys, then...

                                      CAMPBELL
                    That's not nearly enough.

      Campbell pulls three twenties out of his wallet and drops
      the bills on her tray.

                                      CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
                    Bring 'em another round.
                          (he adds another $20
                          bill to the tray)
                    And get them some decent tequila.
                          (to the guys)
                    As you were.

                    TERRYSTEVE
        Thank you sir.Thank you sir. 

      The guys begin to sit, but Campbell stops Mike with a hand.

                                      CAMPBELL
                    Agent Warren, walk with me.

    Oh shit. The other guys flash him conciliatory looks as
      Campbell leads Mike away from the noise. 

                                    MIKE
                    If my behavior today has in any way
                    reflected poorly on the Bureau...

                                      CAMPBELL
                    Can it, Warren. If you weren't drunk
                    tonight I'd put you in front of a
                    disciplinary hearing.                                                                                        10.


                                    MIKE
                    Then may I ask what you're doing
                    here, sir?

      Campbell hesitates for the briefest of moments; he knows how
      hard this is going to hit Mike.

                                      CAMPBELL
                    There's been a change in your
                      assignment. You're not going to D.C.

      Mike's face falls. 

                                      CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
                    I know how much the D.C. post means
                    to you. 

                                    MIKE
                    I don't understand. I'm supposed to
                    report in the morning.

                                      CAMPBELL
                    You're still shipping in the AM.
                    Just not to Washington.

                                    MIKE
                    Where am I going?

                                      CAMPBELL
                    Los Angeles for an undercover
                      assignment. They're putting you in
                    Graceland.

                                    MIKE
                          (confused)
                    Sir? Graceland?

                                      CAMPBELL
                    In 2003, a Federal task force arrested
                      a Columbian Drug Lord and seized his
                    beach front mansion in LA. Somebody
                    got the bright idea to stick agents
                    from the FBI, DEA and Customs in it
                    while they're on undercover
                    assignments.

                                    MIKE
                    Three agencies in one house?

                                      CAMPBELL
                    We have trouble getting the top kids
                    to work LA. High cost of living. Low
                    pay. If you want fun in the sun you
                    request Miami. Graceland solved that
                    particular problem. All you pay is
                    utilities.

      Campbell forces a grin. Mike doesn't reciprocate.                                                                                        11.


                                      CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
                    It's not that bad. Just getting into
                    the house is tough. There's a waiting
                    list. Hell, if I was your age I'd
                    kill for an opportunity like this.
                    Might loosen you up a little.

                                    MIKE
                    Yes sir. Can I ask, why?

                                      CAMPBELL
                    Why? Because you're too damn smart
                    for your own good. You're a hot
                    commodity and the LA section chief
                    thought she'd pull a coup and drag
                    your ass clear across the country.

      Mike doesn't like it. Campbell sighs, says seriously:

                                      CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
                    I can fight this, Mike. I think I
                    can get the deputy director on board.
                    It's going to take time.

                                    MIKE
                          (resigned)
                    Yes sir. Thank you, sir.

                                      CAMPBELL
                    I know the guy who runs the house.
                    Gerry Silvo, group supervisor with
                    the DEA and a good man. He understands
                    your situation. He had a suggestion
                    that I think may make this whole
                    thing a lot more palatable to you.
                    He's arranged to have Agent Briggs
                    as your training agent.

      For the first time in this conversation Mike risks a smile.

                                    MIKE
                    Paul Briggs?

                                      CAMPBELL
                    Yeah. Silvo's going to have the
                    discussion with him as soon as Briggs
                    gets off his shift.

                                    MIKE
                    What time did he go on duty?

                                      CAMPBELL
                          (with a wry grin)
                    Tuesday.                                                                                        12.


      PAUL BRIGGS is laid out face down on the bed. We don't see
      his face. An FBI jacket lays on the floor where he dropped
      it, along with a pair of muddy boots.

      JOE "JOHNNY" TUTURRO, whom we will soon meet -- begins
      POUNDING on the door.

                                      TUTURRO (O.S.)
                    Yo Briggs! Time to get up. We've got
                    five foot sets comin' in.

      Briggs does not get up. TUTURRO opens the door a cautious
      fraction, sticks his head in. He's wearing a wet suit. 

                                      TUTURRO (CONT'D)
                    Come on, man, let's go.

                                      BRIGGS
                          (muffled by mattress)
                    Get out, Johnny. I've got a gun.

                                      TUTURRO
                    Yeah, so do I. Get up.

      Briggs fumbles for a muddy boot, throws it. Tuturro barely
      ducks out of the way.

                                      TUTURRO (CONT'D)
                    That is not cool! You told me that
                    no matter what you said or how ugly
                    you got, not to let you sleep in.

                                      BRIGGS
                    I'd been awake fifty-two hours when
                    I said that.

                                      TUTURRO
                    If I let you nod off then you're
                    gonna yell at me because I didn't do
                    what you said --

      Briggs holds up another boot threateningly. Tuturro slams
      the door.

      Briggs lowers the boot, relishing the silence, he rolls on
      his back and this is the first time we get a good look at
      him. Mid-30s, his body lean and hard. There's also a hardness
    in the face accented by long Comanche hair and four days of
      beard stubble. He does not look like your typical FBI agent.

      Then... FORCEFUL KNOCKING. We MOVE UP to the door as Silvo
      enters. He catches the boot that comes hurtling up at him.

                                      SILVO
                    I'm sorry. Were you sleeping? Should
                    I come back later?                                                                                        13.


                                      BRIGGS
                    You know boss, that would be swell.

      Silvo rips open the shades, blasting the room with sunlight.
      Outside, ocean waves crash on the sand. Another beautiful
      morning in Manhattan Beach.

      Silvo steps into... 

      THE HALLWAY - He moves down two doors, opens a third,
      revealing a very neat, but full, room (this is Donnie
      Martinez's room). 

      It's full of Donnie's things; clothes, a bike, a surfboard.

      Silvo scowls. This is gonna be a pain in the ass. He goes
      next door, pounds on the door.

                                      SILVO
                    Lauren!

      From behind him we hear a familiar woman's voice:

                                      LAUREN (O.S.)
                    What?

      Silvo spins and we recognize the woman coming out of the
      bathroom as the woman we met in the open with the Russians.
      There is no trace of her earlier accent. This is DEA agent
      LAUREN MATLIN. Donnie was her partner.

                                      SILVO
                    Need you to get Donnie's stuff out
                    of his room.

      Lauren looks stunned. She stands there, unbelieving.

                                      LAUREN
                    Donnie's not dead.

                                      SILVO
                    Didn't say he was dead. I said his
                    stuff is in the way.

      Lauren shoves past him toward the bathroom as Briggs comes
      out of his room in his boxers, hair a mess, rubbing his eyes. 

                                      SILVO (CONT'D)
                          (yelling after Lauren)
                    We've got a new agent coming in.
                    You've got two hours!

                                      BRIGGS
                    That's it? I'm going back to bed.

                                      SILVO
                    No you're not. He's your new trainee.                                                                                        14.


    He throws Briggs the folder on Mike Warren. Briggs hands it
      off to Tuturro without a glance. Tuturro opens it, scans the
      contents jealously -- being Briggs's trainee is something he
      has coveted for a long time. Why this kid?

                                      TUTURRO
                    He got 1700 on his practicals? Is he
                    like a savant or something? 

                                      SILVO
                    His name is Mike Warren. I want him
                    treated with respect. He graduated
                    top at Quantico. 

      Lauren is coming back.

                                      LAUREN
                    So did Briggs and he can't even match
                    his socks.

      Briggs looks. His socks are mismatched.

                                      BRIGGS
                    These aren't my socks.

      Lauren confronts Silvo, hands on hips, giving him a dark look.

                                      LAUREN
                    You're not giving away Donnie's room.

                                      SILVO
                    I'll get Donnie back here as soon as
                    I can. This came down from O'Connor.
                    You want to argue, go argue with
                    her.

      Lauren doesn't register a reaction, but simply starts for
      the stairs. It occurs to Silvo what he's just suggested.

                                      SILVO (CONT'D)
                    Lauren! Get back here! That was a
                    figure of speech!

    We hear the downstairs door open, slam closed.

                                      SILVO (CONT'D)
                    Ah dammit. 

      Tuturro is still thumbing through Mike's file.

                                      TUTURRO
                    He runs a six-thirty mile? I was
                    doing that in fifth grade. He doesn't
                    know Spanish!

                                      SILVO
                    They're putting him through
                      linguistics training as we speak.                                                                                        15.


      Silvo snags the folder from Tuturro, throws it back to Briggs.

                                      SILVO (CONT'D)
                    His plane lands at ten-hundred.
                    Briggs, you will be there to pick
                    him up.

      Briggs blinks a few times.

                                      BRIGGS
                    Okay.

      Silvo looks at him suspiciously. That was too easy. 

                                      SILVO
                          (restating)
                    Ten-hundred.

      Briggs gives him a grin. Silvo, still wary, starts out. 

                                      SILVO (CONT'D)
                    Keep an eye on Lauren. I don't want
                    her anywhere near O'Connor. No, I'll
                    do that. You'll be at the airport.

                                      BRIGGS
                    Yes Sir.

      A last cynical look at Briggs and Silvo exits. The moment
      he's gone, Briggs turns to Tuturro.

                                      BRIGGS (CONT'D)
                    Johnny, need you to go to the airport.

                                      TUTURRO
                    It's my day off. I don't want to
                    spend all morning in a terminal. 
                          (re: folder)
                    And there's no picture.

                                      BRIGGS
                    So? Make a sign or something.

                                      TUTURRO
                    He's an undercover agent. I can't
                    make a sign. 
                          (beat)
                    Can I?

                                      BRIGGS
                    I'm going back to bed.

                                      TUTURRO
                    How am I supposed to know this guy?

                                      BRIGGS
                    Be a problem solver, Johnny. Be
                      Mexcellent.                                                                                        16.


      Briggs heads back to his room, leaving Tuturro to figure it out.


      Mike is in his coach seat listening to his iPhone via earbuds.
      The phone screen shows that he's listening to SPANISH MADE
      EASY. He makes notes in a small notebook.

      His tray table is down, a partially-eaten dinner in front of him. 

                                    MIKE
                          (repeating from lesson)
                    La comida esta muy buena. 

      The middle-aged HISPANIC WOMAN seated next to him looks
      surprised. She rattles off in Spanish:

                                      HISPANIC WOMAN
                    Te gusta mi rollo?

      She offers him her roll. Mike throws a confused look at it,
      takes off his headphones.

                                    MIKE
                    I'm sorry. I don't speak Spanish. 

                                      HISPANIC WOMAN
                    Oh. You said you like the food.

    He shows her his iPhone screen.

                                      HISPANIC WOMAN (CONT'D)
                    Spanish Made Easy.

                                    MIKE
                    S . 

    He grins but she doesn't get the joke.

                                    MIKE (CONT'D)
                    Job requirement. Thought I was going
                    to D.C., then, last minute I'm headed
                    to Los Angeles.

                                      HISPANIC WOMAN
                    What do you do?

      After a beat:

                                    MIKE
                    I'm a teacher. 

                                      HISPANIC WOMAN
                    Really? So is my brother. What school?

                                    MIKE
                    The one where all the Hollywood
                      troublemakers go.                                                                                        17.


      Mike's tone discourages further discussion of the subject.

                                      HISPANIC WOMAN
                    Do you have family in D.C.?

                                    MIKE
                    No. My family is in Boston. But I
                    thought D.C. is where my life was
                    going to be.

                                      HISPANIC WOMAN
                    I'm sure that if you're good at what
                    you do, you can go anywhere. Good
                    teachers are hard to find.

      A female FLIGHT ATTENDANT approaches.

                                      FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                    Excuse me, sir. Are you Special Agent
                    Mike Warren with the FBI?

      This is an awkward moment. Mike nods. 

                                    MIKE
                    Yes.

      The Hispanic woman raises an eyebrow but says nothing. The flight
      attendant pulls out a piece of paper with a handwritten note.

                                      STEWARDESS
                    This message was patched to you over
                    the cockpit phone: "Agent Warren,
                    wait under the baggage claim sign in
                    terminal C for your Field Training
                    Agent to arrive. Do not leave the
                    baggage area under any circumstances."

      Mike takes the message. The Flight Attendant exits with a
      last look back. Mike and the woman exchange uneasy smiles.

                                      WOMAN
                    Manos arriba.

                                    MIKE
                    Excuse me?

                                      WOMAN
                    It means, "hands up". It's probably
                    not in your lesson.

      Mike writes that down on his pad.


      Mike pulls his bags off the luggage carousel. He looks up at
      the "BAGGAGE CLAIM" sign above him. He drops his bags down
    on a bench directly below it.                                                                                         18.


    He sighs, takes out a steel-coiled grip flexer and starts
      squeezing it.

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:


      The baggage claim is nearly empty as Tuturro strolls in.
      There is only one person there: Mike, with his bags, standing
      directly under the "BAGGAGE CLAIM" sign, still squeezing the
      grip flexer.

                                      TUTURRO
                    Mike Warren, right?

                                    MIKE
                    Yes.

                                      TUTURRO
                    Wannna know how I knew that?

                                    MIKE
                    Because I was told to wait under
                    this sign and I am?

                                      TUTURRO
                    No, because only a guy who got
                    seventeen hundred on his practicals
                    and was told to wait underneath a
                    sign is still going to be waiting
                    two hours later.

                                    MIKE
                    Where's Agent Briggs?

      Tuturro frowns a little at this.

                                      TUTURRO
                    How do you know I'm not Briggs? 

                                    MIKE
                    Because you said "seventeen hundred"
                    like you were impressed. Paul Briggs
                    got a higher score than I did. From
                    that, I would conclude you did not.

      Tuturro stands there a beat. Extends a hand.

                                      TUTURRO
                    I'm Tuturro. Everybody calls me
                    Johnny.

      They shake hands and start out. 

                                      TUTURRO (CONT'D)
                    What are you doing with that hand
                    thing?                                                                                        19.


                                    MIKE
                    One hundred reps, each hand, every
                    day. Improves your gun control. 

      Tuturro lets out a long exhale. It's going to be a long day.


      There's a big painting of young Elvis hanging in the foyer. 

                                    MIKE
                    Is the whole house like this?

                                      TUTURRO
                    He was Colombian. We're lucky that
                    thing's not velvet.

      They walk into the huge open area. There's a bar to the left,
      a hot tub in the big bay window. Fortunately, the Elvis
      memorabilia is mostly relegated to the area behind the bar.
      Signed guitars, that photo with Nixon... The rest of the
      house; pure beach-front fantasy. Flat plasma screen TV, killer
      stereo system. Furniture designed to lounge. Mike is
      impressed. He takes notes as they go.

                                      TUTURRO (CONT'D)
                    There are six of us here. You, me
                    and Briggs are FBI. Charlie, Lauren
                    and Donnie are with DEA. Jakes is
                    Customs. 

                                    MIKE
                    Does that get weird, with other
                    agencies in one house?

                                      TUTURRO
                    You tell me.
                          (points as they walk)
                    Over here we got the bar and the hot
                    tub. If you have civilians over,
                    they stay down here. Nobody allowed
                    past the stairs without a badge.
                    That means no local girls upstairs. 

      They walk into the kitchen. 

                                      TUTURRO (CONT'D)
                    Here we've got the fridge, microwave. 

      Tuturro points to a color-coded chart on the fridge.

                                      TUTURRO (CONT'D)
                    You know what this is?                                                                                        22.


                                    MIKE
                    Looks like a chore wheel.

                                      TUTURRO
                    You are smart. We take turns cleaning
                    dishes, toilets, all that. I guess
                    for now wherever it says "Donnie,"
                    write in your name.

                                    MIKE
                    Donnie's the DEA guy who...

                                      TUTURRO
                    Got popped. Yeah.

      Tuturro pens in Mike's name.

                                      TUTURRO (CONT'D)
                    Good news is he doesn't have to clean
                    the bathrooms tomorrow. Mop's in the
                    hall closet.

      They go upstairs, first passing the...


      Tuturro and Mike stick their heads in. The walls are covered
    in acoustical foam. A couple of older, corded phones sit on
      tables, each with its own digital recorder. Every other
      available surface has a cell phone sitting on it or hanging
      from it, all connected to their chargers.

      Instructions taped on each one say things like, "ANSWER WITH
      JAMAICAN ACCENT!"

                                      TUTURRO
                    This is the phone room. This is where
                    you'll make all your U.C. calls.
                    Everything in here gets recorded so
                    don't make personal calls.

      One of the phone's marked "DEA - LAUREN" begins to RING.
      They stare at it. It RINGS again. 

      Lauren rushes in holding a tennis racket bag. She glares at
      Mike. He gives her a perfunctory nod.

                                      LAUREN
                    Keep your mouth shut.

      She answers the phone in flawless Russian. Tuturro motions
      Mike and they exit, closing the door behind them.

                                      TUTURRO
                    That's Lauren. Donnie was her partner. 

                                    MIKE
                    She was there when he got shot?                                                                                        23.


                                      TUTURRO
                    Yeah. You heard of the Vzakonye?

                                    MIKE
                    The Russian mob.

                                      TUTURRO
                    Lauren was into their heroin
                    operation. She arranged cash pickups
                    from Mexican and Colombian cartels.

                                    MIKE
                    The cartels work together like that?

                                      TUTURRO
                    Sure. It's all business. Donnie was
                    under with the Gallardo Cartel out
                    of Tijuana.

                                    MIKE
                    What happened?

                                      TUTURRO
                    He was doing a needle drop.

                                    MIKE
                    What's that?

                                      TUTURRO
                    They expect him to test the quality
                    of the heroin by shooting up so he
                    pretends to inject himself. What
                    he's really doing is sticking the
                    needle in a little rubber ball that
                    he's got tucked into his arm. The
                    ball popped out. They shot him.

                                    MIKE
                    Damn.

                                      TUTURRO
                    Yeah. Sometimes it just goes that
                    way. 

      Mike digests that. They reach Briggs's room. Tuturro KNOCKS.

                                      TUTURRO (CONT'D)
                    Briggs! Hey! I've got the new guy
                    out here!

      Tuturro cracks the door. THUNK. He snaps his head back as a
      boot hits the door. 

                                      TUTURRO (CONT'D)
                    You can meet him later. Let's check
                    out your room.

      They reach Donnie's room. It hasn't changed since we last saw
      it; still full of Donnie's stuff. A guitar.                                                                                         24.


      Pictures and posters everywhere. Clothes packed in the closets.
      A mountain bike hanging in the corner. Mike looks in, wary of
      stepping inside.

      Lauren exits the phone room, comes over. Mike offers a hand.
      She ignores it.

                                    MIKE
                    Hi. I didn't have a chance to
                    introduce myself. Mike Warren. 

                                      LAUREN
                    Hi Mike. This is my partner's room.
                    Don't move anything. Don't get
                    comfortable. 

                                    MIKE
                    Okay. 
                            (uncomfortable, then)
                    You play tennis?

                                      LAUREN
                    No.

      She pulls a machine gun out of the wall safe, tucks it in
      the tennis bag. Exits.

                                      TUTURRO
                    Don't worry about her... But maybe
                    you shouldn't move a lot of Donnie's
                    stuff.

      Mike steps into the room.

                                      TUTURRO (CONT'D)
                    Get unpacked. Find me later and we'll
                    grab a bite.

                                    MIKE
                    Thanks Johnny.

      Tuturro exits. Mike sets his suitcase on the bed. Opens it.
    He takes his stack of clothes and sets them next to the
      suitcase. That's it. He's unpacked. 


      Jakes peels off his shemiz, tosses it on the couch. He snags
      a beer from the bar and goes into the--

      KITCHEN - Mike and Tuturro are there.

      Mike has been shopping. He has a bag sitting beside him at
      the table full of shorts, shirts, sunscreen and a brand-new
      pair of flip-flops.

      Mike is eating cereal and there's a glass of orange juice in
      front of him. Jakes' eyes narrow.                                                                                        26.


                                      TUTURRO
                    Hey Jakes, this is Mike Warren, He's
                    with the Bureau. He's taking Donnie's
                    room.

                                    MIKE
                    You're with Customs.

      Jakes just glares. Mike plunges ahead, oblivious. 

                                    MIKE (CONT'D)
                    Johnny says you're working on cracking
                    a bird smuggling operation.

      Nothing. Just that glare. Now Mike is uncomfortable.

                                    MIKE (CONT'D)
                    I didn't realize that was a big
                    problem on the west coast.

                                      JAKES
                    It is. Half a million birds a year. 

                                      TUTURRO
                    You also got to watch out for the
                    bird flu, right Jakes?

                                      JAKES
                    Yeah. Virus could take down the whole
                    city.
                          (to Mike)
                    That's my juice.

                                    MIKE
                    Excuse me?

                                      JAKES
                    Do you see a D and a J on it? 

      Mike looks at the carton. There indeed is a handwritten "DJ"
    on it. 

                                    MIKE
                    That's a D? I thought it was an O. I
                    thought someone labeled it O.J.

                                      JAKES
                    O.J.? As in Orenthal James?

                                    MIKE
                    No, I didn't mean...

                                      JAKES
                    Dale Jakes. D. J. Just like this DJ.

    He snatches the Cap'n Crunch box that is similarly marked.
      Tuturro, who of course has arranged this little faux pas, is
      trying hard not to bust a gut.                                                                                        27.


                                      JAKES (CONT'D)
                    And you check the milk, guess what
                    you're gonna find?

                                    MIKE
                    D.J.?

                                      JAKES
                    That's right. Like everything on
                    this shelf here. 

    He points to a top shelf.

                                    MIKE
                    Sorry.

                                      JAKES
                    Do I look like your frat buddy? 

                                    MIKE
                    No.

                                      JAKES
                    Do I look like one of your college
                    pals?

                                    MIKE
                    It won't happen again.

      Jakes takes his Cap'n Crunch and stalks up to his room,
      passing Briggs who has just woken up.

                                      JAKES
                    Your new boy ate my cereal.

      Briggs can't think of a response to that, instead throws a
      look at Mike.

                                      BRIGGS
                    You must be Warren.

                                    MIKE
                    Yes sir. You're Agent Briggs.

      Briggs goes to the refrigerator, takes out the milk carton
      marked "DJ" and drinks directly from it.

                                    MIKE (CONT'D)
                    I'm honored to be training under you
                    sir. I'm ready to begin. 

                                      BRIGGS
                    Now?

                                    MIKE
                    Yes sir. Whenever you want.

      Briggs is unshaven, in his boxers. Not exactly what Mike was
      expecting from this legend. Briggs looks around the kitchen.                                                                                        28.


                                      BRIGGS
                    So... uh... are you familiar with
                    the chore wheel? 

                                    MIKE
                    Yes sir.

                                      BRIGGS
                    Good. So to get you started, wherever
                    it says Briggs, I want you to
                    substitute Mike. Help you with the
                    undercover name association. Tonight
                    where it says "Dishes, Briggs", I
                    want you to think "Dishes, Mike."

      Mike looks at the huge stack of dishes overflowing the sink.

                                      BRIGGS (CONT'D)
                    Think of it as a wax on, wax off
                    sort of thing. I'm going to get drunk.

      Briggs exits. Mike stares at the pile of dishes that's at
      least a week old. Mike shakes his head, disillusioned.

                                    MIKE
                    That's Paul Briggs?

      Tuturro grins, in awe of Briggs.

                                      TUTURRO
                    Yeah.


      This is not a nice place. Dozens of junkies -- young, old,
      mothers with their children -- all nodding in a heroin haze.
      The worst part: A ONE-YEAR-OLD GIRL has crawled out of her
      crib. Her mother oblivious, nodding in her own drug fog. The
      child wanders across the carpet, unaware of the needles and
      pipes on the filthy floor.

      Across the room a pair of green eyes peer out from under
      ropes of limp, greasy hair. This is a woman, although it may
      take us a moment to guess her gender under the shapeless
      clothes and yellowed teeth, the track-marked arms... The
      JUNKIE stands, catches the little girl and puts her back in
      the crib. The mother swims up from her haze. Dull eyes
        uncomprehending. She offers up a needle.

                                      JUNKIE
                    Nah. Gotta make rent.

      The mother grins, slips back into her fog. But the child is
      safe. For now. The Junkie exits the house.                                                                                        29.


      Mike is doing dishes. He's nearly finished. He is the only
      person downstairs. He hears a noise, someone outside the
      door. He looks: it's the Junkie. She tries the handle, puts
      a shoulder into it and the door pops open. 

      Mike drops behind the bar, fumbles his Beretta out of his
      waistband.

      The Junkie spots a jacket hanging over a barstool, feels it
      up. Pulls out a wallet, peels some cash out of it.

      That's enough for Mike. He leaps out. Gun drawn. Suds dripping
      from his hands.

                                    MIKE
                    FBI. Don't move! Hands above your
                    head.

      The Junkie reacts instantly, twisting the gun out of Mike's
      hand and dropping him on the carpet.

                                      JUNKIE
                    No guns downstairs.

      Mike has just met DEA agent CATHERINE "CHARLIE" LOPEZ.

      Drawn by the noise, Tuturro rushes downstairs, grins when he
      sees what's happened. Charlie flashes the money at him.

                                      CHARLIE
                    Hey Johnny, I'm taking back my twenty
                    bucks. 

      She goes upstairs. Mike stands there, rubbing his hand.

                                      TUTURRO
                    No guns downstairs.

                                    MIKE
                    I heard. Who's that?

                                      TUTURRO
                    That's Charlie.

      Mike watches her go, intrigued.


      SERIES OF TIGHT SHOTS AS CHARLIE SHOWERS: 

      CLOSE ON her hair, as the grease washes out. 

      CLOSE ON her mouth. The yellow dye running off...

      CLOSE ON the track marks as the water washes them away. They
      are only make-up. She leans against the wall, exhausted.                                                                                        30.


      Mike sits on the bed that is not his and bites the tag off
      his new flip-flops. He takes off his right sock and shoe,
      slips the flip-flop onto his foot. He wiggles his toes, it's
    an odd feeling.

      Just then a girl passes the door in a robe. Here, boys and
      girls, is where we lose our breath, because this is CHARLIE
      all cleaned up. And she cleans up good.

      She lingers at his doorway. And for a moment Mike forgets
      he's sitting there with only one shoe on.

                                      CHARLIE
                    Did I hurt you?

                                    MIKE
                    No. I'm double jointed. My arm can
                    make two complete revolutions before
                    it snaps off.

      She laughs. A nice sound.

                                      CHARLIE
                    You work with Donnie?

                                    MIKE
                    No. I'm your new roommate.

      This is news to her. She throws a curious look into the room
      that's still one-hundred percent Donnie.

                                    MIKE (CONT'D)
                    Lauren suggested I shouldn't unpack.

      Charlie nods, understanding. Mike extends a hand.

                                    MIKE (CONT'D)
                    Mike Warren. FBI.

                                      CHARLIE
                    Catherine Lopez. Ditto. Call me
                    Charlie. 

      They shake. A beat. 

                                      CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                    Well Mike Warren, I've had a long
                    day. Good-night.

      She starts down the hall. Mike calls after her.

                                    MIKE
                    I definitely like this look better.

      She turns back. Smiles. Gorgeous. And in that moment their
      eyes lock. And there it is... a single, instant and undeniable
      attraction. She holds his eyes a second, then turns away,
      disappearing into her own room.                                                                                        31.


      Briggs enters. Every single dish and pan has been cleaned
      and put away. He nods to himself.


      Briggs opens the door, throws a wetsuit on Mike.

                                      BRIGGS
                    Get up.


      Briggs, Mike and Tuturro enter, peeling off their wetsuits.
      Mike is beat to hell, bloody, but euphoric. All three are
      chattering about the sweet spot, the Zen of the wave... They
      enter the kitchen. Lauren yells from upstairs:

                                      LAUREN (O.S.)
                    Briggs!

                                      BRIGGS
                    Kitchen!

      Lauren comes down holding a message slip. Mike and Tuturro
      continue the surfing talk, not really paying attention to
      this conversation.

                                      LAUREN
                    You got a message from a guy named
                    Felix Londono.

                                      BRIGGS
                    You're checking my messages now?

                                      LAUREN
                    He wants to make a buy this morning.

                                      BRIGGS
                    So? He's off our active list.

                                      LAUREN
                    I checked his two-oh-two. He works
                    for Vzakonye. 

      Briggs chuckles, shakes his head.

                                      BRIGGS
                    He was a low-level dealer. We had
                    him tapped and he dropped a few
                    Russian names. That's it.

      Lauren stands there. Arms crossed. Eyes like steel.                                                                                         35.


                                      LAUREN
                    He works for Vzakonye.

                                      BRIGGS
                    He probably does their gardening. 

      She's grasping for straws. They both know it. But Briggs
      also knows that look and she's not budging.

                                      BRIGGS (CONT'D)
                    Hell... Alright. Mike, how'd you
                    like to do a reverse this morning?

      Mike is abruptly swept into the conversation.

                                    MIKE
                    Do what?

                                      LAUREN
                    He wants to buy eight yards of indoor.

                                    MIKE
                          (slightly panicked)
                    Indoor? What's indoor?

                                      BRIGGS
                    Indoor carpet. His code word for
                    coke. A yard's a key.

                                    MIKE
                    Kilo?

                                      BRIGGS
                    Yeah. 

                                      TUTURRO
                    Every dealer's got his own lingo.

                                      BRIGGS
                    Ready to start your first official
                    day as an undercover agent?

      Off Mike, not sure at all.


      Briggs checks a list and takes a dusty cell phone off the
      wall. He sets the phone on speaker and dials. On the second
      ring FELIX LONDONO answers. He has a jovial Mexican accent.

                                      FELIX (V.O.)
                    Yo.

                                      BRIGGS
                    Felix. It's Paul. Got your message.

                                      FELIX (V.O.)
                    Hey! Paul. Que pasa?                                                                                        36.


                                      BRIGGS
                    Nada mucho. Que tal?

      Mike whispers to Tuturro:

                                    MIKE
                    I thought he was Russian.

      Tuturro glances at Felix's 202, or personal history sheet.

                                      TUTURRO
                    Nah. He's Mexican. He just works for
                    them. His wife's Russian.

                                    MIKE
                    God...

                                      TUTURRO
                    Dude, I told you, melting pot.

      Briggs motions for them to shut up.

                                      FELIX (V.O.)
                    Can you hook me up with eight yards
                    of the indoor? Twenty a yard?

                                      BRIGGS
                    When do you need it?

                                      FELIX (V.O.)
                    Right now, bro. 

                                      BRIGGS
                    No can do, compadre.

      Lauren flashes him a look - What the fuck? Briggs motions
      her to calm down.

                                      FELIX (V.O.)
                    Come on man, you said you could hook
                    me up anytime I needed it. I got
                    people counting on me.

      A long beat. Briggs lets him hang.

                                      BRIGGS
                    I've got a buddy who could bring it
                    down.

                                      FELIX (V.O.)
                    Your amigo, mi amigo!

                                      BRIGGS
                    Your casa. Two hours.

                                      FELIX (V.O.)
                    Orale! See you soon!

      Briggs hangs up, looks at Mike.                                                                                         37.


                                      BRIGGS
                    You're up.


      Briggs driving, Mike in the passenger seat. Tuturro in back
      leaning up between them as they cruise through Hollywood.

                                      BRIGGS
                    This is a simple reverse. You walk
                    in the apartment, make the deal,
                    give us the bust signal. 

      Mike has his notebook out. He's nervous. Writing furiously.

                                    MIKE
                    Okay. So what's my name?

      Briggs and Tuturro swap looks.

                                      BRIGGS
                    Your name's Mike.

                                    MIKE
                    Yeah.

                                      BRIGGS
                    Then go with Mike. 

      Mike writes that down.

                                    MIKE
                    Last name?

                                      BRIGGS
                    Don't give him a last name.

      Mike writes that down. "No last name." Briggs gets annoyed.
      Throws the notebook out the window. 

                                    MIKE
                    What did you do that for?

                                      BRIGGS
                    You can't take a crib sheet with
                    you. Keep it simple. Where are you
                    from?

                                    MIKE
                    Boston.

                                      BRIGGS
                    Then if he asks, you're from Boston.
                    But bad guys don't ask a lot of
                    questions because they don't want
                    you asking a lot of questions. 

      They ride in silence.                                                                                        38.


                                    MIKE
                    What's our legend?

                                      BRIGGS
                    Our what?

                                    MIKE
                    Our backstory. How'd we meet?

                                      BRIGGS
                    Our legend? Is that what they're
                    teaching at Quantico?

                                    MIKE
                    How do we know each other... if he
                    asks?

                                      BRIGGS
                    If he asks just say "around". 

                                      TUTURRO
                    Come on Briggs, make it interesting.
                    Put him in the movie.

                                      BRIGGS
                    No way.

                                    MIKE
                    What movie?

                                      BRIGGS
                    It's nothing.

      Briggs signals for Tuturro to shut the fuck up. Too late,
      Mike turns to him.

                                    MIKE
                    What's the movie?

                                      TUTURRO
                    This is great. So we're on this three
                    month undercover sting of the Colima
                    Cartel. These guys are hard core --
                    shoot you just to see if the gun
                    works. In the middle of this, Briggs
                    gets some freakin' Bureau award, top
                    seizure agent of the century or some
                    thing. CNN sends a camera crew, so
                    for a week they've got his face
                    plastered all over the news.
                          (pauses for dramatic
                            effect)
                    We're meeting with the heads of the
                    family... 

                                                                          FLASH CUT TO:                                                                                        39.


      We're in a hotel room with Briggs, Tuturro, and a third FBI
      agent we don't know standing across from the three heads of
      the Colima cartel. 

                                      TUTURRO (V.O.)
                    They know they've seen Briggs's face,
                    but they can't place him. 

      The men shoot Briggs suspicious glances.

                                      TUTURRO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    They're getting spooked. They're
                    about a second away from waxing us.
                    Then Briggs throws out that he plays
                    a cop in the movies. 

                                      FLASHBACK BRIGGS
                    ... I'm an actor ...

      BACK TO THE CAR

                                    MIKE
                    They believed that?

                                      TUTURRO
                    Hell No! 


      Other Mexicans with M-16's have their gun barrels pressed
      into the necks of Briggs, Tuturro, and the third agent. 

                                      TUTURRO (V.O.)
                    Now we got gun barrels under our
                    chins and Briggs starts talking out
                    of his ass, how he's doing a movie
                    about cops who are undercover as
                    hookers and how the chick he married
                    turns out to be a real hooker, and
                    his sister...

    We see and hear FLASHBACK BRIGGS grinning and saying these
      things:

                                      FLASHBACK BRIGGS
                    ... The best part... she's a real
                    hooker...

      BACK TO CAR

                                    MIKE
                    Wait... you married your sister?

                                      BRIGGS
                    Didn't say it was a good movie.                                                                                        40.


                                      TUTURRO
                    Now this is the best part... They're
                    still not buying it. We're all gonna
                    die... And... you ready for this? 


      Itchy fingers on triggers. Time to start sweating bullets kids...

                                      TUTURRO (V.O.)
                    To prove he's not a cop... Briggs
                    pulls out his badge and throws it
                    down in front of them.

      Briggs drops his FBI shield on the table. 

                                      TUTURRO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    He says it's a prop from the movie. 

      The Mexicans, wary, pass the badge around. Tension, thick
      enough to walk on... a collectively held breath... then...

      The Mexicans begin to LAUGH. So do Briggs, Tuturro and the
      other guy. All laughing their collective asses off...

      BACK TO THE CAR

                                      TUTURRO (CONT'D)
                    They say the prop guy should be fired
                    because it looks like it came out of
                    a cereal box.

                                    MIKE
                    They went through with the buy?

                                      TUTURRO
                    They made the buy. We nailed 'em. To
                    this day one of the jerk-offs still
                    has an autographed picture of Briggs
                    hanging in his cell.

      Tuturro and Briggs chuckle at this.

                                      TUTURRO (CONT'D)
                    Come on Briggs, let him tell Felix
                    you guys met on the movie. Give him
                    a small part. 

                                    MIKE
                    You told Felix this same story?

      Briggs realizes he's busted. He rolls his eyes, annoyed.

                                      BRIGGS
                    Fine. If Felix asks, tell him you
                    play my brother-in-law. But it ain't
                    gonna matter because he ain't gonna
                    ask.                                                                                        41.


                                    MIKE
                    Okay... wait, so I'm married to the
                    hooker?

                                      BRIGGS
                    Why not.


      We're inside an RV parked a few blocks from Felix's apartment.
    An FBI command post has been set up here. It's packed with
      TECHNICIANS, radios, and everything else you'd expect. One
      Technician puts eight kilos of cocaine in a backpack while
      Briggs fits Mike with a transmitter disguised as a pen. 

                                      BRIGGS
                    This pen transmits everything back
                    to us.

                                    MIKE
                    No wires?

                                      BRIGGS
                    Not since Carlito's Way. 
                          (into pen)
                    Sibilance. Sibilance.

      Briggs' voice BOOMS out of the receiver. Mike tucks the pen
      into his shirt pocket.

                                      TECHNICIAN
                    Give me a level. 

                                    MIKE
                          (loudly)
                    PLEASURE DOING BUSINESS WITH YOU.

      The Technician rips off his headphones.

                                      BRIGGS
                    Mike. Talk normal.

                                    MIKE
                          (normal voice)
                    Pleasure doing business with you.

    As he says this, the RV door opens and Silvo enters with a
      pair of SUBORDINATES. 

                                      SILVO
                    I assume that's our bust signal.

                                      BRIGGS
                    Yeah.

                                      SILVO
                    We've got to start hiring writers. 
                                      (MORE)                                                                                        42.


                                      SILVO (CONT'D)
                    So I'm in the middle of breakfast
                    when I get a call from FBI Ops wanting
                    to know why they weren't informed
                    that we were running a reverse on a
                    Vzakonye dealer. I didn't know we
                    had a Vzakonye dealer.

                                      BRIGGS
                    We don't. We pulled him off the sheet
                    a month ago.

                                      SILVO
                    So why are we doing this?

                                      BRIGGS
                    Lauren's idea.

      Silvo chuckles, rubs his eyes tiredly. He turns to Mike.

                                      SILVO
                    Mike Warren. Gerry Silvo. I'm your GS.

                                    MIKE
                    It's a pleasure, sir.

                                      SILVO
                    Yeah, let me know how long that lasts.
                          (checks watch)
                    It's almost noon. Has Briggs' taught
                    you everything he knows yet?

                                    MIKE
                    Yes sir. Wax on, wax off.

                                      SILVO
                    I'll assume that's an in-joke. I
                    don't like in-jokes.

                                    MIKE
                    Yes sir.

      Silvo grabs the personal history sheet on Felix.

                                      SILVO
                    Let's see... Felix Londono... he's
                    got a family so he's not likely to
                    rip you. He won't shoot with his
                    wife and kids in there... Should be
                    easy. Remember, we arrest you too,
                    so make it look good in case his
                    buddies are watching. You nervous?

                                    MIKE
                    Yes sir.

                                      SILVO
                    Good. Let's do this.                                                                                        43.


      Felix's wife, an attractive Russian woman, IRINA, brings
      them some lemonade. Alex is playing with his sister, SOPHIA,
    in the other room.

                                      FELIX
                    So you and Paul are friends, huh?

                                    MIKE
                    Yeah. I met him, you know, around.

                                      FELIX
                    Yeah. Around.

      The men are both jumpy. In a slight panic, Mike plunges ahead:

                                    MIKE
                    Yeah. I mean, he's my brother-in-
                    law. 
                          (then)
                    He married my sister. 
                          (then)
                    She's a hooker.

      Everyone is hearing this. Silvo throws a look at Briggs.

                                      TUTURRO
                    Twenty bucks says he shows them his
                    badge.

      BACK TO FELIX'S APARTMENT - SAME TIME

      Felix and his wife are staring at Mike.                                                                                        44.


                                    MIKE
                    In the movie. I mean I play his
                      brother-in-law in the movie.

                                      IRINA
                    You're in the show with Paul?

                                    MIKE
                          (huge relief)
                    Yes. 

                                      FELIX
                    Ohhh... I was gonna say, my family
                    is kinda messed up, but yours...
                    est  loco.

                                      IRINA
                    Do you also play a cop?

                                    MIKE
                    Yeah. 
                          (then)
                    Manos Ariba!

      Felix and his wife LAUGH, raise their hands.

                                      FELIX
                    Hey honey, would you mind giving me
                    and Mike a minute.

    He motions for her to join the kids. 

                                      IRINA
                    Of course.

    He takes a deep breath...

                                    MIKE
                    So...

                                      FELIX
                    So. 
                          (a beat)
                    Here's the thing. You know how stuff
                    gets stacked up? This guy doesn't
                    show up, so now you can't pay that
                    guy...

      BACK TO THE RV COMMAND POST - SAME TIME

      A group sigh passes through the RV.

                                      TUTURRO
                    He doesn't have the money.

                                      SILVO
                    Dammit. People, looks like we just
                    wasted a morning.                                                                                         45.


      Silvo drops his headset. A few of the techs start packing
      equipment.

      BACK TO FELIX'S APARTMENT - SAME TIME

                                    MIKE
                    You're short?

                                      FELIX
                    No... I wish I was short. I'm out.
                    The economy, you know? My other guy
                    didn't show up for his stuff.

      Mike knows this thing is going south... but he's not going
    to lose it... not his first one... 

                                    MIKE
                    What was this other guy buying?

      BACK TO THE RV COMMAND POST - SAME TIME

      This freezes Briggs.

                                      BRIGGS
                    Hang on, I think the kid's trying to
                    save it.

      BACK TO FELIX'S APARTMENT - SAME TIME

      Felix is looking at Mike, grinning.

                                      FELIX
                    You're saying that maybe you'd be
                    interested in some merchandise in
                    exchange for the indoor?

                                    MIKE
                    Possibly. What are we talking about?

                                      FELIX
                    It's good quality. Come check it
                    out. It's in the alley out back.

      BACK TO THE RV COMMAND POST - SAME TIME

      Silvo is glaring at Briggs.

                                      SILVO
                    You told him not to change locations,
                    right?

      Briggs raises an eyebrow, looks hopefully at the radio...

                                    MIKE (V.O.)
                    Sure. Let's go.

                                      BRIGGS
                    Nope.                                                                                        46.


                                      SILVO
                    Goddammit! 

      Briggs keys the hand mike:

                                      BRIGGS
                    I need somebody on that alley, now!


      Mike is in his FBI jacket as other agents slap his back and
      offer congratulations. Briggs and Tuturro are there, finishing
    up paperwork.

      A pair of COPS turn the corner as they lead Felix toward a
      waiting interrogation room. All conversation in the room
      stops.

                                      SILVO
                    What the hell are you idiots doing?
                    You're not supposed to bring him
                    through here!

      The cops immediately realize their mistake, but it's too
      late. Felix's face drops as he sees Mike in the FBI jacket. 

                                      FELIX
                    Man, that's cold.

                                      BRIGGS
                    Get him out of here. Take him around
                    the other way.

      The cops scramble to take Felix back the way he came.

                                      FELIX
                    Hold on!

      The cops stop. Felix turns back to Mike. 

                                      FELIX (CONT'D)
                    Tell my wife I screwed up again,
                    okay? Tell her I'm sorry.                                                                                        49.


      The look in Felix's eyes is so beseeching that Mike can do
      anything but nod.

                                    MIKE
                    I will.

      The cops take Felix away, leaving the agents in uncomfortable
      silence.

                                      TUTURRO
                    That wasn't supposed to happen.

      Briggs slaps Mike on the back.

                                      BRIGGS
                    It happened. It's over.

      Mike forces a smile as we...


    An impeccably dressed man enters the reception area. He is
      Russian. A lawyer. The Sanitate suit, the Dominic loafers...
      this guy is no public defender. This is SERGEI NAYFELD. 


      A night-duty COP comes over to the bars.

                                    COP
                    Londono, your lawyer's here.

    We see confusion on Felix's face as he gets up.                                                                                        52.


      The Cop leads Felix in. Felix spots Nayfeld in the waiting
      area. His face drops. He presses himself against the wall
      before Nayfeld can see him. A violent whisper to the cop:

                                      FELIX
                    That man is not my lawyer. Whatever
                    happens, do not let him bail me out. 


      The tequila has loosened everyone up. Charlie is dancing
      with Tuturro now. Briggs is laid out on the bar in a mild
      alcoholic daze. Mike is on the couch, perfecting his tequila
      shot technique. Charlie motions Mike toward her.

                                      CHARLIE
                    Come here Levi.

      Mike looks. Yeah, she's talking to him. She goes over, pulling
      him up. Come on you pussy, dance with me. Mike gives in. She
      puts his arms on her shoulders. Mike shoots a look at Briggs
      who doesn't seem at all concerned.

                                    MIKE
                    Levi?

                                      CHARLIE
                    Yeah, you need a nickname.

                                    MIKE
                    I don't think I like Levi.

                                      CHARLIE
                    Too bad. You don't get to choose
                    your nickname. Do you Johnny?

                                    MIKE
                    "Johnny" is a nickname?

                                      CHARLIE
                    Yeah, tell him.

                                      TUTURRO
                    No way.

                                      BRIGGS
                    You tell it or I'm gonna tell it.

      Tuturro drops down on the couch. Mike turns to listen to
      Briggs, but he doesn't let go of Charlie.

                                      BRIGGS (CONT'D)
                    Alright. It's Tuturro's final
                    practical at Quantico. Brain trust
                    here...

                                      CHARLIE
                    Formally known as Joe Tuturro.                                                                                        53.


                                      BRIGGS
                    Brain trust Tuturro shoots Tony
                    Marselo twice in the chest while
                    he's sitting on the john.

                                    MIKE
                    Marselo? As in Deputy Director
                    Marselo? 

                                      TUTURRO
                    You're gonna tell it, tell the whole
                    thing. This is three years ago. We're
                    doing the final at a real house in
                    Virginia. I'm looking for the
                      suspect.... 

                                                                          FLASH CUT TO:


      Tuturro - in an FBI training shirt, gun out, nervous as hell.
      (Trust me, this one's going to pay off too. Just wait...)

                                      TUTURRO (V.O.)
                    They didn't tell me that the upstairs
                    was off limits. I opened the bathroom
                    door. The guy surprised me.

      Tuturro kicks open the bathroom door. His face flashes pure
      panic. He UNLOADS his weapon... 

                                      TUTURRO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    I shot him.

      Tuturro, eyes glazed over, in full-auto-panic mode now, still
      firing... SHOT after SHOT after SHOT...

                                      BRIGGS (V.O.)
                    Not only that, Cool Hand Luke here
                    fires off his full clip...

      ANGLE ON: AN OLDER MAN, MARSELO.

      Sitting on the toilet, pants around his ankles, reading a
      newspaper and glaring at Tuturro like he could melt lead. The
      bathroom walls look as if they've been attacked by some crazed
      Jackson Pollock wannabee -- red paint splattered everywhere.

                                      BRIGGS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    ... But only hits the guy twice. 

      Despite all the mayhem, there are only two small red paint

      Briggs and Charlie are losing it, laughing like crazy.                                                                                        54.


                                      CHARLIE
                    Eight paint balls right over his
                    wife's new French Vanilla wallpaper.
                    They wouldn't let him graduate until
                    he repainted.

      Now even Tuturro is laughing. And so is Mike... he's becoming
      one of them.


      A small room, fluorescent-lighted. A cop leads Felix in.
      NAYFELD, the lawyer, is already there. His English is East
      Coast. Only a hint of his original Slovak accent remains.

                                      NAYFELD
                    Thank you officers. I only have a
                    brief message to deliver.

      The cop throws a last look back at Felix, shuts the door. 

                                      FELIX
                    I didn't know I could afford a lawyer.
                    Especially one with such a nice suit. 

      Felix is grinning. Nayfeld isn't.

                                      NAYFELD
                    The police tell me you are a third
                    striker and I cannot bail you out.

                                      FELIX
                    Yeah, stolen jeans. It's crazy. What
                    are you gonna do? 

                                      NAYFELD
                    This is unfortunate. You understand
                    that the Vzakonye need assurance
                    that you will not talk to the feds.

                                      FELIX
                    I'm not tellin' these narcs nothing.

                                      NAYFELD
                    Just the same, your family will be
                    staying with us for awhile.

      Felix goes white.

                                      FELIX
                    Please, swear to god, I'll do
                    anything. 

                                      NAYFELD
                    Why don't you start by telling me
                    the truth?
                                      (MORE)                                                                                        55.


                                      NAYFELD (CONT'D)
                          (leans in)
                    What's this crap with the jeans? We
                    don't take care of you?
                          (off Felix's shocked
                          look)
                    We had a guy sitting on your
                    apartment. We saw the bust.

      Felix fidgets. Nayfeld presses him.

                                      NAYFELD (CONT'D)
                    Who was this guy they pinched you
                    with?

      Felix thinks. What's he going to say, that Mike is an FBI
      agent? No way. In a panic, he throws out the first thing
      that pops into his head:

                                      FELIX
                    He's my brother-in-law. 

      Nayfeld considers this.

                                      NAYFELD
                    He's family?

      Felix nods. A cunning grin spreads across the lawyer's face.
      Suddenly, he is very, very interested.


      Jakes walks in, takes in the party.

                                      JAKES
                    What are we celebrating?

                                      BRIGGS
                    Levi popped his cherry.

                                      JAKES
                    Levi?

      Briggs slides the tequila bottle the length of the bar. Jakes
      catches it, sits. 

      Mike pries himself away from Charlie, goes over to Jakes who
    is pouring the tequila over ice.

                                      JAKES (CONT'D)
                          (mockingly)
                    Hey Levi.

                                    MIKE
                    Sorry again about the cereal... and
                    the orange juice... And the milk.
                    Buy you a beer?

      Mike pulls out a beer. Jakes holds up his glass.                                                                                        56.


                                      JAKES
                    I'm good.

      Mike takes a marker, writes "DJ" on the beer bottle.

                                    MIKE
                    Later then.

      Jakes's can see that Mike is being genuine. He's on the fence
    on this one. He tips it toward Mike in a small toast. Then...
      the MUSIC STOPS. Silvo has killed the stereo.

                                      SILVO
                    Gee, Silvo turned off the music. He
                    must have something important to
                    say. Let's start with the good news.
                    That semitrailer full of jeans got
                    lifted off the port. That makes them
                    Customs' problem, not mine.

    He tosses a set of keys to Jakes. 

                                      SILVO (CONT'D)
                    You're now the proud owner of Twelve-
                    thousand knock-off Levis courtesy of
                    your new buddy Mike.

      Jakes slams the beer down, exits. So much for Mike's reprieve. 

                                      SILVO (CONT'D)
                    Now the bad news...
                          (points at Mike)
                    ... You just made bail.


      Briggs, Charlie, Tuturro and Mike have sobered up fast. They
      walk briskly in from the rear entrance along with Silvo and
      a few other FBI STAFFERS and TECHNICIANS.

                                      BRIGGS
                    Are we sure they've got his family?

                                      SILVO
                    Local PD found evidence of forced
                    entry into the apartment, signs of a
                    struggle, so yeah, they've got his
                    family. Apparently your boy Felix
                    was a lot deeper into the Vzakonye
                    than we thought. They sent Nayfeld
                    to bail him out.

      Briggs lets out a soft whistle. 

                                      BRIGGS
                    Nayfeld. The big leagues.                                                                                        57.


                                      SILVO
                    Yeah. Felix was smart enough to dodge
                    that bullet but he panicked when
                    Nayfeld asked about Mike. Said he
                    was his brother-in-law. 
                          (a beat)
                    Said he got the idea from a movie. 

      Silvo throws a look at Briggs, who, in turn, glares at Tuturro.

                                      SILVO (CONT'D)
                    But we got lucky. Felix does have a
                      brother-in-law who bears a passing
                      resemblance to Mike. By that I mean
                    he's white.
                          (looks at Mike)
                    We've got to do something about your
                    eye color and height. And if it comes
                    up, you lost a hell of a lot of
                    weight.

      Briggs sees that Mike is freaking out, overwhelmed by all of
      this. Briggs yells at everyone:

                                      BRIGGS
                    I need two minutes. Mike, get in
                    here.

      Briggs pulls Mike into an empty office, shuts the door. 


      Mike takes a seat, doing his best to stay calm.

                                      BRIGGS
                    How's your first day going so far?

                                    MIKE
                    Great. Cleaned some dishes, learned
                    to surf. 

      Briggs grins. He genuinely likes this kid. 

                                    MIKE (CONT'D)
                    So what's going to happen?

                                      BRIGGS
                    Kidnapping a wife and kids is messy...
                    They're bailing you out because they
                    want some assurance that Felix won't
                    talk. They think you're family. They
                    get you to do something illegal.
                    Felix talks to us, they turn you in.

                                    MIKE
                    Illegal?

      Briggs -- a long exhale. No easy way to say this.                                                                                        58.


                                      BRIGGS
                    They're gonna want you to kill
                    somebody. 

      Mike takes a second to digest that. He nods.

                                      BRIGGS (CONT'D)
                    They'll give you a name. You come
                    back to us and that's it. We've got
                    a guy at the Times who will play
                    ball with a homicide story and an
                    obit. They think the guy's dead,
                    they let the family go. 

      Mike nods, absorbing this.

                                      BRIGGS (CONT'D)
                    We send you in there unarmed. You'll
                    have a transmitter, but that's all.
                    These guys are good at spotting tails
                    so you're on your own. 
                          (then)
                    You don't have to do this.

                                    MIKE
                    If I don't, what happens to the
                    family?

      Briggs just shakes his head. Mike considers a long moment. 


      Briggs walks out with Mike, nods to Silvo. Silvo starts
      walking rapidly, everyone else follows.

                                      SILVO
                    Alright, we've gotta assume these
                    Russian pricks have the same intel
                    we do. Mike, you've got one hour to
                    become this guy.

      Silvo pulls out a file, reads.

                                      SILVO (CONT'D)
                    Your name is Frankie Bout. Got that?

                                    MIKE
                    Frankie Bout.

                                      SILVO
                    Your wife's name is Laurenrina. Like
                    the Laurenr. She's Felix' wife's
                    sister. Her name is Irina. 

                                    MIKE
                    Wait, Laurenrina is my wife or Felix'?                                                                                        59.


                                      SILVO
                    Yours. 

      Briggs grabs a pen and pad off a desk.

                                      BRIGGS
                    Write it down!

      Mike starts writing as Silvo continues.

                                      SILVO
                    You ever been to Chicago?

                                    MIKE
                    I drove up in college once.

                                      SILVO
                    Well, now you're born there.

      Mike continues writing as they walk...


      Everything is happening fast. Technicians checking equipment.
      Rapid radio chatter like white noise in the background...
      Silvo, on a hand-held, coordinating everything.

      Briggs has the file now, firing questions at Mike. Mike,
      doing his best to stay off his cheat-sheet...

                                      BRIGGS
                    Arrest in oh-four?

                                    MIKE
                    Uh... GTA. I boosted a Firebird.

                                      BRIGGS
                    Good. Your wife?

                                    MIKE
                      Laurenrina. A year younger than me.

                                      BRIGGS
                    Kids?

                                    MIKE
                    Nope.

                                      BRIGGS
                    Your name?

      Mike freezes... he can't remember... 

                                    MIKE
                    Dammit... 
                          (peeks at his sheet)
                    Frankie Bout. Dammit, I know that.                                                                                        60.


                                      BRIGGS
                    It's okay. 

      Briggs, rubs his eyes, just as frustrated. He flips a page
    in the file.

                                      BRIGGS (CONT'D)
                    Wait a minute... January of this
                    year... suspicion narco possession...
                    arresting officer noted TRACK MARKS!
                    This guy's a junky?

      Briggs explodes. Everyone in the room freezes.

                                      BRIGGS (CONT'D)
                    Why didn't we know this twenty minutes
                    ago? Charlie, get in here.

      Charlie steps forward, pulling out her makeup kit.

                                      CHARLIE
                    When's the last time he could have
                    had a hit?

                                      BRIGGS
                    Eleven thirty.

      Charlie nods, does quick math in her head. She takes Mike's
      left hand, starts painting track marks on his wrist. 

                                      CHARLIE
                    You shoot up here because your watch
                    will cover these up. You haven't had
                    a hit in fourteen hours. You're in
                    withdrawal so you're going to be
                    shaky. 

      Mike holds up his other hand. It's shaking on its own. She
      smiles. 

                                      CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                    See? You're a natural. 

      OVER THIS: an FBI TECHNICIAN arrives. 

                                      TECHNICIAN
                    I've got a pair of ten-and-a-half
                    boots with a three-inch lift? 

      Silvo nods. The technician drops the boots, pulls out a few
      more items that Silvo grabs.

                                      SILVO
                    I've got blue contacts and a wallet
                    for one Frankie Bout. We've got the
                    usual - Visa, Starbucks card, Triple-
                    A --                                                                                        61.


      Silvo signs for the items, tosses the wallet to Briggs. Briggs
      flips through it, quickly throws out a few cards.

                                      BRIGGS
                    This guy does not have a gold AMEX.
                    He sure as hell doesn't have a library
                    card.

      Briggs looks disapprovingly at the shiny leather wallet.
      Turns to Tuturro.

                                      BRIGGS (CONT'D)
                    This thing is brand new. Johnny, go
                    rub it in the sand.

      Tuturro starts to complain. Briggs' look shuts him up. Briggs
      flips him the wallet and Tuturro heads outside.

      Another technician hands Briggs a sports watch.

                                      TECHNICIAN
                    This is your transmitter. 

                                      BRIGGS
                    We can hear you. You can't hear us.

      Briggs demonstrates on the watch:

                                      BRIGGS (CONT'D)
                    If they sweep you, press this button.
                    It cuts your transmission. Press it
                    again to restart.

                                      CHARLIE
                    That's new.

                                    TECH GUY
                    Yeah, we added it after that DEA guy
                    got shot last week.

      All the agents share a look at the mention of Donnie. Mike
      swallows hard. This doesn't make him feel any better. 

      Charlie looks at Mike, he's starting to drown under all this.
      Briggs is messing with the contact lens case. Charlie takes
    it from him. Leans in to Mike, very close.

                                      CHARLIE
                    Mike. Look at me.

    He stares into her eyes. Ever so delicately she puts the
      first contact in his eye. She talks softly as she does:

                                      CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                    Felix came to you tonight and said
                    "they took my kids, they took my
                    wife. You've got to help me."                                                                                         62.


      Now the second contact. She's very close now. Faces nearly
      touching...

                                      CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                    And they're gonna want you to do
                    something bad. Okay? Really bad. But
                    you can do it. 

      Mike is lost in her now. Everything else, all the chaos,
      seems to fade away. The contacts in, she smiles at him.

                                      CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                    You look good with blue eyes. 

      Now it's his turn to grin... and with that... Tuturro re-
      enters, bringing the chaos back with him. He's got the wallet,
      now thoroughly scuffed. Briggs looks at it, annoyed.

                                      BRIGGS
                    He carries this thing in his pocket.
                    He doesn't drag it behind his car.

                                      TUTURRO
                    It's dark out there...

      Charlie ignores the interruptions. Her eyes locked on Mike's.
      Deep enough, gentle enough to drown him. 

                                      CHARLIE
                    What's your name? 

                                    MIKE
                    Frankie Bout.

      Charlie gives him a wink. He smiles.

                                    MIKE (CONT'D)
                    Let's do this.

      And with that he's up, moving toward the door...


      A COP leads Mike out, hands cuffed behind his back. Nayfeld
    is waiting. The Cop un-cuffs him as the DESK GUARD pulls out
      a personal effects envelope. 

                                    DESK GUARD
                    Bout, Frankie.

      Mike takes the envelope.

                                    DESK GUARD (CONT'D)
                    Sign.

      Mike signs for the envelope. He dumps the contents onto the
      desk: The sports watch. The wallet.                                                                                        63.


      Mike puts on the watch -- Nayfeld not failing to notice the
      track marks it covers up. Mike picks up the wallet. Some
      sand falls out of it. Nayfeld gives him a look.

                                    MIKE
                    Do you surf? 

      Nayfeld shakes his head.

                                    MIKE (CONT'D)
                    You should. It kicks ass.


      The Driver passes Nayfeld an electronic wand - a piece of
      cold-war technology that detects transmitters. 

                                      NAYFELD
                    Mister Bout, raise your arms please.

      Mike covertly presses the button on his watch, then holds
      his arms out to the side.


                                    TECH GUY
                    He just stopped transmitting.

      Dead silence in the room. Pin-drop quiet. An incredibly long
      beat. These are people used to being in control. They are
      frustrated. Helpless. All they can do is wait. Then... a
      faint CRACKLE as the watch begins transmitting again.

                                    TECH GUY (CONT'D)
                    Okay, we got him back.

                                      NAYFELD (V.O.)
                    ... Thank you, Mr. Bout. Do you speak
                    Russian?

                                    MIKE (V.O.)
                    That's my wife. The only thing I
                    understand in Russian is "Not
                    tonight."

      Nayfeld and the Driver laugh. Silvo nods approvingly.

                                      SILVO
                    Good boy.

                                    TECH GUY
                    Okay, they're moving.                                                                                        64.


                                      SILVO
                    Alright. I want air units standing
                    by if we have to go mobile. 

      Lauren enters, Silvo sees her. And he knows that look on her
      face. He doesn't have patience. Not now. 

                                      LAUREN
                    I'm going in on this.

                                      SILVO
                    No you're not. Get her out of here!

      A pair of FBI agents come forward. Lauren stands her ground.

                                      LAUREN
                    I've still got my cover. 

                                      SILVO
                    I don't care.

                                      LAUREN
                    I can go over your head.

      Her eyes, like cold steel. Full of rage and pain. 

                                      SILVO
                    Yeah, you could, but I don't want an
                    agent out there looking for revenge,
                    and neither does your boss.

      A beat. She knows he's right. She seems to wither a little.
      She lets the men lead her toward the exit.

                                      SILVO (CONT'D)
                    Wait.

      The men stop.

                                      SILVO (CONT'D)
                    You can stay here.

      He's offering her this. He doesn't have to. She nods. She
      comes over to Silvo. He takes her hand. She holds it.


      A dimly-lit office. Shabby elegance. From an inner doorway a
      large, rugged man watches as Nayfeld leads Mike in. This is
      SEMION MOGILEVICH and he is a very powerful man.                                                                                         65.


      With him are the YAPONCHIK brothers, LUDWIG and BENJAMIN.
      Ludwig is the brains, Benjamin the muscle. (The following
      BOLD text is in Russian, subtitled:)

                                      MOGILEVICH
                    What do we know about him?

      Ludwig studies a file.

                                      LUDWIG
                    Petty theft convictions. Some stolen
                    cars. He may have a heroin addiction.

      Mogilevich frowns. This isn't going to work. He and the
      brothers enter. Mogilevich flashes a Chesire grin.

                                      MOGILEVICH
                    Frankie, right? Have a seat.

      Mike sits. He's shaking. This isn't lost on Mogilevich.

                                    MIKE
                    How are Irina and the kids?

                                      MOGILEVICH
                    They're doing better than you. You
                    need something? Coffee? Water?

                                    MIKE
                    No. I'm fine.

                                      MOGILEVICH
                    Benjamin, bring him some water.

      Benjamin disappears. Mogilevich flips through the file. Looks
    at Mike critically. 

                                      MOGILEVICH (CONT'D)
                    You drop a few pounds recently?

                                    MIKE
                    Yeah. South Beach. You should try
                    it.

                                      MOGILEVICH
                    Is that the one where you skip the
                    carbs and shoot up on smack? 

      Nothing from Mike. Mogilevich's eyes shift to Nayfeld. He
      nods. He's seen the track marks. Benjamin reappears with a
      glass of water, sets it in front of Mike.

                                    MIKE
                    Can we get on with this?

                                      MOGILEVICH
                    You're right. This is business. The
                    wife and kids staying with us. 
                                      (MORE)                                                                                        66.


                                      MOGILEVICH (CONT'D)
                    You know how it is with family. It's
                    a pain in the ass.

                                    MIKE
                    What do you want me to do?

      Mogilevich stares at him. A long beat. Mike is shaking. Badly.
    He reaches for the water, knocks the cup over, sending all
      the men standing, cursing in Russian.

                                      MOGILEVICH
                    Forget it. Get this guy out of here.

      Mogilevich walks away. Mike yells after him.

                                    MIKE
                    Wait! Whatever you want me to do, I
                    can do it.

                                      MOGILEVICH
                    No you can't. You're a goddamn hype.
                    I don't want you screwing up and
                    blowing this back in my face.

                                    MIKE
                    You want me to kill a guy? I've done
                    it before.

      This pauses Mogilevich. He turns back, laughs.

                                      MOGILEVICH
                    You? You whacked somebody?

                                    MIKE
                    Yes.


      Everybody here is frozen too. Complete and utter shock.

                                      SILVO
                    Where's he going with this?

                                      BRIGGS
                    I wish I knew.

      From over the transmitter:

                                      MOGILEVICH (V.O.)
                    Who'd you kill?

                                    MIKE (V.O.)
                    Are you recording this?

      BACK TO THE RESTAURANT

      Mogilevich is grinning.                                                                                        67.


                                      MOGILEVICH
                    Whether I'm recording this is the
                    least of your problems.
                          (a beat; he sits)
                    Now, I want you to think very
                    carefully about what you're going to
                    say to me, Frankie. I've got friends
                    in law enforcement. I can check
                    details, case files. If you're lying,
                    I'm going to know about it.

      BACK TO THE COMMAND POST

      Silvo's face is ashen.

                                      SILVO
                    Christ, they're gonna check this.

      BACK TO THE RESTAURANT

      Mike's mind racing... near panic. They're all staring at
      him. Mogilevich waiting.

                                    MIKE
                    Alright... I shot a guy while he was
                    sitting on the toilet.

      The mobsters laugh.

      BACK TO THE COMMAND POST

      Silvo is in a panic. Briggs is suddenly grinning. 

                                      BRIGGS
                    Nice, Mikey. Nice.

                                      SILVO
                    What's nice? Kid's gonna get himself
                    killed.

      Briggs isn't listening. He drags Tuturro over to a Tech guy.

                                      BRIGGS
                    I need a cold case report entered
                    into N.C.I.C.

      Tech Guy starts typing.

                                      BRIGGS (CONT'D)
                    This is gonna be an unsolved homicide,
                    in Virginia.... 2007. Johnny, give
                    him every detail.

                                      TUTURRO
                    He's ripping off my story!

                                      BRIGGS
                    I know. Start talking.                                                                                        68.


                                      TUTURRO
                    Okay, the guy's name was Marselo...

      Tuturro continues as we hear OVER THE TRANSMITTER:

                                      MOGILEVICH (V.O.)
                    Where did this go down?

                                    MIKE (V.O.)
                    Virginia. This was back in oh-seven.

      Silvo looks at Briggs like he just grew a third head.

                                      SILVO
                    You a mind reader now? Somebody want
                    to clue me in?

      Briggs and Charlie are both grinning like crazy.

                                      CHARLIE
                    Yeah chief, your new kid is pretty
                    smart.


      Mike is telling the story. Embellishing, trying to buy as
      much time as possible. Benjamin, especially, is listening,
      actually enjoying himself.

                                    MIKE (V.O.)
                    ... I see him grab a couple of
                    magazines, he goes into the john.
                    He's a big guy so I figure he's gonna
                    be in there awhile. I give him a
                    couple of minutes to get settled.
                    Then I kick in the door. Bam! Pop
                    him right through the chest.

      The Mobsters laugh. Even Mogilevich is grinning. He motions
    to Nayfeld who moves into a back room, picks up a phone.

                                      BENJAMIN
                    Who's gonna fight with their pants
                    around their ankles?

      ANGLE ON: NAYFELD

    He dials. A beat, then into the phone:

                                      NAYFELD
                    I need a check on the national
                    database. Unsolved homicide back in
                    2007...


      Silvo has been clued in. He, along with everybody else, is
      gathered around Tuturro and the Tech Guy, who is typing like
      a madman.                                                                                        69.


                                    TECH GUY
                    How am I supposed to write up "shot
                    on the crapper?"

                                      SILVO
                    Body found in upstairs bathroom.
                    Partially clothed.

      Tech Guy finishing typing.

                                    TECH GUY
                    Okay. That's it.

                                      BRIGGS
                    Submit it.

      More rapid keystrokes. Tech guy stops, looks confused.

                                    TECH GUY
                    They've got some kind of encryption
                    block on the N.C.I.C. server...

      Another tech guy slides in next to him.

                                    TECH GUY #2
                    Just bypass their firewall.

                                      SILVO
                    Get the goddamn thing in there!


      Nayfeld on the phone, waiting... everyone else tense.
      Mogilevich making small talk, throwing looks at Nayfeld who
      shrugs; nothing yet.

      A long beat... then Nayfeld cups the phone, yells in to
      Mogilevich.

                                      NAYFELD
                    Virginia homicide shows they found
                    this Marselo guy dead on his toilet. 

      Mogilevich looks at Mike, impressed. 

                                      MOGILEVICH
                    So you whacked a guy. 

    He slaps Mike's face in mock affection.

                                      MOGILEVICH (CONT'D)
                    You high right now?

                                    MIKE
                    I've been in lock-up fourteen hours.

      Mogilevich stares into his eyes. They seem clear enough.                                                                                        70.


                                      MOGILEVICH
                    Alright. You help us out, we let the
                    woman and the kids go.

                                    MIKE
                    You gonna give me a name?

                                      MOGILEVICH
                    A pro like you... let's make it a
                    surprise.

      Mogilevich motions to Ludwig and Benjamin who stand. 

                                    MIKE
                    We're doing this now?

                                    TONY
                    You got to be somewhere?

      Mogilevich nods and Ludwig and Benjamin lead Mike out.


      Silvo, Briggs, everybody is dripping sweat. And now this.
      Silvo slams his headphones down on the control panel. 


      Benjamin is driving. Mike is in the passenger seat. Ludwig
    is seated directly behind him.

                                      LUDWIG
                    That is the house.

    He points across the street to a nice, suburban home. As he
      looks, Mike also notes the address: 502 -- the street name
    on the corner: WORTHINGTON DRIVE.

      Benjamin, who is wearing driving gloves, hands Mike a key
      and a slip of paper with a number written on it.

                                      LUDWIG (CONT'D)
                    Open the front door. To your left
                    will be a security keypad. Enter
                    this code.

                                    MIKE
                    How did you get this stuff?

                                      LUDWIG
                    He has a Russian housekeeper. Go up
                    the stairs. The door at the end of
                    the hallway is a bedroom. 
                                      (MORE)                                                                                        71.


                                      LUDWIG (CONT'D)
                    There will be a man and woman in
                    bed. Kill them both. Be sure the man
                    is dead. If we find out later that
                    he is not, we will kill your nephew.

                                    MIKE
                    And when you find out that he is?

                                      LUDWIG
                    The family will be released.

      Ludwig pulls out a .38 special wrapped in a towel. He wipes
    it down carefully, holds it out by the barrel. Mike takes it
    by the handle. The only prints on the gun are now his.

                                      LUDWIG (CONT'D)
                    Bring this back to us.

      Mike steps out of the car... heart pounding... as he walks
    to the house he whispers the address into his watch.

                                    MIKE
                      Five-oh-two Worthington Drive...


      The Tech Guy, hearing this, fingers flying over keys...

                                    TECH GUY
                    I've got a Worthington Drive in Santa
                    Monica. Five-oh-two. Residence.
                    Belonging to a Peter J. Caldwell.

                                      SILVO
                    What!

      That freezes about half the room.

                                      SILVO (CONT'D)
                    Caldwell is West Coast director of
                    operations for the DEA.

      Lauren comes forward.

                                      LAUREN
                    He's my boss.

                                      SILVO
                    Lauren, get your field division on
                    the line. I need Peter's home number
                    now. 

      Lauren grabs the handset and starts waking people up.

                                      TUTURRO
                    Mike's not really gonna shoot him,
                    right?                                                                                        72.


      Silvo gives him a look.

                                      SILVO
                    God, I'm glad you're not the one in
                    there.
                          (to Briggs)
                    What would you do if you were Caldwell
                    and some kid breaks into your house
                    with a gun? 

                                      BRIGGS
                    Kill him.


      Mike enters quietly with the key. The security keypad is
      exactly where they said. He enters the code. Crosses the
      entrance hall. 

    He passes photos, we can assume, of Peter Caldwell. Mike
      doesn't notice them, but we do. Photos of Caldwell as a young
      Marine with an M-16... Caldwell as a young DEA agent with a
      sub-machine gun... Pictures that tell the same story: Peter
      Caldwell didn't rise up behind a desk. This guy is a
      operational player...

      And Peter Caldwell likes to shoot things. 


      Lauren is screaming into the radio. She is talking to a DEA
      night-watch commander.

                                      NIGHT-WATCH COMMANDER (V.O.)
                    I'm sorry ma'am, that information is
                      restricted.

                                      LAUREN
                    Listen to me you brain dead
                      troglodyte... A murder is about to
                    go down at this residence. We need
                    to warn him -- and that him happens
                    to be your commanding officer -- So
                    deliver that number now or you can
                    make the call to his widow!

      A beat -- then.

                                      NIGHTWATCH COMMANDER (V.O.)
                    I'll connect you.

      Silvo and Briggs share a look.

                                      SILVO
                      Troglodyte?

      Briggs shrugs. He's not asking.                                                                                        73.


      The doorknob turns and Mike silently enters the room. There
    is a couple in bed. PETER CALDWELL and his wife, JANET. 

      Suddenly... The PHONE begins to RING. The couple startles
      awake. The woman sees Mike first, starts to scream. He covers
      her mouth, points the gun at Caldwell who's arm is dangling
      off the bed... out of sight...

                                    MIKE
                    Be quiet. I'm not here to hurt you.
                    I'm a Federal Agent. 

                                      CALDWELL
                    If that's true then put the gun down.

      The phone RINGS again, shifting Mike's concentration... 

      And Caldwell's hand, moving another inch... and now we see
      what for: The nightstand drawer is cracked open. A gun handle
    is visible -- a .38 police special in its shoulder holster.
      And Caldwell's hand... creeping...

                                    MIKE
                    I know this seems crazy, but I promise
                    this will make sense in the morning.

      The PHONE again. And Mike... he can't take it. He rips the
      cord out of the wall. Janet jumps. But not Caldwell. His
      eyes are fixed on Mike. Eyes like a snake.

      Then Mike notices a picture on the wall of Caldwell receiving
    an award from President Reagan in front of the DEA shield.
    It takes him about a half-second to process this.

                                    MIKE (CONT'D)
                    Oh God. You're DEA.

                                      CALDWELL
                    That's right son. 

      Mike is really losing it now. His eyes shift back to the
      picture...

      Caldwell sees his chance. He lunges... in a split second he
      has his gun cocked and trained dead level on Mike... and
      Mike, stepping back, all this happening too fast... the men
      screaming at each other:

                                      CALDWELL (CONT'D)
                    LOWER YOUR WEAPON!

                                    MIKE
                    I CAN'T!

                                      CALDWELL
                    DROP THE GUN OR I WILL FIRE!                                                                                        74.


      Mike's gun wavers. Caldwell's is rock solid. If you had to
      put your money on somebody in this scene, it wouldn't be
      Mike.

                                    MIKE
                    The Vzakonye -- the same cartel who
                    shot Donnie Martinez -- they're
                    outside your house now. They sent me
                    here to kill you. 

      Caldwell's gaze on him. Predatory. Waiting for Mike's
      concentration to slip for just an instant...

                                    MIKE (CONT'D)
                    I can't have you coming after me or
                    turning on a light or looking out a
                    window. When I leave they have to
                    think you're dead.

                                      CALDWELL
                    Who are you with?

                                    MIKE
                    The Bureau, sir.

                                      CALDWELL
                    Who's your supervisor?

                                    MIKE
                    Paul Briggs... no, I mean... Silvo.
                    Agent Silvo.

                                      CALDWELL
                    Let me see some I.D.

                                    MIKE
                    I don't have any.

      Mike knows he's screwed. Then... sudden inspiration. He pulls
    up the watch band with his teeth, wipes off the needle marks. 

                                    MIKE (CONT'D)
                    Look. These are fake track marks.
                    I'm undercover.

      Nothing from Caldwell. Does he believe him? No way to tell.
      Mike looks at the wife.

                                    MIKE (CONT'D)
                    Ma'am. Please. Believe me. This is
                    my first day.

      Maybe it's the fake track marks, or the sincerity in Mike's
      voice. Or maybe it's the fact that junkies don't say ma'am...

                                      JANET
                    Put down your gun, Peter.                                                                                        75.


                                      CALDWELL
                    Stay out of this, Janet. 

                                      JANET
                    Shut-up, Peter, and put down the
                    damn gun.

      Caldwell seems to wither a little under her glare. She pushes
      his gun hand down, turns to Mike.

                                      JANET (CONT'D)
                    What now?

                                    MIKE
                    What's below this room?

                                      JANET
                    The garage.

                                    MIKE
                    Cover your ears.

      Mike unloads the revolver. The GUNSHOTS incredibly loud in
      the small room...


      A group of shell-shocked agents. It's over. No one says
      anything for a long time.

      Then Silvo starts to LAUGH. It's a tension release, but it's
      infectious. Soon the room is convulsing with LAUGHTER.


      Felix stands behind the glass in an orange prison jumpsuit.
      His face lights up as Mike and Briggs escort his family -
      IRINA, ALEX and SOPHIA - into the visitation room.

      Tears well up in Felix' eyes as he tries to touch his children
      through the glass. He looks up at Mike and smiles. 


    ON TV: HAND HELD NEWS FOOTAGE of an FBI raid on the Palich
      restaurant. Mogilevich and the Yaponchik brothers are led
      out in handcuffs.

                                    CNN ANCHOR (V.O.)
                    ... A morning raid by Federal Agents
                    resulted in several arrests, including
                    heads of the Russian Vzakonye cartel.
                    Drug Enforcement Agency Spokesperson
                    Elizabeth O'Connor called the arrests
                    a "major victory" against organized
                    crime on the West coast, citing major
                      contributions by FBI and DEA
                    undercover agents. The cartel leaders
                    are being held on charges that include
                    conspiracy to murder a federal agent
                    and kidnapping with special
                      circumstances...

      Pull back to reveal Mike, watching this on the flat screen
      Sony, a big grin on his face.

      Silvo enters, shakes his head.

                                      SILVO
                    Look at this. It's already going to
                    his head.

                                    MIKE
                    Yes sir.                                                                                        77.


                                      SILVO
                    I just got off the phone with Peter
                    Caldwell. He wanted to know why some
                    rookie broke into his house,
                    threatened him and his wife at
                    gunpoint, ripped his phone out of
                    the wall and shot four holes through
                    his new Range Rover. He's pissed.

      Mike, unsure what to say. A deep breath...

                                    MIKE
                    Yes sir. I understand whatever
                      disciplinary--

                                      SILVO
                    Screw that, I owe you a drink. I
                    hate the son of a bitch.

                                    MIKE
                    Yes sir.

                                      SILVO
                    Good first case, Warren.

                                    MIKE
                    Thank you, sir.

      Mike hangs up. Opens the refrigerator. Inside is an orange
      juice carton with "LEVI" written on it. A note taped to it
      says "GOOD JOB - DJ" Mike smiles, drinks directly from the
      carton. He shuts the fridge. Lauren is there.

                                    MIKE (CONT'D)
                    Hi.

                                      LAUREN
                    Hi.

                                    MIKE
                    How's your partner?

                                      LAUREN
                    He starts therapy next week. 

      Mike nods. She hands him a key.

                                    MIKE
                    What's this?

                                      LAUREN
                    The key to your room.
