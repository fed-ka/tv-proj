      FX SHOT: The roof of the building is engulfed in a strange*
      black mist - the nanoforms at work, building something on
      the roof.

                                      LUKE*
                    It's the nanoforms.  Must be. *
                    They're converting the atomic

      And they rush out of the reception - as - outside - LUKE,
      CLYDE, RANI and TYBO approach the locked doors (unaware).

                                                                            CUT TO:

      SARAH JANE, LUKE, CLYDE and RANI are getting out of the
      car.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    I almost feel sorry for Androvax. 
                    All alone and so angry at the
                    universe.

                                    LUKE
                    The truth of the universe was
                      destruction, he said.  Ultimately 
                      everything was about death.

                                      SARAH JANE
                    But that's only part of the truth. 
                    Parts of the universe are dying
                    all of the time.  Planets, stars,
                    people.  But the amazing part is
                    that that isn't the end.  It's
                    only the beginning of something
                    new and exciting being born.

                    Mum?  What is it?

                                    GITA
                    Aliens!  We've seen aliens!

      Rani can't help smiling.

      Clyde can't resist.

                                      CLYDE
                    Aliens, sir?  You've seen aliens.

                                      HARESH
                    Yes.  I have.

                    Aliens, Gita?  Are you sure?

                    Ten feet tall.  Covered in metal. 
                    And these huge helmets.

                                    RANI
                    Sounds like you could do with a
                    cup of tea.

                                    GITA
                    Oh a cup of tea.  And I'll tell
                    you all about it.  Come on Sarah,
                    and bring your note book.  I'm
                    telling you, this is a story you
                    will not want to miss.  It could

                    I'll just go and get my pen.*

      And she hangs back with Luke as the others cross the road,
      watching them, enjoying the excitement and joy.

                                      CLYDE

                    And why would they?  I mean, we
                    live in Bannerman Road.  What's
