An idyllic American factory. There's a huge, long lawn in
front. A Reynolds Extract sign in brick with
flowers/landscaping around it, sits near the entrance. We
see from the number of cars in the parking lot that it's a
company of about 50 - 75 employees.
We are in a manufacturing area of an assembly-line
production. It's a big room full of intricate machines, huge
vats of different colored extract and other food flavoring
products, conveyor belts, bottling machines, etc. It has a
high ceiling with offices on the second floor that have big
windows overlooking this manufacturing area.
We PAN up to the main office.
INSIDE THE OFFICE
JOEL REYNOLDS, head of the company, mid-thirties, is on the
phone with his friend DEAN.
DEAN (v.o.)
You should come by tonight. Half
price well drinks while the game's
going.
JOEL
You always give me free drinks
though.
DEAN (v.o.)
Oh yeah. Well come by anyway.
JOEL
Yeah?... Might as well. No action
going on at my house, that's for
sure.
DEAN (v.o.)
Really? The wife out of town?
JOEL
No... I just haven't been laid in
a month.
2.
DEAN (v.o.)
You guys having problems or
something?
JOEL
No. This is pretty much normal
these days...
As CREDITS continue, camera PULLS OUT, back down to the
manufacturing area, past a big vat of orange extract, down
through various stages of assembly line production, then
follows several bottles of orange extract moving past
HECTOR, a Mexican immigrant employee in his thirties. The
camera stops on him. Talking to Hector is STEP, a short,
beady-eyed Charles-Manson-looking guy with a beard and
mustache. Step is in his forties. He makes everything he
says sound as macho and important as possible.
STEP
You get this job through Manpower?
HECTOR
Yeah.
STEP
I started here with Manpower too.
Started out on the line just like
you.
(DEAD-SERIOUS)
Only I did better... 40 crates a
day.
Beat. Hector is not quite sure what he's talking about.
STEP continues telling his tale in such a way that the only
polite reaction would be one of total amazement.
STEP (CONT'D)
I'm the best sorter in here.
That's why they made me full time
with benefits. I'll probably be
floor manager this year.
A FEW FEET AWAY we see RORY, a stocky indie-rock geek, with
too many tatoos, hair shaved on the side with a ponytail,
lots of bad piercings, wearing baggy shorts with lots of
pockets and some kind of gothy T-shirt -- a look that ought
to be out of style by now.
3.
Rory is putting stickers on boxes with a sticker gun. He
flips the sticker gun around unnecessarily between each
application, adding a few unnecessary moves/motions, slapping
each box when he's done, generally making the activity look
like more of a skill than it actually is. He approaches Step
and Hector, pulling out some fliers from his many pockets.
RORY
(hands them each a flier)
My band's playing this Friday, come
check us out.
Hector looks down at the flier. It's xeroxed with fifties
clip-art, cut out letters and the name of the band, "God's
Cock". Hector just looks at it confused, not knowing much
English, not sure what he's supposed to be doing with the
flier.
AT THE END OF THE LINE, where boxes are loaded onto pallets,
sits MARY, 58 years old, wearing a 15-year-old pair of acid-
wash jeans, and an oversized tweety-bird T-shirt, fanny pack,
and dayglow yellow triangle-shaped earrings. She's pear-
shaped with short hair. She's bitter and bossy, always
shaking her head at everyone. She sits on a stool with a
clipboard, looks over her glasses at Hector, shaking her
head. She talks to Gabriella, a Hispanic woman in her
forties.
MARY
You see that... That new guy.
He's holding us up. It's not my
job to tell them to hold the line
either.
GABRIELLA
And then Joel's gonna come yell at
us, cuz he's not doing his job.
MARY
(folds her arms, fed up)
I'm just gonna sit here.
GABRIELLA
You're not gonna shut it off?
MARY
I'm not gonna hold the line. If
they're not gonna do their job, why
should I do mine.
Mary sits there, arms folded, lips pursed, refusing to pause
the conveyor belt.
4.
Establishing shot. A sports bar that's part of a Holiday
Inn.
Cindy walks a few yards over to her car, a ' 92 Tercel, puts
the guitar in the trunk, gets in and takes off.
Step is on a stretcher being loaded into a MEDIVAC helicopter
by a couple of EMS guys. Step moans in pain as Joel tries to
comfort him. A small crowd of employees watch.
ANGLE ON Mary in the crowd, shaking her head.
MARY
I knew it. That's what happens
when you don't pay attention.
Establishing shot, a pawn shop in a strip mall. Cindy's car
parked out in front.
Joel sits with Brian. Brian has a clipboard, going over the
day's business.
BRIAN
So obviously Step's not coming back
anytime soon. I had to hire a
couple temps. Is that okay?
JOEL
Yeah, sure. How is Step?
22.
BRIAN
Better. They say he's going home
in a couple of days. Speaking of
which, the guys at General Mills
heard about this whole Step thing.
They're worried. If Step decides
to sue us -- beyond the insurance
settlement -- it could be a serious
liability. They don't want to make
an offer until this thing has
settled.
JOEL
Really? They think it's that big
of a liability?
BRIAN
Well yeah. Don't you? I mean,
think about it. Imagine if you
asked a bunch of jurors how much
you'd have to pay 'em to cut their
balls off? I mean, I wouldn't let
someone cut my balls off for a
billion dollars. Seriously --
unless there were some kind of
really expensive operation that
could give you artificial balls or
something. Would you?
JOEL
No, I guess not.
BRIAN
Anyway, I wouldn't worry. He says
he's not going to sue us. Says he
(CRUDE IMITATION)
"don't want somethin' fer nothin "'
and "What's right is right." If we
can just get him to sign something
to that effect we should be fine.
JOEL
Boy, Step sure is being mellow
about all this.
BRIAN
Yeah, well I think when you lose
your balls it mellows you out. You
don't get as pissed off and
aggressive about things. I know
it's true for horses, and bulls.
23.
JOEL
Boy, it sure does make you think..
BRIAN
Oh, by the way, guess who asked for
a raise today?
JOEL
Who?
BRIAN
(GESTURES INDISCRIMINATELY
to someone downstairs)
Dinkus. Can you believe that?
JOEL
Brian, you call everyone here
"Dinkus." I don't know who you're
talking about.
BRIAN
You know, Forklift-Dinkus?
JOEL
Oh... I thought you call him "boy-
genius."
BRIAN
Yeah, well boy-genius asked for a
raise. I said, "are you kidding?
You nearly got someone killed last
week," and then he blamed it on
Dinkus over there.
JOEL
You know Brian, you really ought to
learn the employees' names.
BRIAN
Well, I was thinking about that,
but hey, if this deal goes through
next week, I won't have to. It's
not like I'm gonna be inviting
Dinkus and Boy-Genius over for
dinner.
Joel stands on one side of his office looking down through a
long window overlooking the manufacturing area. Dean comes
in, walks over to the window, looks down at the production
floor with Joel.
24.
DEAN
Hey man. What's goin' o-- Whoa!
DEAN'S POV: It's CINDY, now working down on the floor, on
the assembley line.
DEAN (CONT'D)
Damn! Who's she? Is she new?
JOEL
Yeah. She's a temp.
DEAN
She's a tramp?
JOEL
No a temp. Quit staring.
DEAN
Damn, she's hot! Way to go.
JOEL
Hey, I didn't hire her. She came
here through Manpower, like
everybody else. They just sent her
over.
DEAN
Manpower, huh? Maybe I should give
them a call. You don't usually
have girls anywhere near that hot
working here. What's the deal?
JOEL
Yeah, I know. I guess it makes
sense though if you think about it.
Hot girls need a job just as much
as anyone else.
DEAN
(thinks for a second)
Do they really?... Huh... You just
don't see 'em here. Usually your
temps look like winos. And they're
guys.
JOEL
You wanna hear something really
weird?
DEAN
What?
25.
JOEL
She came on to me.
DEAN
No way! Really?
JOEL
Yeah. I mean, I'm pretty sure. I
could be wrong, but...
DEAN
Hey, I'm sure she did. Are you
kidding? You could have any girl
down there.
JOEL
I don't know about that.
DEAN
I'm serious. Dude, you're the big
shot here. You're the king of...
What do you call that shit you make
here again?
JOEL
Extract. And spray-dried
flavoring, and we're branching out
INTO--
DEAN
Yeah, you're the Extract King man.
You could have any girl here. I
mean, I wouldn't want most of 'em,
but her... Way to go Joel.
Dean looks down at manufacturing area, taking it all in.
DEAN (CONT'D)
So how did she come on to you?
JOEL
Well, first she started asking me
about what happened to Step and all
that stuff -- you know, just sort
of making conversation?
DEAN
Yeah.
JOEL
But it really seemed like she was
flirting with me, you know?
(MORE)
26.
JOEL (CONT'D)
Then, she just sort of asked me
out... I think.
DEAN
Really? How?
JOEL
Well, you see that guy down there
by the fork lift?
ANGLE ON Rory, the indi-rock guy with tattoos, etc.
JOEL (CONT'D)
His band is playing somewhere, at
some party this weekend, and she
asked me if I wanted to go with
her.
DEAN
Wow. So, you gonna do anything
about it?
JOEL
What? No. No way. I couldn't
live with myself if I cheated on
Suzie... It'd be nice if I got
laid at home once in a while
though...
DEAN
(still staring at her)
Man, she is fine. You mind if I
hit that then?
Beat.
JOEL
Yeah, I do sort of...
We see a COMMOTION down on the floor. Mary runs out of the
Women's locker room SCREAMING AND YELLING.
ACTION
Mary runs over to where Hector is working, hysterical.
MARY
My purse is stolen! It's gone!
(pointing at Hector)
He did it! He stole my purse!
27.
Brian runs over and stands between them, trying to calm Mary
down, but she keeps ranting. Hector looks confused and
worried.
BRIAN
Now hold on--
MARY
I won't hold on! I'll call the
cops!
HECTOR
(confused, frightened)
What? I don'... No comprende...
BRIAN
(HORRIBLE SPANISH)
Espera un momento Hector. Tu sabes
donde esta su... uh, purse?
ANGLE ON CINDY, watching the whole thing-- completely
unfazed.Joel rushes in.
JOEL
Now wait a second. Calm down Mary.
How do you know it was stolen?
MARY
It's gone! That's how.
JOEL
Well, what did it look like.
MARY
It was black with a fur, leopard
style border...
As Mary describes the purse, we
CUT TO:
Cindy sits and waits, listening to the radio. It's a very
blue-collar neighborhood. She's about three houses away from
Step's house, keeping an eye on it.
After a beat, Step limps out of the house, walks over to his
pickup truck, painfully gets in, and leaves. Cindy starts
the car and follows from a distance.
Step's truck is parked out at a lake in the country. He and
Cindy sit next to each other on the tailgate, looking at the
stars, talking.
STEP
I just believe that what's
right is right.
CINDY
That's right Step, and what's right
is for you to send a message.
STEP
A message?
CINDY
You need to send a message so that
a horrible accident like this never
happens to anyone else ever again.
That's what's right. And the way
you do that is to take them to
court.
33.
STEP
You think?
CINDY
Yes Step... That's why I called a
lawyer for you -- that guy on all
the bus stop benches.
STEP
Joe Adler?
(TOUCHED)
You did that for me?
CINDY
Mmm hmm... I just want you to do
what's right Step.
They start cuddling, kissing. Cindy pulls away.
CINDY
I'm sorry Step, your doctor said
you shouldn't get aroused.
STEP
No he didn't.
CINDY
Maybe it was your lawyer, but he
talked to your doctor. And your
doctor said it's very important not
to get aroused until after the
trial... I'm sorry.
STEP
That's okay... You're so good to me
Cindy.
They start cuddling again.
CINDY
Look Step, you're getting me turned
on, I'm getting you turned on... I
better just go.
Joel and Dean are at Dean's car, trying to say goodbye to
Brad, who still won't shut up.
BRAD
Like I say, if your wife has any
housewife friends who might--
Dean finally puts his foot down.
39.
DEAN
Okay, you've said that a few times
now Brad. Go on to your car.
Okay?
BRAD
Alright. Cool. Like I say--
DEAN
Goodnight Brad.
BRAD
Okay. See you later.
Brad finally leaves.
DEAN
Let me drive you home. You're in
no condition to drive.
Joel stumbles into Dean's car.
JOEL
Are you sure about this guy Dean?
He acts like he's never done this
before.
DEAN
Oh no. He does it all the time.
Don't worry. He just gets a little
excited sometimes. He's cool.
JOEL
I don't know. He sure doesn't seem
too bright.
DEAN
Yeah well, what do you excpect?
He's a whore.
DISSOLVE TO:
A break room with a kitchen. Joel is badly hungover. He
looks like he's about to throw up as he reaches into the
cupboard above the sink, downs a couple of aspirin, then
drops some alka-seltzer in to a glass of water. Cindy comes
in.
40.
CINDY
Looks like you had one of those
nights.
(FLIRTATIOUS)
Where was I?
Joel nods, tries to grin and look cool as he takes a sip of
his alkaseltzer. Then his eyes go wide, he almost does a
spit-take as something suddenly dawns on him...
JOEL
Oh shit!
He runs out of the room.
CUT TO:
As Brad's dopey narration continues, we see the story he's
telling. It plays out like a bad soft-porn flick on Cinemax.
We see Brad wiping the side of the pool with a rag.
BRAD (V.0.)
.I don't know anything about pool
cleaning, so I was just faking it.
She was in her bathing suit...
Suzie comes out and lies on one of the reclining chairs.
BRAD (V.0.)
.So I struck up a conversation...
BRAD
This is a really nice house.
SUZIE
Thanks.
BRAD
Is it your Dad's house?
SUZIE
No. It's ours.
BRAD
Wow, you look so young to be living
in a house this nice.
SUZIE
Oh, thanks.
Beat.
BRAD
Do you have any sunscreen? I
forgot mine.
45.
Brad's dopey narration comes back in...
BRAD (V.0.)
I thought that was pretty smart
of me -- to ask her to borrow
sunscreen. See, 'cuz that way,
once she gave me some, I could ask
her if she wanted some too, and rub
some on her back, instead of just
coming out and asking her to rub
some on her. Pretty smooth huh?...
We see Brad rubbing lotion on Suzie's back as she lies face-
down on the chair.
BRAD (V.0.)
Once I was rubbing the sunscreen on
her, the rest was easy...
We see Brad's hands working their way down Suzie's back.
Just as they start to move down towards her butt, Joel
interrupts, YANKING US OUT OF THE FLASHBACK.
JOEL
Okay that's enough! Stop!
From the window in his office, Joel watches Cindy working
down on the production floor. Cindy looks up, they make eye
contact for a brief moment. She gives him a flirtacious wave.
Joel waves back. Then Rory comes by, starts talking to
Cindy.
48.
CINDY
So you're in a band?
RORY
.Actually, I'm in five bands
right now. But Godscock is
basically the same four guys as
Fighthead, but Fighthead's more of
a thrash/skatepunk thing. Godscock
is more melodic stuff.
Cindy nods politely. Rory thinks she's interested.
RORY (CONT'D)
So you comin' Friday?
CINDY
Yeah, definitely.
(looks at her watch)
Ooh, I gotta go. Dentist
appointment.
RORY
Cool.
Cindy leaves.
ANGLE ON Mary, on the other side of the room, watching them.
She talks to Gabriella.
MARY
See, there he goes again, slowing
us down.
(RE: CINDY)
Now she's a good sorter. They need
to hire more people like her.
GABRIELLA
She's so nice too.
Hector walks by. Mary just shakes her head.
MARY
I can't believe he's still working
here. You know Silvia can't find
her wallet. Thinks it was stolen.
And guess who was in the locker
room last? Hector.
They both look at Hector and shake their heads in disgust.
49.
MARY
You know, I could get a job at
Southwest Airlines. My Niece works
there. I'd get better benefits
than we get here too.
GABRIELLE
Mmm hmm. I could get a job at
Gemco. You think they would put up
with this stuff at Gemco? Mmm mmn.
They run a tight ship.
MARY
That's right.
It's the end of the workday. People walk to their cars.
Joel turns a corner and finds Cindy right in front of him.
CINDY
Hey Mr. Reynolds.
JOEL
Oh, hey Cindy. You can just call
me Joel.
CINDY
(FLIRTATIOUS)
Okay Joel. So you going to the
party tonight?
JOEL
Oh yeah. Right, that's tonight...
(AWKWARD)
(MORE)
52.
JOEL (CON T - D )
Yeah, I was thinking about it. Are
you going?
CINDY
Yeah, definitely. Maybe I'll see
you there?
JOEL
Yeah, I think I'll probably go.
CINDY
Do you have the directions?
JOEL
I'm not sure...
CINDY
Here, I'll write it down just in
CASE
Cindy opens her purse. We see at least FIVE WALLETS, SEVERAL
WATCHES, JEWELRY, etc. She takes out a pen and a piece of
pink, girly stationary and starts writing.
CINDY (CONT'D)
I'll also put my number on here.
In case you want to call me some
time -- if you want.
Joel blushes awkwardly, like a junior high school kid.
JOEL
Um... Okay. Sure.
Joel pulls into the driveway and is STARTLED as he
practically runs over Nathan, flagging him down.
Joel MUTTERS obscenities as he reluctantly stops and rolls
down the window.
NATHAN
Hi there. Almost missed ya.
JOEL
Hi. I can't talk right now--
NATHAN
Hey, I noticed you guys got a new
pool cleaner today. How is he?
We're thinking of changing
services.
53.
JOEL
Look Nathan, I gotta... Wait, you
mean yesterday, don't you?
NATHAN
Huh?
JOEL
The new pool cleaner. You saw him
yesterday right? Not today.
NATHAN
No. It was today. The new guy.
JOEL
What'd he look like?
NATHAN
Blonde haired kid, about this high,
good looking. Real good looking.
IN FACT--
JOEL
You sure it was today? Not
yesterday?
NATHAN
Yeah.
JOEL
You're absolutely sure?
NATHAN
Yeah. I know it was today, because
I came home for lunch. I was gone
all day yesterday. Anyway, you
think I could go ahead and get that
check from ya? Like I say, it's 55
dollars a plate, so that'd be 110
total. There's no tax...
Nathan leans up to scratch his back. Joel seizes the
opportunity and pulls away, burning a little rubber.
Joel walks past his Secretary.
64.
SECRETARY
Hi Joel. Brian wanted to see you--
(NOTICING)
Oh my God, what happened?
Joel keeps walking, MUMBLES something about falling down some
stairs, goes into his office and shuts the door.
In a WIDE SHOT we see Joel's car is parked on the street. He
walks up and rings the doorbell. We see Step answer, talk to
him and then invite him in.
Joel and Step sit at a picnic table.
72.
STEP
You know, my lawyer told me not to
talk to you.
(BEAT)
You're not here to try to talk me
out of suing are you?
JOEL
Oh, no... No, I'm just kind of
curious about... ah... So you've
been going out with Cindy, huh?
STEP
Yes sir. She's my girlfriend. We
might even get married after all
this lawsuit-settlement stuff gets
worked out.
JOEL
.so some of the guys at work are
saying you gave Cindy that black
eye.
STEP
What? That ain't true at all.
JOEL
Yeah, I know it's not.
STEP
She got it from falling down some
stairs.
JOEL
Hmm... Look, you might wanna be
careful with Cindy.
STEP
(DEFENSIVE)
What do you mean?
JOEL
Well, I'm not sure how to put this,
but... You know, you got a lot of
money coming your way with this
settlement. You might wanna be
CAREFUL--
STEP
Oh no. No, she didn't even know
about that 'til after we started
going out.
73.
JOEL
You sure about that?
STEP
Oh yeah. I didn't tell her about
it for a while 'cuz I was kind of
embarrassed, you know? You don't
tell a girl you just met that you
lost one of your balls. Especially
a girl as hot as Cindy.
JOEL
Yeah...
(DELICATELY)
You know she lives with this guy
Willie right?
STEP
That's her ex. She broke up with
him. She's gonna move out. She
just needs to get all her stuff
outta there.
JOEL
You sure about that?
STEP
Oh yeah. She's moving in with me.
JOEL
Oh. Hmm...
STEP
Look, I know Cindy's got some
problems, but she means well.
She's the best thing that ever
happened to me.
JOEL
Well, okay... If you say so.
Another thing -- you just might
want to watch your back. Some of
the guys at work who think you gave
Cindy the black eye were talking
about paying you a visit -- you
know, getting even.
STEP
Oh. Well I'm not worried about
that.
(dead-serious, proud)
I could kick anyone's ass at that
whole company.
74.
JOE ADLER, is holding court with the various lawyers and
paralegals waiting for the meeting to start. As promised, he
is awful. He looks like Henry Winkler with an extra Y
chromosome and a lot of steroids. (Maybe cast Gene Simmons
with his hair pulled back in a pony tail.)
ADLER
.You see, if both his balls had
been knocked clean off, he would be
a good case, but not a great case:
A man with no balls is no man at
all. He's a freak. He's barely
human. He's gross. And a jury will
never feel like they can walk in
the shoes of a ball-less, neutered,
he/she freak. But Step. He's
still got one ball - barely. He's
still a man. A man who's very
manhood has been jeopardized, but
still a man. And that manhood,
that very sense of what you are as
a human being is hanging by a
thread. Jesus, you can't get more
dramatic than that. That brave
ball, hanging on for dear life,
hanging on for justice, is going to
be the hero of this trial. I'm
tellin' ya this Step guy is the
fuckin' Holy Grail, the Powerball
Jackpot. And you all laughed at me
when I bought those bus bench ads.
But I knew the asses of those poor
slobs that sit on those benches and
ride those sweaty, stinking, cattle
cars are our future. And I --
Joel and Brian walk in.
ADLER
Oh, hello. I'm Joe Adler...
Everybody starts introducing each other.
A bunch of employees including Mary, Garielle, and Rory are
talking, getting worked up.
77.
RORY
.And when they sell the company,
Joel and Brian are gonna be the
one's who get rich, and--
MARY
And we're the ones doing all the
work.
GABRIELLE
That's right.
RORY
It's bullshit man. We should get a
piece of it. I work my ass off.
MARY
Gabrielle and I work harder than
anybody. I should be making what
Brian makes. If you add up all the
crates I move, I lift 10,000 pounds
a day. Minimum.
GABRIELLE
That's right. Here he's gonna make
a million dollars, and we're the
ones who do everything. I went to
college. For three years.
MARY
If we quit, this place couldn't
run. They wouldn't be able to sell
this place for anything.
JIM, a tall skinny 50-something guy with a ridiculously big
mustache and a little paunch, chimes in.
JIM
That's why what we should do is, is
we should all go on strike --
demand stock in the company before
it sells. If General Mills knew
we were on strike, they wouldn't
buy this place until the strike was
over. That way they'd have to give
us stock.
Jim points to his head, gives everyone a "how's that" nod.
It starts to build steam.
RORY
That's right man. We should do it.
We should strike.
78.
MARY
That's right. I could get a job at
Gemco like that. At Gemco, all the
employees are owners -- even says
so on the name tags.
GABRIELLE
Mmm hmm. I could get a job at
Southwest Airlines...
The meeting is already in progress. On Adler's side of the
table are two other lawyers and a couple of paralegals. On
Joel's side it's just he, Brian and Joel's secretary. Maybe
one lawyer who doesn't say much.
Everybody has in front of them a small stack of documents.
The confrence room, like Joel's office, has a full length
window facing the manufacturing area.
ADLER
Ok gentlemen. We've gone through
everything and the only way we
would even begin to consider a
settlement would be to the tune of
the number you see on the bottom of
page 18. Does everyone have this?
Joel and the rest of them find page 18. Joel is stunned by
the number.
JOEL
What!!!?
(so pissed he can barely
get the words out)
We don't have this much money! Not
even close!
ADLER
Not in cash you don't. Of course
not. But if you were to sell off
your assets: the property lease,
the equipment, the--
JOEL
What the ff-- Are you shitting
me!? That would bankrupt us!
BRIAN
This is what I've been trying to
tell you Joel...
79.
JOEL
If you think I'm just going to give
up this entire company that I built
from the ground up--
Adler jumps up, dripping with phoney, forced indignation.
ADLER
How about what my client gave up!?
His testicles! How about that!?
He walks over to the door...
ADLER
In fact, I'll make a deal with you -
- we will drop this case right now
if you come over here and put your
testicles right here
(indicates the space
between the door and the
HINGES)
and let me slam this door like
this...
Adler SLAMS the door ridiculously hard.
ADLER
Go ahead. We can settle this right
now -- call it even. I will drop
this case right now if you let me
slam your balls in this door,
BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED TO MY
CLIENT!
JOEL
It was an accident!
ADLER
Not according to our investigation.
We believe that, in fact, there was
gross negligence...
The employees, same ones in the breakroom, are milling
around, talking, the idea of the strike gaining momentum.
Rory points up to the confrence room.
RORY
I heard those guys up there are the
guys from General Mills.
80.
Employees' POV: Adler pacing around, yelling, Joel yelling
back, etc. [They can't hear any of it.]
MARY
Mmm hmm...
JIM
See, now they're probably up there
negotiating right now -- cuttin' up
the pie that we baked. That's what
it looks like to me.
The employees all nod in agreement.
Employees POV: Adler pointing at his balls, pointing to the
door again, about to slam it. One of his lawyers stops him.
RORY
We gotta act fast. They could be
about to close the deal.
JIM
Yeah, and leave us out in the cold.
RORY
Yeah, then it's too late. If
they've already sold it we can't
get a piece of it. We gotta act
fast. We need to do one of those
walk outs.
JIM
Well, we better do it now.
RORY
Okay, who's in? We need a show of
force. Come on, it's now or
never...
We PAN around the employees as the idea builds momentum,
ending on HECTOR, who looks completely confused by it all.
The meeting heats up.
81.
ADLER
Okay then, let me go back to my
previous offer: I will gladly come
down on that price -- I'll come all
the way down to zero and drop this
case -- if you go over there right
now and slam your testicles in that
door! Because--
JOEL
I don't wanna slam my testicles in
the door! I want you to be
reasonable! You won't even budge
one penny! Come on!
ADLER
Like I say, if you slam your--
JOEL
I'll slam your balls in the door!
ADLER
I'm sorry, did you just threaten
me?
Brian puts his hand on Joel, motions him to calm down.
BRIAN
Look, we need to cool off a minute.
We'll be right back.
Brian leads Joel out of the room.
HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
JOEL
I don't need this. I'm going home.
Joel walks down the stairs. The group of employees see him
and ready themselves for the big confrontation. Joel notices
them all looking at him and stops.
JOEL
Yeah?... What?
But they are ill-prepared. No one knows who should talk
first. It's incredibly awkward. They all look at each other
and mutter things like, "go ahead" "you first". Finally...
82.
RORY
Umm... We were just uh...
JIM
Well, Rory was talking about how
you guys are doing this deal with
General Mills and we just think
that ah... We were considering the
idea of ah...
RORY
Well, we just think that we should
maybe get a piece of it, you know
cuz we do all the work... And if we
don't... um...
Joel's in no mood for this. He goes off on them.
JOEL
You know what? Fine. Fine.
You're all in charge -- all of you.
(gestures to all the
EMPLOYEES)
As of now. You run the goddamn
place. Go ahead. In fact, you can
go up there right now and meet with
Adler. He may slam your balls in
the door, but woohoo! You're the
boss!
Joel storms out, leaving the employees standing there.
A BICKERING MATCH erupts over who was supposed to do the
talking, who said they would say what, who backed down first,
etc. "I was gonna say something but you interrupted," "You
didn't say anything when he was leaving, so I thought you
were quitting. I would've stood up to him."
As the argument dies down, one by one they all go back to
their posts, muttering.
Joel checks into an Extended Stay America hotel.(a chain of
hotels that rent by the week.)
Quick shot of Joel sitting alone in the room. He drops his
suitcase and glumly sits down on the bed, grabs the remote.
87.
He turns on Spectravision and surfs the Adult titles, decides
he's not into it and switches back to regular TV only to find
American Idol is on. He stares at it for a beat, then flops
down on the bed and stares at the ceiling.
Brian sits with Joel. They both look pretty miserable.
Brian looks down at some papers, shaking his head.
BRIAN
We're screwed. General Mills has
pretty much withdrawn the offer
pending a really favorable
settlement with Step.
(shaking his head)
Not only do we not sell the
company, we could wind up bankrupt.
JOEL
(muttering to himself)
So I don't sell the company, don't
get the money, I'm bankrupt, I
don't get Cindy, I paid a guy to
have sex with my wife, and she
actually did it...
BRIAN
Excuse me?
JOEL
Nothing.
Suzie is trying to clean the pool herself, struggling with
the long pole with the net at the end. She looks miserable.
NATHAN (O.S.)
Hello?
Nathan enters through the back gate.
SUZIE
(MUTTERS)
Shit...
Nathan walks over to Suzie. She's in no mood for this. She
acts as unfriendly as possible.
NATHAN
Why are you cleaning the pool
yourself? That new guy didn't work
out?
90.
SUZIE
Yeah, didn't work out.
NATHAN
Boy, you just can't get good help,
eh?
SUZIE
Yeah.
NATHAN
So, did you get a chance to write
that check?
SUZIE
Look Nathan, Joel and I aren't
going to that dinner okay?
Nathan acts deeply disappointed.
NATHAN
Well gee, I wish you would've told
me that before I went and bought
the tickets.
SUZIE
Joel never agreed to this Nathan,
and neither did I.
NATHAN
Well, it sure sounded like you guys
were going. Leslie was gonna talk
to you about it, but you didn't
return our calls. I mean, I
already bought these tickets.
They're nonrefundable. I really
wish you guys had been a little
more clear with me...
It's the last straw. Suzie has had enough. She unleashes
all her pent-up aggression on Nathan.
SUZIE
Okay, let me be really clear with
you then. When we say "I don't
think so," or even "I'm not sure,"
that means "no." Why can't you
understand that?
NATHAN
Well, I just--
91.
SUZIE
Shut up! In fact, let me be even
more clear with you. We don't like
you! Is that clear enough? You're
dull, you never shut up, you never
listen, and we don't want anything
to do with you ever again!
Nathan freezes, in some kind of state of shock. He starts to
shake a little. Suzie just keeps going -- it feels too good
to stop.
SUZIE
Is that clear enough for you
Nathan?! Is that...?
Nathan starts to go into some kind of seizure.
SUZIE
(WORRIED)
Nathan?
Nathan's eyes roll back into his head, and he collapses.
Suzie SCREAMS.
Joel pulls into the parking lot. He looks surprised, seeing
something on the other side of the lot that gets his
attention.
JOEL
(TO HIMSELF)
No way...
From JOEL'S POV, we see Cindy pull up and get out of her car.
Joel watches as she gets out with a grocery bag and heads up
the stairs. Joel gets out and watches her from a distance.
He sees her go into a room and shut the door.
He stares up at the door for a beat. Then, with a look of
determination, Joel walks up the stairs and knocks on her
door.
Wide shot of the Hotel. It's a beautiful morning.
Extract bottles moving along the assembly line full steam.
Mary and Gabriella gossiping.
MARY
(looks at her watch)
Joel hasn't been in all morning.
can you believe that?
GABRIELLE
If we come in late, we get fired.
And here we're working our tails
off, and he's gonna get rich.
Joel walks in, bright-eyed and cheery, greeting people. He
walks over to Mary carrying her PURSE.
JOEL
Here you go Mary.
98.
Joel hands her the purse. Mary looks at it, not quite sure
how to react, not ever wanting to appear grateful for
anything -- not in her nature.
JOEL (CONT'D)
And by the way, Hector didn't take
it. Cindy did.
Joel walks off. Mary just shakes her head at him. She
whispers to Gabriella.
MARY
Can you believe that? Blaming
Cindy just to protect Hector.
Step is pacing around, waiting. Joel comes out.
JOEL
Hi Step...
STEP
Hey.
JOEL
How you doin'? How's your, ah...
STEP
(looking down at his
CROTCH)
Oh it's okay. Some days it still
hurts, but they've got me on some
pills. It's not too bad I guess...
99.
JOEL
Well... that's good.
They both sit down on the edge of the dock.
STEP
Look, ah... Cindy left me.
Joel's nods, not surprised, but sympathetic.
JOEL
Wow... Bummer...
STEP
Yeah, it is a bummer... You know, I
thought the worst part was having
my balls knocked off, but you know
what the worse part is? Dealin'
with all this bullshit... I'm sick
of that Adler guy tellin' me what
to do. He's a real dick.
JOEL
Yeah, he sure is.
STEP
The truth is, I just want to have
my old life back -- I just want to
go back to work. I'm a workin'
man; that's what I do.
JOEL
Yeah... I'm beginning to think I
might be the same way... I'm a
little worried about what I'd do
with too much time on my hands.
STEP
I just lay around and watch TV all
day.
JOEL
Yeah,... I think I do a lot worse.
STEP
The problem is, if I bankrupt the
company, there won't be a job to go
back to.
JOEL
You don't have to bankrupt the
company.
100.
STEP
Yeah, but then if I drop the
lawsuit, you'll sell the company,
and the new company might not hire
me.
JOEL
Well, maybe I don't have to sell
the company... You know I've been
thinking; all these years I've been
building this company, dreaming
about the day I could sell it and
retire, but what would I really do
if I retired? It's like that old
saying -- it's not about the
destination, it's about the
journey?
Step just stares at him blankly, he lost him.
JOEL
I guess what I'm saying is, too
much free time might not be such a
good thing -- like that old saying,
idle hands are the Devil's
playground?
Step's never heard that one either.
STEP
I'm sorry, I don't do much book
readin'.
JOEL
What I'm saying is, I'm thinking
maybe I won't sell the company...
STEP
Really?
JOEL
that is, if you dropped the
lawsuit. -- and remember, you'll
still get that insurance money --
probably a couple hundred thousand.
What do you think?
STEP
Hmm. That sounds fair... But
under one condition...
JOEL
What's that?
101.
STEP
You make me floor manager.
JOEL
Deal.
They shake hands.
Joel walks in with Step at his side. Addresses the
employees.
JOEL
Hold the line!
Mary shuts off the conveyer belt.
JOEL
Okay, listen up everybody.
(Waits for them to settle)
I've decided not to sell the
company...
Gasps and murmurs among the employees.
JOEL
And I'm making Step the new Floor
Manager.
More gasps and murmurs.
JOEL
And if anyone doesn't like it, I
hear they're hiring over at
Gemco... But just remember, at
Gemco, the owner doesn't know your
names; you never even meet him,
he's at an office up in Chicago
somewhere and you get an auto-
response if you try to email him to
complain about anything. Here, you
can come up to my office any time
you have a problem. Thanks.
Joel walks off. Brian catches up with him.
BRIAN
Huh? You're not selling?
102.
JOEL
It's about the journey Brian. The
journey.
ANGLE on Mary. She and Gabrielle start right back up.
MARY
You know, if Joel's going to put
him in charge, we should go on
strike. You know, at Gemco, the
union handles the strikes and you
don't even have to--
PULL OUT as Step cuts her off.
STEP
Quit yapping and get back to work
or you're fired.
Step walks off -- maybe pops a testosterone pill. Mary and
Gabrielle keep muttering and shaking their heads.
LONG PULL OUT as things get back to normal at the factory.
Quick shot of Nathan's casket being lowered into the ground
as the priest says the last few words.
People hug and console each other. Joel sees Suzie, walks
over to her.
JOEL
Hi... You doing okay?
SUZIE
Yeah, I'm okay.
103.
JOEL
I heard you were right there when
it happened. That must've been
rough.
SUZIE
It was horrible Joel. He came over
to ask for that check, and I
just...
Suzie breaks down, starts CRYING.
SUZIE (CONT'D)
.I just lost it. I started
yelling at him. I said horrible
things. He had an aneurism and I
probably caused it.
(CRYING UNCONTROLLABLY)
I think the last thing I said to
him was "shut up." Those were the
last words he heard.
Joel hugs her, consoling.
JOEL
It's okay, it's not your fault...
It's not your fault.
Suzie's crying subsides a little.
SUZIE
It could happen to any of us Joel.
Any of us could have an aneurism.
We could die at any moment.
JOEL
Yeah, I know... I know... But we
probably won't. It'll be alright.
Suzie starts to regain her composure.
They stand there for a beat.
JOEL
You wanna go get something to
eat... or something?
Beat. Suzie still sniffling a little.
SUZIE
Yeah, okay. Sure.
104.
They walk off towards the cemetery gates. After a while,
Joel hands Suzie a Kleenex.
JOEL
Here...
SUZIE
Thanks.
They walk a little further. Joel looks at the Chapel nearby.
JOEL
Maybe we should've been married in
a Church like that one. Instead of
the Botanical Gardens.
SUZIE
I thought you liked the Botanical
Gardens?
JOEL
Yeah, but... a church just seems
more -- I don't know -- official.
SUZIE
You think it would've made a
difference?
JOEL
I don't know... So, are we still
married?
SUZIE
Well, legally yes.
JOEL
I mean otherwise.
SUZIE
Hmmm... We can talk about it I
suppose.
JOEL
Alright.
They walk for a beat.
JOEL
You know, this is really bad,
but... Oh never mind.
SUZIE
What?
105.
JOEL
Well, as I was looking down at
Nathan there, I was thinking...
That's the longest I've ever seen
him with his mouth shut.
Suzie LAUGHS in spite of herself.
SUZIE
Joel!
They walk off into the distance as we
FADE OUT.
