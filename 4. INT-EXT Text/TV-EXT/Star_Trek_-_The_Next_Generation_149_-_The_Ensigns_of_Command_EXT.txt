       Your accomplishments are indeed

       That may not be possible. The

       not believe I can "get the job 
       done." My training has prepared 
       me for starship command duties. 
       As a cultural contact I am 
       proving to be less than exemplary.

       Their leader has rejected my

         DATA 
       I have. In the last three hours 
       and eight minutes, I have spoken 
       to fifty-six colonists. Ten 
       refused to believe a threat 
       exists. Twenty-two favored 
       staying and fighting the Sheliak.

       "Ah" is right. The lives of

     Her mood is upbeat.

       Data -- we're having an effect. 
       So many people are asking 
       questions about the Sheliak that 
       Gosheven's called a public

       Is there any indication that 
       Gosheven has changed his position? 
 
         ARD'RIAN 
       No. But a meeting will give you 
       the chance to present your 
       recommendations. 
 
         DATA 
       First, will Gosheven allow me to 
       speak? Second, even if he does, 
       what good will it do? So far, 
       my attempts at persuasion have 
       been ineffective. 
 
     Ard'rian looks at him with compassion for a beat -- 
     then suddenly gives Data a quick kiss on the lips. 
 
         DATA (cont'd) 
       Why did you do that? 
 
         ARD'RIAN 
       You appeared to need it. 
 
         DATA 
       Among humans, a kiss normally 
       serves to seal a friendship or 
       to indicate support, attraction,

         DATA (cont'd) 
       In this context, I would assume 
       your intention was to express 
       support. 
 
         ARD'RIAN 
       That was my primary motivation. 
 
     The implication being that there were secondary 
     motivations. But if Data is aware of the implication, 
     he makes no sign. 
 
         ARD'RIAN (cont'd) 
       You don't really understand human 
       behavior, do you? 
 
         DATA 
       That is something of an 
       understatement. 
 
         ARD'RIAN 
        (sighs) 
       Sometimes I don't either. 
       androids are a lot more rational. 
 
         DATA 
       Thus far, that quality has not 
       helped me accomplish my mission. 
 
         ARD'RIAN 
       A rational argument isn't always 
       enough. Maybe to be more 
       persuasive, you need to use a 
       little reverse psychology.

       That implies deception, does it 
       not?

     A large horseshoe-shaped amphitheater with a place for 
     the engineers and Gosheven. A number of citizens -- 
     including Haritath and Kentor -- have turned out for 
     the debate so the place is filled. In the b.g. is the 
     aqueduct purifying plant. 
 
         GOSHEVEN 
       You've all heard about the android 
       Starfleet sent here, and you've 
       been discussing why he's come. 
 
     Data and Ard'rian ENTER. Gosheven ignores them. 
 
         GOSHEVEN (cont'd) 
       I called this meeting to replace 
       misinformation with cold, hard 
       fact. 
 
     The colonists are craning their necks to look at Data. 
     Gosheven realizes Data's presence can't be ignored. He 
     strides over to confront Data. 
 
         GOSHEVEN 
       Leave. Immediately.

       Do you consider your position so 
       weak that it cannot withstand 
       debate? 
 
         HARITATH 
       Let him talk. 
 
     MURMURS of assent from the crowd. Gosheven gives a 
     terse nod. In a sense Data's called him a coward and 
     he has to stand up to this city slicker, this outsider. 
 
     Data steps front and center. In an effort to pull this 
     off, he attempts to use human rhetorical devices 
     (timing, dynamics, inflection, gestures, etc.) -- but, 
     as there's no real passion behind them, they come off 
     as studied and not quite sincere. A good performance, 
     but still a performance. 
 
         DATA 
       You know of the Sheliak threat. 
       Starfleet wishes to evacuate you 
       for your own protection. 
       Gosheven has decided otherwise. 
       That is his right. And I will 
       not waste time trying to reverse 
       that decision. 
 
     Surprised reactions from the crowd. This is not what 
     they expected to hear. 
 
         DATA (cont'd) 
       I admire your conviction in the 
       face of certain defeat. Your 
       effort will be valiant, though 
       doomed. Still, when you die, 
       you will die for land and honor. 
 
      29   ANGLE ON 
 
     The crowd. Data's starting to get a reaction. People 
     are beginning to eye each other nervously. It's one 
     thing to thumb your nose at a distant enemy, quite 
     another to talk about dying.

     MURMURS of agreement from the crowd. 
 
         GOSHEVEN 
       Are you ready to follow this 
       machine, Haritath? Give up 
       everything? Without a fight? 
       He says we're going to lose, I

       talking! 
 
     Kentor stands. He has a calm but commanding presence. 
 
         KENTOR 
       And what if he's right, and you're 
       wrong? Shouldn't we consider that 
       possibility? 
 
     More crowd reaction. Sympathy is swinging away from 
     Gosheven. 
 
         HARITATH 
       We may be sacrificing ourselves 
       for nothing -- 
 
         GOSHEVEN 
       Last winter we buried your little 
       girl -- laid her to rest next to 
       your mother, and you dare speak 
       of sacrifice? 
 
     Gosheven whirls and nails Kentor with a look.

        (continuing) 
       And you, Kentor, we built you 
       a new house after the fire wiped

        (addressing them all) 
       This colony exists because 
       generations gave their lives for 
       it. Many people died before we 
       found a way to adapt to the 
       radiation. Many more died

     A vote of confidence is about to take place, and 
     Gosheven realizes he's about to lose it. He falls back 
     on the innate authority of an elected leader. 
 
         GOSHEVEN 
       Have you considered what this 
       evacuation means? Everything we 
       have, we abandon. Everything 
       we've built turns into dust. 
       Everything we've accomplished 
       means nothing. 
        (shakes head) 
       Well, I say NO! You elected me 
       to be your leader -- follow me 
       now! I don't think our chances 
       are as hopeless as he says. And

     The square. FOUR MEN armed with rifles stand 
     shoulder to shoulder in front of the plant and 
     aqueduct. Standing defiant and unarmed, save for the 
     probe at his belt, on an upper level is Gosheven.

     Off to one side are a number of colonists (including 
     Ard'rian, Haritath, and Kentor), nervously awaiting 
     the outcome. 
 
     Then a PHASER STUN hits one of the armed men; he 
     drops. As the others whirl to take aim -- 
 
      48A  NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL) 
 
     A PHASER BEAM sweeps across the line of armed men, 
     STUNNING them instantly. No one even gets a shot off. 
 
     Gosheven, astonished, reaches for the probe at his 
     belt. Data calmly stands up from his hiding place, 
     aims his phaser. Gosheven freezes -- it's futile; 
     obviously Data could stun him before he could get 
     anywhere near Data. 
 
      48B  WIDER (OPTICAL) 
 
     as Data steps out into the street, holds his phaser 
     up for all to see. 
 
         DATA 
       That was the "stun" setting. 
 
     Data switches the setting on the phaser -- 
 
         DATA (cont'd) 
       This is not. 
 
     Data turns, BLASTS the control panel on the aqueduct. 
     A shower of SPARKS. EFFECT as the reaction races up 
     the aqueduct. The water stops flowing. Gosheven is 
     speechless. Data addresses the colonists: 
 
         DATA (cont'd) 
       I could reduce this pumping 
       station to a pile of debris... 
       but I trust my point is clear. 
       I am one android with a single 
       weapon. There are hundreds of 
       Sheliak on the way... and their 
       weapons are far more powerful. 
 
     Data pauses. The colonists are dead silent.

       And the Sheliak may not even offer 
       you a target. They can obliterate 
       this colony from orbit. You will 
       die never having seen the faces 
       of your killers. 
 
     Data walks deliberately to one of the stunned 
     defenders, picks up the rifle with his free hand, holds 
     it out to the group of colonists. 
 
         DATA (cont'd) 
       The choice is yours. 
 
     The colonists look at one another. Finally: 
 
         KENTOR 
       There are other places -- other 
       challenges. It's time to move 
       on. 
 
     And Kentor EXITS. One by one, the colonists follow 
     him. The mantle of leadership has passed. 
 
      48C  NEW ANGLE 
 
     Gosheven, slump shouldered, bends and scoops up a 
     handful of dirt at the base of the silent pool. Data 
     moves to join him. 
 
         GOSHEVEN 
       I really was willing to stay and 
       die for this. 
 
         DATA 
       I know that, but it is just a 
       thing, and things can be replaced. 
       Lives cannot. Live, rebuild and 
       be remembered. 
 
     A long beat. Then Gosheven wipes his hand on his 
     pants, and walks back to join his people.

     watching Gosheven go. Data looks down at the phaser

     Outside the shuttle, Ard'rian approaches. Data sees 
     her, emerges from the shuttle to meet her.

       Hi. 
 
         DATA 
       Hello, Ard'rian. 
 
         ARD'RIAN 
       The evacuation plan is going well. 
       When the transport ship arrives, 
       we'll be ready. 
        (a beat) 
       You succeeded.

       I would not have succeeded without 
       your support and insight, and I 
       appreciate your assistance. 
 
         ARD'RIAN 
       Good. Then you won't forget me? 
 
         DATA 
       I am incapable of forgetting. 
       I will remember every detail of 
       my visit with perfect clarity.

     Ard'rian bites the bullet: 
 
         ARD'RIAN 
       I guess what I really want to know 
       is -- do you have any feelings 
       for me? 
 
         DATA 
       I have no feelings of any kind. 
 
     Ard'rian is silent. 
 
         ARD'RIAN 
       No. Of course you don't. 
 
     Data studies her. She's downcast. Mimicking her 
     behavior earlier, he gives her a quick kiss on the 
     lips, startling her. 
 
         ARD'RIAN (cont'd) 
       What was that for? 
 
         DATA 
       You appeared to require it. 
 
         ARD'RIAN 
       You observed I was unhappy and 
       did what you concluded would make 
       me feel better. A purely rational 
       deduction. 
 
     She's still downcast.

       Have I disappointed you? 
 
         ARD'RIAN 
       No, I'm disappointed in myself

       It's so easy to believe otherwise. 
       It's so easy to read things into 
       your behavior... and perceive 
       feelings where none exist.
