          Johnny hops from the Jeep, approaches the Chevy.  And we
          may notice California plates, some industrial band bumper
            stickers, but Johnny's eyes are on the driver:  a very
          attractive woman in her early thirties, ANITA... she seems
          dazed and disoriented...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Are you hurt?

          Anita has to think about it for a second.

                                        ANITA
                        I... I don't think so.  God, I
                        don't know what happened.  I only
                        looked down for a second...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (pulling his phone)
                        I'm gonna call for help.

                                        ANITA
                        No.  I-I think I'm all right...

          She starts to get out.  As Johnny grabs the door handle...          DEAD ZONE: MISBEGOTTEN - TEASER - 11/14/02 PINK        7.

          THUNK!  The door slams, snapping Johnny out of the vision. 
          As he reacts, confused, WE SEE Penny suddenly appear behind
          him.  Before he knows what's happening, she slaps a rag

          Johnny struggles but --


          SUBJECTIVE POV

          His world is already spinning.  The last thing he sees is

                                              ACT ONE

          FADE IN:


          Dana on her cell as she waits for her car at a valet stand.

                                        DANA
                        About twenty times.  Do you have
                        any idea where he could be?

                                        BRUCE'S VOICE (PHONE)
                        Sorry.  I really don't.

          A sudden suspicion shadows Dana's eyes.

                                        DANA
                        Sarah didn't call him, did she?

                                        BRUCE'S VOICE (PHONE)
                        Dana, if Johnny had a date with
                        you, he wouldn't...

                                        DANA
                        If he checks in, ask him to give
                        me a call.  That is, if it isn't
                        too much trouble.

          She clicks off, thinks for a beat.  Then grabs her bag
          and goes.



          The doorbell RINGS.  Footsteps, then SARAH appears. 
          Upbeat, smiling, she opens the door.  The smile fades...

                                        SARAH
                        Walt's not here.

                                        DANA
                                (evenly)
                        I know.  I'm looking for Johnny.

          Sarah's eyes narrow.  A beat.

                                        DANA
                        Is he here?

                                        SARAH
                        No.

                                        DANA
                                (beat, evenly)
                        Mind if I look for myself?

          Sarah laughs incredulously.

                                        SARAH
                        You've got a helluva lot of nerve.

                                        DANA
                                (dry)
                        My secret of success. 

                                        SARAH
                        Excuse me, I'm very busy.

          Closing the door in her face... Dana sticks her foot in
          the door... the door jams against it...

                                        DANA
                        Ow.

                                        SARAH
                        Well, get your foot out of the...

          Dana pushes the door open and enters...



          Two POLICE CRUISERS parked near Johnny's Jeep.  DEPUTY
          ROSCOE hunts for clues in the b.g. while WALT talks on
          his phone.

                                        WALT
                        Dana, you seen Johnny?

                                        DANA
                        No, but that seems to be the
                          question of the day... I was just
                        asking your wife the same thing...

          Walt's a little thrown by this.

                                        WALT
                        You're with Sarah now?

                                        DANA
                        We were just sitting down to tea.

                                        WALT
                        Has she heard from him?

                                        DANA
                                (holding the phone so
                                both can hear)
                        He wants to know if you've heard
                        from him.

                                        SARAH
                        No.  Walt, what's going on?

                                        WALT
                        I'm out on Cypress Hill Road. 
                        One of my guys found Johnny's car
                        on the shoulder...

          Both women react with equal concern...

                                        SARAH
                        He had an accident?

                                        WALT
                        No.  The car's fine.  Engine runs,
                        it's got gas...

                                        WALT (CONT'D)
                                (looking around)
                        There's just no sign of Johnny.

          In the b.g., Roscoe spies something on the ground.

                                        ROSCOE
                        Walt... over here.  

          But Roscoe's waving for Walt to join him.

                                        WALT
                        Look, I gotta go.  I'll call you
                        if I find out anything...
                                (pause, then)
                        I'll call both of you.



          A old rambling structure that juts starkly from the
          surrounding weedy fields like something out of a Wyeth
            painting.  An aged Realtor's sign on a rusty post creaks
          in the wind.  'No sale' for many years, apparently.


          CLOSER ANGLE

          The windows shuttered and boarded, adding to the sense of
            abandonment.  Camera finds the girls' car parked by a*
          utility shed. *





          Pushing toward a basement window...



          rolling down a parkway... bubble lights flashing, sirens
          wailing... a sign says Welcome to New Hampshire... New
            Hampshire State police cars are waiting for them and join
          the caravan...
