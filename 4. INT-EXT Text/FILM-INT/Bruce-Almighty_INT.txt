A news crew shuttles around a GIGANTIC COOKIE. Standing by
are the KOWOLSKI BROTHERS, GUSTOV and VOL, two SHORT, STOCKY,
MEN, along with MOTHER KOWOLSKI and other bakery family
employees. A "30 YEAR ANNIVERSARY" sign hangs in the
background.
BRUCE NOLAN looks into a make-up mirror, desperately trying
to place a large segment of wayward hair.
BRUCE
Oh, God, no! The hair's wrong.
This is a bad sign.
(calling out)
We really need to get a make-up
person?!
The segment producer, ALLY LOMAN, steps over.
ALLY
Not in the budget. And not to
*
*
worry, you're going to look great
in this.
She holds out a HAIR NET.
BRUCE
A hair net? I'm not wearing a hair
net. I just did the hair.
ALLY
(matter of fact)
Health code. In the kitchen or
around the cookie, you gotta have
it.
BRUCE
(to crew: re hair net)
You guy's should tell me this
before hand, this is like a huge
waste of...moose.
Bruce spreads the hair net, bends down out of frame, comes up
looking ridiculous and very disgruntled.
BRUCE
Remind me to swing by an elementary
*
school after this and serve lunch.
Ally laughs.
2.
ALLY
You're a thing of beauty.
In
three, two, one. . .
Bruce SNAPS from pissed to instant charismatic TV newsman.
(Note: Whenever Bruce speaks on camera he speaks in his
"REPORTER'S VOICE" - that recognizable, too-smooth delivery
that all news reporters seem to have. In mathematical terms
Bruce's version is to the 7th power.)
BRUCE
For three decades the Kowolski
Family Bakery has been a mainstay
in downtown Buffalo. Known for
their sinfully rich, cream filled,
deep fried polski pierogis. And
the occasional sugar induced coma
that follows. Today, in honor of
their 30 year anniversary, Momma
Kowolski and her sons Gustov and
Vol, decided to do something, a
little bit different. Tell me
guys, how did this idea come about?
GUSTOV
Well,
Vol said to me, 'Gustov, why
don't
we make the biggest chocolate
chip
cookie in Buffalo?' And I
said,
'Yeah, sure.'
BRUCE
Wow. Fascinating.
Bruce steps up to the HUGE COOKIE.
BRUCE
The previous Buffalo cookie record
was 3 feet, 17 inches baked by
Gladys Pelsnick. But this behemoth
cookie clearly proving that Gustov
and Vol have much more free time.
The Kowolski brothers and all celebrate in the background,
toasting with big mugs of milk. Bruce steps forward, looks
dramatically at camera, slow zoom in as he speaks.
BRUCE (CONT'D)
As we witness the ceremonial
toasting with milk it makes one
pause and think. What are we
really looking at here?
(MORE)
3.
BRUCE (CONT'D)
Is it just a big cookie or does
this cookie represent the pride of
Buffalo? Our dedicated and hard
working citizens the key
ingredient, with a few nuts thrown
in.
(motions his eyes to the
Kowolski twins)
And finally, the love of our
families which provides the warm
chewy center making our beloved
Buffalo the sweetest place to live.
Camera is in CLOSE as Bruce signs-off.
BRUCE (CONT'D)
And that's the way the cookie
crumbles. I'm Bruce Nolan,
Eyewitness News.
Bruce's hair net SLIPS UP, PUFFING HIS HAIR INTO A BUN ON THE
TOP OF HIS HEAD. The Kowolskis and bystanders all laugh.
The frame FREEZES.
We PULL BACK from the TV and find Bruce holding the remote,
watching the recorded spot on TV. We are now...
Bruce is with his longtime girlfriend, GRACE. She has a box
of photos on the coffee table in front of her organizing them
into a photo album.
BRUCE
So, what do you think?
GRACE
It's good.
BRUCE
It sucks. It's a story about a
cookie. People with eating
disorders will be riveted,
(goes into huge pathetic
fan character)
Dear Bruce, love the bakery piece.
I can't wait to vomit so I can make
room for more cookies.
GRACE
I thought it was funny. I love the
hair net. How'd you get it to do
that?
4.
BRUCE
What? I'm cutting that. They made
me wear that stupid thing. I don't
even look like myself. The hair is
one of the most important parts of
an on camera persona. Right out of
the gate, I lost the hair
advantage.
Grace looks at a photo,
GRACE
Oh, my gosh, look at this one. My
sister is so drunk.
She places it in the album.
BRUCE
Grace. Try to stay focused here.
I need your help.
GRACE
Aren't you taking this a little too
seriously?
BRUCE
It's sweeps Grace. It is serious.
There's an anchor job open. This
is important. This is our future!
Bruce points to the TV as he says "future," not realizing
he's pointing at the ridiculous image of himself with the
hair net bun. Grace can't help but giggle.
GRACE
I'm sorry.
Bruce collapses into Grace's arms like a child. He clearly
has a fragile temperament.
BRUCE
(sighs)
I'm never going to get anchor doing
these kind of assignments. I want
my work to matter.
GRACE
It does matter. You're funny. You
make people smile. Come on, take a
break, help me put this album
together.
BRUCE
(reluctant)
Alright.
Grace holds up a photo.
GRACE
Oh look at this. It's the first
day we moved in together.
It's the two of them, younger, laughing.
BRUCE
(down)
Yeah, so full of hopes and dreams.
GRACE
Oh, here's me at my sister's
wedding. I caught the bouquet.
It's a picture of Grace overpowering the other bridesmaids
for the bouquet.
BRUCE
You look pretty intense, hun.
GRACE
Well, I was thinking about you.
Grace cuddles into Bruce.
BRUCE
So, you're attracted to me in some
way, is that what you're trying to
say?
Grace rolls over onto Bruce.
GRACE
You have no idea.
BRUCE
I was saving myself for the wedding
night, but if you keep this up, I
may lose my resolve.
Grace stands, pulling Bruce up.
GRACE
Well, that's the way the cookie
crumbles.
They kiss, stumbling toward the bedroom.
6.
BRUCE
Hey, that's a good line, but you
need more resonance. From the
diaphragm.
(newscaster voice)
That's the way the cookie crumbles.
GRACE
Oh, say it again.
BRUCE
(bigger)
That's the way the cookie crumbles.
GRACE
(sweet, southern groupie)
Oh, I just love on-air
personalities.
BRUCE
(newscaster voice)
Well then, let me take these
clothes off and slip into my hair
net.
Grace laughs, Bruce joins in as they disappear into the
bedroom.
CUT TO:
A TELEVISION SCREEN
We see the INTRO FOR SIXTY MINUTES:
NEWS CLIP
I'm Ed Bradley, I'm Merely Safer,
an d I ' m --
LESLIE STAHL is HIT IN THE NECK WITH A TRANQUILIZER DART.
Her head wavers, then DROPS on the desk. The camera PANS to
BRUCE, who lowers a bamboo blow gun, cooly addresses camera.
BRUCE
...Bruce Nolan. And this is Sixty
Minutes.
THE SIXTY MINUTES TICKING CLOCK
DISSOLVE TO:
BRUCE'S ALARM CLOCK - IT RINGS
We are in. . .
7.
Bruce lies next to Grace with a big smile on his face. Grace
hits the alarm, rolls over snuggling close to Bruce.
GRACE
Sweety, time to get up...
She kisses Bruce, gets up.
BRUCE
No, I'm having a great dream.
The covers are RIPPED OUT OF FRAME.
Bruce throws a mock
hissy fit.
Bruce watches TV as he buttons his shirt.
SPORTSCASTER
...and the Sabers lost another
close one last night. Four to
three to the Toronto Maple Leafs.
BRUCE
Of course they lost, they're my
team.
CUT TO:
MOMENTS LATER
Bruce checks his hair in the mirror practicing his new sign-
off.
BRUCE
"And that's the way the cookie
crumbles."
(calls to Grace)
You know, I think there might be
something to that cookie line.
Everything great anchor has his own
signature sign-off.
(as Walter Cronkite)
"And that's the way the cookie
crumbles."
ANGLE - SAM
Peeing in the corner on the carpet.
8.
BRUCE
Oh no!
Grace, the dog!
GRACE (O.S.)
I'm in the shower!
BRUCE
Ah!
Bruce runs along carrying the peeing Sam with extended arms
dodges a man ascending the stares, who gets sprinkled.
BRUCE
Whoops, sorry.
Bruce rushes through the newsroom, rounds a corner and runs
right into BOBBY, the endlessly yammering PASTRY CART GUY.
1.

BOBBY
Bruce the goose! Morning, Buddy.
Don't even move, I got somethin'
special today. My mom made it just
for you.
BRUCE
Well, that's- Bobby, I gotta go-
I'm late...
BOBBY
(bending down)
You like Quiche?
He comes back up, proudly presents a slice of quiche.
BOBBY
You know, contrary to popular
belief the quiche was actually
invented by the Mayans, then stolen
by the French. They shoulda said,
"Hey, that quiche ain't yours, it's
Mayan!"
Bobby belts out a laugh.
BRUCE
Bobby, I can't, I--
BOBBY
Just taste it, taste it...
Bobby shoves a bite into Bruce's mouth. Bruce feigns liking
it with exasperation.
BRUCE
Mmm, delicious, I really gotta go.
BOBBY
That's a buck seventy-five.
BRUCE
Can you get Kelly- Ahh...
Bruce tosses the thought, digs into his pocket, fishing for
cash.
BOBBY
(excited)
Oh, two o'clock, two o'clock, two-o-
five, two-ten...
12.
Bruce glances over, annoyed but freezes at the sight of sexy
anchorwoman, SUSAN ORTEGA across the room.
BOBBY
Way out of our league, huh?
Bruce offers his money to Bobby.
BOBBY
You know, I saw them editing your
cookie piece.
BRUCE
Really?
BOBBY
They must have gotten high or
something, cause they was orderin'
everything, I had. Hey, how long
have you been interested in pastry?
'Cause I've got an aunt who makes
baklava twenty layers deep.
BRUCE
(holding money out)
Bobby.
BOBBY
(gets a brilliant idea)
Maybe you could do a story on her!
Bruce tosses the money on the cart, heads off.
BRUCE
Keep the change.
BOBBY
(calling after)
I'll give her a call, we'll talk
about it later!
ON THE MONITOR:
EVAN
Is something killing your kids?
Find out tonight at eleven.
Bruce looks at the sign quizzically for a beat, then
continues on.
13.
IN THE ROOM
The morning meeting is well in progress. Leading the group
is the station manager and Bruce's boss, JACK KELLER, 50's, a
constant furrow in his brow.
Also in the room: Bruce's fellow field reporter and rival
EVAN BAXTER, 30' s , a walking statement. Impeccable posture,
perfect speech, perfect everything and he knows it.
FRED DONOHUE, the ever jovial sports reporter; always tanned,
vain weatherman, DALLAS COLEMAN and segment producer Ally
Loman.
JACK
Okay, promos are approved, let's--
ALLY
Ah, isn't that last one a little
misleading? I mean, the story's
about flu shots. Do we have to
scare people to death?
EVAN
No, just into watching. Or I could
change it to: "Slow news day, come
yawn with us. At eleven."
FRED
Sniffles at eleven is nice.
DALLAS
Attack of the killer sniffles?
ALLY
(to Dallas)
The tanning booth is starting to
zap your brain, you know that?
DALLAS
I don't use a tanning booth.
A beat and they all crack up.
FRED
*
Come on. You're turning orange.
*
EVAN
*
He looks Florida ripe to me.
.
*
More laughs.
*
14.
JACK
I would have swore I already said
this, but promos are approved. Now
*
can we move on?
*
ALLY
Jack, shouldn't the promos be
*
focusing on Pete's retirement.
This is his last week.
EVAN
(leading)
Yeah, yeah. Any word on the open
anchor position, Jack?
JACK
Evan, you'11 know something when I
know something.
Bruce bursts into the room. The meeting stops. Jack doesn't
need to say anything, he just looks at his watch.
BRUCE
Sorry, Jack. It wasn't my fault.
The traffic was -- You guys already
played the spots?
JACK
Nice story, Bruce, but we're going
with Evan's piece on the sex
scandal at the mayor's office for
sweeps.
This hits Bruce hard. A beat of silence.
EVAN
And that's the way the cookie
crumbles.
The others chuckle. Only Ally remains sympathetic.
EVAN
I'm just messin' with you, Bruce.
See you've got to remember that the
news room is like a cookie...
More laughs.
BRUCE
(re: Evan's perfect
posture)
That's great Evan.
(MORE)
15.
BRUCE (cont'd)
Is you're posture naturally that
good, or do you have to shove a
stick up there?
JACK
Okay, knock it off... Bruce we're
holding your story in reserve.
Now, can we get back to the board
so we have something to air today?
Jack continues with assignments. Evan sits smugly, as Bruce
slides down into his chair, deflated.
Jack is at Bobby's cart, paying for a sandwich. Bruce
catches up .to him.
BRUCE
Jack, Jack, hey.
Can I talk to you
for a second?
JACK
Sure, Bruce. What do you need?
BRUCE
Sweeps.
Jack takes his sandwich and leaves. Bobby leans to Bruce.
BOBBY
Don't worry about it.
I called my
aunt, we're on.
Bruce looks at Bobby, continues after and catches Jack.
BRUCE
Look, Jack. Hear me out, I'm
getting desperate man, I am pushing
forty and what have I got to show
for it? The point is, I've hit
some kind of a ceiling here. Some
kind of anti-Bruce barrierI And
Evan is just lovin' it, by the way.
He gets the good stories, he gets
on sweeps. Maybe I have to be more
like Evan.
JACK
You don't want to be like Evan.
Evan's an asshole.
BRUCE
I can be an asshole.
16.
JACK
No, Bruce.
You can't.
Bruce thinks, then flips Jack's sandwich plate over. It
scatters on the floor. Jack and Bruce stare at each other
for a beat.
JACK
Are you going to pick that up?
BRUCE
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Bruce bends down, starts picking up Jack's food.
BRUCE
It's just- this anchor position
looming, it's gotten me nuts...
He hands the plate to Jack, as sexy anchorwoman SUSAN ORTEGA
saunters by.
JACK
BRUCE
Hi, Susan.
Hi, Susan.
SUSAN ORTEGA
Hi, Jack.
Bruce blanches at this obvious snubbing.
JACK
Look, Bruce. You're a good
reporter. You make people laugh.
God knows today we can use it.
Bruce slumps, he's heard this a thousand times before.
*
JACK
*
(beat)
Alright, tell you what. It's the
*
23rd anniversary of the Maid of the
Mist. I want you at Niagara Falls
in an hour.
BRUCE
Maid of the Mist. That's always
live.
JACK
Yep.
BRUCE
Evan gets the live feeds.
17.
JACK
Well now you and Evan get the live
feeds.
BRUCE
I'm going live. In sweeps.
JACK
Yes, but watch yourself, Bruce.
I've seen your outtakes.
Bruce hugs Jack, pressing the sandwich against his chest.
BRUCE
Yes 1 You will not regret this,
Jack.
(releases Jack)
I will not forget you when I go
national.
Bruce takes off, Jack looks down, peels the sandwich off his
chest. We hear children's joyous SHRIEKS...
A COUPLE DOZEN KIDS playing at Grace's self-starter business,
a one room day care center filled with children and toys.
Grace turns, reacts.
GRACE
Martin, are you eating the glitter
again?
ON MARTIN - AN ADORABLE HISPANIC BOY
He shakes his head "no."
GRACE
Martin. Open your mouth. Abra su
boca.
He does. His tongue sparkles with glitter.
GRACE
Oh, you're not huh? Well, then
you've got a bad case of Liberace.
Grace's sister, Debbie, enters. She's wearing a nurse's
outfit. Her youngest, ZOE, 3, runs over to greet her.
ZOE
Mommy1
18.
GRACE
They didn't teach you Spanish in
nursing school, did they?
DEBBIE
Well, it seemed like they were
speaking a foreign language
sometimes, but no. Problemo?
GRACE
Martin has decided to explore new
food groups.
(back to Martin)
Martin, this is for art. Like this.
She spreads paste on the paper, sprinkles glitter.
DEBBIE
Is it so wrong to tie them up?
GRACE
D eb -- Ma rt i n!
Martin is busted with the paste spreader stuck in his mouth.
Grace snatches it.
GRACE
Okay, go rinse your mouth with
water. Lave su boca. Go.
(to Debbie)
I swear that kid is going to poop
an ornament.
DEBBIE
(laughs)
You're good with them, you know.
You should have some of your own.
GRACE
Don't start...
DEBBIE
Free milk cow.
GRACE
Debbie, don't call me that.
DEBBIE
If the moo fits.
The phone RINGS.
19.
GRACE
Saved by the bell.
Grab that for
me, will you?
Debbie does.
DEBBIE
Small Wonders Day Care.
The kids are gone. Grace watches the TV with a few other
teachers. She's concerned.
GRACE
Talk honey, talk.
Jack rushes in, looking at Bruce on the monitor.
JACK
What's going on?
24.
DIRECTOR
We've got a Walt Disney.
CONSOLE OPERATOR
Frozen solid.
JACK
He may not have audio. Check his
feed, have Susan cover.
Susan reacts to the message in her ear piece.
SUSAN
We may be having a bit of technical
difficulty...
Evan smiles in the background, clearly enjoying himself.
CONSOLE OPERATOR
Feed's good, Jack.
JACK
Come on, Bruce, talk damn-it...
Okay, get ready to pull the plug.
GRACE
Please baby, say something...
GRACE
Thank you, God.
25,
JACK
(sighs relief)
Thank God.
Jack pats the Director's shoulder, heads out of the room.
Jack rockets back into the room.
JACK
Did I just hear..?
BRUCE
Well, I guess that's the way life
works, isn't it? Some people are
drenched, freezing to death, on a
stupid boat, with a stupid
umbrella...
(heaves the umbrella)
while others who aren't fit to kiss
my willy, are sitting in a nice,
comfy news room, sucking up all the
glory111
26.
GRACE
This isn't happening. This isn't
happening...
All work has stopped. Stunned staffers stare at the monitor.
Jack stands with his jaw dropped, snaps out of it.
JACK
Alright, cut the feed! Cut to
black if you have to.
CONTROL BOOTH OPERATOR
I'm on it.
27.
Susan Ortega stares frozen blankly into camera.
SMASH CUT TO:
Bruce is pacing, holding an ICE PACK to his swollen lip.
GRACE
Thank God you're alright.
BRUCE
God, yeah. Let's thank God.
Thanks for everything, Lord. I am
so honored that my horrible demise
is a part of your loving and
mysterious plan.
GRACE
Bruce, don't talk like that.
BRUCE
Oh, don't worry, he's not
listening. If he is he doesn't
care. Have you seen the news
lately? We got gangs, we got
drugs, we got corruption. What
kind of God lets that happen?
Every time we cure a disease he
comes up with a new one!
(goes into God character)
Yeah, is this the lab? Yeah, it's
God. They've just come up with a
treatment for syphilis down there.
I think it's time to release the
tainted monkey. Oh, and there's a
guy in Ohio who's praying for
strength and wisdom, blind him and
cut off his legs.
GRACE
So God is torturing us?
BRUCE
Think about it, Grace. God is all-
powerful . He could fix everything
in five minutes if he wanted to.
(MORE)
29.
BRUCE (cont'd)
But he doesn't want to. He doesn't
like me.
Sam starts PEEING ON THE RUG.
BRUCE
Oh, Perfect!
(to the dog)
But you're aim isn't so good, I'm
over herel
GRACE
Bruce, please. This isn't his
fault.
BRUCE
Of course not.
(hushed tone)
It's part of the mysterious plan.
Grace puts Sam outside. Returns, trying to calm Bruce.
GRACE
Honey, you're mad right now. It's
understandable. And what Evan did
was slimy and wrong. But your job
doesn't matter to me. You matter
to me. You could've really been
hurt. I'm just glad you're okay.
BRUCE
Okay? News flash: I'm not okayi
And I'm not okay with the fact that
you think everything is okay. I'm
not okay with a mediocre job. I'm
not okay with a mediocre apartment.
I'm not okay with a mediocre LIFE!
Bruce angrily swipes at the table knocking the photos and the
photo albums to floor.
GRACE
Is that what you have, Bruce?
A mediocre life? Well, I'm sorry
for being a piece in your mediocre
puzzle.
BRUCE
Terrific. I'm drowning and you
throw me a brick!
Grace starts to cry.
30.
BRUCE
Perfect! I'll have the worst day
of my life with a side order of
guilt, please. I-- I don't need
this.
Bruce grabs his keys and heads out.
It's RAINING now. Bruce drives, going nowhere in particular.
His frustration is turning to desperation.
BRUCE
Okay, God. You want me to talk to
you? Then talk back. Tell me
what's going on? What should I
do? Give me a sign...
Bruce passes a BLINKING YELLOW CAUTION LIGHT, doesn't
notice. . .
BRUCE
I'm right here. Speak to me.
A PEDESTRIAN stepping into the crosswalk, steps back out of
the way.
PEDESTRIAN
SLOW DOWN, ASSHOLE!
Bruce is oblivious.
BRUCE
All I need is some guidance.
Please send me a signal.
A TRUCK TRANSPORTING VARIOUS ROAD SIGNS pulls in front of
Br uce . F our way s, bli nki ng. The va rie d s igns re ad: Yi eld ,
Wrong Way, Dead End, Do Not Enter, Stop.
BRUCE
Oh well, I guess you don't care.
Bruce spots the PRAYER BEADS hanging on the rearview mirror.
BRUCE
Okay, we'll do it your way.
(pulls the beads from the
mirror)
Lord, I need a miracle. Please
help me.
31.
He hits a bump and the BEADS DROP TO THE FLOOR.
Bruce
reaches down, fishes for the beads...
BRUCE
Come on, where'd you go?
(holds them up in triumph)
Ah ha! AHHH!
And BAM!11 BRUCE'S CAR SLAMS INTO A LIGHT POST.
Bruce wakes, slaps at the alarm clock, groggy, reaches for
the phone, finally realizes it's the beeper. He gets up,
begrudgingly, checks it. The same number.
32.
BRUCE
Well, hello again 772-5623, don't
hold your breath.
Bruce tosses the pager on the bed, heads for the bathroom.
The beeper BEEPS. Bruce stops in his tracks, turns, opens
the window, grabs the beeper and FIRES IT OUT. It SHATTERS
against a telephone pole. He calmly continues to the
bathroom.
A note is stuck in the bathroom mirror, with an old picture
of he and Grace in happier times. The note simply says:
"I LOVE YOU.
WE NEED TO TALK.
Grace"
Peering over top of the note, Bruce sees Sam circling on the
rug.
BRUCE
Oh, no.
A PHONE - BRUCE DIALS THE NUMBER
A PRERECORDED VOICE ANSWERS
33.
COMPUTERIZED VOICE
Denied that promotion at work? Is
life unfair? Everywhere you turn
is there someone less talented than
you reaping all the benefits ? Is
your name Bruce? Then do we have
the job for you. We're located at
77256 23rd Street...
Bruce reaches for a pen, begins jotting down the address.
COMPUTERIZED VOICE
So come on down, or we'll just keep
beepin' ya.
Bruce enters and checks the BUILDING DIRECTORY.
It reads:
OMNI PRESENTS UNLTD.
Pers onnel

Creativ e
Rm. 7
VOICE (O.S.)
You're looking for room 7.
Bruce turns to see a JANITOR mopping the floor.
He looks at
Bruce's wet leg, offers the mop.
JANITOR
Want me to even those up for you?
34.
BRUCE
(feigns a smile)
How would I get to room 7?
JANITOR
That'd be on the seventh floor.
Stairs are right over there.
BRUCE
What about the elevator?
He points to an elevator bank a couple of steps away.
JANITOR
Out of order.
Bruce heads for the stairs.
JANITOR
You mind giving me a hand with this
floor?
BRUCE
What? Yeah, I mind.
He continues on.
SEVENTH FLOOR
The stairwell door opens up to a LARGE ROOM with a SINGLE
DESK at the end of an otherwise empty space.
Bruce hears someone tinkering atop a tall ladder extending
into a hole in the ceiling.
BRUCE
Excuse me. Hello. I'm, ah,
looking for whoever runs this
joint...
MAN (O.S.)
Be right with y.a, just fixin' a
light. Tell me if it's working?
CLICK and an INSANELY BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT ILLUMINATES, shining
down blinding Bruce.
BRUCE
Yep, seems to be.
(wiping his eyes)
Kinda bright, though.
35.
An electrician, silhouetted in the bright light, descends the
ladder.
MAN (O.S.)
Yeah, it is for most people. They
spend their lives in the dark...
As he talks he steps down next to Bruce and we see that it is
the SAME JANITOR.
JANITOR (CONT'D)
. . . thinkin' they can hide from me.
The two stand, angelically illuminated.
Bruce tries to put
everything together.
BRUCE
Oh, the elevator's broken, huh?
JANITOR
Yeah, but I'll get around to it.
The Janitor CLAPS HIS HANDS TWICE and the light goes off.
BRUCE
You installed a clapper?
JANITOR
Nope.
Catchy jingle, though.
(sings)
CLAP ON. CLAP OFF.
CLAP ON, CLAP
OFF. THE CLAPPER.
(claps twice)
You can't get it out of your head.
BRUCE
I gotta go.
JANITOR
Okay, but the boss'11 be right out.
The Janitor unzips his uniform, revealing a very nice suit.
He extends his hand to Bruce.
JANITOR
You must be Bruce. I've been
expecting you.
BRUCE
Oh, this is hilarious. So you're
the boss and the electrician and
the janitor.
36.
JANITOR
Nothin' wrong with rollin' up your
sleeves, son. People underestimate
the benefits of good 'ol manual
labor. There's freedom in it.
Happiest people in the world stink
like hell at the end of the day.
He strolls down the room, takes a seat behind the big desk.
JANITOR
Your father knew that. He was a
damn good welder.
Bruce approaches the desk.
BRUCE
How do you know my father? And how
did you get my pager number?
JANITOR
Oh, I know a lot about you Bruce.
Pretty much everything there is to
know. Everything you've ever said,
done or thought about doin', is
right there in that file cabinet.
He points out a single drawer file cabinet.
BRUCE
(sarcastic)
Wow, a whole drawer. Just for me?
Mind if I take a look?
JANITOR
It's your life.
Bruce pulls the drawer and it FLIES OPEN, DRAGGING HIM THE
FULL LENGTH OF THE ROOM --
The Janitor casually pulls a file.
JANITOR
Now this last entry was a little
disturbing.
He thumps the file cabinet with his fist and the drawer
dramatically sucks closed, DRAGGING BRUCE BACK. The Janitor
reads from the file.
JANITOR
(reads, scanning)
Thanks for everything, Lord.
(MORE)
37.
JANITOR (cont'd)
I am so honored that my horrible
demise is a part of your loving and
mysterious plan.. The gloves are
off, pal.. Smite me oh mighty
smiter.
(aside)
I'm not much for blaspheming but
that one made me laugh. Oh, and
let's not forget "What kind of a
God would let this happen? I mean,
have you seen then news lately?"
Bruce stands, dazed. 
BRUCE
Who are you?
JANITOR
I'm the creator of the heavens and
the earth. I'm the alpha & omega.
The first and the last.
BRUCE
Sorry, it's not ringing a bell.
JANITOR/GOD
I'm God, Bruce.
BRUCE
Oh, you're God. Well that explains
everything1 That's how you know
everything about me. That's how
you got up to the seventh floor so
quickly.
(placating)
Well, it's really nice to meet you.
Thanks for the Grand Canyon and,
ah, good luck with the apocalypse.
Bruce turns to leave, BUT FINDS HIMSELF WALKING RIGHT TOWARD
GOD AND HIS DESK. He tries again, and again.
BRUCE
Okay, I don't know how you're doing
that, but I really gotta go. This
place is obviously rigged in some
way. We're on some freaky hidden
camera show.
(playing to the "cameras")
...for which I will not sign a
release, by the way! But you know
what, I'd be a little more
impressed if you didn't use the
cheesy file cabinet illusion.
(MORE)
38.
BRUCE
(cont'd)
Everyone with a
brain in their head
would know that
the drawer is being

fed through the
wall from behind--
Bruce pulls the file cabinet from the wall, sees it has a
normal back.
BRUCE
Okay.
That's good.
That's a good
one.
Bruce quickly puts his hands behind his back.
BRUCE
Okay, God. How many fingers am I
holding out?
Bruce extends three fingers.
GOD
Three.
He quickly pulls one finger in.
GOD
Two.
Bruce begins switching fingers rapidly.
God doesn't miss a
beat.
GOD
Four. Nine. Six. Eight. One...
One final attempt, Bruce holds seven fingers.
BRUCE
Okay, how about now.
He quickly pulls in two fingers.
GOD
Seven.
.BRUCE
AH HAl
Bruce proudly presents his single hand of five extended
fingers to God, then immediately notices he has SEVEN FINGERS
ON HIS ONE HAND.
BRUCE
AAAHHHl
39,
He shakes his fingers wildly and the two extra fingers
disappear. God approaches Bruce.
GOD
You've been doing a lot of
complaining about me, Bruce. And
quite frankly, I'm tired of it...
Bruce backs away from God.
BRUCE
You stay away from me! I don't
know what your doing. But whatever
you're doing is probably
actionable!
GOD
Well, that's not very neighborly.
I brought you here to offer you a
job.
BRUCE
Job? Wh at job?
GOD
My job. You think you can do it
better, so here's your chance.
When you leave this building you
will be endowed with all my powers.
BRUCE
Sure, whatever you say, Pal.
He turns to go but GOD STANDS BEFORE HIM in the Janitor
uniform, holding the mop.
GOD
All the power of God.
Bruce glances back at the empty desk, turns back again and
God the Janitor has also vanished. A beat, then Bruce
sprints out of the room.
Bruce jumps in, turns the key, the car turns over but doesn't
start.
BRUCE
I'm having a breakdown. That's
what it is. Just a normal,
everyday psychotic episode, brought
on by tumor or brain lesion...
We hear the car wind down to nothing. Bruce releases the key
pounds the steering wheel in frustration.
BRUCE
(to the car)
Come on, startI
The car INSTANTLY starts.
BRUCE
(denial)
Well, that was lucky.
Bruce backs up, peels out.
MUSIC UP: "HE'S GOT THE WHOLE WORLD IN HIS HANDS"
Bruce quickly walks to a back corner booth. The only other
patron is an OLD MAN seated at the counter.
BRUCE
It isn't real, it isn't real, it
isn't real...
An older. Sally Kirkland-type WAITRESS, order pad in hand,
stands listening to Bruce with a raised eyebrow.
BRUCE
Oh hi, ah, coffee please.
The waitress pours him a cup.
42.
WAITRESS
We've got a special on soup today.
BRUCE
No, that's okay.
WAITRESS
It's tomato.
BRUCE
Alright, okay.
She heads off.
Bruce sits thinking.
Could it be real?
He looks at the SUGAR down at the end of the table, holds out
his hand and the SUGAR SLIDES ACROSS THE TABLE RIGHT INTO HIS
HAND. The CREAMER slides into his other hand.
Bruce is half scared, half thrilled. He pours some cream and
sugar into his cup, looks around the table.
BRUCE
Excuse me I need a spoooo...
Bruce chokes up a spoon into his hands, wipes it off with his
napkin.
BRUCE
That's alright, I found one.
The Old Man eyes Bruce suspiciously, gets up and moves
further down the counter.
The Waitress sets down the soup, heads off, then turns back.
WAITRESS
I lie to my sister.
BRUCE
What?
WAITRESS
(becoming emotional)
And I'm sleeping with my best
friend's husband. I know he's just
using me but.. I'm just so tired of
being alone. I don't know why I'm
telling you all this. Just seems
like you'd understand.
BRUCE
Okay.
43.
WAITRESS
(sets the check down)
Take care of that whenever you're
ready.
Bruce looks at the soup. His look grows intense.
He slowly
raises his hands over the soup bowl....
MUSIC UP: THE TEN COMMANDMENTS THEME
The front door blows open, as A WIND SWIRLS through the diner
and with all the flourish of Moses at the Red Sea, BRUCE
PARTS HIS RED SOUP.
A little cockroach scurries across the table, climbs up the
edge of the bowl and walks through to the other side.
GOD (O.S.)
Havin' fun?
Bruce is startled and the soup splashes back to normal
collapsing on the cockroach. He looks up at God standing
beside the booth. Bruce is now awestruck.
BRUCE
You- He- Thy...
GOD
Let's take a walk.
Grace and Debbie stand at the check-out stand. Grace flips
through a celeb magazine, as Debbie places the last few items
from the cart to the conveyor belt.
In the background, throughout, Debbie's daughter, Zoe is
grabbing random items off the shelves and placing them on the
belt.
GRACE
(re: magazine)
Gosh, this girl is so talented and
all they ever talk about is her
hair.
46.
DEBBIE
Yeah, she should marry somebody
famous, take the focus off.
Grace checks her cell phone screen.
DEBBIE
We would have heard it ring.
GRACE
I know. It's just that he usually
calls during the day.
DEBBIE
He just needs to blow off some
steam, he'll be fine.
GRACE
I hope so. I've never seen him
*
that mad. An d I lashed back--
*
DEBBIE
Wow, you lashed? You never lash.
I'm impressed.
GRACE
I feel bad for him.
He's wanted
anchor for so long.
Zoe begins pulling groups of items onto the belt.
DEBBIE
Well, I've been praying to win the
lottery for fifteen years, but it's
not going to happen. You know,
it's not all about money.
The CLERK finishes ringing the last item.
CLERK
That'll be four hundred and twenty-
seven, eighty.-
DEBBIE
What?!
Debbie looks in a bag, pulls out a handful of various counter
items. Zoe giggles and proudly holds up one of the hundred
or so Tic-Tac mint containers.
DEBBIE
Zoe.
(to Clerk)
(MORE)
47.
DEBBIE (cont'd)
Hang on, I might need you to un-
check a few things.
The people in line hem and haw, exasperated.
GUY IN LINE
Come on, lady.
DEBBIE
(snaps)
Hey, everybody back-off i
Zoe laughs, enjoying the commotion.
GRACE
Listen, I better get back. I want
to be there for him.
DEBBIE
You're a saint, Grace.
GRACE
What can I say, I love him. And if
I know Bruce, he's out there
wandering around with the weight of
the world on his shoulders.
CUT T0:
Grace sits on the floor next to the coffee table with a box
of photos working on the album. She takes a sip of wine,
sets down the glass. Sam walks over and laps up the wine.
GRACE
(to Sam)
Well, at least I have someone to
drink with.
Grace hears Bruce coming up the stairs, singing.
51.
BRUCE
What if God was one of us. . .
Just a slob like one of us...
Just a stranger on a bus...
Trying to make his way. . .
Grace reacts a bit surprised by Bruce's happy tone, she gets
up, opens the door and there stands BRUCE, beaming smile,
holding a very unique BOUQUET OF FLOWERS.
BRUCE
(finishing song)
...home.
GRACE
(re: the flowers)
Oh, my God.
BRUCE
You can call me Bruce.
GRACE
Where have you been? You're
so...happy.
BRUCE
Who wouldn't be on a night like
this?
(holding out the flowers)
For you.
Grace takes the flowers, gives Bruce a kiss, still sizing up
his mood.
GRACE
These are amazing. What are they?
BRUCE
It's a totally new breed. A cross
pollination between tulips and
Daisies. I call them Todayzees.
GRACE
Todayzees? Okay...
Grace goes to put them in water.
GRACE
Bruce, is there something you're
not telling me?
52.
BRUCE
Nothing of this world. Why?
GRACE
What do you mean, why? Last night
you weren't exactly happy with
life.
BRUCE
Last night, I was only human.
Bruce backs out of the kitchen seductively.
Bruce breezes through, casually instructs the stereo as he
passes.
BRUCE
CD 4, Track 7.
The Stereo illuminates and Barry White music plays.
Grace grabs a neglige from the drawer, heads into the
bathroom. Bruce enters, adjusts the ambience of the room,
BLOWS THE LIGHTS OUT with a quick puff of air, LIGHTS CANDLES
with a gesture. His clothes magically fall away.
Grace slips her neglige on, begins brushing her hair.
GRACE
I'11 be out in a minute.
BRUCE (O.S.)
*
Don't rush yourself. Sometimes
*
anticipation can heighten the
*
pleasure.
*
Grace SHUDDERS a bit at the word "pleasure", quickly finishes *
brushing, picks up her lipstick.
*
BRUCE (O.S.)
*
It's a funny thing about, pleasure.
*
GRACE'S KNEES BUCKLE, causing the lipstick to smear across *
her face. She sits down on the toilet seat to get a hold of *
herself.
*
BRUCE (O.S.)
*
It can be extremely pleasurable.
*
Grace has a very POWERFUL ORGASM and slides off the toilet *
out of frame to the ground.
*
GRACE
*
(out of control)
*
Oh, oh. Oh my...
*
CUT TO:
*
54.
BRUCE
Standing at the door with both arms extended toward the
bathroom like an WARLOCK CASTING A SPELL. Suddenly the light
hits him from the open bathroom door and he quickly strikes a
casual pose.
Grace stands in the open doorway, panting like an animal.
She dives on Bruce, attacking him.
ON TV - THE MORNING NEWS
MORNING REPORTER
In international news, Japanese
relief workers are staging a
desperate effort to rescue hundreds
of people stranded by a freak tidal
wave that hit Kitamoto City...
We see remote footage of Japanese families being airlifted
from root tops.
MORNING REPORTER
Scientists say the tsunami may have
been caused by what they're
describing as "unusual lunar
activity." More on this, as it
develops. . .
Grace half watches the newscast as she finishes breakfast.
Bruce lies blissfully asleep. Big smile, life is good.
Then, we hear WHISPERING - Like distant voices MURMURING all
at once. Bruce wakes with a start. He looks around puzzled,
sticks his finger in his ear checking his hearing as the
voices fade away.
ANGLE - SAM
Circling, getting ready to go on the carpet. Bruce casually
warns.
BRUCE
Sam. Uh uh uh.
55.
Sam looks at Bruce for a beat, then
walks into bathroom,
raises the toilet seat with his nos e, and STANDS UP ON HIS
TWO HIND LEGS, HOLDING HIS SNAUSAGE WITH HIS FRONT PAWS (NO,
WE DON'T SEE IT) AND STARTS TO GO.
He looks proudly back at
Bruce.
BRUCE
Good boy.
Grace places breakfast on the table. Bruce comes out, fully
dressed with a spring in his step.
BRUCE
Good morning.
GRACE
(gushy-lovey, sing songy)
Good morning. Cooked you grilled
cheese.
BRUCE
Oo, my favey.
Bruce sits, Grace sets down his plate, leans close.
GRACE
Last night was just...
BRUCE
Heavenly?
GRACE
Mmm hmm.
Bruce enjoys his grilled cheese.
GRACE
It's funny, but when I woke up this
morning, It felt like my boobs were
bigger.
Bruce looks away, guilty, trying to be nonchalant.
GRACE
(holding them up)
Do they look bigger to you?
BRUCE
Huh? Ah, no, they, ah, look the
same to me.
56.
They aren't.
They are clearly bigger.
She holds them.
GRACE
They're definitely bigger.
They
feel huge to me.
Bruce throws up his hands.
BRUCE
You got me. Probably just a
hormonal thing.
(takes a quick final bite)
Well, enjoy your breakfast, I've
gotta run.
GRACE
Where are you going?
He stops, turns. A new confident Bruce.
BRUCE
To get my job back.
MUSIC UP:
CLOSE ON - BRUCE
He gets in, fastens his seat belt, as two teenagers cruise by
on skateboards, stop outside Bruce's window.
TEENAGER
(sincerely impressed)
Wow, nice car man.
BRUCE
Well, it gets me from A to B.
MASTER - STREET
Reveal Bruce's car is now a brand new MERCEDES 2003 VISION
SLR. He starts and revs THE POWERFUL NEW ENGINE and peels
out.
57.
Bruce cruises through the office, fielding greetings.
60.
VARIOUS OFFICE STAFF
Nice Job, Bruce...Way to go,
buddy...GO get 'em, Bruce, etc.
Susan Ortega smooths up to Bruce.
SUSAN ORTEGA
Hi, Bruce.
BRUCE
(surprised)
Oh, Susan.. Hi.
SUSAN ORTEGA
Good work, I'm impressed.
She give's Bruce a "look" and continues on. Bruce is a bit
inflated by the encounter.
Bobby the pastry cart guy wheels his cart up along side.
BOBBY
Hey, Br uce . N ice job , m an. Wa sn' t
the same without you around here,
pal.
(leading)
I hear Jack wants to see you.
BRUCE
That's the word.
BOBBY
You're going to need your energy in
there. Can I interest you in a
donut?
BRUCE
No, thank you, I'm not hungry.
BOBBY
Coffee?
BRUCE
No.
BOBBY
Fiber grain bar with bee pollen and
Spiralina?
BRUCE
I'm really not interested.
61.
BOBBY
Yeah, I don't blame 'ya, they taste
like grass.
Bobby CUTS BRUCE OFF WITH HIS CART.
Bruce is forced to stop.
BOBBY
Tell you
what? I wasn't going to
break it
open until lunch time, but
I made a
batch of rhubarb that you
have got
to try.
BRUCE
Bobby, I--
BOBBY
Come on, it's my mother's recipe
she's practically cripple...
Bobby forces a ladle of rhubarb out at Bruce.
BRUCE
No, I really- no...
BOBBY
Open up, that's it, here comes the
news chopper...
(makes sound of Chopper)
BRUCE
No, Bobby.. Bobby N01 I said I
didn't want anything.
(turns, heading off)
Damn you...
Bruce continues
off, as Bobby stops cold, adopts an odd
expression, then
his EYES ROLL UP IN THEIR SOCKETS, SPIN ALL
THE WAR AROUND,
THEN GLOW RED. LITTLE HORN BUMPS PUSH UP
FROM HIS SKULL.
He turns instantly demonic.
An overly PERKY FEMALE OFFICE WORKER approaches Bobby from
behind.
FEMALE OFFICE WORKER
Hi, Bobby. Is there any of that
split pea soup left?
She is instantly hit in the chest with a stream of green
vomit. A beat and Bobby offers out a plastic spoon.
ON JACK

He sees Bruce enter, immediately perks up.

BRUCE

(laughing along with him)
*
Ha!
What are the odds?

JACK
Look, I'll be straight. We want
you back, Bruce. I want to tell
you, it wasn't my decision to let
you go. When the big guy gives the
order, I gotta...
BRUCE
No harm no foul, Jack. I needed
some time off to reassess my goals
and get in touch with my true self.
JACK
You did that in a day?
BRUCE
Imagine what I can do with seven.
Jack pauses for an awkward beat.
His face grows serious.
JACK
I haven't been the best father in
the world.
BRUCE
What's that?
JACK
I cur se a lo t. I c hea t on my

BRUCE
Oh, I'm busy doing...things.
Jack recovers, rejuvenated.
63.
JACK
Yeah, I gotcha. It feels good to
get that out. Thank you.
Jack gives Bruce a big hug.
JACK
Look,
it's not in my power to give
you a
nchor, but as far as field
repor
ting goes, if you're looking
for a
bump.
BRUCE
Jack, don't worry about that. Just
give me a camera and a crew and
I'll give you the news.
Bruce exits.
Jack likes the new Bruce.
Bruce heads out as The Eyewitness News opening plays on
several monitors. Susan Ortega opens.
SUSAN
Good evening and welcome to
Eyewitness News at six. I'm Susan
Ortega.
EVAN
And I'm Evan Baxter. And here's
what's making news...
This stops Bruc e. He watc hes Evan on a newsr oom monit or. A
devilish smile forms on Bruce's face.

Buffalo P.D. surfaced today when...
Evan's voice suddenly becomes HIGH PITCHED, like a girls.
EVAN

gets up, tries to help.
SUSAN
Somebody get some napkins.

Evan's hair IGNITES.

His hair's on fire!
Dallas runs off.
BRUCE

staffer)
You know, he does have a certain
pizazz about him.
66.
Susan reaches for a water pitcher, as a crew man steps in and
BLASTS Evan's head with a fire extinguisher. Evan is in
shock, his face now white.
The screen cuts to a "PLEASE STAND-BY" title card, then cuts
to an episode of "Dragnet."
ON BRUCE - It's fun to be God.
MUSIC UP/MONTAGE UP
Bruce sits watching a hockey game on TV. He follows the puck
intently with his eyes, as though controlling it's path.

Bruce diverts his attention, when the Sabers screw up and the
crowd GROANS. Bruce immediately turns, looks intently at the
puck and GOAL, SABERS! THE CROWD ROARS!

MUSIC OUT/MONTAGE OUT
Grace lies in full body wrap, while Debbie is in the process
of being wrapped by MARGARITA, a rather ruff Spanish Salon
attendant.
DEBBIE
So this is what success buys you.
GRACE
I guess.
(wiggling around)
I feel like a human taquito.
DEBBIE
Well, thank Mr. Exclusive for me.
He's on a quite a roll. What'd he
do make a deal with the devil?
GRACE
And he's taking me out tonight to
dinner at Chez L'Amour.
DEBBIE
Well, la-ti-da. Mike's idea of a
romantic evening is Chez Sizzler.
Margarita pulls the wrap tightly around Debbie.
DEBBIE
(to Margarita)
What does this do again?
MARGARITA
EstS para su grasa.
DEBBIE
Grasa? Doesn't that mean fat?
71.
GRACE
Afraid so.
Debbie eyes Margarita.
GRACE
(gushing)
So, Bruce said and I quote:
"Prepare yourself for an amazing
evening that will change our lives
forever."
Margarita reaches Debbie's waist and YANKS tightly.
DEBBIE
Good - you wouldn't want to leave
any spare oxygen in there.
(back to Grace)
Wait a second, you don't think he's
going to propose, do you?
GRACE
I don't think anything.
DEBBIE
You do. You think he's going to
propose.
GRACE
Well, he's always said when he gets
his career together, you know...
And his career is more than
together. I mean, come on, Chez
L'Amour. Change our lives...
DEBBIE
I don't know, hun. I mean, I like
Bruce but that man's priority list
is him, him, him, then him some
more and then you.
GRACE
Well, he just might surprise you.
DEBBIE
That's what I'm worried about.
(re: Margarita)
Careful, you missed a spot of free
flowing circulation.
Margarita senses the attitude and pulls tighter. Debbie
reacts.
72.
DEBBIE
That'd do it.
Margarita motions for Debbie to lay down and leaves.
Debbie
struggles to lay down.
DEBBIE
Let's see, how do I--
Debbie slides to the ground, Grace cracks up, gets up to
help, but also in mummy wrap, topples on top of her. They
both laugh and struggling to get up.
Hearing the ruckus, Margarita enters and gasps.
MARGARITA
Lesbianas1
Grace and Debbie crack up harder.
DEBBIE
Hey, I'll take that over fat...
Margarita tries to pull them up, but falls too.
MARGARITA
No sexo, no sexol
Grace and Debbie can't stop laughing.
A waiter pours the first trickle of wine into Bruce's glass.
Bruce whiffs it, tastes it.
BRUCE
Very good. If you run out just
bring me some water, I'll take it
from there.
Grace looks over the menu as Bruce notices people at various
tables eyeing him. He glances up to a ceiling light and
REDIRECTS IT with his mind, so it SPOTLIGHTS HIM in golden
light.
TWO CUTE GIRLS with dates SMILE and wave.
He waves back.
GRACE
Should we ask for a more private
table?
73,
BRUCE
Huh? Oh, no this is fine right
here.
Bruce looks at Grace lovingly.
He takes her hand.
BRUCE
I was going to wait until after the
meal, but I think it's going to
just bust out of me if I don't do
it now.
Grace beams, looks at Bruce with total love.
BRUCE
You ready?
GRACE
(nervous)
I think so.
BRUCE
I got anchor.
Grace's face falls.
She does her best to cover.
BRUCE
Evidently, they're having problems
with Evan. He's finishing up the
week and I go live Monday.
GRACE
That's great, honey.
Congratulations. Wow. So that's
what's tonight is about?
BRUCE
Well, yeah. Grace, I got anchor.
We got anchor!
She's having a hard time covering her let down.
BRUCE
(noticing her flat
reaction)
What's the matter?
GRACE
Well, to be honest, I thought that
maybe tonight, you--
The TWO CUTE GIRLS interrupt, approach Bruce.
74.
CUTE GIRL #1
I'm sorry, but we had to come over.
We just think you're amazing and...
CUTE GIRL #2
Well, we can't believe it's you!
They both laugh, Bruce enjoys the attention.
BRUCE
(laughing along)
Yep, it's me.
CUTE GIRL #1
Can we get a picture with you?
BRUCE
Well, sure.
(glances to Grace)
Just one second, hun.
(leans to Grace)
Fans. We better get used to this,
huh?
Grace sits watching the two girls take turns sitting on
Bruce's lap, taking pictures. Sees Bruce relishing in the
attention. One girl gives Bruce a peck on the cheek and they
r"sS!w^w!s
leave. Grace is clearly upset.
GRACE
You have lipstick on your face.
BRUCE
Oh, thanks...
GRACE
Bruce, we need to talk. I thought
we had an understanding--
Suddenly, the WHISPERS start again. Bruce looks around,
figures it's coming from the restaurant patrons.
BRUCE
Wow. It's kind of loud in here.
Grace looks around the quiet romantic setting.
GRACE
What are you talking about? It's
not loud.
The WHISPERS GROW IN VOLUME.
75.
BRUCE
Geez...
(shouts to the restaurant)
-----
- COULD YOU ~KEEP TT DOWNl---

GRACE
Bruce, this isn't funny.
BRUCE
(talking loud .over the
"racket")
WHAT? WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME FOR A
SECOND?
He gets up and darts off.
Bruce races through the restaurant kitchen holding his ears -
*
Grace is asleep in the bedroom while Bruce paces in the
*
living room.
*
BRUCE
*
Okay...Prayers.
*
He concentrates for a second and in an instant, the WHISPERS
*
start in.
BRUCE
Okay, first off, this creepy
whisper thing has got to go.
(paces)
Organization and management. I
need a system. Something
concrete...
(an idea)
*
Prayer files 1

Let all prayers be organized into

*
Bruce WAVES HIS HAND---
*
Instantly, the room is JAMMED FULL OF FILE. CABINETS.
*
BRUCE
*
Too b ulky. Ah! Praye r po st-it s!
*
Instantly, the files are gone and millions of POST-IT'S, EACH *
WITH A PERSON'S PRAYER REQUEST begin slapping down attaching *
themselves to everything in the room.
*
Bruce himself becomes a big post-it mummy. He pulls the one *
covering his mouth.

A COMPUTER PROGRESS BAR titled "Downloading Prayers" appears

BRUCE - MORNING

He's fallen asleep by the computer. As he wakes he sees:
*
"1,567,432 unread messages"
*
BRUCE
*
Whoa.
*
Suddenly, Grace bounds out of the bathroom.
*
GRACE
Okay, this is getting ridiculous I
Grace's boobs are enormous! A healthy D-cup.
GRACE
I have to see a doctor. There's
definitely something wrong with me.
*
Bruce jumps up from the computer, hides what he's doing...
BRUCE
No.
You look great.
GRACE
I look like a hooker I My whole
body is changing.
She turns profile, her back sways causing her ass to stick
out.
GRACE
My back didn't used to arch like
this.
Bruce gets up, walks to Grace.
BRUCE
I think you look amazing.
*
81.
GRACE
Bruce, I feel like our relationship
is becoming all about sex.
BRUCE
No it's not. Come on, give me a
*
hug.
GRACE
No, Bruce. Come on.
*
She breaks away and sees the computer is on.
*
GRACE
*
What's that? What are you doing?
*
Bruce tries to cover.
*
BRUCE
*
Oh, ah. Nothing. Surfing the
*
*
internet...for stories...
GRACE
*
Is this why you didn't come to bed?
*
BRUCE
*
No, ah...Honey, you're going to be
*
late.
GRACE
No, I'm not.
Bruce looks over Grace's shoulder and ADJUSTS THE CLOCK FORTY
MINUTES FORWARD. Grace turns and is surprised.
GRACE
Oh my goshI How did I sleep this
late? I've got to run. Are you
giving me a ride?
BRUCE
Don't need to.
Bruce motions to the window. Grace walks over, looks out and

Bruce smiles.

GRACE DRIVES OFF IN HER NEW CAR
Bruce turns away from the window, gets back to the computer.
BRUCE

Okay. Let's start with something

easy.

Please make the Sabers win the
playoffs, good. Please, please let
the Red Wings beat the Sabers.
Bruce puzzles over the two prayers.

Bruce sits at the computer, looks at the total prayer

Oh, come on. What a bunch of

Are you

doing a story here?

BRUCE

(coy)

No. Guess again?

Grace turns to Bruce confused.
BRUCE
It's mine...ours.
88.
GRACE
What?
BRUCE
(beaming)
This is our new home.
Come on...
Bruce pulls Grace up the stairs.
GRACE
This had to cost-- I can't even
imagine how much this had to cost.
BRUCE
7 million. That was the asking,
but I got a deal.
GRACE
Wh-What am I missing here? You
can't afford this. You're a
reporter. Buying cars is one
t hing, but this--
Bruce grabs a hold of Grace.
BRUCE
We'll have the money. Listen to me
closely. I'm getting anchor.
Then, I'm going to get spotted,
offers will come flooding in to go
national, and then you and I are
moving to New York City to a place
that will put this to shame. This
has been my exact dream my whole
life and it's finally going to
happen. Every step just how I
pictured it.
Grace just stares at Bruce.
GRACE
There's only one problem.
BRUCE
What?
GRACE
I hate it.
Bruce is surprised.
89.
GRACE
What were you thinking? Why didn't
*
you talk to me about this?
*
BRUCE
*
I wanted to surprise you.
*
GRACE
*
Mission accomplished.
*
BRUCE
Honestly, I thought you'd be a
little more appreciative.
GRACE
Appreciative of what? The fact
that you didn't include me on a
major life decision or that we now
live in the Sultan of Bernai's
*
house?
*
BRUCE
(under his breath)
Like pearls to swine.
GRACE
What is that supposed to mean?
BRUCE
Let those with ears hear.
GRACE
What is happening to you? You're
changing.
BRUCE
Exa ct ly. F or th e bet te r. I' m not
poor and s truggling . And mayb e
that threatens you. I'm telling
you, there are plenty of women who
would love this place.
GRACE
Yeah, and so would their pimps.

I can't believe this. I did all

this for us.

'That'. You can't even say the

BRUCE
*
Marriage, I want marriage, okay.

It's just not a great time right
now.
GRACE
Not a great time. What is that,
your mantra? This is never going

Grace heads down the stairs.

BRUCE
Come on Grace, lighten up.

Tomorrow's Saturday. The office is

throwing me a party here, for
getting anchor. Let's enjoy the
ride for a whi le. We're just
starting to have some fun.
GRACE
No, you're just starting to have
fun.
Suddenly, the TOILET FLUSHES off camera. Grace sees Sam in
the bathroom spraying some deodorizer before he exits.
GRACE
And what in God's name is going on
with that dogI?
Grace pulls her cell phone .out of her purse, heads for the
door.
GRACE
I'm going to have Debbie pick me
up.

BRUCE
Bless you. Bless you.
PARTYING SPORTS GUY
Hey Bruce, who do you like in the
game tonight?
BRUCE
Put your money on the Sabers.
Coach prays a lot.
A FRENCH WAITER approaches Bruce.
FRENCH WAITER
Ah, Mr. Nolan, we're running out of
hors doerves. I'm afraid we under-
ordered, sir. And the people are
hungry.
BRUCE
What do you have left?
The Waiter holds up a small basket.
FRENCH WAITER
Only three chips and two shrimp.
BRUCE
(confident)
Just take it around.
The Waiter gets a confused look.
CUT TO:
CHIPS OVERFLOWING, SHRIMP SPILLING OUT OF BASKETS, HANDS
REACHING GLUTTONOUSLY FOR THE BOUNTY.
The Waiter walks along amazed as handfuls of shrimp and chips
are pulled from the small basket.
Partiers crowd around Bruce, start to chant.
93.
CROWD
Speech!
Speech!!
Speech!
Bruce takes center stage, quiets the crowd.
BRUCE
I ' d thank you all for coming, but
the liquor is free so maybe you
should THANK ME!
Everyone laughs.
BRUCE
And now let me tell you a story.
There was a man who had two sons.
The younger son took his
inheritance and squandered his
money on a life of lust and
debauchery. I LOVE THAT GUY!!
Everyone throws their hands up and continues to party.
Bruce's big smile fades. He looks around the room, hoping to
spot Grace. He grabs a phone, walks out to the balcony,
di al s --
He gets their answering machine, hears their outgoing message
together from happier times. He hangs up.
FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
Hey there.
Bruce turns, sees SUSAN ORTEGA, completely stunning in a sexy
dress.
SUSAN
Hi Br uce. What are you d oing out
here all alone?
BRUCE
Oh, ah, I was calling Grace.
SUSAN
Yeah, I didn't see her in there. I
love the new place, by the way. So
how are you and Grace doing?
BRUCE
I don't know, we had a fight
earlier. Ever since I . . Well,
things are different now and...
94.
SUSAN
You're on fire Bruce. Some women
can't handle fire. Some can.
Susan smooths close to Bruce.
SUSAN
You know, I always had an instinct
about you. I knew you were going
to make something of yourself.
BRUCE
Really?
SUSAN
There's something special about you
Bruce. I like special...
BRUCE
Look Susan, I don't know, I--
Susan grabs Bruce, kisses him passionately. Bruce doesn't
join in, but doesn't fight it either.
ANGLE - THE FRONT DOOR
Grace and Debbie enter.
DEBBIE
So this is your new place, huh?
GRACE
Cozy, don't you think? Come on
help me find him.
They head into the room.
DEBBIE
You sure you want to do this?
GRACE
I don't know. It's his big night.
*
I don't want to spoil it. I know
.
*
how much this means to him.
*
DEBBIE
*
*
So much for lashing back...
Grace stops dead in her tracks. Her face drops.
GRACE'S POV - BRUCE, still lip-locked with Susan Ortega.
95.
DEBBIE
Oh, boy.
Bruce turns and sees Grace.
BRUCE
Grace, I...
GRACE
. (fighting back tears)
Get the car, Deb.
DEBBIE
Right.
BRUCE
Grace, wait.
Grace follows Debbie out.
Bruce walks in, Susan is waiting for him.
SUSAN
I was right. She couldn't handle
the fire.
*
Bruce looks at Susan with disgust, then glances to a FIRE
ALARM on the wall, mentally TRIGGERS IT. The sprinklers turn
on, as well. People scream, rush toward the exit.
Bruce sits down on the sofa, being rained on by the
sprinklers, alone. He finally plops back and God is sitting
next to him.
GOD
Enjoying your party? Yeah, nothing
like spending time with some real
frien ds. Any s hrimp left ?
BRUCE
Grace left me.
GOD
I know.
BRUCE
(certain)
She'll take me back.
(uncertain)
Will she take me back?
GOD
Would you take you back?
Bruce mulls this over,- then...
BRUCE
How do you make someone love you
when you can't effect free will?
GOD
Welcome to my world, son. You come
up with an answer to that one, you
let me know.
Off of Bruce thinking...
CUT TO:
98.
Grace's alarm goes off. The radio comes on and it plays a
John Cougar Mellencamp song. But the lyrics are different.
JOHN COUGAR MELLENCAMP
Here's a little ditty,
about Grace and her man Bruce,
two Americans growing up,
needing to make a truce.
Grace's eyes pop open.
Is she dreaming?
Grace reaches in her purse to pay for her coffee and a bunch
of PICTURES FALL OUT. They are all of Bruce and Grace. She
thinks, definitely didn't -put them there.
Grace is helping one of the kids, when she notices something
outside the window. It's a cloud formation that strangely
looks like BRUCE (in profile) HOLDING HANDS WITH GRACE. She
reacts as the imagery melts away into a very faint "FORGIVE
HIM."
The PRISONERS drive off laughing.
PRISONER #1
Ha, nice wheels, huh?
BRUCE sits up in the back seat.
BRUCE
Thou shalt not steal.
The prisoners JUMP.
BRUCE
Car, show them the way out.
Instantly, the car doors fly open and the seats tilt sideways
dumping the prisoners.
BRUCE
What is wrong with the world?
