               TINKLING SOUNDS. Maybe wind chimes. CU on a blue sphere.

               PULL BACK to REVEAL a bowling ball. PAN ACROSS to outstretched 
               fingers, a wrist, an arm, a shoulder, onto the angelic FACE 
               of a young thirteen year old Black male. His eyes open, 
               surprised. An angry red pool of blood halos his head. ME 
               ETCHES are pulling a body bag around the TORSO of the thirteen 
               year old, watched by ALYSSA DYER, Assistant Medical Examiner. 
               PATRONS, stunned, in shock, herded behind yellow crime scene 
               tape. The TINKLING SOUNDS comes from automatic pin setting 
               machines. PEMBLETON bends down to count shell casings. BAYLISS 
               examines BODY.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Three shell casings. Twenty-two 
                         caliber.

                                     BAYLISS
                         Powder burns. Close contact wound. 
                         Half-circle muzzle imprint. Someone 
                         jammed the barrel right up against 
                         this kid's head.

                                     PEMBLETON
                              (beat, sighs)
                         Serious intentions.

               DYER hands BAYLISS a wallet.

                                     DYER
                         We found this on the boy.

               BAYLISS opens it, pulls out YMCA card, reads.

                                     BAYLISS
                         Darryl Nawls.

               On PEMBLETON, gazing down at the dead BOY,

                                                                    CUT TO:


               MUNCH and LEWIS walk in. A half-dozen WOMEN of various ages 
               await them, sitting at tables just inside the door.

                                     MUNCH
                         Good morning one and all.

               The WOMEN remain expressionless, eyeing MUNCH and LEWIS. 
               MUNCH and LEWIS walk down to the end of the bar.

                                     MUNCH
                         Remember. Who we hire directly 
                         reflects who we are. We proceed with 
                         all due care and consideration.

                                     LEWIS
                         Right.

               LEWIS opens a folder, takes out copies of an employment 
               application, walks over and hands them out to the WOMEN.

                                     LEWIS
                         If you would be so kind as to fill 
                         out this paper. It concerns your 
                         previous employment history.

               WOMAN #1, a willowy, long haired brunette with translucent 
               skin, her eyes deep with pools of poetry, turns to LEWIS.

                                     WOMAN #1
                         You got a pen?

                                     LEWIS
                         Sure sure.

               LEWIS reaches into his pockets, searches for a pen. No pen. 
               He looks back to MUNCH, motions for a pen. MUNCH searches 
               through his pockets. No pen.

                                     LEWIS
                         Anyone here have a spare pen or 
                         pencil?

               WOMAN #2, mid-twenties, raises her hand.

                                     WOMAN #2
                         I need something to write with, too.

                                     LEWIS
                         Anyone else?

               The other remaining WOMEN all raise their hands. On MUNCH 
               and LEWIS, as the business grinds to a halt,

                                                                    CUT TO:


               MUNCH and LEWIS sit at table in the dining area. WOMAN #2 
               walks up to MUNCH and LEWIS, holding her employment 
               application. She hands it to LEWIS. He scans the form.

                                     LEWIS
                         Thank you.

                                     MUNCH
                         Please. Have a seat.

               WOMAN #2 sits, nervously shifts around in her seat. LEWIS 
               reads application.

                                     LEWIS
                         You've had a lot of jobs.

                                     WOMAN #2
                         Uh-huh.

                                     LEWIS
                         You've worked Duda's, John Steven's, 
                         Fletcher's...

                                     WOMAN #2
                         Just about every restaurant and bar 
                         in Baltimore.

                                     MUNCH
                              (reading over LEWIS' 
                              shoulder)
                         Is there any reason you've never 
                         worked any job longer than three 
                         weeks?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               WOMAN #3, grandmotherly-type, beehive hairdo.

                                     WOMAN #3
                         One rule I don't abide by is: The 
                         customer is always right. The customer 
                         is never right.

               MUNCH and LEWIS arch their eyebrows.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               WOMAN #1 has a canvas tote bag slung over her shoulder.

                                     WOMAN #1
                         I'm really not a waitress.

                                     MUNCH
                         Oh?

               WOMAN #1 rustles through her tote bag, extracts a thick 
               binder, hands it to MUNCH.

                                     WOMAN #1
                         I write. One-acts.

                                     MUNCH
                         Hunh, one-act plays.

                                     WOMAN #1
                         Read them and we'll talk about them, 
                         okay?

                                     LEWIS
                         You're a writer and you had to ask 
                         for a pen?

                                     WOMAN #1
                         My life is total irony.

                                     MUNCH
                         And all in one act, huh?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               WOMAN #3 sits in front of LEWIS and MUNCH.

                                     WOMAN #3
                         At my tables, it's a two-drink limit. 
                         I tell 'em, you want more, there's 
                         the door. I do not tolerate boozers, 
                         especially those vodka drinkers. 
                         First drink, they're so tall.
                              (holds hands over 
                              head)
                         Second drink, they think they're 
                         some kind of John Wayne giants. When 
                         I hear, "Howdy, Pilgrim," I know 
                         it's time to haul out the baseball 
                         bat.

               As MUNCH and LEWIS stare at WOMAN #3,

                                                                    CUT TO:


               A small, twenty-seat storefront establishment. Bob Marley 
               Posters on the wall. A tall, thin Black woman, MARY NAWLS, 
               late thirties, wipes down a table. She looks up at the SOUND 
               of the door opening, sees JASON here. She spies PEMBLETON 
               and BAYLISS following on JASON's footsteps.

                                     JASON
                         Momma. These two guys are detectives.

                                     NAWLS
                              (to PEMBLETON)
                         Yes?

                                     PEMBLETON
                         You're Mrs. Nawls, Darryl's mother?

                                     NAWLS
                         I'm his mother.

               NAWLS looks to PEMBLETON and BAYLISS, reading their faces.

               BAYLISS glances away.

                                     NAWLS
                         Where's Darryl? Is he in trouble?
                              (beat, terrified)
                         Is he okay?

               JASON comes around to NAWLS' hip.

                                     NAWLS
                         Has he been in an accident or 
                         something?

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Mrs. Nawls, I'm a Homicide Detective.

                                     NAWLS
                         Homicide? What, homicide?

               NAWLS folds in at her waist as if her breath has been punched 
               out of her On NAWLS as WE HEAR Muddy Waters PLAYING "Who Do

               SONG CONTINUES. ATTENDANTS move about, preparing for the 
               autopsy on Darryl Nawls. His BODY lies on a steel table, 
               covered by a sheet. PEMBLETON raises the sheet to REVEAL 
               Darryl's FACE. NAWLS forces herself to look at Darryl's FACE. 
               NAWLS gently touches Darryl's eyes, turns and exits the room.

               PEMBLETON's POV: NAWLS walking out into the corridor, being 
               met by JASON. JASON looks into the Examining Room. NAWLS 
               shields his face from seeing Darryl's BODY.

               ON PEMBLETON, SADDENED,

               knocked backwards as PEMBLETON charges in, BAYLISS behind 
               him. she SCREAMS. A UNIFORM pulls her out of the way. BAYLISS 
               charges upstairs. UNIFORMS with shotguns burst into the 
               bathroom.


               SONG FADES. Harshly lit, full of shadows. BAYLISS comes up 
               the stairs. A SHADOW moves. BAYLISS instinctively jumps away, 
               raising his drawn gun to aim at the SHADOW. A seven year old 
               boy, DAVID SAYERS, appears.

                                     BAYLISS
                         What are you doing?

                         I have to get something.

               Unconcerned, DAVID walks past BAYLISS.

                         To get my spelling.

               DAVID walks into the back bedroom. BAYLISS glances in, sees 
               DAVID reach under a pile of papers on a nightstand and grab 
               a schoolbook.

                                     BAYLISS
                         You do good in spelling?

                         Yes.

                         I know that.

               DAVID comes out of the bedroom, pauses as he passes BAYLISS.

                                     DAVID
                         No, you didn't.

                              (to PEMBLETON)
                         Is he okay?

                                     PEMBLETON
                         We need to find him.

                         He's okay, though?

                                     BAYLISS
                         He may be involved in the shooting 
                         of a thirteen year old boy this 
                         morning.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         He was identified by several witnesses 
                         at the bowling alley where the murder 
                         took place. Where is he?

                         He said he was going over to his 
                         friend Henry's house after school 
                         and then they were going to play 
                         some basketball. How can my Ronny be 
                         involved in any of this? He's only 
                         fourteen years old.

                         He's how old?

                         When did you see him last?

                         This morning, here at the breakfast 
                         table. He had a bowl of cereal. Raisin 
                         Bran. He always has a bowl of Raisin 
                         Bran. Every morning.

                         How can you not-be sure?

                         What's Henry's last name?

               On PEMBLETON, frustrated, lighting a cigarette,

                                                                    CUT TO:


               PEMBLETON drives, intent. BAYLISS rides shotgun.

                                     BAYLISS
                         I had my gun pointed at that little 
                         boy back there. But for the grace of 
                         God...
                              (pause)
                         Could you slow down, Frank?

                                     PEMBLETON
                         You don't like my driving?

                                     BAYLISS
                         This isn't driving. This is hurtling. 
                         You're reckless. A threat to society.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Hey, you've got something against 
                         how I drive, you can take your turn 
                         at the wheel. And then I'll do the 
                         play-by-play critique and ride the 
                         rules of the road all over your ass.

               PEMBLETON slows down, exhales.

                                     BAYLISS
                         All we gotta do is find this Henry 
                         kid and then we find our shooter.

               PEMBLETON stares straight ahead as he drives.

                                     BAYLISS
                         Fourteen years old... When I was 
                         fourteen, jeez, I was in the ninth 
                         grade, and I don't remember much of 
                         what I was doing, but I know I was 
                         never thinking anything close to 
                         picking up a gun and shooting another 
                         kid.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         How old should our shooter be?

                                     BAYLISS
                         Not fourteen.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         So if he's what, fifteen, -sixteen 
                         years old, it makes any more sense?

                                     BAYLISS
                         No.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         How old should he be then? What's 
                         the cut off age? Seventeen? Eighteen?

                                     BAYLISS
                         I don't know.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         When you find out, clue me in, 
                         awright? I'd like to know when any 
                         of this killing, at any age, from 
                         six to sixty, makes any sense. I 
                         love that line the papers and TV 
                         news always run about "senseless" 
                         violence. one time I want to hear 
                         about a murder that makes sense. 
                         Just one time. For any reason.

                                     BAYLISS
                         I was so lucky tonight, Frank.

               On PEMBLETON, looking at BAYLISS, nodding,

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               LEWIS and MUNCH follow Interior Designer LARRY RUNYON, 
               thirties, who looks around bar, makes notes in notebook.

                                     MUNCH
                         We don't want to go crazy with the 
                         renovations.

                                     LEWIS
                         The place just needs some sprucing 
                         up... Right?

               RUNYON shakes his head, not impressed, as he walks around, 
               making notations in notebook.

                                     MUNCH
                         Talk to us, Larry.

                                     RUNYON
                         Well, I love the glazed headers.

                                     LEWIS
                         Excuse me?

                                     RUNYON
                              (indicates back wall)
                         The original brick work. They used 
                         glazed headers. It's fabulous.

                                     MUNCH
                         Okay. Sure. Fabulous. What else?

                                     LEWIS
                         You wanna know what I don't like?

                                     MUNCH
                         Not really.

                                     LEWIS
                         All this wood paneling. Makes the 
                         place so dark.

                                     MUNCH
                         It's a bar. It's supposed to be dark.

                                     LEWIS
                         It's a little depressing.

                                     MUNCH
                         Didn't you just say "a little sprucing 
                         up"?

                                     LEWIS
                              (re: RUNYON)
                         John, we have a professional present 
                         among us.

                                     RUNYON
                              (looks at walls)
                         We could always paint the paneling. 
                         A nice eggshell semi-gloss. Elegant, 
                         yet warm... I'm gonna check out the 
                         facilities.

               RUNYON exits into bathroom as MUNCH calls after him.

                                     MUNCH
                         If you start talking about brass 
                         fixtures and hanging ferns, you're 
                         fired.

                              (to MUNCH)
                         We class up the joint, we broaden 
                         our customer base.

                                     MUNCH
                         This is supposed to be a cop bar. 
                         Not some kind of cyber-singles 
                         hangout.

                                     LEWIS
                         What're you saying, cops wouldn't 
                         appreciate a little class?

               RUNYON emerges.

                                     RUNYON
                         We definitely gotta do something 
                         about the bathroom. It's like from 
                         the Civil War or something. I think 
                         we should rip everything out and 
                         start from scratch.

               The front door opens and PENELOPE SMITH-HADDON, genteel 
               Baltimore County woman, fifties, enters.

                                     SMITH-HADDON
                         Excuse me? I'm looking for the new 
                         owners.

                                     MUNCH
                         You found two of them.

                                     SMITH-HADDON
                         I'm from the Baltimore Landmark 
                         Preservation Society... This building 
                         is a historical landmark. I'm here 
                         to protect the integrity of the site.

                                     LEWIS
                         What does that mean? The integrity 
                         of the site?

                                     SMITH-HADDON
                         That means if you were planning on 
                         making any renovations, you should 
                         stop. Immediately.

               ON MUNCH AND LEWIS, CONFUSED,

                                                                    CUT TO:


               CU on "The Board". "N-A-W-L-S" in RED under Pembleton's name. 
               PAN to PEMBLETON and BAYLISS leading RONNY into the Squad 
               Room. RONNY is wide-eyed with anxiety. BAYLISS intercepts 
               GIARDELLO as PEMBLETON continues into "The Box" with RONNY.

                                     BAYLISS
                         We've got the shooter, Gee.

               GIARDELLO looks into "The Box", studying RONNY.

                                     GIARDELLO
                         My God, how old is he?

                                     BAYLISS
                         He's supposed to be fourteen, but 
                         jeez, he looks so small.

                                     GIARDELLO
                         Notify Juvenile. If this kid is the 
                         shooter, we have to step carefully.

                                     BAYLISS
                         Right.

               BAYLISS grabs phone. GIARDELLO steps closer to "The Box".


               GIARDELLO leans in.

                                     GIARDELLO
                         Frank.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         This is Ronny Sayers.

                                     GIARDELLO
                         Hey, Ronny.

                                     RONNY
                         This room smells funny.

               GIARDELLO turns to PEMBLETON.

                                     GIARDELLO
                         I told Tim. By the numbers on this 
                         one.

               GIARDELLO exits.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         You want anything, Ronny?

               RONNY glares at PEMBLETON.


               BAYLISS hangs up phone. GIARDELLO comes up to him.

                                     BAYLISS
                         The State's Attorney office is sending 
                         over Maggie Carter. He said held 
                         call Juvenile for us.

               SAYERS enters.

                                     SAYERS
                         Someone called and said you have my 
                         son? Where is he?

                                     BAYLISS
                         Ma'am, we've placed him in custody.

                                     SAYERS
                              (to GIARDELLO)
                         I want my son.

               GIARDELLO looks over at "The Box", SAYERS heads for it.


               SAYERS rushes in, BAYLISS and GIARDELLO behind her. RONNY 
               and PEMBLETON look to door.

                                     SAYERS
                         Ronny?

               BAYLISS reaches to restrain SAYERS from entering any further. 
               SAYERS pushes his hand away.

                                     SAYERS
                         Ronny.

                                     RONNY
                         Mom?

               RONNY catches himself, resumes tough-guy attitude.

                                     RONNY
                         You don't have to be here.

                                     SAYERS
                         Where have you been?

               RONNY looks away.

                                     SAYERS
                         Where have you been, dammit?

                                     RONNY
                         Nowhere.

                                     SAYERS
                         I've been worried sick.

                                     RONNY
                         You can stop worrying, awright?

                                     SAYERS
                         Your little brother's home with a 
                         fever. He didn't sleep all night.

                                     RONNY
                         You should be at home with David 
                         then. I'm okay.

                                     SAYERS
                         Come here, baby.

               SAYERS puts her arms around RONNY, who squirms to get out of 
               her grasp. He motions to PEMBLETON.

                                     RONNY
                         Does she have to be here?

                                     SAYERS
                         I'm your mother, Ronny.

               RONNY bolts out of the chair, away from SAYERS.

                                     RONNY
                         You can't help me. I don't want you 
                         in here, awright? I shot that kid.

                                     SAYERS
                         You didn't do any such thing.

                                     RONNY
                              (to PEMBLETON)
                         I shot the wrong kid too, didn't I?

                                     SAYERS
                         He couldn't have shot anyone. This 
                         is my son here.
                              (to RONNY)
                         You didn't do anything. Tell them.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Ronny, you've made an admission and 
                         I have to read you your rights.

                                     SAYERS
                         What's wrong with you? Tell them you 
                         didn't shoot anyone.

                                     RONNY
                              (to BAYLISS)
                         Do I have the right not to have her 
                         in here?

                                     SAYERS
                         He doesn't mean it. He doesn't know 
                         what he's saying.

                                     RONNY
                              (to GIARDELLO)
                         Do I?

                                     GIARDELLO
                         You have that right.

                                     RONNY
                         Then I want her outta here.

               SAYERS, crushed, lets herself be lead away by BAYLISS and 
               GIARDELLO. PEMBLETON turns to RONNY.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Good move.

                                     RONNY
                         Hey, it's my right, okay?

                                     PEMBLETON
                         I'd've done the same thing.

               RONNY swings his feet up onto the table.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Comfy?

                                     RONNY
                         I'm tired.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         God knows.

               RONNY shrugs, smiles.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         You must be some kind of ballbuster 
                         to sneak up behind someone and shoot 
                         him.

                                     RONNY
                         When do I get to go home?

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Two shots right in the back of his 
                         left ear.

                                     RONNY
                         I didn't sneak up on him. I walked 
                         right up to him.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         You shot him in the back of the head.

                                     RONNY
                         If I had gotten who I meant to, I 
                         can see you coming down on me, but I 
                         shot the wrong kid.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         You just made a mistake, huh?

                                     RONNY
                         Hey, if you're driving a car and you 
                         hit someone you don't mean to, it's 
                         an accident.

                                     PEMBLETON
                              (pausing)
                         Ronny, you shot an innocent kid.

                                     RONNY
                         Car accidents kill innocent people 
                         all the time, don't they? How's this 
                         any different then?

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Get your damn feet off my table.

               As RONNY swings his feet from the table and lays his head 
               down on it,

                                                                    CUT TO:


               NAWLS is led into "The Aquarium" by BOLANDER. She has JASON 
               in tow. JASON is carrying a comic book.

                                     BOLANDER
                         I'll find Detective Pembleton for 
                         you.

                                     JASON
                         I'm thirsty, Momma.

                                     NAWLS
                         Wait until I talk to the detective, 
                         Jason.

                                     BOLANDER
                         I can get him something. What do you 
                         want, Jason?

               JASON turns away, shy.

                                     BOLANDER
                         C'mon, I'll show you where the soda 
                         machine is and you can help me find 
                         the detective for your mom. You can 
                         pick whatever soda you want. How 
                         about a Coke?

                                     JASON
                         Yeah.

                                     NAWLS
                         I don't like the caffeine in it for 
                         him.

                                     BOLANDER
                         We have root beer and, I think, 
                         strawberry soda.
                              (points toward Coffee 
                              Room)
                         The soda machine is right over there. 
                         Your mom will watch you the whole 
                         way over. I like root beer. It's 
                         been my favorite since I was your 
                         age...

               JASON looks up into his MOTHER's face. NAWLS reaches into 
               her purse.

                                     BOLANDER
                         No, no. It's on the house.
                              (to JASON)
                         I know how to get all my sodas for 
                         free. I got a secret way.

               BOLANDER waves his hands "Houdini" style. JASON smiles, hands 
               his comic book to his MOTHER, heads out of "The Aquarium" 
               with BOLANDER.


               BAYLISS and SAYERS pass by BOLANDER and JASON.

                                     SAYERS
                         Don't let my son say he did anything.

                                     BAYLISS
                         Mrs. Sayers, that's up to him, not 
                         me.

                                     SAYERS
                         He's only a child.

                                     BAYLISS
                         So was the other kid.

                                     SAYERS
                         I have to be in there with my Ronny.

                                     BAYLISS
                         I'm sorry.

                                     SAYERS
                         You know he doesn't know what he's 
                         saying.

               BAYLISS sees Assistant State's Attorney MAGGIE CARTER entering 
               from the Elevator Area.

                                     BAYLISS
                         You'll have to excuse me, Ma'am.

               SAYERS watches BAYLISS go over and confer with CARTER. She 
               stands, framed by "The Board", adrift. PICK UP BAYLISS and 
               CARTER crossing the Squad Room, headed toward "The Box".

                                     BAYLISS
                         The kid admits to the shooting.

                                     CARTER
                         How'd you get this from him?

                                     BAYLISS
                         He volunteered the information.

                                     CARTER
                         You advised him of his rights before 
                         he confessed?

                                     BAYLISS
                         We never got the chance. He beat us 
                         to the punch. His mother comes in 
                         there with him, he doesn't want her 
                         there, he cops to the shooting so 
                         she'll leave him alone.

                                     CARTER
                         The mother's here?

               BAYLISS gestures to SAYERS as they cross the Squad Room.

                                     BAYLISS
                         Right there.

               CARTER pauses, looks at SAYERS, continues into "The Box", 
               BAYLISS on his heels.


               PEMBLETON sits across from RONNY as CARTER and BAYLISS enter.

                                     CARTER
                         Frank.

               PEMBLETON nods a silent greeting to CARTER, who approaches 
               RONNY.

                                     CARTER
                         I'm Maggie Carter, an Assistant 
                         State's Attorney.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         This here is Mister Bad Boy and all 
                         of fourteen years old.

                                     RONNY
                         I did the shooting, didn't I?

                                     CARTER
                         Ronny, I'm going to advise you not 
                         to say another word until we have 
                         someone here to represent you.

                                     RONNY
                         Whatever.

               AS CARTER LOOKS AT PEMBLETON,

                                                                    CUT TO:


               SAYERS pushes through the swinging doors. NAWLS sits, 
               clutching Jason's comic book tightly in her fist. SAYERS 
               sits down, a few seats from NAWLS. SAYERS looks at NAWLS. 
               They exchange a polite nod of the head.

               SAYERS'-POV: BAYLISS comes out of "The Box", exchanges a 
               look with SAYERS as he passes by.

                                     NAWLS
                         You okay?

                                     SAYERS
                         My boy.

                                     NAWLS
                         He's in trouble?

                                     SAYERS
                         He was missing for a day and now...

                                     NAWLS
                         But they found him alright?

               SAYERS turns to NAWLS, then sees the comic book.

                                     SAYERS
                         What're'ya reading?

                                     NAWLS
                         This is my little boy's comic. He's 
                         with one of the detectives.

                                     SAYERS
                         He's in trouble, too?

                                     NAWLS
                         Oh, no. He went to get a soda.
                              (opens the comic book)
                         I don't know what he reads these 
                         days.
                              (reading the cover)
                         What's this X-Men?

                                     SAYERS
                         My littlest one reads that. He's 
                         home probably going through one of 
                         those right as we speak.

                                     NAWLS
                              (glancing through the 
                              pages)
                         Super heroes who fight Evil in the 
                         world. We could use some real X-Men 
                         in this town.

                                     SAYERS
                         Don't I know it.

               SAYERS scoots over next to NAWLS, offers handshake.

                                     SAYERS
                         I'm Patrice.

                                     NAWLS
                         Mary.

               They shake hands. SAYERS motions to Squad Room.

                                     SAYERS
                         This is the first time I've ever 
                         been in this place. I imagined it to 
                         be a lot noisier.

                                     NAWLS
                         I thought it'd be bigger somehow.

               On SAYERS and NAWLS, shy smiles,

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                      END OF ACT TWO

                                        ACT THREE

               FADE IN:


               CARTER, GIARDELLO and BAYLISS huddle outside the open door 
               of "The Box". THERESA COUSART, mid-thirties, Public Defender, 
               comes up to them.

                                     CARTER
                         Theresa.

                                     COUSART
                         Ed.

                                     CARTER
                         Al. Tim. This is Theresa Cousart, 
                         out of the Public Defender's office.

                                     GIARDELLO
                         We've met.

                                     COUSART
                         Is Juvenile here?

                                     CARTER
                         Waiting on 'em. I put the call in.

                                     COUSART
                         I'm on City pension before they get 
                         here.

               COUSART leans around them, peeks into "The Box".

               HER POV: RONNY, asleep, his head leaned back against the 
               back of his chair.


               COUSART enters. GIARDELLO, CARTER and BAYLISS follow.

               PEMBLETON is leaning up against the mirror. RONNY slowly 
               wakens, irritated.

                                     RONNY
                         What?

                                     COUSART
                         Ronny? Theresa Cousart. I'm a Public 
                         Defender here to provide you with 
                         legal representation.

                                     RONNY
                         I was sleeping, y'know.

                                     COUSART
                              (to GIARDELLO)
                         I'd like some privacy to consult 
                         with my client.

                                     RONNY
                         What for? I've already told 'em what 
                         they want to know.
                              (to PEMBLETON)
                         Clue the lady in, will ya?

                                     PEMBLETON
                              (to COUSART)
                         Ronny here has made a statement.

                                     COUSART
                         Ronny, it'd be in your best interests 
                         not to say anything in front of these 
                         officers.

                                     RONNY
                         My "best interests"? Ain't you too 
                         cool, lady.
                              (to PEMBLETON)
                         You tell her.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         It's not for me to say, Ronny.

                                     RONNY
                         Do I have to have her in here, too?

                                     CARTER
                         Hey, kid, you've got a serious charge 
                         facing you.

                                     RONNY
                         What, that I shot that kid?

                                     COUSART
                         Ronny.

                                     RONNY
                         Hey, what's the deal? I meant to 
                         shoot this other kid. I made an honest 
                         mistake. You can't blame me for that.

               As COUSART leans back, her work cut out for her,

                                                                    CUT TO:


               NAWLS and SAYERS sit side-by-side.

                                     SAYERS
                         Where are all the men these days, 
                         that's what I'd like to know.

                                     NAWLS
                         Well, there's Gerald, he lives two 
                         houses down from me. He's twenty-
                         six. And then there's Marcus. He's 
                         gotta be eighty years old. That's it 
                         in my neighborhood.

                                     SAYERS
                         I think there's one guy, maybe he's 
                         in his thirties, just around the 
                         corner, but I haven't seen him in 
                         awhile so I don't know, maybe 
                         something happened to him... How 
                         many kids you got?

                                     NAWLS
                              (hesitates)
                         Two. I had two. Darryl and Jason.

               SAYERS waits.

                                     NAWLS
                         Darryl was shot. He was killed.

               Sympathy floods SAYERS' face.

                                     SAYERS
                         I'm sorry... Was Darryl the oldest?

                                     NAWLS
                              (nods)
                         Jason's a quiet fella, but Darryl 
                         was the one for adventures. He says 
                         to me just the other day, "Momma, 
                         I'm gonna join up with something, 
                         the Army, the Navy, and I'm gonna 
                         see the World." He tells me he's 
                         gonna go see people in Japan and 
                         Ireland and Italy, see how they all 
                         live...

                                     SAYERS
                         I'm trying to get my two boys out 
                         the city, but every place I can think 
                         of takes money. Ronny and David.

                                     NAWLS
                         Excuse me?

                                     SAYERS
                         That's their names. My sons.

                                     NAWLS
                         Those are nice names.

                                     SAYERS
                         Thank you.
                              (beat, sighs)
                         Maybe I could get Ronny and David to 
                         Canada. Get away from all this 
                         killing.

                                     NAWLS
                         I've been to three funerals this 
                         year for Darryl's friends. It's almost 
                         like this is how we have our socials 
                         now.

               SAYERS nods, lost in thought.

                                     SAYERS
                         My Ronny... He's a country boy living 
                         in the city. He teaches me how to 
                         tell if rain is coming. The leaves 
                         on the trees, especially the sugar 
                         maples, these leaves would turn over 
                         so's to take up all the rain so that 
                         the rain wouldn't fall onto the ground 
                         and wash away the topsoil.

               Pause.

                                     NAWLS
                         Canada, huh?

                                     SAYERS
                         I don't know a thing about it except 
                         it's supposed to have a lot of snow 
                         and cold. Maybe they don't kill each 
                         other so much up there. Maybe the 
                         cold keeps a lid on things. Do you 
                         think?

                                     NAWLS
                         Could be.

               As SAYERS and NAWLS share a small smile,

                                                                    CUT TO:


               PEMBLETON and BAYLISS lead RONNY out of "The Box". RONNY is 
               now handcuffed. CARTER and COUSART huddle with GIARDELLO.

                                     CARTER
                         He's fourteen, so he's at the magic 
                         cutoff point. He could go juvenile, 
                         but with this kid's attitude I'm 
                         strongly inclined to get him charged 
                         as an adult.

                                     COUSART
                         Ed, he doesn't realize the severity 
                         of what he's done. He thinks he's 
                         innocent because he shot the wrong 
                         guy.

                                     CARTER
                         He's given a "resgesti" statement. 
                         He's waived his rights.

                                     COUSART
                         He doesn't know what he's saying.

                                     GIARDELLO
                         So what are we supposed to do? Let 
                         him go? Then next week, next month, 
                         next year, we haul his ass back in 
                         here for another murder?

               PICK UP PEMBLETON and BAYLISS as they lead RONNY across the 
               Squad Room. JASON passes them with BOLANDER, holding a bag 
               of potato chips and a can of root beer.


               SAYERS gets up with a startled expression as she spies RONNY 
               being escorted by PEMBLETON and BAYLISS.

                                     NAWLS
                         What's the matter, Patrice?

               SAYERS hurries out.


               SAYERS hurries toward PEMBLETON, BAYLISS and RONNY, panicked.

                                     SAYERS
                         Ronny. What's going on?
                              (to PEMBLETON)
                         Where are you taking my boy?

               NAWLS comes out of "The Aquarium".

                                     PEMBLETON
                              (to SAYERS; without 
                              slowing his steps)
                         Ronny is going to Processing. He's a 
                         big boy now. He's confessed to murder.

                                     NAWLS
                         Detective Pembleton? I came to see 
                         you.

               JASON comes up to NAWLS, holding up potato chips and the 
               root beer.

                                     JASON
                         Momma, see what the detective got 
                         me?

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Mrs. Nawls, it'll be awhile.

                                     BAYLISS
                         We have to take him down for 
                         processing.

                                     SAYERS
                         Ronny didn't shoot that boy.

                                     NAWLS
                         What boy?

               THEY all pass through the swinging door.


               PEMBLETON and BAYLISS lead RONNY through the swinging door 
               out of the Squad Room, NAWLS and SAYERS right behind them.

                                     NAWLS
                         This is the bastard who killed my 
                         Darryl?
                              (turn on SAYERS)
                         He's your boy?

               Elevator doors open. BAYLISS and PEMBLETON lead RONNY into 
               elevator. SAYERS gets on elevator, starts to face NAWLS again, 
               quickly turns away. Elevator doors close.

                                     JASON
                         Momma, momma, look what I got...

               JASON tugs at NAWLS' blouse, trying to get her to see his 
               soda pop and potato chips. As NAWLS stares at the elevator 
               doors,

                                                                    CUT TO:


               NAWLS charges in, dragging JASON behind her, confronts 
               GIARDELLO behind his desk. Her face is a mask of pure rage.

                                     NAWLS
                         You the boss?

                                     GIARDELLO
                         On a good day, yes.

                                     NAWLS
                         I want him dead. Now.

                                     GIARDELLO
                         Who?

                                     NAWLS
                         That bastard that shot my son.

                                     GIARDELLO
                         You're the mother of the boy Ronny 
                         Sayers shot?

                                     NAWLS
                         I want him dead. Cold as my boy. 
                         Cold in the ground.

                                     GIARDELLO
                         Ronny will have to stand trial.

                                     NAWLS
                         What good are you people? You can't 
                         protect us, least you can do is make 
                         things right. I want justice. Kill 
                         him, do you hear me?

               JASON gapes at NAWLS, as she takes a swing at GIARDELLO.

                                     JASON
                         Momma?

                                     NAWLS
                              (in a rage)
                         Kill him, kill him. Kill the 
                         sonofabitch--

               BOLANDER, concerned, leans into the office.

                                     BOLANDER
                         You alright, Gee?

               GIARDELLO waves BOLANDER away.

                                     NAWLS
                         My son is dead.

               As JASON stares at NAWLS, clutching his soda and potato chips, 
               tears in his eyes,

                                                                    CUT TO:


               PEMBLETON leads RONNY toward the Processing Room as BAYLISS 
               holds off a distraught SAYERS.

                                     SAYERS
                         He didn't kill anyone. Tell 'em, 
                         Ronny. Explain things. Ronny, tell 
                         'em. Tell 'em.

               RONNY remains stone-faced. They reach the Processing Room.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Mrs. Sayers, you're gonna have to 
                         wait here.

               SAYERS starts ripping at PEMBLETON and BAYLISS, claws at 
               them to reach RONNY.

                                     SAYERS
                         Give me back my boy. Give me back my 
                         boy.

               BAYLISS restrains her. On PEMBLETON, leading RONNY off,

                                                                    CUT TO:


               LEWIS and MUNCH sit around table, drinking beers.

                                     LEWIS
                         George Washington. Huh.

                                     MUNCH
                         So the guy who owns what used to be 
                         this house, Cumberland Dugan--

                                     LEWIS
                         Cumberland Dugan? That's his name?

                                     MUNCH
                         Cumberland's sitting having dinner 
                         with his wife and kids and he gets a 
                         knock on the door. Who is it? It's 
                         George Washington. It's the President 
                         of the United States. And he wants 
                         to tap a kidney in his bathroom. 
                         That'd be kind of an honor, I guess. 
                         To have your porcelain christened by 
                         the pee of a prez.

                                     LEWIS
                         Maybe we should have that printed on 
                         our napkins. "Come drink where George 
                         Washington drained."

                                     MUNCH
                              (raises glass)
                         Here's to George.

                                     LEWIS
                         To George. And his lovely wife, Dinah.

               AS THEY CLINK GLASSES, DRINK,

                                                                    CUT TO:


               A PROCESSING OFFICER wipes RONNY's fingers free of fingerprint 
               ink. RONNY is then walked over to two Holding Cells. one is 
               filled with three ADULT ARRESTEES. The PROCESSING OFFICER 
               opens the empty cell. RONNY takes a step in. The PROCESSING 
               OFFICER stops him, unbuckles RONNY's belt, takes it from 
               him. PEMBLETON stands at RONNY's side.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         We're gonna put you here in isolation, 
                         Ronny. Away from the adults.

               The ADULT ARRESTEES stir in the next cell.

                                     RONNY
                         I ain't scared of them.

               O.C., the ADULT ARRESTEES laugh, send up CATCALLS and 
               THREATENING GESTURES to RONNY and PEMBLETON. RONNY poses 
               defiant to the ADULTS. PROCESSING OFFICER kneels next to him 
               and removes RONNY's shoelaces.

                                     RONNY
                         What'd'ya doing? Leave me my laces, 
                         man.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         We don't want you trying to hurt 
                         yourself again.

                                     RONNY
                         I should've done it when I had the 
                         chance.

               The PROCESSING OFFICER finishes removing RONNY's shoelaces, 
               takes RONNY by the arm and sets him inside the cell, then 
               closes the cell door.

                                     RONNY
                         This is the "big time," huh?

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Your life is over, Ronny.

                                     RONNY
                         Naw.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Get clear, kid. This is no joke 
                         anymore. If it comes down that you're 
                         charged as an adult, you're gonna 
                         have to realize that you'll probably 
                         die in a cell just like this one.

                                     RONNY
                         Better than on the street.

                                     PEMBLETON
                              (pausing)
                         You figure you're safer in jail?

                                                                    CUT TO:

                                     END OF ACT THREE

                                         ACT FOUR

               FADE IN:


               PEMBLETON and BAYLISS watch from back of courtroom. RONNY 
               stands facing JUDGE with COUSART. CARTER also stands. SAYERS 
               sits nearby, listening attentively.

                                     CARTER
                         Your Honor, given the severity of 
                         the crime, and the fact that the 
                         defendant made a confession and shows 
                         no signs of remorse, State asks that 
                         he be denied bail.

                                     COUSART
                         Your Honor, my client is only fourteen 
                         years old. We move that he be remanded 
                         to the custody of his mother. Given 
                         his age and his lack of financial 
                         resources, we do not consider him a 
                         flight risk.

               JUDGE studies papers, considers.

                                     JUDGE
                         Despite the defendant's youth, the 
                         crime he's accused of committing is 
                         a capital offense. Defendant is hereby 
                         denied bail and will remain 
                         incarcerated until trial.

               SAYERS bows her head, defeated. PEMBLETON turns to BAYLISS.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         I'll be right back.

               PEMBLETON walks over to RONNY, who's being escorted away by 
               UNIFORMS. SAYERS also approaches.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Ronny.

               RONNY glances up. PEMBLETON looks at UNIFORMS, signals them 
               to back away.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Mrs. Sayers, I'd like a moment alone 
                         with your son.

               SAYERS hesitates, backs off.

                                     RONNY
                         What'd'ya want?

                                     PEMBLETON
                         You kept me awake last night. I resent 
                         that. I need my sleep.

                                     RONNY
                         Sorry for nothing.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         I didn't sleep, but I had nightmares. 
                         Kids your brother's age singing "Ring 
                         Around the Rosey." Only they didn't 
                         have any faces.

               RONNY stares at his feet.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         You know now, don't you?

               No response.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         You got the fear, don't you?

               RONNY nods.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Keep to yourself. Don't be a 
                         politician. Don't be a warrior. You 
                         understand?

               RONNY nods.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         You like to read?

               RONNY shrugs.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Then read. Go out with your mind.

               RONNY gives PEMBLETON a long look, then turns and walks to 
               waiting UNIFORMS. SAYERS approaches.

                                     SAYERS
                         Ronny?

               RONNY glances at her, all boldness gone, for once a fourteen 
               year old boy.

                                     RONNY
                         Goodbye, Momma.

               UNIFORMS lead him off. SAYERS gazes after him. On PEMBLETON, 
               not sure where to put his feelings,

                                                                    CUT TO:


               Stacks of cocktail napkins, beer coasters, jars of maraschino 
               cherries and green olives line the bar. The bar has been 
               polished. The floors have been washed down. A liquor DELIVERY 
               MAN trucks in cases of beer and bourbon. MUNCH and LEWIS are 
               in casual day-off clothes. They push selection buttons on 
               the jukebox.

                                     MUNCH
                         This place doesn't need renovation. 
                         It needs a theme.

                                     LEWIS
                         A "theme"? This is a bar, not a prom 
                         night.

                                     MUNCH
                         I've asked the fellas on the Unit 
                         and they voted for Country 'n Western 
                         on the jukebox. That could very well 
                         be the determining factor on what 
                         the theme of this bar is.

                                     LEWIS
                         I ain't having my jukebox in my bar 
                         play any cracker-assed music.

                                     MUNCH
                         Hey, my sentiments exactly, but 
                         business is business and Country 'n 
                         Western, that's what punches up the 
                         old cash machine in this town.

               BAYLISS enters, stops, smiles, stunned by the progress of 
               the bar.

                                     BAYLISS
                         Hey, we're almost ready for the grand 
                         opening. Everyone wants to come. I 
                         heard even the brass. Gee says to 
                         save him a seat at the bar.

                                     MUNCH
                         Glad you could join us, Tim.

                                     LEWIS
                         We're discussing musical selections 
                         for the jukebox.

                                     BAYLISS
                         How 'bout maybe a little blues, a 
                         little Koko Taylor, maybe some Billie 
                         Holiday, Etta James or Buddy Guy?

                                     MUNCH
                         We need songs which remind our 
                         customers that it's better to be in 
                         here than out there. We need someone 
                         singing ditties about a cheatin, 
                         wife. We want our customers crying 
                         into their beers.
                              (beat, brightens)
                         Whatever the music, we play it loud.

                                     BAYLISS
                         I don't want our place to turn into 
                         a headknocker's bar.

                                     MUNCH
                         The louder the music, the more people 
                         drink. I've done my research.

                                     LEWIS
                              (beat, smiles)
                         Well, then we'll crank up the speakers 
                         until their ears bleed.

               A Deputy City SHERIFF enters, mid-thirties, the workout king 
               of Baltimore, fit and tanned.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Evening. May I speak to the owners, 
                         please?

                                     LEWIS
                         You're looking at all three of 'em.

               SHERIFF walks over to the bar.

                                     SHERIFF
                         You're the owners?

                                     MUNCH
                         We're the new owners. Bright-eyed-
                         and bushy-tailed.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Well, I got old news for you new 
                         owners. I'm gonna have to shut you 
                         down.

               SHERIFF extracts an inch-thick envelop of documents.

                                     SHERIFF
                         I'm the Deputy City Sheriff and I'm 
                         here to serve papers of delinquency 
                         on back taxes on the building.

                                     MUNCH
                         Back taxes? But we complied with 
                         every rule and regulation in the 
                         contract.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Well, I don't know what to say to 
                         you boys, but obviously someone didn't 
                         do a thorough enough search on the 
                         property for you.

                                     LEWIS
                         Look, we're Police officers, just 
                         like you. Maybe there's some way you 
                         could help us out on this...

                                     SHERIFF
                         You're cops? The three of you?

                                     MUNCH
                         We work Homicide.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Well, then you have no excuse. You're 
                         detectives and you should have 
                         investigated the building more 
                         aggressively.

                                     BAYLISS
                         We have our life savings invested in 
                         this bar.

               SHERIFF gestures to framed liquor license.

                                     SHERIFF
                         That'll have to come down. You'll 
                         have to hand it over to me.

                                     MUNCH
                         Have a heart.

                                     SHERIFF
                         I do. This pains me to no end, 
                         'specially knowing you guys are fellow 
                         officers, but I got my job. You go 
                         down, settle with the City Property 
                         Tax Division, and you're back in 
                         business in a month, six weeks.

                                     MUNCH
                         By that time, the tourist season is 
                         over.

                                     SHERIFF
                         You have a point. You really do.
                              (beat, smiles)
                         But it's so much nicer when them 
                         tourists ain't around. Tell me that's 
                         not the truth.

               On MUNCH, BAYLISS and LEWIS, blood pressure rising,

                                                                    CUT TO:


               Filled with DINERS. A fresh fruit display of mangoes and 
               melons graces the counter. NAWLS clears a table of dirty 
               dishes. JASON wipes the table down, setting silverware and 
               paper placemats. REVEAL SAYERS walking in, her son DAVID at 
               her side. NAWLS looks up, sees SAYERS. NAWLS picks up dirty 
               dishes, busing them to the counter. Pause.

                                     SAYERS
                         I asked the detectives how I could 
                         find you.

               NAWLS says nothing, keeps working. JASON and DAVID eye each 
               other.

                                     SAYERS
                         I wanted to tell you how... "Sorry" 
                         isn't enough of what I need to say 
                         to you...

                                     NAWLS
                              (beat)
                         I thought you'd be in Canada by now.

                                     SAYERS
                         Oh no. I'm stuck here in Baltimore...

               The moment is broken by laughter. SAYERS and NAWLS look up 
               to see JASON and DAVID goofing around with the fresh fruit 
               display. JASON holds up a mango, places it on his head, trying 
               to balance it. DAVID laughs, imitates JASON, picking up 
               another mango and holding it on his head.

                                     NAWLS
                         He's a fine-looking boy.

                                     SAYERS
                         Thank you.

               JASON and DAVID begin to wrestle playfully. SAYERS looks at 
               them, alarmed.

                                     SAYERS
                         David what are you doing?

               DAVID pauses.

                                     SAYERS
                         Stop it. You tell that little boy 
                         you're sorry.

                                     DAVID
                         We're only playing, Momma.

                                     JASON
                         We're not fighting, Momma.

               SAYERS grabs DAVID by his collar, hauls him away from JASON.

                                     SAYERS
                         You don't play rough.
                              (to NAWLS)
                         He didn't mean it.

                                     NAWLS
                         No, it's okay. Kids are kids and 
                         kids hafta play...

               SAYERS lets go of DAVID. He drifts back toward JASON.

                                     NAWLS
                         How's your son Ronny?

                                     SAYERS
                         I don't know. They won't let me see 
                         him 'til Sunday. I'll take him some 
                         food.

               SAYERS reaches into her jacket pocket, pulls out a wide 
               envelope, holds it out to NAWLS.

                                     SAYERS
                         I bought this Mass card for your 
                         Darryl. NAWLS doesn't know what to 
                         say.

                                     SAYERS
                         Take it. Please.

               NAWLS takes the card, gazes at it.

                                     NAWLS
                         I know my son is in a good place. 
                         It's not Canada, but still... I don't 
                         think they shoot each other in Heaven.

               The TWO WOMEN look deep into each other's eyes.

                                     NAWLS
                         Thank you for the mass card.

               Again, the sound of laughter. JASON and DAVID toss a melon 
               back and forth, pretending to shoot three-pointers with it.

                                     NAWLS
                         They like-to play with each other, 
                         don't they?

                                     SAYERS
                              (pausing)
                         They do.

                                     NAWLS
                              (calling to JASON)
                         Jason, we've got tables to clean.

               NAWLS turns to clear another table of dirty dishes.

                                     SAYERS
                         Maybe they could get to know each 
                         other.

                                     NAWLS
                         And what would they do if they did 
                         that? What would happen if they got 
                         to know about each other's older 
                         brother?

               NAWLS turns and walks off.

                                     SAYERS
                         David, let's go. I mean it.

               SAYERS walks to the door. DAVID trots after her. On JASON 
               and DAVID, exchanging smiles and laughs, making goofy faces 
               at each other as the distance grows greater between them,

                                                             FADE TO BLACK:

                                         THE END
