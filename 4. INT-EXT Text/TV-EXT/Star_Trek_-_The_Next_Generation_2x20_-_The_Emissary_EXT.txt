     Still at warp nine. In the distance behind the 
     Enterprise, a point of light -- the probe -- appears 
     and gains on the Enterprise. 
 
 
     as the probe "pulls up alongside" to starboard as the 
     stars streak past at warp nine.

     as the probe draws closer, slowing up relative to the 
     Enterprise -- until they are both moving at warp nine 
     in perfect tandem, as if joined by an invisible rod. 
 
 
     as a TRACTOR BEAM reaches out and grabs the probe.
