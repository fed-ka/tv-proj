Dark in here, except where the sunlight penetrates the
thick, glassy ice walls. The silhouettes of the
Primitives stark against the glistening cavern. The
sound of flint being struck, then A TORCH CATCHES FIRE,
illuminating their faces. And:
A CREATURE
Deeper in the cave. Fleeing the light and the men. We
get only a brief glimpse of it in the torch light,
seeing that it moves upright on two legs and has gray,
dinosaur-like skin. And large black eyes. But it moves
quickly enough away that any other identifying feature
is lost in the deeper shadows.
THE PRIMITIVES
Removing crude weapons made of sharpened bone from under
their thick fur garments, and scrabbling into the
constricting cavern, giving chase.
Following them as they moves with animal-like agility
through the tightening space. Predatory hunters. Their
torchlight catching:
THE CREATURE
As it disappears into a tight opening in a smaller
crevice leading off the main one. The Primitives
entering frame after a moment, only a few steps behind.
The LEAD PRIMITIVE dropping to the cave floor,
pulling himself into this same tight fissure in pursuit.
Splitting off from his partner who exits frame still on
the run.
The fiery torch comes through first, held by the lead
man. Throwing dancing shadows on the walls of what
appears to be a box cavern.
CLOSE ON LEAD PRIMITIVE
Rising quickly to his feet. Not seeing what the torch
illuminates just behind him: The face of a dead
Primitive Man, his body frozen into the ice. He does
finally notice this, turning to see it, when he's
ATTACKED VICIOUSLY FROM BEHIND.
The torch falls to the floor so that the fight is
difficult to see, but it is loud and cruel. The creature
squealing wildly as the grunts of the Primitive now turn
to the sounds of painful struggle. Until:
THE SECOND PRIMITIVE MAN
Suddenly appears, driving his bone weapon into the body
of the Creature. Again and again, until the Creature is
driven away into the shadows.
The Second Man grabs the torch now, not to see if his
hunting mate has survived, but in pursuit of the
Creature. In the light we see that he and his weapon are
covered with spatters of OILY BLACK BLOOD. As is the
First Primitive whose body lies heaving on the floor.
The Second Primitive stepping over his hunting mate,
stalking the Creature into the shadows, where it has
collapsed. The torch finally landing, for the first
time, on its face.
When the torchlight hits its face, the Creature attacks.
But the Primitive prevails. He drops his torch and
dispatches the already wounded Creature with strong
hard stabs of his weapon, one of which penetrates the
Creature's eye.
LOW ANGLE ON THE DEAD CREATURE
The torch, which lies on the ground, illuminates the
dead creature's face. Its wounds are flowing with the
oily black blood, which, oddly now, BEGINS TO POOL. As
if it has intelligence, sentience. Pooling and traveling
into a fissure in the cave floor. And disappearing.
ANGLE ON THE SECOND PRIMITIVE
Watching this, unknowing. His chest heaving from the
fight, as the spots of Oily Black Blood which have
spattered onto him begin to crawl. Crawling toward his
eyes and mouth. Causing him to let out grunts of fear.
Which are the sounds we hear as the CAMERA SLOWLY CRANES
UP past the struggling Primitive to the roof of the
cave, where the dancing shadows of the torch FADE AWAY
with the sounds of struggle. Moving into darkness and
silence. But only for a moment. Until:
SUNSHINE BREAKS THROUGH THE ROOF OF THE CAVE - PRESENT
DAY
Along with the spade of a shovel. And then -- the
earthen cave ceiling gives way and A BOY wearing Nikes
and an old t-shirt falls through it. Falling PAST
CAMERA. We hear a YELL, then a THUD, and a CLATTERING of
the shovel that's fallen in with him. Then a pained
GASPING.
Then SEVERAL HEADS appear in the opening. These are BOYS
of ten to eleven, staring down into the cave. Hot
sunlight blazing in. We have traveled far, far forward
in time.
2ND BOY
Hey, Stevie. You okay?
THEIR POV OF STEVIE
On the floor below covered with dirt, in his nose and
mouth. Spitting out. (All these boys have Texas in their
voices.)
STEVIE
I got...I got....I got....
(straining)
....the wind knocked out of me.
This draws no sympathy from above, only LAUGHTER.
THE BOYS UP ABOVE
Staring excitedly.
3RD BOY
Looks like a cave or something.
2ND BOY
What's down there, Stevie? Anything?
OVER THE BOYS ABOVE
Stevie has gotten up, moving out of the patch of
sunlight. Disappearing from view for a moment. Then
reappearing, still spitting out dirt. But holding:
STEVIE
Human skull.
One side partially missing from the cranium. But it
brings WHOOPS of delight from the boys above.
3RD BOY
Toss it up here, dude.
STEVIE
No way, buttwipe. I found it. It's
mine.
ANGLE UP ON STEVIE
The other boys looking down at him. Stevie looking at
the skull. Strangely, the light shines through it. It is
milky, opaque, as if it's bone that's turned somehow
glassy in places. Then:
STEVIE
Anyways, there's bones all over the
place down here.
Stevie looks down at his feet. CAMERA FOLLOWING HIS LOOK
DOWN to where there are indeed more human bones. And
something else. He takes a couple of steps in place,
standing in a familiar BLACK, OILY substance -- which is
climbing up his tennis shoe from the rock floor, over
the edge of the shoe and down into the shoe itself. Then
the SKULL drops in the frame, clattering on the hard
floor of the cave.
CAMERA SLOWLY RISING UP FROM STEVIE'S SHOES
Following SUBCUTANEOUS WORMS which have begun locomoting
aggressively up his legs. As his whole body is WRACKED
by a shivering seizure of some kind.
CAMERA RISES, following the path of the worms as they
move up the legs of his shorts. Some appearing on his
bare arms, but the great majority continuing up to
Stevie's neck, toward his face. Stevie stands paralyzed.
Letting out guttural sounds not dissimilar to when the
wind was knocked out of him.
3RD BOY (O.S.)
Hey, Stevie....
But Stevie cannot answer him. CAMERA CONTINUING UP to
the boys above. Looking down at their friend. Their eyes
go wide.
2ND BOY
You okay?
But what they see next answers that question for them.
THEIR POV OF STEVIE
His face suddenly alive with the subcutaneous worms.
Moving toward his eyes which begin filling with BLACK
OIL. Looking much now like ALIEN EYES.
CLOSE ON THE BOYS ABOVE
Freaked by what they see. And doing what any kid would
do now.
3RD BOY
Hey, man. Let's get outta here.
And they do. Bolting from the hole in the top of the
cave. CAMERA PUSHING UP THROUGH THIS HOLE to REVEAL we
are:
As the LEAD FIREMAN steps down the ladder into the cave.
He scans the darkness, illuminated only by the shaft of
light permitted by the hole above. As the 2ND FIREMAN
drops down next to him. The both stand motionless now,
as if sensing something.
THEIR POV
Stevie's feet are just visible on the floor of the cave,
a short distance away.
RESUME FIREMEN - LOW ANGLE
They start cautiously toward Stevie. CAMERA FINDING
their feet. Tracking through the same OILY, BLACK
SUBSTANCE we saw bleeding from the creature thirty five
thousand years ago. As they move into the shadows, we
HOLD ON THE SUBSTANCE....and see it MOVE. It's alive.
TIME CUT TO:
As an elevator DINGS and the doors open. Scully and
Mulder exit into the lobby where people move in and out.
Heads turn due to their FBI jackets. (Included
atmosphere: a GROUP OF KIDS on a field trip, being led
into an elevator by THEIR TEACHER.)
SCULLY
I saw your face, Mulder. There was a
moment of panic.
MULDER
Panic? Have you ever seen me panic,
Scully?
SCULLY
I just did. You're buying.
Mulder fishes for change, but more out of
sportsmanship.
MULDER
Alright... what'll it be: Coke, Pepsi?
A saline IV?
SCULLY
Something sweet.
Scully flashes a thin victory smile, as Mulder heads
off.
Mulder moving to a door with a small shingle above it
which says SNACKS/BEVERAGES. As he approaches, sorting
through the change he's fished up, the door opens and A
MAN IN A VENDOR'S UNIFORM appears. He makes casual and
ever-so-brief eye contact with Mulder as he brushes past
him. Mulder making no note of this as he moves to catch
the door before it closes.
CUT TO:
Mulder takes a few steps down into the windowless room.
Moving past the snack machines to a LIGHTED soda
machine.
Finding the correct change and plunking it in. Hitting a
button, but... nothing comes out.
MULDER
Oh, come on.
He beats his fist a couple of times on the front of the
machine.
Nothing. He finds more change. Plunking it in. Hits the
button. Nothing. He stares at the machine a minute, then
BEATS IT HARD with his fist. Nothing.
Moving around to the back of the machine, looking for:
ANGLE ACROSS BACK OF MACHINE
Mulder's face peering in on the slim space between the
machine and the wall. Reaching down and lifting the PLUG
on the end of the electrical cord. It isn't plugged in.
Realizing now why the machine hasn't spit out his
sodas.
RESUME FRONT ANGLE ON MACHINE
As Mulder appears, stepping very lightly in front of the
machine that he was just pounding away on. Looking at
it, then moving quickly to the door he entered through.
Grasping the knob, but finding it... LOCKED. He jiggles
the knob, pulls on it. But there's no two ways about it,
he's locked in.
CUT TO:
Scully stands looking at her watch. Wondering where
Mulder is. When her CELL PHONE starts ringing. She
answers it.
SCULLY
Scully...
MULDER (FILTER)
Scully, I found the bomb.
SCULLY
(thinks he's joking)
Where are you, Mulder?
MULDER (FILTER)
I'm in the vending room.
Scully is on the move, but she doesn't believe him for a
second.
Scully appears, heard A POUNDING. Following this noise
to the door Mulder is obviously on the other side of.
Tries the door.
SCULLY
Is that you pounding?
Mulder holds his phone to his ear, using his other hand
to pound.
MULDER
Scully, get somebody to open this
door.
SCULLY (FILTER)
Nice try, Mulder.
CAMERA FOLLOWING MULDER as he steps back, revealing now
that he's gotten the hinged front of the coke machine
open. But we can't yet see what's inside.
MULDER
Scully -- listen to me. It's in the
coke machine. You've got about
fourteen minutes to get this building
evacuated.
Scully is shaking her head. Tries the door again.
SCULLY
C'mon. Open the door.
His response to this is MORE HARD POUNDING.
SCULLY
Mulder? Tell me this is a joke.
MULDER (FILTER)
Thirteen fifty nine, thirteen fifty
eight, thirteen fifty seven...
As he is doing this, Scully is bending to see:
THE KEYHOLE
It's been freshly soldered over.
Mulder stands pacing in front of:
AN ELABORATELY ENGINEERED EXPLOSIVE DEVICE
Wired with circuit boards, electric belts and generally
looking like it would take an expert a good long time to
figure out where to even start. A lot longer than the
13:58 that reads on the digital read-out.
MULDER
...thirteen fifty six...
SCULLY (FILTER)
Hang on. I'm gonna get you out of
there.
The line goes dead. And off Mulder's deepening anxiety,
we:
CUT TO:
Scully enters like General Patton, taking charge.
Barking at the security guards who sit behind their
security console.
SCULLY
I need this building evacuated and
cleared out in ten minutes! I need you
to get on the phone and tell the fire
department to block off the city
center in one mile radius around the
building --
SECURITY GUARD
In ten minutes.....?!
SCULLY
DON'T THINK! JUST PICK UP THE PHONE
AND MAKE IT HAPPEN!
And she's moving, dialing her cell phone now.
SCULLY
(into phone)
This is Special Agent Dana Scully. I
need to speak to S.A.C. Michaud. He's
got the wrong building --
CUT TO:
THE DIGITAL READ OUT hits 7:00. Pull back to REVEAL
MULDER staring at it. If he wasn't sweating enough on
the roof, he's certainly sweating now. When his cell
phone RINGS. Answering it.
MULDER
Scully?
SCULLY (FILTER)
Mulder. Move away from the door. We're
coming through it.
No sooner is this said than the CAMERA WHIPS OFF MULDER
to the door, where A GAS PLASMA TORCH FLAME is sizzling
along the hinges.
CUT TO:
Where Michaud himself, wearing a Kevlar vest now, is
wielding the torch. Expertly cutting the metal while
Scully and TWO AGENTS and TWO DALLAS BOMB SQUAD men look
on. In the b.g. BUILDING EMPLOYEES are streaming out.
Michaud finishes and shuts off the torch. Yelling:
S.A.C. MICHAUD
Go.
The other Agents kick the metal door in sending it
crashing to the floor. Mulder stands on the other side.
Watching Michaud pick up a heft tool kit, stepping over
the downed door.
Scully right behind him. Along with the Agents, Bomb
techs.
ANGLE OVER MULDER AND THE SODA MACHINE/BOMB
As Michaud steps in next to him, sizing up the time on
the ticking digital readout: 4:07. And just exactly what
kind of defusing work he's got cut out for him.
MULDER
Tell me this is just soda pop in those
canisters.
S.A.C. MICHAUD
No. It's what it looks like. A big
I.E.D. - ten gallons of astrolite.
(studying the bomb)
Okay, get everybody out of here and
clear the building.
MULDER
Somebody's got to stay with you --
S.A.C. MICHAUD
I gave you an order. Now get the hell
out of here and evacuate the area.
SCULLY
Can you defuse it?
Setting his tool kit down, opening it. As the other
Agents heed his word, exiting the room.
S.A.C. MICHAUD
I think so.
MULDER
You've got about four minutes to find
out if you're wrong.
Michaud turns on him with unexpected intensity.
S.A.C. MICHAUD
Did you hear what I said?
SCULLY
Let's go, Mulder.
Scully starts out. Mulder stares at Michaud for a
moment, but Michaud's focus is on the bomb now. He won't
meet Mulder's look. Finally Mulder moves off, following
Scully.
CAMERA HOLDS ON MICHAUD, just staring at the bomb. Just
staring.
CUT TO:
CLOSE ON BOMB. The seconds ticking off now, as it passes
the :30 mark. CAMERA PULLING BACK, ADJUSTING to Michaud.
His tool chest is closed up, and he is sitting on it
improbably. Still staring at the bomb, then pulling his
head down in what appears to be resignation. As the
seconds tick away.
CUT BACK TO:
S.A.C. MICHAUD
Sitting motionless in front of the bomb as the seconds
tick down. 8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1- --
HARD CUT BACK
TO:
A formal hearing. Several ASSISTANT DIRECTORS sit at a
head table, going over documents. NAME PLACECARDS in
front of them.
PANNING the group, the sound of papers shuffling, the
occasional clearing of a throat creating a stale air of
importance, under:
WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
...there is a heightened need at the
Attorney General's office to place
responsibility as early as possible.
CAMERA LANDING ON ASSISTANT DIRECTOR JANA CASSIDY
A no-nonsense 40 year-old lawyer cum FBI Agent.
CASSIDY
...for the catastrophic destruction of
public property and the loss of life
due to terrorist activities...
Next to Cassidy is Assistant Director WALTER SKINNER,
Mulder and Scully's former superior on the X-Files.
Looking ruefully at:
AGENT SCULLY
At a small table, the chair next to her conspicuously
empty.
CASSIDY
Many details are still unclear; some
agents' reports have not been filed,
or have come in sketchy, without a
satisfactory accounting of the events
that led to the destruction in Dallas.
But we're under some pressure to give
an accurate picture of what happened
to the Attorney General, so she can
issue a public statement.
The door to the room opens behind Scully now, and Mulder
enters, his manner that of a man who knows he's late to
a function.
RESUME A.D. CASSIDY
She looks up at Mulder and Scully with a stern glare.
CASSIDY
We now know that five people died in
the explosion. Special Agent in Charge
Darius Michaud who was trying to
defuse the bomb that had been hidden
in a vending machine. Three firemen
from Dallas, and a young boy.
OVER MULDER AND SCULLY
Mulder pulls out his chair to sit down, but remains
standing. They trade a look. This is new news to them.
MULDER
Excuse me -- the firemen and the boy
-- they were in the building?
CASSIDY
Agent Mulder, since you weren't able
to be on time for this hearing, I'm
going to ask you to step outside so
that we can get Agent Scully's version
of the facts. So that she won't have
to be paid the same disrespect.
MULDER
We were told the building was clear.
CASSIDY
You'll get your turn, Agent Mulder.
Please step out.
Mulder trades looks with:
A.D. SKINNER
Who stares at him evenly, but not unsympathetically.
He's been here with Mulder on many occasions. Seen
Mulder run up against the Bureau and its stiff
conventions. Always in the middle.
MULDER
It does say there in your paperwork
that we were the ones who found the
bomb...
CASSIDY
Thank you, Agent Mulder. We'll call
you in shortly.
RESUME MULDER, SCULLY
As Mulder slides his chair in. Scully watching him
exit.
CUT TO:
Mulder sits by himself in a chair, head down. When the
door to the hearing room opens. Mulder rising as A.D.
Skinner exits.
SKINNER
Sit down, they're still talking to
Agent Scully.
MULDER
About what?
SKINNER
-- They're asking her for a narrative.
They want to know why she was in the
wrong building.
MULDER
She was with me.
Skinner studies Mulder, shaking his head.
SKINNER
You don't see what's going on here, do
you?
(off Mulder's look)
There's four hundred million dollars
in damage to the city of Dallas. Lives
have been lost. No suspects have been
named. So the story being shaped is
this could have been prevented. That
the FBI didn't do its job.
MULDER
And they want to blame us?
SKINNER
Agent Mulder -- we both know that if
you and Agent Scully hadn't taken the
initiative to search the adjacent
building, you could have multiplied
the fatalities by a hundred --
MULDER
(grasping the irony)
But it's not the lives we saved. It's
the lives we didn't.
SKINNER
(reciting the dictum)
-- if it looks bad, it's bad for the
FBI --
MULDER
-- if they want someone to blame,
they can blame me. Agent Scully
doesn't deserve this.
SKINNER
She's in there right now saying the
same thing about you.
MULDER
I breached protocol. I broke contact
with the S.A.C. I ignored a primary
tactical rule and left him alone with
the device.
SKINNER
Agent Scully says it was she who
ordered you out of the building. That
you wanted to go back.
Mulder doesn't get to respond, because the door opens
again and Agent Scully exits. She looks like she's been
through it.
SCULLY
(to Skinner)
They're asking for you, Sir.
Skinner gives one last look to Mulder, then re-enters.
Leaving Mulder and Scully alone. Scully wearing a pained
look.
MULDER
Whatever you told them in there, you
don't have to protect me.
SCULLY
All I told them was the truth.
MULDER
They're trying to divide us on this,
Scully. We can't let them.
SCULLY
They have divided us, Mulder. They're
splitting us up.
MULDER
(beat)
What? What are you talking about?
SCULLY
I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow
for remediation and reassignment...
MULDER
Why?
SCULLY
I think you must have an idea. They
cited a history of problems relating
back to 1993.
MULDER
They were the ones that put us
together.
SCULLY
Because they wanted me to invalidate
your work, your investigations into
the paranormal. But I think this goes
deeper than that.
MULDER
This isn't about you, Scully. They're
doing this to me.
SCULLY
They're not doing this, Mulder.
(off his look)
I left behind a career in medicine
because I thought I might make a
difference at the FBI. When they
recruited me they told me women made
up nine percent of the bureau. I felt
this was not an impediment, but an
opportunity to distinguish myself. But
it hasn't turned out that way. And
now, if I were to be transferred to
Omaha, or Wichita or some field office
where I'm sure I could rise, it just
doesn't hold the interest for me it
once did. Not after what I've seen and
done.
MULDER
You're... quitting?
SCULLY
There's really no reason left for me
to stay anymore.
(off his look)
Maybe you should ask yourself if your
heart's still in it, too.
The door opens to the hearing room again now. A.D.
Skinner steps part way out, gesturing to him.
SKINNER
Agent Mulder. You're up.
SCULLY
(regretfully)
I'm sorry. Good luck.
Mulder rises. Scully studying his poorly disguised hurt.
Before he turns and goes into the room.
Scully watching the door close behind him. Her feelings
poorly disguised, too.
CUT TO:
CLOSE ON A SHOOTER OF TEQUILA being poured. CAMERA
ADJUSTING to reveal the ATTRACTIVE BARMAID tipping the
bottle. Pushing it across the bar to where TWO EMPTY
SHOOTERS sit, making the exchange.
BARMAID
I'd say this about exceeds your
minimum daily requirement.
The person she's talking to us:
MULDER
He sits by himself on a stool, staring down at the bar.
Staring at the shooter which he spins with his fingers.
BARMAID
Gotta train for this kind of heavy
lifting.
Mulder tosses back the shooter anyway. She watches him
as she retrieves the small shot glass, intrigued by his
dark silence.
BARMAID
Poopy day?
MULDER
Yup.
BARMAID
A woman?
(Mulder shakes his head no)
Work.
Mulder nods, pointing to the tequila bottle again. The
Barmaid agrees to pour another one, reluctantly.
ANGLE OVER TO A MAN AT THE END OF THE BAR
Staring at Mulder intently. He's older than Mulder,
dressed in an old Brooke Brothers light summer suit.
Mulder notices him, feels his gaze, but doesn't give it
thought.
RESUME BARMAID, MULDER
BARMAID
What do you do?
MULDER
What do I do.
(off her curious look)
I'm a key figure in an ongoing
government charade. An annoyance to my
superiors. A joke among my peers.
"Spooky," they call me. Spooky Mulder.
Whose sister was abducted by aliens
when he was a kid. Who now chases
little green men with a badge and a
gun, shouting to the heavens and
anyone who'll listen that the fix is
in. That our government's hip to the
truth and a part of the conspiracy.
That the sky is falling and when it
hits it's gonna be the shitstorm of
all time.
She stares at him for a moment, startled by his drunken
screed. She pulls back the shooter she's just poured
Mulder.
BARMAID
I think that about does it, Spooky.
MULDER
Does what?
BARMAID
Why don't you go home to the old lady
--
MULDER
Sorry. Don't have one.
Mulder slides off his stool, noticing:
MULDER'S POV
The Watchful Man is gone.
RESUME MULDER
He feints toward the door, then reverses direction.
Heads to the back of the place.
Mulder appears, moving to the bathroom door. Only to
find an OUT OF ORDER sign on it. He moves to the woman's
room, but it's locked. Gathering what's left of his
wits, Mulder does what any red-blooded man would do in
this situation. He goes to the back door of the bar and
exits into the alley.
Mulder is coming from the back. Kurtzweil moving to
catch up. And he does, at the coat stand. The place has
pretty much cleared out, except for the Barmaid and some
help.
MULDER
How'd you find me?
KURTZWEIL
Heard you come here now and again.
Figured you'd be needing a little
drinky tonight.
MULDER
You a reporter?
KURTZWEIL
I'm a doctor, but I think I mentioned
that. OB-GYN.
MULDER
Who sent you?
KURTZWEIL
I came on my own. After reading about
the bombing in Dallas.
MULDER
Well, if you've got something to tell
me, you've got as long as it takes me
to hail a cab...
Mulder starts out the door, but Kurtzweil grabs his
arm.
KURTZWEIL
They're going to pin Dallas on you,
Agent Mulder. But there was nothing
you could've done. Nothing anyone
could've done to prevent that bomb
from going off. Because the truth is
something you'd never have guessed;
never have predicted.
Mulder pulls away from Kurtzweil, but Kurtzweil dogs him
to:
Scully is in bed, lying awake. Staring at the ceiling.
When she reacts to a POUNDING AT HER DOOR.
CUT TO:
CLOSE ON THE FRONT DOOR. Scully peeks in the peephole.
Then she removes the safety chain, opening the door.
MULDER
(strangely intense)
I wake you?
SCULLY
No.
MULDER
Why not? It's three AM.
Scully gets a whiff of his breath. As he moves past her
into the apartment. Radiating a kind of manic
intensity.
SCULLY
Are you drunk, Mulder?
MULDER
I was until about an hour ago.
SCULLY
Is that before or after you got the
idea to come here?
Mulder looks at her curiously.
MULDER
What are you implying, Scully?
SCULLY
(frowning)
I thought you may have gotten drunk
and decided to come here to talk me
out of quitting.
MULDER
Is that what you'd like me to do?
Scully hesitates. Long enough to indicate her own
wavering heart.
SCULLY
Go home, Mulder. It's late.
MULDER
Get dressed, Scully.
SCULLY
Mulder -- what are you doing?
MULDER
Just get dressed. I'll explain on the
way.
CUT TO:
Flying at dangerously low altitude over the almost
featureless night landscape. Heading for something that
we see ahead in the distance. What looks like a LARGE
GLOWING DOME surrounded by the lights of a residential
area we've already seen, on the edge of suburban Dallas
sprawl.
CUT TO:
A SCIENTIST in a haz-mat suit is moving through the maze
of clear plastic tubing that divides work areas within
the tent. Areas where scientists are working at tables
doing what appears to be some kind of high-tech
archeological work. It is a hive of activity within, as
the Scientist leads us past the REFRIGERATION UNITS to
the earthen hole where Dr. Bronschweig (we've met him
earlier, coming out of a med-evac chopper that landed
when the tent city was erected) appears out of the
earthen hole, which is reason for all this excitement.
Climbing out A CLEAR HATCH which has been fashioned to
cover the hole. Seeing:
THE CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
Now suited up himself. Bronschweig approaches him.
CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
You've got something to show me.
DR. BRONSCHWEIG
(nervous excitement)
Yes.
CUT TO:
What we originally established as icy, and what later
became the unfrozen Texas field where the boys
discovered the human skull, has been turned to its
previously icy state. Thanks to two large vents that Dr.
Bronschweig is pointing at:
DR. BRONSCHWEIG
We brought the atmosphere back down to
freezing in order to control the
development, which is nothing like
we've ever seen.
CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
Brought on by what?
DR. BRONSCHWEIG
Heat, I think. The coincident invasion
of a host, the fireman, and an
environment that raised his basic body
temperature above ninety eight point
six.
They step over to a section of the cave which has been
draped with more plastic, the lights from inside this
are giving off a cool blue light (passing by TWO
PORTABLE DRILLING RIGS which have been erected, their
pumps moving up and down like rocking horses.)
Bronschweig pushes away the plastic, revealing A MAN
lying on a gurney draped in plastic. he is hooked up to
various and sundry machines which are monitoring his
life signs.
His skin has turned almost translucent, the veins and
capillaries now clearly visible, as is his pulse. His
heartbeat sending life-sustaining blood and energy
through his body.
CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
This man's still alive.
DR. BRONSCHWEIG
Technically and biologically, though
he'll never recover.
The CSM is shaking his head in nervous, uneasy wonder.
CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
How can this be?
DR. BRONSCHWEIG
The developing organism is using his
life energy, digesting bone and
tissue. We've just slowed the
process.
Bronschweig redirects a light so that it shines hard
into the man's face and; then we see it. Movement.
CLOSE ON MAN'S FACE
Though the man's eyes still blink occasionally, we can
actually see through his tissue and the bones in his
skull to see something IS LIVING INSIDE HIM.
ANGLE UP ON CSM AND BRONSCHWEIG
The Cigarette Smoking Man's mind is working intently on
all the possibilities, and consequences.
DR. BRONSCHWEIG
Do you want me to destroy this one,
too? Before it gestates?
CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
No. No...we need to try our vaccine on
it.
DR. BRONSCHWEIG
And if it's unsuccessful?
CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
Incinerate it. Like the others.
DR. BRONSCHWEIG
This man's family will want to see the
body laid to rest.
CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
Tell them he was trying to save the
young boy's life, and that he died
heroically like the other firemen.
DR. BRONSCHWEIG
Of what?
CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
They seemed to buy our story about the
Hanta virus. You'll make sure the
families are taken care of
financially, along with a sizeable
donation to the community.
(beat)
Maybe a small roadside memorial.
He watches the CSM exit, then back to the prostrate
fireman.
CLOSE ON PROSTRATE FIREMAN
There is more movement within his body. Within his chest
and neck, as if the creature gestating inside is
continuing to stretch and grow. So that now we can see
one of its BLACK EYES staring from through the clear
flesh of the fireman. An eye which BLINKS at us. As we:
CUT TO:
Mulder and Scully appear at the end of a long hall.
Moving TOWARD CAMERA where a YOUNG NAVAL GUARD sits in
f.g. As a LEGEND appears, to establish.
Mulder and Scully moving the long distance to the
Guard's station. Where the Guard looks up at them with
military scrutiny.
YOUNG NAVAL GUARD
ID and floor you're visiting.
They both show their FBI IDs.
MULDER
We're going to the morgue.
YOUNG NAVAL GUARD
That area is currently off limits to
anyone other than authorized medical
personnel.
MULDER
On whose orders?
YOUNG NAVAL GUARD
General McAddie's.
Mulder doesn't miss a beat.
MULDER
General McAddie is who requested our
coming here. We were awakened at three
AM and told to get down here
immediately.
YOUNG NAVAL GUARD
I don't know anything about that.
MULDER
Well, call General McAddie.
YOUNG NAVAL GUARD
I don't have his number.
MULDER
They can patch you in through the
switchboard.
The Guard is nervous about this, checking his watch. He
picks up the phone, going through a large directory.
MULDER
Hey! We don't have time to dick around
here watching you demonstrate your
ignorance in the chain of command. The
order came direct from General
McAddie. Call him. We'll conduct our
business while you confirm
authorization.
Mulder is already directing Scully past the Naval Guard
who tentatively picks up the phone again.
YOUNG NAVAL GUARD
(to their backs)
Why don't you go on ahead head and
I'll confirm authorization.
MULDER
Thank you.
LEADING Mulder and Scully, moving they've pulled off a
con.
MULDER
Why is a morgue suddenly off limits on
orders of a general?
CUT TO:
TRACKING TABLE HEIGHT across gurneys where white
sheet-wrapped bodies lie. CAMERA LANDING ON Scully.
Standing next to Mulder who is undoing the peculiar
ropey stitching on the sheet used to secure the bodies.
SCULLY
This is one of the firemen who died in
Dallas?
MULDER
According to this tag.
SCULLY
And you're looking for?
SCULLY
I can tell you that without even
looking at him.
(off Mulder's look)
Conclusive organ failure due to
proximal exposure to source and flying
debris.
Scully pulls out an autopsy report that was laid on the
gurney under the body of the sheet-wrapped corpse.
SCULLY
This body has already been autopsied,
Mulder. You can tell from the way it's
been wrapped and dressed.
Undeterred, Mulder works to get the sheet off. The first
thing we notice is that he's still in his fireman's
uniform. His face looks familiar to us, not because we
know him, but because of the translucency of skin we saw
in the other fireman. (We will also notice he's
missing an arm, a leg and large part of his torso.)
MULDER
Does this fit the description you just
read me, Scully?
Scully comes around, reacting to what she sees.
SCULLY
Oh my God. This man's tissue...
Scully is quickly removing a pair of latex gloves,
stretching them on to palpate the man's tissue.
MULDER
It's like jelly.
SCULLY
There's some kind of cellular
breakdown. It's completely edematous.
She palpates the spongy skin on the man's face, neck.
Unbuttoning the uniform now, seeing:
SCULLY
And there's been no autopsy performed.
There's no Y incision here; no
internal exam.
MULDER
You're telling me the cause of death
on the report is false. That this man
didn't die from an explosion, or from
flying debris.
SCULLY
I don't know what killed this man. I'm
not sure if anybody else could claim
to either.
Off Mulder's reaction to this:
CUT TO:
The gurney with the fireman is pushed through a pair of
swinging doors into the darkened lab. Scully flips the
lights on, looking around at the giant facility.
SCULLY
(pushing him)
You knew this man didn't die at the
bomb site before we got here.
MULDER
I'd been told as much.
SCULLY
You're saying the bombing was a
cover-up. Of what?
MULDER
I don't know. But I have a hunch what
you're going to find here isn't
anything that can be categorized or
easily referenced.
SCULLY
Mulder, this is going to take some
time, and somebody's going to figure
out soon enough we're not even
supposed to be here.
(beat)
I'm in serious violation of medical
ethics.
MULDER
We're being blamed for these deaths.
Scully, I want to know what this man
died of. Don't you?
Scully stares at Mulder, then back down at the body. How
can she refuse, given the finality and the personal
appeal of the request? After a moment's hesitation, she
turns to the body, and to the tray table of tools
nearby. Resigned, if not resolved.
CUT TO:
OVER MULDER to the street: Where the taxi is moving
forward toward a spot where two ARLINGTON PD cruisers
are pulled up to the curb. Mulder checks the address he
has written down.
MULDER
(to the Cabbie)
I think this is it up here.
There are UNIFORMED OFFICERS inside, and a DETECTIVE.
Mulder steps into an office. FOUR PAIRS of eyes give him
the once over. The Detective stepping over to him.
MULDER
Is this Dr. Kurtzweil's residence?
DETECTIVE
(suspiciously)
You got some kind of business with
him?
MULDER
I'm looking for him.
DETECTIVE
Looking for him for what?
Mulder pulls out his ID, flashes it at the Detective.
DETECTIVE
(to his partners)
Feds are looking for him, too.
(turns to Mulder)
Real nice business he's got, huh?
MULDER
What's that?
DETECTIVE
Selling naked pictures of little kids
over his computer.
Mulder nods, though this is news to him. He steps in a
little further, noticing a shelf lined with books. Their
spines all have the author's name written large: DR.
ALVIN KURTZWEIL.
Mulder picks up one of these books, with the title: THE
FOUR HORSEMEN OF THE GLOBAL DOMINATION CONSPIRACY.
DETECTIVE
You looking for him for some other
reason?
MULDER
Yeah, I had an appointment for a
pelvic examination.
They stare at Mulder like he's a sicko. He smiles and
they break into RAUCOUS LAUGHTER.
DETECTIVE
You want a call if we turn up
Kurtzweil?
MULDER
No. Don't bother.
Mulder puts the book back among the others on the shelf.
And exits. Onto:
Agent Scully wears a surgical mask, latex gloves.
Working on the body of the fireman...when she reacts to
a NOISE. Doors opening, closing somewhere o.s. CAMERA
MEDIUM WHIPS to a door where she and Mulder entered the
morgue. Where...the Young Naval Guard and TWO MPs push
through and enter. They stand looking at:
THEIR POV
Where Scully stood moments ago, there is now just an
unattended gurney. A sheet over the fireman's body.
Scully is gone.
RESUME YOUNG NAVAL GUARD, MPs
Tense. Listening, watchful. Moving into the room.
CUT TO:
Scully enters the space where she and Mulder found the
fireman's body. Trying to quietly click the door shut.
Standing now near the door, tense, listening. When the
CHIRPING of her cell phone breaks the tense silence. She
pats frantically at her coat, trying to get it answered
before it rings again. Unsuccessfully. Finally getting
a hold of it and hitting the send button. Scully sits
breathing heavy, nervous breaths -- waiting for the
Young Naval Guard to come running in.
MULDER'S VOICE (FILTER)
Scully...?
She puts the phone slowly up to her face.
SCULLY
(low whisper)
Yeah.
INTERCUT WITH:
Mulder's at the pay phone.
MULDER
Why are you whispering?
SCULLY
I can't really talk right now.
MULDER
What did you find?
SCULLY
Evidence of a massive infection.
MULDER
What kind of infection?
SCULLY
I don't know.
MULDER
Scully -- listen to me. I'm going
home, then I'm booking a flight to
Dallas. I'm getting you a ticket,
too.
SCULLY
Mulder --
MULDER
I need you there with me. I need your
expertise on this. The bomb we found
was meant to destroy those bodies and
whatever they were infected by.
SCULLY
I've got a hearing tomorrow --
MULDER
-- I'll have you back for it, Scully.
Maybe with evidence that could blow
that meeting away.
SCULLY
Mulder -- I can't -- I'm already way
past the point of common sense here
--
Scully hears VOICES in the hall outside the freezer.
CUT TO:
MULDER
MULDER
Scully...? Hello...?
But the line OFF, goes dead. Mulder
hangs up the
phone, frustrated. Exits the booth in a hurry.
CUT TO:
The door opens and the Young Naval Guard steps inside,
followed by the MPs. Moving into the room.
LOW ANGLE - TRACKING
with the Naval Guard's feet as they pass by the rolling
carts on which bodies are laid. TRACKING to find SCULLY,
where she hides under one of the carts. Huddled and
cold.
The Guard's feet stop near here. He stands motionless
for a moment, then moves off. HOLD her until the door
slams shut.
enters a forensics lab with a FIELD AGENT. A LEGEND
reads: FBI FIELD OFFICE, DALLAS : 11:20 AM.
FIELD AGENT
You're looking for what amounts to a
needle in a haystack. I'm afraid the
explosion was so devastating there
hasn't been a whole lot we've been
able to put together just yet.
They are walking amid BOXES of evidence. STACKS of
debris. There are FORENSIC TECHS sorting through this
material. It looks like the most tedious and painstaking
job in the world.
MULDER
I'm looking for anything out of the
ordinary. Maybe something from the
FEMA offices where the bodies were
found.
FIELD AGENT
We weren't expecting to find those
remains, of course. They went right
off to Washington.
MULDER
Was there anything in those offices
that didn't go to D.C.?
FIELD AGENT
Some bone fragments came up in the
sift this morning. We thought there'd
been another fatality, but we found
out FEMA had recovered them from an
archeological site out of town.
MULDER
Have you examined them?
FIELD AGENT
No. Just fossils, far as I know.
Mulder is nodding, when both men look off at something
that's caught their attention o.s.
MULDER
I'd like this person to take a look,
if you don't mind.
THEIR POV - AGENT SCULLY
Standing in the doorway to the lab. She looks at Mulder
as if she's come in spite of her misgivings. Moving
toward them now.
FIELD AGENT
Let me just see if I can lay my hands
on what you're looking for.
The Field Agent nods to Scully as he passes, exiting
deeper into the room. Leaving Mulder and Scully by
themselves momentarily.
MULDER
You said you weren't coming?
SCULLY
I wasn't planning on it. Particularly
after spending a half hour in cold
storage this morning. But I got a
better look at the blood and tissue
samples I took from the firemen.
MULDER
What did you find?
SCULLY
(voice lowering pointedly)
Something I couldn't show to anyone
else. Not without more information.
And not without causing the kind of
attention I'd just as soon avoid right
now.
(off Mulder's look)
The virus those men were infected with
contains a protein coat I've never
seen before. What it did to them it
did extremely fast. And unlike the
AIDS virus or any other aggressive
strain, it survives very nicely
outside the body.
MULDER
How was it contracted?
SCULLY
That I don't know. But if it's through
simple contact of blood to blood, and
if it doesn't respond to conventional
treatments, it could be a serious
health threat.
Mulder's reaction is postponed, or at least subdued by
the reappearance of the field agent.
FIELD AGENT
Like I said, these are fossils, and
they weren't near the blast center, so
they aren't going to tell you much.
SCULLY
May I?
He offers Scully the small glass vials in which the bone
fragments have been separated. She takes them, looking
at them on her way over to the microscope. Tapping out a
tiny fragment onto the viewing bed. She puts her eyes
down to the stereoscope eyepieces, then almost
immediately looks up at Mulder who translates this look
almost instantly.
MULDER
You said you knew the location of the
archeological site where these were
found.
FIELD AGENT
Show you right on a map.
Off Mulder and Scully's traded looks:
CUT TO:
An electric Bobcat-like bulldozer maneuvers a very high
tech-looking CLEAR CONTAINER to the edge of the earthen
hole. The container has monitors and gauges on it,
oxygen tanks and what looks like a circulation
refrigeration unit. A self-contained life support
system. The inside of the container is covered with a
thin layer of frost.
When the small bulldozer gets the container over near
the hole, several technicians lift it down off the
shovel, hand carrying it toward the hole opening. As Dr.
Bronschweig APPEARS, moving to a ladder that leads down
into the hole. He's dressed in a haz-mat suit, with the
hood off.
DR. BRONSCHWEIG
I need to have those settings checked
and re-set. I need a steady minus two
Celsius through the transfer of the
body, after I administer the vaccine.
The men nod to Bronschweig, begin checking the settings
as Bronschweig puts his hood on, starts down into the
hole, through the clear hatch.
The refrigeration vents are still pumping in arctic air
when Dr. Bronschweig appears descending a fixed ladder.
It is dark in here, save for the ice blue glow of light
coming from the plastic draped area where we saw the
fireman acting as an incubator/host for some kind of
organism growing inside him.
Bronschweig steps over to this area, moves aside the
plastic drapery to enter.
ANGLE INSIDE, PLASTIC LINED AREA
Where the body of the fireman is still inside the
quarantine bubble litter in f.g. Bronschweig takes out of
his pocket a SYRINGE and an AMPULE. Turning now to the
body. Stepping to it. Moving a work light, as he had
done for the Cigarette Smoking Man, so that it shines on
the face of the fireman. But when he does this,
Bronschweig nearly JUMPS, his breath stolen away.
Reacting to:
ANGLE ON FIREMAN'S BODY
The chest and torso have imploded. It has been turned
into a muddy mass of blood-stained jelly; bone and
tissue melted into an oozing mass which has sunken due
to the fact that the creature which was inside is now
gone.
CAMERA WHIPS from Bronschweig to the wall. To the
temperature gauge which reads about 6 degrees Celsius.
WHIPPING BACK to Bronschweig who is now panicked.
INTERCUT WITH:
ANGLE DOWN ON EARTHEN HOLE, where the Technicians
Bronschweig was speaking to minutes ago react to
Bronschweig's MUFFLED VOICE. He's down below them in the
cave, looking up.
Pulling his haz-mat hood off. Yelling up to them.
DR. BRONSCHWEIG
It's gone!
TECHNICIAN
It's what?
OVER THE TECHNICIANS TO BRONSCHWEIG DOWN BELOW
DR. BRONSCHWEIG
It's left the body. I think it's
gestated --
Bronschweig is starting up the ladder when something
stops him.
CREATURE'S POV OF BRONSCHWEIG
He stands frozen on the ladder, squinting into the
darkness.
DR. BRONSCHWEIG
Wait -- I see it --
BRONSCHWEIG'S POV
In the shadows there is movement, the creature edging
into the light cast from the draped area. We see it is
fully formed -- a replica of the Creature we saw at the
opening of our story. Though it does not make any kind
of aggressive move. As if, newborn, it is tentative.
RESUME BRONSCHWEIG - CREATURE'S POV
He remains standing on a rung of the ladder for a
moment, then takes a gentle step back down to the
ground.
DR. BRONSCHWEIG
(nervous wonder)
Oh my god. Oh my god.
TECHNICIAN
You see it?
DR. BRONSCHWEIG
Yes. It's...amazing. You want to get
down here --
(sotto to himself)
Jesus Lord...so much for little green
men.
Dr. Bronschweig moves shakily to put the syringe in the
ampule again...when, suddenly, the Creature STRIKES.
CAMERA RUSHING FORWARD TO BRONSCHWEIG.
MATCH CUT TO:
OVERHEAD ANGLE - OVER THE TECHNICIANS
As the Creature slams into Bronschweig, knocking him out
of the line of sight from the top of the earthen hole.
There are SCREAMS OF PAIN from Bronschweig, then they
abate.
Bronschweig can be heard, but not clearly seen. He is in
the shadows himself now.
Trying to pick himself up, and when he manages to do
this, teetering back into the light we see that he is
bloodied. He is hurt, injured. Making his way back
toward the patch of light that comes from the hole
above. Hoping to see that help is on its way, while
keeping a watchful, wary and worried eye on the shadows,
for another attack by the Creature.
DR. BRONSCHWEIG
Hey -- I need help.
But the Technicians looking down on him offer him
nothing of the sort. All they do is quickly close the
clear hatch that seals Bronschweig inside the cave.
DR. BRONSCHWEIG
Hey!
But he gets no answer, climbing the ladder shakily. A
moment later the first Bobcat shovel-full of dirt falls
onto the clear hatch and partially obscures the light.
They are burying Bronschweig alive.
ANGLE DOWN ON BRONSCHWEIG through the glass hatch. His
SCREAMS continue. ADJUSTING to the small bulldozer which
is quickly hauling the mound of excavated earth into the
hole from which it came. While, all around, there is a
hive of activity. Men running everywhere.
CUT TO:
Bronschweig reacts in silent horror now, only to turn in
further horror when he feels the impending attack of:
THE CREATURE
Right behind and just below him. Its grotesque features
in momentary high resolution, BEFORE IT ATTACKS CAMERA.
Over and over, savaging Bronschweig in a violent fury.
Its hideous teeth tearing at his flesh - AT CAMERA -
driving him off the ladder where the attack continues in
momentary glimpses of teeth, of bloody flesh, and of
OILY BLACK BLOOD being spattered about. At the
height of the violence we hear Bronschweig SCREAM.
Matching the wound of this, as we:
CUT TO:
EVENING
The Well-Manicured Man enters, picks up a blinking line.
Through a window he can still see the children playing.
WELL-MANICURED MAN
Yes.
CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
(FILTER)
We have a situation. The members are
assembling.
WELL-MANICURED MAN
Is it an emergency?
(NEXT LOC.)
CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
Yes. A meeting is set. Tonight in
London, to determine a course.
WELL-MANICURED MAN
Who called this meeting?
CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
Strughold. He's just gotten on a plane
in Tunis.
This pronouncement has the power of ending any further
questions. An immediate sense of gravity of the
situation. The W.M.M. hangs up, moves to the window
where he sees some of the HELP is running from the
house. The children have all gathered around a BOY who
seems to have hurt himself. He's lifted and being
carried by the man who's called the W.M.M. into the
house.
Off the Well-Manicured Man's concern, we:
CUT TO:
The Well-Manicured Man is admitted by a Valet. The
interior has the well-heeled look of money, or a finely
appointed residence that no one lives in. The Valet
takes the W.M.M.'s coat.
WELL-MANICURED MAN
Has Strughold arrived?
VALET
They're in the library.
He leads the W.M.M. down a hall, to:
A GROUP OF MEN are standing, looking at something on a
TV monitor. A surveillance video. They turn when the
W.M.M. enters. CAMERA FAVORING A SMALL LEAN MAN with
close-cropped hair.
He is at once elegant and imposing with eyes that hold
you with laser-like acuity. He is CONRAD STRUGHOLD.
The others are of various ethnicities, tailored and
dignified. This might be a collection of U.N. delegates.
Indeed some are.
Their business here, however, doesn't represent anyone's
interests but their own. As tipped by the attendance of
a GROUP ELDER from the U.S. who we've come to know.
But, more importantly, by the Cigarette Smoking Man who
holds the VCR remote. He pauses the picture.
STRUGHOLD
We began to worry. Some of us have
traveled so far, and you are the last
to arrive.
WELL-MANICURED MAN
I'm sorry. My grandson fell and broke
his leg.
The non-response to this has the same effect as a
reprimand. But the W.M.M. will not apologize of kowtow.
STRUGHOLD
While we've been made to wait, we've
watched surveillance tapes which have
raised more concerns.
The Well-Manicured Man glances to the TV, sees the
frame paused.
HIS POV OF TV MONITOR
Where Mulder and Scully's faces are seen in a hallway
that we recognize as the Bethesda Naval Hospital.
RESUME WELL-MANICURED MAN
WELL-MANICURED MAN
More concerns than that?
STRUGHOLD
We've been forced to reassess our role
in Colonization by new facts of
biology which have presented
themselves.
GROUP ELDER
(speaking up)
The virus has mutated.
WELL-MANICURED MAN
On its own?
CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
Its effect on the host has changed.
The virus no longer just invades the
brain as a controlling organism. It's
developed a way to modify the host
body.
WELL-MANICURED MAN
Into what?
STRUGHOLD
A new extraterrestrial biological
entity.
It takes a moment to sink in. The weight of this fact.
WELL-MANICURED MAN
My god...
STRUGHOLD
The geometry of mass infection
presents certain conceptual
re-evaluations for us. About our place
in their Colonization.
WELL-MANICURED MAN
This isn't Colonization, it's
spontaneous repopulation. All our
work... if it's true, then they've
been using us all along. We've been
laboring under a lie!
2ND ELDER
It could be an isolated case.
WELL-MANICURED MAN
How can we know?!
STRUGHOLD
We're going to tell them what we've
found. What we've learned. Turn over a
body infected with the gestating
organism.
WELL-MANICURED MAN
In hope of what? Learning that it's
true?! That we are nothing more than
digestives for the creation of a new
race of alien lifeforms?!
STRUGHOLD
Let me remind you who is the new race.
And who is the old.
(beat)
What could be gained by withholding
anything from them; By pretending to
ignorance? Our knowledge may forestall
their plans to step up the timetable.
To start Colonization early.
WELL-MANICURED MAN
And if it doesn't? By cooperating now
we're but beggars to our demise! Our
ignorance was in cooperating with the
Colonists at all.
STRUGHOLD
Cooperation is our only chance of
saving ourselves.
CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
They still need us to carry out their
preparations.
STRUGHOLD
We'll continue to use them as they do
us. If only to play for more time, to
continue work on our vaccine.
WELL-MANICURED MAN
Our vaccine may have no effect!
STRUGHOLD
Well, without a cure for the virus,
we're nothing more than digestives
anyway.
All eyes go to the Well-Manicured Man. He is respected,
if not the odd man out in this room. But he is all
restrained anger now.
WELL-MANICURED MAN
My lateness may have well been
absence. A course has already been
taken.
CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
There are complications.
He turns back to the TV monitor where Mulder and Scully
remain frozen on the screen.
WELL-MANICURED MAN
Do they know?
CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
Mulder was in Dallas when we were
trying to dispose of evidence. He's
gone back there again. Someone has
tipped him.
WELL-MANICURED MAN
Who?
CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
Kurtzweil, we think.
STRUGHOLD
We've allowed this man his freedom.
His books have actually helped us to
facilitate plausible denial. Has he
outlived his usefulness to us?
WELL-MANICURED MAN
No one believes Kurtzweil or his
books. He's a toiler. A crank.
STRUGHOLD
And Mulder?
ELDER
Our new situation makes us vulnerable.
If he learns information as we do, he
could jeopardize the Project's
secrecy.
2ND ELDER
Control of information means control
of Mulder.
CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
I can control Mulder. I've always
controlled Mulder.
STRUGHOLD
This may take another approach.
He says this, casting his look toward the Well-Manicured
Man. A look of cold malevolence. The W.M.M.'s reaction
is disdain.
WELL-MANICURED MAN
You can't kill Mulder. He's got too
much light on him.
STRUGHOLD
You need not kill a man to destroy
him.
WELL-MANICURED MAN
(personalizing the
inference)
No, you need only take away what is
most precious to him.
HARD CUT TO:
Mulder at the wheel, foot to the floor. Scully's got a
map out. The mood is urgent, tense.
MULDER
Unmarked tanker trucks... what are
archaeologists hauling out in tanker
trucks?
SCULLY
I don't know, Mulder.
MULDER
And where are they going with it?
SCULLY
That's the first question to answer,
if we're going to find them.
CUT BACK TO:
Mulder's got his hand on his face rubbing his eyes.
MULDER
What are my choices?
SCULLY
About a hundred miles of nothing in
each direction.
MULDER
Where would they be going?
SCULLY
We've got two choices. One of them is
wrong.
They are both looking in different directions. The car
idling.
MULDER
You think they went left?
SCULLY
I don't know why I think they went
right.
A few moments of silence. Then Mulder steps on the gas
and goes straight. Heading out onto the only unpaved
road. Accelerating away.
Scully looks at him, wondering. As they bump along at
speed. Mulder won't look at her for a few moments. Then,
turning to her:
MULDER
Five years together -- how many times
have I been wrong.
DISSOLVE TO:
Mulder pulls open the steel door leading in. It opens
with a SUCKING SOUND which suggests the interior is
pressurized. And as he and Scully step in -- they both
JUMP when LARGE FANS just overhead hit them both with
hard blasts of air.
Stepping quickly out of the downward blasting air, into
the still silence of the space beyond.
SCULLY
Cool in here. Temperature's being
regulated.
MULDER
For the purpose of what?
HIGH OVERHEAD ANGLE
Our view is down through the crosswires and cables that
create the tension support. The effect is a combination
of simplicity and perfect function. Stark and high tech.
The flooring is gray and flat, featureless. But we don't
yet see from this angle exactly what the white domed
tent houses.
Though the air is still and there is no movement of any
kind, there is a sound that permeates the interior. A
STEADY HUM. Almost electrical hum, but different.
Mulder and Scully move together toward the middle of the
space.
WIDE ON TENT - MULDER AND SCULLY'S POV
Laid out in a grid, low to the ground, are what look
like BOXES. Fixed in place like roof vents, except these
are on the floor, no more than three feet tall, and
about the same measure square.
NEW ANGLE - TRACKING WITH MULDER AND SCULLY
As they continue to move cautiously, walking out into
the grid of box-shaped objects. Coming to the center of
the capacious, arena-sized space. Standing over one of
the mysterious boxes, which we now see have LOUVERED
TOPS. The louvers, however, are shut so that whatever is
inside the boxes cannot be seen.
SCULLY
I think we're on top of something. I
think these are some kind of venting.
Mulder lays his head and ear to the top of the box.
MULDER
You hear that?
SCULLY
I hear the humming. Like electricity.
High voltage maybe.
MULDER
Maybe. Maybe not.
Scully looks skyward.
SCULLY
What do you think those are for?
Mulder takes his ear off the box, looking up now, too.
THEIR POV
At the top of the dome are two LARGE corresponding
LOUVER VENTS.
RESUME MULDER AND SCULLY
Looking up at these vents.
CUT TO:
HIGH WIDE ANGLE OVER MULDER AND SCULLY, staring up JUST
PAST CAMERA at the louvered vents at top center of the
tent. When A LOUD METALLIC NOISE makes them jump.
AGENTS POV THE LOUVERED VENTS ABOVE THEM
One of the vents is opening automatically, its large
metal louvers straining from their flat closed position
into an up-and-down open position. When this is
complete, the SECOND LOUVER does the same.
The straining sound of galvanized metal-on-metal.
LOW ANGLE ON MULDER AND SCULLY
As Mulder turns his look from the ceiling back down to
the mysterious box they're standing next to. Something
occurs to him. Something frightening.
MULDER
Scully....?
SCULLY
Yeah...?
MULDER
Run.
Mulder grabs her hand, pulling her along. Though she
doesn't know why. Or what's about to happen. TRACKING
FAST WITH THEM as Mulder leads her back toward the door
they entered, which is a good hundred yards away.
SCULLY
(yelling, on the run)
What are you doing?
MULDER
(yelling back)
Come on!
When the LOUVERED VENTS on all the low grid-arranged
boxes OPEN IN DOMINO-LIKE SUCCESSION -- out of them
pouring THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF BEES, rapidly filling
the atmosphere of the domed space.
As if the insects are being shot out of non-stop
cannons.
HIGH ANGLE
THICK STREAMS of bees head RIGHT AT CAMERA, flying for
the open louvers at the top of the dome. As Mulder and
Scully run for it down below.
TRACKING WITH MULDER AND SCULLY
Scully's hand slipping from Mulder's as she pulls her
jacket up over her head. Mulder doing the same now,
ducking his head inside his own jacket. The Agents are
slowed by the bees but still make their zigzag way
toward the door -- bees clinging to their clothes. But
motion seems to be the key.
As Mulder RUNS TOWARD CAMERA -- where the downward blast
of air knocks all the bees off him. In the b.g., we see
that Scully has fallen behind. Still running, but losing
her way in the process, losing her bearings as the
thickening swarm of bees descends.
CLOSE ON SCULLY
When Mulder enters frame, jacket pulled over his head
again. Taking Scully by the back of her coat and
swinging her toward the direction of the door.
Whipsnapping her the rest of the distance to the
doorfans. Following right behind her as the fans
BLASTING them and the Agents continue right out the
doors. To:
CLOSE ON A FILE
Being leafed through by a woman's hands. CAMERA TILTING
UP to Special Agent Cassidy, the woman we met earlier
running the OPR hearing. She takes a quick glance at her
watch, looking up when:
THE DOOR TO THE ROOM
opens. A beat, then Skinner enters with a wearied look.
SKINNER
She's coming in.
Skinner ducks his head back out to look at:
INTERCUT WITH:
Where Scully stands looking into the glass of a display
case, trying to put her hair and clothes and person
together. She's still in the same clothes we saw her in.
Seeing Skinner now moving toward him.
RESUME OPR HEARING ROOM
Scully enters past Skinner. Though she has straightened
them, and her hair, there is no mistaking that she's
been to the dust bowl and back to get here. Her manner
is chastened.
Scully tries to keep her eyes on the table where she'll
be sitting. Venturing only a brief, polite look to:
ANGLE TO INCLUDE CASSIDY AND THE OTHER PANEL MEMBERS
They reshuffle their papers, pulling up their chairs.
Ready to get down to business now.
CASSIDY
Special Agent Scully --
SCULLY
I apologize for making you wait --
I've brought some new evidence with me
--
CASSIDY
Evidence of what?
CLOSE PROFILE ON SCULLY
Reaching into her satchel, pulling out an evidence bag.
Whatever she's reaching for she's reluctant to present
with confidence.
SCULLY
These are fossilized bone fragments
I've been able to study, gathered from
the bomb site in Dallas...
As Scully speaks we see A BEE crawl out from under the
collar of her suit jacket, crawling toward the back of
her neck. Crawling slowly, as if stretching its legs
from its long journey. CAMERA DOLLYING around Scully as
the bee does, moving into an OVER to:
CASSIDY
You've been back to Dallas?
SCULLY
Yes.
CASSIDY
Are you going to let us in on what
exactly you're trying to prove --
SCULLY
That the bombing in Dallas may have
been to destroy the bodies of those
firemen, so their deaths and the
reason for them wouldn't have to be
explained --
CASSIDY
(challenging)
-- those are very serious allegations,
Agent Scully --
SCULLY
Yes. I know.
There is a hush of murmured responses to this, the panel
members speaking to one another. Assistant Director
Skinner shifts uneasily in his chair. He's been here
before with Agents Mulder and Scully. He's sensing
something outrageous.
CASSIDY
And you have conclusive evidence of
this? Something to tie this claim of
yours to the crime --
SCULLY
(grudgingly)
Nothing completely conclusive --
We have returned to the OVER ANGLE on Scully, where we
see the BEE just below her jacket collar on the back of
her neck.
It CRAWLS back under her collar, DISAPPEARING from
sight.
SCULLY
I hope to. We're working to develop
this evidence --
CASSIDY
Working with?
SCULLY
Agent Mulder.
Off Cassidy's knowing nod, a general shifting in chairs,
we:
CUT TO:
Mulder pushes through the front, scanning the room for:
ANGLE ON KURTZWEIL
Sitting at a booth at the dark rear of the
establishment. Mulder enters frame, sitting down across
from him. Kurtzweil is jumpy, but he sees from Mulder's
expression that something's up.
KURTZWEIL
You found something?
MULDER
Yes. On the Texas border. Some kind of
experiment. Something they excavated
was brought there in tanker trucks.
KURTZWEIL
What?
MULDER
I'm not sure. A virus --
KURTZWEIL
-- You saw this experiment?
MULDER
What did it look like?
MULDER
There were bees. And corn crops.
Kurtzweil smiles at Mulder, laughs with nervous
excitement. Mulder doesn't quite realize it yet, but
this is news to him.
MULDER
What are they?
Kurtzweil slides from his seat, rising.
KURTZWEIL
What do you think?
MULDER
A transportation system. Transgenic
crops. The pollen genetically altered
to carry a virus.
KURTZWEIL
That would be my guess.
MULDER
Your guess?
But Kurtzweil doesn't respond to this. He's moving
toward the back of the bar. Mulder slides out, pursuing
him.
ANGLE ON BARMAID
The few PATRONS sitting at the bar, all turning in
reaction to this sudden flurry of activity.
Near the bathrooms. Mulder catches up to Kurtzweil.
MULDER
What do you mean, your guess?
Kurtzweil doesn't stop. So Mulder must physically stop
him.
MULDER
You told me you had answers.
KURTZWEIL
Yeah, well I don't have them all.
MULDER
You've been using me --
KURTZWEIL
I've been using you?!
MULDER
You didn't know my father --
KURTZWEIL
I told you -- he and I were old
friends --
MULDER
You're a liar. You lied to me to
gather information for you. For your
goddamn books. Didn't you?
Mulder is getting heated, rough with Kurtzweil. When,
unexpectedly A MAN suddenly exits the bathroom. REACTING
to this scene. Kurtzweil uses the moment to break from
Mulder. Slipping out the back door. Mulder takes a beat,
then goes after him.
Pushing out the back door into the blinding brightness.
CUT TO:
ANGLE OVER MULDER'S DESK at the far end of the living
room. The sound of keys in the door, then Mulder enters
his apartment in a hurry. Moving to the desk and going
at this pace through the drawers. Looking for... A
PICTURE ALBUM.
Which he takes now, leafing through it. Flipping the
pages, looking for:
ANGLE OVER MULDER
Finding old pictures of young Fox Mulder with his
SISTER, Samantha. With his father and mother. The
plastic-covered page is peeled back and one of these
photos is removed. It is an old family snapshot. A
picnic possibly.
Mulder stares at the picture.
INSERT PHOTO - In the b.g. of the picnic, his head
turned to camera, is a young KURTZWEIL.
Mulder studies the photo intensely, when there's a KNOCK
at his door. Mulder turning to see:
SCULLY
In his haste, Mulder had neglected to lock his door.
Scully is pushing it open. She's still in the same
clothes. She looks beat. Her eyes meeting Mulder's. A
gaze that says bad news.
MULDER
What? What's wrong?
SCULLY
Salt Lake City, Utah. Transfer
effective immediately.
Mulder is shaking his head. Not wanting to hear this.
SCULLY
I already gave Skinner my letter of
resignation.
MULDER
You can't quit, Scully.
SCULLY
I can, Mulder. I debated whether or
not to even tell you in person,
because I knew --
MULDER
We're close to something here -- we're
on the verge --
SCULLY
You're on the verge, Mulder -- please
don't do this to me --
MULDER
After what you saw last night -- after
all you've seen -- you can't just walk
away --
SCULLY
I have. I did. It's done.
MULDER
Just like that --
SCULLY
I'm contacting the state board Monday
to file medical reinstatement papers
--
MULDER
I need you on this, Scully --
SCULLY
You don't Mulder -- you've never
needed me. I've only held you back.
(beat)
I've got to go.
And with that she exits his apartment, the argument too
painful, and her ability to be persuaded too clear to
herself.
WIDE ANGLE FROM END OF HALL where we see Scully,
leaving Mulder's apartment. Moving at a hurried clip to
the elevator -- TOWARD CAMERA. As if anticipating her
own impulse to turn around and go back. As she moves
into f.g. Mulder exits his apt. door.
MULDER
You're wrong --
He hurries to catch her. As she turns on him.
SCULLY
Why was I assigned to you? To debunk
your work. To reign you in. To shut
you down.
MULDER
You saved me, Scully.
(off her look)
As different and frustrating as it's
been sometimes, your goddamn strict
rationalism and science have saved me
a thousand times; have kept me honest
and made me whole. I owe you so much,
Scully, and you owe me nothing.
(beat)
I don't want to do this without you. I
don't know if I can. If I quit now,
they win.
She is silent, moved. In spite of all her desire not to
be. She moves to Mulder, holds him. They break slightly
and she looks up at Mulder with deep respect, admiration
and... kisses him on the forehead. When...
...suddenly a physical intimacy we've never seen. A
heat and passion that can't be denied. The opportunity
for the inevitable has presented itself.
The moment of truth has arrived. Mulder is staring at
Scully as she's looking back at him. His head moves
slightly toward hers -- as one of his hands moves up to
her neck, drawing her to him. Where there is hesitation
on her part, there is also desire. When:
SCULLY
OUCH!!!
Scully pulls away from Mulder, RUBBING at her neck where
his hand had been.
MULDER
What? What happened?
SCULLY
I think... something stung me.
Scully's hand comes out with THE SQUIRMING BEE, which
she holds in her hand while Mulder moves around her,
checking her neck.
MULDER
It must...
But he doesn't finish his sentence before he has to
catch Scully from falling. Her head bobs and she has to
catch it.
MULDER
Scully...
SCULLY
Something's wrong...
(fighting for clarity)
I'm having -- lancinating pain -- my
chest. My... motor functions are being
affected. I'm...
Mulder lays her down on the floor during this. Scully
continues to speak, though her eyes are not focusing.
She is limp in Mulder's arms.
SCULLY
...my pulse feels thready and I've
got a funny taste in the back of my
throat.
MULDER
I think you're in anaphylactic shock
--
SCULLY
No -- it's --
Her voice is getting thin now, too.
MULDER
Scully --
SCULLY
I've got no allergy. Something...
this... Mulder... I think... I think
you should call an ambulance.
And Mulder is on his feet in a flash, running for:
CUT TO:
CLOSE OVER PHONE as Mulder races into the apartment,
dashing TOWARD CAMERA, picking up the receiver, dialing.
HOLDING ON THE PHONE during this action. TILTING UP
for:
MULDER
This is Special Agent Fox Mulder. I
have an emergency -- I have an agent
down --
SCULLY - HANDHELD
Picked up and one-two-three loaded on a gurney by TWO
PARAMEDICS.
1ST PARAMEDIC
Can you hear me? Can you say your
name?
Scully is trying, but the words won't come out.
1ST PARAMEDIC
She's got constriction in the throat
and larynx -- are you breathing okay?
He lays his head down to her mouth.
1ST PARAMEDIC
Passages are open. Let's get her in
the van --
NEIGHBORS are in the hall now, along with Mulder. Who is
moving beside the Paramedics as they hustle the gurney
down the hall.
1ST PARAMEDIC
Coming through people -- here we go.
Coming through --
CUT TO:
Voices fade in slowly, inaudible at first. For regular
viewers of the show, they will recognize the voices of
the Lone Gunmen.
Three nerdish paranoiacs who publish a magazine which
charts and cataloged conspiracies past and present,
among other government malfeasance. They are Langly,
Byers and Frohike.
BYERS
I think he's coming out --
LANGLY
He's coming to.
FROHIKE
Hey, Mulder...
FADE UP, as if our eyes are blinking open. We are in
Mulder's POV, and the face right above us is Frohike's.
FROHIKE
Mulder...?
Behind Frohike, looking down at Mulder, are Byers and
Langly.
REVERSE ON MULDER
Staring at the diminutive Frohike, the long-haired
Langly and the courtly Byers with dawning recognition.
MULDER
Oh god...
LANGLY
What's wrong?
MULDER
(to Byers, then Langly)
Tin Man. Scarecrow.
(to Frohike)
Toto.
Mulder sits up now, rubbing his face, feeling the
BANDAGE he's got on his head.
MULDER
What am I doing here?
BYERS
You were shot in the head. The bullet
broke the flesh on your right brow and
glanced off your temporal plate.
MULDER
(woozy)
Penetration but not perforation.
LANGLY
Three centimetres to the left and we'd
be playing the harp.
Mulder is still shaking out the cobwebs.
BYERS
They gave you a craniotomy to relieve
the pressure from a subdural hematoma.
But you've been unconscious since they
brought you in.
MULDER
When was that?
FROHIKE
Two days ago. Your guy Skinner's been
here with you around the clock.
LANGLY
We got the news and made a trip to
your apartment. Found a bug in your
phone line.
FROHIKE
And one in your hall.
Byers holds up the first small device. Frohike holds up
a vial containing A BEE. Mulder realizing:
MULDER
Scully had a violent reaction to a bee
sting --
BYERS
You called 911. Except the call was
intercepted.
MULDER
(sitting up)
They took her --
Mulder pushes the covers off. Swinging his legs to the
ground. As A.D. Skinner enters the room. Surprised to
see Mulder up.
SKINNER
Agent Mulder --
MULDER
Where's Scully?!
As he says this he loses his balance slightly, has to
hold onto one of the Gunmen. Struggling with his
faculties.
SKINNER
She's missing. We've been unable to
locate her or the vehicle they took
her in.
MULDER
Whoever they are -- this goes right
back to Dallas -- it goes right back
to the bombing --
SKINNER
I know.
(off Mulder's reaction to
this)
Agent Scully reported your suspicions
to OPR. On the basis of her report, I
sent techs over to S.A.C. Michaud's
apartment. They picked up PSTN
residues on his personal effects
consistent with the construction of
the vending machine device in Dallas.
MULDER
(reeling)
How deep does this go?
SKINNER
I don't know.
Mulder sees A MAN IN A SUIT passes by the small window
in the door, casting a furtive glance in, then moving
off. He turns his look back to Skinner.
MULDER
Are we being watched?
SKINNER
I'm not taking any chances.
Mulder nods. Pulling now at the bandage on his head.
Peeling it away and revealing the wound beneath.
MULDER
I need your clothes, Byers.
BYERS
Me?
SKINNER
What are you doing?
MULDER
I've got to find Scully.
FROHIKE
Do you know where she is?
MULDER
No. But I know someone who might have
an answer. Who better.
Mulder is undoing his hospital gown now, his white buns
gracing the screen for the first time in history. As he
ducks into the bathroom. As the men left standing in the
room all look to Byers, reluctantly removing his duds.
Off this:
CUT TO:
ANGLE OVER MAN IN A SUIT standing with his back to
Mulder's room, reading a section of a newspaper (the
rest of the paper sitting on a chair, as if the man's
possibly set up here.) As the door to Mulder's room
opens in the b.g. and Frohike appears.
Frohike keeps his eyes on the Man as Langly appears now,
followed by...Byers? We can't see clearly as the other
two block our POV and the third man out doesn't show us
his face. The threesome starts down the hall, their
footsteps drawing the attention of the Man in a Suit.
ANGLE OVER MULDER AND THE OTHER GUNMEN
As they head TOWARD CAMERA. Walking at a pace. In the
b.g. the Man in the Suit is drifting toward Mulder's
hospital room.
ANGLE ON MAN IN SUIT
Suspicious. He moves to the door, looks in the little
glass window. Seeing...Byers, the sheets pulled up to
his nose to hide his beard and mustache. Skinner
standing next to him, talking on the phone.
The Man in the Suit looking down to the end of the hall
again.
RESUME ANGLE OVER MULDER AND THE GUNMEN
As Mulder and his two flankers MOVE RIGHT TO CAMERA.
Mulder is taking a cell phone being handed to him by
Frohike. Dialing on the move.
CUT TO:
Moderately crowded as Mulder enters, stopping to catch
his breath. Moving to the back of the bar. Looking for:
THE BOOTH WHERE HE MET KURTZWEIL EARLIER
It's empty.
RESUME MULDER
Moving through the bar -- real panic in his expression.
He heads to the back.
Mulder passing the bathrooms, moving to the door where
we saw the Well-Manicured Man standing just a short bit
ago. But there is no one back here now. Mulder moves to
the back door, the one leading to the alley, pushing it
open and finding:
The Well-Manicured Man stands with HIS DRIVER closing
the trunk on the idling Town Car (which has been turned
around.) The W.M.M. turns to see:
WELL-MANICURED MAN
Mr. Mulder.
MULDER
What happened to Kurtzweil?
WELL-MANICURED MAN
He's come and gone.
The W.M.M. moves to Mulder, who doesn't trust him for a
second. Mulder is still breathing hard, sizing up this
scene.
MULDER
Where's Scully?
WELL-MANICURED MAN
I have answers for you.
MULDER
Is she alive?
WELL-MANICURED MAN
Yes.
Mulder stares at the W.M.M. - measuring him.
WELL-MANICURED MAN
I'm quite prepared to tell you
everything, though there isn't much
you haven't guessed.
MULDER
About the conspiracy?
WELL-MANICURED MAN
I think of it as an agreement. A word
your father liked to use.
MULDER
I want to know where Scully is.
The Well-Manicured Man suddenly reaches into his jacket
pocket, without warning or explanation. Mulder tensing
slightly. He removes a thin felt envelope.
WELL-MANICURED MAN
The location of Agent Scully. And the
means to save her life.
(off Mulder's look)
Please...
He gestures toward the car where the Driver stands with
the back door open. Mulder hesitates, then steps from
the doorway. Moving past the W.M.M., sliding in. The
W.M.M. gets in after him, closes the door. The car pulls
away.
CUT TO:
WE SEE MULDER in the back seat, reflected in the
rear-view mirror. Where we also see the eyes of the
DRIVER watching him. Mulder is handed the felt envelope
by the W.M.M.
MULDER
What is it?
WELL-MANICURED MAN
A weak vaccine against the virus Agent
Scully has been infected with. It must
be administered with ninety six
hours.
MULDER
(beat)
You're lying.
WELL-MANICURED MAN
No. Though I have no way to prove
otherwise. The virus is
extraterrestrial. We know very little
about it, except that it is the
original inhabitant of this planet.
MULDER
(dubious, to say the least)
A virus?
WELL-MANICURED MAN
A simple, unstoppable lifeform. What
is a virus but a colonizing force that
cannot be defeated? Living in a cave,
underground, until it mutates. And
attacks.
MULDER
This is what you've been conspiring to
conceal? A disease?
WELL-MANICURED MAN
No! For God sake you've got it all
backwards.
This outburst comes suddenly, unexpectedly.
WELL-MANICURED MAN
Aids, the ebola virus -- on the
evolutionary scale they are newborns.
This virus walked the planet long
before the dinosaurs.
MULDER
What do you mean, walked?
WELL-MANICURED MAN
Your aliens, Agent Mulder, your little
green men, first landed here millions
of years ago. Those that didn't leave
have been laying dormant underground
since the last Ice Age. In the form of
an evolved pathogen. Waiting to be
reconstituted when the alien race from
which it came returns to colonize the
planet. Using us as hosts. Against
this we have no defense. Nothing but a
weak vaccine.
(beat)
Do you see why it was kept secret? Why
even the best men -- men like your
father -- could not let the truth be
known?
The force and conviction of his delivery leave Mulder
shaken.
WELL-MANICURED MAN
Until Dallas, we believed the virus
was simply a controlling organism.
That mass infection would make us a
slave race.
MULDER
That's why you bombed the building.
The infected firemen, the boy --
WELL-MANICURED MAN
Imagine our surprise when they began
to gestate. My group has been working
cooperatively with the alien
colonists, facilitating their
programs. To give us access to the
virus. In false hope we might be able
to secretly find a cure. So that we
might save ourselves, as the last of
the species.
(beat)
Your father wisely refused to believe
this, choosing hope over selfishness.
Hope is the only future he had: his
children,
(beat, then self-revealing)
The only future any of us have.
This draws a look back in the mirror from the Driver.
MULDER
But... he sacrificed his own daughter.
My sister, Samantha.
WELL-MANICURED MAN
The only true survivors of the viral
holocaust will be those immune to it:
those vaccinated against it and
human/alien hybrids. Your father
arranged for your sister's abduction.
He allowed her to be taken to an alien
hybrid program, so that she would
survive. As a clone.
(beat)
He had different hopes for you. That
you would uncover the truth about the
Project. That you would stop it. That
you would fight the future.
Mulder sits stunned by this. As if somehow his destiny
has been validated, if not pre-ordained. Or maybe just
justified.
MULDER
Why are you telling me this?
WELL-MANICURED MAN
I thought it only fair you should
know, given how hard you've worked.
MULDER
What happened to Kurtzweil?
WELL-MANICURED MAN
As your father knew, things need to be
sacrificed to the future.
MULDER
Where is he?
WELL-MANICURED MAN
Dr. Kurtzweil is in the trunk.
Mulder stares at the W.M.M., at his cold-blooded
expression.
MULDER
Let me out. Stop the car.
WELL-MANICURED MAN
(motioning)
Driver.
Mulder reaching to this as the limo pulls to a stop.
Trying the door, but the door is locked. When he turns
back to the W.M.M. he has produced a handgun, which is
now pointing at Mulder. Laid casually across a folded
arm. Mulder reacts on seeing it.
WELL-MANICURED MAN
The men I work with will stop at
nothing to clear the way for what they
believe is their stake in the
inevitable future. I was ordered to
kill Kurtzweil. A necessary action to
protect my grandchildren's lives.
(beat)
I might just as easily kill you.
Mulder is recoiling as he says this. Then, without
hesitation in one quick move, he SHOOTS the Driver in
the head.
The blood spattering on the front windshield -- and on
Mulder who has barely had a chance to react.
WELL-MANICURED MAN
Trust no one, Mr. Mulder.
Mulder looks at The Well-Manicured Man, expecting to be
next. And for a moment, we do too. But the W.M.M. simply
opens the door and steps out of the car. Holding the
door open for Mulder who is still frozen by the actions
that went just before.
Agent Mulder sits behind the controls of the enclosed
cabin, several days growth on his face. Dressed in
thick, bundled outerwear. He maneuvers the vehicle to a
stop. Reaching for a handheld GPS monitor to check his
position. Catching his breath for a moment -- all
movement is exertion in this climate. Mulder stares hard
out the front window, the wipers beating time, but there
is nothing out there but whiteness. He wipes the fog
from a side window with his gloved hand, seeing nothing
but more whiteness. Checking the GPS device again, then
reaching for the door latch.
RESUME WIDE EXTERIOR
Agent Mulder exits the vehicle, hopping down onto the
snowscape crust. Setting out on foot with the GPS device
held before him. In this forbidding environment he might
as well be taking a space walk -- without the security
of a lifeline. Which is the impression we get as his
tiny figure trudges across the ice, increasing the
distance between himself and the snow tractor.
MOVING WITH MULDER
Up a gentle grade, the snow tractor now behind him.
Moving into tight f.g. where he stops, seeing something
now which allows him to pocket the GPS device. Dropping
instinctively to his knees, so as to avoid being seen
by:
MULDER'S POV
In the distance is an ICE STATION. A row of
interconnecting WHITE DOME TENTS, whose design is now
familiar to us. There are what look like snow tractors
and other snow vehicles parked alongside the
structures.
RESUME MULDER
Pulling a compact pair of binoculars from one of his
deep jacket pockets. Training them on:
THE ICE STATION - BINO MATTE
PANNING across the domes and vehicles, where there is no
sign of personnel -- until MULDER PANS off the building,
finding in his field glasses AN APPROACHING SNOW
TRACTOR. Moving across the landscape toward the ice
station. When it pulls to a stop, A MAN exits out of one
of the domes: THE CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN. Moving to the
vehicle and getting in.
The vehicle reverses now, transporting the CSM back
away from the ice station.
CLOSE ON MULDER
Taking the field glasses away from his eyes. The
excitement he feels expressed now in his breathing,
which has become harder and shallower. Mulder rises,
beginning to move the still great distance between
himself and the ice station.
CUT TO:
WIDE ON SCREEN
Mulder moving slowly across the white horizon toward the
domed tents.
LOW ANGLE ON MULDER'S FEET
Moving cautiously, and with effort on the snowscape
crust. CAMERA RISING up to Mulder's face, determined and
watchful.
FOLLOWING MULDER
The ice station still several hundred yards in the
distance, when MULDER SUDDENLY FALLS OUT OF FRAME,
disappearing into a hole in the snowscape crust that
just moments earlier had been stable footing.
HARD CUT TO:
Where Mulder's body falls through a ceiling of snowscape
crust, landing on his back with a THUD on a hard
surface. It takes him a moment to catch his breath,
somewhat reminiscent of Stevie at the beginning of the
picture. Wincing through the pain. Until he turns over,
regaining his wits, and his bearings.
NEW ANGLE
Mulder has fallen on a hard, narrow metallic structure.
Its dull black color a stark contrast to the white ice
it's encased in. The bubble has been created by air
coming out of vents in the structure, carving out
corresponding patterns in the ceiling; softening the ice
and snow above.
CLOSER ON MULDER
rising to his knees, the AIR from one of these vents
blowing onto his face. Pulling off the hood of his
jacket, looking deep into the vent which is open,
ungrated.
And big enough for a man to crawl into. Which, after
considering the hole he's fallen through high above him,
is really Mulder's only choice.
CUT TO:
Mulder pulls himself forward through the ribbed corridor
duct with his elbows, moving lizard-like into the
constricted darkness.
CUT TO:
Above a frozen ice lith, Mulder's head appears,
squeezing his shoulders and body out of a venting. With
effort, Mulder slides out of the small space, using some
architecture above as a handhold. Pulling his legs free
and dropping onto the floor.
MULDER'S POV
It is dark in here, the features of the corridor
ill-defined.
RESUME MULDER - WIDER
Mulder pulls a flashlight from a pocket in his parka,
snicks it on. Its beam reflecting off tall frozen liths
of ice regularly spaced on both sides of the corridor.
NEW ANGLE ON MULDER
Training the light down the corridor, which curves away
in both directions. Then pointing it at something right
in front of his nose: something that gives him a start.
Reaching up with his hand to brush away frost from the
lith. Finding A MAN FROZEN IN ICE. Naked, his eyes
staring into some long-forgotten distance. His hair is
dark, his flat features familiar to us. He is the
prehistoric hunter from the opening scenes of the movie.
His flesh has the opaque, see-through quality that we've
seen before. Inside of which, frozen along with the man,
is an EMBRYONIC CREATURE.
REVERSE ON MULDER
Reacting to this sight, then moving off down the
corridor, his pace quickened.
CUT TO:
MULDER comes to the end of the dim ice corridor where
soft light is penetrating through several low, arched
openings.
Mulder has to drop down to his knees to see into the
openings.
ANGLE FROM OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE BALCONY PASSAGEWAY
Where Mulder is seen looking TOWARD CAMERA. The Balcony
passageway is short. Mulder drops to his stomach again,
pulling himself through, toward us. When he reaches the
opposite end, Mulder pokes his head out, looking up in
wonder at:
A STADIUM-SIZED DOME -- (CGI SET EXTENSION)
Imagine a domed sports arena -- this is the scope and
scale of the space that Mulder has penetrated. We see
him as only a small speck on a balcony midway between
floor and ceiling. Pulling himself out of the balcony
passageway, which is like countless other passageways.
Which are actually ventilation ports.
ANGLE OVER MULDER
Pulling himself to his feet. Beholding the space before
him. Looking down to the center floor where a large
central theater gives off a light different from
elsewhere in the dome. An icy, bright glow. Leading down
to the central theater far below are several LARGE
TUBULAR SPOKES. (One of which leads up right next to
Mulder's position.)
ANGLE ON MULDER
Reacting to this. Then something captures his
attention.
MULDER'S POV
There on the floor, far down below, is THE BUBBLE LITTER
Scully was transported in. (NOTE* Scully's clothes are
still in the bubble litter.) Standing out as a rather
human artifact against the otherwise dull gray bulwarks
and architecture surrounding it.
MULDER
looks beside him where the joint that connects two
sections of one of the long tube spokes is designed with
an allowance -- a separation that might allow a man to
slip through the joint into the tube. Which is what
Mulder does here.
CUT TO:
WIDE ANGLE FROM INSIDE TUBE TERMINUS
Mulder squeezing through into the tube, looking down
past what looks like a chair lift-like track, on which
the chairs are actually empty cryopod mechanisms; the
same structures Mulder saw in the ribbed corridor in
which bodies were encased in ice. Except these cryopods
are empty.
Mulder begins to creep down TOWARD CAMERA, picking his
way around the empty cryopods.
REVERSE ANGLE ON MULDER
Creeping away from us. Heading toward:
Where Mulder pops out at the lower tube terminus. Which
leads into this bulwarked corridor at the base of the
large stadium structure. Where:
REVERSE ON THIS CORRIDOR
Where Mulder is walking past frozen CRYOPODS hanging on
a track. Each icy pod containing a HUMAN BODY frozen
within. Partially visible behind clear blue ice. But
these are modern men, and women. Their expressions a
confused horror, as if they have been somehow frozen
alive. They are slowly tracking.
Walking along the slowly moving carousel of frozen
humanity. Stopping, turning, almost as if having
sensed:
NEW ANGLE OVER OPPOSITE CRYOPOD
PUSHING IN ON MULDER'S FACE. Recording the horror and
fear he's experiencing, on seeing:
CAMERA RISING UP A FROSTY WALL OF BLUE ICE
Where a woman's body is encased, its naked features
hidden behind the opacity of the newly frozen blue
crust. But whose face is unmistakable as that of Agent
Scully's. Frozen in a similar expression of far-away
horror, her eyes cast slightly heavenward.
MULDER
hurries to get his jacket unzipped. Removing the FELT
ENVELOPE, removing the syringe body, the needle and the
AMPULE.
Hastily putting the syringe together, getting the needle
poked into the soft rubber cap of the ampule. Bleeding
the syringe now, the substance inside squirting out of
the end of the needle onto the floor of the ship.
And the moment it does, the whole floor SIZZLES like
water being dropped onto a hot skillet. Spreading out
from Mulder in every direction. A VIOLENT CHEMICAL
REACTION, as predicted by the man who gave him this
substance. A moment later the entire structure Mulder is
in SHUNTS. Shuddering violently and setting up a low-end
RUMBLE. Causing Mulder to accidentally drop the
syringe.
LOW CLOSE ANGLE
on the floor, where the syringe hits and bounces, but
does not break or leak. Mulder scrambling into frame to
re-collect it. Seeing the floor where the liquid from
the syringe hit -- where it has been ETCHED AWAY by the
substance.
Back on his feet, SMASHING now at the crust of brittle
blue-ice that encases Scully. BASHING, SMASHING and then
finally breaking through the hard outer later, its inner
slushy contents spilling out of the puncture that
exposes Scully's face and shoulder. Watery aqua-tinted
liquid drains from her mouth and nose. But Scully is not
conscious, and there is no indication she is even alive,
her face frozen in a blank, almost beatific expression.
OVER MULDER TO SCULLY
As he plunges the needle into Scully's arm at the front
of her shoulder. To which there is an immediate reaction
-- as if given a shot of adrenalin. Her eyes blinking
away the cold moisture.
MULDER
Scully --
Scully's lips move goldfish-like as she tries to suck in
air, an almost fearful expression overcoming her like a
swimmer who's been held under too long. But no words are
coming out yet.
MULDER
Breathe -- can you breathe?!
Scully is straining to do just that -- when liquid
suddenly SPEWS from Scully's mouth. And she begins to
cough and gag -- taking big gulps of air as her eyes
focus on Mulder as if on a phantom, or a miracle.
Finally faint words ushering forth, whispering breaths
that Mulder cannot discern.
MULDER
What?
CLOSE ON MULDER AND SCULLY
As he leans into her, putting his ear up to her mouth.
As the softest sound comes out in Scully's frosty
breath.
SCULLY
Cold...
MULDER
Hang on. I'm going to get you out of
here.
As she continues to suck air.
CUT TO:
Filling with misty condensation, too. The small beams of
light that lighted Mulder's way earlier are now small
shafts piercing the gathering interior cloud.
Illuminating:
THE PREHISTORIC MAN
Frozen in his icy pod, the hard semi-translucent surface
of which is now etched with small streams of water
running to the floor. Everything is melting and in
motion.
Including the CREATURE which is vaguely visible inside
the frozen man. It TURNS slightly inside the body, like
an animal in utero. Its eyes now looking at us,
blinking. As it presses against its own fleshy
container, the body of its human host.
CUT BACK TO:
It, too, is filling with misty condensation.
VARIOUS SHOTS
Of the ice encasing the human forms sweating and
melting.
CAMERA ADJUSTING UP TO REVEAL Mulder pulling Scully
along in a fireman's carry. She is dressed now in
Mulder's snow parka and the outer nylon pants he was
wearing. Scully's legs are weak beneath her. Her body
limp, but not lifeless. Mulder laboring to get her up
the INTERIOR of the steep curving cylinder spoke, as the
air fills with mist.
NEW ANGLE ON MULDER AND SCULLY - LOOKING DOWN THE TUBE
Moving toward along the now-halted cryopod carrier
hanging from the transport track. Mulder struggling
against his own fading energy, pulling Scully up
toward:
ANGLE ON BALCONY/CATWALK
Mulder pushing Scully up, though she seems to have at
least some limited ability to do this on her own. The
DEEP, LOW RUMBLE we heard in the open frames of the
movie reaching full volume now. The whole environment
vibrating as Mulder boosts Scully up on the catwalk.
Climbing up over the prostrate body. Picking her up from
the floor, pulling her back into the fireman's carry.
Where the bodies are all beginning to melt.
VARIOUS SHOTS of rivulets of water forming on the
icy liths that encase the bodies. The water from them
seeping onto the circular central floor. The condensing
mist thick and swirling.
CLOSE ON PODS
Where the body it houses seems to move. Though AS CAMERA
PUSHES IN we see that it is the creature inside this
body moving, as if the heat and the defrosting are
bringing the embryos to life.
CORRIDOR
Scully's head pokes through now, as she's pushed through
the opening that Mulder used earlier to get into the
vaulted arena. Pushed in fits and starts until she's all
the way through. Mulder now straining and squeezing to
do the same on his own.
The corridor is filled with heavy condensed mist now as
Mulder finally slips out of the low passageway, trying
to get his bearing now as he huddles low over Scully.
Turning his attention to her as she COUGHS HOARSELY --
in some kind of acute spasm of pain -- but alive.
MULDER
We've got to keep moving.
SCULLY
(weakly)
Where are we?
MULDER
You got me. But I think I know what
they did with Jimmy Hoffa.
Scully is struggling now as Mulder tries to pull her to
her feet again. In real physical pain.
SCULLY
I can't...
Scully can't finish speaking, her voice becoming a
hoarse cough.
SCULLY
(barely a whisper)
I can't go any farther.
MULDER
Yes you can. You're going to make it,
Scully.
Mulder hauling Scully up off the floor AWAY FROM CAMERA
now.
NEW ANGLE ON RIBBED CORRIDOR
CAMERA MOVING THROUGH SPACE in the empty corridor,
moving at a speed equal to Mulder and Scully's as they
round the semi-circular ribbed corridor to meet us.
Coming out of the mist, Scully back in the fireman's
carry. Approaching the place where Mulder slipped down
into the corridor.
Mulder stopping and seeing:
THE BODY IN THE MELTING ICE LITH
As it too moves, the embryonic creature inside it
turning slightly, as if coming awake.
REVERSE ON MULDER
Reacting to this -- and then to Scully who suddenly
starts GASPING FOR BREATH.
Falling now from Mulder's grasps as her legs buckle and
she goes down.
LOW ANGLE ON SCULLY
Her face is going red, straining for air. Her eyes
rolling, seeking relief. As Mulder drops down beside
her.
MULDER
Shit --
But she is unable to answer. Mulder hastening to unzip
her/his jacket. To get to her neck and find a pulse.
MULDER
Scully --
Mulder cannot find a pulse. Scully straining harder now
as Mulder reaches his fingers into her mouth, clearing
her passageway. Moving on top of her now, and pumping
forcefully on her chest -- trying to get air into her.
One - two - three.
And putting his mouth down to hers (FINALLY!), breathing
his life into her. Pulling away from her to see that he
is unsuccessful at this -- that Scully is continuing to
strain. Pumping her chest again --
MULDER
You're not dying on me now -- godammit
godammit godammit --
As he pumps her chest. Placing his mouth over hers again
and BREATH - BREATH -- BREATH.
Lifting his mouth from hers, feeling for a pulse again,
putting his eat down to her mouth, praying he'll feel
the breeze of a breath. Nothing. While:
ANGLE OVER HIM TO THE CREATURE IN THE ICY POD
As it moves again, MORE VIOLENTLY NOW. As the ice around
it continues to melt and fissure.
RESUME MULDER
His hands going to a pocket on the inside of the jacket
Scully is wearing -- his jacket -- finding again the
syringe that he used on Scully. It is still partially
full of vaccine. Mulder finding this, getting ready to
use it when --
-- Scully's body suddenly comes back to life beneath
him. Labored breaths which turn into a coughing spasm.
Mulder breaths relievedly for a moment, watching Scully
coughing, coming back to life. Her eyes trying to focus
on him, finding him. Seeing his labored relief. The
panic melting away.
SCULLY
(weakly, pained whisper)
Mulder...
She wants to tell him something. He leans down next to
her.
SCULLY
(continued weak)
Had you big time.
Mulder has but a moment to savor this weary victory
though when he REACTS to something, that causes him to
WHIP HIS HEAD AROUND.
MULDER'S POV DOWN RIBBED CORRIDOR
Through the condensed mist he can see CREATURES
BEGINNING TO HATCH, sprouting from the melted
ice-encased bodies they have gestated in. Their THREE
FINGERED HANDS beating at the soft ice. Their powerful
feet kicking at it, too.
RESUME MULDER
Looking the other way down the corridor, seeing --
MORE CREATURES
The slushy material that makes up the inner core
spilling out with them as the creatures KICK out of
their tombs.
RESUME MULDER
Lifting Scully up with all his strength he has left in
him. He's got to get her overhead now, back up the
venting that he slipped down from. She is weak and of
little help.
Mulder gets her propped up on his strength so that he
can use the power of his legs to boost her toward the
opening. Which puts him face to face with THE EMBRYONIC
CREATURE. Its eye looking directly at him, blinking,
before it goes into another FITFUL SPASM inside its host
body.
ANGLE DOWN FROM VENT
Where Scully is boosted up TOWARD CAMERA. Her hands
reaching feebly for something to grab onto. Finding a
handhold.
MULDER
Keep breathing, Scully.
She utters something guttural, unintelligible as the
next thrust up from Mulder gets her head and shoulders
into the opening of the vent.
RESUME MULDER
Beneath her, pushing with all his might. His hands under
her shoes now, forcing her up into the vent like a
rolled carpet into the rafters.
RESUME SCULLY
Struggling with her arms and elbows, barely conscious,
but somehow able to manage herself forward.
RESUME MULDER
Pushing Scully up the last little way. Then reaching up
to find a handhold for himself. Grabbing hold and
lifting himself as one of his feet kicks at the ice --
where the creature he was just face to face with BURSTS
from its icy pod. One hand, then the other shooting out
of the ice where they have broken through the host.
Ripping open the front of the body, including the man's
face. Making a slimy, gaping tear in what was formerly
flesh.
Its hands grabbing at Mulder as he thrashes to free
himself from it getting a grip.
As Mulder struggles to pull himself up, fighting off the
creature which he cannot see beneath him.
RESUME CREATURE
As it emerges from the ice, still grasping and TEARING
at Mulder's legs with its claws. But as it BURSTS
COMPLETELY from its place, Mulder is able to pull
himself up and into the vent in one athletic movement.
ANGLE FROM INSIDE THE VENT - SCULLY
lies motionless in the ducting, her body forced forward
by Mulder's in this last surging move.
TIGHT ANGLE ON MULDER
Drawing his legs up quickly inside. Not wasting a moment
shoving Scully's butt forward in front of him.
MULDER
Scully -- you breathing?
RESUME SCULLY
Letting out another low, guttural sound -- which STRAINS
out of her with each push forward.
CUT TO:
The large room filled with the evidence and debris from
the bombing. It is dark. Until A FLASHLIGHT BEAM pricks
the blackness, moving toward us into f.g. Carried by the
man we now recognize as The Man Who Shot Mulder. He
moves with directness, purpose. Finding what he's
looking for amid the cataloged material, he finds on a
work bench. Next to the microscope Scully had used. It
is the BONE FRAGMENTS, held in an evidence container.
He pockets them and exits as quiet and directly as he
entered.
DISSOLVE TO:
Jana Cassidy sits at the head of the desk, just as when
we first met her.
She is flanked by the other members of the review board,
including A.D. Skinner who sits at the end of the
table.
Cassidy flips through a file she's referred to before
she continues. Looking up with consternation as she
resumes.
CASSIDY
... my official report is incomplete
pending these new facts I'm being
asked to reconcile. Agent Scully...
AGENT SCULLY
Sitting where she last sat, at the small table. The seat
next to her conspicuously empty. Her face bears the
signs of slight frostbite, somewhat healed. Her
expression is even, her attitude composed, but her eyes
are filled of dark, restrained defiance.
CASSIDY
...while there is direct evidence now
that a federal agent may have been
involved in the bombing... the other
events you've laid down here seem too
incredible on their own, and quite
frankly implausible in their
connection.
PANNING THE OTHER BOARD MEMBERS - curious, bemused like
Cassidy. Skinner shifts uncomfortably.
SCULLY
What is it you find incredible?
CASSIDY
Well...where would you like me to
start? Antarctica is a long way from
Dallas, Agent Scully. I can't very
well submit a report to the Attorney
General that alleges the links you've
made here. Bees and corn crops do not
quite fall under the rubric of
domestic terrorism.
SCULLY
No, they don't.
CASSIDY
Most of what I find in here is lacking
a coherent picture of an organization
with an attributable motive. I realize
you're very lucky to be alive Agent
Scully. The ordeal you've endured has
clearly affected you -- though the
holes in your account leave this panel
with little choice but to delete these
references from our final report to
the Justice Department. Until which
time hard evidence becomes available
that would give us cause to pursue
such an investigation.
Scully has her hand in her coat pocket now. Moving
around the table and approaching Cassidy. Removing
something which she puts on the desk in front of her. A
small vial.
SCULLY
I don't believe the FBI currently has
an investigation unit qualified to
pursue the evidence in hand.
Cassidy picks up the vial, studying the contents of this
vial: the dead bee that stung Scully. Studying it as
Scully turns and moves to the door, without permission,
no further adieu.
ANGLE TO INCLUDE A.D. SKINNER
Watching Scully exit.
CASSIDY (O.S.)
Mr. Skinner....?
CAMERA PIVOTING TO INCLUDE CASSIDY. Looking at him.
CASSIDY
Please ask Agent Scully to come back
to this hearing. We're not quite
finished.
As Skinner rises, unsure of the intent behind this
directive, we:
DISSOLVE TO:
