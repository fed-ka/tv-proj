                                DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS 
 

                                        "Requiem"

                                        ACT ONE






FADE IN:

EXT. PLAIN OF DREAMS - ESTABLISHING

A surreal, fog shrouded plain, stark and brooding.  In b.g., dimly 
glimpsed through the mists, are monoliths of basalt that suggest 
huge Stonehenge like dolmens and menhirs.  We cannot tell if it is 
day or night -- the gray fog itself seems luminous.  SFX: FARAWAY 
WINDS.

                            DUNGEON MASTER (O.S.) 
                Venger?

ANOTHER ANGLE

DUNGEON MASTER stands in the midst of the desolation, looking about 
him.  He is not afraid; on the other hand, he doesn't look overjoyed 
at being here.

                            VENGER (O.S.) 
                I am here, old man.

Dungeon Master turns in time to see a MAGIC BOLT SPLIT a monolith. 
It CRASHES to either side, revealing VENGER amidst the swirling 
fog.  He looks down at Dungeon Master.

                            VENGER (CONT'D) 
                Dungeon Master, you are a fool.

FAVORING DUNGEON MASTER

He raises a polite eyebrow, but does not reply.

                            VENGER (CONT'D) 
                Your pupils are doomed to failure. 
                They are brave only because they know 
                you stand behind them.

                            DUNGEON MASTER 
                Not so.  They can triumph over anything 
                in the Realm -- as you well know.  They 
                will not fail.

CLOSE ON VENGER



1 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html


He scowls, then smiles craftily, as if an idea has just occurred to 
him.

                            VENGER 
                Well, then -- perhaps you would not be 
                adverse to a test of their courage?

ON DUNGEON MASTER

He looks wary.

                            VENGER (O.S. CONT'D) 
                We shall see how brave they are when 
                you turn away from them.  If they 
                succeed, they will find the Key.

                            DUNGEON MASTER 
                And if they fail -- what do they lose?

ON VENGER

He raises a fist CRACKLING with Kirbyesque power.

                            VENGER 
                Everything.  Their weapons -- and 
                their lives.

CLOSE ON DUNGEON MASTER

He bows his head and folds his hands together.

                            DUNGEON MASTER 
                So be it.

                                                    SHOCK CUT TO:

EXT. MOORS - DAY

As the seven heads of an enormous HYDRA lash straight at us! SFX: 
HISSING.  PULL BACK to include BOBBY, HANK, ERIC, DIANA, SHEILA, 
UNI and PRESTO, all running for their lives across a moody expanse 
of swampy moors with the hydra in hot pursuit.

                            KIDS 
                    (ad lib) 
                Look out!  Run!  Here it comes! 
                (Etc.)

                            HYDRA 
                    (roars)

REVERSE ANGLE - OTS HYDRA

Lumbering forward, big enough to CRUSH small trees under its feet, 
its heads SNAPPING and HISSING at our guys.

                            HYDRA 
                    (hisses)

                            ERIC 


2 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html


                Do something, Hank!  You're the 
                leader!

ON HANK - RUNNING

He stops and fires an energy arrow up O.S.

ON HYDRA

The energy arrow streaks INTO SHOT and wraps about the hydra's 
necks, pinning them together for an instant.  But the hydra BREAKS 
the glowing bonds and keeps coming.

                            HANK (O.S.) 
                It's too strong!

ON ERIC - RUNNING

One of the heads swoops down, grabs Eric by the cape and lifts him 
up O.S.

                            ERIC 
            Haaaallp!

ON BOBBY

He swings his club at a dead tree, KNOCKING it loose from its 
roots.  The tree begins to topple.

                            BOBBY 
            Timberrr!

ON HYDRA

Still holding Eric with one of its beaks.  The tree falls INTO 
SHOT and the head dodges, releasing Eric as it does so.  Eric 
falls O.S.

                            HYDRA 
                    (hisses)

ON GROUND

Eric sprawls in the mud.

                            ERIC 
                    (impact grunt)

He rolls over and scrambles out of the way of another striking head, 
just in time.

                            ERIC 
                This thing's got more heads than 
                Tiamat!

ON DIANA - RUNNING

She dodges one head and leaps over another.

                            DIANA 


3 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html


                There's no place to hide!  It's 
                gonna get us, sooner or later!

ON PRESTO, SHEILA AND UNI

Cornered against a small spur of rock by two SNAPPING, HISSING heads, 
Presto has no room to use his hat.

                            HYDRA 
                    (hisses)

                            PRESTO 
                It's got us cornered!

                            UNI 
                    (frightened whinny)

ON BOBBY

He raises his club over his head.

                            BOBBY 
                Hang on, Sis!  I'm coming!

A head swoops down INTO SHOT and seizes Bobby's club, lifting him 
from the ground.  He dangles helplessly.

                            BOBBY 
             Whooah!

ON ERIC

Scrabbling across the marshy ground on his hands and knees.  There's nothing funny about
this -- he's crawling for his life.  Then he 
looks up O.S., and grins in sudden relief.

                            ERIC 
                All right!  Everything's gonna be 
                okay now!

He points O.S.

ON HANK AND DIANA

Backing up warily before another SNAPPING head, Diana holding it off 
with her staff.  Hank has an arrow nocked.  They risk a look up 
O.S., and then grin in relief.

                            HANK 
               Dungeon Master!

THEIR POV - DUNGEON MASTER

Standing on an overhang of rock, looking down on the kids, who are arrayed 
in a loose semicircle with the hydra in the middle, its heads   weaving on long, snaky
necks.

                            KIDS 
                   (ad lib) 
                Dungeon Master, help!  Get us out 


4 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html


                of this!  Take care of this thing, 
                willya?  (Etc.)

ON DUNGEON MASTER

He is looking down O.S. at them with a grim expression on his face.

                            DUNGEON MASTER 
                You got into this by yourselves, my 
                young friends --

CLOSE ON HIM

His expression is more than grim now -- it's stern, unforgiving.

                            DUNGEON MASTER (CONT'D) 
                -- Now get out of it by yourselves!

He turns his back and steps down off the rock, disappearing from 
view.

CLOSE ON ERIC

He stares up O.S. in disbelief.

                            ERIC 
                    (despairing disbelief) 
             Huh?!

He reacts in fear to an O.S. ROAR.

HIS POV - HYDRA HEAD

Lunging straight for us!

                            HYDRA 
                    (roars)

FAVOR ERIC

Hank dives THROUGH SHOT, knocking Eric out of the way as the beak 
SNAPS on empty air.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Hank pulls Eric to his feet.  Eric has a look of sick betrayal on 
his face.

                            ERIC 
                I don't believe it!  He deserted 
                us!

ON HANK

Another O.S. ROAR snaps him around.

                            HYDRA (O.S.) 
                    (roars)

                            HANK 


5 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html


                We'll worry about that later -- if 
                there is a later!

He FIRES three energy arrows O.S. in quick succession.

ON PRESTO, SHEILA AND UNI

Still trapped by the hydra's heads.  An arrow ENTERS SHOT and 
STRIKES the rock wall to one side of them, SPLITTING a fissure 
down the middle of it.  They scramble through it.

                            UNI 
                    (squeal of fear)

ON BOBBY

Still dangling from one of the hydra's beaks.  The second arrow 
STRIKES the club, knocking it free of the beak's grasp.  Bobby 
lands and runs O.S.

                            BOBBY 
                    (lands, runs)

ON DIANA

Still fending off another head with her staff.

                            HYDRA 
                    (roars, hisses)

                            DIANA 
                    (effort)

The third arrow steaks INTO SHOT and EXPLODES like a flare before 
the hydra's eyes, causing it to jerk back.

                            HYDRA 
                    (surprised hiss)

Diana leaps over a low spur of rock and runs O.S.

ON RIDS - DOWNSHOT

They regroup, weapons at the ready, as the hydra lurches menacingly 
toward them again.  Uni shrinks back against Bobby.

                            HYDRA 
                    (menacing hiss)

                            SHEILA 
                It just keeps coming!  What're we 
                gonna do?

ON HANK

He looks about desperately, then spots something O.S.

                            HANK 
                This way!  Move it!



6 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html


He runs O.S.

WIDE ANGLE - MARSH

The kids run THROUGH SHOT, tripping on roots and patches of mud, 
SPLASHING through noxious pools, getting their clothes caught on 
bushes.  Their faces are full of fear.  Uni gallops alongside them. 
The hydra is right on their heels as they run for their lives.

                            HYDRA 
                    (roars, hisses)

ON HANK - RUNNING

His eyes fixed on something ahead O.S.  From behind one of the 
heads GAINS INTO SHOT, almost within reach of him.

                            HANK 
                    (runs)

PAN AHEAD TO INCLUDE a nasty looking bog -- a pool of green, slimy 
water that looks like it could kill a bubonic plague bacillus.

HANK'S POV - BOG

PUSH IN on it, HANDHELD TRUCK, as if we were running toward it.

                            HANK (O.S.) 
                    (effort) 
                Get ready --

OVERHEAD SHOT - WIDE

The kids and Uni reach the edge of the bog.

                            HANK (CONT'D) 
             Now!  Scatter!

They break off to either side, running along the edge of the bog as 
the hydra's momentum carries it ahead into the morass.

                            HYDRA 
                    (hissing)

ON HYDRA

It blunders in the middle of the bog with a tremendous SPLASH!  Mud 
and slime fly everywhere.  The hydra sinks in the morass, floundering helplessly, its
heads STRIKING and SNAPPING futilely as it ROARS and 
HISSES angrily.

                            HYDRA 
                    (angry roars, hisses)

ANGLE INCLUDES KIDS

They regroup on the edge of the bog, out of the hydra's reach. 
They're exhausted, mud spattered, breathing heavily.  Presto slumps 
to his knees.  Bobby huddles in Sheila's cloak.  Diana leans wearily 
on her staff.  Uni sprawls in the mud.  Hank braces himself, hands

on knees.

                            HANK 
                    (breathing hard) 
                We did it.  We're still alive.

ON ERIC

He looks grim.

                            ERIC 
                Yeah -- no thanks to Dungeon Master.

                                                        WIPE TO:

EXT. SALT FLATS - CROSSROADS - EVENING

The two suns are low in the sky, shading the salt flats red.  The 
kids, still looking much the worse for wear, are at the junction 
of two roads through the wasteland, neither of which look 
particularly appealing, though the east fork appears the better 
traveled.

CLOSER

A signpost of weathered gray wood is mounted at the crossroads. 
One of the signs has fallen; the other hangs from a single rusty 
nail, pointing at the sky.  Presto looks at it.

                            PRESTO 
                According to this, the Flame 
                Mountains are -- that way.

He points straight up, mimicking the sign.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Bobby picks up the other sign, rubs some rime from it.

                            BOBBY 
                    (reads) 
                "This way to the Sea of Sorrow."

WIDE ANGLE

Sheila looks at the two roads.

                            SHEILA 
                Great.  Which road leads where?

ON ERIC

He looks very down.

                            ERIC 
                Who cares?  It doesn't matter. 
                    (beat) 
                I can't believe he would just abandon 
                us like that.



8 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html


He starts to trudge down the eastern fork.

FAVORING HANK

He realizes it's up to him to make a decision.  He looks from one 
road to the other, then points to the western fork.

                            HANK 
                We go west, Eric.

Eric just looks at him. He makes no move to return.

                            ERIC 
                Why?

                            HANK 
                It's downhill.  We're more likely 
                to find water.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Eric returns to the crossroads, looking at Hank.  He's frowning 
slightly.  The other kids watch uneasily; they sense tension.

                            ERIC 
                The other way's a better road -- 
                might lead to a town.

Hank is somewhat nettled, but trying to keep his cool.

                            HANK 
                I'm the leader, Eric.  You said so 
                before -- remember?

TWO SHOT - HANK AND ERIC

Eric steps up to Hank, locking gazes with him.

                            ERIC 
                I was under a lot of pressure then. 
                Maybe I see things clearer now. 
                    (beat) 
                Maybe it's time we had a little 
                election.  Whattaya say, Presto?

REFIELD to include the others as Eric turns to Presto for support. 
Presto looks at the others nervously.

                            PRESTO 
                Uh -- well, the eastern road  does 
                look better ...

WIDE ANGLE

Bobby steps over to Hank, as does Uni. Diana is already by Hank's 
side.

                            BOBBY 
                Yeah?  Well, I think the  west road 
                looks better.


9 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html


Uni looks at Eric disdainfully.

                            UNI 
                    (horse lips)

ANOTHER ANGLE - FAVOR SHEILA

Sheila looks uncertain; as always, she tries to mediate.

                            SHEILA 
                Now wait a minute, Bobby --

                            BOBBY 
                    (interrupting) 
                Keep out of this, Sis!

Sheila, stung, takes a step backwards, which puts her closer to 
Eric.  A full-blown ARGUMENT erupts, the kids SHOUTING and pointing 
fingers at each other accusingly.  Hank is the only one who doesn't 
take part in it; he looks from one side to the other in shocked 
disbelief.

                            KIDS 
                    (ad lib) 
                You don't know what you're 
                talking about!  Aw, dry up! 
                You're always throwing your 
                weight around!  (Etc.)

FAVORING HANK

He steps between the two factions and raises both hands.

                            HANK 
                    (shouts) 
                Hold it, hold it!

The others stop and look at him.

                            HANK (CONT'D) 
                C'mon, we all know what this is 
                really about.  We're not mad at 
                each other -- we're mad at Dungeon 
                Master.

The others know he's right; they look embarrassed, avoiding each 
other's gaze.

CLOSE ON HANK

He makes a helpless gesture.

                            HANK (CONT'D) 
                I don't know what to tell you -- 
                except that it's getting dark, and 
                we'd better find a place to camp. 
                     (beat; to Eric) 
                You want the point, Eric?  You got 
                it.  Lead the way.

FAVOR ERIC

He looks somewhat resentfully at Hank, then turns and takes the 
eastern road O.S.  The others follow him.  Hank watches them go. 
Bobby and Uni are the last; Bobby turns and looks back at Hank. 
Hank follows, stone faced.

                                                        WIPE TO:

EXT. SEA OF SORROWS - NIGHT - CLOSE ON DRIFTWOOD

A pile of weathered wood on the sand.  An energy arrow from O.S. 
STRIKES it, turning it into the flames of a campfire.  PULL BACK 
to show the kids and Uni sitting on stones and logs around the 
fire.  Hank slings his bow and sits down with them.  In b.g. we 
can see the moons' reflections shimmering on the surface of the 
sea. SFX: BREAKERS.

                            DIANA 
                Maybe it wasn't really Dungeon 
                Master ...

FAVOR ERIC

He pokes at the flames with a stick.  SPARKS scatter.

                            ERIC 
                It was him.  D'you think  I wouldn't 
                know him? 
                    (beat; bitterly) 
                This whole Realm is a dungeon, y'know 
                that?  And we're all prisoners.  We 
                thought Dungeon Master was our friend, 
                but it turns out he's just another 
                guard.

FAVOR SHEILA

She huddles closer to the fire, shivering more from fear than 
cold.

                            SHEILA 
                What're we gonna do now?  If Dungeon 
                Master's abandoned us, who's gonna 
                help us?

                            VENGER (O.S.) 
                I will help you.

WIDE ANGLE - ALL

They know that voice.  In an instant all are on their feet, weapons 
ready, staring into the darkness that surrounds the fire.

DRAMATIC ANGLE - VENGER

He steps out of the darkness into the flickering light of the fire. 
PULL BACK to include the others.  Uni hides behind Bobby.  Venger 
holds out his hands in a gesture of peace.



11 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html


                            VENGER 
                Be at ease, my young enemies. 
                I shall not harm you.

ON HANK

Watching suspiciously from behind a nocked energy arrow.

                            HANK 
                Move very slowly, Venger.

ON VENGER

One corner of his mouth lifts slightly at Hank's warning.  He 
looks at the kids.

                            VENGER 
                So Dungeon Master has finally 
                shown his true colors.  Have you 
                never wondered why his advice 
                always led you into battle, and 
                never back to your world?

ANGLE INCLUDES KIDS

Eric, Sheila, and Presto look somewhat uncertain.  Bobby, Diana  and Hank still hold
their weapons at the ready.  The BREAKERS counterpoint the 
uneasy silence.

                            VENGER (CONT'D) 
                It has been convenient for you to 
                see Dungeon Master as good, and me 
                as evil.  But things are not that 
                simple.

ON VENGER AND CAMPFIRE

Venger stares broodingly into its flames.

                            VENGER (CONT'D) 
                I have granted you your lives before. 
                Aid me now, and I shall grant you your 
                dearest wish -- I will send you back 
                to your own world.

CLOSER

He makes a gesture at the flames.  They BLAZE UP, forming a 
miniature portal in which can be seen the amusement park.

ON ERIC, SHEILA, PRESTO

They stare longingly at the flickering image.

                            VENGER (O.S. CONT'D) 
                Far to the south lies Realm's Edge. 
                There you will find a cenotaph -- an 
                empty tomb.  Within it is a key, which 
                you must cast into the Abyss.



12 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html


WIDE ANGLE - ALL

Venger makes another gesture and the image vanishes in sync with a 
particularly loud CRASH OF SURF.

                            VENGER (CONT'D) 
                Do this, and you will go home.  You 
                have my word.

The flames BLAZE UP again, higher than ever.  When they die down, 
Venger has vanished.

ON KIDS

They look at each other, speechless.  Suddenly Hank fires the 
nocked arrow O.S. skyward in a gesture of defiance.  It EXPLODES 
above them like a flare, providing eerie light.

                            HANK 
                Forget it, Venger!  No way we're 
                working for you!

CLOSER

Eric steps forward.

                            ERIC 
                Wait a minute, Hank.  What choice 
                do we have?  Dungeon Master's 
                abandoned us -- Venger may be our 
                only ticket home.

Presto steps INTO SHOT alongside Eric.

                            PRESTO 
                I think Eric's got a point, Hank. 
                Venger's ruthless, but he's got a 
                code.  I believe him.

Sheila joins them.

                            SHEILA 
                So do I.  All I want is to go home 
                -- and I don't care who's responsible 
                for sending us there.

ANGLE FAVORS HANK, BOBBY, UNI, DIANA

They look at the others incredulously.

                            DIANA 
                You guys can't be serious.  You know 
                Venger's bad news.

Hank steps toward Eric, extends a hand toward him.

                            HANK 



13 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html


                Eric, we gotta stick together --

ANOTHER ANGLE

Eric brushes his hand aside.

                            ERIC 
                    (angry) 
                Why, Hank?  We always stick together 
                -- and it hasn't gotten us home. 
                    (beat) 
                You guys can do what you want -- but 
                we're going after that key.

He turns and EXITS SHOT.  Presto hesitates, then follows.  Sheila 
turns, then looks back at Bobby.

                            SHEILA 
                Bobby -- won't you change your mind?

ON BOBBY

He looks very young and uncertain, but he shakes his head and 
moves closer to Hank.

                            BOBBY 
                I think you're making a mistake, 
                Sheila.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Sheila turns and runs into the darkness after the others. Hank, 
Bobby, Diana and Uni watch her go.  SFX: BREAKERS.

                                                        WIPE TO:

EXT. SEASHORE - NIGHT

The breakers, foamy with salt in solution, CRASH on the rime- 
crusted shore.  An ancient galleon is wrecked there, sails hanging 
in tatters, salt stains glittering in the moonlight.  Eric, Presto 
and Sheila ENTER SHOT and climb onto the canted deck.

                            ERIC 
                Think you can make this thing 
                fly, Presto?

ON PRESTO

He takes off his hat and makes magic passes over it, frowning in 
concentration.

                            PRESTO 



14 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html


                Magic in the hat be free; let us 
                use the sky as the sea.

WIDE ANGLE

A shimmering arc of magic light ERUPTS from the hat, engulfing the 
galleon and lifting it, with much CREAKING and SNAPPING of aged 
wood, free of the sand.

CLOSER ON THEM

The ship rises, the remnants of sails FLAPPING uselessly.  Eric 
faces the bow, looking grimly ahead.  Sheila stands behind him.

                            SHEILA 
                Are we doing the right thing, 
                Eric?

Eric doesn't look at her.

                            ERIC 
                I don't know.  But we're not 
                turning back.

                                                        CUT TO:

EXT. CAMPFIRE - ON HANK, DIANA, BOBBY, UNI

Standing by the dying embers of the fire, watching the silhouette 
of the galleon sail across the three moons.

                            HANK 
                We've got to get to Realm's Edge 
                first, somehow --

An O.S. ROAR interrupts him; they all look O.S. and react.

                            BRONZE DRAGON (O.S.) 
                    (roars)

THEIR POV - SEASHORE

A huge BRONZE DRAGON lands at the water's edge, its wings spraying 
foam and sand.

ON KIDS

Bobby steps back warily, raising his club.

                            BOBBY 
                Just what we need -- more problems!

                            UNI

Diana steps forward.

                            DIANA 
                Wait, Bobby.  That's a bronze dragon 
                -- it might help us.

ON BRONZE DRAGON

It watches Diana as she steps forward, her staff raised.  She TAPS 
it gently on its horns with her staff, like a mahout gentling an 
elephant.  With a SNORT, the dragon lowers its head.

                            BRONZE DRAGON 
                    (snorts)

Diana looks at the others triumphantly.

                            DIANA 
                All aboard!

ANOTHER ANGLE

Bobby, Uni and Hank join Diana on the bronze dragon's broad back. 
There is room enough for Uni to huddle between two of the dragon's 
huge dorsal plates.  Diana sits behind the beast's horns.

                            HANK 
                I hope you know what you're 
                doing, Diana.

                            DIANA 
                So do I.

WIDE ANGLE

She TAPS the dragon's horns again.  With a THUNDERCLAP of wings 
the great creature lifts into the night sky.

AERIAL LONG SHOT - BRONZE DRAGON AND FLYING GALLEON

The bronze dragon flies after the shrinking form of the galleon, 
as we --

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. REALM - AERIAL SHOT - DAWN

Much the same shot as before, with the bronze dragon still pursuing 
the flying ship.  They are flying south over a rocky, barren land 
which rises to mountains in the distance.  To the west the two suns 
are rising.

ON BRONZE DRAGON'S BACK - PANNING



16 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html


Diana, Bobby and Uni are asleep, curled up in the hollows between 
the plates, well ahead of the STROKING wings.  Hank stands in 
another hollow, looking grimly ahead, the WIND ruffling his hair. 
PUSH IN on him as he stares O.S. after the galleon.  Suddenly 
Diana's hand ENTERS SHOT and touches his shoulder.  He turns to see 
her behind him, rubbing her eyes sleepily.

                            DIANA 
                    (sleepily) 
                You should get some sleep.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Hank looks off into the distance, frowning.

                            HANK 
                Why do you think we're here, 
                Diana?

                            DIANA 
                In the Realm? 
                    (beat) 
                I always thought it was to defeat 
                Venger.

Hank looks ahead again.

                            HANK 
                So did I -- but I'm beginning to 
                wonder.  Maybe Venger's right about 
                one thing -- maybe things aren't 
                that simple.

                            BOBBY (O.S.) 
                Hey, look!

ANGLE INCLUDES BOBBY

Be and Uni are now awake.  He stands atop one of the plates, 
pointing ahead excitedly.

THEIR POV - FLAME MOUNTAINS

They are approaching the range of mountains now, and we can see 
 they consist of active volcanoes.  Curtains of smoke and ash 
hang over bubbling cauldrons of lava.  Incandescent fountains shoot 
up.  None of the peaks are in the throes of a major eruption, but 
all together they present a dangerous gauntlet to run.  SFX: 
RUMBLING, BUBBLING LAVA.

ON GALLEON - PANNING

It weaves its way through the deadly peaks.  Eric looks over the

side and GULPS as they pass very close to a lake of fire.

                        ERIC 
                (gulps) 
            Hey, we're slowing down, Presto!

ON PRESTO

He takes off his hat and shakes it as though trying to dump more 
magic out of it.  Nothing happens.

                        PRESTO 
            I think my spell's running out of 
            gas!

WIDE ANGLE - ALL

Sheila looks back O.S.

                        SHEILA 
            They're gaining on us!

THEIR POV - BRONZE DRAGON

Flying through the clouds of ash.  We can see Hank leaning around 
one of the plates, looking down.

                        HANK 
            Stop, you guys!  Please!

REVERSE ANGLE

Eric looks up defiantly.

                        ERIC 
            No way!  This is our last chance 
            to go home!

ON HANK - PANNING

He looks angry.  He pulls back an arrow.

                        HANK 
            Have it your way --!

Diana grabs his arm.

                        DIANA 
            Hank!  What're you doing?

                        HANK 
            I'm gonna force them down!

He pulls free of Diana's arm and FIRES the arrow down O.S.

ON ERIC

He raises his shield; the arrow RICOCHETS from it O.S.

DOWNSHOT - VOLCANIC CRATER

The arrow plunges straight down into the the seething molten rock, 
setting off a tremendous ERUPTION that hurtles straight up at us!

ON GALLEON - MOVING

A rain of fiery fragments SHOWERS down on its deck, setting the 
bits of sailcoth afire.  Glowing clouds surround the ship.  Sheila 
and Presto crowd under Eric's shield as chunks of brimstone bounce 
off it.  Smoke obscures the scene.

            Hank!  What've you done?!

ON VOLCANO

Red-hot boulders are hurled from its crater into other nearby ones. 
The entire side of a neighboring peak BLOWS OUT, sending a searing 
STONE WIND -- a deadly cloud of incandescent gas and powdered stone 
-- O.S.

ANGLE INCLUDES HANK, BOBBY, DIANA, UNI

Reacting in fear as the STONE WIND BOILS toward them.

FADE IN:

EXT. FLAME MOUNTAINS - DAY

ERUPTIONS proceeding in full force, and the STONE WIND hurtling 

toward the bronze dragon, who is attempting to outrun it.

ON BRONZE DRAGON'S BACK - PANNING

Hank, Diana, Bobby and Uni hold on for dear life. Hank looks 

back at the approaching WIND, coming like a roiling black wave.

                            HANK 

                It's too fast for us!

                            UNI 

                    (frightened whinny)

FAVORING DIANA

She reaches forward with her staff and TAPS the dragon under the 

jaw.

                            DIANA 

                Go up!  Up!

WIDE ANGLE - BRONZE DRAGON AND STONE WIND

The bronze dragon swoops up O.S.  PAN TO FOLLOW as the boiling

crest 

of vaporized rock just misses it.

EXT. LAVA PLAINS - DAY

With the Flame Mountains in the distance painting the sky a

baleful 

red.  Rivers of lava glow along the horizon.  The exhausted bronze

dragon lands in f.g.

Hank, Diana, Bobby and Uni disembark, and the bronze dragon flies 

O.S.  The four of them, grim faced, turn to look back at the range

offire in the distance.  Bobby is crying.

                            BOBBY 

                    (sniffling) 

                They didn't make it, did they?

                    (false cheer) 

                Sure they did!  They've come through 

                tougher spots than this!

Bobby ignores her, looking at Hank.

                Hank?

TWO SHOT - HANK AND BOBBY

Hank stares O.S. at his friends' funeral pyre.  His shoulders 

drop; he bows his head.

                            HANK 

                I'm sorry, Bobby.  It was my fault.

Bobby turns away.  Diana ENTERS SHOT and puts her hand on Hank's 

shoulder.

                            DIANA 

                What do we do now, Hank ?

Hank straightens; life must go on.

                            HANK 

                The volcanoes won't let us go 

                back.  We'll have to go on -- to 

                Realm's Edge.

Hank turns and looks in the other direction O.S., as does Diana.

THEIR POV

The plain rises for a considerable distance, and ends at the edge 

of a cliff which stretches in either direction as far as they can 

ee. At the edge, barely visible, is the cenotaph -- a lonely, 

crumbling tower on the edge of the world.

TO:

EXT. ANOTHER PART OF PLAIN - DAY

Eric, Sheila and Presto are picking their way over the cracked 

Black lava plain.  The wrecked and smoldering galleon is visible

in 

b.g.  Sheila scrambles to the top of an angled slab and looks O.S.

this way and that.

                            SHEILA 

                Bobby?  Bobby?!

ON ERIC

He looks up O.S. at her.

                            ERIC 

                Any sign of them?

HIS POV - UPSHOT - SHEILA

The WIND plucking at her cloak. She looks around a final time, 

then lowers her head.

                            SHEILA 

                Nothing.  They must've been --

She hides her face in her hands and sinks to her knees on the

slab.

RESUME ERIC

He looks down at the ground also.  Presto ENTERS SHOT, looking at 

him sympathetically.

                            PRESTO 

                It's not your fault, Eric.

                            ERIC 

                Yeah, right.  Somebody else used my 

                shield to bounce a flame arrow into 

                a volcano. 

                    (beat) 

                If you hadn't gotten your magic hat 

                to bail us out, our gooses would be 

                charcoal now.

WIDE ANGLE

Sheila climbs down to join them.

                            ERIC (CONT'D) 

                Come on.  The least I can do is 

                find Venger's key and get you two 

                home.

He turns and trudges O.S.  Presto, looking concerned over his 

friend, follows.  After a beat, Sheila brings up the rear.  There 

are tears on her face.

                                                        WIPE TO:

EXT. REALM'S EDGE - ESTABLISHING - DAY

The cenotaph rises, skyscraper high, on the edge of the cliff. 

PUSH IN on a moucharaby near the top, where two figures stand: 

Venger and Dungeon Master.  They look down O.S.

                            VENGER 

                You will lose, old man.  Their 

                desire to return to their home is 

                stronger than anything else. 

                Without your support they will 

                crumble.

ON DUNGEON MASTER

He looks concerned, but is determined not to let Venger get to

him.

                            DUNGEON MASTER 

                Their courage will not fail them. 

                They will do what has to be done.

THEIR POV - DOWNSHOT - LAVA PLAINS

We can see the two groups of kids making their way slowly toward 

the tower from opposite sides.  The rough terrain hides each group

from the other.

                            VENGER (O.S.) 

                We shall see.  That which is in 

                the cenotaph will test their 

                courage.

                                                        WIPE TO:

EXT. CENOTAPH ENTRANCE - ESTABLISHING - DAY

A huge door in the shape of a stylized dragon's head, the open 

jaws framing the entrance.  Hank, Diana, Bobby and Uni ENTER SHOT 

and stand before it.

                            DIANA 

                We're here.  Now what do we do?

Hank leans wearily against the door.

                            HANK 

                I don't know, Diana.  I think we've 

                gone as far as we can go. 

                    (beat) 

                I guess I've lead us straight to 

                disaster.

INCLUDING DIANA, BOBBY, UNI

They look at each other; they don't know what to say.  Uni

nuzzles  Hank, who rests his head on his arm in an attitude of

despair. 

then:

                            ERIC (O.S.) 

                Hey, look on the bright side -- you 

                beat us here.

They all snap around and stare O.S., then react in joy.

                            HANK 

                    (disbelieving joy) 

                Eric!

THEIR POV - ERIC

Standing atop a small rise, his cape flowing behind him, looking 

cocky.  Sheila and Presto scramble up into view behind him.

                            SHEILA 

                    (ecstatic) 

                Bobby!

She runs down O.S.




24 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html


SHEILA AND BOBBY

They run toward each other and embrace.  PULL BACK to include the 

others as they take turns hugging each other.  Uni capers about 

them all, BLEATING in joy.

                            UNI 

                    (happy unicorn bleats)

                            KIDS 

                    (ad lib) 

                Boy, am I glad to see you!  We 

                thought you were goners!  How'd 

                you get out of that?  Let's never 

                split up again!  (Etc.)

FAVORING HANK AND ERIC

With their arms around each other's shoulders.

                            ERIC 

                I'm sure glad you guys are okay. 

                Now all we have to do is get that 

                key and we can go home.

Hank steps back from Eric.  He looks surprised.

                            HANK 

                You're not still planning on that, 

                are you?

ANGLE INCLUDES ALL

We see that, consciously or not, they've divided into two groups 

again.

                            ERIC 

                You bet we are!  I want to sleep in 

                my own bed tonight!

                            DIANA 

                Eric, you're already sleeping -- 

                and dreaming -- if you think Venger's 

                gonna follow through on his promise.

                            SHEILA 

                If there's even the slightest chance, 

                we've gotta take it.


25 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html


FAVORING HANK

He stands before the door.

                            HANK 

                Forget it, Eric!  Nobody opens this 

                door!

ON ERIC AND PRESTO

Eric stares defiantly O.S.

                            ERIC 

                That's what you think!  Presto, show 

                him!

                            PRESTO 

                    (doubtfully) 

                Well -- okay ...

Presto takes off his hat and aims it O.S.  A bolt of magic force 

ERUPTS from the hat O.S., surprising the young magician as much as

anybody.

                            PRESTO 

                    (surprised grunt)

ON HANK

He tries to dodge as the the bolt streams INTO SHOT, but a tendril

of it lifts him and gently sets him aside, while the main force of

the bolt BATTERS through the cenotaph's door, SPLINTERING it.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Eric, Presto and Sheila run forward, into the cenotaph.

                            ERIC 

                That's three, Presto.  You're on 

                a roll.

ON HANK, DIANA, BOBBY, UNI

Trapped by the dissipating coils of Presto's spell.

                            KIDS 

                    (struggle)

By the time they free themselves, the others are out of sight.


26 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html


                            HANK 

                We've got to stop them -- they're 

                playing right into Venger's hands.

TRACK WITH THEM as they run into the cenotaph.

INT. CENOTAPH - ESTABLISHING

A huge empty chamber, with a side door leading to a stairwell. 

Eric, Presto and Sheila have already started up it when an energy 

arrow BURSTS in the air ahead of them, bringing them to a halt.

ON ERIC

He looks back O.S.  REFIELD to include Hank, Bobby, Uni and Diana 

standing in the doorway.  Hank has another arrow drawn.

                            HANK 

                Don't do it, Eric!

                            ERIC 

                    (quietly) 

                How you gonna stop me, Hank?

ON HANK

He has an arrow drawn, but not raised.  Now he raises it.  Diana 

and Bobby look at him anxiously.

                            HANK 

                I don't know -- but neither of 

                us wants to find out. 

ANOTHER ANGLE 


Emphasizing the standoff for a moment; then the floor suddenly 

shakes, accompanied by a deep RUMBLING.  Everyone looks about

apprehensively.

                            SHEILA 

                What was that?

ON FLOOR

The RUMBLING comes again, much louder now.  Huge flagstones CRACK.

The cracks web out from the center, becoming fissures.  From the 

fissures flow viscous, jelly like streams of translucent 

protoplasm.



27 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html


ON DIANA, HANK AND OTHERS

The streams flow toward them, pseudopodia rising and questing 

blindly for them.  Hank pushes Diana and Bobby toward the stairs.

                            HANK 

                Get off the floor -- quick!

WIDE ANGLE

They run quickly up the stairs.  The floor is now covered with the

semi-solid mass, which begins flowing after them.  It rises and 

forms into a huge, amoeba-like creature.  SFX: GURGLING, SLURPING.

REVERSE ANGLE

Hank, Diana, Bobby and Uni join the others, and they all back up 

the stairwell.  The amoeboid surges after them, almost flowing

over 

Uni's front hooves.  She dances back wildly to avoid it.

                            UNI 

                    ("yuck!")

ANOTHER ANGLE 

the kids back up the stairs, weapons ready. The amoeboid flows

glutinously after them.

                            DIANA 

                What is it?

                            PRESTO 

                Whatever it is, it knows what we 

                are: lunch!

FAVOR HANK

He aims the arrow he nocked earlier down O.S.

                            HANK 

                Yeah?  Let's see if it likes its 

                food spicy.

He FIRES the arrow.

ON AMOEBOID

Almost filing the stairwell below them.  The arrow streaks toward 

it.  A pseudopod rises and engulfs it without visible effect, save


28 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html


for a luminous rippling that spreads down the pseudopod.  Then the

entire mass surges forward again.

                            ERIC (O.S.) 

                    (gulps) 

                Looks like it liked it just fine!

ON KIDS

Presto steps forward, one hand stirring the air over his hat.

                            PRESTO 

                Lemme try!

His hand dips into the hat and pulls out a glowing sphere of

magic, 

which he hurls O.S.

ON AMOEBOID

It absorbs the magic ball much as it did the arrow, and with much 

be same result.  It flows toward us faster than ever.

AS BEFORE - PRESTO

He looks crestfallen.  The group continues backing up the stairs. 

The amoeboid is gaining on them.

                            PRESTO 

                Where's Steve McQueen when you need 

                him?

                            DIANA 

                We'd better think of something. 

                This bowl of jelly means business.

FAVOR BOBBY

He hefts his club determinedly.

                            BOBBY 

                Yeah?  Well, so do I!

ANOTHER ANGLE

Bobby runs forward O.S.  Sheila grabs for him but misses.

                            SHEILA 

                Bobby!  Be careful!


29 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html


ON AMOEBOID

THE Lovecraftian horror rises above Bobby threateningly as he

steps 

INTO SHOT.  Bobby SMASHES his club against one wall of the

stairwell, then the opposite wall.  The walls CRACK and CRUMBLE,

BURYING  the amoeboid beneath tons of debris as Bobby dashes back

O.S.

ON KIDS

They retreat from the dust and flying fragments of rock.

                            SHEILA 

                Bobby?  Are you all right?

A beat; then Bobby runs out from the thick cloud of dust.

                            BOBBY 

                Good news and bad news -- that 

                thing's been buried --

ANGLE ON DUST CLOUD

It clears, revealing that the stairwell is blocked.

                            BOBBY (O. S. CONT'D) 

                But we can't go back down.

FAVORING HANK AND ERIC

Eric looks at Hank in satisfaction.

                            ERIC 

                Which means we have to go up.

Hank looks at him and nods slowly.

                            HANK 

                You win -- for now.

WIDE ANGLE - ALL

They turn away from the cave-in and continue up O.S.

                                                        WIPE TO:

INT. SANCTUM - ESTABLISHING - DAY




30 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html


The topmost part of the cenotaph is the sanctum -- a huge, 

cathedral-like chamber with a gigantic vault on one wall and an 

ornate sarcophagus in the middle of the floor, the lid carved in 

the shape of a figure in repose.  The wall opposite the vault has

collapsed, revealing the abyss beyond the Realm.  The stairwell 

opens off another wall.  Venger and Dungeon Master stand beside 

the sarcophagus.

                            DUNGEON MASTER 

                They are coming, Venger -- doubtful 

                and suspicious of each other and 

                their quest, but still coming.

                            VENGER 

                Bah!  They can yet fail -- and they 

                will.

ANGLE ON VENGER

He looks down at the carved figure on the sarcophagus lid with an 

unreadable expression, then turns away.  We cannot see the

features 

on the figure from this angle.

                            VENGER (CONT'D) 

                Do not celebrate your victory yet, 

                old one.

ON DUNGEON MASTER

He approaches the sarcophagus lid and looks at it.  We still can't

see what's on it clearly.

                            DUNGEON MASTER 

                    (cryptically) 

                It is not I who will be the winner, 

                Venger -- it is you.

A FOOTFALL O.S. causes him to turn.

                            DUNGEON MASTER (CONT'D) 

                They are here.

ON STAIRWELL

Eric, leading the rest, comes into view. He stops and looks 

around him O.S.



31 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html


                            ERIC 

                So this is it.  Doesn't look like 

                much.

ANGLE INCLUDES SANCTUM

Which is now empty, save for the sarcophagus and the kids.  Diana 

points toward the broken wall and the abyss beyond.

                            DIANA 

                    (awed) 

                Look ...

ON BROKEN WALL

The kids approach cautiously and look out over the ultimate gulf.

                            BOBBY 

                    (awed) 

                It goes on forever ...!

THEIR POV - REALM'S EDGE

An endless cliff dropping into the mists of night thousands of 

miles below.  Stars twinkle in the depths.  Barely visible is the 

suggestion of titanic, continent sized pillars that support the 

Realm.

ON VAULT

Sheila approaches the vault.  Almost hidden among the ornate 

intaglio of its surface is a keyhole.

                            SHEILA 

                There's a keyhole here.  This is 

                a door.

ON SARCOPHAGUS

Presto steps up to the sarcophagus and looks at the face of the 

figure carved on it.  He reacts in astonishment.

                            PRESTO

                Look -- on the lid! It's --

CLOSE ON LID

At last we see clearly the carved figure.  It is a man in


32 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html


warrior's 

garb, arms crossed on his chest.  His face, though noble and

serene 

and lacking the fangs, horn, wings, and other accouterments of

evil,  nevertheless is unquestionably that of Venger.

                            PRESTO (O.S. CONT'D) 

                Venger! 

ANOTHER ANGLE

The others gather around, staring at the figure.

                            BOBBY 

                I don't get it.  Who'd want to make 

                old hornhead look good?

FAVORING ERIC

Looking down at the figure.

                            ERIC 

                Only one way to find out. 

                    (beat) 

                Open it.

WIDE ANGLE

The kids all line up on one side of the sarcophagus and push at

the 

heavy stone lid.  With a GRATING of stone on stone, it slides

over.

CLOSE ON SARCOPHAGUS

As the lid moves slowly to one side, revealing the interior of the

sarcophagus.  It is empty, save for an ordinary brass key lying at

the bottom.  PUSH IN on it.

ON ERIC

He reaches in and grabs the key.

                            ERIC 

                We've got the key!  Now all we've 

                got to do is throw it in the abyss 

                and we're home free.

He turns toward the abyss.  Hank ENTERS SHOT, blocking his path.

                            HANK 

                Don't you get it yet?  We'll never 

                get home by trusting Venger.

ANGLE INCLUDES OTHERS

As Hank and Eric face off.

                            ERIC 

                Outta my way, Hank.

Hank shakes his head.

                            HANK 

                No!  I'm right about this -- I 

                know it!

ANOTHER ANGLE

Eric raises his shield -- and then, suddenly, all of them are 

thrown off their feet by the SHATTERING of the floor next to the 

sarcophagus.

                            KIDS 

                    (surprised walla)

ON FLOOR

The amoeboid rises from the floor, pseudopods lashing out in all

directions.  The kids scatter to avoid it.

                            KIDS 

                    (ad lib) 

                Look out!  That thing's back 

                again!  Watch out for those 

                tentacles! (Etc. )

ON ERIC

Bolding the key.  A pseudopod surges THROUGH SHOT, STRIKING his 

shield and sending him sprawling O. S.

                            ERIC 

                    (impact grunt)

ON EDGE OF FLOOR

Eric lands near the edge of the abyss.  He looks at the key, then 

raises his hand to throw it in.

CLOSE ON HIS HAND

Bank's hand ENTERS SHOT and grabs his wrist.

                            HANK 

               No!

ANOTHER ANGLE

Eric tries to pull his hand from Hank's grasp.

                            ERIC 

                Let me go!

ON DIANA

Backing up before a surging wave of the amoeboid, her staff held 

out before her.  A pseudopod extrudes from the main mass and wraps

about her staff, pulling Diana toward it.  Diana braces her feet, 

but the thing is too strong for her.

                            DIANA 

                    (struggles)

ON PRESTO

Holding his hat out before him as he backs away from the oncoming 

horror.

CLOSE ON HAT

It glows, but before anything can emerge a pseudopod wraps about 

it, closing it and seizing Presto's arms.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Presto is lifted off his feet.  He dangles helplessly in the 

pseudopod's grasp.

                            PRESTO 

                Hey!

ON ERIC AND HANK

They are on their feet now, both holding onto the key. Hank's back

is to the abyss.

                            ERIC 

                Let me do it!  Do you want to be 



35 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html


                a prisoner here forever?

CLOSE ON HANK

His eyes widen in sudden realization.

                            HANK 

                Eric!  Remember what you said about 

                this whole Realm being a dungeon?

ON ERIC

Still holding onto the key as Hank speaks.

                            HANK (O.S. CONT'D) 

                I think you were right!  We're all 

                prisoners here -- including Venger! 

                And this is the key!

ON UNI

Backed into a corner.  A pseudopod wraps about her and lifts her 

O.S.

                            UNI 

                    (bleat of fear )

ON SHEILA

She flips her hood up over her head as another pseudopod reaches 

for her.  She becomes invisible, but the amoeboid evidently uses 

other senses than sight to track its prey. It wraps about Sheila's

invisible form.

                            SHEILA (V.O.) 

                    (screams)

The hood falls away and she becomes visible again as she is

lifted, 

kicking, off the floor.

ON BOBBY

Backed into another corner, swinging his club to keep a pseudopod 

at bay.  He sees what's happening O.S.

                            BOBBY 

                Sheila!  Uni!



36 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html


He raises the club over his head and SLAMS it down on the floor.

WIDE ANGLE - AMOEBOID

The SHOCK WAVE ripples through its protoplasmic form, causing it 

to drop Sheila, Uni, Diana and Presto.

                            SHEILA, UNI, DIANA, PRESTO 

                    (impact grunts)

ON HANK AND ERIC

The SHOCK WAVE rocks them both; Hank lets go of the key, drops his

bow and staggers backward.  He hovers for a second, arms 

windmilling, on the edge of infinity -- then falls.

                            HANK 

                    (trailing cry)

ANOTHER ANGLE

Eric lunges for him, but it's too late -- he's gone.

                            ERIC 

               Hank!

ON AMOEBOID

It's recovered from the effects of Bobby's blow.  The kids are 

grouped together now. The amoeboid flows toward them like a

sentient wave, surrounding them.

ANOTHER ANGLE

They try to free themselves, but it's like trying to run through 

heavy oil.  The protoplasm flows up around them -- another moment 

and it will encase them completely.

                            KIDS 

                    (struggle)

ON ERIC

He looks back toward his O.S. friends, then at the abyss.  He 

looks at the key in his hand.

WIDER ANGLE

Venger suddenly MATERIALIZES before him.  He points toward the 



37 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html


abyss.

                            VENGER 

                The key, Cavalier!  Throw it into 

                the abyss -- or you will never see 

                your home again!

ON ERIC

He looks at the abyss, then O.S. in the opposite direction.

HIS POV - VAULT

PUSH IN on it, emphasizing the keyhole.

RESUME ERIC

He makes his decision -- he turns and runs for the vault!

ON VENGER

He spreads his wings in wrath.

                            VENGER 

                    (roars) 

               Stop!

He hurls a MAGIC BOLT O.S.

ON ERIC - RUNNING

The bolt SPLASHES against his shield, staggering him, but he keeps

going.

ON VENGER

He raises his hand to hurl another blast, but just then a

pseudopod 

ENTERS SHOT, wrapping about him, pinning his arms.  He struggles.

                            VENGER 

                    (struggles)

ON VAULT

Eric comes to a halt before the vault.

                            ERIC 

                Hank, you'd better be right --!



38 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html


He thrusts the key into the lock and turns it.

ON VENGER

He frees himself of the pseudopod with a BURST of magic.  His eyes

grow wide as he realizes he's too late.

                            VENGER 

               No!

ON VAULT

The massive door swings open.  A cascade of coruscating light 

bursts forth, momentarily silhouetting Eric, who staggers

backward. 

The pyrotechnic forces sweep outward O.S.  APPROPRIATE SFX.

ON KIDS

The amoeboid's mass has nearly risen over their heads when the 

EFX wash over it.  The amoeboid shimmers and VANISHES in a burst

of 

brilliance.  The kids fall to the floor.

ON VENGER

He steps backward, holding his hands out in a futile attempt to 

warn off the magic, which engulfs him.

                          VENGER 

                (cry of fear)

                                                        CUT TO:

EXT. CENOTAPH - LONG SHOT

Streams of magic BURST from the tower, spreading away from Realm's

Edge and O.S.

EXT. FIELDS - DAY

Several SERFS toiling among crops.  A magic bolt from the vault 

IMPACTS near them like an incandescent meteorite, and a portal 

opens there, showing the single sun of Earth shining over a

medieval town.  The serfs drop their mattocks and rush toward the

portal.

                        SERFS 

                (happy cries)


39 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html


EXT. PLAIN - NIGHT

Another magic bolt ZAPS a portal near a group of LIZARD MEN.  The 

world opened for them is that of a tropical jungle, with three red

suns shining above it.  The lizard men rush into the portal.

                        LIZARD MEN 

                (hisses)

WIDE ANGLE - REALM - PANNING

A SLOW PAN that shows bolts from the cenotaph descending in all 

parts of the Realm, creating portals wherever they STRIKE.

EXT. VENGER'S CITADEL - DAY

ORCS, BULLIWOGS and other servants of Venger flee in terror as a 

bolt arcs toward the citadel.

                        ORCS, BULLIWOGS 

                (panicked cries)

CLOSER

SHADOWDEMON emerges, reacts to the approaching destruction, then

hightails it O.S.  A moment later the citadel is STRUCK AND 

DESTROYED by the bolt.

                                                        CUT TO:

INT. CENOTAPH - VAULT

As the last of the magic streams out and O.S., leaving Eric 

sitting, dazed, before a huge, empty vault.  Diana, Sheila, 

Presto, Bobby and Uni run INTO SHOT.  Presto helps Eric up.

                        ERIC 

               (awed whisper) 

            Did you see that?

                        PRESTO 

            You kidding?  We were all ringside.

                        DIANA 

            Looks like Hank was right ...

ON ERIC

He reacts to this in shock.


40 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html


                        ERIC 

            Hank!!

He rushes O.S.  The others follow.

ON EDGE OF ABYSS - UPSHOT

The kids gather around the edge of the abyss and look down, 

fearing the worst.  Then they smile in relief.

                        HANK (O.S.) 

            Well, don't just stand there --

REVERSE ANGLE - DOWNSHOT - HANK

Hanging from a rocky outcropping over the abyss.

                        HANK (CONT'D) 

           Get me outta here!

ANOTHER ANGLE

Diana extends her staff to Hank.  It glows as he pulls himself up 

hand over hand to stand beside them.  He picks up his bow and 

looks O.S.

                        HANK 

            Hey!  What's happening to Venger?

They all look O.S. and react as shimmering light begins to bleed 

INTO SHOT.

THEIR POV - VENGER

Still wrapped in the luminous spell.  It TRANSMOGRIFIES him, 

changing him into the noble, majestic figure whose likeness is 

carved on the sarcophagus.  He looks down at himself in disbelief.

When he speaks, his voice is that of Venger, but without the 

sinister reverb.

ON KIDS

Watching in awe.  Hank raises his bow in a gesture of triumph.

                            HANK 

                I was right!  Our mission in the 

                Realm was not to defeat Venger -- 

                it was to redeem him!



41 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html


WIDE ANGLE - KIDS AND VENGER

As the new Venger approaches the kids.  Then, before them all, a 

burst of prismatic light appears and forms into Dungeon Master. 

He looks at Venger, and smiles.  Venger kneels before him.

                            VENGER 

                Father -- I have returned.

CLOSER - KIDS, DUNGEON MASTER, VENGER

Uni nuzzles Venger's hand as Dungeon Master, tears in his eyes, 

turns toward the kids.

                            DUNGEON MASTER 

                    (emotionally) 

                Thank you, my young pupils.  You 

                have done the one thing it was not 

                in my power to do -- you have 

                returned my son to me.

The kids look at each other in confusion.

                            ERIC 

                    (to Dungeon Master) 

               You're Venger's father?

                            PRESTO 

                There's not a big family 

                resemblance ...

ON VENGER

He smiles.

                            VENGER 

                Thousands of years ago, I chose to 

                follow another Master -- one of evil.

                                                              HANK

                     (understanding)

                The Nameless One.

                            VENGER

                I imprisoned in this cenotaph all that 

                which Dungeon Master had given me. 

                And now you have set me free.




42 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html


ANGLE INCLUDES VAULT

Dungeon Master raises his hands, and a final bolt streaks from the

vault, IMPACTING near the kids and forming a portal.  Within it 

they can see the amusement park.

                            KIDS 

                    (gasps)

                            DUNGEON MASTER 

                And you have given those trapped in 

                this Realm their freedom.  I can do 

                no less for you.  You are free to 

                return to your world now, if you 

                wish.

ANGLE ON KIDS

They look at each other in disbelieving joy as Dungeon Master 

continues.

                           DUNGEON MASTER (O.S. CONT'D) 

                Or you may stay here, in the Realm. 

                There is still much evil to be dealt 

                with, and many adventures yet to be 

                had.

WIDE ANGLE

The kids and Uni stand in front of the portal, with Dungeon 

Master on one side and Venger on the other.

                        DUNGEON MASTER (CONT'D) 

                The choice, my children, is yours.

The kids look at each other, grinning, ready to make their 

greatest decision of all, as we PULL BACK, through the broken wall

of the cenotaph, BACK, rising over Realm's Edge, BACK STILL 

FURTHER, craning up above mountains, through clouds, until at last

we encompass an incredible vista:  the Realm itself, with its

myriad lands and lifeforms, its dangers and its joys; a new Realm

now, but still, and always: the Realm of Dungeons and Dragons.

                                                        FADE OUT
