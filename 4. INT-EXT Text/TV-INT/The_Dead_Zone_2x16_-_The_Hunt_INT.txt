            Following the man into the living room, which has been
            transformed, though not as we might expect.  Furniture
          has been pushed aside or removed to make way for a mobile
          command center's worth of high-tech gear, including
          monitors and laptops displaying biomedical data, manned
          by more "asbestos workers" in hazmat suits.

          Our guy sets his box down and opens it to reveal several
            STARBUCKS COFFEES.  He brings two to a man and woman
          dressed in dark business suits, seated in front of a
          monitor whose screen we don't yet see.

          The man is FRANK, 35, mild-looking with thoughtful eyes. 
          He wears a radio headset with a small boom mic.  He accepts
          the coffees, passes one to HARRIET, 30, attractive in a
          guarded, Jody Fosterish way.  Frank speaks into his mic.

                                        FRANK
                          Anything, John?

          And now we REVEAL THE MONITOR SCREEN, which shows Johnny
          sitting alone in a pool of light, also wearing a headset. 
          Electrodes are attached to his temples and run inside his
          shirt.  His eyes are closed.

                                        FRANK
                        John, can you hear me?

          PUSHING IN as Johnny's eyes open.  And in a sudden RUSHING
          SHOT, we FOLLOW THE VIDEO CABLE from the back of the
          monitor across the living room floor, under the closed
          door to the kitchen, under the closed door to the dining
          room, and up to a VIDEO CAMERA mounted on a tripod in --

                                        JOHNNY
                        I hear you but I can't help you.

            INTERCUTTING now with the living room as a technician
          observes Johnny's fluctuating bio readings and takes notes
          on a clipboard.

                                        JOHNNY (V.O.)
                        Like I said, it doesn't always
                        work.

                                        HARRIET
                                (sotto, annoyed)
                        Or as he should've said, "it never
                        works."

          Frank shoots her a look, then speaks patiently to Johnny.

                                        FRANK
                        That's fine, John.  Let's move on
                        to the next item and retarget.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Retarget.  Right.  Gonna retarget
                        right now.

          ON THE MONITOR, he picks up a ziplock containing a
            cigarette lighter, as Harriet again mutters her annoyance.

                                        HARRIET
                        This is what we get for recruiting
                        from the tabloids.

                        Halsey wants "new blood."  He
                        thinks the program's at risk.

                                        HARRIET
                        If anything's at risk, it's his
                        job.  And guess who's not going
                        to save it?

          She nods to the monitor, on which Johnny can be seen
          handling the lighter.  Frank sighs, speaks into his mic.

                                        FRANK
                        John, again, we just want you to
                          describe the current location of
                        the agent that lighter belongs
                        to, and what he or she is doing
                        there.

                                (to Harriet)
                        Maybe it's, you know, stage fright.

                        Or maybe it's, you know, a scam. 
                        Either way, we're done.

          She prepares to leave.  Frank nods resignedly, turns back
          to the monitor.

                                        FRANK
                        John, I'm afraid this isn't working
                        out.

          Johnny's frustrated as well.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sorry, I told you before we
                          started, I can't touch anything
                        and get a vision just because
                          someone's keeping score.

                        Car keys.  Where did I leave my
                          damn...?

          This time Johnny overhears, then sees a set of keys on
          the dining table.  He reaches to grab them...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Someone looking for these?

          ...and on contact we RAMP TO HIS FACE.

          CLOSE ANGLE ON A LAPTOP SCREEN as Johnny's bio readings
          go nuts.  The technician monitoring them looks toward
          Frank, who turns back to his monitor, where Johnny is
            clutching the keys tightly.

                                        FRANK
                        John?

          But Johnny's eyes seem to be staring right out of the
          monitor at Harriet.

          And as Harriet finally fumbles for her cell...



          A little while later.  The workers are packing up
          equipment, moving out.  Harriet closes her cell, turns to
          Frank and Johnny.  She's still somewhat stunned and
            overwhelmed, as anyone would be in these circumstances.

                                        HARRIET
                        The paramedics... They used a...

                                        HARRIET (V.O.)
                        In 1995, however, the program was
                          transferred to the CIA, which saw
                        it as a potential embarrassment
                        and shut it down.  That, at least,
                        is the official story.



          Amidst mops and cleaning supplies, Harriet attaches a
          magnetic ID/DOOR CARD to Johnny's lapel, then holds her
          own card against a metal wall at the end of the closet.

                          Unofficially... well, let's just
                        say that a program that no longer
                        exists can no longer be an
                            embarrassment...

          A simple beige corridor punctuated by doors with swipe
          card locks.  There are no windows in this facility, so
          we'll mostly dispense with designating night and day. 
          Harriet and Johnny walk along, passing other personnel,
          some in military uniform, most frumpily dressed civilians.

                                        JOHNNY
                        No phone booth.  I was hoping for
                        a phone booth.  And maybe a Cone
                        of Silence.

                                        HARRIET
                        We've heard all the jokes, but if
                        you actually come up with something
                        new, by all means share.

                        No windows, either, I see.

          Harriet and Johnny step into a large facility that's a
          cross between Mission Control and the control room of a
            recording studio.  It's dominated by a TRIPTYCH OF HUGE
          PLASMA SCREENS currently showing a mix of SATELLITE IMAGES
          and data.  Rows of consoles and computers are staffed by
          a mix of military and civilian personnel, while a large
          window overlooks another space containing a big grey cube: 
              a "room-within-the-room" that's suspended over a pool of
          water, accessed by metal catwalks.

                        We call this the War Room, but
                        it's really just an information
                        way station.  All the intelligence
                          developed here is sent on to the
                          Pentagon and CIA, where, if it's
                        deemed actionable, it's relayed
                        to forward military bases, carriers
                        supporting long-range recon and
                        strike teams.

                        And that's Colonel Halsey, our
                        C.O.  He won't mind if we observe.

          And as she leads Johnny closer...


          FAVORING THE MONITORS

          The largest one shows a high angle view of GRANOWITZ, 40,
          dark, shadowed eyes; ex-Special Forces, now a different
          type of warrior.  The interior of the Tank is furnished
          with just a small desk and an ergonomic chair.  There's a
          DRAWING PAD on the table, and a SECOND MONITOR is focused
          on it as Granowitz SKETCHES the interior of a well-
          buttressed mine-like tunnel that's filled with crates of
          rifles, mortar and RPG rounds, and other military hardware. 
          Granowitz's voice comes through a speaker.

                                        GRANOWITZ (MONITOR)
                        I'm moving through one of the
                        outer tunnels.  It's cooler here. 
                        Some sort of forced ventilation. 
                        Hmm.  I'm tasting metal.  Steel,
                        no trace of rust oxides.  They
                        must've reinforced the walls with
                        new girders since my last session. 
                          Construction here seems much more
                          sophisticated than Tora Bora. 
                        You could drop thousand pounders
                        on this place all day and barely
                        rattle their teacups.

                                        FRANK
                        What about a tactical nuclear
                        device?

          But Halsey, who's been listening with mounting impatience,
          leans over him and punches an intercom button.

                                        HALSEY
                        What about the target, Reg?

                                        GRANOWITZ (MONITOR)
                        Sorry, I'm not sensing him right
                        now.  They could've moved him,
                        maybe to a new part of the complex
                          I haven't discovered yet.

                                        HALSEY
                                (under his breath)
                        We're spinning our wheels.

                        Sir?

          Halsey indicates the "Viewscreen," which shows overlapping
            SATELLITE IMAGES of a region of Iran bordering Afghanistan.

                                        HALSEY
                          Sixty-eight hours of satellite
                        time, and imagery analysis can't
                        come up with a shred of
                          corroboration.  We let him keep
                        this up, he'll bust our budget
                        for the entire op.

            A cutaway to the monitor shows Granowitz looking up at
          the camera, annoyed.  Neither Halsey nor Frank notice.

                                        FRANK
                        But what if he's still right about
                        the target?  If the Mujahideen-i-
                        Kalq are sheltering him...?

                                        HALSEY
                        They're arms smugglers.  They
                          wouldn't want the heat.  Anyway,
                        there's no other intel supporting
                        his Iran theory.

                                        GRANOWITZ
                                (on monitor, pissed)
                        Hey, you guys wanna have a private
                        talk, maybe you should turn off
                        the goddamn intercom first.

                                        HALSEY
                        For Chrisssakes, Frank.

          He punches it off, as we cut away to the two technicians
          seen earlier, who roll their eyes.  Halsey rubs his brow,
          clearly under pressure.

                                        HALSEY
                        This is no good.  I've got the
                        Three Blind Mice coming in to
                        review the entire program.  If I
                        can't show them some progress...

          That worry hangs in the air as his anxious eyes find
          Johnny, then narrow.  He turns to Frank, indicates
            Granowitz on the monitor

                                        HALSEY
                        Tell Reg that he's, uh, earned a
                        rest, take him out of the rotation.

                        I think maybe it's time for a new

            Granowitz MOS in the b.g.  Harriet makes intros.

                          Colonel.

          Halsey doesn't offer his hand, eyes Johnny appraisingly.

                                        HALSEY
                        You're a psychometric, right?

          During which, through the observation window we see a
          technician roll a set of STEPS ON WHEELS up to the Tank,
          then unlock a door to let Granowitz out. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Don't think I've ever heard it
                        put quite that way before.

                                        HALSEY
                        We like to think we trade in
                        science here, Mister Smith...

                        ability of my own.  Nothing in
                        your league of course.

            Granowitz enters from the outer room, eyes them both coolly
          as he accepts a water bottle from a technician.  Halsey
          barely glances at him...

                        Now I know you're not familiar 
                        with our protocols, but I'm betting
                        if we work together, we can achieve
                        some remarkable results.

            Granowitz just shakes his head wearily and exits.

                        I'll do my best, sir.  It might
                        help if I had a better idea of

                          Actually, that would be a bad
                        idea.  We call it "front loading."

                        it could skew the results of your
                          sessions.

          Halsey steps closer to Johnny.

                        Bottom line:  You're here because
                        you want to make a difference,
                        help your country win this war,
                        am I right son?

          A beat as Johnny considers how to answer this, but in the
          end he just nods an acknowledgment.

                                        HALSEY
                        Good.  Then you do your job, and

          In the Tank, the last technician exits and locks the door.

          Johnny takes a deep breath, then opens the first bin. 
          There are a bunch of items inside, all the detritus of
          war.  Among them:  a SHARD OF BURNED METAL; DOG TAGS;

          and Taliban fighters trying to evacuate.  We HEAR shouting
          in a mix of Arab languages (predominantly Arabic and
          Pashtu, and note that no fighters will actually be seen
          shouting on-camera; the dialogue will be dubbed over a
          general hubbub of panic) as one-ton bombs rock the chamber. 
          Debris rains down, fluorescents flicker and swing...
            illuminating a MAN partly buried by rubble at Johnny's
          feet.


  1717JOHNNY IN THE TANK

          eyes closed as he grips the garment tighter with one hand
          and, almost unconsciously, starts to draw with the other. 
          (NOTE: the tablet doesn't show what he draws; instead we
          will see the result on a monitor in the War Room.)
          Tentatively at first, but soon it will seem as though his
          drawing hand indeed has a mind of its own.  And as he
          draws...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm in a cave.  It's being bombed.



          fighters rush past him carrying equipment and supporting
          wounded comrades.

                                        JOHNNY
                        There are soldiers... Arab
                          soldiers... evacuating.



          Some of the technicians are beginning to show interest as
          well while Halsey continues to watch the monitors,
            including one that shows Johnny's drawing-in-progress,
          images beginning to take shape within the welter of lines.

                                        HALSEY
                        I'll be goddamned.  Right out of
                        the box.



          A couple of men now rush toward the man in the rubble.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Now they're helping another man
                        who's buried under the debris.

          The men clear away debris, revealing part of that
          distinctive clothing pattern...



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "THE HUNT FOR OSAMA" - ACT ONE - 2/6/03 WHT-2  16.


    19CONTINUED:19

                                        JOHNNY
                        He's wearing the same clothing.



          Halsey rests a hand on the back of Harriet's chair, growing
          more excited.

                                        HARRIET
                        Is he alive?



          Johnny's pen steps up the pace, scratching quick jagged
          strokes across the surface of the tablet, like the needle
          of an old-fashioned polygraph machine.



          a would-be rescuer checks the pulse in the buried man's
          wrist, shakes his head at his companion.

                                        JOHNNY (O.S.)
                        No.



          the technicians are perking up too, wondering if Johnny's
          about to confirm that this man is who they think he is. 
          Halsey punches the intercom.

                                        HALSEY
                        John, can you describe him?



          And now under the flickering lights, we see Johnny
            crouching beside the dead man, whose face has been exposed. 
          It's a young Arab fighter with a wispy beard.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He's just a kid.  Barely out of
                        his teens.



          Startled reactions.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "THE HUNT FOR OSAMA" - ACT ONE - 2/6/03 WHT-2  17.


    24CONTINUED:24

                                        HALSEY
                        Are you positive?



                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm looking right at him.



          Surprise yields to disappointment.  Halsey makes a gesture
          to Harriet to wrap it up.

                                        HARRIET
                        Okay, John.  That's all for today.



          But now, a scrum of fighters clustered tightly around
          another man they're shielding rush toward Johnny.  A
          BEARDED MAN wearing FLASHY GOLD AVIATOR GLASSES leads the
          pack, shouting in Arabic to clear a path.

                                        BEARDED MAN
                                (Arabic)
                        Out of the way, out of the way! 
                        Hurry!  Hurry!  Go!  Go!  Go! 

          And as Johnny rises from his crouch, starts to repeat the
          same words...



          ...We hear them coming from his TRANCED IMAGE ON A MONITOR.

                                        JOHNNY (MONITOR)
                                (Arabic)
                        Out of the way, out of the way! 
                        Hurry!  Hurry!  Go!  Go!  Go!

          Halsey turns, surprised.  He thought they were done.

                                        HALSEY
                        What the hell?

                                        HARRIET
                          John...?          DEAD ZONE: "THE HUNT FOR OSAMA" - ACT ONE - 2/6/03 WHT-2  18.



          Johnny is now watching the scrum rush past.  In their
          midst he glimpses a TALL MAN IN A WHITE TURBAN-LIKE SAUDI
          "GUTRA" (i.e., Osama's hat).

                                        JOHNNY
                        There's a bunch of fighters trying
                        to evacuate someone... he's tall...
                        can't see his face but he's wearing
                        some kind of white headgear.



          And now everyone in the WAR ROOM is riveted, technicians
          looking up from their monitors, murmuring to each other.

                                        HALSEY
                        Keep it down, people.  We are
                        working here.



          ...as another massive bomb rocks the cave.  Some of the
          men stumble and the Bearded Man loses his glasses.  The
          others rush on ahead as he stoops to pick them up.  But
          they're broken.  He leaves them and rushes on, but not
          before giving Johnny a good look at his face.

          And then another bomb hits.  Johnny looks up as THE ENTIRE
          CEILING COMES CRASHING DOWN, OUR WORLD AND HIS GOING BLACK.



          Johnny comes out of the vision, collects himself, then
          reacts to the pen still clutched tightly in his hand. 
          And off this...



          And now we see what his pen has wrought:  images emerging
          from a tangled welter of dark lines, as though rising up
          from a dark well:  the face of the dead young fighter,
          the scrum of fighters, the man with the glasses.  This
          last face is isolated and overlaid with a grid of lines
          and graphics.

          TILTING DOWN to see a FACIAL COMPOSITE -- a nearly
            photographic "police sketch" -- taking shape on a smaller
            eye-level screen, a technician working the console, then
          panning to the original drawing in Halsey's hands.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "THE HUNT FOR OSAMA" - ACT ONE - 2/6/03 WHT-2  19.

                                        HALSEY
                        Still claim you're not an artist?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't even remember picking up
                        my pen.

          Johnny's handing Harriet his wireless headset and receiver,
            unsettled by this strange new manifestation of his powers,
          and by what those powers have just shown him.

                                        HALSEY
                        There's been a persistent theory,
                        one you may've laid to rest, that
                        our target...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Can we at least call him by his
                          name...?

                                        HALSEY
                        ...that our target died during
                        the Tora Bora campaign.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Osama Bin Laden.

                                        HALSEY
                        I'm afraid I can't confirm or
                        deny the target's identity.

          He moves to another station, Johnny and Harriet trailing.

                                        HARRIET
                        It's like we said, John, the less
                        you know, the less you'll be
                          influenced.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Influenced by what?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Only my visions aren't subjective.

          Harriet and Halsey exchange guarded looks.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Look, I admit, there is one image
                        I can't get out of my head.  Two
                        towers crashing down.

                        But that image is why I'm here,
                        it's why we're all here.  That
                        image and how it makes us feel.

                        I want to find that bastard as

                        be clear that's what I'm doing.

          Halsey eyes him for a beat, then smiles wistfully.

                                        HALSEY
                          Clarity.  What we all wouldn't
                        give for a little clarity.

                        it tomorrow.

          Halsey heads off.  Johnny looks after him, but Harriet
          start to steer him toward the door.

          They pass the two technicians we saw when we entered.

                                        TECHNICIAN #1
                        Elvis has left the building.

          But some of the derision is gone from his tone as he turns
          back to his work:  reviewing TIME-CODED VIDEO of Johnny
          in the Tank.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

          FADE IN:

  3434OMITTED



          Still no windows but it's a much warmer space than the
          war room, designed as an off-hours retreat for the remote
          viewers.  PLANTS flourish under GROW LAMPS.  There are
          comfy chairs, books, board games, and a FOOSBALL TABLE.

          There are three people inside:  Granowitz, who's misting
          the plants; SYLVIA, late 40s, seated at a CONFERENCE TABLE
          laying out Tarot cards; and an older, courtly gentleman
          named MONTY, late 60s, who sits across from her smoking a
          PIPE as he daubs paint on a tiny intricately carved bird.

            Granowitz looks up, sensing something.

                                        GRANOWITZ
                          Company.

          A second later, the door clicks open.

                                (no response; to John:)
                        You can wait here while I check
                        on your room. 
                                (about to exit)
                        Oh, and we have one very firm
                        rule:  no comparing notes on
                        current ops.

          She shuts the door, leaving Johnny feeling like the new
          kid at school.  He nods to Granowitz...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey.

          ...and is ignored.  Johnny sighs and goes to a COFFEE
          STATION, then picks up a MUG with a slogan on it.

          INSERT - MUG

          as Johnny turns it to read:  WHEN THE GOING GETS WEIRD,
          THE WEIRD TURN PRO.  He smiles in recognition, turns to
          display the mug.

          Sylvia finally looks up, eyes him appraisingly.

                        mug, why don't you fill it up?

                        apologies.

          Her wry tone is uniquely hers, but all three viewers share
          the jaded weariness of war vets.  Johnny comes over with
          two coffees, noticing her Tarot cards.

                        Oh Mon-tey, we have a guest.

                        Amazing detail.

          He notices the thick-lensed glasses hanging from a cord
          around Monty's neck.

                        But wouldn't it help to wear those?

                        I only need them in the Tank. 
                          Sometimes I have trouble reading
                        signs or making out faces.  During
                        my viewing sessions, I mean.

                        Pick a card.  Let Madame Sylvia
                        read your fortune.

          Johnny picks one, but instead of releasing it, she holds
          on tightly, staring intently into his eyes, speaking as
          if from a trance.

                                        SYLVIA
                        The weight.  So much weight. 
                        Like you're carrying the world on

                        to save us, all of us.

          Johnny abruptly lets go.  Sylvia exhales and smiles, taps
          her head...

          He turns back to his plants, shaking his head.  The door
          opens and Harriet pops her head back in.

          Johnny does.  She turns over the top card.  It bears the
          name "The Star," a card that needs little explanation.

          Harriet is showing Johnny into what resembles a no-frills
          motel room.  A bed, TV/VCR, door to a bathroom.  Johnny's
          suitcase is already open on a stand.

          And as Johnny takes the SCHEDULE, we TIME CUT to him
          sitting on the edge of the bed, alone now in the room.

          Johnny lies back on the bed as her drone fades into the

          The voices bleeding into each other as Johnny closes his
          eyes and as we begin a gradual PUSH IN on his face, we

          is taking a toll on him as his pen now repeatedly circles

          while the other man cautiously unlocks it.  The man with

  5353BACK IN THE SAFE HOUSE

          a man's voice calls out harshly, and Johnny turns to see
          a fourth man -- severe-looking, clean-shaven, 40s, a
          STETHOSCOPE around his neck -- emerge from another room,
          shutting the door behind him.  We'll call him the DOCTOR.

                        They've got a big device of some
                        kind.  Sunglasses brought some
                        plastic tubing that Stethoscope's
                        trying to attach to it.

          we see Johnny's hand already sketching it.

  5757BACK TO THE SAFE HOUSE

          where the Doctor is holding the ill-fitting tube, shouting
          angrily at Sunglasses.  He exits into the other room,
          slamming the door.  Johnny starts to follow, but stops in
          front of the door.  It LOOMS in front of him like some
          impossible barrier, and as his hand stretches toward it,
          he reacts in pain.

          Johnny enters with his pad, sees Halsey, Harriet and a
          few technicians clustered excitedly around a console.

                                        HALSEY
                        John, is this the device you saw?

          He indicates a monitor that shows Johnny's drawing of the
            appliance next to a photograph of very similar device,
          along with the manufacturer's specs.

          A knot of women in blue burquas approach Johnny, straw
          shopping baskets in their arms.

                                        JOHNNY (O.S.)
                        Well, there seems to be a pretty
                        strict dress code where the women
                        are concerned.  Most of them are
                        wearing those things that, um,
                        completely cover their --

          Johnny turns to watch the women go by.

          Another technician, who's been following the conversation
          on headphones, types "Burqua" and "blue" in a section for
          women's clothing.  A window then shows a woman in a blue
          burqua.

          Pulling back to find Harriet standing beside him.

                        John Smith, Senator.

                        You think you've found our target,
                        Mr. Smith?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sir, I've never been told exactly
                        who the target --

                                        SENATOR
                                (quietly)
                        We all know who it is.  Did you
                        find him or not?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I never actually saw him, no. 
                        But --

                                        HALSEY
                                (overlapping, quickly)
                        But he has seen known associates
                        of the target, and medical
                          evidence.  His description of the
                        village has been verified by
                          satellite and aerial recon... and
                          independent intelligence obtained
                        from captured al Qaeda sources
                          indicate the target has been seen
                        in this region recently.

                                (agreeing)
                        That's actionable intelligence,
                          Senator.

                                        DEPUTY SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
                          I agree.  We act now or we risk
                        losing him, like we did with the
                          Predator incident last year, and
                        I'm sure as hell not going to
                        tell that to the President.

          The Senator nods, it's pretty convincing...

          Johnny approaches the door and is stopped again by that
          same invisible barrier.  He reaches out to the door, hand
          trembling, face again showing pain...

          Johnny still straining, his face pained, gripping the
          glasses tightly... then, reveal Granowitz's hand on
          Johnny's shoulder.  Johnny glances up at him, dimly aware,
          then turns back into his trance...



          As though he's received a "psychic boost," Johnny is
          suddenly able to move toward the door.  Suddenly, he's in 
          THE ROOM.  Only there's no one there.

          Harriet and Halsey are watching Johnny straining on the

                        sure you won't reconsider?

                        Harriet had me pegged from the
                        start.  I'm just not "Company"
                          material.

                          I wasn't being fair.  The fact
                        is, with proper training...

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's not about training, it's
                        about having a temperament for
                        this kind of work.  As a wise
                          philosopher once said, "A man's
                        gotta know his limitations."

                        Anyway, at least this way the
                        Colonel has someone to blame for
                        this little fiasco.  Which is
                        fine by me.

                                        HARRIET
                        John, you gave a few young men
                        their futures back today.
