Grainy, Kodak color, nineteen sixties documentary
footage of a beautiful Polynesian island. We SEE quick
shots of Kimono Dragons, Gila Monsters and Chameleons
all in their natural tropical environment.
Super: Moruro Atoll Islands, French Polynesia - June
1968
Incongruously over this jungle environment we HEAR a
static ridden radio filtered VOICE, slowly counting down
in French. It is almost as through the reptiles of the
island are reacting to the countdown as they anxiously
move about.
Suddenly with a brilliant FLASH OF WHITE LIGHT, a
nuclear EXPLOSION mushrooms into the sky.
We SEE a SERIES of REAL shots of footage of some of the
over one hundred and sixty official nuclear tests the
French government held in this tropical region.
Explosion after explosion devastates the locale. One
building after the next, accelerating in momentum,
culminating in one final EXPLOSION.
The clould-filled sky begins to drizzle. The ash-like
fallout drifts downward onto what's left of the islands
below.
We FOLLOW this ash as it settles next to a dead reptile,
unrecognizable now, and down onto what's left of the
lizard's eggs.
Suddenly the image clears from the grainy footage to
clean, modern high resolution. We ZOOM IN on one of the
eggs as it slowly gets buried in the falling ash. WE
continue to push in, getting closer...closer...

The doors BURST open as the crew and the Cook rush out
onto the deck. Again, the ship is HIT, ROCKING it
violently.
A TARP
is ripped away, revealing a life boat. Two more life
boats are revealed behind it as the crew desperately
tries to hoist them up and over the side.
ANGLE - WATER BESIDE THE TANKER
Something ENORMOUS jolts out of the water towards the
ship. Through the rainstorm it is hard to make out what
it is, but it SLAMS into the side of the ship, RIPPING
INTO IT, pulling down the starboard side as it does.
Could that have been a CLAW?
THE CREW
Are thrown backwards. The lifeboats swing WILDLY,
several of them SMASHING INTO BITS as they slam against
the ship.
THE CLAW
Or whatever it is, RIPS INTO THE SIDE AGAIN. This time
the entire ship begins to FLIP OVER.
A LIFEBOAT
Bounces off the deck and slides off the side. Following
it is the Cook.
Desperately, the Cook grabs onto the ship's side railing
to keep from falling off. He looks back and SEES
something so horrible that he SCREAMS IN TERROR and lets
go of the railing.
The old Cook slides over the side as the enormous tanker
FLIPS OVER.

WINDSHIELD WIPERS
Clearing at their highest speed, we see through the rain
doused windshield, DR. NIKO "NICK" TATOPOULOS. Music
blares from the tiny headphones of his Walkman.

With the infamously crippled nuclear power plant in the
distance, the utility van slides to a muddy stop by this
field of dirt.
Nick hops out quickly and rushes to the back of the van.
He opens the back of the van and grabs several metallic
cases.
Walking a few yards away from the van, he dumps the
cases on the ground, opening them to REVEAL an
assortment of sophisticated scientific equipment.
Taped to the inside are several photos of a girl we'll
meet later. Some of the photos are of her looking young
and beautiful. Others are of the two of them happily
together.
With a switch he turns on the equipment which comes to
life. Inside one of the cases are several cables
attached to long SPIKES. He grabs them and dashes away.
NICK
..."I'm laughing at clouds, so dark up
above..."
Nick rushes over to a small patch of land and begins to
SHOVE the spikes into the muddy earth.
NICK
..."The sun's in my heart and I'm
ready for love..."
Once firmly in the ground, he rushes back over to the
van and pops the hood.
CLOSE - VAN'S ENGINE
We SEE the steaming engine and a large electric car
BATTERY.
NICK
..."Let the cloudy skies chase..."
He attaches the cables to the battery and they SPARK!
Nick YELPS and jumps back. Shaking off the shock, he
rushes back over to the mud pit, dropping down to his
knees.
Suddenly, raising from the mud we see DOZENS OF
EARTHWORMS. Excitedly Tatopoulos grabs a big empty glass
jar and begins filling the jar with worms, happily in
his element.
NICK
..."I'm singin' in the mud, just
scooping up my worms..."
Unable to hear over his Walkman, he is oblivious as an
enormous RUSSIAN MILITARY HELICOPTER lands right behind
him.
From the intense wind kicked up by the helicopter,
Tatopoulos finally turns in time to see several RUSSIAN
OFFICERS coming toward him. Nick scrambles to his feet.
NICK
(broken Russian)
Good day. I am here with
permission...I have a, a...
(in English)
Permit. How do you say permit?
He goes through his pockets looking for his permits.
MALE VOICE (O.S.)
Dr. Nick Topopolosis?
Tatopoulos looks up as the Russian soldiers move past
him and over towards his cases of equipment. A man in a
long raincoat comes forward.
NICK
It's Tatopoulos.
TERRINGTON
The worm guy, right?
(extending his hand as he
approaches)
Kyle Terrington, U.S. State
Department.
The Russian soldiers close up his equipment and take it
off to the Helicopter.
NICK
What are they doing?
TERRINGTON
You've been reassigned.
NICK
You can't shut me down now! My
research here's not finished!
TERRINGTON
It is now.

A small sea plane flies over this jungle region of
Panama, darting up the Gulf into the lush greenery of
the countryside.

Slowly the plane begins to descend, landing by a small
village.

Several soldiers unload Nick's cargo as he steps out of
the plane onto the dock. As he walks towards shore he
SEES...
NICK'S P.O.V. - POLICE BARRICADE
Dozens of citizens as well as the press are gathered at
a police barricade; their access to the village denied.
Panamanian Police and U.S. military working together to
keep people out.
Marching up the shore to greet Nick is MAJOR TONY HICKS,
30's, efficient, who is spearheading this operation.
MAJOR HICKS
Dr. Niko Topopolosis?
NICK
(correcting)
It's Tatopoulos.
MAJOR HICKS
Right. The worm guy.
(to guards at blockade)
Can someone get those people off the
beach?
NICK
Excuse me, would you mind telling me
what the hell I'm doing here?
MAJOR HICKS
Follow me.
The Major leads Nick up the beach away from the crowds.
NICK
You didn't answer my question. In
fact, for the last 18 hours no one has
answered any of my questions.
MAJOR HICKS
We have a situation on our hands that
requires your particular expertise.
ANGLE - DESTROYED VILLAGE HUT
Several soldiers and researchers are investigating the
site when Nick and the Major walk past.
NICK
Look, I may work for the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission but accidents
and spills are not my field.
MAJOR HICKS
We know.
Major Hicks motions to some guards who clear a blockade
away from a jungle pathway. Major Hicks takes the
pathway.
NICK
Do you know that you just interrupted
a three year study of the Chernobyl
earthworm?
MAJOR HICKS
Yeah, you're the worm guy.
NICK
The radioactive contamination in that
area altered the earthworm's DNA! You
have any idea what that means?
MAJOR HICKS
No, but I have the feeling I'm about
to find out.
NICK
It means that due to a man made
accident the Chernobyl earthworms are
now over seventeen percent larger than
they were before. Mutated by seventeen
percent?
Major Hicks stops, turns to Nick.
MAJOR HICKS
(bemused)
Seventeen percent, huh? Sounds big.
NICK
They're enormous! A new species
created by man's recklessness. That's
what I've been trying to tell you, I'm
only a biologist. I take radioactive
samples and study them.
MAJOR HICKS
Then you're perfect.
(pointing to the ground)
Here's your radioactive sample. Study
it.
With that Major Hicks walks away.
NICK
What sample?
MAJOR HICKS
You're standing on it.
Nick looks down, sees nothing.
NICK
I don't see it.
(no response)
Where is it?
We CRANE UP above him, pulling back farther and farther,
until we SEE he's standing inside of a 15 YARD LONG
GIGANTIC FOOTPRINT in the sand.
NICK (CONT'D)
I don't see it!
Two scientists have spread out a tape measure to
document its length as two others inspect it with Geiger
counters. Nick sees them and realizes he's standing in a
remarkable discovery. He looks up ahead and SEES...
OVERHEAD TITLT SHOT - Foot steps...-
Five gigantic footsteps in front of him. Other
researchers examining the prints with all kinds of
equipment. Geiger counters, CLICK, CLICKING away. Nick
is stunned.
18

Nick rushes to catch up with Major Hicks who walks
towards a command tent in the distance.
NICK
(flabbergasted)
That was a footprint. I was standing
inside a footprint.
MAJOR HICKS
That's right.
NICK
But there's no animal in the world
that can make prints like that? Is
there?
MAJOR HICKS
We're hoping you're going to help us
figure that out.
The Major gestures to the many villagers who are being
attended to. Some are injured, others are being examined
for radiation. The village has been decimated.
NICK
Somebody must have seen it.
MAJOR HICKS
It happened so fast no one knew what
hit them 'til is was over.
A jeep pulls up and PETERS, a young researcher, comes
rushing over with a video tape in his hands. As he passes
Major Hicks...
PETERS
(on the run)
Tape's in. The French finally released
it.
Peters takes off for the command' tent. Nick and the
Major follow.
COMMAND TENT - CONTINUOUS - DAY
Part military, part scientific command post. Lots of
activity. Peters waves the tape as he rushes over to a
television. Major Hicks and Nick follow.
MAJOR HICKS
A tanker was attacked and sunk
yesterday near the French Polynesians.
We think there's a connection.
WOMAN SCIENTIST (ELSIE)
Is that the tape of the witness?
Excitedly, ELSIE CHAPMAN, heavy set, early 30's,
paleontologist and head of the research team, leads
several of her colleagues over to the t.v.
NICK
Hi. Nick Tatopoulos...
ELSIE
Ah, Elsie Chapman, paleontologist.
She's clearly attracted to him. This doesn't escape
Nick, who's not too comfortable with her flirtatious
glare. She turns to a scientist standing next to her,
DR. CLIVE CRAVEN.
ELSIE (CONT'D)
Dr. Craven, have you met the worm
guy?
DR. CRAVEN
Nice to meet you.
The t.v. turns on and we SEE the old Cook, rocking on
his bed, repeating over and over the same word...
OLD COOK
(filtered through t.v.)
...Gojira...Gojira...Gojira...
This is all too overwhelming for him. He turns from the
t.v. and looks out into the jungle.
Slowly he walks away, staring at something in the
distance with total awe. Elsie walks up next to him.
ELSIE
What could have possibly done all
that?
We REVERSE ANGLE and SEE what they are staring at.
A gigantic path cut through the jungle.
Something of immense size has trampled and cut a deep
and wide path right through the jungle forest that goes
on for miles on end. Over the stunned face of Nick we
HEAR...
OLD COOK (O.S.)

ARTHUR is at the wheel. Suddenly the engines WHINE as
the ship begins to slow down. Surprised, Arthur checks
his throttle.
25

LEONARD and his 1st MATE are puzzled by the engine WHINE
of their own ship.
LEONARD
Jerry, why are we slowing down?
JERRY (O.S.)
She's heavy in the bunt.
LEONARD
That was fast.

The captain, JULES, hasn't noticed a thing as he lays on
his deck tanning himself, a boom-abox blaring next to
him. Suddenly THUD. The ship JOLTS for a second. Jules
slides and BANGS his head into the boom-box. He yelps.
DECK HAND
The nets are full!
JULES
Then bring 'em in!
DECK HAND
We can't. She won't budge!
Jules gets up to move aft when THUD, again the ship
ROCKS.
ALL THREE BOATS SLOW TO A CRAWL
Arthur tries to GUN his engine but it only WHINES. Soon
all three boats STOP DEAD. Nothing but quiet for a long
beat.
ARTHUR
What is going on?
Then with another JOLT all three boats begin to move
BACKWARDS, DRAGGED BY THEIR OWN NETS!
LEONARD
She's going sternway!
FIRST MATE
What the hell did we catch?
The three boats begin to PICK UP SPEED, moving BACKWARDS
in the water. Water SPLASHES up into the boats, winches
begin to CRACK under the building pressure.
The boats begin to move incredibly FAST backwards.
Things on the boat begin to BREAK and CRASH DOWN onto
the decks of the ships.
JULES
Cut us free! Cut the nets!
The same cry is heard on all three boats. Leonard grabs
an AXE and starts HACKING AWAY at the tow lines.
Jules and his deck hands do the same. WIRE SHEERS are
brought out for the larger CABLES connected to the nets.
Desperately they try and free themselves as their boats
are dragged helplessly backwards.
ARTHUR
(screaming at his men)
Cut the damned cables!
A CABLE SNAPS!
Jules falls backward as the cables and ropes are either
cut or snapped from the pressure. Their boat stops.
ANOTHER CABLE SNAPS!
Leonard and his crew TUMBLE to the deck as their boat is
freed.
THE HARPO
Is not so fortunate. The lone boat dragged backwards,
faster now without the weight of the other boats. Then
suddenly the aft of the boat begins to get PULLED DOWN,
dipping into the water.
With an unstoppable force the Harpo gets PULLED UNDER
WATER. Deck hands LEAP off the boat as the top cabin is
CRUSHED as the entire ship slowly DISAPPEARS BENEATH THE
SEA.
For a moment all is quiet. No one can believe what just
happened. Hearts pounding, catching their breath.
Then with a WHOOSH of air pressure, the Harpo BURSTS out
of the water. With a gigantic SPLASH, the boat FLOPS on
its side and capsizes. The waters calm, but the nerves
of Jules and Leonard don't.

MOUTH OF THE EAST RIVER
Enormous turbulence in the water. Slowly something
begins to LIFT, sheets of water fall. Bursting out, the
backside TALONS of the enormous reptile pierce through.
The TAIL slices through the turbulence.
Two ships anchored at dock begin to LIFT UPWARDS as the
beast below them begins to rise.
ANGLE FISH MARKET
A groaning WAIL ROARS, echoing. The people of the fish
market turn just in time to see...

With a large RE-ELECT MAYOR FAUSTINO poster behind him,
the MAYOR is at the podium. Before him is a sea of
umbrellas.
MAYOR
I'd like to thank you all for coming
out on this beautiful New York City
day.
Some in the crowd laugh as others applaud. Lost in the
sounds of the crowd we HEAR a soft THUMPING in the
distance.
MAYOR
When I came into office four years
ago, people didn't think we could
reduce crime and I did.
ANGLE - COP IN BACK OF CROWD
leaning to the cop next to him.
COP
(sarcastic)
Yeah, he did.
MAYOR
People didn't think I could restore
order...
This time the THUMPING is HEARD, growing much louder.
MAYOR
...and I did. The city is a safer
place today...
Before he can continue the crowd begins to murmur with
fear as the THUMPING grows LOUDER and CLOSER. Suddenly
with a large CRASHING SOUND a building nearby begins to
CRUMBLE.
MAYOR
(to his aides)
What the hell....
People SCRAMBLE to get out of the way as DEBRIS from the
falling BUILDING litters the area. The Mayor is pulled
inside by his security men.
Bursting out of the crumbling corner of the building we
SEE the enormous LEG of the reptile as it KICKS debris
out of its way.
SIDE ANGLE - WALL STREET - FAST TRAVELING SHOT
Several cars are SQUASHED quickly as the enormous FEET
of the beast STOMPS through the street. Cars FLATTEN and
SCATTER, flipping toward us, from the weight of the
beast. We try to keep up with it, but it's too fast.
After it passes, the Mayor sticks his head out of the
doorway to see the demolished street scene.
MAYOR
What was that?
34

Animal comes rushing out. Water sprays from displaced
fire hydrants, debris still falls, cars burn. Animal
goes over to his NEWS VAN that has been partially
crushed.
He pries open the rear door and takes out his video
camera and takes off running. Audrey and Lucy arrive too
late to stop him.
LUCY
Victor, don't!
ANIMAL RUNNING
Turning the corner Animal runs full speed through the
debris, trying to jam a video cassette into his camera.
It won't fit. He SEES up ahead...
P.O.V. THE TAIL
Just as it disappears around the corner a few blocks
ahead. Thinking quickly, Animal bolts down a small
alleyway.
37

His camera damaged, Animal struggles to get the tape
inside as he exits the other side of the alley. He darts
out into the street to get his shot.
The THUMPING is OVERPOWERINGLY LOUD. He looks up to see,
CARS FLIPPING, PEOPLE SCATTERING.
Then, for the first time, we can clearly see the entire
massive creature that is...
GODZILLA
as he comes barreling towards us. The titanic lizard is
ferocious and agile. Swiftly he moves closer.
Animal's hands fumble with the tape. He JAMS it in,
sweating. He fingers the POWER BUTTON, the red light
goes on. Quickly he shoulders the camera.
P.O.V. THROUGH CAMERA - GODZILLA
Nearly on top of him, Godzilla's own image is suddenly
covered by his own immense foot as it's lifted and about
to come down directly on us.
ANIMAL
Oh shit!
Before he can do anything about it...
GODZILLA'S FOOT
Towering above him. He has no time to flinch as the
gargantuan foot SMASHES DOWN.
In terrifying amazement, Animal remains standing IN
BETWEEN THE BEAST'S TOES. Abruptly the foot LIFTS
again. Animal is unscathed and frozen with fear.

Close on Animal as the endless TAIL of the creature
DRAGS just past him. It seems to go on forever. Finally

SERGEANT
They've agreed to evacuate the city.
They've called out the National Guard

As they walk towards the tents the crowd crushes close.
Nick and Elsie are overwhelmed.

With that he gently pats the Mayor on the back, leaving
a small, nearly undetectable DEVICE on the Mayor's
collar.
RAYMOND
You can count on our emotional and

Everyone is waiting. The silence is deafening.
ANGLE - NICK
As everyone waits, Nick scans the area, thinking.
Suddenly something catches his eye...
STEAM VENT
Through a steam vent in the streets. Nick sees STEAM
lifting into the air. He notices several other vents
doing the same thing around the square. Quickly Nick
rushes over to a YOUNG OFFICER.
NICK
I need your radio.
The Young Officer leads Nick over to his jeep. Nick
grabs the receiver.
NICK
Sergeant O'Neal, the subway vents. We
have to shut them down...
75
75
O'Neal listens to Nick on his radio.
NICK (O.S.)
(filtered)
...With the air pressure pushing up,
he'll never smell the bait!
SERGEANT O'NEAL
(turning to soldier)
Get some men down into those air
vents. Shut 'em down!
76
77
One by one the steam pillars begin to disappear as the
vents are turned off. There is a long tense moment of
waiting. When will it come? Will it come?
Before the Young Officer can stop him, Nick rushes over
to a manhole cover in the center of the street. The
cover is to heavy. He yells back.
NICK
We need to open all the manhole covers
in the area. Let the scent waft down.
The Young Officer signals other soldiers. Nick steps
back and lets the soldiers go to work. As he walks back,
he spots another manhole cover at the next intersection
down a side street. He runs over to it.
ANGLE - SIDE STREET - MANHOLE COVER
A particularly heavy one in the center of this
intersection (a block away from Flat Iron Square), Nick,
alone, wrestles to remove it. With all his might, he
drags it clear.
Suddenly, through the hole he HEARS some STRANGE NOISES
from below. Rattled, he slowly backs away from the hole.
The NOISES grow increasingly louder.
Then with a DEAFENING ROAR, the ground behind Nick
ERUPTS and GODZILLA RISES, ripping up the boulevard as
he does.
Nick SPINS only to find himself face to face with the
gigantic creature. Godzilla's head slopes down,
apparently looking Nick in the eye.
All around foot soldiers appear, guns trained, shoulder
hoisted rocket launchers prepared.
Out of the corner of his eye, Nick sees all this. He
gently signals with his hands that they should NOT fire.
Sensing no danger from Nick, Godzilla simply STEPS OVER
Nick.
NICK'S POV - UNDER GODZILLA
As the gargantuan creature walks over us, making a
beeline for the fish.
Nick turns and RUNS, following him.
78
78
Godzilla moves into the square. The military hunkers
down, ready to strike. Cautiously the beast moves over
to the mountain of fish.
79
80
Everyone on the rooftop puts on their GAS MASKS.
SERGEANT O'NEAL
Let 'em fly!
ANGLE - STREET LEVEL - SAME
All the soldiers PUT ON their GAS MASKS. A team of
EIGHT, pull out a GAS CANISTERS and yank the releases.
They DROP them down the long barrels of air cannons,
preparing to fire.
SAND BAG FORTIFICATION - SAME
Nick runs past the fortification, trying to get a closer
look. The Young Officer yells after him.
YOUNG OFFICER
Where're you going? Nick!
Nick stops briefly as the Young Officer TOSSES a gas
mask to Nick who quickly puts it on and dashes for a
closer spot. Suddenly SAILING OVER HIS HEAD we SEE...
GAS CANISTERS
Firing from the air cannons, the GAS CANISTERS streak
across the sky landing behind Godzilla. The Yellow gas
forms a wall of smoke that drifts upwards.
ANOTHER ANGLE - OPPOSITE CORNER
Across the way eight MORE CANISTERS are FIRED at the
beast. Quickly Godzilla is surrounded by the gas fumes.
ANGLE - NICK
Frustrated at his inability to see through the smoke, he
DASHES forward over to a large BRONZE STATUE.
GODZILLA
The smoke annoying and distracting him, Godzilla spins,
his tail waving the smoke away. But the smoke returns.
Godzilla YELLS OUT. Frustrated he rears back and
BLASTS!
For the first time we SEE the infamous POWER BREATH of
Godzilla. With amazing FORCE the smoke, canisters, cars
and anything that isn't nailed down SAILS BACKWARDS from
the intense pressure.
Nick is HIT by the WAVE of air pressure and is sent
FLYING BACKWARDS, impossibly high in the air.
An enormous fabric BANNER advertising this season at the
MET, catches Nick who SLIDES down the banner, hitting
the ground, HARD. Just as he looks up he SEES...
A LARGE TRUCK
Tumbling toward him from the power breath. Nick
SCRAMBLES to his feet just in time as the rolling Truck
SMASHES into the building behind where he just sat.
ANGLE - TROOPS - FORTIFICATION
The troops have to SCATTER as the tumbling trucks and
cars are FLUNG AT THEM, disabling their attack forces.
Trucks and rocket launches are CRUSHED by the tumbling
debris.
Godzilla CONTINUES to BLOW at everything around him.
Cars and trucks ROLLING. Soldiers DIVING for cover. It's
chaos.
The glass in all the surrounding buildings SHATTER,
shards of glass raining down. Windows, street lamps, all
blown out by the tremendous gale force winds.
81
82
SERGEANT O'NEAL
Fire at will. Fire at will.
83
83
From all angles, soldiers rush back to their equipment
and attempt to FIRE. Very few are able to get off
rounds.
84
84
O'Neal tries to steady himself as the soldiers FIRE down
at the creature below. One HOISTS a MISSILE launcher.
ANGLE - GODZILLA - NIGHT
As the FIREPOWER begins around Godzilla, he takes a hit
in the shoulder and SCREAMS OUT. Suddenly he LEAPS away
just as several MISSLES HIT the Flat Iron Building
behind where Godzilla was standing only moments
earlier.
Dashing down a side street, Godzilla LEAPS over the
waiting tanks who cannot adjust their cannons in time.
WE'VE NEVER SEEM HIM MOVE THIS QUICKLY. Several tanks
are SQUASHED as the beast bull dozes right through the
regiment.
85
86
Soldiers come out from behind the crashed vehicles and
debris. Only the smoldering devastation is left behind.
87
88
Quickly his men are packing up.
SERGEANT O'NEAL
(into radio)
He's gone, Sir. Echo division's in
pursuit.
89
89
Four ARMORED MILITARY VEHICLES come SKIDDING around the
corner in hot pursuit. Each with a team manning enormous
mounted weaponry.
REVERSE ANGLE - 6TH AVE. - GODZILLA
Galloping like a Gisele uptown, Godzilla is SPEEDING up
the boulevard. The armored vehicles OPEN FIRE. Some
shots CLIP into Godzilla's back. Ahead he is running
directly into...
MOBILE MISSILE LAUNCHERS
Blocking off the street in front of him. They FIRE.
Pinned down, the creature SCREAMS and DUCKS away down
another side street. The missiles can't turn fast enough
and SLAM into a building, DEMOLISHING it.
90
90
The window is SMASHED in. A small group of LOOTERS are
loading up their mini-van. Finishing up the group is
about to leave.
LOOTER #1
Jimmy, let's go.
LOOTER #2
Wait. I want this. Help me!
The group rejoins Jimmy as they try to pull an enormous
Pin Ball machine from the window. As they carry the
machine back towards the mini-van...
SQUASH! - GIGANTIC FOOT
Godzilla's enormous foot flattens the mini-van like a
pancake. The Looters go pale. As the Military Armored
Vehicles RACE by in hot pursuit.
91
91
Godzilla BOUNDS onto Broadway and FREEZES, looking
around. As he looks downtown he SEES...
GODZILLA'S P.O.V. - MILITARY ARMORED VEHICLES
Skidding around the corner a few blocks back, the
armored vehicles reappear.
Godzilla turns uptown and BOLTS. As he gets up to full
speed...
COBRA HELICOPTERS
A team of FOUR COBRA HELICOPTERS swoops down heading
directly for Godzilla.
92
93
Godzilla runs into the famous lighted square (looking
remarkably like Tokyo) just as the COBRA'S come SWEEPING
DOWN out of the sky.
Godzilla SPOTS them and leaps away just as they FIRE
missiles, which RIP INTO the famous JUMBO TRON VIDEO
BILLBOARD, demolishing the building.
The Cobra's SWERVE quickly, pursuing Godzilla down a
side street.
94
94
Godzilla appears, turning the corner and racing down the
street. From behind, the Cobra helicopters come
SCREAMING down on him, they FIRE ROCKETS at Godzilla
who, again, deftly turns a corner.
The errant rockets BLAST into the CHRYSLER BUILDING, as
they attempt to follow him but fail. Shards of glass come
RAINING DOWN as the building crumbles.
ANGLE - ARMORED VEHICLES
As they race around the corner they SLAM ON THE BREAKS
just as the familier CONE of the Chrysler building comes
CRASHING DOWN just inches in front of the vehicles,
tumbling into the street.
95
96
Moving through the narrow side street.
HELICOPTER PILOT (O.S.)
The heat seekers can't lock. He's
colder than the buildings around him.
97
97
The four Cobra helicopters ZOOM around the corner and
into 5th avenue.
COBRA HELICOPTER P.O.V. - GODZILLA
Godzilla is ahead of us. The choppers FIRE again, this
time using their gun turrets, ACCELERATING toward the
beast.
Under heavy bullet firepower and the choppers nearly on
top of him, Godzilla DIVES into an office building.
The helicopters surround the crumbling building, and
OPEN FIRE, decimating it. They STOP firing and stare
into the smoldering mess they've made.
PILOT
I think we got him.
Just then ERUPTING out of a building behind them...
GODZILLA
POUNCES OUT of the building, snapping up two of the
helicopters in one bite!
He WHIRLS around and SWIPES another out of the air with
his ENORMOUS CLAW. The CLAWED helicopter SLAMS into the
ground just as...
ARMORED VEHICLES
come sliding around the corner, directly into the
CRASHING HELICOPTER which explodes on impact. The entire
team is taken out with the concussion.
98
99
As the remaining Cobra helicopter SWERVES around,
Godzilla is gone.
HELICOPTER PILOT #4
I don't know sir. He just vanished.
As the helicopter PASSES a dark building we SEE a SHAPE
MOVE! We realize that like a chameleon, Godzilla had
TAKEN THE COLOR of the building and hid. With the
helicopter past him, he CHASES FROM THE REAR.
HELICOPTER PILOT #4
(realizing)
Oh Jesus!
The chopper GUNS IT, full throttle. Godzilla GIVES
CHASE. Even at its top speed it can't out run the big
creature.
The chopper tries to LIFT AWAY but before he can get the
height, Godzilla SNAPS his gigantic jaws and SWALLOWS
THE HELICOPTER WHOLE.
STREET - WIDE ANGLE
The fires burn and the rubble crumbles. Godzilla gives
one final SCREAM and DIVES into a building,
disappearing.
100
101
Empty and devastated. Fires continue to burn.
102
102
Nick, Sergeant O'Neal and several of his men walk
through the devastated area. Nick kneels down and
SEES...
NICK'S P.O.V. - PUDDLE OF BLOOD
There is a large reddish brown puddle of blood. Nick
takes out a small glass container and scoops some up.
SERGEANT O'NEAL
I can't believe it. He did all this
and we did nothing to him.
Nick walks over to him, consoling.
NICK
That's not true. We fed him.
REVERSE ANGLE
Only a few scattered fish remain where the mountain of
fish once was. Our team stands there amidst the rubble.
FADE OUT:
FADE IN:
103
105
We continue to FOLLOW the assistant outside, revealing
the enormous MOB of reporters that have gathered just
outside the military command tents. As we FOLLOW the
assistant he passes several reporters doing "stand-up"
reports.
REPORTER #1
...rumors continue to mount as to the
origin of this, perhaps, lost
dinosaur...
REPORTER #2
...having shut down the United Nations
in the evacuation, foreign diplomats
are demanding an international
coalition be assembled to track the
creature...
The assistant finally arrives at Caiman who is doing a
live remote. Animal works the camera.
CAIMAN
...Maintaining a total media blackout,
officials remain silent this evening
as to their progress in containing
this creature...
Behind him, in the crowd we SEE Audrey pushing her way
through the reporters, her fake ID pinned on her shirt.
She turns and sees Caiman. Quickly she ducks down and
moves deeper into the crowds.
Suddenly there is movement as the crowd turns their
collective attention over to a group of cars pulling up
nearby. Audrey pushes her way to see what's happening.
The cars are BLOCKED from returning to the command tents
as the reporters MOB the first car in line.
106
108
Nick opens the door for Audrey and follows her out.
AUDREY
So, you still picking apart
cockroaches?
NICK
No, I'm into earthworms now. You
wouldn't be interested. They're real
"boring" creatures. Very reliable,
dependable, no surprises...
AUDREY
You're still mad at me, aren't you?
NICK
You just left me without a phone call,
a letter, nothing. All this time.
Yeah, I guess I'm still a little mad.
AUDREY
That was eight years ago. Some people
change, you know.
NICK
Most people don't.
AUDREY
I'm sorry you feel that way.
Audrey turns and walks away. Nick regrets his behavior
and calls after her.
NICK
Wait. I'm sorry. You're right. Eight
years is a long time. Can I offer you
a cup of tea?
AUDREY
Sure. I'd like that.
There's an awkward moment as neither knows what to say.
AUDREY
One, thing, though. Who'd you get
pregnant?
Off Nick's awkward reaction...
CUT TO:
109
111
Rushing out of the WNEW truck and into the rain, Audrey
spots her Station Manager, Murray. In the b.g. we SEE
Caiman getting make up, about to do a live spot with
another cameraman.
AUDREY
Murray, I need you to look at this
tape.
MURRAY
Not now, Audrey, we've about to go
live with the morning report.
AUDREY
You're going to want to include this.
I've got exclusive footage of other
places this thing has attacked.
MURRAY
(suddenly interested)
You do? Who's story is this?
AUDREY
Mine!
ANGLE - CAIMAN
About to go on, Caiman waves off his make up artist as
he watches Audrey hand Murray the tape. His field
producer counts down to going live.
P.O.V. THROUGH BINOCULARS - NICK - RAIN - MORNING
Through the lenses we SEE exiting his tent and moving on
towards the large center command tent. We REVERSE to
reveal...
112
117
Audrey is furious, on her feet.
AUDREY
You're special report! I'm the one
that found that stupid song! That's my
special report, you bastard!
Animal tries to calm her down as the story continues.
AUDREY
And it's "Gojira" not Godzilla you
moron!
118
124
Lifting a heavy case, Nick places it into the cab's
trunk.
CABBY
Where to?
NICK
Newark airport.
Audrey moves up behind Nick.
AUDREY
You're leaving? Why?
Nick ignores her and continues to load the cab.
AUDREY
Is this cause of me? Because of the
story?
NICK
Well what the hell did you think was
going to happen?
AUDREY
You never said it was off the record.
NICK
I shouldn't have to, Audrey. You're
supposed to be my friend. I trusted
you.
AUDREY
I didn't mean for it to turn out like
this.
(confessing)
Look, I lied to you. I'm not a
reporter. When we broke up and I came
out to New York I was so sure I'd make
it. But I haven't. That's why I needed
this story so bad. I just couldn't
tell you I'm a failure.
NICK
So you thought that made it okay to
steal my tapes?
The last bag stowed, Nick moves to get into the cab. He
stops and turns back to her.
NICK
Good luck in your new career. I think
you really have what it takes.
He gets in and slams the door. The cab takes off leaving
a very alone Audrey standing in the rain.
AUDREY
(sad; to herself)
I'm sorry.
CUT TO:
125
126
A makeshift tent city has been set up in the park.
Animal video tapes an interview with a displaced
person.
DISPLACED PERSON
No one tells us a Goddamned thing. My
family is getting soaked out here. We
have no place else to go. We just want
to go back to our home.
Animal begins to PAN his camera around the tent city
when he SEES a SEDAN in the distance. He focus in on it
and SEES...
ANIMAL'S P.O.V. - SEDAN - NICK AND RAYMOND
Coming to stop at a light. Animal quickly lowers his
camera and hands it off to the Reporter he's working
with.
ANIMAL
I'll be right back.
Animal rushes over to the news van and takes off after
them, following.
127
127
Pulling up in front of a warehouse, Nick and Raymond
step out of the sedan. Staying hidden from view, Animal
pulls over. Intrigued, he watches them enter the
building.
128
129
Moving down alongside the building, Animal walks down
the side alley. He climbs up onto a garbage hamper and
peers into a cracked opened window.
ANIMAL'S P.O.V. - WAREHOUSE
Animal sees Nick and Raymond with all the hardware.
Several of the men are repainting the vehicles to
resemble those of the US Army.
130
135
An armed blockage seals the Jersey entrance to the
Lincoln tunnel. We widen to reveal Audrey and Animal by
a small side entrance. Animal works the lock.
AUDREY
What are you doing?
ANIMAL
It's the maintenance entrance. Runs
along the side of the tunnel. When
they repaired it last year I worked on
a piece about it.
Just then the lock TURNS and the door opens. They
enter.
136
136
A line of military vehicles approaches and slowly passes
through a guarded entrance, each vehicle checked. Nick
and Raymond's Humvee nears.
ANGLE - GUARDED BLOCKADE - CONTINUOUS
Raymond's Humvee rolls up and a GUARD walks up to the
window.
GUARD
(checking clipboard)
Who you boys with?
NICK
Oh, we're with the three two.
GUARD
I didn't ask you, soldier.
NICK
Sergeant O'Neal just called down for
us to join in.
Now he's suspicious. The guard approaches Raymond, checks
him out.
GUARD
You got a problem talkin'?
RAYMOND
(perfect southern accent)
Why no sir, I'm fine.
The Guard is suspicious but on a tight schedule. Finally
he waves him through.
GUARD
All right, keep it moving.
RAYMOND
(ala Presley)
Thank you very much.
They drive off. Nick is stunned by the act.
RAYMOND
Elvis Presley movies.
(by way of explanation)
He was the King!
137
139
The enormous pile of fish is getting dumped in the
center of the field as many others are planting land
mines. Tanks, rockets and soldiers align the area.
The convoy of vehicles turn onto the meadow but Raymond
and his men keep going straight. They drive slowly right
past the trap sight and out of the park.
TIRES SQUEALING TO A STOP
Doors slam and immediately boots march past. We WIDEN to
reveal Raymond's team quickly gathering their gear and
heading down the subway entrance.
Raymond grabs a heavy bag and tosses it to Nick who
nearly topples from the weight.
RAYMOND
Be careful with that.
Nick looks into the bag and sees a bag marked
EXPLOSIVES. Shocked he looks back at Raymond, but he's
gone. Nick regains his breath and follows.
THE FISH
Older and nastier, but the same fish we saw in the
tunnel before. We FOLLOW the beam to its owner and find
Nick. We WIDEN to reveal that we're....
140
141
Animal and Audrey arrive, spotting the assault team's
vehicles. They head carefully down the stairs.
142
148
From the rooftop of one of the central park south high
rises, a team of SPOTTERS scan the area.
SPOTTER P.O.V. - THROUGH BINOCULARS - GODZILLA
Moving steadily towards central park, Godzilla makes his
way up seventh avenue.
SPOTTER
Got him. Section 5, heading north to
target.
149
149
The Sergeant gives the nod and several teams of shooters
take off running, taking positions. The tanks turn their
gun turrets towards downtown, expectantly. Missile
launchers turn, arming devices locked.
150
151
Godzilla moves up 7th Ave. He reaches Central Park South
and STOPS. He glances over to the park where bright
lights are glaring.
Something is making Godzilla more cautious this time.
Unsure he vacillates between moving forward and staying
within the shelter of the tall buildings.
ANGLE - O'NEAL - CENTRAL PARK
SERGEANT O'NEAL
(into radio)
Don't fire until he's cleared the
buildings and has moved into the
park.
ANGLE - GODZILLA
Still unsure, he ROARS out, frustrated with his own
indecision.
SERGEANT O'NEAL
Come on, come on!
152
154
NIGHT
Climbing the stairs out from the subway, Nick et all
walk up onto the street to SEE...
MADISON SQUARE GARDEN
The team cautiously approaches the building.
155
155
Carefully moving out from between the buildings Godzilla
takes a step into Central Park.
SERGEANT O'NEAL
(into radio)
Prepare to fire!
Guns are cocked, locked on and hoisted. Suddenly
Godzilla gets cold feet and starts to turn around.
156
157
SERGEANT O'NEAL
Fire at will! Fire at will!
All the weapons surround the area FIRE AT ONCE. Several
more Cobra Helicopters ZOOM DOWN out of nowhere.
Plunging downward, they FIRE at Godzilla.
The firepower ripping up everything around him, Godzilla
ROARS and deftly DIVES out of the park and back between
the buildings.
But as he bounds over to 57th street, there is a
contingency of MOBILE ROCKET LAUNCHERS waiting. They
FIRE. Godzilla DODGES and the rockets DESTROY PLANET
HOLLYWOOD as Godzilla races by.
With the helicopters right on his tail, Godzilla makes a
westward run across 57th street. Smashing parked
vehicles and his tail SWIPING buildings as it DASHES.
WEST SIDE HIGHWAY
Godzilla is heading straight for it, the helicopters
SHOOTING from the air. Suddenly Godzilla LEAPS higher
than we've seen before. He hurls himself OVER the West
Side Highway and SPLASHES DOWN into the Hudson River,
vanishing beneath the water's surface.
158
168
The Arizona races past us.
169
170
He swims at enormous speed heading directly at the
Arizona.
171
172
The torpedo is FIRED and comes darting directly at
Godzilla who abruptly SWERVES. The torpedo, however,
FOLLOWS him.
ANGLE - SUBMARINE - CALVIN COOLIDGE
From the other direction, closing in. Godzilla DIVES,
skidding close to the bottom. The TORPEDO begins to
close the gap.
Suddenly Godzilla SHOOTS UPWARDS heading directly for
the underside of the Calvin Coolidge.
173
174
Godzilla RAMS the underside of the Calvin Coolidge
before she can turn. The entire sub SPINS, TWISTING OVER
its side and colliding directly with...
THE TORPEDO
slams into the side of the rolling and dented nuclear
submarine. With a CONCUSSION the sub EXPLODES.
175
175
An enormous SPRAY OF WATER erupts from the river,
bubbles and debris float to the surface.
176
178
Godzilla attempts to make his way back to the shore. The
Indiana and Arizona close in on either side.
179
180
Boxed in from either side, Godzilla RACES through the
water. At the same moment both submarines FIRE their
torpedoes.
Godzilla reaches the underwater shoreline of Manhattan
and begins BURROWING FURIOUSLY. As his gigantic claws
start DIGGING up earth, an enormous TURBULENCE of clouds
and dirt cloud the waters around him, cloaking him.
181
183
The torpedoes ENTER into frame and disappear into this
undersea dust cloud. An enormous EXPLOSION BLASTS from
its center, waves of concussion reverberate.
184
184
With the EXPLOSION and enormous TIDAL WAVE rises and
CRASHES DOWN over battery park with tremendous impact.
Parked cars and phone booths are washed away.
185
187
Toppling down out of the murky turbulence, we SEE
Godzilla falling away from the shoreline, backwards the
ocean floor, drifting down to the bottom of the Hudson
river like so many cement shoed gangsters.
188
194
A large and ANGRY mob has gathered at the roadblock to
the bridge. People, their cars packed with belongings,
are screaming to be let back into Manhattan. Horns honk
and the blockade guards are getting nervous.
195
223
Several F-18's prepare to take flight. We focus on one,
an enormous bomb attached under its wing. The F-18 taxis
away from us.
224
229
We FOLLOW the squadron as they pass us to reveal the
beautiful MANHATTAN SKYLINE approaching.
230
232
Closing over the city, the lead bomber breaks formation,
flying lower, closer to the rooftops.
233
236
The immense BOMB drops and takes flight on its own. We
can see it's heading directly for MADISON SQUARE
GARDEN.
237
237
Raymond exits and Animal shuts the door behind him. The
Babyzillas SLAM against the doors. It takes all of
Animal's and Raymond's strength to hold the doors
closed.
Raymond slides his rifle barrel between the handles as a
temporary lock. He pulls Animal away and they take off
running.
BOMB'S P.O.V. - MADISON SQUARE - NIGHT
Rapidly approaching the famous forum.
ANGLE - RAYMOND, ANIMAL
Not far behind Nick and Audrey as they race from the
building. Behind them we SEE...
BOMB AND BUILDING
Collide and an ENORMOUS EXPLOSION ERUPTS, engulfing the
entire building in a mountain of flame.
Raymond, Animal, Audrey and Nick are THROWN several feet
forwards, toppling to the ground from the incredible
impact.
As the building CRUMBLES in FLAMES we HEAR several of
the Babyzillas SCREAMING. Soon they are silenced.
Slowly Nick sits up and turns to Audrey. They're both
shaken up. Nick touches her cheek gently.
NICK
Are you okay?
AUDREY
Somehow I never thought your life was
this exciting.
NICK
You'd be surprised.
AUDREY
Really? I'd like to find out.
She hugs him tightly. Nick smiles. Animal turns to
Raymond who has cut above his eye.
ANIMAL
Hey Man, you all right?
RAYMOND
I could use a coffee.
We begins to pull away from this tableau, slowly lifting
upwards when suddenly...
THAT FAMOUS WAIL
Is heard! Then, violently BURSTING up through the ashes,
a very angry GODZILLA emerges!
Bleeding from his injuries, Godzilla leans down and
nuzzles the burned out remains of his young. For the
first time in the film we can SEE a partial expression
of Godzilla's face; pain.
But quickly that pain turns to burning anger as he
focuses his hatred downwards, staring directly, and
accusingly, at our heroes.
NICK
Ohhhhhhhh.....shit.
ANIMAL
What do we do?
RAYMOND
Running would be a good idea.
And they do just as Godzilla POUNCES. Fortunately our
team DARTS around a corner just in time.
238
238
As our heroes come rushing around a corner, Godzilla
BURSTS THROUGH the building in front of them, sealing
off their exit. Raymond notices a very narrow alley.
ANGLE - ALLEY WAY
Raymond leads them through this slim alley between to
large brick buildings. They run for their lives as
Godzilla appears behind them.
His claws are too big to reach into the alley so he
BULLDOZES his way into it, the building ripping apart as
he marches forward.
Bricks go FLYING as debris showers down on our team just
they make their way to the other side.
Slowed down by the the position of the alley, Godzilla
SWINGS his arms violently to clear a path.
239
239
Racing from the alley Raymond races over to a parked
YELLOW CAB.
240
241
Just as GODZILLA bursts out from between the buildings
the CAB DARTS away, squealing around the next corner.
242
242
Power sliding around the wet street corner, the Yellow
Cab FISHTAILS onto 8th Ave. Whipping around the corner
behind them Godzilla appears.
As he's MUCH faster, he nearly overtakes the car in a
single LEAP but the cab SWERVES AGAIN moving down
another street.
243
243
The cab darts onto 27th street. DEBRIS tumbles down in
their path as GODZILLA SMASHES through another
building.
244
245
Using this small cut-across, the cab quickly exits out
onto the next main street (28th). Godzilla rushes down
the side street, his TAIL shattering buildings as he
does.
246
247
LEAPING forward, Godzilla BITES down, SNAPPING at the cab
as it SWERVES just out of danger, gunning it.
248
249
Taking her advice, Raymond swerves up 8th Ave. uptown.
He GUNS IT and RACES up ahead.

The last two turns of the cab have temporarily
disoriented Godzilla who looks around to find the cab.
He moves up a block and begins to look around.
GODZILLA'S P.O.V. - CAB - SAME - NIGHT
Several blocks ahead, Godzilla spots the cab. He narrows
his eyes and WAILS ANGRILY. Suddenly he BOLTS after the
cab.
251
252
The military is cleaning up the trap from before.
Sergeant O'Neal SPINS as the cab LEAPS out from behind
the trees.
SERGEANT O'NEAL
What the hell....?
The cab POWER SLIDES right past and out of the Meadow
again just as GODZILLA STOMPS directly into the clean up
crew. Soldiers DIVE for cover as others scramble out of
the way.
Godzilla MARCHES after the cab, his tail SWIPING several
vehicles which tumble, crashing into the troops.
In a flash, Godzilla disappears back into the forest on
the other side. O'Neal grabs his radio.
SERGEANT O'NEAL
Command, Command, this Sergeant
O'Neal. He's back!
253
254
The cab heads up the deserted streets, racing full
tilt.
255
256
Wrong again! Leaping out several blocks ahead, GODZILLA
emerges. He KNEELS DOWN and gives a gigantic POWER BLAST
of his BREATH.
Cars, street signs, vending machines SAIL BACKWARDS from
the force.
A Newspaper vending machine SLAMS into the hood of the
cab as the cab SQUEALS around a corner, avoiding the
rest of the onslaught of debris.
257
257
The F-18's BANK and head back towards Manhattan.
258
258
Racing up through the streets of Harlem we SEE the cab.
259
260
Godzilla quickly makes up ground. Running at the cab
it's only a matter of seconds before he'll reach them.
261
262
The cab SWERVES heading towards the bridge entrance just
as Godzilla BITES DOWN, barely missing the cab as it
turns the corner.
Godzilla LEAPS OVER THE ENTIRE BLOCK, landing directly
IN FRONT OF THE CAB.
The cab SPINS, pulling a full 180 degree turn, and PEELS
OUT just before Godzilla can SNAP DOWN again, just
missing the cab.
The cab PEELS around the creature and UP THE ONRAMP.
Just then Godzilla LEAPS AFTER THEM. His jaw open, he
BITES DOWN ON THE CAB.
263
264
Taking a gigantic BITE out of the highway, some high
tension wires and the support structure over the bridge,
Godzilla CHOMPS DOWN on the cab.
The large cement SIGN SLAMS into the roof of the
creature's mouth, preventing him from crushing the cab
with his teeth.
265
267
Like a dog with a bone, Godzilla SHAKES his head trying
to rip the rest of the highway free. The portion of
highway in front of the cab TEARS FREE, lifting.
268
265
He temporarily opens his mouth wider with a scream just
before he is about to SLAM his jaws shut again...
C.U. TIRES - SUDDENLY CATCHING
As the tongue momentarily retreats from the SHOCK, the
wheels CATCH and the CAB LURCHES FORWARD.
270
270
As the sign CRUMBLES and the JAWS CRUSH DOWN, the cab
SAILS OUT OF HIS MOUTH as the beast SWALLOWS the piece
of highway.
Landing, hard, onto the pavement, the cab PEELS OUT,
burning rubber as it enters the George Washington
Bridge.
Godzilla SWALLOWS only to realize he didn't get them.
Seeing the cab on the bridge Godzilla gives chase.
271
271
The cab races towards us when Godzilla STEPS ONTO THE
BRIDGE. His enormous weight makes the entire bridge
WOBBLE.
The Cab goes airborne then bottoms out as it returns to
the asphalt as the bridge undulates beneath them. It's
as though they were driving during an earthquake.
With each stride Godzilla takes, the bridge becomes more
unstable.
272
272
Swooping down the F-18's head directly towards the
bridge. We see Godzilla about to overtake the Cab.
273
274
Only a stride away from being overtaken.
275
276
Where the blockade and angry mob still wait and watch in
horror. The Cab SLIDES INTO A SPIN as it comes to a stop
just in front of the crowd.
Nick jumps out first, staring back at Godzilla. Audrey
comes up from behind.
NICK'S P.O.V. - GODZILLA
His eyes rolling back into his head as he SCREAMS OUT.
Slowly he TUMBLES.
ANGLE - BRIDGE
Godzilla's enormous head comes CRASHING DOWN in front of
us. The tremendous impact sends TREMORS across the
bridge.
277
277
The gathered crowd is ROCKED from the impact of the
toppled Godzilla.
GODZILLA
His last breath escaping. Defeated and weary, his eyes
blink slowly as we watch his life slip away.
NICK AND AUDREY
Oddly, Nick stares sympathetically at Godzilla's sad and
lifeless face.
The stunned silence melts away as the mob behind them
begins to applaud nervously, then vigorously. The mob
breaks through the blockade and rushes over to our
heroes, surrounding them. Cheering enthusiastically.
278
279
Cameras flash like mad. Several news crews fight their
way through the crowd.
REPORTERS
(overlapping)
How did you discover the nest? Dr.
Tatopoulis, can you tell us what
happened back there?
NICK
Sorry, guys, I've promised my story as
an exclusive to another reporter.
Nick winks at Audrey. Caiman pushes his way through the
crowd of reporters over to her.
CAIMAN
We did it! We've got the exclusive!
Way to go, Audrey!
AUDREY
We? I don't think so.
CAIMAN
I want that story, Audrey. Remember
you work for me.
AUDREY
Not anymore. Mr. Caiman, I quit.
Audrey waves goodbye as Animal walks over, checking his
camera and his coat pocket.
ANIMAL
Audrey, did you take the tape out of
the camera?
AUDREY
No.
NICK
Where's Raymond?
They look around, but he's gone. Nowhere to be seen.
ANIMAL
I couldn't have just lost it?
A phone begins to RING. Nick checks his pockets and finds
Raymond's cellular phone. Nick answers.
NICK
Hello?
RAYMOND (O.S.)
It's Raymond.
NICK
Where are you?
280
280
Raymond watches the mob scene from a distance.
RAYMOND
Tell your friends I will send the tape
after I remove a few items from it.
NICK AND AUDREY
Nick nods to Audrey that it's Raymond.
NICK
I understand.
RAYMOND
I just wanted to say, au revoir and
thank you for your help, my friend.
NICK
Wait.
(line goes dead; to
himself)
Au revoir.
AUDREY
Who was that French guy, anyway.
NICK
Oh, just some insurance guy.
Off Audrey's confused expressions we PULL BACK, farther
and farther. We see the mob, the military, the command
tents and finally we pull back far enough to reveal
Godzilla's mighty head laying on the end of the bridge.
