At his desk in front of a fan. GEORGE RUTAGUNDA, late 30's, huge, gold
chains, Rolex watch, (like an African Mafia boss) but the same
Interahamwe shirt. He squeezes an orange rind into a cup of espresso.
Behind him, through his office window, the white van is being loaded
with cases of beer.
George holds out his massive shirt.
GEORGE
You will join us at the rally today?
Paul sits opposite, sipping coffee.
4.
PAUL
I will try my best George but these days
I have no time for rallies or politics.
GEORGE
Politics is power, Paul. And money.
Paul studies his watch.
PAUL
Time is money, George. We need extra beer
today.
GEORGE
Business is good at the hotel?
PAUL
Very good.
GEORGE
I am always glad to see you Paul.
George leads Paul out into the warehouse.
As a forklift lifts A WOODEN CRATE, George angers.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
Hell man, that is not beer, put it back!
DRIVER
But, sir, the Carlsberg is behind...
GEORGE
Forget the Carlsberg, give him Grolsch.
(to Paul)
I won't charge extra.
PAUL
Thank you.
The driver of the forklift, anxiously, spins the machine to return the
crate but it slides off and CRASHES onto the floor: MACHETES, hundreds
of them, spill out.
An awkward moment then George picks one of the crude blades.
GEORGE
A bargain buy, from China. Ten cents
each, I'll get a dollar.
PAUL
At least.
Off Zozo terrified.
5.
Paul leads Zozo and the valet into a magnificent lobby, a tasteful
blend of Africa and Europe. Guests stare as water sloshes and spills
from the crate.
GREGOIRE, early thirties the receptionist behind the desk throws a look
of disapproval. Paul, imperial, snaps his finger toward him.
PAUL
(re: spilled water)
Gregoire. Take care of this.
Gregoire engages a guest in chit-chat, ignores Paul.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Gregoire!
See to this right away.
The elevator door opens and reveals BIK the Belgian hotel manager, mid-
40's, reading some reports. He looks up, sees Paul and Zozo carrying
the box as they step in. Bik looks puzzled.
PAUL (CONT'D)
It's an emergency, sir.
Now Bik sees the wet floor.
7.
BIK
Paul!
PAUL
Gregoire will deal with it, excuse me.
The elevator doors shut. Bik's left standing in disbelief.
The crate is hefted onto a counter. The top pried off. A crowd of
cooks gathers around Paul and Zozo as they peer in.
ZOZO
Any of them make it?
HEAD CHEF
Into the sink!
They hoist up one end of the crate and LOBSTERS spill out. Many make
it into the sink, but some miss and slide across the counter and fall
onto the floor.
The cooks sort the living from the dead.
ZOZO
Twelve are dead.
PAUL
How dead?
The cooks smells a dead lobster, shakes his head no.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Dump the bad meat, save the shells, fill
them will ah, a stuffing, something
local.
COOK
Cassava, and Tipali.
PAUL
Yes. Call it 'fresh Scottish Lobster in a
cassava and Tipali crush'.
Paul fixes his tie, very pleased, another crisis solved.
Paul inspects the tables' fresh flowers, sparkling crystal glasses. He
looks to the bar - Grolsch on ice.
8.
The sound of African drums fills the air.
Paul emerges, as a troupe of African male dancers in ceremonial costume
- Leopard skin dress, ostrich feather head dress, spears and shields
perform a greeting dance for a the American Ambassador and a crowd of
European dignitaries.
The male dancers are joined by a troupe of young female dancers in
similar ceremonial dress. The ceremony comes to a foot stomping finale.
The guests break into LOUD APPLAUSE. Paul flings open double doors to a
reception room and the crowd moves in.
PAUL
Mr. Ambassador, please come in.
US AMBASSADOR
Thank you, Paul.
A UN Colonel, OLIVER, middle aged, Canadian,follows the US Ambassador.
The Colonel wear the blue berets and armbands of UN Peacekeepers. (all
UN troops will be distinguished by their bright blue berets, white
helmets and arm bands)
PAUL
Colonel Oliver, you are very welcome.
The Ambassador shakes the Colonel's hand.
US AMBASSADOR
Colonel. I'd like you to meet Mr. Colson,
of our Regional Aid Division.
MR. COLSON, crew cut, military build, is obviously CIA.
US AMBASSADOR (CONT'D)
Colonel Oliver is the liason officer for
the U.N. peace keeping forces.
Paul backs away unnoticed...
...then marches into the busy kitchen, claps his hands toward a
gathering of waiters.
PAUL
Please, serve the hors d'ouvres now.
A waiter whispers to him.
9.
WAITER
General Bizimungu wants to see you.
Paul heads out of the kitchen.
A luxurious lounge/club called the Kigali Club - an African
Casablanca, complete with animal heads, a statue of a mountain gorilla,
grand piano in the corner. Rwandan Hutu army officers, (distinguished
by their crisp khaki uniforms, in the style of the French army), arms
dealers, government dignitaries, businessmen and reporters mingle
freely. The few tourists stand out.
PAUL heads to a table. The center of attention and conversation is
General BIZIMUNGU, 40's, dressed in a crisp, heavily decorated
uniform, a strong figure, relaxed, in control.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
Paul, this scotch is exceptional.
PAUL
It's a single malt, Glenmorangie. I
thought you'd like it. Anything you need,
gentlemen, let me know.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
Oh, Paul, talk to the coat check, please.
Paul heads for the lobby. He's intercepted by an zealous young Tutsi
reporter BENEDICT who covers the political scene for the local
independent newspaper.
BENEDICT
Paul, Paul, a moment please.
PAUL
Yes, Benedict, what can I do?
BENEDICT
Can you get me into the Ambassador's
reception?
PAUL
I'm sorry, it's a private function.
Benedict takes out his reporters notebook.
BENEDICT
At least tell me who is attending. The
newspaper will be grateful.
Paul laughs.
10.
PAUL
I will be grateful if you keep my name
out of your newspaper. Wait here and you
will see who has attended as they leave.
Paul fixes a floral arrangement as he passes then arrives at the clock
room hatch.
PAUL
(to the coat check)
Did General Bizimungu bring a briefcase?
COAT CHECK
Yes, sir.
PAUL
Take it to the bar storeroom. Put three
bottles of Glenmorangie...
he writes it down on a pad)
...GLEN-MOR-AN-GIE, into it.
Paul moves off as the coat check scurries away.
ONNIE DENVER (O.S.)
Oh, Paul, Paul
An American woman, CONNIE DENVER, rich, blonde, surgically enhanced,
stands by the door of the tourism office.
Paul walks into the tourism office. It is decorated with posters and
photos of Rwanda's single most important economic asset - the rare
silver back mountain Gorillas. There's a picture of the real-life Diane
Fossey next to the movie poster for "Gorillas in the Mist". Numerous
books and video cassettes. CONNIE DENVER's older husband, BOB, and four
American friends wait.
CONNIE DENVER
Paul, Paul. Our trip has been cancelled.
PAUL
Yes, I'm sorry Madame Denver, it is
because of the rebels.
CONNIE DENVER
Rebels? What rebels?
11.
BOB
Don't be stupid for Christ sake. The
Watusis are invading the country. I told
you not to come here.
PAUL
The Tutsi rebels are far away on the
border. And soon there will be peace.
BOB
Tutsis, Watutsis they'll still shoot you.
CONNIE DENVER
But I came here to see the gorillas?
PAUL
I will try to arrange something.
The luncheon is in full swing. Paul glides in the background.
Close on: The Ambassador in deep conversation with Oliver.
US AMBASSADOR
Things will calm down when the president
signs the peace agreement with the
rebels.
COLONEL OLIVER
Our intelligence, Mr. Ambassador, is that
the Hutu government has been stockpiling
weapons and are preparing a massacre.
US AMBASSADOR
That's not what I hear. Excuse me. Paul.
Paul comes over)
Colonel, you know the house manager, Paul
Rusesabagina.
PAUL
How was your meal, sir?
US AMBASSADOR
Magnificent.
reads)
Scottish lobster, in Rwanda. You see
General what a genius this man is. You
want anything, this man can get it?
COLONEL OLIVER
How about a battalion of U.S. Marines.
12.
US AMBASSADOR
Now, General, don't ask for the
impossible.
Paul smiles.
PAUL
I have heard, Mr. Ambassador, that they
have discovered oil here, under Lake
Kivu.
Oliver bursts out laughing.
COLONEL OLIVER
You're right, Mr. Ambassador, Paul knows
how to get anything, even U.S. troops.
The ambassador takes Paul's hand, shakes it warmly.
US AMBASSADOR
Thank you for a wonderful meal, Paul.
Paul moves away graciously, and in one smooth move checks out, then
pockets, the hundred dollar bill the ambassador palmed him.
General Bizimungu gazes through glass into the reception room, SEES
Paul shake hands and joke with the Ambassador. (He's impressed.)
Paul notices the General.
The General raises his briefcase and waves.
Paul waves back. Another favor rendered.
A crowded family table. Tatiana, Paul's four children, Thomas and
Fedens, and the twins Anais and Carine.
PAUL
Roger, your turn.
Paul's eldest, ROGER, 12, bows his head.
ROGER
For food and clothes, and all that grows,
etc, etc. Dear Lord, thank you.
17.
PAUL
Thank you, Roger.
Food is passed around. Roger gobbles his down.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Why the hurry, Roger?
ROGER
Simon has a new pet. Can I go see it?
PAUL
No, I don't want you going on the street.
OGER
Please, papa, I have a secret path.
PAUL
Who is this Simon?
TATIANA
Simon, next door, the Charingas' boy.
PAUL
Homework?
ROGER
It's done.
TATIANA
And he did extra chores.
PAUL
Wash your things, and be back soon.
Roger takes off at a run.
Roger holds a WILDLY COLORED SNAKE in a jar. Simon has a bag of bugs.
Waves the bag in front of the snake. It's forked tongue goes wild.
ROGER
Let me.
Simon hands him the bugs. Roger lifts the lid, drops one bug in, and
the snake strikes. The boys jump back, laugh.
After dinner coffee for the adults. Tatiana, Thomas and Fedens at the
table. Paul, in his usual position, at the head, listening, like
Solomon.
THOMAS
I've heard bad things, Paul. My assistant
says we should get out of Rwanda.
FEDENS
Why should we leave? I have a new job,
things have never been better for us.
THOMAS
What good is it if we are murdered in our
bed?
TATIANA
Your assistant, he is Hutu?
THOMAS
Yes, and he is in the Hutu Power Militia.
CARINE
He wants your job.
THOMAS
No, he is a friend, but he tells me to
listen to the radio. All day they talk
about the great slaughter.
TATIANA
That station is filth.
PAUL has listened, now he decides to speak.
19.
PAUL
Today I talked to my friend the American
Ambassador and Colonel Oliver of the
United Nations. They are preparing a
banquet for the peace signing. The BBC
are flying in their best reporters. The
world is watching. There will be peace.
Don't listen to this man.
Solomon has spoken. Fedens smiles, Tatiana rubs Paul's arm.
Thomas and Fedens wait, anxious, as Paul appears.
PAUL
You better stay the night, it is too
dangerous to be on the streets.
Tatiana hides her anger.
TATIANA
I'll fix a bed.
Paul lies in bed unable to sleep.
The clock reads 3:00 am.
TATIANA
Why didn't you call your contacts in the
army?
PAUL
I couldn't help.
TATIANA
You could have asked for a favor.
PAUL
No, I could not. What do you know about
favors Tatiana, about barter and deals?
All day long I work to please this
officer, that diplomat, this tourist. To
store up favors so that if there is a
time when my family need help I have
powerful people I can call upon. Now you
would have me waste a precious favor on a
stranger.
TATIANA
Victor was not a stranger, he was our
neighbor.
PAUL
He was not family. Family is all that
matters. Do you think if you or I were
being dragged from here, any one of them
would lift a finger to help us?
22.
TATIANA
They do not have your connections.
PAUL
Connections? I have no connections, only
favors. If I call to help Victor, a
General will think "Paul Rusesabagina is
a fool. He thinks my favors are so
numerous and so insignificant as to waste
them on everybody." Then my hard work is
doubly squandered. I insult the General
and I do not get to use my favor at all.
Please leave these things to my good
judgment.
His turn away indicates the discussion is over.
The lobby buzzes with activity. At the reception, Gregoire is
surrounded by a BBC news crew: GLORIA, young, chic female
reporter/producer, and JOCK, tough, experienced Scottish cameraman, and
his local sound guy Peter. Gloria is upset.
GLORIA
We reserved five rooms not two
GREGOIRE
I'm sorry, ma'am, but I see only two here
in the computer.
23.
Jock sees Paul.
JOCK
Paul, how the hell are ya'?
PAUL
I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish.
JOCK
They moved you from the Diplomat?
PAUL
Promoted. House Manager.
JOCK
Good for you.
(moves closer)
We're having a little trouble, Paul. We
booked five rooms, but...
Paul moves behind the desk.
PAUL
Let me check.
He punches into the computer.
PAUL
Ah, I see the mistake. You were reading
CBC - the Canadian broadcasting people
instead of BBC Gregoire.
Close on the computer: It clearly states BBC - two rooms.
Gregoire
looks to Paul with a mix of puzzlement and anger.
Of course, the BBC, five rooms.
(lies)
They are being prepared as we speak. I
have ordered fresh flowers and
complimentary champagne.
Gloria picks up her bag.
GLORIA
Great, I really need a shower.
PAUL
Just give me a moment to get your keys.
Paul better come up with three rooms fast. Then he spots the reporter
Benedict hovering at the door.
24.
PAUL (CONT'D)
(to Gloria)
Excuse me for one second.
Paul hurries over to Benedict.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Benedict, you should meet the BBC people.
They could use your expertise.
Benedict is delighted. They head back across the lobby.
PAUL (CONT'D)
(whisper)
Benedict, General Bizimungu will be here
any moment. The BBC should talk to him.
They join the BBC team.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Madame, this is Benedict Nangori, one of
our best journalists. He covers all the
big stories. I thought you should meet.
Gloria, a consummate news producer, turns on the charm.
GLORIA
Benedict, beautiful name. I'm Gloria
Fleming. BBC.
Paul moves off to the desk, Gregoire can barely disguise his pleasure.
GREGOIRE
There are no more rooms.
PAUL
Give me the phone.
Gregoire hands it over. Paul dials.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Madame Denver. I have very good news. I
have a present for you, in return for the
cancellation of your gorilla expedition I
have arranged a safari at Lake Kivu
lodge. A wonderful experience. No, no
extra charge. A luxury coach will leave
in one hour. I'll send maids up to help
you all pack. You're welcome.
Paul hangs up, turns to Gregoire.
25.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Call Kivu Lodge, ask for George, tell him
I need three rooms. And send a team of
maids up to the Americans. I want those
rooms turned around in twenty minutes.
PAUL heads for the glass doors and sees:
Paul turns, walks past porters ferrying the BBC luggage. He puts his
hand out. Gregoire hands him keys.
Paul does his rounds. He double checks the banquet room where
technicians install several TV monitors and test the signal.
He looks in the kitchen, frenzied activity.
He wanders behind the bar. Everything is 'under control'.
He returns to the lobby, greets Connie, her flustered husband and their
friends, followed by a team of porters and luggage.
26.
PAUL
Forgive the hurry but I do not want you
to miss the lunch buffet on the paddle
steamer across the lake. It is the most
spectacular sight in all Africa.
OB
Lunch? All we do is eat. I thought there
was famine in Africa.
PAUL
Exactly, we can't have our guests
starving. What would they think of the
Mille Collines back in the United States?
Gen. Bizimungu, takes Paul's arm, pulls him aside, hands him his empty
briefcase.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
Keep that cockroach Benedict away from
me.
As the General disappears into the bar, Paul waves over the coat check,
hands her the briefcase.
PAUL
Same as last time.
She nods, hurries off just as the BBC crew appears. Paul hands out
keys, greets each.
PAUL (CONT'D)
The fifth room is your broadcast room.
GLORIA
Good. I'd like to book a massage.
PAUL
Of course.
Jock, the Scottish cameraman, hangs behind as the others leave, takes
his key.
JOCK
Did you bring any of those wee girls who
used to sit at the bar in the Diplomat
with you? You know?
PAUL
I'm sorry, Mr. Daglish, this is the Mille
Collines. No working girls here.
JOCK
Can we phone them in, Paul?
27.
PAUL
I'm afraid I can't do that, Mr. Daglish.
Ah, Zozo.
Paul calls Zozo over.
PAUL (CONT'D)
You remember Zozo, from the Diplomat?
Jock gets the code instantly, as Zozo smiles.
JOCK
Zozo! The very man!
The Scot and Zozo greet, then hurry off.
Paul supervises waiters hanging a banner.
It reads "Peace, Love, and
Brotherhood! UNAMIR 1994".
Reporters watch rows of TVs. All broadcast the signing of the Arusha
Accords. (Reporters have political chatter.)
CLOSE ON: the TVs as President Habyarimana signs.
COMMENTATOR
As president Habyarimana signs a peace
accord between the Tutsi rebels and his
Hutu army there remains strong doubts
that the extremist Hutu Power will abide
by the accords. But for now hope has
returned to Rwanda for the first time in
many years.
All the African reporters in the room CHEER.
Fireworks go off outside the hotel.
Colonel Oliver raises a glass of champagne and leads the room in a
toast.
COLONEL OLIVER
To Peace.
The room as one raise their glasses.
CLOSE ON: Paul as he nods to a member of the tribal band on the small
stage. Then, African drummers hammer out a fast uplifting beat as the
full troupe of ceremonial dancers skip into the room in celebration.
28.
Paul checks out the banques. They appear empty, then a voice.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
Paul, join us.
It's General Bizimungu, he is sitting with George Rutagunda now in a
shiny blue suit. A bottle of whiskey on the table is almost gone.
Bizimungu and Rutagunda watch the peace celebration across the lobby.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
Have a drink.
He pours. George points his glass toward the Europeans.
GEORGE
Look at them, they want to see the tribes
dance to their tune. Here is our dance.
Rutagunda staggers to his feet, launches into a drunken version of the
Hutu Militia War Dance.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
Come on, Paul. Show them our dance.
Paul takes George's arm, does two steps of the dance, then
appears to
stumble and shoulder bumps the big man.
George falls into his chair.
PAUL
Forgive me, George, my step was off.
Rutagunda bursts out laughing, toasts:
GEORGE
To our president. May he find peace.
As Paul is forced to join in the toast, Rutagunda laughs, Bizimungu
smiles at some insider joke.
Reporters and crews pack up their equipment. Paul shakes hands, orders
porters to pick up cases. Then a porter whispers a message to Paul.
PAUL
Excuse me, gentlemen.
29.
PAUL'S CAR. NIGHT
Paul's at the wheel, driving. A thick mist. Barely a car on the road.
Shadows dart past faint house lights. The windscreen clouds. Paul
switches on his wipers. A Toyota truck, loaded with Militia, appears
from the mist, speeds past. Paul switches the preset buttons on the
radio as he drives. He can only find fevered drum-based MUSIC.
31.
The door slowly opens. Paul steps in quietly, tries the light switch,
nothing. He listens. The only sounds are distant explosions and
gunfire. The beam of his flashlight cuts the blackness, illuminating:
magazines arranged on a coffee table; an empty chair; children's toys
in a basket.
Paul continues his search. Scans the counter. There's food on the
stove. The table is set. He hears a GROWL, quickly cut short, from one
of the bedrooms.
Paul shines the light into a room. Looks for a second, then closes the
door, and walks to the next. He stops and listens with his ear to the
door. Nothing. He pushes it in.
Paul's light sweeps across the room and illuminates:
Eyes - terrified eyes, a room full of faces, staring back.
THEIR POV: A dark figure behind a blinding light.
The dog breaks free, runs to Paul.
32.
PAUL
Pealiss!
From among the faces, Tatiana's voice heavy with relief.
TATIANA
Paul!
Paul's eyes adjust, he recognizes many of his neighbors, all crowded
into this small room. Then he sees their friends Odette and her husband
Jean Baptiste.
PAUL
Jean Baptiste!
JEAN BAPTISTE
Our house has been burned.
PAUL
What is going on?
TATIANA
The president has been murdered.
PAUL
Murdered! By whom?
ODETTE
The radio says Tutsi rebels.
PAUL
Nonsense. Why would the rebels kill the
president when he agreed to peace?
Tatiana pulls Paul aside.
TATIANA
Where are Thomas and Fedens?
PAUL
I sent them home. Go and call them.
TATIANA
I tried already. The phones do not work.
Jean Baptiste turns on his tiny radio.
RADIO ANNOUNCER
Our great president is murdered, by the
Tutsi cockroaches. They tricked him, then
they killed him. We must cleanse this
country, Good Hutus of Rwanda. We must
clear the brush. Clear the brush of all
cockroaches. Clear the brush!!!
33.
The words are cut short as a grenade blast rattles the window. Everyone
jumps, children whimper. Paul is shocked but tries to pull things
together.
PAUL
Come on, everyone out of this room, find
a seat in the living room.
He holds the door open, they file out, frightened. Tatiana is last, he
stops her, steps back in, closes the door.
PAUL (CONT'D)
(in hushed anger)
Is every Tutsi in the neighborhood here?
TATIANA
They came through the bushes, over the
wall. What could I do?
PAUL
Send them home. We are not the police.
What do we have to protect them?
TATIANA
Please. Let them stay 'til morning. The
militia will not come here, they know you
are a Hutu with influence.
PAUL
They know you are Tutsi!
The door knocks.
Paul gets up, angry.
TATIANA
Please, Paul, 'til first light.
PAUL
Dawn. Then they go.
Paul opens the door, it's Odette, holding the hand of Paul's eldest
daughter.
ODETTE
Forgive me, Paul. Danielle says that
Roger has gone.
Tatiana comes over instantly, worried.
TATIANA
Gone where? Tell me, Danielle.
Their daughter Danielle answers.
34.
DANIELLE
Next door, mama. He was afraid for his
friend Simon. He went to fetch him.
Paul bursts through the back door and sets Roger down.
Tatiana is
beside them.
TATIANA
Roger!
Paul turns the flashlight on Roger. Tatiana pulls back in horror:
Roger is covered in blood. Her SCREAMS, stifled by fear.
TATIANA (CONT'D)
Oh, my God!
PAUL
Where are you hurt, son?
oger stares blankly. Odette is beside them now.
ODETTE
Get his clothes off.
Hands pull and tear his clothes off. Towels wipe him down. Odette
looks all over his body with the flashlight. Despite the blood Roger
has no injuries.
PAUL
What happened, son? Where did you get
this blood?
But Roger, trembling, just stares, totally traumatized. Children cry.
ODETTE
He's not injured.
His paralysis freaks the women in the room. Paul turns angrily to them.
PAUL
Leave us, give us some space.
36.
He ushers the neighbors out of the room, closes the door.
PAUL (CONT'D)
(to Tatiana)
The neighbors must go at dawn.
Tatiana hugs her son.
PAUL sits on the edge of the bed, staring out the window.
Behind him Tatiana has Roger cradled in her arms, he still trembles
wide eyed as she tries to get him to talk.
TATIANA
Will you take a little milk?
Nothing.
PAUL
Let him sleep.
The door knocks. The old guard calls in frightened.
OLD GUARD (O.S.)
Mr. Paul.
PAUL
(to Tatiana)
It is time for the neighbors to leave.
He heads for the door.
Paul steps out, closes the door behind him. A small delegation of the
men wait nervously.
JEAN BAPTISTE
It is true.
37.
He holds up the tiny radio, tuned to the BBC World service, a crackly
Brit voice. (It's Gloria the reporter.)
GLORIA THE REPORTER (O.S.)
The Hutu president's plane was struck by
a ground-to-air missile as he returned
from signing the peace accord with the
Tutsi rebels. There were no survivors.
The Hutu government has already blamed
the Tutsi rebels. The rebels have denied
the accusation. Already there are reports
of reprisal killings on the streets.
As they listen, a young woman lets out a SQUEAL, and flees the window
where she's been sitting.
WOMEN (O.S.)
They are here.
Hysteria in the room, women and children push toward the bedroom. Paul
manages to make it to the window, nervously steals a glance and sees:
A HUTU ARMY SOLDIER sits on the high wall by the gate. He pulls another
up beside him.
anic in the room now. Paul turns.
PAUL
Shut up!
PAUL'S POV: The soldiers drop into his garden. They draw pistols.
TATIANA (O.S.)
What is it, Paul.
PAUL
Stay with the children.
PAUL'S POV: The soldiers go to the gate, slide the bolt, swing it open.
Two jeeps, jammed with heavily armed SOLDIERS, sit in the drive like
many-limbed beasts of war. Paul watches as the jeeps rumble into his
garden. The soldiers jump out.
INSIDE THE ROOM:
Nothing can stop the women and children from fleeing into the bedrooms.
Paul is frozen at the CRASH of rifles on the door.
The door gives, SOLDIERS flood in.
They are startled by the crowd in the living room, rifles raised,
SHOUTS.
38.
SOLDIERS
Out, get out now!
Paul pulls himself together, marches over to the soldier.
PAUL
Who is in charge?
A Captain is at the door.
CAPTAIN
Who are you?
PAUL
I am Paul Rusesabagina, a good friend of
General Bizimungu.
CAPTAIN
We are looking for you.
He takes Paul by the arm, leads him outside.
Paul looks back as they speed off down the street.
Sees: The Militia looters pour into his gateway.
As they pass the Caringa home, Militia looters carry off a TV and push
a stove on a child's skateboard.
TATIANA has Roger on her lap, she cradles his head.
Paul runs through the lobby. The staff look petrified.
Paul bursts into the room. The two soldiers follow.
He goes to the hotel's big old combination safe, spins the combination
a few times, tries the handle, clunk! It doesn't open. He's forgotten
the number.
The soldiers look at him impatiently. Paul improvises.
PAUL
Gentlemen, you'll find some chocolate,
and maybe a few beers in the fridge.
Don't let them go to waste.
The soldiers fall over each other to get to the fridge.
Paul tries the safe numbers again, clunk! It opens.
He sees: a big bunch of keys, a wad of dollars, Rwandan francs, a check
book, and several bottles of the best cognac, whiskey, some Cristal.
He looks round nervously but the two soldiers are busy fighting over
the beer and chocolates in the fridge.
s they do, Paul, hands trembling, stuffs the wads of notes, into his
belt, pulls his shirt over and shuts the safe door.
PAUL (CONT'D)
I've got them.
He is about to leave.
SOLDIER 1
Wait!
Paul looks back at the soldier.
SOLDIER 1 (CONT'D)
Sit down.
Paul sits, as the two soldiers guzzle beers and stuff chocolate into
their pockets.
42.
Paul hurries through the lobby toward the entrance.
Paul rushes in:
The lobby is filled with Tutsi refugees, and scared
white tourists.
solitary receptionist, besieged by anxious guests, is relieved to see
Paul.
RECEPTIONIST
Oh, sir, please can you...
Paul rushes to the accounting room behind the reception desk, closes
the door.
Paul pulls bundles of dollars from the hotel safe.
At the desk, the same receptionist is overwhelmed.
TOURIST (O.C.)
He's in charge, that's him.
Paul goes behind the desk. Rumors fly among the crowd of tourists.
TOURISTS
(staccato) to the airport...my embassy
...tried to call... the airport is closed
... refund... this is outrageous ...
Behind the tourists, Tatiana and the neighbors look lost.
Paul addresses the frightened Western tourists.
PAUL
Please, I am the house manager. Return in
thirty minutes and we will deal with all
your requests, thank you.
Paul turns to the room key boxes, nearly all are empty.
PAUL (CONT'D)
What happened to all the rooms?
Finally he finds a key, pushes through to Tatiana, hands a key to
Odette and Jean Baptiste.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Take this room. Tatiana, bring the
children.
Paul starts to lead his family away.
TATIANA
(re: neighbors) What about them?
Paul looses it.
PAUL
Them. They almost got us all killed. I
have done enough for them! We cannot look
after them anymore.
49.
TATIANA
What are you going to do? You cannot
drive them out onto the road. They can
stay with me.
PAUL
What!
TATIANA
I will not have them on my conscience.
They will stay in my room.
PAUL
(to Zozo)
Zozo, get a key for two staff bedrooms.
Put these people in them.
ZOZO
Yes, sir.
Paul hurries his family along the corridor. Rwandan refugees wander
aimlessly pulling their meagre possessions.
REFUGEE
(calls out)
Moses, Moses Seradungu.
PAUL
Can I help you?
REFUGEE
I'm looking for Moses Seradungu's room.
PAUL
What is his room number?
REFUGEE
I don't know.
PAUL
Go downstairs, I will help you.
Paul finds his room and opens the door.
PAUL leads his family into a one-bedroom suite. The kids drop to the
beds exhausted. Tatiana picks up the phone and dials.
50.
PAUL
What are you doing?
TATIANA
Trying Thomas and Fedens. We've got to
get them here.
Paul paces the room. The maids clearly haven't cleaned it since it's
last occupants: the beds are unmade; towels are on the floor; and a
newspaper is scattered across the desk.
PAUL
(re: room) This won't do.
TATIANA
It will do just fine.
So Paul tidies the place. As he does,
PAUL
Any luck?
TATIANA
No answer. Please send someone to get
them, please.
PAUL
I'll try.
Paul leaves.
Paul stops just shy of the lobby. Around the corner is a mob of angry
guests. Paul takes a moment to gather himself: straightens his tie;
button his jacket; flick a piece of lint from his shoulder. Then he
takes a breath and steps around the corner.
PAUL
Thank you for your patience, ladies and
gentlemen. Now, how can I help you.
The mob rushes him.
CUT TO:
Paul works the front desk as angry guests surge all around him. Zozo
emerges from the office with two tourists.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Where are the receptionists? Where's
Gregoire?
ZOZO
He has taken the presidential suite.
PAUL
What!
Paul storms off.
CLOSE ON: A door with a placard reading "Presidential Suite".
Paul
knocks. The door opens. Gregoire answers, half-naked.
GREGOIRE
(surprised)
Mr. Manager.
PAUL
Gregoire, what are you doing here?
52.
A WOMAN'S VOICE INSIDE (O.S.)
Who is it?
GREGOIRE
What do you want?
PAUL
Get out of this room and get back to
work.
GREGOIRE
I don't have to listen to you anymore.
PAUL
I am in charge now. Get back to work or
I'll fire you.
GREGOIRE
Let me ask you Mr. Manager, do you notice
a smell of cockroaches? If I were to
leave this room, I'm sure I could find
this smell. I know people who could
cleanse it.(stares) But maybe it doesn't
bother you? Why is that? Are used to this
smell? Not me, I need a clean room to
escape it.
Gregoire closes the door. Paul's eyes burn with anger, but this battle
will have to wait.
Paul comes into the lobby and discovers Colonel Oliver, he is escorting
a tall, well-dressed man, the Tutsi Minister of Finance XAVIER and his
family.
COLONEL OLIVER
Paul, you know who this is?
PAUL
Yes, Colonel Monsieur Xavier, the
Minister of Finance.
COLONEL OLIVER
Get him a room, but tell no one he is
here.
(to Xavier)
Paul will look after you.
XAVIER
I will need a suite.
53.
PAUL
Of course.
He moves over to Zozo.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Get the key to suite twelve, take these
people there right away.
There's a commotion by the door. Paul goes over.
A valet stops a group of Tutsi refugees from entering.
PAUL (CONT'D)
What's going on?
VALET
Sir, they have no reservations.
Paul studies the group, - a ragged bunch, no way are they Mille
Collines guest material.
REFUGEE #2
Please, sir, we have nowhere else to go.
They're hunting us.
PAUL
Wait over there.
EFUGEE #3
We need a room.
PAUL
I said everyone go over there.
Paul sees: UN Colonel Oliver giving an interview to the BBC in front of
the hotel.
Paul works his way through the crowds in the lobby, sees a trolley of
dishes by an elevator, looks around, can't see any staff. Disgusted, he
pushes the trolley himself.
Paul pushes the trolley into the deserted kitchen. At the back door,
several cooks listen to the radio.
RADIO ANNOUNCER
'Good Hutus, we must destroy an
infestation of cockroaches at the
technical college.'
PAUL
Turn that off. We have a hotel to run.
The cooks halfheartedly slouch back to the sinks.
The lobby is overflowing with refugees. Paul stands with phone to ear.
Zozo walks up.
PAUL
(to Zozo)
Where's housekeeping? They won't pick up.
ZOZO
Sir, no one wants to work. They say the
boss has left.
56.
Paul heads for the back office.
A neat corporate office.
Paul picks up the phone.
Several executive officers sit across from Sabena President GODEFROID
around a speaker phone.
ABENA PRESIDENT
Can I have your name again?
PAUL (O.S.)
Paul Rusesabagina, Mr. Godefroid. The
house manager. I met you on your last
visit.
SABENA PRESIDENT
Yes, Paul, I remember. The Mille Collines
is a very important property for Sabena.
Our directors believe we should close
down, shutter the place until this unrest
is over?
This is really bad news. Paul can't allow them to close.
PAUL
Sir, that would be very bad for our
reputation. We are an oasis of calm for
all our loyal customers. What would they
think if Sabena deserted them now? (lies)
I assure you the United Nations has
everything under control.
IN THE SABENA PRESIDENT
He looks at the others.
SABENA PRESIDENT
Very well. But if this thing gets worse,
we must close. If there's anything you
need, call anytime.
PAUL
There is one thing I need right away.
57.
Paul waits by the fax, then it spits out a single page.
Every member of the hotel staff is gathered together. Paul addresses
them as Zozo hands out copies of a fax.
PAUL
This is my letter of appointment, signed
by Mr. Godefroid, the president of
Sabena. The Mille Collines is a five star
establishment, we will run it that way.
If you don't want to work for me, then
leave now.
No one moves.
PAUL (CONT'D)
I want the hallways cleaned now, a menu
prepared for the dining room. Where's the
pianist?
A hand goes up.
PAUL (CONT'D)
I want you on the piano in the Kigali
Room tonight. Back to work.
Paul follows Oliver as he marches through the lobby. Several reporters
surround them.
REPORTERS
Is it true about the Belgian soldiers...
Are all ten dead?
Paul watches the UN command disappear into an elevator.
The room is set up as a make-shift broadcast center.
Gloria is on a phone to the BBC in London, she hangs up.
GLORIA
Okay, we're feeding through live now.
She fixes her outfit, sits straight up in the chair. Behind her two
monitors show footage of a plane crash and bodies along roads.
GLORIA
Okay London .... and five four three two
one ...That's correct Tom. Today's
gruesome ambush of a ten man Belgian
patrol has left the UN peacekeeping force
in a state of disarray. Its commander has
called for re-enforcements. However, the
General Council is deeply divided. The
United States, still smarting from the
UN's disastrous Somalia mission, has
indicated that it will veto any moves to
reinforce. Meanwhile, the slaughter goes
on. Gloria Brooks in Kigali, Rwanda.
Gloria on the phone, listens.
GLORIA
And, cut ...good, give me a call guys,
let me know you've got it.
Jock turns to Paul.
JOCK
Perfect timing.
PAUL
This goes out live?
Jock points skyward.
JOCK
Satellite feed.
GLORIA (ON PHONE)
Great. (listens) No kidding,
When will
they be here? Excellent. Yes, call then.
She hangs up.
61.
GLORIA (CONT'D)
The news room has heard that the French
and the Belgians are putting together an
intervention force.
PAUL
When will they be here?
GLORIA
Very soon.
PAUL
Thank God.
Jock's is at the window scanning with his camera, getting b roll, then
he sees something.
JOCK
Hey Peter, hook me back into the
monitors.
Jock's filming as Peter makes the connection.
JOCK (CONT'D)
Holy shit! Holy shit.
GLORIA
What is it?
Jock focuses
On the monitor: blurry focus of a shanty town on a hill.
NOW FOCUS: Of a crowd hovering close to a group of Rwandan Tutsis
seated on the ground. Two Militia emerge from the crowd, waving
machetes. They SLASH their way along the line, savage, powerful blows,
butchering people like cattle.
(Author note: we will use real
news footage of this)
JOCK (CONT'D)
You fucking see that!
GLORIA
(shock)
Oh my God!
On Screen: The crowd run off, waving machetes.
Gloria snaps out of her shock, snatches the phone, dials.
62.
GLORIA (CONT'D)
It's Gloria. Listen we've footage,
unbelievable footage! A massacre!
Machetes, murderers, dead bodies. You
have to lead with this. We'll send it
through right now. Wait 'til you see
this.
She puts the phone down, turns to the others, triumphant.
An embarrassed silence in the room. Jock is disgusted by her glee. He
picks up a plate from the trolley.
JOCK
(to Gloria) Here, have a sandwich.
GLORIA
Fuck you.
She storms out. Paul fills the embarrassed silence.
PAUL
I'm glad you filmed this. Now the West
will have to stop it. Excuse me,
gentlemen.
Paul and Tatiana push through the French tourists and AID workers
running across the lobby.
64.
FRENCH TOURISTS
Mon Dieu, Merci.
Cheers break out. Paul and Tatsi peer from the crowd and through the
lobby window see:
Paul follows the Colonel into the Kigali Club. The place is empty, the
bartender missing, gone to celebrate.
PAUL
Colonel, what can I get you?
Paul gets behind the bar.
65.
COLONEL OLIVER
Anything. Strong.
PAUL
Canadian Club?
Oliver cracks a weary smile. Paul pours two drinks, slides one across.
He raises his glass.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Congratulations, Colonel. You have saved
us all.
COLONEL OLIVER
(raw cynicism)
Congratulations. You should spit in my
face.
PAUL
Excuse me, Colonel.
COLONEL OLIVER
We think you are dirt, less than dirt,
worthless.
PAUL
I don't understand.
COLONEL OLIVER
Don't bullshit me, Paul. You're the
smartest man here. You have them all
eating out of your hand. You'd own this
fucking hotel, except for one thing.
Paul doesn't answer.
COLONEL OLIVER (CONT'D)
You're fucking black! You're not even a
nigger, you're African!
(downs his drink)
They're not staying to stop this thing.
They're gonna fly right out of here with
their people.
PAUL
(shocked)
Their people?
COLONEL OLIVER
They're only taking the whites.
66.
Paul opens the door. Tatiana and the kids pack bags, prepare to leave.
PAUL
Children, go into the hallway.
Tatiana and the children stop what they're doing, puzzled.
PAUL (CONT'D)
(to the kids) Please, go.
The kids leave.
TATIANA
What's wrong?
Paul takes her hands in his.
PAUL
All the whites are leaving.
Tatiana's grip tightens.
PAUL (CONT'D)
They are being evacuated.
TATIANA
What about us?
PAUL
We have been abandoned.
Tatiana clings to hope.
TATIANA
The soldiers will stop the killers.
Paul looses it.
PAUL
Listen to me woman. I said all the whites
are leaving. The French, the Italians,
even the Belgian UN soldiers.
TATIANA
But who is left?
PAUL
I don't know. Colonel Oliver says the UN
has three hundred soldiers for the whole
country. Black soldiers, Pakistanis.
67.
He looks up at her.
PAUL (CONT'D)
The most the Colonel can spare for the
hotel are four men, and they're not
allowed to shoot.
He takes her hand, makes her sit down.
PAUL (CONT'D)
If anything should happen, if the Militia
arrive, you must take the children and go
to the roof.
Tatiana's eyes are wide with fear.
TATIANA
What for?
Paul takes his anger out on Tatiana.
PAUL
Do what I say, woman. You hear me? I will
meet you there.
He storms out.
CUT TO:
REVEAL: A chaos of luggage, white tourists, AID agency people, Italian
and French soldiers, elite, slick.
On the edges, clumps of Rwandans, watching, silent, fearful.
At the front desk, Paul, dripping wet from working the convoy,
listens
to a French tourist who refuses to pay his bill.
68.
FRENCH TOURIST
Why should I pay to stay in a, in a
holocaust? Tell me.
Paul, stone-faced, polite, destroys this asshole.
PAUL
You are not staying sir, you are leaving.
Jock grabs his camera, pushes off the bus.
Where five minutes before the lobby was a frenzy of wealthy Europeans
and aid workers, the groups of clustered black faces are silent except
for the crying of babies and sobbing mothers. Paul picks his way among
them. Zozo catches up.
ZOZO
What do we do with all these people?
PAUL
Open up the ballroom, we'll put them
there. And Zozo tell the kitchen to make
rice and beans - a lot of it.
Paul enters, drops to the bed. Tatiana curls up next to him.
TATIANA
You could leave, Paul.
71.
PAUL
What are you saying, Tatsi?
TATIANA
Your card says Hutu. Take our children,
go and get the twins, pay money at the
roadblocks. Get them out. Please.
PAUL
Enough of this. We stay together. Let me
rest, I will feel better then.
Paul puts on his walkman earphones, presses play, the rich cowboy drawl
of Don Williams singing ???
Close on: Paul as his eyes droop and to the music.
A kalidiscope of colors filter through drooping eyelids as
Close on Paul's face, as the music plays.
His eyes open wide, disturbed, music playing
Paul's POV, an Army lieutenant stands over him, other soldiers around.
The lieutenant reaches down, pulls the earphones from Paul's ears.
LIEUTENANT
You are the manager?
PAUL
Yes, sir. What is wrong?
LIEUTENANT
Everyone must leave the hotel now.
PAUL
Why sir?
LIEUTENANT
It's an order. Get everyone out now.
PAUL
I...ah...need some time. Please give us
twenty, thirty minutes. People are
sleeping.
The lieutenant is not impressed.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Please, have some cold drinks. I will be
as quick as I can.
'Cold drinks' softens the soldiers' attitudes.
72.
LIEUTENANT
We will be outside, ten minutes.
The soldiers march off. Paul goes back inside. The kids, sensing the
menace, sit still and wide-eyed on the floor. Suddenly Tatiana notices
Roger is missing.
TATIANA
Where's Roger?
Danielle points to under the bed.
CLOSE ON:
Roger trembling under the bed, as Paul's face appears.
PAUL
Come on son, everything is all right.
He slides him out, clutches him in his arms, then turns him over to
Tatiana as he phones the front desk.
PAUL (CONT'D)
(on phone)
Who is this? Zozo. I know. Get them beer.
He turns to Tatiana.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Go to the roof now.
TATIANA
(terrified)
What for Paul.
PAUL
(forceful)
Do as I say. I will be there soon.
He hurries out.
Paul's door opens, his head appears round the corner.
The corridor is empty of soldiers. Now, frightened Tutsis peer out from
their rooms. A group of men, among them the politician Xavier, are
gathered in the hallway. Paul spots one man holding a pistol. He runs
up.
PAUL
(to the man with the pistol)
Are you mad? They will gun us all down.
73.
PISTOL MAN
Better to die by the bullet than the
machete.
Paul pulls the gun off him.
PAUL
Wait here, please.
Paul hands the gun to Xavier, hurries off.
Paul bursts in, sits by the phone and dials.
PAUL (ON PHONE)
Good day, General Bizimungu please. Do
you know where he is? Please ask him to
call Paul Rusesabagina. It is urgent.
Phone again.
A SERIES OF FLASH CUTS: increasingly frantic calls.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Colonel Bagsora. Where? Can you find him?
ANOTHER CALL:
PAUL (CONT'D)
Who would order such a thing?
ANOTHER CALL:
PAUL (CONT'D)
Did you find the General?
Paul hangs up the phone defeated. He looks at his watch. His head flops
onto the desk, onto the Sabena logo. He sees it.
The Sabena president and two VPs sit on couches.
PRESIDENT
If British Airways abandons the route we
should bid for it.
His intercom buzzes, he's annoyed then.
74.
SECRETARY (ON PHONE)
I'm sorry, sir. I have a call from Paul
in Kigali. He says it's urgent.
The president goes to the phone, hits the speaker button.
PRESIDENT
Paul. Are you alright?
PAUL (O.S.)
We have a big problem. The Hutu army have
come and ordered us all of us out of the
hotel.
The president is baffled.
RESIDENT
Out? Where are you going?
PAUL
I do not know, sir. I think they will
kill us all.
The president can barely form words to reply.
PRESIDENT
All. What do you mean all?
PAUL
The staff, the guests.
PRESIDENT
The staff and guests! How many?
PAUL
Now we have eight hundred guests and one
hundred staff. I have ten minutes left.
I wish I could have done more, sir.
Please, thank all my friends at Sabena.
You have been good to me and my family.
PRESIDENT
(panicked) Paul, wait, wait, I'm going to
put you on hold for one minute, stay on
the phone.
He hits the hold button. Looks to the other executives. They are
stunned to silence by Paul's profound farewell.
Paul listens to music on the phone.
75.
Pandemonium - the president has everyone working the phones.
PRESIDENT
Get the prime minister's office. Call
General Chareaux. Louis get the UN. Tell
them this is Belgian property.
The music is suddenly interrupted.
PRESIDENT (O.S.)
Paul, are you there?
PAUL
Yes, thank you Mr. President.
PRESIDENT (O.S.)
Paul, if you have one call in all the
world to stop this, who would you call?
Paul thinks.
PAUL
The French. They supply the Rwandan army.
PRESIDENT (O.S.)
Paul, do everything you can to buy time.
I will call you back.
Paul hurries from the room.
Zozo at the computer, printing something. Paul walks up, sees: The
Hotel's Registry printing. Paul grabs it, studies.
PAUL
What are you doing?
ZOZO
The lieutenant wants the register.
He pushes Zozo toward the elevator.
PAUL
Go and get more beer.
Now Paul is on the computer, typing.
76.
ON SCREEN: The register shows that day's date: April 13.
Paul hits a few keys.
ON SCREEN: The date above the register is April 4.
Paul hits the print button. The printer clicks to life.
Paul arrives behind the front desk.
Paul hits the button.
PAUL
They are gone. Thank you, sir. What did
you do?
78.
Gotfroid is at his desk.
SABENA PRESIDENT
I managed to get the President of France
on the phone.
PAUL (O.S.)
Thank you, sir, you saved our lives.
SABENA PRESIDENT
Paul, I pleaded with the president to go
in and get you all. He told me it will
not happen.
PAUL
Why?
SABENA PRESIDENT
I can give you many political answers
Paul but the truth is that Africa is not
worth a single vote to all of them:
French, British, Americans.
Silence.
SABENA PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
You have to get out of there, Paul. I
will do whatever I can.
SMASH CUT TO:
The elite of the Tutsi refugees, those with contacts or friends abroad,
are gathered in the office.
PAUL
There will be no rescue, no intervention
force. We can only save ourselves. Call
any foreigner you know, tell them what
will happen to us. Say goodbye but when
you say goodbye, say it as though you're
reaching through and shaking their hand.
Let them know if they let go of that
hand, you will die. (silence) We must
shame them into sending help.
The others look stunned.
79.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Get on the phones while we still can. At
least we can say they heard our cries.
Zozo come with me.
Paul leaves.
CUT TO:
Paul looks around the lobby. It resembles a refugee center more than a
five star hotel.
He turns to a computer, calls up the register, then hits DELETE and
erases the register.
He picks up the phone, calls.
PAUL
Send two of the housekeeping carpenters
to the lobby.
Paul strides across the lobby, calls to Zozo.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Everyone gather together now. Zozo get
them all together.
They herd together quickly.
PAUL (CONT'D)
No one can remain in this lobby any
longer. I have rooms available. Who can
pay? The rental is six hundred francs per
day.
About fifty percent of the hands go up.
TUTSI WOMAN
I cannot pay?
PAUL
Go with Zozo to the ballroom. We will
find you bedding. This is a hotel. No one
will be allowed to stay in the lobby.
The carpenters arrive beside Paul.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Good. I want you to go around and take
all the numbers off the doors.
80.
CARPENTER
What shall we put in their place.
PAUL
Nothing. I want no numbers on the doors.
Paul going door to door, knocking. The rooms are all packed with Tutsi
refugees. A door opens.
PAUL
Good day. Here is your bill for the last
week. If you cannot pay, or think you
will not be able to pay, go to the
ballroom. Zozo will take care of you.
DISSOLVE TO:
Paul knocks on a door. The Tutsi politician Xavier opens the door, sees
that it is Paul.
XAVIER
Come in Paul.
A beautiful two-bedroom suite. Xavier lives in comfort compared to the
other refugees.
PAUL
I'm afraid you will have to move room.
XAVIER
Move? Where to?
PAUL
I'm going to put you on the third floor.
XAVIER
The third floor are low class rooms.
PAUL
Yes they are. However if the army return
they will expect important people such as
yourself to be in these grand rooms.
81.
XAVIER
(to his wife)
Pack the bags, we have to move.
PAUL
Also, this is your bill for the last
week.
Paul leaves, Xavier looks shocked.
FADE TO:
MONTAGE
Paul and influential refugees, Odette, Benedict (with a bandage over
his missing ear), Xavier and others call, plead, write and send faxes
all around the world. We see this NIGHT and DAY; DAY and NIGHT --
hen Odette on the phone.
ODETTE
Yes, that's right. I helped set up the
treatment center in Nairobi. I'm in the
Mille Collines Hotel right now with my
husband, Peter, and my two boys. If you
do not help us we will be murdered.
Zozo arrives.
ZOZO
Sir, General Bizimungu is here.
Paul fills Bizimungu's briefcase with scotch, hands two six-packs of
beer to Zozo. Paul notes his once packed storeroom, now considerably
dwindled in stock.
PAUL
Where has all our beer gone?
ZOZO
Sir, Gregoire has been taking beers.
PAUL
How much beer?
ZOZO
Many beers.
Benedict greets Paul in the lobby.
BENEDICT
Paul, we would like to speak to you in
your office.
PAUL
We, who is we?
BENEDICT
A delegation.
Paul walks in and discovers the office packed with the elite Tutsi
refugees including Xavier, Odette and Jean Baptiste. Paul's puzzled,
there's an air of tension in the room.
PAUL
Yes.
A brief silence, then a Tutsi bank manager speaks.
BANKER
You have no right to charge us rent.
PAUL
Why not?
BANKER
This is no longer a hotel, it is a prison
and you are profiteering from our misery.
ODETTE
That is not true.
Another accuser speaks up.
TUTSI ACCUSER
Yes it is. He charges for food, for
everything. Where is all this money
going? We hear he has a deal with
Bizimungu.
86.
TUTSI ACCUSER #2
It is said that you work for the murderer
George Rutagunda.
Murmurs of agreement. Paul has heard enough.
PAUL
I confess. ( a beat) It's true I have a
deal with General Bizimungu. He was just
here. I worked out another money making
scheme for him. New arrivals will be
taxed at the gate.
Silence.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Do you know what my deal is with
Bizimungu. I pay him and he keeps you
alive. Anyone want to take their money
back?
PAUL pulls money from his pocket, hands it around, offers it.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Here, here take it. And you don't have to
pay your bill. I will move you into the
ballroom or out into the gardens.
He walks among them.
PAUL (CONT'D)
And, yes, I work with George Rutagunda.
I buy rice and beans, beer and soap. I
will have to visit his warehouse soon
because we are running out of food. Who
wants to come with me?
Paul holds the door open.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Anyone who wants to come with me stay
behind. If not, please leave.
They hurry out, duly chastised. But Odette and her husband Jean
Baptiste remain.
PAUL (CONT'D)
(laughs)
You are most certainly not coming with
me. You will get me killed.
JEAN BAPTISTE
You can't go to that place, they know
what you are doing here.
87.
PAUL
George will not hurt me, I am too
profitable to him.
ODETTE
What if he is not there?
Paul hasn't got an answer for that one. He leads them out.
Roger is asleep, on a couch in the living room, several kids sleep on
the floor.
TO THE BED: Where Tatiana suppresses bursts of laughter as Paul relates
the Gregoire story in whispers.
PAUL
As soon as the General left he came
running back. (mimics Gregoire) Help me,
sir, I have been possessed by a witch.
(Paul's own voice now) A witch you say?
(mimics) Yes, yes, I did not know I was
in that room. The president's room, why
would I be in the president's room? (own
voice) Indeed, the General asked me the
same. (mimics) Asked you what? (own
voice) Does Gregoire think he is
president now?
PAUL mimics Gregoire's whimpers of fear.
TATIANA
(laughing)
Stop, stop, we will waken the children.
Paul lifts the bottle of fine bordeaux, pours more.
PAUL
Lynch Bages, 84. Perfect with lamb, or
fine rare beef.
TATIANA
So where is the lamb?
PAUL
Maybe Gregoire and the witch ate it.
They both chuckle, then Paul remembers, a cloud of anxiety comes over
him.
TATIANA
What's the matter?
88.
PAUL
We're running out of beer and other
supplies.
She kisses him.
TATIANA
The foreigners abandon us and you do
inventory. You are so conscientious.
She kisses him again, tries to cheer him.
PAUL
I have to go out to get food.
TATIANA
Go out! Where?
PAUL
To Rutagunda's place. It is close by.
TATIANA
No, no.
PAUL
I have to, Tatiana, we are only as
valuable as the service we provide.
TATIANA
You cannot go alone.
PAUL
I'm not going alone. I'll take Gregoire
with me. He's a good Hutu, and he wants
to impress me now.
The lobby is deserted except for Gregoire now neatly dressed.
G
PAUL
regoire it is good to see you back to
work.
GREGOIRE
Please, except my humblest apologies...
PAUL
Don't worry. I have a job this morning. I
must go to visit my good friend George
Rutagunda. You know George?
Gregoire nods, impressed.
89.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Fetch the van.
They pass the gate, the policemen are asleep in the box.
The van passes along the deserted main road, past a wrecked car, over
broken glass, the fog swirls around them.
Then Gregoire hits the brakes.
In front of them, a makeshift barricade, long poles stretched across
two oil drums.
They wait for someone to appear from the fog: No one.
GREGOIRE
We should go back, sir.
Paul wants to agree, but can't. He opens his door.
PAUL
Let's go.
They drive past the barricade.
The van weaves through the fog-enshrouded streets.
hey slow to check road signs in the fog - on one a woman's dress,
shredded and soaked in blood, is draped like a banner.
The warehouse is filled with looted televisions, artwork, cars. George
points to the stacks of beer.
GEORGE
Everything is double the price now, you
do understand that?
PAUL
I need rice, beans, beer, and your best
whiskey.
G
EORGE
Beer yes, but no whiskey.
PAUL
You have no whiskey?
GEORGE
No whiskey, no spirits. Your rich
cockroaches at the hotel, they will have
to do without their scotch. Anyway, I
have bled that cow enough Paul.
92.
Paul counts out the Rwandan francs.
PAUL
What do you mean George?
GEORGE
Their money is no good to them. Soon all
the Ineysi will be dead.
PAUL
(incredulous) )
You cannot kill them all.
GEORGE
Why not? We are half way there already.
Paul's stomach heaves. He hides it, turns over the money, gets in the
van with Gregoire. George comes to the passenger window.
EORGE (CONT'D)
Let me give you a tip my friend, our
generals in the army say 'do not go near
the Mille Collines or they will send the
Belgian soldiers back here'. But the
generals are about to leave, and we will
be in charge. It is time to butcher your
cow for the meat. (a beat)
You can help us Paul. You have some very
important traitors at your hotel. The
politician Xavier. The liar Benedict. If
we were to get them, then maybe we could
let one or two cockroaches get away. You
understand, Paul.
Paul says nothing, but Gregoire has been listening very carefully.
PAUL
Let's go.
GEORGE
Take the river road back. It is clear.
The van takes off.
The fog has gotten thicker. They can barely see a yard ahead.
PAUL
Are you sure this is the river road?
GREGOIRE
I saw the sign.
93.
The van begins to bump erratically. Bump, bump, bump.
PAUL
Stop. You've driven off the road.
You'll put us in the river.
The van jerks to a halt.
Tatiana feeds the children - rice and beans. Paul arrives.
CHILDREN
Good evening, Papa.
PAUL
Roger, you have no greeting for me.
Roger tries to speak, struggles to mouth the words but nothing comes
out, as though he has forgotten. Tears form in his eyes.
PAUL (CONT'D)
There, do not worry, no tears.
He hugs him, puts him back at his food, then takes Tatiana's hand,
leads her to the door.
95.
TATIANA
(whispers) Where are we going?
They slip out.
Tatiana stops.
TATIANA
Please, Paul, why do we have to go to the
roof?
PAUL
It's alright. This is the only place I
can find some peace.
Oliver is on the stage, all the refugee guests are crowded into the
room he has a list in his hand.
COLONEL OLIVER
The UN has been notified that the
following families have received travel
visas from the following countries.
He reads.
COLONEL OLIVER (CONT'D)
Abukesu - Tanzania, Arumangu -Zambia,
Bawroanga - Kenya,
CLOSE ON: Elation among the chosen families.
COLONEL OLIVER (CONT'D)
Gituaranga - Zambi, Horangora - Belguim
CLOSE ON - Fear on the faces of families who realize they have missed
this alphabetical list, anxiety among the others.
COLONEL OLIVER (CONT'D)
Paramisambi - Zambia, Rusesabagina -
Belgium.
Tatiana kisses Paul.
COLONEL OLIVER (CONT'D)
Zamacanga - Ghana. A plane will land at
the airport tomorrow and the named
families will be flown to Kenya. Two UN
trucks will be here at 7 a.m. The named
families must be ready to leave then.
voice calls out.
98.
TUTSI WOMAN
Colonel, sir. Why not take us all to the
airport? We can wait there to obtain
visas.
COLONEL OLIVER
I can't do that. Our camp at the airport
is overwhelmed already. We could not
defend you there. You are better to stay
here and work to get an exit visa.
Oliver jumps from the stage, pushes through the crowd.
Paul's POV: Odette and Jean Baptiste are silently devastated. He pushes
through to the Colonel now surrounded by those who didn't make the
list.
PAUL
Colonel, Odette Camundu ... she must be
on the list.
Oliver shakes his head no.
COLONEL OLIVER
Paul, only those I called can get on the
trucks. I do not want to have to pull
people off, you understand?
Paul nods yes. Tatiana arrives beside him, pulls him aside.
TATIANA
I will not leave without the twins.
PAUL
We have to get out of here Tatiana.
TATIANA
Please, please try one more time.
PAUL
I'll try but we have to leave, with or
without them. I want you to promise.
She reluctantly nods yes.
Mr. Garindi waits nervously in the lobby.
Paul arrives.
99.
MR. GARINDI
It is dangerous to be here. The radio
says this is a nest of cockroaches.
PAUL
I need one last favor. Go back and get
the twins.
MR. GARINDI
(emphatic) No, it is impossible. That
side of town has been destroyed in the
fighting. The children are dead.
PAUL
How do you know?
MR. GARINDI
Everyone is dead there. The dogs eat the
bodies in the street. I have to go.
PAUL
I will give you my house.
The businessman turns back.
PAUL (CONT'D)
It's a fine house. Here is a paper.
Paul spots an elegant woman carrying laundry toward the elevator. He
runs to her.
P
PAUL (CONT'D)
Madame Kawunda, please.
Paul leads her over.
PAUL (CONT'D)
I need you to witness this signature.
(to the businessman)
Madame Kawunda is the Minister for
Agriculture. She is a very reliable
witness.
Paul signs, then hands the pen to the puzzled woman.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Please witness this deed.
She signs. Paul pushes the deed into the man's hand.
PAUL (CONT'D)
There, now go and find them. They have no
papers. No one knows they are Tutsi. They
will be alive.
100.
The businessman heads for the door.
PAUL (CONT'D)
You must be back by 7:00a.m. tomorrow.
Paul watches him go.
PAUL (CONT'D)
Seven, remember.
The Mr. Garindi leaves.
The lucky families are gathered: Tatiana and all her children; Xavier
and his wife; Benedict; and others.
Some of the unlucky ones peer around the door of the ballroom. A UN
officer stands in their way.
UN LIEUTENANT
Back. Everyone back. Only those with
letters of acceptance in the lobby.
Paul is in a horrible mood. The refugees in the ballroom try to push by
the UN officer. Paul joins him.
102.
UN LIEUTENANT
Back, please. Stay back.
PAUL
Zozo, tell those people to get back to
the ballroom. They can not be here.
Zozo scampers off.
PAUL (CONT'D)
What are we waiting for? Come on.
Paul herds the convoy people toward the door.
CLOSE ON: Gregoire watching from behind the front desk.
Through the doors we see the trucks being loaded.
Zozo returns.
ZOZO
Sir, the others want to speak to you.
Reluctant, Paul walks over to the ballroom dwellers.
PAUL
Yes.
TUTSI WOMAN
Good, sir we have letters, please take
them for us.
Paul reaches out for the letters, takes them, reads the addresses:
President Nelson Mandela. Pope John Paul. President Clinton.
TUTSI MAN #1
If you leave, we are certain to die.
ZOZO
I have a letter, sir.
Zozo hands Paul the letter. He studies the address. It reads "To the
great man Muhammad Ali."
thers crowd around.
PAUL
I will get you all visas. I promise. I
will get you out of here.
Paul's at a loss. He has to tear himself away.
fraid to look back, he heads for the convoy.
103.
Paul clambers on beside him.
He reaches Tatiana as Benedict sits
beside her.
PAUL
I have to stay.
TATIANA
No! Sit down now.
PAUL
I cannot leave these people. I will wait
for the twins.
Paul backs off. Tatiana tries to follow. Benedict grabs her.
TATIANA
Let go. Let me off this truck.
A commotion as she tries to get up.
TATIANA (CONT'D)
Let me go. Children get off.
104.
PAUL
I will follow on the next plane. Go.
UN Colonel Oliver sits next to a UN PAKISTANI DRIVER.
he convoy passes looters and small groups of Militia on the road but
proceeds unheeded.
The room is still littered with clothes, kids drawings, the personal
junk accumulated over four weeks.
Paul tries to arrange things, then collapses on the bed, paralysed with
doubt - Why did he do this?
Then the door bangs.
ZOZO
Boss, sir, quick, please, come quick.
The door springs open, Paul confronts Zozo.
105.
ZOZO
(breathless)
Sir, the radio, you must hear, it is on
the radio.
Paul and Zozo burst into the kitchen. The cooks and others are
clustered, listening to the radio.
RADIO ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
...Block the roads to the airport! The
cockroaches from the Mille Collines are
escaping! Xavier. The liar Benedict, the
traitor Rusesabagina's cockroaches. Stop
them now at Rue Don Bosco. Thirty
thousand francs for the head of Xavier!
PAUL
Dear lord, how did they know?
ZOZO
I saw Gregoire make a call, sir?
PAUL
When?
ZOZO
As the trucks go.
Paul bursts out of the kitchen - enraged.
Gregoire is at the front desk. Sees Paul - understands instantly.
Gregoire takes off, running for his life.
As the UN jeep turns a bend, Colonel Oliver SEES crowds of Interahamwe
swarming from beside houses, from gardens. They pull burning tires, old
furniture, junk onto the road.
The UN truck suddenly lurches, then slows.
The refugees from the Mille
Collines grow alarmed.
TATIANA
What's happening?
Paul is on the fax phone, begging.
PAUL
Please, General, I will give you money,
whiskey.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU (O.S.)
You said you had no whiskey.
PAUL
Please, I have money. They're driving
into an ambush, it's on the radio.
Paul enters, sees Zozo.
PAUL
What is this about no water?
ZOZO
It's true, sir, the water has been turned
off.
Paul enters. Odette, Benedict watch CNN on the TV.
PAUL shakes his head in disbelief.
PAUL
We can still get CNN here in hell.
A state department woman gives a press conference.
ODETTE
The Americans are talking about us.
ON TV:
STATE DEPT. OFFICER
From the reports we have received from
Rwanda it appears that acts of genocide
have been committed.
REPORTER
Excuse me, how many acts of genocide does
it take to declare this a genocide?
STATE DEPT. OFFICER
I, ahh, there is, ahh we have
terminology, that has been.
110.
BRIT REPORTER
You haven't answered the question. How
many acts of genocide before your
government will declare this a genocide?
STATE DEPT. OFFICER
I'm not prepared to, nor am I able.
Everyone in the room is dumbfounded.
Then Benedict begins laughing, a maniacal laugh, then he bangs on his
chest, and hoots like a chimpanzee.
BENEDICT
I've got it. I have the answer. Watch.
They all stare as he begins beating his chest, and hopping about like
an ape.
BENEDICT (CONT'D)
We must become mountain gorillas. Then
they can put us on the endangered species
list. Come on, try it. They think we're
halfway there already.
Benedict hops up onto a desk.
The door flies open. It's General Bizimungu.
He surveys the room, then points at Paul.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
Come here.
Bizimungu looks terrible, an alcoholic suffering D.T.s.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
Where are my supplies?
PAUL
I'm sorry, General. The cellar is empty.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
You have cockroaches dancing on tables
and you tell me the cellar is empty? Did
they drink my whiskey?
PAUL
No. We have no way of finding other stock
but I have money for you from the guests.
111.
Paul pulls a bundle of notes, hands them to the General.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
Rwandan francs! They are only good now
for wiping your ass. There is nothing
more I can do for you people. No police.
No protection. You're on your own.
The General storms off.
Paul walks through the lobby. He carries an ash tray to a trash can,
the futile task of a dedicated hotel manager on auto-pilot. He sees a
UN jeep pull up outside.
Paul, Zozo stand amongst the debris: a gaping hole in a wall. The room
is covered in burned note papers, menus brochures for Sabena's two
hotels, the Mille Collines and the Diplomat.
Odette appears carrying her medical bag.
ODETTE
Was anyone hurt?
PAUL
No. It was only a storeroom.
Tatiana is beside him. He opens the envelope, finds his makeshift house
deed and a note.
PAUL
It's from Garandi.
(reads)
I am sorry. There is no hope for the
twins. The old lady's house has been
destroyed.
Paul sleeps fitfully. It is almost dawn, then he sits up.
PAUL
The Diplomat!
Tatiana wakens, startled.
TATIANA
What's wrong?
PAUL
I have to go to the Diplomat.
116.
Paul is on the one working phone.
PAUL
General, sir. I am glad to find you. I
have found you some supplies.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
(O.S.)
Whiskey?
PAUL
The finest, and cognac, champagne. Come
and I will get them for you.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
(O.S.)
I'll be over.
PAUL
Bring back your policemen...
...But the line is already dead.
The jeep turns away from the Mille Collines front gate.
They travel at high speed along the road. Then the driver sounds his
horn, because...
Paul sees: A large crowd of Militia marching along the road toward the
hotel, waving machetes and sticks.
117.
PAUL
Where are they going?
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
They can go where they want. They are in
charge now.
PAUL
What do you mean, General?
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
We have decided to move the government to
Gitarama.
PAUL
When?
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
Today.
Paul arrives into the lobby of the Diplomat. Looters have stripped the
place bare. The convoy pulls up. General Bizimungu stands with his
pistol out. The looters see him and disperse.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
Maggots!
Paul enters the manager's office, followed by the General. It has been
stripped clean, except for the safe, which is pock-marked with bullet
strikes.
LOSE ON: Paul: he sees a big problem. The dial is damaged.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
Do your work.
Paul goes to the safe and turns the dials, tries the handle - nothing.
It is incredibly hot, and Paul is soaked with nervous perspiration, he
takes off his jacket.
PAUL
It might be damaged, General.
Bizimungu's look says: it better not be for your sake.
118.
Paul starts again, turns the dials more carefully, tries and opens the
safe door. CLICK.
He pulls it open, sees six bottles of Glenfiddich, four bottles of VSOP
brandy.
Bizimungu is joyous as Paul hands him a bottle
Bizimungu sits on a window ledge, takes a swig.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
Here. (offers) To celebrate.
PAUL takes a swig.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU (CONT'D)
You know what the Scottish call it?
PAUL
No.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
Ishca Baha - the water of life. I went on
a tour once of the finest single malt
distillery in the world. Have you ever
been to Scotland?
PAUL
No, sir.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
Wonderful country, wonderful golf. I
wonder - will I ever go back? What do you
think?
PAUL
I hope we all get to do many things. Can
we go now?
The soldier arrives with a box. He whispers to Bizimungu.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
(to the soldier) Pack those carefully,
put them in my jeep, and guard them.
PAUL
(looses his cool)
Please, General, call and put your
policemen back at the gate.
The soldier packs the bottles. Bizimungu pours into Paul's cup.
119.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
I am going to do you a great favor.
(studies glass) I am going to take you
with us to Gitarama.
PAUL
I do not want to go to Gitarama, General.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
You cannot go back to the hotel. The
crazy men are going there now. Better to
come with me.
Paul is now terrified.
PAUL
The Militia are at the hotel?! We must go
back now, General, please, for my family.
Bizimungu, now tipsy, drinks more.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
We are better here.
PAUL
(desperate, forceful)
Listen, you need me.
Bizimungu laughs.
PAUL (CONT'D)
You are a marked man.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
How so.
PAUL
The Americans, and the UN they have you
as a war criminal. You are on a list.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
I am on a list! What list?
PAUL
When the Europeans left, their soldiers
gathered lists.
Bizimungu grabs Paul.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
You lie.
120.
PAUL
If you do not help me, you will stay on
that list.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
I committed no war crimes.
PAUL
Who will tell them? You need me to tell
how you helped the hotel. The others who
have gone, they blame you for all their
misfortune. They say you led the
massacres.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
(nervous now) I led no massacres.
PAUL
You think they will believe you?
ENERAL BIZIMUNGU
You will tell them the truth.
PAUL
(defiant)
I will do nothing unless you help me now.
Bizimungu reaches for his pistol.
PAUL (CONT'D)
What are you going to do, shoot me? It
will be a blessing. Go ahead shoot. I
will pay you to shoot my family. You can
do nothing to me!
Bizimungu jumps up, grabs Paul, pulls him.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
You will tell them I did nothing.
Paul almost overcome with anxiety. Bizimungu worried.
Paul races into the hotel, past frightened refugees who flee.
Then Paul sees a face he recognizes.
It's Gregoire with the Militia! Paul ducks into the stairway.
IN THE STAIRWELL
He leaps the stairs four at a time.
He makes it to the third floor, pushing past frightened refugees who
race down the stairs.
ON THE THIRD FLOOR
He runs straight into a bunch of young Militia.
MILITIAMEN
Rusesabagina. Show us Rusesabagina.
They shove Paul along the corridor.
MILITIAMAN #1
Show us the manager. He wears a suit.
PAUL
They have him in the lobby, go quickly.
The killers race off.
Paul gets to his feet and runs.
Paul bursts in.
The place is a mess. And it's empty!
PAUL
Oh God, please Lord.
IN THE CORRIDOR
He careens out of the room.
122.
And sees Gregoire coming with a group of Militia.
GREGOIRE
That's him. That's Rusesabagina!
They charge toward Paul.
Then a roar of gunfire. The ceiling and walls around Gregoire explode.
General Bizimungu's men run up with weapons drawn.
HUTU SOLDIER
Get out, or I'll shoot you.
Paul rushes to the stairs.
More gunfire echoes (soldiers clearing the Militia).
AT THE STAIRS - Paul races upward, falls, pushes past others struggling
to get down.
AT THE ROOF - now, there are clumps of refugees who have fled up there,
including Xavier who huddles in a corner.
PAUL
Tatiana! Oh God. Have you seen Tatiana?
Paul runs to the edge of the roof, looks over.
SEES: bodies -
women, and children, still, on the ground beneath, by a
row of hedge.
PAUL (CONT'D)
(screams in agony)
TATIANA!
The bodies move, look up, it's not them. It's refugees hiding. Paul,
delirious with fear, runs along the parapet.
BELOW he sees soldiers herding the Militia.
He runs back to the stairs.
INSIDE THE STAIRCASE: He jumps four stairs at a time.
INSIDE THE CORRIDOR: Soldiers are chasing off the Militia.
TO HIS ROOM: Paul staggers in, crazed with fear. He looks under the
bed.
INTO THE BATHROOM - empty.
He's about to run out again, sees the connecting door to the adjoining
hotel room is slightly open.
123.
INTO THE ADJOINING ROOM: It's empty, then A WHIMPER.
FROM THE BATHROOM, he moves in, cautious.
IN THE BATHROOM: Nothing. He moves over, pulls back the shower curtain.
Reveals: A cluster of women and children, the older ones holding hands
over the mouths of the younger ones. And there at the back: Tatiana and
his kids.
PAUL (CONT'D)
It's alright, they're gone.
Tears, hugs, women tremble.
Paul now at the front of the truck
WATCHES out through a slice in the canvas.
SEES, the convoy pull out of the Mille Collines.
They travel along the road.
Turn a corner, and the truck slows ...
PAUL SEES: a great mass of Hutus fill the road:
Militia, kids, soldiers discarding uniforms.
No longer a mob, but a crush of Hutu refugees now fleeing toward them,
fleeing the advancing of the rebel army.
A crowd of Militia men wave their arms, shout at the trucks.
COLONEL OLIVER
Don't stop. Push through.
The driver reluctantly speeds up.
A break in the mass of Hutu refugees.
Then GUN FIRE ahead.
Children begin crying, it becomes infectious, spreading to Paul's
children, some of the women.
Then ahead, a gang of Militia men break from the bushes beside the
road.
They're running fast toward the truck, some carry rifles.
There's more gunfire behind.
The Militia are almost upon them now.
Colonel Oliver has his pistol drawn.
COLONEL OLIVER (CONT'D)
Keep going.
The Militia are at the truck.
But they run STRAIGHT PAST!
125.
As a platoon of Tutsi rebel soldiers (in bush camouflage and
red and
blue headbands) burst from the brush.
Pursuing, careful, professional.
PAUL
It's the rebels.
The crying stops. Silent disbelief.
PAUL (CONT'D)
We've made it!
Cheering breaks out. Children frightened again by the sudden euphoria
break into cries of joy.
A rebel soldier waves his AK 47 in the air.
