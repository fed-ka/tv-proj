      Casey rubs her arms, trying to stay warm.  This has to be the

                    Get out.

      Walsh shows him the gun on his hip.  The customer hurries

                    he punched a priest.  How he choked 
                    suspects out so many times people 
                    called him  Sleep Train. 

                                  CASEY
                    Is it true?

                                  WALSH
                    He closed cases.  He got things 
                    done.  The rest is just noise.

      Walsh pulls out a stack of CASH, pockets it.  Casey can t 
      take it anymore.

                                  CASEY
                    You re supposed to voucher that.  
                    And I m pretty sure you re not 
                    supposed to take it.

                                  WALSH
                    Did you have a partner in vice?

                    Everybody called him  Reach.                       The Unusuals/ Drama Pilot / by Noah Hawley9.


                                  WALSH
                    You sleep with him?

                                  CASEY
                    He had eight fingers.

                    Somebody killed  Reach  what would 
                    you do?

      Off her face: she gets it.

                    Whatever it took.

                    Exactly.

      A big room full of desks.  There is a portrait on one wall of 
      LIEUTENANT LITTLE, the squad commander.  DETECTIVE ERIC 
      DELAHOY, 32, sits at his desk.  He s holding his head in his 
      hands.  Delahoy was the kid in your middle school who started 
      shaving at eleven.  

      DETECTIVE LEO BANKS, 52, approaches.  He s a skinny nervous 
      guy who never takes off his Kevlar vest. 

                                  BANKS
                    I can t believe Sleep Train got 
                    capped.
                          (sees Delahoy)
                    Are you crying?

      Delahoy sits up, wipes his face.  He doesn t look good.

                                    DELAHOY
                    No.

                                  BANKS 
                    It s cause he owed you money, isn t 
                    it?  Well, you ll never get it back 
                    now.

                                    DELAHOY
                    I m not crying.  

      Banks holds out a phone message slip.

                                  BANKS
                    Some doctor called for you earlier.  
                    You got chlamydia again?                    The Unusuals/ Drama Pilot / by Noah Hawley10.


      Delahoy grabs the slip, crumples it up without looking.

                                    DELAHOY
                    Take off the vest.

                                  BANKS
                    I feel safer with it on.

                                    DELAHOY
                    You know, the first week I let it 
                    slide.  I thought he s going 
                    through a phase.  But now...

      Banks squeezes some Purell onto his hands.  

                                  BANKS
                    Most accidental firearm discharges 
                    happen in the workplace.

                                    DELAHOY
                    Or I could stab you with this 
                    letter opener.

      DETECTIVE ALLISON BEAUMONT enters with her partner, DETECTIVE 
      HENRY COLE.  Beaumont is the girl no one asked to prom.  Now 
      she carries a weapon.  Cole has one of those impossible Boy 
      Scout faces.  

                                  BEAUMONT
                    We canvassed the park.  If anybody 
                    saw Kowalski get iced they re not 
                    talking.
                          (she looks at Delahoy)
                    Are you crying?

                                    DELAHOY
                    For the last time.  I m not crying.  
                    I have allergies.

                                  COLE
                    It s okay to grieve, friend.  The 
                    Bible tells us that in times of 
                    crisis we should come together in 
                    prayer. So let s all bow our heads.

      He bows his.  The others just shuffle their feet 
      uncomfortably.

                                  COLE (cont'd)
                    Lord, take care of Burt Kowalski.  
                    He was a lost sheep, but he helped 
                    your children -- the troubled ones, 
                    the frightened.

      Sergeant Brown comes over.                    The Unusuals/ Drama Pilot / by Noah Hawley11.


                                  SERGEANT BROWN
                    Banks, Delahoy.  

                                    DELAHOY
                    Thank, God.

      Cole smiles at him, thinking Delahoy is with him.

                                  COLE
                    Amen.

                                  SERGEANT BROWN
                    I just got off the phone with City 
                    Hall.  Some Councilman s daughter 
                    was attacked.  First thing in the 
                    morning go over there and take a 
                      statement.

                                  BANKS
                    With all due respect, Sarge, we d 
                    rather work Kowalski.

      Sergeant Brown glares.  They know better than to argue.

                                  COLE
                    Sergeant Brown, we were just saying 
                    a prayer for our fallen brother.  
                    Perhaps you d like to join us.

      Brown turns and walks away.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Walsh and Casey climb the stairs of a five story walkup.

                                  CASEY
                    So what s with this restaurant of

                    Look, you re stuck with me for a 
                    few days.  Why not be civil?

                                  WALSH
                    Cooking helps me think.

                                  CASEY
                    Are you good at it?

                                  WALSH
                    Terrible.

      He rings the bell.  The door opens, revealing an extremely 
      under-dressed VERA MORAN, 22.  

                                  VERA
                    You re not the pizza guy.

                    And this isn t a porn film.  Put on 
                    a robe.

                    He s really dead?  Cause I ve had

                    When was the last time you saw

                                  VERA
                    Three or four days ago.  He never 
                    called, just came over.  Mr. 
                      Spontaneous.  That was Burt.

                                  WALSH
                    There s gonna be a funeral in a few 
                    days.  You re not going.

                          (hurt)
                    We were in love.

                                  WALSH
                    No, you weren t.  He had a church-
                    going wife with real breasts who 
                    doesn t need to know about her

                                  VERA
                    Don t look at me like that.  I go 
                    to church.  I ve got a mother.  I m 
                    not some homewrecker.

                    Vera, right?  I m looking around

                    Fine.  It s gonna cost you.

      Walsh takes out Kowalski s cash, drops it on the coffee

                    He was a good guy.

                    No.  But he was a cop.  And that 
                    means something.

      DETECTIVE ED ALVAREZ, 34, is in the cage, pants around his 
      ankles, giving the business to a late-twenties icy blonde 
      cheerleader type.  The pants around his ankles are expensive, 
      but the brain in his head is small and weasely.  The woman in 
      front of him is his wife, NICOLE BRANDT, 29, a bad girl from 
      a good family.

                                  NICOLE
                    Oh, yes! Officer!  Officer!

      They finish.  She shoves him away, pulls down her skirt  
      Alvarez pulls up his pants.

      She tucks in her shirt.  Her lipstick is smeared.

                    She won t say it out loud, but I 
                    think she s glad he s gone.  Not 
                    glad.  Relieved.  She didn t think 
                    Burt was good for me.

                    We re trying to figure out what he 
                    was doing in the park last night. 

                                  HANNAH
                    A case, maybe?  Burt didn t talk to 
                    me about work.

                                  HANNAH
                    No.  Sunday was the last time I saw 
                    him.  I ve learned not to ask where 
                    he goes when he doesn t come home.  

                                  CASEY
                    Did he seem upset about anything?

                                  HANNAH
                    You didn t know Burt, did you?  He 
                    didn t get upset.  Not around me.  
                    He saved that for the criminals... 
                    and his girlfriends.

                                  CASEY
                    You knew about them?

                                  HANNAH
                    That was Burt.  He d stop for a 
                    meal on the way to dinner.  No 
                    impulse control.  But he was good 
                    to me.  Every time he came home he 
                    brought me ice cream.  

                                  WALSH
                    He loved you.

                    I got the unusuals.

      She hands him some reports.  He moves his fingers to touch 
      her wrist.  There is a spark between them.

                      Emotionally separated.  Is that a

                                  BEAUMONT
                    Cole got an air freshener for the 
                    car.  It s pine scented.

                                  SERGEANT BROWN
                    I like it.  You smell like 
                      Christmas.  Maybe we can get coffee 
                    later?  Just to talk.

      Beat.  She nods.  There is a knock on the door.  Beaumont 
      pulls her hand away.  Alvarez sticks his head in.

                                    ALVAREZ
                    Got a minute, Sarge?

                    I ll go do that thing.

      She exits.  Alvarez is oblivious.

                    I should be primary on Kowalski.

      Brown looks at him.  Is that a threat?  He stands.

                      Kowalski s autopsy is in twenty 
                    minutes.  A guy who wants to be 
                    primary should probably think about 
                    going to that.

      A big eat-in kitchen.  Banks and Delahoy sit across from City 
      Councilman TONY HARBOR, 45, a blowhard.

                    You told my sergeant that your 
                    daughter was attacked.

                                    COUNCILMAN HARBOR
                    Not my daughter.  My daughter s 
                    cat.  Mr. Boodles.  He s dead.

                                  BANKS
                    A cat?  We re here because somebody 
                    killed a cat?

                                    COUNCILMAN HARBOR

                    Force, Detective.  Somebody could 
                    be targeting me or my family.  I 
                    expect the NYPD to take it 
                      seriously.

                                    DELAHOY
                    With all due respect, I think 
                    you re confused about what the  P  
                    in NYPD stands for.

      Harbor opens the freezer, takes out an oversized ZIPLOCK BAG.  
      He DUMPS the contents onto the table.  Thud.  We see the 
      frozen torso and severed head of a tan tabby.

                                    COUNCILMAN HARBOR
                    We found her on the doorstep last 
                    night.  Somebody cut off her head.  
                    This is a message.

                    This is your classic  Fatal

                      disgruntled paramour.  A few 
                      unreturned phone calls.  And now 
                      somebody s raising the stakes.

                                    COUNCILMAN HARBOR
                    I am not having an affair.

      A trickle of BLOOD runs from Delahoy s right nostril.  He 
      feels it, stands quickly before Banks can see.

      Delahoy stands in front of the mirror, head back, a clump of 
      wet toilet paper up his nose.  He opens the medicine cabinet, 
      checks out the pill bottles.  He finds some Vicodin, pops 
      two, pockets the bottle.

      Walsh and Casey enter to find DR. VIKRAM CHOWDARY, 40, 
      cleaning up after Kowalski s autopsy.

                    You just missed everybody.

                    New girl hates crowds.  Give me the 
                    summary.

                                  DR. CHOWDARY
                    Your partner was stabbed eight 
                    times with a single-edged weapon 
                    about four inches long.  I ll know 
                    more when we get the labs.  The 
                    first two blows were to the back.  
                    Then he turned, sustained defensive 
                    wounds to the hands and wrists, 
                    before being stabbed six more 
                    times.  Once in the neck. 

                                  WALSH
                    Stabbed in the back.  Had to be 
                    someone he knew.

                                  DR. CHOWDARY
                    I found this in his stomach.

      He shows them a key at the bottom of a metal bowl.

                    Maybe he swallowed the lock 
                      yesterday.

      Chowdary drops his autopsy tools in the sink.

                                  DR. CHOWDARY
                    Honestly, I can t believe he lived 
                    this long.  His heart was the size 
                    of a ham.  His liver was pickled.  
                    I counted six old bullet wounds.

      For the first time Walsh looks at Kowalski lying under a 
      sheet.

                                  WALSH
                    Is that him?

      Chowdary nods.

                                  WALSH (cont'd)
                    Give me a minute with him.

      The doctor and Casey leave.  Walsh goes over to his dead 
      partner.  He pulls back the sheet, looks at Kowalski, a giant 
      of a man even in death.  We see a hundred emotions on Walsh s 
      face; sadness, anger, loss, then resolution.  He will catch 
      who did this and they will burn.

                                                                          FADE OUT.

      Casey grabs Nicole none too gently and shoves her into the

      WOMEN S ROOM

      Casey locks the door behind them.

                    You re not gonna tell anyone.  
                    These guys find out where I come 
                    from, they ll never let me in.

      The war room.  On a giant white-board we see photos of the 
      crime scene, pictures of Kowalski, a timeline and a map of 
      the city.  Walsh is there, Beaumont, Cole.  Casey introduces 
      herself to the other detectives.  

      Sergeant Brown comes in with Detective Alvarez.

                                  SERGEANT BROWN
                    Alright settle down.  Let s go over 
                    what we know.  Ed?

      Alvarez steps up to the board.

                                    ALVAREZ
                    Kowalski was off-duty yesterday.  
                    He worked a four-to-twelve on 
                    Sunday.  Dispatch has him checking 
                    in last night around six, but we 
                    don t know from where.

                                  WALSH
                    We re pulling his credit card and 
                    cell phone records.  Plus the 
                    coroner says Kowalski swallowed a 
                    key before he was killed.  We need 
                    to figure out what it opens.

                                    ALVAREZ
                    Waste of time.  Stats show a string 
                    of muggings near the river.  Three 
                      African-American males with knives.  
                    I think these guys braced Kowalski.  
                    He showed his badge.  They got 
                    scared, killed him.

                                  CASEY
                    Except the coroner says he was only 
                    stabbed with one blade.

                                    ALVAREZ
                    What s your name again, sweetie?

                                  CASEY

                       sweetie?   Bold.                    The Unusuals/ Drama Pilot / by Noah Hawley26.


                                  WALSH
                    I think mugging is the wrong way to 
                    go, Ed.

                                    ALVAREZ
                    And I m primary, Joe.  

                                  WALSH
                          (to Brown)
                    What does he mean he s primary?

                                  SERGEANT BROWN
                    You missed the autopsy.  The police 
                      commissioner was there.  We have to 
                    put our best foot forward on this 
                    thing.

                                  WALSH
                    Alvarez is our best foot?  The guy 
                    spends most of his time filling out 
                    medal request forms.

                                    ALVAREZ
                    I do not.

                                  WALSH
                    We all know Kowalski had enemies.  
                    I think he met someone in the park 
                    and they killed him.  

                                  SERGEANT BROWN
                    HQ prefers a random crime scenario.  

                                  WALSH
                    Ah.  Now I see what we re doing.

                                  SERGEANT BROWN
                    Don t look so hurt.  You know how 
                    it works.  A guy like Burt, with a 
                      half-dozen suspensions and 
                      reprimands -- police brutality, 
                    graft -- nobody wants a front page 
                    story here.

                                  WALSH
                    Except Alvarez.

                                  SERGEANT BROWN
                    That s enough.  Get to work.  I 
                    want something concrete to tell the 
                    brass in three hours.

      Casey is getting a cup of coffee.  Beaumont comes in.

                    I worked vice three years.  Nobody 
                    ever asked me to dress like a 
                    hooker.  Then again I m not the 
                    most feminine creature.  My ass

                    So what s the deal with Walsh?

                                  BEAUMONT
                    The cook?  He s a weird one.

      Cole is at his desk.  Beaumont is next to him, on the phone.

                    Did you think about what I said

      Beaumont climbs up on Banks s chair.

                                  BEAUMONT
                    I don t want to talk about it.

      Beaumont unrolls the poster, tacks it to the wall.

                    Good thing I m not married.

                    But Sergeant Brown is.  

      Beaumont looks around to make sure no one heard, then gets in 
      Cole s face, whispers forcefully.

                                  BEAUMONT
                    I told you, we just had coffee.

                    It starts with coffee.  Coffee 
                    leads to alcohol.  Alcohol leads to

                                  BEAUMONT
                    Is that in the bible?  Or is there 
                      a newsletter you guys get?

                                  COLE
                    He s your superior.

                                  BEAUMONT 
                    No man is my superior.

      carrying a black plastic garbage bag.

      He drops the cat bag on his desk with a thud, then notices 
      the POSTER tacked over his desk.  We see it for the first 
      time.  It s a kitten in a toilet bowl with a pithy aphorism.

      Banks opens Beaumont s desk drawer, drops in the garbage bag 
      full of cats, closes it.  Delahoy shakes his head, goes into 
      the...

      Walsh is at his desk staring at Kowalski s KEY.  Casey sits 
      across from him.  Walsh stands, puts on his jacket.

      Walsh heads for the door.  Alvarez stops him.

                    Is it okay if I look around?

      She nods.  He starts opening desk drawers.

                                  HANNAH 
                    I don t know if it means anything, 
                    but the last few nights I ve been 
                    getting hang-up calls.  There was 
                    one last night around ten-thirty.  
                    I assumed they were from one of 
                    Burt s girls.

                                  WALSH
                    Always the same number?

                    When s the last time you slept?

      He shrugs.

                    Burt always liked you. 

      Walsh moves on to the closet.  He pulls out some banker s 
      boxes, goes through them.

                                  HANNAH (cont'd)
                    You understood him.  Not many 
                    people did.  They couldn t see past 
                    the gruffness and the posturing.  
                    His father used to beat him, you 
                    know. Put him in the hospital a few 
                    times.  Even after he grew up Burt 
                    had to sleep with the light on.  I 
                    don t know if you knew that.

                                  WALSH

                    I fell. I was trying to get up.

                                  BANKS
                    No.  You stood and watched that

                    Look, pal, my grandfather was 
                    killed by a Metro North train in 
                    1967.  He was fifty-two-years old.  
                    My dad died when I was fifteen.  
                    Cancer.  He d just turned fifty-
                    two.  My uncle dropped dead of a 
                    heart attack two years later.  
                    Guess how old he was?  
                          (beat)
                    You want to know why I won t take 
                    off the vest?  Why I wear flame 
                    retardant clothing and put that 
                      antibacterial crap on my hands?  I 
                    turned fifty-two last week.  So if 
                    you re gonna kill yourself, don t 
                    do it when I m around.  I got 
                    enough bad ju-ju already.

      Off Delahoy:  what can he say to that?

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Detective Cole is heating up a burrito in the microwave.  
      Walsh comes in, closes the door.

                                  WALSH
                    We needs to talk.

                                  COLE
                    Detective Walsh, I wanted to say 
                    I m sorry about Kowalski.  He was a 
                    sinner and a blasphemer, and he s 
                    probably roasting in hell, but he 
                    was also your friend.

                                  WALSH
                    Thanks.  That s sweet.  Listen, I 
                    got a call about an old case of 
                    yours.  A missing persons. Navan 
                    Granger.  Mean anything to you?  

      Cole goes pale.

                                  COLE
                    Doesn t ring a bell.

                                  WALSH 
                    Kid from New Mexico in the 
                    eighties.  Apparently Granger was 
                    wanted for questioning in a bank 
                    robbery.  

                                  COLE

      Beat.  Walsh studies him.

                                  WALSH
                    You know what?  Forget it.  They re 
                    faxing me the warrant and the 
                    original report.  I ll run it by 
                    the Sarge, see what he wants to do.

      He starts to stand.

                                  COLE
                    You can t do that.

                                  WALSH
                    Why not?

                                  COLE
                          (beat, reluctant)
                    Because I m Navan Granger.
                          (beat)
                    You can t tell anybody.  I grew up 
                    on a ranch outside Santa Fe.  We 
                    raised cattle.  But my dad drank 
                    and the bank was going to 
                      foreclose.  So my brother and his 
                    friends came up with a plan to rob 
                    the credit union.  I was eighteen.  
                    They told me to stay in the car.  
                    My brother goes in, gets shot.  I 
                    drive to New York and buy a new 
                    identity.  It was Nineteen-eighty-
                    eight.  Before I was saved.

      Walsh weighs this.

                                  WALSH
                    Did you tell Kowalski about this?

                                  COLE
                    Why would I tell Kowalski?  Listen, 
                    you can t let IAB see my picture on 
                    that report.  I have a wife and 
                    children.  It was a stupid mistake.  
                    Every day I ask the Lord for 
                      forgiveness.

      Beat.  Walsh nods, exits.  Beat.  Cole takes out his phone, 
      dials.

                                  COLE (cont'd)
                    We ve got a problem. 

                                                                          FADE OUT.

      Banks and Delahoy sit across from HAROLD SNAITH, 32, the cat 
      killer suspect.  He is a fastidious man in a bowtie.  A small 
      Xerox machine sits on the table in front of them.

                                    DELAHOY
                    You know why you re here, Harold?

                                  HAROLD
                    No.

                                  BANKS
                    I ll give you a hint.  What has 
                    four legs and poops in a box?

                                  HAROLD
                    I have committed no crime.

                                    DELAHOY
                    Then why d you run?

      Harold doesn t have an answer to that.

                                  BANKS
                    You ever take a lie detector test 
                    before, Harold?

                                  HAROLD
                    No.

                                  BANKS
                    Here s how it works.  You put your 
                    hand on the glass.

      With a little coaxing Harold puts his hand on the glass.

                                  BANKS (cont'd)
                    I ask you a question, like, is 
                    Harold Snaith your real name?  And 
                    you say ...

                                  HAROLD
                    Doesn t a lie detector have 
                      electrodes or something?

                                  BANKS
                    Answer the question, buttbag.

                                  HAROLD
                    Yes.  My name is Harold Snaith.                    The Unusuals/ Drama Pilot / by Noah Hawley43.


      Banks hits COPY on the machine.  A piece of paper comes out 
      with a Xerox of Harold s hand over the word TRUE written in 
      large black letters.

                                  BANKS
                      Excellent.  And were you born 
                    December eighth, nineteen-seventy-
                    five?

                                  HAROLD
                    Yes.

      Again Banks hits copy.  Again a handprint with  True  on it.  
      Now Banks holds up the photo of Mr. Boodles, the councilman s 
      cat.

                                  BANKS
                    Did you kill this cat?

                                  HAROLD
                    No.

      This time the handprint has the word  Lie  printed under it.

                                  BANKS
                    Harold.

                                  HAROLD
                    I didn t.  I swear.

      The machine spits out another copy.  LIE.

                                  BANKS
                    The machine reads minds.  Don t 
                    piss it off.

                                  HAROLD
                    This has all been a huge 
                      misunderstanding.  That was my cat 
                    in the alley.  She ran away.  I was 
                    simply trying to get her home.

                                  BANKS
                    Except we went to your apartment.  
                    No cat food.  No litter box.

                                  HAROLD
                    Okay.  You re right.  A friend 
                    asked me to house sit.  I left the 
                    window open by accident.  The cat 
                    escaped.  That s the truth.

                    little tongues?  But you like how 
                    it feels to break their necks.

      Harold smiles, sits back and crosses his arms.  He will say 
      no more.  Off Banks and Delahoy -- who is this guy?

                          (beat, thinking)
                    Can I keep this?

                                    LIEUTENANT LITTLE
                    Please. 

      They stop in front of THE PRECINCT. Casey opens her door.

                                    LIEUTENANT LITTLE (cont'd)
                    Casey.  
                          (she stops)
                    Let s keep this between us.

      She nods, climbs out.  The car drives off.  Casey realizes 
      something.  She pulls the TRANSFER ORDER out of her pocket.

                                  CASEY
                    Wait!  You need to sign this.

      But the car is gone.  Casey takes out her phone, makes a 
      call.

                                  CASEY (cont'd)
                    Walsh, it s Casey.  I know why 
                    Kowalski was spying on cops.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Sergeant Brown is at his desk.  Banks and Delahoy enter.

                                  BANKS
                    You wanted to see us, Sarge?

                                  SERGEANT BROWN
                    Where are we on the cat thing?

                                  BANKS
                    We got the guy in lockup, but he s 
                    not talking.

      Beaumont enters carrying two coffees, sees Banks and Delahoy.

                                  BEAUMONT
                    Oh, sorry.  I just...

                                  SERGEANT BROWN
                          (covering)
                    Do you have the sketch?

                                  BEAUMONT
                    What?  Oh, the sketch.  Huh.  No.  
                    Why don t I...I ll go get that.

      She leaves.  Banks and Delahoy look at each other.                    The Unusuals/ Drama Pilot / by Noah Hawley47.


                                  SERGEANT BROWN 
                    Women.  Where were we?

                                    DELAHOY
                    The guy s guilty, Sarge.  We just 
                    can t prove it yet.

                                  SERGEANT BROWN
                    Well, in six hours we either charge 
                    him or kick him loose.  So get a 
                      confession.  I don t care how.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Harold pounds on the door.  Banks and Delahoy watch him.  
      Beat.  Harold gives up, sits back, tries to wipe some of the 
      fish sauce off his coat.  He hears a cat s meow, looks up.  
      There is a CAT staring at him from the front seat.

                                  HAROLD 
                    Oh, God.

      A SECOND CAT appears next to the first.  Then a THIRD.

                                  HAROLD (cont'd)
                    No.

      The cats, smelling the fish sauce, attack Harold.

      ANGLE ON THE SQUAD CAR

      From Banks and Delahoy s POV.  They watch it rock back and 
      forth, as inside Harold fights off the cats.

                                  HAROLD (o.S.) (cont'd) 
                    Ahhh!!!  Get them off!  I ll talk.  
                    I did it.  I killed them.  Please.  
                    Get them off me!!!

      Banks smiles, drops the bottle in the trash.

                                    DELAHOY
                    Where d you get the cats?

                                  BANKS
                    My ex.  I know where she hides the 
                    key.

      Delahoy steps toward the car.  Banks stops him. 

                                  BANKS (cont'd)
                    Let s give them a minute.

                                                                            CUT TO:                    The Unusuals/ Drama Pilot / by Noah Hawley49.



      Casey sits at the counter.  Walsh is on the other side 
      looking at a photo of Kowalski and Chernienko.

                                  WALSH
                    How did you get this?

                                  CASEY
                    I have a friend at the Attorney 
                    General s office.  I think Kowalski 
                    made a deal with the Russian mafia.  
                    He was slipping them personal 
                      information about cops.

      Walsh breaks two eggs on the grill.

                                  WALSH
                    Doesn t matter.  Witness saw a 
                    black guy with a scar running from 
                    the crime scene.  Russians don t 
                    farm out their hits.

                                  CASEY
                    I m just gonna say this once, and 
                    then I ll let it go.  Corruption, 
                    adultery, drug use, violence - how 
                    can you say Kowalski was a good 
                    cop?

      Walsh breaks three eggs onto the grill.

                                  WALSH
                    Two years ago a seventeen-year-old 
                    girl goes missing.  Kowalski asks 
                    can he sleep in the girl s bedroom.  
                    He goes to her school every day for 
                    three months.  That s how he learns 
                    the girl was maybe involved with 
                    one of her teachers, a guy with a 
                    cabin upstate.  Two days later we 
                    have a body, and a confession.  If 
                    that s not a good cop, I don t know 
                    what is.

      She thinks about this.  He puts an omelette in front of her.  
      She takes a bite.  It s awful.  Walsh s phone rings.  When he 
      turns away to answer, Casey spits the eggs into her napkin.

                                  WALSH (cont'd)
                    Walsh.

      Alvarez sits in a plastic booth.  He s furious.                    The Unusuals/ Drama Pilot / by Noah Hawley50.


                                    ALVAREZ
                    Where the hell is this guy?  

                                  WALSH
                    You re kidding me?  He didn t show?

                                    ALVAREZ
                    I ve been waiting all night.

                                  WALSH
                    And you re in the White Castle on 
                    Queens Boulevard?

                                    ALVAREZ
                    You said Rockaway Boulevard.

                                  WALSH
                    Why would I say Rockaway?  The guy 
                    works at the one on Queens 
                      Boulevard.  Look, he called me an 
                    hour ago, pissed.  Wanted to know 
                    where the hell you were.  I told 
                    him you were coming.  He said 
                    forget it.  He s just gonna go 
                    straight to the New York Post, get 
                    all the glory for himself.

      Beat.  Alvarez can t bear the thought.

                                    ALVAREZ
                    Call him back.  Tell him I ll be 
                    there in half an hour.

      Walsh hangs up, smiles.  Casey pushes her plate aside.

                                  CASEY
                    Here s a question.  How does a guy 
                    go from playing shortstop to being 
                    a New York City police officer?

      Beat.  He looks at her, impressed.

                    I, too, am a trained detective.

                                  WALSH
                    Here s the difference between you 
                    and me.  You think people shouldn t 
                    keep secrets.  I think secrets are 
                    what keep us going.

                                  CASEY
                    I have secrets.

                                  WALSH (cont'd)
                    I m talking about things you don t 
                    want to admit, even to your self.

                                  CASEY
                    You say that like it s a good 
                    thing.

                                  WALSH
                    You know what a cop is to most 
                    people?  A garbage man.  We go 
                    through people s trash looking for 
                    clues.  We clean up their messes.  
                    That s the job.  It kills our 
                      marriages.  Our kids hate us.  We 
                    start drinking.  The secrets are 
                    what keep us sane.

      She leans in closer.

                                  CASEY
                    So what s your secret?

      We feel a tension here between them, the hint of a sexual 
      energy.  His phone rings, killing the moment.  He answers.

                                  WALSH
                    Walsh.
                          (beat, listening)
                    No.  I remember him.  We ll go.
                          (hangs up)
                    We got an ID on who s been calling

                    Low level drug dealer named Malcolm 
                    Nix.  Couldn t be more than 
                    sixteen.

                                  CASEY
                    What s a teenage drug dealer doing 
                    calling Kowalski at home?

      Off Walsh: he has no idea.

                                                                          FADE OUT.

      The door opens.  DORA NIX, 44, a well-dressed black woman, 
      sees Walsh and Casey.  They badge her.

                                  WALSH
                    We re looking for Malcolm Nix.

                                  DORA
                    Malcolm!

      MALCOLM NIX, 16 comes out of his bedroom.  He s in a 
      wheelchair.  Walsh and Casey look at him, a little stunned.

                                  CASEY 
                    Huh.

                                  WALSH
                    This is why I love working for the 
                    New York City Police Department.  A 
                    suspect in a wheelchair.  You think 
                    that d make it s way into the file.

      Malcolm looks at Walsh.

                    Malcolm stopped selling drugs after 
                    the accident.  He s getting his 
                    GED.  Detective Kowalski was 
                    helping him.  

                                  WALSH
                    Helping him.

                                  DORA
                    He came by every week, took Malcolm 
                    to a ballgame or the museum, helped 
                    him with his homework.  Malcolm s 
                    father ran out on us six years ago.  
                    He was a hitter.  Detective 
                    Kowalski said he knew what that was 
                    like.

                                  CASEY
                    You sure we re talking about the 
                    same guy?  Six foot four, big 
                    belly?

                                    MALCOLM

                                    MALCOLM
                    That boy was hardcore.  He took me 
                    to a crime scene, let me poke a 
                    dead body with a stick.  He said 
                    drugs were for weak-ass bitches.  
                    And I wasn t weak.  He said 
                    everybody I met was gonna want 
                    something from me.  And the key was 
                    to only give them what I wanted.  I 
                    said what do you want?  He said I 
                    want you to grow up and be good to 
                    your kids.  Crazy fool.

      Malcolm looks away.  Casey turns to Walsh.  

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Walsh and Casey are talking to Sergeant Brown.

                                  SERGEANT BROWN
                    Let me get this straight.  Kowalski 
                    was like a Big Brother.

                                  WALSH
                    Kid s dad used to beat the crap out 
                    of him.  So did Kowalski s.  I 
                    should have realized.  He always 
                    had a soft spot for hard luck kids.

                                  CASEY
                    Malcolm s mother said she didn t 
                    think her son was the only one 
                    Kowalski looked in on. 

      Banks and Delahoy enter.  All the cops in the bullpen 
      applaud.

                                  BANKS
                    Thank you.  Thank you.

                                  SERGEANT BROWN
                    Nice work on the cat thing.

                                  BANKS
                    Turns out the guy had a wife once.  
                    She lost a baby cause of some 
                    parasite she picked up cleaning the 
                    cat s litter box.  Bowtie wanted 
                    revenge.

                                  SERGEANT BROWN
                    I m already bored.

                                  SERGEANT BROWN (cont'd)
                    Let s pull all Kowalski s juvie 
                    cases.  See if he got close to any 
                    of the kids.

      Alvarez enters.

                                    ALVAREZ
                    Walsh!

      They turn.

                                  BANKS
                    Does anybody else smell burgers?

                                    ALVAREZ
                    I waited four hours.  Your CI never 
                    showed.

                                  WALSH
                    I don t know what you re talking 
                    about.

                                  SERGEANT BROWN
                    Hey, Alvarez, since you can t be 
                    bothered to come to work, I m 
                    making Walsh primary again.

      Alvarez lunges for Walsh.   

                                    ALVAREZ
                    You set me up!

      Banks and Delahoy restrain him.  Walsh smiles.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Casey sits at her computer.  Walsh stands behind her.  She 
      has a mug shot on-screen, an African-American male with a 
      scar across his face.  It matches the sketch from the park 
      witness.

                                  CASEY
                    There he is.  The scar matches our 
                    witness s description.

                                  WALSH
                    Deon St. James, twenty.  Kowalski 
                    busted him and his brother last 
                    year on a drug charge.  Deon got 
                    eighteen months upstate.  

      Casey scrolls through the record.                    The Unusuals/ Drama Pilot / by Noah Hawley56.


                                  CASEY
                    Look at this:  The brother was 
                    knifed in Joliet, died before they 
                    could get him to a hospital.  
                    Kowalski felt bad, wrote the kid a 
                    letter of recommendation.  He got 
                    out early. 

                                  WALSH
                    But instead of being grateful, Deon 
                    can t let the brother s death go, 
                    so he meets Kowalski in the park 
                    and gives him a taste of what his 
                    brother got.

      There it is.  The answer.  Walsh straightens.  The bullpen is 
      full, detectives sensing action, assembled around them.

                                  WALSH (cont'd)
                    Our suspect is Deon St. James.  Two 
                    felony assaults, one arrest for 
                      possession of a firearm.  

      The detectives arm themselves, grabbing bullet-proof vests 
      and shotguns.

                                  WALSH (cont'd)
                    He lives in the projects with his 
                    mother, so be careful.

      Sergeant Brown steps forward.

                                  SERGEANT BROWN
                    Alright, let s show this asshole 
                    what it means to kill a cop. 

      The cops head for the exit: ready for justice. 

                                  SERGEANT BROWN (cont'd)
                    Beaumont.

      She stops, comes back.  The room empties out.  It s just the 
      two of them now.  He adjusts her bulletproof vest.

                                  SERGEANT BROWN (cont'd)
                    Be careful.

      She smiles.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Cops appear from both sides of the hall, heading toward 
      Apartment 6A.  A SWAT guy with a battering ram is in front.

      ANGLE ON BANKS

      As he falls back, stops, watching the others approach the 
      door.  He is pale, sweating.  Delahoy comes over.

                                    DELAHOY
                    What s up?

                                  BANKS
                    I can t do it.

      Delahoy sees Banks s fear.  He nods.

                                    DELAHOY
                    Don t worry about it.  You ll get 
                    the next one.

      Banks nods, grateful.  Delahoy heads off after the others.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      The door BURSTS OPEN.  Walsh is first in.  Casey is right 
      behind him.  Alvarez, Delahoy and Cole follow.  The apartment 
      is a maze, piles of newspapers, broken furniture.  

                                                                            CUT TO:


      There are two doorways.  Delahoy enters, gun drawn.  DEON ST. 
      JAMES is standing near the window with a shotgun.  Delahoy 
      sees him.  This is the moment: kill or be killed.  Everything 
      slows down.  Deon raises the shotgun.  We see Delahoy make a 
      decision.  No chemo.  No radiation.  This is the death he 
      wants.  He closes his eyes.  Deon FIRES the shotgun.

      CLOSE UP ON CASEY

      As she appears in the other doorway.  She sees Deon shoot 
      Delahoy, and she SHOOTS DEON TWICE in the chest, sending him 
      backward onto the fire escape.  Walsh appears behind her.

      ANGLE ON DELAHOY

      Still standing.  He looks down.  There isn t a mark on him.  
      He can t believe it.  Cole approaches him.

                                    DELAHOY
                    No.  I m okay.

                                  COLE
                          (pointing)
                    No.  Jesus.

      Delahoy turns.  On the wall behind him, we see the OUTLINE OF 
      HIS BODY painted with powder burns and pellets. Over it, the 
      shotgun blast has created the image of a HALO.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Kowalski s wake.  All the detectives are there getting 
      hammered. Banks sits with Delahoy, Beaumont and Cole.  They 
      are examining Delahoy s NYPD windbreaker.

                                  BANKS
                    Not a goddamn scratch.

                                  COLE
                    It s a miracle.

                                  BANKS
                    There was buckshot in the wall.  
                    Are you saying the pellets went 
                    around you?

                                  BEAUMONT
                    Those are some magic pellets.

                                  BANKS
                    Or a magic windbreaker.

      Beat.  They think about this.

                                  BEAUMONT
                    I ll give you a hundred bucks for 
                    it.

                                  BANKS
                      One-fifty.

      Beaumont looks up, sees Sergeant Brown enter with his wife, 
      VANESSA, 31, pretty, well-dressed.  Beaumont s face falls.

      Nearby, Casey is standing with Walsh.  She is still wearing 
      his jacket, and is lost in thought.

                                  WALSH
                          (beat)
                    I got a sister, Evelyn.  Twelve 
                    years ago she was mugged.  The guy 
                    had a gun.  She said, what are you 
                    gonna do?  Shoot me?  My sister 
                    always had more guts than sense.

                                  CASEY
                    He shot her.

                                  WALSH
                    She s in a wheelchair.  And that s 
                    how a guy goes from playing a game 
                    to being a cop.

      She nods.  There is trust now.  Sergeant Brown approaches 
      with his wife.

                                  SERGEANT BROWN
                    You remember Vanessa.

                                  WALSH
                    Sure.  How you doing?

                    IAB s gonna want to talk to you in 
                    the morning, Detective.  But I 
                    wouldn t worry.  It was a good 
                    shoot.

                                  CASEY
                    Thank you, sir.

                                  SERGEANT BROWN
                          (to Walsh)
                    Don t you have a speech to make?

      Walsh moves toward the front of the room.  Casey goes over to 
      the bar, sits next to Beaumont, who s got three drinks lined 
      up in front of her.

                                  BEAUMONT
                    I ve been a Marine, a prison guard 
                    and a cop, so I m used to taking my 
                    clothes off in a room full of men.

                                  CASEY
                    I ll drink to that.

      They clink glasses.

                                  BEAUMONT
                    It s a lose/lose situation, skirt.  
                    If you succeed in becoming one of 
                    the guys, then you re not a woman 
                    anymore.

                                  CASEY
                    Detective Beaumont, you ll always 
                    be a woman to me.

      Beaumont smiles.  Walsh climbs up on the pool table.

                                  WALSH
                    Hey, settle down, you animals.

      The crowd quiets.  Walsh raises his glass.

                    First let s toast the new girl, who 
                    took her first door today.  Welcome 
                    to the Seventh.  It s all downhill 
                    from here.

      ANGLE ON CASEY

      As the others detectives stomp their feet and toast.  She is 
      flushed, proud.  Casey is one of them now, part of the 
      family, and she likes the feeling.                    The Unusuals/ Drama Pilot / by Noah Hawley61.


      ANGLE ON WALSH

      As the mood changes.  He holds up Kowalski s badge.  The 
      crowd quiets, sensing the shift.

                                  WALSH (cont'd)
                    This was a cop.  He kicked down 
                    doors.  He took bullets.  He didn t 
                    hesitate.  And now he s dead, and 
                    the badge gets retired.  Number 
                    5918.  It was Jerry Hanlin s before 
                    it was Kowalski s.  Hanlin was a 
                    detective at the twenty-third.  
                    Closed three hundred cases, retired 
                    in nineteen-eighty-seven.  Before 
                    Hanlin the badge belonged to Frank 
                    O Shea.  O Shea worked the Malcom X 
                    murder.  He tasked on Son of Sam.  
                    This is how it works.  You pass the 
                    badge down until it kills you.  And 
                    then you hang it on the wall.  

      ANGLE ON CASEY

      As she looks around at her new family -- Cole, Delahoy, 
      Beaumont, Banks -- each has something to hide, a secret life.

      For a split second she sees Lieutenant Little looking in the 
      window.  But when she looks again, he s gone.

      She puts her hands in the pocket of Walsh s jacket, pulls out 
      a piece of paper.

      ANGLE ON PAPER

      It s a singed label from Kowalski s storage locker.  Except 
      this one reads:  Detective Joe Walsh.

      ANGLE ON CASEY

      Why did Walsh take this?  What secrets is he hiding?  

                                  WALSH (cont'd)
                    So raise your glasses you 
                      motherless bastards.  Because a cop 
                    is dead.  And he won t be 
                      forgotten.

      The cops lift their glasses.  Casey watches Walsh take a 
      drink.  Can it be he s not the man she thought he was?

                                                                          FADE OUT.
