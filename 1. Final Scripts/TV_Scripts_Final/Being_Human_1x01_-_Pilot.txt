      Black.

                                    ANNIE
                    Everyone dies.
                              (beat)
                    Actually, can I start that again?
                              (beat)
                    Everyone deserves a death.



      INT. THE HOUSE. 2008. NIGHT A. 22:21.11

      Annie stares straight into the camera. Her eyes are fixed, 
      glazed and empty. One pupil dilated. The paramedics work 
      quickly and efficiently, one pounds her chest, one shines a 
      torch into her eyes. Nothing, no response. The paramedic 
      lifts her head and slips an oxygen mask over her mouth.

                                    ANNIE (V.O.)
                    Whether it s at home.

    The pool of blood spreads out from under her head across 
    the wooden floor like a rose blossoming.



      EXT. BATTLEFIELD. EDGE OF FOREST. DAY C. 1916. 06:16.22

      Mitchell. He s wearing the uniform of a first world war 
      captain. He stumbles out of a forest into a clearing. His 
      uniform is torn, his face streaked with blood. 

                                    ANNIE (V.O.)
                    Or in a war.

      Something up ahead makes him stop. A group of men, dressed     
    in the clean crisp uniforms of officers. They look    
      strangely out of place in the carnage and mud. 

      They are gathered around a body, a wounded soldier. They 
      turn. One of them we will later recognise as Herrick. They 
      spot Mitchell. They grin. And their eyes scorch black.



      INT. BATTLEFIELD. EDGE OF FOREST. NIGHT C. 1916. 21:04.33

      It s like a painting by HieronymusBosch.Blood, mud and 
      body upon body upon body. Mitchell among them. Dead, pale 
    and cold. Just another soldier, just another death.

                                    ANNIE (V.O.)
                    There s no getting out of it, no 
                    coming back.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)      "Being Human" Episode 1  SHOOTING SCRIPT  17th September 2008 2.
      CONTINUED:33

      Suddenly his body jackknifes and arches. He gasps - huge 
      gulps of air, like someone bursting to the surface from the 
      depths of the ocean. 

    He looks around, shocked, disorientated. The puncture marks 
    on his neck still just about visible.



      INT. THE HOUSE. KITCHEN. DAY B. 2008. 15:41.44

      Various relatives - Owen among them - stand around the 
      kitchen. All in funeral black. Shocked, mute and awkward. 
      Their grief and bodies too big for the tiny kitchen. 

                                    ANNIE (V.O.)
                    You can love if you like. 

      Annie stands to one side, looking strangely out of place in 
    her t-shirtand jeans among all the black. She pleads with 
    the people in the kitchen, waves her hands, shouts in their 
      faces. No one sees her, no one hears.



      INT. LAUREN S FLAT. BEDROOM. NIGHT D. 2008. 23:06.4a4a

      Mitchell, and a young beautiful woman we will later 
      recognize as Lauren. They are having sex. 

                                    ANNIE (V.O.)
                    And if you re very lucky you can 
                    beloved.

      Then Mitchell opens his mouth wide. Baring vampire teeth 
      that are long and sharp and wicked. Lauren s body shudders 
    and braces as he bites her. He drinks and drinks.



      INT. LAUREN S FLAT. BEDROOM. NIGHT D. 2008. 23:17.55

      Lauren is laying face down on the bed. Eyes open, but dead. 

                                    ANNIE (V.O.)
                    But everyone gets a death.

      Mitchell is slumped on the floor. Blood on his lips. Tears 
      running down his face. He beats himself with his fists. 
      Whack. Whack.Whack. A slave to his addiction.



      INT. THE HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. DAY E. 2008. 14:53.66

    An estate agent shows a young couple - the woman, pregnant -
      around the house. 



                                                                            (CONTINUED)      "Being Human" Episode 1  SHOOTING SCRIPT  17th September 2008 3.
      CONTINUED:66

      Annie, resigned to her condition now, sits dejectedly on 
    the sofa - her middle finger raised at the trespassers. 

                                    ANNIE (V.O.)
                    No one told me there was this.

    But it s an empty defeated gesture. The estate agent and 
    the couple, of course, look straight through her.



      EXT. WAR MEMORIAL. NIGHT F. 2008. 21:09.77

      Mitchell stands at the foot of the war memorial.

      Mitchell turns away and walks down to his car. And we see 
    the world has moved on a long way from that Flanders field. 
      People. Cars. Neon. Life.

                                    ANNIE (V.O.)
                    We ve driven off the edge of the 
                    map but we re still travelling.

    He climbs in and drives off.

                                    ANNIE (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    No one told me death sometimes 
                    cheats.



      EXT. MOORS. NIGHT G. 21:11.88

      We re looking down at George, on his back, on the ground. 
      He s in shock. Struggling to move, eyes rolling. His coat 
    is shredded at the shoulder and red with blood. 

    We pull back. Lying next to him is another figure. His neck 
    and chest are gone. Just gone. Torn away.

                                    ANNIE (V.O.)
                    But there are those that cheat 
                    death.

      There are sharp flashes of light, and more figures run into 
      frame. One has a shotgun, blasting at something off screen. 
      Another attends to George, writhing on the ground. 

                                    ANNIE (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Battered and bloody, they walk 
                    away from the train wreck or the 
                    big bad wolf.      "Being Human" Episode 1  SHOOTING SCRIPT  17th September 2008 4.


      INT. HOSPITAL. PRIVATE ROOM. DAY H. 11:12.99

      A brightly lit private room in a hospital. Sunlight washes 
      across George. He sits in a chair, surrounded by flowers 
    and Get Well cards. But there s something fractured about 
      him. Absent.

                                    ANNIE (V.O.)
                    But what s the cost?

      Slowly George stands, walks out.



      EXT. COUNTRYSIDE. DAY H. 19:16.1010

      Flat, barren, unforgiving land. George climbs out of his 
    car and starts to walk. It s as if he s in a trance. Or 
      drawn inexorably on by an invisible thread. And as he walks 
    he starts to undress. With difficulty he pulls his jacket 
    and shirt off. His shoulder is still wrapped in bandages. 

                                    ANNIE (V.O.)
                    They re scarred.



      EXT. WOODS. NIGHT H. 23:11.1111

    The transformation is horrific. Every bone in George s body 
      breaks as it stretches, contracts and reforms. The pain and 
    the brutality of it tears him apart, eviscerates him.

                                    ANNIE (V.O.)
                    They re transformed.

    The flesh on his face stretches as his jaw distends into a 
      snout. His back arches as his spine and shoulder blades 
      stretch and bow. George screams. Over and over.



      INT. HOSPITAL. CANTEEN. DAY I. 11:01.1212

      George in his hospital porter scrubs. He reads the paper, 
      sips his tea. He picks up a mini packet of biscuits and 
      without taking his eyes from the paper, offers them across 
    to the person sitting next to him. Mitchell.

                                    ANNIE (V.O.)
                    And what happens to these 
                    refugees?      "Being Human" Episode 1  SHOOTING SCRIPT  17th September 2008 5.


      INT. THE HOUSE. BEDROOM. DAY J. 16:42.1313

      Annie looks out of the bedroom window at the street below.

      George and Mitchell are just arriving, bags in hand. George 
      looks up at the house, looks at Annie.

                                    ANNIE (V.O.)
                    These flotsam and jetsam of 
                    death.

    He double-takes. Did he see something?

    It makes Annie flinch and move back out of sight. She 
      frowns. That was weird.



      INT. THE HOUSE. KITCHEN. DAY K. 12:32.1414

      George and Mitchell are in the kitchen. Talking, laughing. 
      George washes up. Mitchell, bored, flicks bubbles at him. 
      George tries to keep his cool, tries not to laugh. Don t do 
      that. I said don t do that. Stop. Please stop. I mean it. 

                                    ANNIE (V.O.)
                    Maybe, if they still deserve such 
                    a thing as mercy...

      Annie watches them, through the crack in the door. 
      Frightened. Mesmerised.

                                    ANNIE (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    ... they find each other.

    She just watches. And watches.

    AND WE FADE TO:

      BLACK.1515

      Then a sound. The put-put of a moped. A squeak of brakes.

      EXT. STREET. AFTERNOON 1. 15:01.1616

      A pizza delivery guy, 17 maybe, climbs off his moped, 
      trudges to a door and rings the bell. It flies open. 
      There s Annie. Beaming. 

                                    ANNIE
                    Hello!

                                    PIZZA GUY
                    12 inch  Mess of Meats ?

      Mitchell appears, scoops the pizza out of his hands, stuffs 
      some money into his fist and disappears again.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)      "Being Human" Episode 1  SHOOTING SCRIPT  17th September 2008 6.

                                    ANNIE
                    Thank you very much.

    The Pizza Guy turns to go. But Annie isn t letting him get 
      away that easily.

                                    ANNIE (CONT D)
                    So how long have you been 
                    delivering pizzas?

                                    PIZZA GUY
                    Uh. Couple of months?

                                    ANNIE
                    Could you drive a moped before or 
                    did they teach you?

                                    PIZZA GUY
                    They taught us. We had to drive 
                    round and round a car park.

                                    ANNIE
                    You like my top?

                                    PIZZA GUY
                    I suppose.

                    you get home and your girlfriend 
                    asks what you want for your tea, 
                    I bet you re like  Not pizza! 

                                    PIZZA GUY
                    I live with my dad.

                                    ANNIE
                    Yeah? What s your dad s name?

                                    PIZZA GUY
                    Duncan.

                                    ANNIE
                    Ha! Madness! I ll seeyalater.

    She shuts the door. Pizza guy doesn t move. What was that
      about?



      INT. THE HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. AFTERNOON 1. 15:02.1717

      Annie turns triumphantly to Mitchell and George, who are 
    sat watching TV.A dozen mugs of tea on the table. 




                                                                            (CONTINUED)      "Being Human" Episode 1  SHOOTING SCRIPT  17th September 2008 7.

                                    MITCHELL
                    He could so see you.

                                    ANNIE

      Mitchell and George nod. Respect. 

                                    ANNIE (CONT D)
                    Right. Who wants tea?

      George raises his hand... hold on... then:

                                      GEORGE
                    The milk s off.

                                    ANNIE
                    What happened there? What did you 
                    do? Did you just make it go off?

      George huffs. Irritated. He doesn t want to discuss this. 
      Annie looks to Mitchell for an explanation. 

                                    MITCHELL
                    Round the time he changes, his

      George turns to Mitchell, noisily devouring his pizza. *
      George watches, a little grossed out.

                    How can you still be hungry? You

                    power.

    He raises a glass of water to his mouth. There is a tremor 
    in his hand that makes the glass clatter slightly against 
    his teeth. He moves the glass quickly away, glances around 
    to see if the others noticed. 

                                    ANNIE

                              (suddenly raging)
                    You keep making tea! Every 
                    surface is covered with mugs of 
                    tea and coffee! I go to make 
                    myself some tea and I can t! 
                    There s no mugs, there s no tea! 
                    It s all been made! And you can t 
                    even drink it! You can t drink 
                    the tea but you keep making it! 
                    It s driving me INSANE!

                    I like my routine, it makes me 
                    feel normal. 

                                      GEORGE
                    YOU RE A GHOST!

                    Yeah so are you finished with 
                    these?

      George nods. A broken man. Annie gathers up the mugs and 
      trots off to the kitchen. Mitchell stands, starts gathering 
    his things to go.

                                    MITCHELL
                    Come on. 

      George stands, pulls out a little sports bag.

                                    ANNIE
                    You both off?

                                    MITCHELL
                    Yeah, we ve got work, then it s 
                    his time of the month.

                                    ANNIE
                    Oh. Ok.

    She moves forward, trying to delay their exit a little

                                    ANNIE (CONT D)
                    Tell you what, I don t miss all 
                    that. I d have to sit on the sofa 
                    with a hot water bottle and Pride 
                    and Prejudice. If anyone said 
                    anything, I d bite their head 
                    off! 
                              (beat)
                    Though I guess in your case 
                    that s actually a possibility. 

      George just looks at her. Thanks. Mitchell sniggers.

                                    MITCHELL
                    We ll see you later.

    And they go. Annie looks around at the house, suddenly 
      empty and lifeless. 



1818EXT. HOSPITAL. LATE AFTERNOON 1. 15:56. 

    The hospital. Patents and visitors and doctors mill about.

                                    MITCHELL (V.O.)
                    Y know, you should be pleased for 
                    her. She can be seen by other 
                    peoplenow, she can step out of *
                    the house. That s down to us.    "Being Human" Episode 1  SHOOTING SCRIPT  17th September 2008 10.


      INT. THE HOSPITAL. STAFF ENTRANCE. LATE AFTERNOON 1. 15:571919

      Mitchell and George trudge into work. They clock in / sign 
    in / whatever.They lower their voices.*

                                    GEORGE*
                    Why is she here anyway? Other *
                    people move in somewhere, they *
                    have damp, they have woodlice. *
                    Why do weget Casper?*

                                      MITCHELL*
                    We ve been over this. There must *
                    be something unresolved about her *
                    death. That s what s keeping her *
                    here.*

                                    GEORGE*
                    It s not fair...*

                                      MITCHELL*
                    Exactly. Whatever happened to *
                    her, it was unfair. Unjust.*

                                    GEORGE*
                    No, I mean her being here is *
                    unfair. The amount of washing up *
                    she generates...*

      Mitchell rolls his eyes, he isn t getting into this.*

                                      MITCHELL*
                    So what you gonnado?*

                                      GEORGE
                    I ll work for an hour, then say 
                    there s a family emergency and 
                    scoot down to the isolation room 
                    before the moon comes up. 

                                    MITCHELL
                    Cool. I ll come and let you out 
                    in the morning.

      There is a gesture between them, a hug maybe, something 
      unspoken. This is a familiar routine now but Mitchell knows 
    the horrors his friend is about to endure.

      George peels off. Mitchell is by a couple of screens. Flat 
      grey footage from CCTVcameras dotted around the hospital. 
      Something catches his eye. 

    One camera looks on to an empty corridor. Lift doors. They  
      open. No one gets in, no one gets out. The empty lift just 
      sits there. The doors close again. Mitchell watches the 
      screen.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    "Being Human" Episode 1  SHOOTING SCRIPT  17th September 2008 11.

2020INT. HOSPITAL. CORRIDOR. LATE AFTERNOON 1. 16:04. 

      Mitchell walks down a corridor. It's empty. A patient 
      maybe, wandering along. Mitchell looks around. It's as if 
      he's trying to find the thinnest trace of a scent on the 
      air, or a distant sound. 



      INT. HOSPITAL. WARD. LATE AFTERNOON 1. 16:11.2121

      A ward, with private rooms at the end. Mitchell slips down 
    the aisle, past the nurse at the Nurse's Station. There's 
      nothing here. Nothing out of the ordinary. But his eye is 
      drawn to a room, the door firmly shut, the blinds down.



      INT. HOSPITAL. PRIVATE ROOM. LATE AFTERNOON 1. 16:12.2222

      There's one bed in the room, one patient. Deeply asleep, 
      wired up to beeping monitors. And standing over him is 
      Seth. He looks up at Mitchell as Mitchell enters. They keep 
      their voices low.

                                    SETH
                    Jesus, Mitchell, how are you 
                    supposed to find anywherein this 
                    place? I followed the signs for 
                    Intensive Care, I ended back 
                    where I came in!

                                    MITCHELL
                    What are you doing here, Seth?

                                    SETH
                    Herrick thinks recruitment should 
                    be more tactical. People with 
                    money and influence. No more 
                    tramps or people who fall asleep 
                    on the Night Bus. Our gatherings 
                    are starting to look like the 
                    seating area in Argos.
                            (a grin)
                    You had the right idea with 
                    Lauren.  Least she s easy on the 
                    eye.

      Seth takes his coat off, preparing to feed. 

                                    SETH (CONT'D)
                    This guy, I think he s on the 
                    council or something...




                                                                            (CONTINUED)    "Being Human" Episode 1  SHOOTING SCRIPT  17th September 2008 12.

                                    MITCHELL
                    Leave him alone.

                                    SETH
                    What, you want to share?  

                                    MITCHELL
                    No, I ve... I vestopped.

                                    SETH
                    Yeah we ve had this conversation. 
                    What blood type is he anyway?
                              (thechart)
                      A Positive. Hmmm.A bit Jacob s 
                    Creek-yfor me, but there you go.

                                    MITCHELL
                    Move away from the bed, Seth.

      Seth stops, looks at Mitchell. Fuck, he s serious...

                                    SETH
                    Remember that guy, the student. 
                    When was it? 58, 59? Or you and 
                    Herrick and the girl in the 
                    hotel? What about that couple in 
                    the park? You can t stop, 
                    Mitchell. This is what we are.
                            (a grin)
                    Come on. Just a taste. A sip. 

    The temptation, the urge to drink, is so strong Mitchell 
      literally shudders. This is torture. He has to wrench the 
      words out.

                                    MITCHELL
                      I said...leave him alone...

      Seth s grins fades into a sneer of contempt.

                                    SETH
                    Or what? Look at you, when was 
                    the last time you fed? You re 
                    shaking, you re sweating. You 
                    really think you re up to getting 
                    busy with me?

      Mitchell says nothing. Seth snorts - he thought as much.

                                    SETH (CONT D)
                    Now get into character and watch 
                    the door. I ve got a job to do.

    He pulls the sheet down, exposing the patient s neck. 
      Mitchell grips Seth by the arm and tries to yank him back 
      from the bed. Seth swings his arm back, knocking Mitchell s 
      hand away. Mitchell slams Seth back into the wall. 



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    "Being Human" Episode 1  SHOOTING SCRIPT  17th September 2008 13.
      CONTINUED: (2)2222

      They face each other, nose to nose. Mitchell clearly had 
      more fight in him than Seth suspected.

                                    MITCHELL
                    I don t care if the coolest kid 
                    in school is suddenly your mate, 
                    Seth. To me you ll always be that 
                    milky little creep who smells of 
                    biscuits. Tell Herrick the 
                    hospital is out of bounds.

    He lets Seth go. Seth says nothing. Then shrugs, smiles his 
      yellow smile and heads for the door. He stops.

                                    SETH
                    A word of warning. One  friend  
                    to another. It s cold out there 
                    without us.

      Seth leaves. Mitchell takes a deep breath. And another.



      INT. THE HOSPITAL. CORRIDOR. EARLY EVENING 1. 17:16.2323

      George is chatting to a nurse - Becca. She s in her 20s, 
      pretty, but homesick and a little shy. She has an armful of 
      laundry, George pushes an elderly man in a wheelchair

                                    BECCA
                    Yeah, just outside Leeds. I mean, 
                    I loved it, but I thought  if I 
                    don t get out now...  Coz mates 
                    of mine, some are married or with 
                    kids, and they ve just stayed.

      They ve stopped by a little makeshift shrine. Cards and 
      photos and flowers (withering a little now) are pinned and 
      pasted to a wall. One photo dominates and provides the 
      focal point. A woman in her 20s.Beautiful. Happy. Utterly 
      alive and vibrant. This is Lauren. George looks at the 
      flowers and cards. Becca watches him.

                                    BECCA (CONT D)
                    Who was she?

                                      GEORGE
                    Lauren. Worked in A+E.

                                    BECCA
                    When did she die?

                                      GEORGE
                    A couple of months before you 
                    started. Heart attack. She was 
                    20, 21? I know, mad, isn t it. 



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    "Being Human" Episode 1  SHOOTING SCRIPT  17th September 2008 14.

    He looks at the main photo. Lost for a moment.

                                      GEORGE (CONT D)
                    She was beautiful...

                                    BECCA
                    Look. They re doing a little 
                    memorial thing. Planting a tree.

      Mitchell approaches them quickly.

                                    MITCHELL
                    George.

                                    BECCA
                              (beams, smitten)
                    Hiya, Mitchell.

                                    MITCHELL
                    Yeah, hi.
                              (toGeorge)
                    Shouldn t you be going?

                                      GEORGE
                              (looks at his watch)
                    Shit.
                              (to the old man)
                    Sorry. 
                              (toBecca)
                    Shit, I ve got to be somewhere. 
                    Kind of now. 

    He quickly takes the laundry from Becca, pops it on the old 
      man s lap and hands the wheelchair over to Becca.

                                    BECCA
                              (to Mitchell)
                    I ve got a break in 10 minutes.

                              (just GO)
                    In your own time.

      George scurries off. Sneaks a glance back at Becca as he 
      goes.

      INT. STAIRWELL / ISOLATION ROOM. EARLY EVENING 1. 17:22.2424

      George trots down the stairs towards the isolation room. 
      Voices ahead make him stop. Shit, there are people in 
      there... He creeps closer to the door. Two maintenance men 
    are clearing out the battered old desks and boxes. 

                                      GEORGE
                    Hello? Uh, what are you doing?

                                      MAINTENANCE GUY
                    This is gonnabe the site office 
                    when they start building the 
                    admin wing. You should have seen 
                    the state of it! The furniture 
                    all smashed, these marks on the 
                    walls... They been keeping the 
                    mentalsin here or what?

      George looks at his watch and stumbles back up the stairs. 

    The other workmen is brandishing a drill. He rams it into 
    the wall. The growl and squeal of the drill is magnified. 
      Then it changes, into a scream of metal and wild creatures. 
      Deafening and painful, like a giant engine grinding and 
      roaring. The kind of sound that swallows your own scream 
      whole.

      FADE TO:

      Mitchell s face. A brittle smile fixed in place as he tries 
    to ignore the fury of the scream inside him. Something else 
      cuts through the noise. A voice. Insistent.

                                    BECCA (O.C.)
                      Mitchell... Mitchell.

    He blinks. Snapped back to reality. Bolsters the smile. The 
      scream fades out and we pull out to find ourselves in...



      EXT. HOSPITAL. CANTEEN. EARLY EVENING 1. 17:47.2525

      Mitchell and Becca having coffee.

      Mitchell swills his coffee in his cup. Choosing his words.

                    But in answer to your question: 
                    no. My relationships have always 
                    followed a similar pattern. 
                    They've been brief, they... 
                    haven't ended well. That has to 
                    change. I can't keep hurting 
                    people. I just want something 
                    good and normal. But there are 
                    those who say I can't do that.

      Mitchell looks up. George has scurried into the canteen, 
    his eyes searching frantically for Mitchell. Mitchell 
      stands, excuses himself from Becca and trots over.

      George stumbles into the clearing. Stops dead. There s a 
      family there. Parents and two kids. Camping. A tent and 
      stove. They stare at George.

                                      GEORGE
                    Hi, how are you?

    He turns, crashes back into the woods.



      EXT. WOODS. EVENING 1. 18:14.3030

      George scrambles down a bank to a dried up river bed. This 
      will do. He turns. Two men, locked in an embrace, are 
      staring at him.

                                      GEORGE

    The man turns. No one there.

      Another clearing. This time, mercifully deserted. George 
      tries to catch his breath. He starts to pull his shirt off.

                    George Sands.

      George spins around. All he can see in the fading daylight 
    is the silhouette of a man, maybe 20 yards away. A thick 
      dark shape in the gathering gloom.

                    Cutting it a bit fine, aren t 
                    you, George?

      George is speechless. Frozen with shock. The figure takes a 
      step towards George. It breaks the spell and George 
      scrambles back into the woods.

      Mitchell peers out of the window. There s George. Pounding 
      back towards the car. He yanks open the door, scrambles in.

      Mitchell isn t going to argue. He starts the car and speeds 
      off. George looks back at the woods. It s as if he can 
      still feel that shadowy figure watching him.



      INT. THE HOUSE. LIVING ROOM / KITCHEN. EVENING 1. 18:47.3535

      Annie is in the kitchen, pouring hot water into a line of 
      mugs. Suddenly the front door bursts open and George and 
      Mitchell pile in. Annie walks through to the living room.

                    It s coming.



      EXT. THE HOUSE. EVENING 1. 18:49.3636

      Mitchell steps outside. Music starts thumping dully through 
    the walls. At least the soundproofing is pretty good. 
      Mitchell locks the front door.



      INT. THE HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. EVENING 1. 18:59.3737

      Annie is in the kitchen, looking at George through the 
      serving hatch. George has stripped. He just stands there 
      shivering, his hands over his groin. The atmosphere is 
      tense and tight as a drum. But oddly awkward too. Despite 
    the pounding music. There s nothing to do but wait.

    and stumble backwards.

      Mitchell is sat ion the doorstep. Now, just audible under 
    the throb of the music, are George s screams. It makes 
      Mitchell wince and shudder.

      From the expression on Annie s face, the transformation has 
      obviously taken hold. We hear George screams as the curse 
      thunders through him. 

      From the kitchen, Annie watches. Hypnotized, but horrified. 
      It s awful to watch every shred of George s humanity torn 
    so painfully away. She screws her eyes shut.     "Being Human" Episode 1  SHOOTING SCRIPT  17th September 2008 22.


      EXT. THE HOUSE. NIGHT 1. 19:42.4040

      Mitchell flinches at the roar from inside. He turns and 
      Annie is sitting on the step next to him. She looks 
      distressed and pale. Even more than usual. 

                                    ANNIE
                    He s gone.

      Mitchell says nothing. He settles back against the door, 
      getting comfy for the long night ahead of them. Annie sits, 
      hunched and shaken. Through the walls, the dull pulse of 
    the music and, if you listen really hard, the roars and 
      howls of a monster.

      INT. THE HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. MORNING 2. 06:53.4242

    The front door eases open and Mitchell and Annie peer in.

      Imagine the aftermath of the biggest wildest party in the 
      world, then throw a hand grenade into that. What s left 
      wouldn t look dissimilar to the living room now. Everything 
    is upside down. Some of the furniture has been atomized. 
      Even the wallpaper is shredded. And lying amid the 
      wreckage, naked and unconscious, is George.

      Later. Dressed now, George comes down the stairs. He stops 
    and stares. Mitchell and Annie have cleared all the 
      wreckage out of the living room, leaving it cavernous and 
      echoing. George looks around. They ve lost so much.

                                      GEORGE
                    My God. What did it do?

                                    MITCHELL
                    We ve salvaged what we can. But 
                    there s about 10 bin bags of crap 
                    and wreckage stashed in my 
                    bedroom. I m sensing a trip to 
                    Ikea.And you know my feelings 
                    about that.

                    Look, why don t you two go out. 
                    Leave the rest to me. It s the 
                    least I can do.

      Mitchell and Annie exchange glances. Mitchell rolls his 
      eyes. Annie tries not to literally squeal with excitement.

                                    ANNIE
                    Owen rang.

                                    MITCHELL
                    He s over from Saudi for a few  
                    months and wants to meet us.

                                    ANNIE

                              (proudly)
                    The others all found the place 
                    strangely unwelcoming.

                                    MITCHELL
                    You re like one of the villains 
                    in ScoobyDoo, scaring people 
                    away from the deserted funfair. 

                                    ANNIE
                    I d have got away with it too if 
                    it weren t for you meddling kids.

      George gestures around at the conspicuously empty room.

                                      GEORGE
                    Why didn t you put him off?!

                    clutter and debris of 21st 
                    century living. To think having

                    happened and let their 
                    imaginations run away with them.

                    You... know? About my fianc e.*

                                    MITCHELL
                    A little. Just what the estate 
                    agent said. 

                                    OWEN
                    I ve hardly been back since. You 
                    can imagine, it s still kind of 
                    weird being here.

      Mitchell lowers his voice, aware of Annie upstairs.

                                    MITCHELL
                    What happened exactly? If you 
                    don t mind me asking.

                                    OWEN
                    We d literally just moved in, we 
                    were still living out of boxes. 
                    It was dark, I hadn t sorted out 
                    the wiring yet. She was at the 
                    top of the stairs and... They 
                    said she must have fallen 
                    awkwardly. 

                                    MITCHELL
                    What was she like?

      Owen is a little taken aback by the question. But something 
      about Mitchell, his calm assurance, makes Owen open up. 

                                    OWEN
                    Annie? She was... extraordinary. 
                    She was kind. And funny. Cleverer 
                    than she thought she was... 
                            (a sad smile)
                    And she was mine.

                              (beat)
                    I believe people can leave an 
                    echo, in a place where they were. 
                    I know the tennantsbefore us 
                    said they could detect something. 
                    Maybe that s what it was.

                                    OWEN
                    They said it was creepy.

                                    MITCHELL
                    It s not, it s not creepy. It s 
                    good. It s happy. We like it.

      Owen drinks. He nods. Thank you. George comes downstairs.

                                    OWEN
                    What was it?

                                      GEORGE
                    What? Oh a... pigeon.

                                    OWEN
                    A pigeon?

                                      GEORGE
                    Must have left a window open.

                                    OWEN
                    Have you got rid of it?

                                      GEORGE
                              (beat)

                                    MITCHELL
                    You killed it?

                                      GEORGE
                    With a shoe.

      Mitchell is positioned behind Owen. He throws his arms up 
    in surrender - Ok, that s it, I give up. 

                                    OWEN
                    You know what? I should... I 
                    should be going.

                                    MITCHELL
                              (jumps up)
                    It was lovely to meet you. Like I 
                    said, it s great, we re really 
                    happy here.    "Being Human" Episode 1  SHOOTING SCRIPT  17th September 2008 30.


      INT. THE HOUSE. UPSTAIRS LANDING. MORNING 2. 10:06.4949

      Annie peeps around the corner, down the stairs. She can 
      just about see Owen s feet and legs. 

                                    OWEN (O.S.)
                    Thanks for the drink. Any 
                    problems, you ve got my number.

                                    MITCHELL (O.S.)
                    Cool. Lovely to meet you.



      INT. THE HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. MORNING 2. 10:07.5050

      Mitchell closes the door and turns to George.

                                    MITCHELL
                    How dyou do that, stay so calm? 

                                      GEORGE
                    Ok, shut up.

                                    MITCHELL
                    You re a spy, aren t you. I mean 
                    you ve clearly had training. 
                    Because the way you held it 
                    together there, it was chilling. 

      Annie has walked down from upstairs. Mitchell and George 
      watch her nervously, as if she might shatter into a 
      thousand pieces at any moment. 

                                    MITCHELL (CONT D)
                    He loved you very much, Annie. 
                    The way he talked about you... 
                    You made him very happy.

                                      GEORGE
                              (beat)
                    Did you ask about the tap?

      Mitchell turns imploringly to George - PLEASE stop talking.

                                    ANNIE
                    Is this his?

                                    MITCHELL
                    What?

                                    ANNIE
                    This bottle. Was it his?

                                    MITCHELL
                    Yeah.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    "Being Human" Episode 1  SHOOTING SCRIPT  17th September 2008 31.

      Annie picks up Owen's beer bottle. Touches the rim to her 
      lips. Her lips to his.  



      EXT. THE HOSPITAL. EVENING 2. 19:54.5151

      Establishing shot. The entrance to the hospital. Dribsand 
      drabs of people going in and out of the hospital. Late 
      visitors and the night shift arriving.



      INT. HOSPITAL. CANTEEN. EVENING 2. 19:55.5252

    The first thing Mitchell sees when he enters the canteen is 
    the crowd of nurses, doctors and porters, gathered around a 
      table, laughing and clapping. He frowns, what s going on? 

    He draws nearer and his face drops. There at heart of the 
      crowd is Herrick. One of the vampire officers from the 
      World War 1 battlefield.

    But this time, we see that Herrick is a policeman.

      He s performing some coin tricks. The crowd lap it up. 

                                    HERRICK
                    Now watch. You re not watching.

      Cries of  We are! We are! 

      Herrick holds a coin between his thumb and forefinger. A 
      flutter of hands. The coin is gone. Some  Ooohs from the 
      crowd. Herrick sweeps his hand across the table, and a 
      shower of coins clatter and bounce from his palm.

      Squeals and applause from the crowd. 

      Herrick watches as some of them scrabble around the table 
    and chairs for the coins, his expression a mixture of 
      curiosity and detachment. 

    He looks up and spots Mitchell watching from the sidelines. 

                                    HERRICK (CONT D)
                    Ah, sorry, guys. There s my 
                    friend.

      Cries of  No!   Don t go!  Herrick laughs.

                                    HERRICK (CONT D)
                    Will you stop? Another time, I 
                    promise.

      Herrick and Mitchell watch the crowd disperse, chattering 
      happily about the little show. 



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    "Being Human" Episode 1  SHOOTING SCRIPT  17th September 2008 32.

                                    MITCHELL
                    You didn t get my message? This 
                    isn t your fucking larder, 
                    Herrick.

                                    HERRICK
                    A social call, nothing more. 
                    We re worried about you.

                                    MITCHELL
                    We re meant to keep a low 
                    profile. Coming here, attacking 
                    people in their sleep, that s not 
                    how we work.

                                    HERRICK
                    Attacking people in their sleep? 
                    Who s attacking people in their 
                    sleep?

                                    MITCHELL
                    Seth said -

                                    HERRICK
                     Seth said . Listen. There s 
                    something you need to know about 
                    Seth.

      Herrick puts his hand on Mitchell s shoulder, steeling 
      himself as if about to break terrible news. 

                                    HERRICK (CONT D)
                    He s an idiot.

      Herrick laughs, pats his shoulder - come on - and strolls 
      over to the counter. Mitchell follows.

                                    HERRICK (CONT D)
                    But it makes you think, doesn t 
                    it. These rules about what we can 
                    and cannot do. For instance, 
                    here s a thought: suppose the 
                    world knewof our existence. 
                      Supposethey had a choice...

      Behind the counter is a young girl, maybe 19. Gauche. 
      Braces. Spots.

                                    HERRICK (CONT D)
                    You do Hot Chocolate?

    The girl nods. Herrick turns to Mitchell - you want 
      anything? Mitchell shakes his head.

                                    HERRICK (CONT D)
                    One Hot Chocolate.

                    What time did you start?

                    Uh, 2?

                                    HERRICK
                    Oo, long shift. Who do you get in 
                    here mostly, this time of night?

                                    GIRL
                    Staff mainly. Though we get 
                    parents too, of the kids in the 
                    children s ward. You can tell 
                    them a mile off. They take it in

                    order coffee but they don t drink 
                    it.

                                    HERRICK
                    Well. I m sure they appreciate 
                    what you do.

    He hands her the money. She shyly waves it away.

                                    GIRL
                    Actually. It s fine.

                                    HERRICK
                    Well you re very kind. Take it 
                    easy.

    He and Mitchell walk away, towards the doors. 

                                    MITCHELL

    He leans in closer, his voice is barely a whisper.*

                    Let s go up to the children s

                    taking about, you think a single

      Mitchell recoils. But not from disgust. Herrick s eyes are *
      blazing with urgency. *

      A crackle of static and voices over his radio.

      Mitchell says nothing.

                                    HERRICK (CONT D)
                    Something to ponder.

      Herrick smiles and his eyes scorch black - just for a 
      second. He turns and strolls away. Mitchell doesn t move. 



      INT. THE HOSPITAL. CORRIDOR. MORNING 3. 09:34.5555

    The next morning. George is sorting through a linen 
      cupboard, piling stuff into Mitchell s arms.

                                      GEORGE
                    Listen, I m going to that thing 
                    later. The memorial thing, for 
                    Lauren. You want to come?

                                    MITCHELL
                    Um, I don t know...

                                      GEORGE
                    Come on, it ll be nice. Well, not 
                     nice  so much as...  horrible . 
                    I thought you were friends.

                                    MITCHELL
                    Not really. A bit. Towards the 
                    end.

                                    VOICE
                    George.

    It makes him jump. He spins around. But it s Becca.

                    Thank you for sharing.

      George hands the pillow cases to Becca.

                                      GEORGE
                    You ve changed your shampoo. It s 
                    minty. Normally you re vanillary.

                                      GEORGE
                    I ve just got a good sense of 
                    smell.

                                    BECCA
                    You like it?

                                      GEORGE
                    Yes, you smell like a Polo.

      They laugh. 

                                      GEORGE (CONT D)
                    Have you got a hole?

    And the laughter dies. George winces. Mitchell stuffs a 
      pillow case in his mouth. Becca just blinks, disconcerted.

                                    BECCA
                    I ll, uh, see you later, yeah?

      Becca walks on. Mitchell turns to George. 

                                    MITCHELL
                    Shit, are you interested in her?

                                      GEORGE
                    No. I don t know. Why, are you?

                                    MITCHELL
                    Me? God, no. I mean, she s nice, 
                    but if you're interested in her, 
                    I'll - because it's not like you 
                    get interested in people every 
                    day. I don't want to discourage 
                    it.

                                      GEORGE
                              (fidgets)
                    She wouldn t be interested in me.

                    me think about it.

      George starts to walk away. Mitchell looks down. His hand 
    is shaking. He stuffs it in his pocket. George has stopped. 

                                      GEORGE (CONT D)
                    Oh yeah. Have you seen my phone?



      INT. THE HOUSE. MORNING 3. 09:42.5656

      Annie is looking at the mobile phone in her hand. She s 
      typed a text message. It reads:

       Tap in kitchen making very odd noises. Clducome + 
      repair? This afternoon good. Hope UR well. From george. 

    She presses  send . Then swallows. No turning back now.



      EXT. THE HOSPITAL. GROUNDS. AFTERNOON 3. 13:06.5757

      A little square in the hospital grounds. A smattering of 
      nurses and doctors. A hole has been dug, a tree planted. A 
      caretaker is shovelling in the last of the earth. A middle 
      aged couple that must be Lauren s parents watch the 
      proceedings, still in wide-eyed shock. George hunches up 
      against the wind.



      INT. THE HOSPITAL. STAFF TOILETS. AFTERNOON 3. 14:12.5858

      George, alone in the hospital staff toilets. He washes his 
      face, rubs his eyes wearily and looks at himself in the 
      mirror. Nothing behind him in the reflection but the 
      opposite wall. He starts tugging off his tie. A hand 
      touches his shoulder. 

                                      LAUREN
                    Boo.

      George almost jumps out of his skin. But the bigger shock 
    is when he spins around and sees who it is.

                                      GEORGE
                    Lauren...?

                                      LAUREN
                    Surprise.

    She looks amazing. Her eyes glow a brilliant, dazzling 
      green. Her hair is as red as fire. She seems to swirl up 
    out of nowhere, out of shadows. She s grinning darkly. 
      Hungrily. She looks beautiful. Ferocious.

                                      LAUREN (CONT D)
                    Enjoy my memorial service? Shame 
                    Mitchell couldn t make it. Maybe 
                    he ll come to your one.

      George scrambles back away from her. But he doesn t cry 
      out. Lauren looms over him, moving closer... closer... 

                                      LAUREN (CONT D)
                    Your face. This must be 
                    confusing. Let me explain: Before 
                    I died I had this one odd last 
                    thought. And now I m going to 
                    make it yours. You know all the 
                    things you were scared of as a 
                    kid? All the monsters under the 
                    bed?

    She is barely an inch away from him now, her eyes burning 
      black, her voice a hiss in his ear.

                                      LAUREN (CONT D)
                    They re all real.

    She stops. Regards George for a moment. Straightens up.

                                      LAUREN (CONT D)
                    Ok, I m kind of new to this, but 
                    aren t you supposed to weep or 
                    scream or wee yourself? I ve 
                    never loomed up on someone before 
                    and I was really looking forward 
                    to it. 

                                      GEORGE
                    Mitchell did this to you?

    The grin has gone now. She stares at George with cold fury. 

                                      LAUREN
                    You know? You know what he is?

    And then something else - a realisation. 



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    "Being Human" Episode 1  SHOOTING SCRIPT  17th September 2008 40.

    She tugs George close to her again, studies him.

                    Oh my God.

    She pushes George back. Grossed out.

                    Ew.Creepy.

    She backs away. And she's gone. 



      INT. THE HOSPITAL. CORRIDOR. AFTERNOON 3. 14:27.5959

      Mitchell is mopping a floor. George stomps towards him.

                                    MITCHELL
                    Do me a favour. There s some 
                    bacon in the fridge at home, it 
                    goes off at midnight, could you -

      George punches him in the face. Mitchell staggers back, 
      more from shock than the blow itself.

                                      GEORGE
                    Guess who I just saw.

      Mitchell rubs his jaw.

                    Then why are we even trying?

      They stare at each other. There s nothing more to say. 

      George turns and walks away. Mitchell is left, winded.

      Becca approaches from the other direction.

                                    BECCA
                    Hey. Oh shit, sorry, can I walk

                    So do you want to go out for a

                    Yep, I ve made a decision, no

                    meaning to do it for ages, but 
                    kept putting it off. That sounded 
                    so much funnier in the Ladies. 

      Mitchell looks at her for a long time.

                    What the hell.



      INT. THE HOUSE. BATHROOM. AFTERNOON 3. 14:33.6060

      A mirror. The sound of hairspray.Suddenly Annie 
      straightens up and looks at her reflection. Her hair is 
      wild and blow dried. She looks terrifying. 

                                    ANNIE
                      AAAHHHHHHHHHH!

      Later. That s better. She looks like herself again. She 
      adopts a peaceful, celestial expression.

                    Be not afraid.

    She sighs. That just sounds stupid. Pulls a spooky face.

                                    ANNIE (CONT D)
                      WoooOOOOooooOOOO.

    She slumps and looks flatly at herself. No funny faces, 
      nothing. Just herself. Very frightened.



      INT. THE HOUSE. GENERAL. AFTERNOON 3. 15:21.6161

      Annie s working out the best place to present herself. She 
      stands in the centre of the living room. Sits. Stands 
      again. 

    CUT TO:

    She tries the kitchen, appearing suddenly from behind the 
      door. No, too weird.

    CUT TO:

      She s gone back to standing in the centre of the living 
      room. She waits. She looks at her watch.

    CUT TO:

      INT. THE HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. AFTERNOON 3. 16:02.6262

      Bored now, Annie is sat on the floor, leaning against the 
      wall watching TV.3 or 4 mugs of tea around her. 

    The doorbell rings. Annie sits bolt upright. Oh Christ. 

      Silence. Then the doorbell rings again. 

      Annie stands in the centre of the room and prepares 
      herself. But at the sound of a key in the lock, her courage 
      fails her. She scrambles around the corner and flattens 
      herself against the wall as Owen steps through the door. 

                                    OWEN
                    George? It s Owen. Mitchell?

      Annie takes a deep breath. Ok, here goes... 

                                    OWEN (CONT D)
                    The TV s on.

      Annie stops, frowns, who s he talking to?

    And we see a woman step through the door behind him.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    "Being Human" Episode 1  SHOOTING SCRIPT  17th September 2008 43.

                    Maybe he popped out.

                                    OWEN
                              (calls out again)
                    Hello? I rang the doorbell...!

                    You don t have to do this, Janey. 
                    You can wait in the car.

      Annie s jaw is on her chest. She mouths miserably to 
      herself - Janey Harris...! 

                                    JANEY
                    It s fine. I want to. 

                                    OWEN
                    You think I should turn this off?

      Owen is moving towards the TV, towards Annie. She panics. 
      She s trapped. Owen walks into view. Annie gasps. Owen 
      turns and looks right at her, rigid, flat against the wall.

                                    OWEN (CONT D)
                    You say something?

                                    JANEY
                    What?

                                    OWEN
                    Did you say something?

      He s looking right through Annie. He can t see her. 

                                    JANEY
                    You re hearing things... You 
                    going to look at this tap?

      Owen doesn t move for a moment. Just stares at / through 
      Annie. Then he turns the TVoff and walks back towards the 
      kitchen, away from Annie.

                                    OWEN
                    Yeah. It could take a while. 
                    Really, go and wait in the car.

    He disappears into the kitchen. Annie tentatively peers 
      around the corner, watching them. 

                                    JANEY (O.S.)

      INT. THE HOUSE. KITCHEN. AFTERNOON 3. 16:04. CONTINUOUS.6363

      Owen stands over the sink. Runs the tap. Janey watches him.

                                    JANEY
                    You alright?

                                    OWEN
                    Yeah, I suppose. It s weird being 
                    here.

      Owen crouches, looks at the pipes under the sink. Bangs 
      them a bit. It s all a bit cursory. 

                                    OWEN (CONT D)
                    I have no idea what I m doing. 
                    I ll come back later.

    The sound of a key in the lock. 



      INT. THE HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. AFTERNOON 3. 16:04.CONTINUOUS6464

    The front door opens. It's George. The first thing he sees 
    as he steps inside is Annie, peeping around the corner of 
    the living room, with a look of frozen wide-eyed horror.

                                      GEORGE
                    Oh. Hello. 
                              (beat)
                    What?

    He follows her eyes round to find Owen and Janey standing 
    in the doorway to the kitchen behind him. George yells.

                                      GEORGE (CONT D)
                    AHHHHhhhhhello!

                    doorbell, but no one answered.

      George spins a little on the spot, back and forth, looking 
      from Annie to Owen and Janey. Can t they see her?

                                      GEORGE

    He glances back over his shoulder. Annie is still in plain 
      view but obviously only to George. She s sat back on the 
      floor with her knees up, her head buried in her arms.

                                    OWEN
                    I think I ll have to come back,

                    I don t want to disturb you.

                    I ll pop by later in the week. 

      Owen and Janey start moving towards the door.

                    It was nice to meet you.

      They take their leave and go. George shuts the door. Annie 
    is still bunched up on the floor.

                    Annie -

    And suddenly she s up on her feet, in the middle of the 
      room. Angry, tearful, punchy.

                    But I knewif he saw me again

                    watch him shave and laugh and I m 
                    still in the clothes Idied in. I 
                    get nothing. I get the memories 
                    and a house I can never 
                    completely leave and you. SHE 
                    GETS HIM AND I GET YOU.

    She slides down the wall opposite, her head in her hands, 
    and weeps and weeps. George doesn't know what to say. He 
      sits down on the floor next to her.

                    After I got... after I lost 
                      everything, I ran away. I met 
                    Mitchell and we came here and met 
                    you and... I d just about come to

                    And then I saw her. My ex. And 
                    she d found someone else. And it 
                    was so... savage. So I know how 
                    it feels. Like losing everything 
                    all over again.

      George is a little thrown. No one s ever asked him before.

                    bitten. I...  survived .

                    Like you. Hooray for us.
                              (beat)
                    Why couldn t Owen see you?

                                    ANNIE
                    Maybe it was the shock of it. 
                    Like it... set me back. 

                                      GEORGE
                    Like a relapse?

                    There s so much about this I 
                    don t understand.
                              (beat)
                    What did you think of her? Janey. 

                                      GEORGE
                    She s... orange. 

                                    ANNIE
                    She works in the Tanning Salon. 
                    She thinks she looks classy. I 
                    think she looks like Kilroy.

                                      GEORGE
                    You re much prettier. And much 
                    nicer.

                                    ANNIE
                    And much deader.

      George says nothing. On an impulse, he puts his arm round 
      Annie. She smiles sadly and settles in to his embrace.

      INT. HOSPITAL. CORRIDOR. EVENING 3. 20:08.6666

      George wanders onto a ward, in his hospital scrubs. At the 
      Nurse s Station, an HCA has a phone clamped between her 
      neck and shoulder, she s looking at a patient s chart.

                                    HCA
                    What does that look like to you? 
                    A 3 or a 5?

                                      GEORGE
                    A 3?

                                    HCA
                    That s what I thought. That s 
                    Becca s handwriting. So if she 
                    gave Mr Davieshis medsat 3, 
                    then he needs them again now. But 
                    if it s a 5, then he won t need 
                    them till 10 o clock.

                                      GEORGE

      turns one way, then another. Christ, where does he start?



      INT. BAR. EVENING 3. 20:28.6868

      Mitchell and Becca are in a bar. They are already several 
      drinks down. Becca looks beautiful. She s clearly gone to a 
    lot of effort for this. They re laughing.

                                    MITCHELL
                    I m serious. If there s another

                    That s ridiculous! 

                                    MITCHELL
                    And at my age. Now you: something 
                      embarrassing.

                                    BECCA
                    Uhhhh.Ok. It wasn t until 6 
                    months ago I stopped ringing my 
                    ex every time I got drunk. 
                              (cringes)
                    Oh God, I shouldn t have told you

                    Not great. But I m thinking, once 
                    a smoker always a smoker. What s 
                    the point of fighting it?    "Being Human" Episode 1  SHOOTING SCRIPT  17th September 2008 50.


      EXT. STREET. NIGHT 3. 20:36.6969

    The city is swamped with drinkers and revellers. George 
      pushes through crowds, diving into bars and pubs. There s 
      still no sign of Mitchell and Becca.



      INT. BAR. NIGHT 3. 20:37.7070

                                    BECCA
                    So... so would you like to come 
                    back to mine? My flat-mate s out. 
                    We d have the place to ourselves.

      Mitchell swallows the last of his drink. Everything has 
      been set in motion, and now it will just carry him along. 
    He takes the breath that will say  yes . But Becca is 
      looking over his shoulder.

                                    BECCA (CONT D)
                    Is that a friend of yours?

      Mitchell turns. His face falls. Pushing through the crowded 
      bar, making a b-linefor them... is Lauren. 

                                      LAUREN
                    Well lookeehere. Mind if I join 
                    you? 

    She plonks herself down into another chair.

                                      LAUREN (CONT D)
                    Aren t you going to introduce us?

                              (to Becca)
                    I should explain. Me and Mitchell 
                    dated. Just once really. Well it 
                    was kind of a date. So where are 
                    we up to? With me he did this 
                    whole thing about the ancient 
                    machinery of the world. 

                                    MITCHELL
                    Please don t do this.

      Mitchell is on his feet.

                                    MITCHELL
                    Get up.

                    GET UP.

      A few heads turn. Lauren shrugs, stands. Mitchell grabs her 
    arm and marches her towards the door. Lauren calls back 
      over her shoulder to Becca.

                                      LAUREN
                    You seem nice. Maybe afterwards 
                    we can be friends... hang out...

    And they re gone. Becca is left, completely bewildered. 



      EXT. OUTSIDE BAR. NIGHT 3. 20:38.7171

      Mitchell drags Lauren outside. She snatches her arm away 
      from him. Takes out a pack of cigarettes, lights one.

                                      LAUREN
                    So I saw your furry friend.

                    I was actually going to feed from

                    probably need jabs or something.

                                    MITCHELL
                    What do you want? Did Herrick

                    Yeah but this isn t just about 
                    him.

                                    MITCHELL
                    Then what do you want?

                    I m sorry...

      Suddenly Mitchell grabs her arm.

                    They stay away from the smaller

      Lauren tips her head back and laughs.

      time.

                    I m sorry. Let me walk you to the

                    Whatever. I just need a pee.

    She trails off dejectedly to the toilets.

      Mitchell slumps back into his chair. He takes a breath. He 
      looked over the precipice... and stepped back.



      EXT. ALLEYWAY. NIGHT 3. 20:51.7373

      George is hurrying towards the bar where Mitchell and Becca 
      are. As he passes the mouth to the alley next to it, he 
      notices a figure in the shadows. The figure has her back to 
      George, barely discernible in the darkness. But something 
      about it, the way she s standing, makes George skid to a 
      halt. He takes a few tentative steps into the alley. Slowly 
    the figure turns and looks at him. It s Lauren.



      INT. BAR. NIGHT 3. 20:53.7474

    In the bar, Becca still hasn't come back. Mitchell is 
      uneasy. He gets up.

                                      GEORGE
                    Lauren? It s me, it s George.

    She starts moving towards George, out of the darkness. Her 
      hand flashes out and she has George pinned by the throat 
      against the wall, his feet kicking in the air. She leans 
    in, almost nose to nose. All cruel smiles. 

                                      LAUREN
                    Bad dog.

    She drops him to the ground and stalks off. 

      George is flat on his back, winded. He turns his head and 
      comes face to face with... Becca. 

    She looks at George, her eyes wide with shock and terror. 
    Her hands are clamped to her throat. And the blood floods 
    and pumps through her fingers.     "Being Human" Episode 1  SHOOTING SCRIPT  17th September 2008 55.


      INT. BAR. CORRIDOR. NIGHT 3. 20:54.7676

      Mitchell is standing by the door of the ladies toilets. A 
      woman steps out. 

                                    WOMAN
                    No, she s not in there.

      Suddenly a scream from outside. Mitchell is standing by the 
      fire exit. He swings the door open, out onto the alleyway.



      EXT. ALLEYWAY. NIGHT 3. 20:54.7777

      There's George. He's cradling Becca in his arms. 

                                    MITCHELL
                    Oh Jesus Christ...

      A couple of people poke their heads out through the door. 
    One of them screams when they see Becca and the blood.

                                    MITCHELL (CONT D)
                    Call an ambulance!

    The women stumble back inside. Mitchell scrambles down onto 
    the ground next to Becca and George. George has his hand 
      clamped over the cut in Becca s throat, but the blood is 
      still coursing through his fingers. Becca blinks up at 
      Mitchell, bewildered and terrified.

                                    BECCA
                    What s... there s water...

                                    MITCHELL
                    Becca, it s Ok, it s Ok, it s 
                    Mitchell. Come on, baby, that s 
                    it, stay looking at me.

                    I m covered... with water...

    And then Lauren emerges out of the darkness. 

                                      LAUREN
                    Now isn t this a touching scene.

                                    MITCHELL
                    What did you do to her?!

                    Easy, tiger. What s the problem? 
                    You just need to let her drink 
                    from you.

                    Becca, Becca, look at me.

      Becca s eyes are rolling in her head. But they find Lauren, 
    and she makes a sound; a childish, frightened sound. 

                                      LAUREN
                    It s Ok, honey, he ll save you. 
                    He ll make this all go away. 

      With what little strength Becca has left, she tries to claw 
      back away from Lauren, terrified of her.

                    She s about two pints away from 
                    being an organ donor.

                                      GEORGE
                    Mitchell, DO something.

      Mitchell is weeping. He shakes his head.

                                    MITCHELL
                    Not another one... I can t... 

      Even Lauren is a little surprised. She looks at Becca, 
      lifeless and bloody. At George, sick and shocked. And at 
      Mitchell, weeping and cradling Becca in his arms.

                                      LAUREN
                    You did this. 

      Lauren steps away, melting back into the shadows.

                    You made me this, Mitchell. This 
                    is all your fault.

    And she s gone. In the distance, the wail of sirens. 





                                                                            (CONTINUED)    "Being Human" Episode 1  SHOOTING SCRIPT  17th September 2008 57.

      People have spilled out from the bar now, crowded around 
    the fire exit, watching in shock. George looks on, as 
      Mitchell holds the dying Becca. 

                                    MITCHELL
                    I m sorry... I m so sorry...



      INT. THE HOSPITAL. CORRIDOR. NIGHT 3. 21:32.7878

      A blood soaked George sits on chairs in the corridor. 
      Further along, Mitchell - also covered in blood and dirt 
      from the alley - is with a group of police, uniformed and 
      plain clothed. A doctor arrives. Shakes his head. 

    The Police talk among themselves, talk to Mitchell. After a 
      moment Mitchell breaks off from the group and walks towards 
      George. George stands, steeling himself for the inevitable.

                                      GEORGE
                    Is this how it ends then? They 
                    connect her to you, youto 
                    Lauren. Everything gets blown 
                    open. We lose it all.

                                    MITCHELL
                    No. They have ways of doing this. 
                    Come on.

                                      GEORGE
                    What do you mean?

                                    MITCHELL
                    We ve been around for thousands 
                    of years. You think it s the 
                    first time something like this 
                    has happened?

    He looks back down the corridor at the group of Policemen. 
    One of them is watching Mitchell and George. It s Herrick. 
    And by his side, Seth.

                                    MITCHELL (CONT D)
                    We have branches everywhere.



      INT. THE HOSPITAL. RECEPTION. NIGHT 3. 21:57.7979

      Mitchell and George wander out through a conspicuously 
      quiet reception.

                                      GEORGE
                    Wait here. I ll see if I can find 
                    a cab.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    "Being Human" Episode 1  SHOOTING SCRIPT  17th September 2008 58.

    He scurries out. Mitchell just stands where George has left 
      him, still dazed and shaken.

                                    HERRICK (O.S.)
                    Hey, Mitchell.

      Mitchell looks up. Herrick has followed them out, Seth 
      trailing in his wake. They are standing on a little balcony 
      that crosses reception.

                                    HERRICK (CONT D)
                    It s all about to start. We re 
                    drawing up lists. It s make your 
                    mind up time.

      Mitchell thinks for a moment. The next thing he says will 
      determine the rest of his life.

                                    MITCHELL
                    I choose them.

      Herrick s expression remains utterly inscrutable. But his 
      eyes scorch black as he regards Mitchell. 

                                    HERRICK
                    Pity.

    He steps back, moving away into the shadows.

                                    HERRICK (CONT D)
                    Be seeing you.

                            (a sly grin)
                    And your little dog.

    He too turns, strolls back into the darkness.



      INT. THE HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT 3. 22:27.8080

      Mitchell is sat on the floor of the empty living room. His 
      eyes wet with tears. He stares ahead, lost and shattered. 
    His clothes still caked with Becca s blood.



      INT. THE HOUSE. KITCHEN. NIGHT 3. 22:27.8181

      Annie and George, in his dressing gown, are watching 
      Mitchell from the doorway to the kitchen. Their voices low.

      Annie moves back into the kitchen, starts making tea. 
      George watches his friend for a moment, then turns.

                    Please. I m sorry. I just feel

                    nothing can touch us then.

      George sighs. He nods. Ok. 

      Annie smiles, grateful, and walks through to the living 
      room. She sits next to Mitchell, her arm around him, pulls 
    him close to her. She looks back to George. Smiles again.

      George picks up his blood splattered clothes from a pile on 
    the floor and dumps them in the sink. He rolls his eyes as 
    the tap clanks and splutters.

      A figure is watching the house. His face lost in shadows. 
    He steps forward, and the beam of the street lamp 
      illuminates his face. He's handsome, unshaven, with sharp 
      intelligent eyes. He watches George, standing at the sink, 
      oblivious. A predator watching its quarry.
