                                        THE JURORS 
 
 
  NOTE: The jurors will typically be referred to by descriptive 
  nicknames as opposed to their actual names, which in a few 
  cases also surface in the script.  This is meant to make them 
  easier to track. 
 
  "MARTHA" (Foreman) - Female, late 30s to early 40s.  
    Homemaker, PTA president.  A "Martha Stewart" type, hence the 
  moniker.  Prim and proper; organized and organizing.  Being 
  foreman is a little power trip; she's more interested in 
  controlling the proceedings than in debating issues of guilt 
  or innocence. 
 
  "FEATHER" (Juror #2) - Female, 20s.  A waifishly pretty young* 
  woman, and another character whose life took a left turn a few 
  years back.  Shy and withdrawn, avoids physical contact and 
  very soft-spoken -- on those rare occasions when she does 
  speak.  In the jury room, she's wary and uncomfortable.  But 
  though she may be timid about voicing her opinions, she can be 
  stubborn about clinging to them. 
 
  "AGATHA CHRISTY" (Juror #3) - Female, 50s to 60s.  Spinster  * 
  and mystery fan.  Views jury duty as an exciting vacation from 
  a more humdrum life.  Living largely through fiction, she may 
  at first be inured to the quite tragic realities involved in 
  this case.  (Wardrobe note:  her thick reading glasses hang 
  from an eyeglass cord around her neck.) 
 
  "NIGHT SCHOOL" (Juror #4) - Black male, 30ish.  Instructor at* 
  an adult technical school.  Closeted gay, deliberate and 
  logically minded, easily put off by macho posturing.  Careful 
  never to lose his cool because of what he might inadvertently 
  reveal. 
 
  "PINKY" (Juror #5) - Male, 40s to 50s.  A former lobsterman  * 
  from old Maine stock.  Weathered and taciturn; not the 
  sharpest pencil in the box but honest.  Given to blunt 
  assessments and occasionally blunt language. 
 
  "BRASSY" (Juror #6) - Hispanic female, late 30s to early 40s.*  
  Mortgage Broker.  Sexy, sassy, and independent.  Full of 
    "life-wisdom" gleaned from two marriages, though now making a 
  go of it on her own. 
                                                                                               iii
  DEAD ZONE: UNREASONABLE DOUBT - CAST & SETS - 5/5/02 - WHITE-2 


  "LEADING CITIZEN" (Juror #7) - Black male, 40s.  An urban    * 
  transplant, now a very successful local businessman, plugged 
  into the establishment.  Outwardly buttoned down; inwardly 
  volatile.  A bully, but a bully whose anger also has a source: 
  a private trauma that the trial has reawakened. 
 
  "SPORTS NUT" (Juror #8) - Male, 30s to 40s.  The couch       * 
  potato's couch potato.  The kind of ravening fan who keeps up 
  with the other towns' high school soccer scores.  He can also 
  be bullying, but ultimately he's more of a follower than a 
  leader. 
 
  "GOTH GUY" (Juror #9)   18 to 22.  A pierced and tattooed art* 
  student at a local college, who's more than a little 
    contemptuous of this pack of adults with their compromised 
  lives.  Pretty much "out of it" for most of the jury 
    deliberations, preferring to doodle cartoons and caricatures 
  of his fellow jurors in a Manga (Japanese) comic book style. 
 
  "VIC" (Juror #10) - Male, 60ish, handicapped.  He gets a real* 
  name because he doesn't deserve to be called "Wheels."  An 
  affable man, by turns folksy and thoughtful; unafraid to speak 
  his mind but disinclined to impose his views on others.  If 
  all the jurors were this level-headed, we'd have no story. 
 
  "FAN MAN" (Juror #11) - 30ish.  A nerdy fellow; he idolizes  * 
  odd "celebrities" and edits a web site devoted to equally odd 
    "phenomena."  Still living at home, where he keeps his Spock 
  ears in his sock drawer.  Intelligent but socially insecure 
  and easily intimidated.  A true believer in the occult, 
    parapsychology, alien visitations... and Johnny Smith. 
 
  JUROR #12 - Take a wild guess.                                                                                                 iv

                                              TEASER

          FADE IN:

  11EXT. MAINE ESTABLISHING - DAY (STOCK)


  22EXT. SMITH NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

          We're tracking along with a young boy who's wearing a
            miniature motorcycle cop's helmet as he furiously peddles
          a "Big Wheel"-style tricycle along a stretch of sidewalk.

          There's a tongue-in-cheek echo of the Big Wheel sequence
          in "The Shining" as plastic wheels thrum over sidewalk
          cracks, dip and rise across driveway aprons, until our
          rider spots an obstacle up ahead:


          BIG WHEEL RIDER'S POV - TWO HAPLESS GUYS

          walking along and none too fast.  One's even got a cane.


          CLOSE ON BIG WHEEL RIDER

          Steely eyes squint, then a little hand reaches for an
          impressive apparatus on the handlebars.  There's a sudden
          siren burst -- WHOOP!  WHOOP!  WHOOP!


          JOHNNY AND BRUCE

          jump aside as the police-themed Big Wheel plows by.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Jeez!
                                (they resume walking)
                        Didn't think I was going fast
                        enough to get pulled over.

                                        BRUCE
                        Believe me, you ain't.

                                        JOHNNY
                        C'mon, I'm smokin' here.

          Now a speed-walking 70-YEAR-OLD WOMAN wearing headphones
          and carrying hand weights breezes past.  Johnny sighs.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: UNREASONABLE DOUBT - TEASER - 04/22/02 - WHITE  2.


    2CONTINUED:2

                                        BRUCE
                        "Smokin'?"

                                        JOHNNY
                        Okay.  The summer Olympics are
                        out.

          He looks up ahead and his expression darkens.


          JOHNNY'S APPROACHING POV - A MAILBOX

          looms at the end of his driveway, leaning slightly on its
          post like some ominous totem.  (Note: The PT Cruiser should
          be parked in the driveway).


          RESUME JOHNNY & BRUCE

                                        JOHNNY
                        Wonder what'll it be today.

                                        BRUCE
                                (teasing)
                        Another rubber rattlesnake... or
                        maybe a live one.

          They come to a stop by the mailbox and a recycling bin.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (catching his breath)
                        I'd settle for snakes.  It's those
                          bubble-wrapped "offerings" that
                        creep me out.
                                (mock shudder)
                        "Can you touch this chew toy and
                        find my Kathy's poodle?..."

          During the above, Bruce has opened the mailbox, pulling
          out a slim stack of mail.

                                        BRUCE
                        No bubble wrap.  You're in luck.
                                (thumbing through)
                        Bill.  Bill.  Credit card.

          He holds up a colorful "Publisher's Clearing House"-type
          sweepstakes envelope, reads off it.

                                        BRUCE
                        "You may have just won ten million
                          dollars!"

          He makes like "The Great Karnak," closing his eyes and


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: UNREASONABLE DOUBT - TEASER - 04/22/02 - WHITE  3.


  2CONTINUED: (2)2

          holding the envelope to his forehead for a studied beat.

                                        BRUCE
                        Nope.

          Johnny opens the recycling bin and Bruce tosses it in.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Not bad, Karnak.

                                        BRUCE
                        Beginner's luck.
                                (studies last item)
                        County Courthouse.  Any overdue
                          tickets?

          Johnny shrugs, gives him a little nod.  Bruce opens it,
          pulls out a PINK SUMMONS, scans it and reacts.

                                        BRUCE
                        It's a jury summons.
                                (off Johnny's surprise)
                        Don't worry, I'll write you a
                          doctor's note.  "Still recovering
                        from coma."

          Johnny smiles, reaches for the summons.  But as his hand
          closes on it...

                                        WOMAN JUROR (O.S.)
                        Guilty.

          Johnny turns toward the sound, only now he's in:


  33INT. JURY ROOM - DAY - VISION

          A dramatic SERIES OF CLOSE-UPS as the camera frames a
          succession of jurors -- including a sixtyish man in a
            motorized wheelchair (VIC), a fortyish African-American
          businessman (LEADING CITIZEN), a pierced and tattooed 20-
          year-old (GOTH GUY), a nerdy fellow with glasses (FAN
          MAN) -- as each says "Guilty."  The vote proceeds around
          a table until it reaches:


          JOHNNY

          who's looking distracted.  A beat, then:

                                        MARTHA (O.S.)
                        Number Twelve...?

          Johnny turns to see a prim woman (MARTHA) -- the jury


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: UNREASONABLE DOUBT - TEASER - 04/22/02 - WHITE  4.


    3CONTINUED:3

          foreman -- and the other ten jurors eyeing him expectantly.

                                        MARTHA
                        Mister Smith?  Your vote?

          Johnny seems about to answer... when the vision ends.


          MATCHING SHOT - JOHNNY - TODAY

          as he looks up from the summons, clearly intrigued by
          this mysterious, open-ended vision.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Save the note.  I think this is
                        one court date I'd better keep.

          And as they head up the driveway, Bruce eyeing him
            curiously...

                                                                              FADE OUT.

          FADE IN:

  44EXT. BANGOR, MAINE - DAY - ESTABLISHING


  55EXT. PENOBSCOT COUNTY SUPERIOR COURTHOUSE - DAY (STOCK)

          A red brick and colonnaded edifice that harks back to
          colonial times.


  66INT. COURTHOUSE LOBBY - CLOSE ON A TALL MURAL OF THE
          BLINDFOLDED GODDESS OF JUSTICE

          PUSHING IN slightly on the classic figure, holding her
          balanced scales in one hand, a sword in the other, as --


          JOHNNY

          jury summons in hand, steps closer.  In the b.g., other
          prospective jurors clutching their tell-tale pink
          summonses, along with lawyers and litigants, crisscross
          the busy lobby, crowd into an elevator and hustle up and
          down a broad staircase.  But Johnny's attention is on
          Lady Justice's scales -- something's a little off about
          them -- and he doesn't hear a mechanical WHINE behind
          him.
























                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: UNREASONABLE DOUBT - ACT ONE - 04/26/02 - PINK  6.


    6CONTINUED:6

          He turns into the path of VIC -- a 50ish man in a motorized
          wheelchair, and another juror from his vision -- Johnny
          lightly BUMPING his wheelchair as Vic stops short...


77A JOHNNY FLASH - INT. PRISON VISITORS ROOM - DAY

            A grim-faced Vic, in a wheelchair but several years
          younger, listens MOS through a telephone to a still younger
          Male Prisoner facing him across a glass partition.


  88RESUME - LOBBY

          The collision has caused Vic to spill some coffee on his
          lap.  He dabs at it with a napkin.

                                        VIC
                        Back to the dry cleaner's.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sorry.

                                        VIC
                        Not your fault they didn't put a
                        cup holder on this thing.

          He notes Johnny's summons, his general unease.

                                        VIC
                        Your first time, too?
                                (off Johnny's nod)
                        Vic.  Vic Goodman.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Johnny Smith.

          Johnny looks back at the mural.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Am I wrong, or is one side of
                        those scales a little lower than
                        the other?

                                        VIC
                                (smiles)
                        Makes you wonder if someone's got
                        their thumb on 'em, doesn't it.
                                (an elevator opens)
                        Whoops!  There's our bus.

          He rolls forward amidst a crush of people.  Johnny
          hesitates, watching Vic do a neat 180 as he backs in.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: UNREASONABLE DOUBT - ACT ONE - 04/22/02 - WHITE  7.


    8CONTINUED:8

                                        VIC
                        Why walk when you can ride?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Tell that to my physical therapist.

          The doors close and Johnny turns back to the mural and
          those slightly lopsided scales.  A crowd's MURMURING fades
          up, followed by the SOUND of a BANGING gavel, as we...

                                                                        TIME CUT TO:


  99INT. COURTROOM - DAY - CLOSE ON THAT BANGING GAVEL...

          ...then PANNING UP to reveal its owner, an aging and quirky
          JUDGE who's trying to silence a noisy crowd.  Finally:

                                        JUDGE
                        Quiet, already!

          The crowd shuts up.  And now we see that the gallery is
          filled with prospective jurors, who, along with a young
          PUBLIC DEFENDER and his still younger client, CARL WINTERS
          (17, African-American) plus eleven more jurors seated in
          the jury box (already selected for this trial, and
            comprised of Vic and the other jurors from Johnny's first
          vision), are all craning for a look at Johnny, standing
          sheepishly in a back row.  The Judge addresses a slight,
          balding PROSECUTOR.

                                        JUDGE
                        Mister Eddy, would you please
                        repeat your question...
                                (eyeing gallery)
                        ...and this time I'd like to be
                        able to hear the young man's
                        answer.

          The Prosecutor turns to Johnny.

                                        PROSECUTOR
                        Are you the same "Johnny Smith"
                        who recently assisted the Sheriff's
                        office?  And by assisted I mean
                        in a "psychic capacity."

                                        JOHNNY
                              (a beat)
                        Yes.

          The crowd murmurs again.  ("It is him!"  "I told you so!" 
          "What's he doing here?")  The Judge bangs his gavel.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: UNREASONABLE DOUBT - ACT ONE - 04/22/02 - WHITE  8.


    9CONTINUED:9

                                        JUDGE
                        Folks, this isn't Jerry Springer.
                                (motions to lawyers)
                          Approach, gentlemen.  You too,
                        Mister Smith.


          NEW ANGLE - AT SIDEBAR

          as the Judge steps down from the bench and Johnny and the
          two lawyers approach.

                                        JUDGE
                        Breath mint, anyone?

          He pops one in his mouth, then holds out the tin.  Johnny
          declines but the lawyers feel compelled to partake, making
          the Prosecutor, in particular, look that much more hapless
          as the Judge eyes him.

                                        JUDGE
                        I take it you have a problem with
                        Mister Smith here.

                                        PROSECUTOR
                                (puzzled)
                        Well, yes, he claims to be a
                          psychic, your honor.

                                        JUDGE
                        He does, does he?
                                (to Johnny)
                        Okay, I'm thinking of a number
                        between one and ten...

                                        JOHNNY
                          Actually, it doesn't work that --

                                        JUDGE
                                  (suspicious)
                        You're not like that fat lady on
                        TV, you know with that "psychic
                          network?"

                                        JOHNNY
                        No, um... who?

                                        JUDGE
                                (relieved)
                        Wife loves her.  Drives me nuts. 
                        Ever been committed?

                                        JOHNNY
                        No.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: UNREASONABLE DOUBT - ACT ONE - 04/26/02 - PINK  9.


  9CONTINUED: (2)9

                                        JUDGE
                        And you're not on any anti-
                          psychotic medication...?

                                        JOHNNY
                        No.

                                        PROSECUTOR
                        Your honor, at the very least
                        Mister Smith's notoriety will
                          distract the jury...
                                (eyes Public Defender)
                        ...it could even set up grounds
                        for appeal.

          The Judge considers the argument a beat, then, to Johnny --

                                        JUDGE
                        Mister Smith, is the defendant
                        guilty or not guilty?

                                        JOHNNY
                                (reacts)
                        I... I don't know.

                                        JUDGE
                        Good answer.
                                (more gravely)
                        Far as I'm concerned, we've all
                        got a "sixth sense."  It's called
                        our conscience.  Can I count on
                        you to use yours and judge this
                        case fairly?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yes, sir.

          The Judge eyes the Prosecutor, who shrugs wearily.

                                        JUDGE
                        Mister Smith, you're Juror Number
                        Twelve.
                                (indicates jury box)
                        We saved you a seat.

          Camera follows Johnny as he approaches the jury box, Vic
            welcoming him with a little smile.  As he sits in one of
          the last remaining seats, he turns to look at the sullen
          defendant, as now we PRELAP --

                                        PROSECUTOR (V.O.)
                        Meet Carl Winters...

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:          DEAD ZONE: UNREASONABLE DOUBT - ACT ONE - 04/29/02 - YELLOW  10.


  1010INT. COURTROOM - DAY - A FEW HOURS LATER

          The trial now under way, the gallery crowded with family
          and friends of the defendant and victim, as the Prosecutor
          makes his opening statement to the jury (which now includes
          two Alternates).  Winters' mother, sitting right behind
          her son, occasionally dabs her tears with a handkerchief
          that she holds throughout.

                                        PROSECUTOR
                        He's seventeen.  The defense will
                        tell you that he's a high school
                        junior who enjoys movies and
                          sports... like a lot of youngsters
                        you may know -- your neighbors'
                        kids, maybe even your own.  So
                        how, you may wonder, did this
                          clean-cut young man wind up here,
                        accused of armed robbery and
                        murder?

          He approaches the rapt jurors, his tone growing harder.

                                        PROSECUTOR (CONT'D)
                        The answer will become apparent
                        when you meet the other Carl
                          Winters.  The one who runs with a
                        gang of young thugs... who enjoys
                          terrorizing those weaker than
                        himself...

          Overlapping audio SEAMLESSLY CHANGES to the voice in the
          next shot...

                                        FEMALE WITNESS
                        I ran for my life outside to the
                        parking lot... that's when I heard
                        the gunshots...

          Again we overlap audio from --


          ANGLE ON A TV MONITOR

          Showing a security video of a gang of teens including
          Winters harassing the Female Witness at a Mom & Pop style
          convenience store... a Pakistani clerk tries to stop
          them... moving to find Johnny and the jury watching...

                                        PROSECUTOR (O.S.)
                        The gun is clearly visible in
                        Carl Winters' belt... He was the
                        only one in that store who could
                        have shot the clerk...

          And once again overlap audio to --

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:


  10B10BANGLE - THE DEFENSE LAWYER

          Making a closing argument to the jury...

                                        PUBLIC DEFENDER
                        My client, Mr. Winters does not
                        deny being at the store, he does
                        not deny his misbehavior but that's
                        all it was - misbehavior.  He did
                        not kill anyone.  Those were not
                          gunshots the witness heard, they
                        were bottles breaking in the
                          store...

          And finally one more overlap to --

                                        JUDGE (O.S.)
                        You must consider the evidence
                        and testimony...


          JOHNNY

          turns once again to eye Winters who shifts restlessly in
          his seat... his mother cries...

                                        JUDGE
                          ...decide for yourselves what the
                        facts are...

          Winters turns to see Johnny watching and returns his look,
          the teen's own expression anxious yet defiant.

                                        JUDGE
                        ...and render a verdict...

          And as we PUSH IN on Johnny and the boy, neither willing
          or able to break the connection...

                                        JUDGE
                        Guilty or not guilty.


  1111INT. CORRIDOR CONNECTING TO JURY ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

          We're moving with Johnny down the narrow corridor, as he
            overhears Brassy and Leading Citizen, just ahead of him.

                                        BRASSY
                        Can't believe he's making us 
                        start this late.  And on a Friday.

                                        LEADING CITIZEN
                        Guess he doesn't expect us to be
                        in here long.

          Fan Man, who often pushes up his glasses as they slip
          down the ridge of his nose, catches up to Johnny.

                                        FAN MAN
                        Mister Smith!  I just wanted to
                        tell you what an honor it is to
                        be serving with you.

                                        JOHNNY
                        An "honor?"





                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: UNREASONABLE DOUBT - ACT ONE - 5/5/02 - WHITE-2  13.

                        career.  You see...

          He digs out a BUSINESS CARD that features a website
          address, and as Johnny takes it --


1212A JOHNNY FLASH - INT. FAN MAN'S BEDROOM - DAY

          Fan Man works intently at a computer in the corner of the
          small bedroom... glasses bright with the reflection of a
          monitor that displays a website called ObscureTruth.Com
          full of UFO and occult headlines... behind on the wall
          over his bed are posters of Houdini, and contemporary sci-
          if icons...

                        a few questions for my website
                          later...

          Johnny reacts as they enter...


  1414INT. JURY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          ...where a Bailiff is placing legal DOCUMENTS (affidavits,
            instructions and reports) on the jury table, while a Guard
          arranges some other items (the DEFENDANT'S KEYCHAIN with
          the letter "C" attached; an evidence-tagged GUN; TWO
          SQUASHED BULLETS in a ziplock baggie; a LARGE PHOTO of
          the convenience store exterior and a DIAGRAM of its
            interior, with a small outline of a dead body near the
          counter) on a small display table.

          Goth Guy takes a seat at the long conference table, leans
          back and puts his feet up with a contented sigh.

    14CONTINUED:14

          Martha frowns as she takes a seat at the adjacent end of
          the table, indicates his feet --

                                        MARTHA
                        I think you know that's
                          inappropriate.

                        Gosh, gee, I'm sorry, Mom.

          He opens his notebook and begins doodling on a page already
          filled with comic book-style sketches of trial scenes. 
          Martha turns to Night School as he sits beside her.

                                        MARTHA
                        Did you hear that?

          Night School just shrugs "let it go"... as camera PANS,
          finding Pinky showing Brassy an unnaturally stubby little
            finger...

                        like a good mystery.

          Sports Nut shrugs...

    16CONTINUED:16

          Johnny is saved by Martha's call to arms:

                                        MARTHA
                        If the rest of us could take
                          seats... and I think that should
                        be by numbers, starting on my
                          right...

                                        MARTHA
                        I'm just trying to get us seated
                          properly so we can elect a foreman.

                                        LEADING CITIZEN
                        C'mon, let's cooperate, people. 
                        We've got work to do here.

          The seated jurors grumble as they rearrange themselves. 
          Johnny moves to his appointed seat, which is on Martha's
          right, but finds himself blocked by Feather, who's going
          the other way.  As their eyes meet, she meekly looks away,
          then brushes by him.  Once again, Johnny reacts --

          A quick shot of Feather being held from behind by one
          young Male Assailant -- her eyes wide in fear above the
          hand clamped over her mouth -- while a Second Assailant
          rips her blouse.


  1818RESUME - JURY ROOM

          Johnny looks after her, reacting to this far more
          disturbing flash, as they each take their seats.

                        Well, anyone actually want the
                        job?

          Martha clears her throat, but before she can speak...

                        Well, I think it makes sense to
                        put a certified psychic in charge.

                        No offense.

          This gets some chuckles, but the uneasiness with Johnny's
          presence is palpable.  Leading Citizen seems particularly
          annoyed by this foolishness.

                        Not to slight Mister Smith's

                        Sister, if you want it, you can
                        have it.

          A murmur of assent seals the deal as meanwhile...


          JOHNNY

          finds his eyes drawn to...


          THE EVIDENCE EXHIBITS ON THE TABLE

  1919RESUME

                                        MARTHA
                                (beat)
                        Guilty.

          She looks to her right, toward Juror #2, Feather, who
          takes a beat and then, very quietly:

                                        FEATHER
                        Guilty.

          The CAMERA now begins PANNING around the table, framing
          the other jurors as they also vote "Guilty" in the same
          sequence as in Johnny's original vision.  We INTERCUT
          with Johnny as he realizes this.  At about the same time,
          he picks up the DEFENDANT'S KEYCHAIN and as he does...


          CAMERA PIVOTS 180 DEGREES INTO A SPLIT REALITY

          At one end of the table, the "guilty" vote continues; but
          on Johnny's end -- as if the table is a pier protruding
          into another reality -- a NEW SETTING takes shape:


  2020EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY - VISION

            A CONVICT in a BRIGHT ORANGE JUMPSUIT moves behind Carl
          Winters and knifes him in the back with a shiv.  He goes
          down.  (Note: the prison garb should be notably different
          than the earlier prison shot involving Vic.) 

                                        MARTHA
                        Number Twelve...?


          NEW ANGLE

          as Johnny turns to her.  Only now the prison is gone and
          the other jurors are looking at him expectantly.

                                        MARTHA
                        Mister Smith?  Your vote?

          A beat as Johnny makes a difficult decision.  Then:

                                        JOHNNY
                        Not guilty.

          As the others react with surprise and suspicion...

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                        I'm not saying the defendant's
                          innocent... but there's a lot of
                          evidence to consider...

                        Maybe.  But I think we should go
                        through it all once more.

                        All right.  Mr. Smith wants to go
                        through the evidence again.  How
                        do we all feel about that...?

          A beat.  No one is thrilled.

                        Mr. Smith, may I call you, Johnny? 
                        My name is Ben Cartwright.  Not
                        the one from the Ponderosa.  As
                        you might have guessed.

          He smiles trying to be friendly but it comes off as vaguely
            patronizing.

                        Johnny, we just heard three days
                        of evidence.  I, for one, didn't
                        hear anything that would begin to
                        raise the first hint of doubt in
                        my mind.  Ten people at this table
                        agree with me.  You want to go
                        through the evidence again.  Fine. 
                        I'll go down that road with you. 
                        But at least give us a reason 
                        why you still have doubts.  Because
                        that's the fundamental issue here:
                        Reasonable Doubt.

          Johnny nods, he understands and he has no answer...  he
            continues to sift through evidence in front of him...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I just want to be sure we haven't
                        missed anything before we return
                          a verdict that could cost this
                        young man his life.

                        "His life?"  The guy's gonna get
                        twenty five years at the most,
                        which means with parole he'll be

                        Johnny?

          The other jurors nod, murmuring their agreement... and
          displeasure with Johnny...

                        He's right... We already heard
                        the evidence... three whole days
                        in that courtroom... etc.

          Johnny also knows that what happens to the defendant in
          prison, no matter how terrible, is not relevant to these
            proceedings... but then his hand touches...


          CLOSE ON AFFIDAVIT

          We see the words:  "Witness Statement to Police, Walter
          Beckly, 75..." (And although we don't need to see it,
          this document would have been signed by the witness.)

          as he goes into a vision:


  2222EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE PARKING LOT - NIGHT - VISION

          Johnny, hunched over slightly and dressed in an old man's









































                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: UNREASONABLE DOUBT - ACT TWO - 5/5/02 - WHITE-2  22.

          clothes, is walking a TINY DOG along the edge of the
          parking lot when an OLD CONVERTIBLE tricked out with
          chromed rims and a bright paint job barrels into the lot. 
          Winters is at the wheel, a tough-looking teen-aged buddy
          riding shotgun, another in the back.  RAP MUSIC BOOMS
          from multiple speakers, overwhelming the faint strains of
            CLASSICAL MUSIC coming from an old transistor RADIO clipped
          to the breast of Johnny's jacket.

          Irritated, Johnny watches the convertible pull up in front
          of the convenience store, passing a parked econo car. 
          The three boys spill out and rambunctiously enter the
          store.

          Johnny's about to walk away when he notices a third 
          vehicle -- an old Chrysler SEDAN -- idling in a far corner
          of the lot.  The car has a subtle "Christine" vibe -- an
          ominous feeling we can pick up on.  Johnny eyes it
          curiously, trying to see if anyone's at the wheel, but
          it's too dark.  Then his dog tugs on the leash and he
          walks on.


  22A22ACLOSE ON JOHNNY

          As he turns... revealing we're back in the jury room... 
          only a second has passed in real time.

                                        JOHNNY
                        There were three cars.

          A beat as the others fall silent, puzzled by the non
            sequitur.

                                        LEADING CITIZEN
                        Three cars?  What do you mean,
                        three cars?

                                        JOHNNY
                                  (repeating)
                        There's a discrepancy in the
                        witness testimony. 
                                (beat)
                        Both witnesses said there were
                        just two cars in the parking lot,
                        but one of them -- the Old Man --
                          actually saw three.

                        Two, three, what's the difference?

          Johnny's doubt is largely instinctive, a response to that
          ominous car, but Agatha Christy immediately understands
          what it means:

                        The difference, if it's true, is
                        there could've been another witness
                        who didn't come forward... or
                        even another suspect.

                        Wait a second.  I heard the old
                        guy say in court there were two
                        cars, didn't I?

                        We all did.  But it's not what he
                        told the police in his affidavit.

          And he puts the document back onto the table.  A beat of
            surprise, then Agatha Christy skeptically picks up the
            document, dons her reading glasses and starts turning the
          pages, using her index finger to guide her through the
          text...


          HER POV - CLOSE ON THE AFFIDAVIT

          As seen through the magnifying lenses: the text ENLARGED,
          the field of view slightly distorted around the edges. 
          The tip of Agatha Christy's index finger moves down a
            paragraph describing the Old Man's account -- and stops
          on the word "three."


          RESUME

          as she looks up, surprised.

                                        AGATHA CHRISTY
                        Why, he's right.  The witness did
                        tell the police there were three
                        cars.

                        Then why'd he change his story
                        when he testified?

                                        FEATHER
                        Maybe he just made a mistake at
                        first.

                        I don't think so.

                        If it was so important, the defense
                        would have said something about
                        it in court.

                        I can't just ignore what I know.

          Now, for the first, Leading Citizen begins to lose a little
          of that rigid self-control...

                                        LEADING CITIZEN
                        What you "know?"
                                (to others)
                        Do you believe that?  "What he
                        knows."
                                (growing frustration)
                        That kid Winters is guilty.  We
                        have to find him guilty.  And no
                          sideshow "medium" is going to
                          convince me otherwise.

                                        FAN MAN
                        "Psychic."

                                        LEADING CITIZEN
                        What?

                                        FAN MAN
                        Mediums communicate with the dead,
                        or, more accurately, their
                          disembodied spirits.  Mister
                        Smith's visions, as I understand
                        them, are touch-initiated and
                        involve abilities such as
                          "psychometry," or sensing images,
                          histories and impressions from
                          objects; "clairvoyance:" sensing
                        events in the past and future;
                        some "clairsentience" perhaps...

          He realizes the others are staring at him as if he just
          grew a third eyeball.  Even Johnny's taken aback.

                                        FAN MAN
                          ...abilities which are generally
                        considered "psychic."
                                (meekly)
                        Generally.

          A long beat as he stares down at the table.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: UNREASONABLE DOUBT - ACT TWO - 04/26/02 - PINK  27.


    22ACONTINUED: (7)22A

          Then Leading Citizen rises, barely able to contain his
          disgust at the direction these deliberations have taken.

                                        LEADING CITIZEN
                        Fine.

          He stands and crosses to the small evidence table...

                                        LEADING CITIZEN
                        If you think that Carl Winters
                        didn't kill that man, then
                          please...

          He picks up the gun, SMACKS it down in front of Johnny.

                                        LEADING CITIZEN
                        ...tell us who did.

          He steps back a bit and eyes Johnny.  An odd, expectant
          beat as Johnny studies the gun in front of him, and then,
          somewhat gingerly, picks it up...  SUDDENLY THE SCENE
          PIVOTS AROUND JOHNNY AND CHANGES TO...


  2323INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT - VISION

          Now Johnny's wearing a dark, nondescript jacket and
          pointing the gun at a 30ish PAKISTANI CLERK who stands
          facing him near the counter, a telephone receiver in his
          hand, frozen with fear.  We can hear the sound of RAP
          MUSIC coming from the kids' convertible outside the store.

                                          JOHNNY/SHOOTER
                                (cold)
                        Open the register.

          The Clerk's still too scared to move.  Johnny takes a
          step forward, cocks the pistol.

                                          JOHNNY/SHOOTER
                        I said, open the register.

          And when the Clerk still doesn't move... tracking around
          Johnny to find, in a split reality, the jury in the
          background, in the jury room, watching him...

                                        FAN MAN
                        Well, was it Winters or not?


          CLOSE ON THE GUN

          as Johnny's index finger tightens on the trigger, the
          jury in the background.  CLICK!  The hammer hits an empty
            cylinder.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: UNREASONABLE DOUBT - ACT TWO - 5/5/02 - WHITE-2  28.


    23CONTINUED:23

          Only now, as we PULL BACK, we see we're back in:


  2424INT. JURY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Johnny still holds the gun, out of the vision.  Some of
          the jurors are eyeing him skeptically, others with an
            anticipation they can't fully hide.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I... don't know.  

          A few jurors chuckle, shake their heads.  Johnny's still
            disturbed by what he experienced. 

                                        JOHNNY
                                  (struggling)
                        He was wearing a dark sweatshirt...
                          jeans...

                                        SPORTS NUT
                                  (sarcastic)
                        And what color were his socks?

                                        NIGHT SCHOOL
                        Carl Winters was wearing a dark
                        sweatshirt that night.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The man who did this... he'd done
                        it before... robbed small
                          convenience stores... 

                                        BRASSY
                        Like you have to be a psychic to
                        figure that out.

                                        JOHNNY
                        But they're always privately owned,
                        not chain stores... because there's
                        less security in Mom and Pop
                          stores...

                        A gun makes you a professional in
                        this business.

                        The cashier was too slow.  He
                        killed a man just for being...
                        too slow.

          A somber beat around the table.

                                        LEADING CITIZEN
                                  (impatient)
                        Look at the gun in your hand, my
                        friend.  It's the murder weapon,
                        is it not?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yes, this was the murder weapon.

                                        LEADING CITIZEN
                        We saw the defendant with that
                        gun on the security video... 

                                        JOHNNY
                                  (correcting him)
                        We saw the defendant with "a" gun
                        on the tape.  We don't know if it
                        was this one.  There's nothing --
                        no fingerprints, no hard evidence --
                        proving this was Winters gun.

                        Perhaps he wiped it before he
                        tossed it in the dumpster.

                        Sure, he's not a complete dummy.

                                        LEADING CITIZEN
                        Does anyone here buy the
                          defendant's story that the gun on
                        the tape was a toy?  And that he
                        can't find it now?
                                (no responses)
                        Of course not.  Because there's
                        only one gun.  That one.  The
                        murder weapon.

          Fan Man eyes Johnny.

                                        FAN MAN
                        Nothing else, Johnny?

          Johnny looks around at the other stony faces.

                        Face it.  He's guilty.  

          Concurring nods all around.

                        I think it's time we vote again,
                        and if Mr. Smith is still the
                        only hold-out...
                                (looking at Johnny)
                        ...then I hope he will act
                          responsibly and change his vote. 
                          I believe that's how the jury
                        system is supposed to work, Mr.
                        Smith.

          Johnny looks around the table at the others...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I've never been on a jury before. 
                          Probably no one like me has.  But
                        I have a doubt.  Is it reasonable
                        or not?  I don't know yet.

          But even Fan Man is against him at this juncture...

                        If you saw someone else doing it

                                  implied)

          The others just eye him with growing irritation.  Only
          Vic seems affected.  As Johnny takes note of this...

          And as Johnny stares at Vic, who looks back at him, floored --

          Johnny doesn't answer directly, just holds his look.

                        I know twelve people like us sent
                        him to prison.  Maybe they were
                        in a rush to get home too.  And
                        didn't give him the benefit of a
                          doubt...

                        All those who think the defendant's
                        guilty, raise your hands.

          Ten hands go up, but Vic, now lost in thought, looks like
          he hasn't even heard her.

          Finally Vic turns to her, his voice somber.

                        I'm not saying I believe everything

  2727EXT. COURTHOUSE - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING


  2828INT. JURY ROOM - NIGHT

          The Judge studies a handwritten note while the Bailiff
          stands in the doorway, arms crossed.  A longish beat,
          then the Judge looks up at the jurors, who are beginning
          to look tired and disheveled.  Clutter has accumulated on
          the table, further evidence that some time has passed.

                                        JUDGE
                        Well, this has to be the oddest
                        case of "jury tampering" I ever
                        heard of.

          He looks back at the note, trying to puzzle it out.

                                        JUDGE (CONT'D)
                        What did he do?  "Brain wash"
                        Mister Goodman?

                        He didn't force me to change my
                        vote.  I made my own decision.  

          The Judge considers the bizarre situation.

                                        JUDGE
                        This may make for an interesting
                        appeal after all.  But in the
                          meantime, why don't you all give
                        it another shot.

                        I can't believe this.  The bailiff

                        Whoa, Cheetos, my favorite.

          He's yanked the chips from the woman's grocery bag. 
          Scared, she tries to leave, but another kid blocks her.

                                        KID TWO
                        What's the rush, baby?

          He runs his hands over her arms.

                                        KID TWO
                        Don't you like us?

                                        FEMALE WITNESS
                          Please...

          She backs away -- right into Kid One, who's moved behind
          her.  Now he wraps his arms around her shoulders as he
          nuzzles her ear.

                                        KID ONE
                        Yeah, stick around.  We're gonna
                        have a little party.

          All the kids laugh as the woman struggles to get away.

                                        JOHNNY/CLERK
                        Leave her alone!  The camera's
                          recording you!

          He points up at a video camera mounted on the ceiling. 
          The kids turn to look, giving the woman a chance to break
          free and run out the door.  And as Johnny/Clerk watches
          helplessly and the kids laugh, Kid Two leaps onto the
          counter and pulls a can of spray-paint from his baggy
          jeans.  In the b.g., Winters crosses to a beer fridge. 
            Johnny/Clerk shouts at Kid Two --

                                        JOHNNY/CLERK
                        Hey, what are you doing?  Get
                        down from there!

          The teen ignores him, leering into the lens as he shakes
          the can, then mimicking Al Pacino in "Scarface" --

                                        KID TWO
                        Say hello to my little friend!

          He spray-paints the lens.

                                        JOHNNY/CLERK
                        I'm calling the police!

                                        KID ONE
                        Hey, chill out, bitch, we're going.

          But as they laugh and start to leave, Johnny/Clerk notices
          that Winters has used the distraction to slip two quart
          bottles of beer under his jacket.  He quickly crosses to
          him and grabs his arm.

                                        JOHNNY/CLERK
                        I saw you stealing!  You put them
                        back.

          The bottles hit the floor with a CRASH, along with Winters'
            KEYCHAIN.

                                        WINTERS
                        Man, look at that mess.  "Yo,
                        Apu, clean up in Aisle Two."

            Johnny/Clerk shakes his head ruefully, then notices A
          SHADOW shifting slightly at the back of an aisle...


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: UNREASONABLE DOUBT - ACT THREE - 04/26/02 - PINK  40.


    33CONTINUED: (2)33

          And now TIME SLOWS, as if Johnny's awareness is
            highlighting this brief moment of seeing this shadow,
          which for the clerk was no big deal.  Another customer,
          perhaps, hidden by a rack of snack items... we'll never
          know because the vision ends.


    33A33ARESUME INT. JURY ROOM - ON JOHNNY

          As he comes out of the vision, intrigued by what he's
          seen but frustrated by what he didn't.  Vic and Fan Man
          are watching him now as he takes the bullet to the jury
          table, sits, then picks up the gun again with his other
          hand.  He holds each of them in his palms, like a human
          scale, and then he's back in the vision --


  3434INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT - VISION

          Johnny, now dressed as the shooter, is again pointing the
          gun at the terrified Pakistani clerk as we hear the sound
          of RAP MUSIC coming from outside.

                                          JOHNNY/SHOOTER
                        I said, open the register.

          Again, the Clerk doesn't move, but this time when Johnny's
          finger tightens on the trigger, the gun fires - BAM! 

          And now we go to EXTREME SLOW MOTION as --


          THE BULLET

          Halts its flight midway between Johnny and the Clerk while,
            simultaneously, the scene PIVOTS ON THE BULLET'S AXIS and
          JOHNNY AGAIN BECOMES THE TERRIFIED CLERK, eyes fixed on
          the still-spinning slug, now the literal focal point of
          the scene, PIVOTING AGAIN TO ASSUME JOHNNY/CLERK'S POV --
          the face of the real killer holding the gun blurred beyond
          recognition behind the spinning bullet.  Then NORMAL MOTION
          resumes and the bullet SLAMS into its destination and our
          subjective shot tumbles to the floor, eyes facing a
          sideways ANGLE toward the front door... and as we see the
          KILLER'S LEGS moving past him on the way to the cash
          register... hear the cash register OPEN behind him, the
          last thing the dying eyes see is Winters' car ROARING out
          of the parking lot.  The vision ends.


  3535RESUME - JURY ROOM

          As Johnny exhales, his hand unclenches, and the slug he
          was clutching rolls onto the table, stopping in front of
          an amazed Fan Man.  Everyone knows he had another vision.

                        The convertible was leaving the

          Leading Citizen's momentarily silenced as Johnny rises
          himself and knocks on the door.

          Clerk making change for the Female Witness -- as it was
          in turn "witnessed" by the store's security camera.

          working the remote, but Leading Citizen keeping a skeptical
            distance.  The debris from dinner has been removed.

                        No one's hiding in there.  The
                        camera doesn't lie. 

          But Johnny continues patiently watching the tape.

                        It also doesn't cover every corner.

          Fan Man nods, indicates the nearby convenience store

                        It doesn't even cover the back
                        door.

          Meanwhile, on the monitor, Winters and his gang have
          barreled in through the front door (which may or may not
          be included in the camera's field of vision) and begun 
          soundlessly harassing the Female Witness.  Feather reacts
          with quiet anger.

                        poor woman.

          Johnny glances at her, perhaps recalling the earlier vision
          of her own attack.

                        there.

          He's FROZEN the image at the point where Winters' "gun" --
          real or replica -- is exposed.  (And on the video we might
          note that the gun is in the Female Witness' line of sight,
          but not necessarily the Clerk's.)

          Sports Nut advances the tape to the point where Kid Two
          jumps on the counter, leers into the lens, then spray
          paints it, causing the screen to be obscured.

          He reverses the tape, and now Kid Two hops back down from
          the counter, the gang "reverse-harasses" the Female
          Witness, then backs out of the store.

                        I still don't see anything.

          The reverse motion continues:  Female Witness backs away
          from the register, returns her purchases to racks in the
          front of the store, and exits backwards as well.  Suddenly:

                        to snag shoplifters.  I think I
                        saw something in it.

          Sure enough, there's a convex security mirror in a back
          corner, angled so it could be seen from the register.

          Sports Nut slowly rotates a thumb wheel on the remote,
          and we PUSH IN on the monitor, zeroing in on that little
          mirror, until something darkens it... a shape!

          CLOSE ON AFFIDAVIT

          We see the words: "Sworn testimony of Emily Tager, 30..."
          as a vision begins:


  3737INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT - VISION

          Once again, a cash register drawer slides open and a hand
          reaches in for some coins.  But this time we PAN UP to
          see the actual clerk, who then hands the change to Johnny,
          who's dressed as the Female Witness.  And yes, it seems
          comical for an instant but only an instant because the
          horror is very real for Johnny/Female Witness when the
          door opens and Winters and his crew burst in and move to
          the counter.  This time the angles are different as we
          replay the scene, emphasizing the teens' menace from
          "Johnny's" perspective.  Winters shoulders Johnny/Female
          Witness aside as he addresses the clerk.

                        Whoa, Cheetos, my favorite.

          He's yanked the chips from Johnny's grocery bag.  And now
            Johnny/Female Witness' heart is starting to pound as he
          tries to leave, only to find another thuggish teen blocking
          him.

                        What's the rush, baby?

          He runs his hands over Johnny/Female Witness' arms as the
          camera brings us in close -- and it isn't just weird,
          it's unsettling and distressing, as though we're also
          feeling what it's like to be trapped and pawed like this.

                          Please...

          He backs away -- right into Kid One, who wraps his arms
          around Johnny/Female Witness' shoulders as he nuzzles his
          ear.

                                        KID ONE
                        Yeah, stick around.  We're gonna
                        have a little party.

            Johnny/Female Witness struggles to get away but the boy
          holds him easily, laughing... and then they're all
            laughing, as the boys' faces start to whirl around
            Johnny/Female Witness and 'she' glimpses the GUN in
            Winters's waistband... until finally the Clerk shouts:

          And as the kids turn to look up at the camera,
            Johnny/Female Witness is finally able to wrench free and

          as Johnny/Female Witness -- terrified, humiliated -- rushes
          from the store.  'She' gets to her car, fumbles frantically
          trying to unlock the door, as she sees Kid One and Kid
          Two exit and get into the convertible.  Finally, she gets
          the door open -- just as there's a muffled "popping" SOUND
          from inside the store.  (We've heard the sound of the
          beer bottles breaking in Johnny's prior vision and that's
          what we're hearing here.)

            Johnny/Female Witness is behind the wheel now, trying to
          start the engine as Winters exits, jumps in the driver's
          seat and high-five Kid One.  He starts up his car -- and
          the RAP MUSIC BLASTS AGAIN (and this would presumably
          cover the sound of the real gunshot, which will happen in
          the next moment) -- before he backs up and ROARS out of
          the lot.  And as we rotate into a dual reality -- to see
          the jury sitting at their table, seemingly in the parking
          lot, looking at --

          who turns to see - in a rack focus - the face of Feather...
          and we're back --

          As Johnny comes out of the vision, shaken but with an
          insight not only into this witness, but into Feather as
          well.  The impact of this vision is particularly profound
          because it's the first time he's ever known what it feels
          like to be a woman, to feel in danger of being raped...
          he looks at Feather with great compassion, speaks softly
          to her and only her... his eyes locked on hers...

                          helpless the woman in the store
                        felt when that gang grabbed her. 
                        No man could ever know what it's
                        like to be threatened that way.

            Feather's eyes narrow as he seems to be able to see into
          her soul... she breaks eye contact with him...

                        she heard the sounds from the
                        store - two 'quick pops', she
                        said in court... and sure, it
                        must've sounded like gunshots...
                        after all she saw a man with a
                        gun inside -- it's a logical

                          heartbeat is pounding louder than
                        any sound in the real world?

          Feather looks back and re-establishes eye contact with
          Johnny again and as she does...


4040A MEMORY FLASH OF THE ALLEY

          We saw earlier: Feather is about to be raped... her
          assailant's hand clamped over her mouth, her eyes wide
          with terror.

                        with that woman.  She was a victim
                        here too.  But assault is not
                        murder.  It's not the crime that
                        Carl Winters is on trial for today. 
                        If we're not sure he killed the
                          clerk...

          Feather takes it in and is obviously moved by Johnny's
            argument.  But Leading Citizen, sensing his lone support

                        We came in here knowing what we
                        had to do, knowing the truth! 
                        But then you let this... this
                        nutcase... twist it all around. 
                        It's like he's put you in a trance. 
                        You're not thinking for yourselves!

                                        SPORTS NUT
                        Whoa, calm down, buddy.

                                        LEADING CITIZEN
                        I'm not your buddy and I'll calm
                        down when I've got a reason.
                                (to all of them)
                        Shadows and broken bottles.  That's
                        what he's feeding you!  You call
                        that reasonable doubt?  I call it

          Johnny moves to face him... speaks evenly without any

          Johnny rises to confront him diplomatically...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Mister Cartwright, if you force
                        the state to try him again, all
                        the evidence we discovered will
                        come out at the next trial.

                                        LEADING CITIZEN
                        At least the next jury won't have
                        to deal with you...

          On his last words, Leading Citizen pokes Johnny in the
          chest with a finger as punctuation... as he does, we ramp
          to Johnny's face as a vision begins... and perhaps we
          stutter our way into the following scene with each poke
          of the finger...

                                        LEADING CITIZEN
                        ...and once you're out of the
                        way...
                                (another poke)
                        ...they'll see the truth...
                                (another poke)


  4242EXT. CITY BASKETBALL COURT - DAY - VISION

          As before, we see Leading Citizen, in a youth league
          coach's jacket, as he soundlessly shouts encouragement at
          a young boy going for a lay-up -- until his eyes go past
          him to the tricked-out SUV slowly rounding the corner, a
            passenger window powering down as a young gangbanger with
          a GUN leans out.  Moving to find Johnny standing there,
          watching as --


          ANGLE - LEADING CITIZEN

          is rushing toward the basket, shouting again soundlessly,














                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: UNREASONABLE DOUBT - ACT FOUR - 5/5/02 - WHITE-2  52.


    42CONTINUED:42

          the boy with the ball turning to him, puzzled, while the
          teen-agers on the sidewalk behind him duck for cover. 
          And then Leading Citizen is gathering up the wounded body
          of the boy, overwhelmed with shock and despair... carrying
          him in his arms to find help... as the vision ends.


  4343RESUME - JURY ROOM

          As Leading Citizen continues to confront Johnny.

                                        LEADING CITIZEN (CONT'D)
                        ...The man is guilty.  Guilty.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Who's guilty?  Winters, or the
                        gangbanger who almost killed your
                        son?

          And this time Leading Citizen just stares at Johnny for a
          stunned instant -- and then lashes out, SHOVING him hard! 
          The others react with alarm and concern, the men rising
          to restrain Leading Citizen.  Johnny waves them off.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's okay.  Leave him alone.

          He picks up his cane, then steps forward again, silently
          facing Leading Citizen.  A long look between the two men
          as Leading Citizen absorbs what he's done... a gamut of
          emotions playing across his face as anger gives way to
          grief, and the realization that Johnny's right - he's
          brought his own distinct bias into these deliberations. 
          He turns, takes in the faces of the other jurors -- not
          judging him, most showing sympathy for what he's going
          through -- then he sags into his chair, drained.

                                        LEADING CITIZEN
                                (hoarse)
                        Is it possible?  Am I judging the
                        wrong man?

                                        JOHNNY
                        We all enter this room with our
                        pasts, Mr. Cartwright.  Every one
                        of us.    

          A beat, then he nods almost imperceptibly -- an admission
          less of defeat than of acceptance.

                                        JUDGE (V.O.)
                        Have you reached a verdict?          DEAD ZONE: UNREASONABLE DOUBT - ACT FOUR - 5/9/02 - PINK-2  53.


  4444INT. COURTROOM - DAWN

          The jury is back in the jury box, Martha standing.

                                        MARTHA
                        We have, your honor.

                                        JUDGE
                        And how do you find?

                                        MARTHA
                        We find the defendant, Carl
                          Winters, not guilty... of all*
                          charges.*

            Winters's side of the courtroom erupts.  The Prosecutor
          reacts with disbelief.  Winters is hugged by his mother. 
          The Judge nods, takes it in stride.

                                        JUDGE
                        Members of the jury, this Court
                        thanks you.  You're free to leave.

          Off Johnny...


  4545INT. COURTHOUSE LOBBY - EARLY MORNING

          Johnny walks from the elevator into the much quieter lobby,
          his footsteps echoing on the polished floor.  In the
          background, other jurors filing out... Sports Nut telling
          Feather...

                        Yanks got to Pedro in the ninth...
                        Bernie Williams pops one over
                        second between three guys and it
                        falls, two runs score and we lose
                        two to one.

                        Curse of the Bambino.

          Sports Nut looks Feather over with new eyes and quickly
          says...

                                        SPORTS NUT
                        You know, there's a 24-hour sports
                        bar around the corner.  We can
                        get some breakfast and watch the
                          highlights...

          She smiles tentatively, nods.  As Johnny watches them go,
          Fan Man approaches, still excited...*




                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: UNREASONABLE DOUBT - ACT FOUR - 5/9/02 - PINK-2  54.


    45CONTINUED:45

                                        FAN MAN*
                        That was really intense...*

          Johnny braces himself for the unsolicited praise, but it*
          never comes, as Fan Man suddenly switches gears --*

                                        FAN MAN*
                                  (disappointed)*
                        ...but you couldn't tell us who*
                        did it, could you?*

          Taken aback, Johnny just shrugs.  But as Fan Man shakes*
          his head and walks away, he can't help but smile to*
          himself.  And now the defendant, family and friends are
          moving through the lobby and Johnny watches them... behind
          him, there's a distinctive WHINE...

                                        VIC
                        Why don't you?

          Johnny turns, looks at Vic.

                                        VIC
                        Go touch him and see what he's
                        gonna do with his second chance.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (evenly)
                        I'd be lying if I said I hadn't
                        thought about it.  But you know
                        what?  We've done what we can for
                        him.  Now it's his turn.

          At that moment, Winters glances over and sees Vic and
          Johnny looking at him... he pauses in his celebration to
          nod a very clear gesture of appreciation... and in this
          moment at least, it feels as though he's learned something
          from the experience.  He moves on.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Well, I'd better go over to Sheriff
                          Bannerman's office to describe
                        the car the real killer was
                        driving...
                                (pauses, recalling
                                that vision, then)
                        ...a sedan from the late sixties...
                          shouldn't be that hard to track
                        down.

          He stops to look at the mural of Lady Justice again, noting
            something that still seems a little "off."

                                        JOHNNY
                        Just wondering what she'd look
                        like without the blindfold.

          Vic smiles.  A beat between the two men, then they turn
          and move out of frame together.  And as the whine of the
          wheelchair fades, along with Johnny's footsteps, camera
          PUSHES IN on the mural, moving down from the blindfold,
          and lingering on those slightly lopsided scales...

                                                                              FADE OUT.
