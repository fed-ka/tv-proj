    Rooney on the table, bathed in soft blue light.  PAN from 
    his cell phone, attached by a cord, to a FLAT SCREEN TV. 
    It s maybe a foot above his face.  Rooney awakens.  Orients.

    THE TV SCREEN plays images - shot by Rooney s cell phone - 
    of carnival patrons.

                        guessing people s age and weight. 

    Rooney, under the guise of checking their I.D.s, records 
    their driver s licenses on his phone.  There s Dexter in the 
    b.g.  Eating cotton candy, watching him.

    Dexter enters, quickly cases the place:  kitchen, back door,

    Dexter ducks under police tape and enters this shit-hole 
    where hopes, dreams and junkies go to die.  It s a far cry 
    from the faux-cool of Freebo s place.  The floor is littered

    HIGH ANGLE TIME LAPSE as Dexter creates his kill room.  He 
    wrangles a large work light into place, turns it on and we 
    see the kill table.  Prepped and waiting.  Then he pivots 
    the light, briefly illuminating the photos of the two 
    murdered Coeds.  This is their shrine.


    ON THE WINDOW INSET of the back door.  The glass vibrates 
    with the music.  Dexter s face appears.  He picks the lock 
    and enters.  Checking the syringe in his cargo pants, the

    turns into the living room, and stops. 

    FREEBO IS ENGAGED IN A VICIOUS KNIFE FIGHT WITH A STRANGER 
    (Latino, mid 20s).  

    DEXTER WATCHES IN FASCINATION as this lethal pas de deux 
    takes place in front of the wall-to-wall wide screen TV.    
    A Music Video fills the room with MUSIC and EERIE LIGHT.

    THE STRANGER SPOTS DEXTER S REFLECTION in the large front 
    window and hesitates long enough for Freebo (never seeing 
    Dexter s face) to flee.  

    THE STRANGER ATTACKS DEXTER.  It s a violent, life-and-death 
    struggle.

    THE STRANGER WHIPS DEXTER against the front window; Dexter 
    banging his head so hard that his new temporary crown is 
    jarred out of his mouth.  He s stunned for just a moment. 

    THE STRANGER HURLS DEXTER INTO THE WINDOW AGAIN, this time 
    cracking (but not breaking) it.  Finally, in this desperate 
    face-to-face battle, Dexter gets the upper hand and expertly 
    PLUNGES THE STRANGER S OWN KNIFE INTO HIS CHEST.

                        My parents brought my brother Ramon 
                        and me to this wonderful country when 
                        we were young boys.  We left Cuba and 
                        Castro for the American Dream.  My 
                        youngest brother, Oscar, was born here 
                        in Miami... and he died here.  With 
                        his death, it s tempting to say the 
                        American Dream has turned into a 
                        nightmare.

                        But I don t think of Oscar s death as 
                        a nightmare.  I think of it as a wake-
                        up call.  An alarm ringing loud and 
                        clear that we have to come together.  
                        That we must break the cycle of

                        need to see you.  Right away.


    Dexter slips through the crime scene tape and enters to find 
    Miguel Prado standing in the middle of the room, his back to 
    Dexter.  He s staring at the intricate red yarn design 
    Dexter put up during his investigation.

    Dexter waits.  Silent, respectful.  Miguel, his back still 
    to Dexter, gestures to the web of red yarn.

    begins to recreate the fierce fight he had with Oscar.

                        the Sheriff Department s database for 
                          information on my dead brother?

    Busted, Dexter takes his time in answering.

                        Like you, sir, I wanted to understand

                        you ve given up men, booze and 
                          cigarettes, running your mouth is the

                        the real world.  This case is as high-

                        But there are political ramifications

                        part of moving up the chain.

    This centuries-old Cuban great hall is the scene of Oscar 
    Prado's wake.  Everyone from the Mayor to the poorest of the 
    poor have gathered.  

    DEXTER enters, surveys the landscape...

    A CLUTCH OF KIDS from Oscar s Youth Club mill about, lost.

    RAMON PRADO is off in a corner with some Sheriff colleagues. 
    He s tense, upset.

    At one end of the great hall lies OSCAR PRADO S open coffin, 
    people filing by.  

    MIGUEL PRADO in the middle of a group of well-wishers.

                        He touched so many people, so many 
                        hearts.

    The Mayor, the D.A. and others surround him.  As they do, he 
    spots Dexter and nods.  After the dignitaries pay their 
    respects, an Old Woman in a wheelchair approaches.  Dexter 
    watches as Miguel has time and humility for her.  Truly a 
    man of all the people.


    An old-time cop tavern.  Deb at the bar, looks up.

    HER POV:  dozens of photographs of cops who have passed on.  
    In front of each frame is a tiny shelf with shot glasses on 
    each one.  Deb s gaze lands on the photo of Harry.

    The Bartender fills her shot glass with cranberry juice.  
    Deb looks to the clock.  It s almost eight.  Then to the 
    door.  Finally, she toasts her father and downs her drink.

    So tired of it all, his shoulders sag.  Miguel notices 
    Dexter s emotional reaction from the other side of the hall 
    and, affected, starts toward him.  Just then, his arm is 
    grabbed by LaGuerta, who s just arrived.

    The door opens.  Deb looks up expectantly.  It s Batista.  A

    making a fresh batch of chocolate pudding, while leafing 
    through her Hotel Management brochures.  A dollop of pudding 
    spills onto the counter.  She scoops it up with her finger 
    and, still moving to the music, sucks it clean.  


    Dexter in the chair as the Dentist finishes implanting that 
    pesky crown.  Dexter smiles broadly.  Whole again.  


    LaGuerta at her desk.  Paperwork.  She looks up as her squad 
    finishes for the day.  Deb gets in the elevator.  


    Deb jabs the  down  button.  Batista calls out.

                                        BATISTA
                        Hold the elevator.

    Deb does and Batista enters.  An awkward beat.  Then -

                                        DEBRA
                        Asshole.

    She eyes the new gold shield, allows a smile.

                                        DEBRA
                        Oh, sorry... Sergeant Asshole.

    Batista grins, then leans out of the elevator.

                                        BATISTA
                        Masuka, Ramos, Quinn.  Vamonos!  We 
                        got some celebrating to do.

                                        DEBRA
                        After last night, you can still drink?

                                        BATISTA
                        A man has his needs.  You can go back 
                        to your cute little cranberry juice.

                                        DEBRA
                        Tastes like shit.  I m having a mojito

    The others join them.  Festive and ready.  


    LaGuerta still at her desk.  She looks up as the elevator 
    doors close.  Neither Batista nor any of the others even 
    thought to invite her.


    Dexter enters, a bounce in his step.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        I mean, yeah, I m still me.  Always 
                        will be.  But this life, this mission,

    Rita s at the counter, scooping whipped cream onto the 
    pudding, still grooving to the song.  

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        ... it s all mine now.  
                                (beat)
                        Change is good.

    He pauses, looks to Rita.  She smiles that golden smile. 

                                        RITA
                        Hey you.

                                        DEXTER
                        Hey yourself.

    He drops his stuff on the counter.

                                        DEXTER
                        That music again?  Chocolate pudding 
                        again?

    Rita looks at the pudding and draws a sharp breath, 
    realizing something.

                                        RITA
                        ... shit.

    Dexter crosses to her.

                                        DEXTER
                        What?

                                        RITA
                        Oh my God... I ve done this before.

                                        DEXTER
                        What do you mean?

                                        RITA
                        I m pregnant.

                                                                    SMASH TO BLACK.

                                        THE END
