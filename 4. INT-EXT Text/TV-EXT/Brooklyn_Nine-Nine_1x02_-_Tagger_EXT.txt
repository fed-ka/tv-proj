  Trevor and his father exit their CAR.  A SQUAD CAR covered in 
    GRAFFITI D PENISES, SIRENS BLARING, pulls up.

                What is this?  You can t do this.
                      (pointing to the car)
                Get that out of here.

                              JAKE
                Excuse me, sir.

                                DEPUTY COMMISSIONER PODOLSKI
                What are you doing?  I told you to back 
                off, Peralta.

                              JAKE
                First of all, it s Detective Santiago, 
                Amy Santiago.  Secondly, I am arresting 
                your son -- which, as I say it aloud, 
                sounds like a very unwise decision --
                      (looks at Holt)
                -- but one that I am making.  Again, my 
                name is Amy Santiago.  

                                DEPUTY COMMISSIONER PODOLSKI
                You re being stupid, Peralta.  Don t be 
                stupid.  I can make your life miserable.

                              HOLT
                  Commissioner, please don t talk to my 
                  detective in that tone.  If you have a 
                  complaint, you can take it up with me.

                              JAKE
                Yeah, get him, Captain!

                                DEPUTY COMMISSIONER PODOLSKI
                You just made a very powerful enemy, 
                Holt.  I m going to be watching you, both 
                of you, like a hawk.  

                              HOLT
                You re going to have to try a little 
                harder if you want to scare me.  I ve 
                been an openly gay cop since 1987.  
                You re not the first superior officer to 
                threaten me.  You know how I m still 
                standing here?  Because I do my job, and 
                I do it right.

                              JAKE
                Day-umn, Son.

                              HOLT
                Don t say son.

                              JAKE
                Yup.  Deputy Commissioner, you can pick 
                up Trevor at the Nine-Nine.
