ON a housing project in the industrial outskirts of Boston.
The
BANGING seems to flutter away, leading us along, searching... to a
tiny balcony, one of dozens, ten stories up.
And there, the source
of the sound --
-- A SHEET, snapping in the wind.
The umbrella-like clothes line
on which it hangs bangs against a dirty glass door as if trying to
get in.
THROUGH THE GLASS DOOR a woman paces inside, agitated.
The VOICES
rise over the banging, becoming intelligible --
The car speeds down the country road, past old stone walls, out
into rolling meadow, its winding route taking it across the western
Berkshires, farther and farther into the glorious hills.
The white-steepled church, five stores and gas station of Hillsdale
lie in a forgotten notch in the hills.
Nell is pumping gas at a country station.
She is alone at the
pump.
As she finishes, she hears a BABY CRYING.
She looks up.
She is immediately drawn by the sound.
She moves to a car at another pump.
The car is empty.
The windows
are rolled up.
She peers into the car, through the window, and
sees a toddler in a car seat.
The child is crying.
Nell looks
around, no one is there.
She makes faces at the baby, coos to it.
NELL
Hello Baby...
She does a peek-a-boo game, and the baby stops crying, the baby
even starts to giggle.
A VOICE from behind.
MOTHER (O.S.)
What's going on, what happened?
Nell turns.
The Mother is a busy country mom, arms filled with
stuff from the gas station's market.
NELL
She's okay.
She woke up and she
saw she was alone.
The mother has the car open and the baby is smiling now.
MOTHER
Say thank you, Spencer.
(too much of an
explanation)
I was getting her something to
drink.
She's been crying all
day...
NELL
That's all right.
MOTHER
Of course you know, how many
children do you have?
NELL
None.
MOM
Then you're a teacher.
Nursery
school.
NELL
No.
MOM
You just... you seem like someone
who takes care of children, lots
of children.
NELL
Maybe... maybe someday.
I'd like
that.
The woman smiles in something like sympathy, and gets in her car.
When she does, we see a friendly GAS STATION ATTENDANT appear
behind Nell.
NELL (cont'd)
Umm, I'm a little lost.
GAS STATION ATTENDANT
Where you going?
Nell takes out her computer drawn directions and an old map.
NELL
They sent me directions and I've
got a map, but it's kind of
confusing.
Here... it's a place
called Hill House?
His helpful attitude changes dramatically.
GAS STATION ATTENDANT
Hill House.
He takes the map book and tears out the page and crumples it up.
NELL
What are you doing?
GAS STATION ATTENDANT
You don't want to go there.
He turns abruptly and walks away.
NELL
Did I say something wrong to you?
Nell slams the Buick door, and breathing hard, starts the engine.
She gets control, and puts the car in gear.
She's shaken.
Badly.
Nell's Buick bounces over a country road.
The car works its way up
into the steep, switchbacking hills.
Nell's car speeds through the trees, climbing the hills, higher and
higher into the awesome solitude.
The gate stands immense.
Silent.
Forbidding.
Beyond them a
gravel drive curves away through the trees.
Nell kills her car,
gets out, instructions in hand.
No one in sight.
A long beat.
She reaches in and blows the HORN.
The HORN shatters the air, rackets off the trees beyond the gate,
echoing.
Silence.
Nell blows the HORN a sustained staccato in annoyance.
The echo
replies in a terrible, deafening battering of sound.
Nell covers
her ears.
Silence once again.
In a fit of agitation she goes to the padlock and rattles it.
It's
locked good.
She turns --
-- and there is a man right behind her.
It is MR. DUDLEY, his hair
tied back like an ex-hippie.
He stands between Nell and her open
car door, weed spear in hand.
He smiles at her -- rough, dirty,
massive.
MR. DUDLEY
What do you want?
NELL
Oh!
You scared me.
MR. DUDLEY
Me?
No.
What are you doing here?
NELL
Are you Mister Dudley, the
caretaker?
MR. DUDLEY
Yeah, I'm Mister Dudley, the
caretaker.
What are you doing
here?
NELL
I'm with Dr. Marrow's group.
I'm
supposed to check in with Mrs.
Dudley up at the house.
Is she
here?
She hands him the directions.
He glances at them.
She uses the
distraction to get into her car.
MR. DUDLEY
Maybe she is...
The car rumbles up the drive toward the carport.
Her car sits in front of the house, tiny, alone.
Its brake lights
go off.
The finger-like pillars of the car port seem like a hand pinning
the car in place under the House's gaze.
Nell gets out of the car.
Nell stares, daunted... yet there is something about the House.
A
romance in its lilac heavy Gothic decay.
Nell feels it, is drawn
to it.
Nell, suitcase in hand, climbs the steps to the front doors.
On
closer inspection, the snaking shapes of the carved doors depict a
Garden of Eden.
At center on the knocker, a tarnished silver Adam
takes the forbidden fruit from his counterpart Eve.
Nell lifts Adam and knocks heavily.
There is no answer.
Nell
looks around for some sign of life.
Off to one side is a LADDER and PAINT CANS.
Somebody must've been
touching up the window trim.
When she looks back the door is AJAR a fraction of an inch.
NELL
Hello?
Hello?
Mrs. Dudley?
Mrs.
Dudley, are you here?
Anybody?
Tentative, she pushes it open into --
Marrow slams the door on the passenger side of Todd's car.
Mary
sits there, moaning, glass covering her eye, blood spilling out
around the edges.
Luke is on her side of the car.
LUKE
Keep your head back, that's it.
Todd opens his door.
Marrow hands him a key.
MARROW
Here's my key to the gate.
Call
me the second you know anything.
Todd takes it, jumps in.
The two men watch the car drive away.
LUKE
That could have been worse.
MARROW
Yeah.
As they turn back, Marrow taps Luke.
MARROW
Luke, can I talk to you?
LUKE
Sure.
MARROW
Because... well, I know I can
trust you.
LUKE
Why?
MARROW
I've read your tests.
That was half a joke, and both men smile.
Now they're bonded.
MARROW (cont'd)
There's something... I... I didn't
tell you everyth1ng about the
house, and about Hugh Crain... but
I'm asking you not to repeat it.
LUKE
I can keep a secret.
They go in.
The house is outlined by the sky and clouds and the
moon.
They stand on the front steps.
Nell's car is right there under the
car port.
NELL
This is my car.
Theo gestures to a sports car on the circular drive.
Two other cars
are with it.
They walk out into the driveway.
MARROW
And those are Luke's and mine.
LUKE
There's a carriage house around
back.
Together they approach a stable/carriage house off to one side of
the main House.
It looks old, unused.
They enter through a small
door.
The RED LIGHT on Marrow's DIGITAL VOICE RECORDER blinks.
The device
is in Marrow's jacket pocket, CONCEALED from Nell.
They're sitting
in Adirondack chairs on the long veranda behind the House.
Marrow,
beside her, observes.
MARROW
What did it smell like?
NELL
It was very specific.
MARROW
(so tell me...)
All right...
NELL
In the bathroom in my mother's
room, the toilet was next to an
old wooden table.
It smelled like
that wood.
MARROW
So... smell... is... Smell is the
sense that triggers the most
powerful memories.
And a memory
can trigger a smell.
NELL
I wasn't thinking about my
mother's bathroom.
MARROW
What happened after you smelled
it?
NELL
I looked at Theo.
She had a look
on her face.
MARROW
Like she smelled it too?
NELL
Yes.
MARROW
And then what happened?
NELL
I got more scared.
Marrow thinks about this.
MARROW
Hmm.
NELL
I'm sorry.
I'm messing up the
study.
MARROW
No you're not.
Something moved
you.
You saw something.
Nell looks to him.
He's sincere.
He believes her.
NELL
I don't know.
Maybe I...
"Didn't" she almost says.
She struggles, embarrassed.
NELL (cont'd)
I haven't been with people in a
long time.
Marrow settles in his chair, looks out at the forest.
MARROW
I really haven't either.
Nell peers at him, doubtful.
Is she being made fun of?
MARROW (cont'd)
I mean, I'm surrounded by people,
day in, dayout.
Students,
colleagues.
(beat)
But most of the time, even when
I'm with them... you know... It's
all about power, there's not much
room for actually getting to know
someone or having someone getting
to know you.
Nell's face flushes with compassion.
With longing.
Marrow looks at
her.
He's vulnerable.
Needing.
She doesn't dare hope.
The moment
lasts a few heartbeats.
He looks away.
A flicker of distress crosses Nell's face.
And then
she realizes Marrow is looking at --
-- Luke.
LUKE (cont'd)
You have to see something.
Nell stands at the railing of a stone balcony on the house's second
floor.
The air stirs her hair.
She peers up at the House's
roofline, its clusters of misplaced windows and other features like
so many screaming heads.
Chilled, she pulls her sweater closer.
Marrow comes out onto the
balcony from twin French doors behind her.
NELL
Are you coming to confess?
MARROW
I wish I were.
I wish I had done
it, then I could confess and you'd
be at peace.
That great moral
philosopher Frank Sinatra once
said to someone he loved, I wish
you had an enemy, so I could beat
him up.
She smiles.
NELL
Let's say it wasn't you.
Who did
it?
MARROW
I don't know.
NELL
It was a stupid thing to do.
MARROW
It was.
NELL
(for the absurdity
of the idea)
Welcome Home.
MARROW
You'll never see it again.
Mr.
Dudley's taking care of it.
(beat)
I'm sorry, Nell.
Can I show you
something you'd like to see?
NELL
(still too shaky
for enthusiasm)
Sure.
Nell hurries away from the House, across the rear lawn, ashamed at
herself as much as she is spooked.
In the distance Mr. Dudley is walking toward the House with cans of
paint cleaner an a ladder.
Nell stops, watching him.
He senses
her, pauses, and smiles.
Nell reacts.
Sees the ladder.
Then Mr. Dudley disappears into the
House.
Nell once again starts to hurry away, but looking back over her
shoulder, almost impales herself on the rusted iron fence of --
-- the tiny Crain family cemetery.
Nell catches herself.
A small
swinging gate bars the way.
She hesitates.
Nine moss-covered headstones show the wear of a long century.
Eight
small headstones, one large one.
A half dozen unmarked stones in
the grass: stillbirths.
Nell is drawn into the graveyard.
The large stone is RENE CRAIN'S.
The smaller ones are her children's.
Nell's heart is breaking as she moves among them: the various names.
One reads ADAM CRAIN APRIL 5th 1874 -- ... The rest of the date is
covered by growth.
She clears it away.
April 6th, 1874.
NELL
Only two days.
There is an EPITAPH, almost wiped out by lichens.
Nell kneels to
read it.
NELL (cont'd)
The blest are the dead / Who see
not the sight / Of their own
desolation...
Nell, disturbed but not knowing what to make of it, rises from the
gravestone, turns to the next.
ELISA CRAIN AUGUST 21ST, 1878 -- She
clears it away: August 21, 1878.
The blasphemous epitaph here:
NELL (cont'd)
A father's joy unjustly snatch'd
by a jealous God...
Nell is shaken, and dreading what she will find next, whirls to the
one behind her: WENDY CRAIN JANUARY 1 , 1880 -- She clears it away
-- January 1, 1880.
And its graven commandment, so familiar, so
comforting, now rings with terrible, malevolent promise:
NELL (cont'd)
Suffer the little children unto
me.
There are three more grave stones, and after clearing away the
brush, they too show that the babies died after a few hours, or a
day.
There's the same symbol on the graves of the children, a
cherub of death.
We've seen this image before.
Nell backs out of
the cemetery, afraid.
The enormous LOCKED gates are silhouetted against the moonlit sky.
The chain is dangling in the wind.
Hold on Nell's WINDOW, the light shining dim through the gauze
curtain.
It goes out.
The window stares from an arrangement of
other windows, stonework and doors... like an eye with a cataract in
a face howling in horror.
Nell stares at the tableaux of Hugh Crain.
In the morning light it
seems inert, cold, just a statue.
Luke and Theo enter.
Nell
doesn't seem to notice them until they're beside her.
THEO
Marrow said the same thing as last
night, he says --
(meaning, this is
on his now
doubtful word)
-- that he checked with Mrs.
Dudley.
And he says that she told
him that all the fireplaces in the
West Wing connect to the main
chimney.
He says that he thinks
that the flue was open, and with
the windstorm, he says that what
probably happened was some kind of
freak air current --
NELL
-- What do you think?
Theo considers, then looks at her, severe.
LUKE
(lowers his voice)
Don't tell the Professor; he'd
probably throw me out.
But test
taking is one of the ways I've
been supporting myself.
I
volunteer for every paid study
that they offer.
Of course
straight psych stuff doesn't pay
as much as the pharmaceuticals do,
or a good wound study.
Check it
out.
He rolls up his sleeve revealing large, livid SCARS at intervals too
regular to be anything natural.
LUKE (cont'd)
A thousand dollars each.
Am I
sick?
Yes.
Do you know why I
only date freshmen?
By the time
they're sophomores, they've
figured me out.
THEO
(get back on track!)
Mister very talky, would you
please say what it is about this
study that bothers you?
LUKE
The whole thing feels like
experimental misdirection.
Like
he says it's about one thing, a
psychological profile of
environmental effects on
insomnia... and that'd be a
legitimate study, but I think that
we've been subjected to an
academic bait and switch; he's
really looking at something else.
NELL
No.
No... Jim's not doing --
these things.
But there's a desperate, rising edge to Nell's voice.
Theo's, in
response, is quiet, sober... certain.
THEO
Then who is?
Come on, Nell.
Deep
down, if you really thought it
wasn't Jim, why wouldn't you be
leaving right this second?
Why
wouldn't you be afraid?
Really
afraid.
NELL
Because I don't want to ruin
things.
Because home is where the
heart is.
Theo is chilled by this answer which would only make sense to
someone out of her mind.
Nell looks up and sees the double staircase at the end of the
greenhouse... the one where Crain's wife killed herself.
And for a moment we see Crain's wife hanging there and then the
image is gone...
Four cars sit behind the massive, locked gate, as far from Hill
House as possible.
Marrow paces past the fence, staring out, the
road beyond leading out of this place, so close...
Luke digs with a pen knife at the marble footing below the gate.
No
easy way under it.
He stands and gazes at the razor-sharp spikes
twenty feet up.
There's no way to climb this.
THEO
Oh my God we need to call someone?
Marrow just looks at her and walks back to Nell's car.
Theo pulls Nell away from the drive.
Marrow stands back from Nell's
car where Luke belts in behind the wheel.
Luke eases the car forward to the gate.
He advances until the car's
bumper makes contact.
And then without further ado, REVS the
engine.
The Buick grinds into the heavy steel bars.
The chain tightens
around the two halves of the gate, but shows not the slightest
strain.
The car fishes back and forth against the gate, hurling a shower of
gravel on the other cars off to the side of the road.
Marrow, Nell
and Theo move back.
One of the Buick's headlights breaks.
The grill mashes in.
For a
long moment the car struggles against the Gate.
No good.
Luke
eases up.
Theo looks at Marrow.
Luke puts the car in reverse.
LUKE
Get the hell out of the way!
They back way up.
Luke vanishes up the drive in the car.
And then
the Buick comes around the corner, accelerating, slicing down the
gravel road.
The car SMASHES into it... and is STOPPED, collapsing, twisting in a
deafening hail of steel and glass.
The massive gate has BENT itself AROUND the car, holding it in its
steel-grip.
Nell understands, the house will not let her go.
She turns away
from the gate, faces the House, mesmerized by the beauty in this
monstrosity.
The House is calling her back, and Nell is drawn
towards it.
She starts walking...
Marrow hurries around the back of the car, staying clear of the lake
of gas spreading about it.
Luke rolls off.
Marrow helps him up,
and gets him away a safe distance.
LUKE
I'm okay.
Okay.
Just my chest.
Just my wind knocked out.
Marrow looks up at the gate.
It is even more impassible than before
with the gasoline-saturated wreck in it.
No way to try another
break-out either.
LUKE (cont'd)
Sorry about your car, Nell.
He turns around.
The others do too.
No Nell.
Luke and Theo look up.
Mute dread.
No Nell anywhere.
MARROW
Oh, no.
Against the early light of a rising sun, the silhouette of Hill
House. Every window and every door in the House is open, each and
every one CRYING OUT with a different, unintelligible voice, like a
soul, the soul of a child, escaping from each one.
Theo and Marrow stand on the far side of Nell's wrecked car.
On the
other side of the gate Mr. Dudley is undoing the chain.
Mrs. Dudley
stares at the ragged duo.
MRS. DUDLEY
(her final verdict)
City people.
Mr. Dudley can barely get one side of the gate open with the car
crushed in it.
Theo and Marrow emerge, dazed, into the real world
again.
MR. DUDLEY
You find out what you wanted to
know, mister?
Marrow stares at him, he's an exhausted man.
He walks away, Theo
beside him.
THEO
I'm not going back to New York
City.
I'm going to find an
apartment with a little flower
garden, where you can just see the
ocean and at night, when the wind
comes in just right, you can hear
the sound of the harbor.
What
about you?
MARROW
I'm a scientist.
I just conducted
an experiment.
Now I have to
write it up.
THEO
But the experiment was a failure.
Now, we could have him say this line...
MARROW
Was it?
But he should just look at her, and say the same thing with his
eyes.
We pull back.
The summer hills lie green, passing fast underneath.
Clearings loom
out of the forest ahead.
And there, its sprawling stone in the
sunshine, rises Hill House.
FADE OUT.
ALTERNATE ENDING
Theo and Marrow stand on the far side of Nell's wrecked car.
On the
other side of the gate Mr. Dudley is undoing the chain.
Mrs. Dudley
stares at the ragged duo.
MRS. DUDLEY
(her final verdict)
City people.
Mr. Dudley can barely get one side of the gate open with the car
crushed in it.
Theo and Marrow emerge, dazed, into the real world
again.
MR. DUDLEY
You find out what you wanted to
know, mister?
Marrow stares at him, he's an exhausted man.
He walks away, Theo
beside him.
As they walk away, the SOUND OF APPLAUSE comes up.
WE DISSOLVE TO:
Where we find Theo.
The House is beautiful today, it's sunny, there
are flowers outside, the mood has changed.
Theo is now softened,
she's found something better than what she had.
She goes into the
house.
The summer hills lie green, passing fast underneath.
Clearings loom
out of the forest ahead.
And there, its sprawling stone in the
sunshine, rises Hill House.
FADE OUT.
