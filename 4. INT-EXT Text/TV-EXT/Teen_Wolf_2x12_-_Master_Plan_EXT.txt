      Lit only by the blueish glow from the crescent moon in the 
      night sky, Scott McCall blinks, trying to see in the 
      darkness. All he can hear is his own nervous gasping until--

      SILHOUETTED BODIES flit by, bringing SOUND hurtling back. 
      People hurry off the bleachers, players rushing from the 
      field. Scott blinks and all is SILENT again. He searches with 
      his hearing, focusing on familiar voices.

                                    MELISSA (V.O.)
                    Scott! Scott, where are you?

      A PLAYER accidentally runs into a FAN charging off the 
      bleachers. The crash of bodies and shouts of panicked parents 
      BLASTS back at Scott in full volume.

      He spins toward the field. When he blinks again, his eyes are 
      GLOWING, the blue light from the moon replaced by the yellow 
      of his werewolf eyes.

      Now seeing with heightened vision, he glances from one person 
      to the next, finding neither Jackson or Gerard. 

      Eyes simmering back to normal, Scott spots a crowd gathering 
      on the field and races ahead, almost knocking into his 
      mother.

                    Are you okay?

                    hurt. Someone on the field.

      With Coach pulling his frightened players aside, Scott and 
      Melissa reach the body to discover--

      It s Jackson.

      Scott stops in his tracks, shocked at the sight. Lydia 
      hurtles past him, pushing aside lacrosse players twice her 
      size.

                                  LYDIA
                    Jackson? What s happening--What

                    Can we get a medic over here!

      Melissa kneels by Jackson s side and takes his wrist to feel 
      for a pulse. Then puts her ear to his chest. A quiet comes 
      over the waiting crowd.

                                    MELISSA
                    He s not breathing. No pulse.

                    Oh God--there s blood--there s 
                    blood on him.

      While Melissa locates punctures and tears on Jackson s 
      jersey, Isaac appears at Scott s side.

                                  SCOTT
                    Look.

      Isaac follows Scott s eyes to see BLOOD on the tips of 
      Jackson s fingers, perfectly matching the puncture wounds.

      Helpless, Coach can only watch while a tear-stained Lydia 
      kneels next to her former boyfriend.

                    Hold his head tilted up, okay?

      Lydia nods and gently puts her hands under Jackson s head. 
      His mouth lies open, still not breathing as Melissa tries to 
      get his heart started.

      A few feet away, Sheriff Stilinski turns from the scene, 
      glancing through the crowd.

                                  STILINSKI
                    Where s Stiles? Where s my son?

      With rising fear, he looks to Scott, Isaac and the other 
      players, none of whom can seem to answer.

      Under the FLASH OF RED AND BLUE lights, Melissa watches two 
      EMT s lift the BODY BAG containing Jackson into the back of 
      an ambulance.

      A CLEAR, VISCOUS LIQUID drips from the edge of the bag, just 
      catching Melissa s eye. Before she can do anything, however, 
      the AMBULANCE DRIVER slams the doors shut.

                                  AMBULANCE DRIVER
                    Thanks for your help, but we can 
                    take it from here.

                                    MELISSA
                    You know, I m going to have to give 
                      a statement. Why don t I just ride

                    Uh, I think that would be--

                    Perfect, great.

      Melissa jumps into the passenger side of the ambulance. The 
      confused Driver shrugs and gets in.


      Between the rows of cars, TWO PAIRS OF FEET move quickly. One

      Gripping an end of the body bag, Isaac pauses. Scott glances 
      around, then nods.

                    Okay, go.

      They quickly pass another row and reach Melissa s car. 
      Setting his end of the body bag down, Scott yanks out the car 
      keys and opens the driver s side door.

      Reaching in, he pulls the latch for the trunk. Leaving the 
      keys in the door, they move to the back and slip the body bag 
      inside.

      Isaac SLAMS the trunk closed and moves for the passenger 
      door. But then he looks up to find Scott paused in confusion.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 212"BLUE4/17/1221.

                    Gerard.


      Isaac and Scott look on the trunk of Melissa s car with

      HEADLIGHTS blaze over a collection of warehouses in a metal

      Scott and Isaac quickly get out with Argent following. They 
      open the back and pull the body bag from the SUV.

      Scott turns, listening. He hears him before he sees him. 
      Hands and feet POUNDING the pavement. Argent, Isaac and Scott 
      turn to see a FIGURE loping toward them. 

      Moving with grace and speed, Derek leaps up as if to attack.

      and a flash of his RED EYES.

                    his personal guard dog. And he put 
                    all this in motion so that Jackson 
                    could become even bigger and more

                    He wouldn t do that. If Jackson s a 
                    dog, then he s turning rabid. And 
                    my father wouldn t let a rabid dog

                    Of course not.

      Derek s chest. As he spits blood, ROARING in agony, a 
      partially transformed Jackson stands, lifting Derek right 
      over his head like he weighed nothing.

      TRISKELE. But different than the one tattooed to Derek s 
      back. Sharper, more aggressive.

                                  DEREK
                    It s their symbol. And it means 
                    they re coming.

                    Who?

                                  DEREK
                    Alphas.

                                  ISAAC
                    More than one?

                                  DEREK

                                  PETER
                    An Alpha pack. And they re not 
                    coming. They re already here.

      The three of them turn to eye the jagged TRISKELE on the door 
      while through the woods, somewhere not far off--


      An old blue Jeep rumbles to a stop between the bleachers on 
      an empty field. Scott and Stiles jump out and begin pulling 
      lacrosse gear from the back.

                                  STILES
                    You really think she s going to 
                    come back to you?

                                  SCOTT
                    I know she is. What about you and 
                    Lydia?

                                  STILES
                    The ten year plan for making Lydia 
                    fall in love with me might have had 
                    to stretch to fifteen, but the plan 
                    remains in motion.

                                  SCOTT
                    Why don t you just ask her out?

                                  STILES
                    Why don t you just get into goal 
                    and help me make captain like you 
                    promised?

      Stiles drops a bag full of lacrosse balls onto the grass 
      while Scott takes his position at goal.

                                  SCOTT
                    You know what I just realized? I m 
                    right back where I started.

                                  STILES
                    What do you mean?

                                  SCOTT
                    I mean no lacrosse. No popularity. 
                    No girlfriend. Nothing.

                                  STILES
                    Dude. You still got me.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 212"BLUE4/17/1242.

                                  SCOTT
                    I had you before.

                                  STILES
                    And you ve still got me. Life 
                      fulfilled.

      Ball in the pocket of his lacrosse stick, Stiles takes a 
      shooting stance.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Now remember. No wolf powers.

                                  SCOTT
                    Got it.

                                  STILES
                    No super-fast reflexes, super eye-
                    sight, hearing, none of that crap.

                                  SCOTT
                    Okay.

      Stiles winds back, but pauses again.

                                  STILES
                    You promise?

                                  SCOTT
                    Will you just take a shot already!

      Finally, with every bit of strength and concentration he can 
      muster, Stiles sends the ball flying.

      The world goes BLACK and is immediately followed by the 
      distinct sound of a BALL being caught in the net of a 
      lacrosse stick.

                                  STILES (V.O.)
                    I said no wolf powers!

                                                                          FADE OUT:
