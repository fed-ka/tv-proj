A two-story California Craftsman with a SOLD sign in the
front yard. Yukon SUV pulls into the drive and stops.
The driver's door opens and DEREK CHARLES steps out, a
handsome and likable African-American in his early 30's; a
guy who's fought hard to make himself a success in business
and life. Derek wears a business suit and the first thing he
does is cross the lawn to the SOLD sign.
With a new homeowner's look of satisfaction, Derek grips the
SOLD sign and pulls it out of the ground.
WOMAN'S VOICE
Derek?
D erek looks over to where his pretty wife BETH is standing
beside the SUV, holding their cute 2 year old son KYLE in her
arms. Beth shakes her head with amusement.
BETH
What are you going to do with that?
CUT TO:
ANGLING DOWN from a towering glass and steel office building
as Derek's Yukon enters the parking garage.
CUT TO:
Derek and Beth sit at a table on the outside deck that
overhangs a sheer drop to the canyon below. In the distance,
the LA basin sparkles like a diamond in the night.
Derek and Beth are happy but exhausted. In front of them is
an empty pizza box. Derek picks up a bottle of champagne and
pours some for Beth and himself. They're both a little
drunk.
BETH
Well, we toasted the house --
DEREK
Toasted Kyle --
BETH
Your promotion --
DEREK
But I've saved the most important toast
for last...
(raising his glass)
To my beautiful wife who I love and adore
more than anything in the world.
BETH
And to my handsome husband. I asked for
the moon and he gave me the stars.
hey clink glasses and drink.
BETH (cont'd)
Derek...
DEREK
(YAWNS)
Uh huh?
BETH
How would you feel about trying out that
mirror again? This time in our own bed.
DEREK
(perks up)
Yeah? Give the magic mirror another test
drive?
BETH
You know how I like looking at your sexy
butt.
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
DEREK
(LAUGHS)
Beth, you are so bad.
BETH
Isn't that WHY you married ME?
CUT TO:
Derek arrives to find Lisa sitting at his outer desk in
Patrick's place. She looks up and smiles. She's not wearing
her glasses and her hair is down giving her a softer, less
severe look.
LISA
Hi.
Remember me?
DEREK
Lisa Sheridan, Girl Temp.
Where's
Patrick?
LISA
Out with the flu. I did some trading
with the other temps and wrangled your
desk. I hope that's okay.
D
EREK
Uh... sure.
Looking over at the assistant outside the other corner
office.
DEREK (cont'd)
Hey Marge.
MARGE
Good morning, Derek.
Back to the temp.
DEREK
Grab your pad and follow me.
Derek goes into his office.
Lisa collects her things and
does as told.
Derek, Beth and Kyle are surrounded by office workers making
a fuss over Beth and Kyle. Even Joe Gage comes out of his
office to embrace Beth and chat.

Lisa watches from a distance. Her face betrays no emotion.
After a moment, she turns and enters Derek's office.
isa sits behind the desk in Derek's chair and look at a
framed picture on Derek's desk -- Derek, Beth and Kyle, the
perfect happy family.
Nearby, Lisa sees a pile of CD's.
She looks through them and
smiles with an idea.
CUT TO:
Swept by headlights as Derek pulls into the drive.
Derek is at his desk working. It's the end of the day and
workers are leaving. Patrick appears at the door.
PATRICK
Okay if I take off?
DEREK
Yeah, go home.
PATRICK
See you tomorrow.
Patrick leaves. Through the open door, Derek can see other
workers leaving, getting on the elevator. Lisa is one of
them. She doesn't even look his way.
Derek relaxes, goes back to his work.
CUT TO:
Derek, agitated, has confided in Ben who's both concerned and
a little turned on.
BEN
Why didn't you tell me?
DEREK
There was nothing to tell.
BEN
Nothing to tell? She grabbed your cock?
Flashed her tits in your car? Come on,
man. I thought I was your best friend.
DEREK
You think this is funny?
BEN
I just... jeez. I mean, I kinda got she
was interested but I never figured
she'd...
DEREK
What the hell did I do?
I was nice to
her, that's all.
EN
Sure you didn't lead her on? Just a
little? I mean, a pretty girl... it
would be normal...
DEREK
I didn't do a damn thing.
BEN
Maybe she thinks she can make the jump
from assistant to wife, too?
DEREK
Thanks.
You're a big help.
BEN
Sorry... What are you going to do?
DEREK
Report it to Human Resources...
(CONTINUED)
D

CONTINUED:
BEN
Get her fired?
DEREK
I don't have a choice.
BEN
I'd be very careful if I were you. What
if she makes trouble and says you came on
to her?
D
erek gives Ben a look.
C'mon man...
BEN (CONT'D) (cont'd)
Look... it's not like you don't have a
history of behavior here. When's the last
time you had a female assistant on your
desk? People are going to wonder.
EREK
Then I need to get my side on the record
first.
They look at each other.
BEN
(a beat; making a joke)
Wouldn't it be cheaper to just have her
killed?
Derek frowns at him.
CUT TO:
Christmas morning.
hrough the window we see Derek, Beth and Kyle under the tree
unwrapping presents, having a great time. For Derek, all
troubles are forgotten.
C
UT TO:
Mid-January.
The withered Christmas tree waits at the curb
for pick-up.
Low-lit. Empty. Derek comes out, flips open his cell to
call home. He puts his drink down on a table.
DEREK
Hey, honey. It's me.
INTERCUTTING WITH BETH in Kyle's bedroom, putting him to
sleep.
BETH
How's the male bonding?
DEREK
They're all getting wasted. Any minute
now, Joe's going to suggest the Jacuzzi.
BETH
Well, if your future depends on putting
on a bathing suit and hot tubbing it with
a bunch of drunks... Derek? You there?
Derek freezes. Across the patio, he sees A FIGURE slowly
approaching. It's a woman back-lit, a silhouette. But as
she passes into the light from the bar, she's revealed as
Lisa, transformed into an alluring femme fatale.
D
EREK
I have to go.
BETH
Wait.
Kyle wants to say good night.
DEREK
(TENSE)
They're yelling for me to come back.
BETH
It'll just take a second...
Beth picks up Kyle.

BETH (cont'd)
Say good night to Daddy.
As Lisa comes closer...
DEREK
(DESPERATE)
Beth, I'll call you later.
BETH
I'll be in bed -- Derek?
Derek clicks off and pockets his cell.
On the other end, Beth looks perturbed.
Now Lisa comes face to face with Derek, smiling.
She boldly
picks up his drink and takes a sip.
LISA
I can always tell from the pained look on
your face when you're talking to Beth.
DEREK
(DEMANDING)
How did you know I'd be here?
LISA
I've got my sources.
slight frown)
What's wrong? You don't look happy to
see me.
DEREK
Why did you come here?
LISA
You said you could never be with someone
you work with.
(when he doesn't seem to "get
IT")
That's why I quit. So we could be
together.
Derek looks at her, astounded.
DEREK
(holding down panic)
Lisa, you need to leave.
LISA
(teasing smile)
Or what? You'll make a scene?

LISA(cont'd)
CONTINUED: (2)
Call security? What would Joe and Ben
and the others think? I'll tell you what
they'd think. They'd think we arranged
it. And in a way, we did.
Lisa turns aside. Out of Derek's sight, she slips a capsule
into his drink, then puts it back on the table.
LISA (cont'd)
This hook-up was on the books from the
day we met.
D
EREK
What are you talking about?
LISA
One of us
has to take control and I guess
it's me.
So you go back, say your good
nights to
the boys and I'll be waiting in
my room.
610.
DEREK
I'm not coming to your room.
LISA
Would you rather I came to yours?
DEREK
You're crazy... sick.
You need help.
LISA
I know. I need help.
(moves closer; seductive)
Help me, Derek.
She presses against him.
DEREK
Stay away from me!
Lisa emits a musical little laugh and smooths her dress. She
registers Derek's angry face and clenched fists. She smiles.
LISA
All right, Derek. You play your games...
(turning away)
... and I'll play mine.
Lisa disappears into the darkness, high heels echoing.
Derek feel his cell phone vibrate.
He pulls it out.
DEREK
Beth, I'm sorry --

Beth?
It's Ben. Where the hell are you,
bro?
EREK
I'm right here.
Coming back in.
Agitated, Derek picks up his drink, downs it and re-enters
the bar.
CUT TO:
Dazzling sunlight.
Derek wakes up, startled by a pounding on
the door.
WOMAN'S VOICE
Housekeeping!

D
57.
CONTINUED:
Derek blinks, blinded by the sun. His brain is fogged and
he's disoriented. It takes him a moment to realize where he
is. A hotel room. Naked under the covers. How did he...
WOMAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
Housekeeping!
The door begins to open.
DEREK
(SHOUTING)
Later! Come back later!
WOMAN'S VOICE
Okay.
I come back.
The door closes.
erek glances over at the clock. 10:15. Shit.
He's
overslept and now he's late for the seminar.
Derek starts to get up, looks over and -- his heart stops.
There's Lisa sprawled beside him on her stomach, naked under
the covers. She opens her eyes and gives him a sexy, sleepy
smile, stretching her body like a cat.
LISA
Morning.
Derek goes into panic mode, jumping out of the bed like it's
on fire.
DEREK
You've got to get out of here!
LISA
What are you talking about?
DEREK
Leave!
You've got to go!
Derek grabs Lisa by the arm, drags her out of the bed at the
same time gathering her clothes from the floor and thrusting
them into her arms.
LISA
Derek, come on...
D
EREK
I want you out of here!

CONTINUED: (2)
LISA
Why?
You worried somebody's gonna catch
us?
DEREK
Just get the hell out.
LISA
(HALF-AMUSED)
We woke up a little grumpy this morning,
didn't we?
Lisa barely manages to slip into her dress before Derek opens
the door and pushes her out into the hall.
ISA (cont'd)
Derek, what is wrong with you?
Derek slams the door.
On the other side, we hear Lisa's
musical laugh.
LISA (cont'd)
All right.
Have it your way.
Derek locks the door. Shaking, he goes to the bed, sits on
the edge and buries his throbbing head in his hands.
DEREK
(in hell)
Fuck... fuck... fuck.
CUT TO:
Dawn is breaking as Derek guides the Yukon into the drive.
He steps out, hesitates. The front door of the house opens
to reveal a very tense looking Beth in a robe.
(CONTINUED)
D
66.
CONTINUED:
They look at each other across the distance.
Derek walks to
her.
BETH
(a little cold)
Tell me everything.
From the beginning.
Derek nods.
This is not going to be easy.
CUT TO:
Beth moves through the room, stopping to pick up one of
Kyle's toys. She looks through the sliding glass window and
sees Derek on the deck, holding Kyle in his arms. They're
playing a game. Derek points to objects in the distance and
Kyle identifies them. "Truck... doggie... bird..." and so
on.
A tear in Beth's eye.
She comes closer.
They don't see her.
DEREK
(singing to Kyle)
"Four little ducks went out one day...
over the hill and far away..."
CUT TO:
B
76.
A few days later.
Derek races into the garage, yanks open the driver's door and
gets in. He starts the engine, turns to back out and --
Surprise! There's Kyle is in the backseat, strapped into his
car seat, smiling at his Daddy.
DEREK
Kyle...
Derek gets out, pulls open the back door and unstraps his
son, then hesitates. What Derek sees makes his blood run
cold. On the child's forehead... a perfect red lipstick
kiss.
CUT TO:
The SUV pulls up and parks. Derek and Beth get out. Derek
removes the sleeping Kyle from his car seat and carries him
to the front door where Beth waits.
Derek and Kyle watch Baby Einstein on TV.
In the b.g., A SECURITY MAN installs a new alarm system.
Beth is on the phone, talking to someone.
Derek keeps an eye
on her.
BETH
(into phone)
Right. Thank you.
Beth clicks off, starts dialing a new number.
DEREK
Who are you calling?
BETH
Guess.
DEREK
You're not...
(CONTINUED)
B

CONTINUED:
BETH
(DETERMINED)
I got her home number from Patrick.
DEREK
She won't be there.
BETH
She can still pick up her messages.
DEREK
Beth, why are you doing this?
ETH
I want her to know who she's dealing with
now.
On the other end, Lisa's cheerful voice:
LISA'S VOICE
Hi, this is Lisa. I'm not here right now
so please leave a message after the beep
and I'll get back to you. Have a good
one.
BETH
(into the phone)
L
isten to me, you little bitch. This is
Beth Charles and I just want you to know
that if you ever... ever... come near my
child or my house again... I'll kill you.
Beth clicks off, gives Derek a defiant look.
Derek doesn't
know what to say.
The Security Man appears.
SECURITY MAN
You're all set, folks. You want me to
show you how the system works?
BETH
Definitely.
CUT TO:
Derek is leaving for work.
He points to the security pad.
DEREK
Make sure you set this.
BETH
You don't have to tell me.
DEREK
It can't go on much longer. They're
bound to pick her up soon.
(
THEN)
Look, if you want me to stay, I'll call
in...
BETH
No. Go to work. If anything happens,
the security patrol can be here in two
minutes.
(off his look)
Go. I can take care of myself.
Derek opens the door and exits.
Beth closes it behind him,
then touches the keypad.
SECURITY VOICE
SET.
Beth watches from the window as Derek drives off to work.
Kyle is nearby playing. The phone rings. Beth goes over and
picks it up, a little wary.
BETH
Hello? Oh hi, Dad.
(THEN)
What's wrong?
(CONTINUED)
88.
CONTINUED:
As she listens with mounting concern, we...
CUT TO:
Lisa approaches the back of the house, carrying a paper bag.
She steps up on the deck and goes to the kitchen door. She
doesn't even check to see if it's locked. She takes the bag
which contains a bottle of champagne and uses the bottle to
break a pane in the kitchen door window. Then she reaches
inside and unlocks the door.
Beth pulls into the drive.
Outside, a car pulls up and Monica Reyes jumps out. Reyes
hurries up the walk and meets Beth standing in the open door.
REYES
Beth?
Is everything alright here?
BETH
(very calm)
I'm fine. Lisa had an accident.
(moving past Reyes)
I have to go. My mother needs me.
Reyes looks into the house and sees Lisa's body, then turns
back as Beth goes to her car and opens the driver's door.
EYES
Beth, I need to speak with you.
Beth turns back to Reyes.
BETH
Call me on my cell.

What happened here?

Now my child has been waiting too long.
I am sure my husband will be home soon...
Beth and Reyes lock eyes. Reyes nods her understanding. Beth
nods back, gets in the car, starts the engine and backs out
of the drive. Reyes watches her exit.
NT. DEREK'S SUV
In traffic.
He dials his cell.
INTERCUTTING BETH IN HER CAR
She picks up her ringing cell phone, looks at the caller ID
and glances at Kyle in the rearview mirror.
BETH
(tears start to well)
It's Daddy...
DEREK
(FRANTIC)
Beth, I spoke to Reyes.
Are you okay?
BETH
It's over, Derek--
DEREK
Beth...
(a pause)
Tell me baby-- are you hurt?
BETH
I should have believed you...
DEREK
It's gonna be okay, honey.
We're gonna
be okay--
BETH
(long beat)
I love you, Derek.
DEREK
And I love you--
Derek continues on against the traffic. The dashboard
picture of Beth and Kyle still smiling back at him.
