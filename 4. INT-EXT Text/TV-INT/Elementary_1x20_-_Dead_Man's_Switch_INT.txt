  JOAN is making her way down the stairs when she HEARS a steady 
  BUZZING from another room.  She rounds the corner, heads for --


  We re looking at one of Sherlock s wrists THROUGH HIS MAGNIFYING 
  LENS.  An ELECTRIC TATTOO NEEDLE -- the source of the buzzing -- 
  is tracing the edges of a particular tattoo with BLACK INK.  

  ANOTHER ANGLE as Joan ENTERS to find SHERLOCK handling the 
  needle at his desk. 

                                  SHERLOCK
                          (without looking up)
                    Close your mouth, Watson, you ll 
                    catch a fly. 

                                  JOAN
                          (re: the needle)
                    I didn t realize you had one of 
                    those.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Only needle these arms see anymore.  
                    I keep it for the occasional touch-
                    up. 

                                  JOAN
                    Wouldn t it be easier to let 
                    someone else do it?  Like, you 
                    know, an actual tattoo artist?  

  Sherlock finally TURNS OFF the needle.  

                                  SHERLOCK
                    I am an actual tattoo artist.  
                          (holds out his arms)
                    Did virtually all of these myself.

                    perhaps, in honor of your previous 
                    career as a sober companion?

                                  JOAN
                    I m good, thanks.  I only came down 
                    here because I was looking at my 
                    calendar and I realized you re 
                    coming up on your anniversary...

  Sherlock looks at her.   Anniversary? 

                                  JOAN (CONT D)
                    You ll be one year sober in a few 
                    days.  You ll get your one-year 
                    chip at your next meeting. 

  Sherlock doesn t want to talk about it.  Turns the needle ON 
  again and resumes his work. 

                                  JOAN (CONT D)
                    I m embarrassed I didn t realize 
                    sooner.  But you have been keeping 
                    me pretty busy with homework...
                          (off his silence)
                    It s a big deal, Sherlock.  You 
                    should be proud --

                                  SHERLOCK
                    You ve been talking to Alfredo.

                                  JOAN
                    What?  

                                  SHERLOCK
                    He s been hounding me about my 
                       soberversary  for weeks now.  

                                  JOAN
                    Of course he has.  He s your 
                      sponsor...

  Sherlock turns the needle OFF again.  Sets it down.  Stands.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    That s why I haven t had the heart 
                    to tell him yet: I have no 
                    intention of accepting that chip. 

  He EXITS and Joan follows him to --

                                  SHERLOCK
                    It s absurd to measure sobriety in 
                    units of time.  It s a state of 
                    being.  One is either in it or out 
                    of it.  In my case, I am in it.  
                      Permanently.  Amassing a collection 
                    of cheap plastic discs as I go 
                    seems infantile.

                    Unless, of course, I can trade them 
                    in for prizes.  A brood of Sea 
                    Monkeys, perhaps?  My own 
                      hovercraft...?

                    I repeat: You are an ex-sober 
                      companion.  It s no longer your 
                    calling to police, nag me, or 
                    reproach me.  If I desire your 
                    opinions with respect to my 
                    sobriety, I ll ask them. 

  A beat, and then Joan does the strangest thing.  She backs off.

                                  JOAN
                    You re right.  I m sorry. 

  This catches Sherlock by surprise.  But before he can respond, 
  his phone RINGS on the table.  And as he checks the ID, answers:

                                  SHERLOCK

                    but I m with a friend.  I think he

  Sherlock nods his thanks.  WATCHES as Eva moves back to her 
  cello.  And as she resumes playing, and Holmes and Watson EXIT --

                                                                            CUT TO:

                    or even raise her voice above a 
                    certain level.  They suggest a 
                    physical trauma in her past, most

                          (trails off; then)
                    The next morning she told me and 
                    her mom everything.  We took her to 
                    the police and they found Garvey.  
                    She picked him out of a lineup.

                      Milverton.   

  Joan watches as MILVERTON makes his way down the sidewalk. 

                                  JOAN
                    He certainly looks the part.
                          (then)
                    I m just a little surprised how 
                    easy it was to find him...

                                  SHERLOCK
                    I can only assume he s quite 
                    confident in the protection his 
                       failsafe  affords him.   Harm or 
                    molest me in any way, my associate 
                    will expose your secrets in my 
                    stead.   That s why I ll leave his 
                    home exactly as I find it this 
                    evening.

                              LOCK-PICKING TOOLS)
                    I ll assess the threat he poses and 
                    attempt to divine the identity of 
                    his accomplice.  Once both 
                      individuals are known to us, we ll 
                    destroy their blackmail troves 
                      simultaneously.  

  They WATCH as Milverton ROUNDS A CORNER and DISAPPEARS.  And as 
  Sherlock tucks a BLUETOOTH DEVICE into his ear...

                                  JOAN
                      Obviously, he s in bed with Brett 
                    Garvey, right?  How else would he 
                    have gotten his hands on that 
                    video?

  And as he EXITS the car --


  The interior of Milverton s home is as ramshackle as the 
  exterior.  It s also sparsely furnished, so there aren t many 
  shelves or drawers to search.  And as TWO CATS skitter past 
  Holmes  feet...

                    Another reason to dislike 
                      Milverton: He keeps cats.

                    Do you see anything? 

  He does.  And as he heads for a small desk in MILVERTON S 
  BEDROOM --

                    burn the DVD he sent Alfredo s 
                    sponsor.  

  Sherlock SITS and turns the computer ON.  A beat as he OPENS 
  various FILES, paying particular attention to VIDEOS.  He scans 
  a list and then opens several simultaneously.  And as THREE 
  SMALL WINDOWS open, each one showing footage of a camera aimed 
  squarely at a BED...

  ...ANGLE SHERLOCK S FACE.  He SIGHS HEAVILY at what he sees, 
  looks away. 

                                  JOAN
                    What is it?

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Darren Whitman said that the man 
                    who assaulted his daughter took two 
                    other teenaged victims, Tracy 
                    Bender and Claudia Pistone.  There 
                    are videos of them here as well.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    The videos would not appear to be 
                    his only blackmail materials.  I 
                    see files here totally unrelated to 
                    the crimes committed by Mr. Garvey.  
                    Emails exchanged between lovers, 
                      compromising photographs...
                          (then)
                    Mr. Milverton, it seems, is a 
                      professional blackmailer.  I d 
                    estimate his victims number in the 
                    dozens.  

  Before Joan can respond to that, she SEES that Milverton is 
    returning.  He carries a BROWN PAPER BAG; it would appear he 
  made a quick trip to a nearby bodega or liquor store. 

                                  JOAN
                    He s back.  Milverton.  I think he 
                    was just picking up some groceries.  
                    He s heading for the door.

  We END INTERCUT and stay with Sherlock in --


  He quickly but carefully shuts Milverton s computer down and 
  EXITS the room.  Makes his way into --


  He heads for the BACK DOOR, then STOPS when he SEES the 
    silhouette of a MAN through the GAUZY CURTAIN that covers the 
  door s window.  The knob RATTLES and Sherlock immediately TURNS 
  and goes back the way he came.  He WHISPERS, unhappy --

                    He s coming in through the back.  I 
                    nearly collided with him.

                    I m looking at him right now.  He s 
                    coming in through the front. 


  Holmes STOPS SHORT as he realizes she s right.  The front door 
  is OPENING.  Behind him, in the kitchen, he HEARS a glass break.  
  There s no time to figure out what s happening, he can only HANG 
  UP ON JOAN and duck back into --


  He hides behind the door.  WATCHES through a crack as --

    SHERLOCK S POV: Milverton sets his bag down on a table.  Pulls 
  out a SIX-PACK and heads straight for the bedroom.

  Sherlock is a STATUE.  WATCHES as the blackmailer ENTERS and 
  fires up his laptop, the GLOW from its screen giving us our 
  first good look at him.  And as we take particular note of the 
  UGLY SCARRING around his RIGHT TEMPLE... we HEAR a floorboard 
  CREAK.  

  Milverton s head WHIPS AROUND in the direction of the door.  He 
  goes PALE at something he SEES in the hallway --

                    Please --

  But he s cut off by TWO SHOTS from a REVOLVER.  

  Sherlock, jolted, can only WATCH as Milverton falls from his 
  chair, his head LOLLING in Holmes  direction.  He makes EYE 
  CONTACT with Sherlock, starts to say something -- 

  -- but then a THIRD SHOT TO THE CHEST finishes him. 

  The SHOOTER enters from the hall.  He s beefy, taller than six 
  feet.  His face is MASKED, his hands are GLOVED.  He throws 
  Milverton s corpse over his shoulder with ease.  Closes the 
    blackmailer s laptop and tucks it under one arm.  And as he 
  EXITS --

  -- Sherlock can only stand there.  And we...

                    The man in that video is Brett 
                    Garvey.  He was arrested in New 
                    Jersey several years ago and 
                    convicted of sexually assaulting 
                    three young women: Eva Whitman,

                    Eva Whitman s father received that 
                    video in the mail.  It was 
                      accompanied by a note that demanded 
                    he pay $10,000 or see it released

                      I identified the blackmailer 
                    earlier this evening.  I went to

                    The hypothetical dead man had a

                    It would make a certain amount of 
                    sense.  It would give a motivated

                    day.  Maybe two.

  Gregson mulls this a beat.

                      Obviously, you wanna find the 
                      accomplice more than you do the 
                    killer.  But what if the killer is 
                    the accomplice? 

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Then all roads lead to Mecca.  A 
                      blackmailer is foiled and a killer 
                    caught, all in one fell swoop.  

  Gregson seems uncertain.  And so, when Sherlock sees his eyes 
  drift back down to the DVD...

                      Hypothetically... a  motivated 
                      investigator  would have until the 
                    body or crime scene was found.  
                      Hypothetically.  If or when that 
                      happens... I d strongly recommend 
                    that anyone who knows anything 
                    about what happened reach out to 
                    the Department and tell them 
                      everything he knows. 

  Sherlock nods.  And as the Captain stands and EXITS...

  Joan is sitting on the floor, listening to a SCANNER as she 
  reviews various PAPERS removed from Milverton s home.  She looks 
  up when she HEARS the front door open.  And as Sherlock ENTERS --

                    So?

                                  SHERLOCK
                    The Captain sees the wisdom in 
                    keeping Milverton s death a secret 
                    for now.  But the clock is ticking.  
                    We only have until the fact of the 
                    crime is revealed.

                                  JOAN
                    I ve been listening to the scanner 
                    since I got back.  No reports of 
                    gunfire or a break-in in 
                      Milverton s neighborhood.

                      Milverton s place for as long as we

  She hands him a WEATHERED BLACK BOOK.  Sherlock OPENS it to 
  reveal that most pages are broken into COLUMNS.  The columns are 
  filled with DATES and AMOUNTS.

                    I think it s some kind of ledger.

                    Records of payoffs from his 
                    victims, no doubt.  I would ve 
                    preferred his laptop, but that s in 
                    the hands of his killer now...

  Joan watches him as he flips through the ledger.

                    Are you doing okay?

                    You saw somebody get murdered 
                    tonight. 

  He just looks at her.  Your point?  And so Joan moves on...

                    You said you never got a clean look

                    Large man, approximately six-foot-
                    two.  One hundred kilograms.  His 
                    features were obscured by a mask, 
                    his scent by the cat urine and 
                    kitty litter in Milverton s home.  
                    Even if I had reported the crime, I 
                    wouldn t have had much to offer. 

                                  JOAN
                    And you don t think there s any 
                    chance it was just a break-in gone 
                    really, really wrong... 

                                  SHERLOCK
                          (no)
                    It was an assassination.  The *
                    killer shot Milverton, then stole 
                    his laptop and his corpse.  Hard *
                    not to imagine the killer was one 
                    of the people Milverton was 
                      blackmailing, but the Captain 
                    raised the possibility it was his 
                      accomplice.  Either way, our goal 
                    is the same: Find the failsafe

                    Say the killer was one of 
                      Milverton s victims.  Why wasn t he 
                    worried about the failsafe kicking 
                    in? 

                                  SHERLOCK
                    It s possible he solved the problem 
                    Milverton was taking advantage of.  
                    The failsafe would have meant 
                    nothing to him.
                          (then)
                      Unfortunately, it still means a 
                    great deal to Milverton s other 
                    victims.  The parents of the three 
                    young women raped by Brett Garvey, 
                    for example.  

  That hangs there.  And as Sherlock returns to the papers...

                    I ve arranged to pay him a visit in

                                  JOAN
                    Garvey?

                                  SHERLOCK
                    You suggested earlier that he and 
                    Milverton were working together.  A 
                    sound deduction given Milverton had 
                    Garvey s tapes.  But I ll do you 
                    one better: What if Garvey is the 
                      accomplice Milverton entrusted with 
                    his failsafe protocols?

                                  JOAN
                    He s in prison.  How could he --

                                  SHERLOCK
                    All he would need to unleash the 
                    videos is access to a smart phone 
                    or a computer.  Neither, I m sorry 
                    to say, is impossible to come by in 
                    lockup. 
                          (as he steps past her)
                    If he isn t the accomplice... then 
                    perhaps he can tell us who is.

                    Before you tell us you ve never

                    fresh from a conversation with your

                                  JOAN
                    Is that why you gave him your 
                      collection of rape tapes?  Because 
                    he and your dad were so close?

                    He told me all about him when he

                    told the police he was blackmailing 
                    me, his partner would release the

                    kept them in a storage unit.  After 
                    I got arrested, I couldn t keep up 
                    the payments.  The contents went up 
                    for auction and Milverton put in

                                        ACT TWO

  FADE IN:


  Sherlock sits at the table, reviewing stacks of financial 
    statements and e-mail printouts as Joan ENTERS, eating half a 
  grilled cheese sandwich and carrying the other half on a plate.

                                  JOAN
                    What s the verdict on our dirtbag?

                                  SHERLOCK
                    You ll have to be more specific.  
                    Are you referring to the dead 
                      blackmailer or the incarcerated 
                    sexual predator? 

                                  JOAN
                    Predator.  Was he really just 
                    another of Milverton s targets?  

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Far as rapists go, it would appear 
                    Mr. Garvey is an honest one.  

  Without asking, he takes the half sandwich off Joan s plate and 
  bites into it.  This was not what Joan intended.  But Sherlock 
  has already moved onto explaining his pile of papers --

                                  SHERLOCK (CONT D)
                    After Milverton s initial visit to 
                    him in prison, Garvey sent his 
                    parents a series of emails in which 
                    he begged for loans.  The dates of 
                    those emails correspond to payments 
                    recorded in Milverton s ledger. 
                          (in summary)
                    Milverton was blackmailing Garvey 
                    and Garvey was paying.  

                                  JOAN
                    We are going to tell the police 
                    about the videos before his parole 
                      hearing... right?  

                                  SHERLOCK
                          (without looking up)
                    We will discuss the matter with the  
                    three girls  parents at the 
                      appropriate time.  The decision 
                    will and should be theirs.

                    Until then, we must stay the course 
                    and attempt to identify Milverton s 
                    accessory --

                                  JOAN
                    -- before he figures out Milverton 
                    is dead.  Got it.  And yet?  Crazy 
                    thought.  What if Milverton lied 
                    about having an accomplice? 

  Sherlock looks up at this. 

                                  JOAN (CONT D)
                    I m just asking.  What if he 
                    thought the threat of the failsafe 
                    was enough to keep people from 
                    going to the police? 

  Holmes shakes his head,  no.   

                                  SHERLOCK
                    He would never have been so bold as 
                    to meet Garvey face to face -- and 
                    in a state prison -- without some 
                    sort of backup.  Also: I found 
                    something in his ledger. 

  He reaches for the ledger, OPENS it. 

                                  SHERLOCK (CONT D)
                    He listed regular outgoing payments 
                    to someone with the codename 
                     HENRY8.  

  And as we SEE the curious name in the ledger again and again...

                                  JOAN
                    You think he s the accomplice.  

                                  SHERLOCK
                    The payments are consistently ten 
                    percent of whatever monies 
                    Milverton had coming in.
                          (then)
                    Seems a reasonable rate for a 
                      blackmailer s assistant, no? 

  Before Joan can respond, Sherlock s cell CHIRPS with an incoming 
  text.  And as he dumps the remainder of  his  sandwich on Joan s 
  plate and checks the message --

                                  SHERLOCK (CONT D)
                    It s Alfredo.  He says someone s at 
                      Milverton s door.

  PULL BACK TO REVEAL a room decorated according to the theme the 
  man has chosen for his business.  Western flourishes everywhere, 
  including a BISON HEAD mounted beside several LAW DIPLOMAS and a 
  prominently displayed LASSO.  Sherlock and Joan sit across from 
  HAROLD  DUKE  GLOVER.  He s a bit older than he was when the 
  video was made, but his look is essentially the same.  

                                  DUKE GLOVER (CONT D)
                    Sorry.  Name doesn t ring a bell.

                                  JOAN
                    That s funny, Sheriff.  Because you 
                    were seen knocking on his door in 
                    Staten Island this morning. 

                                  DUKE GLOVER
                    Can you prove that? 

                                  SHERLOCK
                    No.  Nor can we prove that Mr. 
                    Milverton is your client.  That he 
                    left certain materials with you, 
                    told you to disperse them should

  Beat.  They have Duke s full attention now.  But he gives a 
  small smile...

                                  DUKE GLOVER
                    Say you re right.  Say this 
                    Milverton guy is a client.  The law 
                    would proscribe me from discussing 
                    him with you in any way. 
                          (standing)
                    Now, if you ll excuse me...

  Sherlock remains seated a beat.  When he finally stands, he 
  heads for the wall of diplomas and certifications.

                          (off a particular diploma)
                     Duke Glover, Esquire.   I assume 
                    the title refers to your law 
                    license rather than your birthright 
                    as the eldest son of a knight.

  Before Duke can respond, Sherlock takes the diploma down and 
  SMASHES it on the edge of a nearby table, shattering the glass.  

                                  DUKE GLOVER
                    What the hell -- ?

  Sherlock reaches into the frame and pulls out the PAPER.  He 
  massages it, holds it up to the light. 

                                  SHERLOCK
                    As I suspected: This paper is 24 
                    pound stock as opposed to the 80 
                    pound used by most institutions.

                    you ve properly absorbed them, 
                    you ll find the signatures of the

                                  DUKE GLOVER
                    Few years ago, I got him off a DWI 
                    charge.  We got a... sense of one 
                    another.  He said that if any 
                       sensitive information  came across 
                    my desk, he could use it to make 
                    money for both of us.  

                                  SHERLOCK
                      Translation: You gave him 
                      information about your clients in 
                    exchange for a cut of whatever 
                    money he made blackmailing them.  

                                  DUKE GLOVER
                    Just so we re clear -- that s all I 
                    did.

  Joan sets her box down.  Reaches for a PLASTIC CUP at the center 
  of the table, looks inside to find MORE CHIPS.

                    Two years ago, Milverton referred a 
                    client to the Sheriff: Abraham 
                    Zelner, a morbidly obese man who 
                    wanted to sue an airline for 
                    removing him from a flight.  Zelner 
                    was the only client Milverton ever 
                    referred.  

  He turns, picks up Milverton s financial ledger.

                    We theorized earlier that  HENRY8  
                    was Milverton s accomplice.  Henry 
                    the Eighth, as I m sure you re 
                    aware, was the fattest monarch in 
                    British history.

                    You think Zelner is the accomplice 
                    and that Milverton gave him that 
                    codename because he was heavyset.  ELEMENTARY - EP. 119 - "DEAD MAN'S SWITCH" - WHITE PROD. DRAFT - 3/04/13     30.

                    Orson Welles was  heavyset.   
                    Abraham Zelner could pull small 
                    moons out of orbit.

                    A call came in a little while ago 
                    from a night watchman at a 
                      construction site.  He saw some 
                      suspicious activity, wanted us to 
                    send a car.  The responding 
                    officers found a perp trying to 
                    dump a corpse into some wet cement 
                    in the building s foundation...
                          (crux of the matter)
                    Victim was shot three times in the 
                    chest, perp claims he did it 
                    because the guy was blackmailing 
                    him.  Some hypothetical bells

                    Abraham Zelner existed, Watson, at

                          (explains)
                    It was an assumed identity used for 
                    the express purpose of an obesity 
                      discrimination lawsuit.  When the 
                    airline  Zelner  sued made its 
                    first low-ball offer of settlement, 
                    he accepted, probably because he 
                    knew his false identity wouldn t 
                    stand up to scrutiny.  This got me 
                    to thinking: What if he d done it

                    seats.  He received a fifty-
                    thousand dollar settlement.

  Sherlock shows this picture to Joan.  She compares it to the 
  first photo Sherlock handed her.

                                  JOAN
                    It s the same man.
                          (thinking, then)
                    But Gary Bloom... that name doesn t 
                    fit the pattern.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    No, it does not.  Because this, I 
                    believe, was his first lawsuit. 

                                  JOAN
                    He used his real name.

                    Abraham Zelner may not have a DMV 
                    record... but Gary Bloom most 
                    assuredly does.

  and we...

  We re in the LIVING ROOM of Bloom s modest home.  The KNOCKING 
  pauses; we HEAR Sherlock call from outside:

                                  SHERLOCK (O.S.)
                    Hello?

                    Mr. Bloom?

  -- Sherlock and Joan.  As they step cautiously into the house, 
  Joan struggles to see in the darkness.  

                                  JOAN
                    It s so dark.  Where s the light 
                    switch?  

  Spotting it, Sherlock moves to turn on a light.  As he crosses, 
  his every step makes a CRUNCHING SOUND.  Odd.

  Sherlock flips on the light, then looks down at the floor.

  ANGLE ON THE FLOOR -- it s covered with GRAINS of CAT LITTER.  
  Sherlock drops INTO FRAME to examine it.

                                  JOAN (CONT D)
                    What is it?

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Cat litter.

                                  JOAN
                    It s everywhere.
                          (then)
                    Guy must have a lot of cats...

  Sherlock is already headed down the hall.  His tone is slightly 
  grim as he responds.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    I don t think this litter was put 
                    out for cats.  I think it was put 
                    out to absorb odors.

  And as he pushes open the door to a BATHROOM, stops dead in his 
  tracks --

                    Very strong odors.

    ...REVEALS that the TUB in the bathroom (barely) contains GARY 
  BLOOM S DEAD, DECAYING BODY.  He s SLUMPED DOWN, his face just 
  barely cresting the milky water.

  FADE IN:


  We re CLOSE on Gary Bloom s mottled corpse.  The water has been 
  DRAINED from his tub, allowing us a better look at his chest and 
  arms.

                    Captain Gregson, meet Gary Bloom... 

  And as a CAMERA FLASH washes over the body...

    ...ANOTHER ANGLE finds Sherlock standing with Gregson near the 
  sink.  A CRIME SCENE PHOTOGRAPHER snaps pictures beside them.

                    Note the bruise pattern on his 
                    chest.   

                                    GREGSON
                    Is that a bootprint? 


  FROM ABOVE: Gary Bloom THRASHES in his bathwater, a BOOTED FOOT 
  pressing down hard on his chest.

                      Obviously, the killer caught him 
                    unawares and then drove his head 
                    beneath the water.


                                    GREGSON
                    He drowned.

                    The body was too immense to remove.  
                    And so, rather than dismember him, 
                    Mr. Milverton left behind a 
                    decade s supply of cat litter to 
                    cover the stench of his 
                      decomposition. ELEMENTARY - EP. 119 - "DEAD MAN'S SWITCH" - WHITE PROD. DRAFT - 3/04/13     45.

  He EXITS.  And as Gregson follows --


  Bloom continues to THRASH beneath the water... only this time, 
  we SEE Charles Milverton is the one holding him down.

                                  SHERLOCK (V.O.)
                    Milverton was a size seven.  Mr. 
                    Pistone, a twelve.  


  Charles Milverton plunges his hand repeatedly into a LARGE BAG 
  OF KITTY LITTER, scattering FISTFULS of the stuff on the floor 
  as he backs towards the front door.  

                                  SHERLOCK (V.O.)
                      I remember the scent quite vividly 
                    from his house. 


  Sherlock sits and stares at a CRACKLING FIRE, his hands folded.  
  On the floor beside him: The two FILE BOXES from Duke Glover. 

                                  JOAN (O.C.)
                    Well this is a surprise. 

  He TURNS to find Joan making her way into the room.  And as she 
  indicates the two boxes...

                    There is an abundance of evidence 
                    that indicates Gary Bloom was

  To his surprise, Joan picks up one of the file boxes.  She 
  explains --

                    I m gonna take one last look before 
                    I turn in. 

  Sherlock is quietly impressed, but says nothing.  Turns back to 
  the fire.  But no sooner has Joan headed for the stairs than --

                                  SHERLOCK
                    It s curious.

                    You made that pretty clear the 
                    other night. 

  A beat as Holmes considers that, his eyes still locked on the 
  fire.  And finally --

                                  SHERLOCK
                    You were right about the sobriety

                    And the reason you wouldn t just do 
                    it like a normal person is...

  Sherlock doesn t answer.  Joan SEES for the first time that his 
  eyes have grown moist.

                    to one side.  

  Sherlock takes the tablet from her.  Studies a BLOWN-UP IMAGE of 
  Milverton s face.  And when he SEES that the damage is almost 
  exclusively to his RIGHT TEMPLE... 


  Milverton ENTERS and fires up his laptop.  The GLOW from its 
  screen illuminates his face... and as we SEE the UGLY SCARRING 
  around his right temple...

                    right here.  Very distinctive...
                          (beat; still studying the 
                            photograph)
                    It s almost as though Pistone 
                    targeted them...

                                  JOAN
                    I don t understand.  Why would 
                    Pistone want to destroy Milverton s 
                    scars?

                    see you again, I was so pleased to 
                    hear you made bail.

                          (what s with this guy?)
                    Thanks.  My attorney said you had 
                    some more questions for me...

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Remind us: When did you first 
                    identify Charles Milverton as your 
                      blackmailer?

                                    PISTONE
                    A few nights ago.  Just like I told 
                    you. 

                                    GREGSON
                    We now have reason to believe that 
                    you and Mr. Milverton actually 
                    crossed paths a few months ago. 

                                  ATTORNEY
                    What?

                                  JOAN
                    Charles Milverton was savagely 
                    beaten around the same time.  He 
                    had to go to an E.R.

  She passes the attorney an assortment of PHOTOGRAPHS that 
  feature a bloodied (but very much alive) Charles Milverton.

                                  JOAN (CONT D)
                    He said he was mugged, which is why 
                    the responding detectives took 
                    pictures. 
                          (then)
                    Thing is... we think he was lying.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    He gave varying descriptions of his 
                    mugger to the police.  The doctor 
                    who treated him chalked it up to a 
                      concussion... but we think it was 
                    something else.  We think he 
                    couldn t tell him the real story...

                    ...which was that you found him and

                    No.  I wanna hear this.  I wanna 
                    hear about how I muscled in on the

                      daughter s rape to extort money 
                    from me.  

  Sherlock indicates a particular photograph of the battered 
  Charles Milverton.  

                                  SHERLOCK
                    See these gashes right here?  The 
                    ones around his right temple?  The 
                    wounds bear a rather striking 
                      resemblance to the emblem on your 
                    ring, wouldn t you agree? 


  Pistone fiddles with his thick signet ring as he talks to  
  Gregson.*


                                  SHERLOCK
                    Mr. Milverton was left with scars 
                    in roughly the same pattern.  You 
                    knew this.  And so, when the police 
                    closed in on you two nights ago, 
                    you trampled his face in an attempt 
                    to obscure them. 

                                    PISTONE
                    So Milverton took a beating from a 
                    guy with a ring like mine. 
                          (re: his ring)
                    You wanna guess how many of these 
                    are out there? 

  Sherlock ignores the question.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    As I was saying: You found 
                    Milverton months ago.  You intended *
                    to punish him for blackmailing you, *
                    but then he surprised you.  Offered *
                    you a piece of the operation in *
                    exchange for his life.  Your *
                      contracting business was, well, 
                      contracting.  You needed the money.  *
                    And so you took him up on his *
                    offer. *

                                  JOAN
                    Charles suddenly found himself with 
                    two partners.  His failsafe, Gary 
                    Bloom, and you.  Someone had to go.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Milverton murdered Bloom.  Maybe 
                    you put him up to it, maybe he did 
                    it of his own volition.  Either way 
                    -- I suspect a 50/50 split wasn t 
                    enough for you.  And so once you 
                    had a sense of how Milverton 
                    operated, you staged the most 
                    hostile of takeovers.

                    were guilty of crimes more sinister

                    deposited them in your business 
                    account and then you wrote yourself 
                    a check for the corresponding 
                    amount.  Pretty basic money-
