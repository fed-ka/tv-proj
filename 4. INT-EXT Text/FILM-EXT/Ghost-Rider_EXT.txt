A COYOTE lopes through shimmering heat waves. The sky above
is a cloudless blue.
WOMAN (V.O.)
My Father used to say that the only way
Evil came into your life was if you
invited it. I'm not sure about that, at
least not anymore. What I cLQ know is
this: we are born alone, and we die
alone, and what happens in between is all
that matters. The choices we make, the
people whose paths we cross -- these are
the things that determine our fate.
The coyote ducks through a hole in a chain-link fence, weaves
through the rusted ruins of a --
DERELICT AMUSEMENT PARK
Broken-down rides, weed-clogged machinery, sideshow trailers
bleached bone-white.
WOMAN (V.0.) (CONT'D)
Most stories start with a beginning. His
began with an ending. I never knew where
he really came from. I guess it's not
important anymore. All I know is that
he'd been running his entire life.
Running for so long that he no longer
knew whether he was running away from
SOMETHING --
The coyote reaches a steep ridge, looks out over a patchy
Southwestern town.
WOMAN (V.0.) (CONT'D)
-- or towards it.
SMASH CUT TO:
Blaze skids out of the yard, matching speed with a pickup
which is just passing by. COOP is driving. JED and MURPHY
are LAUGHING in back. Clearly, they're friends with Blaze.
JED
(SHOUTING)
Skin of your teeth, man!
MURPHY
(tapping his watch)
Yeah, we're on a tight schedule!
BLAZE
So what are you waiting for?
Blaze burns away, leaving the pickup for dust.
CUT TO:

A FREIGHT TRAIN thunders across the landscape. To the East
Blaze and the pickup are coming on an intercept course.
Blaze reaches the train first, climbs the gravel incline to
the tracks. Matches its speed, pulls up alongside a bolted
container car. He reaches back, pulls the cutters from his
saddles bags --
-- and skillfully chops the lock with one hand. The heavy
iron door slides open, pulled back by it's own inertia.
Blaze throws the cutters inside, peels away --
-- and comes back with a vengeance, throttled to the max. He
jams the front brake on at the last possible moment --
The bike cartwheels. Tail over head. Pulls a complete three-
sixty up into the car --
INSIDE THE CAR
-- and lands perfectly, screeching to a halt. Blaze WHOOPS
his exhilaration. And if you don't believe this, watch
extreme motocross as we CUT TO:
THE OPPOSITE DOOR
being wrenched aside, revealing Coop's pickup holding steady
alongside the train. Jed and Murphy ride the cargo bed like
surfers.
Blaze starts tossing boxes out of the car and into the truck.
Jed and Murphy stack `em and rack `em. We get glimpses of
the loot: CD Players, VCRs, personal packages, luggage --
JED
Christ, Mickey was right on the money!
BLAZE
Car twenty-two!
MURPHY
(LAUGHING)
Candy from a baby!
The boxes keep coming, like baggage at the airport. Some
boxes miss the mark, fall short, get mangled. A box bursts
against Murphy's chest, engulfs him in an explosion of paper
and polystyrene beads. The others howl with LAUGHTER, riding
high on this Great Train Robbery as -

CONTINUED:
-- Blaze hears something, looks over his shoulder. He SEES a
POLICE CRUISER, far in the distance, burning towards them.
BLAZE
Thank you gentlemen, that's it for today!
Jed bangs on the cab roof. Coop waves. Jed and Murphy
salute. The pickup peels away. Blaze retrieves his bike.
Stands it back up, kicks it alive, guns the throttle and --
-- cold jumps straight out of the car. Seconds later he's
powering away, ripping up a storm, chasing the pickup towards
the horizon.
Far, far behind, the police are still coming.
CUT TO:
Blaze and Roxanne creep through a hole in the outer fence,
making their way to --
BLAZE
Keep going. It's just up there.
A BROKEN-DOWN CAROUSEL
Must have been magnificent in its day.

horses.

BLAZE
You don't have to ride, just climb up.
She steps up onto the wooden platform, smiles back at him.
ROXANNE
You're going to have to grow up one day,
Johnny Blaze.
BLAZE
Not if I can help it.
He follows her up onto the ride. She weaves through the
wooden animals. Starting to enjoy this secret adventure.
BLAZE (CONT'D)
Keep going, keep going --
She comes around the other side, catches her breath. The
whole valley is spread out before her -- a glorious scatter
of diamonds on velvet.
BLAZE (CONT'D)
Uh-oh.
ROXANNE
(TURNING BACK)
What?
BLAZE
Ever hear of a carnival wedding?
Roxanne shakes her head. Blaze is fiddling with a crisp, new
dollar bill, folding it, making something.
BLAZE (CONT' D)
If a man and a woman walk around a
carousel going backwards, they're
considered hitched.
ROXANNE
You made that up.
BLAZE
Swear to God.
He finishes folding the bill. The "one" is now neatly set on
top of an ORIGAMI WEDDING BAND like a paper jewel.
BLAZE (CONT' D)
You want this?

She nods, offering her hand. He slips the ring onto her
finger and she examines it, lit up inside.
ROXANNE
It's beautiful.
He smiles at her joy, wrestles with what he's about to say.
BLAZE
How'd I ever find you?
ROXANNE
(SHRUGGING)
Fate?
BLAZE
I don't believe in fate.
ROXANNE
Maybe it believes in you.
They hug each other fiercely. A long, soulful embrace.
Blaze looks to the city lights beneath them once more.
ROXANNE (CONT ' D)
Here's the thing, John. We're having a
baby. You can't keep acting like
everything's a game. I need you with me.
I need to know I'll be able to wake up in
the morning and see your face next to
mine. Not have to worry that you spent
the night in jail.
(BEAT)
That's not a life. At least not one I'm
interested in living.
BLAZE
I know. I'm gonna get my shit together.
For Leal, this time,

I promise you, Rox. I'll always be there

the suitcase into a beat-up El Camino.
-- nearly clipping another car pulling in. He jumps the curb
and races off into the rain --
The EL Camino screams through the rain, with the cop car in
dogged pursuit. TWO MORE POLICE CARS fall in behind them.
Blaze scrambles out through the broken windshield. Falls off
the wreck onto the steep, muddy incline. He tries to stand,
can barely manage to crawl.
BLAZE
(terror seizing him)
ROXANNE!!!

lying ten yards away, unconscious, maybe dead. Blaze
scrambles to her, rolls her over. He hauls her into his
arms, SOBBING, the two of them covered in mud and glass and
God knows what.
TROOPERS
are coming down the incline, guns drawn, FLASHLIGHTS beaming.
They descend on Blaze, crying to pull him free of Roxanne.
BLAZE (O.S. ) (CONT'D)
Let me see her! God-Dammit! I have a
right to see her --
CUT TO:
It's pouring rain. Nomi and Rain hurry across the muddy lot
towards a ratty pickup.
CARRIGAN (O.S.)
Yeah, I found her. Came back to be with
her dying grandpappy.

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LOT
BILLY-RAY CARRIGAN (30s) paces under an tire bay awning,
talking on a cell-phone. He's handsome, charming, but
there's evil lurking within that slick exterior. A pencil-
thin scar runs just under one eye.
CARRIGAN (CONT'D)
Don't worry. She's got the kid with her.
Carrigan watches Nomi and Rain climb into the pickup. The
pickup chokes to life, carves out of the lot. Carrigan nods
TO --
-- LANDSDALE ( 40s), a stone-faced criminal, who motions to
five other thugs lounging nearby -- FUSCO, ALBRIGHT,
CHUDACOFF, LLOYD and ODELL.
CARRIGAN (CONT'D)
(listening, impatient)
I remember the deal. Just make sure you
bring the money.
He hangs up, follows his men to a couple of trucks waiting
nearby -- a dusty Tundra for Albright, Chudacoff, Odell and
Lloyd; an old Bronco for Landsdale, Fusco and Carrigan.
Carrigan pulls a Glock from his waistband, chambers a round.
CARRIGAN (CONT'D)
Who wants to be a millionaire?
Landsdale smiles back, an awful smile.
WOMAN (V.O.)
Some people are born bad. That's just
the way they come into the world.
Something goes wrong. Something breaks
inside of them --
The trucks pull away, tires ploughing muddy tracks, passing
two STRAY DOGS fighting over a bloody road-kill carcass.
A lonesome service road threads through bleak wild-grass
prairie. Nomi's pickup appears on the horizon.
CRASH! The Tundra rams Nomi's pickup again. Nomi fights to
keep control. Aims for a turn-off up ahead. She hauls the
truck into the turn, fights the roll-over, barely makes it --
-- but it's not fast enough. The Tundra and the Bronco make
the turn too. Their HEADLIGHTS blaze into the cab. Nomi
floors the gas. The pickup judders. The road here is
bumpier, cracked and pocked.
The Bronco swings out, pulls up alongside Nomi. She glimpses
Landsdale, LAUGHING, urging Carrigan on. Carrigan cuts
right, SLAMS the Bronco into Nomi's side.
Nomi approaches the trucks, blinded by halogen high-beams.
SILHOUETTES are coming towards her. She raises the revolver --
NOMI
Back the fuck off!
LANDSDALE comes from left of nowhere, twists the gun from her
hands in one unexpected move. She spins, SEES Carrigan
approaching -- and recognizes him instantly.
NOMI (CONY' D)
Billy-Ray --?
CRACK! Nomi falls to her knees, dimly aware of her daughter
SCREAMING. Carrigan stands over her, massaging his fist.
CARRIGAN
Well, if it isn't Little Miss Running
Bear.
He grabs her by her hair, shoves the Glock beneath her chin.
CARRIGAN (CONT'D)
Gentlemen, you are looking at one of the
finest pieces of ass I have ever had the
good fortune of defiling.
NOMI
Fuck you, Billy --
CARRIGAN
Now I might just take you up on that,
Nome. Old Billy-Ray's been getting a
little tired shaking hands with the
governor, know what I'm saying?
IN THE PICKUP CAB
Landsdale and his men are trying to get the doors open. Rain
scoots to the driver's side, tries to start the engine. But
the driver's door is wrenched open and the men are on her -

LANDSDALE
Careful with her!
Rain is dragged kicking and screaming from the cab.
ON NOMI,
struggling to free herself, desperate to help her child.
NOMI
Leave her alone!
Rain fights like a hellion, rakes her fingernails across
Odell's face.
ODELL
Fuck!
SLAP! Landsdale back-hands the little girl. As she reels,
he binds her hands with duct tape, then picks her up and
throws into the Bronco.
NOMI
YOU COCKSUCKERS!
THUNDER explodes. LIGHTNING flashes. The men gather round
to watch Carrigan beat Nomi unmercifully. He knocks her back
into the mud. She tries to crawl away, blinded by the rain.
CRACK! SMACK! Carrigan delivers the coup-de-grace. Pistol
whips Nomi with the Glock. Her head snaps back. Blood sprays
in deep slow-motion, spatters the bronco's headlights --

CONTINUED:
Nomi struggles backwards through rivulets of mud. Carrigan
looms over her. All she can do is stare up at him, glassy
and unfocused as rain spatters her face.
CARRI GAN
Tell you what, Hon. You want your
goddamned divorce so much?
He aims the Glock at her face, about to pull the trigger as --
CARRIGAN (CONT'D)
You can fucking have it!
-- a GUT-WRENCHING HOWL cuts through the night, echoing off
the canyon walls. Carrigan and his cronies take a beat,
staring through sheets of rain.
Silence. Just the relentless downpour.
ODELL
The hell was that?
The men glance at each other, nervous. A THUNDER-QUAKE
rumbles, so low and gritty it'll rattle your fillings.
The men look around, frightened. Rocks fall from the
surrounding butte. Odell looks down. The SOUND is deafening,
vibra tine: the very earth. And that's when it happens:
A FLAMING RED-HOT MONSTER-CYCLE
leaps from atop a wedged outcrop, ridden by SOMETHING that
SCREAMS and BURNS. Silent SLOW MOTION. Heat haze, glowing
manifolds. The bike catches twenty feet of air, trailing
fire like a comet's tail as it passes right over their
disbelieving heads.
What.
The.
Fuck.
Touchdown. A BLAST-WAVE of heat and flame billow outward.
The men shield themselves, stumbling backwards. The bike
hauls a deep carving turn, peeling mud, slides to a dead
stop, hissing in the driving rain.
Time stands still. Carrigan and his men gape. The monster
cycle throbs.

ON THE RIDER
Alive. Evil. Aflame. A man but not a man -- an impossible
spectre, engulfed in fire, its skullish head deeply bowed.
Clinking coils of red-hot chain slip link by link through its
skeletal, flickering fingers. Then it lifts his terrible
HEAD --
THE FACE OF JOHN BLAZE
Skeletal, aflame, but somehow still Johnny, his tortured
visage recognizable even as the furnace blazes blue-white.
His jaw bone pivots open to unleash an INHUMAN HOWL, at once
predatory and tormented, a shriek of eternal damnation.
Time speeds up again. The men run. The Ghost Rider
accelerates from zero to sixty in a heartbeat.
Lloyd runs fast as he can. Talk about pointless. The Ghost
Rider seizes his head, drags him seventy yards, burning him
black, discarding him --
The other men let rip. Guns blaze. BULLETS punch through the
Ghost Rider, coming out his back as red hot slag. The demon
hauls a deep curve, powers up onto his rear wheel --
ALBRIGHT
What the fuck?! WHAT THE FUCK?!
Albright FIRES his shotgun. THUNDERING past like an Amtrak
train, the Ghost Rider PUNCHES a flaming fist right through
Albright'-, face.
That's it for the others. They scramble for the trucks.
WHOOSH! The Ghost Rider lashes out with his chains, lassos
Chudacoff. He SCREAMS as the metal sears his body, falls
heavily, burning --
The Ghost Rider skids to a halt, summons something internal
and lets it loose -- a blast of PURE HELLFIRE that courses
down the chains and engulfs Chudacoff, immolating him.
The men make the trucks, pile in. Landsdale slams the Tundra
into drive. The big truck hauls away.
Carrigan fights to get the Bronco into gear. Rain peeks out
from the back, eyes bugging --

RAIN'S POV
as the Ghost Rider dismounts, stalks through the rain towards
them. He raising his skeletal hand, clenches it, and
suddenly we are --
INSIDE THE BRONCO'S ENGINE
A series of MACRO SHOTS as we move amongst the pistons,
cylinders, and intake manifolds. The mixture of vaporized
fuel and air within the engine begins to ignite, but then the
miniature explosions seem to contract and implode in upon
themselves and we are --
BACK OUTSIDE
with Carrigan. His truck won't start. Somehow, the ?host
Rider has actin uished the flames within his engine.
The Ghost Rider keeps coming, his skeletal claws/fingers
white-hot now, throbbing with heat. He slices through the
Bronco's door like a human oxy-acetylene torch, chopping the
vehicle apart.
Carrigan panics, drags Rain out the passenger door. But
Fusco is still trapped inside. Can't get his seatbelt off.
The Ghost Rider tears open the roof, bisects the vehicle and
HURLS the front away, leaving Fusco cowering in the melted
back seat. The Ghost Rider looms over Fusco, extending a
skeletal claw --
FUSCO
Oh God, please, I ain't nothing to do
with nothin'. I ain't nothin'. Please,
PLEASE!
ON CARRIGAN
tugging Rain away from the horror, trying to ignore Fusco's
terrible SCREAMS. He looks back, wishes he hadn't --
The Ghost Rider has Fusco snatched up nose-to-nose, forcing
the man to look right into --
THE GHOST RIDER'S EYES
Hungry black sockets that suck the fire from the air.
(CONTINUED)
25,
CONTINUED: (4)
FUSCO
shudders, eyes bulging. All he can do is stare into those
awful pits, fall into them, as grisly IMAGES from his evil
past spark and shred into his melting mind.
Every act of violence, every crime he ever committed --
beatings, murders, acts of torture and revenge -- are now
revisited upon Fusco tenfold. This is the PENANCE STARE, and
Fusco is feeling it's full, hellish force. The Ghost Rider
and Fusco SCREAM in sync.
Carrigan and Rain can't look away. They stand transfixed --
Then it's over. The Ghost Rider drops Fusco into the mud.
He lies there, shuddering, glassy-eyed, burned black but
still alive, his brain irrevocably overloaded.
And The Ghost Rider is somehow different too. Immobile.
Internal. Then he looks up, past Carrigan. R;rht at. Rain.
Rain stares back. But it's --
BLAZE'S FACE
she SEES. An abject abyss of pain and shame and torment.
And Rain's terror is forgotten for just that moment, replaced
with something best described as empathy.
LIGHT AND NOISE
to the Ghost Rider's left. He turns -- the Tundra screams
out of nowhere, slamming into him at sixty plus.
INSIDE THE CAB
LANDSDALE ducks the shattering windshield, leaps from the
truck as it fills with fire --
The Tundra keeps moving, pile-drives the howling spectre
square into a massive boulder. The truck compresses like an
accordion, EXPLODES, engulfs the rock with fire --
Landsdale picks himself up, ready for anything. Carrigan
tugs Rain over. The wreckage burns out of control.
CARRIGAN
Did you kill it --?
LANDS DALE
Fuck if I know!!!
Just then, Nomi's pickup backs into view. Odell is driving.
Ca___gan snatches Rain up like baggage, starts forward.

dazed, in a muddy gully. She scrambles up to the lip, SEES
the burning Tundra nearby, SEES her pickup hauling away into
the night. She WAILS, tries to drags herself to her feet --
CREAK. The burning wreckage moves. Moves again. Nomi ducks
down, watches, uncomprehending. The crumpled truck is hurled
aside. Two tons. Tipped over like a packing crate.
Nomi slips down into the gully, gasping with fear. HEAVY
FOOTSTEPS and CRACKLING FIRE draw near --
Nomi dares to look up. The Ghost Rider stares down at her.
Like Death itself. Imagine yourself face to face with a
Great White, an unfathomable, impenetrable force of nature --
Then imagine that force turning away, sparing you. The world
exhales. After a moment Nomi dares to look again:
NOMI'S POV (THROUGH THE POURING RAIN)
All she sees is a MAN, in tattered clothes, rolling a busted
up motorcycle away into the darkness.
CUT TO:
Blaze approaches a mailbox, fishes a postcard from his
backpack. He writes the date, checks the time on his watch
and jots that down too. He addresses it, drops it in the
slot. Then he turns around and SEES --

NOMI
You were there last night.
BLAZE
Excuse me?
NOMI
when they took my daughter.
BLAZE
I don't know what you're talking about
NOMI
Yes you do.
Blaze tries to pass off his unease with an ill-conjured
smile. He pushes past her, moving to his battered
motorcycle. Nomi follows.
NOMI (CONT' D )
The Ghost Rider. It walked right past
me. It let me live.
(a whisper, intense)
I know what you are.
Blaze stares at Nomi, shaken.
BLAZE

Blaze heads north under a big sky castled with towering white

Prairie grasslands roll away on either side of the two lane
blacktop. But Blaze's landscape is deep within and dark,
dominated by the thunderheads of last night's horror.
He notches the throttle up a little, cruises at ninety.
Rolls his head back, lets the wind stream over his face.
Then he hears ANOTHER MOTORCYCLE. Blaze looks back --
NOMI
pulls alongside Blaze, riding a monster bike of her own.
Blaze burns away. But Nomi's no slouch. She matches his
speed and is back beside him moments later. She SHOUTS:
NOMI
PULL OVER! I NEED TO TALK TO YOU!
Blaze guns the bike again, jinks around an oncoming station
wagon that blares it's HORN_ But Nomi's still on him --
NOM I (CONT' D )
DAMNIT, I NEED YOUR HELP!!!
BLAZE
(IRRITATED)
LADY, I'VE HELPED YOU ENOUGH!
Nomi smiles. Blaze just slipped up and they both know it.
NOMI
I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE GHOST RIDER!!!
Angry with himself, Blaze throttles his bike to the max,
howling over the next rise on his back wheel, probably
hitting one-fifteen as he vanishes from view.
Nomi skids to a stop on the shoulder and waits, her engine
RUMBLING. Wind blows. Lizards click.
After a long beat, Blaze reappears. Stops far away on the
crest of the rise. Stares at her.

Blaze and Nomi weave their way through an obstacle course of
rusted car hulks and assorted junk, heading for a battered
Airstream trailer perched on the edge of a bluff.

But the one I grew up hearing was nagi

Vengeance.
BLAZE
You actually believe what you're telling
me?
NOMI
You kidding? I'm pure-bred Dakota. I

They reach the trailer. Nomi fixes glaze with a stare.
NOMI (CONT ' D )
what do you see when you sleep at night?
The dead? The faces of the people you've
taken?
BLAZE

J,t takes them. Not me.
Nomi nods, not sure she believes him. Enters the trailer.
Darkness has fallen. The sky glitters infinite black. Blaze
joins Nomi at the edge of the bluff.
BLAZE
Why don't you just go to the police?
NOMI
I did. But I'm red. They said they'll
"look into it". Truth is, I've had a few
run-ins with them myself.
BLAZE
Your daughter -- why does Starke want her?
Nomi takes a beat, looks away. Haunted, ashamed.
NOMI
Because he's her father. And he wants
her back. Billy-Ray and the others,
they're being paid to take her to him.
Blaze nods. Things are falling into place now.
NOMI (CONT' D )
Look, I believe things happen for a
reason. Call it fate, karma, whatever
you want -- but there's no way our paths
crossing was just blind luck. I need
your help, Blaze.
BLAZE
Just so you understand what you're
asking, this thing inside me -- I can't
control it. It just comes out. And when
it does, it's like I'm a prisoner in my
own body. There's no reasoning with it.
It doesn't have a conscience. It doesn't
even have a personality. It's just a --

You're looking for Starke. I'm looking
for my kid. We find one, we'll find the
other.

And then I don't care about the rest.
CUT TO:
A POWERFUL DUST STORM
Raging full force. Blinding dust and debris batter closing
store fronts. Roof sheeting tears away, street lamps rattle,
hapless LOCALS struggle to get indoors.
A lone coyote lopes through the havoc, trotting purposefully
against the wind, dodging cars, ducking flying boards and
planks. The animal passes under a sign: "HOWARDSVILLE CAR
RENTS".
CLOSE ON A MAN'S MOUTH
Lupine. Carnivorous. Speaking into a payphone handset.

She's alright, I guess. Quiet.

I think she's figured it out.

And how does she feel about that?

Inside the booth, the man is half-seen.
MAN
She's the most important thing in your
life, Carrigan. Make sure she arrives
safely.

And be careful. She'll kill if she gets
the chance.
The man hangs up, turns to look at the coyote staring up at
him. Once again, we meet --
AMBROSE STARKE
Same sky-blue eyes flecked with metal. Starke and Coyote
stare at each other, indifferent to the storm raging around
them- He starts towards the rental office.
CRASH! Petrowsky flies through the plate glass window. He
lands on the concrete, stunned, bleeding from multiple
lacerations. He tries to sit up, but his right arm is
broken, horribly mangled.

Petrowsky clutches at his wife's arm, trying to speak. A

Certain twists of that fate felt like

STARKE
strides towards them, his face a veil of unmerciful contempt.
The dust storm has taken on Biblical proportions, whipping

He snatches Helen up by the throat, snapping her neck with
inhuman strength, flings her lifeless body to the ground --
then he brings his boot heel down on Petrowsky'shead.
crushing it like an _aashell.
WOMAN (V.0.) (CONT'D)
It was obvious to me that I'd done

Starke turns now, regarding the mini-van. The boy is nowhere
in sight. He approaches, looks inside. The boy has fled.
We are low on the ground, tracking with the terrified Boy as
he squirms his way beneath the cars. He pauses, nervous.

appears, creeping along a parallel aisle. It pauses,
lowering its snout, peering at the boy from afar.
The Boy freezes. FOOTSTEPS approaching. He squirms around
for a better view --
BOY'S POV (BENEATH CAR)
We SEE Starke's boot heels a few dozen yards away, gradually
closing in on the car beneath which the Boy hides.
The Boy shuts his eyes. The FOOTSTEPS draw closer, then
stop. The Boy opens his eyes. Starke's hoots are just an
arm's length away.

exposed like a bug beneath an upturned rock. He looks up --
WOMAN (V.0.) (CONT'D)
And what seems like cruel fate is really
only Nature, red in tooth and claw.
THE BOY'S POV
We see a BRIEF FLASH of Starke. No longer a human
silhouette, but a SNARLING, lupine beast. The Trickster.
The Black Dog. Rushing towards us with open jaws as we --
CUT TO:
A HUMMER races along a desolate stretch of highway, passing
through an inhospitable landscape of buttes, mesas, and cacti.
43-
One hundred miles-per-hour plus. Whip around to SEE --
BLAZE AND NOMI,
riding their cycles. Up ahead is a postal truck. Blaze
HONKS, waves to the DRIVER. He's got a postcard in his hand.
He hands it to the driver through the open door, then
decreases his speed, falling back alongside Nomi.
As they scream over a hill, we SEE the White Buffalo Indian
Casino and Lodge in the distance.
NOMI
I don't like this. I spent the last six
years trying to forget this place.
BLAZE
You got any idea where Billy-Ray might be
headed?
NOMI
NO --
BLAZE
Then we should start with where he's been.
A swath of cheap housing, part-finished, mostly abandoned,
back-boning a steep bluff that overlooks the casino.
Blaze and Nomi dismount their bikes. She stares at a
particularly ramshackle house. Wind whips. Dead leaves
blow. A rusting swing-set twists and creaks.
NOMI
Never thought I'd be back here.
They pass cautiously through the front yard. Nomi's pickup
is parked nearby. The front door bangs back and forth. Nomi
pulls a revolver from her waist-band.
BLAZE
I think they're gone.
Off Nomi's look, Blaze points at tire tracks in the dirt.
BLAZE (CONT'D)
Dual tracks. Looks like your old man
switched to a Hummer.
-- and steps out to meet their tormentors. Rodenburg and the
others are there now too. Rodenburg is grinning.
RODENBURG
Talked-to Billy-Ray, chief. Don't know
who you a r - e, but you picked the wrong --
Blaze struggles to contain the Ghost Rider, but his whole
body is drenched in sweat now -- like he's going to
spontaneously combust at any moment.
BLAZE
Please. Just tell us where they went and
leave. There's no reason why you have to
die.
Rodenburg LAUGHS, looks at his friends in disbelief.
RODENBURG
I'm gonna die? Me? Buddy, you got your
head screwed on bass-ackwards!
Rodenburg FIRES into Blaze's chest -- once, twice. Blaze
stumbles back against the porch. As he falls, Rodenburg
mounts the steps, charging in after Nomi.
Doyle waits on guard duty, bored, when suddenly --

CONTINUED:
BLAZE
sits up. He looks to Doyle, TEARS OF FIRE streaming from his
eyes. As he stands, his chest wounds ignites, the flames
instantly cauterizing the flesh. He's suddenly engulfed in a
heat haze. Wood smolders all around him.
Doyle backs away, terrified. He FIRES his gun again and
again, but the bullets just punch through Blaze, creating
more flaming holes-
They burst out the front door, clothes alight, racing across
the yard towards their vehicles. Rodenburg looks back --
The Ghost Rider EXPLODES through the front of the house,
skids to a halt, flicks out a chain -- and snags Rode burgs
ankle. He falls, SCREAMING. The chain retracts --
Pennebaker reaches his vehicle, struggles with the door -
TheGhost Rider thrusts a clawed hand outwards,clenchesthe
air and hauls it back in. Like an explosion in reverse, 4,11
fire is sucked violently back into his hellish being.
A frozen moment. All terrified eyes on the Ghost Rider
Then he lets rip. Hurls the energy back out as a torus of
white hot fire that expands across the yard, BLASTS
Rodenburg's shirt from his back, SMASHES Pennebaker against
his vehicle --
The vehicles EXPLODE, gas tanks rupturing. Pennebaker is
blown to pieces. Rodenburg SCREAMS, shields his face. Fire
and debris rain down in every direction. The Ghost Rider
looms over him. More accurately, it's --
GHOST BLAZE
Half man, half monster, his pitiless skull-face hazing and
flickering between human and inhuman states.
GHOST BLAZE
Where are they taking the girl?
Rodenburg whimpers. Ghost Blaze grabs Rodenburg's hair,
wrenches his head back.
GHOST BLAZE (CONT'D)
Where. Are_ They. Taking. Her?
RODENBURG
(BEYOND TERRIFIED)
North! They're headed North, into
Oregon, oh, god, fuck --
GHOST BLAZE
Where?
RODENBURG
I don't know exactly, Jesus, I don't know!
(CONTINUED)
56.
CONTINUED:
Blue-white fire floods down Blaze's arm and engulfs
Rodenburg. The poor man screams, struggles to break free --
aze simply crrows Otte ana ac
and the Ghost
Rider's evil countenance submerges every trace of Blaze's
humanity.
Then it's over. The flames evaporate. Rodenburg's corpse
crumbles to dust. Wind HOWLS. The Ghost Rider is gone.
ON BLAZE
He SEES the corpses, the burning vehicles, tries to deny the
horror. But it's always the same -- another swath of
destruction left in his wake, another righteous atrocity.
NOMI
He told you everything he knew.
She's ten yards away, shaking. Not going to come any closer.
NOMI (CONT'D)
Told you everything --
(BEAT)
-- you didn't have to do that.
BLAZE
You asked for my help. I warned you what
you were getting into.
More a statement than an excuse. There are POLICE SIRENS on
the wind. Blaze starts walking towards the pickup.
CUT TO:
A sub-par motel 6. Nomi's battered pickup is parked outside.
We HEAR Blaze's tortured MOANS coming from within.
The Hummer barrels off the road, SLAMS down hard into a
concrete culvert. Without missing a beat, Rain is out and
away, plunging into the cornfield. Carrigan and Landsdale
bolt after her, guns drawn --
ON RAIN,
weaving between the stalks. She reaches an old farm
implement, uses one of the rusting blades to saw through her
taped bindings. Then she's up again, running --
ON CARRIGAN AND LANDSDALE
searching high and low. Carrigan SEES movement to his right,
surges forward --
-- but Rain jigs left and Carrigan misses her, tripping over
the farm implement instead. He cuts himself, curses --
Rain continues, straight ahead now. Carrigan motions to
Landsdale. The two split up, drifting in different
directions. They're gaining on her --
BACK TO RAIN,
losing ground. She spies a rock, scoops it up -- and SMASHES
across C rr_gan's Face!
(CONTINUED)
64
CONTINUED:
Carrigan falls, dropping the gun. He searches for it,
desperate. Then he SEES it. But as he reaches for it --
-- Rain extends her hand, concentrating, eyes fluttering --
WHOOSH! The gun spins away from Carrigan, into Rain's hands.
She doesn't hesitate for a second -BLAM!-
First shot wings Carrigan, knocks Rain on her ass. Carrigan
DIVES for cover.. She FIRES wildly --CLICK-CLICK-CLICK-- but
then the gun is spent and --
-- Landsdale emerges through the corn, bagging Rain with his
coat. As a shaken Carrigan gets to his feet, Landsdale slips
his belt out of his pants and binds Rain tightly.
Carrigan and Landsdale return to the Hummer, which is still
nose down in the culvert. Landsdale carries Rain under his
arm, tightly wrapped, no longer struggling.
Odell sits on the hood, daubing the bloody wound in his leg
with a handkerchief. He SEES Carrigan's wound.
ODELL
Man, she shot you?
(off Carrigan's nod, disbelief)
Jesus. Lucky she didn't perforate my
ballsack with that fucking pen.
CARRIGAN
(RE: HUMMER)
What's the damage?
ODELL
Mounts are cracked, trans-axle's shot to
HELL --
(shaking his head)
-- this baby ain't goin' nowhere.
CARRIGAN
Fuck. Ma.
Carrigan fumes, glances at Rain -- then he just snaps, starts
angrily kicking at the door. After a few futile moments, he
stops, paces, looks to Landsdale.
CARRIGAN (CONT'D)
We're going to need a place where we can
hole up `til tomorrow. Wait for those
boys of yours.
(CONTINUED)
65.
CONTINUED:
LANDSDALE
How `bout up there?
Landsdale points past Carrigan at a squat group of buildings
and machinery -- a shut-down ROCK QUARRY in the distance.
From a distance, we watch as Landsdale approaches a
guardhouse with an empty gas can. A GUARD opens the electric
gate, steps out to help. Landsdale pistol-whips him, drags
his limp body in through the gate.
INT_ QUARRY OFFICE - DUSK
The Guard slouches in a corner, bound and gagged. Landsdale
and Odell lounge nearby, keeping a watchful eye on Rain.
Carrigan paces by a window, nervously cutting his deck of
cards one-handed. He's watching the shadows lengthen
outside, the setting sun. He looks to Rain, who matches his
gaze -- creepy eyes penetrating his brain.
CARRIGAN
(to Landsdale, anxious)
Where the fuck are those men of yours?
LANDSDALE
Don't worry. They're on their way.
Carrigan nods, cuts his cards. He j worried.
CUT TO:
The abandoned Hummer in the culvert. A gang of CROWS tear a
lizard apart. Dusk TIME-LAPSES into night. Stars.
After a time, Nomi's pickup comes racing past. Blaze is
driving, cranes to see the passing wreck. He pulls over onto
the shoulder. Blaze and Nomi climb out, approach the
vehicle.
Nomi shines a flashlight, SEES blood on the front seat. She
GASPS. Blaze reaches past her, touches the blood stain --
FLASH OF THE PAST
Chaotic and violent. Rain attacking Odell. The Hummer
crashing. The desperate race through the cornfield.

66.
CONTINUED:
BACK TO THE PRESENT
as Blaze steps away from the Hummer, into the field.
BLAZE
She's alive.
NOMI
How do you know ---?
But Blaze isn't listening. His gaze is now fixated on the
distant lights of the rock quarry.
Blaze and Nomi crest a rise in the field, hunker down:
THEIR POV:
We can see the main compound of the quarry from here.
Landsdale is in view, having a smoke by the guardhouse.
NOMI
You think she's in there?
Blaze nods.
NOMI (CONT'D)
Then let's go --
Nomi starts forward, but Blaze pulls her back.
BLAZE
No. We'll wait.
(POINTEDLY)
Dawn's less than an hour away.
NOMI
(taking out her gun)
You wait. I'm heading in.
BLAZE
Look, they're not going anywhere.
NOMI
You don't know that. This is probably
the best chance we'll get. They're
sitting ducks. We can do this if you --
BLAZE
If I what? Burn them alive? Eat their
spirits?
(DRAWING CLOSER)
(CONTINUED)
67
CONTINUED:
BLAZE (CONT'D)
You still get it, do you? The Ghost
Rider whales on whoever's got it coming,
but it's Johnny Blaze that gets to
remember their faces. And I Lb remember
them. Every last one.
Just then, we hear the RUMBLE of approaching MOTORCYCLES.
Lots of them. Blaze turns, SEES a line of BIKERS chugging up
the service road on ratted-out Harleys.
NOMI
They know we're coming, don't they?
Blaze nods. Once again, Fate is royally fucking him.
NOMI (CONT'D)
I'm going in. You with me or not?
Landsdale opens the main gate. The bikers THUNDER into the
compound -- low-rent Hell's Angel types culled form the
shallow end of the gene pool known as the Gray Gargoyles.
ARLO SKINNER, the Gargoyle's CEO, climbs off his hog, adjusts
his nut-sack. As he approaches Landsdale. GUNT and CHESTER
PULSIFER, his identical twin lieutenants, fall in behind.
ARLO
Brotherman.
LANDSDALE
Arlo.
ARLO
(GRINNING)
I believe you know the Pulsifer Brothers,
Chester and Gunt?
Blaze and Nomi scramble over a fence, then drop down, crouch-
running to avoid a security camera. They hug the shadows.
At least a dozen of the Gargoyles are in view, lounging
around, shooting the shit.
BLAZE
I'll find her. You stay here.
Nomi moves to protest, but Blaze silences her.
(CONTINUED)
68.
CONTINUED:
BLAZE (CONT'D)
If things go South and the Ghost Rider
takes over, I can't guarantee he won't --
NOMI
I know. I'm on my own.
(beat, more plaintive now)
, Just bring her back to me. That's all I
care about.
BLAZE
(NODDING)
Start disabling the bikes. Last thing we
need is a gang of pissed-off speed freaks
on our tail. Rip out all the coil wires ---
Blaze points to the motorcycle nearest him. Nomi rolls her
eyes and pulls out a switchblade, deftly slicing through a
fuel line. Gasoline leaks onto the ground.
BLAZE (CONT'D)
(CHAGRINED)
-- or you could do that.
As Blaze creeps away:
NOMI
BLAZE --
(as he turns back)
Whatever happens --
BLAZE
You're welcome.
Blaze leaves. Nomi starts in on the other bikes.
Blaze moves around the back of the compound. Up ahead, TWO
GARGOYLES are lingering by a side entrance.
WHACK! Blaze elbows Gargoyle #2 in the face. As the biker
drops, we SEE that Blaze has already disabled Gargoyle #1.
Blaze quietly slips in through the door.
Nomi has worked her way through a half-dozen bikes now and a
fair amount of gasoline has pooled on the ground around her.
Nomi slices through another fuel line, inadvertently drawing
the attention of a Gargoyle who was taking a leak. He zips
up his jeans, starts towards her --
Nomi tries to fall back into the shadows, but it's too late.
The Gargoyle has spotted her. He draws a Taurus pistol --
A FIREBALL erupts from the back of the building. The milling
Gargoyles spring into action.
Nomi takes advantage of the distraction, STABS the Gargoyle
nearest her in the thigh, bolts --
FLAMES belch from every window. Panic-stricken Gargoyles try
to start their bikes -- and the bikes detonate. one after the
other!
CRASH! Nomi's pickup barrels through the fence. She slaloms
through a gauntlet of flames, skidding to a halt. She SEES
Rain running towards her, throws open the passenger door --
NOMI
RAIN! "
Rain makes for the pickup, scrambles inside even as --
THE GHOST RIDER
strides from the burning ruins of the compound. With a wave
of his hand, the wall of flame parts like the Red Sea. He
locks his gaze with Nomi, points a skeletal finger at her.
His meaning is clear: "You are on the list."
Nomi floors the gas. The pickup slews and grinds, finds
purchase, leaps away from the monster as --
THE PULSIFER BROTHERS
emerge from the building, burned but howling for blood,
fueled by a lethal combination of stupidity and crystal mech.
Carrigan, Landsdale, and Arlo fall in behind.
The Ghost Rider moves, whipping his red hot chains. Left, he
lassos a passing gargoyle, BURNS him. Right, another
Gargoyle, dragged from his bike and reduced to ash.
Then two more lashes to either side of the brothers. Two
more victims reeled in -- charred corpses falling at the
Ghost Rider's feet. The whole thing took three seconds.
CHESTER
(to Gunt, nerves failing)
Forget it, bro, live to fight another day.
The Ghost Rider slams his skeletal hand on the tank of a
nearby bike. The bike glows RED HOT and CHANGES SHAPE,
getting bigger, nastier, demonically slouched --
GUNT
No fucking way! That's my hog!
As the Ghost Rider mounts the newly transformed hellcycle,
Gunt charges forward, infuriated. He OPENS FIRE with his
mini-un, .er. rounds a second.
(CD N, - _ 1 ID)

CONTINUED:
Moving with uncanny speed, the Ghost Rider grips Gunt by the
throat and hauls him off his feet, unleashing the full fury
of his Penance Stare.
A BLAST-WAVE OF LIGHT
erupts from the Ghost Rider's eye sockets, engulfing Gunt.
Gunt SHRIEKS, his cries becoming infant-like ULULATIONS.
Arlo, Carrigan, Chester, and the others instinctively shield
their faces, falling back from the infernal glow --
CHESTER
Gunt!
ON GUNT,
images from his own subjective hell assault him. Tears
stream down his cheeks as his body ignites. His corneas are
burning, melting.
The Ghost Rider starts to accelerate now, from zero to sixty
in an eye-blink, hauling Gunt's writhing body along with him
- straight into the burning building.
Nomi's pickup races into the night. A distant FIREBALL
ERUPTS hugely, engulfing the quarry, setting off a chain
reaction of smaller explosions -- BA-BOOM-BOOM-B-B-BOOOOM!
Rain clutches at Nomi, frantic, looking back.
RAIN
What about the Ghost Rider? We have to
go back for him!
NOMI
Are you crazy?! Sit down!
Then Nomi glances in the rearview mirror. Oh. My. God.
THE GHOST RIDER
is coming after them. HOWLING, plowing through the inferno
on his hellcycle.
Nomi floors the gas. But the pickup is already maxed out.
The Ghost Rider easily gains on the truck, leaving a wake of
burning asphalt. He lashes out with his chains, snags the
back bumper. The chain-links slice deep into the steel
bodywork. The Ghost Rider hauls up onto his back wheel --
Nomi slams on the brakes. The truck fishtails. The Ghost
Rider rear-ends the pickup. Bike and demon cartwheel crazily
into the cargo bed, SLAMMING explosively against the back
window of the cab. Hot glass showers Nomi and Rain --
The Ghost Rider is pinned, SQUEALING, entangled with his bike.
Nomi floors it again. The truck leaps ahead --
-- but the Ghost Rider hangs on as his bike slides backwards.
He reaches into the cab, clutching at Nomi. The pickup
thunders up a rise --

CONTINUED:
The Ghost Rider's skeletal fingers clamp Nomi's shoulder.
She HOWLS in pain, her clothing beginning to smoke. Rain
tries to help, imploring --
RAIN
No, no, no --
The truck makes the rise -- and there's THE SUN, dawning huge
and white. flaring mightily over the distant horizon.
THE GHOST RIDER
recoils, blinded by the dawn. He releases Nomi, collapses
backwards. His fire extinguishes, his skull-face fades --
-- and Blaze lies in the pickup bed, shaking. Nomi glances
back through the shattered cab window, her face a mask of
fear and sympathy. Blaze looks to Gunt's bike, which has
also reverted to its original state, then SEES --
BLAZE'S POV:
The bad guys coming on battered bikes -- Arlo, Chester, plus
FOUR OTHER GARGOYLES. And bringing up the rear, a seven ton
Mack dumper driven by Carrigan. Landsdale rides shotgun.
Blaze looks to Nomi, SHOUTS over the wind:
BLAZE
Give me your gun!
Nomi passes it back. The Gargoyles OPEN FIRE. Bullets zing
and whine. Blaze shoves Gunt's cycle off the pickup bed
The heavy wreck CRASHES and bounces, wasting the first
Gargoyle. The others swerve around the sliding debris
Nomi runs a stops sign, slews across a rural intersection,
pounds the HORN, swerving to avoid the crossing cars --
AN ONCOMING TANKER TRUCK
brakes, jack-knifes. Four gargoyles make it past, the fifth
is flattened. The Mack comes last, SMASHING a passing
minivan into a spin --

CHASE --

Gaining, riddling the pickup with BULLETS. Blaze is pinned
in the bed, can't get off a shot --
ON CHESTER PULSIFER,
hanging back and riding one-handed. He hefts a 66mm LAWs
rocket on his shoulder, LAUNCHES it --
Near miss. But the impact lifts the pickup's rear axle into
the air. Nomi SCREAMS. Blaze hangs on for dear life.
ON CARRIGAN,
hauling the Mack alongside Chester --
CARRIGAN
(yelling from the cab)
The hell you doing? I need the kid
alive!!!
CHESTER
Fuck the kid and FUCK YOU!!!
Chester aims the launcher again. Carrigan swerves, CRUSHES
Chester under the Mack's mighty wheels.
THE TROOPER CAR
pulls alongside the Mack, SIREN wailing. Carrigan veers
hard, forcing it into the opposing lane. Up ahead:
ROADWORKS. The highway narrows to a single lane --
BACK TO ARLO AND THE GARGOYLES
Gaining on the pickup, trading shots with Blaze at ninety
miles and hour.
Blaze wings one Gargoyle, then plugs another who loses
control, cartwheels catastrophically, EXPLODES --
Arlo zigzags the debris, guns his hog, screams closer. Blaze
fires but -- CLICK, CLICK, CLICK -- he's out!

ROADWORKS
The pickup mows down barricades like dominoes, clips a hot
tar cooker, spins spumes of molten tar in all directions.
HIGHWAY WORKERS run for their lives.
Nomi SMASHES through barricades, leaps a pile of rough
gravel. Blaze is nearly hurled out the bed, but hangs on,
shoulder screaming --
A FOREGROUND WORKER
operating a jackhammer fails to notice the careening pickup
racing by, which-is, in turn, followed by Arlo and --
THE MACK TRUCK AND THE STATE TROOPER,

BACK TO SCENE
Arlo rides against Nomi's door, lets rip with his Uzi. Glass
SHATTERS. Rain and Nomi duck --
Arlo tries again, sticks his Uzi right into the cab. But
Nomi forces the gun upwards. Bullets puncture the roof,
shell casings ricochet-
In desperation, Nomi reaches for the door latch, kicks her
foot against the door. The door swings outward, taking Arlo
along with it.
UP AHEAD
is a concrete divider. Nomi abruptly veers right, clipping
Arlo against the divider, killing him instantly.
ON BLAZE
hauling himself back into the pickup bed even as --
THE MACK
bears down on them. Landsdale jumps from the cab, landing
alongside Blaze. The two men struggle in the cargo bed, hand
to hand, exchanging a volley of vicious blows.
Nomi is desperate, doesn't know what to do. Landsdalp is
getting the upper hand. He grips Blaze by the throat,
forcing him over the side of the pickup bed, shoving Blaze's
head towards the churning wheels of the Mack --

pouring from his eyes. Blaze rolls, throws Landsdale over
his shoulder -- into the wheels of the Mack.
UP AHEAD, A MASSIVE ROADBLOCK
Barricades, bulldozers, dozens of state police cars.
The pickup and the Mack pass over a line of TIRE SPIKES. The
tires BLOW. The trucks drop. Metal rims SPARK and GRIND --
NOMI (CONT' D)
Hold on to something!
She brakes. The pickup fishtails. Carrigan also brakes,
struggling to keep the Mack under control. Then the Mack
catches a rim, flips, rolls --

The rolling Mack plows into the roadblock, seven tons of iron
crushing cruisers and barricades alike.
The pickup careens off the road, plunges into a cornfield,
hits a rut, grinds to a halt --

The aftermath. Trooper cars sliding to a halt.
Carrigan being dragged from the Mack at gun point, handcuffed.
Armed TROOPERS plunging into the cornfield, YELLING.
Nomi falling out of the cab, finding Rain, unhurt, alive.
She drags Rain into the sea of corn. Rain looks back, SEES --

WOMAN (V . 0 . )
My father used to say that the only way
evil came into your life --
Rain runs for her life, weeping, distraught, stumbling down a
rain-slick hillside. She SEES --

The windows of the jail pulse with HELLFIRE, panes of safety
glass EXPLODING OUTWARDS as a blast-wave expands and expands,
making the world go white.

Blaze sits against an old grave marker, gun in hand.
Thousand-yard stare in his eyes. He contemplates the gun
SILENT MEMORIES

ROXANNE,
radiant at the beach. Flickering sunshine makes her squint.

Fuck it. He presses the barrel against his forehead.
Squeezes his eyes tightly shut, compresses the trigger --

frustration and -- freezes, head cocked like he heard a
voice. He scans the cemetery: graves, trees, nothing. Then
he spins around ---
RAIN
stands behind him, waif-like. Big, melancholy eyes. They
stare at each other for a long time, not knowing what to say.
RAIN
My mother is dead.
The statement hangs. Another death. Another failure of
Blaze's part.
BLAZE
How--?
RAIN
My father found us, just like she knew he
would.
Rain looks down at Blaze's hand -- the gun resting there.
Blaze meets her gaze and tucks the gun away, embarrassed.
The wind picks up. Rain looks to the graves.

Do you think there's a heaven?

BLAZE
Yeah, I think there's something. Maybe
not angels playing harps and stuff, but

Rain wipes her nose with her sleeve, wanting to believe it.
RAIN
He'll keep coming, you know. Unless you
stop him.
BLAZE

I don't know that I can anymore.
RAIN
But you'll try, right?
Blaze regards her curiously. Even in grief, she's a
consummate negotiator.
BLAZE
I don't have anything left to give, kid.
Blaze stands, starts walking. Rain follows.
RAIN
My mother said you were a good man.
BLAZE
I'm not.

Alla! Mision de Sante Lupia!
High up the mountain: an old adobe building perched on
stilts, precariously overhung. On top of its bell tower, a
crucifix stands clear and proud.
RAIN
We're going to a church?
BLAZE
It's not a church. It's a mission. They
take people in.
Blaze pays the driver. The truck roars away. Rain looks
back to the mission, doubtful.
RAIN
Are you going to dump me there?

18th Century Spanish adobe. Chapel and dormitory, currently
under renovation. VARIOUS TOUGH-LOOKING MEN are at work.

BLAZE
Our car broke down a few miles back and
my daughter and I were wondering if we
could crash here for the night.
Tolbein sizes them up -- doesn't like what he sees.
TOLBEIN
Don't think so.
BLAZE
What about a ride, then? Is there a town
somewhere you could take us to?
Other men have gathered behind Tolbein -- VISCOTT, WILSON.
One of them, NUNEZ, nods to the South.
NUNEZ
Why don't you head back to Dawson? They
got motels there.
BLAZE
That's not really an option.
TOLBEIN
Then I'd say you're out of luck.
BLAZE
Look, you must have a cot, something. The
kid's hungry --
RHYMER (O.S. )
I'm sure we can figure something out.
JOE RHYMER, 50s, approaches, silences Tolbein with a look.
He's down to earth, capable, wearing a black shirt, cleric's
collar, oily jeans, and muddy work boots.
RHYMER (CONT'D)
(offering his hand)
Joe Rhymer. I'm the Padre.
BLAZE
This is Rain.
RHYMER
Rain? That's a pretty name.
(TO RAIN)
You hungry, Rain? Would you like
something to eat?
Rain nods. Rhymer ushers them inside. As he moves to
follow, Tolbein stops him.

TOLBEIN
Bottom line, Father. There's something
wrong with those two. Especially the
kid.
RHYMER
Duly noted, Richard.
(POINTEDLY)
And overruled.
ANGLE ON A RAGGEDY FIGURE
jutting into frame in the foreground. Blaze pauses at the
threshold of the chapel, looks back, uneasy -- but it's just
a SCARECROW being buffeted about by the wind.
BUILDERS working. Men carrying provisions. There's a small
vegetable garden in the center of the courtyard. Rain helps
the GARDENER pull carrots.
(CONTINUED)
95.
CONTINUED:
Blaze watches from a distance, cleaned up, clothes laundered--
Rhymer approaches, gestures to the garden.
RHYMER
It's turned out beautiful, hasn't it? We
try to be as self sufficient as we can,
back to the earth and all that.
He notices that Blaze is staring at the lowering sun.
RHYMER (CONT'D)
You any good with diesel engines?
BLAZE
I know my way around a flywheel housing.
RHYMER
Well I've got a generator out back that's
been on life support the last few weeks.
Mind helping me try to resuscitate it?
Blaze looks at him curiously.
BLAZE
Sure.
TIME-LAPSING SHADOWS cross the mission buildings and the
surrounding wilderness landscape. The lonely scarecrow
stares button-eyed and blank.
A STORM FRONT is moving in, huge thunderheads gathering and
roiling. Blaze pulls a dusty skid, pauses with the engine
RUMBLING. Looks back forlornly at the mission. Then he
wrings the throttle and hauls away into the night as we --
ANGLE ON A DORM ROOM WINDOW
Rain stands at the glass, watching Blaze leave.
CUT TO:
Blaze rides like the wind along a snaking road, away from the
storm clouds churning behind him.
RHYMER (V.0.)
-- and in him is no darkness at all."
UP AHEAD,
the land falls sharply away, spilling down into a wide
expanse of moonlit ocean pregnant with the promise of
release.
CUT TO:
Blaze rolls the Norton to a stop. Kills the engine. Sits
back in the saddle and drinks in the night.
The moonlit landscape is profoundly silent, the starry sky
clear and awesome. Nothing stirs.
(CONTINUED)
105.
CONTINUED:
Not a cricket, not a lizard. Just the moonlit expanse of
ocean below. Then we hear THUNDER, like distant artillery.
Blaze looks back over his shoulder --
BLAZE'S POV
Distant thunderheads. LIGHTNING flickering.
CLOSE ON Blaze, trying to drive Rain from his mind. We can
SEE on his face that it's a losing battle -- for poor, cursed
Johnny Blaze has finally understood his purpose on this earth.
CUT TO:
Blaze. Coming back. Ninety_ One hundred. Wind tears
wildly at his hair, jacket. The bike shudders. The
tachometer edges upwards --
One twenty. One twenty-five. Nitrous booster. The Norton
SCREAMS. One thirty. One forty. One fifty --
HEAT streams off Blaze. FLAMES wisp from his nostrils. One
sixty. One seventy.
The tachometer SHATTERS. The engine smokes. The bike
SHRIEKS, pushing the edge of mechanical reason.
FLAMES explode from Blaze's mouth and eyes. His hands
ignite. He CRIES OUT in agony. His body alters violently.
His face warps. Bones crack and shift. Flesh shrinks and
tightens as the skull-visage emerges.
The bike changes too, red heat spreading throughout.
Tortured metal SCREECHES. Straining machinery pops and
bulges. Shafts lengthen into skeletal "bones". The saddle
slouches. The tank distends --
WHOOMPF! The wheels ignite, then the whole bike. HELLFIRE
streams, an extension of Blaze's rage.
Blaze SCREAMS from the pit of his soul as the Ghost Rider
claws itself into being, more manifest that ever before --
And that's when the bike really accelerates -
-- so fast that its air wake churns the dust on each side.
(CONTINUED)
107.
CONTINUED:
so fast that molten asphalt spumes from behind like lava.
-- so fast that the goddamn camera can barely catch it and --
B-BOOM!!! The hellcycle breaks MACH 1, SONIC BOOMS rocking
the landscape as we --
CUT TO:
The wall fractures. Debris falls, tumbling hundreds of feet
down to the highway below.
The whole mission quakes. A huge hole in the wall falls
open, the Scarecrow barely manages to stop himself falling
The stilt-like support columns bearing the weight of the
overhanging mission begin to CREAK and bend. Some snap --
-- the entire mission, which was only moments ago completely
aflame, is now extinguishing itself. An inferno in
retrograde, roiling inward --
-- the dormitory folds up and slides away from them, pitching
over the hillside. Breaking into TONS OF PLUNGING DEBRIS
that CRASH SPECTACULARLY onto the highway far below.
ON GHOST BLAZE AND RAIN,
clutching precariously to a muddy hillside. Ghost Blaze
looks up, SEES --
DAWN APPROACHING,
first light bleeding in over the distant mountains.
Ghost Blaze strides over the smoking ruins. Finds what he
was looking for --
CARRIGAN,
back to human, hopelessly trapped deep in the wreckage. He's
barely alive, just a face in the rubble. Carrigan blinks.
CARRIGAN
(a ragged whisper)
who -- the fuck -- are you, anyway?
(CONTINUED)
114.
CONTINUED:
GHOST BLAZE
Vengeance.
And Ghost Blaze raises his hand, HELLFIRE trickling down the
length of his arm, swirling around his hand like a building
static charge even as --
CARRIGAN
(terrified, yet defiant)
Do it, fucker -- dQ it.
RAIN
appears on a ridge just before them, eyes locking onto him.
It's now or never.
Ghost Blaze hesitates, hesitates -- then abruptly reins the
flame back in. Metabolizes the fury. Pushes it down deep
through sheer, agony-inducing willpower. Ghost Blaze
SCREAMS, struggles --
-- and forces the Demon away,
Now he's just Blaze, weak with exertion, but triumphant for
the first time in years. He turns away and we --
CUT TO:
EXT_ MISSION GROUNDS - DAWN
-- Blaze and Rain walking, working their way across the
scorched grounds. Rain kicks at a carbonized jaw-beast
skull. It rolls, SMASHES against a tree, crumbles to dust.
Blaze looks up just then, HEARS the sound of ---
STARKE'S CADILLAC
It slows to a stop at the end of the drive, ENGINE RUMBLING.
Dusty and bug-begrimed from its cross-country journey.
Blaze braces himself. A silent inhalation of breath. Rain
stares, paralyzed by fear --
The driver's door opens. A hulking silhouette steps out.
The Beast, backlit by the fiery dawn which is just breaking
over the horizon. Sunlight FLARES outward, briefly blinding
us. And when it subsides --
STARKE
is standing there. Human. Windblown. He raises a hand,
shielding his gaze from the light. Steps cowards them --
(CONTINUED)
115.
CONTINUED:
Blaze moves in front of Rain, blocking Starke's path.
They stand there in silence. And Starke smiles, eyes alight
with mischief.
STARKE
Looks like we've come to the end of the
road, haven't we?
BLAZE
Guess so.
After a long beat:
STARKE
Give me the girl and I'll lift the curse.
Blaze looks down at Rain. This was all he ever wanted. The
only thing that has kept him going all these years. He
reaches into his jacket, retrieving a crumpled pack of
cigarettes. Plucks one out --
BLAZE
She's all yours, Starke --
-- and lights it without a match, somehow conjuring the flame
from within himself. He takes a long drag. In the pits of
his eyes, something glows there -- a kind of lambent
darkness.
BLAZE (CONT'D)
-- but you'll have to go through me if
you want her.
Starke stares into Blaze's eyes. Doesn't like what he SEES.
STARKE
Don't be a fool, Blaze. I'm offering you
your life back.
BLAZE
That's not a life. And least now one I'm
interested in living.
STARKE
You think you can control it. You can't.
BLAZE
Guess I'm willing to take my chances.
Starke nods, accepting defeat. For now. He looks down at
Rain, a bitter smile creeping across his face --
(CONTINUED)
116.
CONTINUED: (2)
STARKE
You have your mother's eyes.
-- and walks away.
Blaze and Rain watch him retreat. Presently, a coyote slips
from shadows, joining him on the road. It--lopes along beside
him. We watch them disappear over a rise. Then they're
gone.
Beat. Rain studies Blaze, reaches for his hand.
RAIN
He'll be back.
BLAZE
Yeah.
BACK AMONGST THE SMOKING RUINS
We pass broken concrete, smouldering timber, a rock snake
constricting a mouse, an industry of beetles dissecting a
bird's carcass. Finally, we come to a small, deep cavity --
and there, tucked away in the darkness, we find --
WOMAN (V.0.)
And that's how it ended. With another
beginning. A kind of balance struck
between the flame and the fury.
BLAZE'S COIN
balanced perfectly on it's edge. How it fell like that, at
the heart of the wreckage, is a mystery that will probably
never be solved.
DISSOLVE TO:
On Blaze, riding hard, as a scorching desert noon TIME-LAPSES
into night.
ROXANNE (V.O.)
The world turns around without me. There
are sharks. And there are doves. And
nighttime holds far darker terrors than
death. But I am never afraid because I
know that he is out there, somewhere.
And that someday, somehow --
Blaze ignites, SCREAMS, hurls back his head --
ROXANNE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
-- he will return to me.
-- and the Ghost Rider rockets headlong into black.
THE END
