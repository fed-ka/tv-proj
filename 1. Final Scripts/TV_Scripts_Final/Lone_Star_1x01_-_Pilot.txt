                                        ACT I

      FADE IN:

      CLOSE ON a SUITCASE, large and empty. Suddenly, wildly 
      different types of clothes start to go in: 

      Suits, overalls, cowboy boots, beach shorts - it s like we re 
      seeing a schizophrenic pack for vacation.

      INT. MIDLAND HOME - BEDROOM - MORNING

      REVEAL the man packing - ROBERT ALLEN (33), lean and 
      handsome, aged right to the border between southern boy charm 
      and hard earned wisdom. Far from schizophrenic, he carefully 
      considers each outfit before adding it to the rest.

      His girlfriend, LINDSAY (23), the kind of approachable beauty 
      who probably won t meet you for coffee, but will give you the 
      nicest no you ve ever heard, is fresh from the shower and 
      still in a towel. She passes in and out adding toiletries. 

                                    LINDSAY
                    Shower s still leaking.

                                  ROBERT
                    Call Tim.

      Lindsay puts her arms around him, looks at the suitcase.

                                    LINDSAY
                    You really need all this for four 
                    days?

      Robert flashes a smile so natural and magnetic it could make  
      George Clooney jealous. He often does this in lieu of 
      answering questions.

      She starts to kiss him. He stops her.

                                  ROBERT
                    Honey, I have to get to the 
                    airport.

                                    LINDSAY
                    Okay. 

      She lets her towel fall. 

                                    LINDSAY (CONT'D)
                          (tiny wave)
                    Bye.

      A beat. Then they re all over each other.

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                      2.


      EXT. MIDLAND HOME - MORNING

      An aged, paint peeling three bedroom on a street of the same.  
      This is classic suburbia, Leave It To Beaver s neighborhood 
      on life support, but still kicking. 

      Robert hoists the giant case into the trunk of a ten year old 
      Honda in the driveway.

      He sees his neighbor MATT (24), linebacker build gone soft, 
      working on his car across the street. Robert waves.

                                  ROBERT
                    I thought you set your alarm for 
                    noon.

                                  MATT
                    Steph heard about that. She s been 
                      threatening to do drive-bys, make 
                    sure I m being productive.

                                  ROBERT
                    You still in for the party this 
                    weekend?

                                  MATT
                    It s on my calendar as Free Beer At 
                    Robert s.

                                  ROBERT
                    Actually, the beer s being paid for 
                    with what you lost to me at Poker 
                    Night.

                                  MATT
                    I ll be sure to tell people that 
                    when they complain about me 
                    drinking straight from the tap.

      Robert smiles, lowers the trunk. Lindsay is there when he 
      does. He indicates the yard.

                                  ROBERT
                    Hey, don t let that kid mow the 
                    lawn again.

                                    LINDSAY
                    It s just five bucks and he looks 
                    so pathetic.

                                  ROBERT
                    Then give him five bucks and leave 
                    the lawn. It relaxes me.

      He notices her hand is behind her back.

                                  ROBERT (CONT D)
                    You know, you don t have to give me 
                    something every time I go.                                                                                      3.


                                    LINDSAY
                    Mom did it for my dad and they re 
                    still together.

                                  ROBERT
                    Your dad left twice a year, not 
                    twice a week.

      She shows the hand, reveals she s holding a box of cereal.

                                  ROBERT (CONT'D)
                    Cereal. You re right, this will 
                    bring us closer together.

                                    LINDSAY
                    That s the wrapping. Present s 
                    inside. 
                          (caught)
                    I was in a hurry.

      She holds the box open. He reaches in, pulls out something 
      along with a handful of Cheerios.

      He looks. It s a plastic monkey keychain. 

                                  ROBERT
                    I ll cherish it always.

                                    LINDSAY
                    See that you do.

      He gives her a quick kiss, then-

                                  ROBERT
                    Now, you re sure you can handle all 
                    this party stuff? I left a list of 
                    all the meat I want and I was 
                    thinking we could maybe get like a 
                    softball game together, so I don t 
                    know, get some bats and gloves and 
                    stuff.

      She grins. 

                                    LINDSAY
                    Look how excited you are. You re 
                    like a kid. Should I get a 
                      moonbounce?

                                  ROBERT
                    You should absolutely get a 
                      moonbounce. In fact, don t rent it. 
                    Buy it. I think you and I could get 
                    some mileage out of that.

      She LAUGHS. He pulls her close. Kisses her goodbye. Takes his 
      time. After-

                                  ROBERT (CONT D)
                    I love you.                                                                                      4.


                                    LINDSAY
                            (recovering)
                    I m convinced.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. AIRPORT - MORNING

      In a series of shots that will become familiar, we follow the 
      suitcase as Robert drags it behind him.

      He hands it to the GATE AGENT.

                                  GATE AGENT
                    Morning.

      Robert flashes his smile.

      INT. AIRPLANE - MORNING

      Robert is in a middle seat, but it might as well be 
      Letterman s couch the way the passengers near him lean in, 
      engrossed. 

                                  ROBERT
                    I m still wiping my tears when he 
                    looks at the breathalyzer, kind of 
                      disappointed, and says,  You re 
                    free to go, but pull yourself 
                    together. Whatever The Notebook is, 
                    it s no excuse for driving like 
                    that. 

      General LAUGHTER.

      INT. AIRPLANE - LATER

      As people exit, the ones around Robert shake his hand, give 
      him their business cards.

                                  ROBERT
                    Lunch, absolutely, next time I m in 
                    Chicago.

      INT. BAGGAGE CLAIM - MORNING

      Robert stands among a group from the plane. They re watching 
      him like a magician about to perform. And so he does.

      As luggage comes down the conveyer, he eyes the group, eyes 
      the bags, then points.

                                  ROBERT
                    Blue one has to be Ann.

      The WOMAN (ANN) nods. General MURMURS of amazement. He spots 
      another. 

                                  ROBERT (CONT'D)
                    John, that abused-looking brown 
                    thing is calling your name.                                                                                      5.


      An OLDER GUY (JOHN) sheepishly steps forward, reaches for the 
      bag.

                                  JOHN
                    It s an heirloom.

                                  ROBERT
                    I ve seen steamer trunks in better 
                    shape.

      LAUGHTER. An attractive YOUNG WOMAN steps up.

                                  YOUNG WOMAN
                    Do me.

      Robert looks her over. 

                                  ROBERT
                    Did we meet?

                                  YOUNG WOMAN
                    No.

      Robert takes this in. A challenge. 

                                  ROBERT
                    Okay.

      He looks at the bags, spots a sleek, hardback rollerbag. 

                                  ROBERT (CONT'D)
                    I m going to guess this one.

      She s genuinely stunned. A beat, then she reaches for the 
      bag. The small crowd CLAPS.

                                  YOUNG WOMAN
                    How did you know?

      Again, the smile-

                                  ROBERT
                    It s what I do.

      EXT. RENTAL CAR LOT - MORNING

      Robert goes straight to the VIP area with the waiting cars.

      CLOSE ON the trunk as he hoists his own big suitcase in.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. RENTAL CAR - MORNING

      Robert drives into a suburban neighborhood, pulls up outside 
      a house, stops. He pulls out a notebook, looks it over.                                                                                      6.


      EXT. RENTAL CAR - CONTINUOUS

      We see the trunk open. Then Robert reaches in and we see the 
      giant suitcase open. Hold on all the clothes, then...

      EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

      Robert, now in completely different clothes and looking like 
      he might have just stepped off a golf course, rings the bell.

      A MAN (ERIC) opens the door. He looks like he might have just 
      finished eighteen himself. Robert extends his hand.

                                  ROBERT
                    Morning. Robert Allen.

      INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DINING ROOM

      Robert and the Eric are seated across from each other, a 
      glass of lemon water before each of them. 

      Robert s in his element, a born talker in mid-story. It s 
      like having Michael Jordan bring his game to your driveway. 
      Eric is rapt.

                                  ROBERT
                    So I m in the fairway at Augusta 
                    and this guy rolls up in his cart, 
                    asks if he can play through. I look 
                    up... it s Tiger Woods.

                                  ERIC
                    No way.

                                  ROBERT
                    Looks amazing. Looks like he s 
                    going to play a round and then go 
                    chop firewood or something. So I 
                    say, of course. Sure. And then I 
                    say, maybe, Mr. Woods, sir, in 
                    exchange, you wouldn t mind giving 
                    me a bit of advice. He says, sure. 
                    So I stand over my ball, he watches 
                    me slice it off into a sand trap, 
                    and I say,  what do you think?  And 
                    he says,  I ll let you in on a 
                    little secret. There s only one 
                      guaranteed way to take strokes off 
                    your game.  And I say, I m all 
                    ears. And he smiles, and as he 
                    rolls away he says,  get an 
                    eraser . 

      Both men LAUGH. Robert takes a sip of his water.

                                  ROBERT (CONT'D)
                    Well, look, Eric, I could talk golf 
                    all day, but you re a busy guy, so 
                    let me get right to it. As I said, 
                    I m here because we ve got shares 
                    remaining in that mineral rights 
                    play we discussed.                                                                                      7.


                                  ERIC
                    Are we talking about oil?

                                  ROBERT
                    That s a great question. Sadly, the 
                    days of black geysers painting the 
                    Texas sky are more or less over. 
                    Oil these days is giant 
                      multinationals sucking every last 
                    drop out with newer and smaller 
                    straws. What we re talking about is 
                    rock. A very particular type of 
                    rock that most people think isn t 
                    worth anything, and never will be. 
                    But we ve been working on a sort of 
                      underground blender that would 
                    swirl water and chemicals with the 
                    rock until what came out would be 
                    gas. Now, not many people know 
                    about the blender, and even less of 
                    them actually think it works. 

                                  ERIC
                    That doesn t sound like the best 
                    start to a sales pitch.

                                  ROBERT
                    That s because it s not a sales 
                    pitch. It s the truth. Their doubt 
                    is our greatest asset, because it s 
                    what s allowing us to buy these 
                    parcels of land for next to 
                    nothing. But when we bring this 
                    thing on line these worthless rocks 
                    are going to be as valuable as 
                    gold, and these dirt cheap acres in 
                    the Hansen tract that we re buying 
                    now are going to be the engine that 
                    lets both of us tee up at Pebble 
                    Beach in the morning and count our 
                    money in the afternoon. It may not 
                    be as sexy as the idea of black 
                    gold, but I assure you, the money 
                    is just as green. 

      Robert flashes him that smile. A beat, then...

      INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      Eric leans across the table, signing a check. He finishes. 
      The two men stand, smile, shake hands.

      EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

      Robert stands in the doorway miming a swing as they exchange 
      golf tips. They wave goodbye.                                                                                      8.


      INT. RENTAL CAR

      Robert gets in, puts the check away. He takes out his 
      notebook, crosses one name off the list, looks at the next.

                                                                  BEGIN MONTAGE:

      ROBERT S CAR PULLS UP outside a SMALL HOUSE.

      HE PULLS UP outside a MANSION.

      A TRAILER.

      A TRACT HOME.

      ROBERT WALKS to a front door in a SUIT.

      HE WALKS to different door, now in JEANS AND A T SHIRT.

      HE S WALKING through a CORNFIELD with one guy.

      HE S ADMIRING a different guy s MUSCLE CAR ENGINE.

      HE S FLIPPING through another guy s YALE YEARBOOK.

      ROBERT SITS across a simple table with a glass of water.

      HE SITS across an antique table with a glass of scotch.

      A TINY TABLE with a cup of coffee.

      HE SIPS the various drinks, and we see him talking.

      THE VARIOUS HOMEOWNERS nod, smile, LAUGH.

      CHECKS ARE SIGNED on all the different tables.

      ROBERT SHAKES hands with each of the homeowners.

      ROBERT CROSSES names off his list.

                                                                      END MONTAGE

      INT. RENTAL CAR

      As Robert drives a phone RINGS. We see that he actually has 
      two different phones and two different wallets that he keeps 
      separated with an organizer strapped across the passenger 
      seat.

      It s the IPHONE on the right hand side that s ringing. He 
      answers.

                                  ROBERT
                    What? Clint, that s really not 
                      necessary. 
                          (beat)
                    No. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                      9.

                                  ROBERT (CONT'D)
                    I didn t say I wouldn t take it, I 
                    just said it wasn t necessary.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. AIRPORT - AFTERNOON

      Again we re following his big suitcase until he hands it to 
      the agent with a smile.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. TARMAC - AFTERNOON 

      This time, Robert steps out directly onto the tarmac where a 
      sleek Gulfstream G5 waits with its stairs down. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. G5 

      Robert sits in luxury, sipping a cocktail and looking out the 
      window as little people and places float by beneath.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. BMW - EVENING

      Robert drives out of the airport, past a sign that reads: 
      WELCOME TO HOUSTON.

      INT. BMW - LATER

      A phone RINGS. We see that the organizer is back on the seat 
      beside him, the phones and wallets in their place.

      This time it s an old NOKIA phone on the left that rings.

                                  ROBERT
                    Hey, Linds. Absolutely. Couldn t 
                    have gone better. Yeah. I m 
                    actually just checking into my 
                    hotel.

      But as he says this we see he s pulling into the driveway of 
      a MODEST MANSION. In Houston, 5000 sq ft of eaves, gables, 
      and brick is still considered modest. He pulls to a stop.

                                  ROBERT (CONT'D)
                    Of course. Hey. I ll see you this 
                    weekend. 
                          (beat)
                    I love you. 

      He hangs up, then puts the Nokia and the wallet from the left 
      side of the organizer in the glovebox. He locks it.

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    10.


      CLOSE ON the giant suitcase as we follow it up the manicured 
      sidewalk.

      EXT. HOUSTON HOME - EVENING

      Robert stops as his NEIGHBOR grabs his mail across the 
      street. Robert waves.

                                  ROBERT
                    Evening.

      The neighbor completely ignores him, steps into his garage 
      and immediately lowers the door, ending the conversation 
      before it begins. 

                                  ROBERT (CONT'D)
                          (to himself)
                    Good talk.

      Robert pulls out his keys, monkey keychain and all, and 
      unlocks the front door.

      INT. HOUSTON HOME - CONTINUOUS

      Robert steps into the well appointed space. A beat, then...

      In walks CAT (30), classy, gorgeous, former Miss Texas runner 
      up whose ambitions and abilities now go well beyond trophies. 

                                  CAT
                    Welcome home.

      Robert lights up at the sight of her. Without a word he pulls 
      her in, lets a deep kiss do the talking. When he lets her go-

                                  ROBERT
                    Seven more leases.

      Now her face lights up.

                                  CAT
                    The Hansen tract?

      Robert nods. Cat beams, not just excited, but proud. 

                                  CAT (CONT'D)
                    That s incredible.

      She leans in, WHISPERS-

                                  CAT (CONT'D)
                    I think this might call for a 
                    private celebration.

      INT. HOUSTON HOME - BEDROOM - LATER

      Robert unpacks. He sets the Iphone and wallet we saw on the 
      right side of the organizer on his dresser.                                                                                    11.


                                  CAT
                    And the alarm is still doing that 
                    thing where it beeps for no 
                    apparent reason.

                                  ROBERT
                    Did you ever call Tim?

      As Robert sets his keys on the dresser, Cat stops.

                                  CAT
                    Who s Tim?

      Robert stares at his keys for a moment, catches sight of the 
      little plastic monkey keychain. He corrects himself.

                                  ROBERT
                    I m sorry, I meant, Mike. Did you 
                    ever call Mike?

      He turns to Cat.

                                  ROBERT (CONT'D)
                      Nevermind. I ll call him tomorrow.

      He looks at her admiringly. She smiles.

                                  CAT
                    So. Seven.

      He nods slowly as he moves in. They kiss. He leads her toward 
      the bed. As she GIGGLES under his touch-

      PAN and HOLD on his keys. 

      It s subtle, but beyond the plastic monkey we notice that 
      about half of them have little blue marks on them, the other 
      half have green.

      We PUSH IN on the keys, until all we can see is the single 
      ring that they all share.  Off that image...

                                                                          SMASH TO:


                                      MAIN TITLES                                                                                    12.


                                        ACT II

      INT. UPSCALE RESTAURANT - MORNING

      NOTE: ROBERT GOES BY BOB WHEN HE S IN HOUSTON. FROM HERE ON 
      THE SCRIPT WILL SIMPLY REFER TO HIM AS BOB.

      Bob is having brunch with Cat and his in-laws. DREW (26), 
      former UT frat guy who s been lost since graduating to a 
      world where keg stands count for so little, turns to the 
      waiter.

                                  DREW
                    Whiskey. Straight up.

      TRAMMELL (32), Brooks Brothers suit, might as well have 
      Wharton MBA stamped on his forehead, gawks at his younger 
      brother.

                                  TRAMMELL
                    It s ten o clock. In the morning.

      Drew ignores him, looks toward the end of the table where 
      their father, CLINT (60), the kind of classic, handsome, 
      boots and jeans Texan you see in the movies or the White 
      House, eyes him skeptically. 

                                  DREW
                          (nervous)
                    It s not a hangover cure. I mean, 
                    it is, but it s like real. Like 
                    medicine, from a doctor. Only...

      He pulls an unlabeled plastic bottle of clear sparkling 
      liquid from his bag and sets it on the table.

                                  DREW (CONT'D)
                    ... in soda form. 

      Blank stares. He presses on.

                                  DREW (CONT'D)
                    It s amazing stuff, Dad. I ve been 
                    testing it all week.

                                  TRAMMELL
                    Testing?

                                  DREW
                    I ve never felt better. I mean, 
                    never felt better after drinking 
                    all night. I haven t missed a 
                    single day of work.

                                  TRAMMELL
                    Work?

      The waiter returns with the whiskey. Drew opens the bottle 
      with a SWISH, adds some of the soda.                                                                                    13.


                                  DREW
                    See, the brilliant thing is, you 
                    can actually mix it with the 
                    alcohol so you re taking the 
                    medicine while you re drinking.

      He passes the glass towards his father. Clint stops him.

                                  CLINT
                    It s... a little early for me, son.

      Drew holds the drink out a moment, embarrassed. Bob reaches 
      for it.

                                  BOB
                    Send it over here. I ll give it a 
                    shot, Drew.

      Drew, thankful for the bail out, hands the drink to Bob. Bob 
      takes a sip. 

      His face immediately registers disaster. He tries to hide it 
      but can t help COUGHING and SPUTTERING as he chokes it down.

      Clint LAUGHS. Bob does his best to put on a smile.

                                  BOB (CONT'D)
                    Well... if you put that in my 
                    drinks I definitely would not get 
                    drunk.

                                  DREW
                    See.

                                  TRAMMELL
                    He s saying it tastes too terrible 
                    to ingest, Drew.

                                  DREW
                    What? No he s not. Are you, Bob?

                                  BOB
                    I m sure they re working on the 
                    flavor.

                                  CLINT
                    What are you looking for, son?

      Drew nods. He was working up to this.

                                  DREW
                    They just need another half million 
                    to get things up and-

                                  TRAMMELL
                    Uh- no.

                                  DREW
                    This is an effective, uh - I mean, 
                    they ve got a business plan and -                                                                                    14.


                                  TRAMMELL
                    No.

                                  DREW
                    It s like - venture capital.

                                  TRAMMELL
                    We re not venture capitalists, 
                    Drew. We re an oil company. One 
                    that s spent the last three 
                    quarters in the red.

                                  CLINT
                    I m afraid he s right, Drew. In 
                    fact, that s why I ve asked you all 
                    to be here this morning. As you 
                    know, times have been tough of late 
                    and some of the bets we ve made 
                    haven t panned out. Frankly, I 
                    think it s time to try a fresh 
                    approach.

      Trammell is suddenly beaming.

                                  TRAMMELL
                    Dad, I think that s incredibly 
                    wise. I ve got a number of ways I 
                    think we can boost revenue and-

                                  CLINT
                    Hold on son. It s not that I don t 
                    believe in those degrees of yours, 
                    Lord knows I paid enough for them. 
                    But Bob over here, without a high 
                    priced degree to speak of, with no 
                    sales staff or office tower, or 
                    even a father in law who thought he 
                    had a prayer, has spent the last 
                    five years doing what no one else 
                    seems to be able to do: making 
                    money. That s called building 
                    something out of nothing, and it s 
                    how we used to do it in this 
                    country and this company. And if 
                    we re going to right our ship, I 
                    think we re going to have to learn 
                    to do it again. Which is why, Bob, 
                    I d like you to consider joining 
                    Thatcher Oil.

      Everyone is stunned. Cat looks jubilant. Trammell is beside 
      himself.

                                  TRAMMELL
                    Dad, we need to discuss this.

      Clint isn t even looking at Trammell, just Bob.

                                  BOB
                    Sir, that s very generous. I-                                                                                    15.


                                  CLINT
                    Don t act surprised, Bob. When 
                    someone starts sending the jet to 
                    fetch you, you know you re being 
                    wooed.

      Bob smiles.

                                  BOB
                    Fair enough.

                                  CLINT
                    Whatever you re looking for, salary 
                    and all that nonsense, it can be 
                    worked out. I don t mean for this 
                    to be about money. It s about you 
                    finally, fully, becoming a part of 
                    this family.

      Bob appears genuinely humbled.

                                  BOB
                    Can I sleep on it?

                                  CLINT
                    Just don t sleep long. As Cat s 
                    pointed out a million times, I 
                    should have done this a long time 
                    ago. Having finally figured that 
                    out, the last thing I want to do is 
                    wait.

      EXT. VALET STAND - MORNING

      Cat is bursting out of her skin as they wait. 

                                  CAT
                    I m so proud of you! To finally 
                    have you working with Daddy, this 
                    is everything I ve been hoping for. 

                                  BOB
                    Let s not jump the gun. We ve got 
                    our own thing, you know. I need to 
                    really think about this.

      Cat looks at him, realizing for the first time that he s 
      seriously on the fence.

                                  CAT
                    But, honey, you d be perfect, and 
                    they really need someone who-

      Clint HONKS from behind the wheel of a large pickup.

                                  BOB
                    Go on. We ll talk about it later.

      She kisses him.                                                                                    16.


                                  CAT
                    You know I trust your judgement, 
                    but this would really mean 
                      everything to me.

      She heads for Clint s truck. Once she s gone, Bob pulls the 
      Nokia phone from his left pocket: 2 Messages.

      EXT. THATCHER RANCH - DAY

      A deep sky and towering clouds swirl over a vast undulating 
      landscape. Clint and Cat CLIP CLOP through on horseback like 
      figures wandering in a postcard.

                                  CLINT
                    Forget just putting you in the 
                    ground. They ll blast you into 
                    space for a price. Press you into a 
                    diamond. Read the other day, I m 
                    not making this up, they can turn 
                    you into lead for a pencil. How 
                    would you like that? Get to write 
                    up shopping lists with your dead 
                      relatives.

      Cat eyes him. They ride in silence for a moment.

                                  CAT
                    You re not... sick or something are 
                    you?

      Clint LAUGHS.

                                  CLINT
                    Jesus. Turn sixty and you so much 
                    as mention death everybody thinks 
                    you re about to kick. I m just 
                    making conversation. I ve got at 
                    least another sixty before you turn 
                    me into anything.

                                  CAT
                    Good.

      They ride to the top of a small rise, stop. From here, the 
      views stretch on for days. They drink it in without a word.

      After a moment Cat senses Clint s eyes on her. She turns to 
      find him staring. She seems to understand, lets him look.

                                  CLINT
                    You dodged a bullet, you know.

                                  CAT
                    How s that?

                                  CLINT
                    Don t think my features would have 
                    looked good on a woman. Lucky for 
                    you, you look just like her.                                                                                    17.


      Cat turns back to the view. Clint lingers on her, then looks 
      around.

                                  CLINT (CONT'D)
                    This was her favorite spot.

                                  CAT
                    I know.

      A long silence. Only the clouds move.

                                  CLINT
                    I don t think your brothers even 
                    remember.

                                  CAT
                    They may have forgotten the exact 
                    day, but they remember, trust me. 

                                  CLINT
                    364 days a year I m pretty much 
                    past it. Just this one I wish... 
                    hell, I d settle for a pencil.

      Cat smiles. A long beat. They change the subject with their 
      eyes. 

                                  CAT
                    Thank you.

                                  CLINT
                    Nothing to thank me for. You ve 
                    been campaigning for him since the 
                    day you met. Just took me longer to 
                    listen than I care to admit.  Got 
                    all wrapped up in wanting my little 
                    girl to go to a guy from money with 
                    obvious prospects for making more 
                    of it.

                                  CAT
                    We tried that the first time, 
                    remember?

                                  CLINT
                    Yes. And I was wrong about that one 
                    too. Apparently a good family name 
                    does not prevent you from being an 
                    ass.

                                  CAT
                    Having Trammell should have taught 
                    you that.

      Clint LAUGHS.

                                  CAT (CONT D)
                    You know, if I hadn t quit school 
                    to marry that moron you could be 
                    working with me instead of Tram.                                                                                     18.


                                  CLINT
                    As far as I m concerned only two 
                    good things came out of your first 
                    marriage: Grace, and the fact that 
                    it kept you away from the business. 
                    It s an ugly world where people do 
                    ugly things, me included. I ve 
                    never wanted that for you.

                                  CAT
                    But now you want it for my husband?

                                  CLINT
                    Nope. I want Bob to keep doing just 
                    what he s doing. If there s heads 
                    to be cracked, I ll handle it. Lord 
                    knows I ve spent a lifetime 
                      practicing.

                                  CAT
                    I just hope... 

                                  CLINT
                    You think he might not take it?

                                  CAT
                    He s got pride. You guys didn t 
                    want him before. He remembers that.

                                  CLINT
                    Can t blame him. If it were me, I d 
                    say you can stick that job right up 
                    your ass, old man. But I think 
                    Bob s going to say yes. 

                                  CAT
                    Why s that?

                                  CLINT
                    Cause I think he might just be a 
                    better man than I am.

      INT. THATCHER OIL - DREW S OFFICE

      Drew, feet on his desk, watches Sportscenter on his office 
      TV. Trammell sticks his head in.

      Drew jerks upright, makes an effort to change the channel.

                                  DREW
                    Oh hey, I was uh - which channel is 
                    CNBC?

                                  TRAMMELL
                    We need to talk about this Bob 
                    thing.

                                  DREW
                    Um. Sure. I m free.                                                                                    19.

                    I m not. Meet me at Tate s thing. 

      INT. HOUSTON HOME - FOYER

      Bob is heading out with his big bag and finds GRACE, 14, cute 
      but plain on purpose, waiting by the door with her own bags. 
      She smiles.

                                  GRACE
                    Bob is back.

      He drops his things, gives her a hug.

                                  BOB
                    Just barely.
                          (re: her bags)
                    You headed to your dad s?

                                  GRACE
                    Yeah. Just for the night.

                                  BOB
                    Oh-

      Bob grabs for his stuff, pulls out a copy of The Corrections, 
      hands it to her.

                                  BOB (CONT'D)
                    Took a while, but you weren t 
                    kidding. Awesome.

                                  GRACE
                    I know, right?

                                  BOB
                    What else you got?

      She reaches into her bag. Hesitates.

                                  GRACE
                    Now, don t judge.

      She pulls out one of the Twilight books.

                                  BOB
                    Vampires? Isn t that a little 
                      mainstream pop culture for you?

                                  GRACE
                    What can I say. Sometimes the sheep 
                    know the way to a teenage girl s 
                    heart.

      She holds the book out.

                                  BOB
                    My days as a teenage girl are long 
                    gone. Pass.                                                                                    20.


      She just keeps holding it out. A long beat. Finally, he takes 
      it.

                                  BOB (CONT'D)
                    I ll cover it with a Newsweek or 
                      something.

      Suddenly, Cat walks in from the garage. Grace s face 
      immediately sours at the sight of her mother.

      Cat however, is still beaming.

                                  CAT
                    Did he tell you the good news?

                                  GRACE
                    What? Are they opening a new 
                    country club?

                                  CAT
                    Bob s joining the company.

      Grace looks at Bob as if he s suddenly betrayed something 
      sacred.

                                  BOB
                    We re... discussing it.

      A HONK from outside. Grace starts to gather her stuff.

                                  GRACE
                      Congratulations, mom. I guess 
                    you ve finally turned him into a 
                    Thatcher.

      Grace steps out and heads for the waiting car. Bob holds at 
      the door for a moment, watching a Hispanic lawn care team 
      attack the lawn. He SIGHS.

      Cat joins him, looks over his shoulder.

                                  CAT
                    Why does she hate me and love you?

                                  BOB
                    Because she knows it drives you 
                    crazy, and being a teenager, that s 
                    her sole objective.

      He grabs his own large bag, gives her a kiss.

                                  BOB (CONT D)
                    I ve got an appointment. I ll call 
                    you later.

      INT. BMW - AFTERNOON

      Bob drives through a part of town where luxury cars do not 
      tread. He pulls into a giant strip mall anchored by a failed 
      Wal-Mart, and rolls to a stop outside a completely anonymous 
      storefront.                                                                                    21.


      INT. PETRO PARTNERS

      Bob unlocks the door, steps in. On the ground are stacks of 
      mail addressed to PETRO PARTNERS. He picks some up.

      The space around him is almost completely empty, save a desk 
      with an up to date computer, several cell phones, and tons of 
      papers.

      A VOICE - 

                                  VOICE (O.C.)
                    About time. Where have you been?

      Bob looks up to find JOHN (62), white haired, a hard edged 
      handsome, coming out of the bathroom.

                                  JOHN
                    Wondered if the law hadn t finally 
                    caught up to you.

      John flashes a smile so smooth and familiar he can only be 
      Bob s - 

                                  BOB
                    Sorry, Dad. Been a crazy morning.

                                  JOHN
                    You re telling me. It s starting to 
                    hit the fan, boy. Got one who s 
                    demanding to see the well.

      Bob nods, distant.

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    Did you hear me? I got one who 
                    wants to - 

                                  BOB
                    Thatcher offered me a position. 
                    Wants me to help turn things 
                    around.

      John s jaw hits the floor. He wraps Bob in a hug.

                                  JOHN
                    You re in! Sweet Mary, you re in!

      He let s Bob go, still grinning. Bob seems less enthused.

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    What s wrong? This is what we ve 
                    been working for. 

      Bob nods.

                                  BOB
                    I know. It s just... I mean, it s 
                    actually a good job, you know.                                                                                    22.


                                  JOHN
                    What the hell does that matter?

                                  BOB
                    I just think... I mean, what if I 
                    just, you know, took the job? For 
                    real.

                                  JOHN
                    For real? Real? What do you know 
                    about real? You think they hired 
                    you because of all your expertise 
                    in oil and gas? Because you ve been 
                    out making a fortune selling wells 
                    in the  Hansen Tract ? Because of 
                    your magic blender?

      John drags Bob to the door, opens it so they re staring at 
      the vast blacktop parking lot. He points to it.

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    That s the Hansen Tract right 
                    there, son. Those are your wells. 
                    You understand? That s what you do. 
                    That s who you are. And you re 
                    better at it than anyone I ve ever 
                    met in my life. But don t start 
                    fooling yourself. You re no more a 
                    real oil and gas man than that Ford 
                    over there is a real drilling rig. 
                    This is what we ve been waiting 
                    for, son. What do we always say? 
                    When you re asking for money, it s 
                    small time. When they re offering 
                    it, they re yours. Boy, they re 
                    handing you the keys to the safe.

                                  BOB
                    What about Cat?

                                  JOHN
                    What about her? She s not your real 
                    wife. She s not your family. She s 
                    the mark. This was never about a 
                    marriage, it was about worming your 
                    way into a multimillion dollar 
                    company so we could clean it out. 
                    Look, we ve run out a lot of rope 
                    on this one, and I know it gets 
                    confusing when you re inside for so 
                    long, but don t kid yourself. I m 
                    your family. I m the one who loves 
                    you for what you are, not what you 
                    pretend to be. 

      He looks Bob in the eyes.

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    Your mom and I, we had a shot like 
                    this before she got sick. When I 
                    lost her, I didn t think I d ever 
                    get another one, and frankly I 
                    didn t care. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    23.

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    But somehow we re here, and if it 
                    can t be her, there s no one in the 
                    world I d rather cross the finish 
                    line with than you. 

      Bob absorbs this. John pats Bob on the shoulders.

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    Now let s figure out what to do 
                    about this idiot who wants to see 
                    the well and then we ll start 
                    talking about how to play the 
                    Thatcher angle.

      A beat, then Bob nods.

                                  BOB
                    Sure. Just let me make a call.

      His dad flashes the family grin, then steps inside as Bob 
      pulls out his Iphone. Bob dials. 

      When he speaks, he sounds defeated.

                                  BOB (CONT D)
                    Cat? I wanted you to be the first 
                    to know. I m taking it.

      As we hear her joy on the other end of the phone, Bob stares 
      out at the largely empty parking lot, wishing he and it were 
      something else.


                                    END OF ACT II                                                                                    24.


                                        ACT III



      INT. AIRPORT - AFTERNOON

      Again we re following Bob s big suitcase until he hands it to 
      the agent with a smile.

      INT. AIRPLANE

      Bob is reading by the window seat when an attractive young 
      businesswoman (SARAH) eyes the seat beside him.

                                  SARAH
                    Looks like I m your B.

      Bob looks momentarily confused. She indicates the seat. He 
      realizes he s left his jacket in it, quickly pulls it back.

                                  BOB
                    Sorry. Please.

      As she sits - 

                                  SARAH
                    Sarah. 

      He extends his hand.

                                  BOB
                    Robert.

      Noticing his copy of Twilight-

                                  SARAH
                    Teenage vampires?

                                  BOB
                    Bookstore was out of Harry Potter.

                                  SARAH 
                          (grinning)
                    What do you sell, Robert?
                          (off his look)
                    Sit on planes half the week, you 
                    get an eye. 

                                  BOB
                    I m in oil and gas. You?

                                  SARAH
                      Pharmaceuticals. 

                                  BOB
                    You headed home or away?

                                  SARAH
                    Away. You?                                                                                    25.


                                  BOB
                    Kind of in between.

      She smiles.

                                  SARAH
                    Aren t we all.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. MIDLAND SUPERMARKET

      ANGLE ON Party Hats as a hand tosses them into a cart.

      REVEAL Lindsay and STEPHANIE (STEPH)(23), shopping for 
      supplies. Steph s cute with sharp edges. If she d grown up in 
      New York she d have a job as a critic. Since she grew up in 
      Midland she has a husband. 

      The husband in question is Matt, the slightly doughy neighbor 
      we met in the open, who appears and tosses large slabs of 
      meat in their cart with a smile.

                                  MATT
                          (proud of himself)
                    But wait, there s more.

      Steph shakes her head as he takes off-

                                    LINDSAY
                    At least he s available to help.

                                  STEPH
                    Oh yes, having him help with the 
                    shopping is way better than him 
                    having a job. So what s the point 
                    of this whole party anyway?

                                    LINDSAY
                    No idea. Robert just woke up one 
                    day and got all excited about a big 
                      neighborhood BBQ. He loves this 
                    kind of stuff.

                                  STEPH
                    Nope. You guys have been together 
                    almost two years. He s got 
                    something up his sleeve. Something 
                    round.

      She holds up her own wedding ring.

                                  STEPH (CONT D)
                    Although you ll probably be able to 
                    see the actual diamonds on yours.

                                    LINDSAY
                    What? No. We re not into all the 
                    like, labels and formality and 
                    whatever. We love each other and 
                    we re happy. That s all we need.                                                                                    26.


                                  STEPH
                    Please, you guys are so perfect 
                    you re like one of those tabloid 
                    couples with one name. You should 
                    be Linbert or Robsay. If you just 
                    keep being in love without getting 
                    married you re going to make the 
                    rest of us look like idiots. 

      As Lindsay starts to answer, Matt suddenly rolls up with an 
      entire cart packed with different beers. 

                                  MATT
                    Ta-da. See this way we get a 
                    variety.

      They ve achieved a shorthand that allows Steph to ask if he s 
      an idiot simply by raising an eyebrow.

                                  MATT (CONT'D)
                    Or we could just get a keg. 
                          (figuring it out)
                    We ll get a keg.

      He wheels his beer cart away. Steph turns to Lindsay.

                                  STEPH
                    If you don t get married how will 
                    you ever understand my pain? 

      EXT. DRILLING RIG - DAY 

      Bob rolls up to a busy rig in his rental and steps out. He 
      eyes the workers, looking for the man to talk to.

      NEW ANGLE as Bob walks up to the FOREMAN with his hand out.

                                  BOB
                    Hi there. Ted Lanford. I m a 
                    location scout. Got a director and 
                      a producer looking to shoot a movie 
                    out here, I wanted them to get a 
                    look at this place. We won t get in 
                    your hair, just need to be able to 
                    show them around. And the 
                      director s a little skittish, so 
                    probably better if no one talks to 
                    him. That won t be a problem, will 
                    it?

      The Foreman pulls back his hand to see two hundred dollar 
      bills in it. He looks up. A beat, then-

                                    FOREMAN
                    You need hard hats?

                                  BOB
                    Got our own, thanks.                                                                                    27.


      EXT. DRILLING RIG - LATER

      Bob, now wearing a hard hat that reads Petro Partners is 
      loading a briefcase on the hood of his rental. On top of 
      thick stacks of blank paper he places real money. 

      When he s done, it looks like the briefcase is full of money. 
      Satisfied, he closes it.

      EXT. DRILLING RIG - LATER

      Bob carries the briefcase as he walks around the rig with 
      LARRY, the nervous investor. He points to various things.

                                  BOB
                    My understanding is that they re 
                    driving through 8000 feet today and 
                    they ll start their first tests 
                    with the blender in the next couple 
                    weeks or so.

      Suddenly a pickup truck pulls up right behind them. Bob 
      stops, turns.

      Out of the driver s side comes his dad, John, also wearing a 
      Petro Partners hardhat.

                                  BOB (CONT D)
                    Oh, perfect, here s our foreman, 
                    Bill.

      John shakes the investors hand.

                                  JOHN
                    Nice to meet you, sir. You like a 
                    little tour?

                                  LARRY
                    Yes. Very much.

      EXT. DRILLING RIG - MOMENTS LATER

      John walks Bob and Larry through the site, pointing to this 
      and that, speaking with authority. 

      True to his word, the real Foreman keeps his head down and 
      completely ignores the visitors.

      EXT. DRILLING RIG - LATER

      The little group is back at John s truck, maps and geological 
      reports spread out across the hood. John s finishing his 
      spiel.

                                  JOHN
                    Certainly no sure things, but from 
                    the samples we ve seen so far? This 
                    thing s a home run. 

      Larry seems reassured, but iffy.                                                                                     28.


                                  BOB
                    None of which matters, Larry, if 
                    you re not comfortable. And 
                    frankly, you re right to ask 
                      questions. No shortage of scam 
                    artists looking to seize on some 
                    little nugget in the news and make 
                    a quick buck out here. This is a 
                      relationship business, one that s 
                    built on faith and trust. And 
                    frankly, those things are a lot 
                    more important to me than money. I 
                    can sell your share a thousand 
                    different times, but I only get to 
                    be your friend once. So I d like to 
                    buy you out. Give you back your 
                    entire initial investment, just 
                    part ways. No harm, no foul, we re 
                    still on each other s Christmas 
                    card lists. 

      Bob takes the briefcase and slaps it on the hood of the 
      truck. He opens it to reveal what appear to be stacks of 
      money.

                                  BOB (CONT D)
                    Didn t even want you wondering if 
                    the check was any good. Wanted you 
                    to have something you could take 
                    straight to the bank.

      He closes the briefcase, hands it to Larry. This is a huge 
      gamble, but Bob is as cool as they come. A long beat.

      Instead of reaching for the case, Larry puts up his hands.

                                  LARRY
                    That s really not necessary. I just 
                    wanted to do some checking, you 
                    know? But you ve more than 
                    satisfied my concerns. I d really 
                    like to stay invested.

      Bob keeps the case out.

                                  BOB
                    You sure, Larry? I don t want to 
                    risk our friendship over this.

                                  LARRY
                    I m very sure, Robert. In fact, 
                    based on what I ve seen, I d really 
                    like to buy two more shares. If 
                    they re still available, and you ll 
                    have me.

      Larry looks at Bob beseechingly. Suddenly this is further 
      than Bob meant to go. He stammers for a beat, seems like he 
      might balk. Then John steps in.                                                                                    29.


                                  JOHN
                    Frankly, that s probably about the 
                    best investment you ll ever make. I 
                    just wish I had the funds to put in 
                    myself.

      NEW ANGLE as Larry finishes writing a check for 100,000 
      dollars on the hood of the pickup. He tears it off, hands it 
      to Bob.

                                  LARRY
                    Thank you, Robert.

      Bob shakes his hand.

                                  BOB
                    Sure, Larry. Be well.

      Larry waves, then gets in his car and goes.

      John looks at Bob.

                                  JOHN
                    I d say I taught you everything you 
                    know, but you ve got moves I ve 
                    never seen. That was a pleasure to 
                    watch. They start begging you to 
                    take their money it s hard to even 
                    feel sorry for them.

      He pats Bob on the shoulders.

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    All right. I gotta return the 
                    truck. Where you headed?

      Bob s a little bit dazed.

                                  BOB
                    Midland.

                                  JOHN
                    Midland? What the hell for? Haven t 
                    you milked that place dry?

                                  BOB
                    I just like the place.

                                  JOHN
                    Well, you better watch yourself. 
                    Clock s ticking out there.

      His dad heads for the truck. Bob stares down at the check.

                                                                    MATCH CUT TO:

      INT. HOTEL LOUNGE - NIGHT

      Bob still staring at the check as he sits nursing a drink. 
      It s clear he s conflicted about it.                                                                                    30.


      Suddenly, Sarah, from the airplane earlier, is standing next 
      to his table.

                                  SARAH
                    Look at this. Same flight. Same 
                    hotel. Our travel agents have very 
                    similar taste.
                          (re: the open seat)
                    You meeting someone?

      Bob smoothly pockets the check.

                                  BOB
                    No. Something wrong with my room. 
                    Hotel s buying me drinks while they 
                    fix it.

                                  SARAH
                    Sounds like a serious 
                      inconvenience. You might need help 
                    if you re going to get your money s 
                    worth.

      Happy for a distraction, Bob gestures to the chair.

                                  BOB
                    By all means, let s teach them a 
                    lesson.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. HOTEL LOUNGE - LATER

      There are several empty glasses before them and big smiles 
      plastered across their faces.

                                  BOB
                    No, no, no, you actually mix it 
                    with the drink. So you don t get 
                    drunk.

                                  SARAH
                          (confused)
                    Then... why drink at all?

      He looks at her, totally stumped. 

                                  BOB
                    I have no idea.

      The both LAUGH. 

      A quiet beat as things settle. Then-

                                  SARAH
                    Why didn t you just ask for a 
                    different room?

                                  BOB
                    I did. Booked solid.                                                                                    31.


      Long beat.

                                  SARAH
                    I ve got more room than I can use. 
                    You should come up.

      Bob smiles. He subtly TAPS his wedding ring on the table.

                                  SARAH (CONT'D)
                          (re: the ring)
                    Platinum?

                                  BOB
                    I don t know. I ll ask my wife.

      Sarah smiles, undeterred.

                                  SARAH
                    Don t worry. I m not looking to 
                    steal you. I ve been married. Not 
                    for me.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. HOTEL ROOM - INTERCUT

      Bob is standing in the corner of the room on his Nokia. We 
      hear Lindsay on the phone.

                                    LINDSAY 
                          (filter)
                    And I m pretty sure we got all the 
                    meat in Midland. And Matt says he s 
                    got a bunch of softball stuff.

      Lindsay s voice fades out as Bob nods along.

                                  SARAH (V.O.)
                    All marriage really means is that 
                    you take a person you used to want 
                    to tear the clothes off of and 
                    agree to exchange daily reports on 
                    minutia. Who did and said what to 
                    who, how it went, what has to be 
                    done and said tomorrow.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Sarah looks across the table.

                                  SARAH
                    I still make a call like that 
                    everyday, but it s to my office. 
                    The only difference between work 
                    and marriage is that one of them 
                    pays. 

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    32.


      INT. HOTEL ROOM

      Bob is on his Iphone now. It s Cat s voice we hear.

                          (filter)
                    And I just have to sit there and 
                    smile because God forbid I bring up 
                    whether or not it s a good idea to 
                    keep a fourteen year old up until 
                    2am on a school night.

      Bob begins to take off his tie.

                                  BOB (V.O.)
                    What about being a part of 
                    something that s real? That lasts?

                                  SARAH (V.O.)
                      Overrated, believe me. Besides, 
                    studies show couples are never 
                    nicer to one another than when one 
                    of them has something to hide.

      Bob looks at the bathroom door. It s closed, a little crack 
      of light at the bottom letting us know someone s inside.

                                                                            CUT TO:

                    Sounds like you ve got this all 
                    worked out.

                                  SARAH
                    What do you expect? I sell for a 
                    living. And so do you, so let s 
                    just look at the cost benefit of it 
                    all.

      She reaches for his leg under the table.

                                  SARAH (CONT'D)
                    Do you find me attractive?

      Bob nods slowly.

                                  SARAH (CONT'D)
                    You think we ll ever see each other 
                    again?

      Bob shakes his head.

                                  SARAH (CONT'D)
                    Any reason anyone besides us would 
                    ever have to know?                                                                                    33.

                    No.

                                  SARAH
                    Then give me one good reason why we

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. HOTEL ROOM

      Bob starts to unbutton his shirt. He eyes the bathroom door.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. HOTEL LOUNGE

      Sarah leans in, puts her hand on Bob s, covering his ring.

                                  SARAH
                    One good reason.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. HOTEL ROOM

      Bob walks toward the bathroom door as he finishes unbuttoning 
      his shirt.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. HOTEL LOUNGE

      Bob flashes that magnetic smile. He takes her hand, kisses 
      it, and stands.

                                  BOB
                    I can think of two.                                                                                    34.


      He walks away, alone.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. HOTEL ROOM

      Bob opens the bathroom door revealing A MAINTENANCE MAN just 
      finishing up. As the man gathers his things and moves out-

                                    MAINTENANCE MAN
                    My apologies. Should be working 
                    now, but the hot water might take a 
                    few minutes.

                                  BOB
                    Cold will be just fine.


                                  END OF ACT III                                                                                    35.


                                        ACT IV

      EXT. TIFFANY S - MORNING

      Bob waits as a CLERK unlocks the door.

                                  CLERK
                    Good morning.

      INT. TIFFANY S - MOMENTS LATER

      Bob looks over a case of diamond necklaces, points to a 
      monster.

      EXT. TIFFANY S - MOMENTS LATER

      Bob walks out armed with a little blue bag and a giant smile.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. AIRPORT

      We re following Bob s giant suitcase again as he hands it off 
      to the agent.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. AIRPLANE

      Bob is again holding court among the other passengers. They 
      LAUGH.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. AIRPORT

      Bob drives past a sign that says WELCOME TO MIDLAND in his 
      aged little Honda.

      EXT. MIDLAND HOME

      Bob pulls up, opens the door, drinks in the scene. His house, 
      his neighborhood, his lawn. Without even going inside, he 
      starts to unbutton his shirt.

      EXT. MIDLAND HOME - MOMENTS LATER

      Now topless, Bob pushes his lawnmower across the yard, making 
      perfect little lines. Lindsay steps onto the front porch and 
      shakes her head like he s crazy.

      He shrugs and smiles in a way that says,  It s just the way I 
      am.  It s as content as we ve seen him look.

      EXT. STADIUM - DAY

      Practice. Trammell and Drew are focused on Trammell s son, 
      the quarterback, TATE THATCHER, as he zings a ball downfield.

      Drew WHISTLES with admiration.                                                                                    36.


                                  TRAMMELL
                    Fox Sports has him as the top 
                    prospect in the state. That s as a 
                    junior. Talked to Pete Carroll 
                      yesterday.

      Drew watches in reverie.

                                  DREW
                      I remember those days. God, 
                    wouldn t you give like, anything, 
                    to go back? Just for a while?

                                  TRAMMELL
                          (eyes on the field)
                    You never had days like that.
                          (redirecting)
                    About this Bob thing. We need to 
                    get on the same page.

      Drew is only half listening, his eyes now on the practicing 
      cheerleaders.

                                  DREW
                    I thought it sounded like a good 
                    thing. Bob s been doing well.

                                  TRAMMELL
                    Maybe so, maybe not, but that s no 
                    reason to jump the line. We ve put 
                    in our time. What do we get?

      Drew shrugs, unsure.

                                  TRAMMELL (CONT D)
                    So what if he is making money? Dad 
                    used to crush guys like Bob, not 
                    hire them. The mere fact that he 
                    wants to bring him in makes me 
                    think he s losing his edge.

                                  DREW
                    Dad? He punched out a roughneck for 
                    stealing pipe three weeks ago. Ask 
                    that dude if he s going soft.

      Trammell s face says that for all his talk, Clint s still not 
      someone he wants to tangle with.

                                  DREW (CONT D)
                    Besides, what s Dad supposed to do? 
                    Bob s family. 

                                  TRAMMELL
                    Yeah? Ask Uncle Roy if that 
                    matters.

                                  DREW
                    Uncle Roy s dead.
                          (walked into that one)
                    Oh.                                                                                    37.


                                  TRAMMELL
                    Look, I ll figure all this out. All 
                    I need from you is to know that 
                    you ll support me.

      Drew looks at Trammell, surprised by the request.

                                  DREW
                          (genuine)
                    We re brothers, Tram. Of course.

      A WHISTLE from the field as practice breaks. As Tate steps 
      off he gets a hug from a KNOCKOUT CHEERLEADER.

      Drew sees this and smiles.

                                  DREW (CONT'D)
                    Damn! Is that his girlfriend?

      Trammell stands, collects his stuff.

                                  TRAMMELL
                    Yeah.

      Drew shakes his head in appreciation.

                                  DREW
                    Just like his Uncle Drew.

      As Trammell heads out.

                                  TRAMMELL
                    Trust me, we re not going to let 
                    that happen.

      Drew, blindsided, waits a few beats then flips the bird to 
      his brother s back as he walks away.

      EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - CONTINUOUS

      Grace slides over to Tate, both of them eying the stands.

                                  GRACE
                    Is that Uncle Drew flipping off 
                    your dad?

                                  TATE
                    Looks that way.

                                  GRACE
                    Why are they here?

                                  TATE
                    Dad shows up to watch a couple days 
                    a week. I guess Drew came out to 
                    flip him off.

      Tate s girlfriend KAYLA (the cheerleader) looks at Grace.                                                                                    38.


                                  KAYLA
                    Hey Grace.

      Grace just nods, intimidated by the older, prettier girl.

                                  GRACE
                          (to Tate)
                    You ready?

                                  TATE
                    Yeah.
                          (to Kayla)
                    Call you later.

      He kisses her on the cheek. Grace watches with a tinge of 
      jealousy. Tate may be her cousin, but that doesn t mean she 
      doesn t eye him just like all the other girls do.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. TATE S BMW - AFTERNOON

      Tate s behind the wheel of a brand new BMW. Grace stares out 
      the window.

                                  TATE
                    I guess you heard about Bob?

                                  GRACE
                    Yeah. Sucks.

                                  TATE
                    Why? Now everyone will be working 
                    together.

                                  GRACE
                    Exactly. The only good thing this a-
                    hole family ever did was shut Bob 
                    out. All their stupid country 
                    clubs, and dinner parties, and 
                    spoiled brats demanding new cars 
                    the day they turn sixteen, he 
                    wasn t even allowed near that crap. 
                    That s why he stayed cool, normal.

      An awkward silence.

                                  TATE 
                    I didn t ask for the car, you know. 
                    Dad just gave it to me. 

      He looks at her for reassurance.

                                  GRACE
                    I know.

      Off her attempt to absolve him with a smile-                                                                                    39.


      EXT. SOFTBALL FIELD - DAY

      CRACK! Bob rips a liner into left field. As people CHEER he 
      drops his bat and runs for first. 

                                                                SERIES OF SHOTS:

      BOB RUNS past second base. The players converge on him and 
      point him back. He returns to second where s he s forced to 
      down a beer from a keg just behind the base before stumbling 
      on to third.

      LINDSAY THROWS the ball to Steph who chases Matt down between 
      bases. When she gets close, he starts to run in circles, 
      makes her chase him into the outfield.

      BOB CHUCKS the ball from the outfield to home plate where a 
      LITTLE GIRL playing catcher scoops it up just in time to see 
      Matt barreling down on her from third. 

      The girl closes her eyes. At the last second, instead of 
      sliding into her, Matt hoists her up with both arms, holding 
      her at a distance where she can t reach him with the ball, 
      and leaps on home plate with her in his arms.

      People crowd around, LAUGHING, debating, as Matt accepts a 
      victory beer from Lindsay. Off him hoisting it high-

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. MIDLAND HOME - EVENING

      It s a party in full swing. Family, friends, the odd party 
      hat. 

      Matt mans the keg, refilling his own glass between pours for 
      others. 

      Yes, there s actually a moonbounce, with kids of various ages 
      jumping and flopping with glee.

      Steph and Lindsay chat up a group of their girlfriends. 
      Lindsay looks over and winks at-

      Bob, at the center of it all, lording over a grill and 
      perfectly tamed lawn, a man in the midst of suburban ecstacy. 

      He distributes meat fresh from the fire to people as they 
      step near.

      Lindsay s PARENTS (CAROL and ED), salt of the Earth types 
      with warm grins, each hold out a bun for Bob to fill.

                                  ED
                          (re: the burgers)
                    Lookin  good, Robert.

                                  BOB
                    I can t do  em half as good as you 
                    Ed. Just trying not to set myself 
                    on fire back here.                                                                                    40.


      Ed LAUGHS as Bob serves him up.

                                  CAROL
                    Looks like you re still taking good 
                    care of our little girl.

                                  BOB
                    I try, but somehow Lindsay always 
                    ends up taking care of me.

                                  CAROL
                    Now I know that s not true. 
                    Frankly, you re taking care of all 
                    of us.

                                  ED
                    Yes, indeed. We got our latest 
                      statements. Looks like things are 
                    going great with the wells.

      And like that we see the first dent in Bob s perfect mood.

                                  BOB
                    Uh, yeah. Just plugging away.

                                  ED
                    We just feel so fortunate to have 
                    been able to get in on the ground 
                    floor of such an opportunity. Our 
                    friends too. We all call each other 
                    every time we get our new balances.

                                  CAROL
                    You ve made Ed the most popular guy 
                    at the Lodge.

      Now it just plain stings. Bob s looking for an exit.

                                  BOB
                    You know what, I m just going to 
                    grab a beer.

                                  ED
                    All right, son. Enjoy.

      Bob steps away and quickly heads for the beer line. He stares 
      blankly into space.

                                  MATT
                    Beer, Chief?

      Startled, Bob looks up. Matt holds out a beer.

                                  MATT (CONT D)
                    For the man of the hour. Where 
                    would we be without him?

      Bob takes the beer.                                                                                    41.


      EXT. MIDLAND HOME - BACKYARD - NIGHT

      It s late, things have started to wind down. Matt and Bob sit 
      at a table watching Lindsay and Steph still dancing.

      As the song ends the girls head for the keg. Steph pours, 
      hands one to Lindsay.

                                  STEPH
                    One more song and then we hit the 
                      moonbounce.

      Lindsay LAUGHS, then casually hands the beer back.

                                    LINDSAY
                    Actually, I m just going to stick 
                    with water.

                                  STEPH
                    Come on. What kind of person throws 
                    a bash in their own backyard and 
                    then spends the whole time drinking-

      And then Steph gets it.

                                  STEPH (CONT'D)
                    No WAY!

      Lindsay tries to keep a lid on it, but can t help but smile.

                                    LINDSAY
                    Shhh. It s very, very, very early. 
                    You can t say anything. I haven t 
                    even told Robert.

      Steph gives her a giant hug.

                                  STEPH
                      Congratulations! Oh my God, this 
                    makes me want to go sleep with my 
                    husband.

      Lindsay LAUGHS.

                                  STEPH (CONT D)
                    When are you going to tell him?

                                    LINDSAY
                    I don t know. I want to wait a 
                    little, make sure it s for real.

      Steph can t contain herself. She starts jumping up and down.

      ANGLE ON Matt and Bob as they watch the girls jumping and 
      SCREECHING before running to the moonbounce.

                                  MATT
                    I swear, those girls bring out the 
                    crazy in each other.                                                                                    42.


      He finishes his beer. Both he and Bob seem distant, 
      contemplative.

                                  MATT (CONT D)
                    Good party, man. Almost makes this 
                    place bearable.

      Bob doesn t say anything. He s just watching Lindsay and 
      Steph jumping and LAUGHING.

                                  MATT (CONT D)
                    Gonna start looking for work in Ft. 
                    Worth, maybe Dallas, see if we 
                    can t finally move on, move up for 
                    once.

      Bob sips his beer.

                                  BOB
                    Moving up s not all it s made out 
                    to be. There s something to be said 
                    for being right here.

                                  MATT
                    Shoot man, this place is like being 
                    on an island. You get stuck here, 
                    you never get out.

                                  BOB
                    Yeah, but the bad stuff doesn t get 
                    in. Keeps this place the way it 
                    used to be. The way it should be. 
                    Just simple. Real. I wish I d grown 
                    up in a place like this.

                                  MATT
                    Where did you grow up?

      Bob looks up at the stars. He takes a long beat.

                                  BOB
                    Doesn t matter now. The point is, 
                    you re lucky to live here, Matt. 
                    You shouldn t forget that.

      Matt takes that in. He grabs a random beer glass from the 
      table.

                                  MATT
                    Well, if I m lucky, then you are 
                    too, right?

      Matt raises his glass.

                                  MATT (CONT D)
                    To being lucky.

      Bob hesitates, then-

                                  BOB
                    To being lucky.                                                                                    43.


      Bob taps his glass. They both drink. 

      EXT. MIDLAND HOME - BACKYARD - LATER

      Everyone is gone. Bob cleans in the backyard. Through the 
      window he can see Lindsay doing dishes. He stops, watches.

      EXT. MIDLAND HOME - DRIVEWAY

      Bob walks to his car, opens the passenger side. Inside, on 
      top of his briefcase full of  money , is the Tiffany s bag. 

      As he reaches for it, his Iphone rings.

                                  BOB
                    Hello.

                                  JOHN
                          (filter)
                    Where are you?

                                  BOB
                    Midland, I told you.

                                  JOHN
                    Get out.

                                  BOB
                    What?

                                  JOHN
                    Get out. Now.

                                  BOB
                    Dad, I m right in the middle of-

                                  JOHN
                    My contact at the commissioner s 
                    office just tipped me off. Lawyer 
                    in Midland is requesting the deed 
                    on the well for one of your 
                      investors. Soon as he finds out you 
                    don t own a damn thing that whole 
                    town is going to be looking to set 
                    you on fire. You need to be long 
                    gone.

                                  BOB
                    But-

                                  JOHN
                    Bob! Do you want to go to jail? 
                    CLEAR OUT! NOW!

      Click. Bob looks down at his phone. Looks at the Tiffany s 
      bag in his hand. A long beat. He puts the bag back in the 
      car, closes the door.

      INT. MIDLAND HOME - KITCHEN

      Bob steps in just Lindsay is heading out.                                                                                    44.


                                    LINDSAY
                    Perfect timing. I m beat. Let s do 
                    the rest tomorrow.

      He nods.

      INT. MIDLAND HOME - BEDROOM

      Bob lays in bed wide awake, Lindsay draped over him, sound 
      asleep. He looks destroyed.

      A long beat as he wrestles with something. Then-

      He slowly lifts her arm, slips out from under her. He stands, 
      walks to the doorway, then pauses to watch her sleep. Then-

                                                                SERIES OF SHOTS:

      CLOSE ON THE MONKEY KEYCHAIN as one of the keys starts the 
      Honda.

      BOB BACKS out, stares at the house, the yard, the world. He 
      puts the car in gear.

      BOB DRIVES across the vast, empty, midnight Texas landscape. 

      BOB PASSES creaking pumpjacks as they pull oil from beneath.

      A SMALL TOWN. Bob sits at the single stoplight longer than 
      required, truly lost in his thoughts.

      EXT. GAS STATION - LATE NIGHT

      Bob leaves his car pumping, heads in.

      INT. GAS STATION

      A KID in uniform works the counter. Bob wanders the aisles. 
      He stops, eyes a postcard: SOMEONE IN TEXAS LOVES ME.

      The door BEEPS as a scruffy man (DAD) steps in. His voice, 
      gait, and the fact that his truck is parked sideways outside 
      indicate he s been drinking.

      To the kid behind the counter-

                                  DAD
                    Well, well, well. 

      The kid seems embarrassed. The dad steps over, paws at the 
      uniform.

                                  DAD (CONT'D)
                    Your mom said you got a job. 

      The dad starts to move down the aisles. Bob makes eye contact 
      with the kid, then looks back at the postcards.

      As the dad moves along the aisles to the coolers in the back, 
      opens the one full of beer-                                                                                    45.


                                  DAD (CONT'D)
                    They give you any time off? Maybe 
                    you want to come by, hang out. 

      The kid stays quiet. The dad starts back toward the counter, 
      puts down a pack of gum.

                                  DAD (CONT'D)
                    Just this for tonight.

      From Bob s angle, he can see the dad s pockets are stuffed 
      with beer cans, jerky, etc.

      The kid hesitates.

                                  KID
                          (quiet)
                    Dad, I can t.

      The dad looks around, briefly makes eye contact with Bob, 
      then looks back at the kid.

                                  DAD
                    He don t care.

                                  KID
                    No... there s cameras. I ll get 
                    fired-

      The dad SLAPS the counter.

                                  DAD
                    Just this.

      A beat. The kid rings it up. The dad gives him a dollar. As 
      he goes-

                                  DAD (CONT'D)
                    That s my boy.

      The kid looks frustrated. When he turns, Bob s at the 
      counter, a single postcard in front of him.  

      A glance between them. The kid rings it up.

                                  KID
                    Forty cents.

      Bob puts down a twenty.

                                  BOB
                    For me and the last guy.

      The kid looks at him. Really?

      As Bob goes - 

                                  BOB (CONT'D)
                    I know what it s like.                                                                                    46.


      INT. BOB S CAR

      Bob gets in. He sees the Tiffany s bag on top of the 
      briefcase in the passenger seat, waiting for him. He takes 
      it, looks inside. 

      Something deep inside him breaks, and for the first time his 
      armor fails. All the things he s been able to hide under 
      layers of flash and fiction come spilling out in tears.

      He looks at the organizer on the seat beside him - the two 
      cell phones on either side.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. GAS STATION

      Bob, eyes still moist, walks toward a trash bin. He raises 
      the Tiffany s bag, ready to toss it in. At the last second he 
      hesitates.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. GAS STATION

      Bob steps back inside, once again the cool, collected man 
      we ve come to know. He goes straight to the kid, puts the 
      Tiffany s bag on the counter. 

      The kid looks at him.

                                  BOB
                    I d open it away from the cameras.

      Bob walks out.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. RENTAL CAR

      Close on Bob as he drives across the darkened landscape, his 
      decision made, his eyes steely and fixed on the road ahead.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. GAS STATION

      The kid slips behind a wall with the Tiffany s bag. He double 
      checks he s out of camera sight, then reaches in.

      He pulls out a wad of hundreds. He looks around, unsure, then 
      pockets them.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. GAS STATION

      CLOSE ON the trash bin where Bob was about to throw away the 
      Tiffany s bag. We peer inside and among the garbage and 
      things left for dead, see -                                                                                     47.


      The briefcase, spewing stacks of paper, the real money gone. 
      And-

      His NOKIA CELL PHONE.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. RENTAL CAR

      As Bob drives we pan over to the passenger seat. There s only 
      one phone in the organizer now. His IPHONE. 

      On top of it is the diamond necklace.


                                    END OF ACT IV                                                                                    48.


                                        ACT V

      INT. THATCHER OIL - CONFERENCE ROOM

      Clint walks Bob in to reveal a table covered with stacks upon 
      stacks of folders, binders, maps, papers. He offers a seat.

                                  CLINT
                    Prepared a little welcome buffet 
                    for you.

      Bob, a little lost, takes a seat. Clint pulls a binder at 
      random, opens it in front of Bob.

                                  CLINT (CONT D)
                    These are all the deals we ve made, 
                    not made, and been offered in the 
                    last five years. I want you to have 
                    a sense of the kind of things we ve 
                    been pursuing as well as the ones 
                    we ve been avoiding.

      Bob looks down at the pages. He seems uncertain.

                                  CLINT (CONT D)
                    Don t worry. Once you re up to 
                    speed, I plan to turn you loose. 
                    You ll be a like a company within 
                    the company, and hopefully you ll 
                    be as profitable with us as you 
                    have been on your own. Just want 
                    you to know what we re doing as a 
                    whole before you run off and start 
                    printing us money.

      He pats Bob on the shoulder. Bob looks up, smiles.

      As Clint goes -

                                  CLINT (CONT D)
                    You need anything?

      Bob eyes the mountain of paper before him.

                                  BOB
                    Yeah. Have someone bring me all the 
                    coffee in the building.

      Clint LAUGHS as he walks out.

      Alone, Bob looks at the binder before him. At first it seems 
      like another language. But as he flips pages, looks at 
      charts, statements, etc, recognition dawns on his face.

      INT. THATCHER OIL - CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

      Bob s now deep into the work, a huge stack of items moved off 
      the table into a done pile. 

      He sips coffee and cracks a new folder.                                                                                    49.


      Bob looks up to see Trammell at the window, watching him. Bob 
      gives a wave. Trammell just moves on.

      INT. TRAMMELL S OFFICE 

      Trammell comes in, takes a seat at his desk. He thinks for 
      beat, then calls something up on his computer. 

      He dials his phone.

                                  TRAMMELL
                    Hey. Trammell Thatcher. Yeah. Good. 
                    Listen I m calling to see what you 
                    know about Bob Taylor.
                          (beat)
                    Bob Taylor. Stays with you guys 
                    maybe once a week. I just want to 
                    know what you make of the guy, you 
                    know, personally.
                          (beat)
                    He s been coming there for almost a 
                    year. Christ, I ve seen the shampoo 
                    bottles at his house.
                          (beat)
                    You re sure? 
                          (beat)
                    Well double check and get back to 
                    me.

      Trammell hangs up, confused.

      INT. DREW S OFFICE

      Drew is at his desk reading the sports section. The bottle of 
      hangover soda is off to one side.

      Bob walks in with one of the binders

                                  BOB
                    Hey, Drew.

      Startled, Drew drops the paper, sits up.

                                  DREW
                    Bob. Hey. I was just... what s up?

      Bob puts the binder on Drew s desk, takes a seat.

                                  BOB
                    Going through all the deal 
                      proposals. Found this thing you 
                    brought in a few years back. The 
                    wind farm deal?

                                  DREW
                    Oh, yeah. Tram shot that down.

                                  BOB
                    Why?

      Drew shrugs.                                                                                    50.


                                  DREW
                    I don t know. He said we re in the 
                    oil business, not the wind 
                    business.

      Bob gets up, comes around the desk to Drew s side and opens 
      the binder. He points to some of the charts.

                                  BOB
                    Well, maybe we ought to get into 
                    the wind business. If I m reading 
                    this right, that looks likes a 
                    pretty good return. Are these 
                    numbers right?

      Drew looks at the chart.

                                  DREW
                    Um, yeah. I think so. Or, you know, 
                    they were.

                                  BOB
                    And we d need what, a couple 
                    hundred acres for this test farm?

      It s coming back to him now.

                                  DREW
                    Right. Right. And I m pretty sure 
                    it s still available. There was a 
                    guy looking to go after it but he 
                    got hammered in the crash. I could 
                    do some checking, make sure it s 
                    still for sale.

      Bob gives it some thought.

                                  BOB
                    Why don t you do that. I think this 
                    is a good play.

                                  DREW
                    Are you serious?

      Bob seems to be asking himself that same question.

                                  BOB
                    Yes. I think it s time try a new 
                      direction.

      Drew suddenly seems unsure.

                                  DREW
                    That s great. I just... you re sure 
                    you want me on this?

                                  BOB
                    It s your deal. Don t you want in?                                                                                    51.


                                  DREW
                    Sure. This is just where I usually 
                    get asked to sit out. 

                                  BOB
                    Drew, underestimating you has been 
                    one of this company s biggest 
                    mistakes. If you re willing to 
                    work, to listen, and to help me, I 
                    can assure you, it s one I will 
                    never make. In or out, that s your 
                    call. All I m saying is there s no 
                    one I d rather have.  

      Drew looks like he s just heard a great half time speech and 
      can t wait to hit the field. He stands, extends his hand.

                                  DREW
                    Well, okay.

      They shake. Bob s genuinely excited too. They re both turning 
      over a new leaf. As he leaves-

                                  BOB
                    I ve got to get to a meeting. We ll 
                    talk later.

      Drew sits, pauses for a second basking in newfound utility. 
      He picks up his phone, starts dialing. 

      He spots the hangover soda on his desk, pitches it, and turns 
      on his TV, starts changing the channels. 

                                  DREW
                          (into phone)
                    Hey. Drew Thatcher calling for Bill 
                    Adelman. Sure.

      As he waits he finally finds CNBC. He puzzles at it for a 
      moment, knowing he should be interested. But he s not.

      He switches to ESPN. A man can only change so much in one 
      day.

      INT. DINER - AFTERNOON

      John sits in a booth eating. Suddenly, Bob slides into the 
      seat across from him. 

                                  JOHN
                    Hey. Sorry, couldn t wait. Get the 
                    pancakes.

      John raises his hand towards the waitress.

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    Some more pancakes over here?

                                  BOB
                    I don t want any pancakes.                                                                                    52.


      John shrugs.

                                  JOHN
                    Too late. 

      A long beat. Bob s gearing up for something. John ends up 
      going first.

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    So there s ten different ways to 
                    play this, but there s probably 
                    only one way to get it right. I ve 
                    been thinking-

                                  BOB
                    I m not working an angle.

      John takes a bite of pancake.

                                  JOHN
                    What do you mean?

                                  BOB
                    I m not doing this anymore. I don t 
                    ever want a situation like Midland 
                    again.

                                  JOHN
                    What was the situation in Midland 
                    exactly, Bob? Was there a girl 
                    there too?

      Bob doesn t respond.

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    Well, whose fault is that, son? 
                    What have I taught you? You play 
                    any character you want, but you 
                    never play yourself. That s what 
                    lets you walk when the time comes. 
                    That s the discipline. To look 
                    someone in the eye, to sound 
                      completely sincere, and mean the 
                    exact opposite of what you re 
                    saying. Now, if you forgot all that 
                    for a moment, and it ended up 
                    hurting, then I m sorry. But that s 
                    why we follow the rules. And I m 
                    guessing that s why you won t make 
                    that mistake again.

      The waitress drops a plate of pancakes in front of Bob. He 
      ignores them.

                                  BOB
                    You don t understand. I can do 
                    this. I ve spent so long faking 
                    these things I actually know how to 
                    read them, how to figure out what s 
                    a good deal and what s bad.                                                                                    53.


                                  JOHN
                    The only good deal is one where you 
                    see the exit as you re walking in.

                                  BOB
                    We can build something real here, 
                    Dad. We don t have to make it up 
                    anymore. There s plenty of money to 
                    go around. You could come live with 
                    me. I could put you on staff, pay 
                    you really well to consult.

      John SLAPS the table.

                                  JOHN
                    I didn t spend my whole life 
                    hunting an elephant so I could get 
                    a job! This is about moving to an 
                    island full of topless women, not 
                    dragging my ass to some stupid 
                    office everyday. Now get your mind 
                    right, and let s focus on how to do 
                    this.

      A long beat.

                                  BOB
                    What do you need? What do you want? 
                      A million? Two? Ten? I ll get you 
                    the money. I ll write you a check. 
                    Just don t make me do this again.

      And now the son is offering the father money. John s whole 
      demeanor changes as he takes this in. He s pained, but for 
      all the wrong reasons. 

      A long beat. He looks Bob right in the eye, sounds completely 
      sincere.

                                  JOHN
                    This is really that important to 
                    you?

                                  BOB
                    I don t want to live like this 
                    anymore. I want something real.

      John takes this in, nods.

                                  JOHN
                    All right, son, we ll try it your 
                    way.

      Bob is flooded with relief. He leaps up, crosses the table 
      and hugs John.

                                  BOB
                    Thank you, Dad. Thank you. You re 
                    gonna  see. It s going to work. 
                    It s going to be great.

      Pushing him off-                                                                                    54.


                                  JOHN
                    All right, all right. Calm down.

      Bob stands, composes himself. 

                                  BOB
                    I ll call you later, okay.

                                  JOHN
                    Sure.

                                  BOB
                    Dad?

                                  JOHN
                    Yeah.

                                  BOB
                    I love you.

      John nods. Bob goes. John watches him leave, a saddened look 
      on his face. As he turns back to the table-

                                  JOHN
                    How many times have I told him? 
                    They start offering you money, 
                    they re yours.

      Johns stabs the untouched pancakes left on Bob s plate and 
      pulls them across to his own. He starts to eat.


                                    END OF ACT V                                                                                    55.


                                        ACT VI

      INT. THATCHER OIL - ATRIUM - EVENING

      An office party. Bob is clearly the guest of honor, Cat by 
      his side, beaming. 

      Trammell is nowhere to be seen. Drew however, is riding 
      shotgun as Clint introduces Bob to guests. 

                                  CLINT
                    This guy does it like we used to. 
                    Finds money with his nose, not a 
                    degree.

      Bob gladhands. 

      Clint spots a REPORTER (CLIFF) he s been looking for, calls 
      him over.

                                  CLINT (CONT D)
                    Ah, Bob, this is Cliff from the 
                      Chronicle. Covers oil and gas. 

      Bob shakes Cliff s hand.

                                  CLIFF
                    Actually, this is perfect. You guys 
                    mind holding for a photo?

      Suddenly a PHOTOGRAPHER steps in behind Cliff. Bob never 
      betrays a thing, but it s crystal clear that the last thing 
      he wants is his picture in the paper.

                                  BOB
                    You know what, why don t you take 
                    it without me. I see someone I need 
                    to talk to. Excuse me.

      He slips out. Clint looks briefly confused, then smiles for 
      the camera.

      INT. THATCHER OIL - ATRIUM - MOMENTS LATER

      Grace sits by herself. Bob swoops in next to her.

                                  BOB
                    Hey.

                                  GRACE
                    Looks like you fit right in out 
                    there.

      It s obvious she doesn t mean it as a compliment.

                                  BOB
                    I m doing my best.

                                  GRACE
                    That s what I m afraid of.                                                                                    56.


                                  BOB
                    What s the matter? You should be 
                    excited.

                                  GRACE
                    Are you kidding? I feel like I m at 
                    your funeral.

                                  BOB
                    Mine?

                                  GRACE
                    These people freeze you out for 
                    years, and now you re out there 
                    slapping backs and shaking hands 
                    with them. It s hard to watch. It s 
                    like you re turning into one of 
                    them.

                                  BOB
                    No, no, no. Trust me, this is going 
                    to free me up to be myself so much 
                    more you should be worrying about 
                    these people turning into me, not 
                    the other way around. Six months 
                    from now I bet they ve ditched the 
                    country club scene completely. 
                    We ll all just be hanging out in 
                    your room playing Xbox.

      She looks at him, skeptical.

      Clint appears.

                                  CLINT
                    Bob. Got something I want to show 
                    you.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. THATCHER OIL - CORNER OFFICE

      Clint walks Bob into a stunning office, views of downtown and 
      beyond twinkling through the windows.

                                  CLINT
                    Welcome home.

      Bob looks the place over, genuinely impressed. He can t 
      suppress his smile.

                                  BOB
                    I suppose this will do.

      Clint LAUGHS. 

      When Bob looks up, he sees Trammell and Cat have appeared in 
      the doorway behind Clint.                                                                                    57.


                                  TRAMMELL
                    It s an older building, so the 
                    windows still open. In case you 
                    ever feel the need to jump.

      Trammell smiles, but his distaste is thinly veiled.

                                  TRAMMELL (CONT D)
                    Speaking of rooms, I was actually 
                    talking to our pal Ken Winter at 
                    the Worthington today, you know, 
                    telling him about your promotion. 
                    You know, Ken, right?

                                  BOB
                    Not well, no.

                                  TRAMMELL
                    That s strange. He didn t seem to 
                    know you much either. Or at all. 
                    Seems like you ve spent at least a 
                    couple days a week at his hotel for 
                    the last year, but, he didn t seem 
                    to have any record of you.

      This is odd enough that Clint and Cat s faces suddenly 
      require an answer.

      Bob doesn t miss a beat.

                                  BOB
                    Actually, I ve never stayed at the 
                      Worthington, Tram.

      This doesn t quite fit for Cat.

                                  CAT
                    But... you ve got mountains of 
                    their stuff. 

      Bob SIGHS.

                                  BOB
                    Buy it bulk, just like they do. 
                    This is embarrassing. Truth is, I 
                    stay in motels when I travel. 
                    Cheap, clean, lets me get my work 
                    done. I just know how... 
                      appearances tend to matter around 
                    here and I didn t want you having 
                    to explain why your husband was 
                    crashing in Motel 6 s.

      Clint LAUGHS.

                                  CLINT
                    See, Tram, not everybody needs a 
                    mint on their pillow and a kiss 
                    goodnight to get things done. Bob, 
                    you keep doing what you re doing, 
                    you can stay whereever the hell you 
                    want.                                                                                      58.


      He turns for the door.

                                  CLINT (CONT D)
                    We ll leave you guys to admire the 
                    view.

      He motions for Trammell to leave with him. Trammell s not yet 
      buying all of it. As he goes-

                                  TRAMMELL
                    Well, welcome. If you have any 
                    problems, finding the bathroom, 
                    kitchen, or you know, remembering 
                    what hotel you re in, my office is 
                    right next door.

      Trammell s smile could cut through metal.

      Once they go, Cat takes a few steps in. She s radiant.

                                  CAT
                    Can you believe it? It s like we 
                    always talked about.

      She looks out the window, then turns.

                                  CAT (CONT'D)
                    We should think about the next 
                    move. What kind of deals you want 
                    to do. You could even partner up 
                    with some-

      She notices he s just staring, awestruck.

                                  CAT (CONT'D)
                    What?

      He steps close to her.

                                  BOB
                    You re amazing.

      He reaches into his pocket, pulls out the Tiffany s diamond 
      necklace.

                                  BOB (CONT D)
                    You believed there was something 
                    better in me before I even believed 
                    it myself. I don t know if I can 
                    tell you what that means to me.

      She looks at it, stunned.

                                  CAT
                    Bob, it s incredible.

      She turns. He puts it on. She models it.

                                  BOB
                    Perfect.                                                                                    59.


      They kiss. And then they fall towards his new couch.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. THATCHER OIL - BOB S CORNER OFFICE - LATER

      Bob and Cat lie wrapped around one another in post coital 
      bliss. She slips on his shirt, begins to move around the 
      office, touching the furniture, taking in the view. 

      As she stares at the city.

                                  CAT
                    I knew you d get here.

      She returns to him, slips into his arms.

                                  BOB
                    Well, you were certainly in the 
                    minority.  

                                  CAT
                    Because everyone else saw you for 
                    what you were. I ve always seen 
                    what you could be. 

      Bob downplays, but he s clearly moved. 

                                  BOB
                    I took some risks. I got lucky. 
                    That s all.

                                  CAT
                    No. You make your own luck. That s 
                    why I married you. 

      She squeezes in, closes her eyes. Bob wraps himself around 
      her, wide awake, staring at the ceiling.

                                  BOB
                          (whispers)
                    I love you.

      She smiles and he turns his head, finds himself staring at 
      the necklace as it sparkles in the dim light.

      Off the necklace-

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. TIFFANY S - MORNING

      Bob is waiting again as the clerk opens the door.

                                  CLERK
                    Back so soon?                                                                                    60.


                                  BOB
                    It s been a particularly good week.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. AIRPORT

      Again, we re following that giant suitcase as Bob hauls it 
      through the airport, hands it to the agent with a smile.

      But this time, as Bob walks on, we stay with the case.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. BOB S CORNER OFFICE - DAY

      Bob looks over a map of Midland. He draws a circle around 
      something.

      INT. CONVEYER BELT

      We see the case weaving it s way through the bowels of the 
      airport.

      We hear John s voice-

                                  JOHN (V.O.)
                    You did what!

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. DREW S OFFICE

      Bob takes just a couple steps in.

                                  BOB
                    I m going to go ahead and purchase 
                    another little tract of land to go 
                    with that windfarm deal. Place I ve 
                    just got a feeling about. It s only 
                    another million.

      Drew shurgs.

                                  DREW
                    Sure, Bob. Whatever you think.

      INT. AIRPLANE

      We see the suitcase, one among many as the plane takes off.

                                  BOB (V.O.)
                    It s fine. This way, when they pull 
                    the deed I ll actually own it.

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    61.


      INT. BOB S CORNER OFFICE

      Bob sits behind his desk.

      We see him write a check on Thatcher paper for 1,000,000.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. TAXI

      We see the suitcase as it s tossed into the trunk of a taxi.

                                  JOHN (V.O.)
                    Why in the hell would you want to 
                    do that? We were out of there. It 
                    was clean. Owning the land is worse 
                    than not owning it! Now you re 
                    going to give them a trail!

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. HOTEL  

      The suitcase is loaded onto a luggage trolly.

                                  BOB (V.O.)
                    Well, then I won t give them a 
                    reason to feel like they have to 
                    come after us.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. HOTEL ROOM

      The suitcase is delivered to a room. We hear John s voice 
      over the phone-

                          (filter)
                    How? Are you planning to actually 
                    pay them what you owe?

      NEW ANGLE as we see a close up of Bob on his Iphone.

                                  BOB
                    Maybe?

                    That s insane! You re stealing from 
                    your  real  job to pay debts from 
                    your imaginary one?

                                  BOB
                    I ll figure out a way to make it 
                    work.

                                  JOHN
                    Why? Why would you do this?                                                                                    62.


      We come around until we can suddenly see out the hotel s 
      window, and beyond the pane are the unmistakable lights of 
      LAS VEGAS.

                                  BOB
                    Because I m in love, Dad.

                                  JOHN
                    In love! With who, Bob? Your 
                    imaginary wife, or your imaginary 
                      girlfriend?

      We pull back now, revealing that Bob is standing there in a 
      FULL TUX. He stares at his reflection in a mirror for a 
      moment. 

                                  BOB
                    Both.

                                  JOHN
                    BOB!

      Click. Bob hangs up just as we hear the bathroom door 
      OPENING.

      Suddenly we spin around just in time to see Lindsay step out 
      looking stunning in a full wedding dress.

      When she sees Bob she recoils.

                                    LINDSAY
                    What are you doing? It s bad luck 
                    to see the bride before the 
                    wedding.

      Bob goes to her, pulls her close.

                                  BOB
                    I make my own luck.

      CLOSE ON his giant suitcase as we see him snatch up a small 
      Tiffany s ring box.

      He takes her hand, and together, they head out. 

      As they go, we turn back to the suitcase and push in until it 
      fills the frame. 

      Suddenly, we re right back where we started:

      Staring at Bob s giant suitcase, and the array of different 
      clothes he keeps inside.

                                                                          FADE OUT.*
