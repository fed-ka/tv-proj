Alone by the window, he gazes at the city. A powerfully
built man in a perfectly-tailored suit. The face at once
strong and elegant, capable of every emotion. Yet just now,
there are none to be seen. Even as...
...a door OPENS. A pretty SECRETARY enters soundlessly, sits
respectfully. Waits, her pen suspended above her steno pad.
Does he know she's there?
SUPERIMPOSE:
NEW YORK, LATER 1937.
GEORGE
(without turning)
The first time I met her she sat
in that chair.
The secretary doesn't know whether to write that down.
And
still with his back to her...
GEORGE (CONT'D)
You may as well write it down,
Mary. Write it all down. Even the
parts that are confused or
graceless or boring.
He turns with a soft smile to put her at ease.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
We'll see if I remember how to
edit.
She smiles back. She likes him, as much as her level of
being awed by him permits. She begins to write, as...

GEORGE (CONT'D)
I'd kept her waiting two hours.

She hated me on sight, but she
hought I couldn't tell.
His gaze drifts to a bookcase crammed with volumes. And one
object, oddly out of place. A stuffed CAT, with boots and a
green frock coat. It wears a confident ironic smile.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
She was a person who cherished her
privacy and was devoting her life
to social work. And there I was...
His smile is kind.
And honestly self-mocking.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
Self-obsessed. Wallowing in the
glory of my authors and celebrity
acquaintances. A vain, fast-
talking, manipulator. But then I
guess you know all that, don't you?
She looks up reproachfully.
Nothing of the kind, and you
know it.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
Oh, yes. And the kind of man who
fishes for compliments.
He's made her laugh.
DISSOLVE TO...

She is younger, dressed conservatively. The calm at the
center of a storm. Agents, authors, couriers, peddlers come
and go. But she has her legs drawn up beneath her, pouring
through a small stack of volumes. As if preparing for an
exam.
SUPERIMPOSE:
G.P. PUTNAM'S SONS PUBLISHING CO. 1928.
GEORGE (V.O.)
The waiting made her furious.
She undoubtedly felt I was
E
stablishing my dominance and
importance.
She doesn't look furious at all. Thumbing through WE by COL.
CHARLES LINDBERGH. Photos of Lindy beside the Spirit of St.
Louis in Paris.

GEORGE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Actually, I hadn't given her a
thought. Oblivious as usual.
Which, perhaps, was even worse.
Now, SKYWARD by ADM. RICHARD BYRD. Photos of the explorer
preparing for his flight over the North Pole. One of Byrd
with George himself, displaying considerable gravitas.
AMELIA (V.O.)
I figured he'd be pompous.
Her eye travels over the stack of books. Adventurers,
explorers, celebrities. On an end table, a framed photo of
George with the great Lindbergh.
A pretty SECRETARY comes to summon her. Amelia rises,
smooths the wrinkles from her brown suit. They head down
the corridor.
AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I knew, of course, that he wasn't
going to choose me. I had no
discernible qualifications
whatsoever.
They reach the door, already ajar. It says GEORGE PALMER
PUTNAM on a small bronze plate. The secretary gingerly
pushes it open...
...revealing George on the phone in crisp shirtsleeves and
suspenders. He paces, prowls, trailing the cord behind him,
negotiating non-stop even as he flips through a pile of
messages. Off again, stalking the room. Dashing, electric,
masterful.
AMELIA (V.O)
But to be rejected by this...
parasite. A man who had given up
any life of his own to flutter near
the famous.
He glances up, realizing for the first time that she is
there. Sit, please. But she doesn't.
AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I didn't know whether to laugh or
throw something at the jerk.
He gestures again, more commandingly. Sit. She doesn't
move, she doesn't smile. She doesn't take her steady gaze
from him. He hangs up the phone.
They stare at each other for a frozen beat.
He breaks the
moment with a charming smile...
5.
GEORGE
Miss Earhart?
AMELIA
Mr. Putnam?
GEORGE (softly)
I asked you to sit.
AMELIA
Was that the thing you did with
your hand? Sadly, I don't speak
dog.
His smile now only a trace.
But more genuine.
GEORGE
A
Ah.
Well, stand if you like.
melia sits.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
I'm told you want to fly the
Atlantic Ocean.
AMELIA
I do.
GEORGE
In the 12 months since Lindbergh,
55 people in 18 planes have tried.
Three planes made it. Fourteen
people have died.
AMELIA
I'll make it.
GEORGE
Three women died trying. Two
others escaped with their lives.
If you do make it, you'd be the
first. Which...is the real
attraction for both of us, I
suspect.
She nods.
No smile.
AMELIA
Always nice to know what the real
attraction is.
His smile.
Beginning to enjoy this conversation.
6.
GEORGE
The plane was bought from Adm. Byrd
by Amy Guest, a socialite who
wanted the record for herself. Her
family wouldn't tolerate the
danger. She has asked for a
replacement...
He gestures.
Perhaps you.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
...who is American, educated, well-
spoken, a flyer, preferably
physically attractive...
AMELIA
Why would that matter?
GEORGE
Because she wants the world to pay
attention. And pretty girls
command more attention.
AMELIA
Was that your advice?
GEORGE
Sure. My role is selling this
event to the public. There will be
a contract for the girl's story
with the New York Times. Also a
book to be published over her name.
Understood...?
G
EORGE (CONT'D)
But all the money from these will
go to Mrs. Guest.
AMELIA
Except for the part that goes to
you.
GEORGE
Which will be as great as I can
manage, I assure you.
AMELIA
You said she wants a flyer.
GEORGE
Don't get your hopes up. The
celebrated Wilmer Stultz will be
the pilot. There'll be a male co-
pilot and navigator. The woman
will be purely a passenger.
7.
He waits for reaction.
She keeps her mouth shut.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
That's good for your chances.
Because your level of flying
experience wouldn't place you
anywhere near the group that would
be considered for this. If the
woman were to do any flying at all.
No punches pulled.
Not his style.
AMELIA
Why would anyone want a book from a
passenger?
GEORGE
Because the hook is that we're
making the woman the commander.
The pilot will sign a contract
saying he is under her direction
and control. It's her ship, her
flight.
AMELIA
Good for my chances, you said.
What are my chan...
GEORGE
The job's yours.
She blinks.
Stunned speechless.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
I chose you the moment you walked
through the door.
He smiles his charming smile.
Several phones are RINGING.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
Now assuming my awful manners
haven't soured you on the
enterprise. May I give you a lift
to the station?
Amelia rises.
Is she pissed at being toyed with?
AMELIA
You're a busy man, Mr. Putnam.
I
can find my way.
The look holds.
He shrugs.
You probably can.

Two figures on the platform.
Her train is ready to leave.
GEORGE
I honestly feel an apology is in
order.
AMELIA
Fine.
What have I done?
She watches his smile.
AMELIA (CONT'D)
I didn't mind waiting. Caught up
on my reading. Knitted a sweater.
GEORGE
I mean an apology.
For what's
coming.
His voice softens.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
I'm going to be pretty controlling
these next few months. How you
dress, move, cut your hair. Speak
in public. It's all part of the
package we're selling.
AMELIA
We.
GEORGE
That's right. If you're not in
there selling with me, it won't
work.
The smile turns friendly.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
You're the star. I'm no one at
all.
AMELIA
Spoken like a gentleman.
She steps up onto the train. Extends her hand like a man.
He shakes it firmly. The train begins to move. She watches
his cheery wave as she rolls away.
AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Of course a gentleman. Would have
paid for my ticket.

Gazing out the window as she rattles toward Boston. She
looks down now to a notebook in her lap. As she flips pages,
we see it is a collection of hand-written POEMS and thoughts.
She writes...
AMELIA (V.O.)
Courage is the price that life exacts
For granting peace
We SUPERIMPOSE over her image the wall of a little girl's
bedroom, filled with treasured NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS about
women doctors, officials, bank presidents, women who had

Feeling the freedom
she thrilled to as a A

MELIA (V.O.)
Ten years, 28 jobs and an unspeak-
able number of crashes later, I
hadn't changed my mind.
She LIFTS the nose of the tiny craft.
Begins to CLIMB.
AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I even had my own plane. Bought
with my last dime.
At the apex of her climb, she FLIPS into a breathtaking LOOP
THE LOOP, as...
AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Course in the early days of
flying...
...her engine SPUTTERS. Then STALLS.
The plane DIPS into a
TAIL-SPIN, PLUNGING downward...
AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
...crashing was so common, you
almost forgot it could kill you...
Amelia STRUGGLING to start the engine, the little plane
HURTLING toward earth, SPINNING as it goes.
AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
...until it did.
The engine COUGHS to life and at the last second she SWOOPS
harrowingly above the ground to SOAR FREE.
AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Almost.
SAM CHAPMAN, a handsome young man is being led down an
institutional hallway and out onto the grounds of this
venerable settlement house. He finds...
...Amelia sitting cross-legged on the grass. Reading to a
group of CHINESE GIRLS, who hang on her every animated word.
On the periphery, ADULTS sit, taking in the story. They are
of various ethnicities, homeless or handicapped or immigrant.

Two are blind. Amelia sees Sam...
MELIA
Girls, this is Mr. Samuel Chapman.
Sam, say hullo to the Octopus Club.
The Octopus Club waves to Sam.
The adults wave, too.

You're just in time. Alice has
come through the Looking Glass,
and things are getting, well...

She pats the grass beside her.

The Queen of Diamonds Mabel Boll,
about to become the first female to
fly the Atlantic in the wake of
Lindbergh's historic journey,
regales an eager world press...
The sound switches to Mabel at the mikes...
MABEL
Okay, boys. I'll take any
questions you wanna throw my way.
Except about what's behind this

Mabel keeps her smile tight.

he heavy door rolls OPEN. George and Amelia enter the
brightly-lit hangar to see two men working on the FRIENDSHIP,
a sea-plane with golden wings. Its red-orange fuselage
stands beside gigantic PONTOONS, each 29 feet long. The
pontoons have been opened, and the men are attaching them to
the plane.
They turn toward us now. BILL STULTZ is short and wiry with
quick eyes. Only 28, he seems weathered by his adventures
and the streaks of gray through his hair. He is not
necessarily happy to see us.
AMELIA (V.O.)
George had told me Stultz was Adm.
Byrd's favorite pilot, fearless,
gifted. He drank. But George said
it never affected his work.
George waves as we approach.
Bill and Amelia seem locked on
each other.
AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
When he said it, I must have had a
funny look. So I just said, `Yeh,
I grew up around a guy like that.'
GEORGE
Boys, I'd like to introduce your
commander, Miss Amelia Earhart.
AMELIA
We felt `commander' was less
grandiose than, say, `empress.'
Bill doesn't smile.
The other man does...
GEORGE
Say hello to Slim Gordon your
navigator.
She is shaking hands in that strong, direct way.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
And Bill Stultz here, simply the
most talented pilot working.
She takes Bill's powerful hand. The look between them calm,
yet somehow intense. As if each is establishing a tone for
their relationship.
15.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
We've got Byrd's pilot, we've got
his plane...
AMELIA
Y
ou mean the Admiral flies on
those?
The pontoons.
She does not seem admiring.
GEORGE
Nope, those are new, personally
suggested by the old man himself.
Bill nods on that.
Sure were.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
This way, if you're forced down
at sea, you can wait for a rescue.
AMELIA
Hmmn.
What does that do to our
fuel?
BILL
Costs us at least 400 gallons.
Don't bother bringing clothes for
Paris, we'll be lucky to hit the
nearest beach in Ireland. Real
lucky.
GEORGE
The Admiral estimates the pontoons
only cut our range by 200 miles.
But Amelia looks to Bill.
That's not really possible is it?
BILL
The Admiral is the Admiral. He
gets to estimate any damn thing he
wants. All we have to do is figure
out how to fly without petrol.
She turns to George with challenging eyes.
BILL (CONT'D)
Don't go blaming the bookseller.
He's been all through this with
Mrs. Guest, but she worships the
Admiral. And it's money that puts
planes in the air.
AMELIA
I wonder if it can keep them up
there. Not that I've ever had
enough to try.

Bill's small smile.
Maybe the girl's all right.

FIRST STOP: CANADA
AMELIA (V.O.)
Our first hop was to Canada, to
start from as close as we could get
to Ireland. Just in case we
couldn't get the thing in the air
and had to row.
She walks briskly down the corridor.
AMELIA (V.O.)
The fuel was going to be so close,
every single mile counted.
Turns a corner.
Approaches the dining room door.
AMELIA (V.O.)
George told me to keep to my room,
just in case there was a reporter
or two somewhere.
She enters the hotel dining room. Stops cold. Across the
room a disgruntled Bill and a sheepish Slim stare at her from
their breakfast, surrounded by 15 REPORTERS and
PHOTOGRAPHERS. Holy shit. Half a dozen CAMERAS RISE as one.
It is a defining moment. And Amelia...
Cocks her head.
Throws an effortless golden smile.

AMELIA
Hi there, boys. How are the ham
and eggs?
The FLASHES EXPLODE as one.
They keep POPPING as Amelia
makes her way to them.
BILL
Don't blame us, lady. I think
somebody's starting to sell books.
The reporters are handing her their morning editions. The
New York Times front page headline: BOSTON GIRL STARTS FOR
ATLANTIC HOP.
There beneath the headline, the glamorous PHOTO we watched
being taken on the Copley Hotel roof, Lady Lindy. Next to
it, an earlier photo of her as a demure social worker.
A
melia is sifting through the other papers, grinning and
shaking her head.
EPORTER
Say, Amelia. What have you got for
Mabel Boll to chew on?
AMELIA
Now why would a famous gal like
Mabel give a thought to someone
like me? I don't have a single
sweater made out of gold.
The boys ROAR, Slim louder than anyone. Even Bill cracks a
smile. They're shouting, teasing, YOU CAN'T KID US!
AMELIA (CONT'D)
Hey, not even silver.
The boys make room.
Bill rises to hold Amelia's chair.
A
friendly murmur...
BILL
The ham's a little tough,

Well, how would any woman feel

Reporters furiously writing, more flashes EXPLODE.
MABEL (CONT'D)

make history together, until this
poor little social worker and her
sugar daddy, oh excuse me,
`publisher,' started throwing money

Mabel, are you implying Miss

LAUGHTER, they're all calling out.
She shows them a smoky
smile, but stays on message.
MABEL (CONT'D)
Well, she had to use something on
somebody to get from nowhere to
here. You figure it out, or wait
til George Putnam feeds it to you.
Two dozen questions at once.
She's not even listening.
MABEL (CONT'D)
We're going to Canada, waiting for
some good weather on the Atlantic,
and then we'll kick Little Miss
Whoozis in the keester.
REPORTER
What makes you so cocky that she
won't leave first?

MABEL
Rusty, we can carry enough fuel to
go to China. That thing they're
flying can't load enough gas to

Amelia in her flight gear, sitting on the edge of her bed, an
open TELEGRAM lies beside her. Her elbows rest on her knees.
Her hands are locked together. Her profile is stony,
determined. TILT DOWN to the telegram...
It reads:
WEATHER PERMITTING, MABEL FLIES THIS AFTERNOON.
She grabs her flight bag, leaves the room. She only has to
travel as far as the next door. POUNDS on it. Waits.
Pounds LOUDER with both fists.
Slim opens the door.
Looking bad.
Bill sits up in bed,
groggy, disoriented.
BILL
Christ, what time is...

AMELIA
Time to fly. Get up, get dressed,
we're going now.
She is calm and angry at once.
A powerful combination.
Slim

BILL
Where's the weather report?
She goes to his bed. Hands him a slip of paper.
He blinks,
still waking up. Reads.

It's not good enough.

Great. Maybe Mabel will think so,
too. Because if she doesn't, she's
going to Paris and you're going
home. Today.
B
ILL
It's not good enough.
AMELIA
It's fine, there's a tail wind all
the way, we'll off-load to 700
gallons, which gets us off the
water and the wind gets us to
Ireland.
BILL
We've had better than this and we
haven't gone.
AMELIA
But this
is the day Mabel's ready,
so we're
going now. The weather
is going
to get better and we'll
be there
to enjoy it.
BILL
You're serious.
AMELIA
Just as serious as you're hung
over.

You go now, get the late weather,
we'll meet you at the plane.
Go. Now! Slim pulls on his shoes, grabs his jacket, his
bag. Looks to Bill, but the pilot is glaring at his
commander.

Slim, get out. I've got this.
A beat. Slim goes, the door shuts quietly.
Amelia sits on
the edge of Bill's bed.

I've loved one person
unconditionally, Bill. He is the
most caring and generous and
charming and flat-out funny guy
I'll ever know. He's my father.
Her eyes are burning with this.
And Bill keeps quiet.
Anyone would.
AMELIA (CONT'D)
He's a drunk. And he's let me down
all my life.
She leans closer.
AMELIA (CONT'D)
Now you get out of that bed. And
you fly that god-damned thing to
Ireland. Or I swear to you,
Bill...
Just above a whisper...
AMELIA (CONT'D)

And either way. You're going to be

WITH Amelia as she locks the hatch. For the first time, we
can see the inside of the plane. The cabin is too small for
anyone to stand. The plane has been emptied of everything
but two huge elliptical FUEL TANKS.
he wedges herself between the gigantic tanks. Bill pulls
the throttle and the Fokker Tri-motor LURCHES forward,
STRAINING against the surface of the sea in a rattling,
throbbing desperately VIBRATING all-out attempt.
28.
Amelia crawls to the tiny window, her face to the glass as
chop and spray FLY PAST like shrapnel, and the engines WHINE
and PULSE louder...
...twenty seconds, thirty. Still on the surface. Forty
seconds, fifty, her eyes shut, her forehead bangs against the
glass, come on, sixty seconds, and at 67...

Amelia kneels at the tiny window. A kid on a rainy day.
Only outside this window is impenetrable FOG and a STORM that
ROCKS the plane like the shock waves of endless explosions.
As she braces herself against the hull...
...water DRIPS onto her from a loose seam. Could this be
dangerous? She looks around. Through the opening between
the elliptical fuel tanks...
...Bill and Slim at the controls. Bill is banging on
something beside the instrument panel. Beneath his seat, she
sees the TOOLBOX. The water drips on her faster. She crawls
forward toward the boys, arriving to see...
...Bill POUNDING what we can now see is his RADIO.
His face
is red, angry. She watches for a beat.
AMELIA
YOU OKAY?
BILL
BE BETTER IF OUR DAMN RADIO WOULD
JOIN THE PARTY!
He never turns to her, but she studies him. Is he impaired
or simply frustrated? She slips the toolbox from beneath his
seat and crawls back to the leak. But as she opens the
box...
...there, among the wrench and pliers, a BOTTLE of whiskey.
She stares at it as we SNAP TO...

FLASHBACK:
BACK to Amelia with Bill's bottle, as the battered plane
lurches every which way in the storm. She lifts it from the
toolbox. Hides it in the camera bag, as suddenly the plane
DROPS fifty feet, and Amelia is SLAMMED against the ceiling,
then crashes back to the floor. Dazed, she sees Bill turned
around...
BILL
HOLD ONTO SOMETHING FOR CHRISSAKE!
She GRABS the leg of the navigation table which has been
bolted down. Stares out the window, wondering if she'll make
it.
AMELIA (V.O.)
Dearest Dad. Hooray for the last
grand adventure. I wish I had won,
but it was worthwhile anyway. You
know that.
I have no faith we'll
meet anywhere again, but I wish we
might.
HOLD on the gray eyes.
DISSOLVE TO...

Suddenly, the plane SWOOPS down toward a clearing in the
clouds. There to the south, a FREIGHTER running across our
path. No land in sight.

bag, and crawls back to the boys.

MAYBE AN HOUR OF PETROL LEFT.
PROBABLY LESS.
She shows him the note and the orange.
AMELIA
WESTERN UNION, SPECIAL DELIVERY.
Bill has to smile. Are you serious? As a heart attack.
Okay, he tries to get closer to the ship, but we're jerked
and buffeted as we swing past and Amelia...
...DROPS the orange toward the freighter, watching the heavy
winds CARRY it two hundred yards WIDE of the mark. Our three
stare grimly.
AMELIA (CONT'D)
IF WE LAND NEAR THEM, WE'VE GOT A
RESCUE.
Their eyes are locked.
BILL
THINK THOSE RIDICULOUS SKIS COULD
HOLD US UP IN THIS KIND OF SEA?
She's been wondering the same.
BILL (CONT'D)
YOU SAID WE WERE GOING TO MAKE IT.
ARE YOU A LIAR?
AMELIA
NOT ON THIS OCCASION.
A rare smile...
BILL
WELL, THEN.
And SWOOPS back on course.
Amelia's hand squeezes his
shoulder. DISSOLVE TO...

Something down below. As we drop, we hear the engines
A
SPUTTER.
MELIA
WHEN'S THAT HOUR OF FUEL RUN OUT?
BILL
EIGHTEEN MINUTES AGO.
WHY?
She glances over to Slim, who is busy unwrapping a sandwich.
She can't believe this. He takes a healthy bite.
AMELIA
THE LONGER I OBSERVE MEN THE MORE
I AM AWESTRUCK. BY THEIR CAPACITY
FOR DENIAL.
She crawls back to the navigation table. As she looks out
her window, a SANDWICH SAILS past! She WHIPS around...Slim's
arms raised in jubilation. Down below...

AMELIA
This flight was solely to the
credit of Bill and Slim. Women
should know, however, that I have
had 500 hours solo flying and once
held the women's altitude record.
REPORTER
So you could have done it yourself!
AMELIA
This particular flight, under these
conditions, I wonder if anyone but
Bill Stultz could have pulled it
off. But certainly, one day a
woman will do this. As easily, as
skillfully, as professionally as
any man.
Such calm self-possession.
Such confidence in that.

Mostly from women.
She looks around the
room.
AMELIA (CONT'D)
I hear your doubt. That doubt is
our challenge. This is where our
Atlantic flight, or any other good
flight by a woman can help...
She nods.
To them, to herself.
AMELIA (CONT'D)
It starts women thinking.

A women's college.
The hall is packed.
GEORGE (V.O.)
The lecture and publicity schedule
was fierce. I was with her pretty
much all the time.
Amelia and George alone in the wings.
39.
GEORGE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
This was the moment of opportunity.
Could we launch her into Lindbergh
status as a permanent icon, before
her name fell out of the news-
papers.
He re-ties her scarf.
Checking out the effect.
GEORGE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
We had separate agendas. For her,
it was the advancement of aviation
and of women.
He very slightly rearranges her hair, as if every lock
matters.
GEORGE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
As for me, I liked to tell myself
it was about the money. Though
there was never much of that left
over.
She stands for inspection, with her trace of a teasing smile.
He holds out his hand and she gives him her note cards.
GEORGE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Really, it was about the chance
to be around her.
He flips through the A
cards, frowning as he goes.
MELIA (George imitation)
This will never do, A.E., simply
unacceptable.
He looks up.
She starts pacing around, gesturing as he
would...
AMELIA (George imitation)
You need more ammunition in these
cards, and where's the goddamned
humor, for Chrissake? By which I
mean something actually funny!
He's trying to look annoyed.
It isn't easy.
AMELIA (George imitation)
And please remember not to turn
your pretty little backside to the
crowd when you use your pointer,
it's your face they're paying to
see. Well, most of them.
She WHIPS around.
He's deadpan.
40.
AMELIA (George imitation)
And another thing. Your hats.
Are a menace.
Staring at each other.
GEORGE (softly)
Everything about you. Is a menace.
The stare holds.
Because this is the moment.
AMELIA (V.O.)
I remember the first kiss.
It is only one step.
Her hand goes to his chest.
Her eyes
close, as...
She brings her mouth to his.
Tender and strong.
And deep.
It is an act of decision.
A held look. No one smiles. We hear her name ANNOUNCED from
the podium. But she keeps looking at him. And as the
APPLAUSE CONTINUES, she finally...
...turns. STRIDES onto the stage, with one graceful wave,
she brings the applause to a crescendo.
AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Of course, I knew all the stories
T
hat Dorothy had been having a
torrid affair with Fred Upton.
Everyone did.
She steps to the microphone.
The crowd quiets.
AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
But I didn't kiss him because I
felt sorry for him. Or because
it would mean the world to him.
INTERCUT.
George in the wings.
His heart in his eyes.
AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I did it.
Because I wanted to.
He looks down.
He's still holding her cards.

Hotel corridor. An elevator OPENS and ELINOR SMITH a
striking young woman emerges. Looks at a slip of paper.
Nervous. Heads down the hallway to a door. As she gathers
herself to knock, she looks scared enough to pass out.
41.
George answers the door, looking gracious and suave. They
shake hands. Then, Amelia appears, warmly clasping the
girl's hand, and Elinor looks as starstruck as a teenager at
the Oscars.
AMELIA
It's so good to meet you. I've
been following your career with
a great deal of admiration.
ELINOR
Um.
Thanks, and.
You, too.
AMELIA
Feel like a drink?
GEORGE
Amelia!
What would her mother
say?
AMELIA
Relax, George. I meant a Coke.
As she leads Elinor into the sitting room of their suite, the
girl's eye falls on the door to the bedroom. It is slightly
ajar, revealing an unmade double bed. Unseen by the others,
the kid reacts. Oh, my.
L
ATER. Tea in the sitting room.
Elinor leaning forward,
guileless, eager...
ELINOR
They're saying you get $500 a week
on the lecture circuit.
GEORGE
AMELIA
On a bad week.
On a good week.
The girl looks from one to the other.
AMELIA
All depends. On whether you want
the sell or the real.
ELINOR
Oh, I don't underestimate the value
of selling. It's why I'm here.
GEORGE
A 16-year-old girl sets an altitude
record, then makes headlines
illegally flying under the four
bridges of the East River. You
don't seem to need much help
selling yourself.
42.
ELINOR
Well, actually Mr. Putnam, I was
hoping you could do to me what
you've done to her.
Inadvertently, her eyes flick to the bedroom door. Catching
this, our couple shares a dry smile. The kid sees that. Uh-
oh.
ELINOR (CONT'D)
What I mean is. It's a good thing.
That's why I want it.
Now our couple is trying not to laugh.
GEORGE
Just so we're clear, young lady.
What is your primary ambition?
ELINOR (straight back)
To take Amelia's place as the
number one female pilot.
The honesty, the suddenness, leave George atypically
dumbstruck.
AMELIA
Well, good for you! I would have
expected nothing less. You want
a tip?
ELINOR
I do.
AMELIA
Keep doing what you're doing.
The girl nods, seriously.
Okay.

MELIA (CONT'D)
And don't let anyone turn you
around.

Holiday party in progress. Christmas decorations everywhere.
A small crowd around the living room bar where George is
telling a story.
Now we see Dorothy standing, drinking, watching George with
hard eyes. She turns on her heels and walks OUT into the
garden. George sees this, excuses himself, follows her, as
we PAN to...

She's seen it
all.

George at the kitchen table in dim light. It's very late. A
HAND places a steaming mug of coffee before him. Followed by
a slice of pie. A fork. He smiles. And softly...
GEORGE
Dorothy and I are through.
She sits beside him.
Very close.
AMELIA
For a long, long time.
GEORGE
It's different now.
She looks at him.
Squints.
How?
GEORGE (CONT'D)
Marry me.
Oh.
A breath.
AMELIA
I can't do that.
GEORGE
If you give it a chance, you'll
learn to love me.
He seems so sunny and strong.
What can he be feeling?
AMELIA
I already love you.
That's why I
can't marry you.
GEORGE (a murmur)
Well, that explains it. For a
minute there, I thought you were
stuck for an excuse.
S
he comes close enough to kiss.
AMELIA
I know me.
And you don't.
Not
really.
GEORGE
What if I promise not to learn?
45.
AMELIA
The day will come. When I will run
away. And when it does...
He stops her with a kiss.
GEORGE
If you love me. I'll take my
chances.
He stares in her troubled eyes.
There is no answer.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
Race you to bed.

The crowded waiting room. We CLOSE on a young woman we
scarcely recognize. It is Elinor. Though less than a year
has passed, she seems much older. Sophisticated, poised.
ANGLE. A secretary leads Elinor down the corridor to
George's office. As they enter, George is pacing on the
phone.
G
EORGE (into phone)
Because Amelia invented the Powder
Puff Derby for female pilots. Then
the men running the damn race
suddenly decide every woman has to
carry a male navigator, and start
from east of the Rockies so they
won't crash into the mountains!
Listens, impatient.
46.
GEORGE (into phone)
I'll tell you why it's a front page
story. Because Amelia pulled every
woman out of the race. So the
organizers had to roll over and
give in, or they'd have lost their
shirts. You want me to write your
headline?
He glances over.
Elinor in the doorway.
GEORGE (into phone)
Call you back. I've got a very
important guest.
He hangs up, gesturing graciously for her to sit.
As she
does...
ELINOR
Wish I was important enough for
you to manage.
GEORGE
Well, I've just got one client.
And most days she's more than I
can manage.
Even Elinor's smile seems older, more capable of subtlety.
ELINOR
Get in line behind the boys she
smacked around on the Derby.
He grins back.
You bet.
ELINOR (CONT'D)
Some of the gal flyers had their
doubts about her...well, her skill
level. But she's everyone's
champion now.
GEORGE
And both of those things.
Are the
S
reasons I called you.
trange words.
He has her attention.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
I think it would be huge for women
flyers if Amelia won the Derby.
The publicity would put the race,
and all of you, up there with the
boys.
47.
ELINOR
I'm not sure she has much of a
chance, Mr. Putnam.
GEORGE
Well, the one shot would be putting
her in a far more powerful plane
than anything she's flown. We're
thinking the Lockheed Vega.
The girl's shock.
He really means this.
ELINOR
Sir, I've test piloted the Vega.
It's way more than she could ever
handle. It wouldn't be safe, let
alone successful.
He smiles.
GEORGE
That's why I'm thinking of you
flying with her. You could handle
the cross-country flying, the more
difficult bits, and I'd pay you $75
a week.
Elinor WHISTLES low.
ELINOR
Well, I think that's the most
generous opportunity I've ever
been offered.
He stares at her.
GEORGE
There's just one thing. Obviously,
it has to appear that Amelia did
all the flying. So when pictures
are taken, you'll stand off to one
side.
Her eyes narrow.
He's completely serious.
ELINOR
In that case, I'll get my own plane
and win the race myself.
GEORGE
You haven't changed.
N
o smile at all.
48.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
Unfortunately for you, neither
have I.
The look in his eye is not to be ignored.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
You can't win if you can't get a
plane to enter. Let me predict
that you won't.
The voice calm and low and riveting.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
In fact. If you reject my
generosity, you may come to regret
it. For a long, long time.
ELINOR
That's a threat.
GEORGE
I'm an intensely loyal person,
Elinor. And this is what my
loyalty requires.
She's glaring.
Reeling.
Trapped.
ELINOR
She's the one who said I shouldn't
let anybody turn me around.
GEORGE
She probably meant me.
So honest, the words confuse her.
ELINOR
Obviously, she doesn't see me as
a threat.
GEORGE
Oh, sure she does.
A straight smile...
GEORGE (CONT'D)
She just doesn't care.
...which silently fades.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
My job.
Is to care for her.

PAN to find George alone, waiting. A waiter leads Amelia to
the table. George stands, smiling. But the smile is not
returned. We CLOSE as they sit...
GEORGE
A
hat's wrong?
MELIA (clearly furious)
What could be wrong? I had such a
lovely afternoon with Elinor Smith.
Oh.
GEORGE
he told you that I shut her out of
the Derby. And that's true.
AMELIA
And when were you going to tell me?
GEORGE (calm, straight)
Never. I knew you'd go crazy. And
I felt it needed to be done.
She can scarcely believe this.
AMELIA
What? You think I wanted it done,
but just let you do the dirty work?
GEORGE
I didn't say that.
AMELIA
Because I'm no angel. Business is
competition and competition is
rough, and I thank my stars that
you're there making this life
happen for me, but...
GEORGE
ou're making your life hap...

But this is different.

What's the big shock? I thought

AMELIA
You'll be destroyed. And part of

Sometimes things happen that way.
You're not better safe than sorry.
Tears stand in his eyes.
He is so happy.

Hell yes.

Through a window, a dry, wintered garden. Snow falling, at
once soft and heavy. Beyond, Morgan Point Lighthouse,
Fisher's Island Sound, Long Island Sound. One lonely fishing
boat braves the cold water. PULL BACK to see...
...Amelia at the breakfast table in a windowed room.
She is
writing, and as she does...

WEDDING DAY.
CONNECTICUT, 1931.

She brushes at them.
Stares down at her work. Continues.
ANGLE. The parlor. George, his MOTHER, the MINISTER, a
small number of close FRIENDS. From the doorway, Amelia
beckons George. The letter is in her hand.

standing silent. Two black cats rubbing against George's
ankles.

George at the breakfast table. His eggs and toast ignored
for the moment, he's reading a magazine article. PAN to
Amelia, sipping her coffee. Watching him.

`Why I Believe Women Pilots Can't
Fly The Atlantic. An outspoken
warning by Lady Heath.'

`...pure suicide for any woman
today...it is madness for them to
attempt it and...'
He looks up to her.

GEORGE (CONT'D)
`...at least the first dozen will
be drowned.' And we're reading

MELIA
I might fly to Paris.
Silence.
GEORGE
Which is actually across the
Atlantic.
AMELIA
Hence, the article.
Ah.
He nods.
AMELIA (CONT'D)
I'm thinking of doing it solo.
AMELIA (CONT'D)
Would you mind?
He butters his toast.
GEORGE
Not at all. When would you like
to go?

Amelia alone. Starry night.
12,000 feet below are ICEBERGS.
A single fishing boat.
AMELIA (V.O.)
The weather report wasn't perfect.
But we knew our real chance was to
take weather that others wouldn't.
Ahead, towering CLOUDS in moonlight.
Too high to fly over.
AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I closed the deal by choosing May
20, five years to the day from
Lindbergh's flight. It was too
good a sell for George to resist.

What we didn't know...

Amelia fights for control as the plane is TOSSED and SHAKEN.
AMELIA (V.O.)
The only way to have any sense of
altitude, was to keep dropping
toward the sea.

AMELIA(cont'd)
When the engines sputtered, that
was my low-level limit.
A sudden JOLT knocks her OUT of her seat. She scrambles
back, as we see WHITECAPS A FEW FEET BELOW. She JERKS the
nose UP, the engine COUGHS...
...and CLIMBS.
AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I was too busy to grasp how
impossible the situation had
become. The joke was...
LATER.
Flying in and out of cloud cover.
AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
All those months flying only with
instruments, I should have been
practicing without them.
PAN to the windshield. A small GLOW at the surface of a
vibrating engine. Amelia hasn't noticed.
AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I started to wonder if luck was
paying me back. For thinking I
knew the rules.
A small BLUE FLAME LICKS out into the night.
AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Then I smelled burning oil.
She sees it now. The flame coming through a broken weld in
the manifold ring.
A
MELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
A bad weld, already a small flame.
It would be hours back to Canada,
trying to find an unlit field,
landing with a heavy fuel load.
She stares at the little flame.
Is it growing bigger?
AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I told myself, push on. After all,
if it was a stupid choice...
LATER. Flying in blackness.
Rising, as the engines seem
sluggish.
AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
...no one would ever know.
Suddenly, a FILM of SLUSH on the windscreen.
58.
AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
With seemingly no warning, there
was ice. The controls froze.
And the Vega DIVES into a DIZZYING SPIN.
AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Through the spin I had one thought,
it would be warmer lower, the ice
would melt, I just had to regain
control...

Amelia REELING in her seat, her fingers FUMBLING in her

AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
The ice happened twice more, and I
began to lose heart. Then I
remembered Lindbergh's book saying
the same thing happened to him.

Only cloud.
AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
So I figured, if he's twice as
good, I just have to be twice as
lucky...

HOURS LATER. Amelia seriously fatigued. She breaks through
cloud into DAZZLING SUNLIGHT, and blinks, blinded.

AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I'd read that part in George's
reception room that first day.
Bless him for keeping me waiting.
The FUEL GAUGE reads EMPTY. She switches on the RESERVE
TANK. And as she DROPS back down into opaque clouds...
...she feels something. Her fingertips go to her left
shoulder, and come away...
Wet.
Slick.
AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
The cockpit gauge was defective.
There was a steady trickle of fuel
down my neck.
She looks around helplessly for a way to stem the dripping.
AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Toss-up whether the bigger danger
was running out of gas or going up
in a fireball. I had my answer in
less than an hour, when...

LATER. Amelia beyond exhaustion. Staring fixedly at some-
thing we can't see. Until we PAN through the wind screen to
the leak in the manifold weld. The BLUE FLAME is startlingly
LARGER, now LICKING its way along the surface of the
fuselage...
AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
The manifold weld began to
separate. I gauged the likelihood
of explosion at somewhere between
probable and inevitable.

Arms folded, George stares out his window. He hasn't slept

door opens softly...
SECRETARY (O.S.)

She stares at the paper.
His voice comes gently...
GEORGE

garbage?
AMELIA
Well, it reminds me how much I owe
to the men of this world. Keeps me
humble.
GEORGE
ood. And remembering how little
you owe me keeps me humble.
And softly...
GEORGE (CONT'D)
He's a crackpot. Let it go.
He points to the packed hall...
GEORGE (CONT'D)
Cheer up.
They're crazy about you.
AMELIA (quiet)
Well, they're crazy about
something.
She looks down.
Self-doubt flickers.
AMELIA (CONT'D)
What have we really done?
63.
GEORGE
You've made them feel like this.
AMELIA
That's not enough.
GEORGE
Most of them are women. And for
them, it's very much enough.
She shakes her head.
AMELIA
The World Telegram said, `a
magnificent display of useless
courage.'
GEORGE
The question is. Can any magnif-
icent display of courage be use-
less?
A
MELIA
The point is. Men do it every day.
And no one throws a parade.
Ah.
Well...
GEORGE
One day closer, then. To the day
when they won't think to throw one
for you.
She doesn't turn.
She doesn't smile.
AMELIA
Reasoning with me. A magnificent

He nods to himself.
GEORGE
And.
It's fun.

ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THE

Stopped watching every beautiful
accomplished man who crossed her

REVERSE ANGLE. Through the glass of our compartment door, a
crowd stands jouncing against each other. Gazing at their
Queen of the Skies.

I had a call from the Byrds.
They've asked us to dinner
Thursday.
AMELIA
Thursday, I'll be in Boston.
Meeting Gene Vidal and Paul
Collins.
Said lightly. Not even looking at him.
While through the
glass, it's become quite a tussle.
GEORGE
Don't tell me Gene wants to
resurrect Transcontinental?
AMELIA
No, he's starting a shuttle
service. Washington, New York,
Boston...
One woman goes flying from view, as a younger one gets her
place.

PAN the dark, elegant restaurant. In a corner by the fire-
place, Amelia and her dinner companions are being served
lobsters. GENE VIDAL leans to Amelia as he speaks, and she
hangs on every word.
GENE
Transcontinental was too ambitious.
Too many hops, too tough on the
ladies. But the shuttle...
A lean athlete's body, easy grace in every movement.
Strikingly handsome features that convey not only intellect,
but kindness and decency.
GENE (CONT'D)
Washington, New York, Boston. I
think it's the future. Will you
go there with us?
She's trying to crack her lobster, but can't take her eyes
off her host.
AMELIA
What on earth would you need me
for?
She's making a real mess of the lobster.
Gene notices.
PAUL
COLLINS doesn't...
PAUL
Hasn't George taught you anything?
Lady Lindy, the queen of the air,
the best known woman in the entire
U.S. of A?
Gene reaches over, as if it were his own plate, and begins
cracking her lobster for her. She looks in his eyes and
tries to concentrate.

two events in the Olympics, a top
pilot who should be running the
skies for Roosevelt when he wins...

Gene looks up at Paul, as if to say: Enough. Now he smiles
at Amelia. She blinks, what? Don't you want your lobster?

Oh. She starts eating...
ENE (looking only at Amelia)
Thanks, Paul. I think you've even
talked me out of it.

LATER. Paul has gone. Gene and Amelia are at the bar,
huddled over his beer and her Coke.
AMELIA (V.O.)
Gene had a terrible marriage and
was separated from his alcoholic
adulterous wife. But he was too
kind to humiliate her with a
divorce...
Gene drains the last of his beer.
AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
As a result, he was basically a
single parent to their young son,
Gore.
He glances at his watch.
Wow.
GENE
I'm rattling on here, and you've
got a morning train.
But she's just staring in his eyes.
This could be her last
chance to ask...
AMELIA
How's Nina doing?
GENE
Oh, fine.
Really?
He smiles, gently.
GENE (CONT'D)
Actually, she hasn't been feeling
her best. She'll probably summer
in Newport. So my kid's stuck with
Dad again.
AMELIA
If you two get bored, I could tag
along sometimes.
68.
GENE
You suggesting you're less boring
than I am?
AMELIA
Well, yeh.
He smiles first.
Hers is slower, but here it comes.
AMELIA (CONT'D)
Any given meal, I can eat a lobster
and have you boys in stitches.
A full beat.
He's deciding.
GENE
Gore would love that. He has a
little crush, I'm afraid.
AMELIA
At seven?
GENE
He's eight.
Well, then. He breaks the look.
Fishes out some cash for
the bar tab.
G
ENE (CONT'D)
Listen, Paul and I would be
thrilled to rope you into our
shuttle.
AMELIA
Are you kidding, it's a godsend.
No matter how hard George and I
work, how many lectures we cram in,
there's never enough money for the
next adventure.
He looks at her. Lets the silence sit there.
His eyes seem
to convey a depth of understanding.
GENE
The next adventure.
What is it?
She shrugs.
No idea.
GENE (CONT'D)
Because we're running out of
oceans.
AMELIA
Wish you'd do something about that.
69.
GENE
I'm serious, Amelia.
Her soft smile.
AMELIA
I know.
Always.
GENE
The only way you can stay where you
are. And be who you are...
Serious indeed.
GENE (CONT'D)
Is to keep feeding the beast.
She can't smile anymore.
Because this is the very fear she
lives with.
GENE (CONT'D)
And the beast always needs
something larger, greater, more
daring...
AMELIA (quiet)
He costs money, too.
GENE
The price of fame, literally. Do
you and George talk about this?
Silence.
AMELIA
We don't have to.
GENE
With all respect.
Yes, you do.

She possessed boundless energy, a

happened, she was obsessed with
flying, making Amelia her absolute
heroine. A

ELEANOR (CONT'D)
I did ask about aviation, but he
hasn't decided on the structure
yet. It might be under the Bureau
f Commerce.
AMELIA
I think the structure may be less
important than the man chosen to
run it.
Said casually, looking at her plate.
ELEANOR
My hearing is failing. I missed
the words `or woman,' which you
undoubtedly added after, or per-
haps before, the word `man.'
AMELIA

by the brilliant starry night. Amelia glances over, moved by
her friend's almost childlike wonder.
AMELIA (softly)
Put your hands on the wheel.
Eleanor looks over.
Are you serious?
AMELIA
It's dual controls.
No one will

Hesitation.
AMELIA (CONT'D)
Don't you trust me?
And slowly, Eleanor's fingers close on her wheel.
Amelia's

ELEANOR
Dear God.
The Condor purrs along through the night air. The moon bobs
slightly off to one side. Eleanor's eyes are swimming with
the thrill of this.

EORGE (V.O.)
By this time, I had a side job as

Paramount Pictures. So Amelia and
I bought a little place in Los
Angeles.
He goes slowly back to his desk.
On it, sits a large
cardboard CARTON.
EORGE (V.O.)
She was out there, preparing for a
flight, when our home in Rye burned
to the ground.
We SEE that the contents of the box, papers, small objects,
have been SINGED or CHARRED. He stares into it.
GEORGE (V.O.)
We both cried when I called to tell
her. She asked to come be with me.
But I insisted she stay there, to
keep on schedule for her flight.
He reaches into the box...
GEORGE (V.O.)
So many treasures lost. Letters
and poems she'd written. I poured
through the rubble...

...the RIGHT WHEEL COLLAPSES, the plane SPINS TO THE LEFT and
we INTERCUT between the cockpit and the runway as the
Electra...
...CAREENS MADLY for a thousand feet, Amelia CUTTING THE
SWITCHES to the engines, fighting for control, PROPELLERS
SMASHED by the concrete runway, SPARKS FLYING IN EVERY
DIRECTION...
INTERCUT. Oakland Airport. George and his retinue waiting.
A phone RINGING. Someone takes the call, his face freezes,
.
he looks wildly around to...
..George, who's there, SNATCHING the receiver.
VOICE (O.S.)
Have you heard? They crashed, the
ship's in flames.
SMASH CUT to the cockpit, the Electra SPINNING crazily on its
belly, SPARKS EVERYWHERE, the plane suddenly comes...
...to a BONE-JARRING STOP. The right MOTOR is pushed up INTO
its wing, which itself has BUCKLED, the stabilizer BENT, the
left wing extends UPWARD from scraping the runway, the
landing gear no longer exists.
SIRENS SCREAM as fire trucks and ambulances race toward them.
Amelia is ashen, disbelieving. Next to her, a gentle...
FRED
Good reaction, cutting the switch.
You saved our ass.
She doesn't even hear, THROWING open the cockpit, WAVING to
signal they're all right, we SMASH CUT TO...

Massive enclosed space. The rebuilt Electra in pieces at
various work stations, being perfected by teams of mechanics.

The whirr and clang of tools. Amelia and George confer with
one foreman, as George sees something. He touches her arm,
points in our direction. REVERSE ANGLE as she sees...
...Gene has entered the hangar.
Stands by the folding table
we've seen before.
GEORGE
Have fun.
AMELIA
Who let you off the hook on this?
She takes his hand firmly and together they cross the hangar
toward Gene. He smiles, unfolds a third chair. As they
arrive, Amelia steps forward...
...kisses Gene on the cheek.
George shakes his hand.
GENE
Thanks for letting me come.
As they sit, Gene looks from one to the other.
GENE (CONT'D)
I guess I'm already outvoted.
GEORGE
She'd outvote you all by herself.
he does it to me every day.
Gene's smile can't mask the concern in his eyes.
AMELIA
I don't have a choice. I have to
reverse my route and fly east. If
go west now, I'm risking
hurricanes in the Caribbean and
monsoons in Africa...
GENE
But you're flying Howland last,
when you're exhausted.
She knows this.
In the silence...
G
EORGE
Gene, this way our first leg is
Oakland to Miami. It's a shakedown
o make sure the plane is right.
That's crucial.
Gene nods, slowly.
His eyes still locked on her.
102.
GENE
Maybe I'm obsessing on Howland
because it was my bright idea,
and I'd feel responsible if...
AMELIA
Well, if I do pop off, I'll try
to make it somewhere that's not
your fault.
GENE
I'd appreciate that.
Draws a breath.
GENE (CONT'D)
You miss that island. You'll be
out of fuel, with 2000 miles to go.
AMELIA
But I'll have Fred so I won't miss.
In fact, I'm taking Fred along for
this whole trip.
Surprisingly, he doesn't seem to like this.
She smiles.
AMELIA (CONT'D)
Giving up my little arrogance about
solo. Safety first, yes?
But he's still unhappy.
She waits for him to say.
GENE
You and Fred alone for a month...
AMELIA
If you're worried about his
drinking, I'll deal with it.
Straight look.
AMELIA (CONT'D)
I can handle Fred.
And now we get a sense of exactly what does worry him.
He
glances to George...
GENE
How do you feel?
GEORGE
Tip-top. Every little girl needs a
man around. Even strong girls like
ours, hmmn?
A very direct gaze.
Words neither said nor needed.

Amelia beyond exhaustion, but focused, fighting it.
We think
she's flying alone. Until...
...Fred drops into the seat beside her. No words as he
watches her struggle. Our plane is all over the sky. The
DIN is ungodly.
AMELIA
YOU THINK WE SHOULD TURN BACK, HUH?
FRED
NOPE.
I THINK WE SHOULDN'T HAVE
COME.
An AIR POCKET DROPS them 200 feet.
AMELIA
HARD TO IMAGINE LANDING IN THIS.

I'VE GOT AN IDEA.
LET'S NEVER COME

For once, she's scared.

clips a propeller. Or flies into
the engine...
Her tired features form a smile.
AMELIA
've got an idea. Let's never
land. Better safe than sorry.
He takes her point.
She turns back to work...
AMELIA (CONT'D)
I'll wake you when the coffee's
ready.
And with cold-blooded nerve, she SWOOPS down, down, THROUGH
the flock of eagles, scattering them as we arc in for a
perfect landing. She never turns to...

heart started. He can't believe what she's just done.

It gets worse, I bought a brand-new

He stands and she takes his seat. He shows her the key to
press, then steps back toward the window. But she makes no
move to the radio. Just stares at him. He doesn't
understand.

Feel like stepping out for a

BALFOUR
I don't smoke.

I thought I was lying. Guess the

AMELIA
I'm mad at him. I'll be in
Honolulu on the 3rd, and with you
in Oakland for Fourth of July.
Okay?
GEORGE
Don't keep me waiting.
AMELIA
I won't dare. You're a very
important feline. Uh, fellow.
GEORGE
Talk to me about Fred.

AMELIA
Fred is fine. He's calculating
head-wind speed versus fuel as we
speak.
CLOSE on his face.

You wouldn't sell a salesman would
you?
AMELIA
He's fine.

So what's that I hear in

Mr. Putnam. Their headwinds are

took off.
Then...
BALFOUR (O.S.) (CONT'D)
I recalculated their fuel. It will
cost them 9%.
George staring off. Assessing the consequences. PULL BACK
to see an ENSIGN standing, waiting for instruction.

CIPRIANI
The direction finder.
How long has
this been on?
The seaman turns back at the door.
What?
The room is 9 x 20 with bare walls. At the transmitter, LEO
BELLARTS the chief radio man. Short and square, an
unflappable air of quiet expertise. With him, his assistant
WILLIAM DALTEN, lean and young with dark serious eyes. At a
typewriter sits THOMAS O'HARE, barely twenty, headphones
