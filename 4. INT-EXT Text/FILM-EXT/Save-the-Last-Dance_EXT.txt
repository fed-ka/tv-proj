of an empty stretch of land parted down the middle by
railroad tracks. An Amtrak Commuter crests the horizon,
heads TOWARD us. As it gets CLOSER, we GO IN TIGHTER to
see --

FACE OF SARA JOHNSON

17, pressed at one of its windows.
3
REVERSE ANGLE - REFLECTION IN TRAIN'S WINDOW -
3
SARA'S FACE
distant and lovely and sad. SUPERIMPOSED against an
endless stream of sky and trees. The train speeds up and
SARA's face flies by, disappearing FROM FRAME.
4

A sea of young white faces. A jock entertains the troops
with two straws up his nose. Sara sits next to her best
friend, LINDSAY, 17. Lindsay, chomping on a wad of gum,
turns from the jock to Sara with a bubble in bloom,
bursts it with her teeth.
LINDSAY
Wanna pray? You're leaving for
Philly after first period. I
won't see you. We should pray.
SARA
(stupefied)
Lindsay... no. Not here.
Lindsay grabs Sara's hand and bows her head.
Sara,
embarrassed, aligns her head with Lindsay's.
She's
praying nobody sees them.
LINDSAY
'Awesome, Father, S.J. auditions
today. She's ready for them.
Please make them ready for her.
Even if she screws up. Thanks.
Amen.'
(sure shrug; another
bubble)
God's gotten me outta all kinds of
shit. He oughta be able to get
you into Juilliard.

Sara exits with a bouquet of roses, takes the steps two
and three at a time. Glynn's waiting in a flower van at
the curb.
5.
11
11
Sara and Glynn. The back of the van is filled with
flower arrangements. Glynn takes note of the roses in
Sara's hand.
GLYNN
Where'd you get those, traitor?
SARA
Ellison -- Mr. Ellison. He
actually told me to break a leg.
GLYNN
Roses from the principal, even
droopy, out-of-season yellow ones,
is beyond cool, kiddo. You're
definitely movin' up in the world.
Sara looks through the windshield.
It's starting to
drizzle.
SARA
Know what would be great? If you
didn't drop me off at the bus
station. If we just kept going
until we get to Philly.
GLYNN
Ruin everyone's Valentine's Day
and not have a shop when I get
back. That's your definition of
great? I can see the headline
now: 'Starving Artist Kills Unfit
Mother.'
(gently)
Sweetheart, we talked about this.
I'll get there as soon as I can.
Sara looks at her and Glynn instantly feels guilty.
SARA
Right. This is the hardest, most
important day of my life and all
you can do is get there as soon as
you can. Thanks, Mom.
12

CONTINUOUS ACTION
Glynn pulls the van into the parking lot. Smiles at
Sara. Sara doesn't smile back. She's too angry. Too
scared.
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

SARA
So I guess I'll see you later.
GLYNN
I won't miss your audition, Sara.
I'll be there, okay? If I have to
swim the Susquehanna, I'll be
there.
SARA
Swim?
You can't swim, Mom.
GLYNN
I'll float then.
A moment. They look at each other. Sara finally smiles.
They embrace and she hops out the van. Glynn calls after
her.
GLYNN
Hey... Happy Valentine's Day.

A glowing moon in a clear, star-specked sky.

TRAIN
20
CHUGS toward Baltimore's Penn Station, which is visible
in the f.g.
21
21
A torrential rain. A flower van -- Glynn's van -- caught
in it. SHOOTING THROUGH the driver's side window, we can
see Glynn's face, intense and determined, squinting
through the downpour.
22
TRAIN'S WHEELS
22
GRINDING.
23
VAN'S WHEELS
23
Hydro-planing, slip-sliding.
24
TRAIN
24
It's SQUEAL OF BRAKES as it maneuvers into the station.
25
VAN

The SQUEAL of its BRAKES as Glynn loses control and
smashes into the back of the eighteen wheeler in front of
her.

across space and time, the SOUND OF SQUEALING BRAKES
commingle as the Amtrak Commuter pulls into Penn Station.

ROY JOHNSON, 37, a handsome, laconic man of uncertain
style, takes a last drag from his cigarette, drops and
stomps it. Passengers disembark from the train. Roy
searches their faces. They all look like strangers.
29
29
A conductor helps Sara to the platform. Steam from the
train's engine is sucked into the fog. She walks through
it. Sees him. They see each other. Roy weakly waves.
Walks toward her. Sara watches his bow legs stiffly
advance. She wants to run. Can't.
ROY
Hi.
SARA
Hi.
ROY
Have a good ride?
Sara self-consciously tucks her hair behind an ear.
SARA
Slept through most of it.
A beat.
Roy looks at her.
ROY
Guess you got stuff.
Baggage.
SARA
Two suitcases.
One big one.
ROY
Looks like they're unloading.
-- You hungry? We can stop
somewhere if you want.
SARA
I'm kinda tired.
Roy takes her backpack.
They walk.
30

A heavy silence. Roy starts to turn on the radio, stops
himself. He lights a cigarette, cracks the window.

ROY
I didn't like leavin' you so soon
after the funeral. I wouldn't
have if you hadn't asked me to go.
I mean, I could've hung around.
Helped you say good-bye. That's
what you were doin', wasn't it?
SARA
Uh-huh.
Roy takes another drag, nods thoughtfully to himself.
ROY
That's what I figured you were
doin'.
Sara peers out
the windshield. Baltimore City. The
neighborhoods
are changing. The streets are getting
progressively
gritty and dirty. It surprises her. It
worries her.
Roy worries her.
ROY
Look. Sara. I feel bad too. I
mean, we both got hit by the same
bolt of lightning. You don't have
to pretend this is easy.
(off nothing)
Everything's upside down right now
but don't worry. We'll work this
bachelor-father thing out. Hell,
it ain't like we're movin' in with
strangers. We got a pretty good
idea about each other, right?
Sara looks askance at him, her expression indicating
otherwise. A moment. Roy's too new at this to hold up
both ends of the conversation. The silence deepens. Roy
switches on the radio.
31
31
Roy's truck pulls up to a string of disrepaired rowhouses
with pristine white marble steps. He and Sara each lug a
suitcase from the truck. Her eyes wander up and down the
street. They're on the fringes of a ghetto. A few
people roost on their stoops, hang on the corners. All
of them have black faces.
SARA
Thought you were moving to Fells
Point.
ROY
Fell through.
11.
32
35
NEXT MORNING
Roy and Sara. Barreling through the south end, tongues
stuck in gear. A Pop-Tart grows cold on Sara's lap.
Then, finally.
SARA
I can take the school bus.
Tomorrow.
ROY
School bus? That's the other Oz,
Dorothy. Patterson kids ride the
city Metro. Or walk.
(CONTINUED)
13.
35
CONTINUED:
35
SARA
Well, I know how to do both.
ROY
Not around here you don't. Not
until you get the hang of things.
Sara looks out the window at a full-fledged ghetto. It's
all to obvious, the hang of things. Roy glances over at
her.
ROY
I called about your transcripts.
You're all set. Patterson's got a
pretty good Humanities program.
No ballet, but we can find a
studio someplace close for after
school --
SARA
-- I don't think I'll have time.
I have to study, I'll be busy.
Roy can hear the lie behind her words.
The pain too. He
lights a cigarette, cracks the window.
He wants to say
the right thing.
ROY
Good idea. Take a break. Not too
long a break though. You're a
dancer. You should dance. Stay
on top of your art.
SARA
Like you stay on top of yours?
ROY
Maybe I ain't playin' no grand
ballrooms or fancy jazz festivals,
but I'm playing.
SARA
(unconvincingly)
I didn't mean it like that.
ROY
S'alright. Hell, I wish I had
half the time I wasted gettin'
wasted. But those days are over.
You'll see. I got my life on
track.
14.
36

Formidably large and surprisingly well-kept, Patterson
serves the nearby, predominantly black O'Donnell Heights
Projects. Kids malinger outside on the front steps and
lawn.
37
FROM ANOTHER ANGLE - PARKING LOT
37
Roy's pickup pulls in. Roy CUTS the ENGINE. Sara looks
at him. Or through him. She won't let his eyes connect.
SARA
You don't have to go in with me.
Since I'm all set. I mean, I have
done this before. Gone to school.
I'll be fine. I am fine. Really.
Roy regards her with weary resignation.
Sara climbs out.
He calls after her.
ROY
-- Pick you up. Three-thirty.
SARA
(over a shoulder)
Yeah.
Sure. Whatever.
38
38
Sara moving TOWARD us PAST a floating mosaic of black
faces. This is a near out-of-body experience for her.
She walks like a well-rehearsed soldier in a stiff
straight line to the school's entrance. It's clogged
with students. Inside the doorway, two security guards
flank a metal detector. When it's Sara's turn to pass
through, one of the guards grabs her backpack and
wordlessly begins searching it. He hands it back to her
on the other side of the detector where Sara stands
obtusely and mutely amazed.
39
54
Sara follows Chenille into the "QUAD," four squared off
sections outside the cafeteria. There are a few dry-
rotted picnic tables scattered around. Other kids -- and
they run the gamut -- are seen in clots, sneaking
smokes... horsing around... making out.
SARA'S POV - KIDS OF QUAD
And OVER the sound of HIP-HOP MUSIC, a pair of feet.
Moving. Dancing. CAMERA PANS UP to reveal Nikki. She's
demonstrating some moves to the girls from the popular
table. Nikki's dancing her ass off, showing off.
BACK TO SCENE
SARA
What's it called? What she's
doing?
CHENILLE
A dance.
SARA
(a look; knows that)
No, I mean... the step, the...
She trails off as she catches someone in the corner of
her eye. She turns away from Chenille, gradually
focusing on --
PATRICK
playing cards with Snookie at one of the picnic tables.
He glances up to see Sara. Glowering at him. He grins.
Sara rolls her eyes, turns away.
Mutters loudly to
herself.
SARA
Asshole.
(CONTINUED)
22.

CHENILLE
Asshole beaucoup. In this crowd,
you gotta be more specific.
SARA
(covertly indicates
Patrick)
He's in one of my classes. Thinks
he's so... smart. So cute.
CHENILLE
I don't know about cute but he is
smart. Real smart. Real trip,
too.
SARA
So you know him?
CHENILLE
Patrick Reynolds? Hell yeah, I
know him. He's my brother.
Chenille waits for Sara to swallow her tongue.
Enjoys a
laugh.
ANGLE SHIFTS TO PATRICK
as Nikki approaches him. Sexy, standoffish and
conceited, she's the stuff of wet dreams and futile
longing. She sits down next to Patrick. Close to him.
Snookie watches her, much amused.
NIKKI
You comin' tonight?
Patrick keeps playing his hand.
Responds very coolly.
PATRICK
Gotta work.
NIKKI
You already skipped three
meetings.
(as he's ignoring
her)
Is it because of me? Everybody on
the committee thinks it's because
of me. Us.
(infuriated by his
silence)
Look, Patrick. Regardless.

NIKKI (CONT'D)
You're in charge of the music.
I'm in charge of the prom. So
show up. Don't make me fire your
ass.
Fighting words. Snookie holds his breath. Patrick
throws out a card, turns slowly to Nikki with a withering
stare in his eyes.
PATRICK
You already fired my ass, Nikki.
Once and done. Over. Out. 'Bye.
She stalks off. Snookie oogles her departure, peers at
Patrick, about to say something. Patrick cuts him off,
indicates cards.
PATRICK
Hit me and shut the hell up.
SNOOKIE
I'ma shut up... after I say it
been real frigid 'round here since
y'all broke up. 'Specially since
she broke up with you. That was
harsh, way she canceled your ass
like a stamp for that Howard U
dude. But their shit's over. Now
might be the time to forget
mistakes that was made. Shoot.
You been with the girl since ninth
grade.
PATRICK
Why you sweatin' me, Snookie?
SNOOKIE
(pounding his heart)
'Cause I'm about you, man. I want
a happy ending. Aww, shit. Tuck
an' duck. Here he comes. The
hood of the 'hood, up to no good.
THEIR POV
MALAKAI RHINEHART, 17, heading toward them. Powerfully
built and edgy with insolence, Malakai is like a tightly-
wound coil -- you never know when he's going to snap.
ANGLE WIDENS and we see Patrick is happy to see him. He
and Malakai grin at each other. Knock handshakes.

MALAKAI
Medicine man...
SNOOKIE
(interjecting himself)
Did I tell you, Malakai, man, how
chill it is to have you back?
We ain't been bad without cha.
MALAKAI
Shut the fuck up and step your
lame ass off, Snookie. You heard
me. Space.
Snookie haughtily, comedically obliges.
A moment.
PATRICK
What happened to you at lunch,
man?
MALAKAI
Business.
Short-hand. Patrick understands it, nods. Malakai slips
the cigarette from behind his ear, openly lights and
starts smoking it. CAMERA TRACKS them walking back
toward Patterson.
PATRICK
So you're hangin' in, man?
Feelin' strong about being back?
MALAKAI
Not at this motherfucker. Out a
week and where am I? Fucking home
sweet high school. Jail away from
jail. You can have it.
PATRICK
You gonna stay though.
Right?
MALAKAI
Judge says it's school or JuVee
and I sure as hell ain't goin'
back there. Shit. I never knew a
year could be such a long time.
A flash of commiseration, of guilt, crosses Patrick's
face. They're at the doors now. Most of the kids have
gone. Malakai puts his cigarette out on the floor as
they step in.
(CONTINUED)
25.
54

PATRICK
You up for some hoops after
school? Break your free-throw
back in. Chump the chumps like we
used to.
MALAKAI
Up for it? Hell-the-fuck yeah,
man. Let's do it.
55
55
Sara exits with Chenille. A CAR HORN starts to blare.
Both of them ignore it. But it goes on like a musical
number. Sara gets a sinking feeling that drops like a
stone when she looks across the street. Roy's parked at
the curb, waiting for her. She rolls her eyes and he
HONKS AGAIN. Then he waves at her. Waves! Chenille
looks at Sara. Then at Roy.
CHENILLE
That's your old man? Now he's
cute.
SARA
He's embarrassing.
CHENILLE
(laughs)
Yeah.
He is. For you.
56
56
Sara climbs in, slams the door. Roy looks over at her,
unaware of how annoyed she is with him. She's a clenched
fist inside.
ROY
How'd it go?
SARA
Fine.
(as he pulls off)
Tomorrow I catch the bus.
57
61
MORNING
Patrick, Chenille, Snookie straggle through the dreary
jungle of concrete lawns and blighted high rises on the
way to school. It's quiet now but the scars of past
battles, like the bombed out police substation on one of
its corners, are evident everywhere.
SNOOKIE
I need a date --
CHENILLE
Why?
Your hand busy?
SNOOKIE
-- For the prom. And if it wasn't
for that kinda undue attitude, you
could be the lucky girl, Chenille.
My personal prom queen. I can see
us now.
(CONTINUED)
28.

CHENILLE
You must be lookin' in your
dreams.
Snookie glances at Patrick.
He's somewhere else.
SNOOKIE
Help me, man.
Defend me.
PATRICK
I got my own problems, Snook.
SNOOKIE
What problems? You goin' to
college. Doctor college after
that. You large, man.
PATRICK
I ain't gonna be doctor nothin' if
I don't get in and I'm not in 'til
I get my letter.
CHENILLE
It's in the mail, Patrick.
Okay?
SNOOKIE
(wishfully thinking)
I probably coulda been a doctor
too. If I hadn't got left back
that time.
CHENILLE
That time? What? Fifth and sixth
grade don't count?
Patrick finally laughs. Then his face changes. Becomes
serious. He hops a low wall, keeps in stride above them.
They continue on like this, the ruins of their world in
the b.g. behind them.
62
62
The bus is crammed with kids. Sara, seated by a window,
doesn't bother looking out. Inside's more interesting.
The kids cut up. Singing, rapping, and jousting with
each other. Some even manage to read. Sara watches with
immunity. She's invisible to them.
63
63
Sara alights just as Patrick, Chenille, and Snookie walk
past. Patrick's the only one to see her and their eyes
briefly connect.
29.
64
70
Sara. In a skin-tight miniskirt and a bolero jacket.
Looking more eighties than nineties, more cute than cool.
She walks with tentative, jittery purpose down this
poverty stricken street. Doesn't meet anyone's eye. But
can feel the eyes on her. She keeps going. She's walked
too far to turn back.
71
71
Approaching the malignant edifices as the Heights begin
to come to life... or death, depending how luck's
running. Sara walks into this world of shadows and
despite a trepidation, finds something fascinating about
the possibility of real danger.
35.
72
72
Chenille triple unlocks the door, lets Sara in. Sara's
surprised -- the apartment is surprisingly quaint and
extremely neat. It looks a helluva lot better than Roy's
place. Chenille is dressed in hugely baggy military-
style pants and a tube top with a form-fitting, short-cut
leather coat over it. Sara takes it in.
SARA
Cool outfit.
CHENILLE
Slammin'.
Slammin' outfit.
SARA
... I look okay?
Chenille gives her the once over.
Decides to lie.
CHENILLE
Yeah.
You look okay.
(then)
Moma Dean. I'm leavin'.
FROM ANOTHER ANGLE
GRANDMOMMA DEAN enters with a toddler ("CHRISTOPHER") in
her arms. She sports snow white, waist-length dreads and
she's wearing a dashiki lounger. Despite her white
locks, she doesn't look old enough to be a grandmother.
She hands Christopher to Chenille. Inspects Sara. Her
eyes are open, kind.
CHENILLE
(fussing over
Christopher)
Grandmom, Sara. Sara, Grandmom.
Also known as Momma Dean. And
handsome here is Christopher.
SARA
Hi.
MOMMA DEAN
Hello. Now don't get him all
riled up, Chenille. I want to get
some sleep tonight.
Chenille kisses Christopher, hands him off to Momma Dean.
They exit. Sara looks tentatively at Chenille.
SARA
Is that... is he... yours?
CHENILLE
He sure ain't Momma Dean's.
36.
73
73
- NIGHT
They've been talking.
Well, Chenille has. Sara's been
listening. Intently.
Liking this confidence they're
sharing.
CHENILLE
... He'll be one in July. Best
mistake I ever made. Kenny --
Christopher's father -- he's the
worst. Triflin'. Okay?
74
74
A curbed cab. Sara and Chenille get out. Chenille digs
into her pocketbook, hands Sara her I.D. PUSH IN ON
photo of obese white girl with an untamed trailer trash
perm. Sara's eyes go wide.
SARA
Chenille.
She's ugly.
She's fat!
CHENILLE
She's twenty-one too. I ain't got
all night. Let's hop.
SARA
Wait. I have to ask you
something.
(hard for her)
Do I really look alright?
An unspoken thing passes between them. Chenille suddenly
whips off her coat. Gestures at Sara with her head.
CHENILLE
Gimme that '89 Madonna shit.
Your
jacket. Give it here.
Sara takes off the bolero. Chenille ties it around her
own neck, then yanks Sara's miniskirt down around her
hips. Sara's torso is clad in a long-sleeved cotton tee.
Chenille frowns at it.
SARA
It's from the GAP.
CHENILLE
It's country. You look country in
it. Take it off.
SARA
I'm not walking in there in my
bra.
(CONTINUED)
37.
74
CONTINUED:
74
Chenille thrusts her leather coat at her. Sara can't
believe what she's doing, getting (un)dressed on a public
street! She pulls off the tee, slips on Chenille's coat.
Buttons it as far as the buttons go. Looks down. Half
her chest is exposed.
75
75
Gaining on what looks like an abandoned warehouse.
Chenille snorts at the roped off queue of kids waiting to
get inside.
CHENILLE
Rope dopes.
C'mon.
She leads Sara to the door of FEETZ. The Sumo-sized MAN
guarding it knows Chenille, digs her. His grin exposes
gold-capped teeth.
DOORMAN
Chenille.
Lookin' fine.
As
always.
CHENILLE
Too fine to stand in line?
The Man grins, opens the rope, lets them in -- "in" being
just inside the front door. A BOUNCER there collects the
$10.00 cover charge. Checks their I.D. He hands Sara's
back with a smirk.
BOUNCER
Changed your hair.
He waves a metal detector over their bodies, nods to yet
another bouncer who escorts Sara and Chenille through yet
another door.
76
ANOTHER ANGLE
76
They march a short distance to an old elevator where a
group of kids wait. Bouncer #2 engages the elevator.
Everyone piles in.
77
82
The exit door bursts open and Patrick and Malakai tumble
out. Patrick bends over, cups his knees as he catches
his breath.
PATRICK
Man, what the hell are you doin'?
Tryin' to get sent back up?
MALAKAI
They the ones tryin' shit. Comin'
here. Squarin' off in my shit.
PATRICK
You couldn't let it slide?

82
MALAKAI
Let it slide tonight, they come
back strong tomorrow. You know
that.
PATRICK
Malakai, you fuck up parole, you
ain't gonna back to JuVee.
Eighteen and up, that's Jessup.
Hardcore lockdown. You want that?
MALAKAI
(regards him coldly)
I want what was mine. Feetz is my
spot. I'ma do business here just
like I did before. Like we did
before. And if I gotta stomp some
niggers in my way, so be it.
An uncertain but tense moment.
Patrick tries to salvage
it.
PATRICK
Well, you definitely got the
stompin' part down.
They look at each other.
Share a small laugh.
MALAKAI
We fucked those fools up for sure.
PATRICK
(crossing to exit door)
For damn sure, man.
Patrick finds the door locked. He and Malakai hoist
themselves over a high, wrought iron fence. Disappear
behind it.
83
83
Distant WAIL of SIRENS as Feetz begins to empty out.
Kids converge on the sidewalks. PICK UP Sara, Chenille
and Diggy. Waiting and watching for Patrick. Diggy
looks at them.
DIGGY
It's about to get real out here.
Cops and shit. I'm gone.
She leaves. Chenille spots Patrick. Not too worse for
the wear. She smiles with relief. Then Sara sees him.
She smiles too.
47.
84
84
Sara, Patrick and Chenille. Walking home. Chenille's
preaching to Patrick. He's not in the mood.
CHENILLE
... Yeah, I'ma tell you. Tell you
like I keep tellin' you, Patrick.
You need to let Malakai alone.
Let him handle his own shit before
he drags you down in it.
PATRICK
Chenille. I heard you the first
five hundred times.
They round a corner bordering the Heights. Stop in front
of it. Chenille, disconcerted with Patrick, looks dourly
at Sara.
CHENILLE
I'll see you Monday.
(to Patrick, like an
order)
He'll walk you.
As much as this makes sense, it still takes Patrick by
surprise. Sara sees it in his face, regards Chenille
with a false bravado.
SARA
It's just a few blocks.
It's
okay.
CHENILLE
No, it's not okay. Would you tell
the girl it ain't okay?
PATRICK
It's not okay, okay?
(before she can
protest)
Come on, Braveheart.

Sara keeps stealing glances of him.
Or so she
thinks.

What?

What?

PATRICK
Why you keep lookin' at me?
SARA
I have to look somewhere. The
streets are deserted. Might as
well look at you.
PATRICK
That's not why. You wanna know
somethin'. Ask somethin'.
SARA
It's not a question. It's the way
you were beating that kid up. You
looked so mad.
PATRICK
I was mad and he wasn't no kid.
But you're from the suburb Mars,
right? Folks don't fight there.
SARA
Not like that.
(some kind of
wonder)
You were really kicking his ass.
It's not funny, the look on her face.
But Patrick
laughs.
SARA
Are you laughing at me?
Dropping the smile, Patrick shakes his head.
Looks at
her.
PATRICK
My friend was in trouble.
SARA
Maybe he's my question. Your
friend. Chenille doesn't like
him.
PATRICK
She likes him. It don't stop her
from trippin' off him now and
then. But Malakai's good people.
We go back. Way back. You know,
like they say, through thick and
thin.
(beat)
So, how'd you like Feetz?

SARA
It was great.
PATRICK
Once you got used to the music.
SARA
It wasn't the music I wasn't used
to. I mean, it's not the first
time I heard hip-hop, Patrick.
PATRICK
Uh-huh. Bet you listen to it all
the time.
Patrick regards her with a sly, knowing smile. His stare
is significant, unsettling. Sara's face flushes. She
turns from him, hoping he didn't see it.
SARA
Not all the time. But a lot.
PATRICK
We gettin' any closer to your crib
or should we stop for food and
water?
Sara snaps out of it. Looks around. Shit. First the
flush and now this. She looks at him. She could kick
herself.
SARA
We passed it.
PATRICK
You passed it.
A look. They double back to her front door.
Pause on
the stoop.
SARA
Thanks for walking me.
PATRICK
No problem.
SARA
So.
I'll see ya.
PATRICK
Is that 'see ya' like gee-whiz,
had a great time, can't wait to
see you again?

PATRICK (CONT'D)
Or is it like 'see ya,' I'll bust
a cap in your ass if you ever
darken my doorstep again?
He makes it impossible not to smile.
So damned charming.
SARA
I haven't said gee-whiz since I
was six. But I really had a great
time... okay?
PATRICK
Okay.
She enters the rowhouse. Patrick waits until the lights
go on inside before he turns around and starts home.

Roy's making breakfast when Sara straggles in. She peers
at the stove. Scrambled eggs and bacon. Toast too! A
first for him.
ROY
Figured I'd put a little marrow in
your bones. Siddown, siddown.
(she slumps in chair)
You gettin' along at school?
Makin' friends...?
(as she nods robotically)
... See any of 'em last night?
He slides a plate in front of her.
Stands there holding
his.
ROY
I came home on my break.
SARA
Oh.
The succinct sneer in her voice gets to Roy.
He snaps at
her.
ROY
... Oh? Jesus! You're hard!
Look. You're seventeen. If you
wanna go out, go out. But don't
lie to me. On top of everything
else, don't make me worry like
that about you.

ROY (CONT'D)
(after long moment)
I didn't mean to yell.
(sits down; trying
like hell)
So how are the eggs? They good?
Sara takes a small, tasteless sample, nods. They eat in
silence. Then Sara looks over at him with genuine if
detached remorse.
SARA
You're right. I should've said
something. I'm sorry.
Roy exhales.
Finally, a chink in the brick wall.
ROY
What're you gonna do today?
Anything special?
SARA
Nope.
Nothing special.

Sara walks up the street (passing many black people),
sees Roys' pickup. Shit. He's home.
92
CAMERA TRACKS

Sara as she enters their rowhouse, walks up a flight of
stairs to their apartment. There's a JAZZ INSTRUMENTAL
FAINTLY coming from it. And another NOISE. Foreign and
yet familiar. Like grunting... but not. Sara unlocks
the door. Opens it.
93
SARA'S POV - LIVING ROOM
93
Her father's fucking somebody! On the couch. Half on it
anyway. In broad daylight! The whore underneath him is
moaning. Jesus!
ANGLE WIDENS as Sara turns away from the spectacle.
Reaches for Roy's sax. She blows the longest, shrillest
note known to mankind.
94

The hair on his head stands up.
His body deflates
instantly.

Patrick, in coveralls, slouches over a mechanic's station
studying. A few workers mill about, waiting for the next
car on a slow day. A BMW with tinted windows peels into
the lot on two wheels. Patrick looks up as Malakai and a
tall, wiry, nattily dressed man get out.
PATRICK
I got it.
He exits into the lot.
Approaches Malakai and the man
("TUTE").
MALAKAI
Medicine Man.
You know Tute.
Tute takes in Patrick.
Looks around.
Snickers
derisively.
TUTE
You call this a job, man?
PATRICK
Actually, I call it a car wash.
The work I do, yeah, that's a job.
Malakai lets out a nervous laugh.
Tute doesn't crack a
smile.
TUTE
I need some sticks.
Watch my
ride, Malakai.
Tute enters the cashier's office.
Patrick looks at
Malakai.
PATRICK
You hangin' with him now?
Think
that's a good idea, 'Kai?
MALAKAI
You got a better one?
PATRICK
You could try layin' all this shit
off for awhile. Give yourself a
chance on the other side.
MALAKAI
What other side?
PATRICK
You know what I mean. It ain't
like you don't have good sense.
(CONTINUED)

MALAKAI
I got sense enough to know who I
am, what I can do and where I can
do it. I ain't like you. People
don't just up and hand me shit.
Tute emerges from cashier's office lighting a cigarette
from a fresh pack. He blows a plume of smoke into the
air, regards Patrick.
TUTE
We ain't here for our health.
You
workin', then work.
(throws Patrick
car keys)
And don't forget the rims.

A low sun over the cityscape of Baltimore. PUSH IN ON
Patrick and Sara, two dots that grow larger. He CLICKS
ON a BOOM-BOX resting on the roof's ledge. A hip-hop
track BLASTS.
PATRICK
Feel the groove. Don't let the
music mess with you.
He starts to move with the music. Sara tries to emulate
him. They dance throughout the conversation.
SARA
Did you always want to be a
doctor?
PATRICK
Who said I wanna be a doctor?
SARA
Chenille.
Everybody.
He cinches her waist, pushes in her ass.
(CONTINUED)

PATRICK
Keep it tight.
Watch your butt.
SARA
What kind of doctor do you want to
be?
PATRICK
Pediatrics. I like kids.
Come
on, stay with me. You're
slackin'.
SARA
Do you have any? Kids.
PATRICK
No.
Do you?
SARA
I wasn't being smart, Patrick.
PATRICK
Wouldn't be the first time.
She stops.
Regards him.
He stops.
Regards her.
Stalemate.
SARA
Screw you.
I'm brilliant.
He goes into a spin, a half-split, comes out of it
swaggering and half-stepping around her. Sara gives him
an impish look. Rises up on full pointe, turns out her
legs and lifts one of them in a spiral just below his
head. It happens in two blinks. So fast Patrick thinks
it was a mirage. He stares at her, dumbfounded. Sara
smiles. The look on his face is worth the pain in her
joints. She blows some stray hair out of her face, puts
her hands on her hips. Looks appropriately hapless.
SARA
I didn't get it. That thing you
just did. Show me again?
PATRICK
What was that shit you just did?
He mimes the move -- badly.
Sara can't help it.
She
laughs.
SARA
A releve.
Over ice.
With a
twist.

(succumbs to his
bewilderment)
Ballet. I used to dance, Patrick.
PATRICK
You used to dance?
SARA
Uh-huh. Used to as in don't any
more. And don't ask me why.
She sounds suddenly defensive.
Patrick's suddenly
intrigued.
PATRICK
Why not?
SARA
Because I don't want to talk about
it.
PATRICK
That's why you brought it up. Did
that whole relieve thing. 'Cause
you don't wanna talk about it?
SARA
Because it's not a big deal.
Can
we just concentrate on this?
PATRICK
Yeah, we can concentrate.
(a beat; goading her
a little)
But I think it is a big deal.
Whatever it is you don't wanna
talk about.
Sara shakes her head adamantly. He nods his head
emphatically. Another stalemate. They dance coyly,
seductively around it.
110
114
A perfect day. CAMERA PANS FROM the waterfront TO the
bustling crowds of the inner harbor, then to a park
across from this where Sara and Patrick are practicing.
HIP-HOP MUSIC softly PLAYS from Patrick's BOOM-BOX. Sara
watches his face as they dance.
PATRICK
Didn't you like it when you 'used'
to dance?
(CONTINUED)
67.
114
CONTINUED:
114
SARA
Yeah I liked it. I was gonna go
to Juilliard. That school fucked
up my entire life. It's a long
story.
PATRICK
Let me guess. You don't wanna
talk about it.
Sara looks at him.
A soft smile is all she offers up.
115
115
They lay on their bellies in the grass.
Close to each
other.
PATRICK
I stole a bike here once.
SARA
Why'd you do that?
PATRICK
'Cause I didn't have one.
SARA
That's a good reason.
PATRICK
I used to do wild shit like that.
SARA
You and Malakai?
PATRICK
Yep.
Most of the time.
SARA
I don't get you guys.
You seem
so... different.
PATRICK
We're not.
SARA
Maybe you weren't then but you are
now. You said you changed.
PATRICK
Doesn't make me different from
him. Not the way you think it
does.
(CONTINUED)

115
SARA
I think Malakai's scary.
And I
know you're not.
PATRICK
(taking mild umbrage)
What you mean by scary? 'Kai's
tough. He has to be. He still
got a good heart. I know.
Sara stares at the ground, struggling to tell him what
she saw.
SARA
Patrick.
PATRICK
Let me finish. Me and him got
into some shit awhile back. Real
bad shit. We held up a gas
station off 95. I bailed the ride
-- jumped out the car. 'Kai kept
goin', got caught.
(pauses)
I knew what he was gonna do that
night. Knew the car was hot. I
woulda been guilty as him if they
had caught me, if Malakai had
served my name up. But he didn't.
SARA
That means you owe him something?
PATRICK
He did his time plus most of mine.
I owe him that.
SARA
No matter how much he messes up?
PATRICK
We all mess up. Maybe Malakai
gave up. But he's still m'boy and
he still got a chance. I ain't
just gonna cross him completely
off and be like everybody else.
He looks at her and she doesn't have the heart -- or the
nerve -- to tell him. A long moment. She plucks a
dandelion from the grass, twirls it thoughtfully in her
fingers.

I stole a hat once. When I was
twelve. My mom found it under my

Gangsta' Sara.
Stole a hat.
Call
the F.B.I.
She looks at him.
Smiles.
Twirls the dandelion under
his nose.
SARA
You gonna turn me in?
PATRICK
I think I'll wait for you to
surrender.
(pauses)
Were you tight with your mom,
Sara? I mean, y'all get along and
shit?
SARA
(guardedly)
Yeah...tight... got along and shit
PATRICK
So she meant something to you.
How come you never talk about her?
SARA
There's nothing to say.
PATRICK
(studying her face)
Know why there's nothing to say?
Because you don't talk about her.
You won't talk about her.
SARA
I'm sorry she's dead. God! What
do you want me to do? Run through
the streets screaming?
PATRICK
Why not?
If it helps.
SARA
(tersely)
Well, it won't. So drop it.
PATRICK
And you call Malakai scary.

She looks at him. Patrick grins. Sara knocks her legs
against his. He knocks his legs back. A silly moment.
But it transcends the tension and creates a sweet truce
between them.
116
117
Dressed to the nines. They look happy and relaxed, more
so than we've ever seen. They sit close to each other.
Very close.
SARA
Are you gonna tell me where we're
going?
(as he grins, shakes
his head)
Why is the surprise for me?
You're the one with something to
celebrate.
PATRICK
We can celebrate together.
(CONTINUED)
71.
117
CONTINUED:
117
She looks at him. Can't find any words. So she just
goes into her evening bag and pulls out a small box. She
hands it to him, a little nervous about how it will be
received.
SARA
I wanted to get you something and
I couldn't figure out what. It's
not much but I hope you like it.
Patrick opens the box. Removes a key chain. It's
engraved with the medical emblem (snake & staff, etc.).
He regards her, touched.
PATRICK
I like it.
I love it.
Thank you.
SARA
Wait.
There's more.
She leans in, turns the key chain over in his hand. The
back side of it is engraved with the words, "PATRICK
REYNOLDS, M.D." Patrick locks eyes with Sara, lifts her
hand to his lips. Kisses it softly. The gesture is
succinct but alluring and, for a brief moment, they're
the only two people in the world.
118
118
The bus makes a stop and an older white woman gets on.
Sits across from Sara and Patrick who have moved even
closer to each other. Patrick's arm is around Sara's
shoulder. He whispers something in Sara's ear. She
laughs and looks up to see the white woman staring at
them with a muted but obvious repugnance. Watching the
woman from the corner of her eye, Sara drapes her arms
around Patrick's neck, nuzzles at his ear. Patrick's
eyes widen. Sara, playing this for all it's worth, folds
one of her legs between his and whispers:
SARA
We have an audience.
Work with
me.
PATRICK
(nonplussed)
Work with you?
SARA
(sotto voce,
through her teeth)
Grab something.
(CONTINUED)
72.
118

118
He grabs her ass
-- what else is there? -- runs his hand
along her side.
The white woman, thoroughly disgusted,
gets up and moves
to the back of the bus. Patrick and
Sara look at each
other, burst out laughing.
119
119
The equivalent of D.C.'s Kennedy Center, the hall is
awash in lights and activity. Men and women are donned
in formal attire. Parking valets hover on the sidewalks
waiting for cars. Into this, Sara and Patrick walk. She
looks at the crowd, then sees the overhead banner --
"Boston Ballet, A Command Performance." Sara's heart
stops. Her feet freeze. Patrick looks at her. She
looks positively catatonic.
PATRICK
Surprise... Sara?
SARA
(quietly urgent)
I can't. I can't go in.
PATRICK
(doesn't understand)
You have to go in. This is where
I'm bringing you. The ballet.
SARA
(beside herself)
I know, but --
PATRICK
(crestfallen)
But what?
Sara looks at him, feeling bad. Feeling stupid for
ruining the evening. She bites her lip, shakes her head
("but nothing"). Patrick takes her and they go in.
120
121
Post-ballet, Sara and Patrick walk. She's quiet,
introspective. Patrick's at a loss. He can't decipher
her mood and, which is more, he's disappointed by it.
PATRICK
I thought you would like it.
SARA
I did.
PATRICK
You ain't actin' like you did.
She looks over at him, tries to smile.
SARA
I'm sorry.
They come to a small, secluded bridge.
Sara sits down on
the edge of it. Patrick follows suit.
A long moment.
SARA
I don't want you to think I didn't
have a good time tonight, Patrick.
I did. But ballet isn't a part of
my life anymore.
PATRICK
Why not? What happened? You just
woke up one day and decided to
waste your talent.
SARA
(without rancor)
How do you know I have talent?
Because I did some stupid leg
trick.
PATRICK
I saw the look on your face when
you did it, Sara. The same look I
saw tonight. Goofy happy. So if
you're gonna tell me somethin'
about not dancing, at least tell
me somethin' real.
A long, difficult moment wherein Sara attempts to find
the words, face the pain that comes with them. Finally,
she looks at him.
SARA
Maybe I don't want it to be real.
(CONTINUED)
74.
121
CONTINUED:
121
She stares out at the water, the moon reflected off of
it. It's hard to reconcile that beauty and the turmoil
she's feeling. But she goes on.
SARA
What I want is to wake up and see
my mom. For things to go back to
the way they were. When they made
sense. When my life made sense.
(because)
And it's all my fault. She got
scraped off the highway for me,
for my fucking audition. She was
rushing. It was raining. It was
raining...
(a torrent)
... But she promised to be there.
I made her promise. And then I
didn't wait for her. I should
have but they called my name and I
didn't say anything. I just went
out and danced. I was mad. I
needed her and she wasn't there.
She buries her face in her hands, breaking down, racked
with tears and guilt. Patrick puts his arms around her.
SARA
(inconsolable)
She was dying while I was dancing
and I was mad at her and I'm
sorry. I'm sorry...
PATRICK
It's not your fault it rained or
she died. Or that you danced.
That's what you were there for.
Your mom would've expected you to
do what you did.
Sara, choking on tears, regards him forlornly.
SARA
That's what makes it so bad. She
always did what was right for me.
I wanted to be a prima ballerina
-- had to be. Even if it took
most of our money, all of her
spare time. I didn't care. It
was my stupid dream and it killed
her. All she wanted was for it to
come true.
(CONTINUED)
75.
121
CONTINUED:
121
PATRICK
You still got whatever you had
when your mom was alive, Sara.
She wouldn't want you to give up.
Sara swipes at her face, looks up at him, still crying.
SARA
I know... but she... I just don't
think I can do it without her.
PATRICK
(holding her)
Do you want to do it, Sara? I
mean you. Do you want Juilliard?
SARA
Yeah.
I do.
PATRICK
Then it's on you to make the dream
come true.
SARA
Yeah.
For my mom.
PATRICK
For her.
For you.
122
122
Patrick walks Sara to the front door. They pause on the
stoop. Neither of them wants the night to end.
SARA
See you tomorrow?
A rhetorical question under the circumstances. Patrick
regards her tenderly, moves her hair from her eyes.
Stares deeply into them. Sara smiles wanly, certain she
looks like shit. But it doesn't matter. The moment has
named itself. And so, with more certainty than passion,
they kiss.
123
(DOWNTOWN BALTIMORE) - DAY
124
Sara and Patrick negotiate the heavy pedestrian traffic,
exit the complex. He leads her to a mall of trees and
bike paths.
PATRICK
Lemme see that move you did.
That
cute leg relieve thing.
(as she shakes
her head)
Come on, Sara.
SARA
(hates to admit this)
It hurts! I'm out of shape and it
hurts. Okay? Satisfied?
PATRICK
(admiring her)
That's what you call outta shape,
what's it take to get you in
shape?
SARA
Practice.
PATRICK
This is the perfect spot for that.
You can run around and I can sit
under the trees and watch you.
SARA
I don't get in shape like that.
But it's still a good spot.
(diffidently)
I got my application for
Juilliard. Just in time too.
They're holding auditions in
Baltimore next month.
PATRICK
That's great!
She looks at him, shakes her head.
Not that great.
SARA
I'll never be ready in a month.
PATRICK
Sara, you puttin' the mojo on
yourself.

SARA
(a smile in spite of
herself)
Mojo?
PATRICK
Negative shit. White folks call
it karma. The bad kind.
SARA
You don't understand. Ballet
takes a lot of time, a lot of
preparation. I used to practice
two, three hours every day. I'm
so far behind...
... And unsure and afraid. Which Patrick can sense.
But
he won't let her go there or stay there. He's firm,
matter-of-fact.
PATRICK
Quit whinin' and catch up then.
SARA
It's not as easy as that. My free
form still sucks. It's still the
weakest part of my routine. That
hasn't changed.
PATRICK
So I'll help you with it.
SARA
You will?
PATRICK
(surprised that she's
surprised)
Yeah. I'll help you. Tell me
what you need to do and let's get
busy.
MONTAGE SEQUENCE

A break between classes draws the requisite claques and
cliques. Sara and Patrick huddle over a chemistry book,
attentive to each other. Nikki stands off watching both
of them. Malakai saunters up to her smoking a joint.

(in for the kill)
I am a little bit... chagrined
though, Nikki. You lettin' some
white ho' show you up like that.
He regards her with bemused pity. Nikki, with all her
inner outrage, manages to salvage her pride. She sneers
in his face.
NIKKI
Fuck you, Malakai. Fuck her too.
MALAKAI

Ain't no need in fuckin' me...

A four-on-four game in progress. Patrick, Malakai,
Snookie and Arvel versus the Druid Hill Two Deuces. An
unseen BOOM BOX BLASTS the music of JAY-Z throughout.
Patrick has the ball. He passes it to Malakai. They AD-
LIB insults to the Two Deuces. This is heaven for them.
Talking shit and playing ball. The best time.
INTERCUT WITH:
144
145
Malakai dribbles the ball around one of the Two Deuces,
skies it. Misses the hoop. Patrick rebounds. Passes it
back to 'Kai. He takes the shot. Makes it. Patrick and
Arvel strut victoriously.
146
147
As the dejected Deuces look on, Malakai high-fives
Patrick and Snookie. Arvel's moving into their circle
when SHOTS RING OUT. Everybody on the court instantly
dives to the ground for cover.
148
149
A car speeds off. Patrick raises up, looks around.
Malakai nods. He's okay. Snookie's crawling to the
exit, snot-nosed and crying. He's okay. Then they see
Arvel. Sprawled on the ground. Covered in blood. He
seems lifeless.

walking. A heavy silence. Sara looks over at him.
Patrick doesn't say anything. But after a moment, he
reaches down and takes her hand and they walk on like
this together.

Sara exits, looking pretty much like she feels. Like
shit. She walks a few paces. Sees Patrick. Their eyes
connect for a brief, awful moment before they continue on
their respective ways.
161

Groups of children scatter around worn-out playground
equipment. The gleeful squeal of them is everywhere.
Patrick guides Christopher down a slide; Chenille catches
him at the bottom. Christopher can't get enough of this
ride and Patrick and Chenille repeat the routine
throughout their conversation.
CHENILLE
Why you so quiet?
(off Patrick's
brooding look)
Patrick Reynolds ain't got nothin'
to say? That's a first.
(catches her son
with a whee!; then)
You know how I go off on folks
sometimes. I mean it and then I
don't mean it. Like what I said
to Sara. Guess she told you.
PATRICK
(monotone)
I don't care what you said,
Chenille.
CHENILLE
Patrick. Your ass is on your back
and your lips are on the ground.
You care, baby brother. And not
just about what I said.

You seriously like Sara. She got
a serious jones for you. Am I

I'm sayin' you can't help who you
love, Patrick. At least you found
somebody who loves you back.
Patrick regards Chenille impassively.
Hands Christopher
to her.
PATRICK
I gotta go.
CHENILLE
To where? To who? Malakai?
(sucks her teeth)
You ain't through with that fool
yet.
PATRICK
He's not a fool, Chenille.
CHENILLE
No. You know what? You're the
fool, Patrick. You think you let
Malakai down and all you did was
try to pull yourself up. Ain't no
blame or shame in that.
PATRICK
(very low; a broken smile)
I still gotta go. Check you
later.
Holding Christopher, Chenille watches Patrick walk out of
the playground. Disappear. She and Christopher move on
to a seesaw. Chenille bobs him up and down on one end of
it. She's snuggling in Christopher's face when the other
end suddenly drops to the ground. Chenille looks up.
Sees Kenny.
168

They're side by side on swings. Christopher's nestled
against Kenny's chest, soundly snoozing. They slowly
swing throughout.
KENNY

You were wrong, too. So was I. I
need to do better. Ain't no doubt
about that.
CHENILLE
I know I come down on you hard
about money, but I would rather
you spend the time. Seriously.
KENNY
(jokingly)
So you don't want any money?
CHENILLE
I didn't say all that.
He smiles. Gently rubs Christopher's brow.
Looks at

RAP MUSIC blasts ON the RADIO. No one in the car is
saying anything. Malakai has a "40" between his legs.
He sips from it, passes it to Patrick. Patrick takes a
short swig, passes it back to Lip. As he does this, a
set of keys fall out of his jacket into his lap. Patrick
picks them up. Looks at the key chain, his present from
Sara. He looks at Malakai.
PATRICK
Pull over.
(as Malakai glances at
him, not understanding)
This ain't helpin' nobody, 'Kai.
I'm out. I mean it. Stop the
car.
LIP
Awww, shit.
Here we go.
MALAKAI
(furious)
What you mean you out? You think
I'ma let your punk ass bail on me
again?
Patrick starts to open the door. Malakai speeds up. The
CAR CAREENS down the street, SQUEALS around corners.
Finally comes to a red light. Stops. Patrick starts to
open the door. Malakai grabs him by the jacket. Pulls
his gun. Patrick looks at Malakai and now he sees him.
Sees that he's lost and desperate... and dangerous.

PATRICK
What you gonna do, 'Kai? You
gonna shoot me? Go ahead! You'll
have to!
LIP
Let him out!
We don't need him.
MALAKAI
Shut the fuck up.
Patrick jerks himself loose. Opens the door. Malakai
cocks the gun. Patrick's face flinches at the sound of
it. He can feel it trained on his back as he gets out
the car. But Malakai can't do it. Wouldn't do it. He
takes off like a bat out of hell.

Patrick heads down the street. As he walks, he can hear
the sound of GUNFIRE behind him, and then the sound like
an EXPLOSION. A CAR HORN goes off in a persistent drone.
Patrick stops. Stands there for a moment. Then he's
walking again. Without looking back. And then he's
running away from the mayhem behind him.

The BMW's tangled around a street lamp. Inside Malakai
slumps over the steering wheel, a bullet through his
head.
