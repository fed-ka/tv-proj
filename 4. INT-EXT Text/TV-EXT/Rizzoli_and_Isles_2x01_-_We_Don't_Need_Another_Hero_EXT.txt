CASEY
I was married for awhile. She was a 
soldier. Didn t work out.

JANE
I m sorry.

CASEY
S okay. How come we never finished 
what we started?

JANE
Because you didn t give me the time 
of day until Senior Week. 

CASEY
I was a jerk.

JANE
You were way too cool for me.

CASEY
Truth? You were too scary for me.

JANE
Gee, thanks.

CASEY
I looked cool, but I was like, 12, 
in boy years. You were a force even 
then. Smart, beautiful. Didn t care 
what anybody thought of you.

JANE
Inside, I was a geek.

As they walk toward his car, Abby crosses, on her way to her *
TOWN CAR.  She and Jane trade a wave as they both get to *
their cars.

CLOSE ON: A TOWN CAR AS ITS DOOR OPENS. WE DON T KNOW WHICH *
ONE.

KA-BOOM! CAR EXPLODES...

ACT TWO


It s Abby s car, consumed in a FIREBALL. It s clear she 
didn t survive.  Jane stands ROOTED to the ground, shaking. 
She clutches her side, in pain.*

JANE
Abby...

CASEY
(tries to pull her away)
There might be a second bomb. 

JANE
(still not moving)
We gotta help her...

CASEY
Jane, she s gone...

Cavanaugh, Korsak, Frost, Frankie Jr., ND DETECTIVES, guns 
drawn, RACE from the building, all intently focused.

CAVANAUGH
Get the bomb squad out here! Get 
everybody back.

KORSAK
Frankie, get on the radio. Frost, 
clear the building.

FROST
I ll get the soldiers to help.

CASEY
Private First Class Sherman was in 
that car.

KORSAK
Oh, God...

Casey walks Jane over to steps. She s still clutching her *
side. Maura joins them as SOLDIERS and UNIFORMS jump into *
action. 

MAURA
Jane...you okay?

Jane shakes her head  no.  Maura helps by sending everyone 
away.

MAURA (CONT D)
I got this.

JANE
(whispers)
I feel like I can t move...

MAURA
Tonic immobility.  It s caused by 
extreme fear. 

JANE
I m part of the Rubber Gun Squad. *
Oh my god...That s what we call 
 em. The ones who can t handle the 
street...

MAURA
You ve just had too much trauma at 
once. Your caudal ventrolateral 
region is shutting down. 

Cavanaugh sees Jane.

CAVANAUGH
Get out of here, Rizzoli. You re 
not cleared for duty. Dr. Isles, we 
need you. Frankie!

Frankie runs over.

CAVANAUGH (CONT D)
Get her home. I don t need any more 
casualties.

As Frankie gently helps Jane to her feet -- 

JANE
No...I want to help.


Jane and Maura approach Gary, who is walking toward his car 
in the driveway. He turns as Jane calls his name.

JANE
Private Campbell --

He hesitates just a fraction of a second. Long enough to stay 
alive --

BOOM! HIS CAR EXPLODES.

Jane and Maura rush to him. He s on the ground but okay.

JANE (CONT D)
I don t think this is just about 
Abby.

Off Jane and Maura...
