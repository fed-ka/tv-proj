                                            ACT ONE

      FADE IN:

      EXT. BEACON HILLS - NIGHT11

      Beneath the nearly full moon, down past the winter-bare 
      branches of Beacon Hills s woods, not a blade of grass stirs 
      in the peculiar quiet. Until...

      DEER BURST out of the darkness.

      Hooves pounding leaves to dust, the frightened animals 
      scatter to reveal A DARK FIGURE behind them, moving with a 
      speed that can only be described as supernatural.

      Charging out of the woods and into shadowy streets, the 
      figure races faster and faster--

      EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT22

      Down through the dark, puddle-strewn alleys of the town s 
      industrial sector--

      EXT. SUBURBAN HOME - NIGHT33

      Into a suburban backyard where a BARKING DOG races out, 
      snapping against its chain and then--

      EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT44

      Bounding toward the street, looking as if to collide with 
      oncoming cars. But then a FOOT touches down on the roof of a 
      truck. 

      Time slows as the figure launches into the moonlight to 
      reveal--

      SCOTT MCCALL. Werewolf. But not entirely a wolf tonight. 

      Untransformed, he lopes on bare hands, seemingly racing for 
      his life. But when his palms push off the ground, he blinks 
      and in a BRILLIANT WHITE FLASH-- 

      He sees himself. Somewhere in daylight. Kissing Allison 
      Argent. Lips moving from her mouth to her neck.

      Scott s feet hit the ground, yanking him back to the present. 
      But with another blink, he flashes again to the past.    TEEN WOLF "Episode 201"GOLDENROD DRAFT11/23/112.


      INT. MCCALL CAR - DAY - FLASHBACK55

      Pressed tightly inside the car, Allison draws Scott closer. 
      Hands pulling her shirt up, they kiss ever more urgently as--

      GLASS EXPLODES inside the car, raining down on them. Allison 
      screams as something YANKS Scott through the window.

      EXT. WOODS/DIRT ROAD - DAY - FLASHBACK66

      SLAMMING to the pavement, Scott barely has a moment to gasp 
      when a hand wraps around his throat.

      It s ARGENT, Allison s father, nearly strangling him with one 
      hand while the other aims the barrel of a Desert Eagle at his 
      head. Choking, Scott blinks--

77EXT. BEACON HILLS - NIGHT 

      Back to the present, where he charges forward while the 
      memory of Allison s frightened protests ricochet through his 
      mind.

                                    ALLISON (V.O.)
                      No--don t--don t!

      EXT. WOODS/DIRT ROAD - DAY - FLASHBACK88

      Allison tries to pull her father back.

                                    ALLISON
                    You can t. He saved our lives. Your 
                    life. You can t do this.

      She pushes herself between Scott and the gun.*

                                    ALLISON (CONT D)
                    If you kill him, you kill me. Do 
                    you get it?

      But Argent s grip on Scott s throat only seems to tighten.

                                    ALLISON (CONT D)
                    Let him go and--I ll do whatever 
                    you want. I ll be what you want. 
                    And--and I won t see him again. I 
                    promise. I won t even look at him. 
                    Ever again.

      Finally withdrawing the gun, Argent releases Scott.

                                  ARGENT
                    Never again.    TEEN WOLF "Episode 201"GOLDENROD DRAFT11/23/113.


      EXT. BEACON HILLS - NIGHT99

      Blinking back to the present, Scott bounds off the roof of a 
      garage and soars right through--

      INT. ARGENT HOME/ALLISON S ROOM - NIGHT1010

      Allison s bedroom window. Tumbling across the floor, Scott 
      rolls to a breathless stop at her feet. He peers up at her 
      with a sly grin.

                                  SCOTT
                    How long we got?

                                    ALLISON
                    They ll be gone an hour.*

      And not a second later, they're falling lip-locked onto her 
      bed, tearing at each other's clothes with the carelessness of 
      a teenage couple far too much in love.

      MAIN TITLE: TEEN WOLF

      INT. HOSPITAL/WAITING ROOM - NIGHT1111

        A helium-filled balloon with a Get Well message on it hangs 
      gently in the air. The hand grasping the string belongs to 
      Stiles who slumps on a waiting room couch, passed out.*

                                  STILES
                          (talking in his sleep)
                    Yeah... just like that. No, you 
                    first. Me first?

      Scott s mother, Melissa McCall, watches Stiles with an amused 
      smile. Then turns back to an open room where--*

      INT. HOSPITAL/LYDIA S PATIENT ROOM - NIGHT1212

      A bleary-eyed Lydia struggles out of bed. Her father steps *
      over to assist her.

                                  MR. MARTIN
                    You want help getting in the 
                    shower?*

                                  LYDIA
                    Maybe if I was four and still 
                    taking bubble baths.

                                  MR. MARTIN
                    Right. I ll just wait outside where 
                    it s slightly less sarcastic.    TEEN WOLF "Episode 201"GOLDENROD DRAFT11/23/114.


      INT. HOSPITAL/WAITING ROOM - NIGHT1313

      Closing Lydia s door behind him, Mr. Martin notices Stiles in 
      the waiting room and turns to Melissa.

                                  MR. MARTIN
                    He s been here all night?

                                    MELISSA
                    He s been here all weekend.

      A CLEANING LADY bends down to empty a trash can near Stiles. 

                                  STILES
                          (still talking in his 
                            sleep)
                    You... you re dirty.

      The Cleaning Lady pops up with a bewildered look.

      INT. ARGENT HOME/ALLISON S ROOM - NIGHT1414

      Scott and Allison collide with her dresser, sending a LAMP *
      CRASHING to the floor amid their clothes.*

                                  SCOTT*
                    Sorry.*

      She laughs, kissing him as they fall back to the bed. Covers *
      twisting around them, Allison s hands reach down his lower *
      back, pulling him closer as her bare legs slide up, *
        intertwining with his when--*

      They slip right off the side of the bed, tumbling to the *
      floor.*

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)*
                    That was your fault.*

      Allison laughs again. But then Scott pauses, glancing up.*    TEEN WOLF "Episode 201"GOLDENROD DRAFT11/23/115.

      CONTINUED:1414

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)*
                    Do the right side brakes on your 
                    Dad s SUV squeal a little bit?

                                    ALLISON
                    Yeah.

                                  SCOTT
                    Then we re dead.

      Allison hears the ROAR of a car pulling into the driveway. 
      Scott leaps up, grabbing his clothes.*

                                    ALLISON
                    Oh my God, hurry, hurry.

      They scramble furiously to gather any evidence of his being 
      there when the bedroom door SWINGS OPEN. 

      Victoria Argent steps in. Allison innocently looks up from 
      her bed where she casually reads a book. Alone.

                                    ALLISON (CONT D)
                    If you don t trust me enough to let 
                    me have a lock on my door, the 
                    least you could do is knock.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Did I interrupt something?

                                    ALLISON
                    Just my studying. My life. My *
                      happiness. My will to live.*

      She glances nervously at the broken lamp beside her dresser *
      as Victoria holds up a BLACK DRESS in dry cleaning plastic.*

                                  VICTORIA
                    I picked up your dress for the 
                    funeral tomorrow.

                                    ALLISON
                    You can just leave it on the--

      Her mother yanks the closet doors open. Finding nothing 
      unusual, she hangs the dress while past her--*

      EXT. ARGENT HOME/ROOF - NIGHT1515

      Scott crouches on the roof outside the open bedroom window.    TEEN WOLF "Episode 201"GOLDENROD DRAFT11/23/116.

      CONTINUED:1515

                                    ALLISON
                    Can I get back to my studying now? 
                    Or would you like to do a full body 
                    cavity search?

      Victoria heads for the open window.

                                    ALLISON (CONT D)
                    Mom.

      She peers out while mere inches away, Scott holds still. 
      Finally, Victoria SLAMS the window shut.

      INT. HOSPITAL/LYDIA S PATIENT ROOM - NIGHT1616

      Lydia yanks the shower curtain open and turns on the water. 
      Slipping off the hospital gown, she steps in under the 
      steaming spray.

      While gently gliding her fingers over the still healing BITE *
      in her side, she does not notice--*

      WATER gathering in the tub at her feet as if the drain were 
      clogged. Strangely murky and rising steadily.

      INT. HOSPITAL/CORRIDOR - NIGHT1717

      Outside Lydia's room, both her father and Melissa have 
      stepped away. 

      Down the corridor, Stiles drops change into a VENDING 
      MACHINE. Selecting a candy bar, he waits for it to come *
      tumbling down. But, of course, it gets stuck.

                                  STILES
                      Seriously?

      He taps on the plexiglass window of the machine. The candy 
      bar doesn t budge. So he gives the glass a SMACK. Nothing. He *
      pounds on it with a fist. Still nothing.

      INT. HOSPITAL/LYDIA S PATIENT ROOM - NIGHT1818

      Under the shower s spray, Lydia closes her eyes, unaware that *
      far too much water gathers in the tub, rising over her feet 
      and then to her ankles.

      INT. HOSPITAL/CORRIDOR - NIGHT1919

      Stiles spreads his legs for maximum leverage and awkwardly *
      grips the sides of the vending machine to shake the candy bar 
      loose.    TEEN WOLF "Episode 201"GOLDENROD DRAFT11/23/117.

      CONTINUED:1919

                        Son-of-a-freaking...

      Muttering in irrational fury, he rocks the machine back and *
      forth. Just as the candy bar is almost slipping free--*

      The entire vending machine lurches forward and SLAMS down 
      onto the floor with a THUNDERING CRASH.

      Stiles freezes. He stares down at the very heavy machine now 
      laying on its face right in front of him.

      INT. HOSPITAL/LYDIA S PATIENT ROOM - NIGHT2020

      Having heard the crash, Lydia pulls her head out from the 
      shower. Hearing nothing else, she finally notices the water *
      in the tub has risen past her ankles.

      With an irritated sigh, she kicks a toe at the drain. But the *
      water keeps rising.

      Kneeling down, Lydia reaches into the dirty water with her *
      fingers and slowly pulls up a thin clump of sinewy BLACK *
      HAIR.

      Gagging in disgust as the strands wrap around her fingers, 
      she keeps pulling, digging. Then just as it seems she's *
      grasped the extent of it...

      There appears to be more in the drain. Much more.

      Grasping thick tufts of dirt-caked hair, she keeps pulling, *
      water darkening to black as an impossible sight rises up from 
      the depths--

      THE HEAD OF A WOLF. 

      Its dead eyes gaze up at Lydia who lets loose a torrent of *
      SCREAMING.

      INT. HOSPITAL/CORRIDOR - NIGHT2121

      Stiles snaps his attention from the vending machine when he 
      hears the panicked SHRIEKING. He scrambles over the downed 
      machine, launching himself down the hall.

      INT. HOSPITAL/LYDIA S PATIENT ROOM - NIGHT2222

      Stiles races into the room with Melissa and Mr. Martin 
      rushing right behind him.

                                    MELISSA
                    What the hell was that?

      They gather at the open bathroom door to find the empty 
      shower still running, water flowing off the side of the tub.*

      Window up, the curtains flutter. But there s no sign of *
      Lydia.

      She's gone.

      EXT. ARGENT HOME - NIGHT2323

      Still on the roof outside listening to Allison and her 
      mother, Scott s head snaps up when another SOUND comes 
      hurtling through the wind. 

      A SCREAM. One he recognizes immediately.

                                  SCOTT

      FADE IN:

      EXT. WOODS/CREEK - NIGHT2424

      THE MOON. Two, maybe three days from being full. Strangely, 
      the image of the glowing sphere ripples as if made out of 
      liquid.

      Then the reflection breaks apart and Jackson Whittemore *
      bursts up from the freezing cold water of a creek. 

      He sucks in gulps of air as he splashes about. Shirt ripped, *
      it hangs in tatters from his pale body.

      Then he seems to remember something. Hand moving to his side, 
      he twists around to feel the skin at his lower back. 

      It's there. A gaping, bloody wound. An Alpha Werewolf s bite.

      Water dripping from his moon-glistened torso, he rises to his 
      feet for a better look at the jagged tear in his skin. He *
      gazes on it with a kind of reverence, and then... *

      The beginnings of a smile.

      INT. HOSPITAL/CORRIDOR - NIGHT2525

      Melissa and Mr. Martin follow Sheriff Stilinski and a DEPUTY *
      down the corridor.

      He retreats back, slipping around a confused cluster of 
      HOSPITAL WORKERS staring at a downed VENDING MACHINE.

      In the hospital parking lot, Stiles jumps behind the wheel of 
      his Jeep. Scott sits up in the passenger seat as Stiles hands 
      him Lydia's HOSPITAL GOWN.

                    This is the one she was just

      Stiles slowly nods. Scott follows his worried gaze to spots 
      of DRIED BLOOD on the fabric. Blood from Lydia s bite.

      Scott raises the gown to his nose to catch Lydia s scent as 
      Stiles clicks on the HEADLIGHTS to reveal--

      Allison. She startles both of them as she rushes to the 
      passenger side of the Jeep.

      They both turn to Scott who has his head out the Jeep window, 
      air blasting in his face.

      EXT. BEACON HILLS CEMETERY - NIGHT2828

      Beyond a wrought iron gate in the small Beacon Hills 
      Cemetery, a newly planted headstone reads: Katherine Argent.

      A BACKHOE LOADER eases past. With a HYDRAULIC HISS, it drops 
      a pile of dirt next to the grave.

      Operating the loader from the center of the glass-encased cab 
      is a sixteen year-old named ISAAC LAHEY. Headphones jammed in 
      his ears, hard crunching guitars pound through his head while 
      he works.

      With the grave digging nearly complete, he reaches for the 
      gear shift and glances in the REAR VIEW MIRROR to back up. 

      But then pauses to give a weary look at his BLACK EYE.

      Glancing away with more than a little shame at his own 
      reflection, Isaac shifts to REVERSE.

      The loader backs up. But just as it s rolling to a stop, 
      SOMETHING appears in the glass of the cab.

      A SILHOUETTED FIGURE crouches in between two nearby 
      headstones. It blinks with GLOWING YELLOW EYES.

      INSIDE THE CAB - Isaac shuts off the ignition and removes his 
      headphones. In the quiet, he holds still, as if feeling *
      something watching him...  TEEN WOLF "Episode 201"GOLDENROD DRAFT11/23/1113.

      CONTINUED:2828

      Turning to his right, his eyes jump from headstone to 
      headstone. Nothing there.

      He slowly lets his gaze wander over the cemetery while the 
      only sound in the cab seems to be his ever-shortening breath.

      And then he sees something...

      ILLUMINATED BY THE LOADER S HEADLIGHTS, he spots a HAND over 
      the top of the gravestone. Its fingers taper into animal-like 
      CLAWS. 

                                  ISAAC
                    What the hell...

      As he leans forward to get a better look, the hand slips away 
      from the grave. There s a flash of black behind the stone. A 
      dark figure moves lightning quick through the shadows.

      HEADED RIGHT FOR HIM. 

      It launches forward in a bounding lope. Moving incredibly 
      fast.

      Isaac goes for the ignition to turn the loader back on. But 
      not quickly enough.

      SOMETHING BARRELS right into the loader, sending it tipping 
      up on its tires. The machine SLAMS DOWN on its side right 
      over the open grave.

      The door to the cab clatters open, dropping Isaac into the 
      grave with a TERRIFIED CRY.

      He hits the bottom with a painful thud. Then rolls over to 
      look up at the backhoe loader covering the grave.

      SOMETHING LEAPS ONTO IT, rattling the machine. But then 
      bounds off just as quickly.

      Isaac tries to hold his breath, tries to halt his frightened 
      gasps. Pulling himself back against the dirt wall of the 
      grave, he listens.

      Strange, animal-like sounds come from nearby. A stream of 
      feral growls. Becoming more and more urgent.

      Gathering his courage, Isaac rises up, looking past the edge 
      to see--

      AT A NEARBY GRAVE - A hunched over figure quickly digs and 
      tears at the earth, pulling up a just buried CASKET.  TEEN WOLF "Episode 201"GOLDENROD DRAFT11/23/1114.

      CONTINUED:2828

      Isaac flinches at the thing s HIGH PITCHED, URGENT SHRIEKS. 
      Pulling back into the darkness, he hears the CRACKING and 
      SMASHING of WOOD, sounds of rending and tearing. Until the 
      sounds abruptly--

      STOP.

      Holding still, Isaac hears another GROWL. But this one s an 
      earth-shaking ROAR and clearly not the same animal.

      It's followed by the sound of quick movement. The first 
      creature racing away in terrified retreat, its breathless 
      WHIMPERS giving way to silence again.

      Then the backhoe loader begins to RISE. Incredibly, the 
      entire machine lifts up off the grave and tips back down onto 
      its tires, right side up.

      BLACK BOOTS walk slowly, purposefully around the grave.

      Cowering in the dark, Isaac finally raises his head to gaze 
      up at the powerful and intimidating figure of DEREK HALE 
      standing at the edge.

      Under an eerie quiet, Scott, Allison and Stiles approach the 
      rotted and burned Hale House. Yellow police tape stretches 
      across the windows and door.

      EXT. BEACON HILLS CEMETERY - DAY3030

      The brilliant glow of SUNLIGHT shining down on a ransacked 
      grave. Smashed pieces of a casket lie amid clumps of dirt, 
      barely concealing the remains of a just buried corpse.

                    It s Lahey. Isaac Lahey.

      Sheriff Stilinski looks up from his note pad to Isaac and his 
      father, MR. LAHEY who peers over his wire-rimmed GLASSES with 
      suspicious eyes.

                                  STILINSKI
                    You work for your father, Isaac?

                                  STILINSKI
                      I understand, but I ve got a 
                    missing girl and this is where our 
                    K9 unit led us. She s got no 
                    clothes and if she s still out here 
                    tonight when the temperature really 
                    drops...

                                  ISAAC
                    Sorry, but I didn t see anything.

                                  LAHEY
                    Trust me, if he d seen a naked girl 
                    outside of a computer screen, he d 
                    remember it.

      Lahey laughs derisively while Isaac stares at the ground. 
      Stilinski notices the bruise under the boy s eye.

                                  STILINSKI
                    Isaac, how did you get that black

      Lahey glares at Isaac, waiting for his answer. Stilinski, 
      however, keeps his eyes on the father, gauging his reaction.  TEEN WOLF "Episode 201"GOLDENROD DRAFT11/23/1120.

      Stilinski notices he s lost Isaac s attention. But when he

                    had many grave robberies here?

      Past the smashed wood of the casket he can just glimpse the 
      torn fabric of a dress and the decaying insides of an old

      Distraught and exhausted, Scott and Stiles head to the

                    was missing. And if she did? So 
                    what? It s the most nutritious part

                    Jackson.

      They both turn when they hear the familiar growl of a PORSCHE 
      CARRERA tearing into the parking lot.

      A HOMELESS MAN rifling through a school trash can looks up as 
      the Porsche whips into the space in front of him. 

      Aviators still on, Jackson steps out with his backpack and 
      lacrosse stick.

      Nearby, Jackson smirks at them. Then turns back to his own 
      test where he notices--

      A BLACK SPOT on the sheet of paper. It looks like pen ink. He 
      touches it with his finger, smearing it. And then another 
      SPOT appears.

      His best friend, Danny, taps him.

      Lifting his head up, Jackson touches underneath his nose, 
      just above the lip. He pulls his fingers away to find a 
      strange black fluid on the tips.

      toilet paper, trying to staunch the flow.

      In mere moments, however, the paper is soaked. Dropping it 
      into the toilet, he grabs another handful. Then does it 
      again, and again.

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                    Just give me a second.

      Frantic, Jackson keeps wiping at the blood. Flushing the *
      toilet, he grabs more and more paper as SOMEONE HAMMERS on 
      the door.

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                    I said give me a freaking second, 
                    all right?

      With a METALLIC CRUNCH the lock SNAPS and the door whips 
      open. A powerful hand yanks Jackson out of the stall, 
      pressing him up against the bathroom sinks.

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                    Derek?

      He gazes at Derek Hale, astonished. The blood is now clear of 
      Jackson s face, skin rubbed raw by tissue paper. Derek 
      glances to the stall. Nothing there as well.

                                  DEREK
                    You re looking pale, Jackson. You 
                    feeling okay?

                                    JACKSON
                    Never better.

      He shrugs free of Derek s grip.

      Jackson notices Derek s eyes have turned to the mirror. He 
      follows his gaze and in the reflection, Jackson sees a drip 
      of inky BLACK BLOOD slipping out of his ear down his neck.

      Derek grabs him by the chin, pulling his face to the side to 
      get a better look. Then he grabs one of Jackson s hands to 
      see the BLACK STAINS on his fingers.

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)

                    Why?

      Equally disturbed by the sight, Derek looks him in the eye.

                                  DEREK
                    I don t know.

      Jackson puts a hand to his ear. It comes away dripping with 
      the strange black liquid.

                    What is it?

      But Derek just backs away, slowly shaking his head. As he 
      inches toward the door, the shadows seem to envelope him.  TEEN WOLF "Episode 201"GOLDENROD DRAFT11/23/1127.

      FADE IN:

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/CORRIDOR - DAY3535

      Under the CLANG of the end of day BELL, Allison takes her 
        plastic-covered black funeral dress from her locker. Then 
      notices something wedged into one of the locker s vents.*

      A NOTE. She pulls it out, unfolding it to find a short but 
      meaningful message: Because I love you.*

      DOWN THE CORRIDOR - Scott watches her read the note. Clearly 
      pleased by the reaction it draws, he retreats back around the 
      corner so as not to be seen by any witnesses.

      When Allison closes her locker, a handsome teenager named 
      MATT smiles at her. His own locker next to hers, he slides an 
      expensive professional digital CAMERA back into its case.

                                  MATT
                    Nice dress.

                    Um. Thanks.

      He s still smiling. Noticeably flirtatious. But then VOICES *
      turn Allison s head. Girls across the corridor.

      Allison SLAMS her locker closed, silencing them. But only for 
      a moment. Titters of suppressed laughter send Allison 
      hurrying down the corridor, almost breaking into a run.

      UNTIL SOMEONE GRABS HER, pulling her into--

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/CLASSROOM - DAY3636

      A dark classroom. Allison spins around to face Scott.

      Allison shakes her head, trying to hold back the tears.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    It s going to be okay. We re going *

                    You go first.

      Scott opens the door. As Allison steps out she lets her hand 
      rest over his on the edge of the door. Their fingers 
      intertwine for the briefest moment.

      When they break apart, Scott closes the door, leaning against 
      it as if pressed back by worry. He glances up at the CLOCK 
      which reads--

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/CHEMISTRY CLASS - DAY3737

      3:59. Below the clock, Mr. Harris grades papers while Stiles 
      sits at a desk trying to will the clock hands to move faster. 
      Finally, the hour hand hits 4 and Stiles jumps up.

      Harris says his name with barely concealed hatred as he 
      approaches to look down on him.

      people with cameras behind A-Frame barricades. At the same 
      time, Argent attempts to lead his family to the funeral site.

      faces.

                    Just sit down, sweetheart.

      Someone with a camera manages to slip between two barricades. 
      It's Matt, the kid from school who complimented Allison's 
      dress.

      Snapping pictures, he doesn t see THE HAND reach up to grab 
      the lens. The camera comes right out of Matt's grasp and into 
      the hands of an older, rather menacing looking well-dressed 
      man named GERARD.

      Matt turns to see THREE OTHER WELL-DRESSED MEN also standing 
      around him. Practically surrounding him.

                                  GERARD
                    This looks expensive.

                                  MATT
                    Nine hundred dollars.

      With a click, the MEMORY CARD slips out of a slot in the 
      camera and into Gerard's hand. 

                                  GERARD
                    How expensive is this?

      He SNAPS the memory card in half. Then with a smile, he drops 
      the camera back into Matt s hands.

      While Allison watches, the older man walks over to Argent and 
      puts his arms around him in a warm embrace.

                    I know what they are. They re 
                      reinforcements.

      Then, out of nowhere, a PAIR OF HANDS yanks them up.

                    The two of you. Unbelievable.

      Furious, he drags them away from the funeral proceedings and 
      to his patrol car.

      Scott and Stiles sit in the back while Sheriff Stilinski 
      talks with a panicked DEPUTY over the radio.

      FADE IN:

      EXT. ROADSIDE - NIGHT4040

      Shrouded by trees, Stiles s Jeep sits on a dirt path. A few 
      yards ahead, Scott and Stiles keep low to the ground as they 
      approach flashing RED and BLUE LIGHTS.*

      Peering out through the branches, they spot the AMBULANCE on 
      the opposite side of the road. Moving from tree to tree, 
      Scott and Stiles slowly catch a view of the blood-spattered 
      interior.

      A seriously freaked out AMBULANCE DRIVER appears to be trying 
      to explain what happened to an equally freaked out DEPUTY. 

                                  STILES
                          (also disturbed)
                    What the hell s Lydia doing?*

                                  SCOTT
                    I don t know.

                                  STILES
                    What kept you from doing that? Was 
                    it Allison?

                                  SCOTT
                    I hope so.

                                  STILES
                    Do you--Do you need to get closer?

      Scott closes his eyes for a brief second. He pulls in a deep 
      breath and then shakes his head.

                                  SCOTT
                    No. I got it.

                                  STILES
                    Okay, just... I need you to find *
                    her, all right? Please, just find *
                    her.

      With a nod, Scott backs away. Catching the scent in the air, 
      he begins to run.

      EXT. WOODS - NIGHT4141

      Pounding the earth beneath his feet, Scott's eyes start to 
      burn with a YELLOW GLOW.   TEEN WOLF "Episode 201"GOLDENROD DRAFT11/23/1136.

      CONTINUED:4141

      Propelling himself through the darkness, the transformation 
      begins to take hold.

      His ears taper to points. Hair rises on his cheeks. Teeth *
      form into fangs.*

      Racing so fast, the world around him blurs out of focus. He *
      goes down to lope on all fours. No longer just a teenager-- *

      But a werewolf.

      EXT. WOODS/HIGH ABOVE - NIGHT4242

      From the treetops above, Scott can be seen, a lone, dark 
      figure moving incredibly fast. Leaping over fallen trees, 
      darting around thick pines.

      SOMETHING appears in frame just ahead of him. Another loping *
      creature. And from its form, clearly HUMAN.

      As Scott gains ground, catching up to the second werewolf, he 
      leaps forward and--

      EXT. WOODS - NIGHT4343

      Launching off the side of a tree, Scott soars up.

                                  SCOTT
                    Lydia!

      He lashes out at the dark figure ahead and both of them go 
      tumbling to the forest floor.

      Crashing and rolling to a stop through the leaves and brush, 
      Scott instantly leaps back to his feet as--

      The dark figure charges toward him.

      Barely able to see in the darkness, Scott, nevertheless, 
      moves with uncanny speed. Claws out, he pushes up, sending 
      the other werewolf right over his head.

      The monster crashes to the ground in a flurry of dust and 
      leaves. When it twists around to bare its teeth, Scott gets a 
      surprise.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    You re not Lydia.

      This werewolf, in fact, isn't even female. Dark clothes 
      ragged and dirty, the creature has a feral quality. Sickly, 
      even pathetic.  TEEN WOLF "Episode 201"GOLDENROD DRAFT11/23/1137.

      CONTINUED:4343

      It scrambles back in fear as Scott steps forward. Passing 
      through a shadow, he transforms back to his human self.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Who are you?

      Using Scott's moment of confusion, it retreats with a hiss 
      and darts into the shadows.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Wait--

      But the creature is already moving. And moving fast.

      EXT. ROADSIDE - NIGHT4444

      The RED AND BLUE LIGHTS on the ambulance continue flashing. 
      But the perspective is from the woods. Moving slowly, 
      shakily, as if being drawn to the light.

      It approaches to see not only the Driver but several 
      Deputies, Stilinski and Stiles. All trying to make sense of 
      the bloodied interior of the vehicle.

      A pale, dirty HAND pulls down a branch to get past. Stiles is *
      the first to notice the shivering girl in the woods.*

                                  STILES
                    Lydia?

      The voice sounds far away at first. But when the call comes 
      again, the name crystallizes, hitting the girl like a shock.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Lydia?

      Arms covering herself, she blinks. With brush and tree leaves 
      barely concealing her lower half, she finds herself looking 
      at Stilinski, his Deputies, the Driver and a very wide-eyed 
      Stiles.

      Lydia stares at them in confusion. They stare back. Everyone 
      staring uncomfortably. Finally, Lydia throws up her arms, 
      revealing her frustration... among other things.

                                  LYDIA
                    Well? Anyone going to get me a 
                    coat?

      Grasping for his father's jacket as his knees go weak, Stiles 
      collapses out of frame.  TEEN WOLF "Episode 201"GOLDENROD DRAFT11/23/1138.


      EXT. WOODS/CREEK - NIGHT4545

      Charging out of the darkness, Scott SPLASHES through the 
      creek where Jackson first woke. He spots the second werewolf 
      going up the bank.

                                  SCOTT
                    Wait! Stop!

      As the creature crests the hill it never notices--

      THE TRIPWIRE.

      CORD WHIPS THROUGH THE AIR. Yelping, the werewolf's head *
      snaps around in yellow-eyed terror as he goes up, hands 
      lassoed above him.

      When Scott starts forward to help him, TWO HANDS grab him by *
      his jacket and yank him back. Lifted right off his feet, 
      Scott goes flying.

      HE SLAMS INTO A TREE. Then falls, slumping into the dirt as 
      TWO GLOWING RED EYES seep out from the shadows.

      Derek pulls him to his feet, dragging him back into the cover 
      of the woods.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    What are you doing? I can help him.

                    Quiet.

      Scott stops struggling. He hears movement. BOOTS crushing 
      leaves. Then he sees them...

      THE HUNTERS arrive, bursting through the mist to find their 
      prey caught and hanging helplessly.*

      Argent approaches with several men behind him. One in 
      particular takes his time: his father, Gerard.  TEEN WOLF "Episode 201"GOLDENROD DRAFT11/23/1139.

      Argent withdraws a STUN BATON. With a sharp flick of his 
      wrist it telescopes out, CRACKLING with BLUE BOLTS of 
        ELECTRICITY.

      The trapped werewolf SNARLS in fear as--

      Argent whips the baton up and connects the tip to its body. A 
      BLUE FLASH briefly LIGHTS the woods as the werewolf s CRY 
      turns to a very human SCREAM.

      In the blink of an eye, the wolf is transformed back into a 
      man. One immediately familiar to Scott...

      It s the Homeless Man who was rifling through the trash at 
      school. The one who told Jackson he had a nice car.

                    You re not from here, are you? Are 
                    you?

      Terrified, the Homeless Man shakes his head.

                                  HOMELESS MAN
                    No. No, I came--I came looking for 
                    the Alpha.

      Argent and Gerard share a look.

                    I heard rumors, I heard there was--

      whips the blade around. Right across the torso of the 
      Homeless Man.

      Scott LURCHES forward. With every ounce of his strength, 
      Derek pulls him back, arms wrapped around Scott as he gasps 
      at the shocking display of violence.
