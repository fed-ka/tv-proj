      EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT

      The City by the Bay is quiet this night as fog rolls in 
      under the Golden Gate Bridge.  An aerial shot: Trocodero 
        Plaza, PAC BELL, Lombard Street, past a cable car...the 
        camera lands on the world-famous Transamerica building...


      INT. TRANSAMERICA - NIGHT

      CLOSE ON a bottle of Dom Perignon as the cork explodes across 
        a large office CELEBRATION... FREDDY BROUGHTON, 48, tall, 
      fit, with an expensive haircut and tailored clothing, stands 
        before the office full of smiling people holding wine, 
        champagne, and small plates of food.  His brother, BILL 
        BROUGHTON, stands near him, less jubilant and somewhat 
        pensive, but with a smile and a glass of champagne, 
        nonetheless. Waiters carrying hors d'oeuvres trays wait 
        quietly as the employees listen to Freddy s speech. 

                                    FREDDY 
                      ...we ve submitted the filing, and 
                    in a few more days the Peterson 
                      merger will be complete!  

        Someone in the back WHOOPS loudly and there s a smattering 
      of laughter from the crowd.  Freddy smiles.

                                    FREDDY (CONT D)
                      Thank you for all your hard work 
                      these past few months, from Bill... 
                          (he gestures toward Bill)
                        ...and me. This is what we ve all 
                      been working for since the day we 
                      started this company. Give 
                      yourselves a pat on the back, and 
                      enjoy the party!

      The employees erupt into loud cheers and clapping.  WE PICK 
      UP ANNIE RYAN, beautiful, trim, 26, dressed in a pencil 
      skirt and sequined top, her hair twisted into a fancy knot 
      at the nape of her neck, as she hovers at the outer edge of 
      the party. Though dressed festively, her large, dark eyes 
      are unhappy. She grabs a glass of champagne from a passing 
        waiter, downs it and grabs another before quickly moving 
      into the deserted, half-lit hallway.  The sounds of her 
        coworkers partying and laughing, music, and glasses clinking 
        filters in from the other room. She presses the elevator 
        button many times...finally punching it with frustration. 
      She finishes her champagne in a single gulp and sets the 
      glass on the floor while she waits for the doors to open.                                                                                      2.


      INT. PENTHOUSE FLOOR - NIGHT 

      Annie moves down the hallway. Swaying a little, unsteady 
      from the champagne. A noise causes her to turn around.  

                                    ANNIE 
                      What are you doing here?  


      EXT. TRANSAMERICA BUILDING - NIGHT

      On the street below...a homeless woman s squeaky carriage is 
      the only sound that emanates from the quiet streets of the 
        Financial District..SUDDENLY, a body FLIES from the twenty-
      fifth floor of the office building, plummeting head-over-
        heels, like a rag-doll. The body floats, dream-like, until 
      it lands on Merchant Street with an ALL-TOO-REAL-THUD.  An 
        amoeba-shaped pond of blood spreads from her torso...ANNIE 
        RYAN S life is over. 


      INT. CENTRAL STATION - SAN FRANCISCO POLICE DEPARTMENT - NIGHT 

      We find Captain ED ROLLINS, 45, grey at the temples,  
        chastising an officer as he reads from a list of complaints. 

                                    ED 
                      ...illegal search and 
                        seizure...lack of probable cause...

      He turns the page of the document.  

                                    ED (CONT D)
                      ...officer brutality... failure to 
                      read a suspect their rights....  

      The Officer being admonished is still out of sight -- up to 
      now, we ve only heard his grunts of disdain at the charges.

                                    ED (CONT D)
                        ...operating undercover without 
                        authorization....breaking and 
                      entering... 

                                    OFFICER (O.S.)
                      ...that nutcase had two people tied 
                    up in his basement....Are you 
                        finished...?

      He s not.  He turns the page again and continues:

                                    ED
                        ...assaultinga fellow officer... 
                      searching premises without a 
                      warrant ...                                                                                      3.


      As the camera circles around, we the see the POLICE CAPTAIN 
      is talking to a man in a wheelchair. This is DETECTIVE 
        ROBERT IRONSIDE: MASCULINE, TOUGH, INTENSE...CRIPPLED.  

                                    ED (CONT D)
                      ...this has gotta stop... While we 
                      all appreciate your results -- 
                      there are rules. You know what they 
                      are, and they need to be followed. 

      The fact that Ironside is confined to a wheelchair has in no 
      way diminished his intensity, and all his anger is currently 
        focused into a smoldering glower directed at TONY CRESTIN, 
      the ASSISTANT DA, who stands 5  5  on a good day. 

                                    TONY
                      You might not want to hear this, 
                      but criminals have rights.  So do 
                      your fellow officers.  But you 
                      treat everyone like they re guilty.  

        Finally, Ironside speaks.  

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      Everyone s guilty of something, Mr. 
                      D.A.  I mean, Mister Assistant.
                            (Tony steams)
                      Some break the speed limit, some 
                      are peeping toms, and some have a 
                      love-nest in Haight-Ashbury above 
                      the Blue Parrot that no one, most 
                      notably his wife, knows about.

                                    TONY
                      You prick.

                                    IRONSIDE 
                    In the streets, you gotta do what you 
                      gotta do...and nothing s changed 
                      since I ve been sitting in here....

                                    ED
                      I ve been in the streets.  I was in 
                      the streets with you.  

                                    IRONSIDE
                            (not stopping, to Tony)
                      ...And as far as the other officers 
                      go, if they were doing their jobs 
                      correctly, I wouldn t be infringing 
                    on their  rights.   

      The CAPTAIN wearily sits, his face pleading.  

                                    ED
                      Listen, Bob, I know this hasn t been 
                      easy... 
                                    (MORE)                                                                                      4.

                                    ED (CONT'D)
                            (the wheelchair, but won t 
                            say it)
                      ...butcan you, for once, gimme a break? 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      Who s gonna give me one? 

                                    TONY
                      You mean, other than your huge 
                      settlement and reinstatement?

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      That wasn t given to me. I took what was 
                      rightfully mine in a court of law.   

                                    TONY
                      You re lucky you have a good lawyer. 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      You re lucky I m in this chair. 

                                    ED
                      Tony, will you give us a minute please? 

        Frustrated, Tony grabs his stuff and exits. 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      Why don t you tell me the real reason 
                      I m here, Ed. Unless you re going to 
                      fire me again, I ve got work to do. 

                                    ED
                          (a guilty smile)
                      You were always smarter than 
                      me...and we did not fire you. 
                            (then)
                      You re here because I m going to do 
                      youa favor. 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      This should be good. 


      EXT. TRANSAMERICA BUILDING - NIGHT 

        A section of the parking lot is cordoned off by yellow CRIME 
      SCENE TAPE.  The crowd parts like the Red Sea as MARLEY, 
        walking next to Ironside, moves through the chaos. MARLEY, 
      5  10 , a statuesque beauty, is, we will come to see, all 
        things to Ironside -- but mostly the sobering yang to his 
        raging yin.  

      She and Ironside head toward the building, where they are 
        IMMEDIATELY flanked by two DETECTIVES who seem to have 
        appeared out of nowhere. By the way they re dressed, THEY 
        APPEAR to have been summoned from other engagements...                                                                                       5.


        TEDDY, 30, is unusually stylish for a police officer in 
        expensive designer boots and jeans; and VIRGIL, 35, whose 
        reputation as one of the toughest cops in the city might be 
      hard to see at this moment, as he s wearing a black leather 
        jacket over a pajama shirt, his sleepy face still marked with 
      sheet lines. We walk along with them as they make their way 
        through the CROWD, when a third member of their team parts 
      the mass of people like a linebacker... 

                                    HOLLY (O.S.)
                      Outta the way!  Watch it! 

        ...but she s a petite, beautiful detective who looks like 
      she just came from a date. Holly, 28, fresh-faced; 
        energetic. 

                                    HOLLY (CONT D)
                          (to Virgil)
                      Nice pajamas.  I can t believe the 
                      Mrs. let you out after dark. 

                                    VIRGIL
                      Nice lipstick.  What was his name? 

                                    HOLLY
                      Steve Something.  He thinks I m in 
                      the bathroom. 
                            (winks at him)
                      He ll wait. 

                                    TEDDY
                            (looking up)
                      I vowed never to set foot in an 
                      investment bank again. 

                                    HOLLY
                      Why?  Do you have your trust fund 
                      money delivered to your house? 

                                    TEDDY
                      Something like that. 

        Ironside and his team glide by the sheet-covered body, each 
      of them taking a long look as they pass, continuing toward 
      the building s entrance. 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                            (looking up)
                    It happened a few hours ago.  Her 
                      employers are big donors to the 
                      Mayor, who s the reason we re here 
                      now. That s all we know at the 
                      moment. Get moving.  

      And, just like that, their group splinters as quickly as 
      they formed -- not needing to be told what to do, they move 
      out to do their jobs.  Virgil melts back into the crowd as 
      he moves to check the perimeter;                                                                                       6.


      Teddy approaches the security desk; Holly takes the stairs, 
      and Ironside heads to the elevator.  He watches his team 
      with pride -- though he would never admit it to them. 


      INT. BRADLEY FINANCIAL - PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

        Bradley Financial is abuzz with activity, everyone wearing 
      grave expressions and fancy dress. Ironside MOVES down the 
      hall, Marley by his side. 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      These are the people responsible 
                      for the financial collapse.  I wish 
                      they d all take a flying leap.

                                    MARLEY
                      I thought we talked about keeping some 
                    of those opinions to ourselves.

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      Youtalked about it.  

      They continue down the hallway, passing a swarm of Blues, 
        Security, Wealthy Executives, and COPS.  They all stare at 
        Ironside -- he s grown both accustomed to and weary of this, 
      but he knows how to use it to put people off-balance. 

                                    IRONSIDE (CONT D)
                      What s wrong with you people? 
                      Haven t any of you seen a guy in a 
                      wheelchair?  Dr. Strangelove?  
                      Lebowski?  FDR? 

      ED APPROACHES.  

                                    IRONSIDE (CONT D)
                            (looking around)
                      You call this a favor? I thought I 
                      graduated from suicides in first grade.

                                    ED
                      A little love from the mayor s office 
                      will get that little prick DA off both 
                      our backs.  

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      There s the Ed I know and love.  

        FREDDY BROUGHTON approaches. He s still put-together, smooth 
      and articulate, calm even though everyone around him is 
        frazzled and upset.  

                                    FREDDY
                      I m Freddy Broughton, the Managing 
                      Director.  Thank you for coming, 
                      Detective.  The Mayor assured me 
                      you re the best man on the force.                                                                                        7.


                                    IRONSIDE 
                      I used to be.  

                                    ED
                    He still is. 

                                    FREDDY
                      We re all shocked.  I didn t know the 
                      young lady very well, but we do like to 
                      think of ourselves as one big family. 

      He points to the PHOTO on the wall of the entire company at 
      their Company Picnic. 

                                    IRONSIDE
                      She jumped from her office? 

                                    FREDDY
                      Apparently.  

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      I d like to see it.  

                                    FREDDY
                            (pointing to a door)
                    Of course, it s that one.  My 
                      brother and I asked our Office 
                      Manager, Claire, to join us -- she 
                      knows more about this place than 
                      both of us combined.  We ll be 
                      right down the hall when you re 
                      ready to speak with us.  

        Freddy walks off.  Ironside eyes him. 

                                    ED
                      What? 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      Nothing.  

                                    ED
                      I know that look. 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      You re paranoid. 

                                    ED
                      I wonder how I got that way. 


      INT. ANNIE S OFFICE - NIGHT 

        Ironside stares at a picture of Annie with some friends on 
      a  ski trip.  Radiant smiles.  Checks out her desk, 
        drawers, looks at her calendar.  He picks up a few 
        scattered notes.                                                                                      8.


      He moves to the terrace that wraps around the entire top 
        floor, and using his strong arms, props himself up and 
      looks over the edge.  A little more and he could go over.  
      Does he want to?  He closes his eyes and drifts slightly 
        forward.  A voice breaks the silence.

                                    HOLLY (O.S.)
                      Hey. 

      He snaps out of it and finds Holly standing behind him. 

                                    HOLLY (CONT D)
                      They re getting really pissed over 
                      there. 

      He sees Freddy and others waiting impatiently through the 
      glass offices.

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      Good.  That s how we want them. 
                            (then)
                      Whaddya got? 

                                    HOLLY
                      The deceased was Annie Ryan, twenty-
                      six. Berkeley undergrad. Stanford 
                      MBA. Grew up in Fresno.  Worked 
                      here about year as an associate. 
                      Lived in the outer Sunset area.

      Teddy pops into the office. 

                                    TEDDY
                      Even for parties and other events, 
                      you d need a key card to access 
                      this floor.  Only employees have 
                      them.  No one besides her seemed to 
                      come up here.  

                                    IRONSIDE 
                          (to Teddy)
                      How much would an associate make at 
                      a place like this? 

                                    TEDDY
                      Eighty, ninety, maybe?  Long hours, 
                      money s in the long con for these guys.  

        Ironside eyes a few expensive boxes (Tiffany s, etc.) on 
      her desk. Virgil enters from the terrace.   

                                    VIRGIL
                      She either climbed over or got pushed.  
                    No way she just fell  less she was 
                      doing gymnastics on the rail.                                                                                       9.


      OMAR - THE HEAD SECURITY OFFICER for Bradley Financial, 
        wearing a dark suit and a discreet earpiece, approaches.  
      He takes his well-paid job very seriously.   

                                    OMAR
                            (stern, deep voice )
                      Mr. Broughton is waiting to see 
                      you. 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      Who are you?

                                    OMAR
                      I m head of security...

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      She was the only one on the floor 
                    at this time, that correct? 

                                    OMAR
                            (very serious)
                      That s what the log says. 

        Ironside stares at him intently -- as if he s seeing into 
        Omar s soul.  Then smiles. 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                            (stern, deep voice - 
                              mocking him,)
                      Lead the way. 


      INT. FREDDY BROUGHTON S OFFICE - DAY

        Ironside is facing Freddy, his brother, BILL, 45, and 
        OFFICE MANAGER CLAIRE SESSIONS.  They re unnerved -- 
        partially due to exhaustion, but even more so because 
        Ironside s team: VIRGIL, TEDDY, HOLLY and MARLEY are all 
        standing behind him just staring at them while Ironside 
        talks.  

                                    BILL
                            (looking stricken)
                      It s such a tragedy.  She had a big 
                      future ahead of her here. She put 
                    in so much work toward the merger.

        Ironside studies all of them with narrowed eyes, silently 
        judging them, keeping them on-edge.  

                                    CLAIRE
                      They say it s the ones you least 
                      expect.  

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      Who says that?                                                                                        10.


                                    CLAIRE
                            (nervous, glancing at the 
                            cops in the back)
                      Um...I just heard it, I guess.  

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      You shouldn t believe everything 
                      you hear.
                            (then, already knowing the 
                              answer)
                      So, what do you guys do here? 

                                    BILL
                      We re investment advisors. 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      You tell people where to put their 
                      money...
                            (they nod)
                      But you get paid whether they win 
                    or lose?  Pensions.  Life Savings.   

                                    FREDDY
                            (annoyed, tired)
                    We work mostly with institutions.  
                      Some private clients.  Detective, 
                      it s late. I d like to get home to 
                    my family... 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                            (cutting him off)
                      A cop s salary wouldn t warrant an 
                      account here?  

                                    BILL
                            (quick to talk)
                      It s not like that... we work with 
                      all levels of investors.  

        Freddy looks at his brother with loathing... 

                                    FREDDY
                            (checking his watch)
                    As you can see, Detective, it s been a 
                      long night and this  event  has thrown 
                      our office into complete chaos, but I 
                      want to thank you again for coming out.  

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      I just have one question for you 
                        gentleman....and lady.   

                                    FREDDY
                            (standing, ready to leave)
                      Please. 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      Which one of you was sleeping with her?                                                                                       11.


      They look at him with expressions of shock, annoyance and a 
        little trepidation.  What have we gotten ourselves into?  

                                    FREDDY
                      That s out of line.  

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      I ve never been a stay-in-the-lines 
                      kinda guy.

                                    FREDDY
                      I think I can safely say neither of 
                      us.  We re both happily married men. 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      Ms. Sessions? 

                                    CLAIRE
                        I wasn t...sleeping with anyone. 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      Ever?  Waiting for Mr. Right?  
                      You re not one of those...?

                                    CLAIRE
                      No...I m...
                            (then, realizing)
                      ...one of what?

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      You were saying about sleeping with 
                      someone...

      He glances inconspicuously toward the brothers. 

                                    CLAIRE
                      I meant here, I thought that s what 
                      you meant.  

      Her eyes move to Ironside s team, who look quite 
        intimidating.  

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      Okay, we have it, then.  Three nos.  
                          (to Nobody in particular)
                      Write that down.  
                            (then, turning back to the 
                              Broughtons)
                      Thank you for your time. 

      Their eyes flit from Ironside to the other cops. Ironside 
      nods, and he and his team file out of the room like a jury 
        leaving the box.                                                                                        12.


        HALLWAY - NIGHT/DAWN

        Ironside s team flanks his chair like storm troopers as they 
      move toward the elevator.  Ironside winks at Omar -- 
        standing at attention...Ed hustles to catch them as the door 
        opens.  

                                    ED
                      Where are you going? 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      I m closing the suicide.

      Ed seems pleased.  

                                    IRONSIDE (CONT D)
                      And opening a murder investigation. 

      The doors close.  Ed puts his hands in his face.  Curses 
      under his breath.

      THE SOUND OF FEET POUNDING AND HARSH BREATHING, THE MUTED

      INT. TRACEY S CAR, STREETS OF SAN FRANCISCO - DAY - FLASHBACK 

      Close up on the face of the SWEATING, WILD-EYED DRIVER, 
        TRACEY, -- He glances in his rearview mirror and does a 
        double-take when he sees an ENRAGED MAN RUNNING FULL-SPEED 
        TOWARD HIM: DETECTIVE ROBERT IRONSIDE.

        A TITLE READS: TWO YEARS EARLIER

      NOTE: FLASHBACKS WILL BE SHOT HAND HELD

        Tracey JUMPS OUT, a CANNON-sized gun in one hand, abandons 
      his car and sprints away through traffic.  

        Ironside flies down the CENTER of the street, dodging 
        vehicles, SINGULARLY FOCUSED ON Tracey, who turns and FIRES 
      at him, but Ironside doesn t flinch as he CHARGES 
        ahead...car windows EXPLODE As Tracey fires again... 
        IRONSIDE S PARTNER, GARY, TRIES TO KEEP UP... TRACEY RUNS 
      INTO A BUILDING -- Ironside GIVES CHASES -- 


      INT. BUILDING STAIRWELL - DAY 

        Tracey is climbing the stairs, stopping to shoot down at 
        Ironside -- but Ironside keeps climbing -- 


      EXT. ROOF TOP BUILDING - DAY 

        Tracey barrels out of the door, but Ironside is right on his 
        heels... and tackles him in the middle of the roof.  They 
        wrestle, snarling like wild animals... Ironside fights dirty 
      and hard, clawing at TRACEY s face as he climbs on top of 
      him.  They roll over several times.  Gary, picks up a piece 
      of wood and slams it over Tracey s head.  Tracey s done, but 
        Ironside s not...

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      Come on.  

        Ironside drags Tracey, by the hair, to the edge of the 
        building. 

                                    GARY
                      Throw him over.  Make it quick.                                                                                       14.


      -- and hangs him over the side-- 

                                    TRACEY
                      Man, don t do this! 

        Ironside holds his leg.  Tracey screams as coins, a comb, 
      and a wallet spill from his pockets, plummet toward the 
        street below.  Ironside shakes Tracey, could drop him at any 
      time.

                                    IRONSIDE
                      We re looking for Enrico Gonzalez. 
                      Where is he?  

                                    TRACEY
                      I don t know, man.  I swear.  I 
                      never met him.  No one has.  I tell 
                      you everything I know. 

      The pants tear... Tracey drops a little more...

                                    IRONSIDE
                      Gary, you think he s telling the 
                      truth? 

      Gary shrugs signifying he could care either way.  Ironside 
      let s him fall further.  Tracey screams. 

                                    TRACEY
                      Okay!  Okay!!

                                                            FADE TO: PRESENT DAY


      INT. SF SALOON - NIGHT - PRESENT DAY 

        Ironside sits at the bar, his home-away-from home, drinking 
        a beer: Locals REGGIE, CHARLIE, STEVIE are with him.  A 
        WAITRESS walks by and squeezes Ironside s shoulder to say 
       hi  ... he smiles back at her.  He s obviously a regular 
      here. The 49ers play on the television and Ironside is 
        eyeing the action as he talks. 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      They re sitting there in their tailored 
                      suits with their pocket hankies looking 
                    at us like we re goddamn mailmen or 
                        something...I say,  So which one of you 
                      guys is sleeping with her ...they nearly 
                      shit themselves... looked at me like I 
                      just felt up their sister. 

                                    CHARLIE
                      We re watching the game. Do I spend 
                      the whole time talking about work?                                                                                      15.


                                    IRONSIDE 
                      Why would anyone give rat s ass about 
                      a window installer s day?  Now shut 
                      up, Charlie, I m telling a story.

      The COWBOYS score a touchdown.  THE WHOLE BAR GROANS.  

                                    IRONSIDE (CONT D)
                      Goddamn it.  Every time I bet on 
                      this team my stomach is in knots.
                          (to Charlie)
                      You jinxed  em. 
                            (Charlie hangs his head)
                      C mon, you know I love you.  

      He grabs Charlie s head, pulls him toward him and kisses 
      him.  Charlie smiles.  A Cowboys FAN at the other side of 
      the bar cheers and claps loudly.  A beer mug nearly hits him 
      -- careening off the Bar Post.  He turns.  Looks at IRONSIDE 
        - clearly the culprit. The Chair. SAYS NOTHING.  Dave, the 
          OWNER/Bartender, grabs some empties from the table. 

                                    DAVE
                      Hey, take it easy, Bobby.  

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      Eh!  He should know better.  Tell him 
                    to go to Fudruckers or Chili s, that 
                        sonofabitch. 

                                    DAVE
                            (with a smile)
                      And don t you be wheeling home drunk 
                    in that thing again...you might get 
                      pulled over by some bastard cop. 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      You should have been a comedian. 

                                    DAVE
                      And you shoulda ducked. 

        That s exactly how Ironside wants his friends to talk to 
      him. Stevie, carrying a handful of darts, moves over. 

                                    STEVIE
                      Hey, we re up next, get ready. 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                    We already kicked their asses three 
                      times.  They re looking for more?   

                                    STEVIE
                      They want to double the stakes. 

        A SEXY GIRL MOVES PAST.                                                                                       16.


                                    SEXY GIRL
                      Hey, Ironside. 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      Brandy. 

                                    STEVIE
                      Don t tell me you...?

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      You know I d never say anything to 
                      you reprobates. 

                                    STEVIE
                      Damn!  Does she have any friends 
                      for me? 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      Not who want to catch syphilis. 

      They all laugh. Dave notices someone at the door. 

                                    DAVE
                      Bob, Gary s wife is here again. 

        Ironside s laughter ceases.  He turns to sees PENNY STANTON, 
      36, standing by the door.   

                                    DAVE (CONT D)
                      I guess he s not doing any better. 

                                    IRONSIDE
                      Stevie, I m gonna sit this one out.
                            (waiving her over)
                      Pen?

      She seems him waving.  Relieved.  She heads over.

                                    IRONSIDE (CONT D)
                      He s at it again?  

      Penny starts to talk, but chokes up and can t continue.  


      EXT. WHEEL HOUSE - DAY 

      The free-standing annex with more-than-required wheelchair 
        access is known as the Wheel House, and is separated from 
      the main Police Headquarters by a small green. 


      INT. WHEEL HOUSE - DAY 

      The room is laid out more like a frat house than a police 
      room where murders are solved.  Pool table. Card tables.  A 
        HOCKEY GAME.  The team is gathered...but Virgil and Teddy 
      play pool while they work.                                                                                       17.


                                    IRONSIDE 
                      So, what do we have here?  A pretty girl 
                      goes to a party, has a few drinks...  

                                    HOLLY
                    Or more than a few. 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      Okay, more than a few, but then goes 
                    up to her top floor office and pulls 
                      a Greg Louganis from the balcony.  No 
                      note.  No email.  People in their 
                      twenties don t take a crap without 
                      putting it on facebook. 

                                    TEDDY
                      Those are high-pressure jobs.  
                      Trust me, half the kids who went to 
                      Exeter with me are self-medicated. 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      This hard-working girl studies for 
                      six years, puts herself through 
                      college, gets a job with a top firm 
                    on the brink of a big merger and 
                      then she ends it?  Not a chance. 

                                    VIRGIL
                      What about her personal life? 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      From the hours she s keeping, that type 
                    of job....Bradley Financial was her 
                      social life.  

        Virgil knocks in the eight ball and wins the game.  Teddy 
      takes out a roll of cash that could choke a horse and pays 
        Virgil.

                                    IRONSIDE (CONT D)
                      Her roommate said she spent all her 
                      time either at work or at the 
                      Frisco Club Gym. 

                                    TEDDY
                      That s five hundred a month. 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      Someone s paying that bill and 
                      sending her roses and expensive 
                        jewelry...it s either a client or 
                      someone in that building.  That was 
                      her whole world. 
                            (then)
                      These two brothers who run the firm, 
                      what do we know about them?                                                                                       18.

                    In that business there s no such 
                      thing as a successful, well-liked 
                      rich guy. Those guys only exist in 
                      campaign ads and Cole Porter songs. 

      Holly gives him a  lame  look.

                      I try.

                      The employees have nothing but good 
                      things to say.  I found five ex-
                      employees who left in the last 
                      three months.  Only one of them 
                      wouldn t call me back.  Kim Elliot.  
                      I m going to see her later. 

                                    TEDDY
                      Somebody must have made some calls, 
                      because everyone s buttoned up tight 
                      about this merger. I asked for it twice.  
                      They keep forwarding me to their lawyer.  
                      Could tell you something.  

                                    IRONSIDE
                      Doesn t your brother work for their

                      Mayor? Won t this piss him off?                                                                                       19.


                                    IRONSIDE 
                      The day I start giving two shits 
                      about the mayor and his friends is 
                      the day you can take me out back 
                      and put me out of my misery.  

                                    HOLLY
                      I can help with you that. 

      He gives her the same  lame  look she gave him. 

                                    HOLLY (CONT D)
                      I try.  


      INT. GOLDMAN-SACHS SAN FRANCISCO - DAY 

      Holly speaks with ex-employee KIM ELLIOT, pretty, well-
        dressed, educated, snotty.  Virgil stands in the back. 

                                    KIM
                    It was time for me to leave.  It 
                        was....complicated.  
                            (looking down her nose)
                      Honestly, detective, you wouldn t understand.  

                                    HOLLY
                      No? I m pretty smart.  

                                    KIM
                      I didn t mean to insult.  

                                    HOLLY
                      Whydon t you tell me something good? 
                      Clearly, you know something or you 
                      wouldn t be acting like such a b-i-t-c-h.  

                                    KIM
                          (a bit shocked)
                      Look, I signed a confidentiality 
                      agreement. I really can t discuss 
                      Bradley Financial or the Broughtons. I m 
                      sorry about Annie, but I just can t help 
                      you. 

      Holly digs in her bag.... 

                                    HOLLY
                      Let me explain something to you: I work at 
                      a special division and my boss -- 

                                    VIRGIL
                      ...he s what people in polite 
                      society refer to as incorrigible, 
                      though I ve heard him called worse.                                                                                        20.


                                    KIM
                            (looking at Virgil, unnerved)
                        That s...nice. 

                                    HOLLY
                      He s taught me -- us, really -- 
                      certain techniques... 
                            (Virgil nods)
                      ...mostly regarding how to cut through 
                      b.s., so he won t be happy if I don t get 
                      the information he needs...

        ...she pulls a string of CONDOMS out of her purse, slowly, 
      like a magician s tie trick.

                                    HOLLY (CONT D)
                      There s this silly little law in 
                      San Francisco that says anyone with 
                      three or more condoms on their 
                      person can be arrested and 
                        investigated for prostitution.  

      She lays the condoms on the desk.  Takes out her handcuffs --

                                    KIM
                      Are you serious?

      She is -- she immediately starts to secure Kim s wrists...   

                                    HOLLY
                          (to Virgil, as she cuffs her)
                      She must be one of those high-class whores. 

                                    VIRGIL
                      I ll get an office map so we make sure 
                    we parade her past all the partners.  

      Kim looks at them in disbelief...they re not kidding.  


      INT. SAN FRANCISCO POLICE COMPLEX - DAY

      Ed stands in the hallway speaking with Ironside.  Police 
        Personnel, Criminals, Lawyers, move around and past them.   

                                    ED
                            (anxiety percolating)
                      Please don t tell me you re 
                        investigating Bradley.  

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      We re just looking... 
                          (Ed reacts)
                      ...but these guys...they re dirty, Ed. 
                      They lie for a living. I know they 
                      donate a lot of money to the Mayor... 
                      ever ask yourself why?                                                                                        21.


      A few cops walk by. Among them are SHAUB and GREEN.  

                                    SHAUB
                      Hey, congrats, Ironside! I hear 
                      they got you working suicides now. 

                                    GREENE
                      Next they ll have you looking for 
                      the Hamburglar.  

                                    SHAUB
                            (imitating the Hamburglar)
                      Rubble rubble rubble!  

      They guffaw stupidly and continue on their way.

                                    ED
                      You have any proof?

                                    IRONSIDE
                      Only that a beautiful girl with a 
                      promising future doesn t take a dive off a 
                      building. Not in the world I live in. 

                                    ED
                      I was doing you a favor. 

                                    IRONSIDE
                      And don t think I don t appreciate it.  

      Ed walks off, shaking his head. 


      INT. GOLDMAN-SACHS SAN FRANCISCO - DAY

      Kim s tough facade has faded...handcuffs will have that effect. 

                                    KIM
                      The one client you might want to 
                      talk to is Dave McCutchen.  If you 
                      can find him. 

                                    VIRGIL
                      Why? 

                                    KIM
                      They sort of took him for a ride. 
                      Guys like the Broughtons make a lot 
                    of enemies; it s part of the 
                        business...but they take it a step 
                      further. We re talking Madoff 
                      territory. The stock filing could 
                      tell you a lot...when I saw it, 
                      that s when I started asking 
                      questions...and the truth is, if 
                      you find out what they re doing, 
                      you basically have three choices...                                                                                       22.


                                    HOLLY
                      OK, so you take the non-disclosure 
                      agreement, a severance bonus and just leave.  

                                    KIM
                      Right. Or you can play the game 
                      their way and risk losing 
                      everything for a huge payoff.

        A beat of silence...

                                    HOLLY
                      What s the third alternative?  

                                    KIM
                      Ask Annie Ryan.  

                                        END OF ACT I                                                                                       23.


                                              ACT II


      INT. HOCKEY RINK - DAY 

        A brutal game of hockey is being played -- between teenage 
      boys.  It s actually not a game, but a practice...a very 
        intense practice. You d expect nothing less with Ironside as 
      the coach.  

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      Cross it.  Cross it.  

      They miss the pass.  Ironside blows his whistle.  

                                    IRONSIDE (CONT D)
                      Stop.  Over here.  Right now! 

      They skate over to him. 

                                    IRONSIDE (CONT D)
                      What the hell are you guys doing?  I 
                      can skate better than you guys and I 
                      haven t felt my legs in two years.  

        ANOTHER player, NATE, enters the area.  Ironside notices 
      him.  Nate stops to casually put on his skates as the team 
        practices.  Ironside bristles at him.  Turns back to his 
      team.  


                                    IRONSIDE (CONT D)
                      Guys, listen to me.  You re skating 
                      like a bunch of girls out there. 
                      Practice is just as important as the 
                      game...we worked too hard to slow 
                      down now.  The championship is next 
                      week.  We need to be ready.  

                                    PLAYER
                      Nate s here.

      The Other players perk up at the mere sight of him. 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                            (ignoring him)
                      Okay.  Two-on-one drills. 

                                      ASSISTANT COACH
                          (on the ice)
                      Okay, guys, you heard him. Line up.  

                                    MARLEY
                            (watching the practice)
                      I heard Penny came to see you last night.                                                                                       24.


                                    IRONSIDE 
                      Third time this month. 
                            (then, shouting on ice)
                      I need a cleaner pass, O Neil. 

      Nate gets in line with the team to do the scoring drill.  
      He is far and away the best player on the team. 

                                    MARLEY
                      I guess Gary s never coming back to 
                      the force. 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      I think she d be happy if he even 
                      came home at night. 

                                    MARLEY
                      Why s he blaming himself?  It s been two 
                      years.  You said it wasn t his fault. 

                                    IRONSIDE
                        A partnership is a funny 
                        thing...when you re in the right 
                      one, you re closer than a marriage. 
                      You feel each other s pain. 

                                    MARLEY
                      What is he looking for? 

                                    IRONSIDE
                      Peace of mind. I can t say if things 
                      were reversed... I might be the one 
                      crying on the shrink s couch. 

                                    MARLEY
                      I highly doubt that.

                                    IRONSIDE
                      You don t know me as well as you 
                      think you do.  

                                    MARLEY
                      I know all there is to know
                            (rubbing his shoulder)
                      ...and I still work for you.  

      Nate scores easily on the drill, sprints, and stops on a dime 
      in front of the coach s box with an extra flair for 
        Ironside..

                                    IRONSIDE
                      What the hell do you think you re doing?  

                                    NATE
                      What?                                                                                       25.


                                    IRONSIDE 
                      The practice is almost over.  We 
                      have rules, here.  You ve had your 
                      last warning.  You can forget about 
                      playing next week.  

                                    NATE
                            (major attitude)
                      You re the boss, man. 

      Nate skates by himself to the other half of the rink, away 
      from the team, and puts on an amazing display of skill, 
        taunting Ironside.  

                                    MARLEY
                      Are you really not going to play your 
                      best player in the championship? 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                    We have rules. 

                                    MARLEY
                      Hockey s what keeps him out of trouble.  

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      I m not his father.  You got me 
                      roped into this, now you re gonna
                      tell me how to coach?

                                    MARLEY
                    It was supposed to help relieve 
                      your stress. 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                            (gritting his teeth, 
                              watching Nate)
                      I think it s working. 


      INT. PETERSEN FINANCIAL - DAY

      Teddy is having conversation with his well-tailored brother, 
        GEORGE, who clearly is uncomfortable with his brother s 
        presence. 

                                    TEDDY
                      I need to see that filing. It could 
                    be evidence in a murder. 

                                    GEORGE
                      I can t do it.  The merger s still 
                      pending.  I ll lose my license.  

                                    TEDDY
                      You won t.  You re my brother, for 
                      god s sake.                                                                                       26.


                                    GEORGE
                      I didn t handle it.  It was 
                      Robbin s account.  You know that.  
                      You re just here to bother me. 

                                    TEDDY
                      You ve always been a prick.  That s 
                      why Mom never liked you. 

                                    GEORGE
                      Why don t you go arrest some bad 
                      guys. Fix whatever s broken inside 
                      you. I m sure Dad will hire you on 
                    as a runner when you re done doing 
                      what ever it is you re doing. 

        Suddenly, Teddy lunges at him, grabs him by the lapels.  
        Pushes him against the wall. 

                                    TEDDY
                      George, it s important.  I wouldn t 
                    be here otherwise.  I don t like to 
                      see you.  In fact, I loathe you, to 
                      the bottom of my infected soul. 

        SECURITY ARRIVES...TEDDYLETS GO.  

                                    GEORGE
                      Get out.  You ll get nothing from me. 


      INT. FRISCO CLUB - DAY 

        Teddy, Marley and Ironside move toward the club s state-of-
        the-art rock-climbing wall. Several CLIMBERS are struggling 
      to pull themselves even a few feet off the ground.  

                                    TEDDY
                      He s the same prick he was when we 
                      were kids.  Followed the rules and 
                      tattled on everyone like a bitch.  
                      I ll find another way. 

        Ironside nods, and wheels further into the gym.  

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      Look at these people doing 
                      everything they can to stave off 
                      the inevitable...thesefools 
                      couldn t climb a flight of stairs.

        AMANDA, an ATTRACTIVE CLIMBING INSTRUCTOR, hears him. 

                                    AMANDA
                      Really?  You think mountain 
                      climbing is easy?                                                                                       27.


                                    IRONSIDE 
                      This pile of polystyrene is no  
                      mountain. 

                                    AMANDA
                      Why don t you try it?

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      I m on duty.    

      She starts climbing.  

                                    IRONSIDE (CONT D)
                            (looking up staring at her 
                            ass)
                      We re looking for Annie Ryan s trainer. 

                                    AMANDA
                      What for?  

                                    IRONSIDE 
                    We have some questions for her.  

                                    AMANDA
                    If you can beat me up this  pile of 
                        polystyrene  I ll tell you whatever 
                      you want to know.

                                    IRONSIDE
                            (flirting)
                      I can arrest you. 

                                    AMANDA
                            (flirting back)
                      You have to catch me first. 

        Ironside looks at Marley. 

                                    MARLEY 
                      I told you to keep your thoughts to 
                      yourself.  This is what happens. 

        Without a hesitation, Robert pulls himself up the rope 
      using only the strength of his arms -- quite an impressive 
      feat.  They re racing, neck-and-neck...Robert is one strong 
        sonofabitch...it s close... WHO WILL WIN?


      INT. FRISCO CLUB - JUICE BAR - DAY 

        Amanda sits with Ironside and Marley. 

                                    AMANDA
                      I feel terrible...she was one of my 
                      favorite clients. Always here on 
                      time. Did her work at home. Most 
                      people cancel last-minute and make 
                    up the craziest excuses.                                                                                       28.


                                    MARLEY
                            (looking at Ironside)
                      I know all about crazy excuses when 
                    it comes to working out. 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      She exaggerates.  Now, can you tell 
                    us anything about your sessions 
                      with Annie?  Anything might help. 

                                    AMANDA
                      She was under a lot of pressure at 
                        work...shewanted to increase the 
                      intensity of her workouts to 
                      compensate, but I could tell it was 
                      taking an emotional toll on her.

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      Did she talk about a boyfriend or 
                      anyone who might want to harm her? 
                      Anything that upset her? 

                                    AMANDA
                      Not really, but I remember the one 
                      time she did cancel. Said she had 
                    to go to some big party -- needed 
                      the whole day to get ready -- 
                      supposed to be some big function, 
                      but the next day when I asked her 
                      about it, she nearly cried.  

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      Did she say what kind of party?

                                    AMANDA
                      No.  I don t think...wait...she
                      called it a  Flower Party . 

                                    TEDDY
                        A flowerparty?  Are you sure?

                                    AMANDA
                      That s what she said.

                                    IRONSIDE 
                          (to Teddy)
                      You heard of these? 

                                    TEDDY
                      Oh, yeah.  They re something to 
                      behold... moveable sex-feasts for the 
                      very rich and very bored.  Every 
                      fetish you can imagine, some crazy 
                      shit. You d never believe who s 
                      involved - the list goes all the way 
                    to the top...                                                                                       29.


                                    AMANDA
                    By the way, I have to ask...can 
                      you...?

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      Yes, I can.
                            (without missing a beat, 
                              serious)
                      But what would a girl like Annie be 
                      doing at one of these flower parties? 
                      Who could have possibly convinced her 
                    to go to something like that? Whoever s 
                      buying her Manolo Blahniks and Tiffany 
                      necklaces, maybe. 

                                    AMANDA
                      I m pretty sure she said it was 
                      someone at work.  

                                    IRONSIDE
                      Which of them is the sleaziest? 


      INT. FREDDY BROUGHTON S BEACH HOUSE - DAY 

      The family is having a gathering at their BAYSIDE beach 
        house.  Marley and Ironside are at the door, being greeted 
      by Freddy. 

                                    FREDDY
                      Detective, this is a surprise.  

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      I wanted to see how the better half 
                      lives, so here I am.  

                                    FREDDY
                      I don t know about better, perhaps 
                      bigger.  

        SHELLY BROUGHTON, 44, well-tended, appears at his elbow. 

                                    SHELLY
                      You must be Detective Ironside. 

                                    FREDDY
                      Detective, let me introduce my 
                      wife, Shelly.

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      You recognize my eyes?  

                                    SHELLY
                      Oh, he is funny.  Would you like to 
                      join us for lunch? We had the tuna 
                      flown in from Japan this morning.                                                                                       30.


                                    IRONSIDE 
                    If I could just have a few moments 
                    of your time. 

                                    SHELLY
                    We can talk in the parlor. 

        Ironside looks around, wondering which one that is. 


      INT. PARLOR ROOM - DAY 

        Ironside sits across from FREDDY AND SHELLY - a lunch party 
      can be seen through the window.  

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      Mrs. Broughton I understand you re 
                      the party planner for the firm.  
                      Are they usually that lavish? 

                                    SHELLY
                      I planned this one.  It used to be 
                    my job.  Now it s just a hobby. 

                                    FREDDY
                      This one was bigger than most.  As 
                      I m sure you know, everyone .... 

      As they talk, Ironside continually rearranges the four 
        orchid-filled vases into different formations on the parlor 
        table. 

                                    FREDDY (CONT D)
                      ...at our company has been working very hard 
                      for the merger and it was sort of a perk.

                                    SHELLY
                            (annoyed by the vase movement)
                      Detective, do you know each of 
                      those vases are worth fifty-
                      thousand dollars? 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      Oh, I m sorry, I m just having 
                      myself a little flower party. 

      On that, Freddy s face goes ashen. 


      EXT. FREDDY BROUGHTON S BEACH HOUSE - LATER

      In the driveway, Freddy is doing all he can to control 
        himself. 

                                    FREDDY
                    Do you have any idea who you re messing 
                      with?                                                                                       31.


                                    IRONSIDE 
                      No, but I m slowly starting to find 
                      out.  And to tell you the truth, I 
                      don t like what I m finding. 

                                    FREDDY
                      Sometimes, doing one s job requires 
                      a degree of unpleasantry.  

                                    IRONSIDE 
                    My job is find out who did this,  
                      your job is to screw people out of 
                      money and get with it.  
                            (gesturing at the nice house)
                      Your nervous face against the imported 
                      tile on your porch makes me believe 
                      we re both doing something right.  

                                    FREDDY
                            (gesturing at the chair)
                      Understandably, your accident has 
                      made you bitter. I appreciate that. 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      Guess what, Freddy, I was like this long 
                      before a bullet shattered my spine. 

                                    FREDDY
                      I m sorry...

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      You re not.  You should be...for a 
                      lot of things, not the least of 
                      which corrupting a young girl...but 
                      I promise you...you will be. 

                                    FREDDY
                      OK, listen, I asked Annie to go to 
                      the Flower Party with me.  

                                    IRONSIDE
                    So saying you didn t know her too 
                      well was a bit of understatement, I 
                      guess.... 

                                    FREDDY
                      It s not like that. It s part of 
                      the rules -- you have to bring a 
                      woman with you, understand?

        Ironside takes out A FLOWER PARTY INVITATION -- 

                                    IRONSIDE
                    If not, it d be just a bunch of 
                      swinging Richards talking about pork 
                      belly futures.  Big shots doing 
                      things they d never do at home.

                                      IRONSIDE(CONT'D)
                    We found out all about it, and I d 
                      watch your wrinkled ass next time 
                      you re there...we might just raid it. 

                                    FREDDY
                      She came to one, and she hated it, okay?  

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      Did she know what kind of party you 
                      were taking her to? 

                                    FREDDY
                      Maybe I should have told her a 
                      little more, but her replacement 
                      had no such reservations.  And 
                      that s all I m going to say without 
                      a lawyer.  

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      Whaddya need a lawyer for?  

                                    FREDDY
                      Because I have a lot of money and 
                      people with money need lawyers.  
                      I ve done nothing wrong. 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      Maybe you didn t kill her, but 
                      you re hiding something...guys like 
                      you always are...

                                    FREDDY
                      Guys like you have been gunning for 
                      guys like me since the beginning of 
                      time, but you always come up empty. 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      Yeah, but you ain t seen nothing like 
                    me yet.

                                            ACT III


      INT. HOCKEY GAME - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

        A vicious game of hockey plays out between the Police and the 
        Firemen. Ironside, in the middle of the madness, throws 
        elbows, jabs his stick into someone ribs.  Talks shit. Blood 
        bruises, sweat and profanities fly in every direction...

      The Goalie catches the puck, halting the action.  As the  
      team lines up for the ensuing face-off.  Ironside moves to 
      one of his teammates...

                                    IRONSIDE
                          (to his teammate)
                    If you let that little prick, 
                      Number Four, elbow you on the 
                      boards one more time, when we get 
                      back to the bench you and I are 
                      gonna go at it...

      The Teammate nods.  He understands loud and clear. Ironside 
      takes his place at the middle of the circle, ready for the 
        face-off, but his eyes momentarily gaze up into the stands 
      and land on MELANIE - A PRETTY BRUNETTE.  He sends a small 
      smile and wink her way.  She s sitting with Gary and Penny 
        tucked in amongst the wives and girlfriends of the Police and 
        Firemen. 

      The referee drops the puck and the game starts.  Melanie 
        cheers loudly as Ironside s vicious play resumes on the ice.  


      EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET - NIGHT 

      The FOURSOME walks the Streets of the Mission District on the 
        perfect night.  

                                    GARY
                      Before you, Melanie, he never 
                      invited anyone to his hockey games. 

                                    PENNY
                      I had to go out with these two 
                      alone every game night. It s like I 
                      married Starsky and Hutch. 

                                    IRONSIDE
                      That s because most women don t 
                      understand the fine art of cross 
                      checking someone s face, like Mel. 

                                    MELANIE 
                      Number six on your team is bringing 
                      you down.  
                                    (MORE)                                                                                      34.

                                    MELANIE  (CONT'D)
                    He skates back on defense like he s 
                    on a damn coffee break. I d like to 
                      cross check his face. 

      He grabs her and kisses her. 

                                    IRONSIDE
                          (to Gary and Penny)
                    Do you see why I have to marry this 
                      girl?  

                                    MELANIE
                            (devious smile)
                      That, and the thing I do with my 
                      knuckle. 

                                    GARY
                    If you guys keep talking like that 
                      I m gonna start to think he s a 
                      nice normal guy...

        A blast of music floods out from a bar they pass.  Melanie 
        dances down the street singing.  Ironside looks at Gary and 
        Penny.... is she great or what?   

                                    MELANIE 
                            (dancing up to Ironside)
                      Let s go dancing at that Salsa 
                      place again.  They ll love it. 

                                    IRONSIDE
                          (to Gary and Penny)
                      ...you ve never seen anything like 
                      this place. 

                                    MELANIE
                    He only listened to AC/DC before we 
                      started dating...

                                    GARY
                      I tried playing Dave Matthews one 
                      day and he almost threw me out of 
                      the car. 

                                    MELANIE
                      I would have done the same thing. 

        Ironside laughs hard -- Penny does, too.  Ironside grabs 
        Melanie kisses her passionately, lovingly.  


      INT. IRONSIDE S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING - PRESENT

        Ironside s IN BED READING A DOSSIER ON BRADLEY FINANCIAL.  
      He turns the page -- waking THE NAKED YOUNG WOMAN NEXT TO 
      HIM -- AMANDA, the climbing instructor --                                                                                       35.


                                    AMANDA
                      What are you doing?  

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      Nothing, go back to sleep.

        Amanda yawns -- and twists...

                                    AMANDA
                      I don t want to go back to sleep. 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                            (closes)
                      Okay, lay there and watch me read. 

                                    AMANDA
                      I ve got a better idea.  

      She climbs on top of him...rubs her hands down his arms, 
      over  chest...kisses his neck...

                                    AMANDA (CONT D)
                      You lay here...
                            (pulling off her shirt)
                      ...and watch me....

      He opens his eyes...he s happy he did -- and smiles...she 
      moves above him, kissing his face, his neck -- he s 
        enjoying the moment, but it doesn t last long.  His phone 
        rings...he eyes...

                                    IRONSIDE
                    It could be about my case. 

      He goes to reach for it.  She grabs it.  

                                    AMANDA
                            (with a smile)
                      Ironside s phone....(listens) 

      Her smile fades.  

                                    AMANDA (CONT D)
                      I think something s wrong. 

      She hands the phone to Robert. 


      EXT. PRISON CORRIDOR - HOLDING CELLS - DAY 

      Ed walks with Ironside down the prison corridor.   

                                    ED
                    He begged us not to call his 
                      family.  You re the only one he 
                      wanted to talk to.                                                                                      36.


                                    IRONSIDE 
                      What d he do? 

                                    ED
                      Attempted robbery.  

                                    IRONSIDE
                      Jesus Christ. 

                                    ED
                      Didn t even try to get away.  
                      Wanted to be caught. 

      They move down to the end of corridor where GARY STANTON, 
      his ex-partner, but looking years older than the two since 
      we ve last seen him -- lies curled in the corner, drunk, 
        sleeping. 

                                    ED (CONT D)
                    We all feel for him...and I ve seen 
                      this behavior before...where partners 
                      are hurt...you know...or worse. 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                            (they really are friends)
                      What do I do here, Ed? 

                                    ED
                      I wish there was a simple answer.  

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      Thanks for calling.  

                                    ED
                      Get him home.  


      INT. OLYMPIC CLUB - DAY 

      Teddy is meeting with his friend CHAZ at the POSH COUNTRY 
      CLUB.  He s got the Bradley COMPANY PHOTO out on the table.  
        A flower party invitation lies next to the photo. 

                                    TEDDY
                      You don t have to tell me anything 
                      about what you did.  Your wife ll 
                      never find out.  I just need to 
                      know if anyone in this picture was 
                    at any of these parties...

      INT. HAIGHT-ASHBURY COFFEE SHOP - DAY

        Ironside sits with Gary, who s still groggy from his drunk 
      nap.  

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      Jesus.  I ve got your wife coming 
                    to my bar.  I can t have middle-
                      aged women sitting at my table. 
                      I ve got a reputation, you know.  

      Gary laughs, but he s miserable.  Depressed. 

                                    IRONSIDE (CONT D)
                    So talk to me.  What s going on? 

                                    GARY
                      I just can t...I don t know how to 
                      get it together...

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      You re really gonna let one bullet 
                      take out both of us? 

                                    GARY
                      What happened to you? I was your 
                      partner...I should have never .... 
                      I don t know...I sometimes wish it 
                      was me in that chair.  

        Ironside hauls off and smacks him across the face.  The 
        people in the next booth can feel it. 

                                    GARY (CONT D)
                      I deserve that, and a whole lot more. 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      I m a cripple and I accept my lot, but 
                      you ve become an emotional cripple.  
                      And that's worse.  Stop crying and get 
                      back on the goddamn horse.                                                                                          38.


                                    GARY
                      I should have known. Should have 
                      had your back. 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      Goddamn it.  I don t have time for 
                      this.  I ve got to get back to 
                      work.  I still have a job.  If you 
                      want to blame yourself, go ahead. 
                      I m not gonna play wet nurse.  If 
                      you re never coming back to the 
                      force, get your looney bird pension 
                      and move on with your life...stop 
                      dragging this out.  

                                    GARY
                      I ve tried...I ve talked to people...   

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      Then let me live my life. 

        Ironside gets a text from Teddy.  Found the Flower Girl.  

                                    GARY
                      I didn t tell my wife to come see 
                      you...

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      What other choice are you giving 
                      her? 

                                    GARY
                            (getting crazy, loud)
                      Don t you just want to scream 
                      sometimes?  How the hell are you 
                      handling it so well? 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      I have no choice. 


      INT. DAVE MCCUTCHEN S APARTMENT - DAY

        A luxury apartment without the luxury: No signs of excess 
      here in this barren space that s furnished with a folding 
        table, futon mattress, and milk crate chairs...

                                    DAVE
                      Before I met the Broughton Brothers I 
                      was a wealthy man, my parents left me 
                      a lot of money.  A few investments 
                      later, here I am, a prisoner in a 
                      penthouse.  Can t even sell it because 
                      I m upside-down on the mortgage.

                                    HOLLY
                      So, what did you do about it?                                                                                       39.


                                    DAVE
                      I called a hundred times...tried to 
                      get an answer...their bulldog 
                      office manager wouldn t even let me 
                      leave a message...

                                    HOLLY
                      You just left it at that?  A 
                      certain ex-employee, a friend of 
                        yours...tells us there s more. 

                                    DAVE
                      I tried the legal route.  Guys like that 
                      have the top lawyers, but out of nowhere, 
                      a few weeks ago, I got a call from 
                      someone who works there... she said they 
                      uncovered some inconsistencies and the 
                      firm was going to try to make it right. 
                      Collecting information from a lot of 
                      clients, like me, who lost a bundle.  She 
                      said I might get some money back if the 
                      research was right... she asked me not to 
                      mention it to anyone... she seemed 
                      nervous... I haven t heard back yet, 
                      though....

                                    HOLLY
                    Do you remember who called you? 

                                    DAVE
                      Sure...her name was Annie Ryan. 


      INT. CLAIRE S APARTMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY - NIGHT

        Claire carries a bag of cat food down her hallway. She rounds 
      the corner and jumps when she finds someone waiting there.  

                                    IRONSIDE (O.S.)
                      Why does it not surprise me you 
                      have a cat?  

        Ironside emerges from the shadows.  Teddy and Marley wait 
      down the hall.  

                                    CLAIRE 
                      What are you doing here? 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      I m trying to solve a murder. 

                                    CLAIRE
                      Murder? 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      That s right.  Annie Ryan.  You 
                      know as well I do she didn t jump.                                                                                        40.


                                    CLAIRE
                      I don t know anything of the sort.  

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      Listen, lady, if you think your cat 
                    is your only friend now, wait  til 
                      I m done with you. Tell me about 
                      the Broughton brothers.  

                                    CLAIRE
                      I told you what I know...I m not a liar.   

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      I know you re not a liar, you don t 
                      have the imagination. 

                                    CLAIRE
                      Listen, I didn t...

                                    IRONSIDE
                      There s a point at which loyalty 
                      becomes obstruction.  You re walking 
                      the line. If there s a secret you re 
                      hiding, I ll find it.  

                                    CLAIRE
                      I didn t do anything.  And what 
                      other secrets do you know about me? 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      I know you went to those flower 
                      parties as a back-up option for 
                      Freddy. Maybe you enjoy being 
                      treated like an understudy? 

                                    CLAIRE
                    Is this what you do, harass 
                      innocent people?  

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      Show me one. 

                                    CLAIRE
                      What is wrong with you? 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      I can understand you being upset.  A 
                      new girl comes in, starts digging 
                      around in your work... but she found 
                      something.  Something bad. Annie told 
                      one of your clients it was going to be 
                      announced soon.    

                                    CLAIRE
                      She wasn t that great.                                                                                        41.


                                    IRONSIDE 
                      Sure, she was.  She was younger than 
                      you, prettier than you, smarter than 
                      you, and all of a sudden, the 
                      attention you were getting from the 
                      Broughtons vanishes... your self-
                      worth takes a hit...

                                    CLAIRE 
                            (unable to hold in her anger)
                      I never saw what Bill saw in her, anyway.  

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      Bill?  
                            (knowing smile)
                      I thought we were talking about 
                      Freddy.  

      Her face falls.  

                                        END OF ACT III                                                                                      42.

      INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

        A CUBAN restaurant -- the restaurant is packed tonight. Some 
        tourists, but mostly nefarious-looking characters, as its 
      MAIN BUSINESS IS THAT OF BEING A CRIMINAL HANG-OUT. 

        Pretty waitresses move about -- serving CUBAN delicacies.  
      Music plays in the background. The place is filled with 
        energy and color. 

        Ironside enters.  A few people instantly recognize him as a 
      cop and whisper to their companions.  

                                    IRONSIDE 
                            (Ma tre d')
                      One please. 

                                    MA TRE D' 
                      I m sorry, sir.  We re full 
                      tonight. 

        Ironside pushes the Ma tre d' out of the way and walks into 
      the restaurant.  As he passes tables, he picks food off 
        people s plates and tastes it.  

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      This looks good.  How s the veal?  
                      Nice hat.  

      He moves to the center restaurant and stops.  People stop  
        eating, talking....andfocus on him...

                                    IRONSIDE (CONT D)
                      I m looking for Rick Gomez....
                            (shouting)
                      Born Enrico Gonzalez in Havana.  I 
                      hear he hangs out in this shithole.  
                      ...Came to the US...

      The Restaurant Patrons look very nervous.  A few TOUGH GUYS 
      at the BAR tense up. 

                                    IRONSIDE (CONT D)
                      ...in1985 on a banana boat... 
                      Enrico Gonzalez was arrested the 
                      first time in 1991 for beating a 
                      couple with a baseball bat for 
                      fourteen dollars. Deported. 
                      Returned...

      A GUN is pressed to the back of IRONSIDE S HEAD by one of the 
      CUBAN GANGSTERS.                                                                                       43.


                                    CUBAN GANGSTER
                      ...I think you d better be on your 
                      way...

      But the sound of a CLICK puts the CUBAN MAN on alert and we 
      pull back to REVEAL GARY, who was sitting among the PATRONS, 
      who now has a GUN PRESSED TO CUBAN S HEAD. (They re a great 
        team.) Ironside takes the Man s weapon and then twists his 
      arm in a way an arm should not be twisted -- the man screams 
      in pain.  He holds him in that position...

                                    IRONSIDE

      AND IRONSIDE AND IMMEDIATELY FLEES OUT THE BACK....IRONSIDE 
        THROWS THE CUBAN MAN TO THE GROUND AND FOLLOWS -- GARY HEADS 
      OUT THE FRONT ENTRANCE. 

        IRONSIDE RACES THROUGH THE KITCHEN...HE SEES THE BACK DOOR

        ...the dark alley...he sees Enrico running past the 
          dumpsters....SUDDENLY A SHOT LIGHTS UP THE NIGHT...ROBERT 
      KEEPS RUNNING TO THE END OF THE ALLEY, WHERE ENRICO LIES 
      DEAD IN POOL OF BLOOD -- GARY STANDING OVER HIM.   

                                    IRONSIDE
                      What the hell did you do? 

      Gary offers no response. 


      INT. IRONSIDE S BEDROOM - DAWN

        Ironside is working out furiously to sound of  Dirty Deeds , 
        rowing on his ARM BIKE machine.  He pulls WITH ALL HIS 
        STRENGTH, but the reps are hard today and he s clearly in 
        pain... he runs out of momentum... he reps are getting 
        sloppy.  He stops.  He throws his headphones on the ground. 
      He tries to start again.  He hurts.  He goes to get up.  
      That hurts, too.                                                                                       44.


        FRUSTRATED. HE SCREAMS TO THE HEAVENS. IN PAIN. IN REGRET. 
      IN LOSS. THE  WHY ME  SCREAM THAT CAN ONLY BE CONTAINED FOR 
      SO LONG...  

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      AHHHH!!!!


      INT. IRONSIDE'S WHEEL HOUSE OFFICE - DAY

        Ironside, in front of Tony and Ed, is upset for a different 
        reason.  

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      You re not taking mycase away from me!  

                                    TONY
                      It s not your case, it s the 
                        department s case, and YES, I am.

                                    IRONSIDE 
                        I understand -- you feel the need 
                    to parade me around like your 
                      trained monkey so the mayor s 
                      donors think you have your best men 
                      allocated for their personal safety 
                      and the money keeps flowing.   

                                    TONY
                      That s got nothing to do with it. 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                    If I want any shit from you, I ll 
                      squeeze your head. 
                          (to Ed)
                    We were getting somewhere...both 
                      the brothers had a relationship 
                      with this girl...in one form or 
                        another...that s motive...and she 
                      had information about illegal 
                      trading practices...

                                    TONY
                      There s no concrete evidence that 
                    it was anything more than a 
                      suicide.  There was no one else on 
                      the floor that night...

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      You don t find it funny that as 
                      soon as we get close, they pressure 
                      you to take the case away?  

                                    TONY
                    No one pressured me.  

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      Then, why?                                                                                        45.


                                    TONY
                      I don t answer to you.  And I m the 
                      one who keeps cases open.  

                                    IRONSIDE 
                          (to Ed)
                      I have a hunch. 

                                    TONY
                      Last time you had hunch you wound 
                    up in that chair. 

                                    ED
                      Take it easy, Tony. 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      How long you been waiting to use 
                      that one, Tiny? 

                                    TONY
                      Sorry, Ed... This guy... just...

                                    ED
                      I m sorry, Bob.  It s over. 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      You brought me in, now you re 
                      trying to run me off... I don t 
                      think so, shorty. 


      INT. CITY HALL - MAYOR S RECEPTION AREA / OFFICE - DAY

        Ironside heads into the Mayor s office, past his secretary.  

                                    MAYOR S SECRETARY
                      Excuse me! You can t go in there! 

      But he rolls past her and into the Mayor s office. 


      INT. MAYOR S OFFICE - DAY 

      The Mayor looks up to see... Ironside in front of him. 

                                    MAYOR
                      Detective? 


      INT. CITY HALL - MAIN CORRIDOR - DAY 

      Tony has to be restrained in the hallway as he tries to get 
      to Ironside.

                                    TONY
                      You lousy, no-good sonofabitch!

        Several of TONY S staff hold him back.                                                                                        46.


                                    IRONSIDE 
                      You know what I like most about 
                      you, Tony?  

                                    TONY
                    Go to hell. 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      I can look you directly in the eye 
                      when I talk to you.  

      The DA breaks free and runs to his office, returning with a 
        chair, and puts it in Ironside  s path.  He sits down in it.

                                    TONY
                      Right now.  Fight me, fair-and-
                      square.  No excuses.  

        Ironside skirts him easily, continuing down the hallway, 
      and Tony, like some crazed lion tamer, keeps moving his 
      chair in front of Ironside, but Ironside doesn t stop. 


      EXT. CITY HALL - DAY

        Marley continues to push Ironside away from the building. 

                                    MARLEY
                      Was that was really necessary?  

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      No, but it was fun.  

                                    MARLEY
                    So what did you say to the Mayor? 

                                    IRONSIDE
                      I told him I had a file on him. 

                                    MARLEY
                      You don t have a file on him.  

                                    IRONSIDE
                    He doesn t know that. 

                                    MARLEY
                      Just when I think I know everything 
                      about you.   

                                    IRONSIDE
                      I warned you...
                            (then, his face falling 
                            into great seriousness)
                      They want evidence...they ll get 
                      evidence.                                                                                      47.


      EXT. STREET - DAY 

      Omar is running down the street.  He turns the corner.  
        Starts running again.  A cop car skids to a stop.  Virgil 
      pops out. Omar sees him and starts running again.  Virgil 
      runs through traffic. Dodging cars.   


      EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY

      We pick up OMAR -- his face scrunched up in terror -- the 
        camera corkscrews around and we see the reason for his 
        distress -- HE S DANGLING JUST OVER THE EDGE OF A ROOFTOP... 
      NOW WE SEE WHERE VIRGIL GETS HIS REPUTATION.

      This scene is eerily reminiscent to Ironside hanging Tracey 
      off the building.  Virgil is holding him by the legs...

                                    OMAR
                      Please, please! 

                                    VIRGIL
                      Who was up there with her that night?   

                                    OMAR
                      I don t know...help! 

                                    VIRGIL
                      Nobody s gonna help you. 
                            (then, angry, gives him a 
                              little shake)
                      Why would you make me do this to 
                      you?

                                    OMAR
                      I m sorry!  Please. 

                                    VIRGIL
                      What are you sorry for? 
                      Erasing the ID file?  

                                    OMAR
                      Please, man.   

                                    VIRGIL
                      Who was it? 

        Virgil loosens his grip, and Omar slips down a few inches.  

                                    OMAR
                      Okay.  I ll tell you.  


      EXT. HOCKEY RINK - NIGHT 

        A group of parents are waiting around Ironside s van to talk 
      to him as he and Marley exit the rink from practice.                                                                                       48.


                                    PARENT
                      Coach, can we talk to you?  

                                    IRONSIDE 
                            (pissed, not in the mood)
                      Sure...I m always available. 

      But as he says this, he starts the process of getting 
        himself into the van...lowering the VAN lift. 

                                    PARENT 2 
                    We appreciate you sponsoring the team 
                      when it had no money.  But these kids 
                      have all worked so hard and they re so 
                      close... they re all gonna suffer if 
                      Nate doesn t play. 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                    We established a set of rules at the 
                      beginning of the season.  What would 
                      I be teaching them if I let him play?  
                      It s out of my hands. 

                                    PARENT 3
                      It s actually in your hands.  
                      You re the coach. 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      I ll take that under advisement. 

      The last statement is punctuated by the van doors closing 
        behind him, perfectly timed.   


      INT. VAN - SAME  

        Marley is sitting in the front seat, waiting. 

                                    MARLEY
                      Don t you find it ironic...

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      What?! 

                                    MARLEY
                      You know what...?  It s none of my 
                      business if you play him or not. 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                    At least someone s learning a 
                      lesson.
                            (looks at his phone)
                      Looks like Virgil found what we re 
                      looking for.                                                                                       49.


      INT. BRADLEY FINANCIAL - NIGHT

      Omar sees Ironside, Marley, and Holly coming and quickly 
      waves them through -- 

      They move through the quiet cubicles. He and his team move 
      down the hall to the one office that still has lights on...

                                    CLAIRE
                      What can I do for you, Detective?  

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      You can explain this to me...

        Ironside holds the security camera - shot of Claire -- 

                                    IRONSIDE (CONT D)
                      This is Annie, and this is 
                        you...followingright behind her. 

                                    CLAIRE
                      Where did you get that?  

                                    IRONSIDE
                      Annie found out the Broughtonswere 
                      doing a lot of bad things, but it 
                      was your name on the filings.  

      As he talks, she backs away from him toward the open terrace 
        doors. 

                                    CLAIRE
                      She set me up...shewas lying...

                                    IRONSIDE
                      She never lied a day in her life.  
                    If she did, she d still be alive.  

                                    CLAIRE
                      I ve been here for eighteen years.  
                      ...I gave my life to this company.  
                      She was only here a year. 

                                    IRONSIDE
                      You knew, and you didn t have the guts to 
                      stop them... What d they promise you? A 
                      big payout in the end? Annie was going to 
                      report the Broughtons...the problem was, 
                      she only had evidence on you, and they 
                      made sure you knew that... They used you 
                    to sign for the filings... that s why 
                      they paid for your license... but Annie 
                      knew.

      He s wheeling right at her....                                                                                      50.

                      They loaded the gun, but you pulled 
                      the trigger.  You were the only 
                      other one up here that night... The 
                      security guard confirmed it...

                                    CLAIRE
                    It was an accident!  We were arguing...I 
                      tried to tell her this company was 
                      everything to me...there was a lot of money, 
                      without it, I d have nothing...I have no 
                        savings...everything I have is here. 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      You could have told her it was the 
                      Broughtons, but you wanted to be 
                      loyal...at any cost...

      She is very close to the edge -- 

                                    IRONSIDE (CONT D)
                      What did she have on them?  Tell 
                      me! 

                                    CLAIRE
                            (crying)
                      I don t know. 

                                    IRONSIDE
                      They re just as responsible as 
                      you..

                                    CLAIRE
                      I didn t mean to hurt her... I just 
                      wanted to scare her.

                                    IRONSIDE
                      What s in that filing?

      She looks over -- down at the street -- disoriented...

                                    CLAIRE
                      After this I ll have 
                          nothing...nothing...nothing...

      She leans back to throw herself over... but Ironside, quick as a 
      cat, reaches out and grabs hold of her leg -- she goes over the 
      rail -- she pulls him out of his seat, but he holds on tight.  He 
      ain t letting go.  If she goes over -- he s going with her....

      INT. PETERSEN INVESTMENT OFFICE - DAY 

      Teddy walks into the lobby of Petersen Investments, 
        Bradley s merger partner.  The RECEPTIONIST looks up.

                                      RECEPTIONIST 
                      Can I help you? 

      But instead of answering.  Teddy hits an AIR HORN...

                      girls he begged...

        People are coming out of offices....to see what the hell is 
      going on, filing into the hallway.

                      Enough!  

      Teddy turns to see George, exasperated, standing among his 
        colleagues. 

                                    TEDDY
                      Oh, hi.  Hold on,  I m just getting

                      No, but I m getting there.  

        George looks around at his colleagues  faces...this isn t 
      good.


      INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - A - DAY 

        Freddy screams at his lawyer in an interrogation room.   

                                    FREDDY
                      Can he do this?!  Can he hold us here!?  

                                    LAWYER
                      Not for much longer.  Four hours is 
                      the max. 

                                    FREDDY
                      What does he want?  I ve done 
                      nothing wrong!  This is harassment.  
                    He think because he s in a chair I 
                      won t sue him. 

                                    LAWYER
                      Let s just calm down.  I don t think 
                      your shareholders would be too happy 
                      about you suing a hero cop.

                                    FREDDY
                            (getting more upset)
                      That s exactly what he s thinking. 

                                    LAWYER
                      He s right.  He took the city for a 
                      bundle and they don t have a yacht 
                      and four homes.   

                                    FREDDY
                      Whose side are you on? 

      He spots Ironside coming down the hallway (HE CLEARLY 
        SURVIVED) -- but instead of coming in, he pulls the curtain 
      on the Interrogation room across the hall...and we see 
        through the glass wall...WHERE BILL IS SITTING -- WITH HIS 
        LAWYER, GOING THROUGH THE SAME FRUSTRATING 
          EXPERIENCE....PACING BACK AND FORTH -- 

                                    FREDDY (CONT D)
                      What the hell is going on here, Marvin? 

        Ironside enters Bill s interrogation room. 


      INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - B  

        Ironside approaches Bill.                                                                                       53.


                                    IRONSIDE 
                      Listen, we know you were in love 
                      with her.  We know you were going 
                    to leave you wife.  She had 
                      feelings for you, too, but that was 
                      until she discovered the truth 
                      about you guys...and ended it... 
                      that s when you put Claire on her.

                                    BILL
                      You got it wrong.  I was going to change.  
                      She had that effect...I swear...I would 
                      never do anything to hurt her.  

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      Well, here s your chance to talk.  
                      One of you will. 

      He exits. 


      INT. HALLWAY - DAY 

      Holly and Virgil make their way down the hall as Ironside 
        exits. 

                                    HOLLY
                      What exactly are we doing here, boss?  

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      Annie found something on these 
                      guys...we might not have the smoking 
                      gun yet, but one of them s gonna hand 
                    it over before we re done. 

      Teddy approaches with a file in his hand. 

                                    IRONSIDE (CONT D)
                      Well? 

                                    TEDDY
                            (handing it to him)
                      It s all there.  Definitely 
                      fraudulent numbers.  Annie had it 
                      right.  But, it ll be tough to 
                      prove who s responsible. 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      This is the fun part.
                          (to Holly)
                      Are they ready? 

                                    HOLLY
                      Yeah, they re all here.  I don t 
                      understand.                                                                                      54.


                                    IRONSIDE 
                      That s because I haven t showed you 
                      guys all my tricks just yet.  This 
                      dog can still hunt. 

      The teams looks at the two brothers, who are both looking at 
      at Ironside...wondering what the fuck is going on...   

                                    IRONSIDE (CONT D)
                      Let s see if money or love will prevail.  
                          (a bit crazed)
                      Let the games begin...first one to 
                      talk goes home.   


      INT. HALLWAY - LATER 

      Holly walks Kim Elliot down the hallway -- 

      The brothers watch her go by into another room to talk.  Bill 
      is getting nervous.  Freddy is pissed.  Ironside wheels past 
        ominously like a waiting executioner.  


      INT. HALLWAY - LATER

        Virgil walks Omar down the hall.  The brothers watch him as 
      well. Ironside moves back and forth again...


      INT. HALLWAY - LATER

      Teddy walks Dave McCutchen down the hallway.  Bill is getting 
        restless....He stares over at Freddy and their eyes lock. 
        IRONSIDE moves back and forth incessantly, like the ever-
        lowering pendulum in Poe s tale of torture...


      INT. HALLWAY - LATER 

      Two prison Guards walk Claire, in an ORANGE JUMPSUIT, down 
      the hallway. 

      Both Brothers are in their rooms BOUNCING off the walls.  
        Freddy s yelling at his lawyer. Bill is panicking.  


      INT. HALLWAY - LATER 

      Two prison Guards walk Claire, in an ORANGE JUMPSUIT, down 
      the hallway. 

      Both Brothers are in their rooms, BOUNCING off the walls.  
        Freddy s yelling at his lawyer.  Bill is panicking.  

                                    IRONSIDE
                          (to his team)
                      It s showtime.                                                                                       55.


      INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - B - BILL S ROOM - DAY 

        Ironside moves in front of Bill, trying to crack him. 

                                    IRONSIDE
                      Freddy s never been loyal a day in 
                      his life.  He s betrayed his wife, 
                      his kids, his clients, his partners, 
                      the government, and I m betting 
                      you re next.  I can feel it, I can 
                      smell it, I can taste it...

      Bill gets up and moves to the other side of the room.  
        Ironside rolls 


      INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - A - FREDDY S ROOM - DAY

        Freddy seems much less likely to break.  

                                    IRONSIDE
                      I know what it s like to have an 
                      idiot brother.  I have one too. 
                      Been a curse since he was born.  
                      But yours is stupid enough to go 
                      and fall in love with an employee 
                      and grow a conscience.  There s no 
                      place for that in this business.  

        Freddy stares at Bill, trying to keep him strong as he tries 
      to ignore Ironside.  

                                    IRONSIDE (CONT D)
                      The truth is, I don t care which 
                      one of you I get....I d love both, 
                      but I willget one...
                            (wheeling out)
                      Oh, baby, I ve never been more sure 
                    of anything in my life....


      INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - B - BILL S ROOM - DAY

      Bill starts to fill with anxiety...

                                    IRONSIDE
                      Freddy s never respected you, if he 
                      did, he wouldn t have tried to take 
                      the girl you loved to a pleasure 
                      party and treat her like a sex toy.

      Bill sneaks a peek at Freddy who is glowering at him from 
        across the hall Ironside talks.                                                                                       56.


      INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - A - FREDDY S ROOM - DAY

      Fred is now out of his seat.  

                                    IRONSIDE
                      Sooner or later, Bill s stupidity 
                      was going to bring you down.  I 
                      shook his hand; he s weak....he 
                      always has been.  He s your 
                      Fredo...and you know what happened 
                    to Fredo...

                                    FREDDY
                            (still very arrogant)
                      No, it escapes me...Detective

                                    IRONSIDE
                          (as he wheels out)
                    He turned on his brother and set 
                      him up to be killed.


      INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - B - BILL S ROOM - DAY

      Bill is starting to crack. 

                                    IRONSIDE
                    Do you know what they doat those 
                      flower parties?  Sick, depraved 
                      things that would make even the 
                      most promiscuous adult s stomach 
                      turn...they all take turns passing 
                      the girls around, and then tossing 
                      them to the side when they re 
                      through with them...


      INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - A - FREDDY S ROOM - DAY

        Freddy is staring at Bill trying to ascertain what he s 
        thinking as Ironside s vitriol grows louder. 

                                    IRONSIDE
                      You're the oldest, the leader, the 
                      king.  The best Bill could ever be was 
                      a prince.  Machiavelli said it best:  
                      The aims of Princes are glory and 
                      survival   and they justify the use of 
                      immoral means to achieve those ends. 

      Off Freddy s look: 

                                    IRONSIDE (CONT D)
                      Yeah, I had a lot of time to read 
                      when I was in the hospital...

        Freddy s about to blow.                                                                                       57.


      INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - B - BILL S ROOM - DAY

      Bill stands up, in a fury. 

                                    IRONSIDE
                      She was good and pure, but that 
                      prick brother of yours sullied 
                      her....

      Bill looks across the hall at Freddy.  THE BROTHERS LOCK EYES.  

                                    IRONSIDE (CONT D)
                      ...and now she s dead!  Dead!!  
                      Dead!!!

                                    BILL
                      Enough! 

        Bill s eyes form tears in them.  Freddy s face yells  Oh 
        shit!   Ironside has a front row seat.


      INT. WHEEL HOUSE - LATER

        Ironside and his team are playing pool in the Wheel House. 

                                    HOLLY
                    So we go back to my apartment and I ask 
                      him if he s married - and he hesitates... 
                      and I don t care, I have gun...I m not 
                        scared....so he says he is...

                                    VIRGIL
                      Then what? 

                                    HOLLY
                      I tied him up...took his clothes off...
                            (pause)
                      ...got dressed, came to work...

                                    TEDDY
                      He s still there?  

                                    HOLLY
                      His wife probably picked him up by 
                      now.  I texted her the address...

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      Never tell a woman anything about 
                      yourself for at least two months 
                      after you slept with them.  It s a 
                      rule that has served me well. 
                            (then, shooting)
                      Four ball.  Center pocket.  

      The door opens.  Tony is there.  He walks down the into the 
      pit of the Wheel House.                                                                                       58.


                                    IRONSIDE (CONT D)
                      You want to play the winner? 

                                    TONY
                      Bill cracked.  Gave us about eighty 
                      violations.  SEC is on their way down. 
                          (to Ironside, reluctantly)
                      Nice job. 

      He turns and leaves.  

                                    IRONSIDE 
                    He must ve hated doing that as much 
                    as I loved seeing it. 


      INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT 

        Freddy is handcuffed, being led down the hallway after being 
        processed.  Ironside wheels fast to catch up.

                                    IRONSIDE 
                    In my experience, this is when the butt 
                      cheeks on guys like you start to pucker up.  

                                    FREDDY
                      You re insane...

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      I get that way when the lives of innocent 
                      people are needlessly taken...

      As Ironside follows Freddy, he passes Shaub standing with a 
      group of officers. 

                                    SHAUB
                      Heard your old partner went bat-shit.

      Once again, he snickers, whispers under his breath, but 
        Ironside, once again, moves past without a word. 

                                    FREDDY
                      I hope you re satisfied, you crazy 
                        sonofabitch... You got what you 
                      wanted... 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                    It wasn t me who beat you, it was 
                      her... she left the trail and your 
                      brother provided the details.  Maybe 
                      water is thicker than blood.  

                                    FREDDY
                      I m gonna sue your ass. 

                                    IRONSIDE
                      Get in line.  And if you don t know 
                      how to do that, prison will teach you.                                                                                       59.


      They lead Freddy away.  Ironside wheels down the hall -- 
        heading toward Shaub and others...Shaub says something 
      under his breath. 

                                      IRONSIDE(CONT D)
                            (very casually to the others)
                      When Shaub, here, first joined the force, 
                    he was on a raid with me and Gary...he 
                      swept the bedroom and forgot to check 
                      behind him. Before he knew it, there was a 
                      gun at his temple...
                            (Shaub stops smiling)
                      ...he wet himself so fast we named him Piss 
                      Pants...he never did it again, but I always 
                      suspected the reason was because he wore 
                      diapers during future raids, I swear you 
                      can hear him crinkle when he walked...

      From the embarrassed look on Shaub s face -- it s clear the 
      story is true.  The others laugh, but this time at Shaub. 


      INT. SF SALOON - NIGHT

      The Place is packed, but it s not the usual crowd.  It s 
      KIDS, the PARENTS, FRIENDS, mixed among the regulars.  
        Ironside s team is celebrating the championship win.  

                                    DAVE
                      I can get in trouble for having all 
                      these kids in here. 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      Call a cop, Dave. We re champions. 

      Kids run through the bar.  Throwing popcorn at each other.  
        REGULARS ARE GETTING PISSED.  

      ANGLE ON: BOOTH.  THE KIDS ARE AROUND A BIG BOOTH.  Laughing. 
        Drinking soda, but sneaking a beer between them. 

                                    PLAYER 1
                            (TOASTING WITH COKE)
                    To Coach Ironside, who told me I 
                      skated like a ballerina until I got 
                      sixty minutes in penalties. 

      THE KIDS THROW MORE POPCORN AT AT OTHER. THE PARENTS LAUGH. 
      DRINK BEER. SMILE. EVERYONE S HAVING FUN. Marley approaches 
        Ironside.  

                                    MARLEY
                      So, did you play him? 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      Well, I d be a hypocrite if I played 
                      him and a hypocrite if I didn t...                                                                                      60.


                                    MARLEY
                      So?

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      Ask Freddy Broughton...I love winning.  

      She sees Nate partying with his friends. 

                                    PLAYER 2
                            (arm around Nate)
                      Our hero.  Five goals in the final period.  

                                    MARLEY
                    So what lesson didyou impart? 

                                    IRONSIDE 
                      The raw truth? 
                            (she nods, knowing she ll get it 
                              whether she wants it, or not)
                    If you re really good at something you 
                      can get away with a lot of shit. 

      He heads out. 


      INT. MASON S CLUB - NIGHT 

        A support group is meeting.  Fourteen or so people are 
        gathered at the front of the room and assorted  friends  
      are mixed through the back.  

                                    MAN 
                      I was driving.  He was in the 
                      passenger seat.  I dozed off for just 
                        a second...and I hit a tree...walked 
                      away without a scratch.  He died on 
                      impact....I hear the crash in my sleep 
                      every night...

      He finishes talking and takes his seat....next up to the 
      front is GARY...

                                    GARY
                      ...this is my first time here, so bear 
                      with me...I was a cop...and, well, I 
                      guess I still am...my partner and I had 
                      been going after this big drug 
                      dealer...Enrico Gonzalez...

      The back of room, Ironside appears and moves next to 
        Penny...she sees him and smiles. 

                                    GARY (CONT D)
                      ...we tracked him down in this restaurant 
                    we heard he hung out in occasionally... he 
                      spotted us and ran....my partner went one 
                      way I went the other...
                            (starting to choke up)
                                    (MORE)                                                                                      61.

                                    GARY (CONT D)
                      ...the alley was dark...um....I 
                      didn t...I mean...if I didn t pull 
                      the trigger...they wouldn t have 
                      been looking for us...

        ...the weight of the moment is too much for him...he puts 
      his head in his hands...he ll have to finish another time. 

        Ironside leaves.  His face pained.  He needs a release.  
      It s never easy being him and this moment seems 
        particularly hard. 


      EXT. MASON S CLUB - NIGHT

        Ironside wheels out into the night.  Heavy heart.  He stops 
      on the sidewalk, sighs, but a pair of perfect breasts move 
        across his (perfectly positioned) sight-line and bounce down 
      the street -- perfect ass to match.  A Jack Nicholson-esque 
      smile forms on Ironside s face.

                                    IRONSIDE
                      Oh, miss? 

      She turns with an inviting glance.  He swivels his wheelchair 
      on a dime and follows that perfect ass down the street.  

                                    END OF ACT V*
