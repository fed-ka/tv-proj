          DOCTOR EMMET COLE.  Dreamer, adventurer, showman.  Part Don 
          Herbert, part Carl Sagan, part Doctor Henry Walton Jones.  
          Wonder in his voice to make you believe in magic.

                                            DOCTOR EMMET COLE
                        Zenithoptera lanei.  Look at that.  
                        Gorgeous adaptations for flight.  
                        Muscles and wings that rotate 
                        independently.  He can fly over 36 
                        kilometers per hour in six 
                          directions.  Only thing I know this 
                        blue in nature are my wife s eyes 
                        first thing in the morning.
                                (gives us a look)
                        People say there s nothing left to 
                        discover in the world.  They ve 
                        just never left their apartments.  
                        I don t need a Bible to understand 
                        God.  I can cup His works.  There s 
                        magic out there.

        He lets the dragonfly go.  It circles round his head before 
          flying off, and we -- JUMP CUT TO:



        Cole in a SCUBA SUIT, climbing back aboard their boat, THE 
          MAGUS.  Coming up from a dive, thrilled.                                                                                      2.

                                            DOCTOR EMMET COLE
                        A frilled shark, near the surface!  
                        Came right up to me.  Did you get 
                        it?  Tell me you got it!

          Camera catches Tess.  She s got a YOUNG BOY in her lap.  
          Their SON, LINCOLN.  A family growing up together on film.

                                            TESS
                        We got it.



        Cole is draped in a large SNAKE.  Gross.  He loves it.

                                            DOCTOR EMMET COLE
                        He s like a Palm Viper, only the 
                        color variegation is different.  
                        Look at that.  We re filming a 
                        species no one has ever even seen 
                        before.  There are 4 million known 
                        species, but more than 500 million 
                          undiscovered.  We just found one.  
                        Lincoln!  Come.  He wants to play.

          Camera finds his son, NOW 12, hanging back, scared.

          Camera catches A YOUNG GIRL.  Playing with a SPIDER.

                                            DOCTOR EMMET COLE
                        Lena s not scared of a spider.  
                        Come, he won t hurt you.  He eats 
                        frogs and birds, not little boys.

        The boy comes, reluctantly.  Father puts son s hand on the 
          snake.  The boy cries.  Uncharmed by nature.  Cole looks 
        up, giving up.  TO CAMERA --

                                            DOCTOR EMMET COLE
                        Cut.  It s all right.  We ll go out 
                        with the bit of me and the Borneo 
                        kid.  He was terrific, big smile --

          Camera falls off center.  Focusing briefly on the hurt 
          Lincoln s face.  And we --

                                                                        FADE TO BLACK.

        THE TWO CAMERAS follow Tess, into...



          CAMERA JOSTLES, FOLLOWING, as --

                                            TESS
                        I need you, Lincoln.  I need you.

                                            LINCOLN
                              (had it)
                        No -- I gave enough to him -- that 
                        show.  He missed my life to inspire 
                        a billion people I could give a 
                        shit about.  For the  500 million 
                        undiscovered species.   You know 
                        what animals are to me?  Chicken, 
                        steak, bacon.  Lab rat.  Amazon is 
                        a website.  There s no magic out 
                        there.  I m not going --

                                            TESS
                        They won t pay if you don t go --

        This stops him.  Tess s voice breaks.  Small.

                                            TESS
                        The network.  They said it s both 
                        of us or no show...  I can t do it 
                        without you.

          Disbelief.  Lincoln looks to camera.  We catch CLARK.

                                            LINCOLN
                        You re serious?

                                            CLARK
                        That s the deal.  We pay for the 
                          expedition.  As long as it takes to 
                        find him.  But we get full 
                        unfettered access.  To both of you.

          Lincoln ignores Clark.  He hates him.  Talks low, to Tess:                                                                                    10.

                                            LINCOLN
                        Why?  They know Dad and I hated 
                        each other.

          Clark shoots straight.  Maybe even enjoying it:

                                            CLARK
                        That s why we want you.

                                            TESS
                                (beat)
                        Please...  Lincoln...  I need you.

        HOLD ON LINCOLN.  Seeing his mother.  So desperate.  They 
        may have their problems, their fights... but she s still 
        his mother.  And she s suffering.  And we --

                                                                                  CUT TO:

          SUPER CLOSE ON:  SAMMY S FACE.  OUR SECOND CAMERAMAN (25, 
        cool side of gearhead, MythBusters chic, game for 
          anything).  He tests the works on a WIDE-ANGLE CAMERA.

                                            SAMMY
                        We re good.   Eject Laserbeak! 

        AND HE... THROWS THE CAMERA!  INSTEAD OF FALLING, IT... 
          TAKES OFF... INTO THE AIR!  RISING HIGHER!  OVER...

        THE AMAZON RIVER!

          CHYRON:  DAY 2.  TONANTINS, BRAZIL.  AMAZONAS.

        WIDE ANGLES taken from A REMOTE CONTROLLED PLANE, dorkily 
          named  LASERBEAK  to the amusement of few.

          A STUNNING AERIAL VIEW OF THE S.S. HOPEWELL (a Red Cross 
          rescue vessel) chugging around a snaky bend in the river.

        The DRONE catches incredible shots no helicopter can.  
          Swooping insanely CLOSE to the emergent layer of the trees... 
          skimming the water alongside river dolphins who actually 
          wave... goosing a flock of herons, scattering them...



          CAMERA FINDS LINCOLN --

        On the bow.  He came.  He s scraping down a heavy dredge, 
        no stranger to hard work.  He takes a moment to stare out 
        at the endless rainforest lining the Amazon... the red and 
          purple crush of bromeliads... the kapoks and orchids and 
          water lilies.  God s fattest brushstrokes.                                                                                    11.

                                            CLARK (O.S.)
                        Pretty amazing, right?

                                            LINCOLN
                                (right into camera)
                        Go fuck yourself.

        He walks off, hauling more gear.  Camera lands on Clark.

                                            CLARK
                        He ll come around.

          LASERBEAK CAMERA POV AS -- IT FLIES BACK TO THE BOAT... 
          right up to Sammy.  HE CATCHES IT.  Brings it in.  Pleased 
        with himself, Sammy points the camera to a self-portrait, 
        the river behind him.  Waves like a doof.

          CHYRON:  SAMMY KIRSCH, SECOND CAMERAMAN.

                                            SAMMY
                        Hello!  I m on the Amazon!  Not a 
                        lot of other Jews out here!

        THE LEAD CAMERAMAN, ADJAY (tattoos, pretty much a dick), 
        PANS the TEN CREWMEN, shouting back and forth in SPANISH 
        and PORTUGUESE.  If you re white here, you stand out.

          ADJAY SHOOTS HIS OWN INTRO SHOT IN A MIRROR.  Toasts his 
          reflection with a BEER, then points where his CHYRON should 
        come up.  It does, right where he suggests:  ADJAY 
            CHANDRASEKARAN, LEAD CAMERAMAN.  (CHYRONS continue to 
          identify people as needed.)

                                            ADJAY
                        I just want to catch the close up 
                        when we find Cole s corpse and we 
                        get the wife crying.  Money shot.

        He finishes his beer, about to chuck it overboard.  TESS 
          GRABS IT.  WHACKS him upside the head.  She s CAPTAIN here.

                                            TESS
                        We re a green ship.  No waste.  
                        Nothing Emmet hated more than trash 
                        on the river.
                                (looks out)
                        Storm coming before we hit Tef .  
                        Don t throw up.



          Camera looks over Lincoln s shoulder at a MAP of the river, 
        then -- COMMOTION -- CAMERA JERKS to see:

          REESE BYRNE, (40s) a soldier s comportment, a boxer s 
          economy of movement.  Dedication and efficacy rubbed deep 
        into his skin.  Reese DRAGS a CREW MEMBER by his neck, 
          already has him zip-tied.  CHYRON:  CAPT. REESE BYRNE 
          (RETIRED), PRIVATE SECURITY.

        In one swift move Reese CUTS the zip tie and HURLS him over 
        the side of the boat -- onto shore.  Thrown off.

                                            REESE
                        Caught him trying to get into my 
                        gun safe.

          A slow turn back to the remaining CREW MEMBERS.  A warning.  
          Without words.  None needed.



        FIND TESS -- holding the signal detector.  It CHIMES 
          LOUDLY.  The BEEPS tight together.  She points ahead.

                                            TESS
                        The beacon s close!  That way!

        JUMP CUTTING as we get CLOSER.  The BEEPS on top of each 
          other now.  This is it.  What they came all this way to 
          find.  JUMP CUT:  BEEPBEEPBEEPBEEPBEEPBEEP --



        All hands in the river.  Combing everywhere.  Yelling in 
          three languages.  Floodlights probe the dark water.

          Camera catches MOVEMENT in the water -- a croc?

          Lincoln pushes ahead, furthest one out there.  Wading 
          through the marsh deep into the river, unafraid.

                                            EMILIO
                        HERE!  Found something.

        THE BEEPING CONTINUES -- LOUDER -- AS WE --

        JUMP CUT:  SPLASHING IN THE WATER -- A HOOK ROOTS AROUND, 
          CATCHES SOMETHING --

        JUMP CUT:  A PIECE OF METAL SURFACES --

        JUMP CUT:  A WINCH CRANKS, TUGGING.  SOMETHING HEAVY IN THE 
          CHURNING WATER.  FINALLY -- IT COMES UP:

        AN ALUMINUM DIVING CAGE.  DENTED.  THE SHOW LOGO ON IT.  
          INSIDE...  THE SIGNAL BEACON.  NOTHING ELSE.  IT S EMPTY.                                                                                    15.



        The smashed diving cage is splayed out.  Tess, Lincoln, 
          Emilio, Reese inspect.  All disheartened.

                                            REESE
                        I don t want to be the one to tell 
                        you what this looks like --

                                            TESS
                        I know what it looks like.  We 
                        don t know he was in that cage.

        She feels the weight of her own wishful thinking.

                                            LINCOLN
                        Whoever was, it was a long time 
                        ago.  That much oxidization, it 
                        could have been in the water three, 
                        four months.

                                            TESS
                                (holding faith)
                        Someone turned on the signal.  
                        Someone wanted us to come.

          Emilio has been going over the damaged cage.  Confused.

                                            EMILIO
                        It s backward.  Diving cage, when 
                        they break, something try to get 
                        in.  This lock, it was broke the 
                        other way...  Something try to get 
                        out.  Something strong.

          Everyone goes quiet.  Not sure what that means.  Not sure 
        of their next move.  Lincoln says what they re thinking.  
          Gentle with his mother s feelings:

                                            LINCOLN
                        The beacon s a dead end, Mom.  We 
                        got what we came for.  We have an 
                        answer.  We re done.

                                            TESS
                        No.  We keep going.

                                            LINCOLN
                        We don t even have a direction.

                                            TESS
                        I ll find one.

        Tess walks out.  HOLD ON THE BEACON.  A dead end.                                                                                    16.



        THE MOON shines huge and star-supported in the unpolluted 
        sky.  The boat CHUGS on.  Crew wound down.  CAMERA GRABS:

        -- Tess combs the map for an idea.  Absolutely not crying.

        -- Lincoln tries to read on an iPad.  The light from the 
          screen draws fat BUGS.  He flicks them off.

                                            ADJAY (O.S.)
                        What do you think?  Where to next?

                                            LINCOLN
                        Go fuck yourself.

        He walks out of frame.  Perfect place to... FADE TO BLACK.



          A GORGEOUS SUNRISE.  LASERBEAK S AERIAL FOOTAGE OF THE 
          RIVER.  Its epic beauty and mystery.  A sky alive with 
          colors unseen in life by you and me.

          CHYRON:  DAY 3.  RIVER MATAQA.  LASERBEAK catches something 
        on the horizon...  A HELICOPTER.  Approaching.



          Reese is on the deck fast.  Checks binoculars.

                                            REESE
                        Not military.  Friend of yours?

        The helicopter LANDS.  PILOTED BY... LENA.  CHYRON:  LENA 
          LANDRY, PILOT.  DAUGHTER OF RUSS LANDRY, MISSING CAMERAMAN.  
        The helicopter takes off.  Leaving Lena with her pack.



        Lena steps aboard off a dinghy.  Ready for a fight.

                                            LINCOLN
                        This place is dangerous, you 
                        shouldn t be here --

                        How could you not tell me?  His 
                        beacon went off!  There s hope 
                        they re still alive -- your dad, my 
                        dad!  And you didn t tell me?  Fuck 
                        you, I m coming --                                                                                    17.

                                            LINCOLN
                        The beacon was a dead end.  We 
                        don t even know where to look.

                                            LENA
                                (beat)
                        Yes we do.  I found The Magus.  I 
                        know where the boat is.

        All ears perk up.

                                            TESS
                        Where?  Where is it?

                        I m coming with you.

        Tess looks to Clark.  Lincoln shakes his head.  Beat.  
          Fuck.  They re stuck with her.

                        You need to sign a release.



        In private, Emilio tries to talk to Tess.  They speak in 
          PORTUGUESE, Emilio able to express concerns he can t in

                        The river there... nobody sails.  
                        The locals won t go near it.

                                            TESS
                        It s just the river.

                        Not this.  That is the Boi na.  The 
                        Black Snake.  The Boat Eater.  They 
                        believe it is full of spirits... 
                        bad magic... a... door to the

                        You actually believe that bullshit?                                                                                    19.

                        Every turn of the Amazon has some 
                        superstition or curse to keep out 
                        white people -- I m not here to cut 
                        down rainforest and grow coffee, 
                        I m trying to find Emmet -- 

          Reese comes.  Bad news in his eyes.

                        It s not going to be that easy.  I 
                        spoke to the captain -- the crew 
                        won t cross into the Boi na.  They 
                        don t want any part of it.

                                            TESS
                        We ll up their pay, they ll do it --

                        Not without trying to gut us first.

          Beat.  But Tess is undaunted.

                                            TESS
                        Fine.  Get them to take us as far 
                        as the Yutay.  It s a day from 
                        there.  We ll make our own way.

        The Team exchanges looks, uncertain, and we -- CUT TO:


          A CAMERA SKIMS A CENTIMETER OVER THE RIVER S SURFACE --


        TWO ZODIACS (high impact rubber lifeboats) motor down 
          river.  OUR TEAM OF NINE -- Tess, Lincoln, Lena, Reese, 
          Emilio, Jahel, Clark, Adjay, and Sammy -- split over two.  
        They reach a FORK.  The mouth of the Boi na (bo-YU-nah) is 
          OBSCURED by thick, low hanging trees.  Something meant to 
        be hidden.  CHYRON:  DAY 4.

        ON ZODIAC 1

                        Pull ashore.  I want to get a shot 
                        of them crossing into the Boi na 
                        through the turtles.

                        We re losing light, shoot from here.                                                                                    20.

                        It s backlit, it ll look like ass.

                        Use the B-7 filter at 24 and hold 
                        fucking steady.  I m not stopping.

        Tess GUNS her outboard engine.  Moving through the canopy.

        ON ZODIAC 2 -- ON CLARK, GRINNING AT HOW TESS CAN BE.

                                            CLARK
                        Not a lot of people know but... 
                        Cole s whole show was her concept.  
                        He always said, without Tess he d 
                        be teaching high school biology...  
                        Might ve been better off.

        And with that, the Zodiacs enter into the Boi na.  Into the 
          mist.  This is no longer merely the Amazon.  But a place 
          alive with its own awareness.  Quieter.  The water softly 
          rippling.  The INSECTS and BIRDS CALLING in new harmony.

        ON LENA AND LINCOLN

        Side by side on Zodiac 2.  An awkwardness between them.  A 
        long history neither plans to address on film.

                                            LENA
                        Thought I d hear from you at some 
                        point.  After they went missing.

                                            LINCOLN
                        Sorry.  Just school...  The lab.

                                            LENA
                        How s that going?  Make a new mouse 
                        yet?

                                            LINCOLN
                        Not yet.  Won an award.

                        An award.  Fancy.

                        And now the world is one base pair 
                        closer to a selectively activated 
                        NR2C in the internal granule cell 
                        layer of the mus musculus 
                          cerebellum.  Journal of Transgenics

                              (off his look)
                        You published your first article.  
                        Wouldn t miss it.

        He s surprised.  It actually means a lot to him.                                                                                    21.

                        That sounds... incredibly boring.

                                            LINCOLN
                        That s the point.  Beautifully 
                        boring.  Science isn t great big 
                        wonder anymore.  There are no huge 
                          discoveries left to be made.  Now, 
                        it s the steady push to fathom the 
                        details.  Micronic advancement.  
                        One base pair at a time.

                                            CLARK (O.S.)
                        You don t see magic out here?

          Camera PANS their gorgeous surroundings.  Lincoln gets what 
        he s gunning for --

                                            LINCOLN
                        You want me to wax poetic about the 
                        river... nature?  The Amazon is 68 
                        hundred kilometers long and lined 
                        with plastic bottles, cans, drug 
                        runners, and villages of people so 
                        poor they d be kings if they had 
                        just a week s trash of a family 
                        from Encino.  My father cut around 
                        what wasn t convenient to make the 
                        world look like it still had magic 
                        in it -- well it doesn t.  It has a 
                        million things that could ve killed 
                        him and one of them finally did.

                                            CLARK (O.S.)
                        Okay.  Then why d you come?

          Beat.  Lincoln has no answer.  Then --

          Seemingly from nowhere... a CLOUD OF DRAGONFLIES descends.  
          Surrounding them.  Brilliant blue.  The same Zenithoptera 
        Cole showed us in our opening shot.

        They engulf the boats.  Delicately.  As if for no other 
          reason than to enchant.  Crawling over them.  Landing on 
          their hands.  A truly magical moment.  Just for them.

        Even Lincoln can t help being charmed.

                                            LINCOLN
                        Okay that s pretty cool.

          Suddenly -- the dragonflies all disperse.  Scattering in a 
          single mass.  As if sensing something.

        Tess stands -- seeing it first.  They come round a bend in 
        the river... until... WE ALL SEE IT --                                                                                    22.

                        It s her.

        THE MAGUS.  COLE S BOAT.

        As much a character as any of our players.  A 70 footer, 
          powerful twin engines, currently afoul.  Wants a crew of 
        12, but can be handled by just one.  A pad on top holds a 
          badly damaged two-seater HELICOPTER.

        The ship is trapped in a shallow split of land.  Nose in 
        the mud.  Ass in the muck.  Hull beaten up.  Overgrown with 
        six months  worth of aggressive greenery.

        JUMP CUT THROUGH -- AS THEY GUN TOWARDS IT --

          Hello!Emmet!



        They fan out -- walking carefully over the inclined, mossy 
          deck.  They can see what bad shape the ship is in -- 
          clearly stuck here for months.  Tess fights fear --

                                            TESS
                        Is anyone here?  Hello!

        No answer.

        THEN -- A BELLOW ECHOES THROUGH THE SWAMP -- LIKE A GROWL -- 
        PART HUMAN, PART... NOT.  THEY ALL FREEZE --

                                            ADJAY (O.S.)
                        The hell was --  HELLO!

        Tess shushes him.  Listening.  Quiet.  Nothing but the wind 
          through the trees.  Then --

          BANG!  BANGBANGBANG!  BANG!

          A rhythmic POUNDING -- COMING FROM BELOW THEM!

                                            TESS
                        That was from inside -- someone s 
                        in the ship!  Find them!

                                                                        SNAP TO BLACK.

          which is RUNNING, sailing through the clear morning.  A 
          magical place.  A rare moment of introspection.

                                            CLARK
                        I liked Emmet.  We were colleagues 
                        a long time.  Argued a lot.  Won a 
                        lot of awards as a result.  What he 
                        never got is that all this wasn t 
                        about adventure.  It was a product.  
                        His show s syndicated around the 
                        world.  Translated into 65 
                        languages.  He sold them a belief 
                        in fantasy.   Magic.   So yeah, 
                        we re getting another bunch of 
                        episodes out of him, alive or dead.  
                        And it gives Tess something to do.

                        He barely saw a dime.  He didn t 
                        care.  Just wanted to find new 
                        kinds of monkey.
                                (beat)
                        Hope we find him.

        Hard to tell if we believe him.

          NOTE:  This is our first example of a convention of the

          CRASHING IN, AS WE -- SMASH BACK TO:



          Lincoln is in diving gear.  He lugs cutting tools, and a 
          handheld underwater camera platform.  KNIFE sheathed to his 
          thigh.  Sammy fits his MASK with a WATERPROOF CAMERA.                                                                                    29.

                        Be careful.  Please.

          A look between them.  A reminder that, despite everything, 
          she d die if anything happened to him.  A final moment, 
          Lincoln finding his courage and -- he jumps in the water --



          BUBBLES rise all around.  Labored scuba BREATHING.  Enough 
          sediment in the water to make long solid fingers of sunlight.

          Lincoln hugs the underside of the boat.  Skirts the viney 
          undergrowth.  Finds the HATCH.  PULLS it hard as he can.  

        It won t budge.  He LIGHTS an UNDERWATER BLOWTORCH, as --

          Directly below, a YELLOW-SPOTTED AMAZON STINGRAY breaks 
          camouflage.  Rising from the swampy bottom...

          HEADED RIGHT FOR HIM.  Lincoln sees the cloud of dust -- 
          DUCKS in time -- SWIMMING BACKWARDS and away -- into a 
          TANGLE OF VINES.  He tugs to keep from getting caught up in 
        them -- shaking something loose...

          A HUMAN BODY SINKS RIGHT ONTO HIS BACK!

          Mostly bones, limply clinging to him.  OFF LINCOLN S 
          UNDERWATER SCREAM -- SMASH TO:



          A fireworks SUNSET, toybox colors, as the day gives out.

        The Team stands around the full corpse.  Full minus an ARM.  
        What flesh left shredded.  Lena s almost too afraid to ask.

                                            LENA
                        Who was it?

        Tess inspects the severed HAND.  A RING still on it.

                        This was Eric s.  Navigator.  It s 
                        not your father.

        Tess holds Lena s hand.  Lincoln inspects the body.

                        This was brutal.  Compression 
                        fractures at the neck, vertebrae 
                        completely crushed.  Traumatic

                        And the arm wasn t cut -- it was 
                        torn out.  Complete avulsion like 
                        that, you need 2,000 psi of force.  
                        Like a car.  Or a bear.

                        You think he got hit by a car?  
                        Maybe a bear took his picnic 
                        basket.  You know this because 
                        you re, what, half a doctor?

                                            LINCOLN
                        You re right.  I m not a doctor 
                        yet.  I should be back in Chicago 
                        picking up the other half.  But I m 
                        here.  And that s what I see.

          CAMERA COMES OUT -- LOOKS AROUND -- HEARING MOTION --

        SEES NOTHING BUT WATER -- AND NIGHT -- AND A TERRIFIED CREW.

        ACT THREE

        FADE IN:



          Aftermath of the attack.  BLOOD ON THE FLOOR.  Nerves 
          frayed.  CHYRON:  NIGHT 4.  ABOARD THE MAGUS.  9:07 PM.

          ADJAY AND SAMMY -- film one another.  Sammy on edge.

                                            SAMMY
                        That was fucked.  That was fucked 
                        the fuck up.

                        turtles?  Strap on.

          REESE -- scans the area.  Relieved the Zodiacs are still 
          intact.  Cleated to The Magus, floating in the water.                                                                                    33.

                        No sign.  Whatever it was is gone 
                        into the trees.  The lifeboats are 
                        fine.

          LINCOLN AND LENA -- he cleans her WOUND, a nasty MOTTLED 
        GASH to her THIGH.  If it hurts -- and it does -- she 
          doesn t let on.

                                            LENA
                        Always thought you d make a good 
                        doctor.  Really hoping I was right.

                                            LINCOLN
                        Sorry.  Only half a doctor.

                                            LENA
                        You ll do.  How bad?

        He threads a needle.

                                            LINCOLN
                        Know how you used to think scars 
                        were sexy?  You re about to be much 
                        sexier.

        He STITCHES.  To take her mind off it, Lena eyes a familiar 
        old mounted barometer.  Pulls it off its hinge.  A small 
          hiding place behind it.

                                            LENA
                        I used to keep pot in there.

                                            LINCOLN
                        I know.  I used to steal it.

          A shared smile.  Some naked high school history to explore 
          someday.  Lincoln finishes.  Dresses her wound.  STOPS --

            A PRETERNATURAL GROWL coats the night.  Whatever that thing 
          was... it s out there.  Distant.  Not far enough.

        They catch eyes.  Nervous to be in the open.  Lincoln helps 
        Lena up.  Follow them into...



          Emilio grips the rope from a cleat out to the water -- THE 
        LINE HOLDING ONE OF THE ZODIACS.  SOMETHING is pulling on 
        the boat.  Drawing the line taut.  Like a wild animal 
          caught on the other end --                                                                                    39.

                          Something s stealing the Zodiacs --

                                (SUBTITLED)
                        It doesn t want us to leave.  It 
                        has tasted blood.  It wants more.

          Whatever s on the other end is STRONG -- YANKS the rope 
        from their hands.  THE CLEAT BENDS -- THEN -- RIPS OUT -- 
          WHIPPING THROUGH THE AIR --

          Camera catches the Zodiac DRAG AWAY -- gone.

          REESE FIRES HIS GUN -- FOUR SHOTS -- each FLASH of fire 
          briefly lights up the night.

        THAT FEARSOME BELLOW ECHOES.  MOVEMENT.

                                            LINCOLN
                        It s coming around again...  It s 
                        going for the second boat!

        He races to the rear, where the Zodiac 2 is tied to the 
          anchor line.  The heavy chain YANKS!

          Lincoln reaches for it, leaning over the water, vulnerable.

        He grabs hold -- the chain JERKS --

          LINCOLN IS PULLED FORWARD -- OFF THE BOAT -- HANGING OVER -- 

                                            LINCOLN
                        Help me!

        He s looking to ADJAY S CAMERA -- BUT ADJAY KEEPS FILMING 
          RATHER THAN HELP --

          Sammy drops his camera -- grabbing hold -- he and Reese 
        PULL Lincoln back aboard.  A beat -- 

        THE CHAIN WRENCHES -- THE BOAT QUAKES --

        THE AWFUL SOUND OF METAL TWISTING AS --

        THE ANCHOR CHAIN TEARS OUT OF THE HULL --

        THE LAST ZODIAC DISAPPEARS INTO THE DARKNESS.

          Their only way out.  Gone.

                                                                        SNAP TO BLACK.

        ACT FOUR

        FADE IN:



          SOARING LASERBEAK FOOTAGE.  The Amazon ROARS.  Volcanic 
          currents.  A reminder of how much power it can wield.



          Reese is uncomfortable in front of the camera.

        He walks off.  Interview over.



        As we left them.  Scared.  Stuck.  Lincoln could kill.  
          Adjay backs up, filming Lincoln s assault on him.  

                                            ADJAY (O.S.)

        BAM!  Lincoln PUNCHES Adjay.  Knocks him on his ass.  Walks 
        off.  Adjay picks himself up, thinks about going after him.  
          Sammy holds him back, shakes his head.  Don t.

                        You have two and a half hours.  
                        Just work the engine, keep us alive 
                        long enough to fix the rest.  Can 
                        you do it?

                                            EMILIO
                        No.  But I will.

                                            LINCOLN
                        We need to be moving by 4:43 AM.

                                            CLARK
                        What happens then?

                                            TESS
                                (catching on)
                        High tide.

                                            LINCOLN
                        We get one chance to shove her out, 
                        be ready.  I ll clear the prop.  
                        Everyone else eyes open, signal if 
                        you so much as see a bug over the 
                        running lights.  Reese, I d like a 
                        gun.

          Reese hesitates, then hands him his sidearm.  Lincoln 
          moves.  All follow to their positions.

                                            CLARK
                              (to Tess)
                        Kid s starting to sound like him.



        JUMP CUT THROUGH as Lincoln strips down -- wades into the 
          waist-high water/sludge at the ship s rear.  Camera 
          (Sammy s) follows him.  He stares right into it -- Really?

                                            LINCOLN
                        At least be useful.  Shoot anything 
                        that s not us.

        He hands Sammy the gun.  Lena comes, strips down to help.

                                            LINCOLN
                        Swamp can t be good for your wound.

                                            LENA
                        It s okay, I know a doctor.

        She wades up.  Together they begin the rather disgusting 
        work of pulling vines and scum out of the prop.  Romantic.    
        Yet these two seem to draw comfort from one another.

                                            LENA
                        Sad seeing The Magus like this.

                                            LINCOLN
                        She was always more of a home to 
                        you than me.  You were the only 
                        thing I ever liked about it.

                                            LENA
                        Not enough to stay.
                                (beat)
                        So Emilio works his hoodoo and we 
                        all get home safe...

        Lena allows some relief.  Lincoln isn t there yet.

                                            LINCOLN
                        This just gives us a chance.  That 
                        thing isn t going to let us just 
                        sail out of here.  And I don t think 
                        it cares if we shoot it.  If we 
                        don t figure out a way to hurt it...

        We won t make it.

          A FLUTTER in the distance makes them freeze.  Beat.  A BAT 
          flies overhead.  Relief.  They continue their sticky work.

                                            LENA
                        We live through this, I m telling 
                        everyone in your lab you believe in 
                        ghosts.  They ll throw you in 
                        science jail.                                                                                    44.

                                            LINCOLN
                                (smiles, beat)
                        Everything I ever studied tells me 
                        we re all caught up in group 
                        hysteria and it s probably just a...

                                            LENA
                        A panther.

                                            LINCOLN
                        But if it s anything... other... 
                        something unnatural... we need to 
                        know more.

        He dives under -- leaving Lena alone a moment with her 
          thoughts.  His words weighing heavily on her.

          After a moment he burst back to the surface, holding a 
          final clump of vine.  He wipes the swampshit from his face.

                                            LINCOLN
                        Nature is just disgusting.  We re 
                        good to go.

                                            LENA
                                (beat)
                        There s something you should see.



          Lincoln finds his mother.  Sees she s crying.  MOUNTED 
          CAMERAS follow, ZOOMING in.  Catching the subtle expression 
        on his face as he considers leaving her be.  Then --                                                                                    47.

                                            LINCOLN
                        You shouldn t be out in the open 
                        alone.
                                (beat, trying)
                        You re right, we don t know what 
                        happened after.  He could still be 
                        alive.

                                            TESS
                        All that time.  He was on some... 
                        quest.  How could he not tell me?

                                            LINCOLN
                        He never told me anything.  Lena 
                        was always more a daughter to him 
                        than I was a son.  Come on, you two 
                        had your secrets from each other.

                                            TESS
                        No.  We didn t.

          Something about that stops him.  Eroding his sympathy for 
        his mother.  Already strained.  He s tired of it.  From a 
          lifetime of playing a part.

                                            LINCOLN
                        Enough with the act already.  The 
                        show s over.  We weren t a perfect 
                        family, Mom.  He wasn t perfect.  I 
                        sure as hell wasn t.  And you...

        He stops.  But it hits a nerve with her.  All this time 
        he s been hard on her -- she begins to fear she knows why.

                                            TESS
                        Me what?  What about me?

                                            LINCOLN
                        Forget it, I don t want to do this.

                                            TESS
                        Do what?  Don t walk away from me -- 
                        how was I not perfect enough for 
                        you?

                                            LINCOLN
                        I m not a kid, and I m not an 
                        idiot.  All those years you re his 
                        partner, his captain, his muse, 
                        then all of a sudden he goes off 
                        without you?  And you let him?  Who 
                        was it anyway?  Always was curious.

        Tess goes cold.  The reason he s been so unsympathetic.  
        She had no idea he knew.                                                                                    48.

                                            TESS
                        That s none of your business.

                                            LINCOLN
                        Can t play that card, you made our 
                        lives the whole world s business.  
                        You cheated on Dad with someone else 
                        so he cheated on you with his work.

                                            TESS
                        That is not fair -- 

                                            LINCOLN
                        -- Maybe that s why he went off the 
                        deep end, looking for something to 
                        believe in.  Because he sure as 
                        hell couldn t believe in you.

        She slaps him.  He barely registers it.

                                            TESS
                        You have no idea what our lives 
                        were.

                                            LINCOLN
                        Sure I do.  I know why you re out 
                        here, in the middle of a jungle, 
                        refusing to let go, willing to get 
                        yourself killed.  No one goes this 
                        far for love.  But guilt?  Sure, 
                        that d get you to the Amazon.
                                (beat)
                        You should feel guilty -- you drove 
                        him to this. You were the magic in 
                        his life.  And when he lost you...

        He knows he s gone too far.  They stare in the silence 
          after regretted words spoken.  The silence broken as...

        The ship SHUDDERS.  THE ENGINE GIVES A BIG DIESEL COUGH... 
        THEN COMES TO LIFE.  Started.  Emilio did it.

                                            LINCOLN
                        Good.  Let s go home.

        HE LOOKS RIGHT INTO THE MOUNTED CAMERA AS HE PASSES.

                                            LINCOLN
                        You get all that?



        The tide has risen high enough to submerge the propellers.

        The engine GRINDS, straining, an out of shape athlete.  The 
          props WHIP the thick water into foam.  Going nowhere.



        The Magus CREEPS forward... an inch...  a foot... a yard... 
        INTO THE WATER.  The inclined deck finally straightens out.  
        THE MAGUS IS AFLOAT!



          Cameras find each of the Team -- catching their expressions 
        -- varying degrees of relief and celebration.



          A MOUNTED CAMERA catches Adjay stepping outside.  Move to --                                                                                    51.

          ADJAY S CAMERA POV (NIGHT VISION):  Camera sweeps the 
          river.  Looking for any sign of movement.

                                            ADJAY (O.S.)
                        Where you at, Slimer?  Let s see 
                        that face.

          Again -- WHAM!  HARDER this time.  The ship lists.  Adjay 
          thinks it s funny, unafraid.

                                            ADJAY (O.S.)
                        That s it...  If you re solid 
                        enough to sink us, you re solid 
                        enough for hi-def.  Come on... come 
                        to Uncle Adjay...  I ll make you 
                        samosa just like Nani Ma.



          SAMMY S CAMERA POV:  Coming out to the deck, joining Adjay.

                                            ADJAY
                        Someone grew a pair.

                                            SAMMY (O.S.)
                        Suck it.  I m getting the shot.

          INTERCUT THE TWO CAMERA POVS.  They split up, cowboys in 
        the dark.  Adjay incapable of fear, Sammy hiding his.  
          CAMERAS JOSTLE, following the creature s chilling whirl.                                                                                    52.

                                            SAMMY (O.S.)
                        Watch out -- it s coming back! --

                                            ADJAY (O.S.)
                        Stay on your side!

        STAY WITH SAMMY S POV FOR THE REST OF THE ACTION, AS --

          CAMERA WHIPS AROUND, TRYING TO CATCH A SHOT --

          SOMETHING CIRCLES ROUND THE SHIP -- SCREECHING -- THEN --

          BASHES A FIBERGLASS WALL, CRAZING IT WITH CRACKS --

                                            SAMMY (O.S.)
                        Motherfucker -- it s here! --

          SAMMY RUNS TOWARD THE EDGE -- CRANING OVER -- LOOKING OUT --

        ALL TOO QUICKLY -- WITH A HURRICANE SOUND -- LIKE AN ARROW 
          COMING RIGHT AT YOUR EYES -- IT COMES AT HIM --

        WE SEE NOTHING.  HEAR A WET SOUND.  A GURGLE.

          CAMERA DROPS.  IT LANDS AT AN ODD ANGLE ON THE DECK.

          SAMMY S BODY FALLS ACROSS FRAME.  INCHES FROM CAMERA.

                                            ADJAY (O.S.)
                        Holy shit -- holy shit --

        WE HEAR ADJAY DROP HIS CAMERA AND RUN THE FUCK AWAY --

        NO MOVEMENT FOR AN UNCOMFORTABLY LONG BEAT.

        THEN SAMMY S BODY IS YANKED OUT -- GRABBED --

          CAMERA FOLLOWS AFTER -- STRAPPED TO HIS WRIST --

          VIOLENTLY FLUNG -- SPINNING THROUGH THE AIR --

          CATCHING PITCHED FRAMES OF HIS ROTATING LIMP BODY -- THEN --

          SLAMS AGAINST THE BOAT S HULL!

        ACT FIVE.

        FADE IN:



          Still dark.  But the stars are fading.  Morning is coming.  
        Just not fast enough.  CHYRON:  6:01 AM.  PRELAP FOOTSTEPS.



        The Magus strains with all its limited strength -- powering 
          through the river.



        We see Lincoln, Tess, Reese run out, COVERED on --                                                                                    55.

          ADJAY S CAMERA POV:  From where he dropped it.  Meticulously 
          placed by chance to cover ONLY A FRACTION of the action.

          INTERCUT THE DROPPED HANDHELD WITH ONE MOUNTED OVERHEAD 
          CAMERA IN MUDDY NIGHT VISION VIEW.  Together we see SOME -- 
        BUT NOT ALL -- OF WHAT IS HAPPENING.  AND IT HAPPENS FAST:

          LINCOLN -- sees (we only hear) CIRCLING OVERHEAD.  The 
          creature moves with HURRICANE FORCE and SOUND.

                                            REESE
                        My God.  It s coming around!

          REESE -- raises his GUN.  FIRES.  A BELLOW in anger.  THE 
        BOAT LURCHES -- HIT -- REESE FALLS OUT OF FRAME.

          LINCOLN -- steps forward.  Tracks something overhead.  Hand 
          DRIPPING with BLOOD.

                                            LINCOLN
                        Here -- you want blood!  Take it!  
                        Come on -- take mine!

        O.S. -- something SWOOPS -- someone SCREAMS -- Tess SHOUTS:

                                            TESS (O.S.)
                        WAIT!

        TESS -- STANDS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FRAY.  RISKING 
          EVERYTHING.  FACING THE CREATURE ABOVE.  ADDRESSING IT!

                                            TESS
                        Wait!  Here!  Over here!  Cam 
                        Travers!  Your name is Cam Travers!

                                            LINCOLN
                        Mom -- What are you -- !

          A BLUR OF MOVEMENT -- COMING AT HER.

          CLARK -- DIVES FORWARD, IN FRONT OF TESS, PROTECTING HER.

                                            CLARK
                        Get away from her!

          CLARK -- IS KNOCKED BACK INTO A WALL -- SLAMS -- crumples 
        like pajamas.

        TESS -- PRESSES AHEAD.  MAD DETERMINATION.

                                            TESS
                        Your name was Cam Travers...  You 
                        were married to Elise...  You were 
                        a man...  I know you remember --

          Beat.  The GROWLING STOPS.  As if she s getting through.                                                                                    56.

        TESS -- IS LOOKING UP IN ONE PLACE.  As if the creature has 
          STOPPED.  Lincoln at her side -- looking up with her.

                                            LINCOLN
                        Mom -- get out of here, now --

                                            TESS
                                (CALLING OUT TO IT)
                        You remember.  Tell me -- is Emmet 
                        alive?  Is he still alive?

        The creature WAILS.  Tess doesn t back down.  

                                            TESS
                        Did you kill him?  Tell me!  COME 
                        ON, SCREAM IT! -- ONCE FOR DEAD -- 
                        TWICE FOR ALIVE...  COME ON YOU SON 
                        OF A BITCH!  TELL ME! --

          A pause -- as if an answer is about to come -- then --

          SUDDEN MOVEMENT -- SOUND OF AN ATTACK!

        WE CATCH AN EIGHTH-SECOND GLIMMER OF A PHANTASMIC SHAPE, 
          VAGUELY HUMAN, MOVING TOO FAST TO TELL -- THEN --

        TESS FALLS OUT OF FRAME.  Sound of flesh tearing -- Tess 
          SCREAMING --

                                            LINCOLN
                        No! -- get the fuck off!

          LINCOLN -- RUNS AT HER -- AT IT -- DIVES!

        ALL AT ONCE ALL NOISE STOPS.  THE GHOST IS GONE.

        ALL IS QUIET.

        Only the soft whimper of Tess.  Hurt.

                                            LINCOLN
                        Mom!  Are you okay?  Let me look --

          There s no light.  Lincoln sets down the bowl -- NOW SEALED 
          TIGHT -- grabs the dropped handheld camera to use its light 
        to examine her wounds.

        SHE IS BLEEDING FROM HER ABDOMEN.  He lifts her shirt.

          THERE -- ACROSS HER STOMACH -- CLEAR IN THE LIGHT --

        TWO MOTTLED GASHES.  TWO.

           TWICE FOR ALIVE.                                                                                     57.

                                            TESS
                        Look.  Look.  Emmet s alive... I 
                        told you.  He s...

        And she passes out.

                                                                        FADE TO BLACK.

        FADE BACK UP ON:



        The safety of daylight.  A new day the Team is lucky to see.

          Jahel steers The Magus.  It sails again.  Beaten up but 
          incapable of giving out...

          Emilio hangs over the port side railing, making repairs to 
        the hull on the move...

        Lena is on the helicopter pad, working on the helicopter...

          CHYRON:  THE AMAZON RIVER.  DAY 5.



        Tess where we saw her, on the bow.  Private thoughts.  Glad 
        to see Lincoln come join her.  Followed by Adjay s CAMERA.

                                            LINCOLN
                              (off her cuts)
                        How re you feeling?

                                            TESS
                        Fine.

        Too tough to say otherwise.  Lincoln sees she s got the 
          WOODEN BOWL.  Tightly bound.  Holding it over the railing.

                                            LINCOLN
                        If it s actually in there, we re 
                        consigning it to a life of torment.

        She throws the thing into the river.  It sinks.  Fuck him.

                                            TESS
                        It tried to hurt you.

          Beat.  A DRAGONFLY whizzes by.  Its tail shines bright.

        Tess looks to camera, to Adjay.  Wanting privacy.

                                            TESS
                        Adjay, a minute.  Come on...

          Reluctantly, Adjay CLICKS his camera OFF.

          BLACK.  For a moment.  Then --

          A NEW ANGLE.  Them on the bow.  One of the MOUNTED CAMERAS.  
          Catching them at their backs, perfectly framed against the 
          water.  The coast.  The breeze.  The birds in the air.

                                            TESS
                        I thought I knew your father.

                                            LINCOLN
                        Me too.                                                                                    60.

                                            TESS
                        The last dated tape puts him headed 
                        East, toward the mountains.  We can 
                        turn around.  We can go home.

                                            LINCOLN
                        No.  Dad s alive.  He s somewhere 
                        on this river.  We re going to 
                        follow his every move.  Until we 
                        find him.

                                            TESS
                        You sure?  Give up everything to 
                        believe some ghost?

                                            LINCOLN
                        Dad was on to something.  
                        Something... big.

        For the first time in his life, he understands:

                                            LINCOLN
                        There s magic out there.
                                (beat)
                        Let s go see it.

        Tess smiles.  It s good to have her son back.

          A long beat.  Watching the water.  Peaceful.  Magical.

                                            TESS
                                (pointing to it)
                        You know there s a camera right 
                        there.

                                            LINCOLN
                        I know.

                                                                    CAMERA SNAPS OFF.

                                                                                      END.
