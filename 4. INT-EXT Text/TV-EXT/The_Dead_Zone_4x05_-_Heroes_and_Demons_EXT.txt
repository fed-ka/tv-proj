          A slight BOY in his early teens, a worn leather rucksack
          over one shoulder, makes his way tentatively through the
          tall trees.  He pauses to peer up at the daylight that is
          all but blocked by the dense foliage.

                        It is often in the darkest times,
                        when our strength and will are
                          weakest, that we are challenged
                        to set out on an unfamiliar path. 
                        So it was for young Finn.



          Finn covers his ears and ducks behind a rock.

                        And though his courage was often
                          tested...



                                         RIM  (V.O.)
                        ... A grand wizard named Eldgar.

          FOG obscures our view as we make our way up the curving
            driveway.  A door looms, then a small gloved finger reaches
          up into frame up and hits the doorbell. 

          A beat, then the door opens, and our POV looks down,
          focusing on a man's SHOES as they step into frame.

                                        MAN (O.S.)
                        Hello there.

          And now, abruptly, camera breaks from the POV to reveal:


          JOHNNY SMITH

          looking down at his visitor:  a small 12-YEAR-OLD BOY
          wearing a bulging knapsack.  The boy's eyes, fixed on the
          flagstones of Johnny's front landing, now dart to the
          house, then to the driveway -- anything but Johnny himself.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Can I help you?

          But the boy remains silent.  Off Johnny, puzzled by this
          odd visitor...

                                                                              FADE OUT.

          Johnny continues to eye the silent boy.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Are you all right?  It's a heck
                        of a night to be wandering around
                        on your own.  You're not lost,
                        are you?

          Still without looking at Johnny, the boy takes piece of
          GOLD BRAID from a pocket and holds it out to him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Look, if this is some joke your
                        friends put you up to, you knocked
                        on the wrong door.

          But the boy continues to hold out the piece of braid. 
          His glances darting near, but never connecting with Johnny.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Fine.  Joke's on me, I guess.

          He takes the piece of braid.  WHOOSH! 


  1313VISION:  THE SAME GOLD BRAID

          Only now it's attached to the sleeve of a man's police
          dress uniform.  It's starting to come loose from the
          jacket.  We pull back to reveal the BOY staring at it as
          he stands beside the man (RYAN FALLON, late 40s), who
          looks down at him, sees him staring at his sleeve, and
          shakes his head sadly.  Pulling back more to reveal Johnny
          standing on the boy's other side as he realizes he's --



          Two burly FEDERAL AGENTS in DEA wind breakers haul a
          handcuffed Ryan Fallon, now in plain clothes, toward an
          unmarked sedan, passing Johnny, who again notes Stanton,
          also in plain clothes, angrily pacing the feds --

                                        STANTON
                        At least take the goddamn cuffs
                        off!  He's a cop for christsake!



          A tough but well-maintained working class neighborhood. 
          Finding Bruce's SUV pulled to the curb, with Johnny outside
          on the sidewalk showing a map to an elderly Dog Walker.

                        into an itty-bitty two-gig flash
                          drive...



          The SUV cruises past a CABLE TV VAN with tinted windows.


2929A POV ANGLE FROM INSIDE THE VAN

            Observing the SUV as it parks down the street.  Bruce,
          Johnny and Thaddeus get out, then cross the street to a
          small house that's seen better days.



          Johnny and Bruce eye the front yard littered with abandoned
          toys and kids' bikes.  Johnny checks the house number
          against a slip of paper.

                                        JOHNNY
                        1409.  Home sweet home.

          Thaddeus's response is to head up the walk, as Johnny and
          Bruce follow.

                        She should be expecting us.

          Sounds of video game mayhem from inside as they approach
          the door.  Thaddeus waits as Johnny rings the bell.  A
          second ring prompts a woman to shout:

                        Jimmy!  Evan!  Somebody get the
                        damn door!

          As Johnny and Bruce exchange looks --



          Johnny and Bruce head down the walk.

                        one at stake here. 

          They've reached the car.  Johnny turns, almost angry.

                        I know what it feels like to grow
                        up without a father.  If there's
                        any chance I can spare Thaddeus
                        those feelings, I'll take it.

          At which point the VAN we saw earlier zooms up, the side

          One of the men (DUFFY) pulls up his jacket, reveals the
          butt of a gun and a detective's BADGE on his belt.

          Johnny/Ryan runs along a high, cement-walled embankment,

          game on a drop down screen while his driver stares out at
          the dark rail yard.  Three gunshots echo in the distance. 
          Kujo puts down the controller, speed dials his cell, then
          listens briefly before hanging up.  To the driver:

          they illuminate a high, graffiti-covered wall.  The vision
          FREEZES.  Off Johnny as he leans forward to study that
          wall, making a disturbing connection.  He's seen it before.

                          "Doesn't get his hands dirty."

          Johnny nods as they reach the car, still disturbed.

                                        JOHNNY
                        There's something else.

                                        CALLIE (V.O.)
                        Just a minute...



            Vision-Johnny watches as Younger Thaddeus, now clearly
          revealed as a witness to the scene, scrambles to his
          unconscious father's side.  The DEA agent lies nearby.  
          His father's gold shield has fallen on the ground. 
          Thaddeus picks it up -- just as a bright light sweeps the
          area.  It's a DEA helicopter.  Sirens sound.  Police and
          feds are starting to converge on the scene.  Scared and
            overwhelmed, Thaddeus runs off.



          Tilting down to find Johnny, Bruce and Thaddeus with Mitch
          Stanton staring up at it.

                                        STANTON
                        I'm not sure what this can tell
                        you.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That makes two of us.

          He reaches out, touches the wall.  We hear a WHOOSH.

                                        BRUCE
                        See anything?

                        The history of graffiti.

          He takes a step toward the boy, who instinctively retreats.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I know you don't like being
                          touched.  But it's the only way I
                        can be sure what you saw.  I won't
                        hurt you.

          He takes another step; Thaddeus backs against the wall.

                                        BRUCE
                        You can't force it, John.  You'll
                        freak him out.

          Indeed, the boy already looks like a cornered animal, his
          eyes darting wildly.  A beat, then Johnny crouches down,
            addresses the boy more gently.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Something you may not know about
                        me.  I lost my father when I was
                          a little boy.  Not a day goes by
                        when I don't think about him, or
                        wish I could bring him back.  But
                        the two of us, working together...
                        we have a chance to bring your
                        father back to you.  I need you
                        to be brave and to trust me, just
                        like you'd trust him.

          A beat, then Thaddeus tentatively makes eye contact and
          slowly extends his hand.  Johnny takes it -- WHOOSH!

    7474SUDDENLY DAY BECOMES NIGHT AND THE WALL RECEDES 50 YARDS
          AS JOHNNY AND THADDEUS REMAIN FROZEN IN THE FOREGROUND

          Johnny stands, still holding Thaddeus's hand as he turns
          to see Younger Thaddeus peering from behind some track
            equipment at the graffiti wall as a man runs by -- the
          DEA agent -- followed by Ryan Fallon.






                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Heroes & Demons" - THREE - 3/7/05 - YELLOW 39.


    74CONTINUED:74

          The scene FREEZES and Johnny turns, sees Kujo's Navigator
          parked in the shadows across the yard, facing the wall.



          Johnny and Thaddeus are still by the wall as Johnny stares
          across the yard.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Thaddeus was over there, watching. 
                        He saw his dad run past this wall,
                        chasing another man.  Kujo was
                        here too.
                                (to Thaddeus)
                        Did you stay there, Thaddeus, or
                        did you follow them?

          In response, Thaddeus tugs on Johnny's hand, leading him
            toward...


7676A TANGLE OF SWITCH TRACKS

          Thaddeus pauses here, eyes focused on a section of track. 
          Johnny crouches and touches a rail.  WHOOSH! 


  7777DAY BECOMES NIGHT AGAIN

          And Johnny finds himself crouching by the tracks as Younger
          Thaddeus runs into frame, then stops, transfixed by what
          he's seeing, which Johnny now sees too:

          THE SWITCH TRACKS are a web of shifting, reflected light,
          a work of abstract art.  Johnny and Younger Thaddeus look
          up from the tracks and see a dark amoeba-like blob
            wriggling against a bright light.

          Then the image focuses, and Johnny sees it's a
            foreshortened view of Ryan chasing the DEA agent down the
          tracks toward the headlight of an approaching train.



            Thaddeus, who we sense is reliving the events himself,
            anxiously pulls Johnny forward, Bruce and Stanton trailing.


          NEW ANGLE

          As they cross several tracks, then Thaddeus stops short,
          as though reacting to something.  WHOOSH!           DEAD ZONE: "Heroes & Demons" - THREE - 3/8/05 - GREEN 40.



          Johnny, holding Thaddeus's hand, is again watching Younger
          Thaddeus as he reacts to the sound of THREE RAPID GUNSHOTS. 
          The boy now steps out from behind the end of a freight
          car and sees a silhouetted figure, his back to us, holding
          a gun as he stands over the unconscious Ryan Fallon.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He saw the killer.



          Bruce and Stanton following Johnny and Thaddeus's looks. 
          (Note: in real life, as opposed to the vision, there is
          no freight car here; just an empty section of track.)

                                        STANTON
                        Could you see him?  The killer, I
                        mean.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (still in the vision)
                        His back's to me.  Wait, he's
                          turning.


  8181IN THE VISION

          The man indeed turns, as if sensing eyes on him.  But
          before we can see his face, both Thaddeus and his younger
          vision-self duck down, scrambling under the freight car.


          UNDER THE FREIGHT CAR - VISION

          Johnny finds himself crouching with both boys, their
            attention now fixed on a scattering of flattened coins,
          now clearly left on the tracks by kids, resting atop the
          angular stones of the rail bed.  But as Younger Thaddeus
          picks up a shiny squished nickel, a man's shadow falls
          over the other coins.  They freeze, and Johnny turns to
          see the killer's legs just a few feet away.

          Suddenly the killer's cell phone rings -- a distinctive
            "melodic" ring tone.  The distraction allows Younger
          Thaddeus to scramble away, ending the vision.



          Johnny stands, releasing Thaddeus's hand.  Stanton and
          Bruce look at him expectantly.

                                        JOHNNY
                        We didn't see his face.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Heroes & Demons" - THREE - 3/7/05 - YELLOW 41.


    82CONTINUED:82

          Stanton shakes his head, as though irritated he's bought
          into this and yet annoyed it isn't panning out.

                                        JOHNNY
                        We heard something.

          He takes out his cell phone, shows it to Thaddeus.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That melody you've been humming,
                        that was the sound of his cell
                        phone.  The sound of the man who
                        hurt your father. 

          In response, Thaddeus hums the tune again.

                                        STANTON
                        A ring tone?

                                        JOHNNY
                        To identify the shooter.

                                        BRUCE
                        Who we know was working for our

                                        STANTON
                        Let's say you find the guy, what
                        are the odds he'd have the same
                        phone?  It was five years ago.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm not saying it's evidence, but
                        it's something.

                                        STANTON
                        None of which is gonna get my
                        lieutenant on board.  It isn't
                        even testimony if the kid can't
                        speak.

          Johnny nods.  This is all painfully clear to him too.

                                        JOHNNY
                          According to Ryan's account,
                          Thaddeus was with him most of
                        that day.

                        You can't tote Thad along like a

                        right, it could be dangerous.

                        He's right.  We need to take him
                        home.

          He crouches in front of the boy.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You did good, Thad.

          Johnny, Thaddeus and Bruce make it to the lawn just as
          the whole house goes, knocking them all down again, then
          raining cinders around them.  Off Johnny as he looks back
          at the burning house, sirens starting to sound in the

          FADE IN:


          Or what was a house.  Just blackened ruins now, a crew of
          firemen dousing the embers.  All as seen through the
          viewfinder of a NEWS VIDEO CAMERA as we pan across the
          scene, meanwhile hearing:

                                        FEMALE REPORTER (O.S.)
                        With less than 24 hours until his
                          scheduled execution, a fire has
                          destroyed Ryan Fallon's former
                        home, now occupied by his sister
                        and her family.

          The viewfinder finds the reporter doing her stand-up.  In
          the background, Callie's twins start jumping around and
          mugging at the camera.

                          Fortunately, no one was harmed. 
                        No word on the cause of the blaze,
                        but --

                        Crap!

          He's just caught the twins mooning him (sufficiently out
          of focus, though we get the idea).  As the videocam comes
          off his shoulder, revealing him --

                        That's it.  We're out of here.

          They start toward their TRUCK, as the giggling boys scamper
          past them, more excited than dismayed by the whole scene.

          Not so their mom, whom camera finds next on the sidewalk,
          being consoled by NEIGHBORS.  She sees a car pull up, a
          man in a suit get out.

                        Now I can move to a decent
                          neighborhood.

          Her neighbors react, stung, as camera pulls back again to
          find Johnny, Bruce and Stanton watching a short distance.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah.

          At which point, Lieutenant Dobbs approaches.

                                        DOBBS
                        Fire Marshal's calling it an
                          accident.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I saw one of Kujo's thugs messing
                        with the gas line.

                                        DOBBS
                        What you claim to see in your
                        head doesn't interest me.

                                        STANTON
                          Lieutenant, I had my doubts, but
                        what if Kujo is coming for the
                        kid?  If he set Fallon up, that'd
                        be his play.

          Dobbs controls his irritation.

                                        DOBBS
                        Have a uniform babysit the kid
                        for the next 24 hours.  If you
                        want to help Fallon, get me some
                        hard evidence.

          The Fire Marshal signals him.  He moves off.

                        He's right.  We're just spinnin'
                        our wheels, and the clock keeps
                          ticking.

          He gets a call on his cell (the ring is NOT the one
          Thaddeus heard), steps away to take it.  Johnny seems to
          consider him for a moment, then takes out his own phone.

                                        BRUCE
                        Who you calling?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Purdy.  He's got political
                          connections.  Maybe he can twist
                        an arm or two. 
                                (re: phone)
                        Damn.  Battery's dead.

          He turns to Stanton, who's just finished his call.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Okay if borrow yours?

          Stanton hesitates for the briefest of seconds, then hands
          it over with a smile.

                                        STANTON
                        Don't use up my minutes.

          As Johnny takes the phone we may hear a small WHOOSH, but
          then he quickly dials his number, listens.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's Johnny Smith.  Is he
                        available?  I see.  No, I'll try
                        back later.

          As he speaks, his gaze falls on Thaddeus, who's
            methodically inventorying and reordering his comics. 
          Johnny hands the phone back to Stanton, moves to the boy.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Thaddeus, can I take a look at
                        your drawing pad again?

          Thaddeus hands over his pad.  Johnny opens it, shows it
          to Stanton and Bruce.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The stories are all based on his
                        life.  See this one?

          He points to an image of the Wizard, holding Finn's hand,
          as they pick their way through a plain of sleeping dragons.

                        That was today, at the train yard. 
                        I was leading Thad past these old
                        freight cars.

                                        BRUCE

                        What's your point?

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's an allegory.  A way Thaddeus
                        records his experience.  And he's
                        been doing it for years, including
                        the night his father was arrested.

                                        BRUCE
                        A kind of "witness testimony."

          Johnny eyes Thaddeus, who's seemingly paying them no mind.

                                        JOHNNY
                        If we can match the story to the
                        event.  We have to go back to the
                        train yard.

                                        STANTON
                          Dragons?  Comic books?  You guys
                        realize how this sounds?

                                        JOHNNY
                        You got a better idea, I'm all

          Off Stanton, far from convinced...



          Dark.  Spooky.  Looking very much as it did in Johnny's
          visions of the original shooting.

          Finding Johnny, Bruce and Stanton standing alongside a
          flatbed rail car.  Pages of Thaddeus's comics are spread
          out, weighted down with stones from the track bed.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's all right here.  All we had
                        to do was see it.

          Using a flashlight as a pointer, Johnny indicates a drawing
          that shows young Finn slipping out of a tree house.

                                        JOHNNY
                        His alter ego, Finn, slips out of
                        his evil stepmother's house.



          Johnny's flashlight now illuminating another drawing,
          which shows Finn flagging down a passing horse cart.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He uses public transportation.



          As it wheezes open.  The BUS DRIVER looks down at us.

                                        BUS DRIVER
                        In or out, child?  I ain't got
                        all night.

          (Note: while Johnny is describing what happened in the
          past, what we're seeing is the past repeating itself: 
          Thaddeus slipping away and making his way to the rail
          yard in the present.)



          Johnny indicates another drawing:  a view of a forbidding
          volcanic plain.  Dragons alighting from the sky.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He arrives at the crime scene.

                        Which brings us right here.

          His flashlight illuminates a final drawing:  A demon with
          a bloody sword standing over an unconscious man.

                                        BRUCE
                        A demon standing over an
                          unconscious guy, who looks a lot
                        like Thad's father.  Swap the
                        bloody sword for a smoking gun
                        and you've got a pretty accurate
                        picture of what he saw.

          Stanton has been looking on impatiently.

                                        STANTON
                        You really think these are going
                        to prove anything?

                                        JOHNNY
                        No.  But they could convince a
                        judge that Thaddeus was a witness,
                        that he saw something at odds
                        with the prosecution's version of
                        events.  And that could get Ryan
                          a reprieve.

                                        BRUCE
                        Hook Thaddeus up with a good child
                          psychologist, chances are he may
                        blow this thing wide open.

                        when I told you to.

          Johnny nods.  The picture more than clear now.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You set Ryan up.  Killed that
                        agent and planted his gun.

                                        STANTON
                        Ryan was getting too dangerous. 
                        Just like you two.

          Bruce takes a step to the side.  Stanton swings his gun.

                                        STANTON
                        I'm not alone.

          And indeed, in a couple of quick cutaways we see:


          KUJO'S TWO THUGS

          Taking up positions about fifty yards away, one armed
          with a handgun, the other with a shotgun.

                                        BRUCE
                        You're not going to kill us here,

                        You're right.  But I have other
                        places.  So many other places.

                        The kid can't talk.  And those
                        half-assed drawings are about to
                        disappear.  Problem solved.

                        Then why save his life, only to
                        let him be executed?

                                        STANTON
                        Ryan was "Old School."  He didn't
                        get it.

                        You were in Kujo's pocket the
                        whole time.

                                        STANTON
                        We play a sucker's game, while
                        guys like Kujo get rich.  I just
                        decided to take what I deserved.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You had me fooled.
                                (beat)
                        But you should never have handed
                        me your phone.  I told you: it
                        only takes one touch.

          And as he says this, we begin a quick series of flashbacks
          that fill in a vision we didn't see previously.



          Post-fire, we see Johnny take Stanton's phone.  WHOOSH! 



          Ringing in Stanton's hand.  Another distinctive ring tone,
          but again not the one.  We reveal he's walking briskly
          along a sidewalk as he answers.

                                        STANTON
                        I'm around the corner.  Order me
                          a Manhattan.

          And again we MATCH, MOVE, MORPH off the phone (and we may
          also do linked 360-degree spins around Stanton and the
          phones in this sequence, really have some fun with it) to -- 



          CLOSE on a pair of shoes as they walk beside a freight
          car, crunching gravel.  They stop.  Then a cell phone
          rings -- the killer's ring tone -- and CAMERA does a
            Tarantinoesque swoop under the freight car to find Younger
          Thaddeus hiding, staring at the coins... then swings back
          out, follows a hand as it brings a classic Motorola flip
          phone up to a man's face.  Stanton's face.

                                        STANTON
                        It's done. 

          The vision ends.



                                        JOHNNY
                        What do you think, Lieutenant? 
                        Hard enough?

          Stanton reacts as Dobbs steps out from between two freight
          cars, a gun held loosely at his side, a walkie-talkie in
          his other hand.

                                        DOBBS
                        It'll do.

          Stanton looks around wildly.


          BUT KUJO'S THUGS...

          have already been grabbed by pairs of SWAT officers.


          RESUME

                                        DOBBS
                        It's over, Detective.

          But a noise now causes Stanton to turn -- and see Thaddeus
          standing a few feet away, watching them.  Just like he
          did five years ago, Thaddeus has made his way here out of
          concern for someone he cares about.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Thaddeus!  No!

          But before the others can react, Stanton rushes over and
          grabs the boy, who screams and wriggles.  His gun to the
          boy's head, Stanton starts backing away.

                                        STANTON
                        Back off!  Everybody!  I'm gonna
                        walk out'a here now!

                                        DOBBS
                        And go where?

                                        STANTON
                        That's my problem. 
                                  (indicating Thad)
                        This is yours.

          Johnny's hand unconsciously touches the side of the
          flatcar.  WHOOSH! 


    105105CAMERA ZOOMS UP TO A DISTANT VANTAGE, RIGHT INTO THE
          SCOPE OF A SNIPER RIFLE, THE CROSSHAIRS ON THE BACK OF
            STANTON'S HEAD

                                        POLICE SNIPER'S VOICE
                                (to radio)
                          Nighthawk One.  I have a green
                        situation.  I repeat, the target
                        is green.

                                        SWAT COMMANDER'S VOICE
                        Take that green light, Nighthawk
                        One.

                                        POLICE SNIPER'S VOICE
                        Green light, out. 

          We hear a CRACK --          DEAD ZONE: "Heroes & Demons" - FOUR - 3/9/05 - GOLD 56.


  106106ZOOM BACK TO JOHNNY

          As we hear a sickening thud as the steel-jacketed round
          plows through Stanton's head, blood splattering toward
          Johnny before the bullet hits the flatbed near his hand
          with a SPARK.  The vision ends.


    107107RESUME

                                        JOHNNY
                        You won't make it, Detective. 
                        You're gonna die right here. 
                        I've already seen it.  Please. 
                        Let him go.

            Stanton's been around Johnny enough to believe him. 
          Finally, he lowers his gun and releases Thaddeus, who
            scrambles away, then huddles on the ground.

          As Dobbs quickly takes Stanton into custody, and Johnny
          and Bruce move to calm Thaddeus...





          Bruce's SUV speeds along in traffic.
