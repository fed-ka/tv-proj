INT. AMBULANCE - NIGHT

 EYES dart back and forth, as the O2 mask is placed SARA S
over her mouth. SIRENS BLARE; emergency lights flash. The 
Man by her side reaches over, wipes a spray of blood off 
her forehead. She looks in his eyes, then glances down at 
her hand. His fingers intertwine with hers. TWO WEDDING 
RINGS rub up against each other. As the rig screams away, 
A CARD RISES:  6EARLIER.  MONTHS  Under which, the sirens 
become SCREAMING and PLAYING...


EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY

CHILDREN scurry across the courtyard as we FIND SARA, 
intact, in the classic parental limbo - waiting for her 
kid after school. A TAP on her shoulder turns her...

KENDRA
Sara!

KENDRA (38, make-up and slit skirt over-preparing for the 
big 4-0) stands there. She is a lot. 

SARA

INT. HAYWARD APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Sara, who looks smashing in a cocktail dress, studies her 
baking. A crinkled look of perplexedness on her face, as 
JANEY (17, babysitter) looks on. Oliver watches TV.

JANEY
Should they be smoking like that? 

SARA
I can always scrape off the black part.

 Walking through, in a loose dress shirt, is Sara s
husband, DREW HAYWARD (35), on a cell phone.

DREW (TO PHONE)

knocked a year off the damn sentence... -- 
What did you just say to me?!

slick on one hand, brusk on the other. As Sara reaches to 
pull a new necktie from a box, she addresses Janey:

Sara moves to Drew, starts to put on his tie - A LUSH 
BURGUNDY SILK with gold and azure accents. Masculine but 
romantic. The action of knotting his tie is one of those 
familiar moments married couples take for granted. 

DREW (TO PHONE)

He whips off her tie and quickly throws a BORING BLUE 
STRIPED TIE around his neck. Oblivious to her feelings 
being hurt. She does the tie for him.

SARA
Still. After ten years. How does a 
marriage just blow up like that? 

As she finishes with the tie, he kisses her forehead. ZABEL - BETRAYAL - 1/17/13                               5.

EXT. CHICAGO RIVERWALK - NIGHT

Out on the water, a boat glides by. Sara steps out to the 
railing - in BG, a man speaks on his cell phone... Jack. ZABEL - BETRAYAL - 1/17/13                               7.


Finishing, he puts the phone away, and for a moment, they 
both stand there looking out, unaware of each other, the 
same expression on their faces... TWO ROMANTIC DREAMERS. 
A passing cargo boat BLOWS its SIGNAL WHISTLE, causing 
Sara and Jack to simultaneously turn - so that they find 
themselves FACE TO FACE. Suddenly. A beat...

JACK
Pretty chilly without a coat. 

SARA
I needed some air. Quite a crowd.

She smiles. Something intriguing about the way he teases. 


INT. LAKESHORE GALLERY - SAME

Drew pats backs with the Alderman and moves on, looking 
around for Sara. He steps up to a bar. 

DREW
Scotch and soda, twist.

He glances past the bar, out the window and sees: Sara 
outside, with a man - laughing. Drew thinks little of it, 
albeit being a bit curious. Someone he knows steps up. 

DREW (CONT D)
Kilner! Did you bring your checkbook?

 thrilled and discomfited - removes the coat. She s

SARA
Thank you. I should get back in. 

He reaches out for it - his hand accidentally brushes 
against hers. They linger there, touching, a millisecond 
longer than they should. A long look; he takes the coat. 

JACK
Good luck with the show. 

SARA
Good luck diving for wrecks. 

He watches her walk away, wondering what just happened - 
thrown in the way that a quick jolt of joy can throw you.

It takes her aback - his REPRESSED FRUSTRATION. Their

sharp-witted. Victor is rugged, edgy, works out too much.

He looks at Jack; the question was clearly not meant to 
be rhetorical. He looks away, a sad nostalgia. 

KARSTEN (CONT D)
When she was little, she never stopped 
talking, would tell me stories that went

T.J. puts down a coffee and creamer for his father.

INT. RUSH STREET BAR - NIGHT

A noisy singles place with hook-ups happening all around. 
Not a place for Sara at all, but here we find her, with 
Kendra and two other moms, LYNNE and CLAIRE (both 30s).

CLAIRE
 Oh my god, that new PE teacher - he s
like a huge muscle with great hair!

KENDRA
Who knew dodgeball was a spectator sport? 

Sara laughs and sips her Cosmo.

They all laugh. A crush of BUSINESSMEN and YOUNG WOMEN 
presses in. Sara feels a bit suffocated, takes a big sip. 

SARA (CONT D)
Stuffy in here. Be right back. 


 ROOM - SAMEINT. LADIES 

Sara leans down over the sink, as she rinses her face 
with her hands. When she leans up, Kendra is standing 
next to her, holding out a paper towel.

SARA (CONT D)
You never really told me... what happened 
in your marriage? Is that okay to ask? 

KENDRA
You know that spark you felt when you 
first met Drew - the one two people feel 
when they spot each other across a room - 
s out there looking  what everyone it s
for, hoping for. Even if only for a 
night. Well, when the spark is gone,

Some people, they learn to pretend they

enough to stumble across it again, years 
later. But in some marriages... well, 
 not patient. Maybe they maybe somebody s
find it somewhere else. ZABEL - BETRAYAL - 1/17/13                               22.


It surprises Sara, as she absorbs the lesson of the 
sparkless marriage - not so different from her own, 
though no one might be able to see it. Yet. 

SARA
Jeffrey..? Had an affair?

KENDRA
Yes. And even though I want to kill him 
sixteen times a day, the truth is, he 
probably did us both a favor. We were 
never going to be happy again. And once

The sentiment lands heavy on Sara, even as she tries to 
ignore any relevance it has to her.

he finds her. Seeing him from her window, she moves back 
along the car, until she arrives at the inter-car gangway

at him, as he tries to keep up with the train.

It's an enigmatic moment, and the relief in Jack's 
expression does not hide a hint of guilt - which is lost 
on T.J. as he waxes nostalgic.

she looks the other way, for hers. Raises the camera and 
PANS across the tracks until... she is stopped by a 
 Jack. Instinctively, she CLICKS figure leaning in - it s
the shutter. He calls across the divide - sweet, funny.

They remain there, frozen in a look. She is paralyzed 
into stillness, indecision freezing her. Down the tracks, 
her TRAIN RUMBLES IN. She looks at it, thinking, I can be 
home in two hours. With my husband, my son. On his side, 
he wonders: will she be there when the train goes? 

The train SCREECHES to a stop - its doors SLIDE OPEN. She 
stares into the car - a dilemma, a crisis at her very 
s  know - she core. Why does it feel this way? She doesn t
not sure she cares. The train PULLS AWAY, grinding...


A LONG SHOT - FROM ACROSS THE TRACKS 

The train pulls out - where is she? Still there? Gone? 
Only once the final car has clicked by do we see... SARA, 
still on the platform. She looks across to JACK - holding 
each other in a locked gaze for a long moment, like 
 nothing - and no one - else in the world. Almost there s
like they could stand there forever.

up a room key. She says it plainly, with no judgment. 

SARA
It seems easy for you.

EXT. CHICAGO/INT. EL TRAIN - NIGHT

Against the city lights, Jack rocks with the sway of the 
train, reeling a bit - a strange mix of exhilaration and 
dread playing out on his face. On one hand, what an 
amazing experience. On the other... oh shit, what now? He

INT. HAYWARD APARTMENT - STUDY - NIGHT

Drew is busy at the computer as Sara walks in. 

SARA
Hey...

DREW
Hey. Where were you? 

SARA
At my studio.

DREW
There was no answer. 

SARA
I must have left the ringer off. 

She notices a box identical to the one in which the 
burgundy tie was - only now it holds a BORING BLUE TIE. 

DREW
Oh yeah, I exchanged it. Went back and 
found something even better. Nice, right? 

SARA

INT. HAYWARD KITCHEN - NIGHT 

Sara heads to the kitchen. In BG, Oliver plays with 
trucks. Singing a sweet little song. Sara grabs the 
bottle of Bordeaux. Gets a corkscrew, but her hand is 
trembling, and the bottle slips - SMASH! - it shatters. 
Oliver plays on, benignly unaware. Sara leans against the 
cabinet, slumps to the floor. Sitting there, she watches 
the red wine spread across the linoleum, like blood.
