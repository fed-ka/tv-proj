An OVERHEAD ANGLE of long fingers on piano keys-
SINGER
A woman in her late 50's, early 60's, BERTHA MAE SPIVEY,
leans into a MICROPHONE from where she sits on a stool on a
little makeshift stage, a glass of whiskey in hand, and SINGS-
BERTHA MAE
I know a gal name of Betty Sue
Shook it so much
She got the German flu
No matter how she done it
No matter how she done it
No matter how she done it
She done it just the same
As she sings we PAN and TRACK, moving through the large, near-
empty COUNTRY ROADHOUSE-
BERTHA MAE
You women don't worry
About your life
She made Jack the Ripper
Throw away his knife-
Only a few die-hard REGULARS are scattered at the tables and
bar stools. A pretty young woman in her late teens, CHINA
DOLL, is behind the bar, head held in her hands, listening
aimlessly.
BERTHA MAE
No matter how she done it
No matter how she done it
No matter how she done it
She done it just the same
Lonnie and Scratch step in, cautiously looking around, hoping
that nobody will notice and tell them to leave.
4.
They plant themselves next to the piano, Lonnie intently
watching the long fingers work the keys- we TILT to see
TYRONE `Pinetop' Purvis, proprietor and piano player, in his
50's. He acts as if the boys aren't there, concentrating on
the music. We SHIFT to include Bertha Mae as she wraps up
the song-
BERTHA MAE
A copper brought her in
She didn't need no bail
She shook it for the judge
He threw the cop in jail
No matter how she done it
No matter how she done it
No matter how she done it
She done it just the same
SLICK, a pretty, sharply-dressed man in his late 40's at the
bar, and MACEO, who sits at a table near the bandstand
smiling throughout, APPLAUD. The sound makes the room seem
more empty.
Ty stands, nods to METALMOUTH SIMS, a slight, worried-looking
harmonica player who sits behind Bertha Mae-
TY
You take it for a while.
As Ty crosses to the bar we hear RECORDED MUSIC booming from
outside-
BERTHA MAE
They makin all that racket again at
Toussaint's.
TY
Yeah. And all them people over
there buying drinks and throwing
their money after them dice and
whatnot. Lucky we got none a that
here.
Metalmouth launches into a HARMONICA INTRO. Ty pauses at the
counter next to Slick, who is attentively watching Bertha Mae-
BERTHA MAE
You can drink your liquor
You can drink your cold can beer-
SLICK
She sounding good, huh?
TY
Sounds fine.
Always has.
5.
BERTHA MAE
You can drink your good whiskey
You can drink your cold can beer-
SLICK
Not much of a crowd.
TY
Not a crowd at all. Just some
stiffs who want to drink theirself
to sleep without the music wakin em
up.
SLICK
You ought to advertise. Got an
attraction like Bertha Mae-
BERTHA MAE
You can lay up with your sweet gal
But Poppa don't you leave me here
TY
Singin is one thing, Slick.
Whether people want to look at you
while you do it is another.
SLICK
(defensive) You saying something
about-
Maceo arrives to join them, interrupting-
MACEO
Got quite a number over to
Toussaint's place tonight.
TY
Sounds like it.
MACEO
Lots of young folks. Come to
listen to that box of his.
China Doll brings Ty a glass of whiskey.
He gives her a sad
smile-
TY
Thanks, China Doll.
We FOLLOW as Ty crosses to the door-
6.
MACEO (O.S.)
Don't see why we don't just turn
our box on and let folks feed it
nickels like they do.
SLICK (O.S.)
The lady is singing.
MACEO (O.S.)
But didn't nobody come to listen to
her, Slick.
Ty looks out the door at-
10
DARKNESS.
MACEO
Damn.
TY
China Doll?
A MATCH is struck, FLARES as China Doll lights a KEROSENE
LAMP she's pulled from under the bar-
CHINA DOLL
Got to get the power company in
here-
TY
No you don't. They turned my juice
off last month- don't want them
sniffin around that splice job
Maceo done.
MACEO
Must be a short circuit in the juke
here-
He yanks the plug out of the wall as Ty steps up to reassure
the few patrons-
TY
Don't worry folks, bar's still
open.
NADINE
It's nice like this.
Kind of
romantic.
MACEO
Imonna have to go out back, wiggle
some things around.
NADINE
Don't be wigglin nothin round less
I'm there to see it.
Maceo rolls his eyes as he passes Ty on the way out with a
FLASHLIGHT. He freezes in his tracks as the FLASHLIGHT BEAM
hits a FIGURE standing in the doorway-
It is SHERIFF HIRAM PUGH, large and in charge.
Pugh strolls
into the club as if he owns it.
14.
SHERIFF PUGH
Evenin, folks.
TY
Evenin, Sheriff.
Sheriff Pugh looks around the near-empty club-
SHERIFF PUGH
Your lights gone out.
TY
Looks like it.
SHERIFF PUGH
Don't know but that be a vilation
of somethin or other.
Ty has played this game before, trying to hold his ground
without pissing off the white man with the badge-
TY
We just about to close up here.
Pugh sniffs the air-
SHERIFF PUGH
Your wife been cookin?
TY
Not tonight.
Went to the revival
tent.
SHERIFF PUGH
(grins) I stood by there a while.
Them nigras was singin up a storm.
Ty doesn't respond. Sheriff Pugh stops right next to
Stokely, giving him a dead-pan stare as he speaks. Stokely
won't meet his eyes-
SHERIFF PUGH
I just come out here to look in on
Toussaint- had that shooting two
nights ago.
TY
Lot's of fighting in there.
SHERIFF PUGH
There is that. But me and Old
Toussaint got us a greement.
(MORE)
15.
SHERIFF PUGH(cont'd)
You get these field hands suckin
down that whiskey, hop em all up
with music, there's gonna be some
razors drawn. He only call me if
it's a fatality.
MACEO
Never been a killin in here.
Them
youngbloods know better-
SHERIFF PUGH
-than to mess with Tyrone Purvis.
He turns his attention to Tyrone-
SHERIFF PUGH
You got quite the reputation round
here, Tyrone. Say you put some
poor black boy in the grave.
It gets very quiet, the HISS of the KEROSENE LANTERN growing
tense and insistent.
China Doll looks from Sheriff Pugh to Ty's face, searching
for a flicker of evidence. Ty stays deadpan-
TY
Just people talkin.
The Sheriff steps to put his face very close to Ty's, an edge
of menace in his voice when he speaks softly-
SHERIFF PUGH
You remember that this is my
county, Tyrone. What goes on goes
on cause I let it. Don't want to
get too big for your britches out
here.
Ty holds Pugh's eyes for an agonizingly long moment, then the
sheriff turns and heads for the door-
SHERIFF PUGH
You folks have a pleasant evening,
now.
They all wait for him to clear the door before they exhale.
STOKELY
A nigger aint shit in this world.
Maceo snatches the whiskey bottle from Stokely-
16.
MACEO
Speakin for yourself.
STOKELY
You didn't have this club, Tyrone,
what you think you be?
We TIGHTEN on Ty's face.
He has been thinking about this
very thing-
STOKELY (O.S.)
Wouldn't be nothin. And if that
aint true then grits aint
groceries.
A long TRAIN WHISTLE echoes outside-
11
13
A few wet, crumpled BILLS and dirty COINS are spread out on
the bartop-
MACEO (O.S.)
It's just a weekday night-
WIDER
Still operating by LANTERN LIGHT, Ty and Maceo look at the
night's dismal take, as China Doll lays chairs on top of
tables-
TY
I owe the chicken man, I owe the
ice man, I owe the liquor man-
MACEO
Least you don't owe the electric
company.
19.
TY
(indicates the dark room)
Yeah,
that's a big relief.
MACEO
(worried)
You thinkin bout closing
down?
Ty frowns, reaches under the counter and brings up a POSTER.
He spreads it out on the counter top. It reads-
SPECIAL ATTRACTION
New Orleans Singing Sensation
`GUITAR' SAM
TY
What you think?
MACEO
Biggest act in New Orleans, got him
a hit on the radio-
TY
He's playing here Saturday night.
Figured I'd wait till Bertha Mae
was gone to put this up.
Ty turns to look for the right spot to fix the poster-
MACEO
Here?
You mean like in this room
here?
TY
You know the Tomcat Club in
Texarkana?
MACEO
Big Jim Jamison's place-
TY
Just went out of business.
MACEO
Damn-
TY
And since Sam is giggin his way
over to Tulsa, that means he got
the date open-
20.
MACEO
But you aint never had a guitar pl-
Ty gives Maceo a warning look, which China Doll notes-
TY
I'm having one now.
MACEO
What you gonna pay the man with?
Ty glances at China Doll, uneasy-
TY
You just worry about gettin these
hung up everywhere in the county
tomorrow. Payday come Saturday, he
gonna draw alla them cotton pickers
and soldiers boys in here, get us
back in the black.
Ty looks around at the empty club-
TY
They gonna take me down, it won't
be without a fight.
Maceo holds the poster up to the lamplight, warming to the
idea-
MACEO
Guitar Sam at the Honeydripper.
Man, this joint is going to jump!
14
18
They step into the club. Plates of bacon, eggs and biscuits
sit on one of the tables-
CHINA DOLL
(teasing) Come in here every night
makin them cow-eyes at you-
Ty and Maceo sit-
MACEO
She seems like the kind could
smother a man-
CHINA DOLL
She makes all her own clothes.
TY
(smiles) Darlin, that's not the
kind of thing a man cares about
from a woman.
The LIGHTS that went out last night suddenly FLICKER ON-
MACEO
Hey, I fixed it!
TY
You didn't do no such thing. It
just decided to come back on.
MACEO
Decided.
TY
Just like it decided to switch off
last night. You not even in the
conversation.
CHINA DOLL
Miss Nadine makes some good money
too, sewing for people.
MACEO
That woman scares me. Last ole boy
that give her a tumble, Nappy
Carpenter?
(MORE)
28.
MACEO(cont'd)
She cook for him, fixed him up all
kinds of nice new clothes, kept him
in gin and poker chips-
CHINA DOLL
Don't see no problem with that.
MACEO
Well, come four, five months, a man
starts to- sorry, China Doll, but
this just the way it is- a man gots
needs.
TY
Nadine look like she can take care
of those, too-
MACEO
You eat chicken every morning, noon
and night for five months, you get
a taste for some different kind of
meat, right? (looks to China Doll)
Maybe I shouldn't be-
CHINA DOLL
Aint gonna tell me something I
haven't heard worse.
MACEO
Well, Nappy goes out and has him a-
a porkchop or two, let's say- and
he comes back from Toussaint's one
night feeling no pain, smelling
like- like porkchops- the way a
man will- and he falls out on
Nadine's couch and commences to
snore. Wake up the next mornin,
finds she had took all his clothes
off without him knowin it-
TY
Man was dog drunk-
MACEO
Miss Nadine come in with a skillet
in her hand, hot grits bubbling in
it, says "Baby, I got your
breakfast." "Not this morning,
Nadine," he says, sittin up, "don't
think I could eat a thing." "Well
then," she says, "we can't let this
go to waste, can we?" and she dump
that whole hot bubblin mess right
in the man's lap.
29.
TY
(wincing)
Owwww!
MACEO
Then she got busy with that hot
iron on his head. Screams didn't
bring the neighbors in, she would
of killed that man.
They are all quiet for a moment, contemplating-
TY
You got to admit it, though- woman
is an artist with that Singer
machine.
SONNY (O.S.)
Scuse me?
They turn to see Sonny standing in the doorway-
SONNY
Which one of you is Mr. Pinetop?
Ty's eyes fix on Sonny's face for a moment- something
familiar there- then go down to the guitar case at his feet-
TY
We aint hirin.
SONNY
I can play anything-
Ty indicates the Guitar Sam POSTER hanging behind the bar-
TY
Already got me a professional.
Sonny looks a little shaky-
SONNY
Guitar Sam really coming all the
way out here?
TY
That so surprising?
SONNY
No, no-- uhm, Mr. Shack Thomas
said that if I was to-
TY
You know Shack?
30.
SONNY
We uh- we travelled together-
Ty gives him a once-over-
TY
When's the last time you ate solid
food, young man?
Sonny has to think-
TY
(to China Doll) Take him back and
fix him somethin, China Doll.
Standin there all hungry-eyed, puts
me off my breakfast.
SONNY
That's real kind of you-
Sonny pulls his hat off as he follows China Doll, who is
suddenly quiet and self-conscious, back to the kitchen-
MACEO
Must of come in on the northbound
last night.
TY
Look like he got cooties, too.
Straw in them boxcars is full of
em.
MACEO
Never cared to travel that way.
Ty grows somber, reminiscing-
TY
I was out there ridin them rails
between the wars. Seem like half
the country headin west rolled past
the other half comin back east.
(musing) Every one of us scrapin
for the next meal-
COOL BREEZE (O.S.)
This is the place.
They turn to see COOL BREEZE, a hard-looking, sharply-dressed
character, leading the prosperous looking MR. SIMMONS into
the club as if they aren't there-
31.
COOL BREEZE
Yall can tear things down, put
things up- got a lot of potential.
MR. SIMMONS
Looks bigger in here than it does
from the outside.
TY
I help you gentlemen?
COOL BREEZE
Just showing the man gonna run this
place what he's got.
Ty stands-
TY
This is my place.
A frozen moment.
Then Maceo stands as well, backing up his
friend.
Cool Breeze puts one foot up on the chair next to Ty, licks a
finger and dabs at his shoeshine with it-
COOL BREEZE
You the piano player, right?
TY
Name's Tyrone- call me Pinetop
Purvis.
COOL BREEZE
Pinetop Purvis who owes two hundred
dollars to Lucky Hardaway up in
Little Rock-
TY
He's gonna get his-
COOL BREEZE
Pinetop who missed last month's
rent-
TY
After this weekend-
COOL BREEZE
After this weekend you gonna be the
same raggedy-ass piano player can't
pay his debts off and Mr. Simmons
here gonna be the new proprietor.
32.
TY
Lucky give me two weeks-
COOL BREEZE
Lucky got a better offer.
He nods toward Mr. Simmons-
TY
He can't do that.
Cool Breeze takes his foot down and gets up in Ty's face. He
lets his jacket fall open so the butt of his .44 PISTOL is
visible-
COOL BREEZE
You don't think so?
MACEO
(trying to defuse) What if we got
our payment for him Monday?
Cool Breeze doesn't take his eyes off Ty's-
COOL BREEZE
Saturday night.
MACEO
We can do that-
COOL BREEZE
Not just a taste- the whole two
hundred.
TY
And I throw in a twenny-five cent
tip for his messenger boy.
COOL BREEZE
I'll be here.
TY
In the meantime, we not open yet.
Which means yall are trespassin.
Cool Breeze grins, still locking eyeballs with Ty-
COOL BREEZE
You seen enough, Mr. Simmons?
MR. SIMMONS
I believe I have.
33.
Cool Breeze breaks eye contact, strolls out, followed by
Simmons-
COOL BREEZE
Yeah, somebody could make something
out of this place. Wouldn't take
much work at all.
Ty and Maceo wait till the men are gone before they speak-
TY
We cleared over two hundred that
one weekend-
MACEO
Couple years back-
TY
And we didn't have no Louisiana
guitar wizard playin neither.
MACEO
Yeah, they say he draws em like
flies.
TY
That's what they say.
An awkward pause.
Both men are shaken.
Ty sits back down to
think-
MACEO
They say first thing he does is go
to the man that owns the joint,
sticks out his hand and wants that
cash money put in it.
TY
I already sent fifty to his
manager.
MACEO
How much you payin him all out?
TY
Another hundred.
MACEO
We'd have to clear three hundred-
TY
I figure we charge folks two
dollars to get in, then drinks-
34.
MACEO
(shakes his head) What I'm sayin
is, less he sees the green up front
the man won't get off the train.
A TRUCK HORN honks outside-
MACEO
What's that now?
Ty, mind working, looks desperate as Maceo exits to see who's
honking-
19
20
A little kitchen built onto the back of the bar. Sonny sits
wolfing down eggs and toast as China Doll watches him from
the stove-
SONNY
Arkansas.
How bout you?
CHINA DOLL
We come here just after Mama met my
step-daddy.
SONNY
Not much happenin, little town like
this.
CHINA DOLL
(shrugs) They started up the
training base again-
SONNY
That right?
CHINA DOLL
You been in the Army?
SONNY
Uh-huh.
CHINA DOLL
You shoot people?
SONNY
Fixed radios.
CHINA DOLL
They say this new war gonna be a
short one.
SONNY
Might be, might not.
I was to
Japan.
38.
CHINA DOLL
Yeah? What's the people like
there?
SONNY
Small.
CHINA DOLL
Yeah?
SONNY
(holds a hand up) Bout that high.
And they speak Japanese.
CHINA DOLL
You been to California?
SONNY
(nods)
Los Angeles.
CHINA DOLL
Where they make the movies.
SONNY
You go to the movies?
CHINA DOLL
I been once.
He sits back and looks her over-
SONNY
Fine-looking girl like you, ought
to been all kinds of places.
CHINA DOLL
I'm going to em. First I'm going
to beauty school when Mama saves up
the money and then I have a
portable skill-
SONNY
Like playin music.
CHINA DOLL
My step-Daddy says that aint a
skill-
TY (O.S.)
-it's an affliction.
Ty sticks his head in, Maceo behind him with a case of liquor
in his arms-
39.
TY
Come on, China Doll. Got some
bidness in town you gonna help me
with.
Ty gives Sonny a distrustful look-
TY
And you, young man, want to point
yourself west down that highway.
Bout three miles you see a mess of
people working in the fields- it's
harvest time. If you can stoop and
pull, they got a job for you.
He steps out the back door-
TY
And wash up them dishes before you
go.
21
21
Delilah is washing breakfast dishes, SINGING a gospel song as
she works-
DELILAH
I see four and twenty elders
Down on their knees
I see four and twenty elders
Down on their knees
Well they all turn together
Standing to greet the rising sun
I see four and twenty elders
Down on their knees
AMANDA WINSHIP, the mayor's pretty, high-strung wife, enters
and hovers uneasily-
AMANDA
Your biscuits were wonderful this
morning, Delilah.
DELILAH
Thank you.
AMANDA
Of course, they always are.
I
don't know how you do it.
DELILAH
Just cook em.
40.
AMANDA
When I married Floyd I swear I
couldn't even boil water. Might be
why he insisted I needed help
around the house. He used to come
to the dinner table with a sense of
dread.
DELILAH
Anybody can learn to cook. Just
have to put your mind to it.
AMANDA
Maybe you could show me some of
your secrets some time.
DELILAH
No secrets to it. Imonna fix some
ham with yams and greens today, you
want to learn how.
Amanda thinks about it, smiling all the while, sighs-
AMANDA
Maybe some other day.
Delilah isn't surprised by the response-
DELILAH
You just say the word, Miss Amanda,
I have you cookin in no time.
Amanda nods, uncomfortable but not leaving.
She can't
exactly offer to help with the dishes-
AMANDA
I just don't know what I'd do
without you.
22
24
LUTHER, the head clerk, arranges boxes on the back wall and
shoots a nervous look up front-
LUTHER
I'd have to ask Mr. Skinner.
TY
Of course you would. While you at
it, remind him how one of the
reasons colored folks come in here
is to get the lowdown on what's
happening in--
Luther brightens as China Doll steps in-
LUTHER
China Doll!
Luther is clearly smitten-
CHINA DOLL
You gonna let us put these posters
up, aint you Luther?
LUTHER
Oh-- I don't think that be any
problem at all.
CHINA DOLL
(beaming a smile) That's awful
nice of you, Luther.
LUTHER
You lookin special today.
CHINA DOLL
That's sweet of you to say.
45.
TY
Maceo, go on with the man and he
show you where you can put em up.
Come on, darlin, we got more stops
to make-
China Doll spreads a parting bit of sunshine-
CHINA DOLL
Nice to see you, Luther.
Luther smiles and waves as Maceo hooks his arm and pulls him
back into the store-
25
28
-Slick, sitting at the bottom of the STAIRS that lead to the
second floor, looking lost and bewildered-
SLICK
She's gone.
TY
Oh.
Ty frowns.
He was all geared up for the siege-
TY
When she gonna be back?
SLICK
She's just gone.
Woke up beside
her and--
He can't go on, tears forming in his eyes.
China Doll and Ty
trade a look-
29
29
We start on the RECORD PLAYER, needle down on the spinning
song, then RACK to see Bertha Mae, laying DEAD in her bed.
TY
Aw, damn.
We RACK again as Ty and China Doll step in. Slick appears in
the doorway behind them. He's been drinking-
SLICK
Fourteen years.
TY
China Doll, you go find your Mama.
She know how to fix up the body.
SLICK
People make jokes and all, but I
been with that woman fourteen
years. That's a good part of my
life.
TY
And stop by Beauchamp's and tell em
they got a customer.
49.
SLICK
She gimme the only home I ever had.
He looks at them, devastated-
SLICK
What I'm gonna do now?
30
33
Delilah sits at the dining room table with a sandwich she's
made herself. We hear PERRY COMO on a RECORD somewhere in
the house. She hasn't gotten two bites down before Amanda
wanders in, crossing to the liquor cabinet-
AMANDA
Oh dear, I believe it's about that
time-
She pulls out a DECANTER OF WINE-
AMANDA
Would you care to join me?
DELILAH
No thank you.
Amanda pours herself a glass of wine-
AMANDA
Of course you won't join me, you
don't partake. That was
thoughtless of me.
52.
DELILAH
That's all right.
AMANDA
So you don't take spirits and- what
else? In your church?
DELILAH
I'm sort of between churches right
now. I been thinking about
changing over to the Holiness, but
I- I haven't been sanctified yet.
AMANDA
Ah-
DELILAH
There's been a minister in this
week-
AMANDA
The tent out by the fairgrounds.
Delilah nods.
Amanda takes a drink-
AMANDA
The church I grew up in- we were
Pentacostals- they wouldn't have
anything but the human voice inside
the church. And dancing- any kind
of dancing, music, card playing--
well, it was very strict. They
took up serpents.
DELILAH
I've heard of that.
AMANDA
I tell Floyd these stories and he's
horrified. They've always been
Methodists, Floyd's family.
DELILAH
They're good people too.
AMANDA
When I married Floyd-- oh, it was
quite a scandal among my relatives.
As if I'd taken up with somebody in
a cult.
53.
DELILAH
It can be a trial, married folks
differ in their religion.
AMANDA
And your husband is a--- ?
DELILAH
Unaffiliated.
AMANDA
Unaffiliated. I see.
He has his--
social club-
DELILAH
The Honeydripper.
AMANDA
Such a colorful name.
DELILAH
Yes.
AMANDA
He must devote a great deal of his
energy to it.
DELILAH
It's just him and Maceo Green runs
it, and then I go over and cook
some when I get off here.
AMANDA
That's very- supportive of you.
Considering the sort of-
environment-
DELILAH
(defensive) I been in those
barrooms most of my life, Miss
Amanda.
Amanda realizes she has probed too deep, tries to back up-
AMANDA
I see-
DELILAH
I was a singer. I met Tyrone in
the Paradise, down in Shreveport,
China Doll was only two-
Delilah considers, struggling to express who Ty is-
54.
DELILAH
I was just kind of livin along, you
know, drinking more than I ought--
then Tyrone. It was like a light
come into my life.
Delilah turns away, embarrassed to have revealed so much-
DELILAH
People think things because he owns
the Lounge, but they don't know
him.
AMANDA
Small minds are never in short
supply.
She crosses to look out a window-
AMANDA
The people in this town---
She catches herself, smiles-
AMANDA
I suppose they expected that Floyd,
being from a prominent family- as
prominent as is possible here in
Harmony- would have chosen somebody
more--
She fades away again, empties her glass-
AMANDA
My people were very devout, but
they weren't- financially
successful.
DELILAH
No shame in that.
AMANDA
In school, if you didn't have shoes-
She frowns at the memory, sighs-
AMANDA
Oh, I forgot--
Amanda is up and out of the room.
Delilah frowns at the
decanter, hurries to put it away.
Amanda comes back in holding a DRESS for a young girl-
55.
AMANDA
I was going through Emily's old
things the other day, and I thought
this would look just darling on
your China Doll-
Delilah examines the dress, which is clearly for a little
girl-
DELILAH
Oh- I don't think it would near fit
her, Miss Amanda.
AMANDA
(disappointed) How old is she now?
DELILAH
Seventeen.
AMANDA
(shocked) Oh my- I must have lost
track somewhere along the line.
Seventeen.
She sits, still holding the dress, sneaks a look over to
where the wine decanter was-
DELILAH
It was a very nice thought.
An awkward silence that Perry Como fills inadequately. A
KNOCK at the back door, then China Doll steps in, not seeing
Amanda right away-
CHINA DOLL
Mama?
They need you at-
Delilah shifts her eyes to indicate-
CHINA DOLL
Oh, I'm sorry, Miss Amanda.
I
didn't know you was home.
AMANDA
(smiles) China Doll! We were just
recalling-
you used to play right
here under this table.
56.

Ty sits staring, mind working overtime, staring at the dead
woman on the bed. He barely hears Slick talking to the
undertaker behind him, busy filling out forms-
SLICK
There isn't any cash money I know
of. She sold a good deal of the
furniture, but there's still a nice-
lookin sofa in the parlor. Only
thing she cared for anymore was
singin out to Pinetop's place-
Ty looks at a large RING on Bertha's Mae's cold gray hand.
He touches it with a finger-
SLICK
You welcome to look around the
house- if there's anything your
Missus might like-- long as it's
not something personal to me and
Bertha Mae-
Ty draws his finger away from the ring as if burnt-
SLICK
It's just- she got to go out in
style, is what it is. The best you
got, all the trimmins- lay it out
for her. That's the way she lived
it- that's the way she ought to
leave it.
Ty closes his eyes and buries his head in his hands-
35
38
Ty and China Doll sit as Delilah lays dinner on the table.
She is dressed to go out-
DELILAH
I expect there'll be a nice turnout
for Bertha Mae tomorrow.
TY
Folks who wouldn't have nothin to
do with her when she was alive.
DELILAH
Some of them, maybe. You still got
to pay your respects.
TY
Slick gonna have to find him a new
ride.
DELILAH
That's a terrible thing to say-
TY
That's how the man gets over, is
all, sugarin up to some woman got a
job or a bankroll-
DELILAH
It's no way to live.
TY
Just how it is out in the world,
baby- man got to walk through the
gates of Hell to get a piece of
cheese.
He stares moodily, unnoticing as she lays his plate in front
of him-
TY
You're not so young any more, lose
hold of what little you got-
He just shakes his head-
62.
DELILAH
If you lose the club I'm sure
you'll find something else.
TY
In this town?
Like what?
Delilah proceeds cautiously-
DELILAH
You know anytime you want I could
get Miss Amanda to ask her husb-
TY
"Watch yo feet, Mr. Mayor, I done
just mopped the flo! "
Delilah tries to ignore this-
DELILAH
You work so hard at the Lounge, and
what it brings in-
TY
Isn't even as much as what you make
polishin that white lady's silver.
I know.
DELILAH
I didn't say that.
TY
You didn't have to.
Delilah gives up, knowing he's set on his mood-
DELILAH
It'll just have to work out, then.
A strained silence.
Delilah crosses to the back door-
DELILAH
Meetin gonna start without I'm
there.
TY
Your soul not the one needs savin,
baby.
She gives Ty a lost look, steps out.
The screen door slams.
China Doll sees how worried Ty is-
63.
CHINA DOLL
It's all gonna be fine, Daddy.
Everbody in town talkin bout Guitar
Sam comin to Harmony.
39
40
We TRACK past CELLS full of black PRISONERS-
KING (O.S.)
Tulsa aint so bad but for the smell-
NED (O.S.)
Got them stockyards near the jail-
KING (O.S.)
That's right- and the flies.
Course, I had me in a cell in
Georgia once, six other men, didn't
have no window atall.
NED (O.S.)
Must of got caught on one a them
freights.
66.
Sonny is in a big COMMON CELL with the other conscripted
LABOR GANG. He hangs on the bars as behind him men pitch
pennies, while Ned and another veteran jailbird, KING,
compare lodging experiences-
KING
Yeah, aint no free ride allowed
through Georgia. And the food
there-
NED
Paltry-
KING
Paltry aint the word for it.
Breakfast was a joke, lunch was a
rumor-
NED
-and dinner was a anecdote.
KING
(laughs) Spose you been locked in
that box.
NED
Or one just like it.
Sonny begins to SING softly, almost to himself-
SONNY
Well you wake up in the morning
Hear the bing-bong ring-
Walk up to the table
And see the same damn thing
All Imonna tell you
Knife, a fork and a pan
If you say a thing about it
You're in trouble with the Man
The men join him on the chorus-
ALL
Let the Midnight Special
Shine its light on me
Oh let the Midnight Special
Shine its ever-lovin light on me-
Sonny turns to face them-
NED
You a singer, young man?
67.
SONNY
Singer, guitar player- Imonna be on
the radio some day. People gonna
know my name.
NED
(chuckles) Keep thinkin that way,
young man. Judge Gatlin don't
choose to work you into your grave,
you just might do it.
Sonny ponders this, looking back out through the bars,
singing more moodily now as we TRACK AWAY from the cell-
SONNY
If you ever go to Houston
Don't you stagger don't you fight
Cause the Sheriff will arrest you
You're in the cooler for the night-
FADE TO BLACK.
41
41
We hear the slow BLUES DIRGE Bertha May as we see China Doll
applying polish to Bertha Mae's fingernails-
42
42
MUSIC CONTINUES. We TRACK BACK through the house, looking at
PHOTOGRAPHS and POSTERS of her singing in her glory days,
finally TRACKING out onto the PORCH where Slick sits glumly
on the steps and the undertaker stands in his black suit,
looking at his watch as MOURNERS begin to pass into the house-
43
43
MUSIC CONTINUES.
MOURNERS pass the OPEN COFFIN-
44
47
47
We're in a
BAR ROOM- smoke, heat, packed bodies- Possum's
SONG grows
more intense as we TRACK IN on GUITAR MAN- young,
with slick
hair a moustache and tons of attitude. He sneers,
flicks his
cigarette almost straight at us.
We TRACK IN on YOUNG TYRONE, also swearing, stepping away
from his piano-
Guitar Man hands his guitar to one of the eager MEN standing
close, hoping for a fight-
A PRETTY GIRL stands to one side, looking scared and excited,
covering her mouth with her hands-
Young Tyrone steps in to meet him, the CROWD around almost
pushing them together-
Guitar Man pulls out a KNIFE! Young Tyrone grabs for it and
they grapple, face to face, struggling in a terrible dance-
A TRAIN WHISTLE breaks the spell!
51
A torn and crumpled Guitar Sam POSTER lays on the bar
counter.
FINGERS move on the keyboard.
Ty sits drinking, brooding, PLAYING and SINGING softly at the
piano. Maceo is at the bar-
TY
Well I had my fun if I
Don't get well no more
Well I had my fun if I
Don't get well no more
My head is spinnin
And I'm goin down slow-
MACEO
Man don't take care of hisself- out
drinkin and jazzin the women every
night-
73.
TY
Don't make any difference now.
MACEO
Got so bad, I heard there was some
ole boy goes around pretendin to be
Guitar Sam, fill out the gigs he
misses. Does pretty well for
hisself, what I hear-
Ty pauses on the keyboard-
TY
Somebody we could find?
MACEO
(shrugs) Hell, I don't know.
Just
a story I heard.
They both go back to brooding.
Ty takes a drink.
He stares
at the keyboard-
TY
There must have been a first one.
MACEO
First what?
TY
Back slavery days, they had the
ones that worked in the big house.
Might not of had shoes always, but
their pants didn't have no holes
and they didn't pick no cotton.
MACEO
House niggers.
TY
That's how they called em. They
must of had all their African kinda
instruments- drums, shakers, some
kind of banjo thing- but the piano-
MACEO
Didn't bring no piano over on them
ships from Africa.
74.
TY
The piano was just sittin there in
the white folks' big room, all
polished up-- and I figure this
one boy, he goes past fifteen,
twenty times a day, running the
corner of his eye over it. And
he's there when they play, the
masters, doin all their minuets and
whatever-
Ty PLAYS something like a MINUET-
TY
-him standing there with a tray of
white people food pretendin not to
have a thought in his head, might
be only some dust hangin in the air
for all they know- but he's
watchin the fingers, see, watchin
them keys work. This old boy, the
first one, he can play alla them
Africa kinda instruments, he can
play mud if you give him the key
and the tempo, he's got music in
his head, in his heart, in every
damn piece of him there's music.
MACEO
Down to the bones--
TY
And one day the masters is away,
huntin foxes or some rich white
people thing they get up to, and
he's alone in the room with that
piano and he comes over and sits
down on the bench-
MACEO
Watch out now-
TY
-and he spreads his fingers out the
way he seen the minuet player do-
and he-
Ty hits a MINOR CHORD, lets it decay-
TY
And he thinks- `Lord help me, I
could do some damage with this.'
75.
A silence.
Maceo is moved by the scene-
MACEO
Would have liked to been there. I
mean to hear the cat play, not none
of the rest of it.
Ty gets up and crosses the room with his drink in his hand,
distraught. This is the end for Ty, no strategies left,
nothing but the bitter taste of total defeat-
TY
Mace, Imonna lose my club.
MACEO
Old Man Toussaint finds out you
stole his liquor, you like to lose
more than that-
TY
I got no more cards to play-
MACEO
Maybe if you was to go down, see
Lucky Hardaway in person-
TY
(angry) I aint kissin up to no
cokey-nose, conk-headed-
WHAP! He kicks Sonny's guitar case, left sticking out under
a table, and sends it spinning across the floor till it
CRASHES into the bar and flips open. Ty and Maceo stare at
the contents-
TY
What the hell that sposed to be?
Maceo pulls out a home-built SOLID BODY GUITAR, a painted
white rectangle with a complicated PICKUP jury-rigged over
the strings and yards of ELECTRICAL CORD hanging off it-
MACEO
Some kind of guitar.
TY
A guitar has got a hole in it,
that's where the sound comes from.
That boy must be bout three bricks
shy of a load upstairs.
China Doll rushes in, upset-
76.
CHINA DOLL
They gone and arrest him!
TY
Arrested who?
CHINA DOLL
Sonny. The high Sheriff arrested
him and sold him over to Judge
Gatlin.
TY
Who's Sonny?
CHINA DOLL
Sonny that was here yesterday
morning.
TY
Sonny that got a screw loose is why
they arrested him. Maceo, make a
noise on that-
Maceo plucks a string.
Not much of a sound-
MACEO
It's electric-
TY
I plug a chunk of stove wood into
the wall I get more music out of it
than that mess gonna make.
MACEO
Naw, man, it don't work unless it's
hooked up to the juice, see? You
got the juice, you don't need the
hollow inside the box, the music
just runs straight from the strings
through this wire and comes out-
He dumps the sack Sonny brought out and outs falls a mass of
tubes and wires, also home-modified-
MACEO
-your amplifier. Which is what
this thing must be.
CHINA DOLL
Sonny said he fix radios in the
Army.
77.
TY
Sonny didn't do nothin but feed
bedbugs in anybody's Army, and some
of em crawled in his head.
Surprised if that boy got the wit
to pick cotton. Judge Gatlin
bought himself a droolin idiot.
What you want to amplify a damn
guitar for anyway?
CHINA DOLL
Daddy-
TY
Less you gonna sit over on your
chair and play them little Charley
Christian kind of riffs-
MACEO
A sideman-
TY
Sit over there and be all clean and
polite. Guitar hasn't been up
front since them old piss and moan
blues shouters, sit their blind
asses on the corner hollerin for
pennies-
MACEO
Old time music-
CHINA DOLL
Daddy, Sonny didn't do nothin to be
arrested for! He was just lookin
for work.
MACEO
They hung colored boys for less
than that, darlin. Least on the
work gang they feed em, keep their
strength up.
CHINA DOLL
But he doesn't belong there!
Maceo turns the guitar over in his hands-
MACEO
You know, Guitar Sam plays him an
electric, but I don't think it's
this no-hole kind of deal.
78.
TY
I hope he plugs it in the wrong
socket some night, lectrocutes his
sorry no-show ass!
Ty has a thought.
He looks over at the guitar in Maceo's
hands-
TY
(thinking out loud) Now if he did
show up here-- and our power was to
go out again while he was playing-
MACEO (O.S.)
I think I fixed it good this time,
Ty.
Ty smiles-
TY
So he come out and plugs his ax in-
MACEO
He come out lookin good, from what
I hear. All kind of spangly pants
and jacket, got his name spelled
out on the back-
TY
Clothes, right-
MACEO
Hair all slick and shiny, flash
some gold teeth at them gals, got
his sax man behind him, maybe a
piano, harmonica, drums-
TY
You remember that night the lights
went out in the Esquire Club in
Mobile?
MACEO
(smiles) And somebody took off
with the gate? Stole the whole
damn register off the counter-
TY
They didn't hold it against Reggie
Porter, did they?
79.
MACEO
Naw- it was his place that got
robbed.
TY
Didn't hold it against him, didn't
expect no money back for the show-
MACEO
They all too busy diving on the pot
of that tonk game got interrupted-
TY
And nobody suspected it might be
Reggie Porter hisself that pulled
them lights, did they?
Maceo begins to see where Ty is leading-
MACEO
Aw, no, Ty, we can't-
Ty claps his hands together, jumps up and heads for the door-
TY
China Doll, you mind the place
while we're gone! (to Maceo) Come
on, man, we got work to do.
CHINA DOLL
Where you going, Daddy?
TY
I promise the people Guitar Sam,
they gonna get Guitar Sam!
52
52
We start on a portrait of Governor Big Jim Folsom on the
wall, then TILT DOWN to Sheriff Pugh, feet up on the desk, a
table-top FAN pointed at him, looking up at Ty-
SHERIFF PUGH
Why you interested in this boy?
TY
Got a job for him.
SHERIFF PUGH
Must be doin pretty good for
yourself out there, Tyrone, you
hirin new people on.
80.
TY
Passing well, yeah-
SHERIFF PUGH
But this boy-
TY
Name is Sonny-
SHERIFF PUGH
He's payin off his debt to society
right now, and if I was to pull him
out of the field it would cost the
county-
TY
Judge Gatlin payin three a day for
prison labor.
SHERIFF PUGH
You gonna pay me four for the
duration of his sentence?
TY
Which might be- ?
SHERIFF PUGH
-as long as I care to make it.
TY
Well, I was counting on more of a
one-time deal- if I could just rent
him out for the weekend-
SHERIFF PUGH
Fifty dollars.
Ty looks stricken-
SHERIFF PUGH
It's not just the money. There's
legalistic principles involved
here. Public safety issues-
TY
I pay you Sunday morning?
SHERIFF PUGH
You pay me now or you forget about
it.
TY
I don't have it now.
81.
SHERIFF PUGH
You think you too smart for the
rest of us, don't you, Tyrone?
Think you can go it by yourself.
He puts his feet down and sits forward, drilling Ty with his
eyes-
SHERIFF PUGH
You'd rather eat roofin nails than
come to me for a favor-
TY
It's not a favor if I got to pay-
SHERIFF PUGH
Oh, you gonna pay all right. You
don't hand me that money Sunday
mornin, you got yourself a new
partner. Same deal as I got with
Toussaint. How'd that be?
Ty considers.
He doesn't have any options-
TY
(deadpan)
You'll get the fifty.
SHERIFF PUGH
(smiles)
And that wife of yours-
TY
(wary)
Delilah-
SHERIFF PUGH
Them fried chicken sandwiches- if
I was to come by, now and then,
check up on my interests-
TY
She be happy to fix you whatever
you want.
SHERIFF PUGH
My wife's cookin would gag a
maggot.
TY
Different people got different
kinds of talents.
Sheriff Pugh heaves himself to his feet-
82.
SHERIFF PUGH
Lurleen aint discovered what hers
is yet. Let's go fetch that boy.
53
54
MUSIC plays on the RADIO as Nadine masterfully works her
SEWING MACHINE and Maceo stands by uneasily. He holds up the
denim jacket Sonny left at the club-
MACEO
This size, right, but it's got to
shine.
NADINE
And when you need this?
MACEO
Tonight.
NADINE
(considers) That's a tall order.
MACEO
It's got to happen.
NADINE
(fishing) You know, I do my best
work, my fastest work, when I'm
happy.
MACEO
Yeah, I spose you do-
Nadine looks up at him from the sewing machine-
NADINE
You gone make me happy, baby?
Maceo nervously makes for the door-
MACEO
Uhm- you come by the club tonight,
we havin a special show. Tell em
at the door you my guest-
NADINE
Food aint the only thing a woman
needs three times a day.
MACEO
(mutters) Wouldn't hurt you to
skip a few meals.
84.
NADINE
What's that, baby?
Maceo turns at the open door-
MACEO
Boy's gonna need time to try that
jacket on- see how it feels.
Later, Nadine-
He is gone-
55
55
Ty and China Doll stand looking at Sonny as he sits on a bar
stool-
TY
You got to do somethin with this
boy's head, darlin. They might not
know what the real Sam look like,
but it aint this.
CHINA DOLL
I can try.
China Doll looks through the beauty products she's piled up
nearby-
SONNY
And what exactly I'm supposed to
do?
TY
You gone stand up there with that
contraption you got an play Guitar
Sam numbers.
SONNY
Hell, I do that with my eyes
closed.
TY
We could get the audience to close
theirs we be better off.
MACEO (O.S.)
Ty-
Maceo pops his head in the front door-
85.
MACEO
I tracked Mr. Trenier down-
TY
Let's hit it.
Ty leaves to join Maceo-
CHINA DOLL
Bye, Daddy.
China Doll is a little nervous to be left alone with Sonny.
She puts her comb in her hand and walks around Sonny,
examining his hair while he examines her face-
SONNY
You know what you're doing?
CHINA DOLL
I fix Mama's hair all the time.
SONNY
But you aint been to that school
yet.
CHINA DOLL
You go to school to learn your
guitar?
SONNY
(laughs)
No.
China Doll steps behind the bar-
CHINA DOLL
I might pick up some new things at
beauty school but mostly it's for
my certificate, and that is `a
ticket to adventure'- that's what
it says in the brochure. People
lookin for beauty all over the
world.
Sonny sees the LOOSE WIRES that come through the wall behind
the bar. China Doll searches around-
SONNY
You want to watch out for them
wires sticking down- don't look
safe.
86.
CHINA DOLL
(shrugs) Yeah- power's always
going out, people getting shocks
and whatnot-
SONNY
Somebody ought to fix it.
She searches under the counter for something-
CHINA DOLL
`A career in beauty is like money
in the bank.' Says that in the
brochure too. Plus it isn't
physically taxin.
SONNY
Yeah, I can't see no pretty thing
like you behind a plow.
CHINA DOLL
I had the rheumatic fever when I
was little, left me with a weak
heart.
SONNY
Oh. Mine been actin funny too-
since I laid eyes on you.
She acknowledges his flirting with a little smile and comes
up with a MASON JAR full of clear LIQUID-
SONNY
What's that?
CHINA DOLL
Just some ole moonshine they keep
around.
China Doll crosses back to Sonny-
SONNY
(concerned) What you gonna do with
it?
CHINA DOLL
They always joke about how this
stuff'll straighten your hair right
out-
She twists the lid off, sniffs the liquid, reacts to its
strength-
87.
CHINA DOLL
Imonna just make yours relax a
little.
56
56
TIME TRENIER, an older musician with a permanently stoic
expression, sits watching his pupil, a YOUNG BOY, torture the
SCALES with a CORNET. He glances up at Ty and Maceo, trying
not to plug their ears as the boy continues to PLAY-
MACEO
Mr. Time Trenier- that's a name to
be reckoned with.
Time doesn't seem to react to the flattery-
MACEO
Story goes that you used to play
with Buddy Bolden.
TIME
Played with most all of em down
there.
MACEO
And King Oliver-
TIME
One band falls apart you find
yourself another one. Never any
shortage of bands, down New Awlins.
TY
I didn't know you was givin
lessons.
TIME
Pays the rent.
Almost.
TY
You interested in a playin job?
TIME
Your place?
MACEO
(tentative) It's uhm- backin up a
man on the electric guitar?
88.
TIME
(shrugs)
If you can pay, I can
play.
TY
Got to dress sharp.
No need to say this to Time Trenier.
You could cut yourself
on the creases on his pants-
MACEO
It aint like a all-night thing- you
just start out and there's gonna
be a accident-
Ty shoots Maceo a look-
TIME
Accident.
TY
Sudden loss of power.
Lights out.
TIME
(shrugs again)
It's your gig, man.
TY
Eight o'clock. This aint colored
people time and it sure aint New
Awlins time. I mean eight o'clock
on the money.
TIME
If you got the green I'm on the
scene.
TY
That's a deal then.
MACEO
You know any drummers?
TIME
(nods)
I'll bring you one.
TY
Nothin fancy, he just got to keep
time-
TIME
Time is my name.
Ty and Maceo wince as the kid hits a particularly SOUR NOTE-
89.
57
58
Ty is repairing the little STAGE with hammer and nails-
SONNY (O.S.)
Mr. Purvis?
TY
(doesn't look up) People call me
Ty or they call me Pinetop. Mr.
Pinetop to you.
SONNY (O.S.)
I just wanted to tell you- I
preciate the opportunity.
Ty looks up to see Sonny with his hair pressed under a tight
cap made from an old STOCKING-
TY
Right.
SONNY
I know ever one of Guitar Sam's
songs- know the chords, know the
words-
TY
That's fine.
Sonny begins to stroll around the edge of the club, looking
at PHOTOS and SHOWBILLS on the walls-
SONNY
China Doll said how you was famous
once.
Ty is pleased at his step-daughter's bragging, but doesn't
show it-
TY
I was known, but I was never what
you call famous.
SONNY
How'd you get your start?
Ty sighs, sits back from his work-
92.
TY
Down in Mobile there was an old
cathouse professor name of Joe
Dudlow, had had a stroke on one
side, curled him all up- but he
kept on pluggin. I used to come
out and play his left hand for him.
SONNY
How old you were?
TY
(shrugs) Thirteen, fourteen. This
one night it was goin hot and heavy
and Joe just passed, right there at
the piano, in the middle of Black
Bottom Stomp. They propped him up
at the bar, stuck a drink in his
hand, and told me to keep poundin
them ivories. (shakes his head)
There was a meanness hanging over
them juke joints, there was murder
in the air. You stopped playin for
a minute, it come down like a flock
of crows.
Sonny stops by a poster for the `REGINALD ERSKINE BAND
featuring Tyrone "Pinetop" Purvis'-
SONNY
This is you-
TY
Big band days, on the road. If a
railroad train run through it, we
played it.
SONNY
(reading) `Reginald Erskine'.
Don't believe I ever heard of him-
TY
Big tall light-skin fella out of
Carolina, said he's part Cherokee.
Couldn't play nothin, but he waved
his little stick and had this long
greasy hair he throw around like
Cab Calloway.
SONNY
And you were the piano man.
93.
TY
Piano man, arranger, you name it.
SONNY
That must of been somethin, see the
country first class.
TY
I don't know about first class, but
we seen the country.
SONNY
How come you stopped?
TY
(shrugs) Got tired of carrying
another man's water. Didn't want
to die in no colored hotel some
night in Who-Knows-Where Arkansas.
He bangs the last nail in-
TY
Met Delilah and wanted something of
my own.
SONNY
Well you don't have nothing to
worry about, Mr. Pinetop. I won't
let you down tonight.
Ty looks at Sonny, considers telling him what the plan is-
TY
No-
I don't spose you will.
Ty gets up and goes into the back.
Sonny crosses to the tangle of wires coming out of the wall
behind the counter and snaking off in every direction. He
grabs hold of one, thinking-
59
59
Delilah is in her kitchen, HUMMING a GOSPEL SONG to herself,
apron on as she begins to make a pie. She pulls a METAL
FLOUR CANNISTER down from the shelf, flips the lid off- about
half full.
She starts to scoop flour out from it and something falls out-
a small CLOTH PURSE. She picks it up to put it aside, then
frowns at the way it feels. She shakes flour off, unzips it-
94.
Nothing inside.
60
60
Maceo loads bottles of beer into the ICEBOX, wincing as the
sounds of a SCREAMING ARGUMENT blast in from the bar-
DELILAH (O.S.)
How could you do that?
TY (O.S.)
Imonna put that back and double-
DELILAH (O.S.)
You don't go gamblin with my baby's
money!
TY (O.S.)
I had to send off the advance pay
or the man don't come and play-
DELILAH (O.S.)
I don't care what you took it for,
I saved that money up for China
Doll-
Delilah bursts through the swinging door into the back room,
pursued by Ty, trying to explain-
DELILAH
-and you got no business puttin
your fingers on it!
TY
China Doll don't need any school,
baby, she could walk into one of
them shops right this minute and
get a job!
DELILAH
There's got to be some line you
won't cross, some thing you won't
do-
TY
The world starts throwin me breaks,
woman, maybe I'll catch religion
and walk the straight and narrow
like them Bible thumpers you sit up
with, but till that day, I-
95.
DELILAH
Reverend Cutlip is right about you!
WHAM! Delilah slams the back door as she storms out. Ty
turns and CRACK! kicks an empty crate halfway across the
floor before stomping out to the bar. Maceo opens a beer
with the church-key hanging from the icebox handle, takes a
gulp and sits to ponder this new development-
61
61
We hear the revival meeting CHOIR SINGING an upbeat number as
Opal, dressed for Saturday night, checks herself out in a
spotted, cracked MIRROR and works on her make-up-
CHOIR (V.O.)
You got to choose
Got to choose tween the fire and
the Light
62
63
MUSIC CONTINUES. A trio of BLACK PRIVATES share a mirror,
spiffing up their uniforms to go out on leave-
CHOIR (V.O.)
No earthly love
Is gonna make it right!
You got to choose-
96.
64
64
MUSIC CONTINUES. Dex, dressed to go out, pulls a SHOEBOX out
from under the cot he sits on. He lifts the lid to reveal an
old .38 PISTOL-
CHOIR (V.O.)
Got
to choose tween the world and
the
Lord
You
got to choose
Got
to choose tween the world and
the
Lord
65
68
Maybe fifty people are in the club already, mostly LOCALS and
HARVEST HANDS, with more arriving all the time-
Ty stands watching the crowd, tense, not at all confident
that any of his scheme is going to work-
A group of twenty of the black SOLDIERS from the base step in-
Maceo comes over and lays a hand on his shoulder-
MACEO
Natives gettin restless.
TY
How we doing?
MACEO
We gonna be full up.
But the food-
Delilah comin in?
Ty's expression gives him the answer-
TY
What if I lost her?
MACEO
She won't let you down, Ty-
TY
This aint gonna work, is it?
MACEO
We just got to play it out and see-
98.
DEX
(calling)
Guitar Sam!
They look out at the growing crowd.
Ty is grim-
TY
See if you can push another round
of drinks while I stall em.
MACEO
Then you gonna bring him out?
Dex is joined by several OTHERS in the club, calling out-
DEX AND OTHERS
Sam! We come to hear the guitar
man play! Guitar Sam!
TY
You be on those wires. Give him
three bars and then you pull it.
MACEO
I got a baseball bat under the
counter, but you out here all alone-
TY
Just get the liquor movin, Mace,
and keep that money where you can
run with it.

China Doll fusses with Sonny's hair after he hangs his
guitar, dangling with electrical hookups, over his head-
CHINA DOLL
You look good.
Ty steps back in with them, wiping sweat from his forehead
with a handkerchief. He looks Sonny over- his hair slick
and shiny, the outfit Nadine sewed up for him tight and
sparkling-
TY
(impressed) Damn-
100.
CHINA DOLL
He looks good, doesn't he Daddy?
TY
Honey, I want you to get right by
that front door and take over
collectin the cover charge. And if
anything should happen- like go
wrong or something- you just step
out and walk away from the club,
hear?
CHINA DOLL
What's gonna go wrong?
TY
Oh- our Guitar Sam here gets them
soldier boys jumping it could get a
little rough- just be on your toes,
that's all.
CHINA DOLL
Okay.
She starts away-
TY
China Doll-
CHINA DOLL
Yeah?
TY
You know there aint a thing in this
world I wouldn't do for you. Even
if I mess up sometimes, you know
that, right?
China Doll looks at him, not sure what brought this on, but
pleased to hear it. The CALLS for Guitar Sam grow LOUDER
from the floor-
CHINA DOLL
I know that, Daddy.
TY
You go on, now.
China Doll exits and Ty looks back to Sonny-
TY
Well, you look like something might
of come outa New Orleans-
101.
SONNY
I forget to tell you- I fixed your
hook-up.
TY
My what?
SONNY
Where the electricity comes in?
It
was all-
MACEO (O.S.)
Ty!
They turn to see Maceo stepping in, concerned-
MACEO
We got a situation out there-
TY
You don't think I know that?
MACEO
Got the law in the house.
71
71
Sheriff Pugh stands near the piano, putting a considerable
damper on the mood in the room. Ty hurries out to him, with
a panic-stricken smile on his face-
TY
Didn't think we'd be seeing you so
soon!
SHERIFF PUGH
(looking around) Got a nice crowd
in here tonight, Tyrone. See them
army uniforms-
TY
Yeah, well we got ourselves this
special attraction, see, and-
SHERIFF PUGH
Chicken.
TY
Huh?
102.
SHERIFF PUGH
Them ribs outside smell real good,
but I got my heart set on some of
your Delilah's fried chicken.
TY
Right-
SHERIFF PUGH
She made it last Saturday at the
mayor's but ole Clayford Gentry was
up from Eufala and he got the
drumsticks.
Sheriff Pugh is distracted for a moment as Opal and the girls
from the store step in, dressed to the nines, drinking up the
eyeball action from the pickers and soldiers-
SHERIFF PUGH
I'm partial to dark meat.
TY
See, the thing is-
SHERIFF PUGH
She is back there cookin, aint she?
Our agreement was-
TY
The situation we got, Sheriff, what
with this special guest come up
from Louisiana- what it means is-
uhm-
Ty has nothing, the crowd is starting to CHANT for Guitar Sam
again. He wipes his forehead-
TY
Maybe if you were to come back in-
DELILAH
Regular or spicy?
Delilah is there, smiling at Pugh, pulling her coat off-
DELILAH
They both take the same time to fix
up, I just got to know which.
Ty and Delilah exchange a long look-
103.
SHERIFF PUGH
Have to make mine regular. I like
the spicy fine but it always come
back to nip me later.
She shoots a look to Ty-
DELILAH
It's important not to bite off more
than you can chew. (to Pugh) Yall
just make yourself at home.
She kisses Ty on the cheek and heads for the kitchen-
DELILAH
Good luck tonight, baby.
SHERIFF PUGH
Slap some maynaise on it!
Ty smiles, his nerves all gone now-
TY
(pointing) Might want to wait over
there, Sheriff. Don't want to
scare off the customers-
A CHEER from the crowd.
Sonny has wandered uncertainly out
onto the stage!
TY
Oh Lord-
Ty runs up to his microphone, shoots a look to the bar-
Maceo is pouring a scotch with one hand, the other wrapped
around the wires coming out of the wall. He nods to Ty-
Sonny starts to hook his guitar up with a thick COIL OF WIRE,
then into the dented AMP sitting on a wooden chair beside him
and pointed out at the crowd. Metalmouth Sims looks on
uncomfortably. Ty puts on his biggest grin, easing behind
the keyboard-
TY
So here's what you all been waitin
for, people, the noted performer
and recordin star-
104.
ENTRANCE - TIME AND YOUNG HENRY
Time Trenier strolls in with his sax still in its case, hat
on his head, exuding his no-sweat attitude. Beside him is
YOUNG HENRY, a kid who can't be more than 14, wearing a
fedora-
TY (O.S.)
-direct from New Orleans, Louisiana-
STAGE
TY
-Guitar Sam!!!!
A TERRIBLE SQUAWK emits from the amp as Sonny makes the
connection-
Sheriff Pugh cover his ears-
The girls from the store cover their ears, making pained
faces-
Sonny pulls his guitar away from the amp and the SQUAWK
settles to a FUZZY BUZZ. Sonny frowns at the amp-
SONNY
Sorry, folks- must of got kicked on
the train.
The audience is stone-faced.
Could this really be the man?
Young Henry steps up and sits behind the DRUM KIT, pulling
sticks from inside his shirt-
Ty closes his eyes, begins to shake his head in defeat-
China Doll looks worried, collecting another cover charge at
the door-
Delilah steps out from the kitchen and looks to the stage,
worried-
Sonny holds his arms out wide, shifting his body to get the
BUZZ under control-
Dex leans to talk in Junebug's ear-
DEX
What's this fool playin at?
105.
Maceo isn't going to wait to find out. He grabs the wires
with both hands, yanks- they hold firm! He looks to the
stage, panicked-
-as Sonny brings his fingers to the strings and the amp
BLASTS the room with a long, trip-hammering, spine-shivering,
ELECTRIC GUITAR INTRO!
Ty stands at the piano with his mouth hanging open-
Sonny WHOOPS and leans into his microphone-
SONNY
Gonna hold may baby as tight as I
can
Tonight she'll know I'm a mighty
man!
Have you heard the news?
There's good rockin tonight!
Sonny looks over to Ty, who catches himself and begins to
play along. Young Henry is impassive as he plays a fast
shuffle on the skins-
Ty looks over to Maceo, half-climbing the wall as he tries to
pull the wires out. Maceo sees Ty, who waves him off-
SONNY
Have you heard the news?
There's good rockin tonight!
Delilah smiles and presses her hands together, shooting a
look upward-
DELILAH
Thank you, Jesus.
Time Trenier has his case open now, the gleaming instrument
in one hand, squinting at the mouthpiece as he holds it up to
the light with the other-
SONNY
Meet me at midnight behind the barn
Don't you worry I'll do you no harm
The crowd is already CLAPPING and STOMPING in time with the
song. Henry starts to hit the two and the four beat hard to
keep time-
SONNY
Make sure to bring my rockin shoes
Tonight I'm gonna rock away all of
my blues!
106.
Time Trenier screws the mouthpiece on, puts his horn to his
lips and BLOWS right on the beat to take the sax break,
walking through the parting crowd to the bandstand!
Junebug grabs Opal's hand and they begin to DANCE a modified
jitterbug, people spreading to give them room-
Sheriff Pugh, hands still over his ears, sits in a corner
paying special attention to Opal's hip action-
As Time continues to blow, stepping up onto the stage, Sonny
keeps urging Metalmouth Sims to come closer to his microphone
with the harmonica. Sims is hesitant but Sonny keeps waving-
closer, closer-
Metalmouth shoots a nervous look to Ty, who nods from the
piano, so he butts his harp smack against the microphone,
takes a deep breath and HONKS his soul out, grabbing the
break from Time!
The audience goes wild, a half-dozen couples dancing now,
others clapping and finger-popping and jumping to the beat
where they stand. Sonny shakes out the long CORD attached to
his guitar-
China Doll is trying to keep collecting from the new
CUSTOMERS pressing in the door and dance at the same time,
thrilled by the music. Lonnie and Scratch sneak in behind
her as she turns toward the bandstand-
Metalmouth wraps up his break and Sonny takes over with the
guitar again, making it WAIL as he hops off the stage, steps
up on a chair, then onto the bar counter!
He walks the length of the bar, playing his ass off, hops
down at the far end, grins at China Doll and heads out
through the door, dragging extension cord behind! Lonnie and
Scratch hurry to pull slack for him as he steps out into the
NIGHT-
72
73
Time and Metalmouth SING into the same microphone as Sonny
plays his way back up to the stage-
TIME AND METALMOUTH
Have you heard the news?
There's good rockin tonight-
Have you heard the news?
There's good rockin tonight-
We FOLLOW as Maceo hustles back and forth, trying to keep up
with orders for ribs, bring cold beers out from the icebox,
etc. He suddenly stops in his tracks-
Nadine stands before him, looking fatally sexy in a SATIN
DRESS she no doubt made herself.
MACEO
Oh my soul.
NADINE
Don't tire yourself out, Poppa.
You an me got bidness together.
MACEO
I believe we do.
He hurries past with his arms full of beer, pivoting to check
her out from another angle-
Dex sees across the room, frowns-
Ham is talking to Lucille at the bar, leaning in close to be
heard over the music-
108.
SONNY
I heard the news-
There's good rockin tonight!
Sonny finishes with a squawking chord and the joint goes wild-
CHEERING, WHISTLING, STOMPING!
SONNY
Alla you men grab hold of a woman!
You can't find a woman, just grab
hold of yourselves- we gonna play
this one slow and tight.
Sonny goes into the intro for Louis Jordan's Blue Light
Boogie. Time lays down a steady rock beat with his sax and
Ty joins in at the piano-
SONNY
They
did
the boogie real
slow
With
the
blue lights way
down low
They
did
the boogie real
slow
With
the
blue lights way
down low
Ty joins him-
SONNY AND TY
They did the boogie real slow
With the blue lights way down low
Ty takes the verse-
TY
I went to a party
With a bobby sox
I started swingin
All she would do was rock
As they join in the chorus, Ty sees-
Cool Breeze, strolling in, checking out the action with a
proprietary air.
Ty looks to Maceo, getting back behind the bar.
Maceo sees
as well, tightening up-
Cool Breeze nods to Ty.
A slow, sexy SAX BREAK comes up and Ty leaves the piano to
cross to the bar. When he gets there Maceo is already
counting out a huge pile of BILLS-
109.
MACEO
Hundred forty-two, forty-three,
forty-four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine- hundred fifty. And
they's another fifty in here-
Maceo thunks a heavy CLOTH SACK full of change onto the
countertop-
MACEO
Lucky Hardaway don't mind some
change, does he?
Cool Breeze doesn't even glance at the money, hard-eying Ty
instead-
COOL BREEZE
What if Mr. Hardaway was to say let
the chumps keep their change, he
wants the club back one way or the
other?
Maceo looks to Ty, who remains impassive, mind working-
COOL BREEZE
How'd that be?
TY
Well- he'd have to take it up with
my bidness partner.
Ty shifts and we RACK FOCUS to see across the room to Sheriff
Pugh, receiving his sack of chicken and white bread from
Delilah. Ty smiles and waves-
Cool Breeze reconsiders his terms-
COOL BREEZE
That sheriff your partner?
TY
(sighs) Yeah, and he's twice as
mean as he is ugly.
Cool Breeze grins, scoops up the bills on the counter-
COOL BREEZE
You must want this club awful bad,
brother.
Cool Breeze hefts the sack of change, shoots a look to the
stage and leans over to speak into Ty's ear-
110.
COOL BREEZE
You maybe know this already, but
that aint no Guitar Sam.
He steps away just as the song ends to APPLAUSE, Ty taking a
deep sigh of relief. Sonny steps up to the microphone to
introduce the next song-
TOUSSAINT (O.S.)
You is a lie!
A shocked silence.
The audience makes way for Old Man Toussaint to come
tottering up to the foot of the stage. He points a bony
finger at Sonny-
TOUSSAINT
You is a lie, boy! I known Sammy
since he's drinkin mama's milk,
hell, I known his Mama herself when
she live up to Plaquemine- and you
aint him!
The audience looks to Sonny for his defense-
Ty holds his breath.
Maceo brings the baseball bat up from
behind the bar.
Sonny just smiles-
SONNY
That's Creole Guitar Sam you talkin
bout, Pops. I'm Delta Guitar Sam.
Toussaint ponders this a moment, then huffs-
TOUSSAINT
As long as we straight on that.
JUNEBUG
Get on outa there and let the man
play!
A CHORUS of CRIES to the same effect, and Sonny crosses back
to his microphone-
SONNY
Imonna play you one I come up with
today while I was havin my hair cut-
He starts into a bouncy INTRO that Metalmouth joins in with,
then starts to SING as the crowd starts to dance and clap-
111.
SONNY
Oh China Doll
Can't get you offa my mind!
Oh China Doll
I can't get you offa my mind!
If you be my baby
Gonna leave all them others behind!
The front row is all girls goggling at Sonny, instant
groupies- but we RACK to China Doll, transfixed, as she is
drawn toward the stage-
SONNY
Oh China Doll
Think about you day and night!
Oh China Doll
I think about you day and night!
Can't forget you baby
Oh when you gonna treat me right?
Time Trenier steps in for a growling SAX BREAK-
TY
Ty looks around the crowded, rocking room-
POV - SHERIFF PUGH
The Sheriff makes his way through the crowd and out the door.
The last person he passes turns toward Ty-
Possum?
But then DANCERS cross in front and he is gone.
TY
Ty frowns, troubled. Under the sax now we hear a dissonant
SLIDE GUITAR, the haunting notes Possum was playing at the
train station. Ty searches the crowd-
POV
The SLIDE GUITAR continues underneath as we PAN across the
crowd dancing-
There's Possum again, at the bar, face turned toward Ty.
112.
TY
We TIGHTEN on TY.
Why is he here?
POV - POSSUM
Possum turns his head slowly, fixes on something, and we PAN
to see Dex and Ham standing toe-to-toe, snarling into each
other's face.
We PUNCH IN tighter and tighter on the young men, body
language telling us a fight is about to break out-
ECU TY
Ty desperately pushes his way across the crowded floor to
reach them and the FLASHBACKS come again, the SAX MUSIC
growing echoey and menacing-
74
74
The shaky perspective and over-saturated colors again, tight
on the men struggling, the Girl cowering, then Young Tyrone
twisting the Guitar Man's wrist and thrusting, again and
again, hugging close to him, then pulled away and the-
-KNIFE falls to the floor, BLOODY, and the-
-Guitar Man falls to his hands and knees, his stomach a
bloody mess, crawling on all fours and HOWLING and Young
Tyrone watching in horror as he is held back by many arms and
the Girl SCREAMING-
75
75
-which becomes Time BLOWING HIS SAX into the microphone-
-and Dex reaches for his pistol-
-and Ham reaches for his knife, but-
-a huge, strong hand clamps down on Dex's wrist-
-and another huge hand grabs Ham's wrist!
Ty is there, clamping onto them with a grip of iron.
113.
A lighter, bouncier ELECTRIC GUITAR RIFF has replaced the sax
now. Ty looks deep into the eyes of the two surprised
pickers-
TY
Yall in my house, here, gentlemen.
Don't have no fightin, don't have
no killin, don't have none of that
dismal nonsense in my house.
Understand? What's your name son?
Dex is shaken by the strength of the grip on his arm-
DEX
Dex- Dexter Moncrief.
TY
And you?
HAM
Hamilton Drinkwater.
TY
Well, gentlemen, this is the night
there won't be no pitiful song
written bout you two killin each
other. Don't nothin rhyme with
`Moncrief' anyhow.
Maceo is there now, holding a cardboard BOX in one hand and
the BASEBALL BAT in the other-
MACEO
Got a problem here?
TY
These young men seem to brought
something in for our collection.
MACEO
(to Dex)
Yours first.
Ty gently takes the pistol from Dex, regards it grimly before
laying it in the box. He turns his attention to Ham-
TY
Now yours.
He takes the knife from Ham, tosses it in the box-
TY
Yall still need to mess with each
other, you go outside and do it.
114.
Ty lets go of their wrists-
TY
This world is full of people got no
use for us, like to see us in the
grave. We don't need to give em
any help.
The two give each other a final dirty look and move away into
opposite corners-
STAGE
Sonny keeps playing-
SONNY
Oh China Doll
Got to let you into my heart!
Oh China Doll
Got to let you into my heart!
I surrender darlin
I loved you from the very start!
Ty rushes to the piano, joins in jamming with the other
players-
76
