-EARLY APRIL, 1841-
We are close on a PAIR OF BLACK HANDS as they open A
FINELY WRAPPED PACKET OF VIOLIN STRINGS.
WE CUT TO the hands stringing a VIOLIN. It's not a high
end piece, but it is quite nice.
WE CUT TO a wide shot of the study. Sitting in a chair
with violin in hand is SOLOMON NORTHUP; a man in his late
twenties. Everything about Solomon, his mien and manner,
is distinguished. But he, too, seems a hardy individual.
Someone who has known manual labor in his time.
Solomon begins to lightly play his violin, as if testing
the strings, their tuning. Satisfied, Solomon begins to
play vigorously. As he does, we make a HARD CUT TO:
We come in on a lively affair. A dinner party is being
thrown within the confines of a fairly stately house. In
attendance are EIGHT COUPLES. All are WHITE and all are
FAIRLY YOUNG, in their early twenties. The men and women
are dressed in very fine attire. We should get the sense
that for the most part they are people of means.
The furniture has been set aside in the living room. At
the moment the couples are engaged in the dancing of a
REEL.
The music they are dancing to is being played by Solomon,
having cut directly from the tune he was previously
playing. He plays with a light determination, and in no
way seems possessed with empty servitude.
Solomon concludes the reel, and the dancers break into
enthusiastic applause, which is followed by personal
thanks and congratulations from all. It should be clear
that despite their respective races there is much
admiration and appreciation for Solomon's abilities.
It is a Saturday morning. Clad in her finest attire is
ANNE; Solomon's wife, a few years younger than he. We
see also the Northup children: MARGARET who is eight, and
ALONZO who is five. They are handsome, and well groomed
kids. Anne straightens up the children. She finishes,

she rises up and stands behind them, almost as if
preparing to pose for a portrait.
They all wait a moment, then Solomon enters the foyer.
He stands and looks admiringly at his family. ADMIRINGLY
stressed. It isn't that he doesn't have love for them,
he does as well. But in the moment, he truly admires his
greatest accomplishment: a family that is healthy and
well and provided for. He goes to his children, and
hands each a coin, then goes to Anne. Gives her a kiss
on the cheek. The children giggle at the sight.
We are inside the store of MR. CEPHAS PARKER; a white man
and a supplier of general goods. Solomon greets him
WITH:
SOLOMON
Mr. Parker.
PARKER
Mr. Northup. Mrs. Northup.
With money in hand the Northup children move quickly
about the store looking for items to purchase.
CONTINUED:
Anne looks over some silks and fabrics. Parker suggests
TO SOLOMON:
PARKER (CONT'D)
A new cravat, Solomon? Pure silk
by way of the French.
SOLOMON
We are in need of a fresh carry
all for the Mrs's travels.
PARKER
A year's passed? Off to Sandy
Hill?
ANNE
I am.
Using a long pole, Mr. Parker fetches down a CARRY ALL
from an upper shelf.
PARKER
Something to suit your style, but
sturdy enough for the forty miles
round trip.
Handing the Bag to Anne, she is immediately taken by it.
ANNE
It's beautiful.
SOLOMON
(CAUTIOUSLY)
At what price?
ANNE
We will take it. Children, come
see what your father has just
purchased for me.
As the children run over - chattering excitedly about the
new gift - they RUN PAST JASPER who has quietly entered
the store.
At the checkout counter sits a portrait of WILLIAM HENRY
HARRISON, the edges draped in black crepe. Before the
book sits a LEDGER. Mr. Parker asks of Solomon:
PARKER
If you would sign our condolence
book. My hope is to find a way to
forward it to the Widow Harrison.
Sad days for the nation.
SOLOMON
Yes, certainly. Poor Mrs. Harris
and her children. I hope brighter
times ahead.

Jasper looks scared, timid. It's as though he'd like to
engage, but is unsure of as to how. Noting Jasper, Parker
SAYS:
PARKER
A moment, sir, and you will be
assisted.
SOLOMON
If we could discuss the price...

PARKER
Forgive me, Mrs. Northup. A
customer waits. Welcome, sir.
To Jasper, with good nature:
SOLOMON
Shop well, but mind your wallet.
PARKER
Ignore the gentleman's nonsense.
Now, may I interest you in a new
cravat? Pure silk by way of the--
Before Parker can finish, the door opens. It's Jasper's
Master, FITZGERALD. He's stern, clearly displeased.
FITZGERALD
Jasper!
(TO PARKER)
My regrets for the intrusion.
SOLOMON
No intrusion.
Fitzgerald looks to Solomon. It is a cold glare as
though he wasn't speaking to, and has no interest in a
response from a black man. Looking back to Parker:
FITZGERALD
Good day, sir.

Anne, busy in the kitchen, puts the final touches to the
meal, which is just about to begin. Solomon, in the
meanwhile, sits at the head of the table reading from a
NEWSPAPER. He reads to his children solemn news of the
funeral arrangements for the recently deceased President
Harrison.
SOLOMON
"Thus has passed away from earth
our late President."
Solomon starts from the top of the article.
SOLOMON (CONT'D)
"During the morning, from sunrise,
the heavy bells had been pealing
forth their slow and solemn toll
while the minute guns announced
that soon the grave would receive
its trust. Our city as well as
our entire nation has been called
to weep over the fall of a great
and good man. One who was by the
wishes of a large majority of our

place of trust within their gift.
William Henry Harrison."
A long moment of quiet, the family continuing to eat.
Then, from Margaret:
MARGARET
Will you read it again?
ANNE
Not just now, darling.
Anne enters the dining room and places a large chicken at
the center of the table. As she takes a seat, all heads
are bowed.
MARGARET
For food that stays our hunger,
For rest that brings us ease,
For homes where memories linger,
We give our thanks for these.
ALL
Amen.
SOLOMON
Margaret, that was wonderful.
MARGARET
Thank you, Papa.
SOLOMON
Alonzo, do you have something to
say?
ALONZO
Yes, I helped Momma make this.
ANNE
Yes, and you were such a good
help. Especially making the gravy.
MARGARET
Papa, I would very much like to
learn how to play the violin.
Could you teach me?
ALONZO
Me too!
MARGARET
Yes, but I asked Papa first.
SOLOMON
Both of you, calm down. We will
have our first lesson after this
wonderful dinner. And on that
note, let's start eating.

The family all tuck in to their meal. The scene is one of
warmth and happiness.

Solomon and Anne have fun and difficulty putting the
unruly children to bed. They are tucked in, and each
given a kiss good night. As Margaret lays down to sleep,
Anne blows out the candle darkening the room.
Silhouetted in the doorway, Solomon takes Anne in his
arms, holds her tightly as they both luxuriate in the
simple, beautiful gift that is their children.
7A 7A
Now alone together, we see Anne and Solomon wrapped in
each other's arms. Beyond being physically close,
emotionally close, they are just so very comfortable with
one another. They are the very representation of a
couple who are made for each other.
They look at each other for a prolonged time.
SOLOMON
(COMICALLY FORLORN)
Three weeks. Two days.
ANNE
It is the custom. I wonder what
you'll do without me?
SOLOMON
I won't stay idle.
SOLOMON's eyes lower.
ANNE
Darling, it's good money.
SOLOMON
If only I didn't have to share
your cooking with other people.
ANNE holds his gaze.
ANNE
You don't.
They kiss.

7.
Back in his house, we see Solomon packing: putting some
clothes in a travel case, and collecting his violin as
well.
Solomon sits down to write a letter; pen poised over
paper with already a few lines written. But Solomon
thinks better of it. WITH LITTLE THOUGHT HE TEARS THE
PAPER AND SETS IT ASIDE. WE SHOULD GET THE SENSE THAT
THE ABSOLUTE VALUE OF BEING ABLE TO COMMUNICATE BY LETTER
IS LOST ON SOLOMON. THIS FACT WILL HAVE GREAT WEIGHT IN
THE NEAR FUTURE.
14 14
Solomon enters the buggy, carpet bag in hand. Brown and
Hamilton are waiting. They ride in a covered carriage
led by a pair of "noble" horses.
HAMILTON
No letter to post?
SOLOMON
No need. My return will coincide
with my family's.
BROWN
We're off then.
15 15
-MID TO LATE APRIL, 1841-
We find ourselves in a roadside pub. It serves the
purpose of drinking and diversion, and little more. As
Solomon plays his violin, Brown and Hamilton perform a
decent, paired magic routine before a SPARSE AUDIENCE NOT
OF "SELECT CHARACTER."
11.
After the show, the pub now fairly empty, Solomon,
Hamilton and Brown sit down to eat. Hamilton and Brown
drink, but again Solomon abstains. Though Solomon
remains cool, Hamilton and Brown put up a great show of
being disappointed as Hamilton counts out what little
money was collected.
HAMILTON
Not an additional tip from a one
of them. They expect to be
entertained for nothing.
BROWN
And not satisfied a bit despite
giving them more than what they
paid for.
SOLOMON
It's the national mood. There's
too much grief to make room for
frivolity.
HAMILTON
My sincerest apologies, Solomon.
You were promised opportunity, and
you were given none.
BROWN
The opportunity is with the
circus. A two man show poorly
promoted, what were we to expect?
But the circus bills itself.
HAMILTON
True.
BROWN
I have told you of the circus with
which we are connected. Creatures
from the darkest of Africa.
Acrobats from the Orient who--
SOLOMON
You have described it, yes.
BROWN
Yes. We need to return
immediately to Washington.
Solomon...I believe us familiar
enough now, but forgive me if I am
bold...would you consider making
the trip with us?
Solomon gives a bit of a laugh at the idea.
(CONTINUED)
12.
16 CONTINUED: 16
HAMILTON
Entertaining at pubs and inns has
it's place, but a man of your
skills deserves better.
BROWN
Hear, hear.
HAMILTON
And more importantly you would
build your own name and following.
The circus tends to attract those
with the highest of reputations.
An introduction here and there
could amount to a lifetime of
reward. Now would be the time.
With your family away, an
opportunity presents itself.
BROWN
Said as fellow artists as well as
businessmen. Well worth the
effort at least.
SOLOMON
You present a flattering
representation. As my family will
be traveling back shortly, perhaps
I might commit only to one trial
engagement.
HAMILTON
Oh, very good, sir. Very good. I
cannot recall being so excited.
BROWN
There is a practical concern. If
you are to continue on with us you
should obtain your free papers.
SOLOMON
Not necessary.
BROWN
Here in New York, no. But we will
be entering slave states and as a
matter of precaution... It's to
all our benefit we should not have
to come to account for your well
being.
HAMILTON
Six shillings worth of effort
could well save much trouble
later.

We'll go to the Customs House in
the morning, then travel on. Good
business all around.

A decent though crowded, boisterous and smoke-filled
joint. Very lively. Solomon, Hamilton and Brown are
among several parties drinking in the hotel's bar. As
with seemingly everywhere in the city black crepes
accessorize the background. Brown counts out $43.00 IN
COIN on the tabletop. Solomon is astonished by the
amount.
BROWN
Forty-three dollars. All to you.
SOLOMON
That...it's far more than my wages
amount to.
BROWN
Consider the remainder an advance
from the circus. I cannot tell
you...I honestly wish you had seen
the expression of our director
when I described your abilities.
He was fairly overcome with
excitement.
HAMILTON
You should have invited him to sup
with us.
BROWN
I did. I did, but so many
preparations before the company is
to depart.
SOLOMON

Washington debut. But tonight, our

Both Hamilton and Brown hold up their tankards to drink.

imbibe.
Hamilton and Brown drink again, and Solomon does as well.

Hamilton and Brown help Solomon to lumber up the spiral
staircase, passing the occasional bemused guest.
Hamilton is placing a spittoon near Solomon's bed, where
a prone and reeling Solomon lays. Hamilton sits on the
bed. As he strokes Solomon's sweaty face, Hamilton
speaks sweetly.
HAMILTON
I'm afraid that Brown and I
haven't brought you much luck.
But rough waters bring smooth
sailing. Eventually they do.
SOLOMON
....So...so sorry...
HAMILTON
Shhh. We won't hear it. We
won't.
BROWN
Let him sleep.
HAMILTON
Hmm. A good night's sleep. And
tomorrow...tomorrow you will feel
as well and refreshed as though
the earth were new again.
Hamilton lingers a bit too long and a bit too close to
Solomon for Brown's taste. With more than a bit of
SIGNIFICATION:
BROWN
Hamilton! Nothing more we can do
for him.
HAMILTON
Such is the pity.
Displaying an odd sort of disappointment, Hamilton slinks
away from the bed. He crosses to, and BLOWS OUT A
CANDLE. The room goes dark with a blackness more than
night. Brown and Hamilton exit. Solomon lays in the
dark and moans. His sounds becoming MORE AND MORE
DISTRESSED.

Solomon stirs, then slowly awakes to his new
circumstances. He finds himself in a nearly lightless
room about twelve feet square with walls of solid
masonry. There is a thick and well-locked door, a small
window covered with iron bars and a shutter. The only
furniture is a wood stool and an old fashioned, dirty box
stove. As Solomon rises he sees that his HANDS are
CUFFED - the chain running to a bolt in the ground - and
his LEGS IN IRONS. At first Solomon is incredulous. But
that emotion is replaced first by fury and then panic.
He begins to pull on the chains, fight against them. He
does so with increasing desperation. Solomon flails
about, the sounds of the steel chains whipping and
beating against the masonry. He grunts and screams
without regard as the cuffs and irons bite into his
flesh, but he cannot pull himself free.
After several minutes of intense effort, Solomon tires,
slows, then finally he collapses. And in this collapsed
state he remains.
25 25
Solomon again awakens. He hears sounds beyond the
door...footsteps. Eventually the door opens. Enter
JAMES BURCH - who runs the slave pen - and EBENEZER
RADBURN who works as a turnkey and overseer.
As the door opens, this is the first light to seep into
the otherwise near-black room. The shine is painful to
Solomon's eyes. With no salutation whatsoever, Burch
ASKS:
BURCH
Well, my boy, how yah feel now?
Solomon rises up as best he can. With all the resolve he
can put together he states what he considers to be fact:
SOLOMON
I am Solomon Northup. I am a free
man; a resident of Saratoga, New
York. The residence also of my
wife and children who are equally
free. I have papers. You have no
right whatsoever to detain me--
BURCH
Yah not any--
SOLOMON
And I promise you - I promise -
upon my liberation I will have
satisfaction for this wrong.
BURCH
Resolve this. Produce your
papers.
(CONTINUED)
17.
25 CONTINUED: 25
With confidence Solomon goes to the pocket of his
trousers. He searches one, then the other, but they are
empty. He feels quickly about himself, but clearly his
papers have been lifted. Solomon's confidence shifts,
but to resolve rather than fear. Papers or none, he will
not be easily cowed. Still, Burch asserts:
BURCH (CONT'D)
Yah no free man. And yah ain't
from Saratoga. Yah from Georgia.
A moment. Not a word spoken among the trio, but Solomon
and Burch do some serious eye fucking, neither man
yielding. Burch says again:
BURCH (CONT'D)
Yah ain't a free man. Yah nuthin'
but a Georgia runaway.
Burch waits for Solomon to acquiesce. Solomon does not
in any way. Both men exchange a long and daring stare.
The two are clearly at an intellectual stand off. Burch,
leans to Radburn, SAYS SOMETHING WHICH WE CANNOT
DISTINGUISH.
Radburn walks off-camera and returns with a pair of
"instruments:" a PADDLE - the flattened portion, which is
about the size in circumference of two open hands, and
bored with a small auger in numerous places. He also
carries a WHIP. A cat-o-nine tails; a large rope of many
strands. The strands unraveled and a knot tied at the
extremity of each. Burch says again:
BURCH (CONT'D)
Yah a runaway nigger from Georgia.
Solomon stands with a quiet stoicism. He will say
nothing of the kind.
As that is the case, Solomon is seized by both men. He is
pulled over the bench, face downward, shirt still on his
back. Radburn then STEPS ON HIS CHAINS, holding Solomon
down in a bent position.
With no preamble, Burch begins to beat Solomon about the
back with the paddle. Burch strikes him wordlessly - no
taunting, no sneering. Solomon screaming against each
blow. His back immediately SWELLING WITH WELTS AND
BRUISES.
This beating continues on and on and on until quite
literally Burch WEARS HIMSELF OUT with the effort.
Dripping in sweat and panting:
(CONTINUED)
18.
25 CONTINUED: (2) 25
BURCH (CONT'D)
Yah still insist yah a free man?
SOLOMON
...I...I insist...
Burch regrets hearing this. Not from sympathy, but
rather because he's nearly too tired to go back to
beating Solomon. Yet, as if returning to work, Burch
returns to pummeling Solomon. Burch punctuates the blows
WITH:
BURCH
Yah a slave. Yah a Georgia slave!
Burch continues to strike, and strike... This time until
the paddle SNAPS IN HALF. Burch then GRABS THE WHIP.
Hardly missing a stroke, he whips Solomon relentlessly,
the flails cutting into Solomon's back. Again, Burch's
arm tires before Solomon "breaks."
BURCH (CONT'D)
Are yah slave?
SOLOMON
...No...
Burch goes back to whipping and whipping, and whipping...
SOLOMON'S BACK IS NOW TORN OPEN WITH LACERATIONS AND
OOZING WITH BLOOD. Finally Burch can whip no more. He
pours sweat and sucks air, leaving himself just enough
energy to take up his instruments and EXIT. Radburn
lingers for a moment. He takes the irons off Solomon's
legs. Opens the window some. As he makes these
gestures, in a patronizing and confidential manner, one
wrought with poor sincerity::
RADBURN
I seen a good many of the black
kind just where yah're. Sick.
Make me sick. Often times the
situation was resolved, and I
think; what was all the beatin'
and abuse for? Things end as they
should, and the violence was for
naught. So why cause trouble when
they ain't no cause for it? Be of
a cooperative nature, and things
don't need be particularly
unpleasant.
(BEAT)
Or, yah can carry on like yah
been, and I fear yah won't live to
see Sunday next.
With that thought, Radburn exits. Solomon rests. But to
rest seems like giving in to defeat. He begins pulling

25 CONTINUED: (3) 25
on his chains. But for all his struggling, the chain
loosens none. Solomon calls out:
SOLOMON
Help me! Someone help me!
If anyone at all hears him, they do not respond. Solomon
continues his plaintive cry for assistance.

IT IS DAY NOW. The door to the yard is thrown open. The
harsh white light floods all over Solomon.

Radburn brings food in to Solomon; a shriveled piece of
meat and some water. Just barely enough to sustain
Solomon. Radburn also has a SHIRT.
RADBURN
That old thing of yours is just
rags and tatters. Need something
proper to wear.
Solomon doesn't move for the clothing.
RADBURN (CONT'D)
Go'won. Put it on.
With slow defiance, Solomon does as instructed. He
removes what remains of his old shirt - the one he was
wearing when first kidnapped - and puts on the one
Radburn brought him. The shirt's ill-fitting and dirty.
Despite that, Radburn says:
RADBURN (CONT'D)
There. Tha's fine. Tha's fine.
Got no gratitude?
SOLOMON
...Thank you...
RADBURN
Yah keep bein' proper, yah'll see
how things work out.
Radburn starts to take the old shirt.
SOLOMON
No! It was from my wife.
RADBURN
Rags and tatters. Rags and
tatters.
Taking the shirt, the "rags and tatters" as he calls
them, Radburn exits, locking the door behind him.
Solomon sits with the plate of food before him. He
pushes the plate away rather than eat.
32 32
Later in the evening. Solomon now shares his space with
Eliza and her children. As the children rest, Eliza
drops into a lament as if pleading her case to Solomon
who lends a sympathetic ear.
Both slyly, and with a bit of aggrandizement:
ELIZA
When I say I had my master's
favor, you understand. Above even
his own wife, I had it. Do you
know that he built a house for me?
Built it on the sole condition
that I reside there with him. The
added promise in time I would be
emancipated. And for nine years
he blessed me with every comfort
and luxury in life.
Displaying the finery she still wears:
ELIZA (CONT'D)
Silks and jewels and even servants
to wait upon us. Such was our
life, and the life of this
beautiful girl I bore for him.
But Master Berry's daughter...she
always looked at me with an unkind
nature. She hated Emily no matter
she and Emily were flesh of flesh.
As Master Berry's health failed,
she gained power in the household.
Eventually, I was brought to the
city on the false pretense of our
free papers being executed. If I
had known what waited; to be sent
south? I swear I would not have
come here alive.

Eliza turns to her children:
ELIZA (CONT'D)
My poor, poor babies.
It's the deep of night, all are sleeping. A KEY TURNS IN
THE LOCK AND THE DOOR OPENS. Burch enters with Radburn
beside him. Both carry LANTERNS with them. Hardly
giving Solomon and Eliza a moment to rouse themselves,
BURCH DEMANDS:
BURCH
Come on. Get yer blankets. Get
up.
Sensing that things will not end well:
ELIZA
No, please don't...
BURCH
I don't want to hear yer talk.
Get in the yard.
ELIZA
Please...
RADBURN
Ain't no need for all that.
Putting hand to Randall's head.
RADBURN (CONT'D)
Jus takin' a li'l trip, tha's all.
Don't want to frighten the

Eliza gives a shake of her head to the negative.
RADBURN (CONT'D)
Alright then. Git yerselves up.
35 35
The slaves are lead to a flat bed of the horse and
carriage. They are made to lay down side-by-side. We stay
with them as some sort of cloth is flung over them,
obscuring and blacking out their view.
At that moment, the screen is BLACKENED and we hear the
sound of the cart moving in haste.
36 36
The slaves are hustled down one at a time into a dark,
dank hold among barrels and boxes of freight...and RATS.
Burch comes around and "checks" the chains; makes sure
they are all secure and locked.
Satisfied, he heads up out of the hold. Radburn follows.
Alone in the dark in the hold, John cries, as does Eliza.
Solomon stares down Burch for as long as he can, as if
wishing bad things. As if wanting to exact some measure
of revenge. But the greater insult is that Burch and
Radburn, engaged in conversation, take no notice of
Solomon whatsoever. He is that insignificant to them.
That fact, that reality, makes Solomon boil with a rage
he cannot express in words.

We are now in the engine room of the steamboat, pistons
pumping, black oily cogs turning, the power and the
rhythm are both aggressive and hypnotic. A shovel comes
into view, feeding the furnace.
Down in the hold the slaves eat, pray. The MULATTO WOMAN
moves among them, catching ELIZA's eye.
MULATTO WOMAN
Cheer up and don't be so cast
down.
Clemens Ray and Solomon watch as the Mulatto Woman
returns to top deck, the trapdoor locked firmly behind
her. Clemens Ray turns to Solomon with a deadpan stern
expression.

If you want to survive, do and say
as little as possible. Tell no

one that you can read and write.

Solomon's face is one of a confused despair.
Solomon is back cleaning in the galley. As he cleans, he
again watches Robert prep food. Robert's skill with a
knife is not lost on Solomon.
The hold is packed tighter now.
Muzzle covering his face, Robert is shackled with his
hands tied behind his back. Solomon and Clemens Ray look
on.
A sailor descends the staircase and takes off Robert's
muzzle, shooting him a forbidding look. He leaves.

Solomon, Clemens Ray and Robert, now in mid-conversation.
ROBERT
I say we fight.
Robert delivers this in a hushed voice.
SOLOMON
The crew is fairly small. If it
were well planned, I believe
they could be strong armed.
CLEMENS RAY
Three can't stand against a whole
crew. The rest here are niggers,
born and bred slaves. Niggers
ain't got the stomach for a fight,
not a damn one.
ROBERT
All I know, we get where we
travelling we'll wish we'd died
trying.
CLEMENS RAY
Survival is not about certain
death, it is about keeping your
head down.
Solomon looks at Clemens Ray, agitated -- his voice now
raised above the previous whispers. Grits his teeth.
SOLOMON
Days ago I was with my family, in
my home. Now you tell me all is
lost. "Tell no one who I really
am" if I want to survive. I don't
want to survive, I want to live.

The slaves are asleep.
A Sailor descends the ladder approaching Eliza. He bends
down and attempts to wake the daughter by caressing her
face.
Solomon rouses, and looks across to witness the scene.
From his vantage point, we see Eliza stand to interrupt
the Sailor. The Sailor looks at Eliza, Eliza looks back
at him. Knowingly she leads him off into a corner of the
hold.
As she does so, Eliza passes Robert who jumps up to stand
between Eliza and the Sailor. Stretching out a firm hand
to the sailor's shoulder, Robert's look says "No you
don't."
Clemens Ray is awake now, watching.
There is an odd moment of stillness between the Sailor
and Robert, an impasse.
We focus on the Sailor's face. Slowly, a greasy smile
erupts upon it. Back now to Robert's face, a look of
incomprehension.
Robert looks down. We follow his gaze to the knife that
has already been jabbed unseen between Robert's ribs.
The sailor withdraws the bloody blade.

floor like a sack of potatoes.
Clemens Ray and Solomon react. Complete horror.

frocks of calico and handkerchiefs to bind about their
heads.
It's an odd, ironic scene. The slaves are in a large and
fairly ornate room within Freeman's house. CAPE PLAYS A
PAINFUL TUNE ON A FIDDLE - background music - as Freeman
tries to line up A SMALL GROUP OF THE SLAVES, he becomes
less patient, jittery and nervous, knowing that his
livelihood is at stake, he wants his slaves to make a
good impression. Sometimes his patience gets the better
of him, and his hands move freely in direction of the
slaves.
The business has the air of an etiquette class, though
what Freeman is trying to do is coach the slaves into
being more "sellable." He works with them in groups of
five or so.
FREEMAN
Tallest to smallest, understand?
Are you taller than her? Then
you'd go before her. Do it.
Move.
(to the group)
Keep your heads up. A sense of
direction; that's how you look
smart. None of those saucer eyes.
Rid yourself of that smile. Look
like a goddamn grinnin' monkey.
Put the least thought in your
head. C'mon, now. Think of
somethin'.
Weary of Cape's playing, Solomon moves to Cape. He asks:
SOLOMON
Can you play a reel?
CAPE
(DISMISSIVE)
Nah. I don't know no reel.
SOLOMON
If I may...?
Cape looks to Freeman:
FREEMAN
He sick of your caterwaulin'. Let
him play, boy. Let's see what he
can do.
Cape reluctantly hands the fiddle over to Solomon.
Solomon tunes it a bit, then begins to play. His fingers
stiff at first, he takes a moment to warm up. But as he
warms up he is, despite the circumstances, masterful.
(CONTINUED)

58 CONTINUED: 58
THE SLAVES ALL CLAP ALONG. SOME DANCE ALONG. All admire
his work. Freeman chief among them.
FREEMAN (CONT'D)
Keep on. Keep on.
Solomon continues to play.
FREEMAN (CONT'D)
A damn sight better than you,
Cape. A damn sight better.
Cape looks bitter as Solomon plays on.
59 59
We come in on an odd sort of sight; A JUMBLE OF ACTIVITY.
CUSTOMERS have come to see Freeman's lot - the room all
gussied up with flowers. Freeman moves among them,
displaying them as a rancher would prize chattel.
Freeman makes the slaves hold their heads up - "look
smart" as he previously admonished them. They are made
to walk briskly back and forth while customers feel their
hands and arms and bodies, turn them about and ask what
skills they possess. The Customers routinely make the
slaves open their mouths and show their teeth.
At times a MALE or FEMALE SLAVE are taken off to the
side, stripped and inspected more minutely.
One of them, John, is stripped and inspected.
Cape, as he's done previously, plays his fiddle.
A buyer - WILLIAM FORD; a man of middle age, and an
attractive nature in his tone of voice - consults a list
he's drawn up and asks of Freeman:
FORD
What is the price for the ones
Platt and Eliza?
FREEMAN
A thousand for Platt; he is a
nigger of talent. Seven hundred
for Eliza. My fairest price.
FORD
You will accept a note?
FREEMAN
As always, from you, Mr. Ford.
Eliza is beside herself as it seems she is about to be
separated from her family. She begs of Ford:
(CONTINUED)
39.
59 CONTINUED: 59
ELIZA
Please, sir... Please don't
divide my family. Don't take me
unless you take my children as
well.
FREEMAN
Eliza, quiet!
ELIZA
You will have the most faithful
slave in me, sir. The most
faithful slave that has ever
lived, but I beg that you do not
separate us.
A BUYER interrupts the skirmish and approaches Freeman
and delivers coolly, eyeing Randall-
BUYER
Your price for the child?
FREEMAN
You see how fit the boy is. Like
ripe fruit. He will grow into a
fine beast.
Randall is made to run, and jump by FREEMAN - exhibiting
his activity and his condition.
FREEMAN (CONT'D)
Six hundred, and that's fair and
final.
BUYER
Done.
He reaches into his waistcoat and retrieves his wallet,
counting out six hundred dollars, placing them into the
already extended hand of Freeman.
Ford sees the distress and panic in Eliza; it visibly
touches him. He now tries to buy EMILY to console her.
FORD
How much for the little girl? You
have no need for her. One so
young will bring you no profit.
FREEMAN
I will not sell the girl. There's
heaps 'n piles of money to be made
off her. She is a beauty. One of
the regular bloods. None of your
thick-lipped, bullet headed,
cotton picking niggers.
(CONTINUED)
39A.
59 CONTINUED: (2) 59
FORD
Her child, man. For God's sake,
are you not sentimental in the
least?
FREEMAN
My sentimentality stretches the
length of a coin. Do you want the
lot, Mr. Ford, or do you pass on
them all?
FORD
I will take the ones Platt and
Eliza.
Eliza grips her children tight.
ELIZA
I will not go without my children.
You will not take them from me.
(CONTINUED)
40.
59 CONTINUED: (3) 59
As if to prove her wrong, Freeman puts a foot to Eliza
and harshly kicks her away from Emily.
ELIZA (CONT'D)
Please, don't. No!
Freeman, to Cape:
FREEMAN
Take her out of here.
Cape DROPS HIS FIDDLE, begins to pull Eliza away toward
the door of the room, but her screaming and pleading do
not abate. IT IS CLEARLY UNSETTLING TO THE OTHER BUYERS.
FREEMAN (CONT'D)
Keep her quiet.
Cape tries to muzzle her with his hand, but Eliza
continues to scream for her children as Emily does for
her mother.
EMILY
Mama... Mama!
FREEMAN
(TO SOLOMON)
Play something! Get the fiddle
and play.
As ordered, Solomon takes up Cape's fiddle and begins to
play lightly.
FREEMAN (CONT'D)
Play!
Solomon plays harder and more loudly. Still, it is
barely enough to drown out Eliza's cries. Freeman gets
the other slaves to clap along with Solomon's playing.
Emily frees herself and runs back, crying but endeavoring
to be strong-
EMILY
Don't cry, Mama. I will be a good
girl. Don't cry. I will keep my
head up and I will look smart. I
will always look smart.
FREEMAN
Make merry, all of you! Goddamn
it, Cape! Keep her quiet or it's
your damned hide I will take it
out of!
Cape pulls a rag, stuffs it in Eliza's mouth. Clamping
both hands over her mouth, he hauls Eliza from the room
by the head. IT IS AN UGLY, UGLY SCENE.
40A.
As we come into the scene, Solomon lays on a blanket on
the floor. Eventually, his eyes flutter, then open. He
is in the foyer of the Ford house. As he gets his
bearings, he looks around the interior. THE SPACE IS
HANDSOME, AND WELL DECORATED. It is sharp contrast to
the bleak surroundings, shacks and dungeons Solomon has
largely been accustom to during his time of slavery. It
will be the "first and last time such a sumptuous resting
place was granted" during his twelve years of bondage.
(CONTINUED)
60.
89 CONTINUED: 89
Solomon doesn't have much chance to luxuriate in his
surroundings. He hears a DOG BARKING just outside, and
is unnerved. Has Tibeats returned to finish what he
started?
From a study, Master Ford appears with a gun in hand. He
goes to the door, opens it and looks outside. He can see
nothing. Satisfied, Ford crosses back over to Solomon.
He is frank with Solomon regarding the situation.
FORD
I believe Tibeats is skulkin'
about the premises somewhere. He
wants you dead, and he will
attempt to have you so. It's no
longer safe for you here. And I
don't believe you will remain
passive if Tibeats attacks. I
have transferred my debt to Edwin
Epps. He will take charge of you.
SOLOMON
(desperate, urgent)
Master Ford, you must know; I am
not a slave.
FORD
I cannot hear that.
SOLOMON
Before I came to you I was a
freeman.
FORD
I am trying to save your life!
And...I have a debt to be mindful
of. That, now, is to Edwin Epps.
He is a hard man. Prides himself
on being a "nigger breaker." But
truthfully I could find no others
who would have you. You've made a
reputation of yourself. Whatever
your circumstances, you are an
exceptional nigger, Platt. I fear
no good will come of it.
90 90
A fire is kindled in the cabin. The slaves finally fix
their own dinner of corn meal. Corn is ground in a small
hand mill. The corn meal is mixed with a little water,
placed in the fire and baked. When it is "done brown"
the ashes are scraped off. Bacon is fried. As the
slaves eat, Abram goes on in great length and with much
emotion about General Jackson.
UNCLE ABRAM
Hold my words: General Jackson
will forever be immortalized. His
bravery will be handed down to the
last posterity. If ever there be
a stain upon "raw militia," he
done wiped away on the eight of
January. I say da result a that
day's battle is of 'mo importance
to our grand nation than any
occurrence 'fo or since. Great
man. Great man in deed. We all
need pray to Heavenly Father da
General reign over us always.
96 96
The slaves are sleeping. There is a loud commotion.
Epps enters, drunkenly, forcing the slaves awake.
(CONTINUED)

96 CONTINUED: 96
EPPS
Get up! Get up, we dance tonight!
We will not waste the evenin' with
yer laziness. Get up.
97 97
Despite the lateness of the hour, the slaves are up and
now fully dressed. They take up position in the middle
of the floor. They wait, poised like actors. Solomon
strikes up a tune; Henry joins in with a pan flute and
the slaves dance. They do so very wearily. The whole of
it certainly more torture than pleasure.
Epps, whip in hand:
EPPS
Where's yah merriment? Move yer
feet.
As the slaves twirl about Epps keeps an attentive eye on
Patsey. It should be quite clear that his primary
motivation for holding dances is so that he may view
Patsey twirl about the floor.
This fact is not lost on Mistress Epps. A few moments of
Epps's lust on display is all that the Mistress can bear.
Jealousy mounting, she snatches up a CARAFE. With all
her might she throws it at Patsey. It hits Patsey square
in the face. TOO THICK TO SHATTER, IT LEAVES HER BLOODY
AND WRITHING ON THE FLOOR. The dancing, the music stop.
The slaves, however, react as though it is not the first
time they've seen as much from the Mistress.
Mistress Epps, screaming like a hellion:
MISTRESS EPPS
Sell her!
EPPS
C'mon, now. Wha's this?
MISTRESS EPPS
You will sell the negress!
EPPS
You're talkin' foolish. Sell
little Pats? She pick with more
vigor than any other nigger!
Choose another ta go.
MISTRESS EPPS
No other. Sell her!
EPPS
I will not!
(CONTINUED)
66.
97 CONTINUED: 97
MISTRESS EPPS
You will remove that black bitch
from this property, 'er I'll take
myself back to Cheneyville.
EPPS
Back to that hog's trough where I
found you? Oh, the idleness of
that yarn washes over me. Do not
set yourself up against Patsey, my
dear. That's a wager on which you
will not profit. Calm yerself.
And settle for my affection,
'cause my affection you got. Or,
go. 'Cause I will rid myself of
yah well before I do away with
her!
Mistress Epps stands irate, lost in fury and unable to
even think of what to do. Eventually, optionless, she
storms away.
For a few beats there is only the sound of Patsey
sobbing.
EPPS (CONT'D)
That damned woman! I won't have
my mood spoiled. I will not.
Dance!
Epps sends the whip in Solomon's direction. Solomon
responds by playing.
Treach literally drags the prone Patsey from the floor,
blood still spilling from her face. The slaves, as
ordered, return to dancing.
98 98
A general store in the township of Holmesville. Solomon
stands at the counter as BARTHOLOMEW fills Mistress
Epps's order. Among the items set before Solomon is a
QUANTITY OF FOOLSCAP.
The items are collected for Solomon and placed in a sack.
Solomon giving little thought to them other than getting
them back to the mistress.
As he turns, he glimpses the regalia of slave restraints,
of all different guises; chains, muzzles for sale.

107 CONTINUED: 107
The slaves are asleep. Epps arrives, again without
knocking, with his whip in hand. The slaves stir. Uncle
ABRAM ASKS:
UNCLE ABRAM
We dance tonight, massa?
Epps remains quietly focused on Patsey. And it's clear
from her apprehensive expression just what it is he's
come looking for. This time there is no escaping it. As
if to acknowledge the badness to come, Phebe lightly
cries.
108 108
-NOVEMBER, 1844-
As before, Solomon waits as Bartholomew fills Mistress
Epps order. Among the items set before Solomon is
another quantity of foolscap.
110 110
Solomon takes the slip of paper and hides it within his
fiddle. Perhaps the safest place he can think of. He
acts as though he's hiding away found gold. In reality
it's more than that. For Solomon the paper is a first
step toward freedom.
113 113
-DECEMBER, 1844-
It's another night of Epps's forced revelry. Coming in
quick from the previous scene, we go from Solomon holding
his fiddle, to playing it as the slaves are again made to
dance.
Mistress Epps brings out a tray of freshly baked
pastries. She sets them down on a table.
MISTRESS EPPS
A moment from the dancing. Come
sample what I baked for y'all.
The slaves, thankful for the rest as much as the food,
file toward the tray reciting a chorus of "Thank you,
Mistress." As Patsey moves toward the pastries:
MISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D)
There'll be none for you, Patsey.
Patsey merely turns away. Her non responsiveness,
however, serves only to incite the Mistress. Screaming:
MISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D)
Yah see that? Did yah see the
look of insolence she give me?
EPPS
Seen nothin' but her turn away.
MISTRESS EPPS
Are you blind or ignorant? It was
hot, hateful scorn. It filled
that black face. Yah tell me yah
did'n see it, then yah choose not
to look, or yah sayin' I lie.
EPPS
Whatever it was, it passed.
MISTRESS EPPS
Is that how yah are with the
niggers? Let every ill thought
fester inside 'em. Look at 'em.
(MORE) (CONTINUED)
77.
113 CONTINUED: 113
MISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D)
They foul with it; foul with their
hate. You let it be, it'll come
back to us in the dark a night.
Yah want that? Yah want them
black animals to leave us gut like
pigs in our own sleep?
Epps isn't sure how to respond to the inchoate berating.
It's an invitation for the Mistress to continue.
MISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D)
You are manless. A damned eunuch
if ever there was. And if yah
won't stand for me, I'd pray you'd
at least be a credit to yer own
kind and beat every foul thought
from 'em.
Epps does nothing. The Mistress lets her anger loose.
She moves quickly to Patsey, DRIVES HER NAILS INTO THE
PATSEY'S FACE AND DRAWS THEM DOWN ACROSS HER FEATURES.
FIVE DEEP AND BLOODY GASHES ARE LEFT IN PATSEY'S SKIN,
the moment marked with appropriate screams. Patsey
collapses on the floor, covering her bleeding face.
MISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D)
Beat it from 'em!
Thoroughly cuckolded by the Mistress's actions, Epps
takes his whip and pulls Patsey out of the house. His
intentions are plain.
All the slaves remain silent. The Mistress, however,
displaying high satisfaction, entreats the others:
MISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D)
Eat. Fill yourselves. ...And
then we dance.
The slaves eat, but without a hint of levity.
114 114
We come up on the slaves who lay sleeping. All except
for Patsey. She rises from her bedding, goes to a corner
of the cabin and removes something from a secretive
location. She then moves over to Platt.
PATSEY
Platt... Platt, you awake?
SOLOMON
I am.
PATSEY
I have a request; an act of
kindness.
(CONTINUED)
78.
114 CONTINUED: 114
Patsey displays what she took from hiding. It is a
LADY'S FINGER RING.
PATSEY (CONT'D)
I secreted it from the Mistress.
SOLOMON
Return it!
PATSEY
It yours, Platt.
SOLOMON
For what cause?
PATSEY
All I ask: end my life. Take my
body to the margin of the swamp--
Solomon looks at Patsey as though she were insane.
SOLOMON
No.
PATSEY
Take me by the throat. Hold me
low in the water until I's still
'n without life. Bury me in a
lonely place of dyin'.
SOLOMON
No! I will do no such thing.
The...the gory detail with which
YOU SPEAK--
PATSEY
I thought on it long and hard.
SOLOMON
It is melancholia, nothing more.
How does such despair even come to
you?
PATSEY
How can you not know? I got no
comfort in this life. If I cain't
buy mercy from yah, I'll beg it.
SOLOMON
There are others. Beg them.
PATSEY
I'm begging you!
SOLOMON
Why? Why would you consign me to
damnation with such an un-Godly
request?
(CONTINUED)
79.
114 CONTINUED: (2) 114
PATSEY
There is God here! God is
merciful, and He forgive merciful
acts. Won't be no hell for you.
Do it. Do what I ain't got the
strength ta do myself.
Solomon says nothing. Clearly he's not about to do the
deed. With nothing else to do, knowing she is damned
with every breath she draws, Patsey crawls back to her
spot on the floor and lays herself down.

118 CONTINUED: 118
Slaves are crammed into the shack - LITERALLY ON TOP OF
EACH OTHER - as they try to sleep. Some lay, some sit
up. Packed in like cattle, there is barely room to move
let alone draw a deep, clean breath. There is a real
risk of suffocating in the mass. Some cough and wheeze.
A CHILD CRIES...
Among them is Solomon who must believe at this point that
his life has reached its very lowest point. The odds of
survival are slight, let alone the chance of actually
ever returning to his family. This clearly weighs on him
as he struggles to find anything like comfortable space
in the pen.
119 119
Again, the slaves have been herded into the shack and
pressed together.
As he tries to rest - sleep is nearly impossible -
Solomon finds himself face to face with a woman, ANNA.
She is awake. For a few beats she avoids eye contact
with Solomon. She seems, like Solomon, to be
unaccustomed to her surroundings and horribly frightened
by them. Eventually her eyes meet Solomon's. She makes
no sound, but great apprehension spills from her eyes.
Whatever's next, whatever horror awaits, she can barely
stand to face. Fear, proximity... They drive her hand

to Solomon's. After a moment of seemingly reacquainting
herself with genuine human contact, the woman TAKES
(CONTINUED)
82.
121 CONTINUED: (2) 121
SOLOMON'S HAND AND PRESSES IT TO HER BREAST. Solomon
tries to jerk his hand away, but ANNA HOLDS IT IN PLACE.
Manipulating Solomon's hand, she begins to massage her
breast. Solomon takes no real pleasure in the act -
really, neither does Anna. THERE SHOULD BE A TRUE SENSE
ANNA IS JUST SO VERY, VERY DESPERATE FOR HUMAN CONTACT,
FOR THE NEED TO FEEL ALIVE AND LIKE A PERSON RATHER THAN
AN ANIMAL THAT EMOTIONALLY SHE IS WILLING TO ENGAGE
SOLOMON.
The need quickly compounds. Anna presses her lips to
Solomon's. Eventually, SHE DIRECTS HIS HAND BENEATH HER
DRESS AND BETWEEN HER LEGS. Solomon, with slightly more
compassion than a guy making union wages, BEGINS TO
MANIPULATE ANNA WITH HIS HAND. The act remains more
perfunctory than passionate.
We can see Anna moving toward climax and eventual
release. But more - or substantially less - than joyous
sex, it is really just a drug-like inoculation against
reality. But the feeling quickly fades. All that
remains, as with most chance encounters, is regret.
And there is shame, too. This is put on display as Anna
turns away from Solomon. As quickly as it began, it is
as though the act had not happened at all.
122 122
OMIT
We see a sharp object scratching onto a surface. The
tool moves on to form another mark. The sound is
repetitive and almost unbearable. As we move out, we see
the names Anne, Margaret, Alonzo. They are engraved onto
the violin, in the hidden area where Solomon would rest
his chin.
Solomon looks at it for a moment, moving his fingertips
across the engraving. His face full of loss.
Sadly, he lifts his instrument under his chin and leaning
his head to the side as if to play.
A party has commenced at the noble home of one MR.
YARNEY. A group of REVELERS have gathered and are on the
dance floor, in fancy dress. Their faces are covered with
a variation of decorative masks. The party is a feast of
celebration. As entertainment, SOLOMON ACCOMPANIES A
GROUP OF MUSICIANS, no more than three. And as he does
so, they all play with jovial liveliness. Clearly a good
time is being had by all.
128 128
Solomon stealthfully makes his way into the storage shed.
Dried and smoked meats are hung, and milled corn is
about. Taking out a handkerchief, Solomon begins to load
it with food. Not too much. Not so much his thievery
will be readily noticed, but he does avail himself.
132 132
As others sleep, by the light of dying coals, Solomon
uses the quill to test the boiled bark. The liquid holds
as a form of ink. It is no?t ideal, but it is legible on
the page. Armed with this, Solomon writes his letter.
138 138
As Epps said, it is days of long since. The slaves are
back to having their cotton weighed in the Gin House
EPPS
Wiley...?
TREACH
Two hundred sixty pounds.

Bob?
TREACH
Three hundred forty pounds for
Bob.
EPPS
Patsey?
TREACH
Five hundred twenty pounds.
EPPS
Tha's a girl. Don't never let me
down. Platt?
TREACH
One hundred sixty pounds.
Before Treach is even done announcing the weight, Epps
has pulled Solomon aside to where Uncle Abram already
awaits his fate.
EPPS
Armsby?
TREACH
Sixty four pounds.
Epps speaks to Armsby sternly, but nothing of the manner
in which he would address the slaves.

A good days labor would average
two hundred pounds.
ARMSBY
Yes, sir.

I'm sure in time y'll develope as
a picker, but it takes effort,
boy. Put some damn effort into
it.
ARMSBY
Yes, sir.
To Treach, regarding Solomon and Abram:
EPPS
Take 'em out. Get to whippin'.
No force is needed. The slaves understand the situation.
They follow Treach out of the Gin house.

-AUGUST, 1847-
We again hear the sound of the HORN BLOWING signaling the
start of the work day for the slave.
Solomon goes to RETRIEVE THE SMALL PACKAGE FROM UNDER A
ROCK AT THE BASE OF A TREE. Solomon returns the letter to
hiding. He takes the money with him and cautiously moves
from the area.

The door opens. Solomon enters. Armsby is surprised to
see him. So much so, he isn't sure what greeting to
give. Solomon gives a blunt introduction. Re: the
COINS:
SOLOMON
The proceeds of my fiddling
performances. A few picayunes,
but all I have in the world. I
promise them to you if you will do
me the favor I require. But I beg
you not to expose me if you cannot
grant the request.
ARMSBY
What do you ask?
SOLOMON
First, your word, sir.
ARMSBY
On my honor.
SOLOMON
It is a simple enough request. I
ask only that you deposit a letter
in the Marksville post office.
And that you keep the action an
inviolable secret forever. The
details of the letter are of no
consequence. Even at that, there
would be an imposition of much
pain and suffering were it known I
was the author. A patron is what
I require, sir.
ARMSBY
Where's the letter now?
SOLOMON
...It is not yet written. I will
have it in a day. Two at most, my
skill with composition as poor as
it is.
Armsby considers the request.
ARMSBY
I will do it. And will accept
whatever payment is offered.
Solomon hesitates. In the moment, he's not so sure he
can wholly give himself over to trust.
(CONTINUED)

150 CONTINUED: 150
ARMSBY (CONT'D)
To assist you, I put my own self
at risk. I will do so, but fair
compensation is all I ask.
Solomon hands over the money.
ARMSBY (CONT'D)
Draw up your letter. We will meet
again. In two days?
SOLOMON
In two days. ...Thank you.
Solomon exits.
151 151
The slaves are at rest. Gripping his whip Epps enters,
without so much as a knock at the door. For a moment
there's curiosity; is he there for a dance, for
Patsey...?
Looking right to Solomon:
EPPS
Get up.
Solomon does. Epps heads back out into the dark. He
says nothing, but his directive is clear: Follow me.
Patsey is laid on some boards where she remains for a
long time with eyes closed and groaning in agony. Phebe
applies melted tallow to her wounds, and all try to
assist and console her.
In time Patsey opens her eyes. She looks to Solomon.
She does not say a word. She just looks at him...and
then her eyes close again.

EVENING
-APRIL, 1852-
Solomon and Bass are working together alone on the
extension. From the amount of work that's been done on
it, it should be obvious that days have now passed.
Solomon makes a cautious approach to Bass. As casually
as he can he inquires:
SOLOMON
Master Bass, I want to ask you
what part of the country you came
from?
BASS
No part of this land. I was born
in Canada. Now guess where that
is.
SOLOMON
Oh, I know where Canada is. I
have been there myself.
BASS
Have you?
SOLOMON
Montreal and Kingston and
Queenston and a great many places.
And I have been in York state,
too. Buffalo and Rochester and
Albany, and can tell you the names
of the villages on the Erie canal
and the Champlain canal.
Bass gives Solomon a long and curious stare.
BASS
Well traveled for a slave. How
came you here?
SOLOMON
Master Bass, if justice had been
done I never would have been here.
BASS
How's this? Tell me all about it.
SOLOMON
I am afraid to tell you, though I
don't believe you would tell
Master Epps if I should.
BASS
Every word you speak is a profound
secret.
(CONTINUED)
112-115.
160 CONTINUED: 160
Solomon holds a moment. Hasn't he heard the same promise
before? Prior to Solomon stating his case, WE FADE TO:
Hours have passed. Bass reflects on the story that Epps
has told in the intervening.
BASS
How many years all told?
SOLOMON
Just nearly...just passed eleven.
BASS
Your story is...it is amazing, and
in no good way.
SOLOMON
Do you believe, sir, in justice as
you have said?
BASS
I do.
SOLOMON
That slavery is an evil that
should befall none?
BASS
I believe so.
SOLOMON
If you truly do, I would ask...I
would beg that you write my
friends in the north, acquainting
them with my situation and
beseeching them to forward free
papers, or take such steps as they
might consider proper to secure my
release.
Bass looks at Solomon, holding his gaze for more than a
prolonged beat.
SOLOMON (CONT'D)
My daughter Margaret is possibly
now 19 and my son Alonzo, 16. I
miss them so. It would be an
unspeakable happiness to clasp my
wife and my family again.
Bass hands Solomon an end of a long plank of wood and
looks over his shoulder, as if to camouflage the
conversation by work. They both lift it toward the
floorboards. Finally Bass speaks.

BASS
I have always forgone
relationships and family. I did
once have a sweetheart who I loved
deeply.
Bass points to a measuring tool, which Solomon
immediately hands over.
BASS (CONT'D)
But that was a long, long time
ago. I've been traveling this
country for the best part of
twenty years. My freedom is
everything. The fact that I can
walk out of here tomorrow gives me
most pleasure. I see the aching in
your eyes, the pain of not being
attached to your loved ones. My
life doesn't mean much to anyone,
but it seems your life means a lot
to a lot of people. What you have
just said to me scares me, and I
must say, sir, I am afraid. Not
just for you, but for me.
They continue working, fixing the floorboards in unison.
Solomon, slightly confused.
BASS (CONT'D)
I will write your letter sir, for
if I could bring freedom to you,
it will be more than a pleasure.
It will be a duty. Now, would you
be so kind as to pass me those
nails, sir.
We pull back to reveal the two men dwarfed by the
unfinished structure. They continue to work, as if the
conversation had never occurred.

THE DOOR TO THE ROOM OPENS. Mr. Parker enters, Solomon
behind. We first see Anne, in her finest attire; the
Northup children: Alonzo, who is now seventeen and
Margaret who is now twenty - SHE CARRIES WITH HER A
BUNDLE. Also present is MARGARET'S HUSBAND. The family
waits patiently, dutifully...but anxiously.
Anne rises to greet him, but holds back. All around, the
body language of the family is stiff and awkward. They
are, after all - after twelve years - little more than
familiar strangers.
SOLOMON
I apologize for my appearance. I
have had a difficult time of
things these past many years.
Solomon looks among his family; trying to recall them as
much as they look to see familiarity within him. To his
CHILDREN:
SOLOMON (CONT'D)
Alonzo... Margaret, yes? You do
not recognize me, do you? Do

SOLOMON (CONT'D)
you...do you even remember the
last time we saw each other? I
put you on a carriage with your
mother...
Margaret, tearing, hugs her father. Solomon almost
breaks, but he keeps himself together. Looking to the
UNKNOWN MAN:
SOLOMON (CONT'D)
And who is this?
MARGARET
He is my husband.
SOLOMON
Husband?
MARGARET'S HUSBAND
It is very good to meet you, sir.
SOLOMON
We have much acquainting to do.
Margaret rises, she presents her bundle to her father.
MARGARET
And this is your grandson.
Solomon Northup Staunton.
SOLOMON
...Solomon...
The fact his grandson carries his name, is overwhelming.
Solomon breaks down. Emotionally, physically... But
ANNE IS THERE TO CATCH HIM. As she holds him, Solomon
says to Anne with all his heart:
SOLOMON (CONT'D)
Forgive me.
ANNE
There is nothing to forgive.
The pair, joined now by the whole family, hold on to each
other for life...and one would think for all the rest of
their lives.

BLACK

against whites. The charges against the kidnappers were
eventually dismissed.
Northup spent the rest of his life working as an
abolitionist, and with the Underground Railroad.
Solomon Northup most likely died between 1863 and 1875.
The exact date, place, and circumstances of his death
remain unknown.
