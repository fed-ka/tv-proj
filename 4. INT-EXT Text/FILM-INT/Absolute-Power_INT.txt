The saddest eyes you ever saw.
We are looking at an El Greco drawing.
It is a study for
one of his paintings.
PULL BACK TO REVEAL --
A bunch of art students are doing sketches of the eyes,
the elongated fingers, the slender hands El Greco drew so
brilliantly.
Most of the students are around 20.
A couple of suburban
housewives are there too.
And one older man.
This is LUTHER WHITNEY. Mid 60s, very fit, neatly
dressed. At quick glance, he seems as if he might be a
successful company executive.
As we watch him draw we can tell he is capable of great
concentration. And patient. With eyes that miss
nothing: He has pilot's eyes.
We'll find out more about him as time goes on, but this
is all you really have to know: Luther Whitney is the
hero of this piece. As we watch him draw --
Luther's sketchbook. He is finishing his work on the
eyes, and he's caught the sadness: It's good stuff.
Luther. It's not good enough for him.
He looks at his
work a moment, shakes his head.
GIRL STUDENT
Don't give up.
LUTHER
I never do.
GIRL STUDENT
May I?
She's indicated his sketchbook.
He nods.
She starts
thumbing through.
The sketchbook as the pages turn.
Detail work. Eyes and hands. The eyes are good.
The
hands are better. Very skillful.

CLOSEUP - LUTHER
*
An enigmatic smile.
Now, from that --

Luther walks in. Nothing fancy here. Strictly working
class. And relatively empty. An overweight bald man
Luther's age works behind the bar. This is RED. They
are good enough friends not to ask each other questions.
LUTHER
(as they nod to
each other)
Redhead.
RED
Luther.
(as Luther hands
him a videotape)
Your life would be a whole lot
simpler if you could learn to
operate a V.C.R.
LUTHER
My only failing.
As he turns --

as he enters. Neat, tidy. A Cuisinart, a cheese slicer,
lots of other nice equipment. As he begins putting food
away --

Evening now. Table set for one. A single candle.
Beside the candle is Luther's sketch pad. Now Luther
himself moves INTO VIEW, carrying a tray. He puts it
down.
A gorgeous omelet is on a fine china plate, parsley
sprinkled neatly on top. An elegant green salad is on
another plate, covered with thinly sliced parmesan
cheese. An expensive water pitcher, a lovely glass.
Clearly, a great deal of thought has gone into dinner.
Luther lights the single candle. We are now aware of a
photograph nearby. The picture is old. A pretty little
girl stands in the center, smiling. Her mother stands
alongside, smiling too. A man is with them, looking at
them happily. It's Luther. When he was young.
Luther studies the photo a moment.
Then he turns, looks
out the window.

Now Luther opens the sketch pad, quickly flips past the
hands and eyes and faces --
-- we are looking at something totally different:
a
mansion.
HOLD ON Luther's drawing of the mansion.
KEEP HOLDING.

A man holds binoculars, studying the place. He wears
dark clothes, tennis shoes. He puts down the binoculars,
begins to smear his face with black camouflage cream --
-- it's Luther, and he's been a
professional thief his
entire life. He's a three-time
loser, but his last
sentence was so long ago and his
skills are now so vast,
so refined, that it is unlikely
he will ever get caught
again.
12
14
The infrared SECURITY DETECTOR -- it immediately starts
to BEEP and you can see the seconds being counted down:
forty, thirty-nine, thirty --
CUT TO:
15
LUTHER
15
-- in his hands now is an automatic screwdriver, no more
than six inches long --
-- he sets to work on the security panel that is inside
in the foyer next to the front door.
The screwdriver undoes the first screw, the second --
CUT TO:
16
SECURITY DETECTOR
16
Thirty-one, thirty, twenty --
CUT TO:
17
SCREWDRIVER
17
Now the third and fourth screws are in hands and he lifts
the security panel away.
The BEEPING sound is constant --
-- and getting louder.
A tiny device, no bigger than a pocket calculator. It
has two wires protruding from it. It is, we are about to
find out, a tiny computer. Luther holds it like a baby.
CUT TO:

SECURITY DETECTOR

panel.

CONTINUED:

The BEEPING is LOUDER still.
The security panel. Luther is attempting delicate work
and it's dark so it isn't easy but he continues to probe
with the wires and --

SECURITY DETECTOR
20
Eleven, ten --

LUTHER

Now the face of the tiny computer is alive with numbers
-- they fly by much too fast for us to make them out
clearly.

Four, three, two --

A glance across the foyer -- the lights of the security
detector go from red to a warm looking green.
Safe.
(CONTINUED)

25
CONTINUED:
25
He allows himself to exhale. Then he's busy again,
unhooking the computer. His fingers, as always, work
quickly, precisely.
25A
25A
The foyer as Luther, once again carrying his backpack,
moves across it. Behind him, the front door is again
shut, the security panel back on, screws all in place.
It's as if he hadn't been there at all...
26
26
Luther walks quickly up -- and here we get a sense of the
vast size of the place -- it feels bigger inside than it
looked in the moonlight.
A Van Gogh at the head of the stairs. Luther moves past
it, then stops, goes back, studies the painting. It's a
late one, when the madness had him and things were
sliding away. Very sad.
Luther looks at it admiringly for another moment --
-- then surprisingly he raises his hand,
and for just an
instant traces the lines of the painting
in the air, as
if trying to figure out how the magic was
done, as if
getting ready for his next museum session
--
-- then almost grudgingly, he moves on, up toward the
third floor.
27
27
Here's a Hopper. One of the great ones, filled with an
overpowering sense of being alone --
-- Luther stares at it almost in awe, whispers "wow,"
moves on.
28
28
Luther, walking down the third-floor corridor.
The corridor walls. No paintings here -- instead we see
a series of framed photographs. The first is of a baby
girl, the next one of the same child at three.
We watch the child grow up in these photos.
At ten she
is already pretty. At fifteen a stunner.

Not a classic beauty by any means, she is turning into,
if you will a latter-day Ann-Margret. The kind of girl
you ached for in high school. The perfect cheerleader.
These are pictures, we will come to know, of Christy
Sullivan. A high school graduation shot at eighteen, a
shot in front of a Burger King at twenty.
CLOSEUP - WEDDING PHOTOGRAPH
*
Christy, looking just fabulous, is 24 and smiling
happily. We can only see her face and the wedding veil
here. Now --
PULL BACK to reveal --
A glorious and expensive white wedding dress.
Christy
holds a bouquet of flowers. Breathtaking.
KEEP PULLING BACK.
And now we can see the groom. Walter Sullivan. Walter
is smiling too, one arm proudly around his lovely bride.
Walter, it might be noted, is eighty years old.
Luther, staring at the photo, shakes his head.
Now he
moves on.
29
29
Luther opens the DOOR. It SQUEAKS. He goes inside,
closes the door firmly. Next, he puts his backpack down,
takes out a low-power non-glare work light, sets it up.
Now he looks around. A huge room, a gigantic canopied
bed.
A nightstand alongside, which contains a small silver
clock, three Danielle Steel novels piled neatly one atop
the other, several more photos of the happy couple --
-- and an antique silver-plated letter opener with a
thick leather handle.
Luther. He studies himself in front of a very large
full-length mirror across from the canopied bed.
Now we realize something -- he isn't studying himself,
he's studying the mirror itself.
He turns, goes to the sitting area where there are chairs
and a sofa and a large TV and VCR.
(CONTINUED)
9.
29
CONTINUED:
29
Three remotes on a side table. Luther carefully picks up
the middle one, crosses the room with it, points it at
the large mirror, clicks once --
-- and the mirror swings silently open.
A room is revealed. All we can see of it so far is this:
There is an armchair in the middle facing where the
mirror had been.
Luther turns back toward the sitting area, the remote
held in his hand.
The side table. Luther puts the remote down -- very
carefully. In the exact position it had been. Now he
takes a moment, blows on his hands, rubs them together.
Then -- Luther takes a collapsible duffel bag out of his
backpack, moves with the work light into the revealed
room --
30
30
It's a vault! And it's FULL! There's cash, naturally,
piles of the stuff. Plus all kinds of other valuables
we'll get around to.
Luther's a little stunned -- it's more than he hoped for.
He glances at the armchair -- there is a remote on it
that is identical to the one he replaced at the side
table.
Now he opens his duffel all the way and sets to work.
First the cash goes in -- all neatly bundled. Large
denominations. Lots of bundles. Next are a series of
slender boxes --
The first box as Luther opens it.
Jewelry.
Into the duffel it goes.
Luther, emptying more jewelry boxes into the duffel.
And
still more. As he continues to do this --
31
31
All is quiet. High on a wall, the security light beams a
friendly green.
Now, from somewhere, a distant sound.
LAUGHTER?
Was it
laughter? Doesn't matter, it's gone.
)B(

32
Luther has moved deeper into it -- he's finished with the
jewelry. Now he's examining piles of bonds.
Into the duffel they go.
He takes a breath, glances around.
Perfect.
Coins.
Antique ones.
They disappear into the duffel.
Stamp books.
Gone into the swelling duffel.
Luther as he hears now the DISTANT LAUGHTER.
Not so
perfect.
33
33
*
He moves quickly out of the vault, takes a step toward
the door -- the GIGGLING is getting LOUDER, closer. Two
people. A man and a woman.
Luther stops, mutters "shit!" -- glances around -- No
place to hide. Luther, grabbing his backpack, moves into
the vault, turns off his work light, and shuts the door
with the remote. The DOOR CLICKS --
34
34
-- Luther is alone in the darkness.
A burst of LAUGHTER now.
Growing nearer still.
Luther moves into the back of the vault, crouches down,
doing his best to hide behind the armchair. Trapped,
Luther waits in silence, trying not to breathe...
Now he can hear a SQUEAK -- the BEDROOM DOOR has opened.
HOLD.
35
35
Dark -- except for a slant of light from the hall outside
the open bedroom door.
Two people are briefly visible as they enter, a MAN and a
WOMAN. The CLINK of GLASS. Stifled LAUGHTER.
The Woman closes the bedroom door.
Darkness again.
And now the LAUGHING sound increases.
GIGGLING, really.
11.
36
36
Luther in the pitch-black vault. The GIGGLING is MUTED
but it is there. He is starting to perspire.
37
37
The woman flicks on the lights and as she does --
38
38
Luther as the burst of light hits him like a fist -- and
it's over.
Luther blinks, confused, looks around --
-- because it isn't over, he hasn't been caught.
The door to the vault is suddenly gone. Luther is
staring straight into the goddamn bedroom.
Because the door is a two way mirror. Now it's as if he
was watching the bedroom on a giant TV screen.
Just a few feet away, just outside the door.
Where things are clearly starting to heat up.
Luther moves to the armchair, sits.
There is nothing to
do now but wait. He settles in.
39
39
They are staring at each other.
We have seen the woman already -- she's CHRISTY SULLIVAN.
But the pictures in the corridor did not do her justice.
This is a fabulous-looking twenty-five-year-old woman.
Long, golden hair, a round face that sets off her deep
blue eyes, a tanned, curving body. A bare-shouldered
black dress. An expensive necklace.
One more thing:
she is staggering drunk.
The man is ALAN RICHMOND, wealthy, successful, handsome
and fit. Mid-forties. He wears an elegantly-cut suit.
Two additional points: (1) Richmond is clearly not the
husband in the wedding photo. (2) He is drunker than she
is.
(CONTINUED)
12.
39
CONTINUED:
39
Richmond carries a vodka bottle and two tumblers.
He
fills them, gives one to her.
They touch glasses.
Down the hatch.
Tight laughter.
He looks at her.
She looks at him.
There's a lot of sexual tension in the
air.
But now he begins looking around, checking things out.
She spots this.
CHRISTY
(drunk)
It's okay -- I told him I was
sick -- anyway, he's gone --
relax...
He nods then, more at ease.
And he blows her a kiss.
She catches it -- and now she starts to parade for him.
Her body moving very slowly.
He pours himself another shot, chugs it, watches.
Now --
40
40
Luther suddenly terrified and we find out why.
41
41
Christy, fumbling with her necklace, looks across the
room --
What she's looking at:
the side table with the remote
that opens the vault.
42
42
Luther, frozen, as Christy starts toward the table.
43
43
The table and the remote waiting there.
44

Luther, mouth dry...

Richmond, reaching out for her, then as she passes him;
he takes her by the hand --
-- and now they are dancing, their bodies pressed
together. They move slowly. She hums. He tries to get
fancy, spin her with one arm --
-- no good. They're too drunk for it, starts to lose
balance, separate.
They giggle. Smile at each other. Now Christy manages
to unhook her necklace, and as she starts to drop it in
*
the drawer of the nightstand --
*
46
46
Luther.
A genuine sigh of relief --
-- which suddenly dies --
47
47
Christy, as she spins toward the table again, still with
the necklace in her hand.
48
48
Luther, and there's nothing he can do now but watch.
49
49
Richmond, watching too, emptying the vodka bottle into
his tumbler, chugging it down and now...
The table as Christy reaches out, grabs a remote, turns.
50
50
Luther dead in the water because --
51
CHRISTY'S

pointing the goddam thing at him --
-- and as she CLICKS it --

52
52
Luther, and for a moment, he's like a goddam deer caught
in the headlights --
-- but now here comes another sigh of relief and we find
out why.
53
53
Suddenly there's ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING -- she's turned
the STEREO ON. Christy starts humming, replaces the
clicker, drops the necklace in the drawer.
*
Then they are into each other's arms. Their bodies
press. Their bodies sway. He moves a hand to her
breasts --
-- Christy breaks loose, shakes a finger at him, as if to
say, "naughty, naughty" --
-- then with one hand, she pulls a zipper down. The
dress falls off her body. Her breasts spring free. She
is wearing only her panties now and high heels. And a
smile.
She is stunning looking and she knows it and men have
always gone nuts over her and she knows that too. And
Richmond can't resist her either, goes to her, bends her
back, caresses her neck, begins sucking her nipples.
Christy moans.
54
54
Luther, in the chair, embarrassed, averting his eyes.
But the MOANING from the other room GROWS LOUDER, more
insistent.
55
55
Christy, pulling away for a moment, starting to work at
Richmond's tie, shakes him out of his suit jacket,
reaches for his belt, loosens it. She is working at his
shirt buttons now and their breathing is audible and in a
moment he is down to his boxer shorts and then her
panties are off, her shoes kicked away and they are near
the vault mirror now. As they approach it, they stare at
themselves.
56
56
Luther, moving farther back in his chair as their faces
are just a couple of feet away --

as his eyes are open --
-- the look on his drunken face is scary.
58
58
Luther, transfixed by that look, transfixed and worried.

IN CLOSEUP - NIGHT
looking at each other now, and she is smiling happily and
looking at him and he is smiling happily and looking at
her, and whatever was on his face just before has gone.
60
60
Luther, watching as they turn for the gigantic canopied
bed.
61
61
The bed as they stop alongside it and kiss -- it's their
first. And her arms go around his neck and she holds him
like that, her eyes shut tight --
62
62
Luther -- watching because Richmond's eyes are not shut,
they are wide open and they stare at the mirror and the
awful look from before is back, only worse, and then
without warning, he grips her buttocks roughly --
-- and slaps her hard on the ass, over and over and
Christy is shocked, surprised, pulls away. Richmond
smiles at her sweetly.
Christy.
Shaking her head.
Richmond. He continues to smile, makes a courtly
gesture, kissing her fingertips in apology.
(CONTINUED)
16.
62
CONTINUED:
62
Christy. She smiles in acknowledgement and they move
onto the bed. She pushes him down and straddles him.
Richmond, from her POINT OF VIEW -- a wonderfully-
handsome man.
Christy, from his POINT OF VIEW. A glorious, vibrant
young woman. She smiles, touches her lips to a finger,
reaches out, touches the finger to his mouth.
It's a sweet moment.
They smile.
Then he reaches up, and without a word, grabs her breasts
and squeezes and twists them brutally and Christy is
shocked and she tries to make him stop but he won't, and
she cries out in pain but he still won't stop so she
slaps him in the face. He slaps her back, viciously,
right in the mouth and now there is blood mixing with her
lipstick and she rolls off the bed onto the floor.
Christy sits there stunned.
CHRISTY
(slurred)
You fucking bastard.
And on that --
Richmond, standing now, reaches down to help her up.
Christy hesitates, finally takes his hand and as soon as
she is on her feet --
Christy, kicking him with all she has, in the stomach.
63
63
Luther, silently applauding.
64
64
Richmond, the air momentarily out of him,
falling
drunkenly to the floor, stunned for just
a moment and
clearly in pain, but he is a big man and
he is strong and
he grabs her ankle, yanks, and then both
are laboring on
the floor and Christy kicks him again and
again --
-- but he will not release her ankle.
Each kick only
inflames his drunken rage.
(CONTINUED)
17.
64
CONTINUED:
64
RICHMOND
(very slurred --)
You little whore --
And now they both try and stand.
Neither one does it gracefully, neither one does it
quickly, but Richmond gets there first and as soon as he
is on his feet he begins to strangle her.
Christy, gasping, terrified, she claws at his arms, her
fingers scratching deeply --
-- but he will not let go.
She twists and jerks her body --
-- no good -- he continues to tighten his grip on her
throat --
-- and spreads his legs for better balance.
The bed table, as Christy, beyond desperation reaches
around for something, anything -- her fingers finally
close on the letter opener and in one wild stroke, she
slashes his right arm.
Now he lets go.
And stares, stunned, at his bleeding
arm.
Then he crunches her flush in the
mouth, a brutal blow,
and blood pours from her nose and
mouth and if she
weren't so scared, maybe it would
have stopped her, but
it doesn't -- because somehow she
manages to maintain
balance --
-- and knees him all she has, in the nuts.
It's over -- Richmond falls to the floor, helpless.
He
lies on his back, holding his crotch.
But it isn't over. Christy, blood pouring down her face,
stands over him, the letter opener still tight in her
hand.
And in her eyes you can see it, the homicidal rage --
-- and she drops to her knees beside him --
-- and Richmond can only lie there, watching her --
-- and she gets a better grip on the letter opener --
-- and Richmond still only lies there, watching her --
(CONTINUED)

-- and she raises the letter opener slowly very high
above her head, the point aimed at his heart --
-- and Richmond screams one time --
-- and as Christy starts to kill him, two well-dressed
men in business suits burst through the bedroom doorway,
GUNS in their hands, and they BLOW HER BRAINS OUT before
the opener reaches Richmond's heart...
65
65
Luther, in SLOW MOTION and this is what he does --
-- he reels back in the chair, eyes wide, jaw slack,
mouth open --
-- this is a man who has seen everything but nothing has
prepared him for this --
-- his arms flop over the arms of the chair, his body
loses strength, he tries to look away, can't --
-- and this is what he sees --
66
66
Christy, fighting for another instant of life --
-- no chance --
-- the two bullets have shattered her brain, her eyes
roll up into her head, the letter opener drops to the
rug, she collapses like a rag doll --
-- and blood is everywhere.
67
67
Luther. Back in regular motion now.
Pale, barely able
to breathe.
68
68
The two well-dressed men in business suits.
BILL BURTON is the more formidable. Mid-40s, he looks
like a retired tight end. No body fat. Intimidating.
But right now he is shaking and he can't stop it. He
puts his gun away, goes to Richmond.
(CONTINUED)
19.
68
CONTINUED:
68
TIM COLLIN is closing in on 30. Handsome. In wonderful
shape. Burton is more physical, Collin more lethal. He
puts his gun away, goes to Christy.
Richmond is trying to sit. He is as drunk as before but
now he is also close to shock. He reaches over, manages
to pick up the bloody letter opener.
RICHMOND
Kill her?
Collin, by the body, nods.
BURTON
No choice in the matter.
His words are efficient but clearly, he has been rocked.
Richmond, staring stupidly at the letter opener. He
drops it back to the floor, tries to stand, can't.
Burton helps him back to the bed. Which is when he
passes out cold.
Burton and Collin look at each other now.
BURTON
Jesus, Tim, what did we do?
COLLIN
(echoing Burton)
No choice in the matter.
69
69
Luther, staring at it all. The shock is still there but
so is something new: anger. And on that --
70
70
GLORIA RUSSELL moving through the bedroom door.
Russell's 40, well-dressed, attractive and very smart.
Now she sees what's happened, stops dead.
Now she moves forward, looks at Burton and Collin.

very clear from the outset: these three are not
friendly.

He is strong enough to snap her neck with one hand.

Probably not a good idea.

Okay -- here's what happened

End of discussion.
73
73
A clock on the side table beside the three clickers.
There is the sound of a VACUUM -- it's later now.
The place is incredibly changed. Christy is lying as
before -- except now she is fully dressed. The bed has
been made with clean sheets. There is a large black
garbage bag that Collin shoves the sheets in, dumps in
Christy's jewelry. Burton is VACUUMING the rug.
Richmond is visible, still in terrible shape, finishing
putting his clothes on in the open master bedroom.
Everyone wears gloves.
Everything that is incriminating is gone --

it in along with the sheets and the jewelry.
RUSSELL
I'll take that.
COLLIN
(surprised)
It's got their prints on it.
RUSSELL
(she holds out her
hand)
Thanks for sharing.
Collin glances at Burton, shrugs, hands it over. Russell
puts it in her handbag, puts the handbag on the bed table
when suddenly --
Richmond, careening into the room, wide-eyed, crying
out --
RICHMOND
Gloria -- I killed her --
Russell, turning, shocked as Richmond bears down --
-- she holds out her arms for him, but he is staggering
and he collides hard with her, spins against the wall,
uses the bed table to try to steady himself.

What he's staring at: the letter opener has spilled from
her open purse and fallen behind the bed, out of sight.
Russell, calm, going to Richmond, starting to lead him
from the room --

Burton and Collin finish up -- Collin grabs the large
plastic bag. Burton glances around one final time and
backs toward the door, vacuuming carefully. Then --
Collin stops dead.
He stares across at the bed table.

Luther, holding his breath.
77
COLLIN
Shit.
BURTON
What?
In reply, Collin dashes back toward the bed table, grabs
Russell's purse, snaps it shut, tucks it under one arm
and leaves.
Burton flicks the light out, closes the door.
The room is lit by moonlight now. Christy looks
beautiful and still. HOLD for a moment.

The sound is barely audible.
He has been looking at his
watch --

The watch face is illuminated in the darkness. The
second hand is fifteen seconds away from the top.
Luther takes a deep breath, waits in silence.
The WATCH face:
the sound is loud, like "60 Minutes."

81
The second hand on Luther's watch hits the top and he
moves into action.
-- He points the clicker at the door --
-- the door starts to swing open --
-- Luther, backpack in hand, strides quickly into the
bedroom, turns, points the clicker again and as the door
starts to swing shut -- Luther carefully tosses the
clicker back inside.

Luther, in the bedroom, moving to the nightstand,

the table, reaches farther and then -- the letter opener!
In the plastic bag. Luther grabs it.
He rises, opener in hand, and goes to the far window that
has a view of the front of the house. He looks out,
grimaces.
84
85
Luther, going to the rear window. He opens the window
slowly and silently. He ties one end of the rope around
the leg of a heavy, wooden chest of drawers --
-- now he carefully plays the knotted rope out the
window.

Luther, putting his backpack on securely.

backpack makes it complicated and he's caught for a
moment, clumsily trapped with one leg in, one leg out and
the backpack wedged against the corner of the window --
-- and at that moment, there is a SCREAM.

Oh boy...
Burton and Collin with a crowbar, working at the mirror.
The MIRROR; there is a TEAR and a POP and it swings open.

The saddest eyes you ever saw.
It's the next morning and Luther is back at the same old
stand, looking at El Greco. The other art students are
there too. So are the suburban housewives.
Everything is as it was -- calm and peaceful --
-- now a museum guard moves into the doorway, scanning
the room.
Luther -- a quick glance over, then back to his
sketchbook -- and from that glance it's clear all is not
calm and peaceful.
The guard checks the room again.
Edgy, Luther still works away.
The guard leaves.
Luther gets set to do the same.

Red, alone in his empty bar, sipping coffee.
It's before

SETH FRANK moves into the room -- Bogart at 40. Chief
Homicide Detective of Middleton County, Virginia but he
had a decade of top work in New York City. Bright,
funny, and tough enough for anything you want to throw at
him.
He kneels beside the body next to an older man. This is
the MEDICAL EXAMINER, fat and bored. Seth studies
Christy; sadly shakes his head.
SETH
Christy Sullivan?
MEDICAL EXAMINER
(nods)
Wife of Walter -- most likely came
home and stumbled onto a
burglary --
WOMAN (O.S.)
-- some burglary.
LAURA SIMON. Laura is early 30s, and the best lab
technician Seth has ever known, and he knew some good
ones in New York.
LAURA SIMON
I wish my carpets were this clean.
And I can't find a single decent

fingerprint.
SETH
You serious, Laura?
LAURA SIMON

It's like Mary Poppins was here.

all the blood patterns indicate
that. But she was looking toward
the bed -- what in hell was she
looking at?

Seth says nothing as he and Laura go in the vault.
Seth
stares at the chair.
LAURA SIMON
Looks like someone sat here -- but
I couldn't find any prints.
(lowering her voice --
indicating the one-way
mirror)
You think Sullivan holed up in the
chair and watched his wife
perform?
SETH
I hope not --

-- he's such a great man.
He moves back into the bedroom.

Another cop is working on the wall by the bed table where
a hole the size and shape of a bullet is visible.

LAURA SIMON
Maybe he couldn't remember if he

A strong burglar with a weak mind

The salesman is opening a mail slot with the name
"Hawthorne" on the outside. A good bit of mail, most of
it unsolicited. Hawthorne pockets it, unlocks the foyer,
heads toward the elevator.

The elevator and Hawthorne slowly getting out, heading
toward a corner apartment, taking out some keys --
-- there are three locks on the door... he takes out
keys --

Hawthorne walks in, puts the suitcases down, flings his
hat toward a long sofa --
-- it's Luther and this, we will come to learn, is what
he keeps as his safe house. It's neatly furnished,
modern and clean.
Now he moves quickly --
-- first he opens a suitcase -- it contains his full
backpack from the robbery --
-- then he opens a locked closet door, revealing a very
large and sophisticated safe. As he begins to work the
dial --
143
143
-- the TV ON in the living room as he slides the video
cassette Red gave him into his machine. Everything has
been put away.
The TV as Michael Jordan is introduced to the crowd --
Luther sits, nurses a beer, watches intently...
144
144
An old man silently weeping.
This is WALTER SULLIVAN, one of the giants of the era.
A
self-made billionaire. Remarkably, the man has few
enemies.
At 80, his body may be betraying him -- he was once
handsome -- but his mind is that of a young man.
We've seen him before -- in the wedding picture on the
wall of his mansion. With his young bride Christy.
He is with her again now, at the morgue. A sheet covers
her body. The toe tag is visible. Walter, shattered and
desolate, stares at her once joyous face.
PULL BACK to reveal --

Seth Frank, studying Walter THROUGH a two way mirror.
Seth is moved at depth of the old man's grief. Anyone

SANDY LORD waiting in an anteroom as Walter enters...
Sandy Lord is Walter Sullivan's lawyer.
He is 60,
abrasive, powerful.
Sandy moves to Walter, gestures toward the front door.
Seth appears through another door, intercepts them.
SETH
Mr. Sullivan? -- I'm Seth Frank,
senior homicide detective for
Middleton County --
SANDY LORD

conversation, sir.
WALTER SULLIVAN
It's all right, Sandy --

-- you're in charge of the case?
SETH

I have to ask some questions, but
it can be tomorrow.
WALTER SULLIVAN
You want what, positive
identification? Yes, that was my
wife. Anything else?
SETH

You'd been in Barbados for two
days?

rich and the famous. But the only one we
recognize is Sandy Lord, deep in conversation with
several other men. Now, someone says his name.
MAN (O.S.)
Sandy.
(as Sandy turns)
Is there anything I can do?
SANDY LORD
Mr. President.
And on those words -- The 44th President of the United
States. He has all the natural charm in the world. He
is remarkably bright, with a phenomenal memory. He is,
also, at this moment, one of the most popular men in
American history, three years into a brilliant first
term, a shoo-in for re-election when that ritual comes.
His name, by the way, is Alan Richmond, and we've seen
him before, most recently lying drunk in the back seat of
a dark Towncar.
RICHMOND
Take a walk with me.
He and Sandy start out of the room. A well-dressed woman
moves with them. She is Chief of Staff and her name is
GLORIA RUSSELL.
Two men in suits follow behind. Burton and Collin are
their names and they are the best the Secret Service has
to offer.

No one understands how I feel --
I'm supposed to have all this

Part of the job.
Seth and Laura.
Seth's lost his train of thought.
Then --
SETH
Oh yeah
-- remember that bullet
hole in
the wall? Had the lab dig
out the
slug -- guess what -- no
slug --
why does the burglar take
the time
to do that?

Oh I like that a lot -- two
different guns means two different
burglars. Two guys broke in? And
they both went out the window?
Bullshit.

And oh, by the way, why does he --

the first place when he -- or they

A Bill Burton of the Secret

Quietly elegant. Two men are finishing dinner.
Walter
Sullivan we know.
MICHAEL McCARTY, his dinner companion, is 35, fit,
handsome, beautifully dressed. He is, at present, torn
by a silver tray of small French pastries.
WALTER SULLIVAN
(noting McCarty's
temptation)
The chef makes them especially for
me -- I promise you they're
sinful.
McCarty grabs one, downs it, grins sheepishly.
McCARTY
You're a salesman, Mr. Sullivan.
Sullivan nods as they rise.
162

Tastefully appointed, as one would expect.
WALTER SULLIVAN
This is a new arena for me, but
from what I'm told, you have a
flawless reputation, Mister
McCarty -- which is why I need to
employ you.
McCARTY
Understood.
WALTER SULLIVAN
I have no idea who I'm after.
Until I do, you will have to wait
in Washington for instructions.

McCARTY
Out of the question, I'm afraid.
(explaining as they
walk)
Mine isn't particularly creative
work -- I only do it because I
enjoy living beyond my means. I
can't afford to just sit around.
A sofa.
Walter gestures for them to sit.
WALTER SULLIVAN
When I was 10 my father died -- he
was a miner and lung disease
killed him. I became rich at 25
and the first thing I did was
purchase that mine, close it, and
give every miner there fifty
thousand dollars to retire on.
(beat; staring at
McCarty now)
You will come to Washington, Mr.
McCarty. You will put one million
dollars expenses into the Swiss
*
bank account of your choosing.
(beat)
And, when the time comes, two
million dollars a bullet.
McCARTY
(smiles, nods)
You are a salesman, sir.

Luther Whitney --

Seth.
The words pour out.
SETH
Been going nuts with this thing,
up all night and I remembered your
notion how it might be two
burglars, and around dawn I
thought, wait, what if it wasn't
two burglars but what if it was
one guy trying to throw us off by
making it look like two?
(faster)
Called a buddy at the Bureau --
they keep track of this stuff
internationally -- he says maybe
only a half a dozen guys alive
could have pulled off the Sullivan
job -- I'm tracing all six --
(beat)
-- but Whitney's the only one
lives in Washington.
Laura.
Looking at Seth now.
Starting to get excited,
too.
LAURA
Why haven't I ever heard of him?
SETH
Because he hasn't been arrested in
thirty years.
LAURA
(indicating mug shot)
This his graduation picture from
Harvard?
SETH
(waving her off)
Ancient history -- he wasn't a
jewel thief back then. Just a
kid, just part of a gang, a three-

the last time, he's only worked
alone --

Not just a veteran -- a wounded

El Greco. The usual group has gathered, sketching away.
Luther is deeply engrossed in his labors.
Seth enters the room, casually taking it all in. He
approaches the group, ends up behind Luther who is intent
on getting the hands right.
LUTHER
(not looking)
Boy, you must be smart.
SETH
(really taken aback)
Sorry?
LUTHER
Usually takes a week for you guys
to get to me.
(turns, smiles)
You look just like your picture,
Seth. I'm Luther Whitney.
He reaches out to shake a surprised Seth's hand --
168
168
They walk in, go to
the food line. There is, throughout,
a bantering tone.
Not that it matters, but these two, in
a different world,
would like each other -- they're both,
in their own ways,
deeply moral men.
LUTHER
So, do you want my confession now
or after coffee?
As Luther draws some coffee from an urn --
SETH
(doing the same)
Before I send you away for life, I
should probably check out your
alibi.

LUTHER
Watched the Bullets game
with Red
Bransford. Prison buddy
of mine

question
me about the game? I'm
probably
lying.
They each give the cashier some money and we see a quiet
table in the corner as they head for it.
SETH
You been following the case?
LUTHER
(nods vigorously)
I love true crime --
SETH
-- F.B.I. feels only a few guys
could have handled something as
hard as the Sullivan job.
(touches his notebook)
I've got a list here; you're on
it.
LUTHER
(nothing shows)
I wish it was true.
(shakes his head)
Your robber actually went in the
front door but came out down a
rope in the dark in the middle of
the night?
(as Seth nods;
Luther sighs)
If only I could do stuff like that
-- I'd be the star of my A.A.R.P.
meetings.
Luther and Seth as they sit.
Seth smiles, looks at
Luther.
SETH

Luther? Why was this so hard?
Luther.
Now he's surprised.
He kind of smiles.

case?

Just looking

of person do
you think I should be
looking for?
LUTHER
(like a shot)
Older fella. Like me.
SETH
(now he smiles)
Because?
LUTHER
Need patience. The secret is just
research, research, research --
from everything I've read.
Seth. This hasn't gone at all the way he thought -- and
he's starting to get fascinated.
SETH
Research for what?
LUTHER
Well, from what I can tell on the
tube, it's not a small house.
(as Seth nods)
There had to be an architect,
right? You'd be able to tell
which one from public records in
the library. And once you know
the office, you could break in and
find the plans and Xerox them, get
them back before morning.
SETH
Not just steal them?
LUTHER
Seth -- breaking in isn't hard --
what's hard is breaking in so no
one knows you've been there. Now,
after the architect, next you'd
want the contractor's office --
and the security company's office.
(beat)
You know the skill involved
breaking the security of a
security company?

Well, I'm guessing there was
probably some secret way to open
it --
SETH
(casually)

LUTHER

SETH
-- gizmo -- looked like a V.C.R.

LUTHER

inside.
SETH
(sipping casually;
a pause)
Five million.
And on those words --
Luther, more than he thought, a lot more -- but of course
nothing shows -- instead he breaks out laughing.
SETH
Why's that funny?
LUTHER
The way you said it -- as if you
were trying to surprise me.
SETH

I was trying to surprise you.
LUTHER

Seth sips his coffee, takes out his notebook, opens it.
SETH
Would the burglar use a disguise?
LUTHER
Seth, you've got to get with the
program you expect to catch this
guy -- most likely it is a guy, am
I right? Some kind of weird
loner?
SETH
Maybe like you.
LUTHER
(couldn't agree more)
I'm the perfect prototype.
(sipping away)
But you see any face often enough,
you'll start putting things
together. That's why these top
guys disguise themselves. I read
a great article a couple of years
back -- damn, I wish I could
remember where -- anyway, it was
about these makeup experts some of
them use -- wigmakers, people like
that.
SETH
(flipping a page)
Go on about the wigmakers.
LUTHER
(glancing at his watch)
I'd love that but I'm late as it
is -- got to get my pacemaker
checked.
(he likes Seth)
-- all this excitement, you
understand.
SETH
(and he likes Luther)
A) You don't have a pacemaker, and
B) I'll be back tomorrow.
LUTHER
Tomorrow is promised to no one.
HOLD ON Luther.

Luther is throwing clothes into a suitcase while talking
on the phone --

Not 'til morning?

He hangs up, shuts the suitcase, takes off out the
door --
170
170
A place we've seen briefly before.
Dark.
Moonlight
through the windows.
The sound of a KEY IN the DOOR.
Luther enters, takes out a tiny flashlight. We're in one
largish room, books all over. The home of someone who
doesn't care a whole lot about their home.
171
171
Luther enters. He opens the fridge. Disaster -- still
water, sparkling water, carrot sticks.
LUTHER
(sadly, muttering)
Katie darling, you've gotta try
real food sometime.
He closes the door, moves back into the room --
172

A graduation photo of Kate. Luther touches it with a
fingertip, moves on through the silence.

Luther by the bed now, he flashes his light around --
-- what the light illuminates: a bed table full of law
books. Expected. A phone/answering machine. The
mandatory lamp.
And photographs. A proud mother and daughter picture.
The daughter is Kate. The mother is a fine-looking woman
with a kind face.

The same shot -- only now it's grainy -- we're watching
it on a TV SCREEN. CNN ON the TUBE.
A BARTENDER cleaning glasses; otherwise, not a whole lot
going on.
Now Luther enters, dressed for travel. He goes to a
stool, orders a ginger ale, puts his passport and ticket
on the bar, glances toward the TV.
LUTHER
Turn that off, okay?

glasses)

Luther, staring at the image of Walter Sullivan, who is
heartsick and beaten. Luther is simply transfixed --
-- Richmond on CNN and now he has turned and is beckoning
for Walter Sullivan to join him.
Sullivan for a moment is uncertain. He points to himself
-- "do you mean me?" Richmond nods, opens his arms out
wide. Sullivan gets up, comes forward.
Luther, as he gets up too, also comes forward, leaving
the stool, walking close to the television.
Richmond and Sullivan, grainy on CNN as Richmond embraces
Sullivan, holds him in a loving embrace.
RICHMOND (V.O.)
Dear friend, old friend, we shall
fight that battle.
Sullivan, too overcome by the moment, can only nod.
RICHMOND (V.O.)
Who can explain the ways of
chance? If we had never met, I
would not be President. If
Christine had not taken ill, she
would be with you in Barbados

Tears of rage in his eyes.
A rage so deep it shocks
him --
LUTHER
You -- heartless -- prick --

The Bartender, surprised, turning toward Luther. He
starts to say something, stops; something tells him to
shut up and he does.
180
181
Luther, wiping away tears, in the bar.
A SHOT of the two of them, Luther and Richmond, one on
CNN, one in reality, because Luther has moved so close to
the TV he and Richmond could almost be staring at each
other.

I'm not running -- not from you.

The guide leads the people through. They look around,
chat with their friends, follow the guide out.
Luther follows the guide out too.
HOLD ON the room.
All is as it was.
Except a large envelope has been dropped on a side table.
MOVE IN ON the envelope --
-- it's addressed to Gloria Russell.

Gloria Russell.
Terrified.
Her doors are closed, Russell is at her desk. Burton
stands alongside. Collin, silent, sits in a corner.
And on her desk, half out of the envelope, is a photo-
graph of the letter opener.
RUSSELL
He was in the building -- he took
a guided tour.
Burton pulls the picture all the way out, studies it.

Collin laughs.
RUSSELL
You finished your recruiting
speech? Because I'd like to know
how I handle this.
BURTON
Like you handled the letter
opener?
Russell.
She studies Burton.
Then --
RUSSELL
Gee, Bill, that could be construed
as criticism. Do you really want
me as an enemy?
Burton stands there, massively powerful. His voice, when
he speaks, is his usual voice: polite, considerate.
BURTON
Miss Russell, I should have called
the police that night. But I was
weak. You convinced me to stay
silent. I regret that.

She is, we will find, a top prosecutor for the Common-
wealth of Virginia. Her office is a zoo.
On her desk, a baby picture of Kate and her mom smiling
-- but there is something a little different about it.
Seth enters and they shake.
He glances around --
-- sees the photograph, glances away.
Kate has risen now -- and in the silence it's clear that
even though they are both standing still, they are both
circling.

Couple days ago. He said he might
be going away. There. I just

her mom.
We are looking at a shrine!
And there are newer photos too -- Kate at her college
graduation, Kate at her law school graduation, Kate and
her mother coming out of an elegant restaurant, Kate
alone on the steps of Middleton County Courthouse --

An open-air place near my office,
the Cafe Alonzo --
Seth's excited.
193
193
*
LATE AFTERNOON
taking it down.
KATE (V.O.)
Four o'clock -- it's deserted then.
Burton's excited too.
HOLD.
194
195
Wired. Pacing across her small apartment, back and
forth, back and forth.
196
196
alone in his office, going over plans, sipping coffee to
stay awake.
197
197
alone in his bed, staring at the ceiling, a nearly empty
Scotch bottle in one hand.
198

198
199
199
listening to the PHONE MACHINE. We hear KATE'S VOICE.
"Daddy... I miss you... I'm worried... call me..."
A CLICK. Luther hangs up, immediately dials again. We
hear the message start over. "Daddy... I miss you..." As
he continues to listen --
80.
200
207
Luther and a SALESMAN are engaged in conversation.
Luther is buttoning a new raincoat to the throat. The
Salesman holds several hats. Luther picks one, tries it
on.
LUTHER
I need to look really good today.
He doesn't like the hat.
SALESMAN
Business?
(as Luther tries
the other hat --
very rakish, he
likes it)
It's a woman, I can tell.
(as Luther nods)
Never too late, is it?
Luther.
Beaming.
LUTHER
You got that right.
Now, from his happy face --
208
210
Inside the window. Michael McCarty, who we last met at
*
Walter Sullivan's, is there. He looks out.
*
211
HIS POV
211
The glass building and the struggling workmen and, on the
ground floor, a few tables are set outside, with large
umbrellas alongside each.
There is a sign:
CAFE ALONZO.
212
212
McCarty.
Beside him is a leather case.
He opens it.
The case. A very high-powered rifle. McCarty begins to
expertly assemble it, taut and businesslike.
213
213
Seth, taut and businesslike, stands by a
blown-up map of
the Cafe Alonzo area. The restaurant is
circled -- and
around it are marked places for policemen
to wait -- Seth
is giving instructions to those policemen
now --
-- fifty of them.
And no one's smiling.
214
214
Kate. Dressed and ready. Lying on her bed. Afternoon
now. She gets up, makes it halfway to the front door --
-- can't do it -- she turns, goes back to bed, lies down
again, frozen.
215
222
McCarty, staring out the window of the brownstone, the
rifle pointed -- very relaxed, he pulls the trigger --
the RIFLE'S not loaded yet -- and the STACCATO "CLICK" is
all we hear.
223
223
Seth and Burton moving quickly into the lobby of the
glass office building that adjoins the Cafe Alonzo -- the
lobby has a clear view of the outdoor part of the cafe.
Around and behind them, dozens of cops get in position.
224
226
Seth and Burton. They've both seen a lot -- which
doesn't mean they're not tense. Burton takes out some
Tums, offers them to Seth. Seth shakes his head, brings
out Tums of his own.
CUT TO:
227
SUN
227
Starting down.
228
232
McCarty as before, with his weapon. He pulls the trigger
again and again, there is the "CLICK" -- now he flicks
away a grain of dust from the barrel --
-- then he puts the weapon down, reaches out and --
ONE BULLET. It's supersonic ammo. McCarty picks it up,
blows on it gently. He might be holding a child.
233
233
Burton and Seth.
They can see Kate sitting alone in the
late afternoon.
SETH
(mutters)
Fuck...
-- And a goddamn WAITER has appeared and is walking out
toward Kate. He is Asian and very young.
234
235
Seth and Burton.
Stunned.
SETH
This is not part of my brilliant
master plan.
More Tums.
BURTON
Unfuckingbelievable.
They both crunch away.
236
236
McCarty, watching the Waiter and Kate. He's not happy
either. He points a finger at the Waiter, goes "Boom."
237
239
DAY
Collin. He holds a very high-powered weapon. It looks
like it could kill from a thousand yards away.
Where he is -- and it's not a thousand yards away -- he's
in an unmarked van on the street, even closer than
McCarty.
Collin, loading his weapon.
His movements are skilled.
His concentration is total.
240
DAY
240
McCarty, glancing out at the office building area. The
three workmen on the scaffolding are fighting to right
the glass panel. One of them grabs a rope connected to a
block and tackle.
He pulls on the rope.
Slowly, the piece begins to rise.
241
242
Seth and Burton.
The waiting is agony.
88.
243
244
McCarty.
All the time in the world.
245
245
Collin.
Blows on his weapon slightly.
246
247
McCarty in the window.
Spotting Luther --
-- totally controlled.
248
248
Collin does the same.
249
249
Seth and Burton, and the instant Luther is visible, Seth
gestures toward the policemen: Get ready.
250

raising his rifle.

251

Collin, raising his.
252
254
McCarty, flipping off the safety.
255
255
Collin, doing the same.
256
257
Seth, right hand raised -- he's about to start it all in
motion.
258

McCarty, his finger floating to the trigger.
259
259
Collin, doing the same.
90.
260
262
-- McCarty, blinded as the red reflection hits his eyes
but he FIRES.
263
264
Collin, startled, and he FIRES too.
265
266
Seth, stunned, because this is crazy and Burton, stunned,
eyes wide.

instructions, racing with Burton out of the building --

A tall uniformed police lieutenant, entering Cafe
Alonzo --
-- he passes a couple of guys in chef's hats and the
Chinese waiter who just gapes out toward what was his
service area --
-- the tall uniformed police lieutenant moves gracefully
past --
-- it's Luther.
He goes to the front door of the place, glances back
toward where the NOISE is still mounting -- shakes his
head -- out the door and gone!
277
277
The door to Kate's apartment opening and Seth coming in
with Kate. Evening. Kate is as drained as you'd expect.
KATE
(glancing around)
Messy.

She doesn't smile.

KATE
I just need some sleep.
SETH
I've got surveillance outside.
And I'm keeping it on 'til this is
over. I've got a feeling he's
going to try and contact you.
KATE
You're on a hot streak, I guess.
SETH
Listen, I'm sorry.
Kate.
Nothing to say.
SETH
Anything unusual, call me right
away -- not a bother, I live
alone.
KATE
You said.

Feeble, huh?
She nods.
They look at each other.
Then he starts toward

help it, breaks out
laughing)
What's funny, I say it wrong?
KATE
Tired is all.
As she hands him a bottle.

as they move toward it.
He opens it.
SETH
I don't think I've told you this,
but I live alone.
(and this time, as she
does smile, and he
does go)
Lock it behind me.
KATE
(LOCKING it loudly)
How's that?
SETH (O.S.)
Real good.
Try and sleep.
His FOOTSTEPS get softer, DISAPPEAR.
KATE
(still facing door,
her back to her
apartment)
I betrayed you, Luther. You
better know that now.
LUTHER (O.S.)
You're not the first.
As Kate turns, Luther, standing there, is looking at her.

Why'd you come?

prepared.
LUTHER
(simply)
My daughter wanted to see me.
He points to the couch -- as Kate sits.
Luther, and
before she's even seated, he's into it.
LUTHER
The robbery went fine 'til they
came in. They were drunk. I hid
in the vault. Sex got rough. He
was going to kill Christy, but she
turned the tables, was going to
kill him. Two guys came in, shot
her dead.
KATE
The same two guys who tried for
you this afternoon?
LUTHER
Probably only one of them. I
think Walter Sullivan might have
hired the other.
KATE
Pretty powerful enemy; good going.
LUTHER
Not as powerful as the President
of the United States.
Kate just looks at him.
Dead silence.
LUTHER
Richmond was drunk. The two guys
are Secret Service. Chief of
Staff Russell planned the coverup.

about that.
Everything he's told her, all true.
The air goes out of her.

Luther crosses to the door, turns.
LUTHER
This is probably it; you

looks at her. Then -- )
I was never going to tell you

The envelope being opened. It's early evening now.
The
message inside is short and clear --
"Gloria,
Thanks for the rescue.

Russell smiles, and as she opens the package --
282
282
A beautiful necklace. Antique mostly likely. And
tasteful -- we hear the sound of an ORCHESTRA PLAYING
WALTZES.
PULL BACK to reveal Gloria Russell, looking just
splendid, the necklace around her throat, entering a
large and very impressive White House dinner-dance.
Clearly an important affair of state.
We've never seen Russell quite
like this -- relaxed,
secure in her femininity. She
nods distantly to Burton
and Collin who are, as always,
close the President. For
the first time now, we realize
something: Gloria Russell
is hot for Alan Richmond.
Richmond, on the edge of the dance floor, chatting with
some elderly couples, several of them European, all of
them wealthy.

Excuse me, all -- I am overcome

A hand to her -- Russell, beaming, moves out onto the
dance floor with him.
Everyone at the gathering, watching them.
Richmond and Russell, very much aware that all eyes are
on them --
-- what we don't know is this: they are both wonderful
dancers. And they seem to be reveling in their moves --

They do a perfect dip.
RUSSELL
What, Alan?

Christy Sullivan wore it the night

The crowd of elegant men and women, it's really wonderful
dancing they're seeing -- they start to applaud.
Richmond and Russell, hearing the sound. Richmond
acknowledges it with a smile as they come to climax.

Well, now --

-- I need time to think -- come
see me in my office in the
morning --

This will certainly make for an
interesting chapter in my memoirs.
And as they bow...
The crowd applauding louder, while on the dance floor,
the President of the United States and the Chief of Staff
applaud happily back. As the sound builds --
283
284
Luther, slipping inside. Some stairs are just across.
He goes down them, opens the door --
285
285
Luther stepping into the main part of the dark house. He
stops. No noise at all except that of someone BREATHING
DEEPLY, coming from an open bedroom door.
Luther passes by -- for an instant we can see that Burton
is asleep, an empty bottle by his head.
286
286
Luther rounding a corner --
-- and we can tell immediately he's in a different house
now. Burton's had only old furnishings, these are modern
and new.
Luther pauses, listening.
Nothing.
He moves forward then, turns another corner --
287
287
-- and now we can tell he's someplace else -- this is an
apartment with a large window looking out on the city.
Luther doesn't stop to admire the view.
He moves
silently on...
HOLD ON the window.
And suddenly:
Dawn -- the sun is starting to rise.
PULL BACK to reveal --
288
288
Gloria Russell, as the ALARM GOES OFF.
She sits --
-- she stretches --
-- then she stares -- something has been taped to her
lamp. We are looking at an issue of the Washington Post
-- Russell's photo smiles out -- there is a headline that
says simply: RUSSELL TO BE CHIEF OF STAFF.
Written across her picture are the words: "This
shitstorm is your fault -- if we go down, you go down!"
Russell takes the paper down, stares at it. Furious.
104.
289
289
Burton, hung over, staggering into the kitchen of his
home, stopping dead. A newspaper is set beside his
coffee pot.
A front page of the Washington Post. Years back. The
lead article reports that a siege has been successfully
broken --
-- Burton, bloody and wounded, is being carried to an
ambulance. A hero. Across the top these words have been
written:
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN, YOU GUTLESS FUCK?
Burton stares.
Steaming.
290
290
Collin, yawning, going into his bathroom --
-- across his mirror is taped a large white piece of
paper, across which is written in thick black marker --
"If you could shoot for shit, we'd be out of this."
Collin angrily rips it down.

Still early morning -- Collin is going through Burton's
desk hurriedly --
-- when Burton surprises him --

And on that --

The note that was sent to Russell and the Polaroid of the
letter opener.
PULL BACK to reveal --
The Polaroid and the note are on Richmond's desk. He
studies them. Russell, Burton and Collin stand silently
watching him, their hatred of each other clear.

a bunch of equipment --

breathing and it's steady. She's alone for the moment in
the semi-darkened room.
322

Empty.
A doctor comes walking along -- it's Collin.

Kate in her room, sleeping.
Another doctor is with her
now, checking her charts.
324

Collin. He sees what's going on, stops, pulls out a
small notebook, pretends to read it, all the while
glancing toward Kate's room with the one doctor still
there --
-- now from around the corner, NOISE, COMING CLOSER --
SEVERAL PEOPLE APPROACHING, perhaps more.
Collin turns away from the sound, curses, then stops --
-- The doctor is done with Kate's charts.
From around the corner now, the group coming closer
still.
Kate's doorway as the doctor exits and Collin enters --
they pass each other --
325

Kate is barely breathing.

And now suddenly Collin is barely breathing --

Collin's neck, forcing the air out of him.
Collin, stunned, trying to struggle --
The doctor jerking Collin's body into the air -- his feet
are dangling now -- the hypodermic needle drops to the
bed as the struggle goes on --
-- and Collin's in fabulous shape. He's young and power-
ful and he's been in terrible situations before and he
knows how to fight and he's been taught to defend himself
and --
-- tough shit --
-- the doctor -- it's Luther -- relentlessly increases
the pressure against Collin's throat --

-- his eyes start to slide up into his head --
-- silence in the room --
-- it's almost over --

Collin, eyes flickering open as Luther lays him down on
the floor. All this next is whispered.
LUTHER
Scream. Go on. Which do you want
most, for me to kill you or life
in jail forever?
He has gone across the room to the bed.
Collin tries to
move, can't.
The hypodermic needle as Luther picks it up carefully,
starts back to Collin.

... why do you think that...?
COLLIN
... you could have but you
didn't...
Luther.
Kneeling by Collin now.
LUTHER
That's because you didn't know
your crime, prick.
-- and now he jams the needle against Collin's neck.
*
Collin tries to cry out, but Luther covers his mouth.
LUTHER
(kneeling close, almost
whispering into Collin's
ear)
I didn't mind you tried to shoot
me at the restaurant -- I wouldn't
have minded if you'd nailed me at
Sullivan's -- part of the job --
(beat)
-- but you fucked with blood.
Collin.
Terrified.
*
COLLIN
... mercy...
Luther, bending over him.
Luther pushes the plunger.
*
LUTHER
I'm fresh out.
Collin dying now. His breathing is getting strange, his
*
body starting to stiffen. And on that --
*
KATE (O.S.)
... Daddy...?
Kate, eyes barely open. From her position Luther is
simply kneeling, nothing else is visible...
LUTHER
... go to sleep, honey...

She tries to stay awake, can't make it, drifts off.

She closes her eyes.
Collin.
Luther closes his eyes for him.
Now --

A gurney with a figure on it being pushed by a doctor.

328
Seth coming out of the shower. He puts a towel around
him, wipes the steam off the mirror, cries out --
-- Luther is standing there.
LUTHER
I need one answer -- when you
interviewed Walter Sullivan, did
he say why Christy didn't go to
Barbados?
SETH
(shakes his head)
Just that she changed her mind.
(studying Luther)
You know who did it, don't you?
LUTHER
So will you -- check your
phones --
SETH
(incredulous)
-- who'd tap a police officer?
No reply -- Luther's already headed for the door as we --

Walter huddled in the back seat, as the street lights
illuminate him. He might even be ill. In any case, a
sad figure.
331
332
Walter.
Blinking.
WALTER SULLIVAN
Is this a shortcut, Tommy?
*
CHAUFFEUR
(turns; it's Luther)
I'm your replacement driver for
the evening, sir. Don't worry,
Tommy's fine.

WALTER SULLIVAN
Very unusual -- what do I call
you?
LUTHER
Luther, sir.
WALTER SULLIVAN
And are you familiar with how to
get to my home, Luther?
LUTHER
I know the way, sir -- I'm the man
who robbed you --
Sullivan says nothing; stares unsmiling.
LUTHER
-- and you're the man who tried to
have me killed --

WALTER SULLIVAN
-- I'm sorry I missed -- I believe
in the Old Testament, sir -- there
is nothing wrong with an eye for
an eye when a terrible deed has
been done.
(ice)
A deed such as yours.
LUTHER
You want to believe that, don't
you? -- Makes your life a lot
simpler if you believe that, isn't
that right?
(big now)
What do you think I gain being
here?
Sullivan.
Contempt.
WALTER SULLIVAN
Have no idea -- you going to rob
me again? --
LUTHER
I don't need your money, Mr.
Sullivan. Look in your vault
lately?
WALTER SULLIVAN
(he has)
I'm afraid we're a little late for
an attempt at leniency.
333
334
LUTHER
Shit's coming down tonight, Mr.
Sullivan, do you want to be a
player or not?
(bigger)
Do you want to know what happened,
or not? I saw. Your call.
WALTER SULLIVAN
(beat)
I want to know.

LUTHER
Are you up to hearing about it? --
Do you want to hear how he beat
the shit out of her and tried to
strangle her -- you have enough
left for that? --
WALTER SULLIVAN
(a nod)
-- I could walk through fire --
Luther, fast now.
LUTHER
I was in the chair when they came
in.
(as Sullivan says
nothing)
They were drunk -- at first he
only wanted to bruise her -- she
fought back, he went for the kill
-- she turned the tables. Then he
screamed for help.
Pause.
WALTER SULLIVAN
Who else was in my house?
LUTHER
Secret Service shot her.
WALTER SULLIVAN
(doesn't like it)
Nonsense.
LUTHER
Gloria Russell handled the cover
up.
WALTER SULLIVAN
Stop this --
LUTHER
-- don't you want to know who the
man was?
WALTER SULLIVAN
(desperate)
It was you.
LUTHER
We're too old to bullshit each
other, Mr. Sullivan.

LUTHER

You know!
Sullivan, shaking his head as Luther roars on.
LUTHER
You fucking well do, don't shake
your head at me -- when you're
alone at night, when the rage
takes you and you think of what
you'd do to revenge her, on those
nights you put a face to your
enemy.
WALTER SULLIVAN
(coming apart)
Stop the car --
LUTHER
-- we're going all the way,
Walter --
WALTER SULLIVAN
-- it's too terrible.
LUTHER
It sure is.
Walter Sullivan.
A long, shaky moment, then --
WALTER SULLIVAN
... I know about Alan's reputation
as a philanderer... but... he
would never dream of betraying
me... I gave him the Presidency.
Luther and Walter as Luther turns a sharp corner and the
WHEELS SCREAM --
LUTHER
(pressing it)
The press conference -- remember?
-- he held you in his arms and
said if only Christy hadn't gotten
sick she would have been with you

-- how do you think he knew she
was sick? You didn't tell
anybody. But he heard it, all
right. He heard it from her.
That night. And I heard every
word --
Walter. For a moment, no reaction. Then he sits back
hard. The air's out of him. He just breathes quietly.
Then --
WALTER SULLIVAN
That's not real proof.
Luther.
Handing something back.
LUTHER
And this?
Sullivan takes it --
-- it's the letter opener.
Sullivan leans back, shuts his eyes.
WALTER SULLIVAN
You could have stolen this.
LUTHER
I did steal it. But that isn't my
blood and those aren't my prints.
CLOSEUP ON SULLIVAN
*
Eyes still shut --
-- and he's very old and you expect tears --
-- but he didn't get to be Walter Sullivan by crying --
-- HOLD ON Walter --
-- and this incredible shriek of rage explodes! --
Luther, suddenly stopping the car --

Walter.
He sits in the back a moment.
Then he gets out.

Driving faster.

Walter Sullivan approaching a METAL DETECTOR -- he starts
to go through --

Walter's embarrassed.
He holds up his wrist, showing his
watch.
The security guards smile, wave him to go ahead.
Walter continues on.

The letter

The door opens.
Richmond, arms out, comes to embrace him, as he embraced
him at the Press Conference.

Luther enters. A number of people are present, all of
them listening to a large radio, on the desk of the
Information Clerk.
RADIO ANNOUNCER #2 (V.O.)

... Richmond died violently in the
Oval Office and Walter Sullivan...
Luther has moved past now; we can't hear the radio
anymore.

She dozes.
Luther sits alongside in a chair.
Outside, the moon is high in the sky.
Kate blinks, half opens her eyes, sees Luther.
KATE

LUTHER
Haven't budged.
She dozes again.

A coffee machine in a lounge.
Empty.
But a TELEVISION
SET IS PLAYING SOFTLY.
Luther enters, gets some coffee.
The TV is SHOWING the PRESS CONFERENCE Richmond held. As
we WATCH, Walter Sullivan moves down toward the President
and they embrace.

Now the Press Conference is over and we are LIVE AT the
FRONT OF the North Portico of the WHITE HOUSE. A ton of
reporters --

quiet.
REPORTER #1 (V.O.)
Mister Sullivan, have you no idea
why the President took his own
life?
Luther stops making coffee, looks at the screen.
WALTER SULLIVAN (V.O.)
(voice soft)
I know he's been feeling the
pressure of office more than ever
lately. We've talked about it a
great deal.
REPORTER #2 (V.O.)
But why would he stab himself?
WALTER SULLIVAN (V.O.)
(sadly)
That's a question that will haunt
me forever. Of course I tried to
stop him --

-- Alan was like a son to me...
Luther smiles, takes his coffee, leaves the room as we --

Kate sleeping. Seth stands there now. Luther enters
with his coffee. Seth sees him and they both move to the
door and confer silently --
-- Seth indicates Kate.
Luther crosses his fingers.
Seth says something we can't make out.
Luther nods.
Seth glances a final time at Kate, then leaves them.
Luther moves to Kate, studies her face.

He arranges her sheets.
