  Over the circus of high school STUDENTS arriving by bus, car, 
  bike and foot, WE HEAR SAMMY MEADE broadcast...

                              SAMMY MEADE (V.O.)
                ...and what a night-day 
                  doubleheader Dillon has this 
                weekend!  First, Friday Night, the 
                football Panthers look to sharpen 
                their claws against the hapless 
                Ramapo Rams - the worst team in the 
                  division.  

    A SKATEBOARDER ramps into the school entrance, down the 
  crowded hallway, whizzes by a teacher carrying coffee, races 
  the length of the hallway and out...

  THE BACK OF THE SCHOOL

  THE SKATEBOARDER rolls down a ramp, gathers momentum, then 
  LAUNCHES --

  CLOSE ON the skateboarder, AIRBORNE...  He lands 
    successfully.  He coasts toward...

  THE FOOTBALL FIELD

  The team is running a blocking drill: two lines, lead player 
  in each line faces off, driving into the other with all 
  they ve got at the whistle.  

                              SAMMY MEADE (V.O)
                I tell you, the only way the 
                Panthers lose this game is by 
                beating themselves.  But one 
                massacre won t be enough for 
                Dillon.  Not this weekend.  

  PULL FOCUS to CHEERLEADERS practicing on the sideline.  

                              SAMMY MEADE (V.O.) (CONT D)
                The Southwest Cheerleading 
                  Regionals start this Saturday, and 
                the young Panther Squad, led by 
                                (MORE)

                captain Lyla Garrity, is hunting 
                for victory.  Hell, these ladies 
                feel confident about winning.  And 
                let Sammy give y all a bit of 
                advice: don t bet against these 
                  Panthers,  cause these little 
                ladies are tough...

  Sammy s broadcast continues over...


  CLOSE ON JASON STREET, his blank expression similar to 
  Lyla s.  Sun shines on his face and wind whips through his 
  hair...




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                      4.

  REVEAL: a Cadillac racing across the Texas landscape.  
  There s a wheelchair strapped to the roof.

  ANGLE ON Jason, in the back.  Jason s hand is out the window, 
  buffeted by the wind.  CLOSE ON MITCHELL STREET S EYES, 
  watching from the rear view mirror.

                              MITCHELL STREET 
                Got a great deal customizing the 
                car, son.  It s amazing what they 
                can do.  We re going to fit it with 
                hand controls so you can drive.  

                              JASON
                Cool.

                                JOANNE STREET
                  Everything s going to be okay, 
                honey.  You re going home.

  FIND JOANNE STREET, in the passenger seat.  While Mrs. Street 
  is sincerely overjoyed, she s also anxious about the future - 
  and no smile painted on her face can hide this.  Jason smiles 
  back, but then his smile fades as his eyes are drawn to...

  THE HANDICAPPED PLACARD hanging from the rear view mirror.  

                                                                      SMASH TO:


  Mr. Street unloads Jason from the Cadillac, but Jason insists 
  on wheeling himself up the homemade ramp.

                                JOANNE STREET
                Your dad made those ramps. 

                              JASON
                Good job, dad.  

                              MITCHELL STREET
                We converted the living room into 
                your new room.  You ve got your own 
                bathroom and your own entrance.

  Mrs. Street opens the door.  Jason wheels inside - but gets 
  stuck on the lip.  He struggles.  Mrs. Street motions Mr. 
  Street to help, but Jason shakes him off.

                              JASON
                  I...got...it...




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                      5.

  Jason gets over the lip!  OFF this triumphant moment...


  SMASH, surrounded by Smashettes, holds court.  

                              SMASH
                Embrace the game.  Breathe it, live 
                it, eat it, think it, see it.  At 
                all times, in all ways.  Football 
                is life.  And I m setting records 
                Friday Night, you can t contain my 
                desire.  Just give me the ball...

  Smash stops mid-sentence as WAVERLY GRADY (17) walks by.  
  There s something sophisticated about her that sets her 




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                      6.

  apart.  Plus, she s drop dead beautiful.  Smash FOLLOWS  
  Waverly -- 

                                SMASHETTE
                Hey, Smash!  Where you going?

  STAY WITH SMASH, a lion stalking his prey. 

                              SMASH
                Excuse me, Miss?  I do not believe 
                I have the privilege of knowing 
                you.  If you d like, I ll escort 
                you to wherever you re going, give 
                us a chance to exchange 
                  formalities...  

  Waverly rolls her eyes, keeps walking.

                              SMASH (CONT D)
                I ve got almost thirty minutes till 
                  practice.  Football practice?

  No response.  Smash flashes his million dollar smile.

                              SMASH (CONT D)
                You do know who I am?  Smash 
                  Williams, star running back.  
                Destined for USC, for the Heisman, 
                for the NFL, and for the Hall of 
                Fame.  

  None of this impresses Waverly.  Smash keeps following.

                              SMASH (CONT D)
                Now don t be shy, girl.  I know I 
                just laid a lot of intimidating 
                info on you, but deep down, Smash 
                is humble.  It just happens to be 
                your lucky day that Smash s eyes 
                have locked on you. 

  A BLACK LINCOLN CONTINENTAL pulls up.  Waverly waves at the 
  driver, who is concealed behind tinted windows.

                              WAVERLY
                I ve got a ride.  But, thanks.

  The tinted window of the Lincoln rolls down.  REVEAL REVEREND 
  GRADY in the driver s seat.  

  ON SMASH, suddenly recognizing Waverly.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                      7.

                              SMASH
                Waverly?  Waverly Grady?

                              REVEREND GRADY
                Hi, Brian.  Ready for Friday s 
                game?

  Smash nods, but the game is the furthest thing from his mind.

                              REVEREND GRADY (CONT D)
                You remember Waverly?

                              WAVERLY
                He does now.

  Waverly winks, gets in the car.  The Lincoln pulls away.   

  OFF Smash, like he just got stung by Muhammad Ali.

                                                                      SMASH TO:

  The Taylors commute to school.

                              TAMI (O.S.)
                It bothers you.

                                TAYLOR (O.S.)
                It does not bother me.

                              TAMI (O.S.)
                Come on, admit it.  A co-pep rally?  
                The football team sharing the show?


  TIM RIGGINS pushes Jason down a dirt path.  Lyla walks 
    alongside.  Everyone is laughing.  Suddenly, Jason STEPS OUT 
  of the chair.  A beat as everyone stares, then Jason WALKS 
  down the path, the smile on his face widening, then Jason 
  RUNS, faster and faster, full of joy --

  He FALLS into mud.  Struggles to get out, but the mud is 
    quicksand, and Jason s legs are stuck.  He looks to Tim and 
  Lyla for help, but they walk away.  Jason struggles with 
    everything he s got, but his legs can t move and he slowly 
  sinks down, deeper and deeper.  Finally, his head goes under 
  and he can t breathe...

                                                                          CUT TO:


  The cheerleading squad jogs through town, Lyla Garrity at the 
  head.  Townspeople stop in their tracks - these girls are not 
  a bad sight.

  The girls jog to a park, and start doing sit-ups.  FIND 
  Kennedy, whispering loudly to Brittany.

                              KENNEDY
                I m not judging Lyla, I ve been 
                friends with her since forever.  
                But getting banged by Tim Riggins 
                could be more then she can handle.  
                Could throw off her whole game.  
                With the tournament this Saturday, 
                that s too risky.  We have to win.

  FIND Lyla, about to kill.  MARIA laughs.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                      16.

    CONTINUED:


                              MARIA
                Don t listen to Kennedy.  She s 
                jealous, that s all.  She wishes 
                Tim Riggins made a play for her.

                              KENNEDY
                Make a play for this, bitch.

  ON Lyla, feeling even worse.  Maria resumes jogging.  

                              MARIA
                Come on Lyla, you know you re bank.  
                Work out the anger.  Let s use that 
                nasty energy to win the tournament. 

  Most of the girls agree, and they all start jogging down the 
  path.  Except Lyla.  She jogs in another direction.

                              LYLA
                You girls go.  I ll see you later.

  STAY WITH LYLA as she jogs away.  CONTINUE WITH HER as she 
  runs past Dillon Elementary.  GRADE SCHOOL CHEERLEADERS 
  practice in front of the school.  The young girls recognize 
  Lyla and wave, as if a celebrity is passing.  A couple of 
  teachers, however, look at Lyla with judgement.  Or do they?  
  OFF Lyla, unsure...


  Jason is in his driveway, spinning in his wheelchair.

                                GEORGE (O.S.)
                Jason?  Hey Jason, you re home!

  GEORGE DUNN, Jason s next door neighbor, walks over.  Shakes 
  Jason s hand, though Jason struggles with returning the grip.  
  MRS. DUNN and NICK, their six-year-old son, hurry over as 
  well.  Mrs. Dunn hugs Jason.

                              MRS. DUNN
                Welcome home.

                              JASON
                Thanks, Mrs. Dunn.

                              MRS. DUNN
                You look good.  Doesn t he, George, 
                doesn t Jason look good?

                                GEORGE DUNN
                He does.  You do, Jason.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                      17.

    CONTINUED:


  The Dunns mean it, and Jason takes it the right way.  ANGLE 
  ON Nick, sitting on a tricycle, staring at Jason.

                              NICK DUNN
                Can you walk?

  ON Nick s parents, very uncomfortable.

                              JASON
                No, I can t.  But I bet I can go 
                faster than you.

  Jason spins his chair, motions toward Nick s tricycle. 

                              NICK DUNN
                Bet you can t.

                                                                  TIME CUT TO:

  BOTTOM OF THE DRIVEWAY

  ANGLE ON little Nick in his tricycle racing Jason Street in 
  his wheelchair.  Up the length of the driveway... Nick wins!

                              NICK DUNN
                Yay!

  ANGLE ON Jason, laughing, spinning his chair.  He stops --

  REVEAL Lyla at the bottom of the driveway.  

  No one says a word.  Mr. Dunn gathers his family and walks 
  away.  Jason still hasn t moved.  Neither has Lyla.  Finally 
  she opens her mouth, but nothing comes out.  She tries 
  again...

                              LYLA
                I... I...

  But it s too late.  Jason spins around and enters his room.  
  Closes the door.  OFF Lyla, totally rejected...

                come within ten feet unless you 
                plan on buying.

  But Ben s face is serious.

                              BEN
                I came to apologize.  Alice and I 
                are punishing Brittany for what she 
                did to Lyla.

  Buddy has no idea what Ben s talking about.  

                              BEN (CONT D)
                  I thought you knew.  Brittany put 
                  something nasty on Myspace.  Other 
                kids then added to it, but Brittany 
                started it.  Hell Buddy, I don t 
                even know what Myspace is, but I 
                can assure you, it won t happen 
                again.  I just wanted to apologize 
                in person.  Lyla doesn t deserve 
                this, no matter what she did.

  OFF Buddy, No matter what she did echoing in his head...


  Lyla walks toward the gymnasium.  Tyra intercepts her.

                              TYRA
                Damn you, Lyla!

  Lyla stops, dreading this confrontation.  Tyra s fists are 
  balled, she s ready to fly off the handle.  

                              TYRA (CONT D)
                You know, you... you...

  Tears suddenly well in Tyra s eyes.  Tyra, shocked and 
    embarrassed, quickly turns and leaves.  OFF Lyla, feeling 
  even worse than if Tyra had ripped into her...

                                                                          CUT TO:                                                                                      24.




  The football team scrimmages, lined up over the ball on the 
  twenty yard-line, awaiting Coach s whistle.  

                                TAYLOR
                Dillon has never lost to the Rams.  
                We will not lose on Friday.  You 
                will dominate your opponent!  You 
                will hit hard, hit harder, then hit 
                even harder still.  That clear?  

                              THE TEAM
                Yes, sir!

  Coach WHISTLES.  Saracen barks the play.  The ball is 
  snapped, pads POP! and the linebackers BLITZ --

  Saracen ducks under them, rolls to his right.  Tosses a 
  teardrop pass to --

  SMASH.  The ball drops into Smash s hands and Smash makes for 
  the endzone without breaking stride.  A DEFENDER is down 
  field, and has a great angle on Smash...  



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                      33.

    CONTINUED:


  WIDE as we FOLLOW THE FOOTRACE, but despite the angle, the 
  defender can t gain as Smash kicks it into an extra gear.  
  Smash crosses the 50, the 40, 30, 20 --

  The defender s angle finally intersects, but Smash easily 
    STIFF-ARMS him aside and skips into the endzone.  Spins the 
  ball on the ground and prances.

                              SMASH
                Who s the fastest?  Who is the 
                fastest?  Say hello to the Smash.

  ON THE SIDELINE

  MAC nods at Coach, impressed.  OFF Coach, saying nothing.  
  Just taking it all in...


  Main Street is crowded with pedestrians.  BUSINESSMEN get 
  their shoes shined.  


  Smash stands below Waverly s window.

                              SMASH
                I m not leaving until you agree to 
                go out with me tonight.  Get some 
                pizza, ice cream, whatever.  But 
                I m not leaving  till you say yes.

  ON Waverly, standing at the window.  She doesn t flinch.

                              SMASH (CONT D)
                Think about what you re doing.  I m 
                the Panthers  star player.  We lose 
                this game, goodbye State.  The 
                entire town of Dillon will be 
                  devastated, and it will be all your 
                fault.  All because you wouldn t 
                agree to one simple date.  We don t 
                even have to call it a date.

  Waverly turns inside.

                              SMASH (CONT D)
                Whoa!  Where you going!!  I m 
                warning you, you can t bluff the 
                Smash!  Waverly?


  Smash talks to himself, puzzled.

                              SMASH
                Now what, Smash?  You really gonna 
                skip the game?  For a girl?

  He toughens up.  Then looks at his watch.  Glances at 
  Waverly s window.  Panic.  But Waverly appears.

                              WAVERLY
                Okay, I ll go.  For Dillon s sake.

  Smash flashes his million dollar smile. 

                              SMASH
                Sweet.  Pick you up after the game.  

  He turns from the window, starts on a slow run.

                              SMASH (CONT D)
                The Smash don t lose.  The Smash 
                don t lose.

  STAY WITH Smash, running toward the Friday Night Lights.

                                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

  flapping in the wind.  TICKET LINES circle the stadium.  
  YOUNG GIRLS dressed in homemade skirts wave pom-poms as

  Fans mill as a crazy PANTHER LADY (70), all decked out in

  maintain his dignity, but he s failing.

  FIND Coach pushing through a throng of people, politely 
  smiling as everyone congratulates him on last night s game.  

  FIND Smash, surrounded by admirers.  Smash is firing off one-

                having to study plays, and he 
                couldn t make it.  So she ended up 
                going there.

  into the air.  It s showtime.


  THEME MUSIC UP as the Panthers perform.  ON Lyla leading her 
  squad as they tumble in sync, forming a pyramid.  Lyla vaults 
  up, Brittany supports her.  The pyramid moves, Lyla readies 
  her dismount -- 

  The MUSIC CUTS OUT, the sound system dead.  We hear GASPS 
  from the crowd, confusion among the girls.

  The squad moves, Lyla keeping count.  Then the spectators 
  start CLAPPING, and soon the entire stadium maintains the 
  beat.  

  The squad completes its routine, climaxed by Lyla s twisting 
  dismount.  She sticks her landing.

  BACK TO Lyla, taking it all in, her game face still on.  
  Telling us that she s here, she s not moving, and anybody who 
  has a problem with it can go straight to hell.  

  REVEAL Tim Riggins, also on his feet, clapping with gusto.  
  Then Tim sees Jason Street...

    A cheering crowd, something he s seen before, but never from
