      The guys play football with friends. NICK, SCHMIDT and WINSTON 
      are in a huddle. 

                                    SCHMIDT
                    Nick, go out ten yards, cut left. 
                    Winston, go long, post right.

      WIDEN TO REVEAL JESS is also in the huddle.

                    Jess, see if you can find a 
                    shamrock in the grass.

                                  JESS
                    Oh, ha, ha, very funny.

                    I know. Break!

      They LINE UP. Schmidt, as QB, calls out:

                    Hike!

      Schmidt drops back, throws to Nick, but the ball sails high 
      over his head. Exasperated, Nick throws his hands up.

      Just then, Jess flies INTO FRAME and collides with Nick, 
      hard. Nick lies writhing in pain. The gang surrounds him.

      Winston is sitting in a newer version of the car, eating a

                    Give me the keys.

      Sherman reluctantly hands Winston his  keys : An unbent

      Suddenly, Nick begins running toward the beach. As he runs, 
      he begins stripping off his clothes.

      runs toward the water, naked.

                    to describe how much this hurts! 

      He clambers out and scrambles for his clothes. The gang all 
      run down the beach to join Nick.

      Finally, the reality of the everything hits him and he can no 
      longer hold back.

                    I might have cancer and I m not

                    gonna do that again so I can get a 
                    better look?

      They all glare at him, then Winston crosses over to Nick, 
      takes off his jacket and drapes it over Nick s shoulders. He 
      crosses back to the group. 

                                    WINSTON
                    Leave him alone for a sec.

                    I m going over there.

                                    WINSTON
                    Good luck.

      Jess gets up and heads over to Nick.  

                                  JESS
                    Hey.  

      Jess sits down next to him.

                    Jess. Jess. I like you so much. All 
                    the weird stuff you do. I like 
                    that, too. I like when you sing.

                    Sometimes you sing right in my 
                    face, but I still like it. I think 
                    you look like a flower. 

                                  JESS
                    Thank you.

                    You re right. I have to do things. 
                    I have to start doing things. I m

                    Most certainly not!

      Jess puts her hand on his head and strokes his hair.

                    We should go home. 

                                  NICK
                    We should totally go home. It would 
                    be unwise to sleep here.

                    Yes. Let s go home.

      They don t move.

      Cece, Schmidt and Jess are asleep on the beach. Nick is not. 
      He sits as before, clearly having spent the night awake. 

      ON WINSTON, asleep in the driver s seat of his car. He stirs, 
      then wakes up to the bright sun. He looks at the clock on his 
      dash, then yells out the window to the group:

                                    WINSTON
                    Hey! Wake up! We gotta go! We re 
                    gonna be late for Nick s appointment!    NEW GIRL  #109     "Injured"      FINAL COLLATED DRAFT      27.


      ON THE GROUP as they stir awake, then realize it is morning.  
      Schmidt and Cece get up and gather their things. As Cece 
      rushes to the car, Schmidt looks down and sees her perfect 
      butt print. He starts to comment, thinks better of it and 
      follows her to the car.  

                                  JESS
                    Nick, Nick, come on--

                                  NICK
                    Uggggggh. Where- what did I--

                                  JESS
                    Just come on!

      They move to the car, where Schmidt faces off with Winston. 

                                    SCHMIDT
                    I love you, Winston, but friend to 
                    friend, how can you not see what a 
                    disaster this car is? People are 
                    judging you. People who don t 
                    usually judge other people are 
                    judging you.  

                                    WINSTON
                    Cone on. I just added a quart of 
                    oil, we ve got about twenty minutes 
                    before it leaks through. Get in the 
                    damn car. 

      They all pile into the car. Winston starts it up and it jerks 
      and sputters away. The back bumper falls off as they chug up 
      the road.

                                        ACT FOUR


      Winston s car barely makes it up the drive and practically 
      collapses into a parking spot. Everyone gets out and runs 
      into the hospital. As Winston follows, his car continues to 
      jerk, sputter and cough even though the keys are out of the 
      ignition. Finally, it just dies. Winston looks back 
      concerned, but there s no time to deal with this now. He 
      follows the gang into the hospital.


      Over music: A much relieved group pours out of the hospital 
      and piles into Winston s car.    NEW GIRL  #109     "Injured"      FINAL COLLATED DRAFT      30.



      Everyone but Winston gets out of the car and begins walking 
      away as Winston tries desperately to get it started. He gets 
      out of the car as if he s about to push-start it again. Lays 
      his hands on the trunk. Stops for a beat, then lets go. It s 
      over. Schmidt pats him on the back. Winston nods.

      He goes to the front of the car, yanks off the front license 
      plate with all of his might, takes one final look at his 
      past, then runs to catch up with his friends.  

      As they all walk off together, we see Nick talking into his 
      phone. 

                                  NICK
                          (into phone)
                    Hi Julia? It s Nick. Which Nick? Uh-
                    oh. Nick Miller. Oh, no, I knew you 
                    were kidding....

      END OF SHOW.
