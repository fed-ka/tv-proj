A sign reads "Bridge to Canada."
A steep 1940's era customs bridge arches over the St.
Lawrence River.
Cars and trucks line up in different lanes. Customs
officials inspect and question impatient drivers.
Beyond them a smaller sign: "THANK YOU FOR VISITING
MASSENA NEW YORK, IT WORKS, for business, for family, for
you".

The river stretches for miles in either direction,
frozen, and still with trees on either side.

RAY EDDY, 38, a bit worn for her years, with a long red
ponytail, wearing an old bathrobe, sits in the passenger
seat of her RED PLYMOUTH HORIZON with the door open,
smoking a cigarette, thinking. Her breath is visible in
the cold morning air.
Her bare feet rest on the cold ground.
Her 1970's rusted out TRAILER HOME SITS in front of her
on CINDER BLOCKS AT A SLIGHT TILT. Beside it, a small
SHED and behind it the CONCRETE FOUNDATION FOR A HOUSE.
Around her, the yard is littered with junk: a rusted ski
lift chair, the front end of a Plymouth Duster and a
SMILING DUCK Kiddie Ride.
Beyond the yard, flat, winterbare land.
After a moment, a lanky boy of 15, her son, TROY, JR.,
leans out the trailer door.
T.J.
We're out of Capt'n Crunch.
His breath is visible in the cold.
RAY
Just give him toast.
2.
T.J.
We got no butter, we got no jelly.
Ray is out of ideas. He expects her to move, but she
stays still. He looks around the yard.
T.J. (CONT'D)
What are you doing?
RAY
Listening for the trucks.
T.J.
Are they really coming?
RAY
Yeah.
T.J.
Where's dad?
She is silent.
T.J. (CONT'D)
(says it slow)
Where's dad?
She looks at him.
RAY
I don't know how he found it, T.J.
T.J.
Found what?
Ray takes a drag off her cigarette. T.J. walks over to
the car.
T.J. (CONT'D)
The money?
RAY
I locked it in my glove compartment.
T.J. looks in at the OPEN AND EMPTY GLOVE COMPARTMENT.
T.J.
That was stupid.
RAY
Yeah, I see that now, but the trucks were
coming before the bank opened.
3.
T.J.
Did you tell him you had it?
RAY
Duh? No, I guess he just sniffed it out.
T.J.
Jesus Christ! The glove compartment!?
That's the stupidest place you could have
put it.
RAY
He hasn't bought a scratch card in almost
thirty two months. I thought it would be
okay!
T.J.
Did he leave anything?
She shakes her head.
T.J. (CONT'D)
What are you gonna do?
RAY
Nothing.
T.J.
You could look for him?
RAY
He could be anywhere.
T.J.
We should look for him.
RAY
Where?
T.J.
The Rez,
RAY
With more than four thousand dollars,
he's probably in Atlantic City by now.
T.J.
So let's go, let's find him before he
blows it all.
(CONT'D)
4.
RAY
I can't.
T.J.
What do you mean?
RAY
I just can't do it anymore.
T.J.
But he'll lose it all.
RAY
T.J., we can't make him stop.
T.J.
He stole our money. Call the Troopers.
RAY
It's not stealing if you take it from
your family. Anyway, he made some of it,
too.
T.J.
So you're just gonna sit there?
RAY
I'm sorry.
In the distance the RUMBLE OF TRUCKS. Ray hears it. It
gets louder.
T.J.
Another Christmas in the tin crapper.
T.J. goes into the shed and slams the door.
Ray throws down her cigarette and goes into the trailer.

A PICK-UP TRUCK DRAPED WITH A "WIDE LOAD" banner leads
TWO SEMIS hauling halves of a DOUBLE WIDE MOBILE HOME
wrapped in plastic, rippling in the wind.
Ricky stops at the massive sight, twisting at his fly,
trying not to pee himself.
T.J. comes out of the shed.
The Doubles come to a stop and idle in the yard.
GUY VERSAILLES, pot-bellied, in a green velour running
suit, squeezes out of his truck. On the door: "MASSENA
MODULAR AND MOBILE HOMES, NEW AND RECONDITIONED."
Ricky grabs a rope hanging off one of the doubles and
tries to climb the side of it. The TRUCK DRIVER looks
down from his cab.
T.J.
(to Ricky)
Get down.
Ray peeks out the kitchen curtain.
6.
After a moment she comes out of the trailer, with a
pasted-on smile.
RAY
We're all ready for ya'.
She points to the new concrete foundation. He consults a
clipboard.
VERSAILLES
We'll need the balloon payment to unload.
T.J. looks at Ray.
RAY
We have it, it's just that they called
Troy from Titus last night. That's where
Troy works. The ski place? And anyway-
VERSAILLES
Have you got the $4,372 dollars or not?
RAY
It was some emergency with the lifts. So
he took off without thinking with the
money. Completely forgot you were coming.
So as soon as he gets back-
VERSAILLES
When's he gonna be back?
RAY
As soon as he can get here, I'll just run
it down to you.
T.J. could crawl out of his skin.
VERSAILLES
(ironic smile)
This is the second time you've dragged me
out here. If you don't come up with it by
Christmas, you've lost your fifteen
hundred dollar deposit.
He walks toward his car. She follows him.
RAY
Look, Mr. Versales, I have a good job at
ALL FOR A DOLLAR. They're probably gonna
make me a manager after Christmas so I
can handle the payments if you just leave
the house-
7.
He gets in the car.
VERSAILLES
Call me when you have the balloon
payment.
He makes a circle in the air with his hand and the semi's
rev their engines and grind into reverse.
RAY
I'll call you...
Her voice is DROWNED OUT by REVVING engines.
Ricky rushes to her.
RICKY
Wait, where are they going?
She takes his face in her hands.
RAY
Listen to me. We'll get them back.
RICKY
But why are they leaving?
RAY
Ricky, I'll get them back. I promise,
honey.
RICKY
That's our house!
He BREAKS AWAY from her and RUNS down the road chasing
after the semis. Ray chases after Ricky until he runs out
of steam and stops, panting.
She catches up to him and tries to hug him. He pushes her
away. She gets down on her knees and takes his face in
her hands.
RAY
We're gonna get it back.
She picks him up and walks back to the trailer. Ricky
looks out mournfully at the trailers disappearing down
the road.
RAY (CONT'D)
(to T.J.)
You better hurry or you're going to miss
the bus. Let's get your clothes on,
Ricky.
8.
T.J. just stares at her.
T.J.
I can get a job you know.
RAY
You're 15, T.J.
T.J.
They won't ask any questions.
RAY
You're finishing school.
T.J.
Come on, you don't think we can live on
what you make at All for a Dollar do you?
RAY
You're going to school.
She goes inside.
T.J. follows.
T.J.
I bet I could make more than you do.
She ignores him.

ROUTE 37 - DAY
8
Ray drives down a two-lane highway. It is empty flat land
but for a few trailer homes and barns.
She passes a lonely sign: "BRIDGE TO CANADA."
Up ahead another sign: "AKWESASNE LAND OF THE MOHAWK."
From the car, the Reservation consists of shabby houses
with no siding, tax-free gas stations and dive bars with
homemade signs. Ray slows a little to check out the
parking lots scanning for her husband's car.
Up ahead she sees a sign: "WOLF MART TAX FREE GAS AND
CIGARETTES.
9
9
Ray pulls in to the combo gas station, restaurant and
mini mart.
12.
A MOHAWK TEENAGER wearing a bandana RUNS out to the CAR
without a coat, rubbing his hands together to ward off
the cold.
MOHAWK TEENAGER
Fill it up?
She rolls down the window, digging for change under the
seat of her car. She counts it out.
RAY
Just three...uh, no...two seventy one,
two, three, four.
MOHAWK TEENAGER
Two seventy four.
He nods and goes to the pump. She finds a wadded up five
dollar bill.
RAY
(yells out window)
Make that seven seventy four.
She spots a sign for "TRAILWAYS" bus in the window.
RAY (CONT'D)
Did you see a Blue Acclaim come in here
last night?
MOHAWK TEENAGER
Blue Acclaim...no, but I only worked
until 9 PM. You can ask inside.
Ray glances inside at the mostly empty restaurant but for
a few older Mohawk women.
RAY
No, that's okay.
MOHAWK TEENAGER
Did you want to support our Mosquito
Lacrosse League. It teaches basic
Lacrosse skills to the kids three to
five.
Ray shakes her head.
MOHAWK TEENAGER (CONT'D)
Thanks, anyway. Have a good day.
13.
10
10
Ray continues down the highway through the reservation.
She comes to a huge warehouse, the "MOHAWK BINGO PALACE."
She glances over at the sea of cars surrounding it. At
the end of a row she spots it: a BLUE ACCLAIM.
Ray abruptly turns in.
11
11
Ray pulls up alongside the Acclaim and recognizes it by
the "EASY DOES IT" bumper sticker.
She gets out and looks inside. There is a small plastic T-
Rex on the floor of the backseat.
She leans against the car for a moment.
RAY
Thank you. Oh God, thank you, thank you
thank you...
After a moment Ray looks up at the Bingo Palace and heads
for the entrance.
RAY (CONT'D)
You son of a bitch!
12
13
Ray walks out of the front entrance back across the
parking lot toward the Horizon through rows of cars...
Across the parking lot, LILA LITTLEWOLF, 20, a Mohawk
girl with long black hair bursts out of the "Employees
Entrance" and hurries across the parking lot pulling off
her scratch card apron as she walks.
Ray catches sight of her, but before Ray reaches the
Horizon, Lila reaches the ACCLAIM, GETS IN IT AND BACKS
OUT.
RAY
Hey!
15.
But Lila drives off.
Ray JUMPS back in the Horizon and TAKES OFF AFTER HER.
14
14
Ray follows the Acclaim down Route 37 and catches sight
of it turning off on a dirt road.
Ray makes the corner just in time to catch sight of the
Acclaim bouncing off on a path through the woods.
Ray follows it through the woods to a clearing: the
Acclaim stops in front of a rusted out BUBBLE CAMPER.
Lila gets out. Ray pulls up behind her and rolls down her
window.
RAY
That's my car.
Lila SPINS around.
LILA
Huh?
RAY
(points to the Acclaim)
What are you doing with my car?
Lila fingers the keys in her hand.
LILA
That? I found it.
RAY
You stole it.
LILA
The keys were in it.
RAY
So you just took it...?
Lila goes in the bubble camper and shuts the door behind
her.
Ray gets out of the Horizon and walks up to the camper
door and takes out her cell phone.
RAY (CONT'D)
We'll just see what the troopers say
about that.
16.
LILA (O.S.)
(From inside camper)
Go ahead, they got no jurisdiction here.
This is Mohawk territory.
Ray stops dialing closes up her phone, then goes to her
car and takes the gun and goes back to the camper.
RAY
(knocks with the gun)
You can cut the bullshit and give me my
keys now.
There is no reponse. Ray waits for a moment and then:
RAY (CONT'D)
(low voice)
Troy, are you in there?
There is no response.
RAY (CONT'D)
If you're in there you better come out.
15
16
Ray aims the gun and FIRES into the camper door.
17
18
Keeping behind the door for cover, Lila opens it. Ray
looks inside: there is no sign of Troy.
LILA
(from behind the door)
The Tribal police don't like people
shooting holes in other people's houses.
Ray looks at her.
RAY
This is New York State so quit the
bullshit and give me my damn keys!
Lila throws the keys out the door. Ray picks them up off
the ground. Lila shuts the door with her foot.
19
19
Ray gets in the Horizon and pulls it in behind the
Acclaim then digs in the trunk, pulling out a rope.
She ties one end to the Acclaim's back fender and the
other to the Horizon's front fender.
Lila watches out the camper window.
Ray gets in the Acclaim and starts it up slowly TOWING
the Horizon a few feet before the rope SNAPS.
Ray gets out and looks at the broken rope. She begins
digging in the trunk for more rope.
Lila opens the camper door and looks at the bullet hole.
LILA
This camper belongs to my brother in law.
He won't like this.
RAY
(over her shoulder)
Then you should quit stealing cars.
LILA
I thought it was abandoned, the guy
driving it got on a bus.
Ray stops.
RAY
Did you see where the bus was headed?
18.
LILA
New York or Buffalo, I'm not sure.
Ray RE-TIES the tow line with the remaining rope.
This time the Horizon goes an inch or two before the rope
SNAPS. Ray gets out.
RAY
(under her breath)
Shit!
Ray RIFLES through the trunk for more rope.
"Home on the Range" plays on the cell phone in Ray's back
pocket.
Lila touches the bullet hole in the camper and listens to
Ray's conversation from the doorway.
Ray puts the phone back in her pocket and takes an old
belt of her husbands and tries to attach the fenders of
the cars.
Ray gets back in the Acclaim and tries TOWING the Horizon
once again.
This time the right side of the front fender SNAPS OFF
and droops to one side.
Ray gets out and looks at Lila.
RAY (CONT'D)
I'm not leaving this here.
LILA
(points at the Acclaim)
I got a friend who might buy that.
RAY
It's not for sale.
LILA
He'll pay more than it's worth.
Ray ignores her.
LILA (CONT'D)
Maybe two thousand.
RAY
Why's that?
19.
LILA
He's always looking for cars with button-
release trunks.
Ray thinks about it.
LILA (CONT'D)
He don't need papers or anything.
RAY
Does he use them to rob banks or
something?
Lila shrugs.
LILA
All I know is he pays good for a car like
this.
RAY
Where does he live?
LILA
Through the woods. Not far.
RAY
What's in it for you?
LILA
He'll give me something for finding it.
RAY
If you try anything, I'm not afraid to
use this.
LILA
Yeah.
20
21
The car emerges from the woods at a BOAT RAMP leading to
a mile-wide section of the FROZEN ST. LAWRENCE RIVER.
22
23
The Acclaim moves across the smooth surface of the river.
24
25
Ray and Lila pull into a used-car lot surrounded by a
chain link fence. There is no sign of life. Ray stops.
LILA
Honk the horn.
Ray honks.
Suddenly, from under a gutted truck, A HUGE BLACK DOG,
part wolf, SPRINGS onto the hood of the Acclaim.
Ray is pinned against her seat at the sight of the dog.
Lila GRABS the gun out of her hand and points it at Ray.
LILA (CONT'D)
Just keep your mouth shut.
Ray stares at the snarling dog.
LILA (CONT'D)
Just keep it shut. Okay?
Ray nods never taking her eyes off the dog.
Lila honks the horn again and keeps the gun low and out
of sight.
Out of the garage comes JIMMY, 33, a stocky Mohawk,
eating a sandwich.
Jimmy looks suspiciously at Ray before he sees Lila.
Thunder growls.
JIMMY
Thunder! SHUT UP!.
The dog GROWLS ferociously at Ray.
JIMMY (CONT'D)
Get back under there!
Thunder jumps off the hood and disappears back under the
trunk.
23.
Jimmy walks around to the passenger side of the car. Lila
rolls down her window.
LILA
Hi, Jimmy.
Jimmy glances at Ray.
JIMMY
He don't like whites, Lila.
LILA
Sorry.
JIMMY
And your late.
LILA
Sorry.
JIMMY
I shouldn't even be dealing with you.
LILA
I know. Sorry.
He hands her a paper bag.
Jimmy goes back to the garage and opens the door. TWO
YOUNG CHINESE MEN in cheap jogging suits follow him out,
looking around.
26
27
The Acclaim drives down the bank onto the frozen river
and starts across.
28
29
Ray and Lila bounce through the woods with Lila holding
the gun, this time.
They come to a dirt road then to an intersection with
State Route 37.
A SIGN READS: "YOU ARE LEAVING AKWESASNE, LAND OF THE
MOHAWK".
26.
30
31
Just beyond the Reservation line, partly hidden behind a
barn, a NEW YORK STATE TROOPER VEHICLE sits parked.
32
32
Ray pulls into a 1950s strip motel. A Pakistani man, the
DEALER, looks out from the motel office.
33
35
Ray drives up in the Acclaim.
T.J., wearing PROTECTIVE GOGGLES, works on the broken
Duck Kiddie ride with a BLOW TORCH. He doesn't notice
Ray.
Ray covers over the cut with her hair and gets out and
walks up behind him and taps him on the shoulder. He
jumps and cuts the flame.
RAY
I told you not to use that thing when I'm
not here.
T.J.
If I get it working I can sell it.
She looks at the rusted pieces of it.
RAY
I don't care. Don't use that thing when
I'm not here!
29.
T.J.
Rentaworld called. They're coming to get
the TV if you don't pay by four tomorrow.
He notices the car.
T.J. (CONT'D)
Did you find him?
RAY
No.
T.J.
Where was the car?
RAY
At the bus stop on the Rez.
T.J.
I bet he went to Atlantic City.
RAY
You don't know that.
T.J.
Yeah, but you could figure it out. Just
find out what buses came through last-
RAY
And then what? Chase him across the
country. Miss work. No.
T.J.
What happened to your face?
RAY
Nothin'.
T.J.
What, did you get in a fight with
somebody?
RAY
It was no big deal.
T.J.
You got in a fight, for real?
RAY
Some Indian chick tried to steal your
Dad's car.
30.
T.J.
No way. I say we go back there and kick
some Mohawk ass.
RAY
It doesn't matter.
T.J.
Where's your car?
RAY
I'll get it tomorrow.
T.J.
You left it on the rez? That's so stupid.
RAY
I didn't have a tow rope.
T.J.
I still say we go back there and kick
some Mohawk ass.
RAY
Forget it T.J. Did you and Ricky eat?
T.J.
That would be kinda miraculous since
there's no food in the house.
RAY
There's food.
T.J.
Popcorn and Tang.
Ray goes towards the trailer.
36
36
Lila walks in off the road. MIKE, the owner, plays a
handheld video game.
She looks around the lot.
MIKE
(In Mohawk)
Hi, Lila
LILA
(In Mohawk)
Mike.
31.
She glances at a row of beat used cars.
MIKE
How's life at the Bingo Palace.
LILA
Good. How's business?
MIKE
Oh, you know, okay.
She eyes a Malibu.
LILA
How much for that one?
MIKE
Come on, Lila.
LILA
What?! I've been saving up.
MIKE
You know what.
LILA
Does Bernie Littlewolf run your whole
life?
MIKE
No, but he said not to sell you a car.
LILA
I gotta walk down 37 with the semis
kickin' up snow and mud in my hair just
to get to the work.
MIKE
For you, all I got are two Chevettes,a
Horizon and a Civic.
LILA
I don't like Chevettes.
MIKE
I figured.
She holds out a wad of cash.
LILA
I'll give you a thousand for the Malibu.
On the windshield of the Malibu in huge white letters:
$750.
32.
MIKE
Nothing with a trunk.
LILA
That thing has been sittin' here for six
months.
MIKE
I don't want Bernie in my face. Okay?
LILA
He doesn't have to know.
Mike rolls his eyes.
37
39
Ray pulls up in front of the camper and stops.
The Horizon is still there and all is quiet.
Ray gets out holding the gun and a long rope goes to the
bumper and begins to tie it to the other bumper, looking
over her shoulder every once in while at the camper.
Once she has tied the cars together she gets back into
the Acclaim, but instead of driving off, she just sits
there.
After a moment, she gets out with the gun and walks up to
the camper.
The bullet hole in the door has a sock stuffed in it.
RAY
(low tone)
I want my part.
35.
40
41
Ray and Lila drive across the smooth surface of the
river. Ray smokes with one hand and holds the gun with
the other.
LILA
How many bedrooms?
RAY
Three. I got kids.
LILA
How old?
RAY
Five and Fifteen.
LILA
I got a boy. Almost one.
Ray looks at her.
LILA (CONT'D)
He lives with my mother-in-law. (after a
moment) She stole him from me.
RAY
Stole him?
LILA
Yeah. Right out of the hospital.
RAY
Stole him?
37.
LILA
Tribal police don't get involved in stuff
like that.
Lila looks out across the river at dusk with no
expression. The ice looks clean and still.
Ray picks up speed to climb the river bank.
42
42
Ray and Lila drive up in the Acclaim. Thunder SPRINGS out
again, caught by his CHAIN just short of the car. Ray
flinches but keeps hold of the gun.
Jimmy walks out to meet them. Lila rolls down her window.
JIMMY
Bernie was askin' if I'd seen you. I told
him no.
LILA
Thanks.
JIMMY
I don't want any trouble with him, Lila.
LILA
Don't worry about it.
Jimmy's cell phone rings.
JIMMY
This guy's been calling all morning. He's
got two up at the Old Casino.
LILA
Okay.
Jimmy takes the call.
43
NIGHT
44
Ray and Lila bounce through the woods to a collapsed
building. An old BLACK SUV pulls up from the opposite
direction, FACING THEM.
Two MIDDLE-AGED CHINESE MEN, get out of the back. One
carries an envelope. At the sight of Ray and Lila, he
stops and says something to the other one.
Both turn around and head back to the SUV.
The DRIVER JACQUES BRUNO, a large Quebecois man, wearing
a full-length fur coat gets out. They argue. He pulls out
a LONG PISTOL and motions the men to the Acclaim.
RAY
What the hell is he doing?
Ray reaches for her gun.
LILA
Keep that thing down.
Bruno walks towards the Acclaim.
LILA (CONT'D)
Roll down the window and see what he
wants.
RAY
What the hell is going on here?
LILA
Just roll it down.
39.
Bruno stands at Ray's window.
Ray slides the gun under her leg and rolls down the
window. Bruno hands her a Tim Horton's bag. She takes it.
BRUNO
(Quebec-French accent)
D'ey don't like de women driver.
He hands Ray the envelope of cash.
LILA
Count it.
Ray nervously COUNTS the money as the Chinese men shiver
outside.
RAY
Twelve hundred.
Lila pops the trunk. Bruno and the Chinese men disappear
around the back of the Acclaim. They hear the trunk
SHUT.
Bruno comes back to Ray's window and taps on it.
Ray looks at Lila.
LILA
Open it.
Ray rolls down the window again.
BRUNO
D'is will keep d'em from running.
He hands her men's shoes and dirty socks.
Ray takes the belongings and ROLLS up the window and
drives away.
45
ACCLAIM ON ROUTE 37 - DAY
47
The Acclaim emerges from a dirt road onto State Route 37.
Up ahead a sign reads: "YOU ARE NOW LEAVING AKWESASNE,
LAND OF THE MOHAWK". The Acclaim drives past.
48
48
Sitting in his New York State Trooper Vehicle, partly
hidden behind a billboard, TROOPER MIKE NAPOLI, mid 40s,
olive-skinned, watches the Acclaim drive by without
expression.
49
50
The Acclaim pulls around back. The Pakistani Dealer
approaches the car and hands Ray a paper bag full of
cash.
51
52
They continue down the road to the reservation line.
After they pass the sign: YOU ARE ENTERING THE LAND OF
THE MOHAWK, Ray pulls over and stops.
Ray takes the money and consolidates it into one paper
bag.
LILA
What about mine?
RAY
We're even now.
They stare at each other for a second or two, but Ray
does not take out the gun. Lila reaches for the door
handle
Lila gets out. Ray drives away.
53
53
The kitchen clock reads 3:55.
44.
A RENTAWORLD truck is parked outside. Two large
RENTAWORLD MEN sit in it. T.J. sees them from inside the
trailer. He comes outside.
He walks up to the trunk. One of the men rolls down the
window.
T.J.
My mom told me to give you her credit
card number.
RENTACENTER MAN
(weary)
We only take cash or money orders.
T.J.
Well, my Mom might be late.
RENTACENTER MAN
She's got three minutes.
T.J. goes back inside.
54
55
The RENTAWORLD men get out of the car and start toward
the trailer.
From down the road the Acclaim comes roaring along,
kicking up dust.
Ray swerves in and jumps out and runs up to the men.
RAY
It's okay. I got it right here. (she
waves a wad of fifties and twenties). Two
fifty five, right?
The men nod, relieved. Ray counts out the money.
Ricky bursts out the door and runs towards Ray.
RICKY
Mommy!
45.
She catches him in her arms and hugs him. T.J. stands at
the trailer door, watching as the men drive away.
RAY
(to Ricky)
Who wants to go the Price Chopper and get
some Cap'n Crunch?
RICKY
I DO!
RAY
Wanna to go to the Price Chopper?
T.J. walks out, looking at the money suspiciously.
T.J.
Where'd you get that?
RAY
(a beat)
Matt made me an assistant manager.
T.J.
No way.
RAY
Is that so hard to believe?
T.J.
It's been like two years.
RAY
Exactly, and that's why he gave me a
bonus.
He isn't convinced.
RAY (CONT'D)
Do you wanna go to the Price Chopper or
not?
T.J. gets in the car.
56
56
Near the river, smoke curls from the chimney of a modest
house.
Lila perches in a tree nearby with a can of Pringles
potato chips dropping every other one on the ground below
where a huge WHITE DOG, part wolf, takes his share.
46.
From the tree Lila looks inside the window of the house
where:
A baby boy, "LITTLE JAKE," about a year old, bangs his
spoon on his high chair tray then throws it down.
EVELYN LITTLEWOLF, 48, a tall thin Mohawk woman with long
hair pulled back, picks it up and gives it back to him.
He throws it again. She knows the game. She gives it
back, but the third time she holds it just out of his
reach and laughs at him. He bangs his fists on the tray.
Lila drinks in the sight.
Abruptly, the DOOR OPENS and EVELYN leans out.
EVELYN
Chance! Chance, get in here before you
freeze your ass off.
The White Dog looks up at Lila who shakes the Pringles
can upside down to show it's empty.
Chance goes inside. The door SHUTS behind him.
Lila stuffs a wad of cash in the can and jumps down from
the tree. She leaves it near the front door and hurries
into the woods.
CUT TO:
57
DAY
60
The camper is buried in snow. A shiny SUV pulls up out
front. BERNIE LITTLEWOLF, 35, burly, well-dressed, Mohawk
man gets out.
He yells across the yard
BERNIE
Lila. Get up. I got a job for you!
61
DAY
62
Lila forces the door open against the heavy snow and
steps outside.
51.
LILA
Where is it?
BERNIE
Get in, I'll tell you on the way.
She grabs her coat and trudges across the yard.
63
68
Ray and Lila drive across the smooth river surface. Snow
falls steadily. The windshield wipers SNAP back and
forth.
They barely avoid the oncoming headlights of another
smuggler's car crossing the ice.
RAY
Don't you people even take Christmas Eve
off?
LILA
Mohawks don't celebrate Christmas.
RAY
You could fool me the way they were all
lined up at All for a Dollar today.
LILA
Those are Christians. The converted.
RAY
From what?
LILA
From the Longhouse ways.
56.
RAY
That's awful not to have Santa Claus--
for the kids, I mean.
69
69
T.J. dumps the contents of a box containing the pieces of
an artificial Christmas tree. Branches cover the floor.
The boys begin putting it together like a puzzle.
The TV is on. A commercial for the HOT WHEELS TECH TRACK
AIR STUNT CHALLENGE SET comes on.
Ricky trains in on it, flinching and jerking his body
with sound effects at the sight of the flying Hot Wheels
cars and the booming voice of the announcer.
RICKY
Daddy is gettin' me that for Christmas.
T.J.
What about Santa Claus?
RICKY
He's bringing the new house.

ACCLAIM, JIMMY'S GARAGE LOT - NIGHT
71
The Pakistani woman crawls into the trunk and the man
picks up the duffle bag to put it in but Ray takes hold
of it.
RAY
I'll take that.
Ray motions him into the trunk and shuts it. Then she
opens the bag and starts to rifle through it but Lila
stops her.
Lila
What are you doing?! Just count the money
and let's go.
Ray looks down at the bag. Nothing is visible but
clothes.
LILA
If we keeps snowing like this we won't be
able to get across the river.
RAY
I just hope these aren't the ones that
blow up themselves and everybody with
them.
Ray zips the bag up and Lila helps her slide it in the
backseat.
72
73
The Acclaim creeps along in heavy snow.
74
NIGHT
76
Ray and Lila drive to the back of Bob's. The Dealer
hurries out to meet them.
77
NIGHT
78
The Pakistani man and woman hurry out of the trunk,
looking around, and rush to the passenger door of the
Acclaim, speaking frantically to each other.
The Dealer tries to hustle them to the garage, but they
won't be moved.
Ray starts to back out, but the Dealer knocks on their
window. Ray rolls it down.
DEALER
(heavy accent)
They say there's a bag.
RAY
It was too heavy. We had to unload it.
62.
The Dealer tells the woman in Urdu. She becomes
HYSTERICAL. She grabs Ray through the window and the
dealer pulls her off.
RAY (CONT'D)
What's the matter with her!?
DEALER
She had something in the bag.
The woman continues screaming in Urdu.
RAY
What is she saying!?
He speaks to her in Urdu.
DEALER
She says her baby. Her baby was in the
bag.
The Dealer and the man hurry the wailing Pakistani woman
into the garage.
79
82
A beat up car is there. Inside a teenager, MITCH, a few
years older than T.J., hands him out a Hot Wheels Tech
Track Air Stunt Challenge Set.
MITCH
That's what you wanted, right?
T.J.
Close enough.
T.J. gives Mitch a piece of paper with a list of names
and credit card numbers including that of Irene
ThreeRivers.
MITCH
Thanks Man, Have a Merry One.
T.J turns to go back inside. He sees SMOKE RISING through
the cracks in the siding and goes to the back.
BLACK SMOKE POURS from under the trailer where old
insulation is smoldering. T.J. runs to the shed, takes a
fire extinguisher and sprays under the trailer. Steam
rises. The fire appears to be out.
83
84
Ray and Lila drive down the boat launch to the river. The
storm has stopped and the river is an endless white
surface.
85
87
Lila runs ahead. Ray struggles to keep Lila in sight.
Ray comes up behind Lila, rifling through THE UNZIPPED
DUFFEL BAG. She suddenly jumps back at the sight of the
tiny face of an infant, wrapped in blankets, eyes closed,
lips blue.
LILA
It's dead.
Ray looks at the baby. Instinctively, she swoops down and
gathers it up.
Ray heads for the car.
RAY
Come on!
Lila follows her.
88
90
Ray pulls out onto Route 37 and passes the reservation
line: "You are now leaving the land of the Mohawk"
Trooper Napoli watches the Acclaim pass again. This time
he pulls out behind it.
91
92
Ray pulls into the breakdown lane and the trooper pulls
in behind her.
93
94
He points at the trunk. Ray stares at it, afraid to
speak.
TROOPER NAPOLI
See that.
Ray stares at the back of the car, afraid to speak.
TROOPER NAPOLI (CONT'D)
Your left rear parking light is not
illuminated.
Ray notices the light.
RAY
Oh, I didn't know.
He takes out his pad and pen.
TROOPER NAPOLI (CONT'D)
I'm gonna give you a provisional
citation. Get this repaired in the next
48 hours and you'll have no problem.
RAY (CONT'D)
Thanks.
TROOPER NAPOLI
(he looks into the car)
Who's your friend?
69.
RAY
She looks after my kids when I have to
work late.
Ray gets back in the car. He shuts the door behind her
and gives Lila a friendly nod.
TROOPER NAPOLI
Have an enjoyable Holiday.
RAY
Yeah, you, too.
She rolls up her window.
95
97
Ray and Lila pull in to the motel but there is no sign of
life.
Ray gathers up the blankets. Lila sits motionless.
RAY
We gotta take it in.
Lila sits absolutely still.
70.
RAY (CONT'D)
What is it?
LILA
It's moving.
RAY
What? Are you sure?
Lila slowly takes the baby from inside her jacket.
His
eyes open. He blinks. Ray and Lila stare at him.
LILA
Hello little baby.
The baby looks back at them.
RAY
He was just cold.
Ray and Lila wrap him up in the blankets and get out with
Lila carrying the bundle and walk into the motel office.
98
101
Ray drives up. The trailer is covered in Christmas
lights.
102
103
A heavy THUD as something hits the side of Lila's camper.
LILA
Bernie!
She opens the door, but no one is there. At her feet she
sees a Pringles can. In it: the cash she left at her
mother-in-law's house for her son.
She looks towards the woods but there is no sign of
anyone. She shuts the door.
Inside she digs through an old box of junk and pulls out
a 2 foot long oval shaped wooden board, an infant board,
and a blanket. She wraps her pillow in the blanket around
the board in the Mohawk tradition and picks it up.
She tries it on her back, then leans it against the wall,
then hangs it on a hook on the wall.
74.
104
105
Ray slips on her boots, grabs her jacket around her and
steps outside the trailer door.
TROOPER NAPOLI
This is about the woman who was with you.
RAY
Yes.
TROOPER NAPOLI
How long have you known her?
75.
RAY
Not too long. She looks after my kids.
TROOPER NAPOLI
She's a smuggler.
RAY
Really?
TROOPER NAPOLI
Yes.
RAY
Wow. That's a shock.
TROOPER NAPOLI
Yes, well, there is that element on the
Reservation I'm sure you know.
RAY
Yeah, I've heard about it but I didn't
know she was involved.
TROOPER NAPOLI
How did you happen to meet her?
RAY
Uh, I think there was a sign for a baby
sitter at the Wolf Mart. That's where I
get my gas.
TROOPER NAPOLI
I just thought you should be aware of
that. She's known to have smuggled
illegal immigrants into the country.
RAY
Oh my God.
He nods his head.
TROOPER NAPOLI
If I were you I'd find a new baby sitter.
You don't want her around young kids.
RAY
Absolutely.
He eyes the side of the trailer where smoke stained
siding is visible.
TROOPER NAPOLI
Well, you have an enjoyable Holiday.
76.
RAY
Thanks. You, too.
Ray stands and watches the trooper drive away. She feels
in the pocket of her bathrobe for her cigarettes and
fumbles to light one, sucking on it, unaware of the cold.
When she turns around she looks at the trailer and
notices the smoke-stained siding on one end of it.
106
107
Ray stands staring at T.J. at the trailer's burnt end.
T.J.
What did he want? Did something happen to
Dad?
RAY
No.
T.J.
Then what did he want?
She points to the blackened siding on the trailer.
RAY
Did you have a fire last night?
T.J.
The pipes froze so I fixed `um.
RAY
You fixed um?
77.
T.J.
Yeah.
RAY
Did you happen to use the blow torch?
She walks around back and looks underneath the trailer: a
mass of charred and melted insulation.
RAY (CONT'D)
Look at this. We can't live here anymore!
T.J.
It's just a tin crapper.
RAY
No, it was our house.
T.J.
So, we're gettin' a new one, right?
RAY
Jesus, you could have killed yourself and
your brother.
She grabs the blowtorch and slams it to the ground, but
it is indestructible.
T.J.
It's not yours, he gave it to me.
She goes to the car, takes out her gun then puts the blow
torch on the ground and aims at it -- but T.J. grabs it.
RAY
Put it down.
T.J.
No!
RAY
Put it down.
T.J.
Are you gonna shoot me now, too?
RAY
Put that thing down!
He ignites the blow torch to spite her.
T.J.
Maybe he didn't like gettin' shot in his
own house. Maybe that's why he left.
78.
RAY
That was an accident.
T.J.
Some accident you shot him in the foot.
RAY
He spent the food money on scratch cards,
T.J.
T.J.
So, he'd done it before.
He aims it at her. She walks towards him. He increases
the flame.
RAY
Gimme that thing.
She tries to grab it out of his hand, but he is too
strong.
RAY (CONT'D)
T.J. come on now.
T.J.
You can't have it. It's mine.
His eyes fill with tears, but his face stays tight.
She grabs at it again, but he jerks it away. She pauses
and stares at him.
RAY
He was clean for 23 months.
They look at one another.
RAY (CONT'D)
(chokes back tears)
I didn't know how else to keep us
together. I mean...he's a good dad when
he's not gamblin'.
He cuts off the blow torch.
T.J.
Yeah, awesome dad. Robs us and takes off
a week before Christmas.
She walks up to him and wipes a tear from the side of his
face. He shakes it off.
79.
They stand in the cold air for a long moment their breath
visible. She touches his hair.
RAY
I know.
CUT TO:
108
108
Ray drives up in the Acclaim. Lila and the Horizon are
gone.
Ray gets out and looks around but there is no sign of
her.
109
109
Ray slowly cruises the lot looking for the Horizon.
She spots it in the distance behind the Bingo palace next
to a dumpster.
Ray parks and goes inside.
110
110
The short chubby toothless Mohawk ticket taker perched on
a metal stool beside a velvet rope.
Ray sees her and begins to dig in her jeans for a five.
The ticket taker looks her up and down, expressionless.
Ray hands over the money. The ticket taker just looks at
her.
TICKET TAKER
The game's over. They're verifying the
last winner.
RAY
That's okay. I still wanna buy a ticket.
TICKET TAKER
I can't sell you one.
RAY
I got money.
80.
TICKET TAKER
Sorry.
RAY
I just want to buy some scratch cards.
TICKET TAKER
Go to Wolf Mart, they sell `um there.
Ray walks away. The ticket taker watches her.
111
DAY
111
Ray slumps down in the driver's seat of the Acclaim
waiting for Lila to come out. She is parked a few cars
away from the Horizon.
Other bingo players come out and get in cars surrounding
Ray.
Mohawks employees, including Lila come out of the
"Employees Entrance". She starts toward Horizon. She
wears new glasses.
Catching sight of Ray in the Acclaim, she abruptly turns
and starts walking in the opposite direction.
Ray pulls out and drives over following her in the
Acclaim.
LILA
I quit smuggling.
RAY
(rolls down the window)
T.J. set the trailer on fire.
Lila keeps walking. Ray drives along beside her.
RAY (CONT'D)
He didn't mean to, but the pipes froze
and he got that damn torch out -- which I
told him not to do touch when I wasn't
there -- and he tried to thaw them out-
LILA
I got glasses and now I can see up close.
RAY
There's a hole in my bedroom floor. We
gotta move.
81.
Lila keeps walking.
RAY (CONT'D)
I just need one more run to get the
double.
Lila keeps walking.
RAY (CONT'D)
Look you can have the Acclaim. Okay?
Lila keeps walking.
LILA
I don't want it.
RAY
What is it then?!
Lila keeps walking.
RAY (CONT'D)
Are you still mad about that baby? `Cause
it wasn't all my fault, ya' know. I mean
who puts their kid in a duffle bag?
Lila keeps walking. Ray follows trying to figure her out.
RAY (CONT'D)
You're gonna need a lot of money to take
care of a one year old baby.
LILA
I got enough.
RAY
Yeah, but you gotta get him first.
Lila stops dead in her tracks and looks at Ray.
RAY (CONT'D)
I'll help you. You can even borrow my
gun.
Lila looks around to see if anyone is watching and gets
in the Acclaim with Ray.
ANGLE FROM BINGO PALACE ENTRANCE: The Ticket Taker
watches the Acclaim drive away.
82.

112
Ray and Lila pull up outside the model double wide home.
113
NIGHT
116
Jimmy's is dark. Ray and Lila sit a minute. Then:
LILA
Blow the horn.
Ray honks the horn.
A light comes on. Jimmy runs outside in a t-shirt. Lila
rolls down the window.
JIMMY
Heat wave!
LILA
You got a run for us, Jimmy?
JIMMY
(shakes his head)
It's pretty slow after Christmas. Unless
you wanna to go off the Rez, there's a
guy up in Montreal who's usually got
heads.
LILA
How far?
JIMMY
Twenty miles or so. But...you gotta watch
out for the Mounties and the Surete.
and...this guy deals in ya' know girls.
117
-
SAME
117
Ray and Lila drive down a Quebec highway. The road signs
are in French.
The skyline of Montreal is an orange glow in the far
distance.
RAY
Have you ever been there?
LILA
A few times. Have you?
RAY
No, Troy didn't like to travel. He liked
to work in his shed, mostly.
85.
Ray and Lila drive down a commercial strip of shopping
centers, fast food joints and strip clubs, with French
names.
LILA
Up there. That's it.
RAY
Can't miss that.
118
118
Ray pulls in at a giant neon silhouette of a naked woman.
They drive around back and get out. THROBBING DISCO music
is heard from inside a door marked "Prive."
119
120
They wait.
BRUNO
D'at your car?
He points to the Acclaim parked a few feet away. They
nod. He walks out to a shed and unlocks the door. Two
very young CHINESE GIRLS, sickly and pale, wearing jean
jackets look vacantly out.
Bruno signals them to get out.
BRUNO (CONT'D)
Open the trunk.
LILA
We need to get paid, first.
BRUNO
Oh, yes.
He pulls a wad of cash from inside his coat and hands it
to Lila. She counts it out.
LILA
You only got six hundred here.
BRUNO
You get the rest at drop off.
LILA
It's six hundred apiece.
The girls stand shivering by the trunk.
87.
BRUNO
That's the deal I make with Jimmy, now
you want to change?
Lila and Ray look at each other.
LILA
It's twelve hundred.
BRUNO
You want to make a problem?
Bruno glances at the Bartender watching from the back
door of the club.
BRUNO (CONT'D)
(annoyed by Ray)
...because you're not making a problem
for me. And you're making a problem for
them. Let me show you something.
He approaches the two girls.
He grabs one of the girls by the hair, kicks her in the
back of the knees forcing her to the ground.
Lila looks at Ray. The girl tries to get on her feet, but
each time she does he kicks her in the back of the knees
again.
LILA
(to Ray)
Let's just go.
Held up by her hair, the girl slides around helplessly.
Lila winces at the sight. Ray stares at Bruno.
RAY
Okay. We'll take them.
Lila looks at Ray.
Bruno drops the girl who scrambles to her feet.
LILA
Let's go.
RAY
Just open the trunk.
Lila leans into the passenger side of the Acclaim and
pops the trunk. Bruno looks at Ray:
88.
BRUNO
You must be the brains of the operation.
He motions the girls into the trunk and shuts it after
them.
Lila get in the passenger side and Bruno starts for the
back door of the club.
Ray pulls her gun out of her jacket and aims it at Bruno.
RAY
Turn around!
Bruno stops and turns around.
RAY (CONT'D)
I want the rest.
He opens his fur coat.
BRUNO
(cool)
I don't have any more.
In the shiny coat lining only the handle of a long pistol
is visible.
RAY
(to the Bartender)
Go get it.
Bruno looks around and nods at the bartender. The
bartender panics not knowing what to do and begins
speaking in French to Bruno.
Ray shoots at the pavement beside Bruno.
BRUNO
(to the bartender)
Give it to her.
The Bartender disappears into the club. Ray waits with
the gun on Bruno.
LILA
(from inside the Acclaim)
Let's get out of here. I'll give you the
rest of the money.
RAY
No. But thanks.
89.
LILA
You're gonna get us all killed.
A moment later the Bartender comes back, shaking and
holding cash.
RAY
Put it there.
She indicates the trunk.
BRUNO
(to the bartender)
You aren't so smart as you look.
Ray grabs the money and still pointing at Bruno, backs
into the car.
Bruno reaches for his pistol and aims at them as the
Acclaim squeals away.
Bruno FIRES shattering the driver's side window, grazing
Ray's head.
Ray falls back, dazed for a moment. Lila steers. Then Ray
takes the wheel as they swerve out onto the main road.
RAY
He shot me.
Ray wipes the blood from her forehead.
LILA
You should'a just taken the money from
me?
RAY
(blood streams down her face)
I'm tired of people stealing from me.
Is
it all there?
LILA
We gotta get outta here, first.
RAY
Just COUNT IT and make sure it's all
there!
Ray hands her the wad of money. Lila struggles to put on
her glasses and counts out the money.
RAY (CONT'D)
Is it there?
90.
LILA
It's all there.
RAY
Good.
LILA
Slow down a little. We gotta keep it
under the speed limit.
Ray smiles and wipes away the blood.
They drive a short distance. Ray checks the rear-view
mirror.
LILA (CONT'D)
We gotta get off this road.
Lila looks in the rear view. Headlights appear behing
them.
Ray speeds up approaching an intersection: the sign reads
"ARRET"
LILA (CONT'D)
Slow down!
RAY
I can't.
Lila looks back in the rear view mirror. The headlights
are gaining on them.
She SPEEDS through it.
A local SURETE DE QUEBEC police cruiser parked out of
sight TAKES OFF after her, LIGHTS FLASHING.
121
122
Ray swerves off the main road to a DIRT ROAD. The Qubec
police follow.
Ray swerves off the road and across a field into the
WOODS and kills the HEADLIGHTS.
The Quebec Cruiser CHASES them.
91.
123
124
The Acclaim emerges from the woods at the edge of the
river. The International Seaway Bridge looms above the
ice surface of the river.
125
126
Behind them, the Quebec cruiser BRAKES at the edge of the
river.
92.
The Qubec officer GETS OUT TO WATCH the Acclaim drive
out across the ice. He radios to:
127
127
A BORDER GUARD picks up the phone. He nods, then hangs up
and makes a call to...
128
130
The CAR SINKS DEEPER INTO THE WATER on one side.
131
131
Ray, Lila and the Chinese girls keep running, slipping
and sliding, falling. Lila and Ray stop and go back to
help one of the Chinese girls who keeps falling.
When they get to the shore, they climb up the bank and
collapse on the snow, gasping.
ANGLE: Trooper Napoli gets in his cruiser and heads down
the bank toward the women, lights flashing.
132
132
Two headlights are seen in the distance coming toward
them. A PICKUP TRUCK approaches along the shore.
Jimmy drives it. He gets out, gathers Ray, Lila and the
two Chinese girls into the back of the truck and drives
away.
Ray looks back as the Acclaim SLIPS THROUGH THE ICE AND
DISAPPEARS.
Trooper Napoli reaches the scene, too late. No one is
there.
133
137
Two New York State Cruisers block the road, lights
flashing.
138
140
Ray shuts the door behind her and starts toward the
river. She turns and runs along the bank...a long
way...then slows down. Breathing hard, she stops. Snow
melts on her face. A long moment passes.
The sound of the river ice pushing against the bank
releases a long, deep moan all around her.
141
143
Flashing dome lights of New York State troopers are seen
just beyond the sign "YOU ARE NOW LEAVING THE LAND OF THE
MOHAWK." Trooper Napoli waits in his cruiser with other
vehicles.
Billy drives Ray and the Chinese girls slowly toward them
in the Mohawk Tribal Police Cruiser.
Billy stops and the three get out of the car, handcuffed.
144
144
Bernie waits in the car. Lila walks to the front door.
Thunder looks up from beside the front step.
LILA
(shows her empty hands)
Sorry, Thunder, I got nothing for you.
She knocks.
Evelyn opens the door. Seeing Lila she tries to close it,
but Lila WEDGES herself inside.
145
146
Bernie stands by the car holding a CAR SEAT.
BERNIE
She's gonna kill me for taking this out
of her car.
CUT TO:
147
150
A Semi ROARS down the road with "WIDE LOAD" banner
hauling a single wide mobile home through the bright
morning light, plastic covering rippling in the wind.
151
151
Using the blow torch, T.J. works on the smiling duck
Kiddie ride.
106.
Ricky plays with Little Jake, dressed in a snow suit.
Lila comes outside with a plate of peanut butter
sandwiches, badly made.
T.J. signals Ricky who brings Little Jake over and puts
him on the Kiddie ride. Ricky holds him on the seat and
T.J. flips a switch. The ride JERKS a few times then
starts to move back and fourth. Little Jake smiles.
Behind T.J. a Mohawk Tribal Police Cruiser drives up.
Billy Two Rivers gets out and walks up to T.J.
He speaks sternly to T.J., pointing at the cruiser where
an elderly and frail Mohawk women in her eighties, Mrs.
ThreeRivers, looks out the window.
T.J. walks over to the cruiser. She rolls down the
window. He says something to her, looking at the ground
as he speaks.
Ricky and Lila holding Little Jake look on.
Billy Two Rivers drives away.
SUDDENLY T.J. and Ricky LOOK UP. A RUMBLE is heard in the
distance. From down the road the SEMI is seen
APPROACHING...
T.J. smiles and Ricky watches not sure whether to believe
it or not. He takes T.J.'s hand.
CUT TO:

A sign reads "Bridge to Canada."
A steep 1940's era customs bridge arches over the St.
Lawrence River.
Cars and trucks line up in different lanes. Customs
officials man booths at the center of the bridge,
inspecting and questioning impatient drivers.
Beyond them, a smaller sign: "THANK YOU FOR VISITING
MASSENA NEW YORK, IT WORKS, for business, for family, for
you".

The river stretches miles in either direction, no longer
frozen and still with trees on either side.
