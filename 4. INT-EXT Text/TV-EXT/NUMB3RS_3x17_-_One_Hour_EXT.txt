  A beautiful day on a beautiful block; large houses and lawns 
  being watered, sprinklers hissing...

  ... and JO, a 11 (or 12) year-old Hispanic boy, pedals his 
  bicycle down the street.  Tossing newspapers on one lawn 
  after another...

  A BLACK MAXIMA

  trails behind him.  Crawling slowly, almost predatory; inside 
  are RICO and CARLOS, two formidable looking Hispanics, early 
  20 s, in dark suits.


  Jo throwing more papers... the MAXIMA following... Jo throws 
  a paper that lands in a

  DRIVEWAY --

  where a Hummer H2 is parked.  DUQUE (Hispanic, 30's) behind 
  the wheel, MALONEY (White, 20's) riding shotgun.

  They let Jo pedal past, then the Hummer H2 backs out; heavy 
  wheels rolling over the newspaper --




                                                                          (CONTINUED)   NUMB3RS  317/54  "One Hour"  GOLDENROD Rev   2/07/07    3.

  -- stopping crosswise in the street...

  THE MAXIMA --

  brakes to a halt... RICO starting to open the passenger 
  door...

  JO --

  turns at the sound of screeching brakes, stops pedaling...

  DUQUE AND MALONEY --

  jump out of the Hummer H2.  Duque sprints after Jo --

                              RICO
                Hey --

  Rico reaching into his jacket --

  -- as Maloney pulls up an M-4 ASSAULT RIFLE and opens fire on 
  the bodyguards.  Bullets stitch across the windshield, 
  killing CARLOS behind the wheel...

  ... hitting Rico as well.  He drops halfway out the door, a 
  BERETTA falling out of his hand.

  JO --

  starts pedaling again as Duque sprints after him; the bicycle 
  wobbling with panic as Duque catches up --

  -- yanking Jo off.  Maloney rolls the Hummer H2 up behind 
  them, passenger door still open; Duque tosses the kid inside 
  and jumps in after him.

  The Hummer H2 speeds off, crushing the bicycle in its wake.


  The early stages of a crime scene -- crime scene tape going 
  up, UNIFORMS blocking off the street --

  -- COLBY and DAVID conferring with a DETECTIVE.

                                DETECTIVE

  Nodding at CHE LOBO, 40's, Hispanic, talking with the cops.  
  Looking hostile and agitated.

                Major Latin hip-hop label.

                  Narcotics, Organized Crime, and the 
                Gang Unit.

                              COLBY

                He came up as 18 Street Mexicali; 
                not hard to guess where his music

                on his payroll.  Both of the 
                  bodyguards have gang tats.

  A CELL PHONE rings somewhere --

  Megan scans the files again, then --

    A pissed-off David grabs the phone, slaps it into Lobo's hand

                              COLBY 
                Two years nursing a grudge and 
                planning a kidnapping.

                              CHE LOBO
                After I get Jo back, I'm going to 
                hunt him down and finish this.

                              COLBY
                No... I'm going to lock him up.  
                And you're going to let me.

  The PAY PHONE RINGS -- and the two men freeze.  Colby speaks 
  into his earmike --

                              COLBY (CONT'D)
                We set?


  Colby nods to Lobo, who takes the BAG OF MONEY, walks over to 
  the pay phone and answers it... we INTERCUT everyone 
    listening...

                              CHE LOBO
                Yeah.

                              JO (V.O.)
                Dad?

                              CHE LOBO
                Jo... it's going to be okay --

                              DUQUE (V.O.)
                The next call is going to cost you 
                3.2.

                              CHE LOBO
                Duque, so help me --

                              DUQUE (V.O.)
                So the big man didn t forget -- I 
                was wondering if you'd wake up.
                      (voice modulator switches 
                        off)
                You've got three minutes to run 
                your ass to Olvera Street.  
                Phone'll be ringing.

  Duque hangs up.


                              COLBY
                      (into ear mike)
                Glad I stretched this morning.

  Colby takes the bag from Lobo --

                              CHE LOBO
                What re you doing --

                              COLBY
                You show up at the drop, he's going 
                to kill you.  I show up, he might 
                settle for the money.

                              CHE LOBO
                He might kill you, too.

                              COLBY
                Yeah... doesn't seem fair, does it.

  Colby grabs the bag and STARTS RUNNING...


                              END OF ACT THREE   NUMB3RS  317/54  "One Hour"  GOLDENROD Rev   2/07/07    41.




                                    ACT FOUR


  As COLBY pushes his way through crowded street stands, toward 
  a RINGING PAY PHONE --

                              COLBY
                      (into mike)
                See anything?

  ON LIZ WARNER'S CAR --50A50A

  parked with a view of Colby --

                              LIZ WARNER
                Nothing so far.

  ON DAVID --50B50B

  Playing customer and watching -- TWO OF THE OTHER AGENTS also 
  in street clothes, also blending --

                              DAVID
                Lot of people -- he could be 
                standing right next to us -- 

  ON COLBY --50C50C

  answering the phone --

                              COLBY
                Yeah --

                              DUQUE (V.O.)
                Granger, right?  Figured that 
                yellow bastard would hide behind 
                some kind of cops.
                      (beat)
                Just remember that you re nothing I 
                didn t plan for.

                              COLBY
                I want to talk to --

                              DUQUE (V.O.) 
                  Keyerleber Plaza.  You've got two 
                minutes -- and stop and give your 
                gun to the pretty girl in the black 
                sedan, then tell her to drive away.  
                                (MORE)



                                                                          (CONTINUED)   NUMB3RS  317/54  "One Hour"  GOLDENROD Rev   2/07/07    42.

    CONTINUED:50C50C
                              DUQUE (V.O.)  (CONT'D)
                I see her again, I kill the kid and 
                disappear.

  Duque hangs up.  Colby starts running again --

                              COLBY
                      (into mike)
                He made Liz.


  David and the AGENTS race toward the end of the alley --

                              DAVID
                Already going.


  As COLBY runs for a RINGING PAY PHONE next to the FOUNTAIN --

  DAVID'S CAR --56A56A

  rolls up --

                              DAVID
                We've got you.

                              COLBY
                Next time you run and I drive...

  Colby grabs the phone --

                              DUQUE (V.O.)
                Throw the bag in the fountain.

  Colby looks around -- then hurls the bag into the fountain...

  ON DAVID --56B56B

  scanning the area as well -- no one seems to be reacting --

                              DUQUE (V.O.)
                Got a second wind?

                              COLBY
                No...

                              DUQUE (V.O.)
                Get the bag out of the water -- 
                you ve got two minutes to get to 
                the Union Station waiting room. 

  As Colby hangs up the phone -- reaches into the fountain to 
  grab the bag --

                              DAVID
                What the hell was that about?

                              COLBY
                He just shorted out the GPS tracer.

  And Colby is running again...   NUMB3RS  317/54  "One Hour"  GOLDENROD Rev   2/07/07    45.




  As an FBI SUV pulls up -- the back door opens, Jo running 
  out...

  ... into the arms of Che Lobo.  Lobo squeezes him, closes his 
  eyes to fight back a tear...

  ... looks up to see COLBY standing there.

                              CHE LOBO
                I know we go back to our corners 
                  tomorrow... cops and robbers...
                      (beat)
                ... but I owe you one.  Any time 
                you want to call it in, no 
                  questions asked.

                              COLBY
                      (smiles)
                See you tomorrow.   NUMB3RS  317/54  "One Hour"  GOLDENROD Rev   2/07/07    58.
