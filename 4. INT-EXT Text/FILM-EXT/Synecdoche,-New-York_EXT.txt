Caden steps out the front door in his bare feet and hurries
down the driveway in the rain. He picks up the newspaper,
pulls the mail from the box. As he heads back inside, he
flips through the mail. There's a magazine called Attending
to your Illness addressed to Caden. A diseased person on the
cover. Across the street a gaunt man watches Caden, unseen.
Caden has the phone to his ear. He's squinting in the bright
sunlight, pupils dilated. The gaunt man watches him unseen.
CADEN
Dr. Heshborg said I should see Dr.
Scariano. My pupils don't work.
Caden sits sadly on the steps; drinks coffee. He watches as
Hazel pulls into the parking lot, gets out of her car. The
gaunt man is behind the trash bin. She sits next to Caden.
CADEN
It's a nightmare in there.

Hazel studies the dog. It's a bloody, gutty mess, squashed
flat. Against all odds, it's still alive. Its head is
lolling. She bends down to pet it.
HAZEL
You're not going to make it, baby.
Hazel gets out of her car and walks up to a neat little house
on a street of neat little houses. Faint swirls of smoke
escape from the windows. She rings the doorbell. The button
is hot; Hazel pulls her finger away.
Caden and Olive walk along. Caden holds a tax envelope. His
face has pustules on it. The gaunt man follows.
OLIVE
What's wrong with your face, Daddy?
CADEN
It's pustules. It's called
sycosis. Spelled differently than
psychosis, but it sounds the same.
OLIVE

Caden sits nursing a coffee. Maria approaches and sits down.

Caden stares at her for a moment, then lunges. He punches
her repeatedly as she tries to get away. She throws a punch
which connects with the side of his head and knocks him down.
She hurries off.

She turns down an alley. Caden, a half-block behind, hurries
to the alley. She's gone. He walks through, looking for
her. It's dark. Trash cans and garbage. He spots an
unopened box next to the trash. It's pink with a picture of
a nose on it. Caden drops to his knees and weeps. No tears

artificial tears from his pockets and moistens his eyes.

Caden sits in the fluorescent shelter. He looks at a poster
for a movie called Little Winky and Caden, which features
Caden in an embrace with a muscular skinhead. The movie is

HAZEL'S ANSWERING MACHINE
It's Hazel. Leave a message or
don't. Your dime.
CADEN
My love. I know how to do the
play. It'll take place over the
course of one day. The day will be
the day before you died, the
happiest day of my life. I'll be
able to relive it forever.
Caden weeps inconsolably at the director's table, Michael the
pre-Hazel assistant is back, neat and efficient-looking, but
old now. Hazel's dog, Squishy, sleeps on the floor. The
scene in the play is dull. People walk back and forth
aimlessly. Various passersby on the street have hacking
coughs. Tammy steps out of the bathroom, meanders over to
the director's table. Hazel's sweater is on Michael's chair-
back. She casually pulls it off and tries it on. Caden
watches. She looks so much like Hazel now, it's unbearable.
He looks away. Millicent walks by carrying a mop and bucket.
CADEN
I need a Caden for my Hazel.
MILLICENT
I... I'd very much like to play
Caden.
CADEN
Um...

Tammy watches intently. Millicent smiles at her.

MILLICENT
I know it would be non-traditional
casting, but I think I'm right for
it. I think I understand Caden.
CADEN
I don't understand him.
MILLICENT
Caden Cotard is a man already dead,
living in a half-world between
stasis and antistasis. Time is
concentrated and chronology
confused for him. Up until
recently he has strived valiantly
to make sense of his situation, but
now he has turned to stone.
CADEN
Okay. That sounds good.
MICHAEL
She's right? I didn't see that at
all. I saw it all as more hopeful.
NIGHT
Caden sits with Michael at the director's table and stares
into space. The actors are doing what they've always done,
milling, walking to and fro. Millicent, holding hands with
Tammy, heads up the walk to the Hazel's house set.
CADEN
Millicent.
She turns. He waves her over. Tammy sits on the stoop.
CADEN (CONT'D)
That was ... spectacular.
MICHAEL
It really was! Delightful!
MILLICENTCADEN
Thanks.I'm out of ideas. I'm dead.
MILLICENT
Oh. I... could take over... as
you... for a bit. Until you feel
refreshed.
MICHAEL
Yes! Yes!
Caden, looks sideways at Michael, remains silent.

I think you're tired, Caden.Yes. I think you just need
All these years of creative some time. To regroup.
work.
CADEN
I need to keep my hand in.
MILLICENT
Well, Ellen needs to be filled.
CADEN
Filled? You mean...?
MILLICENT MICHAEL
Her role. Just for a bit. It's a choice role. Just
until you're refreshed.
CADEN (CONT'D)
(BEAT)
I do like to clean.
It's spring and a ten year old girl watches her mother as she
lays out a picnic on a blanket on the ground.
MOTHER
Ellen, why do you look so serious?
ELLEN
I'm going to remember this moment
for the rest of my life, mama. And
in exactly twenty years, come here
with my daughter and have exactly
the same picnic.
MOTHER
Baby, that's the loveliest thing
I've ever heard.

No lights. Vague daylight drifts in from high warehouse
windows, from which cardboard has fallen. Deadly quiet,
abandoned. Caden passes the occasional body on the street.
Fires smolder in buildings. The streets are flooded with
sewer water. Buildings are draped with massive tarps. Behind
a fence are piles of bodies.
He passes the Hazel's House set, burnt to the ground.
He arrives at the warehouse set and enters.
2055 - MORNING
Deserted here too. The same occasional fires, flooding, dead
bodies.
- 2055 - MORNING
Caden walks, soon arriving at the warehouse set within the
warehouse set. He enters.
WAREHOUSE SET) - 2055 - MORNING
Another dark, deserted street, more bodies, fires, floods.
Caden panics. He pulls out his earpiece, shakes it, and puts
it back. He walks.
WITHIN-WAREHOUSE SET) - 2055
He arrives at the warehouse within the warehouse within the
warehouse. He enters.

WAREHOUSE-WITHIN-WAREHOUSE SET) - 2055 - DAY
Deserted. Caden walks. He gets in a golf cart and drives
through the deserted street sets.
WAREHOUSE-WITHIN-WAREHOUSE SET) - 2055 - CONTINUOUS
Caden reaches the beach set, and drives the cart on the sand.
He sees footprints. He gets out and follows them, spots a
woman ahead walking with a suitcase. He hurries as much as
he can with his limp, his weakness, his ancient body, to
catch up with her.
CADEN
Hello.
The woman turns. She's middle-aged, face radiating kindness.
CADEN (CONT'D)
Where is everybody?
WOMAN
Mostly dead. Some have left.
CADEN
Would you sit with me for a moment?
I'm very tired. And lonely.
The woman smiles at Caden. They sit on a log.
CADEN (CONT'D)
I feel like I know you.
WOMAN
I was the mother in Ellen's dream.
Perhaps from there.
CADEN
Yes! That's it. Yes. You seem a
bit older than I remember.
WOMAN
(CHUCKLING)
That dream was quite a while ago.
He's silent. The woman touches his hand.
CADEN
I didn't mean to say you look old.

WOMAN
I know.
CADEN
Everyone's dreams in all those
apartments. All those secrets
we'll never know. That's the truth
of it -- all the thoughts nobody
will ever know.
WOMAN
It's true.
CADEN
I'm sorry the experiment didn't
work. I wanted it to with all my
heart. I wanted to do that picnic
with my daughter. I feel I've
disappointed you terribly.
WOMAN
No. No. I am so proud of you.
Caden starts to tear up.
CADEN
All I want is someone to see me,
someone to look at me with
kindness. For me to be the most
special person in the world to just
one person.
WOMAN
I know, baby. I know.
He looks at her tentatively. She's looking into his eyes
directly, clearly, kindly. She smiles.
WOMAN (CONT'D)
You're going to be fine.
Caden starts to weep so hard he chokes. Strings of snot pour
from his nose. The woman holds him, gently takes off his
wig, and strokes his sparse hair. He looks out over her
shoulder at the dark empty city at the far end of the
warehouse. His rheumy eyes light up.
CADEN
I know what to do with this play
now. I have an idea. I think --
The screen goes black fast.
