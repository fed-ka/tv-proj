We are in a shadowy cave.  CANDLES burn before an ALTAR 
featuring a winged, LION-HEADED FIGURE with twin serpents 
coiled around it.  An AGING TURKISH MAN sits before it, 
motioning to a water pipe.  

AL-RAHIM
Will you smoke with me, DaVinci?

LEONARDO DAVINCI (25), fit and handsome, sits opposite him.

DAVINCI
That depends on what s in the pipe.

AL-RAHIM
A mixture of tobacco and black 
hellebore.  The flower is mildly 
poisonous and is rumored to induce 
visions and summon demons. 

DAVINCI
I believe in neither.

AL-RAHIM
Then why do you struggle so hard to 
keep them both at bay?
(off DaVinci s unease)
Demons exist.  You d be wise to 
embrace them.

Al-Rahim brings the mouth-piece to his lips and inhales 
deeply.  He then passes it to DaVinci, who follows suit.  

AL-RAHIM (CONT D)
History is a lie that has been 
honed like a weapon by people who 
have suppressed the truth.  
Centuries from now, your own 
history will also be suppressed. 

DAVINCI
To what end?

AL-RAHIM
The knowledge you are destined to 
learn will upend the established 
order of things.2.


DAVINCI
How could you possibly know that?

AL-RAHIM
You ve heard the phrase  time is a 
river ?  What most fail to grasp is 
that the river is circular.  In 
this way, the future is a book that 
can be read like any other.  
(beat)
One man s death opens the doorway 
for the birth of the next.  Would 
you like to know how this 
particular doorway opened?

DaVinci slowly nods, apprehensive.  Al-Rahim seems pleased.

AL-RAHIM (CONT D)
Be forewarned, then.  Some doorways 
lead into darkness.



A NAKED MAN pisses into a chamber pot.  This is GALEAZZO 
SFORZA (30s), Duke of Milan.  Nursing a hangover.  Sforza 
yawns and pulls back a curtain, flooding the room with light. 

ON THE CANOPIED BED,

A TEENAGED BOY tangled in the sheets.  Sforza whisks them 
away, tossing some crumpled clothes at him.

SFORZA
Out you go, boy!  Get on with you!

The boy quickly gathers his things and hustles towards the 
bedchamber door.  But as he reaches for the handle --

SFORZA (CONT D)
Not that way, fool!  Would you have 
the entire household know I m 
buggering the Cardinal s nephew?  

Sforza pulls on a mounted bracket, opening a spring-latched 
panel leading to a SECRET PASSAGE at the back of the room.  3.


As the boy slips into the passage, Sforza SLAPS him on the 
rump.  Then, as an afterthought, he flings some coins at him.  
Sforza closes the panel and opens the bedchamber door.

SFORZA (CONT D)
CICCO!

CICCO SIMONETTA (60s), the Duke s sober chancellor appears.

SFORZA (CONT D)
What day is it?

CICCO
December 26th.

Sforza blinks back at him, uncomprehending.

CICCO (CONT D)
St. Stephen s Day.  High Mass was 
to commence ten minutes ago.  The 
Duchess and your children are 
already waiting at the Church.  

SFORZA
Balls.  
(hopefully)
Could you round me up some coddled 
eggs?  I have a beastly hangover 
and my bowels are in a tumble. 

Cicco responds with a withering stare.  Sforza relents.

SFORZA (CONT D)
Right.  Be dressed in but a moment.

The Duke steps away and we note a RING on Cicco s finger, 
bearing the same lion-headed figure that was on the altar.



As CHURCHGOERS enter, they are frisked for weapons at the 
door.  Among them; THREE NOBLEMEN, who appear to have nothing 
on them other than their MISSALS and a CRUCIFIX.  

The men open their missals.  Each missal contains a thin, 
METAL PAGE with a triangular design stamped into it.  The men 
pop the triangles from the pages like puzzle pieces.  4.


Then, with practiced efficiency, the pieces are snapped 
together to form a PYRAMIDAL-SHAPED DAGGER BLADE.

VISCONTI, the group s leader, removes his crucifix and screws 
it into the base of the blade, creating the dagger s  hilt .

SFORZA (O.S.)
At ease, people!  I ve arrived!

All heads turn as Sforza enters.  He smiles, glad-handing -- 
avoiding eye-contact with his furious wife, BONA.  As he 
nears the Point of the Innocents, Visconti approaches as if 
to embrace him.  Sforza waves him off, whispering:

SFORZA (CONT D)
Begone, you artless fuckwit.  This 
is my moment.

VISCONTI
And thanks to the Secret Archives, 
it s the last you will ever enjoy!

Visconti THRUSTS the dagger into Sforza s throat.  Sforza 
sinks to his knees, BLOOD fountaining from his throat.  As 
Sforza s bodyguards rush forward, mayhem consumes the church.



The rider is lead by SERVANTS through the bustling courtyard --



-- into an inner-sanctum housing scores of CLERKS.  This is 
the heart of the Medici banking empire.  Abaci beads CLACK as 
COINS are counted, recorded in ledgers, and stored in caskets.  

ANGLE ON LORENZO MEDICI (30), 

de facto ruler of Florence.  Despite having the face of a 
boxer, Lorenzo is a shrewd and sober man, who dresses simply.

His brother, GIULIANO (26), is the opposite; handsome, 
dashing, flamboyant.  Hovering between these two polarities is 
GENTILE BECCHI (50s), Lorenzo s humorless advisor.  

The rider presents Lorenzo with a wax sealed scroll.  Lorenzo 
reads it, then erupts from his chair, KICKING OVER a chest.

LORENZO
Out!  OUT!!!  All of you!

The money counters exit.  Lorenzo paces, grave.

LORENZO (CONT D)
The Duke of Milan is dead.  
Assassinated.

BECCHI
By whose hand?11.


LORENZO
Visconti and two others.  

GIULIANO
(derisively)
An honor killing, then.  They say 
the Duke deflowered his niece.  
Sforza was a pig of epic appetites.

LORENZO
But he was our pig.  And his armies 
were the only thing keeping Rome s 
ambitions in check.  
(shaking his head)
This was no honor killing.  I sense 
the Vatican s hand behind this.   

BECCHI
If you re right, this will upset the 
balance of power in Italy, Lorenzo.

LORENZO
Upset?  My God, Becchi.  This all 
but decapitates the concept and 
shits down its throat! 

Lorenzo collapses back into his chair, disheartened.

LORENZO (CONT D)
We need to shore up public support.  
Carnival is nearly upon us.

GIULIANO
Drunken revelry?  That s how we 
handle this?

BECCHI
The bigger the celebration, the 
stronger we appear.  It s all part 
of the pantomime.

LORENZO
Pageantry s all well and good, but if 
our pomp has no teeth behind it, we 
might as well slit our own throats.  

SIXTUS (PRELAP)
Are you frightened?



POPE SIXTUS IV (60s), avaricious and corpulent, with a face 
like a manatee, floats in a bath of rose petals.  12.


A YOUNG MAN rests in the water alongside him.  Sixtus has a 
delicate knife pressed against the poor youth s throat.   

YOUNG MAN
No, Most Holy Father.

SIXTUS
Lying is a sin, my dear boy.  It 
separates us from God s grace.

YOUNG MAN
I -- 
(correcting himself)
Yes, I m frightened --

Sixtus reaches his free hand between the boy-man s legs. 

SIXTUS
But that s also a lie, isn t it?  
At least, a partial one.  A venial 
sin, perhaps.  
(pressing the knife deeper)
So which statement is correct?

Now the youth is terrified.  He doesn t know how to answer.

SIXTUS (CONT D)
Speak, child.  Don t you wish to 
enter Heaven?

The youth stammers, dry-mouthed.  Sixtus  eyes are alight 
with mischievous delight.  He moves his face closer to the 
youth s, until their lips are nearly touching, and whispers:

SIXTUS (CONT D)
The proper answer would be --

Just then, we hear a COMMOTION outside the room as --

SWISS GUARD (O.S.)
Your Graces, his Holiness has 
forbidden --

-- the DOORS BURST OPEN and THREE MEN enter, having bullied 
their way past the SWISS MERCENARIES standing guard. 

First is COUNT RIARIO (30s), nephew of Sixtus.  Handsome, 
sadistic, suffering from the kind of insecurity endemic to 
those recently vaulted into society s ranks.  Then --

FRANCESCO PAZZI (30s), Papal banker.  Short, slender, and 
pale.  A schemer who perceives insult at every turn.  

Next is LUPO MERCURI (50s), Curator of the Secret Archives.  13.


MERCURI
Our men succeeded!  Sforza s dead.  

At this, Sixtus removes the knife, heaving his bulk from the 
bath like a walrus beaching itself on a rocky shoal.  Mercuri 
and the others seem unfazed by what they ve stumbled in on.

FRANCESCO
Florence is ripe for the picking, 
your Eminence.  Trust me.  

SIXTUS
And you know this how, Franceso --?

RIARIO
We have an agent within Lorenzo s 
ranks.  The Medicis are desperate.  
They ve increased the carnival 
budget tenfold in a pathetic bid to 
win the peoples  favor. 
(forcefully)
They re weak, your Holiness!  This 
is your chance to strike.    

SIXTUS
Not mine, nephew.  The Lord s.

RIARIO
Of course.  Forgive the imprecision 
of my words.  

MERCURI
There is another reason for haste.  
(off their looks)
The Turk has arrived in Florence.  
He s after the Book of Leaves.    

The news galvanizes Sixtus.  He nods, shrugging on a robe, 
hurrying from the chambers.  After a beat, Riario looks to --

-- the youth, sunk low in the bath, trying to make himself 
inconspicuous.

RIARIO
I m sorry. 

YOUNG MAN
Why --?

RIARIO
Because you can t have heard this.  

Riario picks up the knife and SLASHES the boy s throat.  14.


The boy sinks face-first amongst the rose petals, his BLOOD 
spreading like an ink blot.



An industrious workshop manned by APPRENTICES, crowded with 
easels, sculptor s turntables, and firing kilns.  

ANDREA  TRUE EYE  VERROCCHIO (40S),

DaVinci s mentor and friend, hovers at the back.  He seems 
pained and apologetic, doing his best to appease --

-- Gentile Becchi and Giuliano Medici, who look annoyed.

GIULIANO
Do you have the plans for the 
columbina or not?

VERROCCHIO
We do.  And they re breathtaking.  
I put my finest man on the job. 

BECCHI
Then produce these miraculous 
renderings and let us evaluate them. 

VERROCCHIO
Unfortunately, I can t.

GIULIANO
Because they don t exist!  

Giuliano grabs Verrocchio by his collar, drawing him close.

GIULIANO (CONT D)
By God, man, if you think you can 
defraud the House of Medici --  

VERROCCHIO
No, no, no, they exist, I promise 
you!  They re in this chest!

Verrocchio gestures to a LARGE TRUNK, secured at the front 
with an elaborate, multi-dial COMBINATION LOCK.15.


BECCHI
Open it.

VERROCCHIO
I can t.  It s locked.

GIULIANO
(unsheathing his sword)
Then I ll take my sword to it --

Verrocchio and his staff shrink back in fear, SCREAMING. 

VERROCCHIO
WAIT!!!

Giuliano stays his hand.  Verrocchio looks like he s about to 
have a stroke.  He dabs his brow with a handkerchief.

VERROCCHIO (CONT D)
The chest has been rigged to 
explode if anyone tampers with it.

GIULIANO
Are you mad?  Why would anyone 
engineer such an infernal 
contrivance?!

DAVINCI (O.S.)
To protect my ideas, obviously.

CLOSE ON DaVinci, just now entering, tailed by Nico.  Upon 
seeing them, Verrocchio s face floods with relief.

VERROCCHIO
Gentlemen, Leonardo DaVinci.  

BECCHI
Your  finest man , I take it?
(sizing DaVinci up)
I ve heard of you.  They say you re 
quite the free thinker.

DAVINCI
I m not sure who  they  are, but 
I m happy to accept the 
distinction, even if it was 
delivered somewhat disingenuously.

DaVinci sweeps past them, drawing near Verrocchio, who hisses:

VERROCCHIO
You re late.16.


DaVinci smiles back at him, as if to say  I ve got this.   
Then he CLAPS his hands, launching into presentation mode.

DAVINCI
So!  The First Citizen of Florence 
is desperate for us to fashion a 
columbina.  Is that correct?  

BECCHI
Desperate is a strong word.

DAVINCI
And yet it happens to be the word I 
used.  So let s review.  Every Easter, 
a grand procession makes its way 
through the streets, terminating at 
the cathedral, where Mass is held --  

GIULIANO
Why do you insist on stating what 
every child of three already knows?  

DAVINCI
Why do you insist on interrupting 
me?  I have a methodology.  We can 
follow it.  Or we can flail about.  
Which avenue do you prefer?    

Giuliano stares at DaVinci, momentarily flummoxed.

DAVINCI (CONT D)
I ll take your silence as a vote 
for the former.  So, onward.  At 
the culmination of Mass, a 
mechanical dove, the Columbina, is 
flown from the altar on a wire -- 

DaVinci leaps onto a workbench, pantomiming wings.  

DAVINCI (CONT D)
Out into the public square it 
soars, igniting a cart full of 
fireworks!  The Republic 
celebrates, donning masks, engaging 
in drunken revelry.   For years, 
the House of Medici has contracted 
with inferior workshops to produce 
the ceremonial dove.  
(advancing on Becchi)
But this year, if I m to understand 
the politics afoot, the same, shoddy 
pageantry just won t do.  17.


GIULIANO
No one s carped about our dove 
before.

DAVINCI
To call your previous efforts a 
 dove  is to insult the entire avian 
class.  I m offering to fashion you 
something much more sublime.  

BECCHI
Enough!  Show us the damn thing!

DaVinci kneels and deftly manipulates the lock.  As it 
unlatches, the others back away, expecting an explosion -- 

-- but nothing happens.  Instead, DaVinci pulls out the most 
beautiful ARTIFICIAL DOVE the world has ever seen.  

DAVINCI
Of course, this is but a quarter-
scale model.  

BECCHI
It s astonishingly life-like.  I ll 
grant you that.

DAVINCI
It can be yours for thirty florins.

GIULIANO
Thirty?  The contract stated twelve.

DAVINCI
Ah.  But that was for a bird that 
needed a guide-wire.  This miracle 
requires no such handicap.

DaVinci triggers an internal spring.  The dove circles the 
workshop before landing in his hands.  The workers APPLAUD.  

BECCHI
Your work is impressive.  But the 
price is too steep.

DAVINCI
The Medici require a show of power 
this Easter.  Something that will 
astound the public and assure them 
that Florence is secure.  Thirty 
florins is a bargain. 

GIULIANO
Thirty florins is sodomy!18.


DAVINCI
Perhaps I should be negotiating 
with your older brother instead.  

Verrocchio winces.  Giuliano reaches for his sword as if to 
strike DaVinci -- but he relents, reining himself in.

GIULIANO
For God s sakes, Becchi!  Just pay 
the degenerate and be done with it! 

Giuliano leaves in a huff.  Becchi pulls out a coin purse.

BECCHI
You win, artista.  As is customary 
with commissions, we shall pay half 
now and half upon completion.

DAVINCI
While we re on the subject of 
commissions, I m told there s an 
open one to paint Lorenzo s 
mistress, Lucrezia Donati?  

BECCHI
Even if Lorenzo had a mistress, which 
I strenuously deny, what of it?

DAVINCI
I d like to nominate myself as a 
candidate.

BECCHI
Signora Donati is one of the most 
revered women in Florence.  As such, 
the commission is reserved for 
registered members of the Guild. 

Becchi offers a cadaverous smile.

BECCHI (CONT D)
Stick to your whirligigs and 
parlour tricks, DaVinci. 

And with that, Becchi exits.  But we can tell from the look 
in DaVinci s eyes that he s not about to let it go.  



Moments later, Verrocchio and DaVinci are in the loft 
overlooking the workshop.  DaVinci seems distracted.19.


VERROCCHIO
You push too hard, Leonardo.

DAVINCI
That s the thanks I get for 
doubling our rate?

VERROCCHIO
You re missing the point.  You re 
an artist, not a charlatan.  It s 
prestige you should be after.  You 
won t gain it by continually 
insulting those above your station.

DAVINCI
(taking offense)
My station?

VERROCCHIO
You re a bastard, Leonardo.  
Illegitimate.  You can t hold 
office or inherit wealth.  You re 
prohibited from joining any of the 
major guilds.  Your options are 
limited; mercenary, thief, artisan.  

DAVINCI
You forgot begging.  I could always 
take up that.  Or prostitution.

Despite the tirade, it s obvious Verrocchio has hit a nerve.

VERROCCHIO
I m trying to counsel you, Leonardo.  

DAVINCI
And if prestige was all I wanted, 
I d take it.  I want to be a 
scientist, Andrea.  A thinker.  I 
have ideas that need birthing. 

VERROCCHIO
The world may not be ready for your 
ideas, Leonardo. 

DAVINCI
Then I ll just have to invent one 
that is.



It s late.  PAN OVER a host of REVOLUTIONARY DESIGNS; some 
for inventions we RECOGNIZE.  Some lost to history.20.


DaVinci works, slumped over a table cluttered with designs 
for the columbina, near the point of exhaustion.  As we DRIFT 
CLOSER to him, Vanessa s earlier words echo:

VANESSA S VOICE
Is there nothing else you fear?

DISSOLVE TO:



-- melding with the adult DaVinci s as he wakes.  He looks 
about, disoriented, trying to recalibrate back to reality.   

VERROCCHIO (O.S.)
Are you alright, Leonardo?

DaVinci turns to see Verrocchio in the doorway, concerned.

DAVINCI
Just a nightmare, Andrea.

VERROCCHIO
You have them all too frequently.

DAVINCI
I m just having some issues with my 
mathematics, that s all. 

He gestures to the Columbina designs, and the scale model.

VERROCCHIO
Issues --?21.


DAVINCI
I m not sure the Columbina will be 
flight-worthy by Easter.  

VERROCCHIO
But the model --

DAVINCI
-- was a model.  Once I scale up 
the dimensions, the calculations 
don t hold.  It s annoying.

Verrrochio spots a PIPE and POPPY SEED PODS near DaVinci.

VERROCCHIO
Smoking opium won t help matters.

DAVINCI
It clears my head.

VERROCCHIO
It clouds it.

DAVINCI
What are you, my nursemaid?  Yes, 
it clouds.  I think too much, 
alright?!  I need to dull my 
thoughts or I ll be eviscerated by 
them.  I d have thought you d 
understand that by now!!!  

DaVinci sweeps his drawings to the floor, SMASHING bottles.  
Finally, he flings his scale-model into the fire, watching it 
burn.  He picks up one of the poppy pods.

DAVINCI (CONT D)
The tears of the poppy have 
medicinal properties.  The priests 
in Egypt knew that -- 

VERROCCHIO
We are not in Egypt.  And you are 
no priest.

DaVinci s shoulders slump, his rage evaporating into darkness.

VERROCCHIO (CONT D)
A word of advice --

DAVINCI
I don t want it.22.


VERROCCHIO
You ll receive it anyway.  You have 
a rare gift, Leo.  A kind of genius 
the likes of which I ve never seen.  
Because of that, people will always 
seek to destroy you.  
(beat)
Don t aid them in that endeavor.

Verrocchio exits.  DaVinci turns back to the model of the 
dove still burning in the fireplace and we --

MATCH CUT TO:



A noisy establishment, populated by Florence s SEEDIER 
ELEMENTS.  DaVinci holds court in back, drinking with Nico --

AND ZOROASTER (20S), 

A self-professed occultist and scoundrel.  Also, DaVinci s 
best friend.  Currently indulging in a plate of sausages.

DAVINCI
How goes business, Zoroaster?

ZOROASTER
Execrable since the Duke s demise.  
These are dark times for Florence.  

Just then, a SQUABBLE breaks out amongst a GROUP OF SOLDIERS.  
A PUNCH or two is thrown, a man goes down.  LAUGHTER ensues. 

ZOROASTER (CONT D)
Case in point.  Those mercenaries 
flooding into town.  If war breaks 
out, they ll be the only ones 
gainfully employed.
(shifting gears)
And speaking of employment, a two-
headed calf was still-born on 
Zitto s farm.  I can procure it, if 
you like.  For your medical studies.

DAVINCI
The last corpse you brought me was 
already decomposing by the time I 
took a scalpel to it. 26.


ZOROASTER
Grave-robbing is like fish-
mongering.  Sometimes, you re at 
the mercy of the day s catch.

Zoroaster spears his last sausage, offering it to DaVinci.  

ZOROASTER (CONT D)
Boar sausage?

DAVINCI
You know damn well I m a vegetarian.

ZOROASTER
Yet I keep hoping to corrupt you.  

DAVINCI
I m corruptible.  I just prefer not 
to eat anything with eyes.

NICO
Potatoes have eyes.

ZOROASTER
Oh, fuck-off!  Who asked you, anyway?

Zoroaster produces a deck of hand-painted TAROT CARDS.  

ZOROASTER (CONT D)
Here.  Have you seen these?
(fanning them out face-up)
They re called tarot cards.  
They re used to divine fortunes.

As Zoroaster collects and shuffles the cards, DaVinci notes --

THREE NEW ARRIVALS  

Captain Dragonetti and two of his Officers of the Night, 
prowling the bar and generally intimidating customers.  

Zoroaster sets the shuffled deck FACE-DOWN, nods to Nico -- 

ZOROASTER (CONT D)
Pick one, Nico.  We ll see if it 
squares with your temperament.    

Nico selects a card and turns it over:  THE FOOL.  

NICO
It s a trick.27.


ZOROASTER
Is it?  Or am I simply channeling 
the powers of the Ancients?  

DAVINCI
How many women has that line worked 
on, Zo?

ZOROASTER
A respectable amount.  And a goodly 
number of gentlemen as well.  Your 
turn, Leo.  Don t be shy.

DaVinci selects a card.  But he doesn t yet turn it over.

DAVINCI
I already know what it is.  It s 
the Devil card, obviously.

DaVinci turns it over.  And so it is.  Nico is impressed.

ZOROASTER
Well done.  But a card can symbolize 
not just one s temperament, but his 
future.  Do you dare see yours, Leo?

DaVinci picks a new card:  THE HANGED MAN.  Zoroaster frowns.

DAVINCI
Tell me.  Don t hold back.

ZOROASTER
This one represents sacrifice.  
Suspension between life and death.  
And then, perhaps, a great awakening.

But DaVinci seems distracted as an idea forms in his mind.

DAVINCI
I m an idiot.

DaVinci nods towards the previously mentioned mercenaries.

DAVINCI (CONT D)
Those mercenaries.  They ve come to 
sell their muscle, right?  The 
people of Florence want assurances 
that Rome won t be storming the 
city gates.  But what if there were 
a more lucrative way to traffic in 
the Republic s unease?

NICO
Like what?28.


DAVINCI
How do we attract patrons? 

DaVinci takes out his notebook, flipping to his columbina.

DAVINCI (CONT D)
With art.  Take my columbina.  It s 
beautiful.  But it s ephemeral.   
And honestly, who cares about art 
when their farm is about to be 
burnt down and their daughters 
sodomized?  So how does one really 
achieve immortality?

Nico shrugs.  Zoroaster is equally puzzled.

DAVINCI (CONT D)
By selling an idea.  Aristotle, 
Plato, Socrates.  They laid down a 
set of principles, which then 
propagated outward through history.

ZOROASTER
No one wants your principles, Leo. 
They barely want your art.

DAVINCI
But what if those principles could 
make them feel safe at night?

ZOROASTER
What do you have in mind, Leo?  A 
chastity belt for the anus?

DAVINCI
I should be promoting myself as a 
military engineer, not a painter.  
War s always been the hand-maiden 
of progress.  If I want to explore 
my ideas, I just have to cloak them 
in the guise of Florence s defense.  

Just then, a new HUBBUB draws their attention.

ANGLE ON  THE TURK  (50S),

(Sharp-eyed viewers saw him disembark from the ship earlier.)  
Dragonetti and his men are harassing the scholar. 

NICO
Why are the Night Watch bothering 
that old man?  29.


ZOROASTER
He s a Turk.  Isn t that crime 
enough?

Dragonetti knocks the Turk s drink from his hands and begins 
shoving him.  DaVinci s face hardens as he watches.

ZOROASTER (CONT D)
This isn t your fight, Leo.

DAVINCI
When has that ever stopped me?

ZOROASTER
(to Nico)
He always courts danger when he s 
drunk.

DaVinci pushes himself into the center of the fray.

DAVINCI
What seems to be the trouble here?

DRAGONETTI
Go back to your sketchbook, 
scribbler.  This isn t your concern.

DAVINCI
Unfortunately, I have a character 
flaw that compels me to intervene 
whenever stupidity rears its head.  

BLACK MARTIN, one of Dragonetti s men, draws his sword, 
threatening DaVinci --

-- who deftly traps the man s hand, twists it, and transfers 
the sword to his OWN HAND in the blink of an eye.  He thrusts 
it forward, giving a pin-prick touch to Martin s forehead.   

DAVINCI (CONT D)
There, you see?  That was stupid.  
Your man s grip was too loose and 
now he finds himself staring down 
this handsome spada filo.  

MORGANTE, Dragonetti s second man, tries to engage DaVinci --

-- but DaVinci moves like lightning, drawing a DAGGER with 
his left hand, parrying the man s sword, then SLASHING his 
cheek.  Morgante CRIES OUT, clutching his face.30.


DAVINCI (CONT D)
More stupidity.  If you d asked 
around, you d know I m ambidextrous 
and perfectly capable of fighting 
two --
(pointedly)
-- or even three men simultaneously.

Dragonetti pauses, hand on his sword hilt.  Although DaVinci 
is smiling, the look in his eyes tells us he means business.

DAVINCI (CONT D)
Bully someone else, Dragonetti.

Dragonetti glances about.  The whole tavern is watching.  

DRAGONETTI
You ve made a serious 
miscalculation tonight, artista.

DAVINCI
It wouldn t be the first time.

Dragonetti gestures to his men, who back away.  The trio exit, 
enduring a CHORUS OF CATCALLS.  DaVinci looks to the Turk.

DAVINCI (CONT D)
Are you alright, Sir?

TURK
I am more than alright.   I am a son 
of Earth and Starry Heaven. 

DaVinci blinks.  That was a odd reply.  The Turk reaches into 
his robe, retrieving a COIN, which he hands to DaVinci.  

TURK (CONT D)
I return to Constantinople the day 
after tomorrow.  But I am staying 
at the Inn of the Black Swan.  Come 
see me before I go, Maestro.  

And with that, the Turk exits.  Nico and Zoroaster approach.

ZOROASTER
Well that was certainly bizarre.  
What did he give you?

DaVinci looks down at the coin, perplexed.  A strange symbol 
is embossed on it: a winged man with a lion s head and twin 
serpents coiled around him.

DAVINCI
A tip, I think. 31.



Torch-lit, filled with dank cells and instruments of torture.  
DaVinci has his hands bound and is getting the shit beaten 
out of him by Dragonetti and his men.  And just when it seems 
like he can t take it anymore --

MAN S VOICE (O.S.)
That s enough.

They stop.  DaVinci squints, making out a SILHOUETTE in the 
shadows.  One of the Officers sets a chair down and the figure 
sits.  It s DaVinci s father, Piero.

DAVINCI
I should have known.

PIERO
People are talking about you.  And 
not in a positive light.

DAVINCI
I could care less what they re 
saying about me.

PIERO
I care!!!  Your actions embarrassed 
me today.   I ll not have you 
tarnishing our family s name with 
your flippant tone and vulgar 
attempts at self-promotion.

DAVINCI
Then perhaps you should disown me.  

PIERO
You are my first-born.  And as much 
as I might wish to disavow you, our 
reputations are intertwined.

DAVINCI
First-born?  You say that as if --33.


PIERO
My wife, Margherita, bore me a son 
this past week.  
(smiling cruelly)
A legitimate heir.  

DaVinci straightens himself, stung.

DAVINCI
My condolences to him.  I wonder 
how long it will take the poor fool 
to curse his lineage?

PIERO
(his face growing cold)
Your rank within the social order 
has been rigidly defined.  You 
should endeavor to remain within it.  
Stay away from the Medicis, 
Leonardo.  I ll not warn you again.

DAVINCI
And I ll wager you will.

PIERO
Why do you have to make this all so 
difficult?!  

DAVINCI
It s my nature.  I see things as 
they are, and not as they might be.   
Truth compels me to speak.

Piero BACK-HANDS DaVinci across the face.  

PIERO
Speak, then!

DAVINCI
(wincing, spitting blood)
You are a petty man --

Piero STRIKES DaVinci again. 

DAVINCI (CONT D)
You will never achieve greatness --

Piero STRIKES DaVinci a THIRD TIME.

DAVINCI (CONT D)
-- whereas I, already have.

Piero gestures to the dark, damp environs around them.34.


PIERO 
You are kneeling in a dungeon, about 
to be hit again and again and again 
by men who know how to hit.  That's 
what you've achieved, Leonardo. 
(to Dragonetti) )
Beat him for another hour, then 
toss him back onto the streets with 
the rest of the garbage.

As Piero exits, Dragonetti smiles and readies a truncheon --

DRAGONETTI
Hold out the scribbler s hands -- 

The men comply, forcing DaVinci s bound hands out.  As 
Dragonetti brings his truncheon down, DaVinci SCREAMS.  



At the front desk, DaVinci approaches the INN KEEPER.

DAVINCI
There was a Turk staying here.  An 
elderly gentleman --?

INN KEEPER
He left at dawn.
(as DaVinci s face falls)
Is your name Leonardo?

DAVINCI
Yes.

INN KEEPER
He said you could find him in the 
in the Roman ruins North of town.



DaVinci finds himself in a cave.  CANDLES burn in recesses 
along the walls.  At the far end is an ALTAR, containing -- 

AN AGED LIMESTONE RELIEF

The LION-HEADED MAN, with the twin serpents coiled around it.  
It holds a KEY in its right hand and ANOTHER KEY in its left.  

THE TURK,  ASLAN AL-RAHIM ,

Sits before the altar.  He nods to DaVinci and we realize 
that we have nearly caught up to our opening scene.

AL-RAHIM
My name is Aslan Al-Rahim.  Sit, 
please.

DaVinci takes a seat before Al-Rahim.  He nods to the altar --

DAVINCI
That figure --

AL-RAHIM
Will become known to you in time.  
Will you smoke with me, DaVinci?

Al-Rahim motions to a water pipe beside him; a Nargile.

DAVINCI
That depends on what s in the pipe.

AL-RAHIM
A mixture of tobacco and black 
hellebore.  The flower is mildly 
poisonous and is rumored to induce 
visions and summon demons. 

DAVINCI
I believe in neither.

AL-RAHIM
Then why do you struggle so hard to 
keep them both at bay?
(off DaVinci s unease)
Demons exist.  You d be wise to 
embrace them.

Al-Rahim brings the mouth-piece to his lips and inhales 
deeply.  He then passes it to DaVinci, who follows suit.  39.


AL-RAHIM (CONT D)
History is a lie that has been 
honed like a weapon by people who 
have suppressed the truth.  
Centuries from now, your own 
history will also be suppressed. 

DAVINCI
To what end?

AL-RAHIM
The knowledge you are destined to 
learn will upend the established 
order of things.

DAVINCI
How could you possibly know that?

AL-RAHIM
You ve heard the phrase  time is a 
river ?  What most fail to grasp is 
that the river is circular.  In 
this way, the future is a book that 
can be read like any other.  
(beat)
One man s death opens the doorway 
for the birth of the next.  Would 
you like to know how this 
particular doorway opened?

DaVinci slowly nods, apprehensive.  Al-Rahim seems pleased.

AL-RAHIM (CONT D)
Be forewarned, then.  Some doorways 
lead into darkness.

DAVINCI
I saw a man executed today.  He said 
something to me before he died --

AL-RAHIM
I am a son of Earth and Starry 
Heaven.  I am thirsty.  Please give 
me something to drink from the 
fountain of Memory.
(beat)
It s an invocation.  A way for 
members of our fraternity to 
recognize one another.

DAVINCI
I m not a member of your fraternity.40.


AL-RAHIM
Are you sure?

DaVinci blinks as his surroundings briefly PULSE in and out 
of focus.  The effects of the hellebore are kicking in.

AL-RAHIM (CONT D)
I came to Florence for two reasons.  
The first was to secure Avraham ben 
Yosef s release.  I failed.

DAVINCI
And the second reason?

AL-RAHIM
Did you really think our meeting at 
the tavern was a coincidence?  I 
provoked the Officers of the Night 
in order to observe your behavior.

DAVINCI
And how did I fare?

AL-RAHIM
Like a fool.  Your intellect is 
vastly superior to your peers, yet 
you needlessly risk it on acts of 
bravado.  

DAVINCI
But I was coming to your aid --

AL-RAHIM
I could have defended myself.  You 
are bright, Leonardo.  But you are 
not yet wise.  And there is an 
ocean of knowledge that remains 
hidden to you.

Al-Rahim indicates the temple around them.

AL-RAHIM (CONT D)
This temple was a place of worship 
for a religion that originated long 
before Christ.  Its adherents have 
largely vanished, but there are 
still a select few who heed its 
call.    
(beat)
Much of what you call progress has 
simply been a matter of remembering 
what was once forgotten.  
(MORE)41.

AL-RAHIM (CONT D)
Many of science s recent 
 discoveries  were already known 
and codified millennia ago.  

Al-Rahim s words take on a trance-like quality as his FACE 
BLURS and the candles STROBE. 

AL-RAHIM (CONT D)
This knowledge was set down in a 
compendium known as the Book of 
Leaves.  Recently, certain clues 
have surfaced regarding the Book s 
location.  Avraham ben Yosef was 
following those clues when he was 
apprehended and put to death.

Again, DaVinci blinks.  His whole world is upending.

AL-RAHIM (CONT D)
Rome is aware of the Book.  Indeed, 
they already possess a handful of 
its pages.  The weapon used to kill 
Duke Sforza was engineered using 
secrets gleaned from those pages.  
Now imagine the knowledge contained 
within the entire volume.  In the 
wrong hands, it could bring about 
the end of the world itself.
(beat)
Perhaps you ve heard of the Secret 
Archives the Vatican has assembled?  

DaVinci nods.

AL-RAHIM (CONT D)
In many ways, its agents can be 
considered our opposites.  Where we 
seek to preserve and disseminate 
knowledge, the Secreta hopes to 
alter or suppress it. 

DAVINCI
I still don t understand what any 
of this has to do with me.

AL-RAHIM
What do you know of your mother?

DAVINCI
Almost nothing.  She disappeared.  
She was a servant girl, I think --42.


AL-RAHIM
She was a slave.  Brought against 
her will from Constantinople.

DaVinci stares back at Al-Rahim, stunned.

AL-RAHIM (CONT D)
An incident occurred when you were 
young.  Something you ve repressed?

DaVinci nods, uneasy.  How could Al-Rahim know about that?

DAVINCI
I was a boy, back in Vinci --  

A MEMORY FLASH ASSAULTS US

DaVinci as a teenager, having gone to fetch his Uncle s 
sheep.  He comes upon the waterfall and the CAVE ENTRANCE.

BACK TO THE PRESENT

As DaVinci s HEARTBEAT quickens, rising in volume.

DAVINCI (CONT D)
I d been sent to fetch some sheep 
that wandered off.  I found a cave --

ANOTHER MEMORY FLASH

Young DaVinci at the mouth of the cave, peering in.

DAVINCI (V.O.)
I was scared to go inside, but I 
was curious.  So I ventured in.  

Young DaVinci enters.  We FOLLOW HIM, swallowed by darkness. 

NIGHTMARISH IMAGES:  SOMETHING MONSTROUS in the shadows.  An 
ALTAR with a LION-HEADED FIGURE.  Impressions of VIOLENCE.  
Coming faster as DaVinci s HEARTBEAT reaches a fever-pitch. 

AL-RAHIM
What happened?

DaVinci looks away, frightened, anxious. 

DAVINCI
I don t know.  The next hours are 
blank.  I remember stumbling out --43.


BACK IN THE PAST,

Young DaVinci stumbles from the cave in shock, his clothes 
torn and dirty.  His hands and face are covered with BLOOD.  

DAVINCI (V.O.)
There was blood on my hands and 
face.  And somehow -- I knew it 
wasn t my own.

Al-Rahim nods, satisfied with the account.  DaVinci is spent, 
his hands trembling.  Al-Rahim speaks softly now:

AL-RAHIM
One day, you will return to that 
cave and remember the rest.  And 
when you do, we will meet again.

DAVINCI
But -- what am I to do until then?

AL-RAHIM
Search for the Book of Leaves.  Fate 
has chosen you, Leonardo.

DAVINCI
I don t believe in fate.

AL-RAHIM
Then believe in yourself.  You 
followed me here, didn t you?  

DAVINCI
Where do I start my search, then?

AL-RAHIM
With the hanged man, obviously.  
The seat of the soul.  You ll find 
he already opened the door for you.

DAVINCI
And my mother --?

Al-Rahim holds up a HANDFUL OF DUST.  

AL-RAHIM
She s waiting for you on the other 
side.  All you need do is enter --

Al-Rahim blows the dust in DaVinci s face.  He coughs and 
tries to rise, alarmed -- and is dragged into unconsciousness.

NICO S VOICE
Maestro?  Can you hear me?44.



FADE IN as DaVinci stirs, his face lit by sunlight from the 
stairs above.  Nico and Zoroaster kneel over him, worried.  

DAVINCI
What time is it --?

ZOROASTER
Past noon.  We ve been looking for 
you since last night.  What 
happened to you?

DAVINCI
The Turk was here --

DaVinci looks around the cave, but all traces of Al-Rahim are 
gone; the candles, the pipe, even the altar.  

DAVINCI (CONT D)
There was an altar, a statue -- 
they must ve weighed over a ton.

Zoroaster and Nico exchange puzzled looks.  

ZOROASTER
This place has been empty for 
centuries, Leo.

DaVinci rubs his temples, feeling drugged and confused.

NICO
Maestro.  The Officers of the Night 
have been looking for you as well.  
They say that Lorenzo Medici 
himself has asked for you.  



DaVinci, clutching a notebook, is escorted through the arcade 
by Dragonetti and his men.  But he s not being strong-armed.



DaVinci is lead past the money-counters.  Dragonetti stops at a 
door, nodding for DaVinci to continue.  DaVinci studies 
Dragonetti for clues to his fate, but reads only antagonism. 45.



The study is richly appointed with Flemish tapestries, 
precious manuscripts, and priceless works of art.  A HOODED 
FALCON rests on a nearby perch.

Lorenzo sits before a roaring fire, writing a letter.  
Gentile Becchi stands nearby.  DaVinci waits, but neither of 
them says a word.  Finally, Lorenzo looks up --

LORENZO
Leonardo di ser Piero DaVinci.  I m 
told you re my notary s bastard son.

DaVinci hesitates, glancing at Becchi before giving a nod.  

DAVINCI
I am.

LORENZO
I m also told you are a trouble-
maker.  That you are arrogant, 
impolitic, and utterly incapable of 
keeping your opinions to yourself.

DAVINCI
Arrogance implies that I exaggerate 
my own worth.  I don t.  

Lorenzo considers this, offering a ghost of a smile.

LORENZO
My mistress, Lucrezia, seems to 
think you have a singular talent 
for portraiture --  

At this, Lorenzo reveals the SKETCH DaVinci did of Lucrezia.

LORENZO (CONT D)
She was most insistent that you and 
none other be the one to capture 
her beauty. 

DAVINCI
I d say she has a discerning eye, 
then.

BECCHI
A warning, Sir.  He has a reputation 
for taking commissions, but finishing 
few.46.


LORENZO
(to DaVinci)
Is this true?

DAVINCI
I ve been accused of many things.  
But on this count, I plead guilty.  
I wrestle with details.  I bore 
easily.  Call it a flaw.

LORENZO
On this commission, you would be 
wise to overcome it.

DAVINCI
(offering a polite bow)
When it comes to Ms. Donati, 
boredom is the last thing I fear.

Lorenzo sits back, appraising DaVinci.  Amused.

LORENZO
I ll have your father draw up the 
contract, then.

Lorenzo turns away, dismissing DaVinci.  But DaVinci lingers, 
setting one of his notebooks down in front of Lorenzo.

DAVINCI
Sir?  If I may, I have a few other 
designs you might be interested in --

BECCHI
That will be all, DaVinci.

But DaVinci presses on, quickly flipping through the pages, 
settling on a diagram featuring a MULTI-BARRELED RIFLE. 

DAVINCI
This item, for instance, can greatly 
increase your gunners  rate of 
firepower.  While the top rack is 
being fired, the rack below can be 
loaded, and the rack below that one 
allowed to cool.  The cannons are 
also arranged in a fan-like spread 
in order to allow for a greater 
distribution of projectiles -- 

BECCHI
DaVinci!  

But Lorenzo holds up his hand.  He flips through the next few 
pages, settling on a DIAGRAM OF A CONICAL TANK-LIKE WEAPON.47.


DAVINCI
This is an armored car for breaking 
an enemy s line.  Propulsion is 
achieved by two men, who are housed 
within, operating cranks, which 
rotate the wheels.  Cannons can be 
mounted around the car s perimeter.

Lorenzo continues, finding diagrams for an ARMORED BOAT, a 
SCYTHED CHARIOT, and finally, a FLYING MACHINE. 

LORENZO
And this?

DAVINCI
A flying machine.  Modelled after 
the articulated wings of a bat.

BECCHI
Madness.  If man were meant to fly --

DAVINCI
-- he would have been born with 
wings.  But a similar assertion 
could have been made prior to the 
invention of gunpowder.  Or the 
wheel.  Or any other invention 
conceived since fire.  
(beat)
I believe man will fly.  And I base 
this belief on the fact that God has 
blessed us with minds capable of 
imagining things.  He wouldn t have 
granted us this gift if he didn t 
want us to use it.  Anything than can 
be dreamt of will eventually be 
built.  And anyone who says otherwise 
is a fool.

Lorenzo glances at Becchi, amazed by DaVinci s impertinence.  

LORENZO
So what, exactly, do you propose?

DaVinci takes a breath, knowing his moment is at hand.

DAVINCI
I wish to be employed as a military 
engineer.  Allow me to apply my 
talents in Florence s defense.  

Becchi shakes his head, audibly scoffing at the idea.48.


LORENZO
I am a humanist, DaVinci.  I have 
no interest in waging war.

DAVINCI
And yet, your humanism is precisely 
why war will happen.  Thanks to 
your patronage, Florence is a 
crucible of innovation.  But we 
both know the only reason that 
innovation exists is because its 
people actually have the freedom to 
challenge the old doctrines.  Rome 
fears that freedom.  Indeed, they 
fear the future itself.

Lorenzo mulls over DaVinci s words.  Then:

LORENZO
I will give you a modest stipend.  
To see whether these contraptions 
of yours can actually be realized.

DAVINCI
Shall we say a hundred florins?

LORENZO
We shall say fifty.  And if you 
haggle any further, I ll cut out 
your tongue.

BECCHI
(under his breath)
Which would please us all.

DaVinci smiles, pleased, and offers another bow.

DAVINCI
As you say, Sir.  Thank-you. 

As DaVinci gathers his notebooks, Lorenzo looks once more to 
the sketch of Lucrezia.  He gestures to it --

LORENZO
You used Lucrezia to gain access to 
me, didn t you?

DAVINCI
I am an engineer.  I utilize any 
device at my disposal in order to 
realize my goals.

Lorenzo drops the sketch of Lucrezia into the fire. 49.


LORENZO
Clever, but I d caution you not to 
get too clever around me.  A 
clockwork loses its luster once one 
glimpses the gears beneath its face.

DAVINCI
Point taken.

But as DaVinci makes his exit, something catches his eye --

A FIGURINE ON LORENZO S BOOKSHELVES

The lion-headed being entwined in serpents.  DaVinci tries to 
fathom its implications and Lorenzo s role in all of this.  

LORENZO
Is there a problem?

DAVINCI
(covering)
None at all.  Good day, Sir.

DaVinci leaves.  And we HOLD ON the sketch of Lucrezia, her 
beautiful features consumed by flame.



As DaVinci enters, he finds Verrocchio, Nico, Zoroaster, and 
the rest of the assistants waiting for him.  They APPLAUD.  

VERROCCHIO
Congratulations, Leonardo.

DAVINCI
Word travels fast.

VERROCCHIO
There are no secrets in Florence.  
How the devil did you do it?

ZOROASTER
He played on a woman s vanity.
(offering DaVinci wine)
Your stratagems become clear.  You 
are a bastard of the highest order.

At Verrocchio s urging, Nico pours wine for the others.

VERROCCHIO
Drink up, all of you.  Then get 
back to work.
(to DaVinci, pointedly)
(MORE)50.

VERROCCHIO (CONT'D)
We ve got a Columbina to build.  
And if it isn t the most 
spectacular bird this city has ever 
seen, our heads will roll.

DaVinci smiles, basking in his moment of victory even as he 
pulls Zoroaster aside and speaks to him quietly:

DAVINCI
I have a job for you.  The Jew who 
was hanged yesterday?  I need you 
to steal his body for me.  I want 
to examine it.

ZOROASTER
And my compensation?

DAVINCI
Depends on how fresh the corpse is.

ZOROASTER
Then I d best get digging.



DaVinci and the scarlet woman are FUCKING by candlelight.  The 
woman s robes are off, but she continues wearing her mask.  
SOUNDS from the carnival waft through the open window --

-- but the two are oblivious.  The sex is raw and animalistic.  
Her chest heaves, sweat running down between her breasts.  He 
reaches for one them, crushing it with his fingers.  She 
GROANS, sinks her nails into his back, raking downward.    

As they climax, she moves her hand between them, touching 
herself as he continues thrusting.  Finally, their limbs 
constrict, then relax and DaVinci collapses beside her.

DAVINCI
Christ.  That was astounding.53.


He reaches for a bottle of wine, refilling their cups.  The 
woman lounges beside him, catching her breath.  

DaVinci absently trails his fingers through her hair, then 
down over her breasts, her abdomen, her pubic mound.

SCARLET WOMAN
Does my cunt please you?

DAVINCI
Pleases, yes.  And fascinates.  And 
terrifies.

SCARLET WOMAN
Perhaps that s why they call it the 
 cave of wonders .  We create life.  
Men just destroy it.
(beat)
But tell me, truly; are you this 
wistful with all the whores you bed?

DAVINCI
You are no whore, Signora.

The masked woman inclines her head; a silent question. 

DAVINCI (CONT D)
We needn t continue this pretense, 
Miss Donati.  I knew it was you 
from the moment you approached me.

The woman removes her mask, revealing her face:  Lucrezia.  

LUCREZIA
How did you know?

DAVINCI
I sketched you.  Your features, your 
form, your bearing -- all are now 
permanently etched in my memory.  No 
fold of fabric could ever conceal 
your identity from me for long. 
(beat)
The more salient question is; why 
would a noblewoman risk her 
reputation on a lowly artisan?

LUCREZIA
Isn t that the point of Carnival?  
To pretend, for a night, that we re 
something we re not?54.


DAVINCI
I think there s more to it than 
that.

LUCREZIA
Tell me, then.

DaVinci brings a candle closer to better illuminate her face.

DAVINCI
You were intrigued by my sketch.  You 
felt that it captured an aspect of 
yourself that remains hidden from 
your husband, your lover, Lorenzo.  
The only time you see this aspect is 
on rare occasions when you happen to 
catch your reflection in a mirror and 
find a stranger staring back at you.    
(beat)
You want to know who this stranger 
is.  And you wanted to know the 
artist that was capable of 
capturing something so elusive. 

From the look on Lucrezia s face, we can tell that DaVinci s 
characterization of her was devastatingly accurate.  

LUCREZIA
You knew I d seek you out, then.

DAVINCI
I try to discover what motivates 
people, then proceed accordingly.

LUCREZIA
You manipulate them.

DAVINCI
I prefer to think of it as gently 
redirecting their trajectories.

Lucrezia studies him, still taken by his piercing words.  
They kiss again.  And when their lips finally part:

LUCREZIA
Lorenzo was quite taken with your 
designs, you know.  May I see one 
of these marvels?

DaVinci considers, then reaches for his notebook, flipping to 
a page with a sketch of a PYRAMIDAL PARACHUTE DEVICE.

LUCREZIA (CONT D)
What is it?55.


DAVINCI
A device for slowing one s rate of 
descent.    

LUCREZIA
Under what circumstances would I 
possibly have use for this?

DAVINCI
Say you were trapped in a fortress 
that had just been breached.  You 
could strap yourself into this and 
safely float down to freedom.

Lucrezia assesses the sketch and DaVinci in a new light now.

LUCREZIA
It would appear that Lorenzo s 
interest in you was justified.

DaVinci rolls back on top of Lucrezia, ready for another go.

DAVINCI
And his lover s as well, I hope.

LUCREZIA
Perhaps.  But I m curious.  I ve 
risked my reputation sleeping with 
you; you ve risked more.  Possibly, 
even death.

DAVINCI
To what do you ascribe my reckless 
behavior, then?

Lucrezia ponders a moment, then simply says:

LUCREZIA
Love.

DAVINCI
Don t be absurd.

LUCREZIA
You saw me, you drew me, you fell 
in love.  It s as simple as that.  
Add in the fact that I m forbidden 
fruit, and your fate was sealed.  

DAVINCI
You re the third person this week 
to lecture me on fate.56.


LUCREZIA
Maybe it s time you started 
listening.

Lucrezia rolls on top of him, straddling him.

LUCREZIA (CONT D)
Fuck me again, Leonardo.  And while 
you re doing it, remember this --

She reaches down, guiding his cock inside her.

LUCREZIA (CONT D)
-- you re not the only one capable 
of manipulation.

DISSOLVE TO:



Count Riario holds a lantern and leads a HOODED FIGURE 
through a narrow, cobwebbed passage.  He whispers:

RIARIO
This passage is known only to his 
Holiness  closest advisors.  For 
obvious reasons, we can t have you 
parading through the front door.

They reach the end of the passage.  Riario moves to knock on 
a panel, then pauses, looking to the hooded figure --

RIARIO (CONT D)
Oh.  How rude of me.  I promised 
you your payment first --

Riario reaches into his robes, producing a jewel box, which 
he hands to the figure.  The figure opens it --

A SEVERED HUMAN FINGER

Rests within, wearing a ring set with a rare, cyan-colored 
gemstone known as SERENDIBITE.  The hooded figure seems 
frozen by the sight, distressed.

RIARIO (CONT D)
(offering a baleful smile)
I take it you re satisfied?

After a long beat, the hooded figure nods and closes the box.  
Riario KNOCKS ONCE on a panel, then TWICE MORE.  The panel is 
opened and they are ushered by a SWISS MERCENARY into --57.



-- a sepulchral maze of twisting library stacks.  After a few 
turns, they come upon an island of light where --

POPE SIXTUS,

Now dressed in his Papal vestments, sits at a table with 
Francesco Pazzi and Lupo Mercuri.  Riario bows.

RIARIO
Your Eminence.  I bring news from 
Florence.

SIXTUS
Get on with it, then.

RIARIO
A new player has entered the stage.  
An artist known as Leonardo 
DaVinci.  The Medicis have employed 
him to design siege weapons.  

SIXTUS
Artists are as common as court 
jesters.  I see no reason why this 
news should concern us.

At this point, the hooded figure speaks: a WOMAN.

HOODED FIGURE
This artist is different.  His 
ideas are unusual, even heretical.  

RIARIO
(gesturing to her)
Our agent in Florence.

The woman pulls back her hood, revealing herself to be 
Lucrezia Donati.  Sixtus assesses her, glancing at Mercuri.

MERCURI
You trust your intelligence to a 
woman?

RIARIO
When one seeks to convey a message, 
I prefer to use vessels others 
would readily dismiss. 

As the men consider Riario s wisdom, Lucrezia nods to Mercuri.58.


LUCREZIA
If I m not mistaken, you are Lupo 
Mercuri, Curator of the Secret 
Archives?

MERCURI
I am.  What of it?

LUCREZIA
You may be interested to know that 
DaVinci made contact with the Turk.  
Apparently, he s searching for 
something called the Book of Leaves?

The news hits Sixtus and the others like a bomb.

SIXTUS
It would appear the Turk has found 
a new champion.  Continue watching 
him.  See if he can be coopted.

LUCREZIA
And if he can t?

Sixtus sits forward, his tone becoming dark and merciless.

SIXTUS
Then DaVinci will be consumed in 
the fiery sorrows of Hell along 
with the rest of God s enemies.

CUT TO BLACK.

THE END
