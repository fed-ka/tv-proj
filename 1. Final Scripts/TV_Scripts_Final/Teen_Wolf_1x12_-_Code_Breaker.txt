                                            ACT ONE

      FADE IN:

      EXT. HIGH SCHOOL/PARKING LOT - NIGHT11

      TWO YELLOW EYES blink in slow motion, lids gradually closing, 
      lashes delicately brushing together and then pulling apart.

      Cold breath pluming out from behind his fangs, Scott glances 
      from Tyhurst in one truck to Argent in the other. Then to the 
      confused and frightened face behind the windows of the bus--

      Allison. Unable to take her eyes off him.

      The pulsing BEAT of DANCE MUSIC drifts out through the walls 
      of the school, rising up, gaining in tempo, thumping faster 
      and faster until--

      Argent s door opens and the CLICK of metal sends NORMAL SOUND 
      AND TIME exploding back into Scott s ears. 

      With no other choice, he leaps up, all eyes following him. 
      Landing on top of the bus, he bounds over it and disappears 
      into the darkness while--

      EXT. LACROSSE FIELD - NIGHT22

      In the middle of the shadowy lacrosse field, a terrified 
      Stiles looks up from Lydia s unconscious and bloodied body to 
      Peter crouched over her.

                                  STILES
                    No. We can t just leave her here.

                                  PETER
                    You re coming with me, Stiles. You 
                    don t have a choice.

                                  STILES
                    Then kill me. I don t care.

      Peter eyes him, head craning forward as if to determine 
      Stiles s conviction by scent or heartbeat.

                                  PETER
                          (with a satisfied nod)
                    Call your friend. Tell Jackson 
                    where she is. That s all you get.        TEEN WOLF "Episode 112" GREEN DRAFT2/23/112.

        CONTINUED:22

      With a trembling hand, Stiles pulls his phone from his coat.

      EXT. HIGH SCHOOL/PARKING LOT - NIGHT33

      Allison steps out of the bus, movements slow and deliberate. 
      Her heels click down onto the pavement, hand slipping away 
      from the door as her knees buckle. 

      Just before she can fall, Argent is there with an arm around 
      her. She blinks up at him as if not recognizing him.

                                  ARGENT
                    It s all right. You re okay.

      But looking into his eyes, she slowly shakes her head as if 
      to respond that she s not okay. Not at all okay.

      EXT. WOODS - NIGHT44

      Racing through the woods, Scott runs faster than humanly 
      possible. Sport coat tossing to the leaves, he reverts back 
      to human form with each desperate bound and leap.

      EXT. HIGH SCHOOL/PARKING LOT - NIGHT55

      Tyhurst backs his truck out from between the buses while 
      Argent quickly guides Allison toward his own vehicle. She 
      doesn t cry, doesn t say a word.

                                  ARGENT
                    Come on. We need to get you out of 
                    here.

      Allison gets in and he SLAMS the passenger side door shut.

      EXT. WOODS - NIGHT66

      Tumbling through leaves and brush, Scott comes crashing to a 
      halt. Gasping, he pulls himself up.

      With each blink of his eyes, the IMAGE OF ALLISON AT THE 
      WINDOW flashes before him. The look on her face as she sees 
      him, the truth dawning on her.

      Hands digging into the dirt, every muscle in his body tenses 
      up in pure agony. Head tilting to the sky, Scott opens his 
      mouth to cry out--

      EXT. HIGH SCHOOL/PARKING LOT - NIGHT77

      SCREAMS BURST over the parking lot of the school. Girls point 
      in terror and heads snap around to look at the nightmarish 
      sight stepping out of the woods.        TEEN WOLF "Episode 112" GREEN DRAFT2/23/113.

                                    JACKSON
                    Somebody help me! Help me!

      Jackson races between the cars with Lydia in his arms, her 
      dress in tatters and saturated in blood. His SHOUTS for help 
      become louder and more urgent, even reaching the ears of--

      INT. STILES S JEEP - NIGHT88

      Peter. Who turns only slightly at the WHISPER OF A SCREAM 
      through the window of Stiles s Jeep. He glances back to the 
      worried boy driving beside him.

                                  PETER
                    Oh, don t feel so bad. If she lives 
                    she'll turn into a werewolf. She'll 
                    be incredibly powerful.

                                  STILES
                    And once a month she'll go out of 
                    her freaking mind and try to tear 
                    me apart.

                                  PETER
                    Actually, considering she's a 
                    woman... twice a month.

      Stiles throws him a glare of pure hatred and pushes the pedal 
      to the floor.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Main Title: TEEN WOLF

      INT. ARGENT HOME/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT99

      A LAMP HURTLES across the room, SMASHING into the fireplace. 
      Argent clenches his fists, trying not to grab something else. 
      Kate watches him seethe, clearly enjoying it.

                                  KATE
                    Feel better?

                                  ARGENT
                    Don t push me, Kate.

                                  KATE
                    I thought that was a pretty healthy 
                    display of aggression, actually.

                                  ARGENT
                    You told her.        TEEN WOLF "Episode 112" GREEN DRAFT2/23/114.

        CONTINUED:99

                                  KATE
                    She found out.

                                  ARGENT
                    Don t think I don t know about the 
                    little clues you ve been leaving. 
                    Starting with that necklace. She 
                    knows because you wanted her to.

                                  KATE
                    Because she needs to. From what I 
                    hear, Scott s brown eyes were 
                    glowing a distinct shade of yellow 
                    tonight. Correct?

      Argent studies Kate s expression, almost like he s trying to 
      read the motives underneath.

                                  ARGENT
                    Why did you come back here? You 
                    hate this town. I had a network of 
                    names I could have called on a lot 
                    closer than you. But you called 
                    first.

                                  KATE
                    You don t want my help now?

                                  ARGENT
                    I m not sure I know who you re 
                    helping.

                                  KATE
                          (spelling it out)
                    I came here to catch an Alpha. 
                    Remember? The one killing people at 
                    random?

      Calmer now, Argent begins to pick up the pieces of the lamp.

                                  ARGENT
                    Not at random.

                                  KATE
                    What? What do you mean?

                                  ARGENT
                    Tyhurst said Sheriff Stilinski has 
                    been able to connect every murder 
                    to the Hale fire.

      Argent notices her reaction. The subtle movements of the 
      eyes, suggestive of quick thinking and rapid calculations.        TEEN WOLF "Episode 112" GREEN DRAFT2/23/115.

        CONTINUED:99

                                  KATE
                    Then that s even more reason for 
                    her to know. They always blamed us 
                    for the fire. It s got to be Derek 
                    and some other relative. And I 
                    guarantee they re circling around 
                    to us as their last targets.

                                  ARGENT
                    I know. Which is why you re taking  
                    Allison out of here tonight.

                                  KATE
                    That s a particularly  not open for 
                      discussion  tone of voice.

                                  ARGENT
                    You re going to drive her to the 
                    house in Washington and stay there 
                    until I call.

                                  KATE
                    Are you kidding me? Bench your star 
                    player in the last quarter?

      Argent dumps the pieces of the lamp back to the floor. He 
      rises, getting in Kate s face and looking like he might 
      almost hit her. And she almost looks like she might like it.

                                  ARGENT
                    Get your things. I want the two of 
                    you on the road within the hour.

      Finally, Kate turns away. Argent is left watching her go 
      until his uneasy gaze falls to his hand by his side... 

      Clenched into a fist.

      INT. ARGENT HOME/ALLISON S ROOM - NIGHT1010

      Still in her formal dress, Allison sits on her bed, watching 
      her mother pack a bag for her.

                                  MRS. ARGENT
                    I m not sure how long you ll be. 
                    Want me to grab anything specific? 
                      Sweetheart?

      Allison s listless stare falls on the open dresser drawer.

                                    ALLISON
                    I just saw my ex-boyfriend turn 
                    into a werewolf.        TEEN WOLF "Episode 112" GREEN DRAFT2/23/116.

                                  MRS. ARGENT
                    How about I pick out a few things 
                    myself?

      A PHONE RINGS. Allison and her mother both look at the 
      dresser where her CELL PHONE lies. Allison jumps up to get 
      it, but her mother grabs it first and ends the call.

                                    ALLISON
                    Who was it? Was it Scott?

                                  MRS. ARGENT
                    No. Someone named Jackson.

      Allison watches her mother pocket the phone.

                                    ALLISON
                    What are you going to do to him?

                                  MRS. ARGENT
                    It depends. We have a sort of moral 
                    code we follow. Especially when 
                    they re that young.

                                    ALLISON
                    But Scott didn t kill anyone. He 
                    couldn t have.

                                  MRS. ARGENT
                    This is really part of a longer 
                      conversation with your father.

                                    ALLISON
                    I want to know now. Right now.

      Mrs. Argent turns from the bag with a look that s both 
      motherly yet oddly frightening.

                                  MRS. ARGENT
                    What you want right now doesn t 
                    matter. What you need is to stay 
                    quiet. Think of it like you just 
                    found out your father secretly 
                    works for the government. Of 
                    course, he couldn t tell you, but 
                    you understand because he s spent 
                    his whole life making the world 
                    safer. You re catching a glimpse of 
                    something you re not quite ready to 
                    see. And there are others outside 
                    of this family, not ready for you 
                    to see it. Staying quiet is the 
                    best protection. Do you understand?        TEEN WOLF "Episode 112" GREEN DRAFT2/23/117.

      Allison gives a nod, both frightened and curious.

                                  MRS. ARGENT (CONT D)
                    Say it.

      She flinches as the sharpness of her mother s words.

                                    ALLISON
                      I understand.

                                  MRS. ARGENT
                    That s my girl. Now pick out a few 
                    warm jackets. It ll probably be 
                    cold up there.

      EXT. ARGENT HOME - NIGHT1111

      With Allison in the passenger seat, Kate fires up the engine 
      of her car. Argent approaches from the walkway to see them 
      off. He bends down to the open window on Allison s side, but 
      Kate leans over to talk first.

                    your own.

      Ignoring her, Argent leans down to speak to Allison at the 
      open window.

                                  ARGENT
                    We re going to talk about 
                      everything. I promise. Call me when 
                    you get there.

      He retreats a few paces to watch Kate peels out of the 
      driveway. His wife steps up behind him.

                                  MRS. ARGENT
                    Is she right? Can you find the

                    know how to find him.

      FADE IN:

      INT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT1212

      Stiles s Jeep skids to a halt in an otherwise quiet 
      underground parking garage. The brake lights click off, red 
      glow fading as Peter exits from the passenger side.

      Yanking Stiles out of the driver s seat, he drags him down 
      the row of cars to one in particular. Reaching into the 
      tailpipe, Peter finds a hidden set of KEYS. 

      He hits a BUTTON and pops the TRUNK.

                                  STILES
                    Whose car is this?

                                  PETER
                    It belonged to my nurse.

                                  STILES
                    What happened to your--oh my God.

      Peter lifts up a pale and very dead female arm to get to a 
      LAPTOP BAG underneath it. He hands the bag to a slack-jawed 
      Stiles. Glancing back to the Nurse's partially covered body 
      inside, he shrugs.

                                  PETER
                    I got better.

      He slams the trunk shut.

      INT. ANIMAL CLINIC/EXAMINING ROOM - NIGHT1313

      Under the glow of a florescent bulb, Scott sits on the floor 
      in the back of the Animal Clinic, his only refuge. Knees 
      pulled to his chest, he puts his head in his hands.

      Sounds FILTER to him, bits and pieces of the previous few 
      hours coming back to him--

                                    MELISSA MCCALL (V.O.)
                    Tell her how you feel. Say it. Say 
                    it again--

      Scott shakes his head, trying to snap out of the memory.

                                    MELISSA MCCALL (V.O.)
                    Tell her everything.        TEEN WOLF "Episode 112" GREEN DRAFT2/23/119.

                      Everything?

      He runs his fingers through his hair. Then interlocks them at 
      the back of his neck. Shifting from one physical display of 
      anxiety to the next.

      INT. KATE S CAR - NIGHT1414

      While Kate drives, Allison gently rests her head against the 
      passenger side window, absorbed in her own memories.

                                    ALLISON (V.O.)
                    Why did you do that?

                                  SCOTT (V.O.)
                    Because I love you.

      She closes her eyes, trying not to think about him. But when 
      she opens them--

      She sees Scott standing on the two trucks as a werewolf, 
      gazing up at her with yellow eyes.

      INT. ANIMAL CLINIC/EXAMINING ROOM - NIGHT1515

      Squeezing his eyes shut, Scott s clenched fists rise to his 
      lips as if he s trying not to shout in frustration.

      BARKING and frantic MOVEMENT come from the dog cages in the 
      back, Scott s agitation seeming to affect them. One begins to 
      HOWL plaintively, a lonely and miserable sound.

      But it s a sound that slowly pulls Scott s head up, an idea 
      beginning to take shape.

      The BARKS of the other dogs begin to subside until all he can 
      hear is that one animal HOWLING, calling out for attention.

      Calling for a response.

      INT. KATE S CAR - NIGHT1616

      A TRUCK ROARS past Kate s car, snapping Allison s eyes open. 
      She sits up in the passenger seat to notice something.

                                    ALLISON
                    Did we pass the highway ramp?

                                  KATE
                    I think we did.      TEEN WOLF "Episode 112" GREEN DRAFT2/23/1110.

                    Are we going to turn back?

      Kate gives a soft laugh.

                                  KATE
                    Now that s a fitting choice of 
                    words.

      She pushes down on the pedal, driving faster and faster.

      INT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT1717

      Unzipping the laptop bag, Peter pulls out a MACBOOK PRO and 
      places it on the trunk in front of Stiles.

                                  STILES
                    Good luck getting a signal down 
                    here.

      But Peter hands him a small black device labeled AT&T Mifi. 

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Mifi? And you re a Mac guy. Does 
                    that go for all werewolves or just 
                      a personal preference?

                                  PETER
                    Turn it on and get it connected.

      Stiles hits the button under the MiFi label. A RED flash 
      begins to turn GREEN.

                                  STILES
                    You re really killing the whole 
                    werewolf mystique, you know.

      A BLUE WiFi signal lights up on the side and he flips the 
      device over to find the SSID and WIFI Key on the back. Typing 
      them in, he waits for it to connect.      TEEN WOLF "Episode 112" GREEN DRAFT2/23/1111.

                                  PETER
                    You know both.

                                  STILES
                    No. I don t.

                    Dude, I swear I don t know--

      Peter grabs the back of his neck, guiding his head closer to 
      him so that he can be heard clearly in the boy s ear.

                                  PETER
                    I can be very persuasive, Stiles. 
                    Don t make me have to persuade you.

      Stiles gives a frightened nod. When his hands return to the 
      keyboard again, they re shaking. He starts typing, fingers 
      tapping against the keyboard as--

      INT. HOSPITAL/ICU - NIGHT1818

      Shoes pound the tile floor of the hospital. Jackson bullets 
      around the corner past a sign reading: INTENSIVE CARE UNIT. 
      He s closely followed by two deputies escorting him.

      From between a group of plainclothes officers, Stilinski 
      notices Jackson pushing through.

                                    JACKSON
                    Where s Lydia? Where is she?

      Stilinski s usually kind and gentle demeanor vanishes.  
      Grabbing Jackson by the coat, he yanks him against a wall.

                                  STILINSKI
                    What the hell happened to that

                    And what? You wandered into the 
                    middle of a field and just found

      EXT. WOODS/HILLTOP - NIGHT2020

      Under the moonlight, a shadow falls over a rock precipice 
      that offers a vantage point looking down over Beacon Hills.

      Shivering in the cold, Scott steps out to gaze over his 
      hometown. He approaches the edge and kneels down.

      Placing his hands on the ground he closes his eyes, preparing 
      to do something utterly desperate.

                                  SCOTT
                          (to himself)
                    Please let this work.

      He tilts his head down and draws in a deep breath, back 
      arching up. His ears begins to grow, tapering into points. 
      Fangs appear just over his lower lip. When he finally gazes 
      up with yellow eyes--

      He s transformed.

      A werewolf once again, every muscle in his body tenses as he 
      opens his mouth wide and lets loose a powerful HOWL into the 
      night.

      The sound rises up past the woods of Beacon Hills, sending a 
      flock of BIRDS scattering from the trees.

      INT. ABANDONED BASEMENT - NIGHT2121

      Weak, but still very much alive, a chained Derek trembles 
      visibly when Scott's faint and distant call for help finally 
      reaches his ears.

      Struggling to lift his head, his eyes snap open to reveal the 
      faintest of a blue light around the irises. Starting to glow 
      brighter and brighter...

      EXT. WOODS/HILLTOP - NIGHT2222

      On his hands and knees, Scott gasps for air, back heaving 
      with each intake. He looks out to the town, waiting for a 
      response.

      But he hears nothing.

      Pulling himself to his feet, he steps to the edge and 
      concentrates. Trying to grab a hint of a response.

      Still nothing.      TEEN WOLF "Episode 112" GREEN DRAFT2/23/1115.

      Finally, he retreats back from the edge in a moment of 
      hopeless defeat. Turning away, he starts heading for the 
      trail and--

      He stops. Ears twitching up, he holds his breath and slowly 
      cocks his head. A SOUND whispers through the wind, hurtling 
      toward him--

      The sound of Derek howling a reply.

      EXT. WOODS - NIGHT2323

      Moving with superhuman speed, Scott runs, propelled through 
      the woods, racing to follow Derek s call.

      in the distance. The faint almost imperceptible sound of

      FADE IN:

      EXT. WOODS - NIGHT2525

      Scott runs. Breath gasping out of him, he races as fast as a 
      human can. And then faster and faster until suddenly, his

      an incredible speed.

      INT. HOSPITAL/ICU - NIGHT2626

      Worried teens looking very out of place in their formal wear 
      gather in the waiting area outside the ICU. Heads turn to 
      notice someone slowly approaching. Talking fades to whispers 
      when they each catch a glimpse of--

      Allison. 

      Slowly approaching the crowd, she notices Jackson talking to 
      several officers.

      Allison pushes through. All she can HEAR is her own 
      breathing. People talk to her but no words come out of their 
      mouths.

      She approaches the windows of the ICU and peers in. Lydia 
      lies in the hospital bed. Blood seeps through the bandages.

      Allison puts her hand to the window. As soon as her 
      fingertips touch the glass--

      SOUND RUSHES BACK. The roar of the hospital surrounds her.

                                  VOICE
                    Miss, I m sorry but you can t be 
                    here...

      Allison nods and steps back, turning away and--

      Slipping into the passenger seat, Allison shuts the door.

      INT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT2828

      Peter tosses the laptop bag into the backseat of the car. But 
      with his hand on the door, his head cocks to the side, ears 
      picking up something in the distance.

      Stiles notices the odd look on Peter and then glances about 
      as if he might actually catch the sound as well.

      But only Peter hears Derek s faint and far off return howl. 
      Shutting the door, he looks back to Stiles.

                                  PETER
                    Give me your car keys.

      Stiles hands them over.

                    Careful, she grinds in second.

      Peter crushes the keys in his bare hand and then hands them 
      back in a tangled metallic mess. He turns for the driver s 
      side of his nurse s car.

                    Yes. A werewolf. Do you need me to 
                    draw you a picture?

      He takes Stiles s wrist, causing the boy to flinch back.

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    That first night in the woods, I 
                    took Scott because I needed a new 
                    pack. It could easily have been 
                    you. 

      He turns Stiles s shaking hand around so that the palm is 
      facing him.

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    You d be every bit as powerful as 
                    Scott. No more standing by his side 
                    watching him become stronger and 
                    quicker, more popular. Watching him 
                    get the girl.

      He draws Stiles s hand closer to him.

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    You ll be equals. Or maybe more. 
                    Maybe for once in your life, you ll 
                    exceed expectations.

      Peter opens his mouth, exposing his fangs. He slowly guides 
      Stiles's trembling hand up and toward his teeth.

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    Yes. Or no?

      For a moment, Stiles stares at his open palm and truly 
      struggles with the decision. But then he pulls back, hand 
      slipping out of Peter s grasp.

                    truth. But you are lying to 
                    yourself.

      Peter turns for the car and a moment later, he s pulling out 
      of the space, racing for the exit to the parking garage and 
      leaving Stiles standing there alone, watching and wondering.

      EXT. HALE HOUSE - NIGHT2929

      The burned and seemingly abandoned Hale house lies in almost 
      perfect silence in the darkness. Until a teenager s shoes 
      arrive crushing leaves underfoot.

      Scott peers out from behind a tree, trying to let his senses 
      guide him. He steps toward the house to approach.

      But he pauses. 

      And then it s like he s almost magnetically pulled to the 
      left. Moving further and further from the house, he enters 
      the woods, finding a trail and then something else--

      A MINE SHAFT ENTRANCE. Branches and brush cover the opening 
      leading down into absolute darkness.

      INT. UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - NIGHT3030

      Scott feels his way through the pitch black, but he s barely 
      able to glimpse more than a few feet ahead.

      He stumbles, splashing into WATER. It drips from above as 
      well, dampening his hair.

      He continues inching forward, one hand feeling his way along 
      torn sheets of plastic covering a stone wall.

      INT. HOSPITAL/ICU - NIGHT3131

      Stiles rushes in to find the group of classmates keeping 
      vigil for Lydia. Gasping for breath from running, he slows 
      his pace. Everyone looks up at him, all clearly worried.

      unit behind his father and Jackson listening in to their 
        conversation nearby.

                    they don t know what happened. She 
                    lost blood, but there s something 
                    else going on with her.

      Scott s cell phone sits by Derek s jacket on the table in the 
      dark basement. Hanging from the restraints, Derek breathes 
      slow and tired breaths. His head lifts when he hears--

      FOOTSTEPS approaching. Someone wanders out of the darkness. 
      But it s not Scott. It s Marcus.

      his hand which is now freed from the chains.

                    I ve ever been able to compare it 
                    to. Seeing a friend of mine turn on

      They start forward again when they hear the sudden sound of 
      SOMETHING SOARING THROUGH THE AIR. Derek snaps his head up 
      with a pained gasp.

      An ARROW sticks through his jacket under his collar bone.

      Time seems to slow down as he shoves Scott away from him, 
      trying to push him out of the line of fire.

      Scott s eyes focus with incredible speed and accuracy to a

      and sends him crashing to the ground.

      HOT FLARE blinds him sending him staggering back.

      Hitting the leaves and dirt, the world around him burns with 
      iridescent flares. Then, impossibly, Derek is on his feet. He 
      grabs Scott, dragging him toward the house.

                    And we did that. Now we re going to 
                    kill them.

      Kate withdraws a Glock from her jacket and chambers a round. 
      She approaches Derek and with a casualness that is utterly 
      terrifying, FIRES a round right into him.

      Allison gasps as Derek s body drops back to the ground.

                                  KATE (CONT D)
                    See? It s not that hard.

      She looks up at Allison. And the teenage girl seems to now 
      finally see her favorite aunt for who she really is. A pure 
      and unrepentant sociopath.

                                  KATE (CONT D)
                    Okay, I know that look. That s the 
                    you re going to have do this 
                    yourself look.

      She turns the gun on Scott, aiming at his head.

                    What are you doing? Kate?

      Vision returned, Scott peers down the barrel of the gun.

      Argent steps out of the shadows. He holds a gun as well. But 
      aimed at his sister.

                    I know what you did. Put the gun 
                    down.

      Kate s eyes slip momentarily to the house. Both Allison and 
      Argent notice it.

      Seething, but unable to do anything else, Kate finally begins 
      to lower the gun. And as she lowers it, Argent notices 
      something behind her.

      The door to the Hale house CREAKING open.

      The wind whistles around them. Derek and Scott both look up. 
      At the exact same time, their eyes begin GLOWING. A response 
      to the presence of their pack leader.

      EXT. HALE HOUSE - NIGHT4040

      Argent s eyes whip from shadow to shadow as Kate steps near 
      him. He glances to his daughter.

                                  ARGENT
                    Get out of here. Run.

      Something BLURS PAST him. His gun clatters to the ground. An 
      instant later his body falls next to it, unconscious.

      Allison SCREAMS. But then knocks backward, a BLUR hurtling in 
      front of her, knocking her compound bow right out of her 
      hands and across the yard.

      Scott darts forward, but his feet lift off the ground. In a 
      flash, he s tumbling to the leaves with a PAINED CRY.

      Kate whips her gun around, eyes searching.

                                  KATE
                    Come on...

      She FIRES into the shadows.

                    Come on!

      She spins as Peter appears right next to her, grabbing her 
      wrist. Gun FIRING round after round, he simply twists her arm 
      up with his superior strength.

      Kate screams as Peter BREAKS her arm. Pulling the weapon out 
      of her hand he lifts her off her feet and drags her back 
      toward the house.

                                    ALLISON
                    No--

      She runs forward, charging up the steps and into the house 
      after them.

      Allison stops short inside, glancing about in the darkness. 
      Breath held, she steps past the stairwell to find--      TEEN WOLF "Episode 112" GREEN DRAFT2/23/1136.

      charred living room. His fingers press to her throat, right 
      at her larynx.

                    She s beautiful, Kate. She looks

                                  KATE
                    I m... I m sorry.

      Peter nods. Then presses his fingers tighter into Kate s 
      throat. And with the sound of tearing flesh, his CLAWS 
      PROTRACT, sticking right into Kate s neck.

      Allison SHRIEKS as Peter pulls his hand away covered in 
      blood. Kate s body falls--*

      And as she falls, IMAGES flash into her mind, given to her in *
      the same way Peter gave pieces of his life to Scott and how *
      Jackson culled bits of Derek s experiences.*

      And every image she sees is a face screaming out through *

                    But that apology? It just didn t 
                    sound very sincere.

      Claws out, he starts toward her. FABRIC TEARING under his *
      expanding body, the black coat falls away. Pants ripping at *
      the seams as the skin darkens underneath. Until finally--

      Allison stares up in horror at a seven foot CREATURE standing 
      in front of her. But the Alpha pauses when he hears A GROWL. 
      Turning, he finds--

      Scott slowly rising from the darkness, lifting his head to 
      reveal he s transformed.

      Another GROWL sends the red eyes turning to Derek who, 
      stepping into the light, is also shifted and ready to attack.    TEEN WOLF "Episode 112" GREEN DRAFT2/23/1136A.

      The two werewolves circle the Alpha, crouching low, moving in 
      synchronicity. And for the first time, Derek and Scott seem 
      like part of the same pack.

      They launch into the air, attacking in the same instant. But 
      Peter is prepared. He sends Derek hurtling into one wall and 
      Scott into the next.      TEEN WOLF "Episode 112" GREEN DRAFT2/23/1137.

      Allison falls back, debris flying, wood splintering. She 
      moves for the door, crawling outside of the house as--

      Derek and Scott both land back on their feet in an instant. 
      They attack again and again, but Peter pounds them back each 
      time until--

      Derek falls, blood spitting from his lips while Peter grabs 
      Scott by the back of his neck, pulling him up like a puppy 
      and then THROWING HIM OFF HIS FEET.

      EXT. HALE HOUSE - NIGHT4242

      SMASHING THROUGH the wall of the house, Scott tumbles back 
      across the yard. When he rolls to a stop, he gazes up to 
      see...

      The Alpha coming out of the side of the house. He spots 
      Allison trying to wake her father, to get back to 
      consciousness. But then--

      LIGHTS BLAZE over the Alpha. The two headlights on Jackson s 
      Porsche as he BEEPS the horn from the driver s seat.

      The creature whips its head around just in time to see--

      Stiles rear back and--with all of his strength--he hurls 
      something right at the Alpha. But the creature catches it, 
      the object landing perfectly in its palm. And that object is 
      a glass beaker filled with liquid--

      A MOLOTOV COCKTAIL. Resting harmlessly in its hand.

      She looks up to see Scott throwing her COMPOUND BOW toward *
      her. She catches it.

      The Alpha glances from the beaker in confusion to Allison who *
      quickly and expertly nocks an arrow.

      Realizing what s happening, the Alpha turns to throw the 
      Molotov Cocktail just as the arrow flies.

      But Allison s aim is perfect. The beaker SHATTERS in the 
      Alpha s hand, arrow SMASHING right through the glass.     TEEN WOLF "Episode 112" GREEN DRAFT2/23/1137A.

      The chemicals splash over its claws and fingers, mixing 
      together in a dangerous interaction--

      FLAMES IGNITE across its hand.

      Taking his cue, Jackson steps forward and throws a second 
      beaker. This one explodes across the Alpha s torso, bursting 
      instantly into FLAMES.

      The creature lets loose a horrifying SHRIEK, writhing and 
      twisting as FIRE ENGULFS ITS BODY. 

      Scott pushes himself back on the ground, watching the figure 
      burn in front of the very house where he survived the first 
      fire. 

      Until finally, the shrieking subsides and Peter drops to the 
      wet leaves underneath him, rolling to a stop as the fire 
      dissipates to black smoke.      TEEN WOLF "Episode 112" GREEN DRAFT2/23/1138.

      CONTINUED:4242

      Both Stiles and Jackson step back as--

      Scott turns his eyes to Allison, surprised to see her slowly 
      coming toward him. Approaching without fear. Still hurt and 
      weak, Scott tries to back away.

      But Allison kneels down, a hand held out to him. Scott turns 
      his head away, trying to keep his altered face in shadow, not 
      wanting her to see him up close as a werewolf. As a monster.

      But Allison gently reaches up, her fingertips touching 
      Scott s cheeks. He silently blinks at her with his yellow 
      eyes. Then she slowly brings her lips to his and kisses him.

      Eyes closing on the world around him, Scott kisses her back, 
      softly and sweetly.

      As their lips finally part, the two teenagers pulling back to 
      look at each other, Scott blinks in realization that he s 
      transformed back to normal. As if her kiss alone was able to 
      make him human.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Why did you do that?

      She says the next words simply and honestly.

                                    ALLISON
                    Because I love you.

      Past them, a now conscious Argent watches the scene. Scott 
      notices him. But before he can say anything, he spots someone 
      else--

      Derek standing over Peter s still smoking body. He s put out 
      the rest of the flames with his jacket which he s laid over 
      Peter, still alive.

      Scott pulls away from Allison, suddenly realizing what s 
      about to happen.

                                  SCOTT
                    Wait. You said the cure comes from 
                    the one who bit you.

      But Derek SLASHES DOWN, severing Peter s throat and sealing 
      his own fate. He slowly turns back to Scott to reveal his 
      eyes are glowing RED.

                    I m the Alpha now.

      And all Scott can do is watch as Derek disappears into the 
      shadows.

      The pitch black breaks up under the glow of FLASHLIGHT BEAMS 
      waving over the floor. Deputies hurry to catch up to one 
      person who kneels over a body--

      Stilinski. A disturbed look in his eyes, he slowly reaches 
      down to Kate s body before him and lifts something up from 
      around her chest. 

      THE NECKLACE.

      The same one she gave to Allison. The same one Harris told 
      him the arsonist would be wearing. Stilinski stares at it, 
      feeling over the symbol for the Beast of Gevaudan with his 
      thumb. Wondering...

      INT. HOSPITAL/PATIENT ROOM - NIGHT4444

      The door to a darkened patient room CREAKS open. Two heads 
      peer in. Stiles and Scott. They slip inside and pull into the 
      shadows as an ORDERLY PASSES by down the hall.

                    Shut the door.

      Stiles nods and puts his hand on the door. He slowly starts 
      to push it with the gentlest touch possible. But the DOOR 
      SQUEALS, almost absurdly loud.

      Stiles pauses, glancing to Scott who cringes behind him.

      Even more gently, Stiles starts to push the door closed 
      again. It SQUEALS again. Then, even more carefully, Stiles 
      tries again. But the slower he pushes, the LOUDER the SQUEAL 
      until it s almost a SHRIEK OF METAL SCRAPING AGAINST METAL.

      With Scott practically writhing in frustration, Stiles 
      finally clicks the door closed.      TEEN WOLF "Episode 112" GREEN DRAFT2/23/1140.

      Moving quietly in the dark room, they ease past a curtain to 
      find Lydia asleep on her side in the hospital bed. Difficult 
      breathes escape from her lips as the two boys approach.

      With a cautious glance around the curtain, Scott slowly lifts 
      the bandage off Lydia's side to get a look at the wound. But 
      fear turns to confusion as he gets a clear look.

                    town.

                                  MRS. ARGENT
                    We can handle it.

                                  ARGENT
                    What about Allison?

                                  MRS. ARGENT
                    She ll learn.
                          (she looks up)*
                    What about Scott?*

                                    ARGENT*
                          (eyeing the phone)*
                    I m not the only one he has to *
                    worry about now.*

      Beyond them and up the stairs, the rest of the house lies 
      strangely quiet.

      INT. ARGENT HOME/ALLISON S ROOM - NIGHT4646

      Past the door, the room is dimly lit by the desk lamp. The 
      bed lies empty. But the window is open...

      EXT. ARGENT HOME/ROOF OUTSIDE ALLISON S ROOM - NIGHT4747

      Under an almost full moon hanging in a perfectly clear night 
      sky, Allison sits on the roof, gently resting her head back 
      against Scott s shoulder. 

      Their cheeks touch softly together as she glances up at him 
      with a smile. Just the two of them out there on the roof, 
      they hold each other for one perfect moment.

      But a moment in secret.

      INT. HALE HOUSE - NIGHT4848

      The door to the Hale house clicks open. Stepping inside, a 
      nervous Jackson peers about in the darkness. When he speaks 
      it s hardly a whisper.    TEEN WOLF "Episode 112" GREEN DRAFT2/23/1141A.

                                    JACKSON
                    Derek?

      He looks into the damaged living room, eyes wandering to the 
      stairs and the balcony above. And then he stops breathing.      TEEN WOLF "Episode 112" GREEN DRAFT2/23/1142.

      CONTINUED:4848

      Silhouetted in the darkness, Derek stands motionless.

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                    I... I helped. I helped save you.

      Derek doesn t reply, standing perfectly still.

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                    You got what you want.

      Jackson approaches the stairs, a shaky hand reaching out to 
      the newel post.

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                    Now it s my turn. Now I get what I 
                    want.

      Derek steps out of the shadows and into the light to reveal 
      something rarely seen on his face... 

      A smile. 

      But there s nothing friendly about it. His expression is pure 
      malice as his lips part to reveal lower and upper fangs 
      growing to razor sharp points. 

      With a single blink, his eyes turn a BRILLIANT RED and Derek 
      launches himself from the top of the stairs, hurtling down.

      Jackson gazes up in the terror of uncertainty, knowing he s 
      about to be bitten, but not knowing whether it s to 
        transform... 

      Or to kill.

                                                                          FADE OUT:
