      NEIL Truman, 40, eating a bowl of Cheerios in his boxers and 
      a t-shirt, slips on glasses as he points a remote toward --

                                  NEIL (V.O.)
                    ...an 80-inch 3D TV.  I watch 
                    Sports Center on it.  That fishing 

                    show on the Discovery Channel.  And 
                      sometimes, when my wife is getting 
                    dressed, I ll sneak in, find one of 
                    those soft core movies you can get 
                    on cable 24-hours a day.

      As Neil checks to make sure the coast is clear, changes the 
      channel and finds some skin, CUT TO:



      GRACE Truman, late 30s, stands at the bathroom sink in a 
      sports bra and workout pants, brushing her teeth.

                                  NEIL (V.O.)
                    Not that my wife doesn t satisfy 
                    me. She still gets mistaken for 25.  
                    Even though that s when we first 
                    met -- eighteen years ago.

      Grace steps back to consider her cleavage.

                    She s a knockout.

      ANIKA Truman, 16, hums along with the guitar she s strumming.

                    My daughter doesn t do drugs or 
                    have sex yet.  And for sixteen, 
                    that s not just a blessing these 
                    days, it s an anomaly.

                      Especially when you consider she 
                    wants to be a musician.

      As inspiration hits and Anika scribbles some lyrics, CUT TO:



      Neil stands at a tie rack thumbing through a selection that 
      could be Macy s entire fall collection.

                                  NEIL (V.O.)
                    I m current on my mortgage, my 
                      cholesterol just dipped below 170 
                    and most nights I get eight hours 
                    of sleep.

      He selects a dark blue one, holds it up to his dress shirt.

                      ...everything a reasonable man 
                    could ask for. 

      Grace exits the bathroom as --

                                  GRACE
                    The yellow one, honey.  Brings out 
                    your eyes more.

      Neil dutifully switches ties, begins to thread the yellow one 
      through his collar -- then stops, stares directly at us.

                                  NEIL (V.O.)
                    So what the hell is wrong with me?



      Drenched in sweat, Neil sprints at full speed on a treadmill.  
      Another man, LAWRENCE, his gym buddy, also 40s, does some 
      half-ass stretching nearby.

                                  LAWRENCE
                    Mid-life crisis.

                                  NEIL
                    This feels bigger.  More universal.

                                  LAWRENCE
                    Now you re losing me.

      Neil ups his pace on the treadmill.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  3.

                    You realize seventy five percent of 
                    the world is covered in water and 
                    we re running out of fish?  Fish.  
                    And the bees?  Where are they 
                    going?  Millions of  em, just 
                      disappearing.  Then you got the 
                    rain forests burning, the ice caps 
                    melting -- even the polar bears are

                    I m serious.  What s the point of 
                    busting your ass everyday and 
                    paying a mortgage if the world is 
                    coming to an end.

      Lawrence grabs a couple dumbbells, starts doing curls.

                                  LAWRENCE (cont d)
                    You gotta chill out, man.  2012 s 
                    over.  Nostradamus was wrong.  

                                  NEIL

      He turns his head sideways to scan the spines.

      We see titles like,  Christianity and You!    The Torah 
      Explained  and  A Baptist s Guide to Life.  He pauses --

      Neil spots Lawrence as he struggles on a bench press.

                                  NEIL
                    Then one day, he just gave it all 
                    up.  Left his family to travel the 
                    world in search of meaning.  
                    Personal fulfillment.

      Lawrence finishes, re-racks the weight.

      Neil sits in an office overlooking a bullpen full of BROKERS 
      as he studies a monitor full of charts and ever-changing 
      stock quotes, bored.

      BROKER outside hangs up his phone, jumps up like a halfback

                    Three guys in the government kept 
                    all the money, unemployment went up 
                    three percent and they raised taxes 
                    on the poor.  Am I supposed to feel

                    a daily basis.  It s just numbers 
                    on a screen, it s not real.  
                          (to the room)
                    We re not contributing anything to 
                    the world in any meaningful way.  
                    Just hoarding money.
                          (then, to Victor)
                    And I always thought you were an 
                    asshole for making that a virtue.

      A long, awkward silence -- until Victor grins.

                                  VICTOR
                    You son of a bitch.
                          (to the room)
                    You all could learn a thing or two 
                    from this man.  Could sell ice to 
                    an Eskimo.
                          (back to Neil)
                    Almost had me there for a minute.
                          (to the room)
                      Alright...next order of business...

      Neil sits back down, Darryl leans over.

                                  DARRYL
                    Dude, that?  Was awesome.

      Neil enters, drops his briefcase.  He listens for a beat, 
      hears some guitar playing coming from:



      Neil enters, sees Anika strumming her guitar, working on the 
      same melody we heard earlier, trying out some lyrics.  Neil 
      is moved -- when did she get so good?

                                  NEIL
                    That s beautiful.

      Anika looks up, wasn t aware he was standing there.

                                  ANIKA
                    It s still a little rough.

                                  NEIL
                    What s it about?

                                  ANIKA
                    ...You ll see tomorrow night.
                          (off his guilty look)
                    You forgot about the talent show, 
                    didn t you?

                                  NEIL
                    Sweetie, I have this thing I have 
                    to do for work now that --

                                  ANIKA
                    You don t need to explain it to me 
                    if it s not a new excuse.

      She stands, marches out.  Neil exhales, heads into:



      Neil enters, finds Grace on her cell phone, pacing back and 
      forth, trying to put out a fire on the other end.

                                  GRACE
                          (into phone)
                    ...no way, Frank.  I can t get it 
                    done by then...

      She turns to Neil rolls her eyes.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  10.


                                  GRACE (cont d) (CONT D)
                          (into phone)
                    Alright, fine.  I ll make some 
                    calls, see what I can do.  But only 
                    because I love you.

      She hangs up, exhales.

                                  GRACE (cont d) (CONT D)
                    How was your day?

                                  NEIL
                    I tried to quit my job.

                                  GRACE
                    Tell me about it.  Frank s got a 
                    new house to show this weekend?  He 
                    wants me to have it staged by to-
                    morrow.  Can you believe that?  I 
                    shoulda told him to go to hell.

      Neil gives her a thin smile.  Grace gives him a kiss.

                                  GRACE (cont d) (CONT D)
                    You re home early.

                                  NEIL
                    I have to go to New York in the 
                    morning.

                                  GRACE
                    What s in New York?

                                  NEIL
                    Victor wants me to sign a new 
                    client.

                                  GRACE
                    Victor wants you to sign?

      Neil nods.

                                  GRACE (cont d) (CONT D)
                    Oh, my god, that s great, honey.  
                    That s really good news... 
                          (off his expression)
                    What s wrong?

                                  NEIL
                      ...nothing.
                          (off her look, sells it)
                    I was hoping to spend time with the 
                    family this weekend, that s all.  
                    And Anika s got her talent show...                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  11.


      She studies him.

                                  GRACE
                    Stay here, I got you something.

      She hustles out of the room and comes back with a box, hands 
      it to Neil.  He opens it, pulls out --

                                  NEIL
                    A tie...

                                  GRACE
                    I just loved the color you had on 
                    this morning.  Made you look sexy. 
                    You can wear it to New York now.

      Neil gives her a slight smile -- she s not reading him at 
      all.  He drops the tie back in the box.

                                  NEIL
                    Thanks...
                          (then)
                    Think I m gonna go take a swim.

                                  GRACE
                    ...It s freezing outside.

      He simply exits.  Grace watches him go, uneasy.



      Neil lies in bed next to Grace, stares up at the ceiling.

                                  NEIL 
                    We need a vacation.  On a beach 
                      somewhere.  Far away.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  12.


      Grace doesn t answer.  Neil turns to her... slides a hand 
      under her nightgown.  She gently moves it away.

                                  GRACE
                    I m tired now, honey.  

      He rolls back over, stares up at the ceiling again.  

                                  NEIL
                    I think we need to fire the pool 
                    guy.

      No response.  When Neil finally closes his eyes, they 
      immediately shoot open in:



      Having dozed off, Neil awakes in a sea of other MEN in suits 
      at the gate area for his flight.  A VOICE is crackling over 
      the P.A. 

                                  VOICE
                    Ladies and gentlemen, we can now 
                    begin general boarding...

      Still groggy, Neil looks over at a balding BUSINESSMAN across 
      from him who s putting on his jacket.

                                    BUSINESSMAN
                    Three hours late and not even a 
                     sorry for the delay.... 

      Neil blends into the sea of other PASSENGERS, everyone 
      showing signs of stress already.



      Neil wedges into an aisle seat, sees Businessman two rows up, 
      trying to get his air to work.  FLIGHT ATTENDANT hustles by.

                                  NEIL
                     Scuse me, is there any way to get 
                    some water before --

      She keeps going.

                                    BUSINESSMAN
                    Does your air work?

      Neil reaches up, gives it a twist -- nothing.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  13.


                                    BUSINESSMAN (cont d) (CONT D)
                    Coulda taken a Greyhound, got 
                    better service.

      Captain comes over the P.A.

                                    CAPTIAN (V.O.)
                    Ladies and gentlemen, looks like 
                    that initial delay has held us here 
                    at the gate.  Might be another hour 
                    before we can push back... 

      As groans drown out the rest of the announcement, we CUT TO:



      Still at the gate.  Flight Attendant hustles by once more.  
      Neil stops her.

                                  NEIL
                    Scuse me, it s really hot in here --

                                  FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                          (placating)
                    I know, sir.  And I am so sorry 
                    you re uncomfortable.

                                  NEIL
                    If we would just get some water --

      She moves off.  Neil looks at the Businessman who simply 
      mouths the word  bitch. 

      30 MINUTES LATER --

      Neil flips through the SkyMall mag for the fifth time when 
      the captain comes on the P.A.

                                    CAPTIAN (V.O.)
                    Folks, hate to say this but we re 
                    over our limit here in the 
                      cockpit...Gonna have to power down 
                    now, keep ya here while we call for 
                    another flight crew...

      Passengers start screaming.  Neil tries once more to snag the 
      Flight Attendant.

                                  NEIL
                    We re all really thirsty --

                                  FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                    Now you re harassing me.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  14.


      Neil reaches out to calm her.

                                  NEIL
                    It s been nearly five hours --

                                  FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                    Touch me again, I ll have you 
                    removed from this flight.
                          (moving away)
                      Asshole...

      Neil watches as Flight Attendant moves to the back of the 
      plane and grabs the mic.

                                  FLIGHT ATTENDANT (CONT D)
                    Ladies and gentlemen, we need you 
                    to stay seated.  I promise we re 
                    doing all we can to make you 
                      comfortable while we re 
                      experiencing this delay...

      Neil turns back, makes serious eye contact with the Flight 
      Attendant -- just as she takes a sip from a bottle of water.  

        Whoosshhh...All SOUND FADES OUT.  FILM SPEED SLOWS.  

      Neil turns back, overcome with a sudden sense of calm.

      He undoes his seat belt.  Rises.

      FLIGHT ATTENDANT --

      Sees him leave his seat, calls out.

      NEIL --

      Walks calmly to the front of the plane.

      FLIGHT ATTENDANT --

      Charges down the aisle after him.

      PASSENGERS --

      Take notice, start taping the scene on their cell phones.  

      NEIL --

      Reaches for the mic at the front the cabin.  He picks it up, 
      turns back and starts to deliver a sermon (though we do not 
      hear the words, just his voice over)                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  15.


                                  NEIL (V.O.)
                    I don t remember what I said or
                    where the impulse came from... 

      Flight Attendant closes in.

                                  NEIL (V.O.)
                    Just that something snapped inside 
                    of me.  And I was overcome by this 
                    sense of courage... Clarity.

      Neil drops the mic, turns to the cabin door.

                                  NEIL (V.O.)
                      I realized: I was the one who built 
                    this prison I was in... 

      With the strength of Hercules, Neil rips open the cabin door. 

      THE EMERGENCY SLIDE --

      Unfolds like a ribbon to the ground.

                                  NEIL (V.O.)
                    And I could break free...

      Inhaling deeply, Neil closes his eyes and jumps.  In SLOW 
      MOTION he hits the slide, glides for what seems like 
      eternity, a huge smile on his face.  

      Other Passengers appear behind him.  One by one they jump 
      down the slide like kids on a playground.  As Neil turns back 
      to take in their smiling faces... then sees SIRENS 
        approaching, we CUT TO:



      Neil sits on a folding chair in small office, water bottle in 
      hand, talking to his LAWYER as a TSA OFFICER hovers just 
      outside.

                                  NEIL
                    Have you ever had that experience?

                                  LAWYER
                    No.  And, as your lawyer, I want 
                    you to forget you ever said that.
                          (off Neil)
                    Look, four years ago, you d be 
                    grabbing your ankles at county 
                    right now, probably not even get a 
                    hearing  til Christmas.

                    But since they passed that 
                       Passenger s Bill of Rights  last 
                    year, you wedged your way into this 
                    little loophole that s gonna save 
                    your ass.  Not to mention everyone 
                    on board is coming to your defense.

                                  NEIL
                    Really?

                                  LAWYER
                    They re saying the Flight Attendant 
                    attacked you.  

                                  NEIL
                    She didn t  attack  me --

                                  LAWYER
                    You let me handle that.  Right now 
                    you got 200 people backing you up 
                    so I d keep my mouth shut.

      He motions for Neil to stand.

                    C mon.  Let s get out of here 
                    before anyone changes their mind.

      He leads Neil out to:



      Victor stands behind his desk, laying into Neil.  Darryl is 
      off to the side, fingering his baseball, enjoying this.

                    Show him that thing you showed me.

      Darryl moves to Victor s computer, does a few keystrokes.

      ON SCREEN: A cell phone video of Neil rallying the Passengers 
      on the plane, ripping open the door and pulling the slide.

                    Lemme ask you: what do you think 
                    the guys at Updike are gonna say 
                    when they see this now?  Huh?  
                    Hell, any of our clients.

                                  DARRYL
                    It s embarrassing.

                                  NEIL
                    They kept us waiting almost five 
                    hours.

      Victor studies Neil for a beat then snatches a paper off his 
      desk.

                                  VICTOR
                    Our lawyers advised us to put out a 
                      statement.  You were off your 
                      medication -- diabetic dementia, 
                    some shit like that.  

      He thrusts the paper at Neil.

                                  VICTOR (cont d) (CONT D)
                    You re gonna sign this and offer a 
                    public apology on behalf of the 
                    firm.  You re also gonna take a 
                    leave of absence and agree not to 
                    talk to the press.  Then you re 
                    gonna thank me for not firing you 
                    right now.

      Neil looks at the paper, back to Victor.

                                  NEIL
                    I m not signing that.
                          (off Victor)
                    They treated us like animals.  Why 
                    should I apologize?

      Victor looks to Darryl -- is he serious?                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  18.


                                  VICTOR
                          (back to Neil)
                    Do you realize what kind of trouble 
                    you re in right now?  I m giving 
                    you a gift here.  

                                  NEIL
                    Oh, I m sorry, I didn t realize it 
                    was a gift.  Lemme see that --

      He takes the paper from Victor, mock reads it -- then tears 
      it in half.

                                  NEIL (CONT D)
                    Oops, guess I m in really big 
                    trouble now, aren t I?  But just to 
                    make sure I  close  the deal --

      Neil grabs the baseball out of Darryl s hand, hurls it at a 
      mirror on the wall -- a BIG SMASH.  He pats Darryl on the 
      back.

                                  NEIL (cont d) (CONT D)
                    Now that had some movement on it.

      As Neil exits, exhilarated, we CUT TO:



      WHOOSH -- Neil explodes out of the elevator like a man shot 
      from a cannon.  He rips off his tie, drops it on the ground.

      He whips out his car keys, a smile spreading across his face.  

      He jumps in his car.  

      REVS the engine.

      SQUEALS out of his parking space and fishtails for the exit.



      Neil weaves in and out of traffic as he dials a number on his 
      cell.  There s a lightness in him we haven t seen before, a 
      glow.  As the call connects, he talks through his bluetooth.

                                  NEIL 
                    Frank... is my wife there?  I can t 
                    get her cell... yes, she mentioned 
                    that house last night...what s the 
                    address?                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  19.


      Neil pulls over, inputs the address into his Navigation.

                                  NEIL (cont d) (CONT D)
                          (into phone)
                    Got it, thanks.

      He hangs up, turns on the radio.  Upbeat SONG TBD plays.  
      Neil cranks it up, rocking like a teenager going to a house 
      party.  As he punches the gas, never more alive, CUT TO:



                                  NAVIGATION VOICE
                    ...you have reached your 
                      destination...

      Neil sees Grace s car.  He swerves over and parks.



      Neil enters like a linebacker on his way to picking off a 
      pass, calls out:

                                  NEIL
                    Grace...?  Babe...?  I got some 
                    great news...

      He sees her purse and cell phone on a entry table, moves into



      Neil enters, walks past the sliding door to the backyard and 
      glances out at the small, gated yard.  He turns back... 
      listens.  There s some KNOCKING upstairs.



      Neil bounds up the stairs, his mood rising with every step.

                                  NEIL
                    Babe...?

      He heads toward the Master Bedroom -- then freezes.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  20.


      NEIL S POV -- 

      Grace is holding onto the headboard as an unseen MAN is 
      taking her hard from behind.  

      They re both so engaged, they don t realize Neil is watching 
      them from the open door, dizzy from shock.

                    Grace... tell me a little bit about 
                      yourself...



      Grace stares back at us, face bright and eager.

                                  GRACE
                    Well... I m married.  Eighteen 
                    years -- we met in college.  We 
                    have a sixteen year old daughter.  
                    She s starting to look at colleges 
                    this year.  It s so crazy how fast 
                    the time goes --

                                  VOICE
                    I meant tell me why I should hire 
                    you.

                                  GRACE
                    Right, of course...

      REVEAL for the first time that she is sitting across a desk 
      from a young man (LEON), mid-twenties, hipster-cool.

                                  GRACE (CONT D)
                    Because I m an amazing designer.
                          (off Leon)
                    With a sense of humor.

      Leon gives her a thin smile, turns to a computer.

                                  LEON
                    What s your website?  So I can see 
                    some of your work.

      She reaches down for a large portfolio.

                                  GRACE
                    I brought this instead if that s 
                    okay...

      She lays it on the desk.  It s almost foreign to him.

                                  LEON
                    Wow... old-school.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  22.


      She opens it and we go

      CLOSE ON THE PAGES --

      Hand-drawn sketches of room layouts and color palettes.

      Leon turns the pages, considering the body of work.

                                  LEON (CONT D)
                    Have you never created on 
                      Micropoint before? 

                                  GRACE
                    I ve always preferred to work with 
                    my hands.  Makes me feel more 
                    connected to the process.

                                  LEON
                    They probably didn t have those 
                    programs when you went to school I 
                    bet.  That was what, twenty years 
                    ago?

                                  GRACE
                    Oh, yeah, electricity wasn t 
                    invented yet so computers weren t 
                    really around.

      She smiles, but he doesn t find her funny (again).  She turns 
      to another section, undaunted.

                                  GRACE (CONT D)
                    This layout was part of a project I 
                    did that got me a Fullbright 
                      scholarship to study in Florence.

      Now Leon seems impressed.

                                  LEON
                      A Fullbright?  Really?  Tell me 
                    about that.  You studied in 
                    Florence?

                                  GRACE
                    Funny story, actually.  I never 
                    took the scholarship.

      Leon looks at her, confused.

                    So you don t have any real 
                      experience since college.

      Clearly she s losing him, but Grace tries to stay positive.

                    talent.  But that is not the only 
                    thing I like to consider when I 
                    bring someone onto the team --

      office.  Young, hip PROFESSIONALS work at computer stations 
      designing room layouts and custom furniture concepts.  

                                  LEON (CONT D)
                    I have designers that come to me 
                    from all over the world.

                    I need people with real life 
                      experience.

      Grace looks to the faces in the office -- they re barely out 
      of college themselves.

                                  LEON (CONT D)
                    And frankly, it sounds like you ve 
                    had a pretty normal life.

                    Oh, my god, he actually said that?  
                      I would ve keyed his car when I 
                    left.

                    About what?  He was twenty-five 
                    years old.  What does he know about

                    whiny bitch to even complain, but I 
                    also know why mom had a screwdriver

                    Um, excuse me?

      Stephanie had been preparing to set up on the bike next to

      flips her off with a look, turns back to Grace.

                                  STEPHANIE
                    That mean you guys are still, 
                    y know... fine in the bedroom?
                          (off Grace)
                    What, like three times a week?

      Grace is shocked -- are you kidding?

                                  STEPHANIE (CONT D)
                    Once a week?
                          (off Grace)
                    Once a month?

                                  GRACE
                    You re not married.  Sex just 
                    doesn t become that important after 
                    a certain point.
                          (off Stephanie)
                    Our schedules are so different 
                    anyway, we re barely ever in the 
                    house at the same time.  And when 
                    we are, Anika s there.

                                  STEPHANIE
                    That s your excuse?
                          (off Grace)
                    Doesn t she have a driver s license 
                    now?  What s she doing home anyway?

                                  GRACE
                    I m not gonna let her drive on her 
                    own, are you crazy?
                          (off Stephanie)
                    Do you realize teenagers are the 
                    age group most prone to accidents?  
                    I saw this thing on the news the 
                    other day?  About texting behind 
                    the wheel?  They all do it.  What 
                    kind of mother would I be if I just 
                    handed her my keys and -- 

      Stephanie finally has to cut her off.

                                  STEPHANIE
                    You know what the problem is?  
                          (leans in, sotto)
                    You need to be getting laid more 
                    often.

      Grace flinches -- what?                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  26.


                                  STEPHANIE (CONT D)
                    Look at you, you re so wound up.  
                    You got all this tension and no 
                    release.  
                          (off Grace)
                    It s a lot cheaper than going to 
                    therapy.

      Grace wants to respond, but the SPINNING INSTRUCTOR has taken 
      his spot at the front of the class, calls out:

                                  SPINNING INSTRUCTOR
                    Alllll riiiggggtttt!  Who s ready 
                    to pump out a twenty mile ride?

      The class SCREAMS.  Spinning Instructor kills the lights and 
      a disco ball drops -- it s like a nightclub in here now.

                                  GRACE
                    How many miles would you say we ve 
                    peddled in this class?

                                  STEPHANIE
                    20 miles a session?  Four days a 
                    week for six years?  What is that?

      MUSIC BLARES.  Stephanie puts her game face on, ready to 
      roll.  As class begins but Grace remains frozen, we CUT TO:

      A CELL PHONE SCREEN --

      A FINGER taps some numbers into a calculator.

       20 x 4 = 80   A few more taps.

      80 x 52 = 4160  A few more taps.

      4160 x 6 = 24,960

                                  ANIKA (O.S.)
                      Mom...what are you doing?



      Grace stands in her closet, mid-way through getting dressed, 
      staring at her cell phone screen in mild shock.  Anika has 
      wandered in.

                                  ANIKA
                    I m totally running late, let s go.

      Grace looks up from her phone.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  27.


                                  GRACE
                    Do you know how many miles it is 
                    around the earth?

      Anika winces -- what?

                                  GRACE (CONT D)
                    A little over twenty thousand.  I 
                    may have actually peddled all the 
                    way around the planet and never 
                    left the same room.  

      Anika studies her mom for a beat.

                                  ANIKA
                    Ring...
                          (to Grace)
                    Hold on, I have to get this.

      She pulls out her cell, answers the  call. 

                                  ANIKA (CONT D)
                    Hi, crazy town?  Yes, my mom is on 
                    her way to you right now.  Just as 
                    soon as she drops me off at Jenny s 
                    so we can study for our history 
                    test.

      She hangs up, looks to Grace -- can we go now?

                                  GRACE
                    Your father s driving you.  I have 
                    book club tonight.

                                  ANIKA
                    Dad s in his force field right now.  
                    He said you have to.



      Grace enters, finds Neil on his computer reviewing stacks of   
      papers like a man trying to decipher the Rosetta Stone.  
      Anika trails in behind to watch this unfold.

                                  GRACE
                    Neil?

      He holds up a hand -- lemme just finish this one part.

                                  GRACE (CONT D)
                    I have my book club tonight.
                    You have to drive Anika to Jenny s.                                          Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  28.


                                  NEIL
                    I have a huge presentation due in 
                    the morning now, I can t.  

                                  GRACE
                    When did that happen? 

      He looks up at her -- he just forgot to tell her.

                                  GRACE (CONT D)
                    This is the one night a month I get 
                    with my friends.

                                  NEIL
                    If I don t have this done by the 
                    morning, we could lose an account.

                                  GRACE
                    It s always life or death, Neil.  
                    What about my life?

                                  NEIL
                    Do you think this is how I want to 
                    spend my evening?

      DOORBELL rings.  Grace holds on Neil for a beat then moves 
      off.  Anika looks to her dad, then walks out as --

                                  ANIKA
                    Someone has to drive me.



      Grace opens the door as a group of THREE WOMEN enter: MONICA, 
      NANCY and BETH, all around the same age, all close friends.  
      They ad-lib greetings.  Monica holds up a bottle of wine.

                                  MONICA
                    This needs to breathe.

      She moves off as the other girls move to the living room to 
      get comfy.  Neil comes marching out of his office, laptop 
      under his arm, lugging an overstuffed briefcase.

                                  NEIL
                    I ll drive her and then go into the 
                    office to finish.  I ll probably 
                    sleep there.
                          (off Grace)
                    I ll be out of your hair.

                                  GRACE
                    I ll pick her up then.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  29.


                                  NEIL
                    Okay.

      He gives her a perfunctory kiss, heads out.  Anika follows, 
      looks at her mom.

                                  ANIKA
                    Don t party too hard.

      Grace watches them go, then turns back to watch her friends 
      gathering in the living room -- so subdued. 



      The women sip Chardonnay as they talk about the hardcover 
      book on the coffee table in front of them.

                                  NANCY
                    ...I thought the author was trying 
                    to say we should move past our 
                    fears and let go of our childhood.

                                  MONICA
                    Uh-oh... 

      She holds up the bottle of wine they had all been sharing.

                                  MONICA (CONT D)
                    No mas vino.  Grace?

      She turns -- she d been a million miles way.

                                  MONICA (CONT D)
                          (re: the bottle)
                    I m gonna need a little more before 
                    we talk about those last few 
                    chapters.

      Grace considers her friends for a moment.

                                  GRACE
                    Let s go out.
                          (off their looks)
                    This is our one night a month to 
                    actually get together and have fun 
                    and all we do is sit and discuss 
                    what fake people are doing with 
                    their lives.  What adventures 
                    they re having.  That s pathetic, 
                    isn t it?

      She stands.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  30.


                                  GRACE (CONT D)
                    Let s go create some of own 
                    stories.  Talk about those instead.  
                    Get some... life experience.  

      A silent beat.  Then:

                                  MONICA
                    I think if we just opened another 
                    bottle --

      Grace marches out of the room, re-enters a beat later with 
      her coat on and her car keys.

                                  GRACE
                    I m driving.  Let s go.

      Off the group, trying to catch up, we PRE-LAP the sound of 
      CLUB MUSIC and smash cut to:



      Packed, sweaty and full of young, uninhibited PEOPLE who are 
      dancing with abandon.

      ON THE DANCE FLOOR --

      Grace is letting loose under the pulsating lights, blending 
      into the crowd, but clearly in her own world.

      ON THE EDGE OF THE FLOOR --

      Monica, Nancy and Beth watch Grace with a mix of fascination 
      and concern, trying to make sense of how they even got here. 
      They re shouting to be heard despite the fact they re 
      standing next to each other.

                                  NANCY
                    Did you see how much she tipped the 
                    bouncer to get us in?  

      Monica scans the faces moving by.

                                  MONICA
                    I swear some of these kids have 
                    baby sat for Evan and I.

      Beth watches Grace dancing, then turns back to the group.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  31.


                                  BETH
                    You didn t catch it, but she and 
                    Neil had this thing and Neil said 
                    he was gonna sleep at the office.  
                    You think everything s alright?

                                  MONICA
                    He lives at the office, I wouldn t 
                    read into it.

                                  NANCY
                    I don t know, look at her.

      The girls all turn to watch

      GRACE --

      Dancing up a storm, lost in her experience.

      The girls look at each other, suddenly self-conscious.  

                                  MONICA
                    You know, the book did suck.

      Monica looks to Nancy and Beth, then moves out to the dance 
      floor.  Beth looks to Nancy.

                                  BETH
                    I don t have the right shoes.

      Nancy moves off.  Beth stays put.

      THE DANCE FLOOR --

      The women join up with Grace.  She s bursting at the seams, 
      smiling brighter than the lights in here.

                                  GRACE
                    I just got offered ecstasy.  Isn t 
                    that cool?

      Her spirit is contagious -- this is so much better than book 
      club.  And as the moment just seems to keep expanding, Grace 
      looks across the dance floor and makes eye-contact with

      A YOUNG, SEXY MAN --

      He locks eyes with Grace.  Monica sees it.

                                  MONICA
                      Hell-lo...

      Grace can t turn away from him.  And he won t look away from 
      her.  She finally does, refocuses on her friends.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  32.

                    ...he s coming over.

      Grace can t bring herself to look.  But he comes right up to 
      her, drawn in like a tractor beam.

                                  MAN
                    It worked.

                                  MAN
                    The way you were looking at me.  I 
                    couldn t resist.

      Whether she hears him or not, she s in a trance -- he s 
      gorgeous.  He finally takes her hand, leads her off toward

      THE BAR --

      A little quieter here.  

                                  MAN (CONT D)
                    What s your name?

                                  GRACE
                    ...Grace.  I m married.

                                  MAN

      As he leans in a little closer, we move back to

      THE DANCE FLOOR --

      Nancy and Monica are watching this exchange -- whoa.

      BACK AT THE BAR --

      Simon moves a little closer to Grace.

                                  SIMON
                    What are you doing here tonight, 
                    Grace?                                           Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  33.


                                  GRACE
                    Doing here... well, it s kind of a 
                    long story.

                                  SIMON
                    Tell me.  I want to hear your 
                    story.

      Grace is bumped hard from behind.

                                  GRACE
                    Hey --

      She turns and another WOMAN pushes her aside, starts berating 
      Simon.

                                  WOMAN
                    I go to the bathroom and you start 
                    picking up other women?  She looks 
                    like someone s mother for Christ s 
                    sake -- 
                          (at Grace)
                    Run along to your PTA meeting, 
                    ma am.

      ACROSS THE FLOOR --

      Nancy and Grace have rejoined Beth.  They start to head over 
      just as

      THE WOMAN --

      Shoves Grace.  This time, Grace isn t having it.  She turns 
      to the bar, grabs a drink -- and dumps it on her.  Simon 
      tries to step in between them.  Nancy, Beth and Monica rush 
      up just as the Woman lunges at Grace.  As a scuffle breaks 
      out, we CUT TO: 



      Grace s eyes shoot open and she stares up at us from the 
      bed... winces from a screaming headache.  She looks at the 
      clock.

                                  GRACE
                    Shit...



      Grace enters, moving slow.

                                  GRACE
                    Neil...?  Anika...?

      No answer.  She sees some breakfast dishes left on the 
      kitchen table then sees Neil and Anika getting into Neil s 
      car outside.  She waves, but they don t see her, hop in the 
      car and drive off.

      Grace turns back to the empty kitchen.  

      The quiet house.

      It s almost deafening.  

      She sees her cell phone on the counter.  She moves to it, 
      picks it up and searches for something (which we don t see).  
      The phone rings.  She recognizes the number, answers.

                                  GRACE (CONT D)
                    Hey, Steph... spinning?  Um...no.  
                    I think I m really done riding in 
                    place.  

      Off Grace we CUT TO:

      A GARAGE DOOR --

      Whirring upwards, letting light into:



      Grace enters moves to the back of the space and we REVEAL

      A BIKE --

      A little worse for wear, tires a little flat, but rideable.  
      As she clears away some boxes to pull it out, we CUT TO:                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  38.



      Grace puts the final touches on the kitchen table, arranges 
      some fresh cut flowers.  She sees the back door open.  That s 
      odd.  She walks over and closes it, looks out at the yard... 
      Notices the row of tress behind it.

      She finally turns away, moves into the entry way, grabs her 
      keys and purse.



      A handful of TEACHERS try to impose order on the dozens of 
      STUDENTS who are warming up for their high school talent 
      show.  As the CAMERA TRACKS through the activity, we pass 
      some KIDS JUGGLING, a small DANCE TROUPE, a MAGICIAN etc.                                           Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  44.


      We finally pick up Anika, dressed all in black, strolling 
      through the chaos with her guitar.  A couple of SNOTTY GIRLS 
      check her out, talk loud enough for her to hear.

                                  SNOTTY GIRL #1
                    Check out freak show.

                                  SNOTTY GIRL #2 
                    She s so creepy.

      Anika pretends not to notice, but we can tell she s used to 
      such comments.  Her cell rings.  She checks the screen and 
      her face hardens.  She finally answers.

                                  ANIKA
                    Hello...

                                  NEIL (V.O.)
                    Hey, sweetie. 

                                  ANIKA
                    I m about to go on.  You ll have to 
                    call me back --

                                  NEIL (V.O.)
                    Wait -- I m outside.  In the 
                    parking lot.

      Anika is thrown, but heads for an exit and out to:



      PICK UP Neil and Grace settled in their seats off the aisle 
      near the front as an ACT finishes on stage.  APPLAUSE.

      VOICE comes over the P.A.

                                  VOICE
                    What a wonderful performance, thank 
                    you... Now, performing and original 
                      composition, let s welcome Anika 
                    Truman.  Give it up for Anika!

      Mild APPLAUSE as Anika approaches the mike with her guitar.  
      The spotlight hits her.  It takes a moment to find her nerve.  
      She gestures to the front row.

                                  ANIKA
                    I d like to dedicate this song to 
                    my biology teacher, Mrs. Tigh --

      MRS. TIGH, 30s, smiles back from her seat, taken by surprise.

                                  ANIKA (cont d) (CONT D)
                    And to Mr. McKernan from gym class.  

      McKERNON, also 30s, has curious look on his face as he s 
      singled out.  Neil leans forward as Anika starts to sing:                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  47.


                                  ANIKA (cont d) (CONT D)
                    Dear hider and seeker there under 
                    the bleachers, I caught you there 
                    riding my favorite math teacher.  
                    You held her, you ruled her like 
                    Julius Ceaser.  You handled her 
                    like a stud...

      Neil and Grace look at each other -- what is she singing 
      about?

                                  ANIKA (cont d) (CONT D)
                    But when it was over, heard tell of 
                    abortion.  And fear of exposure and 
                    threats of extortion.  Did mister 
                    Tigh find out and try to divorce 
                    her?  Was it even ever love...?

        A collective gasp.

                                  ANIKA (cont d) (CONT D)
                    What a shame, we re all to blame...
                    Look out now here it comes here it 
                    comes.  The truth s a loaded gun 
                    loaded gun.  Pointing at everyone 
                    everyone fa la la la la la la la.

      A panicked Teacher rushes on stage.

                                  ANIKA (CONT D)
                    Don t it make you wanna cry?
                    Makes you wonder why wonder why. 
                    No one s safe no where to hide
                    fa la la la la la la la la --   

      Anika s mic goes dead.  Mrs. Tigh races from the auditorium 
      and McKernon runs after her.  Crickets.  The Audience is in 
      shock.

      Then Neil stands.  

      Starts to applaud.  

      As he keeps applauding, a one man standing ovation, CUT TO:



      Anika sits between Neil and Grace.  In the hallway behind 
      them, we see the School Director, LIONEL ELKORT, 40s, 
      chatting with an emotional Mrs. Tigh.  He turns and enters 
      the office, takes a seat behind his desk.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  48.

                    We confiscated all the cell phones 
                    we could.  The last thing we need 
                    is this all over the internet.

                                  GRACE
                    That was smart.

      Elkort studies the Trumans.

                                  ELKORT
                    I m going to expel her.

                                  GRACE
                    Hold on, I thought we were here to 
                    discuss this.

      She reads it on Elkort s face -- there s nothing to discuss.

                                  NEIL
                    What about these teachers having an 
                    affair on school grounds?  What are 
                    you doing about that?

                                  ELKORT
                    That was a vicious rumor.

                    Wait outside, please?

      Anika exits.

                    I m so sorry, we really had no idea 
                    what she was working on --

                    Maybe that was the problem right

                    What are you saying?
                          (changing tracks)
                    We pay a lot of money in tuition to 
                    this school.  I think that entitles 
                    us to an opportunity to resolve 
                    this without an expulsion.

                    Now she s never demonstrated any 
                    behavior like this before --

                                  ELKORT
                    This is a total disregard of our 
                      institutional ideals.  
                          (then)
                    If I may, Mrs. Truman?  Tuition 
                    money is just the beginning of what 
                    we expect at this school.  And 
                    honestly, if this had happened with 
                    one of our other more... committed 
                    families, we d have more incentive 
                    to discuss a resolution...



      Grace s cell rings.  She enters, digs through her bag, pulls 
      it out and answers.

                    Grace... It s Simon.

      She goes stiff, looks outside, sees Neil on his phone call.

                                  GRACE
                    What are you doing?  I said never

                    I wanted to check up on you.

      Off that, we INTERCUT between Grace and Neil on their

                    Did I leave my phone at the house 
                    earlier?  I can t find it.

                                  GRACE
                    That s why you re calling me?

      There s a beat of silence.  Finally:                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  52.

                    go --

      She hangs up, turns back and sees Neil standing behind her.  
      How much did he hear?  A beat as they consider each other.

                                  NEIL
                    I need to go into the office.

                    Now?

      He turns and heads upstairs.  A beat later, he comes down 
      holding a suit and some dress shirts.

                    Neil...?

      And he s gone.  Grace walks to the front door to watch as 
      Neil hops in his car and goes.  As she stares at his tail 
      lights disappearing down the street, we CUT TO:



      A high-end boutique hotel.  Neil s car stops at the Valet.  
      He gets out, takes his ticket and looks to the entrance, 
      frozen.

      A DOORMAN opens the door.  Neil hesitates then enters.  He 
      pauses in the lobby, gathering his nerve then moves toward:



      Neil enters, moving slowly as he scans the faces throughout.

      He stops when he catches sight of a short-haired brunette 
      (MALLORY, 30s) sitting at the bar, nursing a cosmopolitan.  
      She gives him a small nod as if to say,  I m the one you re 
      looking for.   Neil approaches.

                    Simon?

      Neil holds out his hand to shake, second guesses himself, 
      then awkwardly leans in for a kiss.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  53.

                    Nice to meet you.

      He takes a seat, scans the bar, trying to hide his face in 
      case anyone might see him.

                                    MALLORY
                    Is everything alright?

                                  NEIL
                    Oh, yeah, fine.  I just haven t 
                    been here in a while.

      She gives him a polite smile. Neil s on the verge of bolting.

                                    MALLORY
                    Sorry I called in such a panic.

                                  NEIL
                    No, no -- I m sorry I m late.

      A beat.  Mallory is drawn to Neil s left hand.

                                    MALLORY
                    You re not really married are you?

      Neil looks down at his wedding ring.

                                  NEIL
                    Oh, this...yeah...I wear this 
                    sometimes to...give the appearance 
                    of -- yours is pretty.

      She shows him her wedding band; platinum, lots of diamonds.

                                    MALLORY
                    Thank you.

      She takes another heavy sip of her drink.  There s a long 
      awkward silence.  Finally:

                                    MALLORY (CONT D)
                    You came highly recommended, by the

                                  NEIL
                    Really?  By who?

      She hesitates.

                                  NEIL (CONT D)
                    That s okay, it s not important.

      Now Mallory s uncomfortable.

                                  NEIL (CONT D)
                    Silly question.  Why would anyone 
                    be here if they weren t married, 
                    right? 
                          (then)
                    Why are you here?

                                    MALLORY
                    You mean...what do I want?

                                  NEIL
                    Clearly we both know what you want.

      She s mortified, reaches for her purse, stands.

                                    MALLORY
                    This was a mistake --

      She starts to move off, Neil reaches for her.

                                  NEIL
                    No, wait, I m sorry.  I didn t mean 
                    it like that.  It s just... you re

                    that you d need to...
                          (off Mallory)
                    Can we start over?  Please.

      She considers him for a beat.

                                    MALLORY
                    This was really hard for me.  I ve 
                    never done anything like this

      Mallory laughs.

                    You seem so... normal.

      She hesitates, then nods.

                    ...and I ll have a vodka soda.

      Bartender nods, takes her glass and moves off.  Neil gestures 
      to the stool and Mallory retakes her seat.  After a beat.

                                    MALLORY
                    To answer your question, I m not 
                    sure what I want.

                                  NEIL
                    Why don t you just tell me why you 
                    called.

      Mallory considers how to say this.

                                    MALLORY
                    I ve been married a long time.  And 
                    I love my husband.  But he s just 
                    never around.

                                  NEIL
                    Works a lot?

                                    MALLORY
                    And even when he is home, he s on 
                    his laptop and completely ignores 
                    me when I try to talk to him.  
                    There s always some deadline he s 
                    worried about.

      That resonates for Neil -- he s done that with Grace.

                                  NEIL
                    I m sure he still cares about you.  
                    Men -- we feel a lot of pressure to 
                    perform at the office.

                                    MALLORY
                    I just wish he felt the same way 
                    about our marriage.
                          (off Neil)
                    I want to feel wanted.  No one has 
                    wanted me in so long.  

      More serious eye contact.  Neil reaches out and puts a hand 
      on her leg.  It s exhilarating.  For both of them.

      Mallory starts to move his hand up her leg.  As she pulls it 
      up farther and farther, the excitement building for both of 
      them, we CUT TO:                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  56.



      Grace rolls over, opens her eyes, realizes she s alone.  



      Grace enters.  

                                  GRACE
                    Neil?

      She looks at the flat screen in the living room, moves to:



      Clothes litter the floor; there s an empty champagne bottle 
      on the night stand.  Neil pops from under the covers when his

                    I turned my phone off.

                    of town again.  

      Another long pause.

                                  GRACE
                    Who s this new client, Neil?

      Neil looks in the bedroom, sees Mallory roll out of bed, 
      naked, start to get dressed.

                                  NEIL

                    I have to go, I ll call you later.

      He hangs up, reeling from his own behavior.  He takes a 
      moment to collect himself, then re-enters the bedroom.  
      Mallory nods to an envelope on a pillow.

                                    MALLORY
                    I put it all there -- plus tip.

      Neil takes it, looks inside -- must be a thousand dollars.

                    No I... Thank you.

      Mallory gives him a quick hug.  When she pulls back --

                    I hate to just run, but I want to 
                    get back home to Daniel, see if 
                      anything s changed now.

      She exits.  As Neil watches her go his smile fades -- he sees 
      he s still wearing his wedding ring.



      Grace steps off the elevator, approaches the reception desk, 
      really taking in the space.

      A large, open space with an alter at one end.  Neil sits

      The Zen Master considers Neil, then picks a lotus flower from 
      a vase, places it between them.

      Neil chuckles to himself, starting to crack.

                                  NEIL
                    You know what I see?  You re the 
                    one that s crazy.  I read your 
                    story about how the Buddha left his 
                    family?  It s insane.  If people 
                    like me give up everything, I m 
                      certifiable.  Course I could take

                    live like that --?

      Neil s cell starts to RING.  He empties his pockets to search 
      for his phone.  First he tosses some condoms on ground... a 
      thick stack of hundred dollar bills... finally he pulls out 
      Simon s phone.

                    Transfer the funds and I ll put you 
                    in touch... merci.

      As she continues to talk, Neil notices a SEXY YOUNG WOMAN 
      (VERONICA) reclined on a couch in the Living Room, smoking.  
      She is paying him no attention. 

      Adriana finally hangs up, looks to Veronica.

                                    ADRIANA (CONT D)
                    Darling, can you call George for 
                    me, tell him we re all set?                                       Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  63A.


      She crushes out her cigarette and slinks out of the room.  
      Adriana turns her attention to Neil now, approaches.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  64.


                                    ADRIANA (CONT D)
                    On time.  That s good.

      She offers a hand.  

                                    ADRIANA (CONT D)
                    Adriana.

      Neil takes it, gives it an awkward kiss.

                                  NEIL
                    Nice to meet you.

      She considers him for a moment like a dress on a sales rack.

                                    ADRIANA
                    Are those the only clothes you 
                    have, Simon?

                                  NEIL
                    I have a business suit in the car.
                          (off her look)
                    I didn t know what we were doing.

                                    ADRIANA
                    When a woman makes the date, you 
                    should always come prepared for any 
                    occasion.
                          (off Neil)
                    How big are you?

                                  NEIL
                    ...Do you mean like --?

                                    ADRIANA
                    Don t tell me, I want to guess.

      She circles him, running a hand along his torso.

                                    ADRIANA (CONT D)
                    Jacket, 44 regular.  Shirt, 18...

      She faces him up close, reaches down and grabs his crotch.  
      Considers her handful.

                                    ADRIANA (CONT D)
                    Size 11 shoe?

                                  NEIL
                    ...11 and a half.

                                    ADRIANA
                    You sure?                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  65.


                                  NEIL
                    Yep.  Pretty sure.

      She lets go, backs up and considers him once more.

                                    ADRIANA
                    Alright.  Let s get you out of 
                    those clothes... Come.

      As Adriana leads him off, we TIME CUT TO:



      Neil trails in after Adriana who leads him toward a closet 
      filled with designer shirts, shoes and jackets.

                                    ADRIANA
                    We re going to a fund raiser 
                    tonight.  There will be a lot men 
                    with a lot of money there.  You 
                    should be able to find something 
                    more stylish in here.

      Neil thumbs through some of the clothes.

                                  NEIL
                    Anything specific?

                                    ADRIANA
                    Something that will make me look 
                    good.

      She turns and exits.  Neil watches her go then turns back to 
      the closet.

      He thumbs through the shirts before settling on a tie rack... 
      sees a yellow one.  It freezes him.  As he pushes it aside, 
      we CUT TO:



      Neil re-enters dressed sharply in a fitted jacket with an 
      open collar shirt.  He looks dapper and sexy.

                                    ADRIANA
                    That looks great on you.  I want 
                    you to keep it.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  66.


                                  NEIL
                    Oh, no, I really can t.

                                    ADRIANA
                    Hmm.  Strike two now.  A woman s 
                      generosity should never be taken 
                    for granted.

      That lands hard with Neil.  He nods, embarrassed.

                                  NEIL
                    You re right.  Thank you.  I was 
                    just confused...
                            (approaches)
                    Because you stole the view right 
                    out of the room. You look gorgeous.

      Adriana cracks a slight smile, nods with approval.  

                                    ADRIANA
                    I was beginning to get a little 
                    worried about you.

      Neil holds out his arm.

                                  NEIL (cont d)
                    I just needed a little time to warm 
                    up.

      Adriana takes Neil s arm as he leads her toward the door.  As 
      he opens it for her, we MATCH CUT TO

      ANOTHER DOOR OPENING --

      As Grace enters:



      She closes the door, holding the bankers box and moves to:

      THE LIVING ROOM

      Just outside the kitchen.  She sets the bankers box down on 
      the long counter, lingering on the contents.  First she pulls 
      out a FAMILY PHOTOGRAPH -- happier times.  Then she notices a 
      book: Zen in the Modern World.  She pulls it out, curious -- 
      what was Neil doing reading this?  She flips through it for a 
      beat before she notices

      ANIKA 

      Asleep in the Den on a the couch, magazine on her chest, ear 
      buds in with MUSIC still playing.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  67.


      Grace goes to her, shuts off the music and pulls out the 
      earbuds.  She brushes the hair from her face, watches her 
      sleep... then starts to cry.  She stifles it when Anika stirs 
      awake.

                                  ANIKA
                    ...Mom?

                                  GRACE
                    Let s get you to bed.

      As Grace helps Anika from the couch and leads her off to bed, 
      we CUT TO:



      A large high-walled space filled with the upper crust who ve 
      come for a charity auction.  Neil and Adriana enter, weave 
      their way through the crowd ogling the art on the walls.

                                    ADRIANA
                    ...so we re here tonight as friends 
                    of the gallery owner.  All proceeds 
                    from this auction will go to help 
                    build wells for water in Africa.  
                    You re familiar with those 
                    politics?  
                          (off Neil)
                    Good.  Now look at this.

      They make their way through the crowd and over to:

                                    ADRIANA (cont d) (CONT D)
                      I absolutely have to have it.

      CLOSE ON THE PAINTING/PHOTOGRAPH: It s an abstract piece with 
      what looks like two lovers underwater.

                                  NEIL
                      Beautiful...

      As he drinks in the painting, an attractive Older Woman (the 
      GALLERY OWNER) approaches with a younger, HANDSOME MAN.

                                    GALLERY OWNER
                    Adriana --
                          (introducing)
                    You know Dane...

                                    ADRIANA
                    Of course.  Nice to see you.  And 
                    this is Simon.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  68.


      A brief beat of introductions as everyone shakes hands.

                                    GALLERY OWNER
                    Can you come with me?  There s some 
                    friends I d love you to meet.

      As Adriana and Neil move off we BEGIN MONTAGE: 

      Neil and Adriana are introduced to various men and women, all 
      of whom appear to carry some weight in the world.  Neil seems 
      at ease in conversation, laughing and holding his own.  
      Adriana is clearly impressed with his social skills.  As the 
      montage comes to an end, we HEAR A VOICE over a loudspeaker.

                                  VOICE
                    Ladies and gentlemen, five minutes 
                    until we close bids.  Thank you.

      Adriana turns to Neil, rattled.

                                    ADRIANA
                    The piece I wanted.  We never bid.

                                  NEIL
                    I ll take care of it.  
                          (off Adriana s concern)
                    If there s one thing I know know 
                    how to do, it s close a deal.

      Neil hustles back to the auction, finds an AUCTIONEER pacing 
      the rows of merchandise with an IPad (you give your assigned 
      number, he enters the bid).  Neil pulls out the wad of 
      hundreds he got earlier from Mallory, palms a bunch.

                                  AUCTIONEER
                    Would you like to bid, sir?
                          (off Neil)
                    Just tell me your assigned number, 
                    I can go ahead and do it for you.  
                    Which item?

      Neil motions to the art piece.

                                  NEIL
                    And my number is Five-zero-zero.

      Auctioneer types...frowns.

                                  AUCTIONEER
                    I m sorry, that s not coming up.

                                  NEIL
                    Sure it is.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  69.


      Neil slips the Auctioneer five hundred dollar bills.

                                  NEIL (CONT D)
                    You know who s bid on that and how 
                    much.  I need to go home with it 
                    tonight.

      Auctioneer casually slips the money in his pocket.

                                  AUCTIONEER
                    Of course, sir.  What was that 
                    number again?

                                  NEIL
                    Try one-seven-five.

      Auctioneer puts it in -- voila.

                                  AUCTIONEER
                    I think you re all set.

      Neil nods and Auctioneer moves off just as --

                                    CHARLES
                    Is that Neil Truman?

      Neil turns, sees CHARLES LIPTON, 60s, approaching.  You d 
      only need look at him from afar to guess he s very rich and 
      very powerful.  And you d be right.

                                    CHARLES (CONT D)
                    You work with O Connell at Apex 
                      Financial, right?  
                          (offers his hand)
                    Charles Lipton.

      Neil immediately recognizes the name -- it s like saying 
      Buffet.  He puts his game face on.

                                  NEIL
                      Charles... I thought that was you. 
                    Nice to see you.
                          (they shake)
                    How are they treating your money 
                    over there at... Montgomery, was 
                    it?

                                    CHARLES
                    Like I pissed on it before I handed 
                    it over.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  70.


                                  NEIL
                      Everyone s getting killed in this 
                    market right now.  I wouldn t let 
                    it worry you.  In the short term.

      Charles looks suddenly concerned.

                                    CHARLES
                    Do you know something I don t?

                                  NEIL
                    Of course.  If I didn t, how could 
                    I do my job?

                                    CHARLES
                    From what I hear, you re doing it 
                    very well these days.  
                          (then)
                    Maybe you d like to take a look at 
                    my portfolio, tell me what you 
                    think.

                                  NEIL
                    You know what, Charles?  If you re 
                    really looking for some answers, I 
                    got just the thing.

      Neil turns, plucks a flower out of a vase, hands it to him.

                                  NEIL (CONT D)
                    If you concentrate, all you need to 
                    know is right here.

      Off Charles  confusion, Adriana walks up.

                                    ADRIANA
                    ...hope I m not interrupting.

      She slips her arm into Neil s, motions for him to make the 
      introduction.

                                  NEIL
                    Adriana, this is Charles, Charles, 
                    Adriana.

      Charles turns to Adriana like a drunk uncle.

                                    CHARLES
                    Can you please tell your husband I 
                    need his help.  He s being coy with 
                    me. 

      Adriana looks to Neil -- husband?                                           Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  71.


                                  NEIL
                          (to Charles, sotto)
                    I m not being coy, Charles.  I m 
                    trying to be polite.  Because I m 
                    really not interested in helping 
                    you.

      He motions for Adriana to go.  As they move off, Adriana 
      looks to Neil.  

                                    ADRIANA
                    Who was that?

                                  NEIL 
                    Someone from another life.

      As the Auctioneer calls for everyone s attention and Neil 
      guides Adriana off, WE CUT TO:



      SOUNDS of lovemaking.  CAMERA tracks through the home toward:



      CAMERA enters, finds Adriana, riding Neil and arching her 
      back just as they surrender together then fall apart.

                                    ADRIANA
                    Whew, I needed that.  Thank you.

      Adriana rolls off Neil, pulls the covers up around her before 
      leaning over to a night stand and taking a hit off a still-
      lit joint.  She exhales, considers the new painting above the 
      bed before grabbing an envelope and tossing it to Neil.

                                    ADRIANA (CONT D)
                    You can take a shower before you go 
                    if you d like.

      As if he s already gone, Adriana grabs a LAPTOP from the same 
      night stand, tunes Neil out as she focuses on checking her 
      email.  Neil watches her for a beat before getting out of bed 
      to get dressed, casually looks at the cash in the envelope -- 
      and he s confused. 

                                    ADRIANA (CONT D)
                          (without looking up)
                    It s sixty percent less than what 
                    we discussed on the phone.  My cut.                                       Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  71A.


                                  NEIL
                    ...your cut?

      Adriana looks up for the first time.  Neil suddenly senses a 
      larger picture.

                                  NEIL (CONT D)
                    What s this all been about?*                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  72.


                                    ADRIANA
                    Since you didn t figure it out from *
                    the party... I have a service that *
                    caters to very rich, very busy and *
                    very picky women who are looking 
                    for a man and not a husband.  And 
                    usually only for an evening.
                          (off Neil)
                    I d been hearing about you for 
                    awhile.  Word does travel in 
                    certain circles.  And because I m *
                    always on the look out for new *
                    talent... A little test drive *
                    before I make the offer.

                                  NEIL
                    So this whole evening has been some *
                    sort of job interview.

                                    ADRIANA
                    Come work for me.  I think you d *
                    really appreciate how much your 
                    business will improve.  Unless you *
                    like banging all those lonely 
                      housewives you ve been filling your 
                    phonebook with.

                                  NEIL
                    Yeah.  Not interested.*

      Neil picks up the pace now as he gets dressed, wants to get 
      the hell out of here now.

                                    ADRIANA
                    What were you before?  
                          (off Neil s silence)
                    You re not the typical personal 
                    trainer or model I usually come 
                    across.  You have...a soul.

                                  NEIL
                    I managed other people s money.  I 
                    was pretty sure I didn t have a 
                    soul anymore.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  73.


                                    ADRIANA
                    Well thankfully it s not a 
                      requirement for the job.  Though it 
                    is a plus.

      Neil turns to her, fully dressed now and ready to go.

                                  NEIL
                    Thank you.  For a lovely evening.

      He heads for the door as --

                                    ADRIANA
                    When you re ready to make a real 
                    change, I ll be here for you... 

      Neil turns back to consider her for a long beat, then exits.  
      As Adriana smiles, goes back to her work, we...

                                          ACT FOUR



      Grace stirs awake after a horrible night s sleep.



      Grace comes to the doorway, finds Anika strumming her guitar, 
      working on another song.  Soon as she sees Grace she stops.

                                  ANIKA
                          (re: the song)
                    Don t worry, it s not about you.

      Grace comes in, sits across from her.  Takes her hand.  And 
      places something inside it.  Anika s opens her palm and we 
      see a set of CAR KEYS.

                                  GRACE
                    One hour.  No freeways, just 
                    surface streets.  Five miles under 
                    the speed limit at all times.  And 
                    if I see you texted someone after 
                    you left this house, I m going to 
                    home school you and never let you 
                    have any friends.  Is that 
                      understood?  

      Anika looks at her mom, shocked, confused... excited.

                                  ANIKA
                    Can I bring my Ipod?
                          (off Grace)
                    That s okay, I can just listen to 
                    the radio.

                                  GRACE
                    No you can t listen to the radio.
                          (then)
                    Just not too loud.

      Anika jumps up, races for the door.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  75.


                                  GRACE (CONT D)
                    Hey --

      She turns back.

                                  GRACE (CONT D)
                    Thank you?

      Anika rushes back to her mom, gives her a big hug.

                                  ANIKA
                    If you see my real mom, tell I 
                    think she s amazing.

                                  GRACE
                    Believe it or not...

      She pulls back from Anika.

                                  GRACE (CONT D)
                    This is your real mom.

      Anika turns and rushes out.  As Grace watches her go, uneasy 
      now, we CUT TO:



      Neil sits behind the wheel, staring at his front door -- 
        KNOCK-KNOCK.

      Neil s startled, turns and sees his neighbor and gym-buddy 
      Lawrence tapping on the passenger-side window, motioning for 
      him to roll it down.  As he does:

                                  LAWRENCE
                    Check out what I just got --

      Lawrence points to two WORKMEN across the street moving a 
      giant flat-screen TV box out of a Van.

                                  LAWRENCE (cont d) (CONT D)
                    104 inches of high-def, 3D, LCD 
                    clarity, baby.  Biggest on the 
                    market.  What do you think?

                                  NEIL
                      Congratulations.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  76.


                                  LAWRENCE
                    Superbowl at my house this year, 
                    okay?  Got the speakers hooked up, 
                    gonna feel like you re taking the 
                    snap yourself.  

                                  NEIL
                    ...look forward to it.

      Lawrence squeals with delight as he practically skips back to 
      his house.  Neil gets out of the car.



      Neil enters, gently closes the door behind him.  He takes a 
      beat to steel himself before:

                                  NEIL
                    Grace?

                                  GRACE (O.S.)
                    In here.



      Neil enters and stops short.  Grace is sitting at the kitchen 
      table with Victor.

                                  VICTOR
                    You wanna hear something funny?  
                    Your wife actually staged the house 
                    I bought two years ago.  
                          (to Grace, realizes)
                    Y'know, I think we kept half that 
                      furniture, too.

      Neil half-smiles, trying to act casual.  Victor rises, looks 
      to Grace.

                                  VICTOR (CONT D)
                    Mind if I steal him for a bit?



      Grace watches intently at the window as Neil calmly and 
        methodically talks to Victor, tries to read his body 
      language.  Finally, Neil holds out his hand and Victor moves 
      it away -- grabs Neil and hugs him tight, all smiles.  Victor 
      peels off, walks out of the yard and disappears.



      Elkort reads from a file folder, looks up at Neil and Grace 
      who sit across his desk.

                                  ELKORT
                    How exactly did you --?

                                  NEIL
                    This school s accounting firm 
                    happens to work closely with my 
                    office.  
                                  (MORE)                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  80.

                                  NEIL (CONT'D)
                    I had them send over your filings 
                    so I could crunch the numbers on 
                    the endowment. Frankly it was 
                    criminal the returns you were 
                    getting.  By allowing me to roll 
                    those monies into some of the 
                    bigger hedge funds I manage, you ll 
                    begin to see consistent double 
                    digit gains in the next ten years.

      Elkort is trying to do the math in his head.

                                  GRACE
                    My husband is very good at what he 
                    does, so if he says he can do it, 
                    then he can do it.

      Neil looks to Grace -- that s the first time he ever heard 
      her take pride in his work.

                                  ELKORT
                    This is very generous of you.
                          (then)
                    What s the catch?

                                  GRACE
                    Anika serves a one week suspension.  
                    After she writes a letter of 
                    apology to the school and the 
                    teachers, she will be readmitted 
                    and there will be no mark on her 
                    record.  This all goes away.

      Elkort studies them both.

                                  ELKORT
                    I m not sure it s as simple a fix 
                    as you re making it sound.

                                  NEIL
                    I m not sure the school s board of 
                    directors would appreciate an 
                      investigation into allegations of 
                    faculty affairs either.

      Grace pulls out a business card, lays it on the desk.

                                  GRACE
                    We ve contacted an attorney.  If 
                    you d like to have him explain it 
                    to you in more detail, feel free to 
                    give him a call.

      As Elkort considers the card, then the file folder, CUT TO:                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  81.



      Neil s car pulls in and he drives past his usual spot to 
      another one closer to the elevator with his name on it.  He 
      parks, gets out.  He considers the plaque for a moment, then 
      turns to head for the elevator when --                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  82.


                                  VOICE
                    So this is your real job...

      Neil turns, Simon has been waiting for him.

                                  SIMON
                    Grace told me you were some 
                    financial guy.  Looks like you do 
                    okay for yourself.

      Simon approaches Neil now, calm but menacing.

                                  SIMON (CONT D)
                    I know you had my phone, I know you 
                    slept with one of my clients.  That 
                    bartender at the hotel is a friend 
                    of mine.

      Neil looks around the parking lot -- who s seeing this?

                                  SIMON (CONT D)
                    What d you do with all my contacts?  
                    I can t access them online anymore.

      Neil turns back, bold now.

                                  SIMON (CONT D)
                    That s my livelihood, man.  What 
                    are you trying to do to me?

                                  NEIL
                    Same thing you did to my wife, I 
                    think.

      Simon half-laughs -- touch .  The smile fades quickly.

                                  SIMON
                    I know where you live, now I know 
                    where you work.  You don t undo 
                    what you did, I m coming after you.  
                    You got it?

      Now Neil moves in close to Simon, matching his attitude.

                                  NEIL
                    That s not a threat, you know what 
                    a real threat is?  The IRS looking 
                    into your finances for the last ten 
                    years and discovering exactly what 
                    you do for a living.  And as 
                    personal friends of mine, all it 
                    would take is one phone call.

      A tense beat.

                                  DARRYL
                    Yo -- 

      Neil turns as Darryl saunters up.

                                  DARRYL (CONT D)
                    I heard the good news.  We got our 
                    clean up hitter back.  Awesome.

      Darryl steps up, sees Simon.

                                  DARRYL (CONT D)
                    How you doin ?  Darryl.  
                          (re: Neil)
                    You know this prick?

                                  NEIL
                    No.  He doesn t.

                                  DARRYL
                          (to Simon)
                    Lucky you.  Massive pain in the 
                    ass.
                          (to Neil)
                    I m just kiddin.  
                          (back to Simon)
                    Most talented guy in the firm.  
                    Truly.  And a great guy.

                                  NEIL
                    Why don t you go grab the elevator.

                                  DARRYL
                    ...So that s how it s gonna be now, 
                    huh?  New title, new parking space 
                    make the monkey s dance.
                          (off Neil)
                    Of course, my liege.
                          (to Simon)
                    Nice to meet you.

      Darryl moves off.  Neil looks back to Simon.

                                  NEIL
                    There anything else you wanted to 
                    discuss?

      Simon considers Neil for a moment.

                                  SIMON
                    Tell Grace I said hello.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  84.


      He turns and exits.  DING.  Neil turns, sees Darryl waving.

                                  NEIL (V.O.)
                    I ve been thinking a lot about that 
                    story again lately.  

      As Neil joins Darryl at elevator and steps inside, CUT TO:



      Grace sits at the kitchen table on her laptop.

                                  NEIL (V.O.)
                    About the Buddha leaving his family 
                    to search for meaning...?

      She hits a few keys, leans in close and we go:

      CLOSE ON THE SCREEN:

      It s a travel site.  Florence.  Options abound.

                                  NEIL (V.O.)
                    ...It didn t really make much sense 
                    when I first read it.  



      Neil browses a row phones as a SALES ASSOCIATE approaches.

                                  NEIL (V.O.)
                    I mean, what kind of man would you 
                    have to be to leave everything 
                    you ve ever loved to search for the 
                    meaning of it all?
