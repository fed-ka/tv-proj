            Benton stands alone by the window.  He's stopped crying
          now; simply stares out, desolate, lost.  JEANIE BOULET 
            enters.  He doesn't turn, doesn't see her.  She watches
          him, then...

                                                                          (CONTINUED)          ER - "Motherhood" - Rev. 5/5/9567.

                                              JEANIE
                          Peter...

          He still doesn't turn, still at sea.  But he smiles.  A
            small, slight half-smile, only to himself.

                                              BENTON
                                    (soft, reflective)
                          All our capabilities.
                                    (then)
                          Said those words how many times?
                          Never actually heard them until
                          today.

            Jeanie moves closer.

                                              JEANIE
                          I'm sorry, Peter.

          He turns now, looks at her.  His emotions right up to the
            surface.  He reins them in, struggling to keep control.

                                              BENTON
                          Jackie took the kids home.  Way
                          past their dinner.  I told her I'd
                          finish up here.

          He can feel himself slipping, tries to dodge it.

                                              BENTON
                          Thought I'd be more prepared for
                          this.

                                              JEANIE
                          No one's prepared.

                                              BENTON
                          They said we can come back
                          tomorrow, get the rest of her
                          things and...

          He breaks off, his emotions welling up.  

                                              BENTON
                        I sat beside her.  Held her hand.
                          Touched her face.  Her skin was so
                          soft... And for just one moment I
                          thought maybe I could stay there
                          forever.

          He looks at Jeanie now, helpless, asking with complete
            innocence...

                                                                          (CONTINUED)          ER - "Motherhood" - Rev. 5/5/9567A/68.

                                              BENTON
                          But I can't do that, can I?  I
                          can't hold onto her.  I can't
                          touch her.
                                    (then)
                        I can't do anything to keep her.

          And he can no longer keep back the tears.  Raw, vulner-
            able, eviscerated.  Finally giving in to his grief.

            Jeanie takes his hand in hers.  Then slowly reaches up,
            touches his face, turning it toward her.

          He looks at her now and they slowly move closer to each
            other.  Into a kiss.  Gentle at first, then more.

            Finally, they break apart and Benton pulls Jeanie's head
            close to his chest, holds onto her.

          And she holds onto him.
                                                                        CUT TO:

65OB HALLWAY - NIGHT65

          It's late and mercifully quiet.  Lewis walks down.

  66CHLOE'S ROOM - NIGHT66

          She moves in.  The lights are off.  Moonlight streams in
            through the blinds.Chloe's sound asleep, the baby
            tucked securely at her side.

            Lewis moves up to the bed, reaches down, pushes Chloe's
          hair back from her eyes.  Then she picks up the baby,
            crosses, sits in a chair by the window.

          The shadows shift gently across her face as she rocks
          this new little life.  And quietly begins to sing.

                                              LEWIS
                          'Blackbird singing in the dead of
      night...
                          Take these broken wings and learn
                           to fly...
                          All your life...
                          You were only waiting for this
                           moment to arise...
                                    (and)
                          You were only waiting for this
                           moment to arise...'

          On this quiet moment...

                                                                        FADE OUT.

                                               THE END
