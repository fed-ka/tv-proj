    INT. RYAN S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

    The kind of house in Venice a young professional can afford if 
    he doesn t spend his money doing anything fun.  RYAN (about 
    30, handsome, wound too tight), in shirtsleeves and a tie, 
    works feverishly on his laptop.  He stops suddenly and smiles.  

                                RYAN
                  Nailed it!

    He presses a key and walks away.  The printer HUMS to life.

    INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

    Ryan happily pours milk in a blender.  He adds a banana, an 
    entire bottle of prescription pills, and a scoop of  FIT FOR 
    LIFE MEAL SUPPLEMENT.   He flips the blender switch on.

    INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

    Ryan reviews his suicide note as he casually sips his drink, 
    unaware that it has given him a frothy death-cocktail milk 
    mustache.  He glances out the window.

    RYAN S POV - OUTSIDE

    JENNA, his neighbor, is at her mailbox.  She s mid-20s and 
    irresistible.  

    ANGLE ON RYAN.  Totally smitten.

                                RYAN
                  So long, Girl Next Door.  Sorry I 
                  never had the guts to do more than 
                  wave awkwardly from my window.

    She notices Ryan watching her.  He waves awkwardly.  She waves 
    back.  Two neighbors who don t really know each other.  

                                RYAN (CONT D)
                  Hope they find my body before the 
                  smell becomes a problem for you.

    He slurps down the rest of his drink, then dons his jacket and 
      straightens his tie.          WILFRED "Pilot"                    3/26/10             2.


    INT. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

    Ryan lays on his bed, closes his eyes and smiles.  It won t be 
    long now.  The silence is shattered when a big-ass motorcycle 
    RUMBLES down the back alley, rattling the bedroom window.  
    Ryan sits up, pissed.

    EXT. RYAN S BACK YARD - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

    The ROAR of the bike is deafening.  Ryan storms across his 
    meticulously maintained lawn and looks over his back fence.

    RYAN S POV - ACROSS THE ALLEY

    Fenced yards and carports line the alley.  SPENCER, a scary-
    looking dude in his 40 s, sits atop his idling bike in his 
    carport.  He removes his helmet, glancing in Ryan s direction.

    ANGLE ON RYAN 

    Ryan quickly ducks down, furious, wishing he had the courage to 
    say something.  Spencer cuts the engine and the roar abruptly 
    quiets, allowing Ryan to hear the shouting of an (o.s.) irate 
    neighbor with an Australian accent.

                                MAN S VOICE
                  Fuck me, that s loud!  It s the 
                  middle of the bloody night!

    DOLLY ZOOM ON RYAN.  His expression suggests he s aware this 
    is a significant moment in his life, even if he doesn t yet 
    understand why.  He looks in the direction of the voice and 
    realizes it s coming from next door.  Jenna s house.   

                                JENNA (O.S.)
                  Wilfred, that s enough!

                                RYAN
                  (TO HIMSELF) Boyfriend.  Figures.

                                MAN S VOICE
                  You re lucky I m indoors, you prick!  
                  If I see that thing on the street, 
                  I ll punch your ass into your face!

    Jenna appears in her window and slides it closed.

                                JENNA
                  Stop it!

                                MAN S VOICE
                  Christ!  You know how long it took me 
                  to get comfortable?

    Jenna closes the blinds.  Ryan waits, but the yelling stops.  
    He heads back inside.          WILFRED "Pilot"                    3/26/10             3.


    INT. BEDROOM - A LITTLE LATER

    Ryan lays in bed, eyes closed, finally at peace.  He looks 
    dead.  Then his fingers begin tapping impatiently.  He sits 
    up, checks the clock.  It s 1:25 am.  UPBEAT MUSIC kicks in.  

    BEGIN RYAN S SLEEPLESS NIGHT MONTAGE.

    INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

    Ryan is on his laptop.  He googles:  How long does it take to 
    overdose?   He studies the results, then checks the empty pill 
    bottle label.  This should be working.  What the hell?

    INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

    Ryan s on the couch, watching one of  THE GODFATHER  movies on 
    cable.  He glances at the clock.  It s almost 3:00 am.  Why 
    isn t he dead yet?  He is seriously annoyed.

    INT. SHOWER - LATER THAT NIGHT

    Ryan is jerking off.

    INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

    Ryan punches a key on his laptop and walks away.  The printer 
    HUMS to life.

     Printing  Suicide Note -- Fourth Revised.doc  

    INT. KITCHEN - LATER THAT NIGHT

    The clock reads 4:20 am.  Ryan, shirt untucked, tie askew, 
    scrubs the counter, furious that he s still breathing.

    END OF MONTAGE

    INT. BATHROOM - A LITTLE LATER

    Ryan looks haggard as a tweaker.  He searches the medicine 
    cabinet for more pills, but all he finds is a half-full bottle 
    of cough syrup.  He downs it, grimacing at the taste.  

    The DOORBELL RINGS.  He checks the clock.  7:30 AM.  He pulls 
    back the blackout curtains.  Blinding sunlight.  Unfortunate.

    INT. FRONT DOOR - MOMENTS LATER

    Ryan opens the door, surprised to see Jenna.  She looks 
    frazzled and sports a canvas bag slung over her shoulder.  

                                JENNA
                  Hi-- Whoa!

    She reacts to his appearance.  He tries to fix his hair.          WILFRED "Pilot"                    3/26/10             4.


                                RYAN
                  (TRYING TO BE COOL) How ya doing?

                                JENNA
                  I live next door.  We ve waved.  

                                RYAN
                  Yeah, of course.  I m Ryan.

                                JENNA
                  Jenna.  I ve been meaning to come 
                  over and introduce myself but people 
                  don t really do that, do they?  

                                RYAN
                  No, it s kind of awkward.

                                JENNA
                  It is. (THEN) This is. (THEN) Can I 
                  get you something?  Orange juice?  
                  Medical attention?

                                RYAN
                  I m okay.  Just lack of sleep.

                                JENNA
                  Oh god, I know, that stupid jerk and 
                  his motorcycle.  It drives Wilfred 
                  nuts.  Sorry about all the noise he 
                  made, by the way.

                                RYAN
                  Hey, he just said what we were all 
                  thinking, right?

    He smiles.  Jenna smiles, confused.

                                JENNA
                  I guess. (THEN) Look, I know we just 
                  met and this is a huge imposition, but 
                  I m totally desperate.  The 
                  exterminator is on his way and I 
                  forgot to make arrangements for my... 

    ANGLE ON RYAN.  JENNA S VOICE FADES to a distant echo, drowned 
    out by the HEARTBEAT in Ryan s ears.  He s staring past Jenna.

    RYAN S POV  

    On the front walk is a man with thick stubble and a blackened 
    nose.  He wears a very cheap dog suit and stands with his arms 
    crossed, staring implacably at Ryan.  This is WILFRED.

    ANGLE ON RYAN, nonplussed.  (We no longer hear the heartbeat.)

                                JENNA (CONT D)
                  ...so would you mind if he stayed in 
                  your yard til I get home from work?            WILFRED "Pilot"                    3/26/10             5.


                                RYAN
                  (SNAPPING OUT OF IT) Huh?

                                JENNA
                  (MISREADING HIS HESITANCY) You re 
                  right, it s too much to ask--

                                RYAN
                  No, it s not that--

                                JENNA
                  Great!  (CALLING) Wilfred!  C mere, 
                  boy! (TO RYAN) He s really sweet. 

    Wilfred goes to Jenna, who rubs his tummy.  He smiles and 
    casually drapes his arm around her, like a boyfriend might do,  
    staring all the while at Ryan, who tries to wrap his mind 
    around the fact that Jenna clearly thinks this is a real dog.  

                                JENNA (CONT D)
                  There s my widdle man! (TO RYAN) You 
                  like dogs?

                                RYAN
                  Yeah.

    Jenna hands him the bag. 

                                JENNA
                  Here s a few of his toys and some 
                  snacks.  I really appreciate this. 
                  (TO WILFRED) Be a good boy!

    She hugs Wilfred, who stoically watches her go.  Ryan stares 
    at him, utterly confused.  Wilfred waits for a beat, then 
    casts a doubtful look at Ryan and enters the house.

    INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

    Ryan drops the canvas bag by the sofa where Wilfred brushes 
    the cushion with his paw, plumps a pillow, spins around in 
    place twice, then sits.  They stare at each other in awkward 
    silence, then:

                                WILFRED
                  (RE: SOFA) Very nice.  

    Ryan stifles a small yelp at the sound of Wilfred s voice.  

                                WILFRED (CONT D)
                  Some sofas it s impossible to get 
                  comfortable. (THEN) Ryan, is it?

                                RYAN
                  Yes.

                                WILFRED
                  Got any DVDs?            WILFRED "Pilot"                    3/26/10             6.


                                RYAN
                  A few. 

                                WILFRED
                  I like Matt Damon.

                                RYAN
                  Yeah, he s good.

    The phone RINGS, startling Ryan.  He checks the caller ID. 

                                RYAN (CONT D)
                  (APOLOGETIC) It s my sister. 

                                WILFRED
                  Just pretend I m not here.

    Ryan nods and answers the phone.

                                RYAN
                  Hi, Kristen.

    INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

    KRISTEN (30 s, attractive, self-important, sour), dressed in 
    scrubs, is on her cell in the maternity ward hallway.    

                                KRISTEN
                  Are you excited?

    INTERCUT

                                RYAN
                  I don t know what I am.  

                                KRISTEN
                  You re starting a new job.  A little 
                  anxiety is to be expected.  That s 
                  why I prescribed those pills.  

                                RYAN
                  (OFF THE EMPTY PILL BOTTLE) Yeah, 
                  about those--

    He spots Wilfred gazing out the sliding glass door at the 
    yard.

                                RYAN (CONT D)
                  (TO WILFRED) Do you need to go out?

    Wilfred is clearly surprised and insulted by the question.  He 
    shakes his head with a tight smile.  He walks around, checking 
    out Ryan s DVD collection, the artwork on his walls, etc.  
    Ryan eyes him nervously.

                                KRISTEN
                  Who are you talking to?          WILFRED "Pilot"                    3/26/10             7.


                                RYAN
                  No one. (THEN) Look, the thing is, I 
                  appreciate your help getting me this 
                  job at the hospital and all, but I m 
                  not sure working in Contract 
                    Administration will make me... happy.

                                KRISTEN
                  (BEAT, STEAMED)  Happy?  You want to 
                  be happy?  You think Dad is happy? 

                                RYAN
                  No, I know, I screwed up, but--  

                                KRISTEN
                  You think I m happy?  You think I 
                  love pulling out babies 24/7?  I just 
                  had a ninety-pound mother who 
                  insisted on a vaginal delivery for 
                  her ten-pound mutant child.  By the 
                  time I cut her and pried Baby Huey 
                  out, her perineum looked like steak 
                  tartar.  Think that made me happy? 

    Ryan grimaces.  He turns to find Wilfred very close to him. 

                                WILFRED
                  I need some water.

                                RYAN
                  (COVERS MOUTHPIECE) Huh?

                                WILFRED
                  Water.

    Ryan nods and heads into:

    INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

    Ryan takes a bowl to the sink, then stops, unsure.  He picks 
    up a drinking glass, trying to decide which is appropriate for 
    this situation.  The cough syrup is making it hard to think

                                KRISTEN
                  Nobody s happy, Ryan.  And face it, 
                  you re not exactly a hot commodity 
                  anymore.  You need this job.

                                RYAN
                  Okay, thanks for the pep talk.  

                                KRISTEN
                  I ll see you when you get in.  
                  Remember, it s all about perception.  
                  You just have to change the way 
                  you re seeing things.

    Ryan glances at Wilfred through the pass-through.          WILFRED "Pilot"                    3/26/10             8.


                                RYAN
                  (INTO PHONE) I ll work on that. 

    INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

    Ryan sets down a glass of water for Wilfred.  He waits, unsure.  

                                WILFRED
                  Have a seat.  I ain t gonna bite ya.  

    Ryan sits.

                                WILFRED (CONT D)
                  Biting s the easy way out.  Not that 
                  I don t think about it.  Believe me, 
                  I do the best I can under extremely 
                  trying circumstances, but sometimes, 
                  I look at certain individuals and I 
                  wonder, why not just do it?  You 
                  know, just rip into their throat, get 
                   em right in the jumbler.

                                RYAN
                  (NERVOUS) Jugular.

                                WILFRED
                  Jumbler.

                                RYAN
                  (CAN T HELP HIMSELF) Jugular.

                                WILFRED
                  ( WHATEVER ) In the neck.

    He suddenly moves toward Ryan, who flinches.  Wilfred reaches 
    past him to retrieve the canvas bag.  Ryan is embarrassed.

                                WILFRED (CONT D)
                  (SMIRKS) Bit jumpy, are we?   

                                RYAN
                  No, I m cool.

    Wilfred pulls a bong from the canvas bag and pours the glass 
    of water into its reservoir.  He takes a deep hit.

                                WILFRED
                  I m seven years old, Ryan.  Too old 
                  and too wise for lies.  I can smell 
                  your fear like I smell the sour milk 
                  in your fridge.

                                RYAN
                  I had milk last night.  It was fine.

                                WILFRED
                  It was, but now it s gone bad.  Just 
                  happened.  While we were talking.            WILFRED "Pilot"                    3/26/10             9.


    Wilfred offers the bong to Ryan, who refuses it.

                                RYAN
                  I m starting a new job today.

                                WILFRED
                  Ryan, you re not going to work today.

    Ryan realizes he s right and takes a bong hit.  He coughs. 

                                WILFRED (CONT D)
                  (SMIRKS) Gotta cough to get off.  

                                RYAN
                  (HOARSE) It s been a while.  Can you 
                  really smell the milk in my fridge?

                                WILFRED
                  My nose is a very exquisite and 
                  sensitive organ.  I can detect with 
                  that nose worlds of fragrances, 
                  smells, and what-have-you, that I 
                  cannot even begin to share with you.  
                  And I am currently smelling fear.  
                  Fear, sour milk, and human shit.

                                RYAN
                  You mean me?  I just showered.  I m 
                  crazy clean back there.

                                WILFRED
                  There are such things in this world 
                  as particles.  Particles of shit that 
                  are so small that you couldn t 
                  possibly detect it with your naked 
                  eyes.  And I put it to you that there 
                  are particles of human shit lingering 
                  in the fibers of your underpants. 

                                RYAN
                  I don t think there s any particles.  

                                WILFRED
                  Mate, I m telling you.  There are 
                  particles.  And they are lingering.

    Ryan is fading fast, sinking back in his chair.

                                RYAN
                  I need to sleep.

    Wilfred exhales the smoke directly in Ryan s face.

                                WILFRED
                  Lights out, Ryan.


                                  END OF ACT ONE        WILFRED "Pilot"                    3/26/10             10.


                                        ACT TWO

    BLACK SCREEN

    A phone is RINGING.

    INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

    Ryan wakes up groggy.  No sign of the man/dog.  How long has 
    he been asleep?  He looks at: 

    THE TV

     The Bourne Identity  is on.  A CLOSE SHOT of Matt Damon as he 
    wakes up groggy.  Just like Ryan did.

    ANGLE ON RYAN

    He ponders this.  The phone rings.  He checks the caller ID.

                                RYAN
                  Shit. (INTO PHONE) Hel--

    INT. HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS

    Kristen talks on her cell.

                                KRISTEN
                  You are so dead!  

    INTERCUT

    Ryan clocks the empty pill bottle.  Hmm.  She might be right.

                                KRISTEN (O.S.) (CONT D)
                  I vouched for you, and now you re a 
                  no show on your first day of work?    
                  Dr. Ramos is furious.  

                                RYAN
                  I m sorry, I m on my way in now.  I 
                  just had a tough morning. 

                                KRISTEN
                  Oh boo-hoo, Ryan!  You want a tough 
                  morning?  Try pulling twin boys out 
                  of a tight little Asian gal.  Not 
                    Asian-American.  Real Asian.  I had 
                  to do so much cutting and slicing it 
                  looked like a Benihana s down there.  
                  Just get your shit together and come 
                  to work!

    INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

    The phone goes dead.  Ryan sighs and pours himself a glass of 
    milk.  He spots something outside through the window:        WILFRED "Pilot"                    3/26/10             11.


    RYAN S POV - THE FRONT YARD

    A grey dog sniffs at some bushes.  An actual dog.

    BACK ON RYAN

    Ryan laughs at himself, relieved.  He takes a sip of milk, 
    then spits it out, disgusted.  He sniffs the carton.  It s 
    spoiled.  That means--   

                                WILFRED
                  Nice nap, Ryan?

    Wilfred is right behind him.  Startled, Ryan drops the milk.

                                WILFRED (CONT D)
                  Oh, scared you, eh?  Gave you quite a 
                  fright, did I?

                                RYAN
                  (BEAT) Am I dead?

    Wilfred grabs Ryan s nipple and twists it.  Hard. 

                                RYAN (CONT D)
                  Ow!

                                WILFRED
                  Seems not. (THEN) C mon, I want to 
                  show you something.

    EXT. RYAN S BACK YARD - MOMENTS LATER

    Ryan and Wilfred look at the once pristine lawn, now marred by 
    a dozen freshly dug holes.  Ryan is apoplectic.

                                RYAN
                  What did you--?  Why?! 

                                WILFRED
                  Anxiety.  Jenna s been away too long.  
                  She s a goner, I m sure of it.  
                  Probably choked on something.  A 
                  little piece of Lego or something. 

                                RYAN
                  She s just at work.  She ll be back.

                                WILFRED
                  Are you talking down to me?

                                RYAN
                  What?  No--

                                WILFRED
                  You re talking down to me.  I open up 
                  to you, and you talk down to me.          WILFRED "Pilot"                    3/26/10             12.


    Wilfred angrily grabs a shovel and resumes digging.

                                WILFRED (CONT D)
                  You have any idea what it s like to 
                  feel abandoned?  To lose the one 
                  thing in life that makes you happy?  

    PUSH IN on Ryan as he starts putting it all together.

                                RYAN
                  Yeah, I do.  God, I haven t thought 
                  about this in years, but when I was a 
                  kid, I had this cute little dog.  
                  Sparky.  I loved him so much and--

    Wilfred stops digging.

                                WILFRED
                  You know Buck?

                                RYAN
                  Who?

                                WILFRED
                  Buck.  Black lab, about my age, great 
                  teeth.  You know him?

                                RYAN
                  I don t know Buck.

                                WILFRED
                  And you won t, because he s gone.  
                  One day he s running around by the 
                  tennis courts at the park, the next 
                  day, bam!

                                RYAN
                  Hit by a car?

                                WILFRED
                  No, we just kind of lost touch.  

                                RYAN
                  Bam, you just kind of lost touch?  

                                WILFRED
                  Life is short, Ryan.  You gotta start 
                  listening to your heart before the 
                  worms inside it grow so big it 
                  explodes.  Like poor old Shasta.

                                RYAN
                  He had heartworm?

                                WILFRED
                  She... was hit by a car.  Pay 
                  attention. (THEN) Ryan, I know your 
                  type.  
                                (MORE)        WILFRED "Pilot"                    3/26/10             13.

                                WILFRED (CONT'D)
                  You re a good boy and you come when 
                  you re called and you don t drag your 
                  ass on the carpet.  Aren t you tired 
                  of doing what everyone else wants you 
                  to do?  Maybe it s time you found the 
                  courage to quit playing ball with 
                  them...

    He holds up an old tennis ball.  Where did that come from? 

                                WILFRED (CONT D)
                  ...and just play ball with me.

                                RYAN
                  (SUSPICIOUS) I don t think so.

                                WILFRED
                  Go on.  Give it a toss. 

                                RYAN
                  Something doesn t feel right.

                                WILFRED
                  What s the matter, you throw like a 
                  girl?  No judgments, just throw the--

                                RYAN
                  (FIRMLY) No.

    It s a standoff, as if playing ball has become a test of 
    wills.  Which, of course, it has.  Wilfred backs off.

                RYAN (CONT D)WILFRED
    I have to go to work--Let s take a walk.

                                RYAN (CONT D)
                  I don t have time for a walk.

                                WILFRED
                  Ryan, you re already upset about your 
                  lawn, right?  Well, I ve got enough 
                  piss in me to kill what s left of it. 

    EXT. STREET - LATER 

      A cigarette dangles from Wilfred s lips as they walk.  Ryan 
    watches the reactions of passersby, but no one bats an eye at 
    Wilfred.  They stop at a tree.  Ryan is impatient.

                                RYAN
                  (RE: TREE) This one?

    Wilfred considers it, then shrugs and ambles on.  (During the 
    following, a pretty girl passes by and pets Wilfred.  He 
    glances after her, appreciative.)

                                RYAN (CONT D)
                  Tell me about Jenna.          WILFRED "Pilot"                    3/26/10             14.


                                WILFRED
                  Why? 

                                RYAN
                  I d like to get to know her.

                                WILFRED
                  Sorry mate, you re not her type.

                                RYAN
                  Why not?

                                WILFRED
                  Well, for one thing, she s not into 
                  guys with ginormous heads.

    Ryan touches his head, self-conscious.  

                                WILFRED (CONT D)
                  Not sure how your neck puts up with 
                  it, but I know Jenna wouldn t be 
                  interested.  Maybe you can find a lady 
                  scientist looking to study 
                  gravitational forces or something.

                                RYAN
                  (DEFENSIVE) It s a little oversized.  
                  That just means I have a big brain.

                                WILFRED
                  Or a small brain with a thick crust.  
                  Either way, Jenna s out of your league.

                                RYAN
                  How can you say that?  You don t know 
                  anything about me. 

                                WILFRED
                  I know what you did last night.  

    Ryan stops short, surprised by Wilfred s directness.

                                WILFRED (CONT D)
                  I know you think there s no hope.  I 
                  know you re a failure.  I know you 
                  wasted your past as you strove to 
                  meet the expectations of others while 
                  allowing your own dreams to wither 
                  and die, and worse, to be forgotten.  

                                RYAN
                  (UNNERVED) How... how do you--?

    Wilfred is suddenly in Ryan s face.

                                WILFRED
                  Because I am you.  We are one mind.        WILFRED "Pilot"                    3/26/10             15.


    Ryan is freaked.  Wilfred breaks into a smile.

                                WILFRED (CONT D)
                  Just fucking with you.  I read your  
                  little snuff letter while you were 
                  passed out.  Found it a bit wordy, 
                  actually.  It could use another pass. 
                  (CHUCKLES)  Strove.   Really?

                                RYAN
                  (SIGHS, FRUSTRATED) There s gotta be 
                  more to life than this. 

    Wilfred finally finds a tree good enough to pee on.  He 
    relieves himself while they talk.

                                WILFRED
                  C mon now, is it that bad, mate?

                                RYAN
                  Well, let s see.  I graduated from a 
                  very expensive law school and went 
                  straight to work for my father.  Then 
                  I made a rookie mistake.  I told the 
                  truth.  Dad s firm lost half its 
                  clients overnight and I was disbarred 
                  the same day my first student loan 
                  payment was due.

    Wilfred finishes up and they resume walking.  (As they walk,  
    Wilfred and a passing surfer exchange cool  wassup  nods. )

                                RYAN (CONT D)
                  Kristen s right, a job is a job.  

                                WILFRED
                  Look, Ryan, if you want my advice--

                                RYAN
                  Actually, I don t.  I ve got enough 
                  people telling me what to do.    

                                WILFRED
                  (HURT) Just trying to help.  You 
                  don t have to be a dick.

                                RYAN
                  Are you done?  I need to get to work.

    A passing MAN smiles at Wilfred.

                                MAN
                  Hey, poochy poochy.

                                WILFRED
                  Fuck off.        WILFRED "Pilot"                    3/26/10             16.


    EXT. ANOTHER STREET - A LITTLE LATER

    Ryan and Wilfred walk home.  

                                WILFRED
                  It s like me, when I m eating out the 
                  ass of a dead possum.  I m eating out 
                  his guts through his ass.  I get my 
                  teeth right in there.  No one taught 
                  me that.  I just did it one day.  It 
                  happened.  Been doing it ever since. 

                                RYAN
                  (DISGUSTED) Interesting.  Ever tried 
                  Korean?  I think you d like it.

                                WILFRED
                  You re missing the point.  I m not 
                  just saying that possum ass is 
                  delicious -- it is.  What I m saying 
                  is, I m true to my nature.  I don t 
                  over-think everything.  I act on 
                  instinct.  

                                RYAN
                  You re an animal. 

                                WILFRED
                  We re all animals, Ryan.

    Spencer ROARS past them on his motorcycle.  Wilfred chases 
    after him.

                                WILFRED (CONT D)
                  I ll kill you!

    Spencer turns down an alley, followed by Wilfred.  Alarmed, 
    Ryan runs after them.

                                RYAN
                  Wilfred!  Stay!  Come!

    EXT. ALLEY BEHIND RYAN S HOUSE

    Ryan rounds the corner and catches up to Wilfred.  Spencer 
    screeches to a halt in his carport and leaps off his bike. 

                                SPENCER
                  Where s his leash?  He s lucky I 
                  didn t kick his teeth in.

                                WILFRED
                  Try it and lose a foot!

                                RYAN
                  (TO WILFRED) No!  I mean it! 

    His forceful tone surprises Wilfred, who backs off, annoyed.        WILFRED "Pilot"                    3/26/10             17.


                                RYAN (CONT D)
                  (TO SPENCER) It won t happen again.

                                SPENCER
                  If it does, someone s getting his 
                  nuts cut off.

    Spencer exits into his yard and the gate slams shut.  

                                WILFRED
                  (TO RYAN) He means me.  You obviously 
                  don t have any.

                                RYAN
                  You re right.  I should ve challenged 
                  him to a knife fight. 

                                WILFRED
                  You let that shit-stain walk all over 
                  us.  Your father was right.  You re a 
                  pussy.

                                RYAN
                  When did he say that?

                                WILFRED
                  Okay, he didn t, I made that up.  But 
                  you are a pussy.

                                RYAN
                  I don t need to listen to this.  

                                WILFRED
                  Ryan, I m not telling you anything 
                  you don t already know.  Fear has 
                  made you a weak.  Fear is the mind 
                  killer.  Fear is the little death 
                  that brings total obliteration.

                                RYAN
                  That s from  Dune.   How do you know 
                  that?

                                WILFRED
                  How do you know that?

    They stare at each other for a beat, then Wilfred produces the 
    tennis ball.

                                WILFRED (CONT D)
                  C mon, mate.  Have a throw.  What are 
                  you afraid of?

                                RYAN
                  I m not afraid.  But that s not just 
                  a ball--        WILFRED "Pilot"                    3/26/10             18.


                                WILFRED
                  Of course it is. 

    He aggressively bounces the ball off Ryan s head.  

                                WILFRED (CONT D)
                  See?  It s a ball.

                                RYAN
                  Why are you pushing so hard--?

                                WILFRED
                  I m feeling playful! (SHOVES BALL AT 
                  HIM) No more questions!  Stop 
                  thinking and throw the damn ball!

                                RYAN
                  No!

    He slaps the ball out of Wilfred s hand.  It sails over the 
    fence and into Spencer s yard!  Wilfred is very upset.  He 
    moves in on Ryan, who backs away nervously.  

                                WILFRED
                  What did you do?!  

                                RYAN
                  I m sorry.  I didn t mean to--

                                WILFRED
                  You re a naughty boy!  

                                RYAN
                  I ll get you another ball!

                                WILFRED
                  I don t want another ball!

                                JENNA (O.S.)
                  Hey.

    Ryan turns to see Jenna, who has just entered the alley from 
    her back yard.  Ryan is glad to see her.

                                RYAN
                  Hey!  Look, Wilfred, it s Jenna!

                                JENNA
                  I hope he wasn t any trouble.

                                RYAN
                  Not at all.  He s adorable. 

                                JENNA
                  Wilfred, did you make a new friend?

    His resentful eyes are locked on Ryan.        WILFRED "Pilot"                    3/26/10             19.


                                JENNA (CONT D)
                  (TO RYAN) You wanna come in and have 
                  a glass of wine? 

    Wilfred subtly shakes his head  don t even think about it.   
    Ryan hesitates.

                                JENNA (CONT D)
                  Don t be polite, I hate polite.  
                  C mon, I insist.

    Ryan looks at Wilfred, who frowns.

    INT. JENNA S HOUSE - EVENING

    The room is full of half-emptied moving boxes.  Ryan keeps an 
    eye on Jenna in the kitchen while he and Wilfred talk. 

                                WILFRED
                  You have to go get it.

                                RYAN
                  Why don t you go get it?

                                WILFRED
                  Hard to climb a fence with no arms.

    Ryan points to Wilfred s crossed arms.

                                RYAN
                  What are those?

                                WILFRED
                  Legs.

    Jenna enters with an open wine bottle and two glasses.  Ryan 
    moves to the couch.

                                JENNA
                  I haven t unpacked my clothes, but 
                  the wine glasses are washed and 
                  ready.  What does that say about me?

                                RYAN
                  I like your priorities.  

    She laughs, charmed, and pours the wine.  Wilfred is appalled.

                                WILFRED
                  Get your filthy eyes off her priori-
                  titties.  A time of crisis and all 
                  you can think about is your lipstick?  
                  Pull it back in its case, Romeo.

    Jenna sits next to Ryan, but Wilfred quickly moves to wedge 
    himself in between them.  Jenna strokes Wilfred s back.        WILFRED "Pilot"                    3/26/10             20.


                                JENNA
                  I guess he missed me.  This move has 
                  been kinda tough on him. 

    Wilfred subtly leans back and forth, making it awkward and 
    difficult for Ryan to maintain eye contact with Jenna. 

                      RYANWILFRED
    Yeah, moving sucks.I will not be ignored, Ryan.

    Ryan tries to appear casual as he conducts two different 
    conversations at once.  (We ll always be more attuned to 
    Wilfred and Ryan.)  Jenna, of course, only hears Ryan.

                                RYAN (CONT D)
                  Especially packing, but it does help 
                  you realize that thing you think you 
                  can t live without is really just a 
                  stupid old toy you re used to having 
                  in your mouth. (COVERS) House. 

                      JENNAWILFRED
    That s true, but I didn t have (TO RYAN) Sorry mate, am I 
    time to sort through my stuff.  distracting you?  Ball.  Ball.  
    I had to hit the ground Ball.  Ball ball.  Ball ball 
    running on my new job, and now ball.  Ball-ball-ball-ball-
    I m hardly ever home. ball-ball.  Ball.

                                JENNA (CONT D)
                  Poor Wilfred must be wondering what 
                  the hell is going on. (TO WILFRED, 
                  BABY-TALK) You don t know, do you.

                                RYAN
                  I m pretty sure he understands more 
                  than you think.

                                WILFRED
                  Understand this.

    He knocks Ryan s wine glass, splashing it all over his pants.

                                JENNA
                  Wilfred! (TO RYAN) I ll get a towel.

    She hurries into the kitchen.  Ryan glares at Wilfred.

                                RYAN
                  (TO WILFRED) Why are doing this?

                                WILFRED
                  You think I m gonna let you anywhere 
                  near her?  You ll just smack her over 
                  the nearest fence.

    Jenna comes back with a towel for Ryan to clean himself up.        WILFRED "Pilot"                    3/26/10             21.


                                JENNA
                  Sorry about that.

                                RYAN
                  Hey, it was an accident. (POINTED, TO 
                  WILFRED) Accidents happen.

                                JENNA
                  Off the couch, clumsy boy.

    Wilfred realizes she s talking to him and grudgingly rises.  
    He stands nearby, frustrated.  

                                JENNA (CONT D)
                  He s always knocking into things.  One 
                  day we were at the park and he wasn t 
                  looking where he was going and he 
                  smacked face-first into a tree.  He 
                  made the cutest little yelp.  

                                RYAN
                  (TO WILFRED, IRONICALLY) Awww.

    Embarrassed, Wilfred leaves the room. 

                                JENNA
                  Thanks for watching him today.

                                RYAN
                  (RE: HIS PANTS) Thanks for the drink.

                                JENNA
                  (LAUGHS) At least it was cheap wine.

                                RYAN
                  (SINCERELY) It s the nicest wine I ve 
                  had in a long time.  Really sweet.

    They both know he s not talking about the wine.  They share a 
    smile.  Then: SQUEAK!  SQUEAK!  Wilfred runs in with a squeaky 
    toy, ruining their moment of connection.

                                JENNA
                  (LAUGHS) God, that s so annoying!  

    She takes the squeaky toy from him, then digs into a box and 
    hands him a stuffed Raggedy Andy type doll.

                                JENNA (CONT D)
                  There you go.

    She rejoins Ryan on the couch and pours him another glass of 
    wine.  Wilfred holds the doll, watching them, looking faintly 
    ridiculous and plenty annoyed.  

                                RYAN
                  So you just started a new job?          WILFRED "Pilot"                    3/26/10             22.


    Wilfred s eyes narrow.  He holds the doll so Ryan can see it.

                                JENNA
                  Yeah, I m a segment producer for the 
                  Channel 13 news. 

              JENNA (CONT D)WILFRED
    Mostly puff pieces right now, (RE: DOLL) Looks a bit like 
    but I m hoping I ll get more you, eh, Ryan?  Blue shirt.  
      substantive assignments... Comically large head.
      (CONTINUES)

    Her VOICE FADES, replaced by the faint sound of a SQUEAKY 
    TOY S HEARTBEAT ( Squeak-squeak!  Squeak-squeak! ).  Ryan 
    notices the doll does indeed look vaguely like him.  Wilfred 
    runs his paw gently over the doll. 

                                WILFRED
                  Made of pretty soft stuff.  Mind you, 
                  I m no cat, but even I could shred 
                  the shit out of this thing.  If I 
                  decided that was the way to go.

    The SQUEAKY HEARTBEAT IN Ryan s ears grows louder and faster.  
    Wilfred s tone remains calm and unnerving.  Ryan watches 
    nervously.

                                WILFRED (CONT D)
                  And these eyes.  Pretty flimsy.

    He plucks an eye off the doll.  Ryan s eye twitches.  

                                WILFRED (CONT D)
                  See, Ryan, I like to play nice.  But 
                  I don t have to.

    The SQUEAKY HEARTBEAT continues to grow louder and faster as 
    Wilfred uses his teeth to rip off the doll s arm.  Ryan 
    crosses his arms, squirming.  Wilfred uses his fingers to 
    carefully pull tufts of cotton filling from the torn doll s 
    body.

                                WILFRED (CONT D)
                  So I guess it s up to you to do the 
                  right thing, Ryan.  Look inside 
                  yourself.  Look into your heart.

    With one quick move, Wilfred plucks out the doll s tiny little 
    plastic squeaker  heart  and pops it in his mouth.  He chews 
    it a bit, then gulps it down.  Ryan s nerves shatter.

                                RYAN
                  I gotta go!

                                JENNA
                    (DISAPPOINTED) Already?        WILFRED "Pilot"                    3/26/10             23.


                                WILFRED
                  (TO RYAN) This isn t over.

                                RYAN
                  Yeah, I have a dentist appointment or 
                  something.  Thanks for having me.

    Ryan backs toward the door.  Wilfred follows.

                                WILFRED
                  I want that ball, Ryan.

                                JENNA
                  Oh.  Okay.  Say bye-bye, Wilfred.

    Wilfred moves in on Ryan, putting his hands on his shoulders.

                                WILFRED
                  Better sleep with your eyes open.

                                JENNA
                  Give Ryan a kiss.

    And as Michael Corleone did to Fredo in  Godfather II , 
    Wilfred grabs Ryan by the neck and gives him a cold kiss of 
    death.  

                                WILFRED
                  (SEETHING) You broke my heart, Ryan.  
                  You broke my heart.

    Terrified, Ryan forces a laugh for Jenna s benefit.

                                RYAN
                  O-o-kay!

    Wilfred lingers.  Ryan is sweating.

                                JENNA
                  Wilfred!  Down.

    Wilfred finally releases Ryan, who runs out of the house.

    EXT. ALLEY BEHIND RYAN S HOUSE

    Hands trembling, Ryan opens his own gate, hurries into his 
    yard, and promptly drops out of sight.

                                RYAN
                  Ahhh!

    ANGLE ON RYAN, lying flat on his back in one of the holes dug 
    by Wilfred, scared shitless.


                                  END OF ACT TWO        WILFRED "Pilot"                    3/26/10             24.


                                      ACT THREE

    BLACK SCREEN

                                WILFRED (V.O.)
                  (ECHOING) You broke my heart, Ryan.  
                  Better sleep with your eyes open.

    The RUMBLE of Spencer s motorcycle crescendos into a ROAR...

    INT. LIVING ROOM - THAT EVENING

    CLOSE ON RYAN, his eyes open, disoriented, listening to the 
    sound of Spencer s motorcycle fade into the distance.  

                                KRISTEN (O.S.)
                  Well, are you gonna answer me?

    Ryan blinks.  He seems genuinely surprised to find himself on 
    his couch, facing an annoyed Kristen.  

                                RYAN
                  (LOST) What was the question?

    Exasperated, she starts for the door.

                                KRISTEN
                  Forget it.  I don t know why I even--

                                RYAN
                  Wait!  I m having a problem.  

                                KRISTEN
                  What else is new?

                                RYAN
                  Those pills you gave me.  I kind 
                  of... abused them.  I ve taken so 
                  many I don t even feel them anymore.  

                                KRISTEN
                  Ryan!  Do you know how dangerous that 
                  is?  Abusing those drugs can lead to 
                  severe side effects.  Paranoia,  
                  depression, hallucinations-- 

    Ryan looks up sharply.  Now it all makes sense!

                                RYAN
                    Hallucinations?  

                                KRISTEN
                  And worse.  Much worse.

                                RYAN
                  (RELIEVED) Oh my god...          WILFRED "Pilot"                    3/26/10             25.


                                KRISTEN
                  And people with family histories like 
                  ours have to be especially careful.

                                RYAN
                  Of course!  

                                KRISTEN
                  Which is why I gave you sugar pills.

                                RYAN
                  (BEAT) What?

                                KRISTEN
                  I can t prescribe meds to a family 
                  member.  It s unethical.  Besides, 
                  your doctor cut you off for a reason.  
                  You were using those pills as a 
                  crutch, so when you asked me for more 
                  I gave you placebos.

                                RYAN
                  (CRUSHED) So no side effects?

                                KRISTEN
                  From sugar pills?  Tooth decay, adult-
                  onset diabetes... sugar rush? 

                                RYAN
                  (REALIZING) That s why I couldn t 
                  sleep. 

    He turns and puts his forehead against the back window, trying 
    to understand it all.  Something catches his eye.

    RYAN S POV

    In the shadows, a furry figure sits on a lawn swing, the 
    glowing tip of his cigarette visible as he inhales.

                                KRISTEN (O.S.)
                  Why are you being so self-
                  destructive?

    BACK TO SCENE

                                KRISTEN (CONT D)
                  Okay, so your law career is over--

                                RYAN
                  I don t care about that.  I never 
                  even wanted to be a lawyer.

                                KRISTEN
                  Of course you did.        WILFRED "Pilot"                    3/26/10             26.


                                RYAN
                  (SURPRISED HIMSELF) No, I didn t.  I 
                  hated every minute of it.  

                                KRISTEN
                  Well then, what do you want?

                                RYAN
                  (BEAT) Gimme a minute.

    Kristen watches, confused, as Ryan exits to the back yard.

    EXT. RYAN S BACK YARD - CONTINUOUS

    Ryan walks through the darkened yard to where Wilfred sits.

                                RYAN
                  What do you want?

                                WILFRED
                  I want my fucking ball.

                                RYAN
                  Really?  That all this is about?

                                WILFRED
                  Ryan, when I was a young  un, I had a 
                  bit of an oral fixation. (RE: 
                  CIGARETTE) Still do, I guess.  But 
                  when I was little I was a bit mouthy, 
                  and I was too dumb to know the 
                  difference between a knot of rawhide 
                  and a fine Italian loafer.  Someone 
                  would adopt me, I d have a bit of a 
                  chew, and then it was back to the 
                  pound we go.  Italian Loafer guy, he 
                  gave me a good beating.  Kicked me so 
                  hard I got hip displeasure.

                                RYAN
                  Dysplasia.

                                WILFRED
                  No, it didn t get that bad.  But I 
                  was at the end of the line, on death 
                  row.  And then a kindly old woman at 
                  the shelter gave me a tennis ball.  
                  That tennis ball.  I could chew 
                  without shame, and suddenly I was 
                  lovable.  That ball saved my life.  I 
                  need it back, and I can t get through 
                  that gate without you.

                                RYAN
                  Why not?

    Wilfred is getting impatient.  He stubs out his cigarette and 
    flicks it away with great dexterity, then holds up his paw.        WILFRED "Pilot"                    3/26/10             27.


                                WILFRED
                  (RE: PAW) I can t undo the latch, 
                  mate.  Think about it.

                                RYAN
                  Alright, here s the deal.  I ll help 
                  you, and then you stay away from me.  
                  Forever.

                                WILFRED
                  If that s what you want.

                                RYAN
                  Shake on it.

    He extends his hand.  Wilfred just looks at it.

                                WILFRED
                  Yeah, I never learned that trick, but 
                  you have my word.

    EXT. ALLEY BEHIND RYAN S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

    Wilfred watches Ryan try to open Spencer s gate.  It s locked.  

                                WILFRED
                  Use a credit card, genius.

    Ryan uses a card from his wallet.  The latch opens.  They 
    enter into:

    EXT. SPENCER S YARD - MOMENTS LATER

    Ryan searches the unkempt yard, calling in a hushed whisper.

                                RYAN
                  I found it!

    SMASH!  Ryan looks over to see Wilfred standing by a broken 
    window next to the back door.  

                                RYAN (CONT D)
                  What are you doing!?

                                WILFRED
                  (TAPS HIS MUZZLE) The nose knows.

    He reaches in, unlocks the door and enters.  Ryan follows.

    INT. SPENCER S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

    Wilfred moves briskly through the dark house.  Ryan tries to 
    keep up, tripping over a coffee table and breaking an ashtray.

                                RYAN
                  This was not our deal!        WILFRED "Pilot"                    3/26/10             28.


                                WILFRED
                  Well, I didn t shake on it, did I.

    Wilfred stops in front of a closet.  Light shines from behind 
    the closed door.  

                                WILFRED (CONT D)
                  Here we go.

    He opens the closet door, revealing two giant marijuana plants 
    under a grow light.

                                WILFRED (CONT D)
                  Heaven.  Good for the hips.

    He takes one plant and hands the other to Ryan.  Ryan follows 
    him toward the exit, pissed.

                                RYAN
                  This was your plan the whole time.

                                WILFRED
                  Part of it.  This is the other part.

    Wilfred puts the plant down next to a pair of Spencer s 
    motorcycle boots.  He squats over one of the boots, preparing 
    to do his business.

                                RYAN
                  In his boot?

                                WILFRED
                  They never check them first, do they.

    Ryan can t help but smile.

                                RYAN
                  What the hell.  He deserves it.  Now 
                  c mon, let s go.

                                WILFRED
                  Not so fast.  He has another boot.

                                RYAN
                  (BEAT) You want me to...  No way.

                                WILFRED
                  Why not?  He ll never know it was you.  

                                RYAN
                  That s not the point.

    Ryan is conflicted.  Wilfred moves in for the kill.

                                WILFRED
                  You said it yourself, he deserves 
                  this.  The fucking bike. 
                                (MORE)        WILFRED "Pilot"                    3/26/10             29.

                                WILFRED (CONT'D)
                  The trash in the alley, the way he 
                  treats you like an insignificant, 
                  limp-dicked wanker.  How does that 
                  make you feel?

                                RYAN
                  (FEELING IT) Angry.

                                WILFRED
                  Yeah?  Well, it s time to return the 
                  favor.  You know you want to.

                                RYAN
                  I m not an animal.

                                WILFRED
                  Then be a man!  For once in your 
                  life, be a man and shit in that boot!

    Ryan is persuaded.

    EXT. SPENCER S YARD - MOMENTS LATER

    Wilfred and an elated Ryan carry the pot plants to the gate.  

                                RYAN
                  I can t believe I did that!  That was 
                  so awesome!

                                WILFRED
                  Well done, Ryan.  Primo coiler.  One 
                  of the best I ve seen.

    A distant but familiar RUMBLE is coming closer.  Spencer s 
      motorcycle.  

                                RYAN
                  Shit!

    They run to the gate.  Ryan tries to open it.

                                RYAN (CONT D)
                  It s jammed!

    Wilfred grabs the pot plants and tosses them over the fence.

    EXT. ALLEY BEHIND RYAN S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

      A headlight appears at the end of the alley!   Ryan and 
    Wilfred scramble over the fence, grab the plants and dash into 
    Ryan s yard just as Spencer pulls into his carport.

    INT. RYAN S BACK YARD - CONTINUOUS

    Ryan and Wilfred lay on the ground, breathless, listening as 
    Spencer spots their break-in.        WILFRED "Pilot"                    3/26/10             30.


                                SPENCER (O.S.)
                  Goddam it!

    Ryan giggles.  He s happier than we ve ever seen him.  Wilfred 
    smiles, pleased.

                                WILFRED
                  Hey Ryan, when s the last time you 
                  felt this good?

                                RYAN
                  (A REVELATION) Never.  

                                WILFRED
                  It s called  living,  mate.  You can 
                  feel this way forever.  Trust your 
                  instincts.  No more doubt.  No fear.  

    Wilfred produces the ball.  

                                WILFRED (CONT D)
                  Just throw it away.

    Ryan gets it now.  He takes the ball and chucks it across the 
    yard.  Wilfred smiles.

                                WILFRED (CONT D)
                  Good boy.  Welcome to your new life.  

                                RYAN
                  Aren t you gonna fetch it?

                                WILFRED
                  Do you know how many balls I have?

    The porch light snaps on.  Kristen is at the back door with 
    her cell phone.

                                KRISTEN
                  What are you doing out here?  

                                RYAN
                  This is my friend, Wilfred.  

                                KRISTEN
                  He looks filthy. (RE: PHONE) I called 
                  Dr. Ramos.  He s willing to talk to 
                  you. (WHISPERS) Beg!

    She hands Ryan the phone.  He glances at Wilfred, then:

                                RYAN
                  (INTO PHONE) Hey Doc, it s Ryan.  I 
                  appreciate the offer, but I d rather 
                  eat possum ass than be your desk 
                  monkey. 

    Kristen grabs the phone.        WILFRED "Pilot"                    3/26/10             31.


                                KRISTEN
                  Dr. Ramos?  Hello? (TO RYAN) Well 
                  that s just great!  Do you have any 
                  idea how tough this job market is?  
                  Beggars can t be choosers.

                                RYAN
                  I m not a beggar.

                                KRISTEN
                  Are you kidding?  You re the job 
                  candidate equivalent of a one-legged, 
                  milky-eyed Mumbai orphan with a tin 
                  cup full of pencils! 

                                WILFRED
                  (SOTTO) What a bitch.

                                KRISTEN
                  I mean, what am I supposed to think?

                                RYAN
                  Whatever you want.  But from now on, 
                  keep it to yourself.  I don t give a 
                  shit.

                                WILFRED
                  Well, actually you do.  Or you did.

    Ryan laughs.

                                KRISTEN
                  Oh, is this funny?  Fine.  Goodbye, 
                  Ryan.  You re on your own. 

    She exits into the house.  

                                RYAN
                  Wrong!  I m not alone!  I ve got 
                  Wilfred!

    He puts his arm around Wilfred, whom he notices is nibbling on 
    something, corn-on-the-cob style.

                                RYAN (CONT D)
                  What is that?

                                WILFRED
                  Bit of squirrel.

                                RYAN
                  (RECOILING) Oh, gross!  No!  Drop it!  
                  Drop it!

    INT. LIVING ROOM - LATE THAT NIGHT

    Wilfred and Ryan sit drinking beers.  The air is smoky.        WILFRED "Pilot"                    3/26/10             32.


                                WILFRED
                  I pride myself on having an answer 
                  for everything.  You ask me any 
                  question.

                                RYAN
                  Alright.  Um... What s the  domino 
                  effect ?

                                WILFRED
                  Don t know.  Next.

    INT. SAME - LATER

                                WILFRED
                  Why are you defending her?  I mean, I 
                  told you how she treated me, and now 
                  you re taking her side?

                                RYAN
                  Look, I m not saying what she did was 
                  right.  I just think it s possible 
                  that she was in heat.

                                WILFRED
                  (BEAT) She was a slut.

    INT. SAME - LATER

    Wilfred is taking a very long hit off the bong.

                                RYAN
                  I just got to the point where I lost 
                  hope.  And I think at times like that, 
                  if you re lucky, you meet someone who 
                  gives you a reason to go on.  And I 
                  think that someone could be Jenna.  

    He looks to Wilfred for validation, but Wilfred is still 
    inhaling.  This is the longest bong hit in history.  Ryan 
    waits.  And waits.  Finally he looks away.  Wilfred continues 
    hitting the bong.

    INT. SAME - LATER

    Ryan is starting to drift off.

                                RYAN
                  Hey Wilfred.  How s this gonna end?

                                WILFRED
                  Hmm?

                                RYAN
                  This.  Us.  What s gonna happen?

                                WILFRED
                  Don t know.  Next.        WILFRED "Pilot"                    3/26/10             33.


                                RYAN
                  Well, anyway... It s nice to have 
                  someone looking out for me.

    Wilfred smiles and toasts Ryan with his beer.  Ryan closes his 
    eyes, contented.  

    EXT. SPENCER S YARD - NIGHT

    CLOSE ON A FURRY PAW as it carefully places Ryan s wallet 
    under the broken window at Spencer s house.  Ryan s ID is 
    clearly visible.
