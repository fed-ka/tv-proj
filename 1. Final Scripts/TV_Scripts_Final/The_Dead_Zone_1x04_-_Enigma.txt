  11INT. RESTAURANT - CLEAVES MILLS - NIGHT

          Johnny and CHANDRA are at a table in one of the town's
          "nice" restaurants.  This is a first date and the awkward
          silences are frequent.  They have just finished ordering
          and the WAITER takes the menus.

                                        WAITER
                                (to Chandra)
                        Thank you.
                                (nods to Johnny)
                        Mister Smith.

          The waiter leaves.  Chandra is surprised -- but also
          relieved to have a conversational opening.

                                        CHANDRA
                        They know you here?  But Sarah
                        said you don't go out... much, I
                        mean.

          The awkward silence descends once more.  Then:

                                        JOHNNY
                        What else did Sarah say about me?

                                        CHANDRA
                                (lying; lightly)
                          Nothing.

    1CONTINUED:1

          The Waiter returns with two small glasses of wine.

                                        WAITER
                          Aperitif... Compliments of the
                        Gentleman.

          He indicates a man dining with two other people at a
          distant table, and discreetly leaves a business card on
          the table.  The man across the restaurant gives a "cheers"
          sign to Johnny with his own glass.  Johnny responds with
          a somewhat forced smile. 

          More silence.  Chandra indicates the business card.

                                        CHANDRA
                        Well?

          Johnny hesitates.  Chandra picks up the card.

                                        CHANDRA
                                (reading)
                        "I am an admirer of your talent,
                        and have a business proposition
                        that may interest you.  Please
                        call at your earliest convenience."

          She tosses the card down in front of him.  Johnny picks
          it up -- and is suddenly in a vision.


  22INT. JOHNNY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT - VISION

          Johnny, in bathrobe, is checking messages on his answering
          machine.

                                        BUSINESSMAN'S VOICE
                        This is Harold MacVane, I sent
                        over the wine... at the restaurant. 
                        Just a follow-up to see if you--

          Johnny hits fast forward.


  33RESUME - RESTAURANT

          Johnny drops the card onto the table.

                                        CHANDRA
                        Are you going to call?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm going to change my number.

          Chandra tries to get a little banter going.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: ENIGMA - TEASER - REV. 4/11/02 - YELLOW  4.


  3CONTINUED: (2)3

                                        CHANDRA
                                (kidding)
                        I'm a palm reader, by the way.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (lightly)
                        Really?

                                        CHANDRA
                              (a demand)
                        Let's see.

          Before Johnny can pull his hand out of harm's way, she
          reaches out and takes it.  He suddenly hears Chandra's
          voice from a nearby table:

                                        CHANDRA (O.S.)
                                (upset)
                        Kind of ironic, isn't it?

          Johnny turns toward the sound, sees himself and Chandra
          at another table, wearing different clothes, leaning close
          toward each other, in intimate, difficult conversation,
          hand in hand.


  44ANGLE - JOHNNY AND CHANDRA - ANOTHER NIGHT

          There are tears in Chandra's eyes.

                                        CHANDRA
                        It's still Sarah.

                                        JOHNNY
                        She has nothing to do with us.

                                        CHANDRA
                          Everything.  Everything to do
                        with us.

          Chandra indicates the table.

                                        CHANDRA
                        She might as well be sitting here
                        right now.

    4CONTINUED:4

          Chandra tries to stop herself from crying, stares down at
          the plate in front of her.

                                        CHANDRA
                        Why do I always have this?  I
                        hate their Caesar.

          She pulls her hand away from his, and at that moment--


  55RESUME - RESTAURANT

          --Johnny suddenly takes his hand away from Chandra's,
          disturbed. 

                                        CHANDRA
                        What's wrong?

          The Waiter arrives, sets down their respective plates. 
          He leaves.  Chandra stares at Johnny.

                                        CHANDRA
                        Did you see something?

          Johnny regains his composure.  Forces a smile.  He
            indicates her plate.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You're going to wish you never
                        ordered that salad.

          Chandra smiles with relief.  But any rapport they might
          have achieved over the last few minutes has utterly
            disappeared.  They pick up their silverware and continue
          the meal in silence...          THE DEAD ZONE: ENIGMA - TEASER - REV. 4/10/02 - BLUE   6.


  66EXT. JOHNNY'S BACKYARD - NEXT DAY

          Johnny in workout clothes is surveying a half-dozen large
          plants in huge pots.  He's got a pair of gardening shears
          in one hand, but doesn't really know what he's doing.  He
          inexpertly clips off a browned and unhealthy looking leaf,
          then keeps moves to the next plant.  SARAH appears from
          around the side of the house, having just arrived.

                                        SARAH
                        Hey.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey.

          She moves up next to him as he clips another few leaves.

                                        SARAH
                                (re: his big date)
                        So?

                                        JOHNNY
                                (feigns ignorance)
                        "So?"

                                        SARAH
                                (insinuating)
                        So...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (mock lascivious)
                        So.

                                        SARAH
                                (amazed)
                        No.

                                        JOHNNY
                                  (admitting)
                        No.

          Sarah suddenly turns to leave -- as if that's all she
          wanted to know.

                                        SARAH
                        See ya!

                                        JOHNNY
                        Where are you going?

          Sarah mock scowls and turns back to him.

                                        SARAH
                        Did you like her or not?

                        What's not to like?

                                        SARAH
                        Are you going to call her again?

                          I hadn't planned on it.

          Sarah is taken aback.

                                        SARAH
                        Why not?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Because I can pull back the veils
                        of space and time, remember?

                                        SARAH
                                  (realizing)
                        You saw the future.

                                        JOHNNY
                        And it wasn't pretty.

          Sarah is peeved.

                                        SARAH
                        You mean she wasn't pretty?  You
                        saw her old and gray and past her
                        prime and you panicked--

                                        JOHNNY
                          --Finished? 
                                (beat)
                        Thanks.

          Sarah reconsiders.

                                        SARAH
                        All relationships hit speed bumps. 
                        Maybe you just had a vision of a
                        speed bump.

                                        JOHNNY
                        No.  It was a brick wall.

                        Then jump over.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Why are you so eager to pair me
                        off?

                        So I don't have to think of you
                        as "available" anymore.

          Johnny is taken aback.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Oh.  Is that how you think of me
                        now?

                                        SARAH
                        Yeah.

          The moment between them is suddenly interrupted by the
          arrival of BRUCE and ARTHUR -- who is in his seventies,
          with white-hair and old-style, wire-rimmed glasses.  Both
          wear workout clothes.

                                        BRUCE
                        Hi, Sarah.
                                (to Johnny)
                        How'd it go last night?

          Johnny and Sarah both shoot him a "don't ask" look.

                                        BRUCE
                        What a surprise.
                                (re: Arthur)
                        Johnny Smith, this is Arthur Allen,
                        your new gym partner.

          Johnny raises an eyebrow -- what is Bruce up to?


  77EXT. JOHNNY'S BACKYARD - DAY - LATER

          Johnny and Arthur are doing slow, methodical "walking
          lunges" as Bruce follows along side.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I can't help you.

                                        BRUCE
                        Just like I tried to tell--

                                        ARTHUR
                        Why not?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sir...

                                        ARTHUR
                          --Arthur.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Arthur.  It doesn't sound like
                        you saw a real person.  You
                          might've had a kind of waking
                        dream or a memory or something--

          Arthur stops lunging and Johnny follows suit.

                                        ARTHUR
                        --I'm not crazy.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The mind plays tricks.

          Bruce is eager to dissuade Arthur from his obsession.

                                        BRUCE
                        Listen to the man.  Man's got the
                          trickiest mind ever.  He knows.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Right.

                                        BRUCE
                                (to Arthur)
                        It's not possible to see a woman
                        who disappeared on you fifty-five
                        years ago--

                                        ARTHUR
                                  (insistent, to Johnny)
                          --Midtown Manhattan, getting into
                        a cab.  She hadn't aged a day--

                                        BRUCE
                          --Plastic surgery couldn't even
                        do that.  Maybe voodoo--

                                        ARTHUR
                                (re: Johnny)
                        --The papers say he can find

                        The papers say that because there's
                        nothing else to talk about in
                        this town.

                                        ARTHUR
                        I like it here.

                                        BRUCE
                        So do I.  But there's not a lot
                        happening.

                                        ARTHUR
                        You just don't know where to go.

          Johnny is suddenly exasperated.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Arthur, maybe you can show Bruce
                        exactly where to go.

          He heads off toward the house.  Bruce catches up.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (sotto)
                        Since when do I have a "your
                        fortune told here" sign on my
                        porch?

                                        BRUCE
                                (sotto)
                        He insisted.  And I thought maybe
                        you could find a way to put his
                        mind at ease.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Did I put his mind at ease?

                                        BRUCE
                        Not really.

                        Really.  He's looking for the
                        lost love of his life?

                                        JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                        He isn't going to find it in some
                        fantasy about the past.

          Johnny suddenly catches himself -- that description could
          just as well fit him, and Bruce knows it.  Johnny glances
          back at Arthur, standing forlornly on the grass.  Johnny
          sighs and moves back to him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Listen, Arthur.  I'm sorry I
                          couldn't do anything for you.

                                        ARTHUR
                                  (disappointed)
                        Don't worry about it.

          Arthur puts a hand on Johnny's shoulder, which sends Johnny
          into a vision.


  7A7AEXT. STREET CLOCK - NEW YORK - DAY - VISION

          Johnny is in the SLOW MOTION scene, watching as elderly
          Arthur, standing beneath a street clock in the middle of
          a Manhattan street, a paper cup of coffee in his hand,
          stares in surprise toward a taxicab.  Getting into the
          taxi, her face only partly glimpsed, is a stunningly lovely
          young woman.  The taxi door closes, taking her from view;
          the coffee cup falls from Arthur's hands, and hits the
          street.  Johnny stares at the look of absolute shock on
          his face.  Then he looks once again at the tantalizing
          profile of the young woman as the cab pulls away.  The
          vision ends.


  7B7BEXT. JOHNNY'S BACKYARD - DAY - RESUME

          Johnny's hand falls away from Arthur's shoulder.  He stares
          at the old man, reacting to the intensity of emotions in
          the vision he just saw.  And the mystery of the young
          woman.

                                                                              FADE OUT:

  8A8ACLOSE ON A FADED PHOTO

          of a beautiful young woman circa 1945.  The resemblance
          to the face of the girl glimpsed by Johnny in his previous
          vision is unmistakable.

                                        JOHNNY (O.S.)
                        Is this her?

          REVEAL we are:


  99INT. JOHNNY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Arthur is now dressed in his "nice" clothes -- jacket and
          tie -- and has brought Johnny an old shoe box full of
            mementoes now placed onto the coffee table.  He's made an
          effort to look as dignified as possible and has succeeded --
          there's a poignancy about his presence. 

                                        ARTHUR
                                (nods)
                        Abigail Travers.

                                        JOHNNY
                        When was this taken?

                                        ARTHUR
                          Nineteen forty-five.

          Johnny stares again at the photo -- she was definitely a
            beautiful woman.

          Johnny sets it aside, picks up a Bronze Star medal -- THE
          ROOM FREEZES AROUND HIM AND HE TURNS AT THE SOUND OF
          HEAVILY FRITZED MORSE CODE:           THE DEAD ZONE: ENIGMA - ACT ONE - REV. 4/10/02 - BLUE  13.


  1010ANGLE - ARTHUR AS WORLD WAR II RADIO OPERATOR

          In the corner of Johnny's living room, 20 years old, wire-
          rimmed glasses similar to those worn by Arthur even now,
          hunched over a tiny table, writing furiously with pencil
          on paper as the heavily fritzed SOUND of MORSE code, dit-
            daw-daw-dit... is heard over and over.  His glasses have
          been cracked, and the SOUND of nearby mortar shelling can
          be heard.  This is a life or death situation.

                        Yes!

          Johnny sets down the medal.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (re: medal)
                        Guess you were good at it. 

                                        ARTHUR
                        I was good at brain teasers. 
                        Pulling a signal out of
                          interference was just another
                        puzzle to solve.  No trouble at
                        all. 

          Johnny indicates the photo of Abby.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Not this one though.

          Arthur shakes his head.  Johnny picks up an old letter.

                                        JOHNNY
                        From her?

                                        ARTHUR
                        I wish.  That's one of mine. 
                        Came back "Return to Sender."  I
                        got overseas and she never wrote
                        to me.  Not even a postcard.

          Johnny puts the letter down, and looks again through the
          objects, picking up a silver cigarette lighter.  He flicks
          the mechanism.  And is in a vision.

          combination of soup kitchen and big band club, circa 1945. 
          He wears the uniform of an American Air Force pilot and
          we'll know him as "Johnny/Tommy" -- since it is through
          Tommy's eyes that Johnny is seeing and experiencing this
          lost era.  At the moment, he is waving the flame from the
          silver lighter near the cigarette dangling from his lips,
          missing it, his attention riveted by what he has just
          spotted across the floor. 

                                        JOHNNY/TOMMY
                        Man o man.  A dolly just walked
                        in to beat the band...

                                        ARTIE (O.S.)
                        You don't say...?

                                                                    WIDEN TO INCLUDE:

          The young Arthur -- ARTIE -- as he appeared as the radio
            operator: twenty years old, wearing the uniform of an
          American private and the same type of wire rim glasses he
          will wear as an elderly man.  Artie is sitting at the
          table next to Johnny/Tommy, his head down, working
          diligently with a pencil to solve a newspaper puzzle called
          "The Daily Enigma."  He doesn't even look up, but has a
          small, knowing smile on his face.

                                        JOHNNY/TOMMY
                        Artie.  She's coming over here.

          Artie still doesn't look up, his smile grows, he suppresses
          a laugh.

                                        ARTIE
                        You don't say...?

            Johnny/Tommy gives up on the cigarette, slapping the
          lighter down on the table.  Artie pockets the lighter and
          glances up in time to see the arrival of a lovely young
          woman wearing the striped apron of the hostess/waitresses
          who work here.  We recognize her immediately from the
          elderly Arthur's photo.

                                        ARTIE
                        Abby Travers, this is my pal Tommy
                          Peterson.

          Abby puts out her hand, Johnny/Tommy, recovering, shakes
          it.  And as she sits down, he turns to Artie, who is
          already absorbed again in solving the newspaper puzzle.

                        Maybe I shoulda spent the last
                        ten years with my head buried in
                        the brain teaser.

                                        ARTIE
                                (not looking up)
                        I can see more from down here
                        than you'd think.

                                        ABBY
                                (lightly)
                        You boys talking about me?

                                        JOHNNY/TOMMY
                        That's all he talks about.

          Abby is touched.

                                        ABBY
                        Really?

                                        JOHNNY/TOMMY
                        Absotively and posilutely.

          Abby laughs.

                                        ABBY
                        And I thought he talked about you
                        all the time.

          Now it's his turn to be touched.

                                        JOHNNY/TOMMY
                        Really?

                                        ABBY
                        Absotively and posilutely.

          They both glance at Artie with affection -- he doesn't
          seem to notice.

                                        ABBY
                        First time here, Tommy?

                                        JOHNNY/TOMMY
                        How can you tell?

                                        ABBY
                        Your eyes are big as saucers.

                        That's because he saw you coming
                        across the floor.

          Abby blushes.  Suddenly:

                                        ROSIE (O.S.)
                        Yoo Hoo!

                                        ARTIE

                        The one-two punch.

          A high wind hits their table in the person of ROSIE, early
          20s, bright red hair, pretty but overbearing, wearing the
          same striped hostess apron as Abby.  On impact, she sticks
          out her hand to Tommy.

                                        ROSIE
                        You must be Tommy.  I'm Rosie
                          O'Halloran.  Great uniform.

          Tommy shoots Artie a look, then shakes her hand.  As she
          sits down--

                                        ROSIE
                        Gotta girl, Tommy?

                                        ARTIE
                        You know he doesn't.

                                        ROSIE
                        I wanna hear it from the horse's
                        mouth.

          Tommy smiles at Abby.

                                        TOMMY
                                (re: himself)
                        This horse hasn't been ridden in
                        months.

          Rosie lets out a squealing laugh, Abby blushes
            terrifically.  The Swing Band comes back from their break
          and kicks in with an uptempo number.

                                        ROSIE
                        Come on gang, let's jump!

                                        ARTIE
                                (working puzzle)
                        You know I don't dance.

          Rosie turns to him with a cool look--

                                        ROSIE
                          I wasn't talking to you, drip --

          --But when she turns back, she's lost her chance:
            Johnny/Tommy is already pulling Abby by the hand toward
          the small dance floor.  Abby shoots a "should I be doing
          this?" look toward Artie, but the latter just beams at
          her -- he trusts both of them completely.  Artie goes
          back to his puzzle and Rosie steams, shouting after as
          they go, hoping at least to add a note of discomfort:

                                        ROSIE
                                (shouting, false cheer)
                          Remember!  Mum's the word!

          Abby looks momentarily concerned, but Johnny/Tommy pulls
          her into an energetic swing dance, and she instantly
          forgets herself in the moment.  The vision ends.


  1313INT. JOHNNY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

          Johnny snaps out of it, his eyes just a little dazed,
          dropping the lighter to the table.  He's instantly on his
          feet, energized into motion by the vision.

                                        JOHNNY

                        I have to admit, I still had my
                          doubts--

                                        JOHNNY
                          --"Mum's the word."

                        What?

                                        JOHNNY
                        You had just introduced everybody. 
                        And Rosie said that to Tommy:
                        "Mum's the word."

          Arthur considers this.  Then it dawns on him.

                                        ARTHUR
                        Abby and I were supposed to be a
                        secret. 
                                (explains)
                        The Stage Door was a charity
                        operation.  For us soldiers.  The
                        girls were volunteers.

                                        JOHNNY
                        They couldn't go off to fight,
                        but they could help morale.

                                        ARTHUR
                                (nods)
                        With conversation, a little
                          dancing.  It was nice.  The girls
                        liked it too.  Sometimes Broadway
                        people volunteered -- big stars
                        even.  Some of the girls were
                        hoping to get discovered.  Not
                        Abby.  She just wanted a family. 
                        With me.

          Arthur is suddenly lost in thought.  Johnny has to prompt.

                                        JOHNNY
                        "Mum's the word...?"  

                                        ARTHUR
                        Right.  If a girl was caught dating
                          a soldier outside the Canteen she
                        got banned.  Worst thing that
                        could happen.  So Abby and I had
                        to keep it quiet.

                                        JOHNNY
                        But Rosie knew.

                        she and Abby were friends, so it
                        makes sense.

          Arthur thinks for a moment, genuinely puzzled, even
          concerned.

                                        ARTHUR

                          Honestly, I don't know what I
                        saw.
                                (gently)
                        You were standing under the big

                                (nodding)
                        Where we always used to meet.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I think that place reminded you
                        of Abby... and your mind did the
                        rest.

          Arthur thinks for a moment.

                                        ARTHUR
                        Go there yourself.

                                        JOHNNY
                        A trip to New York isn't on my

                        That's not the point.  I have a
                        life.

          A beat.  In the sudden silence a mantel clock can be heard
          ticking loudly... tick tock tick tock...

          Johnny sighs -- the new tactic just might be working.


  1414INT. JOHNNY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT - LATER

          Johnny, now wearing his pajamas and bathrobe, is listening
          to his saved messages on the answering machine.

                                        BUSINESSMAN'S VOICE
                        This is Harold MacVane, I sent
                        over the wine... at the restaurant. 
                        Just a follow-up to see if you--

          It's the exact moment seen in his restaurant vision. 
          Johnny SKIPS to the next message.

                                        TEEN'S VOICE
                        Johnny Smith?  Um...
                                (other voices laughing)
                        Um...
                                (more laughter)
                        Shut up!

          Johnny SKIPS to the next message.




                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: ENIGMA - ACT ONE - REV. 4/11/02 - PINK  21.

                                        CHANDRA'S VOICE
                        Hi, Johnny... it's Chandra.  I
                        had fun last night.  How about my
                        treat next time?  Give me a call.

          Johnny pauses the machine.  Then plays it again.

                                        CHANDRA'S VOICE
                        Hi, Johnny... it's Chandra.  I

                        treat next time?  Give me a call.

          Then he stops the machine.  His expression is ambivalent.


  1515INT. JOHNNY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT - LATER

          The oven timer SOUNDS.  Johnny, still in pajamas and robe,
          pulls a midnight snack out of the oven -- frozen macaroni
          and cheese -- burning his hand.


  1616INT. JOHNNY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - LATER

          Johnny, pajamas and robe, is watching an old game show on
          television -- we hear the sound of it offscreen.  The
          crusted remains of the macaroni are on the coffee table
          in front of him.  Johnny glances over at the couch --


          INCLUDE ARTHUR

          Asleep on the cushions -- Johnny has tossed a blanket
          over him for warmth.  He just didn't have the heart to
          turn the fellow into the night.

          Johnny pulls the shoe box over, idly searches through the
          mementoes, then picks up the lighter.  He is in a vision.


  1717INT. STAGE DOOR CANTEEN - NEW YORK 1945 - NIGHT - VISION

          The same night Johnny saw (through Tommy's eyes) in his
          previous vision.  Johnny/Tommy is on the dance floor with
          Abby, the energetic song ends, a slow one begins, and
          before Abby can head back to the table, Johnny/Tommy
          artfully takes her waist and hand and they continue the
          next dance, maintaining a proper distance between them. 
          As they circle around, they both see Artie at the distant
          table, absorbed in his puzzle; Rosie is off chatting with
          another couple of soldiers.





                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: ENIGMA - ACT ONE - REV. 4/10/02 - BLUE  22.

                                        JOHNNY/TOMMY
                        If you don't mind me asking, what's
                        a girl like you...

                                        ABBY
                                (curt)
                          ...Doing with a fella like Artie? 
                        You oughta be ashamed.  Your best
                        pal--

                                        JOHNNY/TOMMY
                        --Doing in a place like this.

          Whoops.  Abby's defensive answer has revealed a bit too
          much.  Flustered, she quickly recovers.

                                        ABBY
                        Why not?

                                        JOHNNY/TOMMY
                          I thought the gals in here were
                        all actresses on the make.  Looking
                        to be on Broadway.

                                        ABBY
                        Some of us just like showing our
                        support for the troops.

                                        JOHNNY/TOMMY
                                (testing her)
                        Say, isn't that Errol Flynn?

          Abby instantly whips her head around to look -- it's not.

                                        JOHNNY/TOMMY
                                (lightly)
                        My mistake.

          Abby frowns at him, but playfully.  He smiles.

                                        JOHNNY/TOMMY
                        Back to Artie.

          Abby smiles too -- disarmed. 

                                        ABBY
                        He's the smartest boy I've ever
                        met.

                                        JOHNNY/TOMMY
                        No argument here.

                        Good Lord willing.

                                        JOHNNY/TOMMY
                        I hope you get your wish.

          His hand slides up to the middle of her back -- the motion
          sends a chill up her spine.

                                        JOHNNY/TOMMY
                        But you're only young once.

          She suddenly pulls away from him.

                                        ABBY
                        We'd better stop.

          But they both know they will never "stop" -- until it's
          too late.  The vision ends.


  1818INT. JOHNNY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

          Johnny is taken aback by what he has just witnessed first-
          hand.  He glances over at Arthur, sleeping peacefully --
          as oblivious now as he seemed to be half a century ago. 
          OFF Johnny's troubled expression.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

          FADE IN:

  1919EXT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE - FRONT WALK - DAY

          Johnny, small travel bag over his shoulder, is walking
          with Sarah toward her SUV parked at the curb.

                                        SARAH
                          I thought you didn't do ghosts.

                                        JOHNNY
                        She's not a "ghost."  And I'm not
                        "doing" her.

                                        SARAH
                        Then what is she?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Probably a combination of his
                        memory and his imagination.

                                        SARAH
                        Might as well be a ghost.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Or maybe his old sweetheart is
                        back in the City.  But when he
                        saw her as a seventy-five year
                        old woman, he didn't recognize
                        her.  Not consciously anyway.

                                        SARAH
                        So his unconscious mind showed
                        him the next best thing?   

                                        JOHNNY
                                (shrugs)
                        Maybe.  The least I can do is go
                        to the scene of the crime and see
                        what I see.
                                (beat)
                          Besides, I can lose myself in New
                        York.

                                        SARAH
                        Tired of being Johnny?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Tired of everybody knowing I'm
                        Johnny.  As if they know what to
                        expect.





                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: ENIGMA - ACT TWO - REV. 4/10/02 - BLUE  25.


    19CONTINUED:19

                                        SARAH
                          I certainly didn't expect you to
                        go to New York chasing after a
                        ghost.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Me neither.

          They get into the SUV, Sarah hands Johnny a small wrapped
          gift resting on the front seat.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What's the occasion?

                                        SARAH
                        "Going Away From Sarah Day."
                                (beat)
                        Open it when you get there.

          They exchange a smile -- at once too easy and too
            uncomfortable.


  2020EXT. NEW YORK CITY - DAY - ESTABLISHING


  2121EXT. STREET CLOCK - NEW YORK - DAY

          A narrow street Mid-Town, with a standing street clock on
          the sidewalk in the middle of the block -- just where it
          has stood for most of the last century.  Johnny is beneath
          it, staring at the faces of the passersby.

                                                            A SERIES OF DISSOLVES:

          As the hours pass, and Johnny waits and watches -- but
          sees no "Abby."  Until the SOUND of a musical JINGLE
          interrupts his mission -- the source is his own travel
          bag.  Puzzled, Johnny locates the wrapped gift Sarah left
          him -- it's jingling.  He opens it, revealing a cell
          phone.  The jingling stops.  A beat, then it starts again.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hello?

                                                                                INTERCUT:


  2222EXT. JOHNNY'S BACKYARD - DAY

          Sarah is watering the pots, talking on her own cell as
          she goes.




                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: ENIGMA - ACT TWO - REV. 4/10/02 - BLUE  26.

                        I think you mean, "thanks for the
                        phone, it's my favorite color."
                                (re: traffic noise)
                        Where are you?

                        Under the infamous clock.  You?

                                        SARAH
                        Saving the lives of your poor
                        plants.  How's the clock?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Lonesome.  No sign of Arthur's
                        girl.

          Sarah considers.

                                        SARAH
                        Could she have any friends left
                        in New York?

                                        JOHNNY
                        From the old days?  Probably dead
                        or moved away by now...

          He suddenly stops, his mind working.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (quickly)
                        Can I call you later?

                                        SARAH
                        Yup.

          Sarah smiles.

          She hangs up.  Then her smile fades and a pensive look
          crosses her face -- plain and simply, she still loves him
          too much.

          Johnny punches a number into the cell phone.

                        Give me them all please.

          As he fumbles for a notepad and pen...


  2323EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NEW YORK - DAY - STOCK


  2424INT. ROSE'S APARTMENT - DAY

          A woman in her seventies, ROSE (the present day version
          of "Rosie" from 1945), is peeking through the crack of
          the door, still secured with a lock chain.

                                        ROSE
                        Arthur Allen?!  That's wonderful!

          She unfastens the chain and opens the door, revealing
          Johnny, travel bag off one shoulder.  He shakes her hand --

                                        JOHNNY
                        Pleased to meet you, Rose.

                                        ROSE
                                (upbeat)
                          "Rosie."

                                        JOHNNY
                        Rosie.

          If he hoped to get a vision from shaking her hand, he's
            disappointed.  Rose shows him into the room, buoyant.

                        Artie Allen, still alive!

                                        JOHNNY
                        Very much so.

                                        ROSE
                        Who would've guessed?  So many
                        have passed on.  At least I assume
                        they have.  It's not like I've
                        been keeping records.

          Johnny steps further into the room, and she notices his
          cane.

                                        ROSE
                        What happened to the leg?  Too
                        young for the War.  My war anyway.

                        Car accident.

          Not like she cares.  Rose's ruthlessly cheery demeanor
          might suggest a note of insincerity and self-absorption.

                                        ROSE
                        Is Artie in New York?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maine.

                                        ROSE
                        I went to Maine once.  More
                          Italians than I would have
                          expected.

          She indicates a chair for him to sit in, but Johnny spots
            something across the room that he recognizes from his
          visions -- a Stage Door Canteen apron, framed and hung on
          the wall.  Amazed, he heads for it.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's from the Stage Door Canteen
                        isn't it?

                                        ROSE
                        You have such a good eye! 
                                (upbeat)
                        He never did get over her, did
                        he?  She got to everybody, that
                        Abby.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Did she keep in touch?

                                        ROSE
                        Just disappeared.  But that was
                        the War.  People did things maybe
                        they wouldn't ordinarily do.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (lightly)
                        You too?

                                        ROSE
                                (coy)
                        I'd rather not say.

          Johnny indicates a big photo album on the shelf just below
          the framed apron.

                                        JOHNNY
                        May I?

                        Please.

          Johnny opens the book, turns the pages, revealing a program
          for a Stage Door musical show, a napkin, a coaster,
            photos... He touches each one, but no visions.  Then he
          turns to a faded B&W photo of Abby, Artie and Rosie. 
          They are goofing together in a park -- Abby holds a croquet
          mallet, Arthur wears a straw boater hat, young Rosie is
          mugging for the camera.  Johnny casually touches the photo --


  2525THE IMAGE SUDDENLY FILLS JOHNNY'S FIELD OF VISION

          THEN IS REPLACED BY ANOTHER, AND ANOTHER:

          A STYLIZED SERIES OF B&W STILL SHOTS, LIKE A VISIONARY
            "SLIDE-SHOW" -- as if by touching the photo, Johnny has
          tapped into the snapshots contained on the rest of the
          long lost film roll.  We see the three young friends in
          variations on the theme of Afternoon in the Park: Artie
          alone, Abby with Artie, Abby with Rosie, another with
          Abby and Artie, and then Abby, Abby, Abby -- image after
          image of Abby in the Park, at first with the other two in
          the background or mostly out of frame, then finally nothing
          but close-up shots of Abby, like stolen moments, as if
          the photographer had a single goal in mind.


  2626RESUME - ROSE'S APARTMENT

          Johnny recovers his composure.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Who took this picture?

                        Tommy Peterson.  A friend of ours.

                        Central Park.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Can you be more specific?

                                        ROSE
                        I could be.  But why would I be?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Just curious.

                        that's what you're thinking.

                                (lightly)
                        It's not.


  2727EXT. CENTRAL PARK - NEW YORK - DAY

          Johnny is wandering, lost and frustrated, finding nothing
          that looks like his vision from the photo.  He's tired,
          disheveled, still lugging the travel bag, but his
          fascination with this "case" -- and Abby -- seems to be
          increasing.

          He spots a nearby bench that wasn't there in 1945, now
          occupied by an elderly, well-dressed man who is feeding
          the birds from a bag of seed.  Johnny sits down on the
          bench next to him and is in a vision.


  2828EXT. CENTRAL PARK - NEW YORK - 1945 - VISION

            Johnny/Tommy, in uniform as always, is standing with Abby,
          who is wearing a different dress from the one seen in the
          photo.  This is another day, and neither Artie nor Rosie
          are anywhere to be seen.

                                        ABBY
                                (anxious)
                        Tommy, I don't understand what
                        you want.

                                        JOHNNY/TOMMY
                        I want what you want.

                                        ABBY
                        I could lose Artie... my job at
                        the Canteen... I want you to leave
                        me alone.

                                        JOHNNY/TOMMY
                        If I believed that, I wouldn't be
                        here.  Neither would you.

          At this, Abby is on the move, walking quickly away. 
            Johnny/Tommy catches up to her, taking her arm.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: ENIGMA - ACT TWO - REV. 4/10/02 - BLUE  31.


    28CONTINUED:28

          There's a charged moment between them -- maybe it's the
          War, maybe her own youth, maybe just his uniform, but
          whatever it is, she surrenders to it.  And they kiss with
          great passion.  She finally breaks it off, they are both
            breathing quickly.

                                        ABBY
                        I have to go.

          This time, Johnny/Tommy doesn't follow.  He watches, his
          own emotions in turmoil -- he's a Ladies' Man, falling in
          love is the last thing he expected.  He sits down on the
          bench.  The vision ends.


  2929EXT. CENTRAL PARK - NEW YORK - DAY - CONTINUOUS

          Johnny reacts, amazed at what he's just experienced. 
          There is a sudden MUSICAL JINGLE. 

                                                                                INTERCUT:

                        I saw her!

          He suddenly gets up from the bench and is on the move.

                          I kissed her!

          Sarah scowls, puzzled.

                                        SARAH
                        Who?

                        Other people.  Not you.

          The signal breaks up, ending the call.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hello?  Hello? 


  3131EXT. STREET CLOCK - NEW YORK - NIGHT

          Johnny is beneath it as before, staring at the passing
          faces.  He's pacing, a bit agitated and impatient, far
          more invested in the search than he was only hours ago.

          Then it happens: a TAXI pulls up to the curb.  A lovely
          young woman appears from around a corner, heading quickly
          for the cab.  It's Abby.

          Or maybe it's Abby.  The angle is off, the contemporary
          clothes jarring, but that profile...

          Johnny moves as quickly as possible toward the taxi, but
          he still can't get a clear view.  They reach the door of
          the vehicle simultaneously, and Johnny takes advantage of
          the moment, touching her shoulder with one hand while
          opening the door of the cab with the other, trying to get
          a look at her face.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Let me get that for you.

          And as she turns toward him, as her profile comes into
          view -- he is in a vision.


  3232EXT. STREET CLOCK - NEW YORK - NIGHT - 1945 - VISION

          The young woman turning toward him is indeed Abby --
          because this is 1945.  Johnny/Tommy has just opened the
          door to a period taxicab for her, and he follows her
          inside.


  3333INT. TAXICAB - NYC - NIGHT - 1945 - VISION - CONTINUOUS

            Johnny/Tommy, smiles warmly, trying not to scare her off
          by appearing over-eager.  But now that they're inside the
          cab, Abby looks suddenly troubled.

                                        ABBY
                          I should just go home.

            Johnny/Tommy puts a gentle hand on hers.

                                        JOHNNY/TOMMY
                                  (reassuring)
                          Whatever you want.

          A beat.  She lowers her eyes but says nothing.  That's
          good enough for him.

                                        JOHNNY/TOMMY
                                (to cabby)
                        The Swan Song Hotel.

          The vision ends.

          Johnny is still standing by the cab, but in the last few
          seconds, "Abby" -- if that's who it was -- has slipped
          into the back seat.  The door slams behind her.  Johnny
          tries to get a closer look through the window, but the
          cab takes off, disappearing up the street.  Johnny watches
          it go.  Then he fumbles for his cell phone, dials.

          Johnny hangs up, impatient.  Then stares at the clock --

          He clicks off the phone.


  3838INT. BANNERMAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Sarah stops pacing the floor, closing up her cell phone
          with a flustered ARGGH!  Walt, shirtless, is in bed,
            reviewing a work report.

                                        SARAH
                        He thinks he saw the girl!

                        And now he's looking for a hotel
                        that doesn't exist either.  Because
                        that's where they were headed.

                        He's just a little too into this.

          She sits down on the bed, thinking.

                                        SARAH
                        Can't you find pretty much anybody
                        these days?

                        I'd rather we found her.  Or some
                        kind of record of her.  This just
                        isn't healthy.

                        You're not jealous are you?

          Sarah is taken aback by the comment.

                                        SARAH
                        Of a fantasy woman?

                                (lightly)
                        That wouldn't be healthy.

          She snuggles up to him.  But Walt pushes it.

                        What happens when he finds somebody
                        for real?

          Sarah doesn't have an answer.


  3939INT. STUDY CARREL - NIGHT

          Johnny stops the microfilm reader at a page from a
            newspaper that shows "The Daily Enigma" -- the brain teaser
          Artie was seen working in 1945.  He considers it for a
          moment, then gives the knob on the machine one more turn,
            scrolling the paper forward till it stops on an engraved
          image illustrating an advertisement: The Swan Song Hotel.          THE DEAD ZONE: ENIGMA - ACT THREE - REV. 4/10/02 - BLUE  37.


  4040EXT. SMALL HOTEL - NYC - NIGHT

            Establish the same hotel entrance Johnny saw in the vintage
            newspaper ad.  The sign for the "Swan Song Hotel" is long
          gone, the place is shabby and tired.


  4141INT. HOTEL ROOM - NYC - NIGHT

          The door opens and Johnny steps inside, the door held
          open for him by a uniformed BELLBOY -- mid-20s, art school
          type, unsmiling but helpful, his humor dry as the thin
          layer of dust in this one-star establishment.

                                        BELLBOY
                        ...This was the Swan Song Hotel. 
                        And then, it wasn't.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I see.

          The Bellboy continues with his "Bellboy Routine" which is
          how the Artist in him makes sense of this job -- it's for
          his own amusement.

                                        BELLBOY
                        This was the Honeymoon Suite.

                                        JOHNNY
                        And then it wasn't.

                                        BELLBOY
                        No, it still is.

          He drops Johnny's bag onto a suitcase rack,  then indicates
          the knob on an old radiator.

                                        BELLBOY
                        Room temperature is at your
                          discretion.

          He indicates a plastic picnic cooler on the floor.

                                        BELLBOY
                        The minibar is available for your
                          convenience.

          Johnny's cell phone suddenly JINGLES in his pocket.  Once,
          twice, three times.  Johnny makes no move.

                                        BELLBOY
                        Will you answer it, Sir?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm kind of busy tonight.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: ENIGMA - ACT THREE - REV. 4/10/02 - BLUE  38.


    41CONTINUED:41

                                        BELLBOY
                                (conspiratorial)
                        Of course.

          The jingle finally stops.  A beat, then it starts again. 

                                        BELLBOY
                        You might consider turning the
                        ringer off.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I can do that?

                                        BELLBOY
                        Allow me.

          Johnny hands it over.  The Bellboy expertly manipulates
          the keys, and the jingling stops.  He hands it back.

                                        BELLBOY
                        It's set to "vibrate."

                                        JOHNNY
                                (puzzled)
                        Is that good?

                                        BELLBOY
                        Not good or bad, but neutral.

          Johnny nods, then pulls out a couple of one dollar bills
          and hands them over.

                                        BELLBOY
                        Too kind, Sir.

          He gives an imperceptible bow and exits, shutting the
          door behind him.  Alone in the room, Johnny starts to
          look around -- at the vaguely mid-seventies wallpaper,
          the plain furniture, the dull carpet.  If he expected a
            "rendezvous" with the Abby of his visions in this place...

          Johnny opens the picnic cooler "mini-bar," revealing a
          six pack of beer on ice.  And a bag of chips.  He goes to
          the bed, sits down.  He touches the bed with the palm of
          his hand, hoping... but no vision.

          He pulls out the bedstand drawer, revealing the ubiquitous
          Gideon's Bible inside.  This one looks like it's been
          there... well, forever.  He picks up the book, turns the
          pages idly, then stops and reads.

                        places of the stairs, let me see
                        thy countenance..."

          The room changes around him, and he is in a vision.


  4242INT. HOTEL ROOM - 1945 - NIGHT - VISION - CONTINUOUS

          Johnny is now Johnny/Tommy, still sitting on the bed with
          Bible in hand, reading aloud, continuing the lines from
          above.

                                        JOHNNY/TOMMY
                        "...let me hear thy voice; for
                        sweet is thy voice, and thy
                          countenance is comely."

          He looks up at Abby, who is standing tentatively nearby. 
          The room decor is 1940s romantic, definitely "Honeymoon
          Suite" material.  She's not close enough for him to touch,
          is still purposefully keeping her distance. 

                                        JOHNNY/TOMMY
                                (re: Bible)
                        Never knew the Good Book got it
                        so right.

          But faced with the moment, Abby is again torn.

                                        ABBY
                                (re: Bible)
                          Anything in there about not
                          coveting your neighbor's wife? 
                        And wives honoring their husbands?

                                        JOHNNY/TOMMY
                        You're not married yet.

                                        ABBY
                                (sincere)

                        We're there now.

          Abby is puzzled.

                        Every second that we let get away

          He puts down the Bible, and holds out his hand to her.

                        "Let me see thy countenance."

          Hesitation.  Then she takes his hand.  He pulls her toward
          him, and they kiss...

          A KNOCK at the door, and the vision ends.


  42A42AINT. HOTEL ROOM - NYC - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

          Johnny is snapped out of the vision -- the KNOCKING
          continues.  He gets up, opens it.  The Bellboy rolls in
          with a drinks cart holding a champagne bucket and two
          glasses.

                                        BELLBOY

          He continues into the room, then stops the cart and pulls
          a bottle of the cheapest champagne on the market out of
          the icebucket and starts to open it.

                                        BELLBOY

                        Stand back, Sir... there is a
                        danger.

          The cork comes off -- without a whimper let alone a pop. 
          The Bellboy artfully places his thumb over the lip of the
          bottle and gives it a violent shake.  Then he quickly
          pours into the two plastic champagne glasses.  A few sorry
          bubbles reluctantly break the surface.

                                        BELLBOY
                        Enjoy.

          Then he's out the door.  Johnny stares at the glasses for
            a moment, then sits back down on the bed.  No vision.  He
          picks up the bible again, letting it fall open to a page.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (reading)
                        "The length of the ark shall be*
                        three hundred cubits, the breadth*
                        of it fifty cubits..."*

          Still no vision.  Frustrated, Johnny sets the book aside. 
          Then he lays back down on the bed.  And is in a vision.          DEAD ZONE: ENIGMA - ACT THREE - REV. 4/19/02 - 2nd BLUE  40A.

            Johnny/Tommy is naked under the covers with an equally
          naked Abby.  They are in an embrace fueled by both passion
          and the knowledge of their "sin."

  4343INT. HOTEL ROOM - NYC - DAY

          The cell phone sits on the bedstand, vibrating.  Johnny's
          hand reaches out and picks it up.

          Reveal Johnny in bed, still groggy from sleep, in a     
          t-shirt and boxers.  He fumbles with the phone.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Hello...?

  4444INT. SARAH'S KITCHEN - DAY

          Sarah is pacing the kitchen phone in hand.

                                        SARAH
                        I've been trying to call you all
                        night!

          Walt, in uniform, looks up from his waffles at this --
          yup, all night.

                                        JOHNNY
                          I was... otherwise engaged.

                          Otherwise engaged.

                                        JOHNNY
                        We... I mean they... it was pretty
                          incredible.
                                (waking completely)
                        Abby and Tommy had a tryst.  Here
                        at the hotel.

                                        SARAH
                        And you saw it?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I lived it.

                                        SARAH
                        The two of them.  Having sex.

          Walt looks up again.

                        Don't be so crass.  They were in
                        love.

                                        SARAH

                        Abby, Tommy, Arthur... It was,
                        you know... "bigger than the three
                        of us."  That sort of thing.

                                        SARAH
                        Right.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sarah, this is the first woman
                        I've been with since... you and
                        me.

                                        SARAH
                        She wasn't real!

                                        JOHNNY
                        I was speaking psychologically.

                                        SARAH
                        I want you to come home now.

          Johnny is off the bed and pacing the hotel room.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What home?  Can you tell me where
                        I'm at home?  I'd like to know.

          Sarah is taken aback.

                                        SARAH
                          Johnny...

                        I'm not leaving.  It isn't over
                        yet.

                                        SARAH
                        What isn't over yet?  You and
                        Abby?  Or you and me?

          Walt is on his feet.

                                        WALT
                                (to Sarah, an edge)
                        Do you two want to be alone?

          Sarah waves at him to stay in the kitchen.

                                        SARAH
                                (to Walt)
                        No.

                          Johnny--

                        --I gotta go.

          He hangs up.  Sarah does the same.  She turns to Walt.

                                        SARAH
                                (exasperated)
                        He spent the night with her.  In
                        his head.

                                        WALT
                                (staying calm)
                        That's his problem.

          A beat.  Sarah sits at the table, calming herself, but
          still concerned. 

                                        SARAH
                        You were running some kind of a
                          database search...?

                                        WALT
                        We'll hear something today.


  4545EXT. DERELICT BUILDING - NYC - DAY

          Johnny is staring at the locked grate blocking a stairway
          heading down under the street level.  Trash and broken
          bottles are strewn across the steps.  He considers the
          scene, spotting a commemorative bronze plaque on the wall. 
          He moves to read it:

          DURING ALL THE COMBAT DAYS OF THE WAR BETWEEN THE UNITED
          NATIONS AND THE AXIS POWERS, THE AMERICAN THEATER WING
          STAGE DOOR CANTEEN OCCUPIED THIS SITE.

          Johnny puts his hand on the plaque, then on the wall.  No
          vision.  Frustrated, he turns toward the street and leans
          his back against the stone.  He is in a vision.


  4646EXT. STAGE DOOR CANTEEN - NIGHT - 1945 - VISION

            Johnny/Tommy is standing in exactly the same spot against
          the wall as Johnny was.

    46CONTINUED:46

          Only now there is a globe-shaped light instead of a bronze
          plaque, and it glows with the words "Stage Door Canteen." 
            Johnny/Tommy looks like he's trying to psych himself up
          for a confrontation, as he straightens his tie, brushes
          down his uniform, and turns to descend a set of stairs to
          the Canteen.


  4747INT. STAGE DOOR CANTEEN - NIGHT - 1945 - VISION

          The place is hopping with soldiers and hostesses. 
            Johnny/Tommy spots what he's looking for: Abby, in her
          striped apron, dancing with a young man in a naval uniform --
          just doing her job.  He quickly crosses the floor.  Abby
          is surprised and concerned to see him.

                                        ABBY
                        Tommy.

                                        JOHNNY/TOMMY
                        Who were you expecting, Tojo?
                                (cutting in)
                        Shove off Sailor, I'll convoy
                        this boat.

          The Sailor moves off as Johnny/Tommy takes Abby's hand
          and continues the dance.

                                        ABBY
                          I thought we agreed.

                                        JOHNNY/TOMMY
                        To give me the bum's rush?

                                        ABBY
                        To not see each other again.

          She looks over his shoulder at Artie seated at a table
          across the floor, head buried in his puzzles as usual.

                                        ABBY
                        Before somebody gets hurt.

                        Too late for that.

          Abby stops dancing, her voice desperate.

                                        ABBY
                        What happens after the War?  You'll
                        come back to me?

                                        JOHNNY/TOMMY
                        You know I will.

                                (off his hesitation)
                        That's not you, Tommy.  Never
                        will be.

          She's right.  But he won't admit it.

                                        JOHNNY/TOMMY
                        We're telling him.

          Abby tries to stop him, but he's already in motion.  He
          reaches Artie's table and remains standing.  Artie glances
          up, smiles hugely.

                          Wouldn't you like to know.

          Abby arrives, slipping onto the chair next to Arthur.

                                        ARTIE
                                (pleasant)
                        Yeah, I would.  We've only got a
                        few more days and I'd like to
                        spend one of them with my best
                        pal.

                                        JOHNNY/TOMMY

                        folks want to see you, too.

          Abby looks up at Johnny/Tommy, trying not lose it.  She
            purposefully echoes the words they exchanged when they
          first met.

                                        ABBY

                        He talks about you all the time.

          Faced with the moment of truth, Johnny/Tommy hesitates.

                                        JOHNNY/TOMMY
                        Really?

          Artie gives his best pal a warm smile -- then goes back
          to working his puzzle.  Johnny/Tommy stares at him, like
          he would a kid brother, with a sudden, overwhelming
          affection.  Then he looks at Abby, who is completely
          vulnerable.  And he decides to do the right thing.

                                        JOHNNY/TOMMY
                        I'm gonna clear out.

          Artie goes back to his puzzle as Johnny/Tommy turns to

                        I guess we won't see each other
                        again. 

                                        ABBY
                        Guess not.  

                                        JOHNNY/TOMMY
                        It was swell meeting you, Abby.

                                        ABBY
                                (barely)
                        You too, Tommy.

            Johnny/Tommy gives her one last smile, then turns toward
          the door -- his face is devastated.  As he crosses the
          floor, Rosie is hovering in his path -- as if she knows
          everything and has been waiting to make her move.

                                        ROSIE
                        Forget about her--

          But she might as well not exist.  Johnny/Tommy heads for
          the exit.          THE DEAD ZONE: ENIGMA - ACT FOUR - REV. 4/10/02 - BLUE  47.


  4848EXT. STAGE DOOR CANTEEN - NEW YORK 1945 - NIGHT - VISION

            Johnny/Tommy emerges up the stairway, a broken man.  He
          pauses at the top of the stairs, glances up at the glowing
          lantern proclaiming "Stage Door Canteen."  The vision
          ends.


  4949EXT. DERELICT BUILDING - NYC - DAY - CONTINUOUS

          Johnny comes out of his vision, still wracked by the
            emotions.  He looks dazed.  His cell phone vibrates in
          his pocket.  He pulls it out.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (disoriented)
                          Hello...

  5050EXT. BANNERMAN'S SUV - DAY

          Sarah gets out of the SUV in front of her house, slamming
          the door shut.  She's on the cell phone, her voice excited.

                                        SARAH
                        Abigail Travers was registered
                        with the New York Stage Actors'
                        Guild --

                                (puzzled)
                        -- But Abby wasn't an actress --

                                        SARAH
                        -- Apparently, she was.  Which
                        means "Abigail Travers" was
                          probably her stage name.

          OFF Johnny's reaction as this sinks in.


  5151INT. ROSE'S APARTMENT - NYC - DAY

          Johnny has just stepped inside.  Rose is all smiles.

                                        ROSE
                        How nice to see you again!  And
                        so soon after the last time!

                                        JOHNNY
                        You didn't tell me Abby changed
                        her name.

          Rose's smile gets just a little hard.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: ENIGMA - ACT FOUR - REV. 4/10/02 - BLUE  48.

                                        ROSE
                        You didn't ask.

                        Arthur never knew she was an
                          actress--

                                  (correcting him)
                          --Wanted to be an actress.  Just
                        like the rest of us.
                                (beat)
                        She wouldn't tell him because she
                          believed he would think less of
                        her.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Why didn't she answer his letters? 
                        Why did she leave New York?

                                        ROSE
                                (cheery)
                        I don't remember. 

          She moves across the room, looks up at the framed Stage
          Door apron on the wall.  Johnny stares at her for a beat. 
          Then:

                                        JOHNNY
                        Abby was having an affair with
                        Tommy Peterson.

                                        ROSE
                                (forced smile)
                        What if she was?

                                        JOHNNY
                        You were in love with Tommy.

          The woman's smile falters.  A long beat.  Then:

                                        ROSE
                        I don't know.  I don't know why
                        she went away.

          Johnny is suddenly facing a vulnerable, frail old woman. 
          He stops going on the offensive, quiets his voice.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Is that true?

                                        ROSE
                        She ended it with Tommy.  Tommy
                        and Arthur went to the War.

                        A month later, Abby disappeared.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Without a word?

                                        ROSE
                        Not to me.

          Johnny studies her for a moment -- and believes she's
          telling the truth.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Her real name?

          A beat.

                                        ROSE
                        What difference does that make
                        now?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe a couple of people who should
                        have been together can get another
                        chance.  While there's still some
                        time.

                                        ROSE
                                (cheery again)
                        Don't be such a drip.  We were
                        just a bunch of soldier crazy
                        victory girls...
                                (voice breaking)
                        It didn't matter then, it doesn't
                        matter now. 

                                        JOHNNY
                                (sincere)
                        I'm sorry.

                                        ROSE
                          Goodbye.

          There's nothing more Johnny can do here.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Goodbye.

          He heads for the door.  Rose starts paging through her
          book of memories.  Without looking up:

                                        ROSE

          Johnny turns toward her.  Her voice is wistful.

                        She said it would never fit on a

  5353INT. CHILDREN'S THEATER - NYC - DAY

          Johnny is standing close to the small stage, searching
          among the kids and few adult teachers scattered among
          them.  Then he turns and sees... something incredible. 
          Standing right next to him.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Abby...?

          She's the same young woman from his visions -- now wearing
            contemporary clothes and hairstyle, but there is no
            mistaking her.

                                        GRANDDAUGHTER
                        Yeah?

          Her voice has the edge born of years of fending off
          unwanted advances.  Johnny is really confused.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I... I just spoke with you...

          The young woman stares at him -- who is this nut?  Then
          it dawns on her.

                                        GRANDDAUGHTER
                        You mean my grandmother?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Grandmother...

                                        ABIGAIL
                        Mister Smith!

          An elegant, white-haired woman disengages herself from
          the kids she's teaching and steps closer -- she's happy
          to see him.  This is ABIGAIL, the present day version of
          the Abby from 1945.

                        I'll take a cab home.

          That's all her granddaughter wanted to hear.

                                        GRANDDAUGHTER
                        Cool.

          She turns and takes off.  Abigail indicates a couple of
          folding chairs on stage and they sit down.

                                        ABIGAIL
                        Tell me about Artie.  Arthur.

                        To be honest, I don't know him
                        very well.  But I know he misses
                        you.

                                        ABIGAIL
                        Still.

                                        JOHNNY
                        One track mind.

                                (smiles)
                        And you said you didn't know him.

                        He wants to see you.

          A long pause.

                        I'm not sure that's the best idea. 
                                  (carefully)
                        People can still be made to hurt. 
                        No matter how many years.

          Johnny reaches out and puts his hand on hers in a
          supportive gesture.  And has a vision.


  5454ANGLE - ABBY WITH A BABY - 1946 - VISION

          She's sitting in a spare wooden chair on the stage,
          cradling an infant girl in her arms, singing a wordless
          lullaby.  Johnny can see this image directly over the
          shoulder of the older woman in front of him.  The young
          mother's eyes are filled with love and sadness.  The quiet
          singing continues over:

                                        JOHNNY
                                (to Abigail)
                        You must have been lonely, raising
                        a child on your own.

          The vision is gone, but the mood remains melancholy and
          quiet.

                                        ABIGAIL
                        How did you know...?  Of course,
                        you met my granddaughter.
                                  (difficult)
                        I was engaged to Artie... I had a
                        baby by another boy.  A mutual
                        friend.  Tommy.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's why you left New York.

          Abby nods, now looking painfully toward the past.

                                        ABIGAIL
                        Tommy and me... We never should've
                          happened.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It was the War.

                                        ABIGAIL
                                (no excuses)
                        It was me.
                                (beat)
                        After my daughter was born... I
                        wrote to Tommy, just to tell him. 
                        He didn't write back.

    54CONTINUED:54

                                        JOHNNY
                                (suddenly difficult)
                        The white picket fence... coupla
                        kids... probably not his style.

          Abigail looks at him curiously -- then nods.

                                        ABIGAIL
                        But it was Artie I loved.  Artie
                          I wanted to grow old with.
                                (quiet)
                        Artie and me... we can't go back.

          A long beat.  Johnny's own eyes are suddenly wet.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Is that the only direction there
                        is?

          Abigail looks at him, a glimmer of hope in her expression.


  5555EXT. TAXICAB - STREET CLOCK - NYC - ANOTHER DAY

          Johnny and Arthur step out of the cab.  Johnny's wearing
          a change of clothes, Arthur has his best suit on.

                                        ARTHUR
                        I'm a little... nervous.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's understandable.

                                        ARTHUR
                        Maybe I can't do this.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Good enough.  Let's go back to
                        Maine.


    5656ARTHUR'S P.O.V. -- THE STANDING STREET CLOCK

          With the graciously aged Abigail already waiting there.


          BACK TO SCENE

          Arthur smiles hugely -- recognizing her instantly.

                                        ARTHUR
                        I'll take over from here, Johnny.

          Arthur moves toward Abigail.  Johnny watches as they shake


                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: ENIGMA - ACT FOUR - REV. 4/10/02 - BLUE  54.

          hands with each other... which turns into a close hug.

                                        GRANDDAUGHTER (O.S.)
                        How long is this going to take?


          INCLUDE GRANDDAUGHTER

          Johnny turns to see Abby's beautiful granddaughter, waiting
            impatiently, as before.

                                        GRANDDAUGHTER
                        A half hour?  What?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Does it matter?

                                        GRANDDAUGHTER
                                (re: Abigail)
                        I got stuck granny-watching this
                        week because my mother's out of
                        town.

          Apparently, the "personality" gene didn't get passed down.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Why don't we just leave them alone
                        for a hour and come back?

                                        GRANDDAUGHTER
                                (resigned)
                          Whatever.

          If Johnny entertained any thoughts of getting together
          with this woman -- which he did -- they are fast
            evaporating.  But he can't help but say it anyway:

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't suppose you'd be up for a
                        walk in the Park?

          She just looks at him.  Not a chance.

  5858EXT. CENTRAL PARK - NEW YORK - DAY

          Johnny is walking alone through now familiar territory.






                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: ENIGMA - ACT FOUR - REV. 4/10/02 - BLUE  55.


    58CONTINUED:58

          He reaches the bench where he had his visions, and sits
          down next to the usual occupant -- the elegant old man
          feeding his birds.  Johnny glances over at him, and is in
            a vision.


  5959EXT. CENTRAL PARK - NEW YORK - 1946 - VISION

            Johnny/Tommy is wearing his uniform, now decorated with
          medals -- this is after the war.  He is seated on the
          bench, a bag of seeds next to him.  He tosses the feed to
          the gathering birds, far too young to be doing this.  The
          vision ends.


  6060EXT. CENTRAL PARK - NEW YORK - DAY - CONTINUOUS

          Johnny comes out of the vision.  He looks again at the
          old man sitting next to him, and realizes:

                                        JOHNNY
                        Tommy Peterson?

                                        TOMMY
                        How do you know my name?

                                        JOHNNY
                          A mutual friend.

          The old man considers this for a moment, and we sense he
          might want to pursue it.  But the inertia of the decades
          spent alone is more than he can overcome -- this is the
          life he's chosen, no desire to change that now.  He just
          shrugs his shoulders.  Then takes a handful of seeds, and
          sets the bag down between them, within Johnny's reach. 
          Johnny stares at it for a beat, then takes a handful for
          himself.

          Two strangers on a bench, nothing in common, except a
          woman they both once knew.  They scatter the seeds and
          the birds come to join them.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                        END OF ACT FOUR

                                              THE END
