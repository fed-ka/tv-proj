Jay's got the keys. He looks at the parking tag, walks down
a row of beautiful classic cars, looking for the right car --
stops and smiles.
THE BIG MAN'S CADDY - JAY DRIVING
Reveal Jay cruising in the most gorgeous 1964 Coupe deVille
convertible. Fins, chrome, a thing of beauty.
From the seat next to him -- a fedora. He puts it on,
completing the look.
In the background we notice the Leggy Blond getting yelled at
by the guy who must be "The Big Man" Jay HONKS and waves --
thank you!
Jay finds some classic 60s music and enjoys himself for a
minute -- a sweet ride through 60s New York.
A GREAT 1969 HIT -- THE TEMPTATIONS' "Can't Get Next to You"
comes on the radio. Jay is swept up in the music and soon is
SINGING ALONG AT FULL BLAST.
At a light, he pulls even with an older Brooklyn Italian
couple. They give him a disapproving look. The woman
clutches her pearls just a little more protectively.
He smiles and leans towards them.
JAY
Guess what? Black president!
He laughs and drives off.
Pulls up at...
The secret entrance to MiB HQ, familiar from the first movie.
Jay strides up to the entrance and... can't open the door.
Bangs on the door -- nothing. Shaking the knob, calling to
the guard... nothing. From behind him:
VOICE (O.S.)
Help you? Look a little lost.
JAY
Yeah, thanks, listen--
32.
Jay turns and is face-to-face with two grinning Staten Island
cops. He instantly realizes what's about to go down.
JAY (CONT'D)
(SIGHS)
Yeah, guess I knew this wasn't
gonna be just people handing me
money and Cadillacs.
COP 1
'Scuse me?
JAY
Nothing, officer. I'll be on my
way.
COP 2
That's an awful nice car.
JAY
Thanks.
COP 1
Kind of work you do, individual of
your particular... ethnic
persuasion... to buy a car like
that?
COP 2
Wouldn't be anything illegal, would
it?
COP 1
You an athlete or something?
JAY
Yeah, I'm the North American
champion of kiss my ass.
The cop loses his smile, turns to his partner:
COP 1
That sound like resisting arrest to
you?
COP 2
Sure did.
They grab him, start to frisk him --
COP 2 (CONT'D)
Well, well. Boy, you're gonna have
a little problem explaining THIS.
33.
The cop holds up Jay's HIGH-TECH GUN -- the NOISY CRICKET
and his NEURALIZER.
A BLACK CROWN VIC SCREECHES UP between the cops and JAY.
Out steps KAY -- but 40+ years younger.
KAY
(flashes a badge)
I'll take it from here.
COP
Who the hell are you?
KAY
Agent Kay, Division 2, special...
(gives Jay a look)
.black ops. Thank you for your
cooperation, if I could ask you to
look here for a moment --
Kay pulls out what looks like a NEURALIZER -- and swiftly
beats each one over the head -- it's just a BLACKJACK -- they
crumple.
JAY
Kay? Kay, is that you? Oh, man
it's good to see you, buddy!
Jay hugs Kay -- who remains stony-faced. Jay gets a little
choked up to see his friend alive -- Kay is a rock.
JAY (CONT'D)
Look at you, all... sort-of-
young... Kay!
KAY
That's got to be the first time an
unregistered alien caught sneaking
onto Earth was happy to see me.
Jay pulls away, realizing--
JAY
Oh! You think -- aw,that's funny.
No, it's not like that. You see,
I'm your partner.
KAY
If I had a partner I'd know it.
JAY
There's a simple explanation for
that.
34.
KAY
I'm all ears.
JAY
You see I'm your partner...
(knows he's about to sound
CRAZY)
In the future. And I came back to
save you.
A longdry stare.
KAY
Well, thank you very much.
JAY -
Hey, no problem, man. I got you--
KAY
Yeah, thought I'd heard them all.
Usually, they offer a great gift to
the people of Earth in exchange for
refuge. Time-travelling partner
from the future -- that's some
extra-credit right there, and I do
appreciate you bringing some much-
needed variety to what can be a
very dull job. But I'm still gonna
have to bring you in.
JAY
Yeah, ok, I know it sounds a little-
KAY
It sounds a LOT--
JAY
That's why I'm going to prove it to
you... Because if I weren't from
the future, would I know about --
your little top-secret headquarters
right HERE??
He tries to force the door open. Nothing.
JAY (CONT'D)
I said -- HERE?
(tries - nothing)
HERE??!?
Jay finally kicks the door open --
And inside... we SEE...
35.
An abandoned building, filled with spiders, etc.
JAY (CONT'D)
Right. Not here yet. But it will
be. Gonna need to get rid of the
raccoons and bats and stuff, but...
it'll be real nice. Game room over
there for your pinball, you love
your pinball. Lotta good times
there -- I'm going for an extra
ball, Jay! you'd say. And I'd be
there. With you. Partners.
Long stare from Kay.
KAY
Let's go. And word of advice -= I
don't know what it's like on your
planet, but around here, a guy with
your... complexion in a car like
that is gonna get some attention he
doesn't want.
We hear the way-too-loud death-rattle exhaust note of what
sounds like ten Harleys at once.
Reveal -- Yaz, the nightmare biker, looking like Dennis
Hopper meets Satan, riding a badass custom skull-themed rig
that might have dropped out of the brain of Stanley Mouse.
His skull ring gleams on his pinkie. Devil Girl sits behind
him, hands on his shoulders.
We ride with them a beat, tearing down the highway...
They STOP AT A LIGHT -- even with a brightly-painted microbus
full of hippies.
One of the hippies leans out --
HIPPIE
Hey, you guys like to party? Care
to make a trade for the mama?
Yaz pulls out his alien "guns." The stoned hippie smiles
serenely and puts a flower in one of the mouths. Makes a
peace sign.
HIPPIE (CONT'D)
Make love, not war.
36.
Yaz "fires" the alien -- it launches into the microbus --
followed by its brother.
The microbus rocks, hippies scream, the bus dents from the
inside-out. On a bumper sticker: If This Van's a-rockin',
don't come a knockin'.
The guns, finished, return to Yaz.
Yaz surveys the carnage, picks up a medallion off one of the
hippies. But looking at it more closely, frowns and throws
it away.
The head back on their way... Blood drips over the Ass, Gas
or Grass bumper sticker...
We dissolve from the blood to a deep red STRAWBERRY SUNDAE.
Widen to reveal we are in...
A squat shack on the edge of a dump, home office to a
"legitimate local business."
The windows are bloodied and broken from the inside.
Corpses of wiseguys litter the front of the building, all
showing disturbing spore growth. [please see
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuKjBIBBALS for reference]
The corpses DEMATERIALIZE and disappear.
JAY
This doesn't look like a mob hit.
KAY
That's a hell of an observation.
What gave it away?
JAY
Spores. Dematerializing corpses.
And THAT.
Jay points beyond the building... a SHEER DROP
Which is the edge of a HUGE SMOKING CRATER --
And how did this crater get here?
48.
In the center, a GIANT ROCKET, all chrome and Flash Gordon.
It formed the crater on landing.
KAY
We're going in.
Kay draws his weapon.
JAY
Aren't you gonna give me a.gun?
KAY
Right.
He pulls out a Smith and Wesson, dumps the bullets, and hands
it over.
KAY (CONT'D)
Try not to get in my way.
JAY
You try not to get in MY way.
Jay and Kay move towards the building... BAM! BAM! BAM!!
Someone's firing at them -- they dive for cover.
More GUNSHOTS --
Jay gives Kay THE SIGNAL, WE SAW IN THE CHINESE RESTAURANT
KAY
What the hell is that?
JAY
Stay behind me. You need to stay
alive.
KAY
The hell I will.
Jay tries to go in -- Kay pushes him out of the way and goes
in first.
VINCENZI BROTHERS
Jay and Kay bust in -- almost fall into the room because
they're squabbling over who's first --
Then - BAM!
49.
Someone's hiding under a desk, holding a gun over his head,
firing randomly.
Kay gets GRAZED --
They dive for cover. Kay's right hand is bleeding.
JAY
Huh. So that's how you got the
scar.
Jay tosses his EMPTY GUN into the corner -- the guy under the
desk fires FIVE TIMES - EMPTYING HIS GUN!
Jay sprints at him, flips the table -- it's a terrified,
quivering WISEGUY. Jay grabs him and DISARMS HIM.
The guy is FREAKED OUT.
WISEGUY
[TERRIFIED BLUBBERING]
JAY
What'd he look like?
WISEGUY
[BLUBBERING]
JAY
Pull it together!
Jay SLAPS THE GUY.
JAY (CONT'D)
The guy who did this --- what'd he
look like?
WISEGUY
Looked like a biker... And he had
a... He had a skull ring...
Jay and Kay share a look.
JAY
That's him.
BACK WITH JAY AND KAY
Walking up to Kay's car.
In the background, MiB puts up a facade around the rocket --
"Rocket Waste Disposal", techs take samples.
50.
JAY
What about the witness? We don't
have time to take him back to HQ to
NEURALIZE HIM--
KAY
We've got something new. Portable
Neuralizer.
With a rumbling and BLASTS OF AIRHORNS, 18-wheelers drive up,
housing the "portable" Neuralizer.
KAY (CONT'D)
Can you believe how small these
things are getting?
JAY
Yeah.
KAY
Okay, slick. I'm making a decision
to believe you. Not because I do,
but because I have to, you get me?
He walks to the trunk, pops it open.
He flips a switch, revealing a HIDDEN ARSENAL.
He grabs a COOL GUN and gives it to Jay. Jay admires the
DEADLY FIREARM.
JAY
Aw, this means you like me, doesn't
it?
KAY
Let's go get this sunovabitch.
They climb in but -- SCREECH!!!
A Crown Vic swerves to a stop in front of them. Out pops an
APOPLECTIC EX --
EX
Kay! Don't move a goddamn muscle!
I have you on 12 protocol
violations!
Kay looks to Jay.
KAY
Make it thirteen.
He GUNS IT -- THEY TEAR OFF...
51.
YAZ'S BIKE
Widen - he's on his bike, pulling into
NEW YORK CITY - TOLLBOOTH ON THE BRIDGE
Yaz approaches the tollbooth, manned by a gruff NY no-BS, no-
time for anyone TOLLBOOTH COLLECTOR.
TOLLBOOTH COLLECTER
Exact change only.
YAZ
Can you help a stranger, please?
TOLLBOOTH COLLECTER
Oh, sure. That's what I'm here
for. You see that thing behind
you? That's New Jersey. Go home
and get some change.
YAZ
There's been a great injustice in
the Universe. I must make it
right.
TOLLBOOTH COLLECTER
You know what's also a great
injustice? Sitting in this box all
day listening to people try to get
out of paying the toll.
YAZ
Let me ease your pain.
On Yaz's evil grin...
KAY AND JAY DRIVE INTO THE CITY
KAY
Now tell me everything you know
about this Yaz scumbag.
JAY
In two days he's gonna kill you in
Florida.
KAY
Two days. Doesn't give me a lot of
time. You couldn't have come back
a week ago?
52.
JAY
Sorry, I was distracted by the
Earth blowing up.
KAY
So we have two days to kill him
before he kills me. Alright,
there's one cesspool everyone
washes up in sooner or later.
Someone'll know something there.
Come on. Let's take a drive to
Alien Town.
JAY
Alien Town?
They drive under a sign indicating: EAST VILLAGE
WITH YAZ
Cruising through NY. Devil Girl on the seat behind him. He
pulls even with a patrol car.
YAZ
Excuse me, officers of the law.
Like you, I care a great deal. about
justice and I'm looking for some
people. Maybe you can help me.
OFFICER
Okay -- get a shave and a haircut..
They laugh.
Yaz smiles sadly.
YAZ
Have you ever lost someone close to
you? I have. I've lost everyone.
Everyone except them. Can you help
me find them?
He gives the cops a picture, they take it grudgingly -- we
see it: a half dozen hippies wearing medallions.
The cops look at each other and raise eyebrows.
OFFICER
Only one part of town where people
like that hang out...
53.
The historic Village landmark.
Jay and Kay approach... 60s freaks eyeball the squares...
IN THE ELEVATOR
Jay and Kay ride to the sixth floor.
JAY
There's gotta be something that
connects you to Yaz. What cases
are you working on?
KAY
Well, I'got this whole dry ice
thing.
JAY
Dry ice? What's that? Someone get
killed over some dry ice?
Smuggling something in some dry
ice?
KAY
No. We just can't figure out what
it is.
JAY
Wow, you're pretty low on the totem
pole, aren't you? The great Kay,
looking for dry ice.
KAY
Don't push your luck.
The doors open, and we're in...
A WAY-OUT 60'S PARTY
Kay's on the hunt for someone. They weave their way through
the far-out types, hear snippets of high-60s party
conversations.
Someone notices Jay's suit --
PARTY SNOB
What are you, a time traveller?
JAY REACTS--
54.
PARTY SNOB (CONT'D)
That suit is SO five years ago.
Kay sees who he's looking for, grabs him:
KAY
We need to talk.
Reveal ANDY WARHOL -- and this is the Factory, and this is
one of Warhols' famous parties.
Draped on Warhol -- a bunch of strange hangers-on, his
"stars."
ULTRAVIOLET
Yum, pigs are getting cute.
Jay smiles -- she looks skeeved out.
ULTRAVIOLET (CONT'D)
I meant the young one.
Warhol speaks with his strange -- yes, almost alien --
affect.
WARHOL
It's not really a good time to
talk. I'm creating a party.
(sighs, totally put out)
But... Maybe if he asks me.
JAY
What - me?
WARHOL
I would never say no to anything
that came out of that beautiful
mouth...
Jay is visibly uncomfortable. Kay nudges Jay - do it.
JAY
[Grumbles about what he has to do
for his partner].
(then, to Warhol)
We need to talk. Please.
Warhol and his Stars ooh and ahh over Jay. Someone snaps a
picture.
WARHOL
Amazing, just amazing. Alright,
you talked me into it. Follow me.
(MORE)
55
WARHOL (CONT'D)
(TO ENTOURAGE)
Be back soon, stars.
PRIVATE STUDIO LOFT
From here, a window looks out over the whole scene.
Warhol leads the guys in, shuts the door and LOCKS IT.
Immediately, his ENTIRE AFFECT CHANGES -- he rips off his
WIG, lights a cigarette, and talks like a hard-nosed cop.
WARHOL
Damnit, Kay, are you TRYING to blow
my cover?
KAY
Take it easy agent W, your cover is
perfectly safe.
WARHOL
Perfectly safe? Are you out of
your goddamned mind? It's only a
matter of time before they figure
out I'm a total fraud.
KAY
Cool your jets--
WARHOL
I'm so out of ideas I'm painting
bananas and soup cans for
chrissakes. How long do you really
think they're gonna keep buying
this shit?
Warhol slumps on a chair.
WARHOL (CONT'D)
I can't take it anymore. Talking
to these nutjobs and all these
goddamn hippies. God, I hate
hippies. They're just filthy, Kay.
KAY
Yeah, I know they are, buddy. But
you're doing good work here. We
need you.
A knock at the door -- Warhol gets back into character --
56.
WARHOL
I'll be right there... I'm just...
filming these men eating a
hamburger... It's... transcendent.
Okay, now the pickle...
(back to cop form)
You see what I mean? And who the
hell's this guy? New partner?
JAY
Actually, I'm his old partner. I
came from the future to warn him
ABOUT--
WARHOL
Jesus, fine, don't tell me.
Alright, what do you need?
JAY
We're looking for a recent arrival.
Long hair, wears a lot of
leather...
Warhol indicates the party below -- half the guests match
that description.
WARHOL
You'll have to do better than that.
Look, if that's all you have, I
can't help you.
KAY
Maybe you know someone who's seen
something.
STAR (O.S.)
Andy, the horse is here...
WARHOL
I gotta get back in there--
JAY
Hold up -- the guy we're looking
for -- he's out to destroy the
world.
WARHOL
C'mon, what's new? What does an
MiE call it when someone tries to
destroy the world? Tuesday.
JAY
I thought you made that up.
57.
KAY
C'mon, W, I got a feeling on this
one. Like we should take it
serious. And we don't have much
time.
Jay checks his watch.
JAY
33 hours.
WARHOL
Yeah, yeah, alright.
(THINKS)
Okay, talk to Prell and Vidal.
C'mon.
IN THE PARTY
ON TWO BEAUTIFUL WOMEN - in very 60s fashion with incredibly
giant hair - one with a big afro, one with big chignon
hairdo.
WARHOL (O.S.)
(back in "character")
Vidal, Prell, can you please talk
to these nice men?
The women's LIPS DON'T MOVE -- they respond in incongruously
GRUFF VOICES:
PRELL
Whadaya want?
VIDAL
They look like cops to me.
ain't talking.
PRELL
We're not rats.
We swing around them to REVEAL that Warhol/Kay/Jay are not
talking to the women's faces --
They're STANDING BEHIND THE WOMEN -- TALKING TO THEIR HAIR-
DO'S which we realize are two COMPLETE HAIR ALIENS, VIDAL and
PRELL, perched atop these women.
KAY
Start talking, you two, before you
end up on a barber's floor.
58.
PRELL
Ah, you don't scare me.
KAY
Yeah?
Kay reaches into a passing woman's purse, pulls out
HAIRSPRAY. Grab some of Prell and holds up the spray.
PRELL
You wouldn't!
He sprays the hair, it starts to SCREAM IN PAIN.
VIDAL
Stop, you bastard!
PRELL
I'm telling you, we don't know
anything!
KAY
You wanna play tough? How about we
take a ride to the barber college,
see how tough you are?
Kay keeps shaking them down, but Jay is distracted...
On Jay... something is making him think...
A sound... it. grows louder... we start to be able to make out
the distinct bip... bip... bip... of PONG
Jay FOLLOWS THE SOUND...
To a group of people -- that incredible Factory mix from
slumming socialites to Black Panthers to the freakiest
freaks...
They surround a SKANKY GUY -- and whatever they're watching
on TV is so mesmerizing it's like they're seeing the face of
God...
BROOKE ASTOR
It's too beautiful.
Someone takes a picture of the screen.
Jay walks around the TV -- REVEAL:
They're watching CLASSIC EARLY 70S PONG.
59.
The SKANKY GUY controls it via a BIG MEDALLION hooked up to
the TV antennae terminals. He's playing against a young
clean-cut square.
Jay grabs the wires and rips them out, cutting off the game.
Everyone JEERS him.
ON KAY, hearing the noise, turns to see what's going on.
SKANKY GUY
What the hell, man?
JAY
Just wondering where you got that.
SKANKY GUY
Your mother.
The crowd laughs.
JAY
Really. So my mother gave you a
technology that hasn't been
INVENTED FOR SEVEN YEARS?
Jay grabs him by the throat.
Partygoers react. Someone takes pictures. Someone claps in
delight.
JAY (CONT'D)
Now how about you tell me where you
really got it?
The skanky guy knows he's in trouble.
SKANKY GUY
Oh... uh... okay, no hassles,
man... I got it from that dude over
there... With the beard.
Jay turns, lets go just long enough for the guy to LEAP OUT
THE WINDOW
Jay takes off after him -- Kay joins
And the CHASE IS ON
CHASE THROUGH THE VILLAGE
Jay and Kay chase the guy through various 60s locations - a
commune, an ashram, a folk club, a protest.
60.
Everywhere they are mistaken for "pigs" - people get in their
way.
To Jay's surprise, young Kay is a hell of a runner, in
incredible shape. It gets competitive between them...
Until Jay can't keep up -- Kay takes off...
Kay runs the Skanky Guy down -
Jay huffs and puffs his way over, grabs the medallion.
JAY
Alright, one more time. Where'd
you get this?
SKANKY GUY
It was a gift--
JAY
Bullshit.
Kay puts a gun on him.
JAY (CONT'D)
Oh, hey. This is my partner. He's
about to get fired for excessive
violence and he doesn't have much
left to lose.
SKANKY GUY
I borrowed it!
CLICK! Kay cocks the gun.
SKANKY GUY (CONT'D
I stole it, okay?
JAY
That's what I like. A nice, honest
thief. Stole it from who?
SKANKY GUY
They don't even care, man. They
leave their money everywhere.
JAY
Who?
SKANKY GUY
I don't know who they are--
61.
KAY
Then you're not worth much to us,
are you?
The gun comes back out.
SKANKY GUY
I heard they were Archanans.
JAY
Archanans? They're pretty far out
of their neighborhood. I didn't
think we'd ever had one on Earth
before.
SKANKY GUY
I can tell you where they live!
Southwest corner of 3rd and Avenue
C. Top floor. Apartment 12.
Jay rips the medallion off his neck.
SKANKY GUY (CONT'D)
Ow!
JAY
I'll do a lot worse. Get the hell
out of here.
The guy runs off.
KAY
What's the deal with the necklace?
JAY
You were wearing one just like it
when you died. Come on.
SOUTHWEST CORNER OF 3RD AND AVENUE C
Jay and Kay pull up in front of the building.
KAY
That address. It's familiar.
He pulls out a notebook.
KAY (CONT'D)
I was going to come by here
tomorrow to check out a lead on the
dry ice case.
62.
JAY
So you come here tomorrow, get
tangled up with these Archanans...
And...
KAY
And Yaz kills me?
JAY
Something like that. So do me and
the people of Earth a favor and be
careful.
KAY
Aw, put on your big girl panties
and let's go.
JAY
Hey, I've always got my big girl
panties on.
Huh. That didn't sound right.
JAY
How are we going to find them? Any
idea what an Archanan looks like?
And then -- they see --
AMID THE SEA OF GUYS IN SUITS, HATS, AND SKINNY TIES...
67.
A circle of what looks like Tibetan monks -- colorful,
playful, dressed in robes.
They could only be -- the Archanans.
The group comprises one older Archanan -- the LAMA -- and
three younger ATTENDANTS.
KAY
I think I found them.
They step into
THE ARCHANANS' AURA
Within the space around the Archanans, the chaos and noise of
the crowd melts away. Deflected.
There are three Archanans and one distinctive older one --
THE LAMA.
In the middle -- a giant pile of winnings.
All is peaceful within this space. Faint chimes.
They greet Jay and Kay happily, chant a strange mantra:
ARCHANANS
(CHANTING)
King Lady Big Trouble Classy...
The faint sound of an announcer:
ANNOUNCER (V.0.)
Results for the sixth race: King,
Sweet Sophie, Big Trouble and Red
Gent!
ARCHANANS
(CHANTING)
Superba pays 3200 to one...
JAY
You're in danger--
ARCHANANS
You're in danger... you're in
danger...
Jay thinks they're playing the "echo game" like little kids:
JAY
Very cute, but--
68.
LAMA
In eight seconds, please do us the
kindness of ducking.
JAY
Huh?
KAY
Yaz!
They turn to see YAZ -- he levels a WEAPON AT THEM -- FIRES!
Jay and Kay DUCK -- the weapon just misses.
JAY
Thanks.
KAY
Let's get into trouble.
Jay and Kay engage him --
As they run off, the Lama calls --
LAMA
Remember, please, to take the
bridge.
And we begin
BIG FIGHT SET PIECE.
Try to include motorcycle and horse elements. Could also
involve the actual aqueduct, which is close by.
At one point, Jay and Kay seem stuck, they remember...
JAY
Take the bridge...
They take the bridge, which gives them an advantage on Yaz.
At one point, Jay corners Yaz -- Yaz BLASTS HIM -- Jay is
knocked down. Looks DEAD! But he shakes it off reveal
the PONG medallion blocked the shot.
Culminating at a toxic waste dump in Staten Island, with Yaz
compressed into .a six inch cube - hauled away in the back of
a garbage truck.
The guys give chase -- they want him captured, but no luck.
The truck drives off...
69.
KAY
He's gone.
JAY
Only a matter of time before he
comes back. And this time he might
be really mad.
AQUEDUCT RACE TRACK
Jay and Kay return to an EMPTY RACE TRACK...
It's like a ghost town.
No Archanans to be found...
JAY
Damn, we lost them. They come all
the way across the universe and
just when we're about to figure out
what all of this is about--
Then, faintly... a CHEER
KAY
Hold that thought.
They follow it out to
THE TRACK
Which is empty. No spectators, no horses. Just the
Archanans...
Who stand near the track watching... nothing.
And yet --
They cheer and clap as if watching the most exciting race
ever.
Jay and Kay exchange a "what the hell?" Look and approach
them.
JAY
Everybody OK?
ARCHANANS
Everybody is everybody.
70.
JAY
Yeah... guess I can't argue with
that. So listen up -- Yaz is down
but he won't be for long, so we
need to start coming up with some
answers. First of all--
The Archanans CHEER. Jay shakes it off.
JAY (CONT'D)
FIRST
The Archanans CHEER AGAIN.
JAY (CONT'D)
What are you cheering about?!
ARCHANANS
The races.
Jay and Kay keep approaching... Puzzled -- the track is
empty...
JAY
What races?
Jay and Kay cross the threshold into their aura... and now--
The empty stands are FILLED WITH CHEERING SPECTATORS WATCHING
AN INCREDIBLY EXCITING RACE.
JAY (CONT'D)
Where are we?
LAMA.
We are tomorrow.
Jay steps backwards, out of the aura -- back to empty ghost
town.
Steps back in -- tomorrow's rabid fans, cheering the race.
From the Archanans' POV -- we see ALL VERSIONS/ALL AGES OF
JAY AND KAY..
The effect is -- THEY SEE ALL TIME AT ONCE.
JAY
You... can see the future.
LAMA
It is what you call the future.
71.
ATTENDANT
Ah, the future. An illusion of the
time-bound, borne of the fallacy
that one moment follows another.
LAMA
Yaz suffers from this greatly. And
so he must have revenge on your
planet.
JAY
Revenge?, For what?
LAMA
He mourns the past because he can
not see the dead are still as alive
as they ever were. Just not now.
JAY
Okay, someday you're gonna explain
that to me, but right now you need
to stop the riddles because there's
about two minutes until Yaz crawls
out of his hole and gets back to
trying to kill you. So help me
out. I need to know IN ENGLISH why
Yaz is trying to kill you and what
that has to do with saving the
Earth.
ATTENDANT
We know what he will know.
JAY
You know what... he will know...
(figuring it out)
You know his plans.
(REALIZING)
And you're going to stop him. He
wants to kill you because you stop
him.
LAMA
(CHEERFUL)
Yes, if he does not kill us first.
KAY
Don't you know if he's going to?
LAMA
Sometimes he kills us, sometimes he
does not. There are many futures.
72.
JAY
Okay, which future is the one where
you live and the Earth doesn't blow
up?
LAMA
The one where you take us home.
Jay and Kay exchange a look --
KAY
Alright, let's get these freaks
home, and pronto.
LAMA
You must let go of your. attachment
to time, beginning with your
concept of "pronto."
And on that -- THUP THUP THUP --
12 Blacked-out helicopters...
EX (V.0.)
(MEGAPHONE)
Illegal aliens -- you are
surrounded... Do not attempt to
flee...
Jay and Kay YELL INTO THE BACKWASH OF THE ROTORS:
JAY
No! We need to get them home!
But it's all drowned out in the wind and dust...
MiB "squad cars" -- pull up and surround them.
Jay and Kay look for an escape route -- but MiB cars and
trucks seem to be pouring in from everywhere.
MiB agents descend on ropes, round up the Archanans--
EX (V.0.)
(MEGAPHONE)
Agent Kay! Return to your vehicle!
Rendezvous at headquarters in 20
minutes! We will escort you by
air!
And from the noise and chaos of the choppers...
To silence...
73.
The hustle and bustle -- cabs picking up and dropping off
PASSENGERS --
We find a LONG LINE OF UNHAPPY KIDS, MAKING UNHAPPY PARENTS --
Kids crying, pulling on Mom's dress...
We see -- it's the line to an ICE CREAM TRUCK.
And the line isn't moving because KAY IS QUESTIONING THE
PAPER-HATTED VENDOR.
DRY ICE SMOKE rises from the freezer:
KAY
Just a few more questions about dry
ice and I'll be out of your hair...
A BIRD CALL makes Kay turn --.he sees Jay waving him over,
pointing at something -- The MiB agents lead the Archanans
into the Station!
VENDOR
I told you ten times -- I got no
idea what dry ice is!
KAY
(not listening).
Thanks, you've been very helpful.
Jay and Kay peel off, follow the MiB agents, leaving the
Vendor scratching his head. He turns back to the kids.
Jay and Kay follow the MiBers and Archanans inside...
77.
Sugar cane workers pick crops next to a GIANT IRRIGATION
PIPE.
They look up as SCREAMS DOPPLER THROUGH THE PIPE -- what the
hell was that?
We follow the SCREAM...
85.
BACK IN THE TUBE
Jay CONTINUES TO SCREAM --
TUBE P.A. (V.0.)
All passengers, prepare to de-tube.
JAY
De-tube?
TUBE P.A. (V.0.)
Please make sure all helmet and
crash suit straps are securely
fastened.
On Jay -- no helmet, no crash suit.
JAY
Helmet? No one said anything about
A--
POOP!
Jay, Kay and the Archanans are launched from the tube like
human cannonballs...
The Archanans land gracefully, floating down air currents
like kung fu masters...
Kay hits with both feet and rolls...
Jay face plants into the water.
Jay looks up -- FIVE MANATEES STARE HIM DOWN. The ALPHA
MANATEE emits along, lowing manatee song which RESOLVES INTO
COUGHING --
ALPHA MANATEE
Sorry, I have something in my
throat. They went that way...
JAY
Thanks.
Surrounded by thick brush, trees. Jay staggers out of the
water, looking beat to hell.
JAY (CONT'D)
Kay? Archanans? Everyone OK?
86.
Reveal -- Everyone else looks clean and pressed. Jay looks
around -- nothing but brush and swamp.
JAY (CONT'D)
Listen, your, uh...
Arachaness...ness? I don't think
this here is the way back to your
planet.
The Archanans smile and WALK OFF... Jay and Kay follow --
JAY (CONT'D)
Hey wait -- we can't help you get
home, if you don't tell us how...
He trails off as they EMERGE FROM THE BRUSH
And stop dead...
JAY (CONT'D)
Whoa. So that's how you're getting
home.
Reveal -- A GLORIOUS SHOT OF THE APOLLO ROCKET
And they head towards destiny...
CAPE CANAVERAL - LAUNCH SITE
Jay and Kay take in the MASSIVE SCENE...
The huge crowd, the security, the press. HISTORY IN THE
MAKING.
T-Minus 30 minutes.
JAY
Okay. So we've got... 30 minutes
to get past security. Get into
Mission Control. Reprogram the
flight path, pull the Astronauts
off the launch and get them in that
rocket.
KAY
Well, then. Better get started.
JAY
Weird. I feel like I've been here.
(BEAT)
Okay, I've got a plan to get
through security. We just need to
be invisible.
87.
YAZ ON HIS BIKE
Hurtling down the highway on his superfast bike, kicking up a
HUGE DUSTSTORM...
He gets STUCK BEHIND AN 18-WHEELER. Yaz REVS -- and SPEEDS
RIGHT THROUGH THE TRUCK, SPLITTING IT IN HALF.
Down the CAUSEWAY -- the rocket in the distance...
Heavily guarded by AIR FORCE SECURITY -- people with a lot of
guns and very little sense of humor.
And up steps Jay, leading Kay and the Archanans.
JAY (O.S.)
'Scuse me... I need to get
inside... I've got the big man's
Cadillac... all washed and ready to-
Before the words are out of Jay's mouth, he's down on the
ground with a submachine gun stuck in his neck.
GUARD
Move and it's the last thing you
do!
The security is on Kay and the Archanans, forcing them down.
Kay gives Jay a look --
KAY
Good work. It's like we're not
even here.
GUARD
(INTO RADIO)
Sir, this is unit 3 bravo -- we
have an attempted perimeter breach
into mission control subhallway
Charlie. One caucasian, one
negroid, four... other. Yes, sir.
We'll hold them here, sir.
JAY
You've got it wrong, let me explain-
88.
GUARD
Shut up! Anything you have to say,
you can say to my superior officer!
And boy does he hate your kind...
A click... click... click... Someone is approaching. Someone
who walks like they mean business.
GUARD (CONT'D)
Lt. Colonel! Here are the
intruders, sir!
Jay cranes to see the Colonel -- he's African American. Jay
grins, relieved --
JAY
Finally, someone I can talk to--
But the Colonel is on him before you can blink, an equal-
opportunity hardass to the extreme:
COLONEL
The only thing we're gonna talk
about is what specific breed of
dumbass you have to be to try to
penetrate my launch site!
He begins patting Jay down. Eyes widen --
COLONEL
Weapon! You are going away for a
long time...
(to his men)
Get them into holding. We'll
interrogate them after the launch.
A beat... and Jay goes for it:
JAY
Sir, before you do that --- my name
is Agent Jay. I appreciate your
position, but I'm from a top-secret
government agency in charge of
protecting the world from the scum
of the universe and right now, on
behalf of the people of Earth, I.:
need to commandeer your rocket so
THEY--
(points to Archanans)
--can board it. Can we count on
your help?
The Colonel stares at him for a beat..
89.
COLONEL
So you want us to stop the most
massive endeavor in American
history, an event being watched by
the entire world, the moment that
will be the culmination of a
challenge put to us by President
John F. Kennedy himself... so a
bunch of Hare Krishnas can take a
joy ride?
JAY
Would it help if I told you I'm
from the future?
COLONEL
Get them out of here!
He motions to the other MPs, who move to roust the group...
But the Lama takes the Colonel by the arm--
COLONEL (CONT'D)
Hey!
--and PULLS HIM INTO HIS AURA.
On THE COLONEL'S face... He sees something POWERFUL
The Lama releases him...
The officer is stunned for a moment. Blinks back into focus
and turns to the other guards --
COLONEL (CONT'D)
You men are no longer needed here.
Report to delta gate.
GUARD
Sir?
COLONEL
Go!
GUARD
Yes, sir...
The Colonel turns to Jay, Kay and the Archanans:
COLONEL
The rest of you, come with me.
The Colonel heads into the building. They follow.
90.
JAY
Things change when you can see the
future, right?
COLONEL
They sure do. This is definitely
about some next-level shit.
The PA crackles:
P.A. (V.0.)
T-minus seven minutes to launch...
MISSION CONTROL STRUCTURE - UNDERGROUND HALLWAY
Mission control is an underground hub with hallway "spokes".
Jay, Kay and the Archanans follow the Colonel down the
hallway towards the main Mission Control center.
MISSION CONTROL
A hive of activity leading up to the launch.. Miles and
miles of white guys in buzzcuts and shortsleeve button-down
shirts. Thick glasses, slide rules, pocket protectors -- a
sea of IBM men.
Everyone smoking, RUSHING AROUND, LAST-MINUTE CHAOS...
Hunkered over computer monitors... reel-to-reel data tapes
spinning. Less computing power than an iPhone, but we put a
man on the moon.
P.A. (V.0.)
T-minus six minutes...
JAY
Attention, everyone! We've got a
change in plans!
Everyone's consumed with the launch and wearing headsets --
they ignore him -- he keeps trying --
JAY (CONT'D)
Hey! Attention over here! I need
to talk to the man who can re-
program this rocket!
Still nothing --
JAY (CONT'D)
Can anyone hear me? Hey! You in
the glasses!
91.
25 people in identical giant black plastic glasses turn.
COLONEL (O.S.)
Agent Jay! Over here!
They see the Colonel with an Engineer at a workstation.
COLONEL (CONT'D)
This is your man.
The guys approach the Engineer --
ENGINEER
You see this card? The rocket's
flight path is all on cards just
like this one. Right here --
He indicates a long metal rack, like a mail-sorting machine,
that holds many 1000s of cards and feeds them into a
processor.
An Archanan approaches and BLOWS ON THE CARDS -- it hits the
cards like a mini-whirlwind. The cards spiral everywhere
like bats pouring out of a cave -- chads fly off -- they're
magically re-programmed! And fly back into the rack.
The engineers are STUNNED. And then PANIC:
ENGINEER (CONT'D)
The trajectory has been altered!
A BIG LOW-TECH GRAPHIC APPEARS on the BIG LOW-RES MONITOR:
TRAJECTORY CHANGE.
ENGINEER (CONT'D)
Abort launch! Abort launch!
JAY
Slow down there! Everyone be cool!
ENGINEER
Coolness is an inappropriate
response!
The Engineer flips the SAFETY off a red button marked "ABORT"
ENGINEER (CONT'D)
Aborting in 5...
JAY
No! Stop! Do not abort!
ENGINEER
4...
92.
The Engineer raises his ABORTING HAND -- About to slam it
down in the button!
- KAY
This might help.
Kay reaches into his jacket, takes out WHAT APPEARS TO BE A
NEURALIZER
JAY
What's that? You been holding out
on me?
KAY
Little something I've been working
on. Glasses if you've got 'em.
Jay and Kay put on their glasses...
ENGINEER
2.
Jay and Kay in sunglasses -- for a moment, it's the iconic
look of the posters...
JAY
Ha ha, just like old times...
KAY
Oh, and you might want to get under
a desk.
JAY
Get under a--?
ENGINEER
One!
The engineers hand comes down... but before he can hit the
BUTTON --
Kay hits the trigger --
But instead of a FLASH --
A MILLION PELLETS EXPLODE OUT OF THE NEURALIZER -- bouncing
everywhere, knocking out the engineers.
The pellets KEEP WHIZZING EVERYWHERE THROUGH THE FOLLOWING:
Jay and Kay have to talk over the sounds of people getting
KO'd.
93.
JAY
What the hell was that??
KAY
It's a high-velocity non-lethal
pellet-gun. The boys in the lab
call it the "hiv-nol-pog."
JAY
Catchy.
The Archanans deftly step out of the way -- or the pellets
swerve around them.
EX RUNS IN, flanked by security and/or MiB agents.
EX
It's Kay! There he is! Take him
down! Shoot him if you have to!
EX catches a PELLET TO THE GROIN, crumples.
The pellets settle... quiet...
P.A. (V.0.)
T-minus... Five minutes.
The engineers start COMING TO, dazed, wondering WHAT THE HELL
JUST HAPPENED -- Kay and Jay give them a "neuralizer" cover
STORY:
JAY
(TO CROWD)
What the hell is wrong with you
people? Raquel Welch comes by for
a personal tour of Mission Control
and you faint like a bunch of
schoolgirls!
KAY
What a waste.
ENGINEER
Raquel Welch was here?
JAY
Five minutes to get to the rocket.
And keep your eyes open for Yaz.
They head out.
CUT TO:
94.
ON THE TARMAC
With only a few minutes to go, service trucks CLEAR THE
TARMAC -- dozens of fuel trucks, etc., Driving to get a safe
distance away from the blast.
The all SWERVE OUT OF THE WAY
As one car cuts through them GOING THE OPPOSITE WAY, parting
the waters -- it's a military jeep -- THE COLONEL at the
wheel, Jay, Kay and the rest, barely hanging on.
CUT TO:
ASTRONAUT TRANSPORT -- DRIVING
The apollo astronauts ride across the tarmac towards the
rocket. The only car. Looking up at that rocket.
On NEIL ARMSTRONG, practicing:
NEIL ARMSTRONG
(GRANDIOSE)
That's one little step that I did,
one big step for the rest of you...
Wait, that's not it. Did that
sound weird to you guys?
The driver SLAMS ON THE BRAKES
BUZZ ALDRIN
What in Sam Hill is going on?
Reveal the Jeep, pulled in front of the Astronauts, cutting
them off.
KAY
No disrespect meant, [major]. I'm
a big fan. (Especially of the
haircut.)
JAY
But we've got some bigger fish to
fry. Hand over the flight suits.
They start pulling the astronauts off the truck.
The astronauts protest.
JAY (CONT'D)
Let's go, people. Why don't you
take one giant leap out of there.
95.
They look at Jay and Kay... at the Colonel...
COLONEL
That's right, gentlemen. You need
to listen to them. We're going to
protocol twelve.
The astronauts acquiesce.
BUZZ ALDRIN
I didn't want to get in that death
trap anyways.
NEIL ARMSTRONG
I'm still getting my parade, right?
CUT TO:
The same guards who stopped Jay and Kay are back on duty.
They hear something -- they draw weapons --
And it's Yaz. Still looking like evil incarnate. The guards
take in this unholy picture...
GUARD
WHAT THE--
YAZ
I want in.
The guards look at each other --
GUARD
Should we radio the Colonel?
GUARD (CONT'D)
You wanna get yelled at again?
They wave him by.
GUARD (CONT'D)
Go ahead.
LAUNCH PLATFORM
Kay loads the Archanans into the capsule., Technicians in
clean suits assist.
96.
Jay works like a secret service agent -- scanning for all
possible threats.
Jay checks his stop watch -- Four minutes to go...
Kay works'with the Archanans--
JAY
We good yet, Kay? I don't like
being out here in the open -- too
many ways for Yaz to get to you...
KAY
I'm almost there.
Kay's got them inside, but having problems with the hatch.
KAY (CONT'D)
Hey, tech guys -- get back here and
help me with the door.
TECH
It's called-a hatch.
KAY
Whatever, just get over here.
JAY
Oh, come on -- what's going on?
KAY
This door is complicated.
JAY
Oh, for...
KAY
What? It's an Apollo rocket, not a
Plymouth Valiant, OK? It's
complicated.
Jay goes over to help Kay with the door.
They both fuss and fight over the door.
JAY
Lift it. You have to lift it.
KAY
No, I am lifting it. You have to
hold the lever.
97.
JAY
No, if I hold the lever, the rubber
thingie won't... go in the thing
where the thingie goes...
Kay notices something in the reflection of the hatch glass.
KAY
Jay... Why do you think a highly
trained NASA technician would leave
the back of his suit unzipped?
They exchange a look that parallels the opening scene in the
Chinese restaurant...
JAY
Because it's about to go down.
They turn around, draw weapons on the tech -- it's YAZ!
NOTE TO READER:
Welcome to the good stuff
From here, we launch into a GIANT SET PIECE that will take us
up and around the Apollo Rocket...
As Jay and Kay battle Yaz and Devil Girl in a super-high-
stakes confrontation to protect the Archanans...
We will pay off that YAZ ISAVIRUS, bentonDESTROYINGTHE
EARTH to avenge the deaths ofhis brothers --smallpoxand
bubonic plague.
The launch clock ticks down -- the action moves around pipes
breathing fire, the gigantic scaffolding, liquid oxygen
spewing from the rocket... All on top of a rocket taller than
a 30-story skyscraper.
With T-minus 25 seconds to go, Jay and Kay corner Yaz against
the lunar capsule.
BACK TO SCENE:
Yaz laughs at Jay and Kay.
YAZ
You can't stop me! Nothing on
Earth can stop me!
JAY
Nothing now.
Yaz raises an eyebrow...
98.
Jay draws his NOISY CRICKET -- the gun he brought from the
future.
KAY
What's that?
JAY
Little something I brought with me.
Jay points the gun at Yaz -- but Yaz just LAUGHS --
As the clock ticks down to T-minus 5... 4...
YAZ
Try it! You wouldn't dare! One
false shot and you'll rip space and
time!
JAY
That's a chance I'll have to take.
Jay BLASTS YAZ
Yaz stumbles BACK INTO THE CAPSULE... The hatch SLAMS him in!
Just as the ROCKET BEGINS LIFTOFF--
HUGE FLAMES - HUGE CLOUDS OF SMOKE THREATEN TO ENGULF JAY AND
KAY -
KAY
Uh oh --
But the Archanans surround them with their aura -- where the
flames and smoke flow harmlessly around them...
And then it's over...
BIG VICTORY MOMENT
As they watch the rocket carry Yaz off...
JAY
We did it, partner. I hope you
remember this when you recruit me --
you won't give me such a hard time.
KAY
You know I will.
JAY
Yeah.
99.
KAY
I guess we'll have to build a
prison on the moon or something.
Jay realizes -- grabs Kay --
JAY
Do a better job this time, OK?
That needs to be one hell of a
prison. You don't want that guy
coming back, or I'm coming back.
Look, once was enough, OK?
Jay turns to The Colonel --
JAY (CONT'D)
Thank you for your help, sir. Hope
we don't get you fired.
COLONEL
Not too worried about that.
JAY
Can I ask you -- what did the Lama
show you in there that made you
help us? Was it the Earth being
destroyed?
COLONEL
No -- it was my son. All grown up.
As a matter of fact, I'm late to
see him -- I promised I'd watch the
launch with him.
JAY
Oh. Thanks. He's a lucky kid.
COLONEL
I'm a lucky dad. Take care.
Jay offers him a handshake. The officer takes it -- and
pulls Jay into a hug.
JAY
Okay...
The Colonel leaves. Jay and Kay congratulate each other,
smile over a job well done...
But then they see the Archanans... And realize...
100.
KAY
We're sorry we didn't get you home,
guys. It was the only way to get
rid of Yaz.
JAY
But we'll make sure you're safe
here. And the next rocket out...
LAMA
All is well. You have done well.
JAY
No we didn't. You wanted to go
home...
LAMA
There is what we desire and what
must be... And now our gift to
you...
JAY
Gift? But we didn't get you home.
ARCHANANS
There is the action and there is
the intention. It is the intention
we reward.
LAMA
You did the right thing. And if
humans are capable of such
sacrifice, such friendship...
perhaps we ARE already home.
JAY
So then what's the gift?
LAMA
You already have it.
Jay looks at pong.
JAY
This? Pong?
LAMA
Yes. PONG. The Pan-Galactic
Ordnance Negation Grid. Agent Kay
will use this technology...
JAY
To make the missile defense system.
You use this to save the world.
101.
ARCHANANS
Yes. Don't drop it.
They take the PONG and drape it around Kay's neck
The Archanans leave, chanting...
ARCHANANS (CONT'D)
(CHANTING)
Bip... Bip... Bip...
And it's just Jay and Kay.
Jay looks at Kay wearing the PONG... just like in the case
file picture...
JAY
Hey. My watch stopped.
We see -- a minute to go. Jay looks at the watch. Something
about it bothers him...
KAY
C'mon. Let's go watch that bastard
leave the atmosphere.
JAY
Yeah, I'll catch up with you in a
second.
KAY GETS INTO THE ELEVATOR
Jay hangs back, approaches the Archanans, walks them down the
scaffolding.
JAY
So you guys understand all this
time stuff, right? So is
everything going to be okay now? I
mean, if I saved everything, and
Yaz is really gone, why am I even
here? Shouldn't I not have come in
the first place? And why do I
still have time left on my watch?
UNDERGROUND
The scaffolding leads Jay and the Archanans into the maze of
underground hallways.
Jay walks, looking at his watch, thinking...
102.
,He sees a WALL CLOCK -- 3:59.
JAY
3:59. But Kay didn't get killed
until...
And then the AWFUL REALIZATION --
JAY (CONT'D)
He didn't come yet! Kay, he didn't
come yet!!!
Jay races to find Kay.
WITH KAY
Unaware that his appointment with death is near...
WITH YAZ AND DEVIL GIRL
Racing down a hallway... hunting Kay...
WITH JAY
Running... running... searching... where is Kay?
INTERCUT BETWEEN KAY... YAZ... JAY...
All converging on destiny...
WITH JAY
Running... more frantic now...
And then he sees him!
Kay -- at the end of the hallway!. Backlit by the door to
the outside...
JAY
Kay!
And then Jay sees -- Yazl Already there!
Jay goes for his weapon, but he doesn't have the shot!
Yaz pulls his guns...
103.
Kay turns to see Yaz -- there's no time to react, only to
know HE'S ABOUT TO DIE!
Yaz FIRES!!
But -- THE COLONEL is somehow there instead! He catches the
bullet for Kay -- his body dematerializes.
And it gives Jay the split-second he needs to FIRE ON YAZ AND
KILL HIM, blowing him OUTSIDE -- where he is INCINERATED BY
LIQUID OXYGEN leftover from the launch.
They look at each other -- it's over.
KAY
See? I knew you had my back.
Jay hears footsteps. Looks up and sees the SHADOW OF A TALL
MAN -- REMARKABLY SIMILAR TO JAY'S OWN SILHOUETTE.
As the footsteps approach, the shadow grows smaller,
shrinking to KID SIZE. It's a boy.
KID'S VOICE
Dad? What's going on?
The kid steps into the light -- backlit -- but from the shape
of his head and Jay's reaction, this kid could only be YOUNG
JAY.
JAY
Where there is death, there will
always be death. He saved your
life. He swapped his for yours.
He saved the world.
Kay puts a firm hand on Jay --
KAY
I'll take it from here.
Kay steps away... but turns back.
In a replay of the moment from the first movie, Jay tosses
Kay a modern Neuralizer.
JAY
Leave me some memories this time,
OK?
KAY
Sure, partner. I'll see you
around.
104.
JAY
Yes you will.
Kay turns back to the boy, takes his hand.
Jay watches them from a distance:
Kay takes something off the ground where The Colonel's body
was -- hands it to the son.
KAY
Hey, look -- your Dad wanted you to
have this.
Kay gives the kid a shiny new commemorative Apollo key chain.
Jay looks in his pocket -- the same key chain, scratched and
worn.
YOUNG JAY
Where is he?
KAY
Your daddy had to go -- he's part
of the space program, now. He's
okay, he just had to take a trip up
to the stars, but you'll be just
fine. I'll keep an eye on you...
They are silhouetted by the bright light of the Apollo
launch...
Jay takes out his iPhone and ALL GOES WHITE...
PURE WHITE LIGHT...
And it resolves into...
NEW YORK - BACK TO PRESENT DAY...
Jay comes to in the Apple Store, looks to the sky and
THE MISSILES ARE STILL COMING!!!
JAY
Noo!!!!
And then...
A giant PONG PADDLE rises over the horizon and
PONGS THE MISSILES BACK INTO SPACE
105.
Jay is walking on air -- thrilled to see the deadpan security
guard.
JAY
It's good to see you, man.
He gives him a hug-- gets a "what the hell?" face.
