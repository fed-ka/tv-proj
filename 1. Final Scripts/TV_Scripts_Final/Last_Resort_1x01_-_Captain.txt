CHARACTERS

CAPTAIN MARCUS CHAPLIN (50s) - In command of the Ohio-class 
nuclear missile submarine the U.S.S. Nevada.  A veteran of 
real combat, a leader by nature.  Nerves of steel.  A 
patriot, but will not follow any man blindly. 

XO SAM KENDAL (30s) - Second-in-command of the Nevada.  
Married to Christine, who waits for him back home in 
Maryland.  Moral.  Sees all sides. 

LIEUTENANT GRACE SHEPARD (20s) - New to the sub and to 
command positions.  Grew up as a family friend of Chaplin's 
through her Admiral father.  Gutsy, a battler.

SEAL OFFICER JAMES KING (30s) - Longtime Navy SEAL.  A lethal 
killer.  Ex-wife, ex-children, ex-life.  No ties back home.

SONAR OPERATOR CAMERON PITTS (20s) - Right hand man to Sam.  
Ambitious.  Competent.  Electronic genius.  The eyes and ears 
of the Nevada. 

SEAMAN JOSH BRANNAN (20s) - Detroit city-kid.  A whiz with 
engines from working old cars with his dad since he was 
young.  Social, a bit gullible.  A fiancee back home.

MASTER CHIEF JOSEPH PROSSER (50s) - The rusty nail that holds 
the boat together.  In charge of all the enlisted men.  
Principled.  Believes in duty, honor, and the chain of 
command. 

PILAR CORTEZ (20s) - Unofficial leader of the nine enlisted 
female sailors on the boat.  Tough and salty, has paid her 
dues.  One of the guys. 

SOPHIE GIRARD (30s) - European scientist in charge of the 
NATO listening array on the island of Sainte Marina.  
Brilliant, a good heart.  Empathetic. 

MAYOR JULIAN SERRAT (50s) - Unelected ruler of all things 
underground in the port city, Soubourg.  Cunning, ruthless, a 
dangerous friend, a more dangerous enemy. 

TANI TUMRENJACK (20s) - A native of Soubourg.  A mixture of 
intelligence and naivete.  Inherited a local bar, but has 
ambitions beyond the shores of Sainte Marina.  Daughter of 
elder tribesman.SIDO (11) - A local island boy with boundless enthusiasm, an 
infectious smile and surprising intel.

ADMIRAL ARTHUR SHEPARD (60) - The old warhorse now working in 
the Pentagon.  Friend and mentor to Chaplin.  An excellent 
moral compass to go with the guts of a burglar.  

KYLIE SINCLAIR (mid-late 20s) - A well-educated, charming 
lobbyist for her family's weapons manufacturing company.  
Contacts all over D.C.  Very ambitious.  Looks out for 
herself. 

CHRISTINE KENDAL (30s) - Sam's dutiful wife whose patience 
for his return is growing thin.  She has plans for their 
life.  Plans that need to start soon.1.


ACT ONE

EXT. BAY OF BENGAL - NIGHT

A small inflatable PONTOON BOAT races out to sea, receding 
from the Pakistani coastline.  The sun s last rays angle over 
rolling ocean.  This boat is way too small to be this far out.

EXT. PONTOON BOAT - CONTINUOUS

SIX NAVY SEALS are in the small boat.  Full camo, smudged 
faces.  SEAL JAMES KING, 30s, scans the horizon, as another 
SEAL tears open a gauze pack, presses it down on SEAL BARRY 
HOPPER, two rounds in his chest.  A third SEAL snaps a needle 
 arm.open, jams it into Hopper s

SEAL WARRANT OFFICER GIL LANGSTON, 40s, is on the radio.

LANGSTON
Hospitality, this is Tango Five.  We 
are at the rendezvous.  Over.
(static...)
Hospitality.  This is Tango Five.  
Do you read?

He shares a look with King.  Not good.  The small boat comes 
to a stop in the middle of nowhere.

A beat...  Then the ENORMOUS FORM of the Nuclear Ballistic 
Missile Submarine U.S.S. NEVADA surfaces, directly under the 
small boat!  SEALS leap onto the deck, securing the boat.

INT. NEVADA - CONN

We drop into the brain-center of the sub.  A well-oiled 
machine in the middle of a combat operation.

FIRST OFFICER (XO) SAM KENDAL, 30s, coordinates the operation.  
Knows every sailor, every officer, by name and family history.  
The beating heart of the boat.  

SAM
 not Helm, ready for dive.  We re
going to be here long.
(grabbing a mic)
Master Chief, get those men onboard.

SONAR OPERATOR CAMERON PITTS works his scopes, calls out:

CAMERON
I have multiple contacts.  Five... 
Six... Make that eight... nine.  
Something big outside the lane, 
working on ident.

CAPTAIN MARCUS CHAPLIN, 50s, pulls away from the periscope.  A 
leader by nature, not effort.  Wise eyes, tough skin of a 
veteran of many tours.  Seldom, if ever, raises his voice.2.


MARCUS
Thank you, Sonar.  Gentlemen, we 
have just surfaced in the middle of 
a highway.  Lemme know if anything 
acts pissy.  Lieutenant Shepard, I 
need three good ways outta here.

LIEUTENANT GRACE SHEPARD, mid-20s, looks up from charts.  The 
tight professionalism of someone with something to prove.  
Hair pulled back.  Voice crisp and sure.

GRACE
Aye-aye, sir.  Where to?

The captain looks at her.  Not a look you want to get.

SAM
Just three evasives, Lieutenant.  
We ll worry about where later.

Grace gets to work, burning.  A VOICE crackles over the Comm.

PROSSER (V.O.)
Conn, I m at the hatch.  We got six 
 pretty men coming onboard.  One s
shot up.  Three are in, other two 
are moving the wounded man down.

MARCUS
(into mic, calm)
Get them inside, Jack.  We re 
leaving in sixty seconds.

CAMERON

The crew instinctively holds on as the boat HUMS WITH POWER 
and angles downwards.  Marcus takes in his people, then...3.

They find a soaking wet MASTER CHIEF JACK PROSSER, 50s, with a 
few other soaked CREWMEN.  Beyond them, the SEAL TEAM.

He returns to his guys.  Marcus heads away.  Sam follows.

MARCUS
Nice work.  Clear General Quarters.

EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY

The Nevada glides through the depths.

INT. NEVADA

Sam makes his way through the boat, doing his rounds.  He 
comes across SEAMAN JOSH BRANNAN, 22.  Innocent and guileless.  
Detroit hip-hop plays on a tiny iPod speaker across from a 
black sailor, JONES, 22.

JOSH

of 8-Mile.  Seen the movie?

JONES
XO, permission to shoot Seaman 
Brennan in the head.

SAM
Permission granted.  Josh, we got 
company.  Go feed the seals.

JOSH
Really?  I mean, yes sir!

Josh takes off, too eager.  Sam sees two female crew members 
notice him, try to duck away.

Stern cracks himself up.  Lawrence sees something over his 
shoulder, pointedly turns back to work.

Grace stands in a doorway, no way to know how much she heard.  
The two men tuck tail and vanish, passing by Sam coming the 
other way.  Grace nods to Sam, not wanting any of it to read.

Cortez hands Captain Marcus her Ritchie Valens sunglasses and 
he puts them on.  He stands on his Conn, not participating, 
but enjoying letting the crazy flow.  Sam slips onto the Conn, 
watches, smiling, still emotional.  He looks across the 
madness at his captain whose eyes are hidden by the

 VOICECURRY S
Captain Marcus Chaplin, you are 
relieved of your command under 
section 472 of the naval code.  
Please pass me to your first 
officer.

Shock radiates through the Conn.  A beat.  Marcus and Sam 
STARE at each other.  Marcus holds out the mic.  Sam takes it.

SAM
This is Nevada XO Sam Kendal.

 VOICECURRY S
Lieutenant Commander Kendal.  As of 
this moment, you are advanced to 
Captain of the boat.  We have 
intelligence indicating an imminent 
threat on the homeland.  You have an 
authorized fire order.  Do you not?

SAM
... Affirmative.

Lieutenant Shepard.  Take the firing 
key from Captain Marcus and insert 
it into the firing computer.

Grace hesitates a small beat, then goes to Captain Marcus, 
takes his key from him, unable to meet his eyes.  She slots it 
in with trembling fingers.  Lights go GREEN.  Sam keys a mic.

Marcus moves towards Langston.  James intercepts.  Sam 
intercepts James, backed up by two sailors.  Langston draws 
his weapon, levels it at Marcus.

LANGSTON
No one is firing or not firing a 
weapon until I see the orders!

Serrat looks at Tani a moment, uncomfortable.  Then he steps 
onto the boat.  His men locate a set of crates, start opening 
them.  We glimpse AK-47s, grenades, C-4...

Serrat passes them all by with a perfunctory glance, finds a 
crate with French lettering.  He opens it, gazes down.  

He rises with a small burlap bag, watches his men haul the 
other crates up towards the truck waiting on the street.

SERRAT
Can I ask you a question, Tani?  Do 
you really believe that anyone on 
this earth ever got anywhere without 
asking another person for help?  
Doesn t happen.  That s just how the 
world is.  So why are you so scared 
to take the help I offer you?  What 
do you think is going to happen?  

TANI

He finally looks over at her.  Gaze lingers.

SERRAT
Give it a try sometime then.

He leaves.  Cases of cold milk are stacked next to her.

That velocity out of the gate.  
Regulus, for sure.

Up on the big board, the track of the missile that almost hit 
the Nevada is highlighted.

SOPHIE
It was a Regulus cruise.  You say 
 not conducting any drills, you re
that everything s normal, yet 
missiles are being fired just south 
of the two most unstable nuclear 
armed nations in the world, which

shooting back at you... Understood.

Sam SLAMS the pressure door closed behind him, spins the

of war, currently in the midst of a father s worst nightmare.

He moves quickly as his attractive and tightly-wound executive 
assistant ABIGAIL relays information to him...

KYLIE (O.S.)

The Admiral looks over, surprised to be addressed by this 
young woman in a power suit.  Immediately, five of the

your... toy?

KYLIE

This hits the Admiral like a shot.  He STOPS, TURNS.

ADMIRAL SHEPARD
What?

ON Kylie.  She hates herself for what she s about to do.  But 
she s used to that.  She takes a few steps back.  The Admiral 
motions his people to stay, closes on her alone.

ADMIRAL SHEPARD (CONT D)
Talk.

KYLIE
It took me a year to get my system 
 not waiting on the Nevada.  I m

A FISHING BOAT bobbing on the ocean is literally PUSHED ASIDE

knocking these boats away as if it was swatting flies.

ON SHORE

Serrat walks towards his car when he hears the noise.  He 
looks out at the surf, sees the monstrous submarine plowing 
towards shore.  He stares, disbelieving.

Other locals, including 10-year-old SIDO, precocious and  
always smiling, watch in awe.

Suddenly, the hatch is open and two dozen ARMED SEAMEN make 
their way to the dock and run into the city.  

ARMED SEAMEN

Serrat watches stunned, as two seamen with submachine guns 
BRUSH right past him, half spinning him around.41.

you little bitch, Lieutenant,   It s 
to you.

She stands her ground, earns her respect.  Prosser and 
Lawrence exit, revealing through a half open curtain on the 
other side of the room, Hopper in a hospital bed.  He seems to 
be staring right at Grace, his eyes almost pleading with her.

MARCUS (V.O.)
... From our submarine, we have 
watched as the fabric of trust 
between the government and its 
people has been torn.  And when this 
boat dared to question why a nation 
without the capability to directly 
harm the homeland was to be 
destroyed...  elements of that 
government tried to kill the 150 
volunteer sailors on my boat.
(beat)
And then, these same elements 
continued on their course.  A first 
strike, unprovoked.  Perhaps 
millions dead.  We have all borne 
witness.

Grace approaches Hopper when -- A SEAL TEAMMATE appears from 
the other side of the curtain.  He sees Grace, CLOSES the 
curtain, keeping her out.

Serrat pulls up in his Deville.  A gorgeous residence in the 
hills, view of the ocean, but a fortress.  ARMED GUARDS inside 
and out.  German Shepherds on leashes.  Three GORGEOUS WOMEN 
in bikinis lounge by the pool.56.


 DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS - SUNSETINT. SERRAT S

A table is set for a meal for one.  Serrat arrives and sits at

of Sainte Marina.  From this 
facility, we can see the movements

Serrat looks up across the table to REVEAL --

JOSH and CORTEZ, seated across from Serrat, handcuffed and 
blindfolded.  Beaten and only semi-conscious.  Scared for 
their lives.  Serrat smiles at his new toys.

Marcus wraps up his speech as Sam, Sophie, Cameron, Franka, 
Nigel and others watch.

MARCUS
As for myself, and the men and women 
of the U.S.S. Nevada, we love our 
country.  We would gladly die for 
what it represents.

But we do not recognize or obey a

shifts back to a stern professionalism.  Marcus approaches Sam 
and Sophie.  Gives Sam a look as if to ask,  Well? 

SAM

Marcus nods somberly, claps him on the shoulder, moves off.

Sam nods, moves off after Marcus.  Sophie stands there, 
staring at the room that was once hers, filled with strangers.

The Admiral smiles, moves to a shelf.  Pictures of Kylie with

EXT. EARLY WARNING STATION VERANDA - SUNSET

Sam stands on the railing looking out onto Soubourg as the sun 
sets into the ocean.  The huge shape of the Nevada FLOATS in 
the bay.  The town looks peaceful from this vantage point. 
Marcus appears next to Sam.  Silence for a moment, then --

SAM
Was wondering about Christine, what 
she must be thinking.  I keep 
running it in my head.  Something we 
missed?  Something we should have 
done differently?  Anything?

Sam stares at Marcus, doubt creeping in.

SAM

stay alive long enough to get our 
names cleared and to get home.

A beat.

MARCUS
Maybe this is home now.

As Sam stares at Marcus, the horror of that sinking in --
