  SURA and THE THRACIAN (Spartacus) fall back into bed, both 
  breathing hard -- and smiling the type of smile that only 
    earthshaking sex can elicit.

                                        THE THRACIAN
                                  laughs)(
                        That was... vigorous.

                                        SURA
                        You seem the kind of man that could 
                        take it.

                                        THE THRACIAN
                        I am rather rugged...

  She laughs as he kisses her, his hands exploring, gearing up 
  for Round Two. She responds, then suddenly breaks off and 
  slips out of bed.

                                        SURA
                        The hour is late. Father will be 
                        worried.

                                        THE THRACIAN
                      As well he should be...

  He reaches for her, trying to pull her back to bed. She 
  laughs, moving out of reach to pull on her clothes.

                                        SURA
                        I have to go.

                                        THE THRACIAN
                      If you do, my heart will break.

  She pauses, considering.

                                        SURA
                        Ask me to stay.

                                        THE THRACIAN
                        Stay.

                                        SURA
                        Ask me. By my name.

  The Thracian hesitates. He obviously doesn t know it. Sura 
  laughs, far from angry.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    2.

  The Thracian grins, caught.

                                          SURA(cont'd)
                        Sura. My name is Sura.

                                        THE THRACIAN
                        Sura.

  He likes the feel of that on his tongue.

                                        THE THRACIAN(cont'd)
                      As beautiful as the woman herself.

                        Every woman knows who you are. And 
                      to avoid you.

                        That bad, am I?

                                        SURA
                        The worst.

                                        THE THRACIAN
                                  frowns)(
                        Then why lay with a man of such ill 
                        reputation?

                                        SURA
                        Because the gods led me to your 
                        bed.

  The Thracian laughs.

                                        THE THRACIAN
                        The gods?

                                        SURA
                        They come to me.  In my dreams.  
                        They showed me the man you could 
                        become.

  Spartacus takes that in with a wry grin.

                                        THE THRACIAN
                        Could?

                                        SURA
                      If set upon the proper path.

                        And what else did the gods tell you 
                        about my future?

  She pauses at the flap to his hut. Radiant in the light, a 
  soft, confident smile bending her lips.

                                        SURA
                        That you will never love another 
                        woman.

  She slips out into the night. OFF THE THRACIAN, his own 
  smile taking hold...



  TIGHT ON SURA S LIFELESS FACE as a hand gently brushes a 
  stray lock of hair aside. POP WIDE to reveal

  SPARTACUS,

  grief stricken as he prepares Sura s body for the pyre. He 
  pulls out the PURPLE BINDING, kisses it, then places it in 
  her hands folded across her chest. He pulls a WHITE SHROUD 
  over her body, WIPING US TO --



  CLOSE ON A POOL as a steady stream of water fills it. 
    Bloodstained hands dip into it. ADJUST to find Spartacus, 
  alone, mechanically washing his wife s blood from his hands.

                                        BATIATUS (O.S.)
                        The heart weighs heavy.

  Spartacus looks up to find Batiatus has entered.

                                        BATIATUS
                      So much hope in reunion. To come to 
                        such bitter end...

                                          SPARTACUS
                        How is it so?

                                        BATIATUS

                        The fault lies with me.

  Spartacus stares at him in surprise. But instead of 
  confessing, Batiatus spins.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        The road traveled from Neapolis is 
                        known to be treacherous. I should 
                        have doubled the guards. Tripled 
                        them. I should have delayed

                        him along as well. I pray the gods 
                        forgive my error.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        No.

  Anger flares in Spartacus  eyes. Batiatus tenses -- but 
  Spartacus turns away.

                                          SPARTACUS(cont'd)
                        There is nothing for you to pray 
                        for. You kept your word. The fault 
                        lies with the men who took her 
                        life. And with Claudius Glaber, who 
                        condemned her to slavery.

                                        BATIATUS
                        There is nothing to be done to 
                        change what has passed. We must 
                        look towards the future. You are 
                        the Bringer of Rain. The Slayer of 
                        Death. Together we will etch the 
                        name Spartacus into the pillars of 
                        history.

                                          SPARTACUS
                                  soft)(
                        Spartacus. That is not what she 
                        called me. It is not my name.

                                        BATIATUS
                                  a beat)(
                      It is now.

  Batiatus turns and exits. OFF Spartacus as he sits by the 
  bath, empty and truly alone...



  COINS spill across Batiatus  desk. ADJUST to find AULUS, the 
  driver of Sura s cart, as he scoops them up.

                                        AULUS
                        Nearly a year you have me search 
                        for the Thracian woman. Why have me 
                        end her life short of the mark?

  He looks up at Batiatus.

                                        BATIATUS
                      An unfortunate necessity.

                      If other  necessities  arise, 
                        consider me your man.

  He bows slightly before exiting. Lucretia watches him go, 
  concerned.

                        A large expense, to have her 
                        delivered all but dead. You could 
                        just as easily have told Spartacus 
                        she had perished abroad.

  Batiatus pours two cups of wine.

                                        BATIATUS
                        She was his life. The heart beating 
                        beneath his chest. No. Such a man 
                        would not believe her gone, unless 
                        his own eyes told him it was so. It 
                        was the only course.

                        I would keep such blood from your 
                        hands, as I have said.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        They hold yours. Are they not 
                        stained by the touch?

                                        BATIATUS
                        There has been too much death of 
                        late. I would turn towards more 
                        respectable ventures. With his wife 
                        removed from thought, I will mold 
                        Spartacus into a gladiator the 
                        likes of which the world has never 
                        seen. He has already defeated 
                        Theokoles. Imagine what he will 
                        accomplish once his mind has been 
                        focused on nothing but victory.

                        Perhaps to the very steps of the 
                        senate itself...

  OFF Batiatus, dreaming of such a day...



  TIGHT ON CRIXUS. Unconscious, tormented by fever. POP WIDE 
  to reveal Doctore looming over him. He casts a concerned 
  look to the MEDICUS, who mixes herbs into a paste.

  The Medicus applies the paste to Crixus  wounds. Doctore 
  lingers for a moment, turns to leave.



  Doctore moves down the corridor. Pietros falls in step.

                      He intended your freedom as well?

                                          PIETROS
                        That was his purpose in speaking 
                        with Dominus. Ashur said the price 
                        was too high for us both.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Ashur?

                                          PIETROS
                      He helped negotiate the sum.

                        Would it be all right if I kept 
                        them? The birds?

                                          DOCTORE
                      It would not cause notice.

  Pietros forces a sad smile, turns and disappears down the 
  corridor. OFF Doctore, watching him go...



  TIGHT ON A PIGEON in a cage being fed bits of stale bread. 
  POP WIDE to reveal Pietros kneeling by the cage, tears 
  filling his eyes. A SOUND pulls his attention to the 
  doorway. GNAEUS

  looms there. Pietros eyes him with fear. Gnaeus grins with 
  lust. He moves in, his sweaty body WIPING US TO --



  Spartacus sits in his cell, NUMERIUS  THRACIAN KNIFE (from 
  106) in his hand. A beat as he numbly considers the blade.

                                        VOICE (O.S.)
                        That is unwise.

  Spartacus looks up to find Varro in the doorway.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    9.

                        it...

                                          SPARTACUS
                        What could they do to me, that 
                        hasn t already been done?

  Varro has no response. A beat.

                                          SPARTACUS(cont'd)
                        I never should have left her.

                                        VARRO
                        You did not leave her. She was 
                        taken from you.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Before Glaber and the Romans. 
                        Before I went to war. She asked me 
                        not to go. Instead I prattled on 
                        about blood and honor.

                                        VARRO
                        You did what you thought was right. 
                      To protect her.

  Spartacus barely hears him, lost in his own grief.

                                          VARRO(cont'd)
                                  re: knife)(
                        You should toss that over the 
                        cliff. Best to be done with such 
                        thoughts.

  A long beat. Spartacus doesn t look up.

                                          SPARTACUS
                                  soft)(
                        I never should have left her.

  There s nothing Varro can say. OFF the anguished moment...



  The villa is bustling with WORKERS and SLAVES. They hang 
  expensive FABRICS and place new STATUES. An ebullient 
  Batiatus strolls through the chaos with Lucretia.





                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    10.

                        Careful with that! It costs more 
                        than your worth.

                        Our house finally becomes livable 
                        again.

                        They will need to stand in line...

  Naevia hustles in with the Medicus in tow. Lucretia breaks 
  from the kiss, tenses with dread.

                                          LUCRETIA(cont'd)
                        Crixus...?

  OFF Lucretia s concern...



  Crixus, weak and his brow slick with sweat, tries to sit up. 
  He grunts in pain.

                                          MEDICUS
                        I told you to lay still!

  The Medicus rushes over, Batiatus and Lucretia trailing him. 
  Naevia stays a respectful distance back.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Best to heed the advice. For a 
                        while we thought you for the 
                        afterlife.

                        Not all of us.

  Crixus spots Naevia, who lights his soul with a subtle 
  smile. He returns it, making it appear intended for 
  Lucretia.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    11.

                        The injuries are severe. The fact 
                        that he lives is miracle in itself.

  That dampens the mood. Lucretia forces a smile.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        I fear you underestimate the man.

                        crowd will one day again roar the 
                        name Crixus!

  He glances at the Medicus, his eyes revealing concern.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        A word.

  Batiatus moves off into the corridor to consult with the 
  Medicus. Lucretia takes the opportunity to slide in closer 
  to Crixus, whispering in his ear.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      It would be improper for me to 
                        visit you in the ludus. But know my 
                        thoughts are with you.

  She glances at Batiatus and the Medicus to make sure they 
  aren t looking, steals a quick kiss. Naevia tries not to 
  react.

                                          LUCRETIA(cont'd)
                        I will send Naevia often to attend

  He smiles in thanks, catching Naevia s eye. The joy of the 
    unintentional excuse for them to be together barely 
  concealed. Batiatus finishes with the Medicus.

  She exits, Naevia following. OFF Crixus, his smile giving 
  way to the crushing reality of his injuries...



  Batiatus greets MERCATO, the rich patron from ep. 103. 
  Workers and slaves are still working on the villa.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Good Mercato! You must excuse the

                      To the matter then. I secured six 
                      of your men for my games, honoring 
                        the storied history of my family.

  Gnaeus laughs at a table with RHASKOS, HAMILCAR, and a knot

                        Yet.

  Gnaeus brays, pulling Pietros onto his lap as he passes with 
  the water jug, causes him to spill it. Pietros squirms, 
  making Gnaeus laugh even harder.

                                          SPARTACUS(cont'd)
                        Pietros. Bring more water

  The laughter dies out. Gnaeus stares at Spartacus, a  fuck 
  you  glinting in his eye.

                        Now.

  Gnaeus hesitates, releases the boy with a sneer. Pietros 
  exits. Spartacus goes back to his meal, eating without 
  thought or enjoyment.

  Varro s attention is pulled away by Ashur limping up.

  Spartacus glances at Varro. Varro responds delicately, 
  knowing the subject may be painful considering Spartacus  
  recent loss.

                        She did not favor me with one.

  Varro can t conceal his disappointment.

                        She insisted on bringing you 
                        message herself.

  Ashur indicates towards the front gate. Varro s wife 
  AURELIA, a young beauty in her early 20s, stands nervously 
  with a Guard. In her arms is Varro s 2-year-old son JANUS. 
  Varro rushes to them, kissing his wife and swinging his son 
  up into his arms.

                                          ASHUR(cont'd)

                        with joy.

  Ashur hobbles off, not at all touched. Spartacus takes in 
  the reunion, eyes filling with sadness for the family he 
  will never have. He rises to leave, his body WIPING US TO --



  The gate is closed behind Varro and his family. Varro still 
  carries his son, thrilled to hold him in his arms again. 
  Aurelia eyes her surroundings nervously.

  Varro laughs, swinging his son up into the air.

                        Who cares of coin on such a day!

                        You are no longer of Thrace. The 
                        time has come for you to release 
                        your hold upon the past. You are 
                        destined for great and wonderful 
                        things, Spartacus. Embrace the path 
                        the gods have set you upon.

  Spartacus glares, angry and defiant.

                        Dominus --

                        clouded by grief. Pause to clear 
                        it.

  Batiatus signals the Guards. OFF Spartacus weighing the 
  exchange as they move in to return him to the ludus...



  WIDE ON two Guards standing duty at the entrance. CAMERA 
  MOVES PAST and inside to FIND Naevia gently sponging Crixus.

                                        CRIXUS

                        You must rest. And you are less 
                        than pleasing to the nose.

  He chuckles at that, giving her a warm smile.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    23.

                        awaken, I had feared the worst.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Which has come to pass, if 
                        Spartacus is now champion.

                                        CRIXUS
                        A feat not done from my backside.

  Crixus starts to rise, grunts in pain. Naevia quickly 
  maneuvers him back down.

                                        NAEVIA
                        Lay still. You will open your 
                        wounds.

  Crixus reluctantly complies, drained by the simple movement.

                                        CRIXUS
                        I cannot even rise. Yet you promise 
                        former glories.

                        Always the enemy of a gladiator.

  She furtively takes his hand.

                        misfortune.

  Crixus locks eyes with her. These two love each other, want 
  each other, but before things can go any further --

                        I would have yet more prayer, to 
                        speed me upon the sand amongst the

                        Brothers? None visit me. Not even 
                        Barca.

  Doctore shoots Naevia a look. She avoids his gaze.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Have you not told him?

                                        NAEVIA
                        The moment has not arisen.

  Crixus  face darkens, expecting the worst.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Fallen, in the arena?

                                          DOCTORE
                        Far the opposite. He has purchased 
                        his freedom.

  Crixus laughs, stunned.

                                        CRIXUS
                        The Beast of Carthage? What is 
                        Barca if not a gladiator?

  Crixus shakes his head, can t believe what he s hearing.

                                        CRIXUS
                        The thought is foreign. Barca, the 
                        giant fuck, tending goats and 
                        picking vegetables? Pietros by his 
                        side, ever the doting wife?

                                          DOCTORE
                        The news found me also surprised.

  Naevia shifts, visibly worried as Crixus expresses his 
  doubts. Afraid of where this conversation is heading, Naevia 
  lies per Lucretia s instructions.

                                        NAEVIA
                      He did not wish it, but had no

                      He shared words with you?

                        No, but -- I saw his eyes, as he 
                        was escorted through the gates.

  Doctore stares at Naevia, surprised to learn that she saw 
  Barca off.

                                          DOCTORE
                        You were there?

  She nods. Doctore hesitates, turns his attention to Crixus.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        Regain your strength. I would see 
                        you again with sword in hand.

  Doctore exits. Naevia remembers to breathe. Crixus doesn t 
  notice, lost in his own dark musings.

  OFF CRIXUS, stewing at the recent turn of events...



  Spartacus sits with Varro, whose mood is considerably darker 
  after Aurelia s news (which he has not told Spartacus).

                        You are a fool to refuse Batiatus.

                      no kinship with these prisoners. 
                        They are murderers. Rapists. Their

                        Then let another man s blade grant 
                        it.

  Varro stops. He s in no mood for Spartacus  hard-headedness.

                                        VARRO
                        You act as if you have free will in 
                        the matter. You are a gladiator.

                        You are a slave. To cling to a life 
                        beyond these walls is to see your 
                        heart parted from your chest. You 
                        above all others should know this.

  The pain of that flickers across Spartacus  eyes. Varro 
  instantly regrets the statement.

                                          VARRO(cont'd)
                        I do not think before I speak.

  Spartacus moves down the corridor, a ghost in his own body. 
  He passes Pietros moving in the opposite direction, head 
  down. Spartacus glances at him, pauses.

  The boy turns back, revealing

  PURPLE AND BLACK BRUISES

  that tattoo the right side of his face, his eye swollen 
  shut. It s a jarring sight. Spartacus darkens.

                                          PIETROS
                      He promised many things. Yet his 
                        swift departure proves each false.

  Spartacus  guilt for having left Sura still fresh, he speaks 
  more for himself than for Barca.

                        Fate often takes a man far from his 
                        heart. To his regret.

                        Felt more keenly by the one left 
                        behind.

  Pietros moves off, broken and empty.  Spartacus watches him 
  go, lost in his own thoughts of regret.  He turns away, 
  WIPING US TO --                                                                                    28.



  A sumptuous breakfast is spread out. REVEAL Lucretia 
    entertaining ILITHYIA. Naevia hovers, making sure their cups 
  are full.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        Rome is positively aflutter with 
                        news of Theokoles  defeat. No one 
                        believed such a thing was possible.  
                        Especially at the hands of a 
                        Thracian.

  She sips her wine, her hatred for Spartacus beyond 
    concealment.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        The gods truly bless the House of 
                        Batiatus.  We have even been 
                        entertaining thoughts of a patron, 
                      to share in our good fortune.

  The bait is dangled. Ilithyia absently brushes it aside.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        And does your good fortune extend 
                        downward?

  Ilithyia smiles, a twinkle in her eye.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        I do not follow.

                        Has her fertility rite born any 
                        seed?

  Lucretia smiles politely.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        I was unable to conclude the rite 
                        within the allotted time.

                        What of the other man?

  Lucretia shifts uncomfortably. Ilithyia leans in closer, her 
  voice a conspiratorial whisper.

                                          ILITHYIA(cont'd)
                        You still have not told me anything 
                        about him. Is it Solonius? I have 
                        seen the way he looks at you.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        I would rather fuck an eel.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        The thought of his naked cock is 
                        rather distressing. No, a woman as 
                        beautiful as you deserves a man. 
                        Someone of position maybe...?

                                        LUCRETIA
                      He is no one of note.

  Naevia tempers her reaction in the background, not caring 
  for the dismissal of Crixus.

                                        ILITHYIA
                      No one of note... Someone more 
                        physical, perhaps.
                                (shocked and 
                                  titillated)
                        A slave?!

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Your cup is empty.

  She motions to Naevia to fill it.

                                        ILITHYIA
                      It is, isn t it? But not just any 
                        slave, not for you. He would have 
                      to be forged by Jupiter himself...

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Let us move from the subject.

                                        ILITHYIA
                      Of course. To other matters.

  She sips her wine, her wheels turning.  They come to rest on 
  a likely suspect.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    30.

                        How fares Crixus?

  That catches Lucretia by surprise. Ilithyia s grins, having 
  elicited the response she had hoped for.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Crixus?

                        His injuries, suffered against 
                        Theokoles. Is he expected to live?

                                        LUCRETIA
                        His strength returns.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        Joyous news. It would be a great 
                        tragedy for such a man to pass from 
                        this world, would it not?

  She locks eyes with Lucretia. Lucretia smiles, refusing to 
  confirm what Ilithyia has already divined.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      It would.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        Pity he will not take the sand in 
                        good Mercato s games. I long to see 
                        his sword thrust home.

  She can t help but giggle. OFF Lucretia, forcing a polite 
  smile...



  A grotesque stew is ladled into a bowl. WIDEN TO FIND 
  Spartacus being served by the cook (EUCLID). He gives 
  Spartacus an extra portion and a proud grin. Ashur slides in 
  behind him.

  Spartacus heads to a table where Varro sits alone. Ashur 
  grins mirthlessly.

                        What did the shit want of you?

                        Nothing of import. How did you 
                        fare?

  Varro frowns, not understanding.

                                          SPARTACUS(cont'd)
                        Your game of dice and bones.

                        Poorly, as I often have. I will 
                        balance the loss at next chance --

  He's interrupted by a PIGEON fluttering up on the table. 
  Varro shoos it away, pauses as he spots Euclid fending off 
  several more PIGEONS that have descended on his serving 
  table.

                                          VARRO(cont'd)
                      It would seem Pietros has lost 
                        control of his flock.

  PUSH IN ON Spartacus as he eyes the birds, a bad feeling 
  uncoiling in his gut...                                                                                    32.



  A few more PIGEONS scamper out of the way as Spartacus moves 
  through the corridor with grim purpose. Varro follows. 
  Spartacus reaches Barca s cell where even more birds have 
    congregated.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Pietros --

  Spartacus freezes at the entrance to the cell. PIETROS HANGS 
  LIFELESS from a beam in the ceiling. Pigeons flutter. Varro 
  comes up behind Spartacus, frowns at the sight.

                                        VARRO

                        The boy has freed himself.

  Spartacus  eyes fill with rage. He turns, storming off 
  towards the training square.

                        I alone decide who lives! Not you!

  A tense beat. Batiatus composes himself.

  Batiatus exits, motioning to the Guards as he goes.

  TIGHT ON PIETROS, dead, red welts around his neck from where 
  he hung himself. ADJUST to find Naevia standing over him, 
  eyes filled with tears. Crixus looks on from where he lies 
  recovering.

  She exits quickly, seized by emotion as she passes Spartacus 
  being ushered in. Crixus glares at him as the Medicus 
  hustles over to tend the injury.

                        I did. I chose not to end you in 
                        the arena and be done with your 
                        shit. A decision I presently 
                        regret.

  Crixus locks eyes with Spartacus, expecting a fight or harsh 
  words in return. But instead --

  Naevia gently places a pigeon back in its cage. Doctore 
  appears in the doorway behind her.

                        You knew Pietros well?

  She turns, startled.

                        Only in passing.

                        not required of you.

                                        NAEVIA
                        A foolish gesture.

                        Born of a kind heart.

  Naevia smiles at the compliment. Doctore approaches, drawing 
  close as he eyes the pigeon in the cage.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                      It surprises that Barca would claim 
                        freedom, yet leave the things he 
                        loved in captivity.

  Naevia shifts uncomfortably. Doctore picks up on this.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        Did he speak to you of his plans 
                        for life outside the ludus?

                                        NAEVIA
                      We did not exchange words.

                        No.

  Doctore nods, seemingly paying more attention to the bird 
  than the line of questioning.

                                          DOCTORE

  Trapped in a lie, Naevia s not sure how to respond.

                        I do not recall.

  Doctore turns his penetrating gaze to her.

  Naevia moves to exit. Doctore does not let her pass.

                                          DOCTORE

  Doctore sees the absolute panic in her eyes, and steps 
  aside. Naevia hustles out, two Guards waiting in the 
  corridor join her. OFF DOCTORE s rising suspicion...



  Slaves scrape the Gladiators after a hard day s practice. 
  Ashur sits amongst the men, grimacing as he removes his leg 
  brace. He grunts to Varro being oiled up nearby.

                        Remove yourselves.

  The men know not to argue, all heading for the exits. Ashur 
  stands with a grunt. Doctore pins him with a hard glare.

                        regret or impending freedom, I know

  Spartacus stands with Numerius  Thracian dagger in his hand. 
  He considers the blade, his face consumed by grief. He 
  squeezes his eyes shut against it, only to be met with

  FLASHES OF SURA

  love. Her radiant smile now a dagger in his chest.

  SPARTACUS DROPS TO HIS KNEES,

  SLOW PUSH IN on the gleaming blade as it catches the light,

  Spartacus still kneels on the floor, his tears long since

                        Condition? You kiss my cheek only 
                      to finger my ass?! Speak! Before I 
                        carve out your fucking tongue.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I will take to the sands against 
                        the spectre of my countrymen. But I 
                        will face them alone.

  Not what Batiatus expected.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Six to your one? I will not risk 
                        the Champion of Capua to such 
                        absurdity.

                                          SPARTACUS
                      If this is my fate, if this is the 
                        path the gods have truly set me 
                        upon... then they will not see me 
                        fall. Not yet.

                                        BATIATUS
                        And if you are wrong?

                                          SPARTACUS
                                  a beat)(
                        Then I will give your city a great 
                        spectacle of blood... before I join 
                      my wife.

  Batiatus considers Spartacus. Less than a god, yet far more 
  than a man.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The gods have brought you this far. 
                        I believe they are not done with 
                        you yet. Nor am I.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        You will allow me to fight alone?

                                        BATIATUS
                        With a condition of my own. When 
                        you kill the last of these shits 
                        garbed as your countrymen, what 
                        remains of the Thracian inside you 
                        dies with him. You  will embrace 
                        this fate of yours... and  your 
                        destiny as Spartacus, Champion of 
                        Capua.

  PUSH IN on Spartacus, his face set for grim violence as the 
  background MORPHS behind him, TRANSITIONING US TO --



  Spartacus stands at the gate, fully dressed as a Roman 
  General, sans helmet. He carries a sword in each hand.  
  (Spartacus now fights as a Dimachaerus like Theokoles in ep.                                                                                     45.
