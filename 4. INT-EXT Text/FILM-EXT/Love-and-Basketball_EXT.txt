An upper middle-class neighborhood, known as the Black
Beverly Hills.
Big houses, green grass and Caddies in every
other driveway.
The street is quiet, until --
YOUNG VOICE (O.S.)
You wanna be Kareem?
CAMERA REVEALS: QUINCY MCCALL, eleven years old, dribbling a
basketball in front of KELVIN and JAMAL, also eleven.
He
sports a fro, a "Clippers" jersey, and a serious swagger.
QUINCY (CONT'D)
All his big butt do is stand by the
basket.
JAMAL
Shoot, I'll be blocking your stuff.
KELVIN
I'm gonna be like Dr. J.
QUINCY
I'ma be like my Dad.
JAMAL
He ain't a star or nothing.
QUINCY
I don't see none of your sorry daddies in
the NBA.
KELVIN
Hey, look, Q.
Quincy follows Kelvin's eyes, to a beat-up pair of Converse
All-Stars approaching from next door.
Walking in the kicks
is a YOUNG KID in a T-shirt and Tuff-skins, and a LAKERS cap
pulled low.
A moving van is parked in the driveway.
KELVIN (cont'd)
Thought only girls were moving in.
QUINCY
That's what my Moms said.
KELVIN
I hope he can ball.
JAMAL
Bet he's a scrub.
The Kid stops at the edge of Quincy's driveway.
KID
Hey.
QUINCY
Hey.
KID
Can I play?
QUINCY
You nice?
KID
Yeah, I'm nice.
Quincy looks the Kid up and down, then --
QUINCY
You and Kelvin gainst me and Jamal.
Quincy tosses the Kid the ball.
The Kid pulls off the
baseball cap.
Brown hair tumbles down, framing a soft brown
face and bright eyes.
She is MONICA WRIGHT, eleven years
old.
JAMAL
Ah man, he is a girl.
QUINCY
Girls can't play no ball.
MONICA
Ball better than you.
Quincy laughs derisively as Monica walks to the top of the
driveway.
QUINCY
(whispering)
What a dog.
Monica shoots him a glare.
JAMAL
She heard you.
QUINCY
Nuh uh, they could only hear dog
whistles.
Monica starts to dribble.
Jamal whistles as he walks
backwards, guarding her.
She throws up a shot.
IT'S AN
AIRBALL.
Quincy and Jamal crack up.
Kelvin rolls his eyes.
Quincy grabs the rebound and shoots.
Swish.
QUINCY (cont'd)
One, zip.
He rolls the ball to Monica.
She starts dribbling and again,
Jamal just backs up with her.
She passes to Kelvin.
Jamal
and Quincy collapse on him, leaving Monica open under the
basket.
Trapped Kelvin has no choice but to pass it back.
Monica catches the ball and throws up a shot.
It banks off
the backboard...AND DROPS THROUGH THE NET.
The boys look at
her in shock.
Monica tosses the ball back to Quincy.
MONICA
One, up.
QUINCY
Lucky.
Quincy easily dribbles by Kelvin and lays up the ball.
He
throws the ball back to Monica.
QUINCY (cont'd)
Two, one.
Monica dribbles.
Jamal plays her a little tighter.
Monica
bounces the ball through his open legs and lays up the ball.
MONICA
Two, up.
Quincy can't believe it.
Kelvin cracks up.
KELVIN
Aaah, she dogged you.
JAMAL
Shut up.
The game continues, with Quincy and Monica trading baskets
for their teams.
Quincy grows agitated with Jamal, who is
unable to stop her.
The score hits nine, nine.
Quincy stands at the top of the driveway, ball in hand.
QUINCY
Point.
Quincy dribbles through his legs, then pops an outside shot.
The ball bounces on the rim...and rolls off.
Quincy curses as Monica grabs the rebound and clears the
ball.
Jamal moves to guard her, but Quincy shoves him off.
QUINCY (cont'd)
I got her.
Quincy defends.
Monica smiles back at him.
MONICA
Told you I was nice.
I'm going to be
the first girl in the NBA.
QUINCY
I'ma be in the NBA.
You're gonna be my
cheerleader.
Monica suddenly passes to Kelvin, sprints for the basket.
Quincy stumbles, giving her a step.
Kelvin throws it back.
Quincy knows he's beat as Monica goes for the winning lay-up.
In desperation, he swings at her for the hard foul, shoving
her off balance.
THE BALL FLIES FROM HER HAND AS SHE CRASHES TO THE GROUND,
FACE-FIRST.
SHE GRABS HER CHEEK.
BLOOD SLIPS THROUGH HER
FINGERS.
The boys stand frozen.
Quincy stares down at her, his eyes
wide with fear...and regret.
Quincy sits atop his BMX bike in front of Monica's house.
A
basketball is tucked under his arm.
Monica emerges, walking her banana-seater.
She is looking
cute in her yellow dress and braids tied with ribbons.
A
basketball sits in her back basket.
Quincy is taken aback, stares at her.
QUINCY
You wanna be my girl?
Monica blinks in surprise.
She thinks for a moment.
MONICA
What do I have to do?
QUINCY
I guess, you know, we play ball and we
ride to school together.
And if you get
mad at me, I gotta give you flowers.
MONICA
I don't like flowers.
QUINCY
Oh.
MONICA
How bout Twinkies?
My mom won't ever
buy them.
QUINCY
Kay.
MONICA
Okay.
An awkward beat between the new couple.
Finally --
QUINCY
I think we gotta kiss now.
MONICA
For how long?
QUINCY
Five seconds.
The two glance around, then climb off their bikes and walk to
the secluded area between their two houses.
QUINCY (cont'd)
Ready?
Monica nods.
They lean in, eyes wide open, and touch lips.
Quincy counts to five with his fingers.
They pull away,
embarrassed, and walk back to the driveway.
Monica lifts her bike from the ground and climbs on.
QUINCY (cont'd)
Wait.
Cause you're my girl now you
gotta ride my bike.
MONICA
I want to ride my own bike.
QUINCY
My Dad always drives my Mom.
MONICA
So?
QUINCY
(impatient)
So that means I have to ride with you.
Monica doesn't move.
QUINCY (cont'd)
Come on.
MONICA
I don't have to do what you say.
QUINCY
Man, forget you then, stupid.
MONICA
You're stupid.
And your Daddy plays for
the worst team in the NBA.
Quincy's face instantly clouds.
QUINCY
What?
MONICA
(laughs)
Last time they won, Dr. J. was a nurse.
QUINCY
Shut up!
He shoves her, knocking her off her bike.
QUINCY (cont'd)
I don't wanna be your boyfriend, you ugly
dog!
Monica leaps up, her dress now dirty.
She shoves him back.
MONICA
I don't want to be your girlfriend, big
head!
They grapple, then fall to the ground swinging...
FADE TO:

TITLE CARD: "SECOND QUARTER" then "1988"
FELICIA, 17, can't get enough of Quincy's lips.
QUINCY
Yo, Felicia, I gotta get to my game.
She keeps kissing him.
QUINCY (cont'd)
And my mom's about to be home.
FELICIA
So I'm not good enough to meet your mom?
QUINCY
Girl, she knew I had a hottie like you
up inhere, she'd beat the black off me.
FELICIA
(kissing him again)
That's a lot of beating.
She finally lets go, and slides into her car.
Quincy watches
her go with a cocky-ass smile.
Quincy crosses the grass to Monica's window, knocks quietly.
Long beat, then Monica sleepily stumbles to her window,
wearing boxers and a tank top.
She pushes it open and Quincy
pulls himself through...
Quincy and Zeke sweat through a playfully intense game of one-
on-one.
Quincy almost breaks Zeke's ankles with a cross-over dribble,
and leaves him in the dust.
He stops under the basket, waves
for his Dad to come on before laying it up.
Zeke smiles, tells Quincy to bring that shit on again.
Quincy tries his cross-over again and this time Zeke picks
him clean.
Zeke taunts him as he easily backs in on him to the basket.
MONICA
Early night for you, isn't it?
QUINCY
I was about to ask you the same thing,
going out with a college boy and all.
Monica doesn't respond.
QUINCY (cont'd)
So where'd you go after?
MONICA
(beat)
Mulholland Drive.
QUINCY
Figures.
MONICA
So what dead-end street did you and
Shawnee hit?
QUINCY
None of your business.
MONICA
Well, I'm sure she kept her word and left
you satisfied.
QUINCY
That what you think?
Monica shrugs.
QUINCY (cont'd)
Little after you left, I told Shawnee it
was time to go and I drove her ass
straight home.
And after she told me I
was the dumbest brother in the world, I
took off.
MONICA
Why?
QUINCY
Cause I don't just stick my dick in
anything.
Monica takes this in.
MONICA
I was sitting in Jason's ride with him
kissing on me and feeling on me and it
was really bugging me cause I couldn't
remember how many offensive boards I had
in the championship.
And then I guess
she got tired of me sort of accidentally
kneeing him in the balls.
Beat, then Quincy cracks up.
Monica laughs with him.
QUINCY
Four.
MONICA
What?
QUINCY
You had four offensive rebounds.
Monica stares at him, surprised.
She thinks.
MONICA
Hold up for a second.
Monica disappears back inside.
Beat, then she re-appears.
She climbs out her window, drops down.
Quincy looks at her.
She holds out the envelope from USC.
QUINCY
When'd you get this?
MONICA
It was on my bed when I came in.
(then)
Can you just...?
QUINCY
(beat)
You sure?
Monica nods.
Quincy takes the envelope, sits down on the
grass.
Monica sits down beside him.
He tears open the
envelope and pulls out the letter.
Monica stares at him as he reads, trying to see an answer in
his face.
Quincy finally looks up.
Expressionless.
QUINCY (cont'd)
Damn girl...
Monica's face falls.
And then, a slow smile spreads across
Quincy's face.
QUINCY (cont'd)
They want you.
Monica grabs the letter, reads.
Her head just drops as a
tidal wave of relief washes over her.
Quincy smiles.
QUINCY (cont'd)
Congratulations.
Monica looks up, cheesing.
QUINCY (cont'd)
I'm gonna be there, too.
I'm announcing
tomorrow.
MONICA
I knew it.
Monica can't contain her excitement.
Without thinking, she
gives Quincy a kiss.
They pull away, then break into nervous
laughter.
QUINCY
What was that about?
MONICA
I know, right?
But they both want more.
They lean in, kiss deeply.
They
fall back on the grass.
And kiss.
And kiss.
Suddenly, Monica pulls away, sits up.
Quincy follows,
instantly apologetic.
Monica stares at him, then to his
surprise, she reaches over, gives his shirt a small tug with
her finger.
Quincy stares at her, then slowly pulls off his tie.
He
nervously unbuttons his shirt.
He fumbles with the last two
buttons.
Monica slowly pulls down the straps of her dress, self-
conscious.
Quincy can't keep his eyes off her.
He pulls off his pants.
Monica glances down and her eyes
widen.
She looks scared to death.
Quincy smiles softly,
leans in and gently kisses her.
She relaxes.
They lay down.
Quincy reaches into his pants for a condom.
His hands shake
as he puts it on.
They stare at each other as he moves on
top of her.
Quincy pushes inside her.
She flinches back in pain.
Quincy
immediately stops as tears spring to her eyes.
QUINCY
(softly)
You want to stop?
Monica shakes her head.
Quincy pushes inside again.
He
looks down at her with tenderness, moves gently, kisses her
tears...

TITLE CARD: "THIRD QUARTER"
It's cold, it's dark.
It's six a.m.
The team pounds down the track, pushing through a two-mile
run.
Monica and her freshman teammate/roommate SHAYLA, 18,
breathe heavily from the back of the pack.
From the sideline.
COACH MILLER
Let's go, freshmen, you're getting
spanked!
Monica sucks it up, runs faster.
She reaches the middle of
the pack, then runs out of gas.
She drops back to the rear.
COACH MILLER (cont'd)
Monica, I'm putting you on my Wizard of
Oz team.
No brains, no courage and no
heart!
Monica and Quincy walk to class, his arm draped casually
across her shoulders.
Quincy gets looks and smiles.
Monica
just looks exhausted.
MONICA
You finish the reading for E-con?
QUINCY
Yeah.
MONICA
What'd it say?
QUINCY
Basically broke down how I'm gonna make
mad loot in the NBA, me being such a
limited commodity and all.
MONICA
Whatever, big head.
Quincy laughs.
TWO GIRLS pass by, smile.
GIRL #1
Hey, Q-man, you gonna take us to the
Final Four?
QUINCY
We'll see.
GIRL #2
We'll be watching.
The girls continue on.
Monica looks at Quincy.
QUINCY
What?
MONICA
You do see me standing here, right?
QUINCY
I can't be nice to a fan?
MONICA
Fine, Quincy.
QUINCY
I can't help girls coming up to me.
MONICA
I said fine.
Quincy looks at her sulking.
He suddenly pulls her down onto
the nearby lawn, and cradles her.
QUINCY
It's okay, little baby.
MONICA
(struggling)
Quit.
Quincy grips her tighter, rocks her.
Students pass by,
laugh.
QUINCY
Shhh.
Daddy's here.
Monica finally cracks up.
MONICA
You're such a punk.
He gives her a kiss.
QUINCY
All these girls...you're the only one I
know who's for real.
Monica smiles, kisses him back.
MONICA
Always.
Through the windows, we see Quincy enter the house.
He
glances around, then walks to the living room.
He sees his
mom sitting outside by the pool, drink in hand, looking torn
up.
He pulls open the sliding glass door.
Nona jumps, then
sees Quincy.
She quickly puts her drink down.
NONA
You scared me.
QUINCY
Sorry.
You okay?
NONA
I'm fine.
Quincy glances at her half-hidden glass.
QUINCY
Last time I remember you drinking was
when Marvin Gaye died.
No response from Nona.
QUINCY (cont'd)
This about Dad?
NONA
Guess he talked to you.
QUINCY
Don't sweat it, okay.
Sooner or later
the truth'll come out.
NONA
(beat)
Whose truth are you talking about?
QUINCY
Mom, we can't let something like this
mess up the family.
She doesn't respond.
Quincy studies her.
QUINCY (cont'd)
I mean, you believe him, right?
Nona sits silent, humiliated.
QUINCY (cont'd)
Mom?
NONA
Just...leave it alone.
QUINCY
This is just about money, you know that.
NONA
Quincy, please...
QUINCY
I mean, how many times have you told me
yourself to watch out for these ho's?
NONA
Guess I should have been telling your
father.
QUINCY
So you're gonna take the word of some
trick over Pop's?
He wouldn't lie.
Nona grabs an envelope beside her and throws it at him.
Confused, Quincy opens it.
HE PULLS OUT A COUPLE OF PHOTOS:
Zeke outside a party.
IN ONE PHOTO, his arm is around a
young woman.
IN ANOTHER PHOTO, they KISS.
AND YET ANOTHER,
they climb into his car.
QUINCY (cont'd)
What...what's this?
NONA
I hired somebody.
How pathetic is that?
After all his late nights and "meetings"
and I still needed proof.
Quincy just stares at the photos.
NONA (cont'd)
I used to think I was lucky just to be
married to Zeke McCall, but I'm too
tired.
Quincy looks stricken, but he moves to Nona, comforts her as
she cries...
Monica sits with a devastated Quincy, high up in the
bleachers.
In the distance, the clock-tower glows 10:50.
QUINCY
Don't put your hands in your pockets,
hold your head up, always look a man in
the eye, and all the time I'm hanging on
his every word like he's God or
something...
MONICA
I know he messed up, but that doesn't
change what he's been to you.
QUINCY
What has he been to me?
I mean, he
looked me in my face and lied like it was
nothing.
Like it was easy.
(then)
And I'm standing there getting loud on my
mom like she's the one with no sense...
MONICA
She understands.
QUINCY
He even had me wanting to play for the
"Clippers."
Man, how stupid am I.
MONICA
You're not stupid.
QUINCY
I know a lot of brothers dog their wives,
I just never thought my pops would do
some shit like this...
Monica puts her arms around him.
They sit there, quiet.
Monica glances up at the clock tower.
She reacts.
Quincy
notices.
QUINCY (cont'd)
What?
MONICA
Nothing.
(beat)
Why don't we walk to my dorm?
QUINCY
I'm not up for running into anybody.
Let's just kick it here, alright?
MONICA
I...can't.
QUINCY
Why not?
MONICA
Coach has us on eleven o'clock curfew.
If I'm late, I don't suit up.
Quincy looks at her, almost in shock.
QUINCY
Didn't realize you were watching the
clock.
MONICA
I mean, I can stay a few more minutes.
QUINCY
Nah.
Don't sweat it.
MONICA
Quincy...
QUINCY
For real.
I should be alone, anyway.
Monica reluctantly stands.
MONICA
Will you call me when you get in?
Quincy nods.
Monica gives him a kiss.
Then she turns and
crosses away.
The clock tower glows 12:30.
Quincy still sits in the
bleachers.
Alone.
Tears fill his eyes as his world comes
crashing down...
DISSOLVE TO:
Reggie approaches the group.
Gives Quincy a nod.
REGGIE
What's up, dog?
(to Shayla)
Hey, flyness.
SHAYLA
Get off the bra strap, Reggie, you're a
ho.
He laughs, then turns back to Quincy.
REGGIE
Coach is gonna kill us in practice
tomorrow.
Might even pull his lips off
your dick, limp as your game was tonight.
Quincy just looks at him.
QUINCY
That's funny.
Monica leans against Quincy, affectionately.
MONICA
he's just playing, Q...
QUINCY
You think for once we could talk about
something besides basketball?
SHAYLA
Sure.
REGGIE
Whatever's clever.
Silence.
Reggie and Shayla crack up.
Quincy shakes his
head, moves to the keg line.
MONICA
Y'all need to quit.
She starts for Quincy
SIDRA (O.S.)
Monica.
Monica looks over, sees Sidra standing in the doorway.
There
is no escaping this confrontation.
She glances at Quincy,
then crosses over.
Quincy turns, sees her disappear back
inside.
Quincy takes one long drink from his cup.
KERRY, 20, and
spandexed, stands directly in front of him, flirtatiously.
KERRY
Excuse me.
QUINCY
Excuse me.
He steps aside as she tries to work the keg.
Nothing comes
out.
She nods at his cup, smiles.
KERRY
If that's the last beer, you and I are
sharing.
Shayla glances over as Quincy pumps the keg a couple of
times.
Kerry hands him her cup and he starts filling it up.
KERRY (cont'd)
I like watching you play.
Number twenty-
two.
QUINCY
Guess you didn't see the game.
Quincy knows he should blow her off, but he's digging the
attention.
He hands her back her cup.
QUINCY (cont'd)
What's your name?
KERRY
Kerry.
QUINCY
Q.
KERRY
I know.
ANGLE ON
Monica looks over at Quincy and sees him talking to the
hoochie.
The girl looks too damn comfortable.
Monica moves
back outside.
KERRY (cont'd)
I'll see you.
Q-man.
She swishes past Monica.
Shayla "accidentally" bumps her.
Kerry glares.
MONICA
Who was that?
QUINCY
Nobody.
MONICA
Who's nobody?
QUINCY
Look, this party's whack.
You ready to
go?
MONICA
You want to go talk?
QUINCY
Not really.
He leans in, kisses her drunkenly.
She pulls away.
MONICA
We could finish what we were talking
about last night.
Quincy kisses her again.
MONICA (cont'd)
Q...
(pushing him off)
Quincy, quit.
You're drunk.
They fall silent.
QUINCY
You know what, I'm just gonna crash.
MONICA
(agitated)
Fine...Maybe I'll come by later.
QUINCY
Nah.
I have curfew.
He starts to walk away, then stops.
QUINCY (cont'd)
Oh, by the way.
Congratulations.
He goes.
Monica stares after him.
Quincy stands across the street from the houseparty, staring
up at the balcony.
Monica leans against the railing,
laughing with a couple of teammates.
Quincy watches her,
then turns and walks away...
DISSOLVE TO:
SLOW MOTION.
Monica's eyes are on fire as she races an
Oregon player for a loose ball.
Both dive for it, slide
across the floor.
Monica grabs it up, screams for a time-out
as her opponent tries to wrestle away the ball...
Monica walks down the hall to Quincy's suite.
The window is
open.
The sounds of Nintendo are heard.
She walks in
without knocking.
BAM!
Monica slams her car door.
Her face is a mask of anger
and confusion.
Camille exits the house, car keys in hand.
She sees her.
CAMILLE
Monica.
What are you doing here?
MONICA
Didn't know I needed a reason to come
home.
CAMILLE
Don't be defensive.
I'm just surprised
to see you.
MONICA
Dad around?
CAMILLE
He's still at the bank.
Monica glowers.
Camille looks at her.
CAMILLE (cont'd)
Everything okay?
MONICA
(clearly not)
Yeah.
Camille just nods, doesn't bother asking again.
CAMILLE
Well, I'm going to get dinner.
She pulls open her car door.
Beat, then...
CAMILLE (cont'd)
It's just a game.
MONICA
What?
CAMILLE
Whenever you lose, you get this attitude.
But it's just a game.
Monica rolls her eyes, as her mom leaves.
Quincy sits on the wall outside of Monica's dorm, as Monica
slowly makes her way up the walk.
She sees him, stops.
QUINCY
Can we talk?
MONICA
Talk to your new girlfriend.
QUINCY
I just took the ho to Burger King,
alright.
MONICA
Cheap date.
QUINCY
Least she had time for me.
MONICA
So you fucked around to prove a point!
QUINCY
I just said I didn't fuck around.
But
you got your head so far up your ass it
took a cheap date for you to notice me.
MONICA
What, "Q-man", did I forget to kiss your
ass like everybody else?
QUINCY
You forgot to be there.
MONICA
That night you wanted to talk about your
Dad I had a curfew.
What was I supposed
to do?
QUINCY
Stay!
MONICA
If I stayed, I wouldn't be starting!
QUINCY
Least you got your priorities straight.
MONICA
I never asked you to choose.
QUINCY
Never had to.
MONICA
I'm a ballplayer.
If anyone knows what
that means it should be you.
QUINCY
Well, if all you care about is
basketball, why you fucking me?
Go fuck
Dick Vitale.
Monica punches the shit out of Quincy, then pushes past him.
Quincy grabs her arm, stopping her.
QUINCY (cont'd)
Hold up.
I'm sorry, alright.
They stand, silent.
Trying to come down from their anger.
MONICA
How do I know next time you're feeling
neglected or whatever, you're not going
to run around on me?
If we're going to
be together I have to be able to trust
you.
QUINCY
I'm not asking for us to be together.
Monica flinches in shock.
MONICA
What?
QUINCY
I'm going through a lot of shit right
now, more than you have time for.
MONICA
How are you going to tell me what I have
time for?
I mean, whatever I did...we
can fix this.
QUINCY
I don't think so.
MONICA
You don't think so?
QUINCY
Look, I'm entering the draft.
MONICA
You're what?
QUINCY
I decided to go pro.
And who knows where
I'll end up, you know?
Monica's heart is sinking fast.
MONICA
When did you decide all this?
QUINCY
Few days ago.
MONICA
So that's it, just forget about us?
QUINCY
Damnitt, Monica.
This ain't about us
anymore, it's about me.
Monica is crushed.
Beat as, Quincy struggles to stay cold.
QUINCY (cont'd)
But, you know, I'd still like us to be
friends.
MONICA
Friends.
She fights back tears.
Quincy has to look away.
Monica
can't respond.
QUINCY
So...I guess I'll see you around.
MONICA
Uh huh.
Beat, then Quincy turns and walks away.
Monica tries to
fight her tears but her pain, hurt and confusion are too
much.
Finally, she gives in, and the tears fall.

Half-assed

An excited crowd jockeys for position at the front doors.

As Monica heads for the back entrance, a cheer goes up from a

Monica smiles, waves back.
TWO LITTLE GIRLS break from line, run to her.

They giggle, hold out a piece of paper and a pencil.

As Monica signs her autograph, a tall woman carrying a

She is LUISA, Spanish, 33.
LUISA
(thick Spanish accent)
Monica.
What is up?
MONICA
Oye, Luisa.
Monica hands the girls her autograph and they run off.
LUISA
Large game, no?
MONICA
Si.
Large game.
They duck into the arena.
Monica exits her car, after a long day at work.
She wears
very low heels.
But she still stumbles.
She curses, then
hears a laugh.
She looks up - Quincy sits on the grassy hill above her
house.
QUINCY
I remember when your mom had to beat you
into a dress.
Monica smiles.
MONICA
You visiting?
QUINCY
(nods)
Kyra's gone for a couple days.
Figured
I'd keep Mom company.
MONICA
Who's this guy I always see her around?
QUINCY
Darryl.
He's alright, kinda corny.
MONICA
So...how's the knee?
QUINCY
Getting there.
MONICA
Strong enough to get you down the aisle?
QUINCY
Yeah.
Two weeks.
(then)
I didn't get to send you an invitation,
but if you...
MONICA
That's okay.
I'm probably, you know,
busy.
Quincy nods.
Awkward beat.
QUINCY
Can I ask you something?
Monica looks at him.
QUINCY (cont'd)
You never told me why ball isn't fun
anymore.
MONICA
It just isn't.
QUINCY
Because I'm kinda feeling that way, too.
MONICA
You had a rough couple years, that's all.
QUINCY
That a nice way of saying I rode the
bench?
MONICA
And you tore up your knee.
Rehab is
tough.
QUINCY
Nah.
I haven't dribbled a ball in four
and a half months.
Maybe I miss some of
the attention, but besides that...
MONICA
You're serious.
QUINCY
Seems like I needed a ball when I was
trying to be like my pops...or trying to
be better than him.
Now, I kinda think I
need to try something else.
MONICA
Like what?
QUINCY
Maybe go back to school.
MONICA
Wow.
Monica stares at him, seeing a man in the boy she grew up
with.
Quincy looks away, self-conscious.
QUINCY
I mean, Kyra hasn't heard the school
thing yet.
(then)
She'll probably say it's the painkillers
talking.
MONICA
It's a trip, you know?
When you're a
kid, you see the life you want, and it
never crosses your mind that it's not
gonna turn out that way.
QUINCY
So why'd you give up ball?
MONICA
Why do you keep asking me that?
QUINCY
Cause I don't get it.
MONICA
Something was just missing.
QUINCY
What?
Monica is too hurt, too scared to tell him the truth.
MONICA
It doesn't matter, alright.
Just leave
it alone.
QUINCY
Find.
Monica turns, crosses to her house.
She stumbles on her
heels, kicks them off in frustration, and exits inside.
Quincy walks back to his curb.
ANGLE ON
Camille watches from the kitchen window
DISSOLVE TO:
Lena sits next to Camille.
Her one year old son, L.P., sits
on the ground at her feet.
Monica sits quietly nearby,
watching.
CAMILLE
So you're still breast-feeding?
LENA
The doctor said it was okay.
Anyway, I'm
still trying to lose some of this baby
fat.
She quickly looks over at Monica.
LENA (cont'd)
Shut up.
Monica gives her a small smile.
Camille looks down at L.P.
CAMILLE
You might want to put a jacket on him,
it's getting cold.
LENA
He's fine.
CAMILLE
(warning)
Okay.
Lena sighs, rolls her eyes.
She picks up her son.
LENA
Come on, L.P.
Grandma says it's too
cold.
She exits inside.
Camille makes a face.
CAMILLE
God.
"Grandma."
Monica smiles.
And then silence.
There is still so much
distance between them, so many misunderstanding.
Camille
stares at her daughter.
And then...
CAMILLE (cont'd)
You know, I'd probably be a lot more
"prissy" in the situation than you'd
like, but the thing I always admired that
drove me crazy, was the fight you had in
you.
MONICA
What are you talking about?
CAMILLE
When I said Quincy could do better, I was
thinking about you.
Monica stares at her mom.
Camille stands and leaves.
Monica drops down.
She moves to Quincy's window and knocks
quietly.
Beat, then Quincy appears.
Bare-chested and in a
pair of shorts.
He looks at her, then pulls open the window.
QUINCY
(half-asleep)
What's going on?
MONICA
We need to talk.
Quincy just looks at her.
MONICA (cont'd)
Please.
QUINCY
Hold on.
Quincy disappears for a moment, then returns, pulling on a T-
shirt.
He climbs out of his window, drops to the ground.
Quincy looks at her.
MONICA
You asked me what was missing.
QUINCY
What?
MONICA
From basketball.
QUINCY
you woke me up to tell me that?
MONICA
It's not fun for me anymore because
you're missing.
Quincy stares at her.
MONICA (cont'd)
What I'm trying to say is --
QUINCY
I heard enough.
MONICA
What I'm trying to say is, I've loved you
since I was eleven and the shit won't go
away.
QUINCY
We haven't talked since college and now
you wait two weeks before my wedding to
say something like this?
MONICA
I know, I probably should have said it
two weeks ago.
Quincy doesn't even crack a smile.
In fact, he glares.
QUINCY
You haven't changed.
You still think the
sun rises and sets on your ass.
Well,
guess what, it doesn't.
MONICA
Then why are you so upset?
QUINCY
Because you don't pull this on someone
who's about to get married.
MONICA
Better late than never, right?
QUINCY
Wrong.
Quincy starts back toward the window.
MONICA
I'll play you.
QUINCY
What?
MONICA
One game.
One-on-one.
QUINCY
For what?
MONICA
Your heart.
Quincy looks at her in disbelief, then laughs at the
absurdity.
QUINCY
You're out of your mind.
MONICA
So you're gonna bitch up?
QUINCY
What's that supposed to be, psychology?
MONICA
I know why you broke up with me in
college.
And not that what you did
wasn't messed up, but what I did was,
too.
So if you forgive me, I'll forgive
you.
QUINCY
Monica, after that stuff with my dad, I
couldn't trust anybody, okay.
I mean, I
was lost.
So you are forgiven.
But that
was five years ago.
I moved on.
Monica moves past him, reaches through his window.
She drops
back down, holding his basketball.
MONICA
Prove it.
She throws him the ball.
QUINCY
What will this prove?
MONICA
You once said the reason I beat you was
because you wanted me to.
QUINCY
So?
MONICA
So, if I win it's because deep down you
know you're about to make the biggest
mistake of your life, and deep down your
want me to stop you.
QUINCY
And what happens when you lose?
MONICA
If I lose, I'll buy you a wedding
present.
Quincy stares at her.
Monica stands opposite Quincy.
Both are suited up in
basketball gear.
They stare at each other, ready to go to war. Monica tosses
him the ball.
MONICA
Check.
Quincy tosses the ball back.
Monica drives.
Quincy's knee
is maybe at sixty percent and he can't keep up.
She scores
easily.
She walks to the top of the driveway, tosses him the ball.
MONICA (cont'd)
One, zip.
Check.
Quincy rubs his scarred knee, then passes it back.
The game continues.
Monica owns the first five points easily
by exploiting Quincy's injury.
Monica drives for another lay-up.
Quincy suddenly lets go of
his fear, leaps and swats her shot.
He grabs the rebound and lays it up.
He nods intensely, as
he grabs the ball and walks back to the top of the key.
QUINCY
One, five.
Check.
The game continues and now Quincy has the upper-hand, using
his size and strength.
He scores seven straight points.
The score stays close.
It is a sexually-charged battle of
wills -- Quincy pulls off his sweat-soaked shirt.
Their
bodies collide as they wrestle for the ball.
Monica yanks
off her jersey in frustration.
Her ass bumps into his hips
as she backs him in.
Her hands slide across his chest as she
guards him...
Finally, the score hits nine, nine.
Monica slowly walks to
the top of the key.
MONICA
Nine, up.
Point.
She tosses Quincy the ball.
MONICA (cont'd)
Check.
Quincy tosses the ball back, drops low on defense.
Monica
fakes an outside shot and Quincy bites.
Monica drives around
him.
SHE HAS A WIDE-OPEN LAY-UP.
SHE PUTS IT UP..AND IT
ROLLS OFF THE RIM.
Monica can't believe it.
Quincy grabs the loose ball and clears it.
He stares at
Monica as he dribbles in front of her.
She stares back.
He breaks for the basket.
Monica stays with him.
He goes
up.
Monica jumps, desperately tries to block his shot.
Quincy dunks on her, knocking her to the ground.
He lets go
of the rim, and tumbles to the ground also.
GAME OVER.
Silence.
Quincy stares at her.
Monica looks back.
Then:
QUINCY
(pointed)
All's fair in love and basketball, right?
Monica struggles to fight back her tears as she picks herself up.
She slowly walks back toward her house.
And then:
QUINCY (cont'd)
Hey.
Monica slowly stops, turns.
QUINCY (cont'd)
Double or nothing.
Monica stares at him, wonders if she heard right.
Quincy
limps to his feet, picks up the ball and holds it out to her.
Monica slowly walks back to him.
They stare at each other.
No more egos, no more bullshit.
Just love.
In the moonlight, on the blacktop, they kiss...
FADE TO BLACK.
FADE IN:
