                              Episode #11 - "Pick Me Up" 

                                              by 

                                      David J. Schow 

                                                    1.  



      FADE IN:  

      EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY 

      UNDER TITLES (if applicable) a HIGH LONG LONESOME SHOT of a 
        twisty-turny mountain grade.  

      CLOSER:  This so-called "highway" is a two-lane route, 
      rolling, serpentine, hilly and curvy. The kind where an hour 
      drive between stops is normal and natural.  

      BOOM DOWN / PUSH IN until we are kissing-close to:  

      A RATTLESNAKE  

      A Northwestern Diamondback as thick as your arm. On the 
      prowl. Mean devilish face, fixed slit eyes. It is CROSSING 
      the road when we HEAR O.S. the familiar ENGINE NOISE of a 
      long-haul BUS.  

      INT. BUS - DAY - TRAVELING 

      The DRIVER (his oval nametag reads FERGUS) spots the snake 
      in the road ahead. His expression lights as he SPEEDS UP.  

      EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY - CONTINUOUS 

      The bus PASTES the snake dead center, flattening it.  

      INT. BUST - DAY - TRAVELING - RESUMING 

      Fergus is alight with the sadism of a 5 year old.  

                                      FERGUS  
                        Gotcha.  

      EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY 

      LOW ON SQUASHED RATTLESNAKE - A pair of boots enter the 
      shot. Rattlesnake boots. A hand reaches down and peels the 
      snake off the asphalt.  

                                      WALKER S VOICE (O.S.)  
                        You re not done yet. 

      BACK TO THE BUS - IN PROGRESS 

      The horrendous NOISE of the bus throwing a rod contrasts the 
      preternatural SILENCE of this pine-tree wilderness. The bus 
        begrudgingly rumbles to the shoulder and STOPS. Forest 
      QUIET.  


                                                2.  


      INT./ EXT. BUS - DAY 

      The pneumatic door chuffs open and FERGUS steps down, 
      contrite. Still captain of his vessel. Sees SMOKE wafting 
      from the engine.  

                                      FERGUS  
                        Ahh, crap.  
                              (to passengers)  
                        That's all she wrote, folks.  

      Fergus boards the bus and gets on his radio. The PASSENGERS 
      begin to disembark - about seven of them. Last off is 
      STACIA, our principal:  Late 20s, short blonde hair, hiking 
      Docs, silver drop earrings, tough, confident, old enough to 
      know better.  

      Every PASSENGER except Stacia unlimbers a CELLPHONE and 
      wanders about like sages trying to divine water, their arms 
      in the air, trying to find a signal.  

                                      STACIA  
                        Oh, this is special.  

      She ducks back into the bus. To Fergus:  

                                      STACIA (CONT D)  
                        How far are we from Ganderton?  

                                      FERGUS  
                        More than an hour, still.  

                                      STACIA  
                        Is there anything around?  

                                      FERGUS  
                        Just that little Trading Post we 
                        passed about ten miles back. 
                        Guess I should have stopped 
                        there. For bathrooms, snacks, 
                        stretch your legs, you know.  

      She grabs her rucksack out of the bus and slings it. One of 
      the PASSENGERS - DANNY, and early-20s roustabout with a 
      guitar case - notices her. He goes into instant damsel-in-
      distress mode.  

                                      STACIA  
                        What about up ahead?  

                                      FERGUS  
                        A motel off the highway some 
                        twelve, fourteen miles up.  

                                                3.  


                                      STACIA  
                        That ll do.  

                                      DANNY  
                        You're not gonna walk, are you?  
                        Nobody walks.  

                                      STACIA  
                        Yeah. Nobody reads, either.  

                                      DANNY  
                        All alone on the road? Want me 
                        to ride shotgun for you?  

      She sizes him up in a withering instant.  

                                      STACIA  
                        No way.  

      She has a SWITCHBLADE in her hand and cleans her nails with 
      it. Snicks the blade out.  

                                      STACIA (CONT D)  
                        I ve got all the friend I need.  

      Danny fades back to talk to Fergus. As Stacia departs she 
      encounters a woman named BIRDY, from the bus. Birdy saw the 
      knife.  

                                      BIRDY  
                        That bad, huh?  

      Stacia realizes she's busted. Rueful. Almost apologetic.  

                                      STACIA  
                        Can get to be.  

                                      BIRDY  
                        So young and so bitter, hm?  

      Stacia almost leaves it at "whatever."  Hesitates. Turns 
      back to Birdy.  

                                      STACIA  
                        You ever been married?  

                                      BIRDY  
                        Been there, done that.  

                                      STACIA  
                        He ever hit you?  



                                                4.  



                                      BIRDY  
                        Anyone strikes me, only strikes 
                        me once.  
                                (beat)  
                        I see you're still wearing a 
                        ring, though.  

      Stacia is, in fact, still wearing a wedding ring.  

                                      STACIA  

      That's to remind me of my past mistakes. See ya.  

                                      BIRDY  
                                (thoughtful)  
                        You take care, now.  

                                      STACIA  
                        I almost always do.  

      Stacia marches away while the other passengers mill around.  

      ON DANNY  

      Slowly watches Stacia crest the next rise until she's out of 
      sight. Then he turns back to Fergus, still in the bus.  

                                      DANNY  
                        Hey, can't you get Triple A, or 
                        something?  

                                      FERGUS  
                        Yeah, great idea:  I'll just 
                        call a little ole hick tow 
                        truck. That'll work.  

      Slow, growing RUMBLE of a powerful diesel engine as a 
      customized SEMI TRAILER pulls into view behind the bus 
      (opposite direction), then veers parallel.  

      A power window buzzes down.  

      INT. TRUCK - DAY 

      The driver of the Truck is JIM WHEELER - late-40s, balding, 
      a big man with the look of a military vet turned cowboy 
      bearing of a ex-cop or rescue worker, veneered with a seen-
      it-all, done-it-all weariness. Down vest, gimme cap, Cat 
      boots.  




                                                5.  



                                      WHEELER  
                        Looks like you folks had 
                        yourselves a little mishap.  

      EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY 

      Fergus debarks the bus. He LEANS on Wheeler's Truck as 
      though bending the rail at a bar. Wheeler's gaze goes flat - 
      for just a split second.  

                                      FERGUS  
                        I can't get anybody on that 
                        damned radio, and -  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Hey, mind my lacquer there, 
                        buddy.  

      Fergus jerks his hands off the Truck as though shocked.  

      Wheeler's expression seems to shape-shift back toward human. 
      Friendly again.  

                                      WHEELER (CONT D)  
                        Listen, you're in a spot. I ll 
                        take your passengers to the 
                        trading post, if they don't mind 
                        riding in the back.  
                              (louder, to PASSENGERS)  
                        They serve a damn good 
                        breakfast. Great coffee. Phones 
                        that actually work.  

                                      FERGUS  
                        I have to stay with the bus.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Anybody else?  

                                      DANNY  
                        Yeah, that works for me.  

      Danny rushes to retrieve his gear from the bus.  

                                      WHEELER  
                                (whistles through his 
                                teeth)  
                        Anybody else?  Last call.  

      Birdy steps up.  



                                                6.  



                                      BIRDY  
                        Long as you promise you re not 
                        some psycho or something.  

      This breaks a grin from Wheeler, VERY homey.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        I promise, ma'am.  

      Danny lifts Birdy's bag into the back of the Truck. Big, 
      chromed rollbar there, festooned with powerful halogen 
      floods.  

      A YOUNG COUPLE - DEUCE and MARIE, 20s, traveling on a 
      budget, have that air of battling newlyweds about them but 
      they're probably not married yet. They argue it out sotto 
      voce, away from the others, but Wheeler can read them like a 
      book.  

                                      MARIE  
                        We can't just go with some dumb 
                        trucker that shows up outta 
                        nowhere!  What the hell is that?  

                                      DEUCE  
                        Cool it, he'll hear you -  

                                      MARIE  
                        Well, fuck him!  Nobody with 
                        brains hitches rides anymore!  
                        He's gonna grind us up into cat 
                        food or sell me into white 
                        slavery or some goddamned thing.  

                                      DEUCE  
                        Marie, just -  

      Marie OVERRIDES Deuce and shouts at Wheeler, waving 
        disingenuously.  

                                      MARIE  
                        No thanks!  Have a nice day!  
                                (under her breath)  
                        ... probable lunatic.  

                                      DEUCE  
                                (defeated)  
                        Great. Good one.  

      EVERYBODY ELSE from the bus, except FERGUS, has boarded the 
      Semi Trailer.  


                                                7.  


                                      DANNY  
                        Hey, who gets to ride up front?  

                                      WHEELER  
                              (re: Birdy)  
                        Let that pretty lady ride up 
                        here.  

      INT. TRUCK - DAY 

      Birdy boards and this is what she sees:  Immaculate leather, 
      tinted glass, custom appointments. Tiny, expensive police 
      scanners mounted under-dash offer a jumpy, active spray of 
      LED light. A feathered earring hangs from the mirror post. 
      On the visors are geegaws and lapel pins, old jewelry and 
      other decorative knick-knacks, rigorously arranged to avoid 
      clutter. Across the dash, a variety of high-end fuel and 
        acceleration monitors that change color as the Truck speeds 
      or slows according to a five-speed manual shift.  

                                      BIRDY  
                        You sure travel in luxury.  

      Wheeler smiles at her.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        It s my home. Seat belt.  

                                      BIRDY  
                        So what re you carrying in back?  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Just meat.  

                                      BIRDY  
                        They say meat s dangerous 
                        nowadays - with all those growth 
                        hormones, not to mention  mad 
                        cow .  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Oh, mad cow?  

      He moos back at her.  

                                      BIRDY  
                        Didn t you just promise me you 
                        weren t a lunatic?  

                                      WHEELER  
                              (mock serious)  
                        Rest assured, mine s all organic 
                        meat. Kosher too.  

                                                8.  


      EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY 

      Wheeler pulling away without a backward look, leaving Deuce, 
      Marie, and Fergus at the broken-down bus. Fergus shrugs.  

                                      FERGUS  
                        I got a deck of cards.  

      INT. WHEELER'S TRUCK - DAY - TRAVELING 

      Wheeler loves driving and is utterly serious about every 
      move.  

                                      BIRDY  
                        What kinda engine you got in 
                        this thing?  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Four and a quarter cat, eighteen 
                        speed, double locking 
                        differentials-  

                                      BIRDY  
                        Whoa, that's plenty. I don't 
                        need chapter and verse. Wouldn't 
                        understand most of it, anyway. 
                        Love the way you shift.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        I ll bet you know how to drive 
                        stick.  

                                      BIRDY  
                        My preference.  

      As Wheeler SHIFTS smoothly, Birdy notices he is wearing a 
      rather LARGE auto pistol in an upside-down breakaway rig 
      under his left armpit, beneath his vest.  

                                      BIRDY (CONT D)  
                        Say now. I hope this isn t too 
                        personal, but -  

                                      WHEELER  
                                (interposes)  
                        Heh. My gun?  Don't you be 
                        concerned.  

      Wheeler digs into his vest and flops open a BADGE WALLET 
      with police ID.  




                                                9.  



                                      WHEELER (CONT D)  
                        Just a lowly deputy sheriff up 
                        Triple Pines way to pick up a 
                        few extra dollars. 

                                      BIRDY  
                        You sound more like a city 
                        fellow.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Actually I m originally from 
                        Brooklyn, New York. Got too 
                        crowded. Too damn congested. Too 
                        many fucking witnesses.  

                                      BIRDY  
                        Witnesses?  

                                      WHEELER  
                              (ignores her)  
                        So one day I left the wife and 
                        kids and took off driving and 
                        never looked back. Tell me, does 
                        that make me a bad person?  

                                      BIRDY  
                        No worse than anybody else I 
                        guess.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        I needed to hear that.  

                                      BIRDY  
                        You must like driving.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        When I get lonesome I pick 
                        people up, give them a ride, 
                        make conversation. Most often I 
                        let them go.  

                                      BIRDY  
                              (laughs)  
                        Well that s reassuring.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        You re not a bit scared because 
                        you can tell I m normal, right?  

      Birdy seems put at ease, almost ... charmed.  



                                                10.  



                                      BIRDY  
                        Mister, I never met anybody that 
                        was  normal  after you get to 
                        know them.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Are we gonna get to know each 
                        other?  

                                      BIRDY  
                        Honey, I ll let you know.  

      EXT. THE ROAD - DAY 

      As she hikes along - emphasizing Stacia's isolation a BREEZE 
      brings the woods TO LIFE around her - chirping, croaking, 
      things moving through the trees.  

      She shakes her head. With false bravado:  

                                      STACIA  
                        Just eat each other, fellas, 
                        okay? I'm just passing through.  
                              (sotto; to herself)  
                        Unless any of you remembered to 
                        bring some ... toilet paper.  

      EXT. DISABLED BUS - DAY 

      Fergus is indulging in a smoke outside the disabled bus when 
      he spots Walker heading toward him with the slow, deliberate 
      gait of a guy who spends most of his travel time on foot. 
      WALKER has that rumpled college-boy look about him - late 
      20 s, charming in a rough, burry way. He wears half his 
      wardrobe, many shirts, a hooded sweat, an all-weather 
      duster.  

      A lot of things in a lot of pockets. A slouchy cowboy-style 
      hat with a plain band. The rest of his  home  is in his 
      backpack. He would be almost handsome ... but right now his 
      gaze is malignant, his eyes chromium. He almost resembles a 
      reptile himself.  

                                      WALKER  
                        Hey there.  

                                      FERGUS  
                        Hey.  

      Fergus TURNS to meet Walker - REVEALING to CAMERA that his 
      right hand rests on a REVOLVER in a spine holster beneath 
      his driver's jacket.  

                                                11.  


      Walker APPROACHES. The change is uncanny. Now his manner is 
      utterly open and friendly, his smile solicitous.  

                                      WALKER  
                        You wouldn't be headed anywhere 
                        up near Lansdale, would you?  

                                      FERGUS  
                        We ain't headed nowheres, right 
                        this minute.  

                                      WALKER  
                        Break down?  

                                      FERGUS  
                        Yeah. I think the tranny on this 
                        ole bitch picked today to eat 
                        itself and die.  

                                      WALKER  
                        That sucks.  

      INT. BUS - DAY  

      Marie and Deuce have noticed what's going on outside.  

                                      MARIE  
                              (re: Fergus)  
                        Oh, don't talk to him, you 
                        schmuck!  

                                      DEUCE  
                        Marie?  

                                      MARIE  
                        Some guy just strolls in, out of 
                        the nowhere, he could be -  

      Deuce's lips curl and he offers up some unanticipated 
      backbone.  

                                      DEUCE  
                        Honey?  Would it put you out 
                        terribly if for, say, five 
                        minutes, you might -  
                                (harsher)  
                        keep your fucking paranoia to 
                        yourself?  

      Marie mouth STALLS in the open position as she loads fresh 
      invective.  



                                                12.  



                                      DEUCE (CONT D)  
                        Shut. Up.  

      EXT. BUS - RESUMING WALKER AND FERGUS - DAY 

      Walker scans up and down the road. Nobody.  

                                      WALKER  
                        In theory, then, if the bus 
                        worked, you probably would have 
                        given me a ride?  

                                      FERGUS  
                        Sure, amigo. You got the fare, I 
                        got the ride.  

                                      WALKER  
                        That's what I was hoping.  

      Walker SEES Marie's sulking face, through the bus window.  

                                      WALKER (CONT D)  
                        How many here?  

      Fergus jerks his thumb toward the bus.  

                                      FERGUS  
                        Just those two. Everybody else 
                        caught a ride back to that 
                        roadside store.  

                                      WALKER  
                        What, you mean somebody offered 
                        a ride, and you guys didn't take 
                        it?  
                                (beat)  
                        Man, that's against my 
                          principles.  

                                      FERGUS  
                        I m supposed to pick them up 
                        once they get this bus rolling. 
                        If they can. You just gonna hang 
                        around?  

                                      WALKER  
                                (thoughtful)  
                        Maybe for a little bit.  

                                      FERGUS  
                        Smoke?  


                                                13.  


                                      WALKER  
                        I don't.  

      Fergus digs out a smoke for himself and cups his hand over 
      the lighter flame. Fergus LOOKS DOWN and SEES the DEAD SNAKE 
      dangling from Walker's coat.  

                                      FERGUS (CON'T)  
                        What the hell is that -- ?!  

      Walker looks down as though he just noticed it himself.  

                                      WALKER  
                        Oh. This.  

      Walker HEFTS the deceased snake.  

                                      WALKER (CONT D)  
                        Just road kill. You want to 
                        touch it?  

                                      FERGUS  
                        No fucking way.  

                                      WALKER  
                        Most people think snakes are 
                        slimy, right? Don t want to 
                        touch Them. They re not. They re 
                        pretty sturdy.  
                              (grins)  
                        He can t hurt you.  

      Walker pulls out the dead snake, a fist on each end, LIKE A 
      GARROTE.  

                                      WALKER (CONT D)  
                        Unless I help.  

      Walker SLINGS the five-foot snake lengthwise to WRAP Fergus  
      neck. Fergus RECOILS, turning as Walker CATCHES the free end 
      of the snake and before he knows it, Fergus is being 
      STRANGLED.  

      Fergus GASPS his last and SLUMPS.  

      INT. BUS - DAY 

      Marie checks her window again and her expression goes sheet-
      white, because she SEES:  

      Fergus SLUMPS into Walker's grasp as he is strangled by 
      Walker with the snake. Walker OPENS one of the luggage 
      compartment hatches and DUMPS Fergus inside.  

                                                14.  


                                      MARIE  
                              (welling panic)  
                        Deuce ...  

      Deuce has to elbow past Marie to see ... and doesn't believe 
      what he sees.  

                                      DEUCE  
                        What the ... hell ...?!  

      Walker is APPROACHING the front of the bus. The open door.  

      Deuce LUNGES to intercept WALKER.  

      EXT. BUS - DAY - CONTINUOUS 

      Deuce BLOCKS the doorway and STEPS DOWN in time to realize 
      that Walker HAS FERGUS  PISTOL.  

                                      DEUCE  
                        Stop right there.  

                                      WALKER  
                        You stop. Right here.  

      He FIRES. BANG! Deuce catches the slug in the forehead and 
      DIES in a sprawl. Walker STEPS INTO the Bus footwell.  

      INT. BUS - DAY - CONTINUOUS 

                                      MARIE  
                        Go away! What do you want?!  

      Walker indicates the BUS RESTROOM behind Marie.  

                                      WALKER  
                        Need to wash my hands.  

                                      MARIE  
                        Fuck you!  

      Marie PILES TOWARD the back of the bus, hitting the 
      EMERGENCY EXIT there and floundering off into the woods, her 
      cellphone long-gone. Walker shakes his head. SIGHS as though 
      he now must doggedly give chase, or something.  

                                      WALKER  
                          Yeah...fuck me.  






                                                15.  



      EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT 

      Stacia marches grimly along until she hears a strange NOISE 
      O.S. from somewhere around the bend ahead. She FREEZES like 
      a spooked animal. The sound repeats and she zeros-in ON:  

      LONG SHOT - REVERSE ANGLE 

      An ANIMAL in the road. Not dead. In pain. Future roadkill.  

        Muddy/dirty, mortally crippled by a vehicle but still ALIVE 
      and in agony. 

                                      STACIA 
                        Oh my god... 

      WITH STACIA as she nears the animal. First fear. Then 
      revulsion, then apprehension, then finally pity. As if she d 
      found her own pet mangled by a car. 

                                      STACIA (CONT D) 
                        You shouldn t be out here by 
                        yourself. You see what happens?  

      (Of course Stacia is talking more about herself). 

      The animal s only response is to SCREECH again in MORE pain 
      as Stacia almost-but-not-quite works the nerve to TOUCH it.  

      She RECOILS. Looks around for an option. SEES:  

      A ROCK. About the size of Stacia s head. A bad answer to a 
      thorny problem. The conclusion is obvious but for her, 
      picking up that rock is like walking the last mile on Death 
      Row. 

                                      STACIA (CONT D) 
                        If I don t, somebody is going to 
                        eat you. Shit - somebody is 
                        going to eat you anyway...but at 
                        least you won t feel it, right?  

      Stacia returns with the rock. This is hard, but necessary. 
      Hesitant. Regret. Pain. But not a breakdown. More 
      sympathetic than she ever acts toward people. She WALKS 
      INTO:  

      A LOW, DISTORTED UP-ANGLE 

      As though from the ANIMAL S POV. Stacia RAISES the rock 
      above her head. Falters. Raises it again. Perhaps she even 
      SCREAMS in frustration and anger. 

                                                16.  


      She SWINGS the rock DOWN to BLACK OUT FRAME. CRUNCH. The 
      IMPACT kills ALL SOUND for a beat. 

      ON STACIA AS SHE BACKS AWAY. 

                                      STACIA (CONT D) 
                        Sorry... 

      EXT. TRADING POST - DAY - TO ESTABLISH 

      Popular road stop that's probably been there for ninety 
      years. Gas pumps and antiques for sale out front, even an 
      old piano. WHEELER'S TRUCK in the lot.  

      INT. TRADING POST - DAY 

      Most of Wheeler's load (the bus passengers) sit warming up 
      on coffee or making calls from a single pay phone.  

      ROCKO, the market s clerk, is on duty.  

      Wheeler's HANDS place two six-packs of beer, candy, mints, 
      chips, pork rinds, spicy jerky, and a few candy bars.  

      Rocko totes up the haul.  

                                      ROCKO  
                        Sugar addict, huh?  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Anything wrong with liking 
                        sweets?  

                                      ROCKO  
                              (warily)  
                        It was only a joke.  

                                      WHEELER  
                              (dead serious)  
                        That s why I m laughing.  

      Rocko spies Wheeler's big-frame .45 auto, holstered beneath 
      his vest. Rocko's manner curdles.  

                                      WHEELER (CONT D)  
                        Gimme a coupla them spicy beef 
                        jerkys, too.  

      Rocko's gaze is still full up with the gun. He SWALLOWS 
      nervously.  




                                                17.  



                                      WHEELER (CONT D)  
                              (points to cigarettes)  
                        And two packs of them. I m a 
                        nicotine addict too.  

      Wheeler's expression channel-changes. Gruff, yet avuncular. 
      He touches the butt of his gun.  

                                      WHEELER (CONT D)  
                        You got one of these?  

      Flustered, Rocko drops the cigs. Wheeler leans closer over 
      the counter and enunciates:  

                                      WHEELER (CONT D)  
                        Have you got a piece back there?  
                        A gun?  

                                      ROCKO  
                                (stammers; afraid)  
                        No!  I ain't!  I mean, I don't!  

      Wheeler draws the auto and racks the slide. Rocko cringes 
      like he's about to eat lead and see his life flash before 
      his eyes. Wbeeler comes CLOSE, intimate.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Don t be afraid. That s what 
                        this does, it eliminates fear. 
                        It s a scepter of power. You 
                        point it and people...fall down. 
                        Here.  

      Wheeler EJECTS the clip and hands the gun to Rocko.  

                                      WHEELER (CONT D)  
                        Careful, now. Point it at me.  

      Rocko lifts the gun, quaveringly.  

                                      ROCKO  
                          It s...heavy.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        See? Don t you feel more 
                        powerful? More in control? Now 
                        all you need is the will to 
                        kill, my friend.  

      Rocko has the muzzle casually aimed at Wheeler s chest.  



                                                18.  



      Wheeler moves it off-target with one finger. Still with a 
      smile.  

                                      WHEELER (CONT D)  
                        But don t point it at anyone 
                        unless you intend to shoot them, 
                        okay?  

                                      ROCKO  
                                (skittish, fascinated)  
                        Why...?  

                                      WHEELER  
                         Cos I appreciate those rest 
                        stops and convenience stores. 
                        Punks are always trying to knock 
                         em off. I hate that.  
                              (a thought)  
                        Oops, almost forgot.  

      Wheeler gently grabs the gun and racks the slide. A 
      CARTRIDGE bounces onto the counter.  

                                      WHEELER (CONT D)  
                        Left one in the pipe.  

                                      ROCKO  
                        You mean I coulda actually 
                        really, like shot you?  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Guess fate didn t want you to.  

      Wheeler reholsters the gun and shows Rocko the bullet.  

                                      WHEELER (CONT D)  
                        Hollow point. Makes this teeny 
                        hole going in. Coming out, it s 
                        like a big slice of cherry pie.  

      Wheeler GIFTS Rocko with the bullet.  

                                      WHEELER (CONT D)  
                        See, you gotta think things 
                        through before you ever pick up 
                        a firearm.  
                                (beat)  
                        And don t forget about that 
                        jerky.  

      Rocko is still fighting an inner war for composure.  


                                                19.  


                                      ROCKO  
                        Eh ... coming right up.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        You okay?  You look kinda upset.  

                                      ROCKO  
                        Take it back. Okay Mister. I ll 
                        take my chances without it, if 
                        you don t mind.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        You disappoint me.  

      EXT. TRADING POST  - DAY 

      Wheeler EXITS, bag in one arm, chewing on the jerky. Rocko 
      STARES dumbly after him, holding the BULLET like a talisman. 

      Wheeler pauses at an old beat up piano amongst the man s 
      antiques on the patio and noodles out a jazz progression 
      with surprising skill.  

      Birdy comes over to voice her approval.  

                                      BIRDY  
                        You play even better than you 
                        shift. What other surprises have 
                        you got in store for me?  

                                      WHEELER  
                        I recall you were in interested 
                        in what s in the back my truck.  

                                      BIRDY  
                        I bet it s not kosher.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Well, you can come have a look.  

      Wheeler leads her to where the truck is parked - far away 
      from where the other passengers are downing their coffee.  

      CUT TO:  

      RAPID TRACKING SHOT 

      Marie running desperately through the woods - stopping - 
      looking back. No one seems to be following. She catches her 
      breath and runs on.  

      CUT TO:  


                                                20.  


      EXT. REAR OF TRADING POST - DAY 

      Wheeler just locking up the double doors at the rear of the 
      semi trailer.  
                        No sign of Birdy. She s gone.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Bye bye birdy.  

      Danny hurries over and interrupts Wheeler.  

                                      DANNY  
                        Mister, I m kind of worried 
                        about the four on that bus? Like 
                        they never showed up? Like maybe 
                        they re still in trouble back 
                        there?  

                                      WHEELER  
                              (mocking him)  
                        Is everything you say, like, a 
                        question?  

      This derails Danny momentarily. Then he gets it. Oh.  

                                      WHEELER (CONT D)  
                                (dramatically)  
                        So you suspect ... foul play?  

      Danny assumes a wounded look. Wheeler lightens up, still 
      mocking.  

                                      WHEELER (CONT D)  
                        Sorry. Dude.  

                                      DANNY  
                        That lady, Birdy?  She says 
                        you're some kind of cop.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Hm. Some kind. In emergencies. 
                        Have you seen her around? Maybe 
                        she s off powdering her pretty 
                        little nose.  

                                      DANNY  
                        Look, isn t that an emergency. 
                        If they re still out there with 
                        no water, stranded?  





                                                21.  



                                      WHEELER  
                        I guess you speak the truth. I 
                        suppose it ll take ten minutes, 
                        out and back. I bet those 
                        suckers at the bus are ready for 
                        a lift about now. Shit, I got 
                        all day. All night too, as far 
                        as that goes.  

      EXT. FOREST - DAY 

      Walker stalks Marie.  

                                      WALKER  
                        Oh, Marie ...?  Marie ... ?  

      Marie DOESN'T MOVE. Maintains her hide. She grumbles 
      quietly.  

                                      MARIE  
                        Oh, fuck me.  

                                      WALKER  
                        I've got your credit card, 
                        Marie.  
                                (beat, no response)  
                        Somebody might abuse your 
                        personal information ... steal 
                        your identity.  

      He sounds like a chiding chaperone. Like he's having fun 
      doing this. Marie is lost in the forest and stalked by a 
      malefactor. What the hell should she do?  

      INT. WHEELER'S TRUCK - DAY - TRAVELING 

      Danny is looking around in slow amazement at all the stuff 
      inside the cab, as they speed back toward the bus site.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        You wiped your feet, right?  

                                      DANNY  
                        Huh?  Oh - yeah.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Wouldn't want you getting 
                        dogshit on my carpeting. 
                        Expensive.  




                                                22.  



                                      DANNY  
                        There don't seem to be many cops 
                        out here.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        What are you getting at?  

                                      DANNY  
                        Well, I mean, highway patrol, 
                        state troopers, sheriffs, that 
                        kind of thing?  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Out here there's less than one 
                        cruiser for every hundred square 
                        miles. Like I told the lady:  I 
                        usually don't work here. I just 
                        come here to -  

                                      DANNY  
                        Unwind?  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Yeah. That's a good word.  

      EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY 

      Wheeler's Truck blazes past. A HIGHWAY SIGN facing the 
      opposite direction. It's been there for decades and reads:  

      COUNTING SHEEP MOTOR HOTEL 
      EXIT 60-A - 16 MILES  

      EXT. FOREST - DAY  

      MARIE - Exhausted. She stops running. Gets her bearing.  

                                      MARIE  
                        Oh shit, I ve been running in 
                        circles.  

      We RACK to REVEAL Walker, standing patiently BEHIND her. Her 
      fear and her gaze are targeted the wrong way. She SENSES him 
      in time to turn, but not in time to AVOID getting grabbed by 
      the throat and PINNED with savage strength to the nearest 
      tree. Walker is frighteningly strong.  

                                      WALKER  
                        Do me a favor, Marie. Skip the 
                        part about how you'll "do 
                        anything."  


                                                23.  


      Now Marie is in total bugfuck panic mode.  

                                      MARIE  
                        No - don't - wait --!  

      Walker MASHES her larynx with his thumb, reducing her voice 
      to a gurgle.  

                                      WALKER  
                        Fucking tourist.  

      EXT. BUS - DAY 

      The bus running lights still on, idle. Nobody home.  

      Wheeler's Truck pulls up beside it. Same direction as the 
      bust is pointed. Shot from across the road with a panoramic 
      view of the mountains and water.  

      INT. WHEELER'S TRUCK - DAY 

      Danny jumps out.  

                                      DANNY  
                        Where are they?  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Hey - careful, now!  

      EXT. BUS - DAY 

      Danny continuously moving CLOSER to the bus.  

                                      DANNY  
                        Hey!  Where is everybody!?  

      Wheeler dismounts and checks it out.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Maybe that guy from the bus 
                        company showed up with that van 
                        and, y'know, gave 'em a ride.  

                                      DANNY  
                        And they'd just leave the bus 
                        with the lights on and the door 
                        open?  

      Danny charges into the open bus.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Can't fault you there.  


                                                24.  


      Wheeler waits impatiently while Danny looks around. Nothing.  

                                      WHEELER (CONT D)  
                        They're gone. Why don't we be 
                        gone, too?   

      EXT. HIGHWAY - AT MOTEL BILLBOARD - DAY 

      Where we once saw Stacia. Now Walker's boots crunch INTO 
      FRAME.  

      PAN UP to take in Walker who smoothly turns and sticks out 
      his thumb.  

      WALKER'S POV  

      A beat-to-shit VAN. We can already hear the speed metal 
      pounding from the stereo.  

      As the Van stops, the cargo door racks open and pot smoke 
      billows out. Three occupants:  STONEY, the driver, 
        barechested, shaved head, sunglasses, and a great many 
      piercings with thick, dangly ornaments, most notably on his 
      FACE. And LILY, a goth-pale willowsprout with ivory skin.  

                                      STONEY  
                        Climb aboard, lost traveler.  

      Walker shakes his head, smiles to himself, and boards the 
      REAR of the Van through the sliding door. We NOTICE Walker 
      now has the RATTLESNAKE HEAD mounted on the front of his 
      hat.  

      It still has a slight stain of blood on it.  

      INT. VAN - DAY - TRAVELING 

      Lily cranks around to scope Walker. He can see the rings on 
      her nipples as she leans back to offer him an already-open 
      beer.  

                                      LILY  
                        Care for a taste?  

                                      WALKER  
                        Don't mind if I do, ma'am.  

      That cracks Stoney up.  

                                      STONEY  
                        Oh, wow - "ma'am."  



                                                25.  



                                      LILY  
                        Shut up, Stoney; he's just being 
                        polite. Ain't you?  

      Walker offers a modest toast with the can as 
        acknowledgement.  

                                      STONEY  
                        How'd you wind up way the fuck 
                        out in this piss-poor excuse for 
                        the middle of nowhere?  

                                      WALKER  
                        Walked.  

      Lily offers Walker a huge smoldering spliff.  

                                      STONEY  
                        Like, on foot?  Dude.  

                                      LILY  
                        Never mind him. He's Stoney, and 
                        you can call me Lily. Where you 
                        headed?  

                                      WALKER  
                        Thataway.  

      Stoney giggles again.  

                                      STONEY  
                        Totally western. "Thataway."  

      Lily yanks out one tape and roots around for another.  

                                      LILY  
                        Well, you just tell us how far 
                        you want to go.  

                                      WALKER  
                          I generally always go all the 
                        way.  

                                      LILY  
                              (re: Walker's hat)  
                        Nice head.  

      Walker settles crosswise, his back against the port side of 
      the cabin. 




                                                26.  



      Lily squirms out of her seat and straddles Walker to get at 
      the beer cooler, giving him an unobstructed close-up of her 
      crotch. Above her fishnets, beneath her leather skirt - no 
      panties. She takes her time getting back to her seat.  

                                      WALKER  
                        I could've got that for you.  

      When Lily stares at Walker, she looks almost hungry.  

                                      LILY  
                        I know.  

      ON STONEY  

        Surreptitiously slipping on a nasty pair of brass knucks.  

      ANGLE ON WALKER 

      Calmly slipping on a pair of leather gloves.  

      EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY 

      The Van bombs down the road, music blasting. We hear 
      Walker's VOICE:  

                                      WALKER (O.S.)  
                        So are you two in, like, a band?  

      O.S.: Sudden SCUFFLE. Sounds of MEAT hitting MEAT. GASPS.  

      EXT. BUS - DAY (DUSK) 

      HANDS (Wheeler's) lever open the luggage bay to REVEAL the 
      bodies of Fergus and Deuce, stuffed inside, sprawled.  

      Wheeler DRAGS out the limp form of Fergus and seems to SMELL 
      him. To "scent" him.  

      Wheeler's gaze SNAPS toward the treeline. He moves as though 
        laser-targeted, almost breaks into a trot.  

      EXT. FOREST - DAY (DUSK) - (CONTINUOUS) 

      Wheeler bulls through the underbrush. Scanning, searching.  

      Until he SEES:  

      WHEELER'S POV - MARIE  

        Immobilized, tied with barbed wire to a tree, clothes 
      shredded, eyes wide with primal terror.  

                                                27.  


                                      MARIE  
                        Thank God. Please help me.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Tell me who did this. Answer me.  

                                      MARIE  
                              (her throat crushed, she 
                              can barely speak)  
                        He ran away.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Describe him, Goddammit!  

                                      MARIE  
                                (gurgles)  
                        Maybe 25 - cowboy hat, duster.  

      Wheeler starts to walk away. Marie gasps.  

                                      MARIE (CONT D)  
                        You can t just leave me here. 
                        Come back you bastard.  

      Wheeler just leaves her there to die. She s not worth 
      killing because this is not his victim.  

      (We don't make a big deal out of it at this point, but DANNY 
      is nowhere to be seen).  

      EXT. COUNTING SHEEP MOTEL - NIGHT 

      It gradually surges into view as Stacia approaches it, with 
      an expression of having found Paradise. She has walked the 
      day away.  

                                      STACIA  
                        About fucking time.  

      She checks her billfold to see if she s got enough cash to 
      buy herself a room for the night.  

      AS SHE HIKES CLOSER:  

      We see the Counting Sheep is a rickety Bates Motel clone 
      squatting close enough to the highway so we can see the 
      sputtering neon sign:  COUNTING SHEEP "RESTFUL" MOTEL. The 
      dirt lot is half-full with road-punished travel vehicles - 
      dusty autos with luggage carriers and out-of-state plates.  

      EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT 

      The Van speeds away from CAMERA.  

                                                28.  


      TIGHT ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE WINDOW - TRAVELING  

      As the window cranks down and a GLOVED HAND tosses a fistful 
      of litter to the wind.  

      ON THE ROAD  

      As the trinkets rain down and scatter - nipple rings and 
      piercing posts.  

      INT. VAN - NIGHT - TRAVELING 

      Walker is at the wheel removing the gloves. No music.  

      Nobody sits in the passenger seat. Walker glances over his 
      shoulder.  

      IN THE BACK OF THE VAN  

      Stoney is GONE. Lily is tied up, duct-taped. Now there's 
      fear in her eyes, and this pleases Walker, who WINKS at her.  

                                      WALKER  
                        I am so glad you came along. I 
                        was working awhile ago ... had 
                        to interrupt before I could 
                        finish up. So you coming along 
                        like this was really lucky. For 
                        me.  

      WALKER'S POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD  

      As the Van crests a rise, on approach to the Counting Sheep 
      Motor Hotel. His new destination.  

      INT. ROOM 12 - NIGHT 

      Two sagging beds, half-hearted Western chintz, threadbare 
      furniture, viral carpet, and a TV that shows things in 
      Martian colors. Stacia's rucksack is on one bed.  

      INT. ROOM 12 BATHROOM - NIGHT 

      Stacia peels her grimy clothes and regards herself in a 
      scabby mirror. The hot water in the shower stall is already 
      blasting, making steam.  

                                      STACIA  
                        Jesus, that s good.  

      Stacia enjoys the shower with almost blissful relief. Hears 
      a THUMP on the wall from the adjacent bathroom (in Room 11) 
      which we MATCH with:  

                                                29.  


      INT. ROOM 11 BATHROOM - NIGHT 

      WALKER has slammed the medicine cabinet door to REVEAL 
      himself in the mirror:  Shirtless, sweating, a bit manic. 
      Dots of BLOOD on his chest. Mops his face with a towel. He 
      rummages in a paper bag and tears a generic version of a 
      brand-new X-ACTO KNIFE from its blister pak. He tests the 
      tip of the blade with his finger.  

                                      WALKER  
                        Oww.  

      Camera backs into the room carrying Walker.  

      Walker looms over LILY, from the van - naked, gagged, tied 
      spread-eagled on top of a VINYL TARP snugged over the entire 
      bed. The TV is on, masking noise.  

      PRODUCTION NOTE: IN FILMING THIS SEQUENCE, WE WILL MATCH 
      MOVEMENTS OF WALKER AND STACIA IN AND OUT OF INDIVIDUAL 
      BATHROOMS SO THEY ARE IN UNISON. CAMERA MOVEMENTS MATCH 
      EXACTLY.  

      Walker is feeding quarters into the magic fingers apparatus 
      on the bed.  

      Walker leans over the semi-conscious Lily ... and SMILES the 
      most generous, friendly smile we've ever seen.  

      INT. ROOM 12 BATHROOM - NIGHT 

      Still in the shower, Stacia tries readjusting the hot water 
      and the knob comes off in her hand. She can t shut off the 
      hot water and she can t reconnect the knob which came loose.  

                                      STACIA  
                        Piece of shit motel.  

      She hops out of the shower. Steam now fills the small 
      bathroom. She wraps a towel around herself.  

      Camera backs up with her as she hurries into the motel room, 
      sits on the bed, and dials the phone beside it.  

                                      STACIA (CONT D)  
                        Hello? Come on...pick up... The 
                        hot water won t shut and the old 
                        bastard won t pick up. Where the 
                        hell are you?  

      She s growing increasingly frustrated as she slams down the 
      phone and gets to the bathroom and shuts the door on the 
      steam.  

                                                30.  


      EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT 

      Wheeler's Truck STOPS in the middle of the road, where the 
      headlights illuminate a Man s body in a ditch by the 
      roadside.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Still warm.  

      Wheeler scans around with a big baton flashlight before 
      getting out.  

      INT. ROADSIDE DITCH - NIGHT 

      Wheeler leans over the limp, dead form of STONEY, from the 
      Van. A broken bone jutting out of his neck. He is not 
      horrified or repulsed. He just looks at the corpse. Then 
      riffles through Stoney's clothing and comes up with a pack 
      of cigarettes. Wheeler shakes one out and lights it, puffing 
        thoughtfully as he SPEAKS to Stoney's corpse.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Somebody powerful enough to snap 
                        your neck without even working 
                        up a sweat. Could ve hid it but 
                        he had to show off.  

      INT. ROOM 12 - NIGHT - LATER 

      Stacia ASLEEP on the bed, wearing only a T-shirt, the TV 
      droning.  

      O.S. RHYTHMIC THUMPING AND GROANING - coming from Room 11.  

      Stacia WAKES. Groggy. She orients. It sounds like somebody 
      is having noisy SEX next door. She rolls her eyes ... then 
      LISTENS, vaguely amused, until it gets boring.  

      SLOW TRACK THROUGH THE WALL FROM ROOM 12 TO ROOM 11 

      Where Walker is rinsing off maniac sweat and a little blood, 
      humming. He BELCHES rather obnoxiously at his image in the 
      bathroom mirror.  

      The crimsoned X-Acto knife CLATTERS into a pool of blood on 
      the bathroom sink.  

      Walker STROLLS into the room, languorously. Glancing at the 
      TV.  





                                                31.  



                                      WALKER  
                        Told you you d be prettier 
                        without all that makeup. Without 
                        all that attitude, too.  

      He glances at the TV. Porn is playing. Switch it off.  

                                      WALKER (CONT D)  
                        That porn shit embarrasses me. 
                        There s no romance to it. It s 
                        just clinical y know?  

      Lily is flayed, half-butchered, yet STILL ALIVE, her eyes 
      dully tracking her tormentor.  

      Walker inserts a quarter into the magic fingers machine that 
      makes the bed vibrate.  

                                      WALKER (CONT D)  
                        Just meat, stuck into more meat. 
                        Doesn t mean anything. Filling 
                        holes. Hell, you can make a hole 
                          practically anywhere.  

      He RAISES the knife again, suddenly miffed.  

      OVERHEAD SHOT 

      Moving from above Walker across the wall to Stacia s room 
      where he listens.  

      Then across her wall to the next room where it s revealed 
      that he s checked in too.  

      RESUME STACIA IN ROOM 12 

                                      STACIA  
                                (yells through the walls)  
                        Keep it down in there. Shut the 
                        fuck up.  

      She can HEAR Walker s muffled voice raised in anger next 
      door. She shakes her head.  

      ANGLE ON WALKER 

      Walker reacts to her voice.  

                                      WALKER  
                                (yells back)  
                        Real sorry.  


                                                32.  


      Walker is now fascinated by the fact that there s a girl 
      next door. He s lost interest in Lily.  

      BACK TO STACIA 

      She ransacks her jeans for change. Pulls them on. Barefoot.  

      EXT. COUNTING SHEEP MOTEL - NIGHT 

      Typical hotel breezeway with ice and vending machines at one 
      end (near the Office). Stacia s short of change. 

                                      STACIA  
                        Shit. Of course... 

      Walker startles her, appearing and slotting a quarter into 
      the machine. 

                                      WALKER 
                                (intrudes with 25 cents) 
                        No problem. I ve got loads of 
                        quarters.  
                                (beat) 
                        Ma am. 

      Stacia says nothing. She doesn t want to be beholden to 
      anybody. Walker presses the issue. 

                                      WALKER (CONT D)  
                        You re welcome. 

                                      STACIA 
                                (resistent but mindful of 
                                 manners ) 
                          Oh...Uh...thanks. 

                                      WALKER 
                        My pleasure. 

                                      STACIA 
                        You see the manager 
                          around...anywhere? 

                                      WALKER 
                        Grampaw? Probably gettin  his 
                        beauty sleep. With a bottle, 
                        know what I mean? 
                                (beat) 
                        Anything else I could help you 
                        with? I m handy. 




                                                33.  



                                      STACIA 
                              (re: beverage) 
                        This is plenty, thanks. 

                                      WALKER 
                        You hear them two goin  at it? 

                                      STACIA 
                        Oh. God. Did you hear that too? 

                                      WALKER 
                        Sounded like a rodeo. Some 
                        people just ain t got no shame. 

                                      STACIA 
                        They stopped. 

                                      WALKER 
                        Probably wore out. 
                              (thinks about it   is 
                              bemused) 
                        Whew. What a workout. 

                                      STACIA 
                                (still jittery - wants to 
                              escape) 
                        In that case I m going to try to 
                        get some sleep now. 

                                      WALKER 
                                (courtly) 
                        Well. Good night to you, then. 

      Before Stacia can flee, Wheeler appears. 

                                      WHEELER 
                        Excuse me - I don t mean to pry 
                        or anything, but were you by 
                        chance with that bus load of 
                        people? The one that broke down 
                        on the way to Ganderton? 

                                      STACIA 
                                (suspicious) 
                        How would you know that? 

                                      WHEELER 
                        I hauled a bunch of them to the 
                        trading post. How did you get 
                        away? 



                                                34.  



                                      STACIA 
                              (lying) 
                        I hitched a ride. 

                                      WHEELER 
                              (to Walker) 
                        What about you? You hitch-
                        hiking, too? 

                                      WALKER 
                        Not presently, no. 

      Walker indicates to the van. 

                                      WHEELER 
                        Any of you fellow travelers care 
                        for a smoke? 

                                      WALKER 
                        I don t indulge. 

      Stacia just tries to get back to her room, stuck between 
      them. 

                                      WHEELER 
                        Hold on a second. 
                                (indicates the night air) 
                        Savor this quiet. Before it 
                        starts raining. 

      Stacia reluctantly accepts a cigarette. 

                                      WALKER 
                        Rain rinses the air. Clouds 
                        clear, there s tons more stars 
                        to see. It s like a reward, for 
                        staying up late. 

                                      STACIA 
                              (vague, wary) 
                        Uh, yeah. 

                                      WHEELER 
                        Rain plays hell with my truck, 
                        though. 

                                      WALKER 
                        But it can t hurt you. 





                                                35.  



                                      WHEELER 
                        Plenty of other things out here 
                        than can hurt you. The woods are 
                        full of predators. 

                                      STACIA 
                        Right. Listen - thanks guys, but 
                        I ve got to go call my 
                        boyfriend. 

                                      WALKER 
                        I thought you were going to  try 
                        and get some sleep . 

                                      STACIA 
                                (insistent) 
                        He s picking me up tonight. Real 
                        soon. 

      Stacia finally makes it back to her room. Beat as Wheeler 
      and Walker size each other up. 

                                      WHEELER 
                        You made her a bit nervous, I 
                        think. 

                                      WALKER 
                        Maybe it was you. 
                                (beat) 
                        Just a first impression. It 
                        don t mean nothin . 

                                      WHEELER 
                        You have that way with women, am 
                        I right? 

                                      WALKER 
                        They warm up eventually. 
                              (re: Wheeler s truck) 
                        Big truck. What re you hauling? 

                                      WHEELER 
                        Dog food. But I don t have a 
                        full load yet. Soon, though. 
                              (they re done) 
                        Well, I ve gotta hit it pardner. 
                        Nice talking with you. 

      Wheeler exits to his own room. 

      Walker watches him go. After Wheeler s door shuts, he says: 


                                                36.  


                                      WALKER 
                        I ll be seeing you later. I bet. 

      Wheeler holds another quarter up into the light. 

                                      WALKER (CONT D) 
                        I bet you a quarter. 

      INT. ROOM 11 - NIGHT 

      Walker ENTERS and stops before the mirror, suddenly smacking 
      his head.  

                                      WALKER  
                        Oh, I get it!  Trucker Burt out 
                        there, he knows ... but he's 
                        like one of those cheetahs that 
                        chase something and don t kill 
                        it - don t eat it.  

      He is speaking to the INERT CORPSE of Lily, bloodied on the 
      bed.  

                                      WALKER (CONT D)  
                        They play with it. Honey ...?  
                                (beat)  
                        Never mind.  

      Walker stretches, rather pleased with his deduction.  

      INT. ROOM 12 - NIGHT 

      ON STACIA, not-really-watching the cartoons on TV. Feeling 
      anxious. Feeling trapped. Vaguely agitated, like someone who 
      knows they are being spied upon. UNDER the drone of the TV 
      she hears a SKRITCHING noise OS.  

      She damps the TV volume. The NOISE is coming from the 
      bathroom. She sneaks up on the bathroom door. Skritch, 
      skritch ...  

      INT. ROOM 12 BATHROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 

      The shower is still running and the place is full of steam.  

      Stacia, in full-on slasher movie stealth mode. Peeking 
      around the jamb.  

      Above the sound of the water is skritch, skritch, coming 
      from the small, closed bathroom WINDOW.  

      Stacia moves into the bathroom, her switchblade palmed. She 
      hates her own fear.  

                                                37.  


                                      STACIA  
                        God ... dammit ...  

      Her eyes follow the skittering SOUND up and across the 
      ceiling.  

                                      STACIA (CONT D)  
                        Great. We've got party rats.  

      EXT. ROOM 12 BATHROOM - NIGHT 

      As Stacia's SHADOW crosses the bathroom glass, the light 
      changes to REVEAL WALKER, standing back in the shadows 
      behind the motel, having OBSERVED all the foregoing.  

      Walker GRINS, then reaches forward with his switchblade.  

        SKRITCH-SKRITCH, again on the windowsill.  

      EXT. ROOM 13 - NIGHT 

      Wheeler listens at the wall separating him from Stacia.  

      INT. ROOM 12 - NIGHT 

      Stacia sits on the bed. Nervous. Something has triggered all 
      her alarms and she cannot sit still.  

      She looks to the far wall - bordering Walker's room. Then to 
      the opposite wall - bordering Wheeler's room. Reluctantly, 
      she DECIDES.  

                                      STACIA  
                              (a whisper)  
                        Right. Dammit.  

      ... and begins to GATHER up her things.  

      Stacia peeks out through a curtain slit. All clear. OPENS 
      her door silently.  

      INT. ROOM 13 - NIGHT 

      Wheeler lies on his bed in an almost meditative state. His 
      eyes SNAP open at some sound we cannot hear. But he does.  

      He checks the time and rolls out.  

      EXT. ROOM 12 - NIGHT 

      WITH WHEELER as he does not make a single noise. He GENTLY 
      tests Stacia's doorknob. OPEN. He cautiously opens the door.  


                                                38.  


      INT. ROOM 12 - NIGHT 

      TV still on, shower still running, sound down, a shape under 
      the sheets. Wheeler clues in immediately.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Well, I'll be damned.  

      He SWEEPS the sheets aside. Just pillows. No Stacia. Then he 
      SEES the room key, left behind on the dresser. Stacia has 
      flown in the middle of the night.  

      The SKRITCHING sound begins again, OS at the bathroom 
      window.  

      Wheeler, with a hurried sense of mission, checks his watch, 
      then EXITS. HOLD on the empty room.  

      INT. ROOM 12 BATHROOM - NIGHT 

      Full of steam, the CAMERA MOVES from the room to the 
      bathroom window as WALKER pries it up. A ghostly apparition 
      coming through the steam as he climbs through the window.  

      OS SOUND of Wheeler's Truck starting up, revving, backing 
      out.  

      This SPEEDS Walker through the window. He senses his quarry 
      is already lost and when he sees the door to Room 12 
      standing open, that confirms it.  

                                      WALKER  
                                (marveling)  
                        Son of a bitch.  

      EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT 

      Stacia marches along, eager to put the motel far behind her.  

                                      STACIA  
                              (to herself)  
                        I can't believe I took a shower 
                        in that place. Yeek, yeek, 
                        yeek ...  

      She imitates the musical sting from Psycho, making a 
      stabbing motion with one hand.  

                                      STACIA (CON'T) 
                        Real smart.  

      OS sound of Wheeler's Truck, coming over the rise BEHIND 
      her.  

                                                39.  


      As before, Stacia seeks the nearest cover and flattens out.  

      After a beat, the Truck comes grumbling by at walking speed, 
      a door-mounted SEARCHLIGHT sweeping the sides of the road.  

      INT. WHEELER'S TRUCK - NIGHT - TRAVELING 

      As far as Wheeler can tell, the coast is clear. He NODS to 
      himself and begins to accelerate smoothly - checking his 
      watch against the odometer.  

      EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT 

      Stacia watches the Truck from her hide, taillights 
      dwindling.  

      EXT. HIGHWAY - ELSEWHERE - NIGHT 

      LONG SHOT of flashbar lights gradually approaching. No 
      siren. PULL BACK to include Walker, on the hoof now, 
      WATCHING and deciding to fade back. It might be the cops.  

      A van-style AMBULANCE blazes past, headed in the direction 
      Walker came from. After a beat, Walker steps back out onto 
      the road. It's a little like the Tortoise and the Hare, his 
      confidence in his "pursuit" of Stacia.  

      EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT - RESUMING STACIA 

      She looks back over her shoulder, almost as if she can sense 
      Walker back there - somewhere.  

      THE FULL MOON - a long, baleful shot as CLOUDS skirt across 
      it. The distant rumble of THUNDER and oncoming rain.  

      EXT. HIGHWAY - BILLBOARD - NIGHT - LATER 

      Wheeler's Truck is parked in darkness beneath a faded and 
      half-collapsed BILLBOARD for a long-gone roadside 
      attraction, reading (with intentional TYPOS):  

                                  THE HORRIBLE THING!  
                                        WHAT IS IT?!  
                      DARE YOU SEE IT'S SECRET'S REVEALED?!  
                            LANSDALE EXIT ROUTE 245 - 6 MI.  
                              "COLD" SODA - BEER - GIFTS 

      RAINDROPS begin to pellet down on Wheeler's windshield.  

      INT. WHEELER'S TRUCK - NIGHT 

      He eyes the rain with dismay. Checks the time. One hour has 
      elapsed. He pops a can of beer and takes a long, slow pull.  

                                                40.  


      Lights a cigarette. Patient.  

      A LIGHTNING STRIKE illuminates the landscape and reveals the 
      distant form of Stacia, humping over the crest of the last 
      hilltop.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Well, hello.  

      He waits for just the right moment to NAIL Stacia with his 
      high-beams. Bang!  

      EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 

      Stacia freezes in the oncoming rain, surprised by the light.  

      Wheeler debarks the Truck wearing a rain slicker and 
      carrying a powerful flashlight. Friendly:  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Hey, stranger.  

      Stacia claws out her switchblade as Wheeler approaches.  

                                      STACIA  
                        Stay right there!  I've got a 
                        knife!  

      Wheeler SHRUGS.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        I've got a gun. So I win.  

      Wheeler SHINES the light on his own face, haunted-house 
      style.  

                                      WHEELER (CONT D)  
                        It's me. From the motel.  

      Stacia SQUINTS at him. Oh, yeah. She really does have 
      nowhere to run.  

                                      STACIA  
                                (hesitant)  
                        What ... are you doing out here?  

      Still the distance and tension between them, an uneasy 
      stand-off. Wheeler tries another approach:  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Look - here. It's okay. I'm a 
                        cop.  


                                                41.  


      He displays his BADGE WALLET.  

                                      STACIA  
                                (incredulous)  
                        Are you sure?!  

      This bemuses Wheeler. He pretends to ponder it.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Hmm. Yeah.  
                                (beat)  
                        Come on. It's starting to bucket 
                        down. I can give you a lift to 
                        Ganderton; I'm headed that way.  

      It's a lot like coaxing a small animal out of the 
      underbrush.  

                                      WHEELER (CONT D)  
                        Come on. Please. It's for your 
                        own safety, really.  

                                      STACIA  
                        What does that mean?  

      They have drawn ever-closer, closer ...  

                                      WHEELER  
                        It means there are dangerous 
                        people out on this road tonight. 
                        Which is why I'm out here. Can I 
                        please explain this inside, 
                        where it's dry, huh?  

      He unholsters his automatic and offers it.  

                                      WHEELER (CONT D)  
                        Look, see?  You can even hold 
                        the gun.  

      Stacia cracks. She hustles to the Truck, PAST Wheeler, 
      getting there first.  

                                      STACIA  
                        Come on if you're coming!  

      Stacia really has nowhere to run.  

      INT. WHEELER'S TRUCK - (AT BILLBOARD) - NIGHT - RAIN 

      Stacia and Wheeler both board the Truck, soaked. 



                                                42.  



                                      STACIA  
                        Gawdamighty, Hell isn't hot ... 
                        it's wet.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Can't fault you there.  

      He hands her a TOWEL from behind his seat and she ruffs her 
      head.  

                                      STACIA  
                        I thought you were that other 
                        guy. From the motel?  I think 
                        he's following me.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        He's the reason I'm out here 
                        tonight.  

                                      STACIA  
                        Some kinda manhunt thing?  
                        What'd he do?  

                                      WHEELER  

      He hurt a few people. You know about territory?  He's like a 
      poacher, coming in where he don't belong, and hunting. He 
      hitches rides. Hard to track.  

      Wheeler puts the Truck in gear and MOVES back out onto the 
      roadway - back toward the Motel.  

      Stacia notes Wheeler's odd "decorations" - his souvenirs.  

      Among them, a KEYCHAIN FOB referencing the HORRIBLE THING 
      roadside attraction referenced on the billboard. Its logo:   

                      I SAW THE HORRIBLE THING AND SURVIVED! 

                                      STACIA  
                        So what's the Horrible Thing?  

                                      WHEELER  
                        I think it was a two-headed baby 
                        skeleton. Something awful like 
                        that. Nothing gives me the 
                        creeps more than some monster 
                        baby. Ever seen one?  

      Stacia takes note of the road, and their trajectory.  



                                                43.  



                                      STACIA  
                        Hey, wrong way.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        I want to cover the stretch 
                        between here and the motel. Then 
                        turn around and head out. Just 
                        to be sure. Nobody'll pick that 
                        guy up in this rain.  

                                      STACIA  
                        Oh.  

      She scans the interior of the Truck cab a bit nervously. The 
      way Birdy did.  

                                      STACIA (CONT D)  
                                (wary)  
                        Don't you need backup, or 
                        something?  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Not just yet. You may have 
                        gathered that this is kinda 
                        personal, between me and him.  
                                (lightens up)  
                        So what's your story?  

                                      STACIA  
                        Same as everybody - just trying 
                        to get from one place to the 
                        other.  

      EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT - RAIN 

      Walker marches down the road in utter darkness. Stops. 
      Spreads his arms to the night sky.  

                                      WALKER  
                        Come on, asshole!  I'm right 
                        here!  

      INT. WHEELER'S TRUCK - NIGHT - TRAVELING - RAIN 

      Resuming Wheeler and Stacia.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Staying out here will get you 
                        from alive to dead in a hurry. 
                        Sure you don't want to hold the 
                        gun?  


                                                44.  


      Stacia eyes the pistol.  

                                      STACIA  
                        I wouldn't even know which way 
                        to point it.  

      Wheeler seems to glaze over, to withdraw into himself.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Never turn down a ride. Never 
                        turn down a weapon.  

                                      STACIA  
                        You lost me there.  

      Stacia eyes all the "souvenirs" inside the cab. Uneasily. 
      Then, a flash of realization stiffens her.  

                                      STACIA (CONT D)  
                        But, wait - if you're after that 
                        guy who was in the room next to 
                        me, why didn't you just arrest 
                        him at the motel?  

                                      WHEELER  
                        That's not how it works.  

                                      STACIA  
                        How what works?  

      Wheeler has never really had to explain himself before. 
      Ponders it out.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        We're completely different. He 
                        rides. I drive. He gets picked 
                        up. Me, I do the picking up. He 
                        doesn't have any standards. 
                        He'll do anybody. He's like a 
                        mad dog.  

                                      STACIA  
                        You mean like ... you're the 
                        hunter, and he's the hunted?  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Some hunters only hunt dangerous 
                        prey. Fighters. Survivors. Not 
                        easy kills. He hunts whoever he 
                        can take.  
                                (beat)  
                        That's wasteful.  


                                                45.  


                                      STACIA  
                                (wary)  
                        I'm not sure I follow you.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        I know. Listen, I need to show 
                        you something. It'll all become 
                        clear.  

      Wheeler reaches across, apparently for the glovebox. The 
      smoothest, most natural move in the world. Then, like a 
      striking viper, he grabs the back of her neck and THUMPS her 
      head into the dash, once, twice, and Stacia GRAYS OUT before 
      she knows it.  

      WHEELER'S POV - STACIA'S TATTOO  

      The crescent moon on her neck fading out last of all.  

      (SPECIAL EFFECTS SHOT)  

      FADE TO BLACK with engine SOUND of the Truck OVER.  

      FADE IN SLOWLY  

      INT. WHEELER'S TRUCK - NIGHT - RAIN - LATER 

      First there is only the sound of the Truck, OS, different 
      pitch. Time has elapsed.  

      EXCU - STACIA'S EYES  

      As they flutter open. She is still in the Truck, moving 
      along. OS RADIO:  

                                      RADIO VOICE (VO)  
                        ... and just for variety, let's 
                        add some rain to that rain, heh. 
                        Build yourself a nice fire and 
                        watch some cable tonight, 'cos 
                        it ain't fit for man nor beast 
                        out there, and if you gotta-
                        gotta go, wear your hip-waders 
                        ...  

      STACIA'S POV - TRUCK WINDSHIELD  

      Stacia can see the reflection of her torso. Crisscrossed 
      with seatbelts. Hands bound. The Truck wipers sluice water 
      from the glass.  

      CLOSE-UP - HARNESS BUCKLE  


                                                46.  


        A racing-style, X-shaped seatbelt buckle sitting near her 
      sternum.  

      CLOSE-UP - STACIA'S WRISTS  

      Bound with duct tape.  

      RESUME STACIA'S POV - THE DASHBOARD  

      Her switchblade sits there among the souvenirs, just out of 
      reach.  

      And ... WHEELER. Driving, smoking, a beer in his crotch, 
      watching the road. Without looking at Stacia, he knows she's 
      back. He trims the radio SOUND.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        See, it's the chit-chat I never 
                        get right. Now I'm thinking I 
                        should have said something ... 
                        y'know, fancier. Like maybe I 
                        should have said, "gee, I sure 
                        like your earrings."  And you 
                        would have said, "thanks."  Then 
                        I say, "Think you'd give me one 
                        as a souvenir?" And you'd say, 
                        "no," and then I get to come 
                        back with, "Hey, I could have 
                        asked for one of your tits; I 
                        like those, too."  

      Stacia's eyes are rolling in horror. Wheeler's speech 
      unnerves her more than mere physical violence, which she 
      expects, anticipates. This is just ... weird. 

      Wheeler REACHES OVER. Stacia FLINCHES. Wheeler RIPS OUT her 
      left earring and hangs it on the dash grille. As Stacia 
      FREAKS OUT --  

                                      STACIA  
                        Owww jesus CHRIST --!  

                                      WHEELER  
                              (not missing a beat)  
                        And then you'd flip out, and 
                        then you'd try to jump out of a 
                        moving truck, which won't do you 
                        no good because your door don't 
                        open from the inside, just so 
                        you know.  

      Stacia writhes within her restraints, sucking air from the 
      pain.  

                                                47.  


                                      STACIA  
                        Why are you doing this?  

      Wheeler looks directly at her for the first time, and it's 
      not a pretty sight to see.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        You know, when you're fishing, 
                        bait usually doesn't ask stupid 
                        questions.  

                                      STACIA  
                        You're not a cop.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        That's equally stupid, but at 
                        least it's not a question. You 
                        get one more try before I get 
                        out the duct tape again.  

      Skating the rim of panic, Stacia considers what to say very 
      carefully.  

                                      STACIA  
                        How long was I out?  

                                      WHEELER  
                        'Bout forty minutes or so. No 
                        permanent damage.  

      EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT 

      The Truck roars PAST FRAME, kicking spume.  

      EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT - FURTHER ON 

      Vapor coalesces off the highway surface. Dark, ominous. We 
      hear the distant SOUND of Wheeler's Truck, growing CLOSER at 
      high speed.  

      WIDEN ANGLE  

      To reveal Walker standing there, waiting patiently.  

      Wheeler's headlights illuminate him. Here comes the Truck.  

      INT. WHEELER'S TRUCK - NIGHT - TRAVELING 

      Wheeler hits the brakes, skidding to a power stop PAST 
      Walker's position. He reverses gears and BACKS UP. Crushes 
      his beer can and stows it. Tucks his gun into his crotch. 
      Perfect, methodical, a man-machine series of moves.  


                                                48.  


                                      WHEELER  
                        Okay, here we go.  

      EXT HIGHWAY - NIGHT 

      The Truck barrels BACKWARD to Walker's position. Walker is 
      standing there with his thumb out. Wheeler buzzes the 
      passenger-side window down.  

                                      WALKER  
                        Hell of a night.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Yeah.  

                                      WALKER  
                        You offering me a ride?  

                                      WHEELER  
                        I think that's how it's supposed 
                        to go.  

      Stacia's eyes are drifting from one madman to the other.  

      Walker seems amused that Wheeler has captured Stacia.  

                                      WALKER  
                        Sure you got room?  

      Wheeler snorts. Yeah, sure. Walker BOARDS, scrunching Stacia 
      over.  

                                      WALKER (CONT D)  
                        Hello again.  

      INT. WHEELER'S TRUCK - NIGHT - MOVING 

      The Truck ROLLS. Walker points to the road ahead.  

                                      WALKER  
                        Hold up.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        What?  

                                      WALKER  
                        Snake. Don't hit it.  

      EXT. TRUCK - ON ROADWAY - NIGHT 

      A large RATTLER moves across the road in front of the Truck, 
      which STOPS.  


                                                49.  


                                      WHEELER (O.S.)  
                        Why not?  

      INT. WHEELER'S TRUCK - NIGHT - RESUMING 

      The trio's eyes all track the o.s. progress of the snake.  

                                      STACIA  
                              (almost sub-aurally)  
                        Because he's minding his own 
                        business.  

      They all - somewhat comically - wait for the snake. Walker 
        appropriates a smoke from the pack on the dash, lights it, 
      then says:  

                                      WALKER  
                        You got another cigarette?  

                                      WHEELER  
                        I thought you didn't.  

                                      WALKER  
                        Fooled you, didn't I?  

      Wheeler snorts and passes Walker a beer. Walker reaches and 
      meets Wheeler's hand EXACTLY halfway, in front of the 
      immobilized Stacia.  

                                      WALKER (CONT D)  
                              (to Stacia)  
                         Scuse me.  

      He doesn t open the beer. He holds the cold can against his 
      head, meditatively.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        I gotta a blonde joke for ya...  

                                      WALKER  

      Do tell.  











                                                50.  



                                      WHEELER  
                        This Blonde is walking through 
                        Central Park in the middle o  
                        winter and she sees this 
                          Rattlesnake freezin  in the 
                        snow! The Snake opens one eye 
                        and says,  Listen, Babe... ... 
                         I just got outta the Zoo and 
                        I m freezin  my ass off here. 
                        Could you pick me up and take me 
                        back? .  No way,  says the 
                        Blonde,  you ll bite me. I can t 
                        trust you .  Listen, honey,  
                        says the Snake,  I promise I 
                        won t bite you . Now the Blonde 
                        was a do-gooder for about ten 
                        minutes, so she picks up the 
                        Snake and starts walkin  it back 
                        to the Zoo. The Snake starts 
                        getting cozy in her hands, 
                        warmin  up...ya know...and he up 
                        n  bites on the boob! Gives her 
                        the Big Deep Sleep, ya know! 
                           Ooooohhh,  screams the Blonde, 
                        going down.  You promised not to 
                        bite me! . And the Snake says 
                         Listen, Babe... ...  

                                      WALKER  
                         You knew what I was when you 
                        picked me up . The way I heard 
                        it told, it was a scorpion and a 
                        toad.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Gee...you know the punchline, 
                        huh...so you re notta dumb 
                          blonde...that s good to know.  

      The snake's gone. Wheeler puts the Truck in gear and rolls.  

                                      WALKER  
                        Snakes are great. They've got 
                        three sets of teeth. Disposable 
                        skin. Smell with their tongues. 
                        They belong out here. Rain 
                        brings 'em out when the 
                        pavement's wet, sometimes.  

      Every LOOK, every GLANCE, every SMALL MOTION of both men 
      should be fraught with impending violence. We just don't 
      know how the storm will erupt. 

                                                51.  


      Stacia is helpless between them, mildly tharn with fear, but 
      angered at the helplessness of her predicament.  

                                      STACIA  
                              (tight, measured)  
                        Where are we going?  

      Wheeler ignores her, speaking across her, to Walker:  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Where you headed?  

      Walker inclines his nose forward toward Stacia. Shrugs.  

                                      WALKER  
                        Where are you taking her?  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Undecided.  

      Stacia SNEEZES explosively. She can't help it. She hates it. 
      She SNEEZES AGAIN.  

                                      STACIA  
                        Oh, no, goddammit ...  

      Wheeler holds up three fingers.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Wet weather, it's usually three.  

      Stacia sneezes again, despite herself.  

                                      STACIA  
                        Dammit!  

      In a perfect 1-2-3 move, alert for the slightest sign of 
      betrayal or action, Wheeler hands over a Kleenex, which 
      Walker takes and uses to wipe Stacia's nose.  

                                      STACIA (CONT D)  
                        Don't fucking touch me!  

      Wheeler SPINS on her.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Hey!  You are a passenger!  







                                                52.  



                                      WALKER  
                        Yeah. Be polite.  
                                (beat; to Stacia)  
                        See, our judgmental friend here 
                        is the kind of guy who likes to 
                        hunt. He likes to theorize about 
                        prey, worthy opponents, fair 
                        game, all that. Very 
                        romanticist.  
                                (pointed)  
                        He thinks he's not a predator. 
                        You should have seen him back at 
                        that bus.  

      EXT. BUS - EARLIER THAT DAY (FLASHBACK) 

      RESUMING the shot where Wheeler discovers the bodies of 
      Fergus and Deuce in the luggage bay. Wheeler "scents" Fergus 
      as -  

      DANNY reappears from the front of the bus.  

                                      DANNY  
                        This is not good, dude. Not 
                        good. We need to haul ass back 
                        to that restaurant or get on 
                        your CB and call -  

      Wheeler overrides Danny with a finger to the lips. Shhh. As 
      though to alert him that they are being WATCHED.  

      AT THE TREELINE 

      Walker, having abandoned Marie, hesitates to spy on what 
      he's leaving behind and sees Wheeler and Danny.  

      RESUME WHEELER AND DANNY 

                                      WHEELER  
                        I need to show you something.  

      Wheeler GRABS a fistful of Danny's HAIR and BOUNCES his face 
      off the side of the bus. As Danny REBOUNDS, Wheeler SPINS, 
      coming out of the turn with his PISTOL out and CLOCKING 
      Danny hard enough to knock out teeth. Danny DROPS bonelessly 
      to the ground.  

                                      WHEELER (CONT D)  
                        Idiot.  

      His eyes move back to the treeline, all his senses alert, 
      now. (FLASHBACK ENDS.)  

                                                53.  


      INT. WHEELER'S TRUCK - NIGHT - TRAVELING 

      RESUMING our trio. Stacia notes the speedometer. 70 mph. 
      Slick, curvy roads. Wheeler ominous in his concentration. 
      Walker continues his "explanation," indicating Wheeler's 
      collection of "trophies," now including Stacia's earring.  

                                      WALKER  
                        See all these little souvenirs?  
                        Trinkets, geegaws?  

      Walker indicates the HORRIBLE THING keychain.  

                                      WALKER (CONT D)  
                        He never saw the Horrible Thing. 
                        He just kept the keychain.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        You call that proof?  Am I 
                        supposed to laugh?  

      Walker continues talking to Stacia, captive, hideously 
      intimate:  

                                      WALKER  
                        Your genuinely dangerous 
                        individuals? They almost never 
                        look crazy. No weird tattoos, no 
                        stitches on their face, no 
                        oddly-shaped heads. They are ... 
                        not... predictable.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        You within spitting distance of 
                        having a point?  

                                      STACIA  
                        He drives. You ride. The only 
                        question is which one of you is 
                        a bigger psycho.  

                                      WALKER  
                        I told you...be polite.  

                                      STACIA  
                        My money s on the trucker here.  

                                      WALKER  
                        Is that right?  

      Wheeler's HAND moves and Walker is ready to pounce ... but 
      Wheeler is just reaching to fiddle with the radio. Static. A 
      weird Conelrad tone.  

                                                54.  


                                      WHEELER  
                        It's the ozone. Screws up 
                        reception.  

      Walker looks UP toward the night sky.  

                                      WALKER  
                        It wants to rain again.  

      And while Walker is looking / not-looking:  

      Wheeler whip-draws his pistol, cocking it, just as:  

      Walker draws his gun equally fast, pointing it at Wheeler - 
      an INCH from Stacia's nose, where Wheeler is already pointed 
      at Walker ... AS THEY PILEDRIVE ALONG AT 70  MPH.  

                                      STACIA  
                        Wait!  No ...!  

                                      WALKER  
                        Your money still on the trucker?  
                              (to Wheeler)  
                        You get me, but I get her. Give 
                        it a minute, boss.  

      Walker shifts his gun so it presses against Stacia s 
      forehead.  

      Wheeler keeps the bore between Walker's eyes.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Might be worth it.  

      Walker quickly shifts his aim back to Wheeler.  

      Stacia's EYES, millimeters from both guns, track down to 
      REALIZE that Wheeler is NOT WEARING HIS SEAT BELT - all the 
      harnesses in the front have been used to truss her up.  

      Walker purrs, enjoying the tension:  

                                      WALKER  
                        Who ... gets ... who?  

                                      STACIA  
                        Both of you ... get fucked!  

      Stacia STOMPS ON THE BRAKE while the Truck is going FULL-
      SPEED!  

      INTERCUTS:   


                                                55.  


      INT. TRUCK OF THE FIGHT 

      EXT. OF THE TRUCK ON THE ROAD 

      INSIDE TRUCK - NIGHT 

      The Truck NOSES DOWN on the wet road as Wheeler's GUN GOES 
      OFF right in front of Stacia's face. Walker's beer can 
      EXPLODES as the rider-side window BLOWS OUT.  

      THE KNIFE jabs Stacia's neck - not deadly.  

      The Truck FISHTAILS so furiously that it MOMENTARILY GOES UP 
      ON ITS FRONT WHEELS, and - Wheeler and Walker are BOTH 
      JETTISONED THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD.  

      The Truck BOUNCES and judders to a teeth-rattling stop.  

      Wheeler and Walker CRASH-LAND onto the pavement, riddled 
      with cubes of safety glass.  

      Stacia's LEFT HARNESS rips loose and her face BANGS into the 
      dashboard. She REBOUNDS, nose bleeding, vision blurred, to 
      SEE the two killers in the skewed spray of headlights.  

      OUTSIDE TRUCK - NIGHT 

      Walker ROLLS painfully over. He s got a huge wound in his 
      chest from Wheeler s bullet.  

                                      WALKER  
                        Ahhh ... god ... dammit!  

      Wheeler GROPES blindly. Half his face has been sanded off by 
      the pavement. His left arm is not working correctly. Broken 
      bones grind.  

      Walker STANDS, wobbling, gasping, to HAUL WHEELER up by the 
      scruff.  

                                      WALKER (CONT D)  
                        You can do better than this!  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Show me what you've got.  

      Walker FLATHANDS Wheeler in the face, pancaking his nose.  

      Wheeler slams his fist into Walker s wound then throws him 
      to the ground.  




                                                56.  



      INSIDE TRUCK - NIGHT  

      Stacia SEES Wheeler's GUN on the floor. Can't reach it. The 
      harnesses have been loosened by the momentum. She can ALMOST 
      reach it - at considerable strain, maybe dislocating her 
      wrist, her shoulder, to SCOOT the gun closer with her foot, 
      to REACH DOWN with bound hands. Dizzy, panting, she 
      advantages the loose harness to finally ... excruciatingly 
      slowly ... collect the gun.  

      OUTSIDE TRUCK - NIGHT 

      Wheeler turns his attention to Stacia - heading for the 
      overturned truck.  

      Walker comes after him, jumping him from behind. He wants 
      Stacia for himself.  

      Wheeler goes down. Walker reaches the truck - his hand 
      gropes through the windshield reaching for her.  

      INSIDE TRUCK - NIGHT 

      Stacia can't focus her eyes but does her best to RAISE the 
      pistol. To THUMB back the hammer. Painful. She drops it. 

      Then she HEARS a siren approaching.  

      Red flashbar lights reflects on her as the sound of the 
      approaching AMBULANCE comes closer.  

      HOLD HOLD HOLD ON STACIA  

      Her composure fracturing as the SIREN gets louder (o.s.) and 
      the red/white flashbar lights REFLECT off her more 
        intensively. Holding the gun. Gasping. Almost bursting into 
      tears of relief. Almost laughing, borderline nuts.  

                                      STACIA  
                        "Never turn down a ride ..."  
                        That would be ... crazy ...  

      Stacia GRAYS OUT.  

      INT. AMBULANCE - NIGHT - RAIN - TRAVELING 

      Wheeler's eyes POP OPEN and he's staring UP at the underside 
      of an ambulance bunk rack. IV bags dangle and the SIREN is 
      wailing.  




                                                57.  



                                      LEMMON (O.S.)  
                        Hold still, pardner - you don't 
                        need to wake up.  

      Wheeler's POV follows an IV hose running out of him. Past 
      bloody dressings. His leg immobilized in a splint. The face 
      of LEMMON - a sandy-haired, bright-eyed young EMT - looms 
      large from a LOW ANGLE.  

                                      LEMMON (CONT D)  
                        Lucky.  

                                      WHEELER  
                              (dazed)  
                        What lucky.  

                                      LEMMON  
                        This bird watcher lady out in 
                        the middle of noplace thought 
                        she had a heart attack. Turned 
                        out to be indigestion. By the 
                        time we found her group, it 
                        started raining. So here we are, 
                        headed back to base ... pure 
                        luck, really. You lost you some 
                        blood. Arm's busted, leg's 
                        busted --  

      Lemmon holds up Stacia's switchblade.  

                                      LEMMON (CONT D)  
                        -- and I guess I should just 
                        mind my own business about this, 
                        huh?  

      The whole world is spinning and Wheeler is fighting for 
        orientation. He can't hold his head up. It sags back - he's 
      got a pneumatic collar around his neck.  

      Contusions and scrapes.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Had an accident.  

                                      LEMMON  
                        Now you're getting it.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Lost control.  




                                                58.  



                                      LEMMON  
                        All you have to do now is just 
                        hang on, and don't think about 
                        the bumps in the road.  

      OS SNEEZE. A hand GRABS a tissue. We already know who it is.  

      Lemmon TURNS to hand a tissue to WALKER, now REVEALED to be 
      in the adjacent bunk, less than two feet away from Wheeler!  

      Lemmon MOVES back to the cab of the ambulance.  

      As Wheeler's vision BLURS in and out of focus, Walker 
      SNEEZES a second and third time.  

                                      WALKER  
                        Three. It's always three, right.  

      Walker holds a finger to his lips. Shhhh.  

      OS undiscernable RADIO CHATTER (it should sound like the 
      weird Conelrad noise Wheeler heard in the Truck), the peal 
      of the siren OVER, highballing tires on wet roadway. We see 
      that Wheeler and Walker are STRAPPED into their respective 
      bunks, side-by-side.  

      Walker is equally bruised and battered from the wreck. He 
      holds up his free hand, the one with the tissue. It is 
      heavily bandaged. He stares wonderingly at the dressing, as 
      though impressed. 

                                      WALKER (CON'T)  
                        You bit me.  

                                      WHEELER  
                              (dopey)  
                        What the hell are you about?  

                                      WALKER  
                        I don't understand the question.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        Understand that you're fuckin 
                        dead.  

      This news strikes Walker like a gas pain. Oh, puh-leeze.  

                                      WALKER  
                        If I were you, I'd worry about 
                        them finding your Truck. I've 
                        already got my ride.  


                                                59.  


      Wheeler LUNGES against his own safety restraints. Now he's 
      mad again.  

                                      WALKER (CONT D)  
                        Wait. Calm down. You're going to 
                        bust a blood vessel.  
                              (almost a whisper)  
                        There's a helluva lot two guys 
                        like us could do with an 
                        ambulance like this.  

      Walker unfurls his Kleenex one-handed, like a magician, to 
      reveal a SCAPEL he has purloined.  

      HOLD on Wheeler's dawning reaction as OS the SIREN is 
      abruptly terminated.  

      Lemmon RE-ENTERS the ambulance bay.  

                                      LEMMON  
                        Okay, boys 'n girls. Seat belts 
                        fastened? Luggage stowed?  

      Lemmon BENDS OVER to retrieve something from a low drawer.  

      ONLY WHEELER can see Walker SIT UP as far as the straps will 
      let him, testing his reach. Walker makes a STABBING MOTION 
      toward Lemmon's back. Yeah - good enough. As Lemmon RISES, 
      Walker RESUMES his supine position and WINKS at Wheeler.  

      Lemmon RISES between the men with two big 60cc HYPODERMICS.  

                                      LEMMON (CONT D)  
                              (to DRIVER)  
                        Watch this, Vinnie. Two at once.  

                                      WHEELER  
                        What's in those?  

                                      LEMMON  
                        Nothing but air, my friend.  

      Lemmon KNEELS forcefully and PLUNGES both hypos, left-right, 
      INTO the chests of Wheeler and Walker, who begin to CONVULSE 
        immediately. He GRINS as he watches them die.  

      VINNIE, the DRIVER, glances back from his driver's seat.  

                                      VINNIE  
                        Awesome. What about dessert?  




                                                60.  



      Lemmon RISES TO STANDING, and for the first time, we can SEE 
      the berth ABOVE WALKER - which contains STACIA, beaten up, 
      strapped down, IMMOBILIZED, gagged, and BUG-EYED WITH FEAR.  

                                      LEMMON  
                        We save her for later.  

      EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT 

      A HIGH OMNISCIENT POV of the ambulance, dwindling away on 
      the dark road. The FLASHBAR is extinguished, leaving only 
      headlights, taillights, and pretty soon, nothing at all.  

      FADE TO BLACK.  

                                            THE END
