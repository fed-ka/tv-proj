FADE UP ON:
A surreal kaleidoscope of black, white and red. Similar to
the mirror scene above, the colors slowly come into focus,
revealing the chiseled features of a familiar face. But this
time we see that it is not a real face, but rather a plastic
mask of the D.C. Comic hero -- SUPERMAN.
INTERTITLE: CLEVELAND OHIO, 1956
CLOSE ON SUPERMAN MASK
It glows eerily in the light of a porch lamp. A child's pupils
glare through the eye holes...
The camera pans from SUPERMAN to the masked face of another
caped-crusader: BATMAN. Batman turns toward his loyal sidekick
ROBIN, who clutches a plastic, trick-or-treat pumpkin.
Next, we find THE GREEN LANTERN as he reaches up to ring the
doorbell. The camera finally rests on the last boy: an unkempt
KID wearing no costume at all. Looking irritated and removed
from the rest of the group, the KID shoves his hands in the
pockets of his shearling coat.
He spits and rolls his eyes as a lady answers the door.
The brick home is as working class as it gets. The lady at
the door is a 1950's HOUSEWIFE.
BOYS
(in unison)
Trick or treat!!
HOUSEWIFE
Well, look at this! All the
superheroes on the porch! Ain't that
cute.
The Lady drops a candy apple in each boy's container.
HOUSEWIFE
(still yelling)
We got Superman here, Batman, his
sidekick ROBIN, ohh, The Green Lantern
even...
She finally stops at the costumeless KID. He halfheartedly
holds up a ratty, stained pillowcase.
HOUSEWIFE
And what about you young man?
KID
What about what?
The other boys giggle. The kid flashes them a "kick yer ass"
look.
HOUSEWIFE
Who are you supposed to be?
The kid shrugs.
KID
I'm Harvey Pekar (pronounced "Pee
Car").
HOUSEWIFE
Harvey Pekar? That doesn't sound
like a super hero to me...
BOYS
(mumbling)
Pecker, Pecker...
KID
I ain't no super hero, lady. I'm
just a kid from the neighborhood,
alright?
The Housewife stares at him, confused.
KID
Ahh, forget this...
Frustrated, the kid throws his pillowcase down. He trudges
off as the others watch in confusion.
KID
Why is everybody so stoopid?
BEGIN NERVOUS JAZZ SCORE
WE FOLLOW the schlumpy kid (aka HARVEY PEKAR) as he sulks
down the street...
DISSOLVE TO:
INTERTITLE: CLEVELAND OHIO, 1975
A grown-up version of HARVEY PEKAR (now mid-thirties) stomps
along the same Cleveland street. Unfortunately, 20 years
have made this rust belt neighborhood a bit rustier. The
"GROWN UP HARVEY" dons the same shearling coat, sports the
same disheveled hair, and wears the same curmudgeonly
expression.
CREDIT SEQUENCE - ANIMATED SEQUENCE INTERCUT HARVEY WALKING
WITH COMIC BOOK PANELS OF THE CARTOON HARVEY IN ACTION. This
is not your typical super-hero stuff.
Instead it features our man engaging in such daredevil feats
as:
--Buying used records from a garage sale table.
We're now on HARVEY'S back as he continues his forlorn
journey. We move forward, past him, to peer over the hill at
the factories below.
REAL HARVEY (V.O.)
Okay. We're throwing a lot at ya
here, so lemme step in an' help ya
catch up. This is the story about
comic books, an' a guy who made a
whole life outta them. You could
even say comics saved his life. This
guy here, he's our man, Harvey Pekar --
all grown up and goin' nowhere.
Although he's a pretty scholarly
cat, he never got much of a formal
education. For the most part, he's
lived in shit neighborhoods, held
shit jobs, and is now knee deep into
a second disastrous marriage. So if
yer lookin' for romance or escapism
or some fantasy figure to save the
day, guess what? Ya got the wrong
movie.
SUDDENLY EVERYTHING -- THE MUSIC, THE CREDITS, THE IMAGES --
COMES TO A HALT.
CUT TO:
A silent sequence. A dejected HARVEY walks home alone along
an empty lot. Day-old dirty snow clings to the ground.
He wanders through a down-in-the-heels neighborhood, passing
run-down stores and ramshackle apartments.
Harvey approaches TOBY -- a dumpy 20-something going on 60-
something in ridiculous, mismatched polyester clothing. He
is odd, awkward and talks with a monotone, robotic voice. In
short, he is a super dork.
TOBY
Hi Harvey. You weren't in work today.
Are you okay, Harvey?
Harvey barely looks up. He nods his head "yes" and keeps
walking.
TOBY
(yelling after him)
I'm heading downtown to the White
Castle. Wanna come, Harvey?
Harvey leaves Toby behind and turns the corner.
Two WOMEN argue loudly over a payphone.
SPANISH WOMAN #1
(in Spanish)
I already told you, I'm waiting for
a call!
SPANISH WOMAN #2
Oh yeah? Since when is this your
private office?!
SPANISH WOMAN #1
Since you can kiss my ass.
Harvey stops in his tracks and stares at them, jealous of
their ability to speak.
CLOSE UP: SPANISH WOMAN #1's MOUTH
HARVEY
(to himself)
Look at 'em yakkin'. How do they do
it?
Out of the corner of her eye, WOMAN #2 notices Harvey
eavesdropping.
WOMAN #2
(yelling at Harvey)
Ay, what are you looking at? Maricone!
Startled, Harvey moves on.
He passes a group of KIDS playing in the snow. They scream,
yell and laugh with abandon.
HARVEY
(shaking his head)
They all make it seem so easy.
Then, BAM! Harvey is awakened from his reverie by a snowball.
The kids laugh loudly. He wipes away the snow and walks on.
A VOICE OVER interrupts the scene.
REAL HARVEY (V.O.)
Here's our man walking home from the
doctor's. He's got the weight of the
world on him. And fer what, really?
'Cause his throat's a little screwy?
Man, people in India are starvin' to
death every day. His problems are
nothin'.
CUT TO:
Totally dejected, HARVEY crosses over train tracks on his
way home.
REAL HARVEY (V.O.)
Still, he can't help feelin' paranoid,
like some supernatural force is
conspiring against him to rob him of
his voice.
Harvey sulks up the steps of his brick low-rise apartment
building. He passes an ELDERLY NEIGHBOR coming down the walk
with her shopping cart. Harvey unlocks the door.
REAL HARVEY (V.O.)
Maybe his old lady will go easy on
him today, when she sees how upset
he is.
INTERTITLE: 1962
HARVEY (a little more hair but the exact same style) and a
bunch of his BUDDIES sift through old records at a junk sale.
REAL HARVEY (V.O.)
In the early sixties I was with some
buddies at a junk sale looking for
some choice sides when I met this
shy, retiring cat from Philadelphia
named Bob Crumb. You know the guy;
Fritz the Cat, Mr. Natural an' all --
they made a movie about him, too.
One of Harvey's pals -- MARTY -- pulls a record out of a
box.
MARTY
C'mon, Harv. You dig Jay McShann.
You gonna buy that or what?
Harvey jumps up from his search to check out the LP.
HARVEY
I don't know, Marty. It's got a
lamination crack in it...
(checking out the
price)
A quarter. Maybe I can get him down.
MARTY
You are one cheap bastard Harvey.
HARVEY
Yeah, I know I'm tight, man, but I
live on a government wage.
A skinny guy with a big nose, glasses and a ratty trench
coat taps Harvey on the shoulder. He is soft-spoken, a bit
shy and very odd -- a young ROBERT CRUMB.
CRUMB
You collect Jay McShann, man?
HARVEY
Yeah, man. How 'bout you?
CRUMB
Yeah but most of my records are back
in Philly.
A greaser-type guy in a leather jacket, PAHLS, joins them.
PAHLS
Harv, meet my buddy Bob Crumb. He
just moved to town. He's an artist
at American Greeting Card Company.
HARVEY
That's cool.
PAHLS
You should see his comics, Harv.
They are outta sight.
HARVEY
(interested)
Yeah? I'm into comics myself.
DISSOLVE TO:
ANOTHER R. CRUMB DRAWING OF HARVEY (Now circa 1975)
On a sketch pad we see a deranged, tormented Harvey sitting
alone on a park bench. He pulls at his hair, and looks as
though he may murder the next person who walks by.
INTERTITLE: BACK TO 1975
As the pencil adds shading to Harvey's face, WE HEAR:
REAL HARVEY (V.O.)
Once he came to visit when I was
really feelin' bad. It was right
around the time of my throat
operation, an' right after my second
wife left me. At first it was pretty
weird. I mean, here my life was
falling apart an' everything was
going great for him. I was on my
second divorce an' he was a big hit
with the chicks. I was a nothin'
file clerk and he was this famous
cartoonist.
HARVEY and R. CRUMB sit on a park bench together by a bus
stop. A distraught Harvey whines while Crumb just sketches.
Harvey's voice is still raspy.
HARVEY
I dunno, man. On the one hand most
women gettin' graduate degrees
wouldn't give a guy like me the time
a' day. An' she married me an'
everything, so I gotta give her some
kinda credit. But then she got so
mean to me in the end. An' it ain't
like I tried t'keep her captive or
anything like that, y'know?
Crumb may or may not be listening to Harvey. It's hard to
tell.
HARVEY
An' then on top of it I lost my voice
for three months. I still sound like
shit, but before I had nothin'. Man,
talk about hell. I started forgettin'
what I sound like, y'know? So I
started writin' stuff down -- stories
an' things, my points a' view, ideas.
I even published a couple jazz record
reviews. I guess that ended up bein'
a good thing.
CRUMB
Uh-huh.
HARVEY
But don't think I buy into this
"growth" crap. Everybody talks about
how bad experiences can cause ya
t'grow, an' all that clichd stuff.
I've had enough bad experiences and
growth to last me plenty.
(a beat)
Right now, I'd be glad to trade some
growth for happiness.
For a moment, they both just sit there saying nothing to
each other, each man in his own private universe.
Finally Harvey looks over to Crumb.
HARVEY
So how long are ya stayin' in
Cleveland?
Crumb never looks up from his picture.
CRUMB
I dunno, man. I gotta go visit this
chick in New York. And I'm really
busy with the comic book stuff. It's
good bread and all man but I'm getting
fed up with the whole scene.
HARVEY
What are ya talkin' about? Yer makin'
a good living doin' yer art? Sheesh.
How many guys get that lucky in their
life, huh?
CRUMB
Yeah, I dunno.
HARVEY
Ya know man, people are startin' to
know the name "Crumb." When you croak
you're gonna leave something behind.
CRUMB
Yeah, my ashes and some crappy
doodles. It's not like I'm Blind
Lemon Jefferson or Big Mama Thornton.
HARVEY
C'mon, man. It sure beats workin' a
gig like mine -- being a nobody flunky
and sellin' records on the side for
a buck.
CRUMB
Yeah, well that's true...
Harvey nods in agreement, mulling this over. He's not at all
offended.
CUT TO:
A motley group of GUYS hang out on a street corner in front
of the Association of Polish Women. HARVEY heads towards
them.
MARTY
Hey look guys, here comes Captain
America.
Harvey rolls his eyes.
PAHLS
(yelling out)
You gonna hang with the boys now
that yer a comic book star?
Harvey turns red. He's embarrassed but part of him loves the
attention.
HARVEY
Cut it out. Man, I ain't nothin' yet
compared to Bob Crumb.
GUY #3
Ah, listen to him. One lousy comic
book and he wants to be Crumb.
The GUYS laugh.
ANGLE ON SILENT GUY
A SILENT GUY crouches by the wall, reading his CLEVELAND
BROWNS trading cards.
PAHLS
Hey Harvey, if ya wanna make comics
for adults, ya oughtta put some dirty
stuff in it.
GUY #3
Yeah, you can write about Marty's
sex life.
Harvey hangs with the guys but he doesn't engage. He seems
to be observing them more than interacting with them.
GUY #3
Right Marty? I heard ya went out
with Bonnie yesterday.
PAHLS
Yeah. Howdja do? Wudja git offa her?
MARTY
Ah, lousy. All's I got wuz armaround.
The guys all stare at him for a moment. Then they crack up.
CUT TO:
Extreme wide shot: a city-street overpass spans across the
entire frame. The lone figure of Harvey sulks there in the
middle, watching traffic pass below.
REAL HARVEY (V.O.)
Sure my comics were bringin' me
notoriety, but my personal life was
in shambles. I thought a little
attention would make me feel better.
It only made me feel worse.
CUT TO:
It is a beautiful, sunny day. The trees are in bloom.
There's the first scent of spring in the air. Kids play in
the street. Music pours out of passing cars. Everyone seems
to have a smile on his or her face except HARVEY. He walks
on the shadowy side of the street.
Establishing shot of HARVEY trudging into the bakery.
HARVEY and ALICE continue their conversation as they stroll
towards her car.
HARVEY
I'm reading this book by Dreiser now --
JENNIE GERHARDT.
ALICE
That's one of my favorites.
HARVEY
I hope it don't end like so many a'
those naturalist novels... With
someone getting crushed ta earth by
forces he can't control.
Alice smiles.
ALICE
I think you'll be pleasantly
surprised. It's certainly not a
Hollywood happy ending, but it's
pretty truthful. Which is rare these
days...
This hits home with Harvey. He can't believe he's made such
a connection with this woman.
Alice stops in front of a beat-up station wagon.
ALICE
This is me.
HARVEY
Nice car. I don't have one yet.
ALICE
Can I give ya a lift somewhere?
HARVEY
Nah. It's a nice day. I'll just walk.
Harvey looks down, a little sad.
ALICE
Well, we should have you over sometime
for dinner.
HARVEY
Sure, I'd be glad t'come. But if you
really wanna do me a favor, introduce
me to some a' your single girlfriends.
I bet they're all smart like you.
I'm no catch, though, so I'll take
anything you can get me.
Alice pecks Harvey on the cheek.
ALICE
I'll work on it.
She gets into the car.
ALICE
Nice seeing ya Harvey.
Harvey watches as she drives off.
REAL HARVEY (V.O.)
When I got home, I finished reading
JENNIE GERHARDT. It was real good,
way better than I expected. That
Alice wuz right.
An urban comic book shop on a dicey but bohemian street. A
title over picture reads, "MEANWHILE, IN DELAWARE."
HARVEY takes his mail out of the box. He finds an oddly
decorated envelope.
JOYCE (V.O.)
To make matters more dismal, there
are no decent comic book stores in
my town, which is why my partner and
I opened one ourselves.
HARVEY approaches the building. Instead of dragging his feet
like usual, he seems to be floating on a cloud. We haven't
seen Harvey this happy since... well, since never.
He stops by a junker car and peeks in the window, finding
TOBY eating lunch alone. He has an entire White Castle
smorgasbord spread across the front seat.
Harvey knocks on the window. Toby rolls it down.
HARVEY
Ay Toby.
TOBY
(mouth full)
No you can't have any of my White
Castle hamburgers so please don't
even ask.
HARVEY
Can I have a fry?
Harvey reaches for a handful of Toby's fries.
TOBY
Okay, but just a couple, Harvey. I'm
not going to eat dinner until very
late and this has got to hold me
over.
Harvey leans in, always amused by Toby. He steals another
fry.
HARVEY
(munching)
Whattya got, a church function?
TOBY
No, I'm driving to Toledo to see a
movie. Would you like to come?
HARVEY
Nah. I gotta fly to Delaware tonight.
I'm gettin' married.
TOBY
Oh. Why Delaware?
HARVEY
The chick I'm marryin' is from
Wilmington. Plus, I gotta help her
move her stuff here.
(a beat)
Why you drivin' ta Toledo to see a
movie?
TOBY
It's not playing at the Mapletown.
(a beat)
I didn't know you had a girlfriend,
Harvey.
HARVEY
Yeah. We met last week.
Harvey opens the car door and slides in with Toby.
HARVEY
Toby, what movie could possibly be
worth drivin' 260 miles round trip
for?
TOBY
It's a new film called "Revenge of
the Nerds." It's about a group of
nerd college students who are being
picked on all the time by the jocks,
so they decide to take revenge. I
already saw it once.
HARVEY
Wow, ya really dig this movie.
TOBY
I like it a lot, Harvey.
HARVEY
What are these nerds like? How would
you describe them?
TOBY
Hmm... Nerds are smart but they look
and act differently than other people.
Like nerds might wear polyester button-
down shirts and flood pants where
their ankles and their socks are
showing.
Toby spills some catsup on his polyester button-down shirt.
He stands up to get a napkin, revealing his flood pants.
HARVEY
So what yer sayin' is you identify
with those nerds?
TOBY
(rubbing out the catsup)
Yes, I consider myself a nerd. And
this movie has uplifted me. There's
this one scene where a nerd grabs
the microphone during a pep rally
and announces that he is a nerd and
that he is proud of it and stands up
for the rights of other nerds. Then,
he asks the kids at the pep rally
who think they are nerds to come
forward... So nearly everyone in the
place does. That's the way the movie
ends.
HARVEY
So the nerds won, huh?
TOBY
(smiling)
Yes.
Harvey grabs the rest of Toby's fries and opens the door to
leave.
HARVEY
Wow. You got this movie an' I'm
gettin' hitched. We both had a good
month, huh?
TOBY
(finishing his last
burger)
Right. Harvey, how long are you going
to be in Delaware because I'd really
like to see this movie with you?
HARVEY
I'm only goin' for a week but then
I'll have a wife, so I'll have to
take her along. Is it a girl flick?
TOBY
Depends on the girl. What kind of
girl is your new bride? Is she a
nerd?
HARVEY
I don't know, man. Maybe. She's into
herbal teas.
Toby watches Harvey saunter off. He returns to his last
hamburger.
CUT TO:
A brightly lit marquee reads, "REVENGE OF THE NERDS." The
doors to the theater open and a crowd pours onto the street.
HARVEY, JOYCE and TOBY are among them. Toby proudly wears a
"Genuine Nerd" button on his striped shirt.
JOYCE
I agree with Toby. I think it's a
story of hope and tolerance.
TOBY
Yes. It's about time that the people
who get picked on get to be the
heroes.
Harvey scrunches his face in disbelief.
HARVEY
It's an entertaining flick an' I can
see why you like it Toby, but those
people on the screen ain't even
supposed to be you! They're college
students whose parents live in big
houses in the suburbs. They're gonna
get degrees, get good jobs and stop
being nerds.
Joyce hits Harvey.
JOYCE
Harvey, what did I say about loud
talking? Use your inside voice.
HARVEY
(whispering loudly)
Look Toby, the guys in that movie
are not 28-year-old file clerks who
live with their grandmothers in an
ethnic ghetto.
JOYCE
That's enough, Harvey.
HARVEY
They didn't get their computers like
you did -- by trading in a bunch of
box tops and $49.50 at the
supermarket.
Joyce folds her arms in disapproval. Toby starts to laugh.
TOBY
You're funny Harvey.
Harvey looks at him, disappointed. He shakes his head.
HARVEY
Sure, Toby. Go to the movies and
daydream, but "Revenge of the Nerds"
ain't reality. It's just Hollywood
bullshit.
CUT TO:
ANGLE ON TOBY'S CAR (THROUGH WINDSHIELD)
Toby and Joyce continue to analyze the movie in the front

She points to Mr. Boats.
JOYCE

Armed with shopping bags from Bleecker Bob's Record Shop,
the Strand Book Store and Forbidden Planet Comic Book
Emporium, HARVEY and JOYCE eat lunch on a park bench. Harvey
chomps on a knish and watches oddball New Yorkers stroll by
as Joyce nibbles on her hot dog.
CUT TO:
Harvey and Joyce stroll across the lawn holding hands. They
move towards a waiting cab. Harvey carries his wife's bags.
REAL HARVEY (V.O.)
I guess it was good ta finally see
Joyce excited about somethin' of her
own. Sure I was happy for her. But I
was still upset for me.
They stop by the cab.
HARVEY
This is crazy. Can't ya just do
somethin' here in Cleveland?
JOYCE
Harvey, you'll survive a few weeks
alone.
HARVEY
Alright... Be careful. I love you,
baby.
They kiss. Harvey grudgingly puts her bags in the car. He
watches as the cab pulls away.
REAL HARVEY (V.O.)
It was later that night when I first
found the lump.
Miserable and in a daze, HARVEY walks up to his front door.
He looks like a man whose days are numbered. When he reaches
the door, he searches his pockets for keys.
ANGLE ON POCKET
Harvey's hand comes up empty.
HARVEY
Shit!
Harvey tries the doorknob, but it's locked.
He steps back on the lawn and looks around. Could he have
dropped them? He retraces a few steps.
HARVEY
Damnit!
Harvey yells up at the window.
HARVEY
Joyce, open the door! I lost my keys
again! Joyce!!
ANGLE ON FRONT DOOR
HARVEY'S ELDERLY NEIGHBOR struggles with her shopping cart
through the door.
Harvey pushes past her to get in.
HARVEY walks towards the bus stop to send DANIELLE to school.
He holds her hand.
HARVEY
Ya know, you should write about things
in your own life. Like school and...
ponies... I don't know, girl stuff...
DANIELLE
(to Harvey)
Do you have to hold my hand?
HARVEY
(wounded)
What, are you embarrassed a' me? I
know, I'm embarrassing. I felt the
same way about my father.
Danielle looks up at Harvey like he's crazy.
DANIELLE
No Harvey. You're just squeezing it
too hard.
(shaking her head)
Joyce is right. You are obsessive
compulsive.
Danielle drops his hand and rushes onto the bus with other
kids.
Harvey waves and watches as it pulls away.
He turns and walks by himself down the busy Cleveland street --
-- a familiar image from the opening. He's still hunched
over. He's still Harvey.
REAL HARVEY (V.O.)
Yeah, so I guess comics brought me a
lot. But don't think this is some
sunny, happy ending. Every day is
still a major struggle. Joyce an' I
fight like crazy, an' she barely
works. The kid's got A.D.D. and is a
real handful. My expenses have gone
up so much that I'm writin' freelance
'round the clock, just to make my
bills. My life is total chaos.
