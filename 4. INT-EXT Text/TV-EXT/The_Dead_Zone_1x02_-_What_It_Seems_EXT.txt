          The rain has ended but the ground is still wet from the
          night before.  Johnny is taking a walk in his neighborhood
          as Purdy's limo arrives.  Purdy gets out of the back...
          beams at Johnny...

                                        PURDY
                        Howdy, stranger.

          The words don't quite fit the man.  Six years ago, Johnny
          might have smirked and made a sarcastic comment but a lot
          has happened and Johnny stifles any feelings he might
          have had toward Purdy and simply smiles (and avoids
          touching him)...

                                        JOHNNY
                          Reverend.  

                                        PURDY
                        Can I stretch my legs with you?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sure.  Got to do ten miles this
                          morning.

                                        PURDY
                        Ten.  Well, I don't know if my
                        legs will stretch quite that far...

          As they begin to walk, the long limo inches along behind
          them... Johnny glances back but chooses not to comment...

                                        JOHNNY
                          Reverend... we need to talk about
                          something...

                                        PURDY
                        Don't say another word... I've
                        already opened you a checking
                          account, ordered you credit

                                (overlapping)
                        What I wanted to say was how
                          grateful I am for all you did for
                        my mother... when she needed
                        someone...

                        I loved her too, Johnny.

          Johnny acknowledges but unlike everyone else, he's just
          begun the grieving process.

                                        PURDY
                        Have you made any plans?

                        May I make a bold suggestion? 
                        Come visit us out at the
                          university, inspect your mother's
                        legacy.  There's still work to be
                        done...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Me?  I don't think I'd fit in,
                          Reverend.

                                        PURDY
                        Sure you would.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The truth is... I've never been
                        much of a believer in anything I
                          couldn't see with a microscope. 

                                        PURDY
                        Even now?  After what you've been
                          through?

                        Your... resurrection is pretty 
                        strong evidence of a greater power
                        at work from where I sit.  There

                        it's my job.

          He stops.  The car stops behind him.

                                        PURDY
                        Think about it, okay?

          Purdy smiles warmly, sticks out his hand to shake good-
          bye...

                        I don't mean to be rude... I find
                        it difficult to... touch people...
                        since the coma... sort of a
                          phobia...

          Purdy studies him with sympathy and concern, nods.  Behind
          him, the limo driver gets out and quickly opens the back
          door...

          He gets in the car.



          Johnny, miles later, continuing his walk, arrives on the
          sidewalk... (lose wild line: "Allsion, where are you")... *
          he studies the building, looking for clues... he moves
          toward the mailbox, opens it to look inside and as he
          touches it...

                        Maybe you should listen.

                        You're kidding, right...?

                                        DR. TRAN
                        I know it's difficult to believe. 
                        It was for me.  But Johnny does
                        have a unique precognitive ability. 
                        We've learned to take it seriously. 
                          I suggest you do as well.

          Off Walt's reaction...



          Looking through the windshield at Walt as his mind works...
          trying to balance his cynical mind with the chance... the
          barest chance that this guy might be able to help catch
          the son of a bitch who is strangling women.  Finally, he
          picks up the radio...

          Johnny and Bruce in sweats... Johnny's dragging from a
          long workout as they come up to the porch... mid-
            conversation --

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm lucky he didn't arrest me for
                          trespassing...

          Johnny collapses onto the porch...

                                        BRUCE
                        Hey... we're just getting
                        started... walking's not enough...

          Bruce picks up a medicine ball on the porch...

                                        BRUCE
                        ...got to keep your upper body
                          developing...

          He throws it to Johnny who can barely hold it up...

                          I didn't sleep again last night...
                        my mind... won't shut down...

                        How'd you know it was me?  Don't

                        I'm picking you up in twenty
                          minutes.

          He hangs up the phone, shakes his head at the whole thing.

          as Johnny hangs up the phone.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe he's going to arrest me
                        after all.



          Several marked and unmarked police cars parked in front...
          forensic technicians are moving in and out (mostly out)
          of the house carrying their gear... Johnny and Walt get
          out of his patrol car and move toward the door...


          DANA)*

          As Johnny comes out, he is accosted by a photographer and
          Dana Bright...

                                        DANA
                        Mind if I ask you a few questions,
                        Mr. Smith?

          The photographer has one of those cameras that take sixty
          shots in a few seconds... 

                                        JOHNNY
                        I... I have nothing to say.  

                                        DANA
                        Is it true you were just released
                        from a mental hospital?

          Johnny stares at her a beat and walks away... she looks
          up to see Walt exit, saying good-bye to Allison...

                                        WALT
                        Just send me a bill for any
                          damages, okay.

          Allison acknowledges.

                        The usual "No Comment," Sheriff?  

          He gives her a dark look.  The muscle in his jaw twitches
          vaguely.  When he notices Dodd and some of the forensics
          guys snickering at him...

                        day at work trying to figure out
                        how we screwed up so badly...
                        well, not we but you... when
                          suddenly the whole Zen of what
                          happened became crystal clear...

                        I'm a master compared to you so
                        zip it up.  Life is about moments
                        of time strung together... take
                        one moment out of the string,
                        change one detail, turn left
                        instead of right, and all of life
                          changes.  Now look here...

          He moves to the side of the road...

                                        BRUCE
                        This is where Allison said she
                        parked her car... she gets out
                        and opens the trunk to get some
                        of her books out, right...?

          He mimes her movements...

                                        BRUCE
                        She walks to the door.  

          He walks toward the door.

                        If you're the guy, where are you?

                        I don't know... maybe somewhere
                        over here...

          He moves to the left of the door where she might not see
          him.  Then crosses the walkway to the right...

                        Or here...

          And now he reaches the same spot we saw the boots the
          night before... as he does --


  5151THE SCENE FREEZES FOR A MOMENT - (OPTICAL)

          and we pivot around to find Johnny as the man in the slick
          vinyl raincoat standing there... thunder rolls... but it
          is not raining yet...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Here.  This is where he was.

          He's watching Allison walk toward the door... she talks
          to him in her own voice but the words are Bruce's... now
          it begins to rain...

                        I'm strolling to the door.  Only
                        I never get there because of you. 
                        You pull me into the bushes.  I'm

          The phone inside her house starts to RING as it did the
          night before... Johnny reacts, still doesn't understand...

                        I hear the phone... and what do I
                        do?

          She runs into the house as we saw her do... right past
            Johnny...

                        for like the fifteenth time trying
                        to find her.  She didn't get there
                        in time to answer it.

                        He only kills outside.  In the
                        rain.  Once she was inside, she
                        was safe.

                        End of story.

                                (off Bruce's look)
                        He had a compulsion to kill that
                        night, Bruce.  If it wasn't
                        Allison... then he killed someone
                        else.

          Off Bruce's reaction...

          As we remember it from the murder night... thunder and
            lightning... the man in the slick vinyl raincoat stands
          outside Allison's bedroom window... she's inside, taking
          off her clothes... moving around to find Johnny in the
          raincoat... we can hear his heart pounding...

                        He's frustrated.  Angry.  Like a
                          predator who's lost his prey.

          They react as they see it's starting to rain, quickly say
          'good night' to each other.  Two of the women run between
          rain drops away together; the third, a blonde, moves alone
          around the side of the theater toward the parking lot.

                          theater.  Right around the corner

                        This is... Johnny Smith... he's
                        helping out with one of our
                          cases...

          Johnny's eyes are looking past her into the dark house...

                                        HENRIETTA
                        Frank's not here.  You know he
                        always goes up to the pond after
                        bass on his days off... is
                          something wrong..?

                                        WALT
                        Just need to ask him about a report
                        he was working on... maybe he
                        left it in his room...

                                        HENRIETTA
                          I cleaned up his room this
                          afternoon... no reports... just a
                        lot of dirty socks...

          She laughs at her own joke.

                                        WALT
                        If we could just come in and look
                        for a minute...

          Johnny doesn't wait for her permission... he starts to
          walk by her but her hand shoots out and grabs him by the
          arm... as they touch THE SCENE FREEZES FOR AN INSTANT...
          and as we PUSH IN to Johnny...

          She tries to block him... he moves her out of the way.
