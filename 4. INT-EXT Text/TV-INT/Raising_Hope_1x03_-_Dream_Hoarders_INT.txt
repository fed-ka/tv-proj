      "Istanbul" by The Four Lads is playing on a record player. *
      Burt is drinking a beer and watching Maw Maw play Jenga. 
      The tower is ridiculously high.  She has a very serious look
      on her face and her tongue is sticking out of the side of
      her mouth like Michael Jordan and she bops along with the
      music.  She moves a piece and the tower stays intact.  Burt
      can't believe it.  Virginia enters through the front door in
      her maid's uniform carrying a lamp.

                                    BURT
                    How was work?

                                      VIRGINIA
                    Great.  The Gittlemans are remodeling
                    so they put all their old stuff out
                    on the curb for the help to fight
                    over. 

      Virginia kisses him.

                    I almost got my hands on a combination
                    TV/VCR but their exterminator blasted*
                    me with some ant spray.

                                    BURT
                          (licking his lips)
                    I thought you tasted a little poisony. 
                          (re: Maw Maw)
                    Hey, have you seen this?  As long as
                    I have this song on she can't lose. 

      Maw Maw pulls out a brick.  The tower doesn't move. 

                                      VIRGINIA
                    I know.  It's weird how music kicks
                    in certain things with her brain.  I
                    found out the other day that "America
                    the Beautiful" makes her poop faster.    

      Jimmy enters with Hope from the hallway.  He also has a box
      of sugar cubes.

                                      JIMMY
                    Check it out.  I taught Hope a trick.  

      Jimmy puts Hope on the ground and then puts a sugar cube on
      the ground a few feet in front of her.  She starts to crawl
      towards the bowl.       Raising Hope         1ARY02       "Dream Hoarders"2.

                    She's crawling!  I taught her to
                    crawl.  

                                      VIRGINIA
                    Are you kidding me?  We're all
                    exhausted from taking care of that
                    baby as it is.  You taught it how to
                    move?  Good Lord.  I hope she doesn't
                    get into things the way you used to.

      Virginia exits into the kitchen.  We see Jimmy's P.O.V. as
      he looks around the room and sees various hazards.  He sees
      a cluster of extension cords against the wall.  

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

      Jimmy looks over and sees a box of matches on the floor in
      the dining room.

      Jimmy's P.O.V. carries us to the kitchen where there are a

      The shot transitions back to present day where Jimmy shuts
      the cupboard.  

                                      JIMMY
                    We're gonna have to do some serious
                    baby proofing around here.  

      Virginia is cleaning her new lamp.  

                                      VIRGINIA
                    Oh, God, tell me you're not turning
                    our house into one of those baby
                    proofing nightmares.  I was cleaning
                    a place the other day and I couldn't
                    get in to the cleaning supplies, the
                    fridge, or the medicine cabinet. 
                    They even had a lock on the damn
                    toilet.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      From above, we see Virginia trying to get the toilet open. 
      We time cut a few times to see her trying different methods
      to open it.  Each time she's a little more frantic.  Finally,
      we jump to a cut where she's sitting on the sink in the
      corner.  The door starts to open and she quickly stretches
      out and keeps it shut with her foot.  

                                      VIRGINIA
                    I'm in here!

      Tight on the record which is over and is skipping at the
      end.  Virginia pulls the needle off the record.  Jimmy is
      standing behind her.  Burt is looking at the very tall Jenga
      tower.  Maw Maw is asleep.  

                                      VIRGINIA
                    Jimmy, you can't protect your child
                    from every little danger.  They have
                    to learn from their own mistakes.    

                                      JIMMY
                    Yeah, like how I jumped off the roof

                    Once.  And then you never did it
                    again.  Plus you learned about
                    gravity.

      Virginia exits into her bedroom.  

                                      JIMMY
                          (calling off)
                    What I've learned is I need to protect
                    my child better than you protected
                    me.

      Jimmy picks up the box of matches off the floor.

                                    BURT
                    For the record I thought the umbrella
                    thing was going to work.  The wind
                    was really hummin' that day.  

                                      JIMMY
                    Hey, you're gonna have to move all
                    these pool chemicals out of here. 
                    She can get to this now.            

      Burt looks at the stuff.

                                    BURT
                    I don't have anywhere else to put
                    them.  The back of the truck is full
                    of weed killer.  I guess I could put
                    the weed killer in here if you think
                    that's better.
                          (realizing)
                    Pick your poison.  I just got that. 

      Burt laughs and punches him in the arm.  Jimmy punches him
      back.  Jimmy stares at the chemicals for a beat.

                                      JIMMY
                    Maybe I'll see if Mom will make some
                    room out in the greenhouse.

      Burt looks at him nervously.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      Jimmy is unloading a bunch of baby-proofing items on the
      conveyor belt.  Sabrina is standing at the register.  She's
      writing something on a pad of paper.  She looks up to see
      Jimmy.  Jimmy starts to smile, stops himself.

                    It's called "The Elephant in the

                    that's slowly turning into emotionless
                    zombies.

      They hear it again and follow it to the greenhouse.  They
      both drop down to the ground and look through a hole in the
      shit.  We see Hope happily crawling deeper into the clutter.

      FADE IN:


      Virginia and Burt are looking through the hole in the wall
      of shit.  They can see Hope crawling towards the back of the
      greenhouse.  Virginia hops up.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    Quick, help me get this stuff out of
                    here.

      Virginia goes to move an item and everything shifts a little.   

                                    BURT
                    Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Not a good idea.

      Burt looks and sees that Hope is okay. 

                                      VIRGINIA
                          (panicked)
                    This is bad.  This is really bad. 
                    I'm freaking out a little here, Burt. 
                    I'm not doing good with this.  Think
                    of something.  How are we gonna fix
                    this?  Think.  Think. 

                                    BURT
                    You know I can't think on demand
                    like that.  

                                      VIRGINIA

                                    BURT
                    Stop saying think.  Every time you
                    say think all I can think is the
                    word think.  The word just fills up
                    my whole brain.  Think.  Think. 
                    Think.  It keeps changing colors and
                    sizes.  I can't get past it.

      Virginia lays down on the ground on her back.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    Alright.  Alright.  I'm getting too
                    antsy.  I need to clear my head. 
                    Relax me.  Do my thing.  

      Burt sits down by her head and starts to very gently rub her
      forehead.  She closes her eyes and starts to calm down a
      little.       Raising Hope         1ARY02       "Dream Hoarders"12.

                    Okay, here we go.  If we can't get
                    to the baby we need to get it to

                    How can we get it to come out?

      Burt looks at her sheepishly.

                                      VIRGINIA (CONT'D)
                    You're still just thinking of the
                    word think aren't you?

                                    BURT
                    Yeah.  A little guy with a hand pump
                    just came out and pumped up the word
                    until it exploded into a million

      She closes her eyes and he rubs for a beat.  Her eyes pop
      open.

      We see Maw Maw in a bubble bath with a bathing cap on.  She
      has a TV tray in front of her with a plate of spaghetti. 
      She gives Virginia the thumbs up.  Virginia hurries off.

      From inside the cupboard we see Virginia open the cupboard
      and look for something.  She looks in a few more cabinets.

                    Are we out?  If we're out I could go
                    back to the store.  It's no problem. 
                    I can head right back there while
                    she's still working.

      From inside the cupboard, over a box of sugar cubes, we see
      Virginia look at the sugar cubes box.  

                                      VIRGINIA
                    Yes, we're out.

      She shuts the cupboard.

      Jimmy comes to Sabrina's register.  He's holding a box of
      sugar cubes.

                    Forgot sugar cubes.

                    That's a great idea.  I don't have
                    time now but maybe I'll swing by
                    later for some paper.  How's that

                    Well, I don't know if you can use it
                    or not, but I made you this.

      She looks at it.  It's a good cartoon drawing of an elephant.

                    any paper in my van so I used an old

                    You drew this?  It's really good.

                    Thanks.  I didn't know if your story

                                    BURT
                    No.  Why would you assume that?  Did
                    you hear something?  Did they do a
                    re-draw or something?

      From inside we see that the hose has latched itself onto the
      back of Hope's diaper.  She's lying on her stomach.  Burt
      starts to slowly pull her towards him and she starts to slide
      backwards.  Jimmy and Virginia rush over to the front where
      Burt continues to pull on the hose.

      Virginia is speechless.  Her world is crashing down around
      her.  

                                      VIRGINIA
                    Wh... I don't even... I can't...
                    Burt, I need you.

      She drops to the floor and Burt starts to lightly rub her
      forehead.  Jimmy talks fast and tries to calm Virginia down.

                                      JIMMY
                    I know this is hard for you but what
                    happened yesterday can't happen again. 
                    You guys put Hope in danger because
                    you're living in a fantasy land. 
                    You collect crap for a house we'll
                    never have while Dad is busy checking
                    for winning numbers that he's never
                    going to get.  Now that we have a
                    baby in the house you need to start
                      concentrating on her instead of what
                    you're gonna name your imaginary
                    boat.

                                    BURT
                    We don't have to talk about that
                    anymore.  We agreed on it last night.

                    And what about you!?  

      Virginia gets up and moves towards Jimmy.  He moves around
      the kitchen to stay away from her.

                                      VIRGINIA (CONT'D)
                    You're so busying blaming everyone
                    else, where were you when your
                    daughter got stuck?

                                      JIMMY
                    I was at the store buying things to
                    keep her safe.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    Yeah, the grocery store.  Which is
                    five blocks further away than the
                    hardware store.  Face it Jimmy, we're
                    not the only illusional ones around
                    here.  Your daughter got stuck because
                    you were out chasing after some girl
                    that has a boyfriend.

                                      JIMMY
                    Fine.  You're right.  I'm doing the
                    same thing you guys are and I need
                    to stop.  I need to focus on Hope.        

                                      VIRGINIA
                    You're gonna give up on this girl? 
                    I don't believe it.

                                      JIMMY
                    Well, I am.  We all need to get our
                    heads out of the clouds.  We need to
                    start setting goals we can achieve. 
                    Things that will help Hope.  Like,
                    instead of wasting a dollar a day on
                    the lottery, save it until we can
                    buy a dishwasher that can actually
                    clean her bottles instead of the
                    broken one we use as a place to store
                    Maw Maw's medicine.

      Jimmy opens the dishwasher to reveal it's completely full of
        prescription bottles.  Jimmy keeps talking under the V.O.

                    It took a little convincing but
                      eventually your grandma and grandpa
                      understood what I was talking about.

                    attention to you.

                    For me that means buying all of the

      Burt stands in front of the TV holding a dollar while he
      watches the lotto drawing.  He tosses the dollar in a jar on
      the counter that says, "Dish Washure Fund." There are a few
      crumpled dollars in the jar.

                    something else to do with his dollar.

      Jimmy, Virginia, Burt, and Hope are all eating TV dinners
      with the foil hanging off the tins.  They eat in silence.
      Maw Maw is sleeping on a lawn chair in the dining room.  

                                      JIMMY (V.O.)
                    I'm not gonna lie to you, now that
                    we're living in reality, things have
                    been a little less cheery around the
                    house, but we'll get through it.

      We hear Maw Maw snore.  Virginia gets up and starts looking
      through the cupboards.  On the TV we see the news is on.

                    it, here were last night's numbers.

      They put the numbers up on the screen.  Burt bangs his fist
      on the table.

                                      JIMMY
                    Don't tell me those were your numbers.

                    Could've been.  I do quick picks.  I
                    guess we'll never know.

      Virginia pulls an empty carton of cookies out of the cupboard
      and slams it shut.

                    Dammit!  Somebody ate all the chewy

                    Relax.  I'll go get some more.

      Jimmy gets up to leave and Virginia steps in his way.

                    Oh, no.  You're going to the grocery

                    You better not be.  I drove past a
                    house on Sycamore Street this morning
                    that was throwing away a chair that
                    looked like a high heeled shoe. 
                    Would have looked great in a walk in
                    closet.  I didn't even slow down.

                    Thanks but I was wasting my time
                    anyway.  Statistically, most writers

                                      JIMMY
                    Sure.  I don't know what language
                    some of those words are in, but I
                    think that's what I'm talking about.

                    Thank you.  I needed that.  You're
                    like... you're good.  Where the hell
                    did you learn to be so positive?

                    I guess my parents infected me.

                    You're lucky.  All my parents infected
                    me with was fear, self-doubt and
                    every now and then an actual
                      infection.  My mother wasn't a very

      We're tight on the table as a lottery ticket is slapped down. 
      We see that Jimmy has put it down in front of Burt.  Burt
      looks at the ticket and smiles.  Jimmy is also standing next
      to a chair shaped like a high heeled shoe.  Virginia checks
      out the chair.  She likes it.

      Three-year-old Jimmy is sitting in a high chair eating ice
      cream.  He has a band-aid on his forehead. Teenage Virginia
      and Teenage Burt are washing dishes.

                                      JIMMY (V.O.)
                    Growing up with your grandparents in
                    this house left me with a lot of
                    scars but it also left me with the
                      confidence that no dream is too big. 

      Three-year-old Jimmy watches as Teenage Virginia and Teenage
      Burt talk.

                                      TEENAGE VIRGINIA
                    We're definitely gonna have a
                      dishwasher that works when we get
                    our own place. 

                                      TEENAGE BURT
                    Yeah, a good one too.  One of those
                    where you don't have to rinse anything --
                    stick a lasagna pan in there and
                    boom.

      Teenage Virginia turns to three-year-old Jimmy.

                                      TEENAGE VIRGINIA
                    And we're gonna get you a pet monkey.  

      Three-year-old Jimmy gives them a thumbs up.

                                      THREE-YEAR-OLD JIMMY
                    Monkey!

      Teenage Virginia smiles and dunks a bowl into the soapy water
      and when she pulls it out we...

      His arm is in a sling.

                    I'm telling you it's a great job. 
                    People feel so guilty that we're
                    cleaning their mess that they clean
                    half of it up ahead of time and then
                    they give us free stuff.
                          (to Jimmy)
                    I got you a towel rack today for
                    when we buy own house and you and
                    your pet monkey have your own
                    bathroom.  

      Eight-year-old Jimmy smiles.

                                    BURT
                    I'm not so sure the monkey shouldn't
                    have his own bathroom.  We should
                    look at the drawings again.

      Virginia dunks a plate into the soapy water.  As she pulls
      it out we...

                    She has a boyfriend now, but that
                    doesn't mean she's always going to
                    have a boyfriend.

                                    BURT
                    Yeah, he could die.  People die every
