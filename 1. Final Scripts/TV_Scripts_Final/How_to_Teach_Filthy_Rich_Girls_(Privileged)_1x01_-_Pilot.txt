      Mika s  Love Today  plays.  Loudly.   

      INT. MEGAN S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - NIGHT

      Steam fills the tiny bathroom, we can t see anything until an 
      arm wipes away the fog from the mirror, revealing...

      MEGAN SMITH, 23 and pretty in an understated way.  She pulls a 
      well-worn towel around herself and stares at her reflection.  
      She seems determined.  Like Anne Hathaway in Devil Wears Prada.  
      She picks up:

      A box of AT HOME HAIR COLORING.  The woman on the box has 
      gorgeous, red hair.  

      ON Megan, in the mirror.  She takes a deep breath and instantly, 
      a professional smile appears.  This is what we call Practicing 
      The Pitch.  Half-naked.     

                                  MEGAN
                  Clubbing.  What does it actually mean?  In 
                truth, there are many definitions.

                                                                        JUMPCUT TO:

      INT. MEGAN S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      Megan, now applying the goopy red dye to her hair using the 
      plastic gloves.  It s a mess, but she s doing her best to keep 
      it neat.  Her speech doesn t skip a beat. 

                                  MEGAN
                In medicine, clubbing refers to a deformity 
                of the fingers associated with diseases 
                like lung cancer, or tuberculosis.

                                                                      JUMP CUT TO:

      INT. MEGAN S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      The dye now completely applied, she SCOOPS her hair into a clip 
      and covers it with a plastic showercap.

                                  MEGAN
                Clubbing seals is also a common practice of 
                fur trappers in Namibia...

      PULLS several antiseptic wipes from a cannister.

                                  MEGAN (CONT D)
                This occurs despite the efforts of Alicia 
                  Silverstone who is member of PETA...                                                                                       2.



      WIPES down the bathroom tile, eliminating any traces of dye.

                                  MEGAN (CONT D)
                ... and the lead actress in one of my 
                favorite movies,  Clueless.    

      ORGANIZES the remaining products on her sink and heads out to...

      INT. MEGAN S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

      It s a dump the size of a pea, but organized within an inch of 
      its life.  Megan, still in showercap and towel, makes some ramen 
      noodles over a boiler plate as she continues her speech.

                                  MEGAN
                But today, clubbing has taken on a whole 
                new meaning.  In much the same way the noun 
                 party  was appropriated by the youth 
                culture and transmogrified into the verb 
                 to party -- 

                                  MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                Megan?  You re sounding newscastery again.  

      She stops stirring her ramen, dropping  the voice.  

                                  MEGAN
                I am?  Crap.  

      She plops down on her bed, in front of her laptop and picks up 
      the document beside it.  She re-reads it with a critical eye.

      ANGLE ON:  The desktop, where a cute guy, CHARLIE, is in the 
      video chat box.  He smiles when she comes into view.    

                                    CHARLIE
                Just a little.  And since when is 
                   Clueless  your favorite movie?   

                                  MEGAN
                Since I found out it was my boss s favorite 
                movie and maybe it s because I said 
                   Namibia.   Regular people don t bring up 
                Namibia in every day conversation.  It s 
                hard to make it sound casual.  

                                    CHARLIE 
                So skip that part.  The baby seals thing is 
                a downer anyway.  

                                  MEGAN
                I never said they were babies.  Just 
                regular, grown up seals.  Old seals.                                                                                      3.



                                    CHARLIE
                Does not make it better.  And I hate to be 
                  nitpicky, but wasn t this supposed to be 
                about an actual club opening?  

                                  MEGAN
                Yeah.  

                                    CHARLIE
                And instead you chose to pitch a story about 
                clubbing in general because...?

        Embarrassed, Megan says nothing.  Finally, Charlie realizes:  

                                    CHARLIE (CONT D)
                You couldn t get into the club.  Dude... 

                                  MEGAN
                It s fine!  No big whoop.  This is a better 
                story, anyway.  Covering a club doesn t 
                take much skill.  But dissecting the 
                culture of clubbing?  That s inventive.  

      But clearly she s a little worried.  As she starts crossing 
      stuff out on her document...  

                                    CHARLIE
                Nice showercap, by the way.  

                                  MEGAN
                I m dying my hair red.  You know why?  
                Because red is bold.  Red grabs people by 
                the collar and says:  Promote me!  I m 
                ready for greatness!   

                                    CHARLIE
                Makes me think of Angie Everhart.  Which 
                  inevitably leads to porn. 

                                  MEGAN
                I ve paid my dues, Charlie.  Done the 
                coffee runs.  Xeroxed my butt off.  
                Mastered the conference call which is no 
                small feat.  It s time to earn some cash so 
                I can pay off my Yale loans and get started 
                on my real life.  You can even come out and 
                visit me then, because my real life will be 
                so fun I ll want to share it with the 
                world.  And by share, I mean gloat.    

                                    CHARLIE
                If you get the promotion, would you be able 
                to leave that smoky rat trap you call home?                                                                                        4.



                                  MEGAN
                Welcome to New York, amigo.  This rat trap 
                happens to cost a fortune, and what do you 
                mean smoky? 

      Megan finally looks up and notices... it is a little smoky.  She 
      sniffs.  It smells smoky, too.  What the hell..?  

      She gets up and cautiously moves towards the front door which is 
      when she instantly feels - 

                                  MEGAN (CONT D)
                Heat...  There s heat.  It s fire!  
                          (screaming to her laptop)
                Oh my God, Charlie!  My building is on 
                fire!  What do I do?   

                                    CHARLIE
                Get out of there!

      She frantically starts picking up random items, not sure what  
      to bring and what to leave behind.

                                    CHARLIE (CONT D)
                Hurry, Megan!  

      She grabs the laptop and looks right at Charlie.

                                  MEGAN
                I ll call you later if I don t die.

      She slams the laptop closed and heads towards the escape.  A 
      BEAT when she realizes she is still wearing nothing but a towel 
      and a goopy showercap, but has no time to fix that.   

      EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - MOMENTS LATER

      Megan stands awkwardly on her fire escape clutching her laptop, 
      her boiler plate and two extra bags of Ramen noodles.  

      Beat.  Beat.   

      She looks down through the grate and sees a MOTHER and LITTLE 
      BOY standing below, looking up at her.  

                                  LITTLE BOY
                I can see your va-jay-jay. 

      Megan smiles weakly, and attempts to cross her legs into a 
      pretzel.  WAILING SIRENS of an incoming fire truck fade into...                                                                                       5.



      INT. SCOOP OFFICES - HALLWAY - THE NEXT DAY

      The DING! of an elevator door opening, revealing:

      Megan with BRIGHT RED hair.  Her clothes so new they still have 
      the tags on them.  She clutches her laptop to her chest as she 
      bravely walks down the hallway.  All eyes are fixated on Megan.     

                                  MEGAN
                Hi, Steve.  How s it going?  Barbara... 

      INT. SCOOP OFFICES - DEBRA WURTZEL S OUTER OFFICE - DAY

      Megan sits in one of the chairs, going over her pitch.  Across 
      from her, behind the assistant desk, sits PENNY.  She can t stop 
      staring, which Megan pretends not to notice.  Finally:  

                                  PENNY
                It s just soooo red. 

                                  MEGAN
                I know, Penny.     

                                  PENNY
                Like your scalp exploded into flames... Oh! 
                Is that why you smell all smoky?

                                  MEGAN
                          (sigh)
                Yes, Penny.    

      Suddenly, the door opens revealing DEBRA WURTZEL, late 40s.  She 
      ushers out another young hopeful, giving him a pat on the back.   

                                  DEBRA
                Great work.  Really fun stuff --   
                          (then, off Megan)
                Whoa!  Megan... I didn t recognize you.  
                That is a color.  

                                  MEGAN
                  Everybody loves Lucille Ball, but nobody 
                ever does anything about it, you know? 

      Debra nods, not sure what to say to that, except: 

                                  DEBRA
                Come on in.  Let s hear what you ve got.  

      As they walk into her office, Penny whispers to Jake:

                                  PENNY
                Her head was literally on fire.                                                                                      6.



      INT. DEBRA WURTZEL S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

      Megan is mid-pitch.  She s bull-dogging through it. Debra leans 
      back in her chair, hands under her chin, looking disappointed.  

                                  MEGAN
                ... The term  bouncer  has an equally 
                  fascinating history --

                                  DEBRA
                I m gonna stop you here. Not because I m 
                falling asleep - which I am - but you seem 
                to have totally missed the point of this 
                  assignment, Megan.   

                                  MEGAN
                On the surface, yes --

                                  DEBRA
                There s nothing below the surface. That s 
                what you re not getting.  Scoop is a 
                tabloid magazine.  I m not interested in 
                the anthropological significance of 
                  anything.  I don t even like saying 
                  anthropological significance because it 
                gives people the wrong impression.  

      Megan tries to explain, but Debra holds up her hand.  So much 
      for not being interrupted...  

                                  DEBRA (CONT D)
                Not done yet.  When I ask you to cover a 
                club, that means I want cell phone pictures 
                of models doing coke, or actresses puking 
                up their drinks while adopting children 
                from really sad countries, and before you 
                can ask - NO.  I don t want a story on the 
                really sad country.   

                                  MEGAN
                Sad countries.  Negative.  Okey dokey. 

                                  DEBRA
                This was supposed to be a fluff piece. 

                                  MEGAN
                  Absolutely.  And believe me, it was my 
                  intention to deliver the fluff.  I went to 
                Smash and stood in line for five hours.  
                  Apparently, my Banana Republic trousers 
                were the wrong way to go.  New information.  
                Glad to have it.  So next time --                                                                                      7.



                                  DEBRA
                There won t be a next time.  You re not 
                getting the promotion, Megan. 

      Megan takes this in.  She starts to nod in that methodical way 
      that s odd looking but sometimes helps stop people from crying. 

                                  MEGAN
                Okay.  That s fair. 

                                  DEBRA
                And I can t keep you in your current 
                position any longer.  

                                  MEGAN
                Right, so... what? 

                                  DEBRA
                It s been ten months.  I ve kept you this 
                long because I like you.  You re bright and 
                  hardworking and exceptionally quick with 
                the coffee.  But we ve hit the wall, honey. 

      Megan can t help it - her eyes begin to well up.  Uncomfortable, 
      Debra looks for a tissue box, but all she has is the damp  
      napkin sitting beneath her iced latt .  She hands it to Megan.   

                                  MEGAN
                I m sorry.  It s just, my apartment burned 
                down last night.  Did I mention that?  The 
                whole building.  Poof!  Gone.  So that 
                  happened.  And now this is happening.  I m 
                being fired from a job I didn t even want 
                in the first place. 

                                  DEBRA
                What do you mean you didn t want it? 

                                  MEGAN
                I mean, of course I wanted it, but maybe it 
                was for the wrong reasons.  Like stability 
                and a cute business card.  Your magazine is 
                great, but it s not the kind of writing I 
                  ultimately want to do.  This internship was 
                just supposed to put me on track.  

                                  DEBRA
                 So what do you want to write about,  she 
                asked, wishing she could get back to her 
                own work...  

      Megan takes a moment.  It s a fair question and one she hasn t 
      asked herself in a while.  Then, very simply:                                                                                       8.

                People that matter.  People who are changing 
                the world through art or diplomacy or 
                science.  Years from now, I want to be 
                sitting across from Hillary Clinton sharing a 
                mug of jasmine tea while she explains her 
                theories on education reform.  And when we re 
                done, I ll write the biography on this 
                  country s first woman president and be able 
                to tell my daughter I played a part in 
                  America s history.  

                                  DEBRA
                You have a daughter? 

                                  MEGAN
                My future hypothetical daughter which is 
                about as likely as my Hillary interview 
                given the fact that I haven t had sex in 
                two years and I m a homeless person with 
                  Peppermint Patty hair.  Everything is bad. 

      Debra can t help but smile.  But Megan feels silly.  She stands:

                                  MEGAN (CONT D)
                I m sorry, Ms. Wurtzel.  Thank you for the 
                  opportunity.  I really did learn a lot. 

      She starts to walk out, but Debra stops her.  

                                  DEBRA
                Here s the thing.  There are no tracks.  
                You want to write about fancy people, you 
                gotta travel in fancy people circles.  Get 
                to know them.  Get them to trust you.  

                                  MEGAN
                Thanks.  I ll check out fancypeople.com and 
                see if they have any internships available.  

                                  DEBRA
                Or I might be able to help.  Tell me, have 
                you ever flown on a private jet before?  

      Megan looks at Debra who clearly has an idea brewing.  And from 
      that arch in her eyebrow, it s a doozy... 

      EXT. PALM BEACH - DAY

      Over various GLAMOUR SHOTS of Palm Beach we hear:                                                                                       9.



                                  DEBRA (V.O.)
                A dear friend of mine is interviewing 
                people right now.  It s not a writing 
                  position, but academic excellence is a 
                must. If you get the job, you d be mingling 
                with the richest people in the world.  
                Leaders of industry, heads of state, 
                  Hollywood moguls.  The job itself might not 
                be glamorous, but your surroundings will 
                be.  Those who know the area refer to it as 
                Palm Beach.  Those who live there simply 
                call it... The Island.  

      As a private jet lands on the runway... 

      EXT. LES ANGES - MORNING

      TIGHT ON a pair of dirty Keds as they step out of a limousine.  
      PULL OUT to reveal Megan as she takes in her surroundings.

                                  MEGAN 
                Whoa.      

      CONTINUE PULLING OUT to take in the spectacular enormity of the 
      estate called LES ANGES.  Megan s hair is already starting to 
      explode from beneath its tightly wound band thanks to the moist 
      heat.  She tries to smooth it down as the DRIVER appears beside 
      her, taking her crappy, canvas bag.   

                                  MEGAN (CONT D)
                  Humidity.  It s the work of the devil.  

      INT. LES ANGES - FOYER - MOMENTS LATER

      Megan is ushered down the marble floored hallway by the driver.  
      The squeak of her shoes echo, but she cannot contain her awe.

                                  MEGAN
                I m gonna assume everything that looks real 
                is real.  Even that Picasso.  Which 
                normally I would say  No way can that be 
                real!  but I m guessing this one is.  

                                  DRIVER
                Yes.

                                  MEGAN
                So cool.  Is that me squeaking? 

                                  DRIVER
                Yes. 

      As she tries to soft-shoe down the hall, they round a corner...                                                                                    10.



      INT. LES ANGES - LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

      A door is opened revealing LAUREL LIMOGES, early 60s, waiting 
      inside.  She radiates elegance and warmth and the vitality of a 
      woman half her age.  She speaks quickly, with great energy.    

                                  LAUREL
                Megan Smith.  Fantastic that you re here.    

                                  MEGAN
                Hello, Mrs. Limoges...    

                                  LAUREL
                Call me Laurel.  
                          (then, noticing)
                Solid handshake.  I like that in a woman.  
                And your hair is wonderful.  Red is a very 
                bold choice.  You re not afraid of many 
                things, are you? 

                                  MEGAN
                Snakes.  And sharks.  Mainly just those two 
                things.  Oh, and terrorism.  So, snakes, 
                sharks and terrorism.  

      Megan wishes she could swallow those last two sentences, but 
      Laurel seems charmed.  Her smile puts Megan at ease. 

                                  LAUREL
                Relax.  Debra already warned me you were 
                quirky.  What s more, I despise interviews 
                so the quicker we turn this into a chat the 
                happier we ll both be. Can I get you 
                  anything?  Marco makes the most heavenly 
                peach bellinis. 

      Before Megan can answer, Laurel hits an intercom button:

                                  LAUREL (CONT D)
                Marco?  Can we get a plate of chocolates 
                and two bellinis?  
                          (back to Megan)
                I m obsessed with chocolate.  My mother 
                used to send me to school every day with a 
                Hershey bar in my lunch bag.  It was 
                  extravagant, but it was something special 
                she could manage for me.  And even when we 
                couldn t manage, she found a way.  

                                  MEGAN
                Did you grow up in Palm Beach?                                                                                    11.



                                  LAUREL
                I grew up in Hancock, Maine.  My father 
                owned a locksmith business and was always 
                being called away in the middle of the 
                night because someone had locked themselves 
                out of their house and he was the only 
                person within 100 miles who could rescue 
                them.  I used to want him to ride up on a 
                white horse to complete the metaphor.  So 
                yes, I am really screwed up when it comes 
                to men.      

      Megan laughs, spontaneously.  Which catches her off guard.  She 
      wasn t expecting this woman to be so real. 

                                  MEGAN
                You seem like you ve done pretty well for 
                  yourself.  With or without a man.

                                  LAUREL
                With for awhile.  And now without.  My 
                husband passed away several years ago.  A 
                year after, my daughter and her husband 
                were killed in a plane crash.  Suffice it 
                to say, I do not miss the nineties.   

                                  MEGAN
                I m so sorry -- 

      The BUTLER enters with the plate of chocolates and a phone.

                                  BUTLER
                Excuse me.  Senator Martinez on the line.  

                                  LAUREL
                          (to Megan)
                Right.  This ll just take a second.  
                          (then, into phone)
                Mel, it s not gonna happen... Yes, I know 
                you re waiting for my check, and I m 
                waiting for your help with the school for 
                Cuban refugees...  Because it s a pet 
                project of mine, that s why... Why don t we 
                continue this conversation on the dance 
                floor Saturday night.  Oh, and if you see 
                Ted by the water cooler, tell him to keep 
                his tennis balls out of my pool, would you?  
                Thanks.    

      With that, she hangs up.  Megan is awestruck.  

                                  MEGAN
                Ted as in... Kennedy?                                                                                       12.



                                  LAUREL
                Great senator.  Lousy neighbor.  Where were 
                we again?  

                                  MEGAN
                The nineties.

                                  LAUREL
                Right.  So.  My dear husband left me a 
                small cosmetics company which I turned into 
                a large cosmetics empire.  And my daughter 
                left me two grandchildren.  Twin girls.  
                Rose and Sage.  Which is why you re here. 

                                  MEGAN
                          (confused)
                You want me to take them?  

                                  LAUREL
                I want you to teach them.  They re 
                  delightful teenagers.  Strong spirits and 
                good hearts.  But their grades are lousy.  
                They need a proper tutor.  Someone who can 
                guide them through their coursework.  Keep 
                their GPA up and ultimately land them spots 
                at Duke.  

                                  MEGAN
                Duke is a great school.  

                                  LAUREL
                But not as good as Yale.

      Megan blushes, unsure if this is a test.  Laurel smiles.  

                                  LAUREL (CONT D)
                You should be proud.  Graduating magna cum 
                laude is quite an accomplishment.  Although 
                how you wound up working at a tabloid rag 
                after that is a bit of a mystery.  

                                  MEGAN
                I know.  Turns out, a Yale degree doesn t 
                  guarantee you a staffwriter gig at the 
                Atlantic Monthly.  Having connections is 
                more important than having good grades.  

                                  LAUREL
                And having money is more important than 
                both of those combined, but we pretend that 
                isn t the case.  Idealism keeps us young.                                                                                      13.



                                  MEGAN
                I m pretty sure I lost my idealism in the 
                fire.  Along with my good butt jeans.  

                                  LAUREL
                I think we can find you another pair.  

                                  MEGAN
                Thank you.  But the thing is... I ve never 
                taught anyone anything.  I m a writer.  

                                  LAUREL
                The girls are in school most of the day.  
                That time can be spent however you wish. I 
                doubt you ll have a problem finding things 
                to scribble about in our little community.  
                It s full of terrible people who love 
                talking about themselves and all the wicked 
                things they do.    

                                  MEGAN
                Like preventing Cuban refugees from 
                  attaining economic independence? 

                                  LAUREL
                See?  Spunky.  I want you to take this job.  
                Room and board are covered, and a vehicle 
                at your disposal.  I ll give you fifteen 
                hundred a week, and if you succeed in 
                getting my girls into Duke I ll cover the 
                  remainder of your college loans.  Before 
                you answer, let me show you the room you d 
                be staying in.   

      INT. LES ANGES - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

      Laurel opens a door and Megan peeks inside.  The room looks like 
      a suite at the Four Seasons.  Megan speaks without thinking: 

                                  MEGAN
                Yes.  Yes.  A thousand times yes. 

      Laurel smiles.  Then checks her watch. 

                                  LAUREL
                  Fantastic.  You should meet the girls right 
                away.  School starts next week and I m 
                fairly certain there was a summer reading 
                list floating around?  You might want to 
                make sure they re up to speed.                                                                                      14.



                                  MEGAN
                  Absolutely.  Um, do you want to introduce 
                me to them, or --

                                  LAUREL
                I would, but I have three angry Parisians 
                waiting for me.  The French are always late 
                for dinner, but surprisingly punctilious 
                when it comes to conference calls.  The 
                girls are down the hall, sixth door on the 
                left.  Wonderful meeting you, Megan.  

      Laurel gives Megan another warm smile before disappearing down 
      the stairs.  Megan looks into her room again.  

                                  MEGAN
                I love you, Room. 

      Newly invigorated, she walks down the hall. When she gets to the 
      6th door, she takes a deep breath, smiles, knocks and --

      INT. ROSE AND SAGE S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

       -- opens the door.  If Megan s room was a suite, this is an 
      oasis.  Two California king-sized beds sit on their own little 
      dais at least 20 feet apart from each other.  Before Megan can 
      even take in the spectacle she says, loudly:    

                                  MEGAN
                Good Morn --

      Suddenly, a figure pops up from underneath one of the billowy 
      comforters.  The sleep mask covering her eyes does not stop her 
      from grabbing the TASER GUN under her pillow and ZAPPING the 
      shit out of Megan.  She falls down like a french fry.    

      The girl on the other side of the room slowly rises from under 
      her comforter and assesses the situation.  Then, with a sigh:

                                  ROSE
                Wake up, Sage.  I think you just tased our 
                new tutor. 

                                                                          FADE OUT.

      INT. LES ANGES - KITCHEN - MORNING

      To save time, let s assume every room in this place is awesome.  
      Megan is currently propped up on a bar stool at the center 
      island, looking faint from her recent Taser attack.  

      Eyeing her from across the room is MARCO (late 30s) and his too-
      too fabulous boyfriend, KEITH (late 30s).  Picture Will and 
      Jack, if they had wound up together.  

                                  KEITH
                Did the Taser do that to her hair?  

                                  MARCO
                I m going to assume so...

                                  MEGAN
                I can hear you.  I m not deaf.  Breathing, 
                however, is surprisingly difficult. 

                                  MARCO
                We re so sorry.  Here.  Have some Eggs 
                Benedict a la Marco.  

                                  KEITH
                Or don t, if you care about keeping that 
                pretty little figure.  Beyonc  would weep 
                for your tush.

                                  MEGAN
                Wow, really?  That s so nice.     
                          (then)
                Who are you?  

                                  KEITH
                I m Keith.  That s Marco.  We re your very 
                own welcoming committee.  Welcome!  Now try 
                the coffee.  It s the best in town.  

      As Keith pours her a cup...

                                  MEGAN
                No offense, but we re in Palm Beach.  I 
                hardly think that this is the --
                          (she sips)
                Yup.  Best coffee ever.  In my life.  Ever. 

                                  KEITH
                That s my baby s special brew.  He s gonna 
                have his own five star restaurant someday 
                and drown me in diamonds and pearls.  I 
                can t wait to quit my day job.                                                                                    16.



                                  MARCO
                Keith is a stylist at one of our premier 
                salons.  He loves his day job.  

                                  KEITH
                I ADORE my day job, but it s still a j.o.b, 
                you know what I m saying, honey? 

                                  MEGAN
                My j.o.b. just shot me in the face. 

                                  KEITH
                It s a Taser.  You ll live.  
                          (to Marco)
                Now can we please take five more seconds to 
                discuss the Varvatos problem?  We cannot be 
                wearing the same designer to the first 
                event of The Season.  

                                  MARCO
                          (explaining to Megan)
                The Season is a big deal around here.  It s 
                  a pretentious way of describing -- 

                                  MEGAN
                -- a series of charity ball events hosted 
                by the rich and famous whose proceeds go to 
                the poor and miserable. 

                                  KEITH
                Ooo.  She s bitchy.  I love her.  

                                  MARCO
                I see you ve done your research. 

                                  MEGAN
                Well, I didn t actually need to research --  

      Before Megan can further explain, we hear the sounds of 
      approaching high-heels.  Keith shudders.  

                                  KEITH
                The monsters have risen from their gilded 
                cages.  Must flee. 
                          (to Marco)
                You have three days to find a new outfit 
                and I love you. 

      Keith quickly downs the rest of his coffee and walks out right 
      as two of the most gorgeous 16 year old creatures waltz in.                                                                                      17.



      Meet ROSE and SAGE BAKER.  In SLOW MOTION, no less.  Non-
      identical, but equally hot.  Intimidating without saying a word.  
      Rose approaches Megan while Sage approaches the fridge.  

                                  ROSE
                You must be Megan.  We are sooo sorry --

                                  SAGE
                Where are the raspberries? 

      As Marco hurries over to the fridge to find the berries: 

                                  ROSE
                -- It s just that everyone knows not to 
                come in our room before noon, so Sage was 
                just being safe by shooting you.  

                                  MEGAN
                It s hard to argue with safety.  
                          (then, starting over)
                I m Megan.  Your grandmother hired me --

                                  SAGE
                We know who you are.
                          (giving her a once-over)
                Jesus.  I puke cuter than that outfit 
                you re wearing. 

                                  MARCO
                Be nice, Sage. 

                                  SAGE
                I am.  Constructive criticism saves lives, 
                Marco.  Speaking of which, someone stopped 
                taking their Propecia... 

      As Marco checks his bald spot in the toaster oven, Rose 
      continues to Megan: 

                                  ROSE
                Also, we re under strict orders to get 
                eleven hours of sleep otherwise we would 
                have totally gotten up earlier to meet you.  

                                  MEGAN
                          (genuine concern)
                Oh, I didn t realize.  Are those doctors 
                orders, or --?

                                  ROSE
                Our photographer.                                                                                      18.



                                  MARCO
                Rose and Sage have a photo shoot coming up 
                for OceanSide magazine.  It s a very big 
                deal.  In fact, why don t you girls show 
                Megan the wardrobe choices? 

                                  MEGAN
                Or we can go over the books you read --  

                                  ROSE
                We didn t read any.   

                                  MEGAN
                So just the wardrobe then.  Yay! 

      Megan forces a smile and follows Rose upstairs.  Sage lags 
      behind, bored.  She throws Marco a look before exiting.

                                  SAGE
                She fits in about as comfortably as a 
                splinter in my ass cheek.  

      And she s gone.  Off Marco, back to his bald spot...

      INT. ROSE AND SAGE S BEDROOM - DAY

      TIGHT ON two doors opening to reveal THE BEST CLOSET EVER.  
      Megan steps inside, trying not to let her jaw hit the floor. 

                                  ROSE
                ... It s a really huge honor.  Usually, the 
                magazine only picks one girl to feature at 
                the beginning of the Season, but they said 
                they would make an exception for us. 

      Megan brushes past a sweater and suddenly, BEEPS and FLASHES 
      start going off around her causing her to crash into several 
      racks of clothing and shoes.  

                                  MEGAN
                Sorry... Ouch.  Pointy shoes.. 

                                  SAGE
                          (annoyed)
                Great.  You just activated the Oracle.  

                                  MEGAN
                 Who is the Oracle?   
                          (then, inner geek)
                  High-Five on the Matrix reference!  

      The girls do not high-five.  Megan lowers her hand.                                                                                      19.



                                  ROSE
                The Oracle is our wardrobe database.  

      Rose heads over to their computer station and turns on the 40 
      inch flat screen monitor.  We see Megan s picture on screen.  A 
      few clicks here and there, and she s a computerized dress up 
      doll.  It s ultra high-tech, and impossibly cool.   

                                  ROSE (CONT D)
                Sage built it last year.  It helps us keep 
                track of what we wore, when we wore it and 
                who we wore it with.  That way we never 
                have repeats.  Plus it s faster to mix and 
                match virtually, and a lot easier on the 
                skin.  I chafe easy.  

                                  MEGAN
                Wow, this is advanced.  You really made it 
                  yourself, Sage? 

                                  SAGE
                Why are you so surprised?  Did Laurel tell 
                you we were stupid or something?   

      Megan senses she s entering hot button territory and decides to 
      quickly retreat. 

                                  MEGAN
                No, not at all. In fact, she was excited to 
                discuss the books you guys read.  Or didn t 
                read, as it turns out.   

                                  SAGE
                We only had to pick one so that we could 
                write a book report later, or whatever.

                                  MEGAN
                One book.  Great.  That makes it easier...

      A slightly concerned Rose goes through some papers on the desk 
      and hands the summer reading list to Megan.    

                                  ROSE
                We were planning to do it, but then we got 
                so busy...  

      Megan skims the list.  Her Type A personality comes busting out.  

                                  MEGAN
                Okey dokey.  Not a problem.  We have five 
                days and one of your choices is The Great 
                Gatsby, which is a favorite of mine.

                Nine chapters, so we ll do three a day - 
                one in the morning, two in the afternoon 
                leaving the evening for discussion.  Day 
                Four we ll construct a different thesis for 
                each of you so by the time you start 
                school, you ll be ahead of the curve--

                                  SAGE
                          (to Rose)
                Did she say  okey dokey?  

                                  MEGAN
                This is great.  I am loving this plan.  
                Grab your books and let s meet in the 
                library in 4.2 minutes to read the preface 
                  together.  All right, Team Baker?  Woo! 

      With that, Megan walks out, full of energy.  The girls stand 
      there, like a hurricane just hit them.  

      INT. LES ANGES - LIBRARY - 16.8 MINUTES LATER

      Megan sits by herself.  

                                  MEGAN
                The  woo  killed it.  Next time, no  woo.         

      INT. LES ANGES - KITCHEN - DAY

      Marco is slicing and dicing when Megan walks in, high strung.

                                  MEGAN
                Marco, have you seen the twins?    

                                  MARCO
                They left.  Something about meeting makeup 
                artists for the shoot yadda yadda.  We re 
                gorgeous billionaires blah blah.  I swear, 
                if they weren t my ticket to owning a cafe, 
                I d have had them killed years ago.  

                                  MEGAN
                Sounds fair.  But I need to get them 
                started on this book, or we won t have --

                Let s put that neurosis in neutral, shall 
                we?  The girls will be back.  Meantime, why 
                don t you take the new car out for a spin?  

      He throws her a set of car keys.  Megan considers them.  

                                  MARCO (CONT D)
                 This is Palm Beach, baby.  Live a little.                                                                                       21.



      INT. MEGAN S AUDI - DAY

       Xanadu  plays as Megan expertly makes her way through the 
      streets.  (That s right.  Xanadu.)  Megan happily sings along.

                                  MEGAN
                A place!  Where nobody dared to go..!  

      She checks out the fancy dashboard. 

                                  MEGAN (CONT D)
                Oh, Car.  I may love you even more than 
                Room.      

      She turns up the music and VROOMS ahead... 

      EXT. PALM BEACH ROAD - DAY

      The AUDI heads down Southern Beach Blvd taking us out of the 
      ritzy Palm Beach and onto I95.  She dials her cell, then: 

                                  MEGAN
                Charlie? 

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                Hey!  How d it go with the interview?  

      EXT. FORT LAUDERDALE ROAD - DAY

      40 miles never looked so far apart, as Megan makes her way down 
      one of the main streets of Fort Lauderdale.  

                                  MEGAN
                It went well.  Ish.  

      She rounds a corner...

      EXT. CARLO S CRAB SHACK - CONTINUOUS

      ... and attempts to parallel park in front of this local 
      hotspot.  Great food without the tourists.  It s hip without 
      being pretentious.   

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                So were you out all night celebrating?  

                                  MEGAN
                Not exactly.  

      She gets out of the car and walks inside.                                                                                     22.



      INT. CARLO S CRAB SHACK - CONTINUOUS

      The place is busy, but Megan finds a small table near the back.   

                                  MEGAN
                I didn t actually get the Scoop job.  But 
                Debra recommended me for a different 
                position which I did wind up getting --   

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                I wanna hear all about it.  Lemme call you 
                when I m out of work, okay? 

                                  MEGAN
                No problem.  But before you hang up, would 
                you mind taking my order? 

      Suddenly, the waiter standing a few feet away turns around.  

      Meet CHARLIE HOGAN. The Lloyd Dobbler of his generation, but 
      with a tan.  He grew into his looks after high school, which 
      makes him appreciate them more but rely on them less.  

                                    CHARLIE
                Holy Shiite.       

      He turns off his bluetooth and beelines for Megan, pulling her 
      into a bear hug.  It s sweet.  

                                    CHARLIE (CONT D)
                What are you doing here?  

                                  MEGAN
                  Officially?  I m the new tutor for 16 year 
                old billionaires, Rose and Sage Baker.  
                  Unofficially, I m dying for a chowder bowl. 

                                    CHARLIE
                You re working for the Baker twins?  How 
                did that happen?    

                                  MEGAN
                  Technically, I work for their grandmother 
                Laurel, who is amazing.  Not at all what 
                you d expect.  She s exactly the kind of 
                person I could write a book about someday 
                from a uniquely feminist perspective --

                                    CHARLIE
                Easy there, Paglia.  I m still processing 
                the first part.  The  I m a tutor for evil 
                twin billionaires  part.                                                                                    23.



                                  MEGAN
                They re not evil.  I mean, yes, they tased 
                me, but that was mainly a precautionary 
                measure.  And even though the taller one 
                does seem to possess a certain Eva Braun 
                quality, it s not like I can afford to be 
                picky right now.  I m homeless, remember? 

                                    CHARLIE
                My job comes with a hairnet.  I don t judge.
                          (then, cautious)
                Does your dad know you re back? 

      Megan s shoulders noticeably tense up at the mention of her 
      father, but she tries to play it cool.

                                  MEGAN
                First of all, I m not  back.    Sure, I m 
                back in the state, but states are awfully 
                large.  It s not like I ll be running into 
                Pops at the Bath & Tennis Club --    

      Before Charlie can argue, they re interrupted by a too-handsome-
        for-his-own-good SLICKSTER.  Early 20s, oozing charm and money.   

                                  SLICKSTER
                I hate to interrupt, but we ve been waiting 
                for our check --

                                  MEGAN
                Sorry.  It s my fault...

                                  SLICKSTER
                          (to Megan)
                You look familiar.  Do we know each other?  

                                  MEGAN
                Don t think so.      
                          (then, to Charlie)
                I should go.  The girls will be back soon--

                                  SLICKSTER
                          (offering his hand)
                It was lovely meeting you.

                                  MEGAN
                Except we didn t actually meet.  I ll call 
                you later, Charlie.  

      With that she walks off.  Charlie looks at Slickster.                                                                                    24.



                                    CHARLIE
                Gimme two more seconds and I ll knock five 
                bucks off your check.  

      Before Slickster can answer, he rushes out...

      EXT. CARLO S CRAB SHACK - CONTINUOUS

      ... and up to Megan.  He stops in his tracks when he sees how 
      smokin  the car is.  She smiles, loving it.  

                                  MEGAN
                Oh yeah.  I got all kinds of bling going.  

      And then she accidentally sets off the alarm.  Oopsie.  

                                    CHARLIE
                Very nice.  Look, about your dad --

                Charlie --

                                    CHARLIE
                It s just, I see him around, you know?  And 
                your sister...

                                  MEGAN
                Oh my God.  Please don t tell Lily.  That s 
                the last thing I need right now.  

                                    CHARLIE
                So you want me to lie to your whole family? 

                                  MEGAN
                  Omission, Charlie.  Lie by omission.  And 
                if you start to feel guilty, just remember 
                the key point.

                                    CHARLIE
                Which is? 

      She flips her shades down and gets into the car.

                                  MEGAN
                I m not back.  

      With that, she shuts the door.  Off Charlie, all kinds of 
      smitten.  And we re not just talking about the car... 

                                                                          FADE OUT.

      INT. LES ANGES - KITCHEN - NIGHT

      Marco is flipping through a tabloid, waiting for his duck to 
      roast when Megan rushes in.  Without looking up: 

                                  MARCO
                  Downstairs.  Gym.  

                                  MEGAN
                Thank you! 

      She runs off.  Marco shakes his head sadly at the picture.

                                  MARCO
                          (re: magazine)
                Poor Rumer Willis.  She never wears it 
                better.

      INT. LES ANGES - GYM - MOMENTS LATER

      State of the art, of course.  Complete with treadmills, pilates 
      reformers and gyrotonics machine.  The girls, in matching 
      spandex, are finishing up their cardio when Megan walks in. 

                                  MEGAN
                How s the workout going, ladies?  Ready to

                  Actually, this is just the tip of my nerd 
                iceberg.  Now let s go.  We ve got studying 
                to do --

                And we have thirty more minutes of core 
                work left.  Sorry.  

      Megan takes a moment, not sure how to proceed. 

                                  MEGAN
                Look, I m not gonna play this game.  You 
                have a book to read, and my job is to make 
                sure you finish it.  So tell me the best 
                way to make that happen and I ll do it.    

      Sage pointedly ignores her.  Rose feels badly and tries to break 
      the tension.                                                                                      26.

                Have you ever tried gyrotonics before? It s 
                so fun.  It will totally change your life. 

      Megan recognizes the challenge in Sage s eyes and decides the 
      best way to earn her respect is to show no fear.  

                                  MEGAN
                I m always up for a little life changing. 

      Rose helps Megan strap herself into the machine.  It s clunky 
      and awkward.  As she attempts to work out:

                  Interesting theory.  The man does own a lot 
                of shirts.  But you might want to read the

                Okay.  Great.  Is Hemingway one of your

                puts on a summer reading list?  Nice.   

      Megan doesn t know whether to be impressed or horrified.  Rose 
      looks uncomfortable by all the smarty pants talk.

                behind your back!?  That s awful!  

                                  MEGAN
                No, that s Lily.  And it actually happened 
                in front of my face so I got to watch the 
                whole thing.  Extra fun for me.  

                                  ROSE
                Were boobs involved? 

                                  MEGAN
                Sadly, yes.     

                                  ROSE
                That s the most tragic thing I ve ever 
                heard.  Even worse than when Max threw a 
                sheep at me on the same day he threw a 
                  groundhog at Melissa.                                                                                     28.



                                  SAGE
                First off, it was a ham not a sheep, and B, 
                Max is a douchebag.  You re way too good 
                for him, Rosiepants.  I told you that.    

      Rose beams from her sisters  love and Megan smiles.  They may be 
      rough on everyone else, but they re sweet with each other.   

                                  MEGAN
                You guys are lucky.  I d give anything to 
                have the kind of relationship with Lily 
                that you two have.  It s really rare.    
                          (before it gets too mushy)
                Almost as rare as the love between Gatsby 
                and Daisy... 

      As they continue to work out their bods and their minds... 

        ESTABLISHING SHOT -  PALM BEACH - MORNING

      Sun.  Sand.  Ocean.  This place even wakes up gorgeous... 

      INT. LES ANGES - MEGAN S BEDROOM - MORNING 

      Megan wakes up to the smell of a perfect french roast.  Her 
      frizzy head emerges from her comforter to find a silver tray 
      with croissants, beignets and a pot of coffee beside it.  

                                  MEGAN
                I m so happy.  

      INT. LES ANGES - LIBRARY - MORNING

      Now fully dressed and de-frizzed, Megan sits in the library 
      going over her lesson plan for the day.  The Great Gatsby is 
      open on the couch beside her.   

                                  LAUREL (O.S.)
                "What ll we do with ourselves this 
                  afternoon? Cried Daisy, and the day after 
                that, and the next thirty years?"

      Megan is startled to find Laurel standing a few feet behind her.  
      She smiles at the interruption. 

                                  LAUREL (CONT D)
                Get a job, I used to say.  The idea of 
                  contemplative aristrocrats drove me batty 
                when I was young.  Of course, then I became 
                one, and my opinion changed.

      Megan laughs.  Laurel does not.  Megan s laugh becomes a cough.                                                                                      29.



                                  LAUREL (CONT D)
                So.  How is it going with my girls?  

                                  MEGAN
                Great.  We re still finishing the book.  
                  Actually, starting it, and then we ll 
                finish it.  There s a whole plan in place.

                                  LAUREL
                I m sure there is.  But don t fret.  You re 
                not being graded on your lesson plans.

                                  MEGAN
                Thank you --

                                  LAUREL
                -- You re being graded on their grades.  
                How they achieve the A is of little 
                  importance to me.  But if they fail, you 
                fail.  Or was I not clear about that? 

      Megan starts to sweat a bit.  Clearly, it s not all chocolate 
      and bellinis with her new boss.  

                                  MEGAN
                No.  You were.  I mean... that makes sense. 

                                  LAUREL
                  Fantastic!  Now I m off to meet the 
                  caterers.  The first ball of The Season and 
                they thought they could get away without 
                stone crabs.  Can you imagine? 

                                  MEGAN
                I can t imagine how you stay sane given all 
                you have to do every day. 

                                  LAUREL
                It s only the appearance of sanity that 
                counts, dear.  Remember that.   

      With that, she walks off.  Megan watches her go, impressed, then 
      opens a clean page of her notebook.  

      She scribbles: The Unauthorized Biography of Laurel Limoges - 
      Appearance Is Everything.   As a smile creeps onto her face...  

      INT. ROSE AND SAGE S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      The door is partially open, but Megan knocks anyway, extra loud, 
      trying to be funny.  Their moment yesterday has emboldened her.                                                                                      30.



                                  MEGAN
                It s Megan.  Don t shoot!  I know it s 
                early, but I was thinking we could... 

      But the girls aren t there.  

                                  MEGAN (CONT D)
                  ... not get any work done again.   

      INT. LES ANGES - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

      Megan rushes in...

                                  MEGAN
                Marco, do you know where --? 

      ... but stops when she sees THE SLICKSTER!  He s sharing a plate 
      of eggs with Marco, looking unbelievably sexy in his sweaty, 
      tennis whites.  His real name, as it turns out is --

                                  MARCO
                Megan Smith, meet Will Phillips.  Will, 
                this is Megan.  She s the new tutor.  

      From behind Will, Marco mouths to Megan: 

                                  MARCO (CONT D)
                HE.  IS.  GORGEOUS.  

                                  WILL
                A-ha.  A formal introduction.  Now you ll 
                have to shake my hand.  

      As Will goes in for the handshake, Marco continues to mouth: 

                                  MARCO
                          (now confused)
                DO YOU KNOW HIM?  

      Megan shakes her head  NO  at Marco, which she then tries to 
      play off as shaking dandruff out of her hair.  It s weird.  

                                  WILL
                Do you have water in your ear? 

                                  MEGAN
                I was going for dandruff in my hair, but 
                yours is better.  What are you doing here?                                                                                     31.



                                  WILL
                I live next door.  I like to drop by after 
                my tennis lessons just in case Marco has 
                anything amazing cooking in the kitchen.  
                Which he always does.    

      Will turns to Marco who smiles. 

                                  MARCO
                You re very sweet.  Did I mention Megan is 
                an aspiring writer?   

      Intrigued, Will turns back to Megan, allowing Marco to mouth: 

                                  MARCO (CONT D)
                HAVE BABIES WITH HIM. 

                                  WILL
                Really?  What kind of writing?  

                                  MEGAN
                Um... all kinds, really --

                                  WILL
                Then you have to meet my dad.  He used to 
                run Random House before he started his own 
                  publishing company.  But you probably knew 
                all that since you re from here -- 

                                  MARCO
                You re from here? 

                                  MEGAN
                No.  Not here.   

                                  WILL
                You know about Carlo s Crab Shack, which 
                means you have to be a local.  

                                  MEGAN
                I grew up in Ft. Lauderdale but I haven t 
                lived there in years.  And I ve never lived 
                here, so the point is I m not  back  which 
                I feel is an important distinction.  

      Marco looks at her like she s insane.  Which she kinda is. 

                                  WILL
                So you ve been doing the long distance 
                thing with your boyfriend?  

                                  MARCO
                You have a boyfriend?!                                                                                     32.



                                  MEGAN
                He s not my boyfriend.  He s my friend.  I 
                don t have a boyfriend.
                          (realizing how that sounds)
                Not that anyone cares.  Or I care.  I don t 
                care.  I mean, I could ve dated Charlie 
                years ago, but I didn t want to risk losing 
                the friendship.  So... yeah.  That s what 
                happened there.    

      Beat.  Beat.  Then, very casual: 

                                  MEGAN (CONT D)
                Have you seen Rose and Sage?  

                                  MARCO
                They left for their photo shoot.  

                                  MEGAN
                That s today?  Crap.  I really need to work 
                with them... 

      Will chuckles at her frantic state, which irks her. 

                                  MEGAN (CONT D)
                Are you mocking me?   

                                  WILL
                Not at all. I think you re cute. 

                                  MEGAN
                And I think patronizing and mocking live 
                together in a very small house. 

                                  MARCO
                Why don t you go down to the shoot?  You 
                can probably get a few hours of work in 
                while the lights are being set up.  

                                  MEGAN
                Great idea.  Where s the shoot? 

                                  WILL
                I can take you. 

                                  MEGAN
                That s okay.  I can drive myself.  

                                  WILL
                I m sure you can, but it ll be faster if I 
                drive.  Trust me.                                                                                        33.



      Marco starts mouthing so quickly it s impossible to even 
      understand what he s saying.  Off Megan, amused...

      INT. DOLPHIN STADIUM - VENDOR AREA - DAY

      A football game in progress, Will finishes paying for popcorn, 
      beers and some hot dogs while Megan scours the stadium looking 
      for the girls. 

                                  MEGAN
                The girls didn t mention the shoot was at a 
                football game. 

      Will s eyes twinkle flirtatiously.  Megan realizes she s been 
      duped.  Furious, she walks away.  Will rushes to catch up.

                                  WILL
                Wait!  C mon...

                                  MEGAN
                You think it s funny, but I m gonna lose my 
                job over this and unlike you, I don t have 
                a trust fund to fall back on.  Some of us 
                actually need to work. 

                                  WILL
                I m down with working.  Seriously.  Wait.  

      He holds onto her arm to prevent her from walking further.  

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                There s no way those girls were gonna do 
                homework while they re in the middle of 
                their first photo shoot.  Sage would have 
                skinned you alive just for showing up.     

      Megan thinks about this.  He s right.  She then realizes his 
      hand is still holding her elbow.  He notices it, too and quickly 
      moves it away.  

                                  MEGAN
                I take it you know them pretty well.

                                  WILL
                I know lots of folks.  From all different 
                circles.  That s what makes me so smart. 

                                  MEGAN
                If you were really smart, you d know I m 
                not a football kinda girl.                                                                                       34.



                                  WILL
                  I figured.  But the Dolphins are playing 
                and I happen to have awesome seats. 

                                  MEGAN
                Of course you do. 

                                  WILL
                Do I detect judging in your tone?  Because 
                judging and small minded-ness live together 
                in a very small house. 

      She can t help but smile as he leads her...

      INT. DOLPHIN STADIUM - MOMENTS LATER

      ... down the rows of seats towards the field.  Yes, his seats 
      are on the 50 yard line.   

                                  WILL
                Actually these seats are a future tax write-
                off, so I don t feel bad about spending the 
                hundred grand.  It s all work-related.  

                                  MEGAN
                If you tell me you want to be a football 
                player I m going to laugh.  I won t want 
                to, but it will be unavoidable. 

      Will smiles and points out the photographers on the field.

                                  MEGAN (CONT D)
                Sports photography? 

                                  WILL
                It s crazy competitive.  Pretty lucrative, 
                too, but that s not why I like it.  

                                  MEGAN
                Why do you like it?

      ANGLE ON: The football field, as photo-journalists get into the 
      fray, snapping wildly, risking limbs for the perfect shot.  

                                  WILL
                 Cause it s all about instinct.  People 
                think it s about being in the right place 
                at the right time, but it s more than that.  
                It s what you do when you re there.  No 
                time to think about angles or lighting.  No 
                waiting for inspiration to strike.   You 
                take action or you miss the moment.  And 
                when it s over, it s over.  No do-overs.                                                                                      35.



      Megan can t help but be impressed. 

                                  MEGAN
                I tend to miss my moments.  More of a 
                stewer than a do-er, as my dad would say.  

                                  WILL
                What s your dad do? 

                                  MEGAN
                Drinks too much.  Wallows in the past.  Fun 
                stuff like that.  

                                  WILL
                You close with him?

                Not really.  You? 

                                  WILL
                Not really.  
                          (then, eye twinkle)
                Look at that.  Something in common.

                I m not sure having a messed up 
                  relationship with your father is enough 
                common ground to warrant a date.  

                                  WILL
                I didn t ask you on a date.    
                          (off Megan s blushing)
                But I might...

      It s getting hot in here.  Mercifully, Megan s cell phone rings.  

                                  MEGAN
                Hello? ... Sage?  What s wrong?  Slow 
                down... I m on my way.  

      Off Megan, rushing towards the exit...

                                        ACT FOUR

      INT. PHOTO SHOOT - DAY

      A basic warehouse space, with a cheesy backdrop and a stripper 
      pole in the center.  A mess of LIGHTS, MAKEUP ARTISTS, and 
      ASSISTANTS running around make it look busy.  

      Megan arrives expecting a life or death situation, only to find 
      Sage wearing something so skimpy it would make Tyra blush. 

                                  SAGE
                Thank GOD you re here. 

                                  MEGAN
                What s wrong?  What happened? 

      She quickly grabs a clipboard away from the PHOTOGRAPHER S 
      ASSISTANT and thrusts it in Megan s hands.

                                  SAGE
                We need your signature.  Apparently, being 
                under 18 is like a thing to these people. 

                                  MEGAN
                This is the life or death situation?  What 
                am I signing? 

      The assistant tries to explain, but Sage cuts her off. 

                                  SAGE
                  A waiver.  Just do it.    
                          (to the photographer)
                Our guardian is here and she s clearly over 
                21.  If her crows feet don t make it 
                obvious enough you can check her license.

                                  MEGAN
                Where s Rose? 

                                  SAGE
                Rose is hiding because she knows if I see 
                her I m going to take my mascara wand and 
                shove it so far up her nose, she ll have to 
                buy another new one.  Nose, not mascara. 

                                  ROSE (O.S.)
                I said I was sorry!  I forgot!  

                                  SAGE
                  Unacceptable! 

                                  MEGAN
                What did she forget?                                                                                     37.



                                  ASSISTANT
                They were supposed to get a signature from 
                their mother --

                                  SAGE
                  Grandmother.  Our mother is dead, thank you 
                very much.  Feeling stupid yet? 

      Megan is momentarily stunned.  It s not often Sage allows such  
      a raw emotion to come to the surface.  For the first time, she 
      seems like a real girl in pain.       

                                  MEGAN
                Sage... 

                                  ASSISTANT
                I m sorry.  Their grandmother was supposed 
                to sign the form before they showed up.  
                It s basically like a permission slip.

                                  MEGAN
                So why don t you just call Laurel?  

                                  SAGE
                We already did, but she s in a meeting and 
                not taking calls.  Which is fine because 
                all we need is someone over 21 who s 
                  responsible for us.  It s no big deal.   

      Megan is about to sign the form when she spots Rose peeking out 
      from behind a dressing curtain.  She s dressed equally 
      scandalous, but unlike Sage she looks terrified.  She clearly 
      doesn t want to be doing this.   

      Megan puts down the pencil.  Sage lets out an exasperated sigh. 

                                  SAGE (CONT D)
                I m seriously gonna kill you.

                                  MEGAN
                I just want to see if they have any other 
                outfits.  Didn t you guys bring clothes 
                from home? 

                                  ASSISTANT
                Kevin is insisting on the Cavalli.  The 
                other stuff didn t work.   

                                  MEGAN
                Well you can tell Kevin that I don t think 
                this works.  For one thing we need about 10 
                more yards of fabric.  Preferably the kind 
                that I can t see through.                                                                                        38.



                                  SAGE
                This is not happening... 

                                  MEGAN
                And that pole you ve got over there better 
                be for firemen, because these girls are not 
                getting on it.  

                                  ASSISTANT
                Are you messing with me? 

                                  MEGAN
                Do I look like I m messing with you?  

      The assistant sighs and walks over to the PHOTOGRAPHER.  As she 
      relays the information to the clearly agitated man, Sage sticks 
      her fingernails into Megan s arm.

                                  MEGAN (CONT D)
                Ow ow ow... 

                                  SAGE
                What are you doing?  

                                  MEGAN
                I m trying to stop you from doing something 
                I think you re going to regret...

                                  SAGE
                The only person who s gonna regret this 
                moment is you.  

      With that Sage walks away.  Megan turns towards Rose but she s 
      scurrying towards her sister, avoiding any eye contact with 
      Megan.  Sigh.  She dumps the waiver in the trash and walks out.

      EXT. FORT LAUDERDALE - LOW INCOME HOUSING - DUSK

      Sad houses with crummy lawns.  Megan s new car looks out of 
      place as it cruises towards a small home.  She allows the car to 
      idle in front as she DUCKS DOWN.  

      INT. MEGAN S CAR - CONTINUOUS

      ANGLE ON Megan crouching as far underneath her seat as possible.  
      After a moment, the passenger door opens.  She looks up to find: 

                                    CHARLIE
                Do you think your dad hangs out in front of 
                my house or are you afraid of carjackers?  

                                  MEGAN
                Just get in.                                                                                    39.



      INT. SHENANIGANS - LATER 

      A dive bar where the local kids hang out.  Charlie is well known 
      and well loved.  Megan sucks her drink through a straw:  

                                  MEGAN
                ... Obviously, you gotta be willing to cut 
                the girl some serious orphan slack.  And I 
                am.  I feel badly for her.  It s just that 
                while I m feeling badly, I also feel like 
                giving her a huge wedgie.  Is that wrong?   

                                    CHARLIE
                          (attempting to help)
                Just because she had a bad thing happen 
                doesn t give her the right to be a bitch.  
                Your mom left you when you were seven. 

                                  MEGAN
                Not by dying.  By choice.  Which I used to 
                think was worse, but now I m not so sure.  
                And they didn t just lose their mom.  They 
                lost BOTH of their parents.  I d be angry, 
                too.  I wouldn t be a slutty ho-bag, but 
                I d be pissed.  More alcohol, please. 

      Charlie calls over to the pretty bartender, MADISON. 

                                    CHARLIE
                Madison?  Can we get another Jack and Coke?  

      She flashes a flirty smile at him as she heads over.   

                                    MADISON
                Whatever you need, CK1.  
                          (then, to Megan)
                Didn t you go to my high school? 

                                  MEGAN
                Public high school by definition belongs to 
                the state, so it couldn t have been yours.  
                But I did attend Franklin High if that s 
                what you re asking.   

                                    MADISON
                          (to Charlie)
                Are you sure she needs another?  She seems 
                pretty wasted already. 

                                    CHARLIE
                That s not wasted.  That s just her.

      Madison pours the drink and walks off.  Megan watches her go.                                                                                      40.



                                  MEGAN
                Why does she call you CK1?  

                                    CHARLIE
                It s a long story. 

                                  MEGAN
                Like a sex story? 

                                    CHARLIE
                Okay, now I am cutting you off --

                                  MEGAN
                No!  Wait.  Let s go back to my slutty 
                orphans.  What am I gonna do?  

                                    CHARLIE
                Do their homework, collect your paycheck 
                and get some of your own writing done.  It 
                doesn t sound like the grandma cares how 
                they get their grades -- 

                                  MEGAN
                She doesn t!  That s what s crazy.  I 
                thought she was this really cool person, 
                and maybe she is, but she s not winning any 
                  parenting awards, know what I m saying?  

                                    CHARLIE
                But you re not their parent either.  Or a 
                  relative.  Or even someone they ve known 
                for more than 48 hours. 

                                  MEGAN
                It s a good point.  And I m happy you bring 
                it up.  The thing is, I don t know why I 
                care.  I just do.  

                                    CHARLIE
                Because you think you can save them.

                                  MEGAN
                No.  A little.  But not in the Woody Allen  
                  hooker-saving way.  These girls are smart.  
                They can do so much more with their lives 
                than they realize.  And if I can help them 
                live up to their potential, what s wrong 
                with that?  I mean, maybe they need me. 

                                    CHARLIE
                Or maybe you need them.                                                                                     41.



                                  MEGAN
                So what if I do?  People who need people 
                are the luckiest people in the world.

                                    CHARLIE
                Hey, if you re just using them for the 
                  connections, that s cool --

                                  MEGAN
                I m not using them!  Jesus, Charlie.  I m 
                lost, okay?  This was not the plan.  The 
                plan fell apart and now I m just trying to 
                stay afloat and you re making me feel like 
                a bad person.    

                                    CHARLIE
                I m sorry --   

                                  MEGAN
                I don t know how I got here, but I don t 
                have anywhere else to go.  Can you 
                  understand that?  I m out of options.     

      He nods, and Megan goes back to her drink.  Before Charlie can 
      apologize further, Madison returns. 

                                    MADISON
                I hear Fergie is coming to town next 
                weekend.  You going? 

                                    CHARLIE
                Yeah, I m thinking about it. 

                                    MADISON
                Cool.  Maybe I ll see you there.   

      She walks away.  Megan looks at Charlie as if he s a totally new 
      person.  Someone she hasn t known all her life. 

                                  MEGAN
                Look at you with all the moves.  I guess 
                everyone changes except me.

                                    CHARLIE
                That s not true.  You ve changed. 

                                  MEGAN
                I have?  How?                                                                                     42.



                                    CHARLIE
                You used to be the most focused person I 
                knew.  Goal oriented, psychotically 
                  motivated and ambitious.  Now you re all 
                over the place. 

                                  MEGAN
                Is that a good thing or a bad thing? 

                                    CHARLIE
                Maybe it s both.    

      Megan looks at Charlie.  For a moment, it seems like maybe he 
      has more to say.  But... he doesn t.   

      INT. LES ANGES - HALLWAY - NIGHT

      Megan, squeaky shoes in hand, tiptoes towards her room.  She 
      opens the door and is surprised to find... 

      INT. LES ANGES - MEGAN S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

      ... Rose, sitting on her bed, leafing through the books on her 
      nightstand.  She stops when Megan walks in.  

                                  ROSE
                Sorry for stalking.  I just wanted to say 
                thanks.  I couldn t before, because, 
                  obviously.

                                  MEGAN
                Sage would have smashed your head against 
                the stripper pole. 

                                  ROSE
                Right.  But I was glad you came and, like, 
                took over.  I had a feeling it was gonna go 
                down that way.  The photographer had a lot 
                more Google images than you and they were 
                all pretty skanky.   

      Which is when it suddenly dawns on Megan: 

                                  MEGAN
                You didn t forget to give Laurel the form.  

      Rose smiles, sheepishly.  She starts to go, but Megan stops her. 

                                  MEGAN (CONT D)
                You don t have to do everything your sister 
                wants you to.  You know that, right?                                                                                      43.



                                  ROSE
                It s not like that.  I mean, it is, but not 
                because I m scared of her.  I mean, I am, 
                kinda, but that s not the main reason.  

                                  MEGAN
                So what s the main reason? 

                                  ROSE
                I don t want to make her sad.  If I told 
                her I didn t want to do the stuff she wants 
                to do, it d be like I was judging her.   

                                  MEGAN
                Okay.  But what do you want to do? 

      Rose considers for a beat, then: 

                                  ROSE
                I wanna get into Duke.  I think Mom 
                would ve been psyched if that happened.  

      Megan smiles.  

                                  MEGAN
                Then I guess we re gonna have to get you 
                into Duke.  Which means you re gonna have 
                to finish that book. 

                                  ROSE
                I just did and I cannot believe Daisy left 
                Gatsby like that!  How do you walk away 
                from someone you supposedly love? 

                                  MEGAN
                People do it all the time. 
                          (then, a confession)
                I did it.  To my sister.  

                                  ROSE
                Yeah, but that s  cause she snaked your 
                dude.  Totally different. 

                                  MEGAN
                But I left before she did that, remember?  
                The dude snaking happened when I came home 
                for the holidays, which means she probably 
                did it just to get back at me.   

                                  ROSE
                Get back at you for what?                                                                                      44.



                                  MEGAN
                For leaving her alone with our sad dad.  
                Our mom took off when we were kids and he 
                kinda sucked at being a human after that.  
                  I couldn t wait to bail on the whole 
                  situation.  I didn t think twice about what 
                it would mean for Lily.  

      Rose tries to absorb this.  

                                  ROSE
                But you had to go to college.  I mean, you 
                couldn t not go to Yale just to hang with 
                your sister, right? 

                                  MEGAN
                That s what I tell myself.  But lemme ask 
                you this - if you got into Duke and Sage 
                  didn t... would you go?    

      Rose s brain looks like it might explode at the sheer notion. 

                                  ROSE
                You have to get us both in, okay?  

      Megan laughs.  It s almost a hug moment, but luckily there s a 
      knock at the door.  The butler pokes his head inside: 

                                  BUTLER
                Megan?  Laurel wants to see you downstairs.

      Off Megan, knowing this can t be good... 

      INT. LES ANGES - LIBRARY - MOMENTS LATER

      Megan walks in and is not surprised to find Sage sitting on the 
      couch.  Laurel is mixing a martini.  

                                  LAUREL
                Come in, come in.  Can I get you anything?   

                                  MEGAN
                Oh, um...

                                  SAGE
                You re totally fired.  

      Laurel gives Sage a reprimanding look, then turns to Megan.

                                  LAUREL
                Clearly, my granddaughter is upset.                                                                                      45.



                                  MEGAN
                          (relieved)
                Oh.  Phew.  I thought that was real--

                                  LAUREL
                No, no.  You are fired, but that s not the 
                way we let someone go.  Right, Sage? 

                                  SAGE
                I was just trying to be direct.  

                                  MEGAN
                I m not sure I understand...

                                  SAGE
                Yeah, right.  Don t act all innocent --   

                                  LAUREL
                Sage was looking to work with you this 
                  afternoon, but apparently you ve been 
                  disappearing since the moment you arrived.  
                Is that true or false? 

      Megan looks to Sage who raises her brow.  She s screwed.  

                                  MEGAN
                I guess, technically, it s true-ish.  But 
                if you let me explain -- 

                                  LAUREL
                There s no need.  I m afraid it s simply 
                not a good fit.  

                                  SAGE
                That s the understatement of the year.

                                  LAUREL
                All right then.  Your flight leaves in the 
                morning.  Marco will fix you a treat to 
                bring on the plane. 

                                  SAGE
                Which is awfully nice of us, considering.  

      Normally she d let the comment go, but suddenly she realizes - 
      this is her moment.  And she s gonna take action.  

                                  MEGAN
                  Considering what? 

      Sage looks to Laurel, who seems surprised by Megan s tone.                                                                                      46.



                                  LAUREL
                Megan --

                                  MEGAN
                Excuse me, Laurel, but I was talking to 
                Sage.  No offense, but you clearly have no 
                idea what s going on with your own family.  
                Unless you wanted your only granddaughters 
                to be photographed looking like underage 
                porn stars for the entire Palm Beach 
                  community to enjoy.  Maybe next time, 
                you ll pick up the phone when they call.  
                          (then, back to Sage)
                  Considering what? 

      Again, Sage looks to Laurel but gets nothing in return.  She s 
      on her own.  She rolls her eyes.  

                                  SAGE
                  Whatever. 

                                  MEGAN
                Don t stop now.  You re running this show, 
                aren t you?  You decide what happens to me, 
                what happens to Rose...  But with great 
                power comes great responsibility - shout 
                out to Uncle Ben.  So if you re gonna make 
                all the decisions, you better understand 
                the consequences.  You don t care about 
                school, that s fine.  You want to do the 
                wasted heiress routine?  Good for you.  
                It s a little played, but clearly nobody s 
                gonna stop you.  However, you might want to 
                consider your sister before you drag her 
                down the sorry path you re so hell-bent on 
                  cruising.  You can take it.  But I m not so 
                sure about Rose.  
                          (starts to go, then)
                Uncle Ben is Spiderman s uncle.  Not mine.  
                Just wanted to make that clear.  

      With that, Megan walks out.  Off Laurel, watching her go... 

                                                                          FADE OUT.


                                    END ACT FOUR                                                                                    47.


                                        ACT FIVE

      INT. LES ANGES - MEGAN S BEDROOM - MORNING

      MEGAN S POV:  Her sleepy eyes flutter open to find MARCO and 
      KEITH hovering over her, examining her face with dread.     

                                  KEITH
                Hell s bells.  It s worse than I thought.  

                                  MARCO
                Can you do anything to fix it? 

      Megan thinks she must be dreaming until Keith reaches into his 
      man purse and pulls out a tube of Preparation H and begins to 
      dab it under her eyes. Now she s awake. 

                                  MEGAN
                Not that I don t enjoy a good hazing, but 
                it usually comes at the beginning of a job.  
                Not the end.  

      She attempts to swat them away and sits up.  They GASP.

                                  MEGAN (CONT D)
                What?!

                                  MARCO
                Your hair!  It s like a giant, tangerine 
                Chia Pet!  This is never going to work.  

                                  KEITH
                Don t worry, baby.  We can always wig her 
                if we have to. 

                                  MEGAN
                  Seriously, guys.  I have a hangover the 
                size of my Aunt Paula s ass, and my Aunt 
                Paula is not a small woman.  Can you leave 
                me alone?  

                                  MARCO
                I wish that was an option, but I have my 
                orders. 

                                  MEGAN
                Right.  I forgot.  Look, I don t need any 
                plane snacks.  Although, I wouldn t mind a 
                cup of your special brew... 

                                  MARCO
                There s no time for that.                                                                                    48.



                                  MEGAN
                Sure there is.  My flight doesn t leave for 
                three more hours --

                                  KEITH
                Your flight was canceled. 

                                  MARCO
                  Technically, the flight still exists but 
                you aren t going to be on it.  

                                  MEGAN
                What? 

                                  MARCO
                Please don t argue.  I have less than 8 
                hours to get you ready for the first event 
                of The Season and that afro you re sporting 
                is the least of our problems.  

                                  KEITH
                He gets a little Cruella when he s stressed.  

                                  MEGAN
                I don t think you understand.  I was fired 
                last night.

                                  MARCO
                Yes, and apparently rehired this morning.  
                  I received word at 5:00 AM thank-you-very-
                much with instructions to have you ready to 
                attend tonight s festivities.  Your job is 
                to keep an eye on the girls and make sure 
                they don t get into trouble.  Good luck 
                with that, by the way.   

                                  MEGAN
                This is insane.  Where s Laurel? 

      Megan marches out of her room, leaving our flustered duo behind.

                                  MARCO
                Is it too early for a cocktail? 

      As Keith hands him the flask from his sport jacket...

      INT. LES ANGES - LIBRARY - MOMENTS LATER

      Megan walks in to find Laurel standing on a ladder, attempting 
      to find a book on the top shelf.  Before Megan can speak:                                                                                     49.



                                  LAUREL
                  Fantastic.  Can you hold this steady for 
                me, dear?  I am trying to locate a book... 

      Megan, too confused to argue, complies.  

                                  MEGAN
                Okay, but I just came in to ask -- 

                                  LAUREL
                It s called  Leaving Cuba  by Kathlyn Gay.  
                It s not down there, is it?  I want to 
                leave it on Mel s seat tonight... 

      Megan attempts to stay in control of the conversation.  Which is 
      hard to do while holding a ladder.  

                                  MEGAN
                Marco told me that I wasn t fired. 

                                  LAUREL
                That s right.  I ve changed my mind. 

                                  MEGAN
                Why? I mean, what caused that?  

                                  LAUREL
                You did.  Quite bold the way you took Sage 
                in hand last night.  I don t think I ve 
                ever seen anyone try it before.  Maybe it s 
                in the other library...

                                  MEGAN
                You have another libr--?  Wait.  Not the 
                point.  The thing is, Laurel, I can t live 
                this roller-coaster kinda life, always 
                  wondering if I m about to be fired because 
                I told Sage she has to do her homework. 

                                  LAUREL
                  Completely fair, which is why I drew up a 
                  contract.  Barring any illegal activities 
                on your part, I can t fire you for the next 
                six months or you can sue me for all I ve 
                got.  And I ve got quite a lot, haven t I?  
                Two libraries at least.  

      Megan wanders over to the table and sure enough - there s a 
      contract.  Megan is speechless.  By now, Laurel is down.                                                                                        50.



                                  LAUREL (CONT D)
                Have a lawyer read it before you sign.  Oh, 
                and the next time you have an impulse to 
                give me a dressing down - fight it.  

                                  MEGAN
                Right.  Okey dokey then.

      Megan takes the contract and starts to walk out.  

                                  LAUREL
                They need you, Megan.  I can t do it.  I 
                lost their respect much too long ago, and 
                don t have the energy to get it back.  

      Megan catches a glimmer of hurt in Laurel s eyes.  The first 
      we ve seen.  But it passes quickly.  

                                  LAUREL (CONT D)
                What is that goop on your face? 

                                  MEGAN
                I m pretty sure it s hemorrhoid creme.   

      Off Laurel, laughing out loud...

      INT. LES ANGES - MEGAN S BEDROOM - DAY

      Megan enters to find Keith and Marco wading through curling 
      irons, flat irons, and two tons of makeup product. 

                                  MEGAN
                Boys?  We got work to do.  

      Here goes the ultimate movie-makeover montage.  Hair.  Makeup.  
      Clothes.  Shoes.  Fabulous.  You get the idea.  Resulting in... 

      INT. MAR A LAGO - BALLROOM - NIGHT

      ... The most stunning Megan we ve ever seen.  Her entrance does 
      not go unnoticed, and not just because she is having difficulty 
      walking in heels.  Marco and Keith are behind her.  

                                  KEITH
                Glide, dear.  Glide.  

                                  MEGAN
                You glide.  I m balancing the weight of a 
                small country on a pair of toothpicks.  

      She makes her way inside and we catch a few familiar faces:  
      Laurel, Sage, Rose.  Even Charlie, working as a cater waiter, 
      drops his dumplings.  And then Will approaches.                                                                                      51.



                                  WILL
                Not too shabby.  

                                  MEGAN
                Is that supposed to be a compliment -- ? 

      Suddenly, Megan s face turns ashen as a gorgeous YOUNG WOMAN 
      approaches Will s side, slipping her arm into his nook. 

                                  MEGAN (CONT D)
                Oh my God.  

      Her boobs spill out over the top of her dress and her lipstick 
      is several shades darker than it needs to be.  Introducing: 

                                  MEGAN (CONT D)
                Lily. 

                                  LILY
                Hi, Megan.  

      Megan looks to Will, who is clearly not surprised by the 
      exchange.  Instead, he simply grins: 

                                  WILL
                See?  I knew you looked familiar. 

      Off Megan, too stunned to speak...


                                    END ACT FIVE                                                                                    52.


                                        ACT SIX

      INT. MAR A LAGO - BALLROOM - SAME TIME

      Right where we left off.  Megan attempts to act blas  despite 
      the ulcers currently developing in her stomach.  

                                  MEGAN
                You said I looked familiar.  You didn t say 
                I looked like my sister who is apparently, 
                your girlfriend.  

                                  LILY
                Please.  I don t do  boyfriends.   
                          (to Will)
                And she looks nothing like me.  

                                  WILL
                There are similarities.  But I didn t put 
                it together until I found out you were from 
                here.  Then I remembered Lily once talking 
                about an older sister named Megan --

                                  MEGAN
                You talk about me? 

                                  LILY
                Not positively. 

                                  MEGAN
                Of course not. 

                                  WILL
                          (to Megan)
                But when we were talking about your family, 
                you never even mentioned you had a sister --

                                  LILY
                Of course not.

                                  MEGAN
                We weren t  talking about my family  -- 

                                  LILY
                Thanks for calling to let us know you re 
                home.  Dad was so happy to hear from you.

                                  MEGAN
                I m not home.  This is not home. 

                                  LILY
                It s also not New York.  Or did you even 
                live there?                                                                                      53.



      The conversation is cut short by Rose who rushes up with 
      champagne in hand.  She s adorably tipsy.  Sage clocks this,  
      and seems less than pleased by all the bonding.

                                  ROSE
                  Meg-a-poo!  You look so pretty!  
                          (then)
                Hi, Will!
                          (then)
                SO pretty!  
                          (then)
                Do you know Will?  

      Megan takes the champagne from Rose s hand. 

                                  MEGAN
                And we re done with that... 

                                  ROSE
                          (to Lily)
                I don t think I know you.  I m Rose Baker.  

                                  LILY
                I m Lily.  Megan s sister.     

      Rose s eyes pop wide.  

                                  ROSE
                NO.  WAY.  This is so cool, I wanna die.

                                  MEGAN
                Take a number.  

                                  ROSE
                I can t believe you re here!  And Megan 
                looks so pretty so it s all even! Yay to 
                whoever fixed your hair.  

                                  MEGAN
                Rose --

                                  ROSE
                          (to Lily)
                Look, it s not like I m taking sides 
                because obviously it s a super long story 
                but I think if you apologized to Megan for 
                making out with her boyfriend --

                                  WILL
                I m not her boyfriend. 

      All the women look at Will who suddenly realizes the world 
      doesn t revolve around him.                                                                                     54.



                                  WILL (CONT D)
                  Different guy.  Carry on. 

                                  LILY
                You told her about Evan? 

                        MEGANROSE
      No.  Yes.   

                                  MEGAN
                Does it matter? 

                                  LILY
                It does if you only go around telling your 
                side of the story, like you always do. 

                                  MEGAN
                Like I  always  do?  You don t know what I 
                do on a semi-regular basis let alone 
                   always.   

                                  LILY
                And whose fault is that? 

                                  MEGAN
                You re right.  Because phones only work in 
                one direction, Lily.    

      With that Megan walks away, tripping on her heels. 

                                  ROSE
                Good effort!  Who needs more champagne? 

      INT. MAR A LAGO - BALLROOM - BAR - MOMENTS LATER

      We catch up with Megan as she approaches the bar.  

                                  BARTENDER
                What ll it be? 

                                  MEGAN
                It ll be a cold day in hell before I 
                  apologize to her.  Even if I did make a few 
                  mistakes, they could never amount to the 
                level of betrayal that she s capable of and 
                trust me that is a significant amount of 
                betrayal we re talking about.  Brutus.  
                Judas.  Santino from Project Runway.     

                                  BARTENDER
                Whiskey, straight up.                                                                                     55.



      As the bartender goes to prepare the drink, Megan turns around 
      to see Sage standing in the middle of a group of friends.  For 
      the first time she looks uncomfortable.  Almost vulnerable.  

                                  SAGE
                It s not that big a deal.  It was totally 
                low rent, anyway --

                                  MEAN GIRL #1
                That s not what I heard.  

                                  MEAN GIRL #2
                You must be so humiliated.  I can t believe 
                the photographer just walked out like that!

                                  SAGE
                I was the one who walked out --

                                  MEAN GIRL #1
                That s not what I heard... 

      Megan listens from the sidelines.  She can t help but feel 
      badly.  Obviously, the shoot was more important to Sage than  
      she realized.  As hard as it is to be 23, it s even harder to  
      be 16.

                                  MEGAN
                Sage?  

      Sage looks at Megan and attempts to shoot real daggers into her 
      heart with her eyeballs.  It s scary, but Megan persists.  

                                  MEGAN (CONT D)
                Sorry to interrupt, but I wanted to let you 
                know that Annie called me back and we re 
                going to set up the shoot for next week.

      Sage seamlessly transitions into Megan s lie and introduces her.

                                  SAGE
                  Everyone, this is Megan Smith.  Laurel 
                recently imported her from Manhattan to 
                help Rose with her studies. 

                                  MEAN GIRL #1
                What did you do in New York?

                                  MEGAN
                Mainly magazine work, which is how I met 
                Annie.  She rarely works soft news anymore, 
                but when I told her about Rose and Sage, 
                she got excited.                                                                                     56.



                                  MEAN GIRL #2
                Annie who?

                                  MEGAN
                  Leibovitz.  Is there another Annie that 
                means anything? 

                                  SAGE
                Next Saturday should be fine.  

      Megan smiles, feeling pleased with herself.  

                                  MEGAN
                Great.  I ll tell her.  Have fun, you guys.  

      Megan walks off, while Sage returns to her posse of newly eager 
      friends.  But she turns her head for one moment to watch Megan.  

      INT. MAR A LAGO - LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

      Megan is searching for the restroom when Charlie rushes up -- 

                                  MEGAN
                Charlie?  What are you doing here? 

                                    CHARLIE
                Cater waiter.  Carlo got me the gig.

                                  MEGAN
                My sister is in there.   

                                    CHARLIE
                I saw. 

                                  MEGAN
                With Will. 

      Megan doesn t register the hurt look on Charlie s face.

                                    CHARLIE
                How do you know his name?  

                                  MEGAN
                It s a long story.  I have to go hide now. 

                                    CHARLIE
                Megan --

      But she s gone.  So he says to no one in particular: 

                                    CHARLIE (CONT D)
                You look beautiful.                                                                                      57.



      INT. MAR A LAGO - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      A five star powder room complete with satin couches, gilded 
      mirrors, the works.  Several GIRLS vy for the best spot at the 
      mirror, reapplying makeup, etc.  

      Megan enters and sadly realizes the bathroom is not the place to 
      be alone.  She takes her drinks and heads to...

      INT. MAR A LAGO - BATHROOM - TOILET - CONTINUOUS

      One of those stalls that s so big it comes with your own hamper, 
      which turns out to be a great place to put a drink.  Megan sits 
      on the toilet and takes a sip of whiskey.

                                  MEGAN
                This is good.  A little  me  time... 

      She is quickly interrupted when a pair of blood red heels enters 
      frame.  Right under Megan s door.  She pauses.  The feet wait.  
      She slurps.  The foot taps.  Finally: 

                                  MEGAN (CONT D)
                I don t want to do this with you, Lily.  

                                  SAGE (O.S.)
                Who s Lily? 

      Megan exhales a sigh of relief and opens the door. 

                                  MEGAN
                Sorry.  I thought you were my sister.

                                  SAGE
                Hardly.  I just came in to find out what 
                time the shoot is. 

                                  MEGAN
                What shoot? 

                                  SAGE
                The Leibovitz shoot.  

      Megan looks at Sage like she might be dumb after all --

                                  MEGAN
                Sweetie, I didn t actually... I mean, I 
                thought you understood --

                                  SAGE
                Oh, I understood what you were doing.  And 
                now you need to understand what I m doing.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    58.

                                  SAGE (CONT'D)
                I expect a photo shoot with Annie Leibovitz 
                as promised.  Or did you think you could 
                make me a liar and a loser in front of all 
                my friends, sweetie?  

      The bitch is back and the sequel is scarier than the original.  

                                  MEGAN
                I don t know what you want me to say.  I m 
                sorry --

                                  SAGE
                Well, gee, that s not what I want you to 
                say.  In fact, I don t want you to say 
                  anything.  I want you to do.  I m sure 
                you ll figure out a way, what with all your 
                  Manhattan connections.  

      Megan is too stunned to respond.  

                                  SAGE (CONT D)
                Oh, and stay away from my sister.  I know 
                you re dying to be her role model, so you 
                can feel better about your own pathetic 
                  relationship with Slutty McBoobJob out 
                there, but the position is already filled.  
                So back off, or I ll make your life more 
                  miserable than you can possibly imagine.  

                                  MEGAN
                Sage, I really think --  

      But Sage is finished with the conversation.  She smiles.  

                                  SAGE
                  Congratulations on getting to keep your 
                job.  It s gonna be super fun.  

      With that Sage walks out.  Megan leans back, accidentally 
      setting off the TOILET FLUSHER.  

                                  MEGAN
                That would be the sound of my life going 
                down the toilet.  A really fancy toilet.  

      As she knocks back the rest of her whisky... 

                                                                          FADE OUT.
