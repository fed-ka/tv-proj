      FADE IN:


201201EXT. EUROPEAN GARDENS - 1657 - DAY

      A swell of manicured lawn borders an ornamental garden. 
      Bulrushes grow along the edges of a man-made lily pond. 
      On the shore, two men, swords clanging, flashing, clashing.

      MacLeod is battling GRAHAM ASHE, a dashing swashbuckler,
      an Immortal Errol Flynn.  The best swordsman MacLeod's
      ever seen.  MacLeod is struggling, sweating.  He's
      frustrated and tiring but he's not going to give up.  Never
      give up.

      MacLeod feints, and follows up with a QUICK STRIKE... that
      Ashe easily slips -- with a smile to make matters worse.

                                            ASHE
                        A very nice effort, young Duncan
                        MacLeod of the Clan MacLeod.

      MacLeod turns and comes back at him.  Ashe deflects him,
      causing MacLeod to lose his balance and go tumbling.

                                            ASHE
                          Personally?  I'd never use the
                          Thracian Attack on terrain like this. 
                        It was meant only for an uphill
                        strike.

      MacLeod engages in the conversation only because he needs
      a moment to recover and regain his fighting composure.

                                            MACLEOD
                        It is meant for whenever it works.

                                            ASHE
                        Well, it doesn't on level ground,
                        now does it?

                                            MACLEOD
                        I slipped.

                                            ASHE
                          Precisely my point.





                                                                (CONTINUED)96502  "The End of Innocence"  2.    Final Shooting Script 7/11/96



201CONTINUED:201

                                            MACLEOD
                        How do you know what it was meant
                        for?
                              (getting it)
                        Ah.  You're the one who meant it. 
                        You invented it.

      Ashe takes a gracious, elaborate bow.

      MacLeod takes advantage of the lapse to attack and moves
      in quickly.

      Ashe counters with a single swipe that sends MacLeod's
      sword flying.  Disarmed, there is nothing MacLeod can do
      as

      ASHE

      Brings his great sword SLASHING through to MacLeod's neck --

      AND STOPS

      A hair's breadth short of skin.

      There is a moment of genuine suspense and then Ashe bursts
      out LAUGHING and MacLeod joins in.  We see now that these
      two are friends and MacLeod is here learning, not fighting
      for his head.

                                            ASHE
                        It was really Juan Ramirez who
                          perfected it.

                                            MACLEOD
                              (impressed)
                        You knew Ramirez?  Juan Sanchez Villa
                        Lobos Ramirez, Connor's teacher?
                            (off Ashe's nod)
                        I hear there was nothing he couldn't
                        do with a sword.

                                            ASHE
                        Or with the ladies.
                            (a smile)
                        He was one of my better students.

                                            MACLEOD
                        You were his teacher?
                              (blown away)
                        No wonder I'm losing here.

      Ashe flips MacLeod's sword back to him, then kneels to his
      sack and hauls out a wine flask, bread and other goodies
      as they sit on the grass to relax a little.



                                                                (CONTINUED)96502  "The End of Innocence"  3.    Final Shooting Script 7/11/96



201CONTINUED: (2)201

                                            ASHE
                        I'm good, my friend, but trust me,
                        there are better than me out there.
                              (beat)
                        As the Kurgan was better than Ramirez.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Great.  Just my luck, I'll run into
                        them.

                                            ASHE
                        Cheer up, the sword is not what you
                        live for, it's just what keeps you
                        alive for the good stuff.

      He tosses MacLeod some  bread.  As they sit to eat --

                                            MACLEOD
                        Which is?

                                            ASHE
                        There are worlds out there for you
                        to discover, Duncan.  Music.  Art. 
                          Philosophy.

                                            MACLEOD
                        What good is philosophy in a fight?

                                            ASHE
                        We fight to stay alive -- don't forget
                        to live.  Imagine what you can see
                        in a thousand years.  Imagine what
                        you can learn.  The ideas, the
                        questions, the meaning.  It's all
                        there for us, Duncan, because we are
                          blessed.  Blessed beyond reason with
                        the gift of eternal life.  It is
                          something to be cherished not for
                        what it is, but for what it can be.

      He hands MacLeod the wine.

                                            ASHE (cont'd)
                        And every year brings something new --
                        a new vintage, a new fighting move...
                        or a new pattern of flowers on an
                        Italian hillside.  Open your eyes,
                        see it.  Cherish it.

      MacLeod is thoughtful as he swigs the wine, Ashe's message
      sinking in as he savors the flavor, the spring wind across
      his sweated shoulders, the smell of the day.

      Suddenly, they pick up a BUZZ.

      ASHE

      moves up into a crouch to scan the area and spots --

      TWO HORSEMEN

        Approaching.  The first is HARESH CLAY, a turbaned Moor,
      riding tall and strong on charger, an exotic cloak doing
      little to conceal the regal and imposing figure underneath. 
      Beside him rides CARTER WELLAN, his squire, a younger
      Immortal, a pale Briton with straw-colored hair.  He carries
      Clay's standard.

                                            CLAY
                        When the Duke challenges you to a
                        game of darts, your job is to lose.

                                            WELLAN
                        But he was half blind.

                                            CLAY
                              (laughing)
                        But he is still the Duke.

      They laugh.

                                            WELIAN
                              (looking around)
                        My lord.

                                            CLAY
                        I know.

                                            WELLAN
                        We found him.

                                            CLAY
                          Perhaps, my impatient friend.

      ASHE

      Freezes and all the humor is suddenly gone from his face.

                                            ASHE
                        Dear God.  Haresh Clay.

      He signals MacLeod to be silent.  MacLeod is confused. 
      This hardly seems like a courageous command.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Who?

                                            ASHE
                              (urgent)
                        Shhh!  We have to get out of here. 
                        Find some holy ground.


                                                                (CONTINUED)96502  "The End of Innocence"  5.    Final Shooting Script 7/11/96

      He slinks off.

      MacLeod, confused, hesitates.

      Ashe grabs his arm and pulls him along.

                                            ASHE
                        Now!

      MacLeod is astonished to see Ashe fearful, but if Ashe is
      scared, that's clue enough for him.


202202EXT. FIELDS/RUINED CHURCH GROUNDS - 1657 - DAY

      MACLEOD AND ASHE

      Hurrying.  They look back over their shoulders for some
      sign of pursuit but there is none.

                                            ASHE
                        Damn.

                                            MACLEOD
                        I don't see him.

                                            ASHE
                        That's what bothers me.

      MACLEOD AND ASHE

      Come over the small rise just a short distance from church
      grounds and safety.

                                            ASHE
                        We're safe.  It's going to be all
                        right.

      But it's not.  There in front of them, are Clay and Wellan. 
      Ashe stops suddenly.

                                            CLAY
                        Graham Ashe?

                                            ASHE
                        Who?

      MacLeod is stunned by this response.  Ashe sees it.

                                            ASHE
                              (wearily)
                        I am Graham Ashe.

202CONTINUED:202

                                            CLAY
                            (to Ashe)
                        I've been looking for you.  There
                        can be only one.
                              (beat)
                        We were destined to meet one day.

                                            ASHE
                        The best day is always the one you're
                        in.

      Clay couldn't agree more.  He dismounts, a picture of grace,
      his movements bespeaking a quiet grace and power.  He holds
      out a hand toward Wellan.  Wellan pulls Clay's sword and
      hands it to him.  Clay holds it at the ready.

                                            ASHE
                              (pushing MacLeod)
                        Go!
                              (urgent)
                        Get to the church yard and stay there. 
                        And don't come out.

      He shoves MacLeod to get him moving, then draws his sword
      and turns to face Clay.  MacLeod hesitates.

                                            ASHE
                        GO!

      MACLEOD

      Obviously upset and confused, stumbles reluctantly to Holy
      Ground --

      THE CHURCH GROUNDS

      Are hardly more than a gesture.  All that remains is a
      couple of walls and the cemetery.  Just enough to take
      refuge.

      ASHE AND CLAY

      Engage and it is immediately apparent that this is truly a
      contest of masters.

      They exchange blows, testing each other.  It's Ashe who
      finds himself moving backwards, pressed by the attack.

      ASHE

      Is cut, a deep gash on his balance arm.

      MACLEOD

      Is beside himself at the church.  To see someone better
      than Ashe with a sword is astonishing.

      ASHE

      Tries a desperate thrust and Clay disarms him.  He falls
      to his knees, defeated.

      MACLEOD

      Is paralyzed at the church.

      CLAY

      Raises his sword to take Ashe's head.

      ASHE

      Cries out.

                                            ASHE
                        Spare me!

      Clay is startled.  He stays his sword a moment.  He puts
      his sword to Ashe's neck, lifts him, forces him to speak
      louder.

                                            ASHE
                        Yes... please spare me.

                                            CLAY
                              (astonished)
                        You'd beg for your life?

      MACLEOD

      Can't believe what he is witness to.  It is utterly
      shattering to him.

      Ashe swallows any pride, any honor he has left.  He wants
      to live.

                                            ASHE
                            (from the heart)
                        I don't want to die.
                              (desperate)
                          Anything I have to give, I swear it. 
                        Just let me walk away.  I beg you to
                        let me live.

      MACLEOD

      Reels in dismay.  His hero, begging.  It looks for a moment
      like Clay might spare him.  Then --

                                            CLAY
                        No.

      CLAY

      swings, silencing Ashe's pleas.

      MACLEOD

      Presses against the church wall as Ashe's Quickening lights
      the sky behind him.

      CLAY

      Suddenly comes around the wall, Ashe's sword in his hand. 
      Wellan is a few paces behind, holding Clay's horse.

                                            CLAY
                        Scared?
                              (beat)
                        Don't worry boy.  I came for Ashe.

      MacLeod stares at him, still stunned by what he's seen,
      unable to react -- and, in truth, scared to death.

                                            CLAY (cont'd)
                        But I have something for you.

      With utter contempt, Clay takes a huge swing with the sword
      he's holding.

      With no sword drawn to defend himself, MacLeod calls out:

                                            MACLEOD
                        Holy Ground!

      THE SWORD

      Comes smashing down into the huge wooden beam Clay is aiming
      for.

                          A remembrance.

      A frozen MacLeod can only stand and stare at the blade
      above him.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

      FADE IN:


203203INT.  DOJO - DAY

      MacLeod comes straight at the camera, his kendo stick
      slashing fast and furious.

      He's working out, and working up a serious sweat.  He turns
      to start back the other way when he hears a door.

      JOE DAWSON

      An uncertain smile on his face.

      MacLeod stiffens.  He's not happy to see him.  This is an
      awkward and troubled reunion for both of them.

                                            DAWSON
                              (awkward)
                        I just got back in town.

                                            MACLEOD
                        I know.

                                            DAWSON
                        Paris turned out okay.  We're making
                        some changes, Mac.  I think the
                          Watchers are finally moving into the
                          twenty-first century.

                                            MACLEOD
                        You shouldn't be here.

                                            DAWSON
                        There's something else we have to
                        talk about.

                                            MACLEOD
                        No.  No, we don't.

                                            DAWSON
                        I think we do.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Joe.  Just turn around and go. 
                        Please.

                        I'm Immortal and you're a Watcher. 
                        The line can't get crossed anymore. 
                        How many times do we have to be
                        taught?

      Dawson is not backing down.

                        What the hell do you want me to do?
                        I hear stuff and I can't ignore it.
                              (beat)
                        It's Richie.  A few days after...
                        after you left for Paris, he took
                        off too.  Disappeared.

      MacLeod wavers.

      INT. JOE'S - DAY (CLIP FROM "SOMETHING WICKED" SC#41317)

      Dawson is working the bar, facing MacLeod.  Richie is there
      too.  MacLeod is silent a BEAT.  He looks at Dawson.

                                            MACLEOD
                        What do you know about Dark
                          Quickenings?

      Dawson gives him a look.

                                            DAWSON
                        Come on, MacLeod.  You're reaching.

                                            RICHIE
                          Reaching what?
                            (off their silence)
                          Somebody mind filling me in?

      There's an uncomfortable beat.

      EXT.  ALLEYWAY - NIGHT (CLIP - SC#41329)

      MacLeod and Coltec face off.  Instead of their dialogue,
      we continue to hear V.0. the dialogue from Joe's.

                                            MACLEOD (V.O.)
                        When we take heads, we take the
                        Immortal's power.  You take in too
                        much evil, you overload.
                              (beat)
                        You become evil yourself.

      Coltec circles, looking for an opening.  MacLeod slips
      past Coltec's guard -- and takes his head.

      REFRAME

      As the Dark Quickening hits MacLeod.

      INT. DOJO - CONTINUOUS (CLIP - SC#41335)

      MacLeod's eyes gleam with a dangerous light -- he's smiling. 
      He pulls his sword.  Richie backs off.

                        Come on, Mac... What are you doing?

      MacLeod flicks his sword casually.  Richie dodges back,
      winces -- looks down at his chest.

      CLOSE - RICHIE'S CHEST

      there's a line of BLOOD across a slash in his shirt.  Richie
      pulls his bloodied hand away in disbelief.

                                            MACLEOD
                        You're a smart boy.  What do you
                        think I'm doing?

      MacLeod moves purposefully forward.  Richie scrambles back,
      yanking his own sword free.  He tries to fend MacLeod off,
      fighting with every ounce of skill he has.

                                            RICHIE
                          Whatever happened, we can fix it.
                        Don't do this...
                              (beat)
                        I'm your friend, dammit!

                                            MACLEOD
                        Sorry, wrong number.

      He lunges, wounds Richie in the shoulder.  Richie drops
      his sword and goes to his knees.  He tries to reach his
      sword with his other hand -- MacLeod kicks it away.

      Richie is defenseless.  He locks eyes with MacLeod.  Anger,
      pain, betrayal.

                                            RICHIE
                        If you're gonna kill me, I want to
                        know why!  The teacher kills the
                        pupil?  There can only be one?  Why!

      A BEAT of hesitation on MacLeod's part, an inner battle,
      something in there trying to stop him -- then it passes.

                                            MACLEOD
                        That's as good a reason as any.

      He raises his sword to take Richie's head.

      Richie winces, waits for the killing blow.

      MacLeod in the backswing, putting all his force into the
      blow -- there's a GUNSHOT -- and MacLeod staggers back,
      mortally wounded.  He looks up --

      DAWSON

      Stands there, the smoking gun in his hand.

      MacLeod snarls, tries to take a step towards Dawson, raise
      his sword but death strikes first.  He crashes to the floor.


204204INT. JOE'S - NIGHT - LAST YEAR

      The place is empty except for Richie and Joe.

                        On the road.  Headed back into town.

                              (disinterested)

                        He's gonna get himself killed,
                          MacLeod.  You have to talk to him.

      MacLeod is moved, trying not to react.

                                            MACLEOD
                        It's not your business, Dawson.

                                            DAWSON
                        No, it's yours.
                            (off MacLeod's look)
                        Fine.  You don't owe anybody anything. 
                        Not me, not Richie.  We can all just
                        go to hell.

                        you want about it.

      Dawson turns, furious, and leaves.

      MACLEOD

      Frustrated, knowing Dawson is right, watches him go.96502  "The End of Innocence"  14.    Final Shooting Script 7/11/96




206206INT. DELILA'S BEER - DAY

      A local watering hole.  It's run by DELILA herself, a body
      builder.  Sex appeal with muscles, with a cigarette and a
      grin.

      WYATT EARP'S WILD WEST ELECTRONIC SHOOTING GALLERY

      Is blinking and popping as a guy gets beat to the draw by
      an electronic bad guy.

      RICHIE

      Radiating morose, at the end of the bar, nursing a beer. 

      OVER THE BAR

      A stained old sign announces: "BEAT DELILA, WIN A BEER"

      Below it, an off-duty UPS Driver, a middleweight, has an
      elbow on the bar, arm locked with Delila's, struggling to
      push it to the bar.

      Delila's arm is straining, too, but she's acting casual.

                                            DELILA
                        C'mon, Benny, why do you even bother?

      Richie, with a dismissive glance at the contest, mutters:

                                            RICHIE
                        Can't be for the beer.  They should
                        be giving it away.

      DELILA

      Annoyed, takes it out on the Driver, slamming his arm to
      the bar with unnecessary vigor.

      She turns on Richie, irritated.

                                            DELILA
                        Maybe the critic wants to try me?

                                            RICHIE
                            (re the beer)
                        For this?  No thanks.

      Delila reacts, then controls it.  She's a pro at taking
      shit from surly drunks.

                                            DELILA
                        You don't like it, go someplace else.

      Richie puts his arm up on the bar, shooting a look at the
      Driver as he addresses Delila.

                        Let's go, beautiful.

      They lock arms.  Richie's strong, he's been working out,
      this isn't an easy one -- but Delila's a pro at this, her
      arm is locked, unyielding.  Richie strains, seems to be
      gaining the advantage, then --

      THE BUZZ

      Hits him.

      DELILA

      Takes advantage of his distraction to make the extra push
      and bend his arm back.  Victory.

      Richie's pissed.

      CARTER WELLAN

      Waltzes in like he owns the place.

                                            WELLAN
                          Barkeep!  Scotch rocks, a double.

                                            DELILA
                        That's Delila to you, Bud.

                                            WELLAN
                        Delila?
                            (he likes that)
                        In that case I'll have a beer and a
                          haircut.

      He follows the BUZZ straight to Richie.

                                            WELLAN
                        I'm buying.

                                            RICHIE
                            (on edge)
                        I don't need a haircut.

                                            WELLAN
                        How about a sense of humor?

      Richie stands and faces him.  Hard and suspicious and now,
      in a bad mood.

                                            RICHIE
                        How about you shut your mouth before
                        I do it for you?

                              Richie; to Delila)
                        Aren't you scared?

                        Petrified.

      Richie grabs Wellan's arm, turning him back.

                                            WELLAN
                        Do I know you?  Or you just go around
                        looking for trouble?

                                            WELLAN
                        The only head I came in here for was
                        on a beer, but if you want to take
                        it outside...

      Richie pushes in closer.

                                            RICHIE
                              (cold)
                        I want to take it outside.

      He gestures to the door.  Wellan turns and walks out. 
      Richie follows.

      Somewhere down the road.  The station's been forsaken ever
      since the freeway got built several miles to the south.

      RED JEEP WRANGLER

      in mint condition pulls in.  Wellan guns the engine and
      steps out, waiting.

      Seconds later, Richie arrives on his bike.  He too guns
      his engine before shutting down.

                        After you.

      Richie is simmering and Wellan wary.  They make their way
      around to the field behind the station.

      Wellan is still reluctant as Richie draws his sword.

                        Bad joke?  We don't have to do this.

                                            RICHIE

      He attacks and they close with a great clash of swords.


208208EXT./INT. DELILA'S BEER     DAY

      Immortal HARESH CLAY pulls up to Delila's and heads inside. 
      This is an updated Clay, sporting a close-cropped fade,
      gold-hoop in one ear.  Still with the manner and bearing
      of a king.

      Richie and Carter Wellan are going at it with a vengeance. 
      It's a nasty, no holds barred fight to the death.

      They're locked in a death struggle, face to face, hands
      locked on one another's swordarms, muscles straining to
      gain the advantage.

      WELLAN

      Wrenches a knee into Richie's groin and Richie splits away,
      gasping for breath.

      WELLAN

      Lunges but Richie sidesteps him and hammers the passing
      Wellan hard in the kidneys as he goes by.

      The blow straightens Wellan up and leaves him completely
      exposed as Richie turns back and rams the sword home.

      WELLAN

      Slumps to his knees.

      RICHIE

      Raises his sword for the final blow.

      DOWN THE HIGHWAY

      Haresh Clay is running this way when he sees --

      Unsure, agonizing over the outcome, he draws his sword as
      RICHIE thunders by on his screaming bike.

      Furious and horrified by his friend's death, Clay watches
      Richie disappear down the road, and SCREAMS his rage to
      the wind.

      Richie bolts awake from the dream, in his room.  His head's
      intact but he's pretty freaked out.  Sweating, breathing
      hard, and a little disoriented.  He begins to calm down
      and barely gets a chance to catch his breath when he gets
      a BUZZ.

      He grabs his sword and heads outside to discover:

      Waiting for him.  Richie is freaked.  He wasn't expecting

                        Okay, here I am.

      Richie draws his sword.  He ready, on edge.

                        It's me!  MacLeod.

                        I remember you pulling a sword and
                        trying to take my head.

                                            MACLEOD
                        I couldn't stop.  I tried.  Inside,
                        I was someone else.  It wasn't me,
                        Richie.
                              (beat; earnest)
                        But I'm here now.  And I am your
                        friend.

      MacLeod moves to put a hand on Richie's shoulder.  Richie
      knocks it away.

                                            RICHIE
                        I heard that one before.

      MacLeod is stunned, shocked to see this hair-trigger Richie
      he has created.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Put it away.  I won't fight you.

      Richie laughs.  It's a bitter sound.

                                            RICHIE
                        Yeah, right.

      Richie circles, wary and nervous.

                        You know, I used to stay up nights,

                              (beat)
                        I've been practicing.  Next time you
                        pull a sword on me, it won't be so
                        easy.

                        I can't take back what happened,

                        you're doing is wrong and you know
                        it.

      Richie looks at him a long moment.  He's torn.  Deep down
      he knows MacLeod is right, but he's been too badly burned.

                        Thanks for the tip.

      Richie turns his back, heads back to the rooming house.

213213INT. RICHIE'S ROOM - LATER - DAY                             

      Richie is back in his room, brooding.

      He gets the BUZZ just before he hears the knock on the
      door.

                                            RICHIE
                        There's nothing to say, MacLeod. 
                        Just leave me alone.

      SUDDENLY A SWORD

      Comes crashing through the door, splitting it.

      RICHIE

      Jumps up to defend himself.

      A HEAVY FOOT

      Kicks the door and the two halves burst open and fall away.

      HARESH CLAY

      Comes charging in, radiating fury.

                                            RICHIE
                        Who the hell are you?

                        For you, I'm the Angel of Death.

      Richie can't get to his sword on the far side of the room. 
      Clay comes at him swinging.  With a tremendous kick, Richie
      sends the big armchair tumbling toward Clay.

      CLAY

      Keeps coming.

      RICHIE

      Gets his hands on his sword but even before he can lift it
      away from the wall

      CLAY'S SWORD

      Swipes down across Richie's blade -- and BREAKS IT IN HALF.

      RICHIE

      With nowhere to go, he turns and dives through the window.

      Clay goes to the window to see --

      CLAY'S POV

      Richie jumps onto his bike and takes off.


214214INT. MACLEOD'S LOFT - DAY

      From behind, MacLeod is hunched over and then he raises an
      arm and BAM, pounds something.

      CAMERA COMES AROUND to REVEAL MacLeod brooding, lost in
      the repair of an old shield.  Once again he raises the
      small mallet and BAM, brings it down precisely, working
      out a little more of the dent.

      MacLeod's not happy it's Dawson.  He doesn't turn to look
      at him.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Why are you here?

                        It's important.  Richie's in more
                        trouble than I thought.

                        I've seen Richie.  He can take care
                        of himself.

                              (railing)
                        With what?

      Dawson produces RICHIE'S BROKEN SWORD from under his coat
      and in a fury slams it down on the counter --

                                            DAWSON
                        With this!?

      MacLeod reacts.  He picks up the sword, looks at the broken
      blade.

      Presses against the church wall as Ashe's Quickening lights
      the sky behind him.

      CLAY

      Suddenly comes around the wall, Ashe's sword in his hand. 
      Wellan is a few paces behind, holding Clay's horse.

                        Don't worry, boy.  I came for Ashe.

      MacLeod stares at him, still stunned by what he's seen,
      unable to react -- and, in truth, scared to death.

                        But I have something for you.

      With utter contempt, Clay takes a huge swing with the sword
      he's holding.

      With no sword drawn to defend himself, MacLeod calls out:

                        Holy Ground!

      for.

                        I'm trying to help a friend, MacLeod.

      MacLeod is more pained over the loss of Dawson than he
      lets on.

                                            MACLEOD
                        You're not his friend, Dawson.

      MacLeod grabs Dawson's left wrist and exposes the Watcher
      tattoo.

                        This is who you are.

      Dawson pulls his arm away.

                        I know who I am.  I've been a Watcher
                        over twenty-five years.  It's as
                        much a part of me as your clan MacLeod

                        Don't interfere.

      Dawson swallows this.

                          I heard.

                                            RICHIE
                        I guess you would.

                          Something to drink.  On the house.

                          Tequila.  A double.

      Dawson serves it up and Richie downs it.

                                            RICHIE
                        I'll have another.

      Dawson refills his glass.

                                            RICHIE
                        I'm not.  I got rid of the bike.
                            (off Dawson's look)
                          I needed the money, Joe.
                            (a beat)
                        I lost my sword.

                        Broke it.

                        So I've been told.

      This is very embarrassing for Richie, but he takes a breath,
      overcomes his pride and says what he has to.

                                            RICHIE
                        I need another couple of grand for a

                        Then what are you saying, Joe?  You

      Richie's out on a limb here and doesn't like it.

                        I just did it, I pulled the trigger.

      Dawson needs a moment to let that memory pass.

                                            DAWSON
                        Richie, as a friend, I want to help.
                              (displays the tattoo)
                        ... but as a Watcher, I can't.

      He looks at Richie, torn, pleading for understanding.

                                            RICHIE
                        That's real convenient, Joe.  Real
                        damn convenient.

                        The hell with you.

      Furious, Richie storms out.  Dawson stays behind, not
      feeling at all good about himself.


219219EXT. MUSEUM - CITY STREET - DAWN

      It's very early morning.  Barely dawn and the quiet
      dominates everything.  The street is deserted.

      There is nothing going on except for the man trying to
      pick the lock at one of the doors.  A banner at the entrance
      reads:


                                                                (CONTINUED)96502  "The End of Innocence"  30.    Final Shooting Script 7/11/96

      MASTERWORKS OF THE FORGE -- THE SWORDSMITH'S ART.

      THE LOCK-PICKER

      Is Richie and it turns out he's good at it.  A jiggle here,
      a poke there, and he's in.


220220INT. MUSEUM - DAWN

      Richie moves through the place quickly, heading straight
      for the swords.

      The first glance is disappointing.  There are plenty of
      swords around, but they're not what he's looking for. 
      Then he sees --

      ANGLE CABINET

      In which there are four glorious swords.

      This is what Richie's looking for.  Any one of these will
      do, but the cabinet is locked.

      Richie starts picking the lock when he gets the BUZZ.

                                            RICHIE
                        Come on...  Come on.

      He starts to panic.  His fingers fumble with the lock.

      He tries to take a breath to calm down.  No dice.  And no
      time left to fuss with locks.

      RICHIE

      Smashes the cabinet open, setting off the ALARM.

      He reaches in for the most striking of the four swords. 
      It's bolted to the wall!

      He tugs at it but it doesn't budge.  The ALARM is wailing
      and the Immortal is getting closer.

      RICHIE

      Struggles with the sword.  No way it's coming free.  And
      it's too late.

      HARESH CLAY

      Steps into the room.

                                            CLAY
                        I knew you'd show up here eventually.

                        I'm not armed!

                        learn them too late.

      Attacks with a wide open roundhouse swipe.  Too bold by
      half.

      Ducks the blow and rolls behind a display case.

      Raises his sword and brings it down hard on the display

      RICHIE

      Bolts for the back door.


221221EXT. ALLEY - DAWN

      The back door flies open and Richie comes racing out into
      the alley.

      He turns right and runs like hell.

      A COP CAR, lights flashing, turns into the alley just up
      ahead.

      Richie stops.  He looks at the cops.

      He turns back to see:

      RICHIE'S POV - CLAY

      standing at the far end of the alley.

      BACK TO SCENE

      Richie makes absolutely the right choice.  As the cops
      step from their car, he turns back to the cops and raises
      his arms.

                                            RICHIE
                        You got me.

      As the cops push Richie into the car, he turns back and
      blows Clay a kiss.

                        Clay.  I met him once before.

      That does pique Richie's interest.

                        Then how come you're both still alive?


223223EXT. BEACH - DAY

      MacLeod and Richie are off in the distance, walking along
      the beach.  We hear their-conversation in V.0.

                        So, your friend was good.

                        Graham Ashe was a master.  I never
                        saw anyone like him before.  I thought
                        he was the best.  I thought he'd
                        live forever.

                        thought he was.

                        This is not about protecting you,
                        Richie, it's about me.

                        Then you better find him before I
                        do.

      The conversation ends as they find themselves back at
      MacLeod's car.

      MACLEOD

      Hesitates a moment.  Then he opens the trunk and takes out

      ASHE'S SWORD.

      He turns to Richie.

                                            MACLEOD
                        If you get there first... you'll be
                        needing this.

                        It used to belong to Graham Ashe.

      RICHIE

      Hesitates -- this is a problem, it gets him right in the
      heart.  His knee-jerk reaction is to reject the sword.

                                            RICHIE
                        I can take care of myself, Mac.

                        Take it.  Please.

      That stops Richie.  This isn't a command, it's a request,
      man to man.  Richie looks at MacLeod, looks at the sword --
      it's a beauty -- and finds the strength to accept it.

                                            RICHIE

      There's a moment between them -- they're not all the way
      there yet, but a big step's been taken back toward
      friendship, and trust.


224224EXT. THE BIKE EMPORIUM/SERVICE STATION - DAY

      Immaculate, a variety of new and used cycles lined up for
      display.

      The owner, RAYMOND FAIRCHILD, looks more like a surgeon
      than a cycle mechanic as he works on the guts of a bike
      laid up on a stainless steel table.

                                            RICHIE
                        I want to buy my bike back.

      Raymond looks at him, unimpressed.  Turns back to his work
      with a shrug.

                                            RAYMOND
                        Twenty four hundred.

      Richie slaps some cash on the counter.

                                            RICHIE
                        There's the eighteen you gave me.
                        Give me the keys.

      Raymond looks at the money, looks at Richie.

                                            RAYMOND
                        This isn't a pawn shop, kid.  The
                        price is twenty four.

      He points to one of the beat-up bikes in the line.

                          Eighteen'll get you the Yamaha with
                        the busted transmission.  Three
                        hundred more to get her running.

      Richie looks at him for a beat.  Raymond's bent over his
      work, doesn't see Richie's expression.  Big mistake.

                                            RICHIE
                        Maybe you didn't hear me.

      As he speaks, Richie moves along the line of bikes, ending
      up at the gas pump.

                                            RICHIE
                        I said I want to buy my bike back.

                        And I'm really tired of being called
                        kid.

      He pulls the nozzle off the pump, clicks it on, and swings
      it in an arc.

      Gasoline sprays over the line of motorcycles, puddles around
      them.  Puddles around Richie.

                                            RAYMOND
                        What the hell are you doing?

      Richie pulls out a Zippo.

                                            RICHIE
                        Got a light?

      He clicks the flint.  A spark, a flame.  Raymond's eyes go
      wide.  He backs up a step.

                                            RAYMOND
                        You're not gonna throw that.

      Richie holds the lighter, ready to toss it into the pool
      of gas.

                                            RICHIE
                        You think so?

      He's got him.  Raymond pulls out the keys, tosses them to
      Richie.

      Richie nonchalantly tosses him the still-flaming lighter
      and turns to go.

      Raymond scrambles for the lighter and catches it just before
      it hits the ground.96502  "The End of Innocence"  38.    Final Shooting Script 7/11/96

      The place looks pretty much like it did before.  A few
      customers, and Delila behind the bar wiping down the
      counter.

      The doors open, Richie strides in and heads straight for
      her.

                        He's a cop and a real good friend of
                        mine.  Either I bust your arm, or
                        he's gonna bust your ass.  What is
                        it?

      Richie lets go.

226226INT. JOE'S - DAY

      Dawson is opening up.  He reaches the door, just as it
      opens -- MacLeod stands there.  Dawson is surprised to see
      him.  Neither one of them is very comfortable about it.

      beat -- Dawson hands him a slip of paper.

                                            DAWSON
                        What do you think it is?

                                            MACLEOD
                              (stunned)
                        You're out of the Watchers.

                                            DAWSON
                        Maybe it's too late... or maybe it's
                        about time.  Like Mrs. Wischnoff
                        back home used to say --
                              (Yiddish)
                        Meit ein tuchas can Meir nisht danzen

                                            MACLEOD
                              (translating)
                        With one ass, a man can't dance at
                        two weddings.

      Dawson nods, acknowledging the quote.

                                            DAWSON
                        You were right.  I couldn't be both
                        your Watcher and your friend.

      MacLeod nods.  He knows what it must have taken to do this,
      and he's touched.

                                            MACLEOD
                        I'm sorry.

                                            DAWSON
                        For what?  For making me choose?
                              (beat)
                        When I joined the Watchers it was
                        the most important thing in my life. 
                          Learning about Immortals, keeping
                        the Chronicles -- it seemed like
                          something that had to be done.
                              (beat)
                        Now it can be done by somebody else.

      MacLeod is thoughtful -- a little troubled.

      Dawson looks at him a long moment.  He watches him go.

                                            DAWSON

227227EXT. CLAY'S HOTEL - TO ESTABLISH - DAY


228228INT. CLAY'S HOTEL - ELEVATOR - DAY

      The elevator is empty when MacLeod comes across the hotel
      lobby and steps inside.

      He hits a button on the panel, the doors close and the
      elevator starts moving.

      Almost immediately, MacLeod gets a BUZZ.  Trapped, he draws
      his sword.


229229INT. CLAY'S HOTEL - HALLWAY - DAY

      THE ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN_

      and MacLeod explodes out swinging his sword defensively.

      No sign of Clay.

      Still getting the BUZZ he starts down the hall.

      ANGLE - A SWORD BLADE

      at the ready in an unknown hand.  Moving toward MacLeod.

      ANGLE MACLEOD

      Also ready.

      MACLEOD

      Raises his weapon for a head cut and pulls back just in
      time when

      RICHIE

      Turns the corner.  It's a close call, charged with recent
      bad memories.  There is an anxious beat.  Haven't we been
      here before?

                                              MACLEOD/RICHIE
                        What are you doing here!?

      Each waits for the other.

                                            RICHIE
                        How'd you get here?

                                            RICHIE
                        It does if you're after Clay.

                                            MACLEOD
                        What do you want me to do, Richie? 
                        Stand aside and say go ahead, you
                        take him?

                        Maybe not.
                            (off MacLeod's look)
                        Look, if there's one thing I've got
                        figured out, it's that I could die. 
                        Any time.  And I can't do anything
                        to change that.

                        I got myself into this and I'm not

                        I just do what I can do.  That's
                        all.

                                            MACLEOD
                        That's all any of us do.

      There's a moment of connection, there.  And then

      A HOTEL GUEST

      Steps out of his room to discover MacLeod and Richie with
      their swords drawn.

                                            GUEST
                            (very casual)
                        More of you with swords?

      MacLeod and Richie turn to him.

                                            GUEST
                            (re the swords)
                        What are all you guys, Shriners or
                        something?

                        So how come you're not at the funeral
                        with the other guy?

      MacLeod and Richie share a glance.  Bingo.

                                            MACLEOD

231231EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

      ANGLE FROM A DISTANCE

      a very small funeral.  Just Clay and a Minister.  Too far
      away to hear what's going on.

      IN THE FOREGROUND

      MacLeod's car screeches to a halt right behind Richie's
      bike.  MacLeod jumps out and catches up to Richie as he
      starts to head across the grass.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Richie, wait.

                                            RICHIE
                          I thought this wasn't about you
                        protecting me.

      MacLeod steps in front of Richie.

                                            MACLEOD
                        You want to know what this is about?
                              (angry, emotional)
                        This is about seeing me for what I
                        am.  I'm not your father, and I'm
                        not your Guardian Angel.

                                            MACLEOD (CONT.)
                            (in his face)
                        You want to know what I thought when
                        Ashe went down like that?  How could
                        he do that to me?  He was supposed
                        to be stronger than that.  He was
                          supposed to be invulnerable.

      Gone is the reasonable, placating tone; gone is trying to
      convince Richie.  This is MacLeod on the warpath.

                                            MACLEOD
                        If he could be broken like that,
                        what did that mean for me?  You know
                        what that feels like?

                                            RICHIE
                        Like you can't trust anything anymore. 
                        Like your best friend trying to kill
                        you.
                              (beat)
                        Get out of my way, Mac.

                                            MACLEOD
                            (over him)
                        You think this is about protecting
                        you?  It's not about you.
                              (beat)
                        You want to fight Clay, get in line.

      MacLeod turns away from Richie and moves purposefully across
      the grass to where

      CLAY

      Kneels beside a fresh grave.  The monument above it reads
      "CARTER WELLAN BELOVED FRIEND." He is a man in deep and
      solemn sorrow.

      He turns as he gets the BUZZ, sees MacLeod and Richie
        approaching.

                        met.

                        all done.  He fought to the death.

      Clay shakes his head.  Turns to the grave.

                                            CLAY
                        You know what it's like to have a
                        friend for nine hundred years,
                          MacLeod?
                              (choking up)
                        I'd known Carter longer than you've
                        been alive.  He was my squire and my
                          companion on a hundred campaigns on
                        five continents.  We swore to stand
                          together forever.
                            (to Richie)
                        And now he's gone, because of you.

                                            RICHIE
                        If you want a fight, you've got it. 
                        Crater or no Carter.

      He turns and walks away from the grave, off holy ground. 
      Richie starts to follow.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Richie.

      MacLeod hesitates.  This isn't easy.

                                            MACLEOD
                        He shamed me.  I watched Clay kill a
                        good friend.  I watched Graham Ashe

                        afterwards I did nothing.

      They look at each other a long beat.  It is the moment in
      which they can both feel the bond return, and the trust.

                                            RICHIE
                              (makes this his gift)
                        After you.

      MacLeod is touched.  Grateful.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Thank you.
                              (beat)
                        You'd be safe here.  On holy ground.

      Richie just shakes his head.  Uh-uh.

                                            MACLEOD
                              (resigned)
                        If he takes me, he'll take you.

                                            RICHIE
                        Then you better not let him.

      Macleod turns and walks after Clay.


232232EXT. FIGHT SITE - DAY

      MacLeod and Clay emerge from the cemetery and cross through
      a stand of trees into the privacy of a fairly secluded
      clearing.

      They face each other and draw their swords.

                                            CLAY
                        You think today is the day to do
                        what you couldn't do 350 years ago?

                                            MACLEOD
                              (quoting Ashe)
                        The best day is always the day you're
                        in.

      They close and engage.

      Clay comes right at him.  Powerful.  Aggressive. 
      Determined.  And it's not enough.

      MacLeod parries every blow, slips every charge, and remains
      absolutely cool and in control.

      Clay backs off, and MacLeod domes at him.  Slicing. 
      Slashing.  Dominating.

      Backing away, Clay starts up the small hill at the edge of
      the clearing.


                                                                (CONTINUED)96502  "The End of Innocence"  49.    Final Shooting Script 7/11/96

      MacLeod comes after him.

      Suddenly, Clay realizes the superiority of his position. 
      Fighting from the uphill position restores his confidence
      and he resumes his aggression.

      And MacLeod welcomes him.  Lures Clay into a charge and
      responds with Ashe's Thracian Attack.

      He buries his sword deep in Clay's belly.

      Clay drops his sword.

      MacLeod pulls his free, and Clay stumbles down the incline
      and falls to his knees.

      CLOSE ON MACLEOD

      MacLeod hesitates.  He looks at Clay on his knees.  He
      wants to give him an out.

                                            MACLEOD
                        We've both lost someone.

      CLOSE ON CLAY

      as he looks up.

                                            CLAY
                        But there can be only one.

      MacLeod finishes it.  A moment later it begins, a stunning
      Quickening that ends in RUMBLE and LIGHTNING.  The world
      goes dark.  It's as if night has fallen.  Finally, it is
      over, and MacLeod is left standing, exhausted.  And free.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

      FADE IN:


233233INT. JOE'S - DAY

      Richie is sitting at the bar.  Richie's different, less of
      a chip on his shoulder, more at ease with himself.

                                            RICHIE
                        Mac said you quit the Watchers.  I
                        didn't believe it.

      Dawson rolls up his left sleeve and displays the healing
      scars.  Richie reaches for the wound.

                                            DAWSON
                              (immediately)
                        Don't touch it!

                                            RICHIE
                        Hurts?

                                            DAWSON
                              (beat)
                        The wrist isn't so bad.  The rest...
                        I left a lot of good friends.

      He shrugs.

      MacLeod enters in the background, listening.

                                            RICHIE
                        I can't say I'm sorry.  I know the
                          Watchers was your life, but secret
                          rituals, guys in black coats and
                        dark glasses?  It never really seemed
                        like your style, Joe.

      Dawson rolls down the sleeve, conceding.

                                            DAWSON
                        It was never meant to be like that.

      MacLeod has been listening, thinking.  He speaks up.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Then make it right.
                              (beat)
                        Can you get back in?

                                            DAWSON
                        What?

                                            MACLEOD
                        Can you get back into the Watchers?

                                            DAWSON
                        Maybe.  Probably.  Why?

                                            MACLEOD
                        For thousands of years Immortals
                        have fought and Watchers have
                          observed.  One day, there will only
                        be one of us left.  And some day
                        maybe none.
                              (beat)
                        Someone has to record that we've
                        lived.  Someone has to record the
                        history we've seen.  The lessons
                        we've learned.
                            (off Dawson's look)
                        I know what I said.
                              (beat)
                        You're a man of honor, Joe.  Our
                        lives, our story needs to be recorded
                        by people like you, by people who
                        feel, by people who do.  Not by some
                        petty clerk.

                                            DAWSON
                        What about us?  Our friendship?

                                            MACLEOD
                        We'll work it out.

      MacLeod turns, moves out the door.  Dawson watches him go.

      Richie smiles.

                                            RICHIE
                        So.  What does a guy have to do to
                        get a drink around here?
