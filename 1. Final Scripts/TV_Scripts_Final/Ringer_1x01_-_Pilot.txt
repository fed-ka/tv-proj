FADE IN:

EXT. MANHATTAN APARTMENT - NIGHT

CLOSE ON the stoic face of a NATIVE AMERICAN, basking in the 
glow of a full moon.  

PULL OUT to reveal the carved figure of a DAKOTA INDIAN 
standing as sentry on the rooftop of an Upper West Side 
apartment.  But not just any apartment.  One of the most 
prestigious-- and infamous-- co-ops in all of New York...

THE DAKOTA.  

As the carved figure keeps a watchful eye high above the 72nd 
Street entrance, everything seems calm and quiet.  Until...

A THUMPING IS HEARD IN THE DISTANCE.  

THE CAMERA SLOWLY PANS ACROSS the building's high gables, 
tracking the noise.  

IT PICKS UP SPEED as it climbs over the sloping roofs 
checkered with dormers.  The THUMPING GETS LOUDER as...

THE CAMERA LAUNCHES over the side of the building, onto a 
terrace, and into...

INT. THE DAKOTA - CONTINUOUS

The penthouse apartment.  Vacant, in the midst of a 
renovation.  Exposed beams.  Dangling wires.  Mountains of 
two-by-fours.     

Patsy Cline s  I FALL TO PIECES  PLAYS on a sawdust covered 
CD player.  Amidst the haunting melody, the THUMPING 
CONTINUES, as if it were punctuating each beat.  

THE CAMERA MOVES DOWN THE LONG, DARK HALL, where, at the end, 
we finally discover the source of the noise...

A MAN IN BLACK, on all fours and ONLY SEEN FROM THE BACK, 
bashes something against the wall.  THE CAMERA TILTS over his 
shoulder to reveal he s straddling...

A BRUNETTE who, despite being BLOODY and NEARLY UNCONSCIOUS, 
is stunningly beautiful.  As the man s mammoth gloved hands 
cradle her head, it becomes painfully clear what he s been 
bashing.  

The brunette s glazed eyes flutter, on the verge of passing 
out.  But not before uttering:2.


BRUNETTE
You have the wrong girl.

With one final blow, we... 

SMASH TO BLACK.

LEGEND: TWO WEEKS EARLIER

INT. GRADE SCHOOL CAFETERIA - ROCK SPRINGS, WY - AFTERNOON

Narcotics Anonymous.  A GROUP OF FIFTEEN is spread out on 
metal chairs in a sweaty cafeteria, fanning themselves with 
NA pamphlets.

Standing in front of them is BRIDGET CAFFERTY, the stunning 
brunette from the teaser.  But under the harsh glare of the 
fluorescent lights, she looks a little too pale... especially 
for the desert.

BRIDGET
(to the group)
My name is Bridget and I m an 
addict.

GROUP
(in unison)
Hi Bridget.

BRIDGET
I ve been sober for six months. 
That s longer than some of the 
relationships I ve had.

Bridget awkwardly smiles at MALCOLM HOWARD, African American, 
good looking, slightly bookish.  He smiles back at her, 
supportive.

BRIDGET (CONT D)
Things have been tense.  It s been 
hard to stay clean.  But I am.  
(a beat)
I got a response from my sister a 
couple of weeks ago.  She wants me 
to come visit.  Stay as long as I 
want.  But I m not quite ready for 
that.  For family, I mean.  I m 
okay.  
(wryly)
But I m not that okay.

The group laughs.3.


BRIDGET (CONT D)
I just keep reminding myself, 
 mistakes aren't tragedies...   

The group joins in with her:

BRIDGET/GROUP
 ...but please, Higher Power, help 
me learn from them. 

INT. GRADE SCHOOL CAFETERIA - LATER

Bridget pours coffee from the shitty refreshments table.  
Malcolm approaches.

MALCOLM
You shouldn t drink that so late.  
You ll have trouble sleeping.

BRIDGET
I have trouble with or without the 
coffee.  

As Malcolm picks up a cookie, Bridget playfully snags it.

BRIDGET (CONT D)
Wanna walk me out?  My guy s 
waiting for me.

Malcolm grabs the cookie back and leads the way.

EXT. GRADE SCHOOL - MOMENTS LATER

As Bridget and Malcolm exit, they re met by FBI AGENT VICTOR 
MACHADO, muscular and manicured, guarding the door.   

AGENT MACHADO
Ready to go?

BRIDGET
Just give us a minute.

As Bridget and Malcolm head to the parking lot, Machado 
trails them.  Bridget tugs on Malcolm s suit coat.

BRIDGET (CONT D)
You re gonna melt.

MALCOLM
I have class tonight.  They re 
turning in their papers on the 
Mexican American War.4.


BRIDGET
Sounds riveting.

MALCOLM
(gesturing with his hands)
Believe it or not, I find grading 
papers therapeutic.

BRIDGET
Bullshit.

Off Malcolm s look:

BRIDGET (CONT D)
You talk with your hands when you 
lie.

Busted, Malcolm shoves his hands in his pockets.   

MALCOLM
(smiling)
You re right.  I hate grading 
papers.

As they approach a Buick LaCrosse, Agent Machado slips into 
the driver s seat. 

MALCOLM (CONT D)
Are you sure you don t want me 
there tomorrow?

BRIDGET
(nodding)
I ll call when it s over. 

Malcolm hugs Bridget, holding on a little too tightly.  As 
she pulls away, she snatches the cookie back.

INT. BUICK - MOMENTS LATER

As Bridget gets into the Buick, she turns to Agent Machado. 

AGENT MACHADO
That your boyfriend?  Or sponsor?

BRIDGET
Sponsor.  But... 

Off Machado s too eager look:

BRIDGET (CONT D)
Nevermind.5.


As they head out of the parking lot, Bridget wistfully stares 
out the window.

AGENT MACHADO
You okay?

BRIDGET
I m just a little freaked out about 
tomorrow. 

AGENT MACHADO
Don t be.  Just get up on the 
stand, tell the judge what you saw, 
and everything will be fine.

Bridget doesn t look too convinced.

AGENT MACHADO (CONT D)
It ll be over before you know it.     

Bridget halfheartedly smiles. 

BRIDGET
That s what I m afraid of.

EXT. MOTEL 6 - LATER

Agent Machado escorts Bridget to her room at the back of the 
motel.  JIMMY, a local cop, stands outside the door, smoking. 

BRIDGET
Hey Jimmy.
(handing him a napkin)
Brought you a cookie.

JIMMY
Thanks, hon.

AGENT MACHADO
I ll pick you up at seven-thirty 
sharp.  If you need anything til 
then--

BRIDGET
(cutting him off)
Jimmy will protect me.

AGENT MACHADO
Get a good night s rest.  

As Agent Machado leaves:

BRIDGET
Guy s got a rod up his ass.6.


JIMMY
(smiling)
He d like that.

INT. MOTEL 6 - NIGHT

A cheesy desert motif.  Plastic cacti and wolf-howling-at-
moon art adorn the room.  Bridget sits on a Navajo bedspread, 
finishing her Arby s.  She watches the news on a small TV in 
front of her.  

CLOSE ON TV: A NEWSCASTER sits at a  CHANNEL 13  news desk.

NEWSCASTER 
(to camera, on TV)
...trial of Wind River reservation 
crime boss Bodaway Macawi. 

A picture of BODAWAY MACAWI, a hulking Native American with 
eyes as black as his hair, appears on the TV. 

Bridget reflexively changes the channel.   THE SIMPSONS  
THEME BLARES.  As she watches the cartoon, her finger 
flutters on the remote, fighting the urge to switch back, 
until... FLIP.

NEWSCASTER (CONT D)
(to camera, on TV)
...the dismemberment killing of 
Shaylene Briggs, a dancer in his 
Rock Springs strip club.  If 
convicted, Macawi faces the death 
penalty.
(a beat)
Up next is weather with--

CLICK.  Bridget chucks her Arby s in a nearby garbage and 
crosses to the window.  She pulls back the curtain just 
enough to see Jimmy, standing guard, sucking on a cigarette.  
Bridget zeros in on the gun in his holster, as we...

CUT TO:

INT. BUICK/EXT. MOTEL 6 - THE NEXT MORNING

Agent Machado clips his nails, as he waits for Bridget 
outside the motel.  He glances at the clock on the dashboard, 
as it switches to  7:31 A.M. 

Annoyed, Machado pockets the clipper and exits his vehicle.  
As he walks to the back of the motel, a look of concern 
washes over his face.  REVERSE ANGLE to see...

BRIDGET S ROOM, UNGUARDED.  7.


Machado draws his gun and stealthily approaches the motel 
room.  He turns the knob.  It s locked.  So he takes a step 
back and...  

INT. MOTEL 6 - CONTINUOUS

...kicks open the door.  Machado cautiously enters, scanning 
the RANSACKED ROOM.

AGENT MACHADO
Bridget?

No answer.  As he continues to survey the scene, MUFFLED 
MOANS are heard coming from the bathroom.  Leading with his 
gun, Machado opens the door to find...  

JIMMY, WITH A GASH ON HIS HEAD, HANDCUFFED TO THE SHOWER ROD.

As Machado rips the duct tape off his mouth:

JIMMY
Crazy bitch stole my gun!

INT. WOLFIE S TAVERN - DAY

A CHIC WOMAN, in a Hermes scarf and ONLY SEEN FROM THE BACK, 
sits at the bar, smoking.  As she takes the last sip of her 
club soda, she looks at the clock.  It reads  5:30.   She 
motions to the BARTENDER for her check and throws down a 
twenty.  

The chic woman pulls out a compact.  As she touches up her 
blood red lips, the REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR reveals what 
appears to be...

BRIDGET-- INCOGNITO-- LOOKING UNCHARACTERISTICALLY GLAMOROUS.  

She snaps her compact shut, and, just as she s about to 
leave...

TWO POLICE OFFICERS enter the bar.

She throws on a pair of oversized sunglasses.  As she rushes 
past them towards the exit:   

POLICE OFFICER #1
Excuse me?  Miss?

She stops in her tracks and slowly turns around to see one of 
the cops holding her clutch. 

POLICE OFFICER #1 (CONT D)
You forgot your purse.8.


She politely smiles, grabs her bag, and hurriedly heads out 
of the bar...

EXT. WOLFIE S TAVERN/BUS STATION - CONTINUOUS 

...to the bus station across the street.  As the Hampton 
Jitney pulls up, she picks up her pace.  She frantically 
waves, trying to get its attention.  But her waves go 
unnoticed.  The jitney slowly pulls away to reveal...

THE REAL BRIDGET, dishevelled in jeans and a T-shirt, duffle 
in hand.  We then realize that the chic woman isn t Bridget 
after all but...

SIOBHAN (pronounced Shavonne) MARX, her twin sister.  Aside 
from Bridget s hair being longer, they re nearly identical.

SIOBHAN
(disappointed)
I wanted to pay your fare!

As Siobhan rushes over to Bridget, they embrace.  Like they 
haven t seen each other in years.  

SIOBHAN (CONT D)
It s so good to see you!  

BRIDGET
It s good to see you, too.

SIOBHAN
(re: duffle)
Is that all you brought?

BRIDGET
I m traveling light these days.  

As the sisters finally pull apart, Siobhan takes in Bridget. 

SIOBHAN
I was wondering how you d look 
after six years.

BRIDGET
Not nearly as good as you.

SIOBHAN
Not true.  
(smiling)
It s still like looking in a 
mirror.9.


INT. JAGUAR CONVERTIBLE - MOVING - LATER

As Siobhan drives through East Hampton, Bridget takes in the 
utter extravagance of her surroundings.  As they pass by a 
Cape Cod version of Versailles:  

BRIDGET 
Is that what your house looks like?

SIOBHAN
Hardly.  We don t have a baseball 
diamond.

The sisters burst into laughter.  Just like old times.

SIOBHAN (CONT D)
So catch me up.  What s your life 
like out there?

Bridget opens her mouth.  Then stops herself.  

SIOBHAN (CONT D)
That exciting?

BRIDGET
It s just a lot to fill you in on. 

SIOBHAN
Well you don t have to tell me 
anything you don t want to.

Bridget looks relieved.  As Siobhan goes to turn on the 
radio:

BRIDGET
I just want you to know how sorry I 
am.  For everything.

SIOBHAN
You already apologized in your 
letter.

BRIDGET
I know.  It s just that making 
amends is--

SIOBHAN
(cutting her off)
Step number nine.  I did my 
research.  

Bridget nods, impressed.10.


SIOBHAN (CONT D)
But, as far as I m concerned, it s 
unnecessary.  

BRIDGET
Why?

SIOBHAN
You re already forgiven.

Tears well up in Bridget s eyes.

SIOBHAN (CONT D)
Now you just have to forgive 
yourself.

INT. EAST HAMPTON MANSION - LATER

Modern.  Minimalist.  Straight out of Architectural Digest.  
As Siobhan and Bridget enter: 

BRIDGET
This is your weekend home?

SIOBHAN
(calling out)
Carms!  Can you make up the guest 
room?  We have a visitor!  

No answer.

SIOBHAN (CONT D)
(sighing)
Ever since I got her that iPod for 
Christmas, she can t hear a word I 
say.

BRIDGET
Smart lady.  

As they head down the gallery-style hallway, Bridget eyes the 
David Hockney on the wall, while Siobhan eyes the Post-It on 
the console table:  NOT FEELING WELL.  WENT HOME EARLY.  
CARMEN. 

SIOBHAN
Guess it s just you and me tonight.  

BRIDGET
Where s Andrew?

SIOBHAN
In London.  Working.  Speaking 
of...
(MORE)11.

SIOBHAN (CONT'D)
(tentative)
I haven t exactly told him about 
you yet.

BRIDGET
About my visiting? 

SIOBHAN
(sheepishly)
About your existing.  He doesn t 
know I have a sister.  

Bridget doesn t seem phased.

BRIDGET
We were totally estranged.  It s 
like I didn t exist.

SIOBHAN
Don t say that.

BRIDGET
I m serious.  I was a shitty 
sister.  And what I put you 
through... If I were in your shoes, 
I wouldn t have told my husband 
either.  

SIOBHAN
But I guarantee when he meets you, 
he s going to love you!  His 
daughter Juliet on the other 
hand...

BRIDGET
She a toughie?

SIOBHAN
She s a teenager.  All I can say is 
thank god for boarding school.

INT. EAST HAMPTON MANSION - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Siobhan leads Bridget into the state of the art kitchen. 

SIOBHAN
Can I get you something to drink?

She gestures to a glass fridge stocked with designer water. 

BRIDGET
Tap s fine.  I can t taste the 
difference.12.


SIOBHAN
Me neither.  But Andrew insists on 
the fancy stuff.

After pouring two glasses of tap water, Siobhan reaches for a 
a prescription bottle on the black quartz counter.  

CLOSE ON LABEL:  LEXAPRO, 20 MG.   

Siobhan fishes a tiny white pill out of the FULL BOTTLE OF 
ANTIDEPRESSANTS.  Off Bridget s questioning look:   

SIOBHAN (CONT D)
It s just for nerves.

BRIDGET
I was gonna say...

Bridget glances at the Tiffany framed wedding portrait of 
Siobhan and her impossibly handsome husband ANDREW MARX.     

BRIDGET (CONT D)
Your life seems perfect.

SIOBHAN
Close to it.  But no one s life is 
perfect.

Siobhan smiles and pops the pill.

INT. EAST HAMPTON MANSION - GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT

A freshly showered Bridget gets ready for bed.  As she combs 
her wet hair, she wanders around the room, looking at the 
artwork.  

After inspecting a bust of Janus (the Roman god with two 
faces), Bridget opens her duffle.  As she rummages for a pair 
of pajamas, she comes across...

A BLOODY 9 MM GLOCK.  She stares at the gun in her duffle, 
FREAKED OUT.  CONFUSED.

SIOBHAN (O.C.)
Everything okay?

Startled, Bridget turns around to see Siobhan, peeking her 
head in.  She quickly covers the gun.   

BRIDGET
Do you mind if I sleep with you 
tonight?13.


INT. EAST HAMPTON MANSION - MASTER BEDROOM - LATER

Siobhan and Bridget lie next to one another in an ultra lush 
king-sized bed.  A lamp casts a warm glow over the room.

BRIDGET
Still snore?      

Siobhan guiltily smiles and fishes a pair of earplugs out of 
her night stand.  As Bridget grabs them: 

BRIDGET (CONT D)
I think about Sean every day.

Siobhan s smile fades.

SIOBHAN
Wow.  That came out of nowhere.

BRIDGET
I know, but--

SIOBHAN
(cutting her off)
I already told you.  We re good.

Making it clear the conversation s over, Siobhan turns off 
the lamp.  Off a stung Bridget, lying in the darkness, we... 

CUT TO:

INT. EAST HAMPTON MANSION - MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING

Bridget sleeps soundly in Siobhan s bed.  As light floods in 
the room, Bridget stirs.  She turns to see her sister s side 
of the bed empty.    

Bridget crosses to the window.  She stares at the sunlit 
ocean, transfixed by its beauty. 

SIOBHAN (O.C.)
My snoring didn t keep you up?

Bridget turns around to see Siobhan in a bikini top and 
shorts.  As she extends a cup of coffee:

BRIDGET
Honestly?  It was the best night s 
sleep I ve had in a long time.

SIOBHAN
Good.  Cause I m dying to get out 
on the boat.  I left you a bathing 
suit in the bathroom.14.


BRIDGET
Is this all for real?

Siobhan warmly smiles, placing a hand on Bridget s shoulder.

EXT. SPEED BOAT - DOCK - LATER

Bridget watches the massive Marx estate shrink in the 
distance, as Siobhan guns her speed boat away from the dock. 

EXT. SPEED BOAT - OCEAN - LATER

As Siobhan helms the boat, smoking a cigarette, Bridget soaks 
up the sun.

BRIDGET
I thought you quit?

SIOBHAN
No.  That was you.
(re: helm)
Wanna give it a go?

BRIDGET
Oh god.  I haven t driven a boat 
since we were sixteen.  

SIOBHAN
It s like riding a bike.

BRIDGET
This is hardly Lake Tahoe. 

Bridget begrudgingly takes the wheel from Siobhan.  Within a 
minute, she s effortlessly steering the boat.  

SIOBHAN
See?  I told you it d come back.

Bridget smiles, bolstered.  As Siobhan opens a can of soda:    

SIOBHAN (CONT D)
So are you still, um... 
(delicately)
...stripping?

BRIDGET
No.  But I still work for tips.  
Just as a waitress.  And let me 
tell you, the money isn t nearly as 
good.  

Siobhan laughs.15.


BRIDGET (CONT D)
When I got sober, all bad habits 
went out the window. 
(smiling sadly)
I don t want to be the sister you 
have to pretend doesn t exist.

Siobhan takes Bridget s hand.

SIOBHAN
You re not.  And we re the only 
family we have left.
(sincere)
I love you.   

Bridget is visibly moved.  She thought she d never hear 
Siobhan say those three little words again.

EXT. SPEED BOAT - OCEAN - LATER

The speed boat gently bobs in the waves, anchored in the open 
water.  Post lunch, Siobhan and Bridget sit on the stern, 
amid a pile of takeout containers.

SIOBHAN 
Wanna go for a swim?

BRIDGET
Yeah right.  I ll puke.

SIOBHAN
Well I m gonna take a dip.  It s 
getting hot. 

Siobhan ties her hair back with her Hermes scarf.

BRIDGET
I ll work on my tan.  
(raising a pasty arm)
Can t snag a Hamptons  millionaire 
gaunt and pale.

Siobhan laughs and dives into the ocean.  Bridget lays back 
and places a straw hat over her face.  TRACK UP to the sun 
beating down overhead, as we...

MATCH CUT TO:

EXT. SPEED BOAT - OCEAN - LATER

The sun is now dimmer and closer to the horizon.  A BEET RED 
Bridget sleeps under her straw hat.  She stirs, then slowly 
awakens. 16.


BRIDGET
(groggy)
How long was I out for?

As Bridget removes the hat, she notices her sunburn.

BRIDGET (CONT D)
Siobhan?

No response.  Bridget looks across the deck but doesn t see 
her sister.

BRIDGET (CONT D)
Shiv?

Still no response.  As Bridget gets up, she scans the boat.  
Nothing.  Then the water.  Siobhan s nowhere in sight.  
Until...

A SPECK OF RED is seen floating in the distance.  Thinking 
that Siobhan may have drifted in the current, Bridget picks 
up a pair of binoculars.  Her face falls when, through the 
BINOCULAR S POV, we reveal...

SIOBHAN S HERMES SCARF UNDULATING IN THE WAVES.

BRIDGET (CONT D)
(panicked)
Oh god!

Bridget rips up the anchor and starts the engine.  As she 
races in the direction of the scarf, she picks up her cell 
phone.  Mid-dial, she realizes she has no reception. 

BRIDGET (CONT D)
Shit!

She tosses the phone aside and continues on course.  As soon 
as she s within swimming distance, she stops the engine and 
drops the anchor.  Without a moment s hesitation, she dives 
into the water.  She frantically swims over to the scarf, 
takes a deep breath, and goes under.  

Bubbles swarm about her as she thrashes her way through the 
murky Atlantic, trying to see something.  Anything.  But it s 
no use.  Bridget comes up for air.

BRIDGET (CONT D)
(gasping)
Siobhan!17.


It s eerily quiet, save for a SEAGULL overhead.  Bridget 
takes another deep breath and goes back under, as we...

MATCH CUT TO:

EXT. OCEAN/SPEED BOAT - DUSK

When Bridget resurfaces, the sun is nearly set.  Completely 
exhausted, she s barely able to drag herself back into the 
boat.  As she stares at Siobhan s Hermes scarf, the grim 
reality of the situation sets in.  Bridget buries her face in 
her hands and starts to sob uncontrollably, as we...  

CUT TO:

EXT. EAST HAMPTON MANSION - DOCK - LATER

A puffy-eyed Bridget docks behind the Marx estate.  As she 
exits the boat, Hermes scarf in hand, her cell phone reads 
 ENTERING SERVICE AREA.   As she starts to dial: 

NINA (O.C.)
There you are!

Bridget turns to see NINA FORTMAN, Siobhan s neighbor, 
holding a glass of wine.

NINA (CONT D)
I thought you were coming by at 
six?  I got shrimp from Claws on 
Wheels!

BRIDGET
I m sorry, but I m not--

NINA
(cutting her off)
Don t bother with excuses, sweetie.  
I already drank an entire bottle of 
Pinot waiting for you, so I m not 
upset.  We ll do it another night.  
 Kay?

Bridget forces a smile.

NINA (CONT D)
You alright?  You look a little 
puffy?  

Before Bridget can answer:

NINA (CONT D)
Did you get derma-filler?   18.


Bridget ignores her and heads inside the house.

NINA (CONT D)
Don t be offended, sweetie.  
Everyone does it.

Nina gulps the last of her wine, as we...

CUT TO:

INT. EAST HAMPTON MANSION - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Bridget rushes into the kitchen and hurriedly dials her cell.  
She paces, until: 

MALCOLM (V.O.)
(from cell)
You ve reached Professor Howard.  
Office hours are from four to six.  
Please leave a message at the tone.

BRIDGET
(into cell)
Malcolm?  It s me.  I don t know 
what to do.  I think she s dead.  
But I can t call the cops--

Bridget trails off when she sees SIOBHAN S BOTTLE OF LEXAPRO, 
knocked over on the kitchen counter, EMPTY.  Bridget picks up 
the bottle, shocked.

BRIDGET (CONT D)
(into phone)
Oh my god!  She killed herself!

CARMEN (O.C.)
Mrs. M, I m gonna leave!

A startled Bridget turns around to see CARMEN, Siobhan s 
housekeeper, entering.

CARMEN (CONT D)
Is everything okay?

Bridget nods and quickly hangs up her cell.

CARMEN (CONT D)
I felt better so I thought I d come 
in.  You were on the boat when I 
got here.  Long day, huh?

Bridget tightly smiles, waiting for Carmen to leave.19.


CARMEN (CONT D)
I need to be paid, if that s okay.

Bridget spots Siobhan s purse.  She pulls out a wallet and 
grabs a fifty.  As she hands it to Carmen:

CARMEN (CONT D)
Um...

Bridget grabs another bill and hands it to her.

CARMEN (CONT D)
Are you alright, Mrs. M?

BRIDGET
I m not...

Bridget glances at Siobhan s driver s license.  Aside from 
the name and address, IT LOOKS IDENTICAL TO HERS. 

BRIDGET (CONT D)
...myself today.

CARMEN
Are you sure you don t need me to 
stay?

BRIDGET
I ll be fine.

As Carmen is about to exit:

BRIDGET (CONT D)
Do I look like myself?

CARMEN
You look tired, Mrs. M.  Like 
you ve had a rough day.  But other 
than that, you re still mucha 
bonita.  

Off the wheels turning in Bridget s head, we...

CUT TO:

INT. EAST HAMPTON MANSION - GUEST BEDROOM - LATER

Bridget enters, Hermes scarf in hand.  As she hurriedly packs 
her belongings, the HOUSE PHONE RINGS.   

BRIDGET
(into phone, cautious)
Hello?20.


ANDREW (V.O.)
(from phone)
It s me.

Bridget glances at the caller ID.  It reads:  ANDREW. 

ANDREW (V.O.) (CONT D)
I m flying back Monday night.  Will 
you be in the city by then?

Bridget doesn t answer.

ANDREW (V.O.) (CONT D)
Siobhan?

Bridget stares at the bloody gun in her duffle.  Then at 
Siobhan s Hermes scarf.  Her past.  Or a future.

BRIDGET
Yes.  I ll be there.

ANDREW (V.O.)
Good.  See you then. 

CLICK.  Bridget slowly ties the scarf in her hair, as we... 


END ACT ONE21.


ACT TWO

INT. WESTERN WYOMING COMMUNITY COLLEGE - LECTURE HALL - DAY

Malcolm stands at the front of a packed lecture hall.

MALCOLM
...hate to be the bearer of bad 
news, but if you don t do well, it 
matters.  Mid-terms count for one-
third of your grade.

A COLLECTIVE MOAN resounds throughout the hall.  

MALCOLM (CONT D)
See you Monday.

The students get up out of their seats, dispersing, to 
reveal... 

Agent Machado, sitting in the back row, reading a newspaper. 

EXT. WESTERN WYOMING COMMUNITY COLLEGE - CAMPUS - LATER

As Malcolm and Machado walk across campus:

AGENT MACHADO
So what was your relationship like? 

Malcolm tenses, uncomfortable.

MALCOLM
That s one of the problems with 
being a sponsor.  You get close.  

AGENT MACHADO
How close?

MALCOLM
(reluctant)
Too close.  And I instantly 
regretted it.

Off Machado s look:

MALCOLM (CONT D)
I don t mean like that.  I mean it 
was a conflict of interest.  
Bridget s sobriety was the most 
important thing.  And I didn t want 
to jeopardize it.  
(shrugging)
(MORE)22.

MALCOLM (CONT D)
You know how it is when feelings 
are involved.  People can sometimes 
make bad choices.

AGENT MACHADO
Do you love her?

MALCOLM
Why are you asking?

AGENT MACHADO
Because I find it hard to believe 
that Ms. Cafferty would disappear 
without contacting you.

MALCOLM
(talking with his hands)
Well she hasn t.  And I m really 
worried about her.

Machado zeros in on Malcolm s hands... but doesn t call his 
bluff. 

AGENT MACHADO
You should be.  Without her 
testimony...  

Machado hands over a copy of the Rock Springs Rocket-Miner.  
The headline reads:  MACAWI CASE DECLARED MISTRIAL. 

AGENT MACHADO (CONT D)
...Bodaway s a free man.

INT. EAST HAMPTON MANSION - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

Bridget stands in Siobhan s enormous walk-in closet, studying 
herself in the full length mirror.  Gone are the ratty 
clothes and pale visage.  A tan, designer-clad Bridget stares 
back, looking eerily similar to Siobhan.  

Bridget frowns.  Something s still not right.  She steps 
closer to the mirror.  PUSH IN on her face, as we...

MATCH CUT TO:

INT. EAST HAMPTON HAIR SALON - DAY - LATER

Bridget continues to stare at herself in a mirror, but as we 
PULL OUT, we reveal she s now in a salon.  A STYLIST 
approaches and runs his fingers through her locks.

STYLIST
It got long.  Do you want to keep 
the length?  Or go short?23.


BRIDGET
Do exactly what you did last time.

INT. BUS STATION - DAY

A coiffed Bridget, now a dead ringer for Siobhan, enters the 
bus station.  As she lugs her duffle to the locker area, she 
passes by a HOMELESS MAN.

HOMELESS MAN
Hey lady.  You got any change?

Bridget ignores him, preoccupied by the  12 MISSED CALLS FROM 
MALCOLM  flashing on her cell.

HOMELESS MAN (CONT D)
(muttering)
Bitch.

When Bridget reaches the lockers, she snaps her cell shut.  
She places it, along with her duffle, in one of the lockers.  
But not before removing the gun, which she discreetly slips 
in Siobhan s purse.  

REVERSE ANGLE to a POV FROM INSIDE THE LOCKER, where we watch 
Bridget slam the door on her past.    

EXT. BUS STATION - MOMENTS LATER

Bridget exits the bus station a new woman.  She walks towards 
the Hampton Jitney but doesn t get on.  Instead, she walks 
around the bus to...

A PARKED LINCOLN TOWNCAR.  Looks like public transportation 
is a thing of the past.  A DRIVER opens the door for Bridget, 
as we...  

CUT TO:

INT. LINCOLN TOWNCAR - MOVING - DUSK

A mesmerized and energized Bridget takes in the scenery, as 
she s being driven through the Upper West Side.  The Towncar 
pulls up to a beautiful pre-war brick building.

INT. UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT - LOBBY - LATER

A DOORMAN calls the elevator for Bridget, as she enters the  
lavishly renovated building.  

DOORMAN
Evening, Mrs. Marx.24.


BRIDGET
Good evening...
(glancing at his name tag)
Robert.

The gilded elevator DINGS and Bridget steps inside.

INT. MARX APARTMENT - MINUTES LATER

DING.  The elevator doors open onto an expansive apartment.  
Bridget enters, taken aback.

BRIDGET
Not even a front door.

CARMEN (O.C.)
I beat you back!

Bridget turns to see Carmen, standing in the hallway, 
listening to her iPod.

CARMEN (CONT D)
(loudly)
Are you feeling better, Mrs. M?

BRIDGET
Much.  Thanks, Carms.

Bridget walks the length of the apartment, taking in the 
surroundings: antique furniture, extravagant floral 
arrangements, high end art.  Bridget stops at a framed 
photograph of a PRETTY TEENAGE GIRL posing with Andrew. 

BRIDGET (CONT D)
(sotto)
Juliet.

INT. MARX APARTMENT - MASTER BEDROOM - LATER

Bridget enters Siobhan s bedroom and makes a bee line for the 
closet.  As she looks for a place to hide the gun, she opens 
a dresser drawer brimming with Siobhan s signature Hermes 
scarves.  As she hides the gun under the mound of silk, she 
hears the CREAKING OF THE BEDROOM DOOR. 

BRIDGET
(calling out)
Listen, Carms--

Bridget turns around to see Siobhan s husband ANDREW, hanging 
bag in hand, standing in the doorway.  Better looking than 
his picture, Bridget stares in awe at his thick salt and 
pepper hair and tailored suit.  He looks more like a model 
than a mogul.25.


BRIDGET (CONT D)
Oh.  Hi.

She stands awkwardly for a moment, then gives him a hug.

ANDREW
Aren t you friendly?

BRIDGET
It s been forever.

ANDREW
Two weeks is hardly forever.

Andrew pulls away and surveys her.

ANDREW (CONT D)
Did you lose weight?

BRIDGET
(nervous)
Maybe a little.

ANDREW
You look good.

BRIDGET
Thanks.  So how was London?

ANDREW
Humid.  But I did get that investor 
on board.

BRIDGET
Congratulations.

ANDREW
Are you being sarcastic?  

BRIDGET
(confused)
Not at all.

Andrew tosses his bag on the bed.  As he rifles through it:

ANDREW
I have something for you.

He pulls out a pile of wrinkled dress shirts.

ANDREW (CONT D)
Carmen said you re using a new 
cleaners.26.


BRIDGET
(grabbing the shirts)
I ll take them in the morning.

ANDREW
Look, I know you ve been on a 
cooking kick, but I d prefer to 
take in Thai tonight.

BRIDGET
Okay.

ANDREW
(surprised)
That was easy.   

Andrew strips off his jacket and shirt, revealing a muscular 
chest.

ANDREW (CONT D)
I m gonna take a shower.   

As he takes off his pants, Bridget can t help but stare.

ANDREW (CONT D)
You know what you want.  Just say 
it.

BRIDGET
I do?

ANDREW
A smoke.  I can t believe you 
haven t had one yet.  It s been a 
whole two minutes.

Finally having an excuse to avert her eyes, Bridget grabs 
Siobhan s pack of cigarettes.   

ANDREW (CONT D)
Not in here, please.  I know you ve 
been sneaking them inside.  But now 
that I m back... the fun s over.

EXT. MARX APARTMENT - BALCONY - MOMENTS LATER

Bridget steps onto the sixth floor balcony.  As she lights up 
a cigarette, she fights back a cough.  As she pretends to 
take a drag, she notices...

A MAN, standing on the street below, staring up at her.  The 
light from the lamp post casts a shadow across his face.  27.


Bridget turns away.  She takes another  puff,  trying to 
convince herself that he wasn t staring at her.  When she 
turns back, the man steps out of the shadow and it s 
unmistakable.  

HE S STARING DIRECTLY AT HER.  

An unnerved Bridget extinguishes her cigarette and heads back 
inside, as we...

CUT TO:

INT. MARX APARTMENT - MASTER BEDROOM - LATER

Bridget gets ready for bed.  As she starts to undress, she 
stops herself.  For the first time it dawns on her that 
she ll be sharing a bed with a stranger.  So she stays 
clothed and lies on top of the covers.        

As Andrew exits the bathroom, wrapped in a towel, Bridget 
quickly closes her eyes, pretending to be asleep.  She mimics 
Siobhan s snoring, as we...

MATCH CUT TO:

INT. MARX APARTMENT - MASTER BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

A fully clothed Bridget bolts up in bed, as the TELEPHONE 
RINGS.  She glances at the alarm clock.  It reads  8:30.   
Then at Andrew s empty side of the bed.  She groggily picks 
up the phone.

BRIDGET
(into phone)
Hello?

GEMMA (V.O.)
(from phone, British 
accent)
What are you doing home?!

BRIDGET
Um... sleeping.

GEMMA (V.O.)
(chiding)
Darling!  You were supposed to meet 
me at the apartment half an hour 
ago!  

BRIDGET
I was?28.


GEMMA (V.O.)
Don t tell me you didn t know.  I 
saw you write it in your book.

Bridget spots Siobhan s leather bound day planner on the 
desk.  She flips through it until she lands on today s date:  
 GEMMA.  8:00.  THE DAKOTA.  

GEMMA (V.O.) (CONT D)
Hello?  Did you fall back asleep?

BRIDGET
No, Gemma.  I ll be there.  Just 
give me twenty minutes.  

GEMMA (V.O.)
Make it thirty.  Now you owe me a 
latte from Zabar s.

INT. THE DAKOTA - LATER

The penthouse apartment.  Bridget enters the chaos of WORKMEN 
in the midst of a renovation.  PATSY CLINE PLAYS ON THE 
SAWDUST COVERED CD PLAYER.  She makes her way through the 
debris, balancing a latte, until she finds...

GEMMA, tall, attractive, and managing to make a hard hat work 
with her Balenciaga suit.  Gemma grabs the coffee and warmly 
kisses Bridget on both cheeks.

GEMMA
You look absolutely anorexic.  You 
must share your diet.

Bridget can t help but like her.

GEMMA (CONT D)
Good news!  We have the marble 
people coming at ten instead of 
four and the lighting guy can make 
it after lunch.  What do you think 
of the molding in the foyer? 

BRIDGET
It s... great.  

GEMMA
Told you it would be.

BRIDGET
Just one question.  Why are we 
moving again?29.


GEMMA
Ask your bloody husband!  It took 
me a year and a half to do Central 
Park West and now he wants to start 
over.  But it is The Dakota.

Bridget glances at a stack of papers Gemma s holding.  The 
letterhead reads:  GEMMA GALLAGHER, NCARB CERTIFIED 
ARCHITECT. 

GEMMA (CONT D)
Now come see the iron work on the 
terrace.

EXT. THE DAKOTA - TERRACE - MOMENTS LATER

Gemma leads Bridget out onto a terrace with a prime view of 
the city.  

BRIDGET
Pretty.

GEMMA
You don t seem that enthused.  
What s wrong?  I thought you lived 
for this stuff!

BRIDGET
I do.  I m just tired.  Andrew got 
back last night.

GEMMA
Uck!  You re skinny and you re 
having sex?

BRIDGET
We didn t--

GEMMA
(cutting her off)
The last time I saw my husband 
naked was right before the twins 
turned three... last year.

Gemma stares off, preoccupied.

GEMMA (CONT D)
I think Henry s having an affair.  

Bridget seems genuinely shocked, despite not knowing Gemma.  30.


GEMMA (CONT D)
(teary-eyed)
I can t stand to look at him, let 
alone sleep next to him.  I wish I 
could tag along with you and Andrew 
to Don Giovanni.  

BRIDGET
Don Giovanni?

GEMMA
Very funny.  I know I promised I 
wouldn t give you a guilt trip 
about not getting extra tickets.  
It is opening night.

BRIDGET
I can cancel.

GEMMA
(sniffling)
I ll be fine.  I ll just slag it up 
with one of the workmen.  I m sure  
contractors make more money than 
out of work novelists.

BRIDGET
I d go for the one with the man 
boobs.  Very sexy.

Gemma laughs through her tears.  PRE-LAP AN ARIA, as we...

CUT TO:

INT. LINCOLN CENTER - METROPOLITAN OPERA - NIGHT

Bridget, looking ravishing in red, watches Don Giovanni next 
to a tuxedoed Andrew.  Feeling eyes on her, she looks up to 
the balcony to see...

THE SAME MAN FROM OUTSIDE THE APARTMENT, STARING AT HER.  

An unnerved Bridget immediately looks away and takes Andrew s 
hand.  Andrew glances at her, surprised, as we...

CUT TO:

INT. LINCOLN CENTER - METROPOLITAN OPERA - LOBBY - LATER

Bridget stands next to Andrew, as he chats up another COUPLE.  31.


ANDREW
I know it s a lot of money.  But if 
you re willing to take the risk, I 
promise a big return.
(smiling)
But enough shop talk.  I need to 
fetch my wife a Tanqueray and tonic 
or I ll be in trouble.

BRIDGET
Actually, sweetheart, would you 
mind just grabbing me a water?  I m 
parched.
(to the couple)
If you ll excuse me, I need to use 
the ladies  room.

INT. LINCOLN CENTER - METROPOLITAN OPERA - BATHROOM - LATER

Bridget, alone in the bathroom, touches up her make-up at the 
sink.  The door opens.  Bridget glances in the mirror to 
see...

THE MAN WHO S BEEN STARING AT HER, ENTERING.

He walks over and grabs her.  And just as Bridget is about to 
scream...

He kisses her hard, passionate, like her lips belong to him.   


END ACT TWO32.


ACT THREE

INT. LINCOLN CENTER - METROPOLITAN OPERA - BATHROOM - SAME

As the man hungrily kisses Bridget, she pushes him away.

BRIDGET
What the hell are you doing?

MAN
Relax.  Gemma s not here.

BRIDGET
(realizing)
Henry?

As Bridget takes in his classic good looks and athletic 
build, she can t believe that SIOBHAN IS HENRY S MISTRESS.

BRIDGET (CONT D)
Shit!  I can t do this.

HENRY
Why not?

BRIDGET
It s too much.

HENRY
What s too much is I haven t seen 
you in a week.  So you got detained 
in the Hamptons.  Fine.  But then 
yesterday, when you didn t show up 
at the hotel, I came to your place.  
But you just watched from the 
balcony like I was some kind of 
crazy person.
(distraught)
And now this?

BRIDGET
You need to calm down.

HENRY
I don t understand.   

A WOMAN enters.  She makes a face at Henry before entering a 
stall.

BRIDGET
You have to leave.33.


HENRY
Not before you tell me what s going 
on.

BRIDGET
I don t want to do this here.  
Andrew s right outside. 

HENRY
Like you care what he thinks.

BRIDGET
(frustrated)
Henry.

HENRY
Fine.  Meet me at the hotel on 
Friday.  The nanny s taking the 
boys to the park at noon.

BRIDGET
What hotel?

HENRY
Our hotel.

Off Bridget s blank stare:

HENRY (CONT D)
The Hudson.  I thought you liked it 
because nobody knows us there?

BRIDGET
I do.  The Hudson.  Friday.  Noon.

Henry cups her face in his hands.

HENRY
Nothing s changed on my end.   

As he exits, the END OF INTERMISSION BELL DINGS.  Bridget 
sighs.  From one drama to another. 

INT. ASTRO LOUNGE - ROCK SPRINGS, WY - NIGHT

A low rent titty bar packed with GYRATING GIRLS and the MEN 
WHO LOVE THEM.  

Bodaway Macawi reclines on a purple velvet sofa, celebrating 
his freedom.  As a STRIPPER bounces on his lap, his BOYS f te 
him with cigars, tequila, and cocaine.  Bodaway snorts a line 
and knocks back a shot.  THROUGH HIS POV, VIA THE BOTTOM OF 
THE SHOT GLASS, WE SEE...34.


The distorted image of Jimmy, the cop outside Bridget s motel 
room.  As Jimmy slowly approaches, Bodaway s boys stand.  
Everyone seems tense.  On edge.  Until...

Bodaway flashes a rotted grin.  As the boys back off, Bodaway 
gestures for Jimmy to take a seat.

BODAWAY
Somebody get my friend here a 
drink.  And a girl.

JIMMY
Make it two.
(smirking)
Drinks and girls.

Bodaway laughs and smacks Jimmy on the back.

JIMMY (CONT D)
Before I forget...

He tosses down Bridget s NA pamphlet, with an address 
scribbled across it, as we...

CUT TO:

EXT. CLAY TENNIS COURTS - RIVERSIDE PARK - DAY

Bridget, in Siobhan s tennis whites, volleys with Andrew.  As 
her ball hits the net:

ANDREW
You re playing like my mother.

Bridget fetches the ball and makes another attempt... only to 
hit it off the court.

ANDREW (CONT D)
Jesus, Siobhan!

BRIDGET
(frustrated)
I m sorry.  I haven t played in 
awhile.

ANDREW
(annoyed)
Well you re acting like you ve 
never played.  Do you just want to 
call it quits?  I have to get back 
to the office anyway.

Bridget twirls her racquet and smiles flirtatiously.35.


BRIDGET
Why don t you come over here and 
give me a refresher course?

ANDREW
Are you kidding?

BRIDGET
C mon.  You ve got a killer serve.   

Andrew crosses the net to Bridget.  He steps behind her and 
gently pulls her right arm back.

ANDREW
Racquet up and turn to the side.  
Show your opponent that left 
shoulder.

BRIDGET
(teasing)
But you re behind me.

ANDREW
Do you want to be cute?  Or do you 
want to keep playing like shit?

Bridget obediently lifts her racquet.  

BRIDGET
Yes, sir.

ANDREW
And you re tossing the ball higher 
than you can reach.  

Bridget tosses the ball and swings.  It shoots right into the 
net.  Andrew walks around to face her and gently tilts up her 
chin.

ANDREW (CONT D)
Stop looking down.  If you look up, 
it won t hit the net.

Bridget stares right into his eyes.

ANDREW (CONT D)
What?

BRIDGET
Nothing.  It s just that... you re 
sexy.

Andrew laughs, loosening up.36.


ANDREW
You re just trying to distract me 
from the fact that I spent all that 
money on lessons and you can t even 
volley.

BRIDGET
(coyly)
Maybe. 

ANDREW
What s gotten into you lately?  

BRIDGET
What do you mean?

ANDREW
I don t know.  You re so... 
relaxed.  Agreeable.

BRIDGET
And you don t like it?

ANDREW
No.

Andrew stares at her.  A beat, then:

ANDREW (CONT D)
I love it.  Now let s go one more 
set.

INT. MARX APARTMENT - FOYER - LATER

A spent Bridget returns to the apartment.  As she steps out 
of the elevator, she hears BANGING coming from inside.

BRIDGET
Carms?

The BANGING CONTINUES.  Louder and more frequent.  Freaked 
out, Bridget tightens her grip on the tennis racquet and 
follows the banging down the hallway to a back bedroom.  
Bridget slowly opens the door to reveal...

JULIET, Andrew s daughter, riding a ZAC EFRON LOOK-A-LIKE, 
cowgirl style.  He s blindfolded and tied to the bedpost with 
a Hermes scarf. 

BRIDGET (CONT D)
Juliet?!

A mortified Juliet turns around. 37.


JULIET
What the fuck, Siobhan?!  Don t you 
knock?  

ZAC EFRON
(still blindfolded)
What s going on?

BRIDGET
(eyes narrowing)
Is that my scarf?  

JULIET
Send me the dry cleaning bill.

BRIDGET
Did you go through my drawers?

JULIET
Will you just leave already?!  God!  

ZAC EFRON
(confused)
I can t.  You tied me up.

JULIET
(to Zac Efron, annoyed)
I wasn t talking to you.

Bridget stalks down the hallway...

INT. MARX APARTMENT - SIOBHAN S CLOSET - CONTINUOUS

...into Siobhan s closet to find her dresser drawer opened, 
scarves spilling over the side.  A worried Bridget rushes 
over, but breathes a SIGH OF RELIEF when she finds the gun 
still nestled under the pile.  

Deciding not to take any more chances, Bridget picks up the 
gun and carefully tucks it in her purse.  She heads out of 
the closet...

INT. MARX APARTMENT - FOYER - CONTINUOUS 

...into the foyer, just as Zac Efron is getting in the 
elevator.  Juliet stands with her arms crossed.

ZAC EFRON
(to Juliet)
I ll text you.

As the elevator doors shut:38.


JULIET
Thanks a lot, Siobhan!

BRIDGET
I m sorry.  But I didn t know you 
were coming home.

JULIET
Well it s my house and I can stop 
by anytime I want. 

BRIDGET
Of course you can.  I just wasn t 
expecting you. 

JULIET
I shouldn t have to be at school 
during the summer anyway!  The only 
reason I stayed was to get away 
from you.

Bridget sighs, exhausted.

BRIDGET
Juliet, I don t want to fight.

JULIET
(rolling her eyes)
Since when? 

Juliet marches to her room and slams the door.  As she BLASTS 
MUSIC, THE PHONE RINGS.   

BRIDGET
(shaken, into phone)
Hello?

DOORMAN (V.O.)
(from phone)
Mrs. Marx, you have a visitor.  

BRIDGET
Please tell them it s not a good 
time.

DOORMAN (V.O.)
I m sorry.  But he was insistent.  
He s already on his way up. 

BRIDGET
Well who the hell is it?

DING.  As if to answer her question, the elevator doors open 
to reveal...39.


AGENT MACHADO.

As he steps out of the elevator, Bridget freezes.

AGENT MACHADO
Hello.

Bridget opens her mouth, but nothing comes out.

AGENT MACHADO (CONT D)
Siobhan Marx?

A relieved Bridget takes a deep breath.  After composing 
herself: 

BRIDGET
Yes?

AGENT MACHADO
It s amazing how much you look 
alike.  

Off Bridget feigning confusion:

AGENT MACHADO (CONT D)
I m sorry.  My name is Victor 
Machado.  I m with the FBI.  
(flashing his badge)
I m here to talk to you about your 
sister.   


END ACT THREE40.


ACT FOUR


INT. COFFEE SHOP - LATER

Bridget and Agent Machado sit in a booth.  As Bridget sips 
coffee, Machado organizes the sweeteners in the sugar caddy. 

AGENT MACHADO
Bridget was small time.  The only 
reason she started soliciting was 
to buy drugs.

BRIDGET
Is that supposed to make me feel 
better?

AGENT MACHADO
I just meant prostitution among 
addicts is more common than you 
think.  

BRIDGET
But you were going to drop the 
charges if she testified against 
this Macawi guy?

AGENT MACHADO
He s why we nabbed her in the first 
place.  The night of the murder, 
she was dancing in his club.  
Without getting into details, the 
trial hinged on what she saw.    

BRIDGET
(sighing)
And now she s a fugitive.

AGENT MACHADO
We re very concerned for her 
safety, Mrs. Marx.

BRIDGET
I don t get it.  If she didn t 
talk, why would you be concerned?

AGENT MACHADO
Because now that Macawi s a free 
man, he s gonna make sure he 
doesn t go back to prison.  
(delicately)
Silencing your sister is his only 
insurance.41.


Bridget shifts in her seat, uncomfortable.

AGENT MACHADO (CONT D)
I know this is a lot to take in.  
Especially when you re not familiar 
with this world.

BRIDGET
Trust me, I know how bad it can be.  
Even though we haven t spoken in 
years, there was a time when I was 
very familiar with Bridget s world.  
The one thing I want to know is how 
are you so sure she s still alive?  
Who s to say Macawi didn t get to 
her before the trial?

AGENT MACHADO
Because the night she fled, she 
assaulted a police officer.  

BRIDGET
Excuse me?

AGENT MACHADO
And stole his weapon.

Bridget stares out the window, genuinely shocked.

BRIDGET
My sister wouldn t do that.

AGENT MACHADO
But she did.

Tears well up in Bridget s eyes.

AGENT MACHADO (CONT D)
Are you okay, Mrs. Marx?

BRIDGET
I m sorry.  Like you said, it s a 
lot to take in.

Machado places a hand on her arm.

AGENT MACHADO
Look, if we find your sister, we 
won t be able to offer her the same 
deal as before.  But trust me, 
she ll be a lot safer in prison 
than she is out there.42.


EXT. UPPER WEST SIDE - NIGHT

A visibly shaken Bridget walks down the street.  As she 
reaches the entrance of The Dakota, she looks at the IMPOSING 
STATUE OF THE NATIVE AMERICAN staring down at her. 

INT. THE DAKOTA - MOMENTS LATER 

Bridget enters the dark penthouse.  After making sure the 
coast is clear, she reaches into her purse, pulls out the 
Glock, and wraps it in a discarded Au Bon Pain bag.  

As she looks for a place to hide the  smoking gun,  the 
DOORKNOB TURNS.  As Bridget tightens her grip on the bag...

Gemma enters, boxes in hand.  When she sees Bridget, she 
jumps.  

GEMMA
You scared me!  What are you doing 
here?

BRIDGET
I thought I d stop by to check on 
the progress.

GEMMA
At nine o clock at night?

BRIDGET
I was in the area.  
(holding up bag)
Had a taste for croissants.

GEMMA
Well I was going to surprise you.  
But since you re already here...

Gemma pulls out two jet bead chandelier sconces.  

GEMMA (CONT D)
Won t they look stunning at the end 
of the hallway?  Over the black 
lacquered console table?

Gemma heads down the hallway and holds up the sconces on 
either side of... 

A LARGE HOLE IN THE WALL.

GEMMA (CONT D)
Don t worry.  This will be dry 
walled by tomorrow.43.


BRIDGET
(smiling)
Perfect. 

As Gemma packs the sconces back in their boxes:

GEMMA
You know, darling, if it weren t 
for this pain in the ass 
renovation, I d be obsessing over 
who Henry s having an affair with.  

Bridget bristles.

GEMMA (CONT D)
Why else do you think I m here at 
nine o clock at night?
(smirking)
And don t worry.  I m not logging 
all the hours.

BRIDGET
At least you have a sense of humor 
about it.  Any idea who it might 
be?  

GEMMA
Well I went through the list of 
usual suspects: the trainer s gay,  
the maid s fat, and the wife s best 
friend...  

Bridget stiffens.

GEMMA (CONT D)
I m joking, darling!  Please, 
you re not his type, anyway.

Bridget reacts, not knowing if it s a compliment or insult.

BRIDGET
What about the nanny? 

GEMMA
I thought of that... but she has no 
ass.  And Henry s an ass man. 

Another compliment?  Or insult?

GEMMA (CONT D)
But come to think of it, Henry has 
been a bit too eager to spend time 
with the boys.44.


Gemma puts down the boxes and heads towards the door.

BRIDGET
Where are you going?

GEMMA
To call my therapist.

INT. THE HUDSON HOTEL - DAY

As Bridget enters the hotel room, Henry pulls her to him.  He 
starts to unbutton her shirt.  She pushes his hands away.

BRIDGET
I m not here to sleep with you.

HENRY
(kissing her neck)
Why?  I m here to sleep with you.

BRIDGET
(pulling back)
Henry!  Stop!

Wounded, Henry lets go and pours himself a finger of 
Macallan.

HENRY
I don t get it.  Two weeks ago we 
were planning a trip over Fourth of 
July.  Plotting a way to make love 
in the bathroom during the Bryant s 
dinner party.  Figuring out if I 
could leave Gemma and still see the 
boys.  How you could leave Andrew 
and not be broke. 

As he takes a swig of scotch:

HENRY (CONT D)
Am I losing my mind here?

BRIDGET
No.

HENRY
Then what is it?

Bridget heaves a belabored sigh.

BRIDGET
Gemma s on to us.45.


HENRY
No she s not.  She just praised the 
latest draft of my novel.  Said I m 
an amazing husband.

BRIDGET
Well she was lying.  She told me 
she thinks you re cheating on her.

HENRY 
(surprised)
Who does she think it is?

BRIDGET
She s not sure.  So I suggested the 
nanny.

HENRY
Annafried s a lesbian.

BRIDGET
Well I couldn t think of what else 
to say.

HENRY
How  bout  Henry s the perfect guy 
and he would never cheat on you?! 

Bridget shoots him a wry look.

BRIDGET
We have to lay low for awhile.

Henry puts his arms around her waist.

HENRY
I ve been trying to lay low.

BRIDGET
(firmly)
There s too much at risk, Henry.  
If you really love me, you ll stay 
away.

As Bridget sails out of the room, a frustrated Henry pours 
himself another drink.

INT. OFFICE BUILDING - LATER

Bridget enters a sleek office building, takeout in hand.  As 
she approaches an enormous glass office, she sees...

Juliet and Andrew, arguing inside.  Andrew slams a file down 
on his desk.  Juliet starts to SOB.  46.


Amidst the chaos, a teary-eyed Juliet spots Bridget 
approaching.  As she shoots Bridget a hateful look, Siobhan s 
CELL PHONE RINGS.  Bridget steps into the hallway to answer 
it. 

BRIDGET
(into cell)
Hello?

DR. SERDEN (V.O.)
(from cell)
Mrs. Marx?  This is Dr. Serden.  I 
hope I m not reaching you at a bad 
time, but you didn t show up for 
your appointment.

BRIDGET
I m so sorry.  I must ve forgotten 
to mark it in my book.  

DR. SERDEN (V.O.)
Well reschedule when you can, 
because your blood work came back 
positive.

BRIDGET
(concerned)
Is that a good thing?

DR. SERDEN (V.O.)
No.  
(a beat)
A great thing.  Congratulations.  
You re about six weeks along. 

BRIDGET
I m pregnant?

Off a stunned Bridget, we...


END ACT FOUR47.


ACT FIVE

INT. OFFICE BUILDING - SAME

As Bridget reels from Dr. Serden s news:

ANDREW (O.C.)
Wow.  I wasn t expecting that.

Bridget turns around to see Andrew, standing behind her.  As 
she hangs up her cell:

BRIDGET
Neither was I.

After an awkward beat:

ANDREW
Well... let s consider it a happy 
accident.

As Andrew kisses Bridget on the cheek:

BRIDGET
Do you really mean that?

ANDREW
Absolutely.  I think it s great. 
Besides, it ll take my mind off of 
work.
(discreetly)
They re auditing us next week.

BRIDGET
Should we be nervous?

ANDREW
No.  Let s worry about more 
important things.

Andrew touches Bridget s belly.  She offers up a small smile 
and hands over the takeout container.

BRIDGET
I brought you lunch.  But I didn t 
know Juliet would be here.  Why was 
she crying?

A puffy-eyed Juliet exits Andrew s office.

ANDREW
It s a long story.  We ll talk 
about it later.48.


As Juliet approaches:

ANDREW (CONT D)
Guess what, Jules?  You re going to 
be a big sister!

JULIET
Are you serious?

ANDREW
Yeah.  Isn t it great?

Juliet does an about face back into Andrew s office and slams 
the door.

ANDREW (CONT D)
I guess she won t be baby sitting.

INT. MARX APARTMENT - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

Bridget digs through Siobhan s jewelry drawer, looking for a 
pair of earrings.  As she lifts a velvet tray, a photograph 
falls out.

CLOSE ON a Polaroid of Siobhan, holding a LITTLE BOY.  On the 
bottom it reads:  SIOBHAN AND SEAN (2 YEARS OLD).   As a tear 
falls on the picture: 

ANDREW (O.C.)
The car s here!  You ready?

PULL OUT as Bridget tucks the picture back under the tray and 
wipes away her tears.  

BRIDGET
(calling out)
I ll be right there!

She reaches into her purse and removes a pocket-sized twelve 
step book.  She flips to a dog eared page and glances at an 
underlined passage that reads: 

 MISTAKES AREN'T TRAGEDIES.  BUT PLEASE, HIGHER POWER, HELP 
ME LEARN FROM THEM.   

Bridget shuts the book, puts on her earrings, and exits, as 
we...

CUT TO:49.


INT. DAVID BURKE TOWNHOUSE - LATER

A chic retro modern restaurant on the Upper East Side.  
Bridget and Andrew sit nestled in a red booth.  Gemma and 
Henry sit across from them.  

GEMMA
(squealing)
So that s why you haven t been 
smoking, you dirty bird!  

Gemma leans over the table and kisses Bridget and Andrew.

GEMMA (CONT D)
Isn t that marvelous, Henry?

Everyone turns to Henry, who s quietly nursing a scotch.

HENRY
(dryly)
Marvelous.

Bridget shoots him a warning look.

GEMMA
Ignore him.  He s just upset 
because his editor doesn t like his 
new pages.

HENRY
(pissed)
Gemma!

GEMMA
What?  Don t let your bad mood get 
in the way of their good news.

Henry lifts his glass to Andrew.

HENRY
Congratulations.

Andrew clinks Henry s glass.

ANDREW
Thanks, buddy.  We re really happy.

Bridget smiles, as Andrew gives her a long kiss.

GEMMA
Now, now.  Let s not go for baby 
number two so soon.
(giggling)
At least not in public.50.


As Andrew pulls back, Henry s eyes bore into Bridget.

HENRY
Excuse me.  I m not feeling too 
well.

Henry heads to the restroom, as we...

CUT TO:

EXT. UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT - LATER

As Bridget and Andrew exit their Towncar, Bridget notices...

HENRY, STANDING ACROSS THE STREET.

BRIDGET
Damn it!

ANDREW
What?

BRIDGET
(covering)
I meant to have the driver stop at 
Tasti D Lite.

ANDREW
Are they still open?

BRIDGET
Til midnight.  Trust me, a pregnant 
woman knows these things.

ANDREW
(laughing)
I ll run down the block.

BRIDGET
No.  I will.  Pregnant women also 
know how to cut to the front of the 
line.

Andrew smiles and enters the building.  Bridget crosses the 
street and stalks over to Henry.

BRIDGET (CONT D)
You don t get it, do you?

HENRY
(obviously drunk)
Oh I got it.  A whole earful at 
dinner.51.


BRIDGET
I m sorry.  I didn t want it to 
come out that way.

HENRY
You know that s my baby.

BRIDGET
No I don t.

HENRY
Oh come on, Siobhan!  We ve fucked 
a thousand times!  And you ve 
thrown Andrew a bone, what, once?  
Twice, in the past few months?

BRIDGET
It only takes one time.

HENRY
That s my kid!  And I m not just 
going to sit across from you at 
dinner and pretend I m happy for 
Andrew.

BRIDGET
Well what do you want me to do?

HENRY
Leave him.

BRIDGET
And live off what?  Andrew supports 
me and Gemma supports you.

HENRY
Not for long.  I m going to finish 
this draft and then things will be 
different.

Bridget doesn t look too convinced.

HENRY (CONT D)
If you don t leave him, we re over.

BRIDGET
Excuse me?

HENRY
Make a choice.  It s him or me.

BRIDGET
You want an answer like that now?52.


HENRY
Yes.

Bridget takes a deep breath.

BRIDGET
Then I choose Andrew.

As Bridget walks away, we PUSH IN on a seething Henry.

INT. MARX APARTMENT - FOYER - LATER

As Bridget exits the elevator, she s greeted by a mountain of 
cardboard boxes.

INT. MARX APARTMENT - MASTER BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Bridget enters to find Andrew, talking on the phone.

ANDREW
(into cell)
The wife just came in.  Can we 
finish this in the morning?

As he hangs up:

BRIDGET
What s with all the boxes?

ANDREW
They re Juliet s.

BRIDGET
Is she bringing them back to 
school?

ANDREW
From school.  She got kicked out.

BRIDGET
For what?

Andrew reaches into his night stand and pulls out...

A SMALL CELLOPHANE BAG, FILLED WITH WHITE POWDER.  

ANDREW
This is what our fight was about.

BRIDGET 
(mortified)
Oh my god.  53.


ANDREW
Tell me about it.

BRIDGET
Well is she staying here?  With us? 

ANDREW
It s not like I m gonna send her to 
live with her mother in Miami.  
Catherine will just make it worse.  

Off the realization that Bridget s sobriety just got more 
complicated, we...

CUT TO:

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - ROCK SPRINGS, WY - NIGHT

CLOSE ON A LEATHERY HAND, with an onyx pinky ring, KNOCKING 
on an apartment door.  

As Malcolm cracks open the door, we PULL OUT to reveal... 

BODAWAY MACAWI, STANDING ON HIS DOORSTEP.

BODAWAY
Where is she?

Malcolm and Bodaway lock eyes, as we...


END ACT FIVE54.


ACT SIX

EXT. KENNEDY INTERNATIONAL - DAY

Machado exits a cab and approaches the Delta terminal.  As he 
hands his ticket to a SKYCAP ATTENDANT, his cell phone rings.

AGENT MACHADO
(into cell)
This is Machado.  

FBI AGENT (V.O.)
(from cell)
Don t go anywhere just yet, Vic.  
Something came up.   

INT. MARX APARTMENT - JULIET S BEDROOM - DAY

Bridget and Andrew are in the midst of ransacking Juliet s 
bedroom.  As he empties drawers, she rifles through the 
closet.  Carmen enters with garbage bags.

BRIDGET
Thanks, Carms.

ANDREW
Did Juliet call?

CARMEN
Not yet, Mr. Marx.

As Carmen exits, shutting the door behind her:

BRIDGET
Relax.   Spring Awakening  is two 
and a half hours.  She won t be 
back til five.  

ANDREW
Are you sure this is absolutely 
necessary?  I feel like a douche 
bag.  Why don t we just read her 
diary while we re at it?

BRIDGET
Does she have one?

ANDREW
Siobhan.

BRIDGET
I told you, Andrew, I had a cousin 
who went through this.  
(MORE)55.

BRIDGET (CONT'D)
We have to make sure she s not 
hiding anything else.  If she s 
living under our roof, drugs are 
out of the question.

ANDREW
(impressed)
Looks like the baby s making you 
more maternal already.  
(a beat)
Uh-oh.

Andrew holds up an opened box of Trojans.

BRIDGET
That s not an  uh-oh.   Drugs, bad.  
Safe sex, good.

Andrew slyly smiles.  

BRIDGET (CONT D)
What?

He kisses Bridget.  She kisses him back, finally succumbing 
to her attraction for her sister s husband.  As they fall 
onto the bed, we...

CUT TO:

INT. MARX APARTMENT - JULIET S BEDROOM - LATER

Post coital, Bridget and Andrew lie on Juliet s bed.  As he 
tenderly caresses her shoulder:

ANDREW
That was... different.

BRIDGET
Good different?  Or bad different?

ANDREW
Amazing.  But I gotta be honest, 
after what happened last time, I 
thought you d never let me touch 
you again.

BRIDGET
You make it sound so awful.  It s a 
happy accident, remember?

ANDREW
(darkening)
I wasn t talking about your getting 
pregnant.  
(MORE)56.

ANDREW (CONT'D)
From now on, I m going to be the 
husband you deserve.  I promise.

PUSH IN on Bridget, wondering what the hell happened, as 
we...

CUT TO:

INT. BUS STATION - EAST HAMPTON - NIGHT

Machado enters the bus station alongside the FBI AGENT from 
the phone.

FBI AGENT
...found him breaking into her 
locker.  Said  the bitch deserved 
it.  

The FBI agent gestures to the SAME HOMELESS MAN, WHO ASKED 
BRIDGET FOR CHANGE, IN HANDCUFFS.

FBI AGENT (CONT D)
They didn t think much of it, until 
they found this...

Machado and the FBI agent approach a pried open locker to 
see...

BRIDGET S DUFFLE INSIDE.  

Machado searches the duffle, pulling out Bridget s cell phone 
and wallet.

FBI AGENT (CONT D)
Looks like your girl s been here, 
after all.

Machado then pulls out a letter addressed to  BRIDGET 
CAFFERTY  from  SIOBHAN MARX. 

AGENT MACHADO
Her sister said they haven t spoken 
in years.

FBI AGENT
Think she might be hiding her?

AGENT MACHADO
If she is, she s a damn good liar.57.


INT. BROADWAY PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH - RECTORY - SAME

Narcotics Anonymous.  In the heart of Harlem.  As the meeting 
winds down with the Serenity Prayer, Bridget glances at her 
cell.   ONE MISSED CALL FROM GEMMA.   

As Bridget exits the church rectory, she hits  PLAY  and 
brings the phone to her ear.      

GEMMA (V.O.)
(from cell)
It s me.  Meet me at the apartment 
in an hour.  The workers should be 
gone by then.  
(whispering)
I think I know who Henry s having 
an affair with.

INT. THE DAKOTA - LATER

As Bridget tentatively enters the dark penthouse, she glances 
down the hallway to see...

THE HOLE IN THE WALL HAS BEEN COVERED.  

BRIDGET
(calling out)
Gemma?

GEMMA (O.C.)
Out here.

EXT. THE DAKOTA - TERRACE - MOMENTS LATER

Bridget steps out on the terrace to find a tear-stained 
Gemma.  

BRIDGET
Talk to me.

GEMMA
You were wrong.  The nanny s a 
dyke.  I asked her about Henry and 
she hit on me.  Not that it 
matters.  I know who it is.

Gemma looks at a nervous Bridget.  A tense beat, then:  

GEMMA (CONT D)
The bastard s fucking the twins  
preschool teacher!58.


BRIDGET
(relieved)
Come on.

GEMMA
I caught him flirting with her this 
morning.  He swears it was nothing, 
but as we know, he s full of shit.  

As Gemma begins to tear up again:

BRIDGET
You re going to get through this. 

GEMMA
(sniffling)     
I know, darling.  With the help of 
friends like you.

A guilty Bridget hugs Gemma, as we...

CUT TO:

INT. THE DAKOTA - HALLWAY - LATER

As Bridget and Gemma wait for the elevator:

BRIDGET
Shit.  I left my purse on the 
terrace.

GEMMA
I ll go back.

BRIDGET
No.  I ll go.  You get home to the 
boys.

EXT. THE DAKOTA - TERRACE - MOMENTS LATER

Bridget steps back onto the terrace and grabs Siobhan s 
purse.  As she heads back inside...

INT. THE DAKOTA - CONTINUOUS

...Patsy Cline s  I FALL TO PIECES  begins to ECHO throughout 
the empty penthouse.

BRIDGET
(startled)
Gemma?

No answer.  As Bridget walks into the foyer:59.


BRIDGET (CONT D)
Gemma?  Is that you?

Still no answer.  CLOSE ON a confused Bridget, as she bends 
down to shut off the CD player.  As she stands back up, we 
PULL OUT to reveal...  

A MAN IN A BLACK SKI MASK, STANDING BEHIND HER, HOLDING A 
TIRE IRON.  

As an unsuspecting Bridget turns around, the man in black 
lifts the tire iron.  Bridget SCREAMS.  And just as he s 
about to strike, she ducks out of the way.  The tire iron 
grazes the CD player, inadvertently turning it back on.  

AS PATSY CLINE S HAUNTING VOICE BEGINS TO RESONATE AGAIN, a 
terrified Bridget makes a bee line for the front door.  She 
tries to open it, but it jerks to a stop.  She looks up to 
see that the top chain is still fastened.  As Bridget 
struggles to unlock it...    

The man in black goes to strike again.  Bridget grabs a two-
by-four, blocking the tire iron.  But the force of the thrust 
sends her crashing to the ground.  As she struggles to get 
up, the man in black hits her knee.  Bridget SCREAMS in 
agony. 

As the man in black begins to close in, a hysterical Bridget 
scoots herself backwards down the hallway.  

BRIDGET (CONT D)
(sobbing)
Please stop!

The man in black lunges at her.  Bridget narrowly escapes 
each blow.  She continues to push herself further and further 
back until...

There s nowhere else to go.  She s cornered at the end of the 
hallway.  As the man in black raises his tire iron again:

BRIDGET (CONT D)
(pleading)
Please don t do this!  

And just as he s about to crack Bridget s skull, she deflects 
his arm, sending the tire iron deep into the wall.  The man 
in black tries to dislodge the tire iron, but it s stuck.  It 
won t budge. 

Bridget and the man in black lock eyes in a stalemate, as 
we...

CUT TO:60.


INT. THE DAKOTA - MOMENTS LATER

Just as in the teaser, A THUMPING NOISE IS HEARD amidst the 
haunting melody of  I FALL TO PIECES.  

The man in black, now on all fours and ONLY SEEN FROM THE 
BACK, bashes something against the wall.  THE CAMERA TILTS 
over his shoulder to reveal he s straddling a bloody Bridget.  
As the man s mammoth gloved hands cradle her head, it becomes 
painfully clear what he s been bashing.  

Bridget s glazed eyes flutter, on the verge of passing out.  
But not before uttering:

BRIDGET
You have the wrong girl.

With one final blow, the man in black brutally SMASHES HER 
HEAD STRAIGHT THROUGH THE WALL.  And just as Bridget is about 
to lose consciousness, her head falls to the side.  From HER 
BLURRY POV, we see...  

THE AU BON PAIN BAG, buried deep inside the wall.  

Bridget weakly reaches for the bag.  And just as she pulls 
out the Glock: 

BRIDGET (CONT D)
I m not Bridget, asshole.

Bridget shakily shoots the man in black.  As he clutches his 
bloody chest:  

MAN IN BLACK
(gasping)
Who the hell is Bridget?

The man in black collapses.  A badly hurt Bridget achingly 
drags herself over to him.  She checks for a pulse.  Nothing.  
As she slowly removes his ski mask, her eyes go wide when she 
discovers... 

IT S NOT BODAWAY MACAWI.  Rather, an UNRECOGNIZABLE FACE.  
Confused, Bridget digs into his pockets to find... 

A candid photograph of her sister, in her signature Hermes 
scarf, marked  SIOBHAN MARX. 

Bridget looks mortified, as it dawns on her that the hit man 
wasn t after her.  

THE HIT WAS INTENDED FOR HER SISTER SIOBHAN.  61.


Off the realization that Bridget stepped into the wrong 
person s shoes, we...

CUT TO:

EXT. STREET - SAME

CLOSE ON a graffitied pay phone, as it RINGS.  A WOMAN S HAND 
enters into frame, answering it.

WOMAN (O.C.)
(into phone)
Hello?

MAN (V.O.)
(from phone)
We have a problem.   

PULL OUT to reveal the identity of the woman talking on the 
pay phone.  Blood red lips, oversized sunglasses, and a 
Hermes scarf make it unmistakably...

SIOBHAN MARX, who s very much alive.  She purses her lips and 
lights a cigarette, as we...
