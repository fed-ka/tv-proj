801801EXT. FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH - NIGHT - TO ESTABLISH

      SUPER: TWO MONTHS AGO

      A modest church, well kept and warmly lit.  The strains of
      a Gospel Choir drift out onto the street:

                                            GOSPEL CHOIR (O.S.)
                        Every time I feel the spirit
                        Moving in my heart I will pray...


802802INT. FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH - NIGHT

      The full-out rehearsal of a GOSPEL CHOIR fills the space
      with explosive rhythms and joy.  Among them DEREK WORTH,
      19, black, a glorious tenor whose voice soars above the
      rest.

                                            DEREK
                              (sings)
                        My Lord he done just what he said He
                        healed the sick and raised the dead...

      REVEREND THOMAS BELL, 50's, black, the Choir Director,
      stands at the piano, his face lit as he guides his singers.

                                            BELL
                              (singing along)
                        Jesus Christ the King of Heaven
                        Jesus Christ the King of All.

      The pews are sprinkled with onlookers.  In the final row
      sits GAVRIEL LARCA, a Portuguese Immortal, 40's, angular
      with piercing dark eyes and long hair.  His gaze is locked
      on

      DEREK

        transported, eyes closed, as he raises his voice in the
      final refrain:

                                            DEREK & THE CHOIR
                              (singing)
                        Every time I feel the spirit
                        Moving in my heart I will pray.

      As the last notes die away, Reverend Bell smiles up at his
      charges.

                                            BELL
                            (with a smile)
                        Hallelujah and amen.

      Rehearsal is over.  The choir members break ranks, pulling
      off their robes to reveal a collection of casual clothes. 
      As they head out we see

      LARCA

      Leave his pew and move to the door.

      DEREK

      Gathers up the robes and songbooks, generally neatening
      up.

                                            BELL
                        Well done, Derek.  You truly lift up
                        your voice with a joyful noise.

                                            DEREK
                            (shy)
                        Thank you, Reverend Bell.

                                            BELL
                            (with a smile)
                        Don't thank me, thank the Lord. 
                        He's the one who gave you your gift.

                                            DEREK
                        Amen to that.  I'll see you tomorrow
                        night.

                                            BELL
                        Don't be late.  Libby's been cooking
                        for two days.


803803EXT. FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER

      Reverend Bell stands at the top of the stairs in the open
      door as Derek heads out.  Derek bounces down the stairs,
      waves back at the Rev, then turns down the dark street.

      He doesn't notice

      A CAR

      Pulling out from the curb.  Dark and ominous, its windows
      tinted.



                                                                (CONTINUED)96508  "Little Tin God"       3.      Final Shooting Script 9/9/96



803CONTINUED:803

      TRACKING - FROM INSIDE THE CAR

      It speeds up, pulling alongside Derek.  The window slides
      down.  Derek is centered in the open window.

      STREET - RESUME

      The car paces alongside Derek.

      ON THE CAR

      As little explosions light the corner of the window --
      GUNSHOTS.

      REVEREND BELL

      At the top of the stairs.  Reacts in horror to the sound
      of gunfire.

      DEREK

      Goes down, hit.

      BELL

      Races toward Derek as

      THE CAR

      Speeds up and pulls away.  As it does, Bell sees

      LARCA

      In the window.  A single image of Derek's killer -- Bell
      will never forget it.

      BELL

      Goes to his knees by Derek's body, a cry of anguish on his
      lips.

                                            BELL
                        Oh, Lord, no...  No...

      GOSPEL WAILING carries us to --


804804EXT. MORGUE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT


805805INT. MORGUE - NIGHT

      Cold.  Sterile.  Three bodies lie on steel tables, TAGS on
      their toes.  The room is deathly still, dark, abandoned.



                                                                (CONTINUED)96508  "Little Tin God"       4.      Final Shooting Script 9/9/96



805CONTINUED:805

      LARCA

      drifts into the room, dressed in a linen robe, looking
      like he's just stepped out of a Titian painting.  He looms
      over one of the tables and lifts back the SHEET.

      DEREK

      Gasps back to life, a harsh, unexpected breath.  He looks
      up --

      DEREK'S POV

      Larca towers above him, silhouetted by fluorescent lights
      which crown him with a halo.  His hands are firmly on
      Derek's chest.  His voice resonant, impressive:

                                            LARCA
                        Rise up, Derek.

      RESUME SCENE

      Derek props himself up, looking at himself.  Then to the
      bodies beside him.

                                            DEREK
                        I'm alive.

                                            LARCA
                        You are now.

                                            DEREK
                              (looking around)
                        Where am I?

                                            LARCA
                        In the morgue.

                                            DEREK
                            (a quaver)
                        I was shot.

      His hands go to his unmarked chest.

                                            LARCA
                        You were dead.
                              (beat)
                        But I have healed your wounds so
                        that you may glorify my Name.  I
                        have brought you safely through the
                        shadows of the Valley of Death, and
                        I have called upon you to serve me
                        in a Holy War against my enemy.

      Derek feels his jaw drop as he stares up at the imposing
      figure of Larca.

      FADE IN:


806806EXT. CLEARING - DAY

      MacLeod is out jogging in the woods.  He's worked up a
      well-earned sweat and is ready to call it quits.  He veers
      towards the road where his car is parked.  As he approaches,
      he feels the BUZZ.  He slows to a halt.

      LUKE

      An Immortal, 24, is waiting by the car.  He's clean-cut,
      cocky, and built like a football player.  And he holds a
      sword, raised and ready.

      MACLEOD

      Circles warily, eyeing Luke -- and Luke's blade.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Duncan MacLeod.

                                            LUKE
                        I know who you are.

      And with no more warning than that, Luke charges.  MACLEOD
      dodges, rolls out of the way.

      LUKE

      Is big and powerful, but not well trained -- he overswings. 

      MACLEOD

      sweeps Luke's legs out from under him.

      LUKE

      Goes down.

      MACLEOD

      Scrambles to the T-Bird, reaches in for his katana.  He
      gets his hand on it, his body extended across the seat,
      neck vulnerable, when suddenly his eyes go wide as he gets
      ANOTHER BUZZ.

      He spins, bringing the katana up as he does, barely in
      time to block the sword swinging for his neck.  The blade
      glances off as MacLeod finds himself facing

806CONTINUED:806

      DEREK

      sweating from nerves, his first time in battle.  Behind
      him, Luke has regained his feet.

      MacLeod is battle ready, sword raised, looking back and
      forth between his two young opponents.

                                            MACLEOD
                        You can't do this.

      No answer.  Instead, they both close on him.

                                            MACLEOD
                        This is against the rules!

                                            DEREK
                        Rules?  This isn't a game

      DEREK

      Swings.

      MACLEOD

      Ducks the blade, comes up underneath it, body-checking
      Derek.

      DEREK

      Hits the ground, winded.  His sword goes flying.

      MACLEOD

      Turns to face Luke as he feels A THIRD BUZZ.  And before
      MacLeod can react

      A BOLA

      Flies out of the woods, tangles around his ankles.

      MACLEOD

      Is down.  He looks up to see

      DEREK

      On his feet again, Luke, and newcomer ENRIQUE (25, Peruvian,
      with a hard, determined look) closing on him.

      Individually, none of them would stand a chance.  3-on-1,
      MacLeod isn't so sure.





                                                                (CONTINUED)96508  "Little Tin God"       8.      Final Shooting Script 9/9/96



806CONTINUED: (2)806

      MACLEOD

      quickly slices through the cords of the bola, freeing his
      legs, and rolls to his feet as the young fighters approach. 
      He takes their measure -- bulky Luke, implacable Enrique,
      and tense, jumpy Derek -- and picks his battle.  He feints
      toward Luke, then turns and runs over Derek.


807807EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS

      MacLeod runs for it through the trees.

      FOLLOWING

      The three young Immortals chase after him.

                                            ENRIQUE
                        Split up!  Get around him!

      Luke and Derek angle off.

      ON MACLEOD

      Running.

      MACLEOD'S POV

      Through the trees, he spots the STEEPLE of a roadside
      church.  He heads for it.

      ANOTHER PART OF THE WOODS - DEREK

      Moves carefully through the trees, sword out, tense.  He's
      singing quietly to calm himself, the song from the Teaser:

                                            DEREK
                        Every time I feel the spirit    
                        Moving in my heart I will pray.

      MACLEOD

      Steps out from behind a tree, katana drawn.

                                            MACLEOD
                            (dry)
                        You know "Rock of Ages"?

      MacLeod doesn't give Derek time to recover his wits.  He
      knocks Derek's sword aside and backs him against a tree,
      katana to the young Immortal's throat.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Who are you?

807CONTINUED:807

      Derek's answer is shaky, his throat dry, his fear and
      confusion obvious.

                        An angel of the Lord.

      MacLeod doesn't know what to make of this, but there's no
      time to pursue it.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Sure you are.

      He grabs Derek and drags him bodily toward --

      A small structure by the roadside.  Only in use for an
      hour on Sundays, now it's shuttered.  MacLeod hauls Derek
      out of the woods in a hammer lock, hustling him across the
      lawn.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Move.


809809EXT. CHURCH CEMETERY - DAY

      MacLeod arrives, dragging the struggling Derek with him.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Sit!
                              (Derek does)
                        Now you're going to tell me what
                        this is all about.

      Derek cowers, lips moving in prayer.

                                            DEREK
                        Yea, though I walk through the valley
                        of the shadow of death...  I will
                        fear no evil, for Thou art with me.

                                            MACLEOD
                              (frustrated)
                        I'm not going to hurt you.

                                            DEREK
                              (louder)
                        Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort 
                        me.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Will you stop!

      Derek stops his prayer.

      MacLeod stares at him.

                                            MACLEOD
                        You really have no idea what you
                        are?

                                            DEREK
                        I told you.

      MacLeod reacts.  Now he's seen everything.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Right.  You're an angel and that
                        makes me what?

                                            DEREK
                        You know what you are, Satan.

                                            MACLEOD
                        I'm the Devil?  You actually believe
                        that.
                              (beat)
                        Tell me, bright eyes, why would the
                        Devil take you to holy ground?

      Before Derek can answer, they get the BUZZ again.  MacLeod
      turns as Enrique and Luke coming running in, sweating and
      out of breath, their swords out.

                                            MACLEOD
                        So are you guys with Charlie's Angels
                        or the California Angels?

      Enrique raises his blade.

                                            ENRIQUE
                        It's time to send you back to Hell.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Put up your sword.  This is Holy

      They keep coming.

                              (emphatic)

                        us.

                        here.

      As if on cue, they all feel the BUZZ.  MacLeod turns as
      Larca steps in behind him.  He wears the same linen robe
      as we saw before, his hair flowing and saint-like.

                                            LARCA
                        Well said, Derek.

      MacLeod looks from the three young Immortals to Larca. 
      Cold recognition.

                        Larca.

      And off Larca's beatific nod --

810810EXT. PERUVIAN JUNGLE - 1830 - DAY

      MacLeod is with his guide, PACO, 40's.  They're exploring
      the deep jungle, the sound of Peruvian pipes and rain forest
      birds filling the air.  Paco is sweating.  He stops to
      drink.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Are you all right?

                                            PACO
                        A touch of fever.  It's nothing that
                          a night's sleep on a soft bed won't
                        cure.

                                            MACLEOD
                        And when do you think we'll find
                        that bed?

                                            PACO
                        It is not much further, Se or MacLeod. 
                        Perhaps tomorrow.

      MacLeod pushes aside a vine sourly.

                        Then we're not lost?

                                            PACO
                              (reassuring)
                        We will reach Huaral tomorrow.  Two
                        days at the latest.
                              (beat)
                        The ruins are truly magnificent,
                        Se or, you'll see.  I have made this
                        trip a thousand times.

                                            MACLEOD
                            (to himself)
                        We're lost.

      The calls of the birds fall suddenly SILENT.  MacLeod
        straightens, alert.  He puts a hand on Paco's shoulder to
      stop him.

                                            PACO
                              (irritated)
                        What is it?

      MacLeod points ahead.

      MACLEOD'S POV

      Two fiercely painted warriors emerge from the bush.  They
      aim slim longbows notched with six-foot arrows directly at
      the explorers' chests.

      RESUME

      Paco's eyes narrow, never leaving the native warriors.

                                            MACLEOD
                        What tribe?

                                            PACO
                              (shaking his head)
                        They shouldn't be here.

                                            MACLEOD
                        No, we shouldn't be here.

      Paco leans back into MacLeod, slowly pulling out his knife:

                                            PACO
                              (whispers)
                        If we fight we have a chance.

                                            MACLEOD
                            (in a low voice)
                        I don't think so.

                        That you can see.

      Another half-dozen warriors seemingly materialize out of
      the bush on either side, their wickedly barbed arrowheads
      pointed right at the explorers' hearts.


811811EXT. MOCHE VILLAGE - PERUVIAN JUNGLE - 1830 - DAY

      In the center, an ancient Moche temple.  It is still
      inspiring after centuries of deterioration.  MacLeod and
      Paco are led by ropes tied around their necks, their hands
      lashed behind their backs and most of their clothing
      removed.  They're uncomfortably hot, flinching from insect
      bites.

      They are brought to the center of the village.  Wary
      villagers, suspicious of strangers, begin to surround them,
      taunting and spitting.

      MacLeod tries to elicit a response in Spanish:

                                            MACLEOD
                        Habla Espa ol?  Habla Espa ol?

      No response.  He tries Portuguese:

                                            MACLEOD
                        Fala Portugues?  Fala Portugues?

      Still nothing.  He tries an Indian dialect:

                                            MACLEOD
                          Quechua?  Quechua?
                              (beat; to himself)
                        You watch: they'll all speak English.

      Then, the BUZZ.  MacLeod tenses -- he's in no position to
      defend himself.

      LARCA

      Emerges from the temple, dressed in king-like finery, draped
      in gold and silver -- truly a vision of Moche splendor.

      At his side, his wife, the exquisite COYANTU, 22.

      The villagers pull back from the prisoners, an act of
      respect to the approaching Larca.  The two Immortals take o
      ne another's measure.  MacLeod is painfully aware that t
      his is not a match set on equal footing.

      Larca raises his arm, majestically, pointing to MacLeod:

                          Rimasun.
                              ("Bring him forward")

      Warriors roughly push MacLeod forward and shove him down
      onto his knees.

      He looks up at Larca, his face proud:

                                            MACLEOD
                        I am Duncan MacLeod of the clan
                          MacLeod.

                        the Moche people.

      Off MacLeod's reaction we --


812812INT. LARCA'S HUT - MOCHE VILLAGE - 1830 - DAY

      MacLeod and Larca dine.  Sumptuous pilings of food crowd a
      colorful rug.  Everything is congenial.  Larca's wife serves
      them.  As she pours wine for MacLeod from an ornate gold
      pitcher:

                                            MACLEOD
                        Thank you.

      She does not respond.

                                            LARCA
                        She understands nothing of your
                          language.  Or of your world.
                              (fondly)
                        All she knows, all she has ever known,
                        is this village.

      He reaches out, touches her face gently.  She gazes at him
      with a mixture of adoration and submission.

                                            LARCA
                        She is called Coyantu.  Born on the
                        day of Coya Raymi, Festival of the
                        Moon.  It is a time of great
                          celebration for the Moche.

      Larca holds out a cup for Coyantu.  She obediently reaches
      for a silver pitcher and pours him wine.  He nods to her
      and smiles.

                        You see...
                              (beat)
                        The Moche are an ancient people. 
                        Their science and arts rivaled the
                        best of Inca, yet they produced theirs
                        a thousand years earlier.  Some of
                        their traditions go back a hundred
                          generations.  They called me God,
                        who was I to argue?

      He holds up a piece of jewelry for MacLeod to see.  On it,
      an image of a man, arms outflung, surrounded by jagged
      bolts.

                                            LARCA
                          Remarkable, is it not?  It was cast
                          Fourteen hundred years ago.

      MacLeod examines the pendant.  It does look remarkably
      like an Immortal receiving a Quickening.

                                            MACLEOD
                        So you're not the first one of us to

                        God.  That doesn't make it right.

                        years I have protected them.  Hidden
                        them from the likes of Cortez and
                        those other butchers.  They survive
                        because of me.  They have grown strong
                        and remained free.

                        cared for.  Think about it.  Isn't
                        that a god's covenant with his chosen?

      Larca maintains a steady gaze, his mood darkening.

      MACLEOD'S POV

      The interior of the hut slowly comes into focus as MacLeod
      awakes, shaking off the effects of the drug.  The remains
      of the dinner are on the rug in front of him.  And leaning
      on the wall, out of reach, his sword.

      NEW ANGLE

      MacLeod can't move, he's securely tied to a stake.  He
      kicks out angrily, knocking aside bowls of food, struggling
      with his bonds.  No luck.

      From outside he hears a SCREAM.  Paco.

      window into the square.

      MACLEOD'S POV

      Bound, yelling and cursing, Paco is being dragged toward
      another part of the village by a group of chanting
      villagers.  The dais is surrounded by the villagers
        rhythmically chanting faster and faster.

821821EXT. LARCA'S SANCTUARY - TO ESTABLISH - NIGHT

      An unkempt chapel on the edge of an old disused cemetery.


822822INT. LARCA'S SANCTUARY - NIGHT

      Larca stands before the altar, arms outstretched over the
      bowed heads of his three Disciples, who kneel before him.

                        I am the One who made you.  I breathed
                        and your lungs filled with life.  I
                          whispered and you had purpose.  Is
                        this not true?

                                            ENRIQUE
                        Yes, my Lord.

                        You have not yet felt the sting of
                        my rage.  The bitter salt-water that
                        flows from these eyes would drown
                        you in guilt and seize up the very
                        marrow of your bones.  Am I not Power?

                                            LARCA
                        Then cry mercy unto me!  For I am
                        angered beyond rage by your failure
                        to bring me the head of Satan!

      ON DEREK

      His head bowed, eyes open, the fear and doubt clear on his
      face.  His hands, clasped together, squeeze hard, as though
      trying to hold his thoughts and emotions in.

      He crouches, peering intently into each face, one at a
      time.

      He settles on Derek, his tone soothing.

      Derek is sweating, terrified.

      grab hold of Derek's arms and lift him to his feet.

      Dawson stands behind the bar, reading from a manila folder

                        Larca's Chronicle goes back to 15th
                        century Portugal.  He was a lawyer
                        at the time.

                        After that, he became one of the
                        King's royal guard, and by 1510 he
                        Was a pirate on the high seas.

825825EXT. MOCHE VILLAGE - PERUVIAN JUNGLE - 1830 - NIGHT

      The FEVER has descended upon the village.  Funeral pyres
      burn with ghastly brightness.  An endless stream of linen-
      wrapped corpses are dragged to the flames and tossed in.

      VILLAGERS' FACES reflect their disease-and misery.  OTHERS
      are angry, staring and pointing at:

      LARCA'S HUT

      Larca stands at the doorway, a regal but sullen purveyor
      of his dying faithful.  Coyantu keeps herself slightly
      apart from him, her face hidden in shadow.

      Larca reacts to the realization that she, too, is ill.  He
      strokes her beautiful long hair, tears in his eyes.

      MacLeod is inside, securely bound.  He's haggard and
      frustrated -- a week of captivity has taken its toll.  He
      struggles against the hemp rope that cuts into his arms as
      Larca enters, a murderous rage building, his cutlass drawn.

                        Who's to say?

      He raises his blade.  Suddenly, WHHHFFFT.

      LARCA

      Is hit in the neck with a dart from a blowgun.  He pulls
      it out, stunned.  Looks at it in his hand for a frozen
      moment, then....

      Larca crumples to his knees as the poison takes effect on
      his system.  Coyantu stands at the doorway SCREAMING.

      MacLeod looks out beyond her:

      MACLEOD'S POV

      A villager lowers his blowgun.  Behind him, a crowd stands
      with knives and spears, poised to unleash their rage.

      The phosphorous smoke that billows from the fires provides
      an eerie backlight.

      RESUME SCENE

      As Larca collapses, his blade drops.  MacLeod swiftly
      maneuvers his bound hands in front of him and uses the
      blade to cut himself free.

      MacLeod retrieves his katana.  As the villagers charge the
      hut, Coyantu throws herself over Larca, protecting him.

      The villagers mob the fallen God.  The man who aimed the
      blowgun picks up Larca's fallen cutlass.  He turns on
      MacLeod.

      MACLEOD

      Kicks at the back of the hut, trying to breach it.  He
      breaks through the wall.


827827EXT. PERUVIAN JUNGLE - 1830 - NIGHT

      MacLeod tumbles out of the back of Larca's hut and runs
      for his life as the people of the village follow.

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:


828828INT. JOE'S - NIGHT - RESUME

      The file in front of Dawson is forgotten as he stares raptly
      at MacLeod, fascinated by the tale.

                                            MACLEOD
                          I barely got away with my life.  I
                        had no food, no water.  It took me
                        almost a month to reach Huaral.

      There's a beat as he shakes off the bleak memory.  Then:

                                            MACLEOD
                        What have you got on Larca since

                        about two years ago, he turned up
                        In Lima.

      Derek is in pain.  His hand is badly burned.

      Derek is on his knees, struggling to sing through tears.

                        That saved a wretch like me.

      ANOTHER ANGLE

      At the rear of the church, Reverend Bell enters.  He pauses
      to straighten a few pamphlets on a rack, then reacts as he
      hears the soft strains from the front:

                                            DEREK
                        I once was lost, but now I'm found

      Reverend Bell moves down the aisle toward the kneeling
      figure.  As he nears, he adds his voice to Derek's:

                                            DEREK & BELL
                        Was blind but now I see.

      Derek reacts to the voice, turns to look up at Bell, tears
      streaming down his face.

      REVEREND BELL

      Stares.  He doesn't back away.  His hand goes, almost
      unconsciously, to touch the tiny gold cross at his neck.

                                            BELL

      smile.

      Reverend Bell sits next to Derek.  He gingerly reaches out
      and touches him.

      A sense of overwhelming joy begins to rise up in the
      Reverend:

                        when He has brought you back to us?

      Derek squirms, unsure, the words not coming easily.

      Derek stops.  He's getting the BUZZ.  He jumps up, anxious,
      looking around.

      MACLEOD

      Walks in from the back of the church.  Derek puts himself
      between him and the Reverend.

                        But there are things you have to

                            (a look at Bell)
                        You should go, Reverend.

      Bell, wanting to protect Derek, steps in front of him.

      MacLeod is impressed with Bell's courage.  Tries to reassure
      him:

                        ask it if it can trust me.

      Bell considers a moment and moves off out of earshot.

                        And this time he'll die.

      Larca nods -- serene, mystic.

                                            LARCA
                        One of you will draw him into combat. 
                        Alone.

                              (beat)
                        One of us alone doesn't stand a
                        chance.

                                            LARCA
                          Exactly.
                              (beat)
                        The devil will claim the victory. 
                        And when he takes the head of one of
                        my chosen, all of my Goodness will
                        flow into him, and bring him to his
                        knees.
                              (beat)
                        While he's weak, you must strike his
                        head from his shoulders.

      Larca regards him a beat, then Luke.

                        Derek will be my martyr.


835835INT. JOE'S - DAY

      MacLeod and Dawson sit at a table with Reverend Bell.

                                            BELL
                        Derek was in fifteen foster homes by
                        the time he was ten.

                                            MACLEOD
                        And then he found you.

                                            BELL
                        He found God, I just happened to be
                        there at the time.  That boy didn't
                        have to be taught to believe.  He
                        took to it natural, like coming home.
                              (beat)
                        And when he sings... you can almost
                        feel the Lord coming down just to
                        listen.

      His voice cracks with emotion.

                                            BELL
                              (emotional)
                        Then he died...  It took a lot of p
                        raying for me to believe that was Go
                        d's plan.
                            (to MacLeod, still
                              amazed)
                        But he didn't die.

                                            MACLEOD
                              (quietly)
                        Larca counted on Derek's faith.  He
                        knew he could manipulate him with
                        it.

                        Guy got a taste for being worshipped,
                        Mac.
                              (beat)
                        That kind of power is addictive.  It
                        would be a temptation to any Immortal.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Or any man.

                                            BELL
                        This man.  Larca.  Does he have long
                        hair, cold black eyes like he's
                        looking right through you?

                                            MACLEOD
                        You've seen him?

                                            BELL
                        I saw him kill Derek.
                              (beat, in real horror)
                        He took him away from everything and
                          everyone he loved, to make him into
                        this thing, this killer.
                            (as a question)
                        And he thinks he has the right.

      MacLeod nods.

                                            BELL
                              (impassioned)
                        If this man can convince Derek to
                        follow him, to believe he's God....
                              (hates the thought)
                        What if he wasn't the only one?
                        What if others have done the same?
                              (beat)
                        Does it mean everything I believe is
                        based on a lie?

      MacLeod can sense a man nearing a crisis of faith.

                                            MACLEOD
                              (firm)
                        No.  Reverend, listen to me.  That's
                        not what it means.  Larca's the lie.

                                            BELL
                        What if he gathers more followers? 
                          A hundred... a thousand.  He has to
                        be stopped.

                                            MACLEOD
                        He'll be stopped.

                              (beat)
                        I put some people on it.  Found out
                        he's rented out that little chapel
                        next to the old St. Paul cemetery.

                        I'll drive you home.

                        No.  No... I think I'd rather walk.

      MacLeod stands up, polite and concerned.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Thank you, Reverend.  For trusting
                        me.  And for believing.

                            (a faint smile)
                        Faith is my specialty.

      Dawson and MacLeod watch Bell go out the door.  MacLeod
      turns to Dawson.

                                            MACLEOD
                        I'm going there.

                              (beat)
                        It'll be four to one, MacLeod.

                        And that makes five.  Maybe we'll
                        play some basketball.

      As MacLeod turns and walks out.

      A lone FIGURE carefully approaches the small church.

      REVEREND BELL

      Pauses outside.

                                            BELL
                        And he said "I will strike down upon
                        them with great vengeance and furious
                        anger those who attempt to poison
                        and destroy thy brothers."

      As he moves toward the church, we see he carries a .357
      Magnum in one hand, and a MACHETE in the other.


837837INT. LARCA'S SANCTUARY - CONTINUOUS

      Candles flicker, throwing dancing shadows across the walls. 
      Larca stands by the altar, Enrique and Luke flanking him,
      Derek kneeling before him.

                                            LARCA
                        To be ready for your battle, my child,
                        you must cleanse yourself of all
                        doubt.  You must be pure in heart,
                        pure in belief, pure in strength.
                              (beat)
                        Your eternal reward awaits.

      DEREK

      Looks up at him, calm, face composed.

                                            DEREK
                        I'm ready.

      Larca is about to answer, then reacts as the door at the
      back of the chapel slams open.

                                            LARCA
                        Who dares?

      Derek turns to see what Larca's looking at.

      It's Reverend Bell, light glinting off his blade.

                          Reverend Bell!  What are you doing
                        here?

                                            BELL
                        What are you doing here, Derek?
                        You know this man isn't God.
                            (to Larca, in fury)
                        What did you tell him?  Did you tell
                        him he'd go to Hell if he didn't
                        follow you?

                                            LARCA
                          I offered him my love, my
                          protection... and eternal life.
                              (beat, with a smile))
                        What more can God offer his soldiers?

      Bell's eyes narrow at the sacrilege.

                                            BELL
                        You're not God.  You're an
                          abomination.

      He raises the gun toward Larca.

                                            DEREK
                          Reverend, no!  He'll kill you!

                        He can't.

                        You may be safe from MacLeod on holy
                        ground, but you're not safe from me.

      He steps forward, gun aimed at Larca, machete glinting in
      his other hand.  Larca holds his ground, but his eyes are
      locked on the gun.

                                            LARCA
                        Will you desecrate the House of the
                        Lord?

      Bell shoots.

      ENRIQUE

      Jumps in front of Larca and takes the bullet for him.  He
      crumples, dead.

                        Now! 

      Luke is frozen with fear.  Bell's finger is on the trigger,
      Larca in his sights.  Then --

      Steps in front of Bell and puts his shaking hand on the
      gun, its barrel pointed into his belly.

      BELL

      Can't bring himself to fire into Derek.

                                            BELL
                        Derek!  Get away!

      Bell tries to wrench the gun free and get a clear shot at
      Larca, but Derek hangs on.

                                            DEREK
                        I can't let you do this.

      Larca steps up beside them.  He puts his hand over Derek's,
      wrenches the gun away from Bell.

      Bell tries to raise the machete; Larca takes it away from
      him easily, flings it across the room.

                                            LARCA
                            (to Derek)
                        Take him outside.  Beyond the
                          Cemetery.

      Bell reacts.  He knows what that means.  Derek takes his
      arm and pulls him out.

      MacLeod pulls up in his car.  He jumps out and strides to
      the chapel.

      MacLeod storms in, ready to throw down the gauntlet.

                        Larca!

      No answer.  The cavernous hall echoes back his voice.  No
      one's there.


841841EXT. FIELD NEAR LARCA'S SANCTUARY - LATE AFTERNOON

      Derek leads Reverend Bell by the arm.  Luke lays down
      Enrique's body.  Larca walks ominously behind.

                                            BELL
                        Derek, don't do this.

                                            DEREK
                            (a whisper)
                        I'm sorry.

      They all wait tensely.

                                            LARCA
                        You did well, Derek.  You proved
                          yourself my faithful servant.

      Larca walks over to Enrique's inert body.

                                            LARCA
                        Enrique gave his life in my service. 
                        He will be rewarded.

      Larca claps a hand over Enrique's chest where the bullets
      hit, and waits.

                                            LARCA
                        Live again, my son.  Your God commands
                        it.

      Enrique's eyes flutter.  He grabs his chest, sits up in
      shock.  Larca turns on Luke.

                                            LARCA
                        As for you.  You failed me when I
                        needed you most.  You lost your faith.

      Luke begins to back away, scared.

                                            LUKE
                        I couldn't help it.

                                            LARCA
                              (raising his hand)

841CONTINUED:841

      Luke is breathing hard, scared.  But he does as he's told
      and kneels.  Larca turns his back towards him and pulls
      out his sword.

                                            LARCA
                        I shall cleanse you of your sin.

                                            LUKE
                              (relieved)
                        Thank you.


842842EXT. LARCA'S SANCTUARY - LATE AFTERNOON

      MacLeod comes out of the chapel.  The Quickening lights
      the sky above the nearby field.

      MacLeod takes off at a run toward the light show.


843843EXT. FIELD NEAR LARCA'S SANCTUARY - LATE AFTERNOON

      Derek and Enrique watch, stunned, as the last bolt of light
      sputters into Larca.  He rises, his face suffused with an
        otherworldly satisfaction.  Steps toward Bell, who's on
      his knees, praying.

                                            LARCA
                            (to Derek)
                        Step away from the preacher.

      The pit of Derek's stomach suddenly fills with dread.  He
      hesitates.

                                            LARCA
                        I said step away.

      Larca raises Bell's gun, aims at Bell.

                                            DEREK
                        No..!

                                            LARCA
                        It is written.  "Thou shalt have no
                        other Gods before me."
                            (in a rage)
                        Step aside, Derek, I command it!

      Pause.  Derek is about to explode with his inner conflict.

                                            LARCA
                              (booming)
                          I command it!!

      Larca shoves Derek aside roughly and raises the gun.

                                            BELL
                            (to Larca and Derek)
                        May God have mercy on you both.

                                            LARCA
                              (shrill)
                        I am God!!

      He's about to pull the trigger when he gets the BUZZ.  He
      turns as

      MACLEOD

      Tackles him.  The gun goes flying.

      MacLeod pulls Bell hastily to his feet, gives him a shove
      toward:

                                            MACLEOD
                        Get back on Holy Ground!  Now!

      As Bell stumbles toward the cemetery and safety, MacLeod
      turns to face Larca.  He finds himself facing

      THREE IMMORTALS WITH SWORDS

      Larca is flanked by his two remaining disciples.

      Larca smiles.  He smells victory.

                                            LARCA
                          Enrique, Derek...
                              (indicating MacLeod)
                        Serve me well.

      MacLeod holds his katana at the ready, his eyes darting
      between his three opponents.  This will be the fight of
      his life.  Then --

      DEREK

      Hesitates a moment, then steps up beside Enrique.  He puts
      his blade to Enrique's throat.

                                            DEREK
                            (to Enrique)
                        Put it down.

                                            LARCA
                        What are you doing?

                                            DEREK
                        If you're God, you don't need us.

      Enrique hesitates.

                        I told you once.

      He uses the butt of his blade to knock Enrique unconscious,
      then kicks his sword away.  MacLeod acknowledges with a
      nod.  Then, to Larca:

                                            MACLEOD
                        By the rules, this time.  You and
                        me.

      Larca raises his sword.

                                            LARCA
                            (with hatred)
                        Because of you, my people died.
                        Because of you they turned on me.

                        I was entombed for 150 years.

      Larca attacks.  He fights with a ferocity that speaks of
      long-held rage and hatred.

                                            LARCA
                        And all I dreamed about was this
                        moment.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Keep dreaming.

      Larca's good, fighting with passion and skill, but MacLeod
      matches him blow for blow, tiring him.  It enrages Larca.

                                            LARCA
                        I am God!

                                            MACLEOD
                              (mocking him)
                          I thought you'd be taller.

      He comes at MacLeod with a wild slash which MacLeod gets
      under.  And once he's inside Larca's guard, it's all over. 
      Larca's body falls.

      The Quickening lights up the field like a magnetic wave
      across the rough-stubbled ground, heaving up into a huge
      burst of lightning and thunder.

      MACLEOD

      Is buffeted by the storm that is Larca.

      DEREK

      Watches in awe.  As the Quickening subsides

      ENRIQUE

      Takes advantage of Derek's distraction to pull free, and
      scramble for his sword.  He stands with the blade in his
      hand as MacLeod rises from the Quickening.  MacLeod's eyes,
      still shining with exertion, bore into Enrique.

                                            MACLEOD
                        I have no fight with you.  Unless
                        you make one.

      The katana is at the ready.  Enrique considers a beat --
      he just saw how good MacLeod is.  With a last dark glare,
      he turns and runs off.

      As MacLeod stands looking after him, looking like some
      ancient warrior on a hilltop, sword still in hand, Derek
      steps up to him.

                                            DEREK
                        Forgive me.

      He starts to go to one knee.  MacLeod stops him, meets his
      eyes.

                                            MACLEOD
                        There are no gods here, Derek.  I'm

                        have to learn what that means.  But
                        it doesn't mean we're gods.

      MacLeod and Dawson are having coffee.  MacLeod is showing
      Dawson a postcard from some tropical island.

                                            MACLEOD
                        It's from Carl Robinson.  Derek's
                        doing okay.  And Carl says the kid's
                        got one hell of a slider.

      Dawson grins.  Pulls out a similar postcard from under the
      bar.

                        And Thomas Bell says Carl's got one
                        hell of a baritone.

      MacLeod stares.  Gets it.

                        I guess that's one way of being sure
                        he won't tell anyone what he saw.

                        history were just Immortals with
                          delusions of grandeur, like Larca?

                        But the truth is, it all comes down
                        to something else.

                                            DAWSON

                        Faith, Joe.  Faith.

                                                                              FADE OUT.
