      INT. 28TH FLOOR - DIANE S OFFICE - NIGHT11

      A smiling DIANE looks right at us.  

                                  DIANE
                    Good job, Alicia.

                                  WILL
                    Thanks for going all out this year.  
                    It s been... quite a ride.

      We re in Alicia s POV rewinding to the end of Episode 120.    

                                  DIANE
                    And we re not out of the woods yet.  
                    We have a lot of trimming to do.   

                                  WILL
                    Do more with less.

                                  ALICIA
                    I m ready.

                                  DIANE
                    We know you are.  And thanks for 
                    listening the other day.  

                                  ALICIA
                    No, thank you.

    And ALICIA gets up, turns to go, pauses.  Smile disappearing.  
      What about Cary?  She exits, finds...

      INT. 28TH FLOOR - SECRETARIAL SUBSTATION - NIGHT22

      ...CARY looking up at her.  Checking on her.   

                                  CARY
                    Are you okay?

                                  ALICIA
                    Yes.

                                  CARY
                    Don t worry, everything will be 
                    fine.

                                  WILL
                    Cary, do you have a minute?

      Will leaning out the door for him now.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #121   "Hybristophilia"   BLUE COLLATED   4/12/10    2.

      CONTINUED:22


                                  CARY
                    Yes.

    And Cary shoots one more comforting smile to Alicia, then 
      enters the office.  Alicia stands there, staring in, seeing 
      Cary being fired, her breath strained, as behind her...

      ...KALINDA pauses in the hall, eyeing Alicia.  Not wanting to 
      disturb her moment of guilt.

                                  JULIUS CAIN
                    You re safe.

      JULIUS CAIN leaning out of the conference room...

                                  KALINDA
                    I m safe?

                                  JULIUS CAIN
                    The pink slips are coming in.

      They look toward Alicia s back as she watches Cary.

                                  JULIUS CAIN (CONT D)
                    Gonna be a lot of blood in these 
                    halls in about an hour.

    And we re with Alicia, watching Cary stand, go to the office 
      door, exit.  And he stares right at Alicia-- dead burning 
      eyes-- as he passes.  Alicia watches him go.  Cary passes...

      ...Kalinda and Julius too, the same burning look.  Kalinda 
      starts to speak, lets it go.  She crosses to Alicia.  Just 
    the two of them.

                                  ALICIA
                    They fired him.

                                  KALINDA
                    They kept you.

                                  ALICIA
                    I... I got a client at the last 
                    minute-- through Peter.

      Kalinda studies her, sees her guilt.

                                  KALINDA
                    Smart.

                                  ALICIA
                    No.  


                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #121   "Hybristophilia"   BLUE COLLATED   4/12/10    3.

      CONTINUED: (2)22


                                  KALINDA
                    You got a client.  If Cary had the 
                    opportunity, he would ve too.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Don t.  Please.

                                  KALINDA
                    Do you have your keys?

                                  ALICIA
                    Do I...?

                                  KALINDA
                    Your keys, do you have your car 
                    keys?

                                  ALICIA
                    I... why?

                                  KALINDA
                    I just want to compare them.

                                  ALICIA
                          (stares at her)
                    Are you trying to distract me?

                                  KALINDA
                    Yes.  Let me see your car keys.

      Alicia takes out her car keys.  Kalinda takes them.  And 
      immediately turns to go.

                                  ALICIA
                    Um, Kalinda...?

    But Kalinda continues to...

      INT. 28TH FLOOR - RECEPTION - NIGHT33

      ...reception, getting in an arriving elevator.  Alicia 
      follows, catches up with her:

                                  ALICIA
                    Kalinda?  What reyou doing?  

                                  KALINDA
                          (holds open the door)
                    You won.  He lost.  You re going to 
                    turn this into some morbid thing 
                    because that s who you are.  So...  
                                  (MORE)



                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #121   "Hybristophilia"   BLUE COLLATED   4/12/10    4.

                                  KALINDA (CONT'D)
                          (raises her keys)
                    Let s go.    

      Alicia stares at her.  Takes a second.

                                  ALICIA
                    Let me get my coat.

      INT. HOTEL BAR - NIGHT44

    Two shots of tequila.  A cocktail waitress places them in 
      front of Alicia and Kalinda in a booth.

                                  KALINDA
                      Lockhart/Gardner tradition.  You re an 
                    associate now, twoshots of tequila.

      Alicia laughs as the waitress places two more in front of them.

                                  ALICIA
                    I have to be home by eight.

                                  KALINDA
                    Let me see your phone.

                                  ALICIA
                          (laughs)
                    Kalinda, no really, I have to get home.

                                  KALINDA
                    Alicia, I m taking responsibility 
                    for your irresponsibility.  Let me 
                    see your phone.

      Alicia smiles, takes it out.  Kalinda hits speed dial...

                                  KALINDA (CONT D)
                    Hello, who am I speaking to?

      INT. ALICIA S APARTMENT - NIGHT55

      ZACH on the phone...

                                  ZACH
                    Zach.  Who s this?  One second.  
                          (yells)
                    Dad, mom s gonna be late tonight.

                                  PETER
                    Okay.  Tell her not to worry.

      PETER at the front door, letting ELI in...



                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #121   "Hybristophilia"   BLUE COLLATED   4/12/10    5.

      CONTINUED:55


                                  ELI
                    You don t look like a man who s 
                    gonna be free in a few days. 

                                  PETER
                    There s been a hitch.

      Peter nods toward ELSBETH TASCIONI in the kitchen.   

                                  PETER (CONT'D)
                    I miss Daniel Golden.  

                                  ELI
                    When the Obama White House calls, 
                    you gotta go.  Golden says she s 
                    the better litigator.  Just easy to 
                      underestimate.

                                  PETER
                    Then she must be very good because 
                    I sure am underestimating her.

    Eli smiles.  Peter sees Zach listening in, interested.

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    So finals, huh?  Let me help you in 
                    a minute.  

      Peter and Eli continue on to the kitchen where ELSBETH 
      TASCIONI works on her laptop-- decorated with flower power 
      decals-- pushing random buttons.

                                  ELI
                    Miss Tascioni?  Hi, Eli Gold.

                                  ELSBETH
                    Oh, yes, hello.  You re not good 
                    with computers, are you?  My son 
                    keeps buying me new ones, and then 
                    just backing away and laughing.

      Elsbeth chuckles.  Peter trades a look with Eli: see what I 
      mean?  

                                  ELI
                    So what are we watching here?

                                  ELSBETH
                    Evidence.   

                                  ELI
                    For the retrial?  


                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #121   "Hybristophilia"   BLUE COLLATED   4/12/10    6.

                                  ELSBETH
                    Yep.  

                                  ELI
                    But... the prosecution lost its 
                    only witness, right?  Kozko 
                    committed suicide so they have no 
                    case.

                                  ELSBETH
                    And I thought Monday would be a 
                    simple matter of a dismissal.    
                    But... watch. 

    She hits a key-- nothing happens.  She smiles, hits another 
      key.  Still nothing.  Peter finally reaches past her, clicks 
    the right key, starting a Quicktime video.  Elsbeth laughs...

                                  ELSBETH (CONT D)
                    That was my next button. 

      KOZKO appears on the screen in a State s Attorney interview:

                    Peter was pretty bald about it: 
                    $45,000 would buy me a certain 
                    amount of access.  $85,000, more.

                    And did he say what he needed the 
                    money for?

                                  KOZKO (ON SCREEN)
                    A down payment on a bigger house...

                                  ELSBETH

                    That was my first guess.  But these 
                    aren t the motions of a prosecution 
                    winding down.

      ...Alicia and Kalinda laugh.  Tipsy.  Sweaty bridesmaids, 
      groomsmen drink in the background-- the spillover from a 
      drunken wedding-- as Alicia and Kalinda fight over her phone:    

                                  KALINDA
                    Let go.

                    No, he doesn t-- and even if he 
                    did, it doesn t matter. 

                                  KALINDA
                    It does.  I phone Will.  I tell him 
                    we re at the bar.  I tell him 
                    you re too drunk to go home--
                          (Alicia laughs)
                    --and you re getting a hotel room

                                  BEST MAN
                    You two are so hot.

    The BEST MAN plops down next to them.  Mid-20s.  Muscular 
      surfer boy.  Alicia and Kalinda laugh.

                    Really?  I m getting you both 
                    drinks.

    And the Best Man stumbles off as Alicia just turns to 
      Kalinda, shakes her head, smiling.  Kalinda smiles back.

                                  ALICIA
                    Are you gay?

      Kalinda laughs, stares at Alicia.

                    Because I do.  And how is this

                    I didn t say it was.  I don t like

      Alicia sighs, finds an old 35 mm camera.  She sees the corner 
    of a rug flopped messily back.  Always tidy, she uses her 
      foot to flop it back into place.

    And Alicia turns into the study to find...

                    This isn t what it looks like.   

      Alicia takes a second, needs to be a good lawyer.  She pushes 
      everything else aside, reaches for her cell, but-- the camera 
    in her hand.  Damn. 

                                  SWEENEY (CONT D)
                    Oh, the camera, yes.  Could you...?  

    But Alicia drops it on a couch.  Fingerprints!  She takes out 
    her cellphone, dials.

                                  SWEENEY (CONT D)
                    I already phoned 911.  A minute ago.

                    Are you hurt?  Is that your blood?

                                  SWEENEY
                    I--  In a few places, yes. It was *

                    can t reach it.

                    I need help at Colin Sweeney s.  
                    There s been a murder.  No.  I

      Alicia looks toward the doorknob.  Her fingerprints.  *

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)
                    I didn t know it was a crime scene, 
                    and my fingerprints are on... 
                    things.  *
                          (looks back)
                    Mr. Sweeney!  Don t move!

      Sweeney at the couch now, the back of the camera open, 
      exposing the film.

                                  SWEENEY
                    They were just embarrassing.  The 
                    pictures. 

                                  ALICIA
                    Put the camera down, Mr. Sweeney.

      INT. SWEENEY S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT1313

      ...the kitchen, passes the rug she flopped back over.  
      Considers it, takes her sleeve to avoid fingerprints, starts 
    to fold it back to its original position when she...

      ...stops.  No, that s worse, isn t it?  She leaves it when 
    she glances up, sees a broken window, glass on the floor.  
    The window swung open.  A break in?  She starts to turn away 
      when she notices...

      ...a pool of a dark liquid on the tiles in the kitchen.  
      Blood.  A growing pool of blood.  Oh god.  Is someone there?  
    She whispers toward it:

                                  ALICIA
                    Hello?

                          (calling from the study)
                    What s wrong?

                                  ALICIA
                    Is there somebody else here?

                                  SWEENEY (O.S.)
                    No, why?

      Alicia starts toward the kitchen, careful, seeing blood 
      droplets on the floor at her feet, avoiding them, stepping 
      between them, trying not to contaminate a crime scene.  A 
      minefield.  She looks ahead toward--

      --theblood pool.  Continues toward it. When she hears 
      sirens.  Distant sirens, but getting closer.

                                  SWEENEY (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    Sounds like the calvary.

    But Alicia ignores him, turns the corner toward the blood 
      puddle, finding...

      ...a DEAD DOG there.  Rottweiler.  Tongue hanging out.  Eyes 
      wide.  Blood pooling under it.   

      INT. SWEENEY S TOWNHOUSE - STUDY - 30 MINUTES LATER - NIGHT1414

      Sweeney in tears, the most emotion we ve seen from him.  

                                  SWEENEY
                    He never hurt anyone.  Chili barely 
                    even barked.

      A cop works on the cuff on his ankle as CSI types bag 
      evidence, and paramedics wait to bag the victim. 

                                  DETECTIVE BURTON
                    So you re saying she killed your 
                    dog?  Even though the victim has no 
                    defensive wounds on her body from a 
                    canine attack?

                                  ALICIA
                    Mr. Sweeney is choosing not to

      DETECTIVE BURTON turns to Alicia.  Kalinda watching.

                                  ALICIA

                    the doorknob entering, the camera, 
                    and the rug.

                                  DETECTIVE BURTON
                    And why did you clean up the rug?

                                  ALICIA
                    As I said, I didn t know it was a 
                    crime scene when I entered.

                                  DETECTIVE BURTON
                    Because your client deceived you?

      Kalinda shoots a  come on  look toward Burton.

                                  ALICIA
                    I can t respond to that due to 
                    attorney/client privilege, 
                      detective-- although I would argue 
                    it s wrong to infer that.

                                  DETECTIVE BURTON
                    And you opened the back of this 
                    camera?

                                  ALICIA
                    I m sorry, I can t answer that due 
                    to attorney/client privilege.

                                  DETECTIVE BURTON
                    But your fingerprints are on the

                                  ALICIA
                    Yes, as I said.

                                  DETECTIVE BURTON
                    But you re still insisting you 
                    didn t tamper with evidence?

                                  ALICIA
                    Yes.

      Kalinda nods: good point.

                                  ALICIA
                    We were celebrating when I received 
                    a call from Mr. Sweeney-- excuse 
                    me, from Mr. Gardner, a partner at 
                    my firm-- and he told me to come 
                    here to collect contracts.  I 
                    arrived in a cab; I did not drive 
                    myself.

      Burton studies her.  Takes a second.

                                  DETECTIVE BURTON
                    Mr. Sweeney, you are under arrest 
                    for murder.  

    And as they cuff him, Sweeney sighs:

                    And back into cuffs I go.

                    Mr. Sweeney, I need you to listen 
                    to me.  Remain silent.  Irony does 
                    not work here.  Jokes do not work.  
                    Do you understand?

      Sweeney nods as he  locks his lips  and Burton continues 
      mirandizing:  You have the right to remain silent...   As...

                    your motion to dismiss, and I

                    Yes, your honor, hi.  I hate to 
                    object right off the bat here, but 
                    the key word here is  deceased.   I

                    Your honor, two years ago the 
                    Illinois House of Representatives, *
                    in a 109 to 0 vote, passed the

                    --which makes us the only state in

                    Ah, getting novel on us, Mr. 
                    Childs.  This law is almost as new 
                    as I am.

                                  ELSBETH
                    Yes, your honor, unfortunately for 
                    Mr. Childs, the Peterson law 
                    requires that the accused benefit 
                    not just from a death, but from a 
                    murder he committed.  And Mr. Kozko 
                    committed suicide.

                    The police have not made that

                    has not been found; and we will

      Elsbeth suddenly laughs.  Everyone looks toward her.

                    My apologies, your honor.  I found 
                    this humorous.  Mr. Childs would 
                    like to prove my client is a 
                    murderer so he can prosecute him 
                    for corruption?  That iscertainly 
                    novel.

                    evidence on this alleged murder 
                    tomorrow.   

      Gavel bang.  In the gallery, the reporter leans toward Eli:

                    They just called your client a

    And Elsbeth starts off. 

      INT. HOLDING CELL - LAWYER S INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY1717

      Sweeney whispering, sits across from Alicia and Diane.  

                                  SWEENEY
                    She would ambush me; I d fight and 
                    if I won, we d have sex. 

      Diane and Alicia trying not to judge...

                                  DIANE
                    She was your stalker, but you 
                    encouraged her?

                                  SWEENEY
                    It was a game.  She would break in.  
                    I would disarm her.  And we would 
                    have sex.  It was terrific.  This 
                    time was different.  She tried to 
                    kill me.

                                  DIANE
                    Okay, don t say anything about that-
                    - to anyone.  Do you understand?  
                    Sometimes they bunk you with a 
                    friendly chatty cellmate.  It s a 
                    setup.  Resist the impulse to chat.

                                  SWEENEY
                    Thank you, yes, sound advice.  

                                  ALICIA
                    The police are calling the victim a 
                    Jane Doe.  Do you have any idea who 
                    she was?

                                  SWEENEY
                    No, I just knew her as Sheila 
                    Piper.  

                                  DIANE
                    You said she wrote you?

                                  SWEENEY
                    Yes, classic stalker letters.

                                  DIANE
                    Where are they?

                    Let s petition the court for access 
                    to these letters.  When do we get 
                    forensics, blood work?

                                  ALICIA
                    Preliminary, three days.

                                  KALINDA
                    We should get an expedited necropsy 
                    on the rottweiler.

                                  JULIUS CAIN
                    I think that s a cul de sac.  The 
                      preliminary ME report shows no 
                    defensive wounds on the victim from 
                    a canine attack.  

                                  KALINDA
                    Yes, but Sweeney said he heard no 
                    barking when the Jane Doe broke in.

      Alicia looks toward her, considers it.  The first crack in 
    her incredulity.

                                  KALINDA (CONT D)
                    So maybe the attacker sedated the 
                    dog first.  That would show up in a 
                    necropsy.

                                  ALICIA
                          (nodding, interesting)
                    If we can prove Jane Doe sedated 
                    the dog, it s pre-meditation.  She 
                    went there with the purpose of 
                    doing harm.

                                  DIANE
                    Good.  It s a place to start.  Get 
                    the letters and get the dog.

      Office late.  Just Alicia and Kalinda.  And a table stacked 
      with evidence.  A happier, more content Alicia.  

                                  ALICIA
                    These are the letters sent to

                    Yep.  Sweeney s at least telling 
                    the truth about being stalked.
                          (reading)

                    - both trials.   Now I ll need a

       Sheila Warburg.   The name plate on a mailbox.  Kalinda

                    Sheila?

      Nothing.  Kalinda opens the mail box, overstuffed with 
      catalogues, bills.  She looks down.  Two newspapers, waiting 
    to be picked up.  Kalinda peers through the front window.  
      Hard to see.  Wipes the dust away, sees...

      ...a TV, dining room table.  Nothing out of the ordinary.  A 
      small quaint duplex.  She moves to another window, clears the 
      dust.  Peers into a hall.  Nothing interesting.  Oops, wait, 
      spoke too soon.  Hanging from a closet doorknob is...

      ...a leather S&M mask.  Kalinda smiles, starts to pull on her 
      gloves.      THE GOOD WIFE #121   "Hybristophilia"   BLUE COLLATED   4/12/10    29.

      A window is nudged open.  Kalinda s gloved hand reaches 
      through, then down to the knob, turning it.  No effort at 
      all.  

      Kalinda enters, looks around.  The unspectacular duplex.  She 
      flicks on a light.  Doesn t make it any more spectacular.  
    She crosses into...

      ...the bedroom-- click-- flicks on a light.  Clean, neat.  
      Kalinda crosses to the computer when she pauses, looks down 
    at the laser printer.  The tray.  She pulls out the sheets.

      Print out of Sweeney articles.  Sweeney photos.  His dead

    The next print-out a photo from a cellphone.  Sweeney 
      returning home.  Sweeney at court.  All grainy shots.

      INT. CRIMINAL COURT - DAY2727

      Elsbeth jumps to her feet:  

                                  ELSBETH
                    Not to sound too melodramatic, your 
                    honor, but-- objection.  Really.

      Childs at the prosecution table with MARIANNE KOZKO (48).  
      Newly-widowed.  A mix of pain and anger.

                                  GLENN CHILDS
                    Your honor, Mrs. Kozko heard 
                    directly from her husband that if 
                    he were to die under mysterious 
                      circumstances, it would be at Peter 
                    Florrick s hand.

                                  ELSBETH
                    Yes, and I heard from a butterfly it 
                    wouldn t be.  Both are hearsay 
                      statements, your honor, and equally 
                      inadmissable.

    Eli smiles in the gallery as Elsbeth finds herself getting 
      angry.

                                  GLENN CHILDS
                    The Peterson law allows for exactly 
                    such hearsay testimony.

                                  ELSBETH
                          (to Childs)
                    So let me get this straight. It 
                    allows hearsay as long as a murder 
                    is established; and a murder is 
                      established here because there is a 
                    hearsay statement that establishes 
                    it which is allowed because there 
                    was a murder-- tell me when the 
                    snake actually devours it s tail, 
                    okay?

                                  JUDGE GRAHAM SCHICKEL
                    Ms. Tascioni, you are ridiculing 
                      established Illinois law.  

                                  ELSBETH
                    Yes, your honor, gleefully.  




                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #121   "Hybristophilia"   BLUE COLLATED   4/12/10    31.

      CONTINUED:2727


                                  JUDGE GRAHAM SCHICKEL
                    Well, I know I m the youngest judge 
                    on the bench--

                                  ELSBETH
                    Yes, your honor, we re all in awe.

      Silence in the court.  The Judge stares at her, finishes:

                                  JUDGE GRAHAM SCHICKEL
                    --butI will overrule your 
                    objection.  Given the Peterson Law, 
                    this testimony is allowed.  If you 
                    have a problem with that, take it 
                    up with the Supreme Court.

      And-- bang-- a peeved Schickel exits court as Childs gloats, 
      exits.  Eli goes to Elsbeth. 

                                  ELSBETH
                    This just makes me so angry.

                                  ELI
                    Adorably so.  

                                  ELSBETH
                    I m sure I don t know what that 
                    means.  Now I have to get to work.

    But Elsbeth is off, charging out the door.  Eli starts to 
      follow when he sees the Fed, Lana, in the last gallery row 
      making a note, getting up, exiting too.  Eli considers it.

                    We need to know what is true and 
                    what she s making up.

                                  SWEENEY
                    Well, this is not true-- this one 
                    here-- I m not opposed to it in 
                    principle, but... My goodness.

                    that are fiction.

                                  SWEENEY
                    Certainly.  Look, I had sex with 
                    her twice.  She liked to pretend to 
                    break in and handcuff me.  We would 
                    wrestle, then have sex.  But this 
                    time, she wouldn t stop.  I tried 
                    to get her to drop the knife, but-- 
                    Then we wrestled, and the knife... 
                    it went in.  That s it.

      sitting under a sign  Harper & Greene  is Cary.  In his best 
      suit.  Crisp.  Trying to look newly minted.  He looks next to 
    him at...

      crossed exactly like his: left over right.  Cary looks the

      ...her office.  Neat but very cramped.

                    The FBI doesn t give you much room, 
                    does it?  This is the size of my 
                    old dorm room.

      Lana smiles, turns to find Eli Gold sitting on her couch.  
    She crosses to her desk, checks her e-mails...

                                  LANA

                    Glenn Childs has it out for my 
                    client.  It is a politically 
                    motivated prosecution, and the FBI 
                    should not be in the business of 
                    taking sides.

                                  LANA
                    You are reading too much into my 
                    visit with Mr. Childs.

                    He s giving you evidence against 
                    Florrick.  He s suggesting Florrick 
                    was responsible for Kozko s death.  
                    And you are buying it.

    Eli opens a folder, places Zach s Nano photo of the FBI 
      photographer on her desk.  Lana looks at it, looks away, 
      tries not to be impressed.

                                  LANA
                    I ve seen this.

                    side of a bus.  

    Eli reaches into his bag, pulls out a large poster, unscrolls 
    it.  A blow-up of the same Nano photo.

                    Hardest thing I ve ever done.  He 
                    was so innocent.

                    Yes, but this lady tried to kill 
                    me.  I was protecting myself.  Oh

                    Are you really trying a  blame the

                    Offer him ten years and we don t 
                    have to go to trial.

      Pine considers it.  Collects her papers.

                    My guess is it s more... lucrative 
                    if Sweeney s out of the picture.    

                                  ALICIA
                     Removal for cause ?

                                  JULIUS CAIN
                    Yes.  Again my guess: but if 
                    Sweeney takes a plea he can be 
                    removed as CEO.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Does Mr. Sweeney know this?

                                  JULIUS CAIN
                    He knows we represent his financial 
                    and criminal interests.  Yes.

      Alicia turns to Julius, studies him.  

      INT. 27TH FLOOR - BULLPEN - DAY4040

      Alicia starts toward her office, seeing Kalinda...

                                  ALICIA
                    If it s bad news, can it wait?  We ve 
                    got a 24 hour clock on a plea bargain.

                                  KALINDA

                    On death row.  Sheila corresponded 
                    with him.  

      Alicia stops, stares at her.

                                  ALICIA
                    Before Sweeney?

                    I thought I recognized those 
                    entries in her diary: the ones 
                    Sweeney said were fiction.  They 
                    came from Feighen strial.

                    Yes.  I m checking all her trials 
                    now.  See what other killers she 
                    was corresponding with.  She seemed 
                    to have it out for women killers.  
                    Some kind of avenging angel.

      INT. 28TH FLOOR - SECRETARIAL SUBSTATION - DAY4141

      Alicia starts toward  Julius s office  when she pauses, 
      stops, sees him in with Will.  Sees a file change hands: 
      photos, xeroxes.  Sweeney evidence?  Or something else?

      Julius nods something to Will, then exits.  Surprised to see 
      Alicia.

                    Mrs. Florrick, as much I like to

                    I will, sir.  I think we should

                    Kalinda found new evidence.

      Sweeney sitting across from Alicia and Julius.

                                  JULIUS CAIN
                    It s the best bargain we could 
                    make.  Eight years.  And this is 
                    after they started at what I would 
                    consider an adamant 45.  

      Sweeney looks toward a stiff Alicia.  What am I missing here?

                                  SWEENEY
                    Mrs. Florrick?

      Julius turns to Alicia.

                                  ALICIA
                    It s true they started at 45 years.

                    It s coming down to perceptions, 
                    Mr. Sweeney.  We would petition for 
                    a change of venue, but...

                                  SWEENEY
                    I m famous everywhere?

      Alicia hesitates.  Her only hesitatiopn.

                                  ALICIA
                    I don t know.  Sheila Warburg stalked 
                    other women killers, but I don t know if 
                    that s enough to overcome... your

                    Yes.  That s what I was afraid of.

      Sweeney pauses.  Almost seems on the verge of tears.  Stops 
      himself.  Smiles.  Returning to his old self.

                    Yes, just one last objection, your

                                  GLENN CHILDS
                    Objection.

                                  ELSBETH
                    --It requires that Mr. Florrick not 
                    only profit from a murder, but be

                    And you can get to the point.

                                  ELSBETH
                    Well, for Mr. Kozko to be murdered one 
                    key thing is required that we overlooked.

                                  JUDGE GRAHAM SCHICKEL
                    And what is that, Miss Tascioni?

                                  ELSBETH
                    That he be dead.

    And Elsbeth hits two keys on her computer.  A picture 
      appearing there.  Thrilled it worked:

    And there is an immediate stir in court as the image pops up 
    on a Powerpoint screen.  An ATM photo of a man.

    Eli grins as...

                    Your honor, Mrs. Kozko s hearsay 
                    testimony is inadmissable, and Mr.

                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #121   "Hybristophilia"   BLUE COLLATED   4/12/10    55.

                                  LANA
                    Kalinda.

      Kalinda turns, finds Lana getting out of a sedan, starting 
      toward her.

                                  LANA (CONT D)
                    So your boy is free.

                                  KALINDA
                    My boy?

                                  LANA
                    Florrick.  He just won.

                                  KALINDA
                    Really?  Wow.

                                  LANA
                    So I hear there are some tapes.

      Kalinda smiles.

                                  KALINDA
                    There are always some tapes.

                                  LANA
                    I heard they hurt Florrick and
                    Childs so neither wanted to use 
                    them: Mutually Assured Destruction.

                                  KALINDA
                    Sounds like a fairy tale.

                                  LANA
                    Funny how fairy tales turn out to be 
                    true.  Here s the thing, Kalinda.  
                    This isn t about Childs orFlorrick.  
                    It s about Childs andFlorrick.  
                    We re investigating both of them, 
                    and I just don t want you to get 
                    hurt.

                                  KALINDA
                    Thank you for your concern.

      Lana studies Kalinda.  Is that genuine or not?

                                  LANA
                    I m your friend here.

                                  KALINDA
                    Good to know. 

    And Kalinda starts off.  As...

      INT. ALICIA S APARTMENT - NIGHT4646

      ...YEAH!!!  The foyer is jammed with people, a cacophony of 
      conversation, people with champagne in hand.  Peter is in the 
      doorway-- free-- raising his ANKLET transmitter over his head 
    to the cheer of party-goers.  A spontaneous crowd.  Court 
      types, politicians, aides, supports, all rushing up to Peter, 
      hugging him, laughing.  

    The overflow spills onto the landing.  Clearly the party of 
    the week.  Champagne everywhere.  We find...

      ...a few Sheriffs wrapping up the HMS console.  Taking it 
      away.  Guests slapping them on the back.  No one s unfriendly 
      here.  In the kitchen...

      ...Alicia stands, leaning in a corner, a lawyer shaking her 
      hand, smiling.  Grace comes up to her, leans against her... 

                                  GRACE
                    It s over, isn t it?

                                  ALICIA
                    Looks like it.  

                                  GRACE
                    Zach s drinking champagne.

                                  ALICIA
                    Zach.

                                  ZACH
                    It s soda.  

      Okay, Alicia nods.  Zach goes to lean beside them.  The three 
    in a row.

                                  ZACH (CONT D)
                    Do you know all these people?

                                  ALICIA
                    Some.  

                                  GRACE
                    What rewe gonna do?




                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #121   "Hybristophilia"   BLUE COLLATED   4/12/10    57.

      CONTINUED:4646


                                  ALICIA
                    Well, clean up.

                                  GRACE
                    No, after that.

                                  ALICIA
                    I don t know.  What do you want to do?

                                  GRACE
                    Buy a big house.

      Alicia laughs...

                                  ZACH
                    Go to Europe.

    And Alicia pauses, sees three suited men greeting Peter in 
    the dining room.  Hugging him.  Familiar Chicago look.  
      Powerful men.  Kissing the metaphoric ring.  And...

      ...Alicia has a sinking feeling.  Things going right back to 
      where they were.  

                                  JACKIE
                    He couldn t have done it without 
                    you.

      JACKIE coming up beside Alicia, eyeing her.

                                  ALICIA
                    I don t think that s true.

                                  JACKIE
                    It is.  We women stay in the 
                    shadows.  We smile, we comfort, we 
                    nurse, but we re always there. 

      Alicia studies her.  It sounds like a curse.

                                  JACKIE (CONT D)
                    You are a good woman, Alicia.   

      Alicia doesn t smile, staring at her until...

                                  PETER
                    Alicia.  

      It s Peter calling to her.  Waving to her: come on.  

                                  JACKIE
                    He needs you.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #121   "Hybristophilia"   BLUE COLLATED   4/12/10    58.

      CONTINUED: (2)4646


      Alicia turns from Jackie and starts through the party toward 
      Peter.  A lot of people patting her on the back, smiling at 
      her.  Alicia doesn t smile back as she gets closer and closer 
      to... 

      ...a grinning Peter.  Still with the powerful man.  

                                  PETER
                    I m not the lawyer here.  You want 
                    my wife.  

    Oh.  Not what Alicia expected.  This is new.  The Powerful 
    Man smiles. 

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    Alicia, this is Michael from the AFL-
                    CIO.  He wants to talk about a good 
                    Chicago law firm.  Alicia is a 
                    lawyer at Lockhart/ Gardner.  One of 
                    their best lawyers.  You should 
                    talk.

      Alicia looks toward Peter, sees the pride on his face.  And 
    she shakes the union man s hand:

                                  ALICIA
                    Hi.
