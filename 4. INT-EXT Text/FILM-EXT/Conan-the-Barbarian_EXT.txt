A blonde-haired, armored AESIR RAIDER withdraws the bloody
sword from the stomach of ISLENE, a wild-maned Cimmerian
beauty, many months pregnant, now clutching her bloody
stomach.
Across a muddy battlefield, the air a maelstrom of falling
snowflakes and embers from trees aflame, the powerfully built
CORIN rallies his fellow CIMMERIANS, until he spots Islene.
CORIN
Islene!!!
Wielding a broadsword, runes etched into its surface, Corin
cuts a bloody path through his enemies, his eyes never
leaving Islene.
The Aesir standing over Islene LAUGHS as she claws at the
earth behind her, trying to pull herself away.
AESIR
Now, now little whore. Did I get
you or your little one?
2.
Islene's hand reaches back once again -- and it finds a
fallen warrior's SWORD. In one fluid motion she swings the
sword around her body and drives it into the gap in the
Aesir's armor -- at his groin.
ISLENE
I'd ask you the same.
The Aesir HOWLS in agony, raising his sword to deliver the
killing blow -- when another sword pierces his chest. The
Aesir falls, revealing Corin standing behind him.
Corin throws aside his horned helmet, and falls to his knees
beside Islene, checking her wound. When he pulls his hands
back they are coated in blood.
Their eyes meet. Torment. Loss. They both know. She pulls a
knife from the folds of her pelts, puts it in his hand.
ISLENE (CONT'D)
Take your child.
CORIN
I cannot.
Islene looks to her naked belly. The baby inside presses
against its womb, a visible impression on her flesh.
ISLENE
There is no time, husband. I would
see my child's face.
Islene's eyes flutter as she struggles. Corin lowers the
knife. Islene's eyes lock with Corin's as he puts the knife
to use. Never once does she scream.
A moment later, Corin lifts the crying, blood-covered BOY up
through the falling snowflakes to Islene's lap.
ISLENE (CONT'D)
A boy. He will be strong. A warrior
with no equal.
CORIN
Do not speak, love.
ISLENE
You have never been able to still
my tongue, and you will not this
day. He will be wild, Corin. You
must temper him.
She shares one kiss with her child, its first taste not of
mother's milk, but of her blood.
3.
ISLENE (CONT'D)
(FADING)
Conan. His--name--is--Conan.
CONAN
The boy's eyes are as deep and blue as the Eastern Sea.
TITLE CARD: CONAN
CUT TO:
A small Cimmerian village lies in a heavily forested valley,
a redoubt from the icy mountains surrounding it.
Round wooden huts surround a stone-lined pit, where young
CIMMERIAN BOYS, ages 12-15 stand. Pollen drifts through the
air, giving it an ethereal haze.
At the center of the pit URAN, an elder Cimmerian warrior
speaks.
URAN
A Cimmerian warrior is like any
other man. A Cimmerian warrior
feels hunger. He feels cold. Like
other men he may lie and cheat.
(stares the boys down)
But when a Cimmerian warrior
hungers, he hungers only for the
blood of his enemy. When he feels
cold, it is the cold steel of his
sword. When he lies, he lies in
wait for his enemy. And when he
cheats, he cheats death itself!
Uran stops at the end of the line, where a boy stands a good
two heads smaller than the rest. He is no more than eight,
but his face is as stoic, driven.
URAN (CONT'D)
Conan! You are too young to be
here. Withdraw.
CONAN, determined, doesn't move an inch. The LARGEST TEEN
menacingly steps up to the smaller boy.
LARGEST TEEN
He said leave, motherless whelp.
4.
The hulking teen goes to shove Conan, but Conan pulls his arm
towards him, lashing out with his other hand, punching the
teen in the throat.
The large boy goes down hard, hands and knees, gasping for
air.
A smattering of LAUGHS erupt from the boys, quickly silenced
by Uran's stare. Uran hands out RIVER STONES to each boy,
ending with Conan. The boys know what to do: they put the
large stones in their mouths.
URAN
In the black crag in the high pass
stands a wooden training sword. The
one who claims it, with stone still
in his mouth, will have earned the
right to train with the warriors.
The boys look at each other, sizing up the competition.
URAN (CONT'D)
Well? What are you waiting for?!
And off they run. They knock each other down, punching the
other's stomachs, each trying to force the other to expel
their stones. One or two succeed.
Most of the remaining boys run for the trail that winds high
into the mountains. But a few head right for the sheer cliff
face.
Conan follows the ones headed to the cliff.
CLIFF FACE
And when the Cimmerian boys climb, it is a sight to behold.
They find cracks we can barely see and scale the smooth rock
face as though it were a ladder.
The hulking teen reaches for the same handhold as Conan,
trying to knock him off. Conan swings with one hand and finds
another path. In moments he is ahead.
Conan is in the lead as he crests the cliff top, the bigger
boys right behind him.
They race through the forest, heading uphill --
When Conan spots movement ahead. He pauses --
5.
And the largest teen elbows past Conan, into the lead. The
boy runs two paces more and suddenly flies off his feet, an
AXE lodged squarely in his forehead.
All the boys stop. Out of the dense forest come
FOUR PICTISH SAVAGES
Covered with fearsome war paint and armed with dual hand
axes, the rotting heads of their enemies are slung at their
waist.
The boys spit out the rocks in their mouths and YELL. They
turn and run in the opposite direction.
Only Conan doesn't move, even as another boy pulls at him.
CIMMERIAN BOY
Conan! Run!
But Conan simply pulls the axe from his large boy's skull. He
turns to face the Picts, his eyes burning.
The Picts LAUGH and CHARGE CONAN.
CUT TO:
LATER
Corin arrives with Uran and other armed CIMMERIAN WARRIORS.
They get a brief glimpse of a single PICT, escaping in the
other direction. One of the Cimmerians takes off in pursuit.
Corin desperately searches for his son.
CORIN
Conan? Conan?!
Conan steps forward from out of a thicket, his body covered
in Pict blood. Three PICTS lie massacred, the bodies hacked
to pieces.
CORIN (CONT'D)
What have you done, boy?
Conan walks past the other stunned Cimmerians, up to his
father. Conan SPITS OUT the bloody stone from his mouth.
CONAN
They killed one. I killed three. I
am a warrior now.
Uran and the other Cimmerian men exchange worried glances.
Looking at the carved up bodies of the Picts, they are
aghast. Conan looks confused. Why aren't they happy?
6.
CORIN
A warrior? What you have done a
jackal would do. Never a warrior.
CONAN
They would have done the same --
CORIN
As I said, jackals.
(TO URAN)
He is not ready. I will forge him
myself.
CUT TO:
TRAINING MONTAGE:
Conan is tested under Corin's watchful eye:
- Forced to sleep in the snow, while his father keeps warm
inside.
- A heavy boulder on his shoulder blades while he balances on
wet river rocks.
- Climbing a cliff face, his bare hands leaving blood behind
on the jagged rocks.
With a setting sun silhouetting the two, Conan attacks Corin.
Conan attacks with fury. Corin defends with grace. Until the
boy overextends and Corin slashes down a counterattack that
SHATTERS CONAN'S SWORD.
Corin simply turns and walks away, leaving Conan to puzzle
what happened.
Corin lowers his sword and walks away, leaving Conan to
puzzle what happened.
Frustrated, Conan slashes through a field of reeds, cutting
everything within reach of him, expending his rage.
Behind him something moves in the forest. We catch just a
glimpse of the PICT, the same one that escaped Conan in the
earlier scene.
Conan's instincts cause him to spin around -- but then
there's nothing there.
Remo exits and stares down at CHEREN, a BLIND ARCHER clad in
lamellar armor and a conical sedge hat. Cheren has an arrow
notched and ready, but somehow he knows not to fire.
Cheren lowers his bow and lets out a BIRD WHISTLE --
10.
And the forest comes alive. The forces are an odd
combination; massive KUSHITE TRIBESMEN, dark-skinned savages
from the savannahs of Kush, and a LEGION OF AQUILONIAN
MERCENARIES, heavily armored knights drawn from the cities of
Aquilonia.
Their leaders, respectively, are the six foot-five Kushite
chief UKAFA, gold-toothed, his body painted for battle, and
the handsome, silver-armored Aquilonian LUCIUS.
UKAFA
That's the last of their guard
towers.
LUCIUS
All this sneaking around for a
lowly tribe of barbarians.
KHALAR SINGH (O.S.)
This lowly tribe of barbarians have
buried every warrior ever to set
foot on this land, Lucius.
KHALAR SINGH, a warlord atop a black horse, rides through the
fog-shrouded trees.
He bears a nomadic visage, with tanned skin and almond-shaped
eyes. While his voice is calm, his eyes burn with malice.
LUCIUS
That is only because they have
never faced my legion.
Khalar regards Lucius with amusement.
KHALAR SINGH
Then show us. But should you fail,
remember the plan.
Lucius scowls as he delivers a bow to Khalar Singh.
Corin walks out of the forge, looking around for Conan.
Various other Cimmerians go about the daily routine, but
Conan is nowhere to be seen.
CORIN
Conan?
11.
Corin looks to the ridge above the village, noticing a thick
fog creeping in. The fog curls and eddies, something is out
there.
Suddenly, Lucius and his legion of silver-armored warriors
burst out of the fog, attacking with speed and strength.
But the Cimmerians are hardly caught flat footed. In seconds
they are armed, and they counter the charge with a furious
charge of their own.
SLAM! Sword and bone collide as the two enemy fronts smash
into each other. And the battle devolves into one-on-ones --
Where the barbarians have the upper hand. Uran and Corin lead
the main push of battle-frenzied barbarians as they swing
their huge broadswords, extending their reach advantage over
the Aquilonian's shorter weapons.
And quickly, the Aquilonian's numbers are cut in half. Corin
squares off against Lucius himself. Lucius is sweating.
Worried. It wasn't supposed to be this hard.
LUCIUS
Retreat!
As a unit, the Aquilonians race back into the woods. In
seconds, the Cimmerians give chase in wild pursuit.
CORIN
Wait! Hold your ground!
But it's too late, nearly half the Cimmerian warriors are
gone on the chase.
Lucius and the Aquilonians race up to a sheer cliff face.
Nowhere left to run. They turn to see the Cimmerians
gathering in front of them.
URAN
Death is in the air, invaders. Can
you taste it?
LUCIUS
(SMILES)
Indeed. I savor it.
Uran notices something is wrong. His eyes go skyward. Atop
the cliff stand Cheren and a dozen more of his blind archers,
bows at the ready with FLAMING ARROWS.
12.
They let the arrows fly, streaking balls of flame heading
right for the Cimmerians. But they do not hit them. They hit
the tree trunks beside them.
And for a moment, the Cimmerians look relieved, until they
notice small bags of a black substance tied to the arrows.
The flames lick at the substance --
KABOOM! The forest erupts into flames as the Cimmerian
warriors are burned alive.
Conan spins, started by the sound of the explosion. He sees
flames rising above the treetops beyond.
He races back home.
Corin sees the flames in the distance as well. Suddenly,
Ukafa and his Kushite warriors erupt out of the forest. Armed
with fearsome barbed spears they charge the remaining
Cimmerians, savage against savage.
But the Kushites are not alone. From behind the Cimmerians
comes, AKHUN, a massive four hundred pounds of flesh, wearing
loops of chains like armor, leads his turbaned TURANIAN
HORSEMEN into the village.
The Cimmerian WOMEN arm themselves, but the Horsemen attack
with NINE TAILED WHIPS pulling their swords from their hands
and dragging them to the ground.
The Horsemen quickly gather up the women while Ukafa and his
men keep the Cimmerian warriors all too occupied.
CONAN
Conan rushes through a river, now tinged red with blood, and
reaches the far end of the village.
Huts burn, women are chained, only a handful of Cimmerians
still stand. Lucius and his Aquilonian mercenaries are
helping the Spearmen slay the wounded.
Conan grabs a fallen sword and rushes for the nearest
Aquilonian and RUNS HIM THROUGH. A ZINGARAN spots him and
rushes him with his spear. Conan readies himself for the
CHARGE --
13.
When the Zingaran loses his head, lopped off by Corin's
blade.
CONAN
Father!
CORIN
Come.
Corin, sporting a deep gash to his abdomen, pulls a reluctant
Conan from the battle, back toward the forge.
The forge is lit afire from a half dozen torches, thrown onto
its roof and inside its windows. Khalar and the other watch
as the building roars into flame.
Conan exits the forge only to see the entire village burning.
The bodies of everyone he has ever known litter the
landscape. Nothing stirs. Until he hears a strange CHOPPING
SOUND.
THE PICT
Conan spots the Pict, who is decapitating a dead Cimmerian
warrior, adding to the collection of heads at his tattooed
waist.
The Pict doesn't notice as Conan slips up behind him, then
RUNS HIM THROUGH.
As the wide-eyed Pict dies, Conan takes the sword and CUTS A
NOTCH into his arm.
DISSOLVE TO:
NOTCHED ARM
Where there was once a single notch, there are now FIVE such
notches, on a much broader arm that struggles to pin another
powerful looking arm.
Conan, unconscious, is dragged down the street by the two
City Guards.
CITY GUARD #1
(STRUGGLING)
By the gods, he's as heavy as a
horse.
CITY GUARD #2
Even a dead horse smells better
than this.
The City Guards drag Conan into a broad prison yard. Many of
the INMATES are shackled together, hacking with picks at the
rock walls on their work detail. Those in no condition to
break rock are left in their own filth to rot. Some are even
dead already, the rats gnawing at the remains.
KHALAR SINGH looks older. Worn. He squints as he stares into
a howling sandstorm.
UKAFA trudges through the deep sand to reach him. The
sandstorm is so blinding we don't see him until he is less
than five feet away.
UKAFA
Khalar Singh, we've lost half our
cavalry legion, and still Fariq
presses on! We must turn back!
KHALAR SINGH
He says the Queen is here.
UKAFA
He leads us in circles. He knows
nothing of leading an army --
KHALAR SINGH
Take care, Ukafa. You hold a
special place in my kingdom, but
blood you are not.
UKAFA
My apologies, Khalar Singh. I am
simply concerned for your army.
27.
KHALAR SINGH
And I would gladly sacrifice every
last man to get my hands on the
Queen. And in that respect, Fariq
has my confidence. He knows more of
the legends of Acheron than anyone.
Suddenly, two forms race at them from the blinding sand. REMO
and FARIQ. No longer a child, Fariq is now a man in his
twenties, but he is hardly the strong warrior his father is.
His frame is slight, his eyes beady.
FARIQ
Father, they are here! The hidden
oasis, just as it was written.
Khalar Singh looks to Remo for confirmation. The misshapen
and shadowy Remo nods.
Remo and Fariq lead Khalar and Ukafa into a natural tunnel
carved out of rock. Inside, the sandstorm no longer rages.
And on the other side of the tunnel --
A protected rock oasis, heavy vegetation crawling up the
encircling cliff walls, herds of sheep grazing on fields of
grass. At its far end, beyond a deep blue pond, lies a Greek-
influenced monastery and several tiled-roof, mud-brick
houses.
And moving between the pools are MEN and WOMEN going about
their simple chores. They wear long flowing white linen robes
and turbans.
The air and sand are perfectly still within the perimeter of
the oasis. But beyond it, the sandstorm rages all around,
sand hurled violently hundreds of feet into the air, swirling
around the oasis as though it were the eye of some mystical
hurricane, protected by an unseen force.
A row of robed YOUNG WOMEN kneel in front of one of the
reflecting pools, quietly reading from prayer books and
softly striking their right breast with a left hands wrapped
in thorns.
One girl, ILIRA, mischievously taps the shoulder of the girl
next to her with her thorn. The girl, TAMARA, squeals in
pain, angry her prayer was interrupted.
28.
Ilira is the fun-loving dilettante of the relationship.
Tamara the studious good girl.
TAMARA
Stop it! I'm trying to pray!
ILIRA
I'm bored.
TAMARA
Then hit yourself.
Tamara hits Ilira back with her thorn. Ilira SQUEALS, then
hits a grinning Tamara back. Tamara grabs her, but as they
TUSSLE--
FASSIR (O.S.)
Is that how one shows penitence?
Both girls instantly stop as FASSIR appears behind them.
Fassir is an elder monk and leader of the monastery. He
shakes his head, both out of fondness and disappointment.
FASSIR (CONT'D)
I expect more from a queen.
ILIRA
I'm sorry, Fassir. I just tire of
saying the same prayer every day.
FASSIR
Then you should be able to
translate it from its original
Acheronian.
Ilira's face scrunches, unsure. Tamara steps in to help Ilira
save face.
TAMARA
Of course she can. She even taught
it to me. "Never again."
FASSIR
Go on.
TAMARA
Never again will we stand by as
darkness consumes the world. Never
again will innocents suffer for
others' power. Never again will the
Queen suffer so Acheron may rise.
29.
FASSIR
Very good, Tamara. You must have
taught her very well indeed, Ilira.
A smile on Fassir's face confirms he knows the truth.
Suddenly, the monastery's BELL RINGS OUT. A moment later, a
temple EXPLODES in flames.
Pouring out from the swirling sands come Khalar Singh's army.
Cheren and his archers stand atop Khalar's
MAN OF WAR
A massive siege engine atop which CHEREN and his archers fire
FLAMING ARROWS. The arrows arc down and explode as they
impact the tiled roofs.
Sitting at the highest point of the Man Of War, Khalar Singh
likes what he sees.
CHAOS
The monks scatter in every direction, but wherever they turn,
more troops burst out of the swirling sand.
A small handful of armed MONKS display acrobatic martial arts
prowess as they battle with Khalar's heavily armed forces,
but they are vastly outnumbered.
Fassir grabs Tamara.
FASSIR (CONT'D)
The Queen must not be captured.
Take her out the North Gate.
Quickly!
Tamara grabs Ilira and pulls her through the flaming
battleground. Zingaran warriors cut down the monks while
Turanian horsemen concentrate on the women.
ILIRA
We can't leave them.
TAMARA
If you are caught, everything we
live for is lost!
WHIP! A whip encircles Ilira's waist. A massive TURANIAN
pulls her to him. Tamara grabs the whip, pulling Ilira the
other way. But she is no match for the huge slaver. He yanks
on the whip pulling both of them to him --
30.
Only then does he notice Tamara's unsheathed knife which she
plunges into his throat.
She frees Ilira and they run.
Remo materializes out of a shadow atop the Man Of War, next
to Cheren, the archer.
REMO
The north gate. Destroy it.
Cheren and the other archers turn their fire to the gate at
the end of the passage. They fire a volley of fiery arrows.
31.
Tamara falls to the sand as the gate collapses behind her.
She looks back, only to see that Ilira didn't make it.
TAMARA
NO!!!
Khalar Singh stares at the cloud of destruction at the north
tunnel.
There, one form hurries into the swirling sandstorm.
KHALAR SINGH
Who was guarding that gate?
REMO
It was I, Lord.
32.
KHALAR SINGH
Take four legions. Hunt her. Before
I hunt you.
CUT TO:
Tamara stumbles through a stretch of barren wasteland, the
plumes of the oasis' sandstorm now off in the distance behind
her.
The sun mercilessly beats down upon her face, her lips are
already chapped. She falls to her knees, unable to go on.
She looks up, as the heat streams off the desert floor,
creating a swirling mirage. Through which the silhouette of a
rider appears, followed by others.
SLAVER CARAVAN
The horse-drawn carts of the caravan are lined with iron
bars, and behind the bars are a bevy of young women, mostly
looking worse for wear.
The HEAD SLAVER rides ahead, and walks up to the heap of
white cloth that is Tamara.
TAMARA
Water -- please --
He lifts her barely conscious head, eyeing her features, a
greasy paw examining her body. He smiles.
HEAD SLAVER
The gods are good.
(to the other slavers)
Chain this one in my cage. She'll
be the prize of the auction in Khor
Kalba.
CUT TO:
The Man of War dominates the center of the oasis, its torches
illuminating the scene before it. Akhun and the Turanians
hold chains connected to the twenty women monks, kneeling,
with their wrists chained to their neck collars.
In front of them kneels Fassir, beaten and bloodied.
33.
Khalar Singh, Fariq, and Ukafa step down from the Man of War.
Fariq carries with him a large iron box with ornate carvings
on it.
KHALAR SINGH
All these years searching the ends
of the earth. And here you are.
Just a two day ride from Khor
Kalba. I can scarcely believe it.
FASSIR
(in Acheronian, to monks)
Say nothing.
KHALAR SINGH
(IN ACHERONIAN)
Yes. Say nothing. Maybe he doesn't
know who we are. Maybe he's not
looking for the Queen.
Several of the women look up at him, shocked.
KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
That's right, my brethren, you have
been lied to all your lives. Told
you must hide yourselves, told you
were alone. I want you to look at
me, and see me for what I am. A
brother. A friend. I have come not
to hurt you, but liberate you.
FASSIR
You come for your own dark
purposes, to raise Acheron.
KHALAR SINGH
Yes. I come to resurrect the
greatest empire Hyboria has ever
known.
FASSIR
An empire of evil, soaked in blood
sacrifice and the blackest of
magic.
Khalar Singh becomes infuriated, eyes blazing.
KHALAR SINGH
Have you hidden from the world so
long that you cannot to see? Blood,
magic, death: it is everywhere.
Acheron is no different than any
other kingdom, but for its glory.
(MORE)
34.
KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
And in place of that glory, you
offer shame? I knew shame, but that
was before I was shown my true
lineage.
Khalar draws closer to the women, looking them each in the
eye.
KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
When I was but a child, raiders
destroyed my village, cut our
fathers to ribbons, and burned our
women as sacrifice to foreign gods.
Those few who survived, we ran for
our lives, chased into caves at the
edge of the Eastern Sea, left with
nothing to live for. But then we
discovered it. Acheron. The temple
that spawned an empire. We learned
that we were not broken goat-
herders on a desolate coastline. We
were the sons and daughters of
kings.
(stares in Ilira's eyes)
And queens.
He motions to Fariq, who brings the iron box forward.
KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
For thirty years I have searched
for you. In that time I built both
an army and empire, but they are
nothing compared to what we can
create together. We can raise
Acheron again. Never again will we
hide like rats. Never again will we
watch as our loved ones are
slaughtered. I call forth the
Queen. Stand and join me, and this
day will have a joyous end.
No one moves.
FASSIR
You would have all the world
suffer, as you have suffered. We
will die before we help you.
KHALAR SINGH
Yes. You will.
He nods to his son. He paces in front of the female monks,
the box in front of them.
35.
FARIQ
The caves beneath Khor Khalba
contain all manner of creature,
many -- altered -- by centuries of
blood magic. But one, in
particular, has developed a special
connection to the blood. A thirst.
It is said that only the Queen of
Acheron itself can resist its
embrace.
He stops, one woman away from Ilira.
FARIQ (CONT'D)
So what say you? Will you be the
lucky one, or will you tell me who
is?
A tear falls down her face, but she stays silent. There's the
sound of SLITHERING as Fariq opens the box. She stares down
inside the box --
AND SCREAMS.
CUT TO:
TAMARA
She awakens to the SCREAMING of a whipped SLAVE GIRL.
Tamara's eyes are met by a dozen others, SLAVES of every
color, chained together with her in a CAGED WAGON. The SLAVE
TRADER swings his whip twice more, hitting the cowering women
in the cage.
SLAVE TRADER
Wake up, slags! Smile! A new owner
approaches!
Tamara makes eye contact with the Slave Trader.
TAMARA
Let me go. I promise you'll be
rewarded.
The Trader just laughs, leering at her.
SLAVE TRADER
And I would sample that reward,
fair one, but you wear white.
(MORE)
36.
SLAVE TRADER (CONT'D)
Tell me, have the stars aligned and
delivered a virgin slave into my
care?
He eyes her lasciviously. Tamara turns away and does not
answer.
SLAVE TRADER (CONT'D)
No matter. I'll know soon enough.
(TURNS AWAY)
Good day, sir! A lone rider in a
desolate land. The perfect customer
for what I sell.
CONAN
Rides out of the sun, his massive form silhouetted by the
bright desert sky. He stares at the slave wagons.
SHEMISH WOMAN
Please, master! Your gold can free
me from this hole! I can bring you
PLEASURE--
The Slave Trader immediately WHIPS her, incensed.
SLAVE TRADER
Silence whore!
The Slaver goes to whip her again, but before the blow can
fall, Conan grabs his arm. The Slave Trader looks furious,
but Conan's size holds him back.
CONAN
Khor Kalba. Which way?
SLAVE TRADER
This is the road to Khor Kalba.
Ahead. Past the Great Wall.
The Slaver nods to the east and Conan releases his arm.
The Slaver continues whipping the slave. Conan just rides on -
- not his problem.
But as Conan passes Tamara, for a brief moment their eyes
meet. Something about her. Conan stares a moment, then spurs
his horse on.
Just then, the ground around them RUMBLES. Horses rear, the
women SCREAM. Conan turns and looks up. His eyes go wide.
ENORMOUS BOULDERS
37.
Coming thundering down the hills on all sides. The SLAVERS
see them a moment to late.
SLAM. Several of the horses and carts are smashed by the
rolling boulders.
Conan kicks his horse, trying to outrace the boulders. But
when the wagon next to him is hit, its axle spears his horse
in its side, and Conan goes down.
Pissed, he draws his sword. The Slavers scramble around the
broken wagons, in chaos.
Only a pair of wagons still stands. One of them holds Tamara.
CONAN
Use your whips on the horses' legs!
The Slavers are confused. Then they notice
TURANIAN HORSEMEN
racing down the hill, behind the boulders.
As the riders bear down upon the slavers, the Slavers do as
they're told, entangling the legs of the first wave of
horses, throwing their riders.
More than a few riders SNAP their necks as they're driven
into the desert floor. The remainder fight hand to hand, and
are cut down by either Conan's blade or the slavers' tulwars.
But their victory is short lived --
As a SECOND WAVE OF RIDERS comes thundering towards them,
before the Slavers can re-establish their perimeter. The
riders start cutting the slavers down where they stand.
CONAN
Conan lodges his sword in a still-rolling boulder. As it
rolls, it pulls him up on top of it. From this height, Conan
launches himself down at the horsemen below.
WHAM! He knocks a rider off his horse, Conan landing square
in the saddle. He kicks the horse straight at the other
riders. They don't see him coming until it's too late. He
cuts them down where they sit.
The last remaining CARAVAN DRIVER whips his horse team,
trying to pull his wagon out of the fight. Conan spins to see
a FLASH of steel and the rider's neck plumes in blood as he's
decapitated.
38.
Which is strange since the cavalry are nowhere near the
wagon.
REMO
The explanation comes as the shadow behind the driver MORPHS
into Remo, the spindly Shadow Scout. He takes the reins,
stopping the wagon.
Conan spots him, recognition in his eyes.
CONAN (CONT'D)
You!
There's a SCREAM. Conan turns to see the other two SHADOW
SCOUTS already hacking their way through the slaves on one of
the caged wagons. A Shadow Scout gets to Tamara, only to have
her FIGHT BACK.
Tamara kicks the first Scout in the face, slamming his head
into the bars. However, the second one clubs her unconscious
from behind.
CONAN
Leaps from his horse, launching his body at Remo. Remo dives
and rolls away. Small and misshapen, he is nonetheless very
fast.
Conan strikes again. Again Remo dodges out of the way.
The Shadow Scouts draw swords, but Remo waves them off,
speaking in the broken language of a savage.
REMO
The girl! Bring her to Khalar!
Conan launches an all out attack. Remo leaps over his sword
and vaults Conan, landing on his back. He draws his sword,
preparing to cut Conan's throat --
When Conan hurls his body backwards, into one of the huge
rolling boulders. The impact crushes Remo and he loses his
grip.
Conan spins to strike again, only to see Remo MELT INTO THE
SHADOW OF THE BOULDER.
Conan turns his attention towards the other two Shadow Scouts
as they drag the unconscious Tamara away.
39.
Conan mounts one of the cavalry horses and gallops towards
the Scouts. They see him coming and let go of Tamara. THEY
MELT AWAY INTO HER SHADOW AND DISAPPEAR.
CUT TO:
TAMARA
Dazed, she struggles to her feet. Conan appears beside her,
his dagger out. Tamara gasps in fear but Conan only reaches
out and breaks the lock on her chains.
CONAN
Who are you?
TAMARA
I am nobody.
He cuts the bonds on her feet. Tamara rises up, the battle
scene revealed to her.
Dead bodies of the Slavers and Turanian horsemen lie sprawled
in every direction. Tamara takes in the gruesome sight,
shocked.
CONAN
Many died to capture nobody.
(motions to his horse)
Get up.
TAMARA
And if I don't wish to ride with
you?
Conan rides his horse, Tamara trailing on foot, wrists
tethered to Conan's saddle by a long rope. Tamara looks
exhausted.
They reach a gallery of broken columns, spires of fossilized
coral that juts out of the desert.
TAMARA
Stop! I want water.
Conan just keeps riding.
CONAN
Perhaps the slavers took your
orders. I don't.
40.
TAMARA
I never knew men could be so cruel.
Now I wonder if the world is filled
with animals such as you.
CONAN
You speak of animals as if they
were less than men. But animals
don't stab their brothers in the
back or steal their mother's only
possession. And they never lie.
TAMARA
I haven't lied.
Conan get off his horse, unties Tamara and gives her a water
sack. Tamara greedily drinks down the water.
CONAN
Very well. Give me your name.
TAMARA
I am Tamara Amelia Karushan. And
you?
CONAN
I am Conan.
TAMARA
Conan? That's it?
CONAN
What more names do I need?
Conan then grabs Tamara around her waist, putting her atop
his horse. He then mounts behind her, their bodies close.
Conan's mouth is only inches from her ear as he speaks.
CONAN (CONT'D)
There is only one truth I need from
you, Tamara Amelia Karushan. Why
does Khalar Singh want you?
Tamara looks away, but doesn't respond.
CONAN (CONT'D)
Then let's hope it's for your
cooking.
A campfire amidst several large boulders, a line of windmills
on the horizon.
41.
Tamara struggles to manage a cooking pot over a blaze. Conan
comes over and smells the pot; his face scrunches from the
odor.
CONAN
Trying to poison me?
Tamara steps back and gets down on her knees, her hands
clasped.
CONAN (CONT'D)
What are you doing?
TAMARA
Before we eat, I must pray.
CONAN
Crom! What would you pray for? That
a bone may not get stuck in your
throat? No words nor gods will give
you one more moment than fate
allows you.
TAMARA
Then you have no faith. And I am
sorry for you.
CONAN
I need no pity.
TAMARA
But you do. You live in a world
that is harsh and short. Where fate
is unyielding and hope is a cruel
joke. I live in a world with a
purpose that guides me, where faith
sustains me.
Suddenly, Conan KICKS DIRT PAST TAMARA, ONTO THE FIRE. The
fire goes out, plunging everything into darkness.
TAMARA (CONT'D)
Why did you--
Suddenly, there's the sound of FIGHTING. Grunting, blows
being interchanged, then a LOUD SNAP AS BONES ARE BROKEN.
A moment later, the flames of the fire are stoked up again,
revealing Conan standing over the groaning REMO. The other
two SHADOW SCOUTS are dead.
Tamara instinctively jumps back.
42.
CONAN
Don't worry. His back is broken. He
won't be slinking away this time.
As Tamara gapes at Remo, Conan simply pulls the cooking pot
off the fire.
CONAN (CONT'D)
Now, let's eat.
TAMARA
But -- what about him?!
Remo GROANS in pain.
CONAN
I enjoy a little music with my
meal.
DISSOLVE TO:
AERIAL SHOT - POV - SOARING
Across steep valleys and up jagged peaks we race into steep
and unforgiving mountains. Far off, we hear a pair of
thunderous booms, almost like the sound of a heartbeat.
THUMP, THUMP.
Cresting over a set of peaks, a gorge is revealed below, and
BENEATH IT--
A city carved out of the purple granite of a mountainous
gorge. Hundred-foot towers rise up, their pinnacles crafted
to depict ANGRY, GOD-LIKE FACES.
As we pass one of the faces, again we hear the sound of a
thunderous heartbeat, now closer. THUMP, THUMP.
We GLIDE DOWN past hundred foot high pillars of flames,
towards the growing sounds of SCREAMING and WAILING.
The streets of Acheron are lined with thousands of SLAVES,
young and old, chained together, toiling under the lash of
their cruel masters, the
ACHERONIAN WARRIORS
Towering over the slaves, the warriors are a fearsome sight.
Their armor, crafted from the bones of their defeated
enemies, rises to a mask which covers much of their features.
43.
Only the red irises of their eyes peer through. That and
their pitch black skin.
The slaves hobble down the main boulevard, their naked feet
splashing in streams of BLOOD which flow from the
ACHERONIAN PYRAMID
Up ahead looms a colossal pyramid, surrounded in a semi-
circle by five massive statues. As we grow closer the
grotesque surface of the pyramid becomes clearer, one hewn
from cracked bone and empty sockets.
The thunderous heartbeat seems all around us now. THUMP,
THUMP.
The three hundred foot high edifice is made ENTIRELY OF
THOUSANDS OF HUMAN SKULLS. Many of the skulls still drip with
blood, pouring down from the pyramid's crest, where stands
A BLACK THRONE
Images of snakes gorging themselves on hapless victims are
carved in bas relief into the throne's surface.
Standing before the throne, surrounded by BLACK ROBED PRIESTS
are a man and woman, mere shadows in the silhouette of
torches.
The HEAD PRIEST and his ACOLYTE approach with TWO CROWNS. One
is made of GOLD, the other of IRON.
The Gold crown goes on the head of the man. For the woman,
the Iron crown is placed on her head.
And suddenly, THUMP, THUMP. IRON SPIKES SHOOT OUT OF THE IRON
CROWN PIERCING THE WOMAN'S FOREHEAD, HER SCREAMS ECHOES
THROUGHOUT THE CITY.
Blood streams down the woman's face as she turns toward the
torchlight.
IT IS TAMARA.
CUT TO:
Tamara leaps up, startled. Her face is covered in sweat, her
eyes as terrified as the victim from her dream.
Nearby we hear screaming of another type. Remo.
44.
MUFFLED SCREAMS. We pull out of Remo's wide mouth, stuffed
with cloth, trying to bellow in uncontrollable agony.
A hand comes in and pulls out the cloth. It's Conan.
REMO
Please! Mercy!
CONAN
You are more fit to inflict torture
than to endure it. Your life is not
nailed to your spine as my peoples
are.
We PULL OUT, revealing that Remo arms are spread-eagle,
attached to ropes pulled taught by opposing tree limbs.
Conan nudges him with the point of his sword. Remo SCREAMS in
agony, then speaks in his savage, broken dialect.
REMO
Stop! Stop! I know how make you
rich! Rich! You hear name Khalar
Singh? You have what he want. The
girl, yes? Khalar give you anything
for her. More!
CONAN
Why would he?
Remo pauses, not wanting to answer. Conan put the blade back
to Remo's neck.
REMO
She could be the one.
CONAN
One what?
REMO
The one. The Queen.
Conan's mind races, remembering Khalar's words from long ago.
CONAN
A queen in hiding.
REMO
Yes! Yes! I sent to find her. Bring
her. He wait for me now, at Great
Wall. He pay you anything. More!
45.
CONAN
So I should ransom her to your
master? Not exactly loyal -- but
still, a good idea.
Conan pulls out a sheet of handwritten paper from Remo's
tunic.
CONAN (CONT'D)
You'll help me deliver it.
Torchlight dots the heights of a fifty-foot high stone wall,
erected between giant rock formations, an impassable barrier
that runs countless miles.
The wreckage of old siege equipment dots the hillside before
the wall.
An aging catapult looks down upon the wall below. Slowly, it
begins to turn.
Conan pushes the catapult until it aims towards the Great
Wall.
We hear MUFFLED SCREAMS, and find Remo tied to a boulder
cradled in the catapult. Conan pulls the gag out of Remo's
mouth.
REMO
Please! Please! I help you! I do
anything you wish!
Conan stuffs a parchment in his mouth. He takes out his sword
and cuts another NOTCH into his arm.
CONAN
Good. Die.
He then cuts the rope and WHOOSH! The catapult fires tossing
Remo and the rock he's tied to high into the night sky.
BOOM! Patrolling SOLDIERS are crushed beneath the massive
rock as it reduces a section of wall to rubble.
CUT TO:
46.
KHALAR
Stares down at Remo's broken body. Ukafa and Fariq stand
beside him.
KHALAR SINGH
He brought a message?
Ukafa hands him the bloodied parchment. Khalar reads it.
KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
Gold, for the girl. A ransom, for
me to deliver in person.
UKAFA
I'll find them -- and come back
with their heads.
FARIQ
You let the girl escape once,
Ukafa. What makes you think you can
do better now?
UKAFA
I did what?
FARIQ
I found the monastery. It was my
understanding that you were in
charge of its capture --
Ukafa's anger grows.
KHALAR SINGH
Enough! We will take no chances. We
will pay this thief what he wants,
and more.
Conan returns from the nearby hills, carrying a pair of
rabbits he's hunted and skinned.
He looks around, surprised not to find Tamara. He hears a
yelp from nearby and walks to a dirt path beyond the
clearing.
TAMARA
She's tied up and gagged and she's wormed her way this far,
muddying and scraping herself all along the way. She lets out
a frustrated grunt as Conan simply picks her back up and
carries her back to the outcropping.
47.
He pulls the gag from her mouth and drops a skinned rabbit at
her feet.
CONAN
Here. Eat.
Tamara squirms away from the carcass, disgusted.
TAMARA
Couldn't you at least cook it
first?
CONAN
Fire draws attention.
Conan tears into his rabbit, chewing on the raw meat.
TAMARA
Does it bother you, blood on your
hands?
CONAN
The only blood on these hands I
claimed with my own sword.
TAMARA
What does that mean?
CONAN
Clean hands mean nothing. Kings and
Queens claim more lives than I will
ever meet, and not a drop is
spilled in their presence.
TAMARA
What are you talking about? I've
done no harm to you. I've done no
harm to anyone.
Conan confronts her, enraged.
CONAN
You lie. You are the very reason my
people are dead.
TAMARA
Are you mad? I never met your
people.
CONAN
But Khalar Singh has. He destroyed
my people, looking for you.
Suddenly Tamara understands.
48.
TAMARA
The one who came for us? His name
is Khalar Singh?
CONAN
You know this.
TAMARA
We did not know who sought us, only
that we were sought.
CONAN
You hid from him. And while you
did, others died in your place.
TAMARA
If we did not hide, countless more
would have been killed! You do not
know what purpose he has for our
queen.
CONAN
And I do not care, for he will not
live to see it bear fruit!
Tamara is shocked.
TAMARA
Wait -- you seek to kill this
Khalar? We have the same aim. He
takes my queen to Khor Kalba. I
have sworn an oath to protect her.
I can help you.
CONAN
Enough lies.
Conan puts the gag back in her mouth and binds her hands.
Conan watches the Great Wall silently, absently playing with
a DAGGER in his hand as he gauges the many guardposts along
the wall. The archers. The barrels of oil. The cavalry.
He feels eyes upon him and looks down at Tamara, still bound
and gagged, her eyes burning holes in his forehead. Conan
pulls out her gag.
CONAN
You will keep quiet.
49.
TAMARA
What use is talking? You won't
believe a word I speak. I only want
to know this -- how will you kill
Khalar? You are too big to play the
assassin.
CONAN
You will be the lure that will draw
me close. Then I will scale the
wall and cut him down where he
stands.
TAMARA
And the archers and cavalry? They
will be napping?
CONAN
They will not be a problem.
Tamara thinks about it.
TAMARA
No. Not good enough.
Conan is shocked by her brazen response.
CONAN
Did I ask?
TAMARA
Should you fail, I'll be left
without a weapon, helpless in my
enemies hands. Let me help, Conan.
Conan responds by putting the gag back in her mouth.
CONAN
I will not fail.
But still Tamara glares at him -- and we can see the hint of
Conan's resolve bending.
DISSOLVE TO:
Khalar Singh stands atop the wall, awaiting Conan. Fariq
draws close.
FARIQ
Let me take care of this thief,
father. He's beneath your notice.
50.
KHALAR SINGH
He killed Remo, likely his cavalry
legion as well. Whatever he is, he
is more than a mere thief.
Then, off in the distance, at the far edge of the desert
clearing, two figures step out from amongst the boulders.
CONAN AND TAMARA
Conan holds a squirming, but bound Tamara.
CONAN
Be still!
Conan thrusts Tamara in Khalar's direction.
CONAN (CONT'D)
(yelling to Khalar)
I have what you want! Where's my
gold?!
KHALAR
Khalar reaches down and lifts a heavy sack of gold coins.
KHALAR SINGH
(YELLING BACK)
Triple your price. Come and claim
it.
GATES OF THE WALL - MOMENTS LATER
The gates open and Khalar strides out into the clearing.
CONAN AND TAMARA
stand a hundred feet ahead.
KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
Send her to me.
CONAN
Send the gold.
Khalar Singh throws the gold sack. It lands halfway between
them. He sends Tamara ahead, her mouth gagged.
But the moment Tamara reaches the gold --
From out underneath the sand, FOUR HORSEMEN rise up out of
the desert floor. They each bear weighted nets and spiked
lances, and they surround Conan.
51.
The first rider gallops towards Conan who simply LOPS OFF THE
HORSES FRONT LEGS. As the beast collapses, Conan crushes the
rider's skull with his broadsword.
The next two riders attack together, but Conan dodges their
nets and rips away one of their spears, only to lodge it into
the other rider's chest. He dives at and tackles the first
rider, TOPPLING HIM, ALONG WITH HIS HORSE. He snaps the
second rider's neck.
The last rider comes at Conan, who horizontally slashes RIGHT
THROUGH THE HORSE'S NECK AND THEN THE RIDER'S NECK. Both
human and animal head tumble to the desert floor.
All four riders are dead, in a matter of seconds.
KHALAR
Smiles. He's got Tamara by the neck.
KHALAR SINGH
You're fast. But are you fast
enough?
Conan's eyes go to the top of the wall, where CHEREN and his
archer prepare to fire. Conan rushes forward as the flaming
arrows stream toward him.
EXPLOSIONS rip through the air where Conan was, throwing up a
huge dust cloud.
Conan bursts out of the dust cloud, lunging in an attack.
But Khalar Singh is not there. He has withdrawn inside the
gates.
Baring his teeth, Conan runs at the wall itself.
Cheren and the archers let loose another volley at Conan, who
evades and strikes away the falling arrows with his sword.
Explosions fill the air, but none of them scorch Conan as he
REACHES
THE GREAT WALL
Conan hits the base of the wall at full stride, like a
mountain lion. Reaching out, he launches himself up, taking
half the vertical of the wall in a single leap.
Digging his hand into the seam of the wooden beams, he stops
only to vault up again, taking the forty foot wall in two
upward bounds.
52.
WALL WALK
Conan leaps upon wall walk, the passageway atop the Great
Wall.
FARIQ
Tries to hide his surprise. Even as he draws his sword, Conan
takes out the four SOLDIERS in his way.
FARIQ
You should have run, while you
could.
Conan looks at the sword. It strikes a chord in him. IT IS
THE SWORD HIS FATHER FORGED! Enraged, Conan charges the
slight Fariq.
Fariq partially parries the attack. He's obviously well-
trained, but he's no match for Conan. The tip of Conan' blade
cuts a large gash in Fariq's cheek.
KHALAR SINGH
Fariq!
Khalar Singh arrives, grabbing his son by his collar and
flinging him away from the barbarian. Fariq struggles to
stand, trying in vain to hide his embarrassment.
Conan and Khalar Singh size each other up on the narrow wall
walk.
CONAN
I was wondering what it would take
for you to stop cowering.
KHALAR SINGH
I wasn't cowering. I was studying.
You're quite gifted with a sword,
but it's not from schooling. Your
speed and power makes up for a lack
of -- finesse. I've seen such
fighting before -- Cimmerian.
Enraged, Conan charges Khalar Singh. He swings down on Khalar
Singh's head, only when the sword reaches it, it finds
nothing but air. Khalar is fast.
KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
Cimmerian it is. Now it makes
sense. You came for blood, not
gold.
53.
Conan responds by lunging in, swinging his broadsword in a
broad arc, with all his might. Even in the small space,
Khalar's lateral speed is dizzying. He sidesteps Conan's
attack and backhands Conan's face with the flat of his
tulwar.
Conan's resolve wavers momentarily, knowing Khalar could have
just as easily sliced his throat.
KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
Your people barely afforded me a
challenge. You're little more than
beasts.
Conan comes at Khalar with twice as much fury, smashing
entire posts as he hacks at the warlord, who simply evades
the attack.
Down the wall walk they move, Conan attacking while Khalar
seems complacent enough just to defend.
KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
You've come a long way, barbarian,
only to fail.
Khalar ducks Conan's last wild swing and gashes Conan twice,
both deeply in his midsection. Khalar then KICKS Conan,
sending the Cimmerian slamming onto the rock parapet.
CRUNCH. Conan lands directly on his back, his sword
clattering away from him. Khalar's men back away into a
circle. Conan struggles to get on all fours.
Khalar KICKS Conan in his shattered chest, lifting Conan off
the ground with his might. He follows up with a devastating
punch to Conan's face, one which lands like a piledriver.
CRUNCH.
Conan can only bleed as Khalar looms over him.
KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
So much for vengeance.
(to his soldiers)
Get me oil -- and a torch.
Soldiers quickly bring over a bucket of oil and a lit torch.
KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
Is that really the best you could
do? Is that as far as you could
think ahead? Just rush in and kill
me?
54.
Behind Khalar Singh, Conan spots Tamara being brought up, her
hands bound. Her eyes show an intense fear, but resolve as
well.
TAMARA' HANDS
Between the bonds she slips down a blade. It's CONAN'S
DAGGER. She quickly cuts her bonds.
With all the attention focused on Conan, no one is quick
enough to stop her as GRABS THE TORCH FROM THE SOLDIER,
LIGHTING THE ARROWS IN CHEREN'S QUIVER.
Cheren spins around, sees the flames reaching his pitched
arrows.
CHEREN
No!!
But it's far too late. Tamara hits the floor, beside Conan.
BOOM.
EXPLOSION
The blast sends parts of Cheren flying in every direction.
Ukafa, Fariq, and the wall guards are flattened by the
concussion.
Khalar Singh, who was standing closer to the explosion, is
THROWN AGAINST THE WALL!
KHALAR SINGH
The warlord slowly rises, his head pounding from the
explosion. He looks up. The entire parapet is on fire.
He grits his teeth and climbs the wall.
ATOP THE WALL
A thick wall of flame rages before Khalar. Conan and Tamara
are gone. He looks over the far side of the wall, where two
figures on horseback ride off into the distance, Tamara
holding Conan atop the horse.
Ukafa and Fariq rise and see what Khalar Singh sees.
KHALAR SINGH
Ukafa, you will take half our
forces North, to the Sea. I will
take the rest South.
FARIQ
What of me, father?
55.
KHALAR SINGH
You will return to Khor Kalba. You
will feed the women to the beast
until you find our Queen.
FARIQ
I will not. I will track the
barbarian with you --
Enraged, Khalar Singh grabs him by the back of his head,
pulling him in close.
KHALAR SINGH
You think I care what you wish?!
You want to play warrior? It is not
in you. One day you will be king,
but warlord, never.
FARIQ
I can. Let me prove it to you!
KHALAR SINGH
You will not risk your life again.
You are my line, my successor. You
will not throw away all that I have
worked for.
A smile creeps up on Ukafa's face, watching Fariq's
embarrassment. He withdraws hastily, all eyes on him.
KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
(without looking at Ukafa)
If I find you smiling before you
bring me the girl, I will take
every tooth I see.
Ukafa buries the smile as Khalar turns to the wall of flames
left in Conan's wake.
CUT TO:
Conan steps out onto the deck of a sixty-foot djunk,
traveling quickly down a wide and powerful river.
ARTUS
Look what we have here. A hill ape
in over his head.
Conan spins to see the rough, brightly dressed Zamoran pirate
ARTUS leaping down from the quarterdeck, his sword out.
The other ZAMORAN PIRATES draw near as well. Tamara sees the
scene, suddenly uncomfortable.
CONAN
I was just wondering what that
smell was.
(sniffs near Artus)
Now I know.
ARTUS
We take no stowaways. Only paying
passengers. You've best be laden
with gold.
CONAN
If it's metal you seek, perhaps
you'd settle for steel.
58.
In a flash Conan's sword lunges forward. CLANG. It meets
Artus's, sparking as they collide. Artus LAUGHS.
CONAN (CONT'D)
Still fast Artus.
ARTUS
Fast, deadly, charming, rakishly
handsome.
(to the pirates)
All hail Conan!
PIRATES
All hail Conan!
Artus slaps his hand on Conan's back and Conan winces in
pain.
ARTUS
Sorry, friend. Looks like you've
had a rough road.
CONAN
It won't get easier. Khalar Singh
lives. He'll be coming for me and
the girl.
ARTUS
Good. We're scrapping for a fight
these days.
CONAN
This one may be more than you wish.
I need you to get me close to Khor
Kalba.
Artus rubs his beard.
ARTUS
Rest up. We'll get you there.
Conan withdraws to his room.
The enormous siege vessel lies before a burning PORT CITY.
A SAILOR, crying, grovels on his knees before Khalar and his
men.
SAILOR
It was a pirate ship. They left as
soon as the girl and the large one
boarded.
KHALAR SINGH
Which way did they sail?
SAILOR
North.
Khalar is surprised.
KHALAR SINGH
Are you certain?
SAILOR
Yes, please, I'm telling you the
truth!
Khalar nods to one of his men, who slits the Sailor's throat.
Khalar turns to his FALCONER, with the huge bird of prey on
his arm.
61.
KHALAR SINGH
Send word to Ukafa. They come to
him by sea.
The Falconer nods and heads off. Khalar looks to his
soldiers.
KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
Find me a warship.
CUT TO:
The ship sails like a ghost over black water, the stars lit
up impossibly bright. Artus finds Tamara sitting near the
bow. He hands her a steaming bowl of food.
ARTUS
Try not to taste it going down
would be my advice.
TAMARA
You've known Conan long?
ARTUS
We sailed with him for a while. I
would like to say I know the man.
TAMARA
He is a riddle to me.
ARTUS
Aye, he's that too.
TAMARA
We have the same goal. Why will he
not trust me?
ARTUS
Why would he? He's a stranger in
every land he trods. A man with no
home, no people, none but the
company of ghosts. And he bears the
weight of their deaths every moment
of every day.
TAMARA
That is no way to live.
62.
ARTUS
He doesn't live. I've seen in him
great mirth, only to watch it
smothered by greater melancholy. He
owes a blood debt, and he can
entertain no other joy, no other
cause, until it is fulfilled.
TAMARA
And yet you call him friend, and
risk death to help him.
ARTUS
Let me tell you something of Conan.
He will never lie. He will never
break a trust, once given. And he
will never, ever give up.
TAMARA
He's a stubborn ass.
Artus LAUGHS.
ARTUS
He is that, lass. He is that.
CUT TO:
Tamara steps out onto the deck, grabbing her pounding head.
Her first hangover. She hears a THUMPING sound, followed by
ANOTHER, and walks towards the side of the deck.
Tamara looks overboard, to the water below.
TAMARA'S POV
THE RIVER IS FILLED WITH BODIES! Bloated, they float in blood
red water as flies buzz around them. One of them hits the
hull of the boat. THUMP.
Tamara blinks, unsure if the vision is real -- but then she's
joined by other PIRATES who gape at the bodies below.
PIRATE 1
To stations! To stations!
Tamara turns and up ahead spies --
BLACK WARSHIP
The larger warship cuts through the water, manned by a legion
of rowers. On the deck of the warship, UKAFA and his SPEARMEN
stand. The SAILORS get the most out of the billowing black
sails. The ship gains fast.
THE GALLEY
Conan exits his room, sees the danger. Artus appears at his
side.
ARTUS
What do you think? They have us
outnumbered, but we might beat
their speed.
67.
CONAN
That is what they wish. They drive
us to another force, approaching
from the south.
ARTUS
Then we fight?
CONAN
No. We give them what they think
they want.
(to the Pirates)
About ship! Now!
The pirates leap into action, tacking and turning the galley
with great speed and efficiency.
THE WARSHIP
Ukafa smiles, his gold teeth shining. The ship's CAPTAIN
stands beside him.
CAPTAIN
They're turning to run.
UKAFA
Good. We only need stay close.
THE GALLEY
Is turned around now, fleeing. ARCHERS from the Warship fire
arrows that barely reach the Galley. The Pirates dodge the
few that land on deck.
Tamara reaches Conan and Artus. She's worried to say the
least.
ARTUS
And now?
CONAN
Let us show them why she is called
the Wasp.
Artus smiles. He was hoping Conan would say that.
TAMARA
Why is she called the Wasp?
ARTUS
Open astern! Load the stinger!
The Pirates rush to the back of the ship.
68.
THE BLACK WARSHIP
The Captain stares ahead, confused.
CAPTAIN
They are doing -- something.
Sure enough, the stern of the ship begins to part, revealing -
A MASSIVE CROSSBOW
Mounted with a barbed harpoon, fifteen feet long.
CONAN
Fire!
They fire the weapon. The harpoon races for the bow of the
Warship, a thick rope trailing it. It smashes into the wood,
ripping through it like it was paper.
CONAN (CONT'D)
Rip her apart!
The Pirates grab the heavy rope and run, pulling the rope,
and the harpoon back towards the Wasp.
As it's pulled out, the barbs of the harpoon rip a wider hole
in the warship.
WARSHIP
The Captain and crew are in a panic. Men rush to patch the
gaping hole in the hull.
SAILOR
We're taking on water!
CAPTAIN
Hard to port!
UKAFA
No. Let them fire again!
CAPTAIN
We will sink.
Ukafa guts the captain with his spear.
UKAFA
So be it.
(to his spearmen)
Get below. Be ready.
GALLEY
69.
The pirates load the harpoon in the crossbow device a second
time.
CONAN
Fire!
It fires, smashing again into the wooden hull of the Warship.
WARSHIP - INSIDE
The harpoon lodges deep inside the hull -- where Ukafa and
his spearmen wait.
UKAFA
Now!
They rush forward and grab onto the harpoon.
GALLEY
ARTUS
Bring her back!
Again, the pirates pull the harpoon back out. It falls into
the water as they pull on the rope tied to it.
They do not notice Ukafa and his dozen spearmen clasping the
very same rope as its pulled toward the Galley.
Artus looks at the Warship. It's foundering and sinking
quickly.
ARTUS (CONT'D)
She's dead in the water!
A CHEER goes up among the pirates --
And then one PIRATE takes a spear through the chest. All eyes
turn to the side of the Wasp, where Ukafa and his men climb
aboard.
Conan's eyes alight with fury.
CONAN
Good. I was growing weary with
boredom.
Conan motions to a pair of pirates.
CONAN (CONT'D)
Hide her below.
BATTLE
70.
The Spearmen rush to the attack. The pirates spring to the
defense of the ship, countering the Spearmen with cutlass and
dagger. Ukafa marshals his men as a fierce battle rages.
UKAFA
Find the girl!
The Spearmen quickly make their way to the interior of the
galley, throwing the dead bodies of the pirates overboard.
CONAN
Conan grabs the nearby jib, swings over, and plants both feet
in the face of one of the spearmen, knocking him over the
side.
ARTUS
The sea captain proves dangerous in his own right, grabbing
the head of one of the Spearmen and violently pulling it down
to the gunwale of the ship, impaling the Spearman's eye on a
handspike.
UKAFA
The massive warrior shows incredible speed as well, dodging
one cutlass attack only to turn the weapon upon another
pirate.
CONAN
The Cimmerian cuts through a Spearman, his gaze focused on
Ukafa. Ukafa stares right back as he runs through a pair of
pirates. Finally, the two warriors stand only feet apart.
The two warriors eye each other with satisfaction. Ukafa's
frightening, sharpened gold teeth shine as he smiles.
UKAFA (CONT'D)
We are each the last of our tribe,
Cimmerian. Yours dies this day.
Conan responds by lunging forward, swinging his sword in a
broad arc. Ukafa is just as quick, stepping back and allowing
his spear to block the swing.
Ukafa whirls the war spear in great circles, forcing Conan to
parry, stepping back beyond the spear's reach.
The two powerful warriors trade blows back and forth, neither
able to gain the advantage.
71.
UKAFA (CONT'D)
Your head will top my spear today,
but know Khalar's pig son will soon
share your fate.
Ukafa tries to spear Conan through the chest, and Conan
decides to drop his sword, grabbing the spear as it passes by
him.
Conan then pulls on the spear, throwing Ukafa off his
balance, towards Conan. Conan then kicks the warrior in the
chest, hurtling Ukafa backwards.
Now Conan turns the spear on its master. Ukafa, unarmed, is
forced to backpedal as Conan thrusts the spear at him. A pair
of close misses leaves Ukafa with gashes on his chest and
arm, but he manages to knock the spear from Conan's hands.
The battle goes to hand-to-hand. It's primal, each of them
covered in blood. Ukafa bear hugs Conan, then resorts to
using his teeth to bite into Conan's shoulder.
Conan YELLS IN PAIN, butting Ukafa's head and knocking him
back. Conan falls to the stern of the ship, his back against
the harpoon crossbow.
Ukafa shakes off the head butt, and sees his spear nearby. He
picks it up.
UKAFA (CONT'D)
Now finally, you die.
He raises up to hurl the spear through Conan, only to see
Conan manning the harpoon, NOW TURNED TO FACE UKAFA.
The crossbow fires and the harpoon punches a massive hole
through Ukafa, its momentum throwing him off the galley, into
the sea beyond.
TAMARA
She hides inside a small compartment of the ship. She hears
FOOTSTEPS walking past, then returning. An ARM suddenly
reaches in and grabs her.
As she's pulled out, Tamara SCREAMS right in Conan's face. He
doesn't even flinch.
CONAN
Time to go.
72.
The battle ended, the pirates toss the dead Spearmen into the
sea and prepare to make sail again.
Meanwhile, Conan lashes his sword to his back, standing by
the gunwales with Tamara and Artus, a SMALL DINGHY waiting
below.
ARTUS
I could get you closer. Another
half day along the coast --
CONAN
I need you head west, to draw off
our pursuers. I'll find another
path to Khor Kalba.
ARTUS
So be it. Swift wind at your backs.
Conan rows away from the galley with powerful strokes.
TAMARA
So you are taking me with you to
Khor Kalba.
CONAN
I never said that. But I won't
leave a virgin onboard a pirate
ship, alone.
TAMARA
I -- but -- who said I was a
virgin?
Conan just shakes his head as a parting fog reveals a large
Colossus head, the fallen remains of an enormous statue,
lying agape on the shoreline.
Khalar looks at the destruction of Ukafa's warship, the
bodies filling the water. Khalar spots Ukafa's dead body
floating there, harpoon still lodged in his chest.
74.
The ship's CAPTAIN approaches.
CAPTAIN
The pirate ship sailed to the west.
Even under full sail it'll be no
easy task to overtake her.
Just then, a FALCON approaches. The Falconer retrieves it, a
parchment tied to its talon. He passes it on to Khalar Singh.
Khalar Singh reads it, a smile creeping upon his face.
KHALAR SINGH
Fariq has done well.
(to the Captain)
Head east, back to Khor Kalba.
CAPTAIN
But our chase points the other way.
KHALAR SINGH
The chase is over. They come to me
now.
Tamara watches Conan from a distance. He silently stalks prey
with nothing more than a knife.
A BOAR
Its ears listen intently, aware. Suddenly, it bolts.
CONAN
Is just as quick, racing through the forest on a intercepting
course with the great beast. He leaps over a fallen log,
throwing his dagger with a sweep of his arm.
The boar goes down, the blade through its jugular. Conan
walks up to the struggling beast, showing no satisfaction as
he mercifully SNAPS its neck.
Conan powers his way to the top of a high ridge, spotting
down in the vista below:
KHOR KALBA
Surrounded on three sides by the coastline, the stone
fortress of Khalar Singh rests on a plateau, overlooking a
bustling, tented city below.
Conan spots a long CARAVAN of packed camels working their way
towards town, driven by DESERT TRADERS from Shem.
CONAN
We'll slip in, along with those
traders. But you'll need a change
of clothes, those monks' robes will
draw attention.
Tamara looks down at her loose-fitting robes.
TAMARA
What will I wear?
The caravan rides up to the walled entrance to the city,
guarded by Khalar's troops. Blended in amongst the others,
Conan now wears the elaborate head scarf and clothes of
Shemish traders, obscuring all but his eyes.
TAMARA
Tamara is dressed like a Shemish serving girl, her taut body
barely covered by silken drapings. She glares at Conan,
miserable.
TAMARA
I don't understand why I couldn't
be dressed as you are. I look like
a whore.
CONAN
And what better disguise for a
monk?
Conan tugs on the rope for the camel to move faster. The
Camel BRAYS and rears. Conan yanks harder and the camel flies
forward, its eyes wide.
Conan meets its eye.
78.
CONAN (CONT'D)
Do not test me, beast.
TAMARA
Is there not a living thing you can
be at peace with?
They ride into the city, past the troops.
Conan and Tamara walk through the town's teeming market, a
otherworldly bazaar replete with animal sacrifices, veiled
faces and not a hint of morality.
STRANGER
A FIGURE, his form hidden beneath a cloak, spots Conan and
Tamara as they enter, and begins to follow them.
WOODEN PLATFORM
The city ends at the sheer cliff wall at the bottom of the
plateau. There stands a WOODEN PLATFORM that is lowered by a
massive winch, unloading a cavalry regiment and then raising
back up to the fortress above.
CONAN
It's probably only way into
Khalar's fortress. I'm sure it is
heavily guarded at all times, day
and night.
TAMARA
So we must try to scale the cliff.
CONAN
And dodge arrows as we do so?
Conan motions up to the winch. Standing beside it are a half
dozen of the four-armed ARCHERS.
CONAN (CONT'D)
During the day, we'd easily be
spotted on the climb. And it would
be useless to even attempt at
night. No, we must find another
way.
STRANGER'S POV
As Conan continues around the base of the mesa, the Figure
following Conan is joined by TWO OTHERS.
79.
ALLEYWAY
Conan and Tamara reach a less crowded area of the village
when a VOICE rings out behind them.
VOICE (O.S.)
Halt.
Conan spins, sword at the ready. From out of the shadows
comes a pair of MEN, their beady eyes fixed on Tamara.
CONAN
Thieves. You'll regret finding me.
VOICE (O.S.)
I think not.
From out of the shadows steps the ONE-EYED THIEF, the same
one who Conan saved from Lucius' beatings. He smiles at
Conan, lifting a KEY from a rope around his neck
ONE EYED THIEF
It took longer than you think to
cut this out of Lucius' stomach.
After all that work, I figured I'd
keep it -- for old times' sake.
As they work their way up the circular stairwell, towards a
thin shaft of firelight up ahead.
By torchlight, Khalar Singh leads his black-armored PERSONAL
GUARD, two dozen men strong, across a rocky peninsula,
jutting out into the sea. On the back of Khalar's horse,
bound, rides the helpless Tamara.
As they round a large rock spire they spy a fearsome and awe
inspiring sight. A massive SKULL, seemingly a natural rock
formation, rises over the peninsula.
As they ride closer, we can make out one more detail -- the
mouth of the skull is actually a massive door, at least sixty
feet high, and seemingly made up of jagged bone. It has the
appearance of teeth, completing the skull illusion.
93.
Bloodied and weary, Conan approaches the Skull Rock. He has
nothing more than his sword, his loincloth and a small BURLAP
SACK tied to his hip.
He stumbles, falling to his knees. His wounds have taken a
grave toll. Still he stands and presses on.
He pushes on the doors. They do not budge in the least. He
puts his shoulder to the doors -- his every muscle straining
to their utmost. Again -- no movement.
Conan backs away, taking stock of the surroundings. He climbs
up the side of the rock.
Conan climbs -- muscles straining -- slipping -- hanging on
by one hand -- and climbing again.
THUMP-THUMP. The statuary shakes, indeed the whole earth
does. Conan nearly slips, but keeps his grip.
CONAN
Crom.
He reaches the eye of the skull.
REVERSE ANGLE
With the moon over his shoulder, Conan stares down at the
unholy sight before him. We pull back revealing Tamara, her
blood draining from her body.
96.
Khalar's HORSE stands near the entrance. Conan puts Tamara's
body carefully atop the horse, then mounts it himself. He
positions her in front of him, his arms encircling her.
Conan gives her lifeless body one last kiss, her blood
staining his lips red, as his mother's did as a child.
A blazing sun threatens to explode over the nearby mountains.
Conan holds a single torch in his hand. His look is hard.
Grim.
We pull back to reveal a funeral pyre, Tamara's body atop it.
Conan places the torch to the pyre. It quickly spreads.
We move in, closer and closer upon Conan's ice blue eyes, a
blazing fire erupting in them. A fire that will never be
extinguished.
TAMARA (O.S.)
Live, Conan. Live.
FADE TO BLACK.
