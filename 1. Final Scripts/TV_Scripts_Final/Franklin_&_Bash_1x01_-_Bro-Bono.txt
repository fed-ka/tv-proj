      INT. INFELD/DANIELS - KARP S OFFICE - DAY (DAY ONE)11

      We re at Infeld/Daniels, but let s not give that away just 
      yet. 

                                  JARED
                    I never kiss and tell. 

                                  PETER
                    Yeah, right.  Six ball, side 
                    pocket.

      A POOL CUE takes aim at a white BALL on the green velvet of a 
      billiards table.  The stick misses the ball.

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    Mulligan?

                                  JARED
                    No problem, buddy.  Got all day.

      A cocktail party is taking place, with about fifteen well-
      dressed corporate types.  Everyone s laughing, sipping 
      martinis, someone is fiddling with the firm s karaoke 
      machine.

      This time JARED FRANKLIN connects and the cue ball hits the 
      six, but doesn t go in.  As the scene plays out, we ll see 
      that both guys are terrible but blissfully unaware of it.  
      PETER BASH chalks his cue.

                                  PETER
                    What about Ann Weisler?

                                  JARED
                    What about her?  

                                  PETER
                    You couldn t keep that a secret.

                                  JARED
                    I didn t tell anybody but you.  
                    What happened that night will die 
                    with me.  

                                  PINDAR
                    I love the Anne Weisler story.  
                    Making love on the beach in Del 
                    Mar.  Getting tangled up in the 
                    kelp.  Kelp is sexy.  Very slimy.            FRANKLIN & BASH - Production Draft 2ND WHITE - 9/21/10       2.


      REVEAL PINDAR SINGH on a LAPTOP enjoying the party via Skype.  
      He s drinking a beer.  Peter gives Jared an I-told-you-so-
      look. 

                                  JARED
                    Like I said, I didn t tell anybody.  
                    Pindar s not anybody.  He s a 
                    friend.  

                                  PINDAR
                    BFF s, Jared.  

      CARMEN PHILLIPS walks up.

                                  CARMEN
                    What s this I hear about you having 
                    sex with Hanna?  Everyone s talking 
                    about it.

                                  JARED
                    Nothing happened with Hanna.
                          (re: Pindar)
                    Bubble Boy over there c-blocked me.  

      Jared levels an icy stare toward the LAPTOP and Pindar.

                                  PINDAR
                    Don t look at me.  I didn t say 
                    anything.   

                                  DEBBIE
                          (to Jared)
                    Karp s coming.

      Everyone scrambles--

22INT. INFELD/DANIELS - HALLWAY - SAME 

      Senior partners DAMIEN KARP and HANNA LINDEN walk with MAYA 
      PAXTON, the 35ish beauty who looks like she s from money, and 
      the firm founder, the irrepressible STANTON INFELD.  

                                  KARP
                    See, that s significant.

                                  MAYA
                    What s significant?

                                  HANNA
                    That your husband said,  You knew 
                    who I was when you married me  
                    after you confronted him about 
                    cheating on you.              FRANKLIN & BASH - Production Draft 2ND WHITE - 9/21/10       3.


                                  INFELD
                    That s an admission of guilt and 
                    those nine words will trigger the 
                      infidelity clause against him.

                                  MAYA
                    I don t want things to get nasty.  
                    Neither does Rick.

                                  INFELD
                    Which is why both sides agreed to 
                      arbitration, to avoid having to 
                    fight it all out in court.  

                                  HANNA
                    Of course, if we can t settle it in 
                      arbitration, we may have no choice.

                                  INFELD
                    Let s hope it doesn t come to that.   
                    One catches more flies with honey.  
                    By the way, did you know I breed 
                      Portuguese honey bees?

                                  KARP
                    Let s step into my office--

      OFF KARP as they walk into--

      INT. INFELD/DANIELS - KARP S OFFICE - SAME TIME33

      A LOUD SURPRISE!!  The room of lawyers are gathered under a 
      BANNER that reads  Happy 50th Birthday Damien.   Peter and 
      Jared stand front and center greeting a surprised Karp.  
      Debbie sings a TORCHY SONG on the karaoke, Peter accompanying 
      on his GUITAR.

                                  PETER
                    Happy birthday.  

                                  JARED
                    You do not look fifty.  

                                  PETER
                      Exfoliating isn t just for women 
                    anymore, buddy.

                                  KARP
                    That s because I m not anywhere 
                    near fifty.

      Folks begin to leave or play pool.            FRANKLIN & BASH - Production Draft 2ND WHITE - 9/21/10       4.


                                  INFELD
                    It s your birthday?  I thought it 
                    was in September.

                                  KARP
                    It is.   

                                  JARED
                    But it wouldn t have been a 
                    surprise then.

                                  KARP
                          (re: pool table)
                    What the hell s this?

                                  JARED
                    From us.  The firm may have chipped 
                    in.  For all of it. 

                                  PETER
                    And who the hell s this?

                                  INFELD
                    Maya Paxton.  Maya, meet Peter Bash 
                    and Jared Franklin.

                                  PETER
                    Pleasure is entirely one-sided.

                                  MAYA
                    Aren t you the charmer?

                                  KARP
                          (hands off)
                    Maya s a new client.  We re 
                    handling her divorce. 

                                  INFELD
                    You d think with my name over the 
                    door someone would put a beverage 
                    in my hand.  Is that a karaoke 
                    machine?  

      Infeld escorts Maya into the party.

                                  CARMEN
                    Am I supposed to know her?

                                  JARED
                    Wife of Rick Paxton, the guy who 
                    climbs Everest alone and balloons 
                    solo around the world and swims the 
                    English Channel.             FRANKLIN & BASH - Production Draft 2ND WHITE - 9/21/10       5.


                                  PETER
                    Man s a walking cologne commercial.

      With lightning speed, Pindar has thrown up PICTURES of Rick 
      Paxton on the LAPTOP.  There s a HEADSHOT and a PICTURE of 
      him on a motorcycle with a topless WOMAN holding Paxton  
      around the waist.  

                                  HANNA
                    Paxton also owns a significant 
                    video game company.

                                  KARP
                    For now.  We re going to change 
                    that.  Okay, everybody, out.  Back 
                    to work.

                                  PETER
                    Loosen up, Damien.  It s almost 
                    your birthday.  

                                  JARED
                    Yeah, women want a guy who knows 
                    how to have fun.
                          (smiles at Hanna)
                    I want this to be a horse race 
                    between you and me and right now 
                    I m pulling away.  

                                  KARP
                    May I?

      Karp puts the guitar around his neck and does a BLISTERING 
      SOLO that shocks everyone.  He hands the guitar back.

                                  KARP (CONT D)
                    Needs tuning.

      OFF Jared, knowing he s got his work cut out.

      EXT. MAN CAVE (ESTABLISHING) - SAME NIGHT44

      Overlooking the city lights from its canyon perch.

      INT. MAN CAVE - THAT NIGHT55

    A BEER BOTTLE balances precariously on Pindar s head.  His 
      eyes look up at it, nervous as Carmen stands in front of him.  

                                  PINDAR
                    I don t feel so good.            FRANKLIN & BASH - Production Draft 2ND WHITE - 9/21/10       6.


                                  CARMEN
                    If you vomit near me again, Pindar, 
                    I swear I will take off your head.  
                    My sense of smell has been severely 
                    damaged because --

                                  PINDAR
                    Just do it then!

      WHACK!!  Carmen knocks the bottle off Pindar s head with a 
      breath-taking leg kick.  Cheers from TWO LAWYER BUDDIES.  
      Pindar collapses in a chair.

                                  CARMEN
                    Pay up. 

                                  PINDAR
                    I get a cut.

                    Listen, if the private investigator 
                    thing doesn t work out, there s 
                    always Special Forces. 

      The Lawyers open wallets and pay Carmen. 

                                  LAWYER #1 (CONT D)
                    Did you learn that in the joint?

                                  CARMEN
                          (contemptuous)
                     The joint ?  Really?

      Carmen walks insouciantly away, which takes us to Jared and 
      Peter playing Call of Duty on the FLAT SCREEN.

                                  JARED
                    If you were a chick, would you go

                    and the evidentiary rules are

                          (aimed at Glenna)
                    Sure.  How about ladies first.  My 
                    client, Maya Paxton, is seeking a 
                    divorce for loss of consortium.  
                    Mr. Paxton lost interest in his 
                    wife and they haven t had sex in 
                    eight months, which suggests he s 
                    reverted to his old ways.

                                  KARP
                    We will show that Rick Paxton has 
                    violated the infidelity clause in 
                    his pre-nup.

                                  RICK
                    Maya, that s not true...

                                  GLENNA
                      Interesting theory.  Don t suppose 
                    you have any proof, aside from the 
                    fact he s obviously grown tired of 
                    sleeping with his --

                                  RICK
                    Glenna-- no.

                                  HANNA
                    He s right. Unless you want to get 
                      sanctioned, I wouldn t finish that 
                    sentence.

                          (ignores him)
                    Because of Mr. Paxton s sexual 
                    history, dual infidelity clauses 
                    were instituted punishing both 
                    parties.

                    I m aware of that.          FRANKLIN & BASH - Production Draft 2ND WHITE - 9/21/10       12.


                                  GLENNA
                    It s hard for my client to have sex 
                    with his wife if she s always in 
                    Florida doing her Home Shopping

                                  KARP
                    And it s even harder to have sex if 
                    her husband is crossing the 
                    Atlantic in a hot air balloon.

                          (stands)
                    Whoa.  Hold it.  It s one thing to say 
                    I cheated on you, Maya, it s another to 
                    say I cheated on my solo flight.  

                                  MAYA
                    So glad to see you have your 
                      priorities in order, Rick.  God

                    But new evidence has come to light

                    I drove up in a golf cart.

                    When the police arrived, they took 
                      everyone s blood alcohol.  Mr. 
                    Dubois  was above the legal limit.

                    Did you charge everyone who drove 
                    up to the club with DUI?

                    Just the ones that punched the 
                    arresting officer.

                    didn t mean to punch him.

      Peter, Jared and Danny walk out trying to catch up with 
      Ellen.

                                  PETER
                    What kind of stunt was that?

                                  ELLEN
                    Look who s whining about stunts.  
                    See you guys at trial.*

      She starts to leave.*

                                  PETER*
                    What s your problem?*

      She stops, comes back, curious in spite of herself.*

                                  ELLEN
                    I ve been here eight years and I m 
                    still dealing with imbeciles like 
                    you two, while your sainted suck-up 
                    Janie, who s been here half as long 
                    as me, gets bumped up to Major 
                    Crimes.  Have a nice day.

      Ellen leaves.  

                                  JARED
                    Why can t I find a woman like that?

                                  DANNY
                    What s going on?  If the cop s so 
                    pissed, why don t they just stick 
                    with the assault? 

                                  PETER
                    If they just charge you and not 
                    everyone who threw a punch, we d 
                    argue selective prosecution.  This 
                    way, they can go after just you.

                                  JARED
                    They ll ask for jail time.  If 
                    you re convicted, they ll get it.

                                  DANNY
                    Guys, I had two beers.  I wasn t 
                    drunk.            FRANKLIN & BASH - Production Draft 2ND WHITE - 9/21/10       15.


                                  PETER
                    Where were you when you got the 
                    call to come here?

                                  DANNY
                    I was kicking it at home.

                                  JARED
                    Okay, when you say kicking it at 
                    home -- and by the way, feel free 
                    to join us in this decade -- where 
                    would that be?

      Danny just looks at Peter, seemingly afraid to answer.

                                  PETER
                    What s wrong?  This a tough 
                    question?

                                  DANNY

      EXT. RETIREMENT HOME - FIVE MINUTES LATER1414

      Peter, Jared and Danny get out of Peter s car and look up.

      REVERSE ANGLE -- CASA DEL PALMS RETIREMENT LIVING, a fraying-
        at-the-edges retirement community sitting on a golf course. 

                                  DANNY
                    I got in the game just as the 
                    economy tanked.  So I was last 
                    hired, first fired.  I couldn t 
                    keep the condo, so I came here.

                                  JARED
                    Are you going to be able to pay us?

                                  DANNY
                    I was kinda hoping you have a pro-
                    bono policy.  Bro-bono.

      An older woman, MAE, in her early 70 s, stands by a car 
      holding empty recyclable grocery bags.  There s a couple 
      other OLD PEOPLE (one we ll know later as NANETTE, 70).

                                  MAE
                    We got to get to the market, Danny.  
                    We miss free samples after five.           FRANKLIN & BASH - Production Draft 2ND WHITE - 9/21/10       16.


                                  DANNY
                    I ll be right there, Nana.
                          (to the guys)
                    If I get a DUI, I ll lose my 
                    license, right?

                                  PETER
                    Probably.  For a while.  

                                  DANNY
                    I drive my grandmother and her 
                    friends to the doctor and errands.  
                    I thought it would be a pain in the 
                    ass.  But turns out, they keep me 
                    young.

      Danny smiles, moves off to Grandma.  Peter is starting to 
      feel sorry for this guy -- but not Jared.

      INT. INFELD/DANIELS - LOBBY - SAME DAY1515

      Jared and Peter enter the building.  

                                  PETER
                    Admit it, you re glad Danny s 
                    fallen on rough times.  He was a 
                    dick to you in high school.

                                  JARED
                    That s not true, Peter.  Because 
                    There But For The Grace of God Go 
                    I... if I were a douche.  

      They see Maya Paxton approach, visibly upset.

                                  PETER
                    So... it went well?

                                  MAYA
                    Your colleagues only succeeded in 
                    getting Rick and his lawyer angry.  
                    And what a raging bitch.

                                  JARED
                    Hanna and Karp know your husband is 
                    a public figure and wants to keep 
                    this divorce quiet.  

                                  PETER
                    But the threat of blowing up the 
                      arbitration and taking this to a 
                    public trial is sound legal advice.          FRANKLIN & BASH - Production Draft 2ND WHITE - 9/21/10       17.


                                  JARED
                    It just lacks human compassion.  
                    And brings a lot more money into 
                    their firm and ours.  

      Peter shoots Jared a look.  Maya is surprised to hear such 
      candor.

                                  MAYA
                      I appreciate the honesty.  I can 
                    use more of it in my life, 
                    actually.  Thank you.

                                  JARED
                    Any time.  We re open three days a 
                    week.  

      Maya smiles, walks towards the exit.

                                  PETER
                    You really are determined to get us 
                    fired, aren t you?

      INT. INFELD/DANIELS - JARED AND PETER S OFFICE - EVENING1616

      Jared and Peter, ties off, are playing pool with Karp s pool 
      table, while Pindar watches via Skype.  They won t knock a 
      ball in the whole episode.

                                  PINDAR (ON SCREEN)
                    Carmen talked to a stripper who saw 
                    Danny break up the fight.  Why not 
                    put her on the stand? 

      Jared takes his shot, balls crashing everywhere. 

                                  JARED
                    Thought about it, but juries don t 
                    like strippers. 

      Peter shoots and the cue ball goes right in.  Scratch. 

                                  PETER
                    But you know who they love: old 
                    people.  We need to talk to Danny s 
                      grandmother and her friends, see if 
                    anyone noticed if he was sober when 
                    he left. 

                                  PINDAR 
                    I love old people.  I tried to live 
                    at a retirement home once.  They re 
                    clean there and there is no stigma 
                    to being house-bound.

                    You got it, buddy.  

      Jared takes aim and WHACK!  The cue ball misses everything. 
      Infeld enters.

                                  INFELD
                    I got a call from Maya Paxton.  She 
                    was very impressed by your candor 
                    this afternoon.  Me, not as much.  
                    Hello, Pindar.

                                  PINDAR
                    Good afternoon, sir.

                    We re not the Poverty Law Center, 
                    Jared.  We re in this to make a

                                  PETER
                    But I need him on the assault case--

                    Or Hanna.  Probably Hanna.

      Jared leaves -- presumably to go see Hanna.

                                  INFELD
                    Something I should know about those

                    Nanette.  Anyone remember how much 
                    Danny had to drink that night?

                                    NANETTE
                    We were at my place watching Ice 
                    Road Truckers and Danny dropped by 
                    after his run.  He was hot and 
                      glistening with sweat.  He helped 
                    himself to a beer and downed it 
                    fast.

                                  PINDAR 
                    You keep beer in your fridge?

                    I don t drink beer.  I keep a six 
                    pack there for Danny.  We all tend

                    How much did he have to drink?

                                    NANETTE
                    He was drinking the second beer 
                    when he got a call from his friend.  

                                  PINDAR
                    Is there any way to back up your 
                      recollection that Danny only had 
                    two beers?          FRANKLIN & BASH - Production Draft 2ND WHITE - 9/21/10       21.

                    I still have the four beers from 
                    the six pack in my fridge.  Would 
                    that help?

      Rick is surprised by this, looks at his wife in a new light.  
      Hanna and Karp notice the thaw.

                                  RICK
                    Fine, then Maya can have the cabin

                    I imagine the prosecution is going

                    like to blindfold Nanette to prove 
                    her recall.

                                  JUDGE WINTERS
                    Granted.  

      Peter finishes blindfolding Nanette.  Peter waves his hands 
      in front of her face.  No reaction.

24A24AEXT. INFELD/DANIELS - COURTYARD - DAY     

      Jared and Hanna walk with Carmen.

                                  HANNA
                    So, Allison was in love with Rick 
                    Paxton, but not Maya.  

                                  JARED
                    This is great for the home team.  

                                  CARMEN
                    Not so fast.  Allison was in love 
                    with Rick Paxton, but Paxton didn t 
                    love her.  In fact, they never had 
                    sex.  Well, they almost did, but 
                    didn t.  She wouldn t say why.

                                  HANNA
                    Wait.  When Maya confronted Rick 
                    about the affair with Allison, he 
                    basically admitted to it.  And now 
                    she says they didn t consummate?  
                    Why is Allison lying?  

                                  JARED
                    Maybe she s not.

                                  CARMEN
                    You think he is?

                                  HANNA
                    Paxton is admitting to an affair so 
                    he can lose eleven million dollars?

                                  JARED
                    He s a guy.  A guy s accused of 
                    cheating, his first instinct is to 
                    lie.  But Paxton s instinct was to 
                    admit it?   

                                  HANNA
                    Maybe he was being honest about 
                    what really happened when they were 
                    together. 
                          (loaded)
                    Instead of lying about it.

      nickel drops for Jared.          FRANKLIN & BASH - Production Draft 2ND WHITE - 9/21/10       31.

                    He s hiding something.  

                                  CARMEN
                    You getting a blip on the gaydar?  

                                  JARED
                    No, this guy s a notorious 
                      international womanizer.  Hell, he 
                    markets himself that way.  

                                  HANNA
                    Then, what?

                                  JARED
                    What do men lie about?

                                  CARMEN
                    Money.

                                  HANNA
                    Size and girth.

                    Okay, a little angry. 
                          (to Hanna)
                    You re in the right ballpark.  
                    As Rick Paxton can tell you, the 
                    size of the balloon doesn t matter 
                    if you can t get it off the ground.

                                  HANNA
                    Spare us the analogies.  We re big 
                    girls.

                                  JARED
                    He couldn t get an erection.  The 
                    blood did not flow to the penis.

      Hanna and Carmen consider that for a moment.

                                  HANNA 
                    If he s willing to pay off the pre-
                    nup to keep his private business 
                    private, how are we going to get 
                    him to admit it?

      Jared smiles a smile only Carmen would understand.  Jared 
      hurries off.          FRANKLIN & BASH - Production Draft 2ND WHITE - 9/21/10       32.

                    Okay.  Maybe the relevant time 
                    isn t when he drank, its whether 
                    the alcohol was fully in his system 
                    when he drove the golf cart. 

                                  PETER
                    Like it.  But the jury needs 
                    something they can sink their teeth 
                    into, not an anatomy lesson.  

                                  JARED 
                    On the subject of anatomy, I can 
                    win our case with Maya if I can 
                    just get some time alone with Rick 
                    Paxton. 

                                  PETER
                    To talk about what?

                                  JARED
                    Okay, seriously, you get one joke, 
                    because I really have to move on 
                    this.

                                  PETER

                    opposing party without his lawyer 
                    present.  

      Jared is surprised there s no joke.

                                  JARED
                    I want to invite Paxton to 
                    Margarita Monday at the cave.  
                    Where does it say it s against the 
                    law to invite someone to a party?  

                                  PETER
                    How about the California Attorney s 
                    Code of Professional Conduct?  

                                  JARED
                    I ve always looked at that as more 
                    of a guideline.  Seriously, that s 
                    it on  flaccid ?          FRANKLIN & BASH - Production Draft 2ND WHITE - 9/21/10       35.

                    Too easy.  

      Jared runs off.  Peter follows him into the hall.  

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    Don t talk to Paxton.  This is too 
                    big a risk.

                                  JARED
                    Which makes for a bigger reward!

      Paxton steps on the escalator just as Jared gets on, too.

                    You can t approach me without my

                                  JARED
                    We re just riding together.  I 
                    haven t said anything.
                          (after a beat)
                    Your architect said she never had 
                    sex with you.  You said you did.  
                    One of you is lying.  

                                  RICK
                    So much for just riding together.

                                  JARED
                    You want to tell me why or should 
                    we take this to court?

                    Well, it won t be you trying the

                    So, this is blackmail, too?

      INT. MAN CAVE - NIGHT3030

      Music s pumping, margaritas passed around as the party heats 
      up.  Jared and Peter wait nervously.  

                                  PETER
                    You crossed a line.

                                  JARED
                    We re Franklin and Bash.  We 
                    crossed the line ten exits back.

                                  PETER
                    This is an ethics violation that 
                    could put us out on our asses.  How 
                    can you be so calm?

                                  JARED
                    Because I know Paxton will come and 
                    I know I m right on this.

                                  PETER
                    You better be, Jared.

                                  JARED
                    You better be Peter.

      Peter walks off.  After he s gone, Jared pours another 
      tequila shot into his margarita.  He is worried.

                                  DEBBIE
                    He s just stressed out about 
                    Danny s trial.  

                                  JARED
                    It s not his fault.  He got stuck 
                    with a loser. 

      Jared turns, runs into Danny holding a bottled water.   

                                  JARED (CONT'D)
                    Oh.  Hey, Danny.

                    What d I do to you that makes you 
                    hate me?  Because I can t even 
                    remember.

      Jared walks away.  There s a knock at the door.  Jared opens 
      the door, hoping its Paxton: it s Nanette.  Pindar lights up. 

                                    NANETTE
                          (whispers)
                    Hi.  Carmen sent me.

                          (whispers back)
                    It s not a speak easy.  Come in.  

      She enters.  As he starts to shut the door, he looks out at 
      the yard.  Paxton, looking serious, is walking up.

                                  PAXTON
                    You got five minutes.  

      ACROSS THE ROOM

      Pindar sees Nanette.

                    Oh, look who flew in from London.

                    I didn t break any laws.

                    You look lovely.

                                    NANETTE
                          (softening)
                    It s funny: I feel like I know you 
                    and this is actually the first time 
                    I ve seen you, face to face.  I m 
                    sorry I didn t tell you the truth.   

                                  PINDAR
                    I guess whatever you did twelve 
                    years ago is your business.  

                                    NANETTE
                    Twelve years ago is when I was last 
                    arrested.  

      She walks past him...

                                  PINDAR
                    So you re... still... active?

      The party plays around them as Jared and Paxton approach the 
      hot tub.  TWO HOTTIES smile.

      They stand, water cascading off their shapely bodies.  Jared 
      and Rick sit near the water.

                    Is it always like this?  

                                  JARED
                    Sorry, school night.  You should 
                    see it on weekends. 

                                  RICK

                                  JARED
                    I know why you didn t have sex with 
                    Allison Myers.  

                                  RICK
                    What makes you think that I didn t?

                    Same thing happened to me a couple 
                    of weeks ago in this very house.

                    was go-time... I couldn t storm the

                    One thing for it to happen to me.

                    I don t know what you re talking

                                  JARED
                    That s why you wanted arbitration 
                    instead of a trial.  You d rather 
                    be guilty of infidelity and sweep 
                    it under the rug than let the world 
                    know that you might be impotent.

      Pindar, Carmen and the old people are watching something on 
      TV (we don t see what), cheering along with the action, most 
      of them drunk.  Peter is seated across the room, legal pad in

                    Cocoon drinking game.  Every time 
                    one of the retirees in the movie 
                    dives in the pool they have to do a

                    I don t think so.  I may have 
                    gotten through to Rick.

      They look at Danny on the couch, surrounded by Old People, 
      who are all laughing, having fun.

                    He s their designated driver 
                    tonight.  They re going to be lost 
                    without him if we lose this.

      Peter straightens, an idea forming.  He looks at the laughing 
      old people as they file past him outside.  One OLD GUY can be 
      seen doing a cannon ball in the HOT TUB.

                                  JARED
                    Maybe I ll help you win this for 
                    them.  Not so much Danny.

                                  PETER
                    Thanks.  And you can, buddy.  You 
                    can.  

      Peter smiles, pats his partner on the shoulder and we...

                                        ACT FIVE

      INT. COURTROOM - DAY (DAY FIVE)3232

      Peter examines Officer Nick Preston. 

                                  PETER
                    What time does the security camera 
                    show my client driving through the 
                    golf course, which is private 
                    property and the only thing he 
                    risked injuring were ducks?

                                  ELLEN
                    Not to interrupt Mr. Bash s 
                      editorial, but he also drove on 
                    Marina Blvd.

                                  PETER
                    He crossed Marina Blvd.  Thirty-
                    five feet at eight-miles-an-hour.  

                                    OFFICER PRESTON
                    The footage was taken at 10:41 p.m.

                                  PETER
                    And what time did you administer 
                    the blood alcohol test? 

      Peter glances at the jury -- they look bored.  Peter knows 
      he s losing them.  He looks at Jared.

                                    OFFICER PRESTON
                    11:10 p.m.  Five minutes after he 
                    punched me in the face.

                                  PETER
                    And a half-hour after he was 
                    driving.

      Jared stands up at the counsel table, picks up the 4-pack of 
      beer and immediately punctures the can with a pen and 
      shotguns it in one gulp.  

                                  ELLEN
                      Objection!!

                                  JUDGE WINTERS
                    Mr. Bash, would you care to tell me 
                    what you re doing before I hold you 
                    and your colleague in contempt?

      Jared pops the second beer and downs it as the judge 
      indicates toward the BAILIFF.           FRANKLIN & BASH - Production Draft 2ND WHITE - 9/21/10       43.


                                  JARED
                    Would it have killed you to chill 
                    these?

                                  PETER
                          (talking fast)
                    We re arguing how it takes time for 
                    alcohol to be absorbed into a 
                    person s body.  My partner is 
                      demonstrating it for the jury.  

                                  JUDGE WINTERS
                          (to Bailiff)
                    Take out your taser, Chuck.  If he 
                    takes another sip, hit him with 
                      everything you ve got.

      The Bailiff pulls out his TASER.  Jared looks to Peter: do I 
      have to?

                                  ELLEN
                    May we approach the bench with Penn 
                    and Teller?  

      The judge nods his assent.  Peter, Jared and Ellen approach.

                                  PETER
                    I d ask that Officer Preston be 
                    allowed to administer a field 
                    sobriety test to Mr. Franklin.    

                                  ELLEN
                    Your honor--

                                  PETER
                      Respectfully, your honor, I know 
                    you re new to the bench.  I d hate 
                    to see you overturned on appeal.  
                    Very embarrassing.  

      A long beat.  Judge Winters finally turns to Officer Preston.

                                  JUDGE WINTERS
                    Can you check to see if Mr. 
                    Franklin is drunk in addition to 
                    being insane?

      Peter picks up a packaged device from the table, hands it to 
      Preston.  OFF Jared taking a deep breath as he awaits Officer 
      Preston--

      INT. COURT ROOM - FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER32A32A

      Preston back on the stand.            FRANKLIN & BASH - Production Draft 2ND WHITE - 9/21/10       44.


                                  PETER
                    Officer Preston, fifteen minutes 
                    ago you gave Mr. Franklin a 
                    sobriety test that registered a 
                    result of .001.  Is that the legal 
                    limit?

                                    OFFICER PRESTON
                    Yes. 

                                  PETER 
                    Could you have Mr. Franklin blow 
                    into the device again?

      Officer Preston removes the small device from his front 
      pocket and approaches Jared.

                                    OFFICER PRESTON
                    Could you please blow, sir?

      Jared looks to Peter, so wanting to finish the joke, then 
      blows into it.

                                    OFFICER PRESTON (CONT D)
                          (reading)
                    Point zero-nine.  That s above the 
                    legal limit.  

                                  PETER
                    Does he appear under the influence?

                                    OFFICER PRESTON
                    Yes. 

                                  ELLEN
                          (sotto)
                      Lightweight.

                                  PETER
                    But he wasn t fifteen minutes ago.
                    Isn t it possible that Danny Dubois 
                    was sober when he drove the golf 
                    cart, but legally intoxicated when 
                    he was tested after the fight? 

      Danny reacts, surprised and not pleased at that offer.

                                    OFFICER PRESTON
                    It s possible he was under the 
                    limit when he was driving.   

      Peter gives a look to the jurors, sees that they re buying 
      it, throws a victorious look to Ellen.          FRANKLIN & BASH - Production Draft 2ND WHITE - 9/21/10       45.


                                  PETER
                    No further questions.

      INT. COURTHOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY3535

      Jared busts through the double doors, runs into Janie 
      standing there, arms folded, holding a take-out coffee cup.  

                                  JANIE
                    You finally figured out a way to  
                    get wasted in court. 

                                  JARED

                    marijuana in front of the Supreme 
                    Court.  So, who is he?

                    Who is who?

                    Jared.  Don t be so hostile.  You 
                    get custody of Peter.  You won.

                          (kidding; a little buzzed)
                    I ve listened to Peter talk about 
                    how beautiful you are.  I never saw 
                    it.  But seeing you today, standing 
                    there, even with beer goggles... I 
                    still don t get it.

                                  JANIE

      Jared stand in front of judge, jury and gallery.  He buttons 
      his jacket, unbuttons it.  Buttons it again.

                                  JARED
                    I ve got to admit: I m a little

                    But!  Was I buzzed fifteen minutes 
                    ago?  Yeah.  But fifteen minutes 
                    before that?  Sober as a cat. 

                                  JUDGE WINTERS

                    I ve known Double D since high 
                    school.  Back when he was class 
                      president, star lacrosse player, a 
                    guy who showered with cheerleaders, 
                    one of whom was my girlfriend.  

                                  ELLEN
                    Hard to blame her for that.

                    Who among us wouldn t be angry if 
                    someone showered with their 
                      girlfriend?  Judge Doogie?  I was 
                    still pissed when I took this case 
                    because I thought Danny was the 
                    same obnoxious dick who snaked my 
                    girl back in high school.

                                  JUDGE WINTERS
                    I m afraid not.  

                                  JARED
                    But I was wrong.  Because how could 
                    Danny DuBois be a loser if he liked 
                    taking care of his grandmother and 
                    her friends?  Or how could he be a 
                    dick when he tried to help rescue 
                    an ex-teammate in a bar fight?  I 
                    wouldn t call that person a loser 
                    or a dick... I would call that 
                    man... a friend.  

      Danny seems to appreciate this...

                                  JARED (CONT'D)
                    Danny was sober when he jumped in 
                    the golf cart, drove it through a 
                    golf course and across a city 
                    street.  Is it a bad idea and 
                    against the law, getting behind the 
                    wheel intoxicated?  Yes.  Always.  
                    But getting behind the wheel sober?  
                    No.     

      He throws a look to the gallery, turns back to stare at the 
      jury.  And stares.  Finally, Judge Winters intervenes.

                                  JUDGE WINTERS 
                    Mr. Franklin?  Are you done?

                                  JARED
                    God, I hope so.  

      INT. INFELD/DANIELS - RECEPTION - DAY3838

      Peter has cornered Maya.  

                                  MAYA
                    No.  It s too late.

                                  PETER
                    Divorcing Rick may turn out to be 
                    the right decision.  
                                  (MORE)          FRANKLIN & BASH - Production Draft 2ND WHITE - 9/21/10       50.

                                  PETER (CONT'D)
                    Or twenty years from now you ll 
                    regret it and wish you would have 
                    talked to him on this day.  Well, 
                    Maya, it s the year 2034 and here s 
                    your chance to step into a time 
                    warp... go back and find out.  

      Maya s teetering.  Peter opens the door and we see Rick 
      inside.  He stands, hopeful.  Maya walks in and Rick closes 
      the door.

      A furious Glenna Sproik enters on fire with Karp.  She finds 
      Peter blocking the door along with Hanna.

                                  GLENNA
                    Let me see my client. 

                                  PETER
                    No. 

                                  KARP
                    Where s your organ monkey?

                                  PETER
                    Jared s running late.

                                  GLENNA
                    When I find out what the two of you 
                    did, and trust me, I will, I m 
                    going to --  

                                  PETER
                    I know you re saying all kinds of 
                      threatening stuff.  But I m 
                    imagining you naked right now.

      Infeld arrives.  

                                  INFELD
                    Now what?

                                  GLENNA
                    He won t let me see my client, 
                    Stanton.

                                  HANNA
                    He won t let us see our client.

      Infeld moves past Peter and looks into--

      INT. INFELD/DANIELS - CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS3939

      Rick covers Maya s hand with his.           FRANKLIN & BASH - Production Draft 2ND WHITE - 9/21/10       51.


                                  RICK
                    ...After I couldn t perform with 
                    you, I panicked and thought I was 
                    bored with marriage sex and so I 
                    thought another woman might do the 
                    trick, but it didn t.  I kept 
                    trying to fix everything by myself--
                    no Viagra, no therapy-- 

                                  MAYA
                    Because you have to do everything 
                    solo.  Admit no weakness.

                                  RICK
                    Well, I am now.  
                          (takes her hand)
                    I ll rip up the pre-nup if you give 
                    me another chance--

                                  INFELD
                    Jump on it.  That s a great deal.

      Peter smiles, takes a picture.  

                                  PETER
                    This is a teaching moment for all 
                    of us. 

      INT. INFELD/DANIELS - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS4040

      Infeld closes the door to the conference room giving the 
      couple privacy.  Glenna storms off, starts dialing her phone.  
      Infeld looks at Hanna, Karp and Peter.

                                  INFELD
                    I m aware sex has broken out 
                    between some senior partners.  Do 
                    you know what happens when there s 
                    jealousy and sexual tension in the 
                    work place?

                                  HANNA
                    Loss of concentration. 

                                  KARP
                      Unprofessional conduct. 

      Peter watches Debbie cross...

                                  INFELD
                    Yes.  But I m thinking there s also 
                    healthy competition.  You cocks 
                    strut around trying to impress the 
                    hen.  More inspired work gets done.

                                  INFELD (CONT'D)
                    It s fantastic.  Peter, why don t 
                    you hook up with someone here?  
                          (motions across the way)
                    Derek s wife is lovely, make a run 
                    at her.

      Peter looks at a senior partner, backs up.

                                  PETER
                    Uh... I gotta get back to court.

      INT. COURTHOUSE - HALLWAY - FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER4141

      The doors open and Jared and Carmen enter the hallway, 
      jubilant.  Danny exits, walks up to Jared.  We don t know if 
      he s going to slug Jared or hug him.  

                                  DANNY
                    Nad, I don t know whether to say 
                    thank you or I m sorry.

                                  JARED
                    How about saying  Jared. 

      Danny takes Jared into his arms and hugs him tight.  

                                  DANNY
                    Jared, I never showered with your 
                    old girlfriend.  
                          (whispers)
                      I showered with Sara Armstrong.

      The oldsters, led by Grandma Mae, swarm Danny.  And that s 
      when Jared realizes...

                                  JARED
                    Peter s girlfriend?

      Danny says  Shhh , as Jared looks over at Peter approaching.

                                  PETER
                    You did it.  Amazing.

                                  JARED
                    I m gonna drink before every 
                    closing from now on.  Like Paul 
                    Newman in The Verdict.

                                  PETER
                          (to Jared)
                    You feeling okay, hermano?  Four 
                    beers in four minutes is a lot.          FRANKLIN & BASH - Production Draft 2ND WHITE - 9/21/10       53.


                                  JARED
                    No, it s four beers in four minutes 
                    plus a 12-inch Hoagie that s a lot.

                                  CARMEN
                    Uh-oh....

      Jared, Peter and Carmen step onto the elevator.  Just as the 
      elevator doors are about to eclipse Jared s face, he hurls a 
      rope of puke through the sliver of an opening.  Seconds later 
      the doors open and Carmen runs out with her hand covering her 
      mouth.  Jared is bent over, Peter pats his back. 

      INT. OMITTED4242

      INT. INFELD/DANIELS - RECEPTION - SAME TIME4343

      People stop what they re doing when they hear SINGING.  It s 
      Jared, SINGING with the karaoke machine near the elevator, 
      maybe still a little drunk.  Peter is here with his guitar, 
      half-playing, Debbie moving to the music.  

      Hanna appears from the conference room and moves toward 
      Jared.

                                  JARED
                    Thank you, thank you.  Requests?  

                                  HANNA
                    I want to talk to you regarding the 
                    rumors going around about us. 

                                  DEBBIE
                    That plant needs water.

                                  PETER
                    Later.

      Debbie and Peter leave.

                                  JARED
                    Okay.  My office or yours?

      That went out over the mike.  Jared shuts it off.

                                  HANNA
                    Here s fine.  You re telling 
                    everyone that we didn t have sex.  

                                  JARED
                    I got your back.            FRANKLIN & BASH - Production Draft 2ND WHITE - 9/21/10       54.


                                  HANNA 
                    This isn t the Monday after prom, 
                    Jared.  Okay?  I don t care what 
                    people think.  Ever.  And if they 
                    find out the truth, that we had 
                    crazy headboard banging sex, that I 
                    had seventeen orgasms that made me 
                    see flying unicorns, that s fine 
                    with me.  Because I m a big girl, 
                    I m responsible for everything I 
                    do, whether it s in the courtroom 
                    or the bedroom.  

      He just stares at her.  Impressed.   

                                  HANNA (CONT D)
                    The song was sweet.  But stick to 
                    the day job.  

      She turns, walks away.  Jared presses the button to the 
      elevator.

                                  JARED
                    Hanna, if I rang your bell 
                    seventeen times...you re welcome.  

      Hanna processes the merits of this, then turns, watches Jared 
      get in the elevator, as the doors close on his smile, and 
      we...
