                    Three... Two... One... Launch. 

      A SMALL DRONE LAUNCHES from beneath the Raptor's wing and blazes out into space. 


      Showing the view over the bow as the ship makes a TURN.

                      Starbuck/Galactica.  Three enemy contacts identified as 
                    fighters now bearing 220-015.  Speed 7 decimal 4... 


      There are (old) VIPERS visible to either side as Kara leads the group out to engage the fighters.

                    Range 705 and closing. 


      The Viper AFTERBURNERS kick in and they BLAZE away from us. 


    Up ahead, THREE balls of LIGHT begin to resolve themselves into CYLON FIGHTERS. 

                                  KARA (WIRELESS) 
                    Here they come... ready... BREAK. 

                                                                        MULTI-SCREEN: 


      The formation BREAKS APART into PAIRS and OPEN FIRE. 


      The Cylons are forced to break their own formation to dodge the FIRE from the Vipers. 


      The starfield behind Kara's canopy is filled with twisting, turning, firing Vipers. 


      The Cylon ship firing, twisting, turning. 

      We start ROTATING MORE SCREENS IN, moving OTHERS OUT, constantly changing our 
      perspective from interior to exterior, Cylon to Viper, and our impression of combat is more like the 
      real thing -- fast paced, confusing, hard to tell friend from foe and happening all at once: 

      1 -- Two Vipers firing furiously. 

      2 -- A Cylon twists and turns. 

      4 -- Kara's head whipping around in her cockpit. 

      6 -- A Cylon fires. 

      1 -- A Viper is damaged.       2 -- A Cylon makes an impossibly tight turn, fires. 

      1 -- A Viper skids sideways to avoid Cylon fire. 

      3 -- Kara straining against g-forces in a tight turn. 

      1 -- A Viper EXPLODES. 

      5 -- A Viper Pilot struggles to escape a Cylon. 

      4 --  Kara DESTROYS a Cylon. 

      1 -- Four Vipers swarm around a single Cylon fighter, in a blur of motion too quick to follow, then the 
      Cylon EXPLODES. 


      The Cylon is matching the Viper move for move -- then suddenly it breaks off the chase. 

                                  PILOT #1 (WIRELESS) 
                    Wait-wait-wait -- he's broken off.  Frak!  He's heading 
                    toward Galactica! 

                                                                  COLLAPSE SCREENS 
                                                                                    TO: 


      The Cylon is heading right for the still distant Galactica. 


    As the Viper swings around toward the Cylon missile and the defenseless Galactica. 

                                  KARA (WIRELESS) 
                      Galactica/Starbuck -- one got through, repeat one got 
                    through!  We're kicking in the burners but watch yourself! 


      From a camera on Galactica's hull, we see the Cylon heading straight toward us -- head-on. 


      A reciprocal view from a camera mounted on the Cylon fighter, we see the Galactica rushing 
      straight toward us. 

      1 -- Adama picks up a HANDSET.  Everyone is tense, quiet.  Gaeta watches the Dradis tactical 
      screen. 

                                  ADAMA

                    Range 310... 300... 290... 280... 

 
      2 -- Kara and her Vipers swing around and pull away from Galactica.  [Drop this split now.] 
 
    3 & 4 -- The ships get closer together. 
 
      1 -- Gaeta keeps watching the screen, everyone tenses, wondering what Adama will do. 

                                  ADAMA 
                    Standby, Helm... 

                                  GAETA 
                    250... 240... 230...

                    Helm, top bow, bottom stern emergency full. 

      The Helmsmen WORK the controls and it all happens very fast: 


      The giant ship FLIPS END FOR END. 

    3 & 4 -- The maneuver from Galactica and the Cylon POV. 

      6 -- CYLON UNDERBELLY - WING CAMERA POV 

      The bomb bay doors OPEN as before, and FIVE nuclear-tipped MISSILES drop down. 

      1 -- Adama is watching the gauges. 

                                  ADAMA 
                          (to phone) 
                    Main fuel dump -- execute.     4 & 5 -- We see A CLOUD OF FUEL pour out of Galactica's stern VENTS. 

      1 -- Adama turns back to the Helmsman. 

                                  ADAMA (cont'd) 
                    Right stern thruster -- one burst. 

      One of the Helmsmen hits a button -- 

    4, 5, 6 -- The nuclear missiles are just heading out of the bomb bay when a SINGLE BURST of 
      ENERGY shoots out from the right stern thruster of Galactica and IGNITES the entire CLOUD of 
      FUEL.  There's no time for the Cylon fighter to react and it's IMMOLATED along with the missiles.  
      [Drop 4 & 6 splits.] 


      The Vipers can see the explosion from a safe distance away. 


      The ship hangs in space. 

                                  ADAMA 
                          (prelap) 
                    One more time around the horn, Colonel. 


      The ship JUMPS -- which we see not as the ship leaping forward or stretching out at superspeed, 
    but rather as the Galactica suddenly FOLDING IN ON ITSELF like a enormous piece of origami and 
      then disappearing. 


      The Galactica APPEARS via an UNFOLDING effect above the GAS GIANT planet of Ragnar.  Amid 
    the swirling bands of CLOUDS that define the atmosphere, there is one STORM FORMATION that 
      should remind us of the "Red Eye" of Jupiter. 


      Galactica is heading straight down into the very eye of the storm, making periodic adjustments from 
      side to side and "up and down" as she navigates the course. 

                                                                          DISSOLVE TO: 


      The ship PIVOTS and turns as the thrusters kick in. 

                                                                          DISSOLVE TO: 


      The ship TURNS again, is BUFFETED by the swirling WINDS. 

                                                                          DISSOLVE TO: 


      The ship is approaching the distant STATION down in the very heart of the storm. 

                                                                          DISSOLVE TO: 


      END MONTAGE.  Here in the heart of the storm, Galactica maneuvers alongside the enormous 
      STATION which dwarfs the ship by comparison.  Far in the b.g, the swirling winds of the STORM 
      whirl around ship and station -- like being in the center of a hurricane, but on a much bigger scale.  
      From our vantage (chase camera) Galactica is pointing straight "down" toward the (unseen) planet 
      surface as she comes alongside the station. 

      The station itself consists of FOUR ROTATING "RINGS", each of which is connected to the same 
      central "AXEL HUB" by a series of "SPOKES."  (Imagine four spinning bicycle tires mounted on a 
      single metal rod.)  Galactica is maneuvering alongside the first "wheel" and matching her speed to 
    the wheel's rotation.  In terms of scale, if the Ring is a bicycle tire, then Galactica is the size of a 
      baseball card. 

      GALACTICA - RING CAMERA POV 

      From a camera mounted on the top of the Ring, we watch Galactica edge closer and closer to the 
      docking point. 

      TERMINAL AIRLOCK - GALACTICA CAMERA POV 

      The reverse angle as seen from a camera atop Galactia, looking at the approaching Ring airlock.  
      The two come closer... closer... then DOCK. 


      The Refinery Ship looks like a collection of enormous BALLOONS filled with LIQUID FUEL, all of 
      which are connected to a small central habitation hub. 

                                  VOICE (WIRELESS) 
                    This is the Refinery Vessel Tauranian to any Colonial 
                    ship.  Anyone out there?  Come on, somebody answer 
                    me... 

      Suddenly Sharon's Raptor JUMPS into the area in the same UNFOLDING EFFECT seen during 
      Galactica's earlier Jump. 

                                  SHARON (WIRELESS) 
                    Taurnanian this is Colonial Raptor 238. 


      A SMALL FLEET is gathering.  Colonial vessels of every shape and size, from freighters to luxury 
      liners are here.  Even a few (new) VIPERS are in evidence, cruising through the area, guarding the 
      fugitive fleet.   

      The familiar Transport ship is DOCKING with a PASSENGER LINER. 


      Galactica is REDOCKING herself at the second airlock, while Leoben's ship is floating idly nearby. 


      Both ships UNFOLD in the vicinity of the survivor fleet. 

                                  SHARON (WIRELESS) 
                    Colonial One/Raptor 238.  I'm back and I've brought a 
                    friend. 


      The Drone does a quick fly-by of the survivor fleet then FOLDS on itself as it JUMPS away. 


      Exteriors of the survivor fleet. 


      CYLON FIGHTERS UNFOLD and head in toward the survivor fleet. 

      5 -- Lee never wavers. 

                                  LEE 
                    Three... 

                                  WIRELESS VOICE #1 
                    Oh my God... our Dradis is picking up inbound targets 
                    heading this way! 

      1 -- Laura takes an involuntary intake of breath. 

                                  LEE 
                    Two... 

                                  WIRELESS VOICE #2 
                    I see them!  Are they Colonials? 

      2 -- Cami all alone under the tree rocking back and forth. 

      5 -- They're about to Jump. 

                                  LEE 
                    One... 

                                  WIRELESS VOICE #1 
                    They're Cylon. 

                                  LEE 
                    Mark. 

                                  WIRELESS VOICE #2 
                    I hope you people rot in hell for this... 

      4 -- The FTL-capable ships JUMP, leaving behind about a quarter of the survivors. 

                                                                  COLLAPSE SCREENS

      1 -- Laura's face, knowing what is about to happen. 

      6 -- The Cylon fighters LAUNCHING their NUKES toward the remaining ships. 

      2 -- Cami rocking back and forth. 

                                                                            WHITE OUT. 


                                    END OF ACT FOUR 
                                        ACT FIVE       FADE IN: 


      Emphasizing the point where one of the long "spokes" connects to the central hub or "axel." 


    Is carefully winding its way through the STORM CLOUDS up toward open space. 

                                  DUALLA (WIRELESS) 
                          (fritzed) 
                      Starbuck/Galactica.  You should be approaching turn 
                    eight. 


      The fighter BANKS and turns against the dizzying background of the storm. 

      OVERHEAD COCKPIT POV 

      Looking ahead, we can see OPEN SPACE looming before us as the Viper completes its turn.                                   KARA (WIRELESS) 
                      Galactica/Starbuck.  I've reached the threshold. 


      The Viper clears the storm. 

                                                                        MULTI-SCREEN: 



      Galactica still docked at the station.

                    You can't do this! 


    As the ship moves to the threshold of the storm. 


      The Cylons waiting for them. 


      A mixture of old and new Vipers flying out in front of Galactica. 


      Following Galactica. 


    As the ship UNFOLDS in space.  The rest of the civilian ships are floating peacefully nearby. 

      They're safe. 


      Our chase camera tracks across the familiar lines of Galactica and then across the motley 
      assembly of civilian vessels trailing in her wake. 

                                  LAURA (V.O.) 
                    We have ships with schools... 


      The chase plane has reached the end of the fleet and now the invisible camera operator turns his 
      hand-held camera back to see the fleet receding in the distance. 

                                  LAURA (V.O.) 
                    All that's left of our civilization is inside these fragile 
                    containers. 


      Which is now surrounded by Cylon ships.
