      Carrie emerges into a back alley, tosses the gun in a 
      dumpster, races down toward a busy street.  She finds a taxi 
      letting someone off at the club and hops in.


      ...daylight sweeps across Carrie's cab.  The car's hood, 
      roof, windows, doors are torn away as if by a tornado...grass 
      springs up and carpets the Brooklyn asphalt...the old 
      warehouses lining Conover Street collapse into lush stands of 
      Norway maples and honey locusts.  We're outside a two-story 
      brick school building in Syracuse NY.  It's October 14th, 
      1983, 8:21 a.m.  A passing Sanitation Truck's blares the 
      Eurythmics.  We rocket from the cab of the truck through an 
      open window...                                                                                      6.



      ...and the memory-tornado tears away 1990.  We're in an alley 
      in 1997 Near West Side Syracuse.  A BOOMBOX is BLASTING 
      2Pac's Toss It Up.  Carrie, now 23, is in full police blues, 
      her Glock 22 trained on a huge Man in who lies at her feet.  

                                  CARRIE
                    I said BEHIND your head!  NOW!  


      ...PLINKS softly from Carrie s battered yellow Sony Sport CD 
      player...July 21, 1996, 2:05 P.M...Green Lake State 
        Park...while she lounges in a beach chair...fingers trailing 
      in the hot sand...a MAN's hands massaging her shoulders.  We 
      can't see his face, but his voice is low and deep:                                                                                       7.


                                  MAN (O.S.)
                    You have a nice neck.

                                  CARRIE
                    So I ve been told.

                                  MAN (O.S.)
                    Did you know there's a nerve right 
                    under your levator scapula that 
                    leads all the way down to the 
                    pelvic floor?

                                  CARRIE
                          (chuckle)
                    Given the circumstances, I think 
                    that's the dirtiest thing I've ever 
                    heard.

      The man LAUGHS.


      Carrie slides from the cab, starts down the street.  She 
      hears something - a Couple exiting the late night GREEK DELI 
      across the street...LAUGHING, arm in arm...

      TIGHT ON: Carrie.  Their easy companionship s a far cry from 
      her own life.  

      She turns and enters her building.


      Struggling poplars lit by bare bulbs cast shadows across the 
      entrance courtyard.  A dozen steps from Carrie, a WOMAN is 
      lying face down in her own shadow...which seems to grow 
      ominously beneath her...  

      Carrie runs to her, kneels.  The woman's been stabbed 
      repeatedly.  There's blood everywhere.  Carrie reaches to 
      check for a pulse.  As she does, in a FLASH she sees...


      ...a YOUNG GIRL, maybe 12, standing at the edge of a DARK 
      FOREST, hands planted firmly on hips, a disapproving smirk on 
      her face:  

                                  YOUNG GIRL
                    Carrie, will you come on, there s 
                    no bears in the woods...!


      Carrie recoils, GASPS.  Gasps again when she realizes 
      someone's standing beside her... 

      It's a MAN, 60's, in a flannel bathrobe.  A neighbor.  
      Staring at the woman's body in horror.

                                  CARRIE
                          (collecting herself)
                    Call the police.

                                          END TEASER                                                                                      9.


                                            ACT ONE


      Police cars, lights flashing, parked in front.  Uniforms have 
      taped off the courtyard area.  CSI folk photographing and 
      collecting.  Neighbors and lookiloos milling around.  Carrie 
      is finishing up an interview with a young Detective outside 
      the door of her building. 

                                  CARRIE
                    A few of the neighbors had come 
                    down too by then.  I think one of 
                    them called the police.

                                  DETECTIVE
                    And this was at what time?

                                  CARRIE
                    I m not a hundred percent sure, I 
                    think I...

      Carrie s eyes widen as she notices...

      ...NYPD Detective First Class AL BURNS, late 30s, emerge from 
      a sedan and stride across the courtyard.  He still moves like 
      the high school jock he was back in Syracuse.  He's always 
      going forward, life is to be lived, not dwelled upon.

                                  CARRIE (CONT D)
                          (flustered)
                    Sorry, I, uh...

      She subtly shifts her position so she is blocked by the 
      detective.

                                  CARRIE (CONT D)
                    ...I only looked at my watch later.  
                    Probably around three thirty...

      Across the courtyard, Al s met and filled in by Detective 
      MIKE COSTELLO, late 30s, Yonkers to Queens by way of the 3rd 
      Marines, Desert Storm.

                                  MIKE
                    Got a Catherine Grant, early 30 s 
                      Caucasian.  Looks to be a stabbing. 
                    According to the building manager, 
                    she s been a tenant three months.  
                    She paid her rent pretty regular, 
                     nice quiet girl.   His words.

                                  AL
                      Witnesses?                                                                                    10.


                                  MIKE
                    Nada.  Most the other tenants 
                    asleep, lady downstairs heard some 
                    kinda fight, came out, found the 
                    body.  Roe s finishing up with her 
                    now.

      He nods to where Carrie is being interviewed by the man we 
      now know to be Detective Second Class ROE SAUNDERS, mid 20s, 
      the junior member of our squad.  Al glances over, but

      AL S POV: Roe is blocking Carrie.

                                  AL
                    Weapon?

                                  MIKE
                    Uniforms looking.  Nothing so far.

      CARRIE AND ROE

      Carrie s eager to finish.

                                  CARRIE
                    That s really all I know.

                                  ROE
                    Thanks.  I m gonna give you my 
                    card.  Call if you think of 
                    anything else.

      Carrie takes the card and heads quickly back into the 
      building.  Roe moves over to Al and Mike.

                                  AL
                    Sorry to get you up so early.

                                  ROE
                    Always here for you, boss.

      They head into the building.


      Carrie's inside, just on the other side of the door.  She's 
      really hoping he doesn't knock - or maybe, that he does.   
      The RAP of Al's knuckles sets off an involuntary memory...


      Al's second quiet KNOCK takes Carrie out of her memory.  She 
      opens the door.  

                                  CARRIE
                    You don t have to break it down.  I 
                    heard you.  

                                  AL
                    Nice to see you too.  

      They stare at each other.  Al and Carrie were always the two 
      smartest kids on the block, and the ribbing, the one-upping, 
      the flirting, were as natural as breathing.  They still are.

                                  AL (CONT D)
                    May I enter?

                                  CARRIE
                    Depends.  You have probable cause?                                                                                    16.


                                  AL
                    What the hell are you doing here?

                                  CARRIE
                    I live here.  What are you doing 
                    here?

                                  AL
                      Investigating a murder.  We look 
                    around, ask questions, you remember 
                    how that works...   

                                  CARRIE
                    I mean, what are you doing in New 
                    York?  

                                  AL
                          (shrugs)
                    Tryin  to move up in the world. 

                                  CARRIE
                    You were always driven, Al.

                                  AL
                    Look who s talkin .

                                  CARRIE
                    Oh I gave that up.

      Al glances around at the bare walls.

                                  AL
                    I can tell. 

                                  CARRIE
                    So, married?  With children?

                                  AL
                      Girlfriend.

                                  CARRIE
                    Not Linda Perini.

                                  AL
                    C mon, that was never anything...

                                  CARRIE
                    Enough to end a relationship.

                                   AL
                    That s not why it ended.                                                                                    17.


                                  CARRIE
                    No, it s because I m a freak.  
                          (off Al)
                    Don t look at me, you said it.

                                  AL
                      What...when?.

                                  CARRIE
                    Lemme see.  August 14th, 1998...

                                  AL
                    I never said that...

                                  CARRIE
                    Around two thirty...four.  Hot 
                    night, no rain.  There were 
                      crickets...? 

                                  AL
                    Okay, okay, I didn t mean it.  I 
                    was angry, I was frustrated, I 
                    was...

                                  CARRIE
                      Insensitive?  And I m too 
                      sensitive.  Ta-dah.  

      Sounds about right.  Truce.  

                                  AL
                    Look, can you help me here?  
                    Catherine Grant?  216.  

                                  CARRIE
                    Like I told freshface, I heard the 
                    fight, went outside, found the 
                    body.  Checked her vitals, made 
                    sure someone phoned it in.  That s 
                    it.  

      He nods, fishes in his pocket.  

                                  AL
                    Okay.  My card.  Work number.

                                  CARRIE
                    Oh, please.   

                                  AL
                    Call me if you think of anything.

                                  CARRIE
                    Why else would I call?                                                                                      18.


      He turns to go.

                                  CARRIE (CONT D)
                    Apology accepted, by the way.

      He goes.  She slumps against the wall.  What the hell's going 
      on?  First the murder, then the memory in the woods - my God, 
      that memory - then Al.  Start of a perfect day. 


      A carpet of twigs and fallen leaves rolls down the dayroom 
      floor, the ceiling drywall peels back revealing a soaring 
      canopy of trees...broken sunlight lances through high 
      branches...the CAMERA REVERSES and where Carrie was sitting, 
      a red-faced GIRL of eight - young Carrie - now stands.  She's 
      breathing hard, terrified, searching.   

                                  YOUNG CARRIE
                          (crying out)
                      Rachel...RACHEL!!  Where are you?  
                    Rachel, PLEASE...!


      The team are in the courtyard, waiting, when Al and Carrie 
      pull up in Al's car.  Carrie approaches the spot where the 
      young woman died.  Her eyes take on a peculiar intensity.

                                  NINA
                          (quietly, to Roe)
                    Aren t we supposed to hold hands, 
                    or something?

                                  ROE
                    If there s chanting, I m so out.

      Al glares at them.  Carrie's looking hard, remembering...


      Night swallows day.  Naked bulbs burn in the courtyard.  

      Carrie is kneeling by the still warm body of Catherine Grant.  
      She stands.  But the Carrie that's part of the memory, 
      remains kneeling...dressed in a pair of baggy pajamas... 

      This is the first time we've seen Carrie choosing to relive a 
      memory in order to study it.  When she deliberately re-enters 
      a memory, Carrie's able to stand outside of herself.  To be a 
      witness of her earlier self.  

      But the virtual world that springs to life around her is 
      limited to what Carrie saw when the memory was formed.                                                                                      25.


      What she didn't see, isn't there.  It s like a photo splashed 
      on a digital canvas.  What isn t photo, is blank.

      What Carrie heard that night forms its own aural canvas.  The 
      singsong CHIRRUP of a night bird, a far-off DOG BARK, the 
      doppler whine of a passing FIRE ENGINE. 

      Carrie walks around.  What did she miss that she can see now?  
      She notices the spidery shadow of trees crisscrossing the 
      courtyard.  The thicker shadow of a dilapidated cement 
      fountain.  And something else, emerging from the shadow of 
      the fountain - an irregular shadow with no apparent source...

      Carrie watches her memory self - memory-Carrie - beside 
      Catherine's body.  Everything moves a little slowly as in a 
      dream.  Memory-Carrie glances toward the fountain, then back 
      to the body.  The neighbor in his robe approaches from the 
      entrance.  When he's beside the body, memory-Carrie gasps, 
      turns to him.  

      Carrie looks back at the irregular shadow.  It's gone.  
      Someone - the killer - was hiding behind the fountain.


      Carrie rises, moves swiftly to the fountain.  

                                  CARRIE
                    Someone was here.  Someone was 
                    hiding here.

      She runs her hands over crumbling cement vines, into the leaf-
      choked basin.  She reaches deep into a rusty drainpipe.  Very 
      deep.  Now she s touching something, trying to get a grip... 

                                  ROE
                          (quietly to Nina)
                    If it s a Derek Jeter rookie card, 
                    it s mine.

      Carrie pulls out a CHEF S KNIFE, stained brown with blood. 

      The team stare at one another.  You don't see that every day.

                                        END ACT ONE                                                                                    26.


                                            ACT TWO


      Mike threads his way through a fleet of bright orange trucks 
      with large-and-in-charge young boss KEN HARBERT, late 20s. 
      Ken s assistant, JILL, walks alongside.

                                  KEN
                          (into cell)
                    No, you can do more, but I m not 
                    gonna insure it.  Look, take the 
                      twenty-two.
                          (holds up a  one second  
                            hand to Mike)
                    Four tons, you do it all, one trip.                                                                                      29.


      He hands the cell to Jill, covers the speaker.

                                  KEN (CONT D)
                      One-twenty-nine, nothing lower.

      Jill peels off, as Ken continues with Mike, who hands him the 
      photo on Catherine s driver s license.

                                  KEN (CONT D)
                    I m sorry.  Yeah, I remember this 
                    one.  She temped for a while when 
                    Lourdes left to take care of her 
                    mom.

                                  MIKE
                    When was this?

                                  KEN
                    I don t know, few months ago.  My 
                    girl could give you the dates.

                                  MIKE
                    Do you remember, she have any 
                    problems with any of the other 
                      employees?

                                  KEN
                    Not that I know of. 

                                  MIKE
                    How long was she here?

                                  KEN
                    Week or so.  To be honest, I don t 
                    remember.  Only reason I remember 
                    her at all is, she rented a truck.  
                    Well, a van, for a coupla days.  We 
                    gave her a good deal.  

                                  MIKE
                    She say why she wanted the van?

                                  KEN
                    Yeah, actually.  Something about 
                    moving out on a boyfriend.  She 
                    seemed in a hurry.

      Boyfriend?


      ...strong hands rubbing her shoulders at the beach at Green 
      Lake.  As we now learn, they belong to Al.  And the massage, 
      the banter that afternoon, were the prelude to this moment.  
      Their first love-making.  Alone on an empty beach.  When 
      Carrie thought she, even she, could be in love...


      Al and Carrie with Mike on Park Avenue in the low 80 s.

                                  MIKE
                    So, according to Catherine Grant s 
                    phone records, she made a lotta 
                    calls to a disposable cell phone 
                    over the past three months.  These 
                    end abruptly two and a half weeks 
                    ago.  Then we have a bunch of one-
                    minute calls to a Steven Latman, 
                      successful lawyer, who, it so 
                    happens, is about to get married.

                                  CARRIE
                    They were having an affair.

                                  MIKE
                    S what I m thinkin .  Disposable 
                    phone, very discreet, guy decides 
                    to call it off, our girl goes 
                      ballistic, calls him repeatedly at 
                    his home, he ignores her.                                                                                    42.


                                  AL
                          (not sold)
                    Okay.  But it s a little light, no?

                                  MIKE
                    This add some weight?  One of the 
                    places Catherine temp d last year 
                    was the Manhattan Athletic Club, 
                    where Mr. Steven Latman is a member 
                    in good standing.

                                  AL
                    Nice.  Where s this guy live?

                                  MIKE
                    You re soaking in it.

      He points up to the building they're standing in front of.  
      Carrie smiles.  She likes Mike.

                                  LATMAN (O.S.)
                    Look I appreciate you people are 
                    just doing your job...


      CAMERA REVERSES...a little girl, Carrie at eight years old, 
      is slowly lowering her hands from her tear-stained 
      face...daring herself to look down...at the broken body lying 
      in the underbrush...the face she knows so well...turning dark 
      in death...the face of her older sister, Rachel...


      Carrie walks home, unease tugging at her.  What doesn t feel 
      right about Harbert?  The speed of those pursuing footsteps?  
      The quick confession?  But what about his fingerprints in 
      Catherine Grant s apartment, his DNA...?

      She passes her local GREEK DELI as two young Hipsters exit 
      playfully fighting over a bag of fresh bread.  Carrie glances 
      at them, then - FLASH - 


      The Couple from the night of the murder LAUGH as they exit 
      the same Greek deli...Carrie, in her tiny black dress, 
        contemplates them from across the street...


      TIGHT ON Carrie.  She was on this street only hours before 
      Catherine was stabbed to death.  Was there something here, 
      something not important then...but now...?

      Carrie focuses all her attention...digging into her 
        memory...deliberately summoning the past...


      The streetlights shift subtly and she sees a familiar yellow 
      CAB pull up in front of her building.                                                                                      61.


      Sees herself - memory-Carrie - sliding from the cab.  Right 
      on cue, a LAUGH is heard, and memory-Carrie glances in the 
      direction of the Couple exiting the Greek deli...who, like 
      the deli itself and a swathe of the adjoining buildings, 
      bloom into being as memory-Carrie s gaze falls upon them...

      Time seems to slow to a crawl - SOUNDS become heightened and 
      distinct - as Carrie follows memory-Carrie s line of sight to 
      a wall...

      BESIDE THE DELI

      ...where a dark Figure nurses a cigarette in the shadows.  
      Carrie s focus moves in.  She can t make out the man s face.  
      Then he leans forward into the light.  No luck.  It s a 
      Counter Man from the deli, white apron around his waist, out 
      sneaking a puff.

      Carrie turns her attention to the PLATE-GLASS WINDOW of the 
      deli.  Behind it, a few late-night Customers are seated at a 
      narrow counter.

      Carrie focuses more closely, moving slowly over the 
      customers: a Punjabi Sikh Cab Driver, in full pagri, stirring 
      his tea...a Goth Teen Couple, tearing at a dripping 
      hero...and at the end of the counter, another Man, in a 
      hoodie, hunched over a steaming coffee.  His heavy shoulders 
      look familiar, but his face is hidden.  Carrie waits, and 
      then, slowly, the man lifts three sugar packets together, 
      tears them with his teeth...

      Carrie s eyes widen...FLASH!


      The man in the hoodie finishes bite-tearing the sugar, dumps 
      them into his coffee and finally starts to look up...

      PUSH IN ON Carrie, her eyes on fire.

      The man s face comes into view.

      It s Ken Harbert.  


      Carrie goes into action.  Grabs her cell, punches buttons.

      INTERCUT WITH:  Henry, the lab tech, at his station.                                                                                    62.


                                  CARRIE
                          (into phone)
                    Henry, it s Carrie Wells. Listen, 
                    exactly what DNA test did we run on 
                    Frank Harbert?

                                  HENRY
                    You wanted it yesterday, so we did 
                      a quickie, just a Y chrome.  

                                  CARRIE
                    Can you run a full STR, PCR, 
                    whatever you got.  

                                  HENRY
                    Sure, what s goin  on?

                                  CARRIE
                    Just do it, will ya?  Thanks.

      She hangs up.  Punches in another number.


      Carrie gets Al s voice mail. 

                                  CARRIE
                          (into phone)
                    Al, it s me.  Meet me at Harbor 
                    Trucking.  It s eight now, I ll be 
                    there in twenty minutes.

      She hangs up.


      The lights are still on.  Carrie, in the parking lot, moves 
      closer, stares through a window into a large STORAGE AREA.

      CARRIE S POV: Inside, there are stacks of boxes of all sizes, 
      some as big as refrigerators.  A Man sorts through the towers 
      of packing material, CURSING as he throws a bale of boxes 
      onto a growing stack.

      Ken Harbert.

      REVERSE ON: Carrie.  She heads inside.

                                        END ACT THREE                                                                                    63.


                                          ACT FOUR


      ...into the darkness of the truck parking lot.  

                                  CARRIE
                    Ken, you can t run, there s no 
                    where to go.

      Ken leaps out from behind a truck with a lethal crowbar.          
      He swings at Carrie, who dodges back, falling against the  
      cab of the truck.  But Carrie was a cop.  When Ken comes for 
      her again, she quickly sweeps his leg, knocking him off 
      balance.  She reaches for a control hold, but Ken has eighty 
      pounds on her.  He rolls her off, and in moment has her 
      pinned to the floor.

                                  KEN
                    You shouldn t have come alone.

      A HUGE PISTOL is pressed against Ken s skull.  It s Al.

                                  AL
                    She didn t.

      Ken releases Carrie.  Al grabs him roughly, cuffs him.  
      Carrie s shaken, but...

                                  CARRIE
                    You took your time.

                                  AL
                    Woulda been sooner but...
                          (he lifts his cell)
                    ...had it on vibrate.                                                                                    66.


                                  CARRIE
                    Given the circumstances, I think...

                                  AL
                    ...that s the dirtiest thing you 
                    ever heard?

      An echo of Green Lake, long ago.  Carrie looks at Al, shocked 
      that he remembers.  Al smiles.  


      Green Lake.  Al running butt naked into the water.  He flings 
      himself back into the surf.  Happy to be alive, and in love.  

                                  AL
                    Come on in, it s unbelievable!  

      REVERSE on a younger, smiling Carrie, clutching the remnant 
      of her bikini top to her breasts.  

                                  AL (CONT D)
                    Come on, Carrie...!

      Carrie takes a step, hesitates, looks down.  The water laps 
      at her feet...                                                                                    69.



      ON: Carrie.  She can still feel the sun on her face.  

      CAMERA REVERSES.  Al's gone. 

      PUSH IN ON: Carrie.   A flicker of a smile...  


      Catherine's funeral, at a little cemetery on Long Island. 
      It's a lovely spot, quiet, surrounded by trees.  Our team are 
      there.  Wendy Wilson, in dark glasses.  George the boyfriend.  

      They found a Russian PRIEST to say the prayers.  He chants 
      words of peace in Old Slavonic.  

      Suddenly Carrie is there.  She approaches the gathering, then 
      stops.   She nods to Wendy.  

      Al catches her eye.  The rest of the team are looking at her 
      too, waiting.  

      Then, like a high diver, who after a final squaring and 
      settling leaps into space, Carrie moves to them and takes her 
      place with the team.  Despite the sadness of the occasion, 
      they share a few brief smiles.  

      The mourners are tossing flowers into the grave.  As Carrie 
      fingers the WHITE FLOWER in her hand, she looks to the woods.  
      And shudders...because the woods seem to rush toward her...


      ...in an instant, she's eight again...plunged in forest 
        gloom...bending over Rachel's body...brushing the hair from 
      her dead sister's face...whispering her name over and over 
      again...a SOUND...the CRACKLING of twigs...just beside 
      her...TIGHT ON young Carrie's face...she turns slowly, 
      slowly...to face the towering figure of a MAN...so heavily 
      backlit, he seems more silhouette than solid...we can't see 
      his features...but - can the little girl...??


      TIGHT ON: Carrie.  Remembering.

      BLACKOUT

      END
