      INT. SYRIAN FOREIGN MINISTRY. OFFICE - DAY11

      Title: Foreign Ministry, Damascus, Syria

      Foreign Minister RIYAD BARZALI: 50s, greying, glasses, very 
      old world, probably sports a mustache -- is at the door of 
      his office, bidding farewell to BRITISH AMBASSADOR WRIGHT.

      The Minister s personal assistant -- in effect his 
        intelligence services (the  Mukhabarat ) MINDER, ALI (30s, 
      dark hair, in a slick suit) is, as always, by his side. This 
      is a place where every word, every wink, is monitored KGB 
      style, particularly when it comes to interacting with 
      foreigners, and even more so when it involves members of the 
      government.

      Barzali ushers the Ambassador to the door --

                                    BARZALI
                    It s a shame you won t be with us 
                    in London for the celebrations. I m 
                    told the center is an incredibly 
                    beautiful building. 

      -- subtly positioning himself between the Ambassador and Ali.

                                  AMBASSADOR WRIGHT
                    I m afraid our foreign office is a 
                    bit of a miser when it comes to 
                    travel allowances. Still, I ll make 
                    sure I see it on my next trip home.

                                    BARZALI
                      Inshallah.

      The Ambassador extends his arm to shake hands. Barzali cups 
      the man s hand in both of his. Ali is behind him now, and 
      can t see his face.

      Barzali looks the Ambassador in the eye. The affable, casual 
      smile is replaced by a more serious look, the hands firmly 
      cupped.

                                    BARZALI (cont d)
                    I look forward to meeting your 
                      colleagues while I m there. There s 
                    so much to discuss. 

      -- and as Ali is back in their sightline, Barzali s 
      expression goes back to one of a smiling host, still holding 
      the Ambassador s hand firmly.

                                  AMBASSADOR WRIGHT
                          (thrown, but hiding it)
                    Have a safe trip.

      He turns to the minder. A mutual smile and a handshake.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                    SPOOKS - Episode 4.7 - Shooting Script  15.03.05   2.

                                  ALI
                    Mr Ambassador.

      The Ambassador leaves, unnerved.

      INT. ADAM AND FIONA S HOUSE. BEDROOM/BATHROOM - NIGHT22

      Adam watches as Fiona gets dressed for a formal event. Adam s 
      visibly concerned about something, and Fiona s avoiding him.

                                  ADAM
                    I still think it s a bad idea.  

                                  FIONA
                    It s not everyday that the foreign 
                    minister of Syria says he wants to 
                    have a quiet chat.

                                  ADAM
                    We re not even sure that s the 
                    case.

                                  FIONA
                    The foreign office seem to think 
                    so.

                                  ADAM
                    There are a hundred other ways we 
                    could have done this. None of which 
                    would have required your presence.

                                  FIONA
                    I know these people. 

                                  ADAM
                    I was there too, remember?

                                  FIONA
                    I think I know them a bit more 
                      intimately.

      It s not something Adam likes to be reminded of.

                                  ADAM
                    That s my point.
                          (beat)
                    We ve spent the last ten years 
                    avoiding your being exposed to 
                    anything even remotely connected to 
                    Syria, and here you are, plunging

                    ever seen.

                                  FIONA
                    Adam, we ve been over the guest 
                    list ten times. There isn t a 
                    single name on it I recognize. No 
                    one there s going to know me. And 
                    even if they did, so what? My ex-
                    husband turned out to be an Israeli 
                    spy, not me. I left the country a 
                    disgraced widow. No one s going to 
                    bear me a grudge. 

                                  ADAM
                    As long as they still buy that 
                    little fairy tale.

                                  FIONA
                    It s been hanging over us long 
                    enough, don t you think?

      He just stares at her, frustrated. Something s wrong. He 
      moves closer, takes hold of her shoulders, turning her to 
      face him.

                                  ADAM
                    What is it? Come on. Talk to me. 
                    You ve been acting strange for 
                    weeks.

      She finds it difficult to look him in the eye. She musters up 
      a smile -- but it s not an entirely convincing one.

                                  FIONA
                    I can t hide forever, can I?

                                  ADAM
                    You re not hiding, sweetie.

                                  FIONA
                    Of course I am. Even here, in the 
                    privacy of my own bedroom, I feel 
                    like I m undercover. It s like, 
                      sometimes, I wake up in the morning 
                    and I m not sure who I am anymore. 

                                  ADAM
                    You re my wife. You re Wes s mum.

      She gently pulls away and goes into the bathroom.

      INT. ADAM AND FIONA S HOUSE. BATHROOM - NIGHT33

      Fiona stares at herself in the mirror.

      FIONA s POV: She s looking at her face. Haunted. Scared.

      And we SMASH CUT to her remembering...

      INT. LONDON DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY (FLASHBACK)44

      Fiona s in the women s department, checking out some clothes. 
      OTHER WOMEN shoppers are around.

      ANGLE ON A WOMAN, young, Fiona s age -- dark haired, olive 
      skinned, middle eastern, well dressed -- who does a double 
      take as she spots her from behind some rails, maybe thirty 
      feet away. It s like she recognizes her.

      She watches Fiona for a beat, trying to see if it really is 
      who she thinks it is, and looks around furtively before 
      moving closer hesitantly and with visible unease.

                                  WOMAN
                    Amal...? Amal?

      The name chills Fiona to the bones. She glances at the 
      approaching woman and turns, slipping away, heart racing.

      The woman follows her, not in a desperate chase, but wanting 
      to talk to her --

      EXT. DAMASCUS. DARK ALLEY - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)55

      A hellish sight: Fiona -- ten years earlier, with long hair -- 
      beaten up and bloodied, crying, crawls over and cradles a 
      body lying in the ground. She turns the head to face her: 

      It s Adam -- savagely mauled. He looks dead. She caresses 
      him.

                                  FIONA
                    I m sorry. I m so sorry...

      Fiona, staring at herself in the mirror. Pulse racing.

      Her face hardens with resolve. She needs to be strong. She 
      blocks the memory and takes a deep breath.

      EXT. SYRIAN CULTURAL CENTER - NIGHT77

      the big event, the opening of the new center.

      INT. GREAT ROOM - NIGHT88

      A major gala underway: crystal chandeliers, string quartet in 
      the corner, champagne flutes. ARABS in robes and head-dress 
      mingle with other DIGNITARIES in black tie and long 
      dresses...

      In the crowd, we FIND ZAF, working the room as a waiter, 
      smiling as he navigates, a tray of canapes in hand.

      We re with Adam, MALCOLM, and COLIN, in the van, watching 
      several CCTV screens. Colin s fiddling with the audio 
      controls, ISOLATING CONVERSATIONS and filtering them as Zaf 
      moves around.

      FIONA -- understatedly elegant, not eye-popping, so as not to 
      attract undue attention -- shakes hands with Foreign Minister 
      Barzali. The omnipresent minder is with him.

      Barzali looks at her. He smiles, glances at her card.

                                    BARZALI
                    I m sure we can arrange something.

      ANGLE ON JO 

      Scanning the crowd, studying faces -- 

      AND NEAR JO, very close to her -- she doesn t notice him even 
      though he s within mike range from her -- A MAN with a 
      cigarette has taken a serious interest in Fiona. We ll come

      INT. THAMES HOUSE. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY1313

      The next-day debrief: Harry, Adam, Fiona, Ruth, Zaf, Jo. 

                                  FIONA
                    Barzali called this morning. He 
                    wants to set up a meeting at the 
                    embassy to discuss ways of using my 
                    newfound PR talents.

                                  HARRY
                    They could use it. What do we know 
                    about him?

      Ruth CLICKS the remote. His face flashes up on the PLASMA.

                                  RUTH
                    Riyad Barzali. Fifty-Four, married, 
                    three children. B.A.

      CONTINUED:1313
                                  RUTH (cont'd)
                    in agriculture from the American 
                      University of Beirut. Joined the 
                    Ba ath party upon his return to 
                    Syria. Mid-level party member until 
                    he s appointed foreign minister two 
                    years ago.
                          (beat, to Adam)
                    He s a Sunni Muslim.

                                  JO
                    Why is his religion relevant?

                                  ADAM
                    Syria is ruled by a minority, the 
                    Alawites -- probably the least 
                    religious branch of Islam. Even 
                    though they only make up around ten 
                    percent of the population, they 
                    control all the positions of power 
                    in the country, big and small. 
                    We re talking every military 
                    officer, every tank commander, 
                    every helicopter pilot, and of 
                    course, all the top seats of 
                      government -- they re all Alawites, 
                    except for the foreign minister, 
                    which has traditionally been a 
                    token cabinet position they hand 
                    out to the country s huge Sunni 
                    majority.

                                  ZAF
                    In other words, Barzali isn t  part 
                    of the family .

                                  RUTH
                    He s a follower -- he toes the 
                    party line, does what he s told and 
                    keeps his head down in return for a 
                      prestigious position and a 
                      comfortable life.

                                  ZAF
                    So we re saying the man s not one 
                    to ruffle feathers.

                                  ADAM
                    Until now.

      A beat. 

                                  JO
                    So why all the cloak and dagger 
                    routine? Can t he just set up a 
                    meeting and tell us what s on his 
                    mind? He s got diplomatic status.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                    SPOOKS - Episode 4.7 - Shooting Script  15.03.05   9.

                                  FIONA
                    You obviously haven t met Ali.

                                  JO
                    Ali?

      Ruth flashes up a surveillance photo from the party of 
      Barzali s minder.

                                  RUTH
                    Barzali s  private secretary . We 
                    don t know much about him.

                                  FIONA
                    One never does.

                                  ADAM
                          (to Jo)
                    Syria, like any self-respecting 
                    Ba athist dictatorship, has a 
                    notorious intelligence service, the  
                       Mukhabarat  -- think KGB on 
                    steroids. 

                                  FIONA
                    They keep tabs on everyone, layers 
                    upon layers of watchers all 
                    snooping on each other in a frenzy 
                    of paranoia. 
                          (beat)
                    Barzali practically can t brush his 
                    teeth without his minder being 
                    there. 

                                  RUTH
                    And one wrong word can get you into 
                    serious trouble out there.
                          (beat)
                    We re talking serious.

                                  HARRY
                    Okay, so we have the foreign 
                    minister giving us strong 
                      indications -- 

      He looks to Fiona for confirmation -- she nods.

                                  FIONA
                    I d say he wants to talk.

                                  ZAF
                    Do we trust him?

                                  HARRY
                    The foreign office seems to. 
                    They ve asked us to make it happen.

                                  HARRY (cont'd)
                    Ideally without getting Mr Barzali 
                    summoned back home for an extended 
                    session with a red-hot poker.
                          (to Fiona)
                    You re happy to take this further?

                                  FIONA
                    I ve already established contact. 
                    It would be stupid to waste that -- 
                    and it might make them suspicious.

                                  HARRY
                    Adam?

                                  ADAM
                    Her legend s fully backstopped, and 
                    she ll be wired at all times. We ll 
                    take all the necessary precautions.
                          (turns to Fiona)
                    But I don t want you going in there 
                    alone.

                                  FIONA
                    I hardly think you and me waltzing 
                    in there together would be the 
                    right move.

                                  ADAM
                    Take Jo with you. It ll dilute your 
                    presence, take the focus off you.

      Jo looks at Fiona. Not Fiona s ideal scenario, but...

                                  FIONA
                    Fine.

      INT. THAMES HOUSE. THE GRID - DAY1414

      Fiona, Jo and Ruth. Ruth s handing Jo some printouts, a crash 
      course in government PR work.

                                  FIONA
                    The Saudis have been doing it in 
                    the US for years. 

                                  RUTH
                    They re actually running ads on TV 
                    there telling people they re the 
                    good guys.

                                  FIONA
                    Just good ol  Krispy Kreme eating 
                    lovers of freedom and democracy.
                          (beat)
                    Sort of.

      Jo eyes the thick printout.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                  SPOOKS - Episode 4.7 - Shooting Script  15.03.05   11.

                                  JO
                    How long do I have to get through 
                    these?

                                  FIONA
                    We re seeing him tomorrow morning.

                                  JO
                    And here I was thinking I was done 
                    with homework in this lifetime. 

                                  FIONA
                    Only difference is, now you re 
                    getting paid for it.

      Jo smiles and wanders off. Fiona s alone with Ruth.

                                  FIONA (cont d)
                    I d like to keep an eye on all 
                    Syrians coming through passport 
                    control.

                                  RUTH
                    Are we looking for anyone in 
                      particular?

                                  FIONA
                    If I m going to bump into someone 
                    who knows me from the old days 
                    while I m at their embassy, I d 
                    rather be prepared.

                                  RUTH
                          (probing)
                    Are you sure it s a good idea? You 
                    being there, that close to them?

                                  FIONA
                    I ve spent more time around these 
                    people than anyone here. I know how 
                    they think.
                          (beat)
                    You ll get the live updates from

                    I ll set it up.

                                  FIONA
                    With passport captures?

                                  RUTH
                    Sure.

      INT. SYRIAN EMBASSY. OFFICE - DAY1515

      Shalhoob -- the man who was watching Fiona at the big bash -- 
      is at his desk. He studies some pictures.

      CLOSE ON THE PICTURES: they re shots of Fiona, at the party. 

      He settles on one of them: 

      CLOSE ON THE SHOT: she s talking to Barzali.

      He stares at it, thinking. His phone BEEPS. He answers.

                                  SHALHOOB
                          (in Arabic, with subtitles)
                    I m looking at them right now... 

      INT. THAMES HOUSE. FORGERY SUITE - DAY1616

      MALCOLM hands Fiona a small aluminium BRIEFCASE from a table. 

                                    MALCOLM
                          (re: briefcase, curious)
                    You don t usually go for the heavy 
                      artillery. You sure you remember 
                    how to use one of these?

                                  FIONA
                          (dismisses it lightly)
                    It s just to keep Adam happy. 
                          (re: briefcase)
                    You know, this might be a bit 
                    too... cumbersome. You think I 
                    could also have something more 
                    discrete?

      He thinks about it. Reaches into one of his big drawers and 
      pulls out a key ring, which he hands her. Fiona examines it.

      CLOSE ON THE KEYRING: it s got what looks like a black 
      plastic car alarm BLEEPER on it. Only there are two small 
      holes on its side.

                                    MALCOLM
                    It s got cupro-nickel hollow point 
                    bullets for maximum effect --

                                  FIONA
                    -- but it s not the most accurate 
                    gun on the planet. I know.

                                    MALCOLM
                    At least it won t trip the 
                    embassy s metal detectors.





                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                  SPOOKS - Episode 4.7 - Shooting Script  15.03.05   13.

                          (examines it)
                    How chuffed do you think the 
                    Serbian mafia would be if they knew 
                    we were using their little 
                      inventions?

                                    MALCOLM
                    Theirs tend to go off 
                      unintentionally. 

                                  FIONA
                    And ours don t, right?

      Malcolm just gives her an enigmatic smile.

                                    MALCOLM
                    Anything else I can interest you 
                    in?

                          (playful)
                    I could use one of those trackers, 
                    if it isn t too much trouble.

      Malcolm smiles and reaches for something else: a small 
      microchip wafer, the size of a flattened vitamin tablet.

                                    MALCOLM
                    Turn around.

      She does, and lifts her hair off her neck. 

      Malcolm takes places the flat chip on a piece of skin-
      coloured tape and tapes it at the base of her hairline. It s 
      unnoticeable.

      He turns to his computer and hits some keys. She joins him.

      Fiona s finishing stuffing some clothes into a bag and zips 
      it shut. Adam hovers, still unhappy with the situation.

                                  ADAM
                    You don t need to stay there. We ll 
                    make sure they only see what we 
                    want them to see. 

                                  FIONA
                    I don t want to take any chances. 
                    My legend needs to be fully 
                      backstopped. 

      She picks up the bag, gives Adam a kiss as he hands her the 
      aluminium case --

                    Besides, it s good to spend a few 
                    nights apart. Makes it all the more 
                    fun when we re back together.

      Adam looks at her. He s not swayed.

                    Tell Wes I ll call him from there?

      Fiona s alone. Fidgety. Flicking through TV channels. Staring 
      through the screen. She FLICKS it off, walks over to the 
      window.

      She rubs her finger against the back of her neck, her eyes 
      catching her reflection in the glass. And we SMASH CUT to --

      INT. LONDON DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY (FLASHBACK)2020

      Fiona, peeping out from behind her cover, watching as the 
      woman who recognized her stands there, looking lost. 

      The woman turns and walks away, disappointed.

      ON FIONA -- she can t bring herself to do this. 




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                  SPOOKS - Episode 4.7 - Shooting Script  15.03.05   15.

      She emerges from her cover and follows the woman, puts her 
      hand on her shoulder as she reaches her.

                                  FIONA
                    Joumana?

      The woman -- JOUMANA -- turns. Her face lights up when she 
      sees Fiona. It s like the meeting of two long lost sisters. 
      Joumana hugs Fiona, tight. Fiona s as moved as she is.

      They pull back -- and Fiona sees sadness and fear breaking 
      out across Joumana s face. Tears streak down her cheeks. 
      Fiona doesn t understand.

                                  FIONA (cont d)
                          (Arabic, in subtitles)
                    Joumana? What s wrong?

      Joumana shakes her head like she doesn t want to talk about 
      it. Fiona presses her.

                          (Arabic, in subtitles)
                    What s happened?

      And as Joumana turns, Fiona recoils as she spots a nasty old 
      SCAR just below her friend s hairline. Joumana looks at 
      Fiona. Whatever it is, it s an extremely painful memory -- 
      Joumana starts to cry -- 

                                    JOUMANA

      INT. SAFEHOUSE - NIGHT2121

      Fiona snaps the image out of her mind, heart racing. She 
      calms herself, finds the briefcase Malcolm gave her and opens 
      it. 

      CLOSE ON THE BRIEFCASE: it s got a big, silver 9mm automatic, 
      silencer, bullets. The works.

      She pulls out the gun, pops in a magazine, chambers a round. 
      And looks at it.

      INT. SYRIAN EMBASSY. OFFICE - DAY2323

      ...where Fiona and Jo are finishing up a meeting with 
      Barzali, with Ali in attendance as always.

                                    BARZALI
                    We need to move away from this 
                      ridiculous  axis of evil  label the 
                    Americans seem obsessed with.

                                  FIONA
                    Despite the fact that you signed up

                    -- at great political risk, I might 
                    add. Our people weren t happy to 
                    see Syrian troops fighting side by 
                    side with Marines and killing other 
                    Arabs.

                    What s happening in Lebanon isn t

                    We ll flesh out some ideas and put 
                    together a pitch document for you.

                    ...three days?

      Jo nods.

                                    BARZALI
                      Excellent.

      They reach the door. As they shake hands --

                                  FIONA
                    We d love to take you out for a 
                    nice meal while you re in town. 
                    Lunch perhaps? Tomorrow?

      Barzali turns to Ali, who shrugs like it s doable.

                                    BARZALI
                    It would be a pleasure.

      They re about to leave when Shalhoob appears. He seems 
      surprised to see them. Fiona almost imperceptibly flinches in 
      a moment of recognition.

      Fiona and Jo get into the car. Fiona s visibly shaken. She 
      reaches for the car keys, but her hand s shaking and it takes 
      a beat for her to get it in. She pauses, shuts her eyes for a 
      beat, controls her breathing -- which Jo s watching.

                                  JO
                    Are you okay?

      Fiona doesn t answer, lost in her own thoughts.

                    He wanted kids. A question of

                    him, anyway. And after a year of

      INT. DAMASCUS. RESTAURANT - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)2828

      A big group getting drunk at a table. Only Fiona s cast 
      aside, watching as Farook toasts and laughs away, fawning 
      attractive local WOMEN to each side --

      She looks across the table in silent frustration, finding a 
      sympathetic eye in another woman: Joumana, the woman who 
      recognized Fiona in the department store.

      INT. DAMASCUS. FIONA AND FAROOK S HOME - DAY (FLASHBACK)2929

      By their front door, a suited Farook jabs a stern finger and 
      mouths fierce words to a tearful Fiona before abandoning her 
      and SLAMMING the door --

                                  FIONA
                    I thought my life was over. There 
                    was no way out. A divorce was out 
                    of the question for Farook. 
                          (beat)
                    And then I met Adam.

                    Your knight in shining armour.

      Adam, getting savagely beaten up by THREE SYRIAN HENCHMEN and 
      FAROOK as another of his men holds back Fiona. 

      Adam collapses, seemingly dead, and Farook turns to Fiona and 
      gives her a massive, open handed slap, sending her down.

      They get into a car and drive off. 

      Fiona crawls over to Adam s inert body, tears streaming down 
      her bloodied face. She turns him over. He looks dead.

                                  FIONA
                    I m sorry. I m so sorry...

                    He almost died because of my

      Adam, heavily bandaged and bruised, sits with an MI6 FORGER 
      who s working on some photos. Adam s studying several black 
      and white photos:

      CLOSE ON THE PHOTOS: one shows Farook talking to a Syrian 
      man. Others show an Israeli officer in various poses, some 
      with an Israeli flag clearly visible nearby.

      The forger finishes his work, hands Adam the picture. Adam 
      checks his work:

      CLOSE ON THE PHOTOS: the new one s just like the original of 
      Farook talking to the Syrian, only his face has been replaced 
      with the Israeli s face. 

      Adam nods his approval.

      Syrian arrivals, flicking through screen shots of their 
      passports.

      Adam peers over her shoulder.

                    She could still be recognized.

                                  RUTH
                    Farook was hanged. Fiona had 
                    nothing to stay for. Even if 
                    someone were to recognize her... 
                    they ve got nothing against her.

                    Unless they put two and two

                    In which case they d be after you, 
                    not her. You were the one who 
                    framed him. Besides, as far as 
                    they re concerned, you did them a 
                    favour. He did turn out to be a 
                    Mossad agent, didn t he?

      EXT. FARNBOROUGH AIRPORT - DAY4141

      Dusk. The cabin door of a private jet pops open as its 
      engines WHINE down. Two ARABS in white robes, Kuwaiti-style, 
      climb out. One s younger, let s call him KAREEM. The other s 
      more senior: early 50s, clean shaven, sunglasses; slick. He 
      stays back a step as a lone IMMIGRATION OFFICER is there to 
      meet them.

                                    IMMIGRATION OFFICER
                    Good evening, gentlemen. Welcome to 
                    the United Kingdom. 

      Kareem hands him the three passports. The officer glances at 
      them.

      CLOSE ON THE PASSPORTS: they re KUWAITI. 

      The officer matches the pictures with the faces, not 
        particularly watchful -- these are allies. 

                                    IMMIGRATION OFFICER (cont d)
                    How long do you intend to stay in 
                    the UK?

                                  KAREEM
                    One week. Maybe a few days more.

      The officer nods, and takes out a small rubber stand from his 
      kit and stamps the first passport.

                                    IMMIGRATION OFFICER
                    That shouldn t be a problem.

      As the officer stamps them, the OLDER KUWAITI looks beyond 
      him.

      smoking. Shalhoob discretely nods his recognition.

      Fiona eyes Ali discretely, watching him as he studies the 
      waiter carefully. The waiter leaves. Fiona raises her glass.

      Jo raises her glass. Barzali is about to go for his glass -- 
      but Ali reaches for it courteously and takes it instead.

      Barzali notices the girls spotting this, and smiles 
        reassuringly as he reaches for the glass that was meant for 
      Ali.

                                    BARZALI
                    It s just an old habit. Protocol.

      Malcolm is in the kitchen, listening through his earmike,

      Barzali and Ali have identical dishes of lamb.

      Ali doesn t go for it, keeping his own.

      INT. LONDON RESTAURANT - DAY4949

      The waiter arrives at the table, a sauce boat on a tray.

                    Ah, the mint sauce.
                          (to Ali)
                    You must try some. 

      Ali glances at the waiter -- and as he does, Barzali looks at 
      Fiona who gives him the most discrete of nods. Ali nods to 
      the waiter to go ahead. 

      The waiter serves Ali some sauce, then moves over to Barzali. 
      Barzali nods too. The waiter leans over --

      CLOSE ON THE SAUCE BOAT: as he stirs the sauce, he uses the 
      spoon to SQUEEZE OPEN a small sack hidden inside the boat, 
      releasing a liquid into the sauce.

      He serves Barzali. Smiles, and retreats.

      ON SCREEN: Barzali doesn t really give Ali an option. He just 
      digs in.

      The end of the meal now. They re all savouring their coffees.

                                    BARZALI
                    ...and I thought, well, since I 
                    wasn t going to...

      Barzali loses his train of thought. He looks ill and seems 
      dazed and sweaty. He loosens his tie. 

                                    BARZALI (cont d)
                    I m sorry, I don t know what...

      Ali looks at him. He looks terrible. 

                                  FIONA
                    Are you alright?

      Just then, Barzali SEIZES UP, grabbing his stomach in pain, 
      and falls off his chair. Ali jumps out of his chair as Fiona 
      and Jo get up to help --

                                  JO
                    Oh my God. What s wrong with him?

      Ali s all over him already, checking his breathing, loosening 
      his collar -- but Barzali s shaking, bile oozing out of his 
      mouth before passing out --

                                  FIONA
                    Someone call an ambulance.

                    Look at him. He needs help NOW.

      Ali looks from Fiona to Barzali, not sure what to do --                                  SPOOKS - Episode 4.7 - Shooting Script  15.03.05   30.



      EXT. LONDON RESTAURANT - DAY5252

      Fiona and Jo watch from the sidewalk as Barzali is wheeled 
      into an ambulance. 

      Ali tries to climb into the ambulance. The PARAMEDIC shakes 
      his head, moving to block him --

                    I m sorry, you can t --

                    I have diplomatic status. Don t 
                    tell me what I can or can t do.

      unperturbed at being watched by --

      Early evening. Fiona emerges from her office block and stands 
      by the curb, looking for a taxi. Watched by --

      ACROSS THE STREET, a few cars down: Kareem and the driver, 
      watching. 

      THEIR POV: Fiona, standing there. Waiting for a cab.

      They start their engine.

      ON THE CURB

      Fiona waits. 

      CLOSE ON HER EAR -- and a tiny earplug, through which we

      Fiona turns to face that way, and the lit taxi appears. 

      She flags it down. It pulls over, she climbs in. It drives 
      off.

      WATCHED by the Arabs.

      As it drives off, the tailing car moves to pull out from its 
      spot --

      The Arab car is pulling out of its parking spot when ANOTHER 
      CAR rushes past, swerving to avoid it at the last minute 
      while HONKING its horn. There s a small contact -- bumpers or 
      side mirrors swiped. It s Zaf. 

      Zaf s car stops, effectively blocking the Arab s way. He 
      climbs out of his car, infuriated.

                                  ZAF
                    Oy! What s wrong with you?

      The Arab driver gets out, shouting back in Arabic,

      recognition between two agents on an assignment.

      Only Ruth s seen something else. She looks closer.

      ON SCREEN: To Jo s side is SHALHOOB. From the angle, we can 
      tell that he s looking at Fiona, who s off to one side of the

      He then picks up his mobile and calls, his eyes still on 
      Fiona (this is the scene we saw him do in the Teaser, but 
      from another angle). But before he can speak, the camera 
      moves off frustratingly and roams again.

      Ruth freezes the image and rewinds it, intrigued.

      Ali sits on the uncomfortable waiting chairs outside 
      Barzali s room, tired, bored. There s a scattering of boring, 
      out of date magazines, and a coin operated coffee machine. 
      It s all captured on CCTV by --

                    Maybe we should pipe in some

      They watch as --

      INT. HOSPITAL. HALLWAY - NIGHT6969

      An OLD MAN (Rob) in dressing gown and slippers, wheeling an 
      IV drip, walks over and sits next to Ali.

      He doesn t look at him. He just starts to COUGH. A really 
      disgusting, wheezing, contagious sounding cough.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                  SPOOKS - Episode 4.7 - Shooting Script  15.03.05   35.

                                  COLIN
                      I wouldn t bet on it.

      They see Ali take a few steps, leaning against the wall.

                    Cue Jenny.

      They watch as the NURSE from earlier (Jenny), appears, smiles 
      at him as she passes and stops at the coffee machine.

      INT. HOSPITAL. HALLWAY - NIGHT7171

      The nurse acknowledges him as she pops some coins in and 
      selects her coffee. 

      Ali just half smiles. 

      She pulls out her coffee from the tray and takes a sip. He 
      looks at her -- wanting one.

      She smiles and walks off.

      CLOSE UP: COFFEE DISPENSER CAVITY: the cup plops down.

      ZOOM INTO THE MACHINE: A smaller nozzle -- tucked in behind 
      the one that spews out the normal coffee -- comes alive, 
      squirting a clear liquid into the cup as it fills with 
      coffee.

      ALI

      Takes out the coffee, heads back to a seat as the coughing 
      man moves away, and sits down. He warms his hands on the cup 
      before taking a sip, then another.

                    It should kick in in about five

      Adam, in hospital garb, reaches Ali, who s sound asleep on 
      the chair. He leans down, and checks him. He s out. He 
      replaces Ali s cup with a discarded one, chucks Ali s in the 
      bin instead, and continues, talking into his lapel mike.

                    A little magic potion we came up

                    You wanted to talk. We don t have

      Barzali takes a beat. He s not in great shape, and this is a 
      huge, dangerous step for him. He summons up his courage.

                    We don t want to turn into another

                                  ADAM
                    It s easily taken care of. Stop 
                    backing the insurgents in Iraq,  
                    get out of Lebanon and hold some 
                    real elections for a change.

                                    BARZALI
                    You joke, but the people in the 
                    streets are talking about the 
                    elections in Iraq. They re

                    The parallels between us and Iraq

      Very early. Juliet and Harry. A private conversation.

                                  HARRY
                    We re talking about sanctioning the 
                      assassination of a foreign 
                      government official. 

                                  JULIET
                    It s hardly a legitimate 
                      government. Besides, you ve seen 
                    his file. The man s psychotic. And 
                    that s just the stuff we know 
                    about. 

                                  HARRY
                    It s a slippery slope...

                                  JULIET
                    I don t like it any more than you 
                    do, Harry. But if doing this helps 
                    turn them into a democracy without 
                    having to go through a mess like 
                    Iraq...

                                  HARRY
                    We re more likely to just end up 
                    with another dictator. It s been 
                    their M.O. for fifty years.

                                  JULIET
                    If that happens, he d be a dictator 
                    we have a hold on. The odds are 
                    he ll be discovered and quartered 
                    within the week, but on the off

                    How does six feel about it?

                    They ll do it if we ask them to.

                                  HARRY
                    And we re going to ask them to.

                                  JULIET
                    Not in so many words.

                                  HARRY
                    I see. The beast of deniability 
                    rears its ugly head yet again.

                          (beat)
                    We re all hiding under the same

                                  HARRY
                    So we re going ahead with it.

                    Subject to clearing it upstairs,

                    We need him to do something for us. 
                    As a gesture of good will.

                                  HARRY
                    And a bit of leverage -- just in 
                    case.

      She looks at him. They re on the same wavelength on this.

      INT. HOSPITAL. PRIVATE ROOM - DAY8282

      Early morning. Adam s checking on Barzali, who s dressed and 
      sitting on his bed. Ali watches.

                                  ADAM
                    I ll just take one last blood 
                    pressure reading and you re free to 
                    go.

      As he straps on the armband, the NURSE (JENNY) comes in with 
        a clipboard.

                                  JENNY
                    How will you be settling the bill?

      Ali looks at Barzali. Barzali nods for him to take care of 
      it.

                                  JENNY (cont d)
                    This way.

      She leads him out --

                                  ADAM
                    We can do business, but we need 
                    something from you first. To 
                    convince everyone you can deliver.

                                    BARZALI

      As Ali steps back in. Adam removes the blood pressure wrap, 
      smiles.

      INT. THAMES HOUSE. COMPUTER ROOM - DAY8383

      Ruth sits with Colin, watching the footage from the opening 
      night that she was looking at earlier.

                                  RUTH
                    You see that? Right there.

      She pauses it.

      ON SCREEN: The image freezes on Shalhoob, making his call.

                                  RUTH (cont d)
                    I can t make out what he s saying, 
                    too much noise around. And then the 
                    camera moves away anyway.

                    But then he s not far from Jo. And 
                    she was wired.

                                  COLIN
                    Her mike might have picked up 
                      something.

                                  RUTH
                    Exactly. At least we d have audio.

                                  COLIN
                    I ll try and isolate it.

      EXT. HOTEL - DAY8484

      Dusk. An old world hotel somewhere in Mayfair. Barzali walks 
      in, past the porter --                                  SPOOKS - Episode 4.7 - Shooting Script  15.03.05   43.



      INT. LIVING ROOM, BARZALI S HOTEL SUITE - DAY8585

      Barzali walks into his suite -- and stops in his tracks. 
      Waiting for him is the OLDER KUWAITI from the plane. Shalhoob 
      is also there.

                                    BARZALI
                          (nervous surprise, subtitles)
                    No one told me you were --

      Before Barzali can even finish his sentence, Kareem appears 
      from behind the door, lifts up a metal rod the length of a 
      baseball bat and swings it full strength against the back of 
      Barzali s legs.

      Barzali goes down, in massive pain. He clutches his legs in 
      agony as the Kuwaiti moves in, looming over him.

                                    BARZALI (cont d)
                          (subtitles)
                    What are you doing? My leg --

      But the Kuwaiti is unmoved. He calmly gestures for the rod 
      from Kareem, who hands it to him. 

      He swings it over his head, and brings it down on Barzali 
      berating him angrily in Arabic --

      Barzali cowers but can t deflect the massive blow and SCREAMS 
      in pain --

      INT. THAMES HOUSE. THE GRID - DAY8686

      Afternoon. Fiona, fidgety, finds Ruth --

      Before Fiona can answer, her phone RINGS. She looks at it,

      isolating the audio from the opening night.

      He s like a DJ, fiddling with his onscreen control panel 
      while trying to pluck out Shalhoob s CONVERSATION from a 
      cacophony of different CONVERSATIONS going on in the busy 
      room.

      He s getting there -- but it s still very garbled.

      INT. THAMES HOUSE. HARRY S OFFICE - DAY8888

      Dusk. Fiona, Harry, Adam.

                    We ll have a team outside the

                    I ll be fine.

      He looks at her. It s almost as if she s trying to convince 
      herself.

      INT. SAFEHOUSE. BEDROOM - NIGHT8989

      It s late. Fiona s in bed, but she s awake, unable to sleep. 
      Staring at the ceiling.

      Her mobile BEEPS, lighting up in the darkness. She takes it.

      CLOSE ON THE PHONE S SCREEN: It s Adam.

      She answers.

                                  FIONA

      INT. SAFEHOUSE, SITTING ROOM - NIGHT9090

      She opens the door, slightly panicked. Adam s standing there.

                    What are you doing here?

                                  ADAM

      She nudges her away -- Jo edges away, reluctantly, worried 
      now as Fiona sees ALI coming towards her from the lobby. Her 
      hand dives into her handbag and pulls out her KEYS with the 
      gun FOB as he reaches her. She smiles.

      Colin plays the cleaned conversation for Ruth who listens

                    It s the best I could do.

                     Guess who I m looking at right 
                    now .

      A beat. There s a pause while the other side of the 
        conversation talks. Then we hear Shalhoob s answer, and 
      Ruth s face freezes.

                    And what s that horrible perfume 
                    you re using?
                          (beat)
                    This won t do. We re going to have 
                    to change all that.

      Fiona looks at him with fear and hatred.

                                  FIONA
                    Leena. Joumana. Why did you have to 
                    come after them like that.

                                  FAROOK
                    I wanted to find you.

                                  FIONA
                    Leena killed herself. Because of 
                    what your men did to her.

                                  FAROOK
                    She wasn t as strong as you ve

                    Barzali isn t a traitor. He wanted 
                    to save your country.

      Farook laughs, ridiculing her.

                                  FAROOK
                    Barzali wanted to save his pride.

      Fiona looks at him like  ...what?  

                                  FAROOK (cont d)
                    The head of the Mukhabarat he

                    find you?

      He watches her. She s shivering. REALLY looks bad now. All is 
      lost. She curls over, clutching her belly.

                                  FIONA
                    I need to use the bathroom.

                    I m... going to throw up.

      Farook studies her. She really looks like a wreck. He looks 
      at Ali. Ali nods like she s been thoroughly checked. 

      Farook nods to her. Ali gets her up and walks her to the 
      small toilet. He stands by the door as she goes in.                                  SPOOKS - Episode 4.7 - Shooting Script  15.03.05   63.



      INT. JET CABIN. BATHROOM - NIGHT145145

      Fiona closes the door behind her. She holds onto the sink 
      unit, stares into the mirror. Lost. Broken. Hopeless. A tear 
      trickles down her cheek. What have I done?

      She stares at her face. Mind in turmoil.

      FLASHBACK to Joumana crying as she tells her about what 
      happened. 

      FLASHBACK to Adam being beaten half to death by Farook and 
      his men.

      She looks at herself. She shuts her eyes. Like someone who s 
      lost all hope. 

      She looks around. Searching for any hope. Desperate. 
      Devastated. Beaten. 

      Nothing. 

      She looks back at her broken self the mirror.

      Then she gets an idea. Her expression changes. A wave of 
      determination surges over her.

      She stares into the mirror -- and LOCKS the door before 
      SMASHING the mirror with her fist.

      INT. JET CABIN - NIGHT146146

      Ali, the Arab and Farook react to the sound of the locking 
      door and the shattered glass -- first surprised, unsure of 
      what it is, then realizing it could be something. They rush 
      to the door --

      INT. JET CABIN. BATHROOM - NIGHT147147

      Fiona, in a panic, the door getting pounded from outside and 
      about to be kicked in, sitting on the toilet, using a long 
      shard of mirror to CUT into her wrists -- NOT THE UNDERSIDE 
      that one expects in a suicide attempt, but the UPPER SIDE, 
      and SMEARING BLOOD down to the palm side to simulate the 
      suicide cuts --

      INT. JET CABIN - NIGHT148148

      Ali KICKS the door in to reveal --

      FIONA, sitting on the loo, BLOOD oozing down from her wrists--

      FAROOK looks at her in shock --

                                  FIONA
                    You ll have to land. I ll never 
                    make it to Damascus if you don t.

                    against Adam.

      Farook, in a panic, shouting at ALI --

                                  FAROOK
                          (in Arabic, with subtitles)
                    GET ME THE MEDICAL KIT!

      Farook lifts her up -- carries her out into the main cabin --

      CLOSE ON FIONA S HAND -- as she SLIPS OUT a long, pointed 
      SHARD OF GLASS from her shirt -- and holds it FIRMLY --

      Her hand WHIPS UP quickly -- expertly STABBING the shard deep 
      into FAROOK s jugular vein --

      He tumbles back, grasping his neck from which BLOOD erupts --

      ALI and the THIRD ARAB, at the back of the cabin, react, 
      grabbing their weapons --

      She SPOTS Farook s gun in his belt, grabs it and pushes 
      Farook back at them while firing --

      She hits the underling in the chest, he goes down, but --

      In his panic and unbalance from Farook s body, Ali lets rip a 
      long BURST OF SILENCED GUNFIRE --

      BULLETS bite into the cabin s interior, including the 
      partition leading to the cockpit --

      Before he s hit by Fiona s bullets and slumps --

      She stands up, then drops down in pain. She looks down at her 
      side -- she s been hit, a blood patch swelling to her side.

      In pain, she looks at the cockpit door. SEES the bullet holes 
      through it. 

      INT. PRIVATE JET, COCKPIT - NIGHT149149

      Fiona staggers into the cockpit to find the PILOT dead at the 
      controls, BLOOD splattered on the windshield.

      She collapses to the floor, barely conscious --

      And we HEAR the plane s engine noise change -- it s going 
      down --

      EXT. FARNBOROUGH AIRPORT - NIGHT150150

      Adam s rushing across the tarmac, heading for some parked 
      jets --

                                  ADAM
                    I don t care, I m doing this --                                  SPOOKS - Episode 4.7 - Shooting Script  15.03.05   65.

                    Adam, listen to me --

                    They re over water.

      Colin shouts over from another position --

                    I ve got Fiona. She s on the

      Adam stops in his tracks, hears the CLICKS --

                    It had to be him. I knew he was

                    I would have found him first.

                    That s why I couldn t tell you. He 
                    almost killed you once, because of 
                    me. I couldn t risk it again.

                                  ADAM

      ON SCREEN: We can see the green RADAR BLIP of the plane, with 
      its MARKINGS flashing next to it, and the ALTITUDE READING 
      scrolling down vertiginously, crashing through 15,000 feet,

      Just like that. In silence. Like it never existed.
