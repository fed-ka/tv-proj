    The shrill BEEP-BEEP-BEEP of an alarm clock. Its 5am.

      VINCE FARADAY (30s, capable) turns over in bed, expecting to 
      find his wife, instead finding his 8-year-old-sonTRIP 
      staring back at him.

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                          (to Trip)
                    What reyou doing here?

                                  TRIP
                    Bad dream.


      VINCE sips his coffee, watching the news. TRIP watches his 
      Dad. He likes to watch his Dad get ready for work. Vince 
      absently puts HANDCUFFS and a HOLSTEREDPISTOL in his belt.

      Trip pours himself some cereal. Watches news.

                                  NEWS 7 REPORTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    Ross is widely given credit for 
                    turning around Valley Ridge and New 
                    Belmont but this will definitely be 
                    his greatest challenge yet...

      Vince finishes his coffee. He leans down and plants a kiss on 
      Trip s head. Heads off.                                                                                    2.

      VINCE walks through an office bustling with activity. It s an 
      important day. All hands on deck.

      A FEMALE DETECTIVE hands Vince a piece of paper.

                                  FEMALE DETECTIVE
                    Just to start your morning right.
                          (beat, re: paper)
                    Death threat to the Mayor.

      Faraday studies printout. Frowns.

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                          (reads name)
                    Guy calls himself Chess? That s 
                    cute.
                          (pause)
                    He s got the Mayor s internal 
                    schedule.

                                  FEMALE DETECTIVE
                    We gave that to the press.

                    In a press release. This schedule 
                    came from inside the Mayor s

                    Better take this upstairs.


      VINCE FARADAY enters the office as ROSS - the new Top Cop of 
      Palm City - looks over his speech.

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                    Sorry to bother you, Chief.

                    been released.

                                  ROSS
                    We don t flinch. Not today.

                          (pause, pockets the paper)
                      Understood.

                          up two pieces of paper)
                    I m like Santa Claus here, Faraday, 
                    I ve got two lists. Cops who ve
                    been Naughty and cops who vebeen 
                    Nice.

      Ross holds up a sheet of paper with two hundred names. And a 
      sheet of paper with five names.

                                  ROSS (CONT'D)
                          (shakes two hundred names)
                    Naughty.

                    That s a lot of coal.

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                    Yes, sir.

                                  ROSS
                    I ve never seen corruption like 
                    this and I m no boy scout. So what 
                    the hell have I gotten myself into?
                          (holdsup his hand)

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                    No, Chief.

                                  ROSS
                    So why? Why stay clean? Better yet: 
                    why s this city worth saving?

                    Baldwin. It s home.

                                  ROSS
                    You married up.

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                    She ll tell you that.

                                  ROSS
                    All right, Faraday, get out. I m 
                    gonnalean on you. Make us proud 
                    today. Need to read this stupid 
                    damn speech.

                                                                            CUT TO:


    THE CHIEF OF POLICE loosens his tie in the passenger seat.                                                                                    6.

                    Hope that Chess moron had a front 
                    row seat.

      Ross smells something. He turns around and sees...

      ...an officer - GARCIA - dead. A smoking hole in his chest.

      Ross turns to THE DRIVER who takes off his sunglasses. He 
      wears freakish contact lenses - A CHESS SYMBOL IN EACH EYE - 
      a rook and a knight. 

                                  CHESS
                    Backstage pass.

      Before the Chief can react there s a HYPODERMIC NEEDLE in his 
      neck and a poison pushing into his carotid artery.


      A haggard VINCE FARADAY enters the kitchen. Wife DANA (30s, 
      pretty, no pushover) gives him a well-needed-hug.

      TRIP sits at the table eating dessert. The news is on.

      Under a bare bulb VINCE twirls two police truncheons and 
      assails a hanging bag. Heavy blows. Vince is covered in 
      sweat. Hands taped. He drives knees into an unseen enemy. He 
      uses the truncheons with deadly accuracy. Substitutes his 
      fists. This is a guy with advanced and unique fight training.

      After exhausting himself he hears a floorboard CREAK...

      ...Vince turns to TRIP on the stairs. His small hands are 
      taped too. Vince gestures for him to come over.

      Trip walks over. Punches the bag.

      DANA is in the bathroom. Dries her face. VINCE is in bed. 
      They re in the middle of a discussion.

                    I thought you d be happy.

                    I just want to know it s what you 
                    want. You ve always wanted to be a

                                  VINCE FARADAY

      Dana climbs onto the bed.

                                  DANA
                    Time off? What s that?

                    changed a light bulb in two years.

      Vince curls Dana into his arms. Kiss.

                    What? I thought that sounded good.

      Vince kisses her. Dana kisses him back, presses against him. 
    The temperature goes up as we...

      VINCE looks like a fish out of water in these sleek steel and 
      slate offices. In iron letters on the wall it reads: LYNX.

    he waits for his appointment.

      VINCE looks away from the screen at MARTY VOYT (40s, 
      friendly) - former police detective and friend.

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                    Marty.

    The two old friends share a hug.

                                  MARTY VOYT
                    I was so happy to get your call.


      VINCE and MARTY sit at a coffee table.

                                  MARTY VOYT
                    This takeover is happening. Palm 
                    City will have a private police 
                    force. Peter Fleming is a freakin 
                    visionary. Real wages. Real 
                      technology. It s the future.

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                    Sounds great.

                                  MARTY VOYT
                    How s Dana? Trip?

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                    Good. You know, I never see  em but 
                    they re good.

                                  MARTY VOYT
                    These hours won t kill you either. 


      MARTY and VINCE shake hands outside Marty s office.

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                    Can t tell you how much I 
                    appreciate this, Marty.

      There is movement down the hall as Lynx CEO PETER Fleming 
      makes his way through the offices.                                                                                    11.

                    Mr. Fleming.

      Peter Fleming stops. Vince is nervous.

                    Yes, sir. Yes it can.

      Relief flushes over Vince.

      VINCE makes out with Dana in the family s kitchen. TRIP 
      covers his eyes.

                    Now we can focus on getting bad 
                    guys.

      Trip smiles.


      DANA pokes her head in.

                    He s gotta finish his school 
                    reading.

      VINCE lays over the covers. TRIP is tucked in.

                    Night Mom!

      Dana closes the door. Vince looks at Trip. Trip nods.

      Vince puts down the school book and pulls out a comic book. 
    The titular character is a black-masked-super-hero streaking 
      across the sky, a great black cape fluttering in the wind 
      behind him. The title: THE CAPE.

                    his face a leering mask of fire. 
                    The Cape:  I should ve killed you 
                    when I had the chance, El Diablo.

      Trip cuddles in a little closer to his Dad.

      VINCE gets into his car, looks up and sees a DVD CASE 
      sticking out of his visor. Vince looks around the parking lot 
      then, cautiously, takes down the DVD. On the cover is an 
      image of an ALL-SEEING-EYE.

                    This is illegal, Vince. This is not

      Vince takes the box from Marty, tears it open, takes out the 
      PammyPees doll and - carefully - pulls off the head.

      STEEL CANNISTER with a chemical name on the label as long as 
      your arm and NERVE AGENTprinted prominently upon it.

                    It s a weaponizedshell filled with 
                    - what I think is - VX gas. I ve 
                    checked six boxes. All the same.
                          (beat)
                    What s Peter Fleming need a 
                    warehouse full of nerve gas for?

      Marty looks around at all the boxes. Back at Vince.

                                  MARTY VOYT
                    You re talking about a multi-
                          billion-dollar-corporation. Has a 
                    lot of moving parts.

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                    In this city those moving parts 
                    seem to include organized crime and 
                    chemical weapons. Marty, I m sorry. 
                    You re my friend--

                                  MARTY VOYT
                    Let me get on the phone with Mel 
                    Thomas over at the Bureau, find out 
                    what the hell is going on. You go 
                    home. I ll call you in two hours.                                                                                     17.


      Marty exits.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      VINCE lays in bed, still in his clothes. DANA sleeps beside 
      him. The clock reads 5:45 AM. Vince closes his eyes.

    The phone RINGS. Vince answers immediately.

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                    Yeah?

                                                                            CUT TO:


      VINCE gasps awake. He s tied to a chair. 

      CHESS sits in front of him. He wears a tight black mask over 
    his face. Only his eyes with the disturbing contact lenses 
    are visible. There is a chess board in front of Vince.

      Vince looks around and sees MARTY in the shadows.

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                      Marty...what d--? 

      Marty says nothing, stares at his shoes.                                                                                    18.


                                  VINCE FARADAY (CONT'D)
                          (sees chess board, to 
                          Marty)
                    What did you do!?

                                  CHESS
                    Do you play Chess?

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                          (looks at Chess, slowly)
                    I m...not good.

                                  CHESS
                    I ask because you have an 
                    aggressive opening. In the game I d 
                    call it a Latvian Gambit. You 
                    forced me to finetunesome things. 

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                    What s the plan for the VX?

                                  CHESS
                    But we re in the Middlegame.Pawns 
                    become crucial. And out of your 
                      inexperience, you left your 
                      king...vulnerable.

      Vince absorbs this. Thinks of his family.

                                  CHESS (CONT'D)
                    My life is a chess game that I play 
                    against myself. I m a little like 
                    Lancelot on the bridge. Waiting for 
                    the one who will challenge me. 

      Chess pulls off his mask TO REVEAL...

      ...PETER FLEMING- Chairman and CEO of Lynx Corporation.

      Vince s jaw falls open. LYNX TROOPS step forward from the 
      shadows. Peter Fleming removes the Chess contact lenses. 

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                          (stunned)
                    No...no...

                                  PETER FLEMING
                    Chess must pay for his crimes.

      Peter Fleming hands the Chess mask to Marty and a Lynx thug. 
      They smear glue all through the fabric.                                                                                    19.


                                  PETER FLEMING (CONT'D)
                    Lynx will make him pay. And when 
                    they do, the Mayor will turn over 
                    the police to me.
                          (beat)
                    And when the Coroner s report is 
                    released to the press it will be 
                    your skin they find under Chief s 
                    Ross s fingernails.

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                    Please don t. I ve got a family--

                                  PETER FLEMING 
                    This is check, Vince.

      Peter Fleming nods. Marty and the Lynx thugs hold Vince--

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                    No! No! 

    The Chess mask is forced over Vince s head and face.

                                  PETER FLEMING
                    You have one move left.
                          (beat)
                    Run.

                                        ACT TWO

      TITLE: THE CARNIVAL OF CRIME


      Coffee brews. Dana fixes TRIP his breakfast. The TV is on 
      with the sound down. There are images of the police chase 
      happening at the rail yard. 

    The chyronon TV reads: BREAKING NEWS - LYNX SECURITY 
      PERSONNEL PURSUING SUSPECT IN  CHESS  MURDERS...

                                  DANA
                          (to Trip)
                    Oatmeal, okay?

                                  TRIP
                          (groggy)
                    Sure.
                          (beat)
                    Where s Dad?

                                  DANA
                    I don t know, hon.He must vebeen 
                    called in to work.

                          (watches TV)
                    Hey Mom. I think they caught Chess.

      Dana notices the TV for the first time. She turns it up.

                                  REPORTER (V.O.)
                    ...very fluid situation developing. 
                    Lynx Security Personnel are in 
                    pursuit of a suspect in the  Chess  
                    murders. The suspect is on foot in 
                    the Palm City rail yard.                                                                                    21.


                                  TRIP
                          (hopeful)
                    Is that where Dad is?

                                  DANA
                          (brightens)
                    Maybe.


      DANA continues with TRIP s breakfast, glancing at the TV. 
      Trip watches - fascinated.

                                  DANA
                    Why don t we turn that off? 

                                  TRIP
                    No!

                                  DANA
                    Honey, they sometimes have to shoot 
                    the person, I don t want--

                                  REPORTER (V.O.)
                    ...okay, there is new information--
                      we re--News 7 has learned -- we re 
                    being told the suspect is Police 
                    Sergeant - former Police Sergeant -
                    Vince Faraday.

                                  TRIP
                          (confused)
                    Why did she say that?

                                  DANA
                          (fixing Trip s plate)
                    What, hon?

                                  TRIP
                    They said Dad was Chess.

                                  DANA
                          (looks over)
                    They said what?                                                                                    22.


                                  TRIP
                            (frightened)
                    She said Dad.

      Dana turns up the TV.

                                  DANA 
                    That was a mistake. You didn t hear 
                    it, right. 

      With shaking hands, Dana fumbles for the phone, dialing 
      Vince s cellphone.

                                  TRIP
                    Mom, what--?

                                  DANA 
                    Quiet Trip!

      Suddenly, a black and white PHOTOGRAPH OF VINCE flashes on 
    the screen with the chyron: CHESS SUSPECT.

      Dana drops the phone. Hands over her mouth. Pure horror.

                                  TRIP
                          (in tears)
                    Why are they saying that?! Mom?!

                                  DANA
                          (whispers)
                    It s a mistake, it s a mistake--

                                  TRIP 
                          (looks at TV)
                    Are they gonnakill him?

      Dana takes hold of Trip in a primal embrace, terror-filled 
      eyes locked on the screen.

                                  DANA
                          (tries to cover Trip s 
                          eyes)
                    Don t watch. Don t watch. It s a 
                    mistake! They just got it wrong!

                                  TRIP
                          (crying)
                    Why are they chasing him!?


      DANA screams and holds TRIP to her chest as the TV screen 
      fills with images of the explosion - their lives - in an 
      instant - turned inside out.


      PETER FLEMING smiles for the cameras. Waves.

                                  REPORTER (V.O.)
                    In related news Lynx stock rose to 
                      40-dollars-a-share--

      Click. Screen goes black. A gaunt, exhausted DANA takes her 
      coffee and trudges up the stairs.


      DANA knocks softly.

                                  DANA
                          (whispers)
                    Trip, honey?

      TRIP lays in bed. Reading his CAPE COMIC. 

                                  DANA (CONT'D)
                          (whispers)
                    Sweetie, you want breakfast?

      Trip doesn t respond. Just reads his comic.

                                  DANA (CONT'D)
                    Take all the time you need. Will 
                    you eat a little something for 
                    Mommy later?

      Trip nods a little.

                                  DANA (CONT'D)
                          (smiles, thankful for any 
                            response)
                    Okay, hon.I love you.                                                                                    25.


      Dana shuts the door. Then...she loses it. She GASPS into her 
      hand and SOBS. Doesn t want Trip to hear. She heads for the 
      stairs. Coming apart at the seams.

      There is a KNOCK at the door.

      Dana recovers. Wipes her eyes. Heads downstairs. She opens 
    the door. It s MARTY VOYT. Pale. Ashen.

                                  MARTY VOYT
                          (tears in his eyes)
                    Dana...

      Seeing any kind of friendly face, Dana crumbles into his 
      arms. 

                                  MARTY VOYT (CONT'D)
                          (holds her)
                    I wish I knew what to say. I don t 
                    know what to say. I m so sorry. 
                          (beat)
                    This is a nightmare.

      Marty looks up...

      ...and sees TRIP staring down at him from the top of the 
      stairs. Marty tries to convey sympathy to Trip but there s 
      something about the boy s eyes that for a moment - shake 
      Marty. Marty s eyes show just a trace of menace.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Total blackness. WE HEAR rustling. Murmurs. Then...

                                  VOICE
                          (gravelly)
                    Wake him up.

      POW! Vince s eyes blink open. The first thing he sees is a 
      MUSCULAR LITTLE PERSON - about three feet tall - in a wife-
      beater-t-shirt, standing on a chair, reaching back with a 
      balled fist ready to BELT Vince again.

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                    M awake.
                          (clears his throat)
                    I m awake.

                    Rollo.                                                                                    26.


    The little person - ROLLO - climbs down from the chair, 
      glares at Vince.

      Vince takes in the EXOTIC CREW before him. There are POSTERS 
    and dusty FRAMED PHOTOS of their traveling circus personas. 
      Rollo - the Little Person Strongman/Clown in his white makeup 
      alongside an East Indian in a shiny blue turban. The Animal 
      Trainer - RAIA - in her garish leather costume. Vince fits 
      right in with the Chess mask still half-glued to his face. 

    In their civilian clothes, the Carnival still strikes a 
      fairly odd note. 

    The leader of this group is showman/magician/escape-artist 
      (once extraordinaire) MAX MALINI (60s). Max has a faded-Errol-
      Flynn-feel about him. He taps pills into his hand and washes 
      them down with a swig of red wine. 

                                  MAX MALINI (CONT'D)
                          (to Vince)
                    211. On the nose. Am I right?

                          (groggy)
                    Where am I?

      Rollo SMACKS Vince.

                                  ROLLO
                    Answer him, jerkface.He s guessing 
                    your weight. Two-eleven! Is he 
                    right?

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                          (confused)
                    That sounds...yeah. About right.

      There is scattered applause. 

                                  RAIA
                          (to Vince)
                    He s never wrong.

                                  MAX MALINI
                    I never miss.
                          (beat)
                    So you re Chess, eh?

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                    I m not Chess--

    The group LAUGHS.                                                                                    27.


                                  MAX MALINI
                    Is there egg on my face? Whatever 
                    gave me that impression?

      Rollo POPS on the TV across the room. There is wall-to-wall-
      coverage...

                                  REPORTER (V.O.)
                      ...authoritiescontinue to gather 
                    evidence after the explosion that 
                    appears to have taken the life of 
                    Vince Faraday, aka: Chess...

    We see VINCE S PHOTO alongside of police sketches of Chess. 
    TV pops off.

                                  MAX MALINI 
                          (turns back)
                    Whoops!

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                    I was framed...I was...
                          (beat)
                    Look, you want the truth? Chess is 
                    Peter Fleming.

      There is LAUGHTER. 

                                  VINCE FARADAY (CONT'D)
                    He is!
                          (beat)
                    Fine. Whatever. What do you want? 

                                  MAX MALINI
                    Money, you poor, slow-thinking man! 
                    We are the Carnival of Crime! We 
                    are professional bank robbers! Now 
                    are you worth anything to me or 
                    not? Because I m getting thirsty!

      Rollo pours Max another cup of wine. Max drinks. Scowls.

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                    I m just a cop.

      There is a GROAN from the gang.

                                  MAX MALINI
                    Wrong answer! Rollo!

      Rollo drops the barbells, climbs up onto the chair and BELTS 
      Vince again.                                                                                    28.


                                  MAX MALINI (CONT'D)
                    We hate cops! They arrest people 
                    like us!

                                  RAIA
                    Max, you re screaming.

                                  MAX MALINI
                          (to Raia)
                    I m using my stage voice!
                          (toVince, quieter)
                    When you were Chess you were 
                    interesting. Now you re boring.
                          (toRuvi, Rollo)
                    Dump him in the desert. Cut the 
                    fingers off. Head too, I guess.

                                  RAIA
                    But he s cute.

    The Carnival takes this in stride. 

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                    Wait! Just...wait.

                    I m a cop...who happens to know

                    schedule and personnel shift for 
                    the Palm City branch of Lynx

                    Check my pockets.

    Max nods. Rollo goes through Vince s pockets. Pulls out a set 
    of keys.

                                  VINCE FARADAY (CONT'D)
                    Those are bypass keys. Fit into 
                    alarm keypads to bypass security 
                    codes. 
                          (beat)

                          (beat)
                    Now how much is my life worth?

    Max stares at Vince. Takes a gulp of wine. Smiles.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      A JANITOR wheels his cart down a long, dark hallway.                                                                                     29.


      CLOSE AS: A GLOVED HAND sticks Vince s key into the code 
      keypad. The key turns. The keypad lights go dark. WE HEAR a 
      door open.

    WE FOLLOW: RAIA S RACCOON who lopes purposefully down the 
      hallway. THE JANITOR heads down another hall in the distance.

                                                                            CUT TO:


    MAX MALINI dumps BRICKS OF CASH onto the table.

                    Ladies and gentlemen we have a 
                    winner!

    The CARNIVAL GANG applauds. VINCE lingers in the background. 
      RAIA sidles closer to Vince, nuzzling her RACCOON. 

    Max points his gold-tipped-cane at Vince. Nods approvingly.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      PETER FLEMING sits at his desk watching SECURITY VIDEO 
      FOOTAGE of Raia s RACCOON loping down the hallway, one paw 
      lugging a suitcase of cash.

      MARTY VOYT stands behind Fleming with SEVERAL SECURITY TECHS.
      Fleming is not pleased. He freezes the image of the raccoon.

                                  PETER FLEMING
                          (dripping sarcasm)
                    Do we think the raccoon acted

                                  PETER FLEMING
                    How much did it take?

                                  MARTY VOYT
                    Around eighty...thousand.

                                  PETER FLEMING
                    That would buy a lot of pinecones. 
                    Find these comedians. I ll deficit 
                    the eighty from your pay. As

      VINCE sits on a cot. He holds a PHONE to his ear, working up 
    the courage to dial. The TV drones in the background.

      Vince turns to the TV MAX MALINI curls around the corner.

                                  MAX MALINI 
                          (re: TV, sarcastic)
                    See? You really are Chess.

                    Explain to them that you re not 
                      dead...that you didn t kill ten 
                    people...and drag them through two 
                    years of criminal trials ending in 
                    your conviction and eventual 
                    execution. Or Peter Fleming just 
                    kills them.
                    They re safer with you gone. As 
                    simple as that. 

      Vince kicks the table over.

                                  VINCE FARADAY 
                    Then I ll kill Peter Fleming.

                                  MAX MALINI
                    You won t get to him. If you do 
                    another like him rises to take his 
                    place. Lynx is bigger than one man.

                    The press. They re in his pocket!

                    Take his damn money. That s how you 
                    take him down. That s how you take 
                    down Lynx. Cut off their money. And

    the Palm City bank. CUSTOMERS dive under desks and onto the 
      floor. There are SCREAMS of panic.

                                  ROLLO
                    Everybody down!

    THE MASKED CREW goes about their business. MAX up-ends a LYNX 
      GUARD with his gold-tipped-cane. WE SWING AROUND TO...

      ...VINCE - who guards the door - wearing his own ski mask. 

                                  DANA (O.S.)
                          (whispers)
                    Honey, get down...honey...

      Vince turns and sees...

      ...TRIP, standing in front of him, frozen with fear. DANA is 
    on the floor reaching for Trip. She sees Vince see him...

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                          (steps forward)
                    It s okay--

                                  DANA
                    Stay away from him!

      Rollo PIVOTS around aiming the shotgun.

                                  ROLLO
                    On your faces!

                          (to Rollo)
                    No!                                                                                    34.


      Dana slowly pulls Trip into her arms. 

                                  TRIP
                          (crying)
                    I wish the Cape were real, mama. I 
                    wish he were real. 

      Vince stands there. Helpless. Ashamed. Until POLICE SIRENS.

                                  MAX MALINI (O.S.)
                    Hello?! We are leaving!

      Vince turns to see THE CREW waiting for him. Vince shakes out 
    of his daze, throws one last look back at his family as we...

                                                                            CUT TO:


    MAX sits at his desk with bricks of cash beside him. Max 
      hands ROLLO a brick. Rollo heads out as VINCE enters...

                                  MAX MALINI
                    Next!
                          (writes on a clipboard)
                    Mr. Faraday.

    Max slides a stack of bills.

                                  MAX MALINI (CONT'D)
                    A little more focus next gig, yes?
                          (looksup from his notes)
                    You re not getting them back. I 
                    know who that was in the bank 
                    today. I m not an idiot.

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                    Palm City is my home. And it s been 
                    taken over by madmen. There is no 
                    law. There s only...

                                  MAX MALINI
                    What? Only what? You?

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                    I m still his father, Max, don t 
                    you understand? I have to show 
                    him...that he isn t alone. Send him 
                    a message.

                                  MAX MALINI
                    What message?                                                                                    35.

                    That it s not all corrupt. That one 
                    man...can still make a difference.

                                  MAX MALINI
                          (dubious)
                    Show him? How?

                                                                            CUT TO:


      VINCE is alone in a vast shadowy space. Dust swirls in the 
      moonlight that invades through the patchwork circus tent. 
      Vince sweats. He s taped chair legs - substitute truncheons - 
    to his forearms and assails one of the thick tent posts with 
      fast and hard BLOWS. It creates a RAT-A-TAT-TAT sound that 
      echoes through the space. Again. RAT-A-TAT-TAT. Again until 
    one of the chair legs BREAKS IN TWO.

      Vince tears it off his arm, frustrated. He turns to the rest 
    of the storage area. The walls are covered in old costumes, 
      handcuffs, broken magic cabinets, pieces of water tanks, 
      horse whips, clown toys and...

      ...Vince stops at Max s locker. Hanging from a nail is a 
      simple BLACK CAPE. Vince takes the cape off the nail sending 
      glistening dust into the air as it unfurls. Vince holds the 
      fabric in his hands.

      FLASH ON:

      Vince lays in bed with his son...

      FLASH ON:

      Vince stares intently at the black cape in his hands...

      FLASH ON:

      Vince pulls out the wrinkled comic book as Trip snuggles into 
    his father s arms...

      FLASH ON:

      Vince wraps an end of the black cape in each fist...something 
      dawning in his eyes...

      FLASH ON:

      Trip s eyes light up as Vince turns the page of the comic to 
      a full-page-spread of the superhero THE CAPEleaping across a 
      nighttime city-scape...                                                                                    36.


      FLASH ON:

      VINCE ducks down and SWIRLS the black cape over his head. 
      Pivots and crouches concealing himself in the cape...an 
      insane idea forming...Vince SLAMS the tent post with the 
      unbroken chair leg on his arm and WHIRLS around into a 
      crouch, the cape concealing all of Vince s face but his 
      burning eyes as we...

                                                                            CUT TO:


    WE PAN ACROSS a wall of framed photos and posters advertising 
       Max Malini s terrifying escapes and acts of stupendous 
      survival.  VINCE sits across from MAX. Max holds the old cape 
    in his hands.

                                  MAX MALINI 
                    Haven t seen this old rag in years.
                          (considerswhat Vince has 
                          asked him)
                    That would be...quite an act.

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                    Is it possible?

    Max stands up with the cape.

                                  MAX MALINI
                    I ve broken ninety-two bones in 
                    pursuit of the perfect illusion. 
                    Trained generations of escapists, 
                    acrobats and magicians. I 
                    specialize in impossible.

    Max SNAPS out the Cape and it WRAPS around a glass on another 
      table and WHIPS back. Max catches the glass.

                                  MAX MALINI (CONT'D)
                    But I do nothing halfway. It s all 
                    or nothing. You ll feel pain you ve 
                    never felt. I ll work you to the 
                    bone and beyond. You give me your 
                    soul...
                          (beat)
                    ...and I ll make you the greatest 
                    circus act that ever lived.

      With that, Max throws the cape around his body. There is an 
      EXPLOSION OF SMOKE and Max seemingly vanishes into thin air.                                                                                    37.

    THE CREW hoots and hollers as VINCE squares off against ROLLO 
    in a boxing ring.

                          (trash talking Rollo)
                    Let s see how tough you are when 
                    I m not tied to a chair, huh?

                                  ROLLO
                    Bring it, bitch boy.

      Vince lunges for Rollo who somersaults through Vince s legs, 
      whirls around and takes Vince down with an ankle-drag. He 
      WRENCHES Vince s ankle in a vice-like-grip. Vince writhes on 
    the ground.

                                  ROLLO (CONT'D)
                    Tap out! Tap out, bitch!

      Vince TAPS...

      MOMENTS LATER...

      Vince and Rollo rush at each other. Vince KICKS at Rollo who 
      CATCHES Vince s leg, SWEEPS the other leg and DROPS a nasty 
      elbow right onto Vince s balls.

      Vince curls up like a dead spider. The Crew GROANS in 
      sympathy. Rollo raises his arms - victorious. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      RUVI - the cranky East Indian Mentalist - sits across from 
      VINCE at a table. Ruvi fiddles with a toothpick on the table 
    as he imparts his wisdom to Vince.

                                  RUVI
                    In Mentalism, the point is to not 
                    let the sucker know he s getting 
                      hypnotized, right? You talk about 
                    the weather,  oh my wife give me 
                    hard time,  you move his eye...

      Vince glances at the toothpick and back at Ruvi.                                                                                    38.

                    into his mind...into his very 
                      soul...it s in the way you 
                    talk...the tone of your 
                    voice...your hands and how they 
                    move...
                          (breathes)
                    Your breathing. Lulling the dumb 
                    bastard into a state of 
                        utmost...suggestibility...

      Vince s lids flutter as Ruvi SLAMS the table. 

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                          (jolts)
                    What was that?

                                  RUVI
                    I just hypnotize you, sucker.

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                    Yeah, right.

                                  RUVI
                    Then why you wearin girlie
                    panties, Vince?

      Vince stares at Ruvi for a beat. Then, slowly, Vince s eyes 
      look down at his jeans. Vince looks back at Ruvi - deeply 
      suspicious. Then Vince unbuttons his jeans and peeks and...

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                          (to Ruvi)
                    That is not cool, Ruvi!

      Ruvi CACKLES with glee. Vince stands up, re-buttoning his 
      jeans, freaked completely.

                                  VINCE FARADAY (CONT'D)
                    Not cool!

                    Gimmea hundred bucks and I won t

      VINCE stares down from the trapeze platform 100-feetto the 
      hard ground. POPO THE ACROBAT - a compact Korean man - stands 
      next to him.                                                                                    39.


                                  VINCE FARADAY
                          (to Popo)
                    Where s the net?

                                  POPO
                    Nets are for girls. No net make you 
                    think harder.

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                    You people are insane.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      VINCE sweats. He TWIRLS the cape. MAX shouts commands.

                                  MAX MALINI
                    Spin! Spin! Spin! And snap it!

      Vince FLINGS the cape which SNAPS OUT and SNATCHES an empty 
      glass from the top of a stool and WINGS back at Vince s hand. 
      Vince almost catches the glass. Vince looks up at Max.

                                  MAX MALINI (CONT'D)
                    Again.

                                                                            CUT TO:


    MAX holds a small capsule up to VINCE s eye. Max throws the 
      capsule on the ground. There is a BURST OF SMOKE.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      VINCE works on a dented laptop. He scrolls through 
      information on UNCONVENTIONAL and ASSYMETRICALWAREARE.

      There are files on DEMOLITIONS and CONCEALMENT, PSYCHOLOGICAL 
      WARFARE. Vince writes in a notebook...

                                                                            CUT TO:


      VINCE tips forward and FREE-FALLS from the trapeze platform - 
      swan-diving - until CAPTURING the swing as it comes at him. 
      Vince goes up and up and...

        ...BACKFLIPSthrough the air CATCHING the other swing. All 
      without a net.                                                                                    40.


      Vince lands safely on the other platform. POPO gives him a 
      thumb s up.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      RUVI and VINCE sit across from each other. Ruvi s eyes drift 
    for a second as Vince SLAMS the table.

                                  RUVI
                          (recovers)
                    You wish, sucker.

      Vince pulls on his shirt collar. Smiles.

      Ruvi feels his shirt collar. Looks down at his shirt buttons. 
      Unbuttons his shirt. Opens his shirt TO REVEAL...

      ...A BRA. Double D.

                                  VINCE FARADAY
                    Gimmea hundred bucks and I don t 
                    tell the crew.

      Ruvi LAUGHS. Vince LAUGHS as Ruvi reaches across the table 
    and PUNCHES Vince off his chair.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Back in the boxing ring. VINCE has a bloody nose. ROLLO s got 
      a cut under his eye. They circle each other.

      Rollo lunges but Vince drops to his stomach, catches Rollo by 
    the waist in a SCISSORS-CLUTCH. Rollo squirms. Escapes. Dives 
    at Vince who break-dance-pivots and RE-CAPTURES Rollo by the 
      leg. YANKS on the ankle. TWISTS.

                    Now youtap!

      Rollo fights and fights but finally relents TAPPING OUT to 
    the crew s CHEERS. Vince falls back, exhausted.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      VINCE studies a FLOW CHART that he has constructed on his 
      wall with PETER FLEMING at the top of it.                                                                                     41.


      LYNX CORPORATION and CHESS occupy the spaces beneath Peter 
      Fleming representing his criminal and corporate empires. 
      Vince searches for weaknesses.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      VINCE wields the cape like it s a living thing, a whip-like-
      shadow, SNAPPING across the room. 

    MAX watches, following each move. Focused. 

      Vince SNUFFS a candle flame with the cape which STREAKS back 
    and RIPS a knife from the hand of a mannequin and FLINGS the 
      knife into a BULLSEYETARGET across the trailer before... 

      ...wrapping up Vince like a corpse. There is an EXPLOSION OF 
      SMOKE and...

      ...Vince is gone. The cape drops harmlessly to the floor. Max 
      sits back on the table. Impressed.

                                  MAX MALINI

      TITLE: THE CAPE


      TECHNO-POP throbs in every ear as champagne flows and glamed-
      up-CLUB-GIRLSshake it for the POWER ELITE of Palm City.

      It s like cowboy Moscow. Oligarchs of industry with too much 
      money on their hands.


    TWO PLAIN-CLOTHES, LYNX TROOPS push a COUPLE DRUNK CLUB GIRLS 
      down the corridor.

                                  CLUB GIRL #1
                    Quit shoving already!

    The men LAUGHS. 


      PETER FLEMING types at his computer as...

      ...THE TROOPER explodes through his floor-to-ceiling plate 
      glass window. Fleming dives to the ground as shattered glass 
      sprays everywhere. The Trooper FLOPS onto the ground.

      Fleming crawls over to the Trooper s body. Finds the note.                                                                                     45.


    It reads:  Endgame. Where the pawn becomes King. I know what 
    you really are. The Cape. 

      Peter Fleming sits back against his desk. He looks out the 
      window, eyes aflame with fury and excitement.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      PETER FLEMING hunches over his desk. The light is eerie. The

      Peter Fleming looks up with his chess-piece-contacts in his

      RAIA is forced into the back of a limousine by LYNX COPS. 
      Inside the limousine is MARTY VOYT...

      Chess examines a yellowing business card for MAX MALINI S 
      FANTASTIC ODDITIES AND AMAZEMENTS. He studies a small key.

                                  MARTY VOYT

                    That s how they re getting around

                          Chess)

      Marty and the Lynx Guard look at each other nervously. 
      Obviously this wasn t part of their plans either.

    The usually tough Raia pales. She believes him.

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    48.



    THE CAPE kicks and panics as the pylon ROCKETS to the bottom 
    and lands with an audible THUD. The Cape writhes and swallows 
      water. WE HEAR his heartbeat HAMMERING.

    WE FLASH on STUTTERING IMAGES of MAX MALINI...RUVI THE 
        MENTALIST...Vince doing meditations...

    WE FLASH on The Cape slowing down, relaxing his body. WE HEAR 
    his heartbeat SLOWING.

    WE FLASH on MAX vanishing in a burst of smoke...Ruvi SLAMS 
    the table...WE HEAR voices...commands...

    WE FLASH on The Cape. He is utterly still. His body rests, 
      corpse-like, on the bottom. His heartbeat slows to a stop. 

    The images fade. Voices fade. The Cape is completely still. 

        Until...WHAM.The Cape JERKS his body - dislocating his own 
      shoulder. The extra slack allows him to work free of the 
      chains. Bubbles pour forth from his mouth as he slides the 
      chains off like a snakeskin and claws for the surface...

                                                                            CUT TO:


    MAX MALINI secures a few bricks of cash in his safe. A 
      distant train WHISTLES. Then...a KNOCK on his door.

                                  MAX MALINI
                    This is my private drinking time! 
                    This better be...

    Max opens the door for FOUR LYNX TROOPS.

                      Gentlemen...join me for a drink, 
                    won t you?

    Out of sight of the Lynx Troops, Max PULLS on a hidden cord 
    in an old clock beside the door that...


      ...reaches underground, through a system of pipes and into 
    the Carnival s secret tunnels. ROLLO and RUVI look up at the 
      RINGING BELL - an alarm.

                                  ROLLO
                    They got Max.


      A TROOPER shoves MAX hard against the wall and BELTS him. 
      He s taken roughly by the arms and led out of the trailer.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      parking lot. The Cape hangs on tight - a little worried - as 
      Orwell speeds up taking turn after turn finally SQUEALING to

                    button for your window.

      Vince takes off his glove. Flips the button for the window. 
    But instead of the window moving - BEHIND THEM - the doors 
      seal shut and the elevator LIFTS.

                    That was cool.

      When the doors - re-open. Orwell throws the car in REVERSE 
    and peels out into a completely bare, top-floor, floor-wide 
      penthouse view space above Palm City. Orwell stops.

    The Cape sweeps across the room and SWATS Orwell s computer 
      onto the floor where it SHATTERS.

    MAX MALINI squints from the bright lights in his eyes. He s 
      tied to a chair surrounded by LYNX GOONS lingering in the 
      shadows. He hears a door open. Hears footsteps as...

      ...CHESS steps into the light. Sits in front of Max.

                                  CHESS

      A Goon PINS Max s arm to the arm of the chair. Chess reveals 
      a BRICK in his hand. He SLAMS it down on Max s hand.

                    Then you two have a lot of catching

      TITLE: THE CAPE VS.CHESS - ROUND ONE


    MAX MALINI S head droops over his shirt. Blood drips from his 
      lips. CHESS paces, frustrated, sleeves rolled up.

                                  CHESS
                    Don t die, Max. I need names.

                                  MAX MALINI
                    Die?

    Max lifts his head with effort. His face is a mess. Brutal.

                                  MAX MALINI (CONT'D)
                          (smiles)
                    Just getting warmed up, sweetheart. 

                                  CHESS
                          (to Marty Voyt)
                    Bring him in here.

      MARTY VOYT turns paler than usual and exits.

                                  MAX MALINI
                    Peter! 

      Chess turns, livid.

                                  MAX MALINI (CONT'D)
                    Didn t Mummy love you enough? What 
                    did she do to you that made you 
                    such a raving loon?
                          (beat)
                    The Cape s gonnaget you, boyo.

                                  CHESS
                          (his cool falters)
                    Shut up!

    The door opens. The light frames a MASSIVE FORM as...

      ...GATOR enters. Takes off his sunglasses. 

                                  MAX MALINI 
                          (spots Gator)
                    Whatever he s paying you I ll 
                    double it. 

      Gator CHUCKLES. Cracks his knuckles.                                                                                    58.


                                  MAX MALINI (CONT'D)
                    I mean it, son. You re playing for 
                    the wrong team. I ll make you a 
                    star. 

                                  CHESS
                          (to Gator)
                    Tear his arms off and beat him to 
                    death with them.

                                  GATOR
                    Sweet.

      Gator approaches.

                                  MAX MALINI
                          (disapproving)
                    Doesn t anyone value showmanship 
                    anymore?

    Max POPS his shoulder. His other arm WRIGGLES free. With 
      shocking speed, Max flings a chair at Gator s head, vaults 
    the table and DIVES through the door to the stairwell. 


    MAX drags himself to his feet, limping terribly. 

      CHESS and GATOR surge up the stairs. Chess pulls a gun and 
      FIRES after the fleeing Max who...

      ...darts into a cityscapeof shipping crates.

                                  CHESS
                    Find him! He s one old man!


    MAX hobbles along. His hand leaves a BLOOD IMPRINT on one of 
    the crates. He s been hit.

    He WHEEZES and staggers. Searching for escape with 
      increasingly blurry vision.

    He drops to a knee. Recovers. His eyes go to a HUGE WINDOW at 
    the end of the corridor. Max shuffles towards it as...

      ...TWO LYNX TROOPS step into his path holding rifles.

                                  LYNX TROOP #1
                    Abracadabra, Pops.

      A SHADOW rises in the window, behind the Lynx Troops...                                                                                    59.


                                  MAX MALINI
                          (sees the shadow, 
                            whispers)
                    Presto.

      ...asTHE CAPE explodes through the window and falls upon the 
      Lynx Troops like a bird of prey. There are STUTTERED GUNSHOTS 
      then silence as unconscious bodies hit the floor.

    Max BUCKLES into The Cape s arms.

                                  THE CAPE
                    Max! 

    The Cape sees the blood. Sees Max s beaten face.

                                  THE CAPE (CONT'D)
                    It s okay, don t try to talk.

                                  MAX MALINI
                          (through bloody lips)
                    I m the one dying here. I like to 
                    talk.

    The Cape eases Max to the floor.

                    At least you ve...gotten yourself 
                    an act. What you said about your 
                      boy...about showing him that one 
                    man can make a difference. That 
                    stayed with me.
                          (beat)
                    Just take this from a man who never 
                    knew his father and never had a 
                    son...that bond...it s what makes 
                    heroes...
                          (beat)
                    Don t make me a jerk. Get your boy 
                    back. 

                                  THE CAPE
                    I will, Max.

                                  MAX MALINI
                    Want to say something 
                    profound...last words and all 
                      but...God...I really need a drink.

    Max stops. His eyes close. The Cape lays him down gently. 
      Puts a hand on Max s chest. Then...

      ...Max opens one eye.                                                                                    60.

                    Damn it...I thought that was it.

                          (surprised, relieved)
                    Max?

                                  MAX MALINI
                    And I wasted that great speech.

      A bustling news room. THE LOCAL NEWS DIRECTOR takes a phone

                    the Palm City Piers. Shots fired in 
                      a warehouse owned by Peter Fleming.


      MARTY VOYT runs down the corridor of the warehouse.

                                  MARTY VOYT

      Suddenly, something BLACK shoots out of the darkness and 
      wraps around Marty s ankle, YANKING him off his feet. Marty 
      turns - terrified - to the DARK SHADOWS as he drags slowly 
      towards them...                                                                                    61.

                      tunnel...they see darkness...they 
                    see me.

      Marty SCREAMS like a stuck pig as he VANISHES into the 
      shadows and we hear a few seriously PAINFUL BLOWS.


    TWO LYNX TROOPS enter a tunnel in the warehouse but don t see 
      POPO THE ACROBAT wedged in the ceiling above their heads. 
      Popo DROPS on top of them swinging a bo-stick.


      A LYNX CAPTAIN jogs up to CHESS and A LYNX OFFICER.

                                  LYNX CAPTAIN
                          (to Chess)

                          (to Officer)
                    Set charges. Light it up.

    The Officer runs off. The Captain s radio SQUAWKS.

                                  LYNX CAPTAIN
                          (to Chess)

                    Roof s this way.

      Chess and the Lynx Captain head for the stairway.

      ACROSS THE WAREHOUSE:

      GATOR stalks the corridors. Hears SHOTS echo off the walls. 
      Gator turns the corner as...

      ...a thrown WRENCH smacks off his head. Gator stumbles back 
    as ROLLO somersaults into the corridor. Cracks his own neck.

                                  ROLLO
                    You like to party, bitch?

                                  GATOR
                    Looks like you need to cook a 
                    little longer.                                                                                    62.


      Rollo pulls a LEAD PIPE. He walks up and CRACKS Gator right 
    in the kneecap. Gator ROARS in pain as Rollo SPINS and POPS 
    the lead pipe off Gator s shin bone. Gator collapses onto his 
      hands and knees. Rollo hauls off and WHACKS Gator in the jaw 
      with the pipe. Sharp teeth go flying...

      ELSEWHERE IN THE WAREHOUSE:

      MARTY and his TROOPS set timers on EXPLOSIVES. Set them for 
    two minutes. The countdown begins...2:00...1:59...1:58...


      ORWELL ducks bullets and races around towers of shipping 
      containers. She pulls up fast when she sees...

      ...the EXPLOSIVES. The countdown: 20...19...18...

                                  ORWELL
                          (into radio)

                    You too, Orwell. But now you re the 
                    mystery. Who are you anyway?

      Orwell looks down at an OPEN DRAWER in her desk. There, 
      discarded like an ashtray, is a small framed photo of ORWELL, 
    in happier times, with her father: a smiling PETER FLEMING. 
      Orwell shuts the drawer.

      Trip sits up. Looks out the window. Opens the window. Hears 
      FLAPPING and sees the wind rustling the pages of a new CAPE 
      comic book on the fire escape. 

      Trip smiles, reaches for it as...

                                  THE CAPE (O.S.)
                    Are you Trip Faraday?

      Trip WHIRLS around and looks up and sees...

      ...THE CAPE balanced on the railing of the fire escape, his 
      cloak billowing in the wind behind him.

      Trip - his mouth dry - can only nod.

                                  THE CAPE (CONT'D)
                    You read my comic?

      Trip nods.                                                                                    65.


                                  THE CAPE (CONT'D)
                    I knew your father. 
                          (pause)
                    He was a good cop. And he was 
                    framed for those crimes.

      Unbelievable relief washes over Trip.

                                  THE CAPE (CONT'D)
                    I know the guilty. And I won t stop 
                    until they know justice.
                          (pause)
                    Your father wanted me to give you a 
                    message. He said,  don t lose hope. 
                    Never lose hope.  He said  be good 
                    to your Mom and study your math. 
                    You need to work on the math. 

      Trip nods, sounds like his Dad all right.

                                  THE CAPE (CONT'D (CONT'D)
                    And tell him,  I love him more than 
                    anything. And someday...someday
                    we ll see each other again. 

    In the distance a police siren WAILS. Trip turns to look. He 
      turns back and...

      ...THE CAPE is gone. Trip goes to the edge of the railing. 
      Stares out into the night. Hope in his eyes as we...

                                                                  FADE TO BLACK:
