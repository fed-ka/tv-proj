                        Pretty full'a yourself, aren't
                        ya?

                        up to you we'd be sleepin' in the
                        car again.

          James SLAPS him hard across the face.

                                        YOUNG GREG (CONT'D)
                          I thought --

          Another slap, more vicious than the first.

                        Sass me again.

          Greg considers the challenge, his eyes raging at his
          father.  He can't help himself --

                                        YOUNG GREG
                        Y'owe me two dollars.

          A third slap.  Greg's mouth starts to bleed.

                                        30-ISH JAMES
                        You got one hard head, boy.

          James slips on his cap and walks away, as Greg wipes the
          trickle of blood from the corner of his mouth and sees
          the girl looking at him through the window, humiliation
          now compounding his pain...

          on the phone.

                        Don't worry Congressman, if he's
                        on the move, he won't evade
                          detection for very long.

                        I'm already here in D.C. -- the

                        It's not so much me I'm worried
                        about, it's my staff.  He's already
                        killed one of them.

          Stillson hangs up.  Smiles at his Dad who's been listening
          the whole time.

          They turn to see Bruce's SUV backing up after having

          in a hurry to leave.  They draw their guns...


          JOHNNY

          Watches the agents run past, then ducks out of the alley
          and heads the opposite way down the sidewalk, pulling up
          his collar.

                        Hey, man.  It's not my fault.  He

          Agent 1 peers into the car, realizing he's been duped. 
          Then he looks down the street in the direction Johnny
          went, but Johnny can no longer be seen among the various

          hit (in a perfect world:  Sting's "Every Breath You Take")
          as he parks his used Honda.  He hops out excitedly, lugging
          his bulky sample case, but his high spirits take a dive
          when he sees a familiar battered Mercury parked nearby.



          Greg and Truax head toward a waiting LIMO, James Stillson
          and Sonny Elliman following behind them.  Greg eyes his
          father, who's on his cell phone.  To Truax:

                        It's the smart move, Greg.  You
                        won't regret it.

          James hangs up and approaches Greg as Truax opens the
          limo door.

          James stops him with a hand on his chest, then starts
            straightening his tie -- a familiar controlling gesture. 
          Greg smiles tightly, then moves toward the limo.  Elliman
          speaks to James.

          large podium into place.

          Johnny runs a few yard, realizes he can't outrun Pendragon,
          and makes his way toward a CAB idling a the curb.

          Car chase, as filmed and edited.  Johnny drives wildly,
          trying to elude his pursuers, but is ultimately boxed in
          on a bridge by several government sedans.  He gets out of
          the cab, as Pendragon and the agents do likewise, guns
          drawn.  Johnny backs to the railing --

                                        PENDRAGON
                        Smith! It's over.  Put your hands

          Johnny looks over the railing, sees:

          far below.  A death jump.


          JOHNNY

          touches the railing, we hear the WHOOSH of a vision. The
          tension drains from his body -- apparently the vision
          wasn't good.  Johnny raises his hands, the fight gone out
          of him as he turns back to Pendragon.

          Johnny, dropping his cane, tumbles down toward the water.

          (Note:  To suggest that Johnny holds onto his cane, we
          can film a new close-up of him poised on the rail with
          his cane, then try to digitally add the falling cane to
          the jump.  Or, as Michael Piller suggests, we can swallow
          the continuity error and let our diehard fans have fun
            endlessly debating it.)

          watches Johnny go down.

          Johnny hits, causing a huge splash.  Then, the currents
          seem to consume him.  Stay on this view a beat too long
          for comfort; he never surfaces.

          have gathered.  Many wear "Rachel's Law" buttons.

          THE STEPS themselves are cordoned off with crowd-control

          Finding Johnny, his hair still wet, slipping on a dry old
          tattered overcoat to go with the tattered pants and
          sweatshirt as a homeless man counts a sheaf of twenties. 
          Johnny has his cane.  (We might hear a brass band not far

          realizes the ceremony is about to begin.)          DEAD ZONE: TIPPING POINT 2 - ACT TWO - 2/18/05 - PINK  27.



          Two guards pull aside a crowd control barrier to let Greg
          and Rebecca through, bypassing the security check.

          Rebecca wants to speak to Greg alone, but he's pulled
          along and she follows him up the steps, someone always
          between them.  Off the tension in her face... her hands
          gripping her purse...



          Johnny, now dressed in the tattered overcoat and hooded
          sweatshirt, approaches the crowd that's now fenced in by
          security barriers.  He sees Rebecca standing near Stillson
          on the steps as he waves to the crowd.  Johnny tries to
          move toward them but a cop, treating him like the homeless
          man he looks like, just waves him back.

                        Move along, you.

          Johnny moves away from the cop, keeping his eyes on
          Rebecca, pulls out his cellphone, it's still damp, he
          shakes it to see if it's working... he tries to dial...

          the cell phone nestled beside it RINGS again.  A beat,
          then she lets go of the gun and takes out the phone...
          sees Johnny's name once again on the screen.

          CLOSE ON REBECCA as she senses this could be the last
          time she hears Johnny's voice.  A beat, then she answers,
          still determined to go through with her plan.

                          I always liked that jacket.  The
                        color suits you.

          Caught off-guard, Rebecca looks up, her eyes scanning the
          crowd until some instinct helps her zoom in on Johnny
          standing apart from the news teams atop the grassy knoll.



          As he stares at Rebecca, holding her distant look as he
            maintains this charged electronic connection.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I know what you're doing.  I also
                        know it's going to get you killed.

                        inside, now.

          Agents hustle Stillson away.  Off Rebecca, still
          conflicted, realizing she's missed her chance...



          Sees several Deputy Marshals, guns drawn, emerging from
          the crowd, rushing toward him.  He ducks into the thicket
          of cameramen.  But as he elbows through them, banging
          directly into one specific young cameramen -- WHOOSH --



            A disorienting sequence, looking as if it was shot
            simultaneously from the POV of several news cameras --
          like the view from an insect's compound eye -- all showing
            a handcuffed Rebecca being taken out of the hotel (we
          don't see the hotel's name) as reporters shout questions.

            Realizing he hasn't stopped Rebecca's plan, only delayed
          it.  The agents are closing in.  Desperate, he looks
          around, notes more CLUMPS OF HOMELESS PEOPLE enjoying the
          mild day.  (He might grab a skicap out of a shopping cart

            Pendragon and his agents run up, then stop.  Pendragon
          quickly looks around, but from HIS P.O.V. he sees the
          same scene Johnny saw -- pedestrians, dog-walkers, groups
          of homeless people.

          Johnny, head ducked as he sits with several other homeless
          amidst shopping carts and tattered sleeping bags,
            surreptitiously watches the agents run by, oblivious.

          An ELDERLY HOMELESS WOMAN notices and smiles at him.

            A woman's HAND sticks up into frame -- until a shovel-
          full of DIRT hits it.  Revealing Elliman burying Rachel
          Caldwell's body in a shallow grave as Johnny watches.  He
          turns, sees James Stillson sitting on a rock nearby,
          sipping from a SILVER HIP FLASK as he glances over with a
          look of disgust.



          Walt's rental car bulls through traffic in a way that
          screams "cop at the wheel."



          Johnny watches Future Johnny approach his open window.

          Future Johnny props a hand on the door frame as he peers
          in at Walt, still looking purposefully ahead.

                        don't have to do anything.  Just

                        turn Rebecca into a killer.

          In response, Future Johnny takes the silver cane top from
          his pocket and holds it out to Johnny like a challenge.

                        You promised me the truth.

          But Future Johnny just shakes his head sadly.

          lies helpless on the ground...


          THE KILLER

          towers over her.  Rachel crawls backwards away from the
          man, pleading for her life; we're behind her assailant,
          his identity still obscured.

                                        RACHEL

                        this?  I didn't tell him anything --

          He picks up the camera, swings at her, knocking her back. 
          She seems almost stunned that it has happened; she reaches
          up and touches the blood on her forehead.

          Tears are in her eyes.  Another BLOW and she goes down.
          The killer turns to look around, revealing himself to be --

          Johnny watches her walk away, then...

                                        JOHNNY
                          Rebecca?

          She stops and turns...

                                        JOHNNY
                          Good-bye.

          She walks away, as Johnny turns to look at his cane, 
          leaning against the railing.  He picks it up by the
          shaft... is about to grip the top with his other hand...
          when the memory of a voice echoes in his mind.

                                        FUTURE JOHNNY (V.O.)
                        You want the answers to those big
                        questions, don't you?

          Johnny does indeed.  But, so far, his connection to the
          future, and his future self, has brought him nothing but
          pain and betrayal.

          (NOTE: alternatively, we can cut away to a black-and-white
          "memory flash" of Future Johnny saying this line in Scene
          73, but that may suggest that Johnny is having a vision
          right now, which he isn't.)

                                        JOHNNY
                        Think I need to figure it out for
                        myself.

          And with that he rears back and THROWS the cane out over
          the river.

          THE CANE

          As it arcs high, tumbling end over end as the silver top
          catches the sun, before landing in the river.

          JOHNNY

          He watches until the current carries it under the bridge.

          Only then does he look up and acknowledge his friends --
          Walt and Bruce -- waiting across the bridge near Bruce's
          car.  Bruce steps forward as Johnny approaches.

                                        BRUCE
                        You all right?

          Johnny nods, looks back toward the river.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't need it anymore.
                                (beat)
                        C'mon.  Let's go home.

          Bruce puts as hand on his shoulder.  As they walk toward
          the car, and an unknown future...

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                        END OF ACT FOUR

                                              THE END
