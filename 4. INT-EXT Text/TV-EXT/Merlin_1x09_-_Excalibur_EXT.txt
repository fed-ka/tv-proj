      (MAIN GATES) - NIGHT 1. UK/ FR.

      Looking out through the window we see...

    The BLACK KNIGHT standing motionless in perfect symmetry 
      outside the gates of Camelot, planted in the ground next to 
    him is a plain black standard.  

                                  GWEN (O.S.)
                    What does he want?

    She is cautiously standing a few steps back from the window, 
      watching the menacing stranger camped outside the castle.

                                  GWEN
                    Why would he issue such a 
                    challenge?

      MORGANA is pacing nervously...

                                  MORGANA
                          (perturbed)
                    And why did Owain of all people 
                    pick it up? Owain!

                                  GWEN
                    I know.  

                                  MORGANA
                    He s just a boy.

                                  GWEN
                    He hates anyone saying that.

      A guilty reaction on MORGANA s face. She turns to leave the 
      room.

                                                                            CUT TO:    MERLIN EPISODE NINE PRODUCTION SCRIPT AMENDED 17th JUNE 2008   6.


      GATES) - NIGHT 1. UK/ FR.

      ARTHUR too stands at the window looking at the BLACK KNIGHT, 
    he looks concerned.  There s a knock at the door. MORGANA 
      enters. 

                                  MORGANA 
                    You must stop Owain from fighting.

                                  ARTHUR
                          (annoyed - a sense that he 
                          also feels some guilt)
                    It s his damn fault. He shouldn t 
                    have picked up the gauntlet!

                                  MORGANA
                    So put an end to it. 

                                  ARTHUR
                    The challenge has been taken up. 
                    The fight cannot be stopped.

                                  MORGANA
                    So fight in his place. Much as it 
                    pains me to say it, you re the man 
                    for this job, not him.

                                  ARTHUR
                    I can t!  

                                  MORGANA
                    Why not?

                                  ARTHUR
                    Owain picked up the gauntlet, Owain 
                    is the one who must fight.  That is 
                    the Knight s code. He knew that.

                                  MORGANA
                    But he s just a boy.

                                  ARTHUR
                          (a heavy sigh)
                    I know.

                                                                            CUT TO:



    New born sunlight glints on the BLACK KNIGHT s breastplate.  
    He remains almost cemented to the ground. His standard flaps 
    in the breeze, further underlining his superhuman stillness. 
    He does not appear to have moved all night.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      A DRUMMER pounding a slow rhythm. A large CROWDwaiting 
      expectantly for the fight, dispersed amongst them are UTHER, 
      GAIUS and MORGANA. The BLACK KNIGHT stands in the centre in 
    his customary static pose. As UTHER enters the tournament 
      ground and takes his seat, the KNIGHT turns to face him 
      straight on. UTHER stares back at the KNIGHT. He looks deeply 
      troubled.  

      MERLIN and GWEN hurry to join the onlookers.

      Finally, SIR OWAIN strides out from the palace with ARTHUR at 
    his side. For the first time, the young man s nerves are 
      apparent. He walks toward the waiting BLACK KNIGHT.

                                  ARTHUR
                    Find the flow of the fight and try 
                    to control it.

      OWAIN nods, now barely able to speak. He stops a sword 
      distance from his foe. The DRUMMER s beat quickens and 
      intensifies echoing OWAIN s heartbeat.

                                  ARTHUR
                          (to both fighters)
                    The fight shall be to the Knights  
                    rules... And to the death.  

    He looks at OWAIN.  

      OWAIN puts on his helmet then lifts his sword, the BLACK 
      KNIGHT reciprocates. As they face each other, for the first 
      time, we appreciate the difference in scale between the two 
      men. It s David and Goliath.

                                  ARTHUR
                    Let battle commence.

      ARTHUR leaves the ground to take his seat by UTHER, he 
      watches the fight intensely throughout. 

      OWAIN doesn t hesitate, he lunges at the BLACK KNIGHT. In one 
      swift and easy move, the BLACK KNIGHT side steps and parries, 
      forcing OWAIN to look slightly ridiculous.

      OWAIN readjusts himself and lunges again. The BLACK KNIGHT 
      once more foils him with a deft move.  MERLIN EPISODE NINE PRODUCTION SCRIPT AMENDED 17th JUNE 2008   11.


      ARTHUR s concern intensifies - the BLACK KNIGHT is clearly an 
      accomplished swordsman. UTHER too looks concerned.  

    The two fighters circle each other, suddenly the BLACK KNIGHT 
      unleashes a series of blows. His style is unhurried, precise, 
      clinical, devoid of emotion. All OWAIN can do is block and 
      parry, he s forced backward across the square unable to find 
      a riposte...

                                  GWEN
                    Come on, Owain!

                                  ARTHUR
                          (bellowing)
                    One well aimed blow!

      MERLIN watches on fearfully, impotent to help.

    The fight accelerates, blows rain down on young OWAIN. The 
      BLACK KNIGHT is an awesome fighting machine, relentless, 
      unstoppable...

      MERLIN s eyes tighten...

      Suddenly we re in MERLIN time: In slow motion we see OWAIN 
      manage to unleash a single strike that pierces the BLACK 
      KNIGHT s breastplate...

      MERLIN reacts with joy.

                                  MERLIN
                    Yes!

      GAIUS gives him a puzzled glance...

      UTHER stands up - did he see the blow too? The fight 
      continues at normal speed again, the BLACK KNIGHT shows no 
      sign of injury. Instead, he reacts with a flurry of frenzied 
      blows. As the final stroke lands, the CROWD react with 
      audible horror... UTHER sits down in horrified realisation 
      that OWAIN is dead. 

    The drum stops. A silence. We see the ribbon, Owain s good 
      luck token, lying in the dirt, it flutters on the breeze...

    The CROWD is silent. ARTHUR hangs his head. MORGANA has tears 
    in her eyes. 

    The BLACK KNIGHT steps over OWAIN s body and throws down his 
      gauntlet again - it lands before the King.

                                  BLACK KNIGHT
                    Who will take up my challenge?

      ARTHUR makes to step forward but UTHER grabs him by the arm. 
      ARTHUR flashes his father a quick look, and pulls himself 
      from UTHER s grip...  MERLIN EPISODE NINE PRODUCTION SCRIPT AMENDED 17th JUNE 2008   12.


    But as he turns back to the gauntlet, SIR PELLINORsteps 
      forward and swipes it from the ground.

                                  SIR PELLINOR
                    I, Sir Pellinor, take up the 
                    challenge.

                                  BLACK KNIGHT
                    Single combat. Dawn tomorrow.

    The BLACK KNIGHT stares at UTHER...

      ARTHUR spins round to UTHER. UTHER brushes him aside and 
      turns away.

    The BLACK KNIGHT starts to walk back toward the gates...

      MERLIN watches him, then glances at GAIUS.

                                  MERLIN
                    Should we tend to his wounds?

      GAIUS looks at him, confused.

                                  MERLIN
                    He took a hit.

                                  GAIUS
                    Owain didn t land a blow.

                                  MERLIN
                    I saw it. It pierced his breast 
                    plate. 

                                  GAIUS
                    Are you sure?

                                  MERLIN
                          (nods)
                    My eyes are quicker than yours.

      They look at the Knight - He is walking purposefully with no 
      hint of pain or impairment. 

                                  MERLIN
                    He should be dead.  

      GAIUS looks concerned.

                                  GAIUS
                    Maybe he already is.

                                                                            CUT TO:  MERLIN EPISODE NINE PRODUCTION SCRIPT AMENDED 17th JUNE 2008   13.



    The sound of the drum, beating its slow, ominous rhythm.  The 
      BLACK KNIGHT stands in the centre of the tournament ground in 
      readiness for battle. His darkness is even more striking now 
      that he s silhouetted against the sun. He stares at UTHER...

      UTHER is determined to hold his gaze.

    The eager CROWD has a nervous atmosphere. They cheer as SIR 
      PELLINORand ARTHUR enter the arena.  

    The pair stop, ARTHUR focuses on SIR PELLINORto give him his 
      last instructions...

                                  ARTHUR
                    You ve seen him fight.

                                  SIR PELLINOR
                          (looking at the Black 
                            Knight)
                    He s good.

                                  ARTHUR
                          (forcing Sir Pellinorto 
                          look at him)
                    Not as good as you. Are you 
                    listening to me?

    SIR PELLINORnods.

                                  ARTHUR
                    See the sun is low in the sky.

    SIR PELLINORglances toward the sun...

                                  ARTHUR
                    Keep it behind you.

    He holds up his hand (in arm wrestling position). SIR 
      PELLINORreciprocates and clasps his hand.

                                  SIR PELLINOR
                    For the love of Camelot.

                                  ARTHUR
                    For the love of Camelot.

                                                                            CUT TO:  MERLIN EPISODE NINE PRODUCTION SCRIPT AMENDED 17th JUNE 2008   18.


    SIR PELLINORand the BLACK KNIGHT exchange sword blows.  SIR 
      PELLINORis an experienced fighter, he gives as good as he 
      gets. He pushes the BLACK KNIGHT back with a series of 
      lunges...

    The CROWD cheer for their hero. Amongst them we see UTHER, 
      ARTHUR, MORGANA and GWEN. Standing to one side, viewing the 
      fight from a different angle, we find MERLIN and GAIUS.

                                  MERLIN
                    Maybe you were wrong.

                                  GAIUS
                    I hope so.

    The BLACK KNIGHT parries everything SIR PELLINORthrows at 
      him, until finally SIR PELLINORlands a blow which knocks the 
      black knight s sword to the ground. 

    The BLACK KNIGHT is momentarily defenseless as PELLINOR
      thrusts his sword into his chest with what looks like a fatal 
      blow - the crowd gasp and cheer as they see SIR PELLINOR s
      sword penetrate the BLACK KNIGHT s armour.

    SIR PELLINORsteps back, triumphant. But the BLACK KNIGHT 
      doesn t flinch. He retrieves his sword and responds with a 
      series of crashing blows, that SIR PELLINORstruggles to 
      block. The BLACK KNIGHT is unstoppable, a killing machine. He 
      lands a fatal strike that coincides with a drum beat...

    We cut away to UTHER s face, appalled by what he s 
      witnessed... The crowd look shocked. We go to GWEN and 
      MORGANA.

                                  GWEN
                    The sword went in - I m sure of it.

                                  MORGANA
                          (worried)
                    I saw it too. 

    The BLACK KNIGHT turns toward the King, starts to remove his 
      gauntlet, but before he can throw it down ...

      A gauntlet hits the ground at his feet.  The BLACK KNIGHT 
      looks up to see where it s come from.  He finds ARTHUR 
      looking at him ...

                                  ARTHUR
                    I will not see anymore of my men 
                    die.
                          (a beat)
                    I, Arthur Pendragon, take up the 
                    challenge.

      A murmur amongst the CROWD.  MERLIN EPISODE NINE PRODUCTION SCRIPT AMENDED 17th JUNE 2008   19.


                                  BLACK KNIGHT
                    So be it.

                                  ARTHUR

                    Single combat.  Noon tomorrow.

      GAIUS catches UTHER s eye. He is white-faced with shock.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      (MAIN GATES) - NIGHT 3. UK/FR.

      ARTHUR stands in the window alone, he stares out at the BLACK 
      KNIGHT.  We can sense his doubts...  MERLIN EPISODE NINE PRODUCTION SCRIPT AMENDED 17th JUNE 2008   30.


    He hears a noise and quickly turns to the door.  He finds 
      MORGANA watching him.

                                  MORGANA
                          (for once showing her true 
                            emotions)
                    I don t want you to fight tomorrow.

      ARTHUR stares at her, surprised by her conviction.

                                  ARTHUR
                    Why not? 

                                  MORGANA
                          (feeling some kind of 
                            premonition)
                    I don t know what it is ... Please - 
                    I m warning you.

                                  ARTHUR
                          (smiling)
                    You re worried about me.

                                  MORGANA
                    No.  It s not me.  It s your 
                    father.  Can t you see what you re 
                    doing to him?

                                  ARTHUR
                          (doubtful)
                    My father?

                                  MORGANA
                    Obviously.  He cares about you. 
                          (betrayingher own 
                            emotions)
                    He loves you, Arthur.  He doesn t 
                    want to lose you.

                                  ARTHUR
                            (recognising )
                    And I feel the same.  But ... I 
                    have to do this.

      A moment, they hold each other s stare.  Tears are forming in 
      MORGANA s eyes.

                                  MORGANA
                      I understand.

    She turns and goes.  ARTHUR bows his head and sighs.

                                                                            CUT TO:  MERLIN EPISODE NINE PRODUCTION SCRIPT AMENDED 17th JUNE 2008   31.



      Dawn. The BLACK KNIGHT stands, watched by a few TOWNSPEOPLE 
    who are setting up for the fight.  Amongst them we see the 
      DRUMMER.  

                                                                            CUT TO:


    DAY 4. FR.

      UTHER walks under the drawbridge.  The drum beat gets slowly 
      louder as he approaches the tournament ground and the battle 
    of his life.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      UTHER s P.O.V:  The bright light, the noise of a large fight 
      crowd, a multitude of expectant faces and in the centre of 
    the Tournament Ground the BLACK KNIGHT standing motionless 
    and poised for battle...  MERLIN EPISODE NINE PRODUCTION SCRIPT AMENDED 17th JUNE 2008   40.


      UTHER steps forward. Shock rumbles through the crowd, 
      including MORGANA and GWEN in the stands and MERLIN and GAIUS 
    at the side of the fighting area. 

    The DRUMMER holds his monotonous rhythm.  UTHER walks calmly 
      through the crowd, but we sense his tension within.   

    He arrives before the BLACK KNIGHT and stops inches from him, 
      staring into his foe s visor...

                                  UTHER
                    You can have what you want - the 
                    father, not the son.

    The BLACK KNIGHT stiffens and steps back withdrawing his 
      sword.  UTHER puts on his helmet. The SPECTATORS watch in 
      hushed silence as UTHER and the BLACK KNIGHT circle one 
      another.

                                                                            CUT TO:



    The battle is on. The new sword glints in the light as it 
      hits the Black Knight s blade for the first time. This is no 
      ordinary sword. UTHER and the BLACK KNIGHT trade blows, two 
      mighty gladiators engaged in ancient warfare as MORGANA, 
      GWEN, MERLIN and GAIUS look on.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      Swirling action as the BLACK KNIGHT slashes ruthlessly at 
      UTHER.   MERLIN EPISODE NINE PRODUCTION SCRIPT AMENDED 17th JUNE 2008   41.


    The King responds, parrying and countering with great skill, 
      somehow managing to maintain his regal presence and command 
    the fight... MERLIN watches the action intensely, reacting as 
    the blows strike. 

    But the BLACK KNIGHT s assault is unrelenting.  Suddenly, the 
      sword is knocked from UTHER s hand, it clatters across the 
      cobbles.  He is defenceless.  He reaches for it, but the 
      BLACK KNIGHT slices at his arm, striking a plate on his 
      forearm... 

      GAIUS and MERLIN react to this turn of events against the 
      KING.

      UTHER reacts in pain, the BLACK KNIGHT closes in for the 
      kill. UTHER now has only his shield with which to defend 
      himself...

    In vain, he uses it to beat away the BLACK KNIGHT s blows. 
      It s desperate heroic stuff...

      MORGANA, sat next to GWEN, looks on in horror.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      UTHER continues to desperately defend himself with his 
      battered shield, but the BLACK KNIGHT drives him towards the 
      wooden barriers. UTHER appears doomed. 

    We discover NIMUEH concealed in the crowd, she smiles 
      anticipating UTHER s demise.

    The BLACK KNIGHT makes a final lunge with all his might, but 
      somehow UTHER steps out of the way.  The sword buries itself 
    in UTHER s shield.  UTHER hits the BLACK KNIGHT around the 
      head, the KNIGHT s helmet flies off to reveal the hideous 
      wraith underneath.  

    The CROWD s shock turns to horror...

      Before the BLACK KNIGHT can remove his sword, UTHER has 
      regained his weapon. 

                                  UTHER
                    Die a second time.  MERLIN EPISODE NINE PRODUCTION SCRIPT AMENDED 17th JUNE 2008   42.


      UTHER strikes home with the sword, straight into the KNIGHT s 
      breastplate. As he pulls the blade back, the wraith s mouth 
      opens, his final breath hitting UTHER, who stumbles back as 
    the wraith starts to burn and then explodes in a cloud of 
      dust. 

    On MERLIN s shocked face. The sword is all the dragon 
      promised. 

    The CROWD react... 

    An exhausted UTHER looks down at the wraith's remains - an 
      empty suit of armour...

                                                                            CUT TO:



      Dawn. MERLIN leaves Camelot. He s carrying a cloth bundle. 

                                                                            CUT TO:



    The calm water of a vast lake. 

      MERLIN takes out the sword, he takes one last look, then 
      throws it into the lake...

    The swords hilt slowly sinks to the depths...

    END OF EPISODE.
