      Claire is busy making breakfast for the family.  Phil enters
      in workout clothes.

                                      CLAIRE
                    What's with the workout clothes?
                          (then)
                    Kids!!!

                    What?  I work out.
                          (glances toward the
                            camera)
                    Just because I don't run six miles a
                    day like you --

                                      CLAIRE
                    Eight.

                                    PHIL
                    You run eight miles a day?  That's
                    like three-thousand miles a year. 
                    You could have run to Hawaii.

                                      CLAIRE
                    I think about that every single day.

      Haley enters in a short skirt.

                                      HALEY
                    I'm having a friend over today.

                                      CLAIRE
                    Haley, you're not wearing that skirt.

                                      HALEY
                    What's wrong with it?

                                      CLAIRE
                    It's too short.  People can tell
                    you're a girl, you don't have to
                    prove it to them.

      Alex enters.          MY AMERICAN FAMILY  "Pilot"  12-9-08                    2.

                    Luke got his head stuck in the
                    banister again.

                                    PHIL
                    I got it.  Where's the baby oil?

                                      CLAIRE
                    It's in our night stan--

                    Raising kids is like building a car. 
                    You only have so much time to make
                    sure the steering works and the brakes
                    stop and the engine is dependable
                    before you send it out on the road,
                    and if you get one little rivet wrong,
                    it will drive off a cliff and explode.  

      Awkward beat.

                                    PHIL
                    We have a lot of fun.

4EXT SOCCER FIELD -- DAY

      Gloria and Jay watch as Gloria's son Manny plays in a soccer
      game.  Gloria paces around nervously.  Jay, dressed in a
      track suit, sits in a low folding chair, reading the paper.

                                      GLORIA
                    Go, Manny, go!  Kick it!  Don't let
                    him -- kick it!

      The opposing player trips Manny.

                                      GLORIA (CONT'D)
                    He tripped him!  Where's the penalty?!  

                                    JAY
                    Gloria, they're oh and six.  Let's
                    take it down a notch.

      An opposing player gets the ball.  It's only Manny between
      him and the goal.          MY AMERICAN FAMILY  "Pilot"  12-9-08                    3.

                          (while HITTING Jay)
                    Get the ball, Manny!  Stop him.  You
                    can do it!

      But Manny gets distracted by a PRETTY TEENAGE GIRL riding by
      on a bicycle.  The opposing player dribbles around Manny and
      SCORES.  An uptight SOCCER MOM approaches the coach, oblivious
      that Gloria is Manny's mom.

                                      SOCCER MOM
                    Come on, Coach, you gotta take that
                    kid out.

      Gloria wheels on her.

                                      GLORIA
                    You want to take him out?!  How about
                    I take you out?!  

      Jay grabs the back of her jacket.

                                    JAY
                    Honey, honey...

                                      GLORIA
                          (to Soccer Mom)
                    Why don't you worry about your son? 
                    He spend the first half with his
                    hand in his pants.

      Gloria moves off, disgusted.  Jay, having been through scenes
      like this before, shakes his head as A SOCCER DAD approaches.

                                      SOCCER DAD
                    Whoa, remind me not to mess with
                    your daughter.

                                    JAY
                    My daughter?  
                          (annoyed, struggles
                          to get up)
                    No, that's funny, actually, no, she's
                    my wife.  Don't be fooled by the --

                    moved to Florida.  I was feeling pretty

                    Yes, the murders.


      Boarding passengers file down the aisle passing Mitchell,
      who holds on his lap an Asian baby, Lily.  As various
      passengers pass they smile at the baby and wave.

                                    PHIL
                          (to Luke)
                    What did I tell you would happen if
                    you shot any animal or any person?

                                    LUKE
                    That you would shoot me.

                                    PHIL
                    That's right!  Come on.  Let's go.

      He starts for the backyard.

                                      CLAIRE
                    Are you insane, you're going to shoot
                    him?!  He's got a birthday party.

                                      CLAIRE (CONT'D)
                    He can't show up with a big hideous
                    welt.  You can shoot him later. 
                    He'll be home at two.

                                    ALEX
                    Does anyone care about my hideous
                    welt?

                                    PHIL
                    I can't shoot him at two, I'm showing
                    a house then.  What about three?

      Claire checks her calendar.

                                      CLAIRE
                    No, he's got a soccer game at three. 
                    We've got to leave for that dinner
                    at five.  You can shoot him at four-
                    fifteen.

                                    PHIL
                    Yeah, I guess that works for me.

                                      CLAIRE
                          (writing on calendar)
                    Shoot Luke.

                                    PHIL
                          (to Luke)
                    Have a good day, sport.


      Mitchell is shopping while he holds Lily.  Cameron approaches
      with some items.  He places a pie into their basket.

                                      MITCHELL
                          (re: pie, judgmental)
                    Okay...

                                      CAMERON
                    What?  Your family's coming over and
                    everyone likes pie.

                                      MITCHELL
                    Oh, please, you like pie.  

                                      CAMERON
                    You like pie.  

                                      MITCHELL
                    Not as much as y--  Oh my God, you
                    have blueberry on your fingers.

                                      CAMERON
                    What, we're buying it.

14INTERVIEW -- CAMERON

                                      CAMERON
                    Yes, Mitchell will be keeping his
                    dental practice and I'll be home
                      full-time, but that does not make me
                    "the wife."  Sure, I gained a few
                    pounds while we were expecting the
                    baby, but that was stress.  

      We cut to a shot of Cam hiding in the pantry of their kitchen
      ravenously eating chocolate, hoping not to get caught.

                                      CAMERON  (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    It's perfectly normal.  It would be
                    nice if he understood that.


      They are now in line at checkout.

                                      MITCHELL
                    This doesn't worry you, that she
                    barely slept on the plane and she's
                    still wide awake?  I didn't even
                    think Asian eyes opened that wide.  

                                      CAMERON
                    Oh stop worrying.        MY AMERICAN FAMILY  "Pilot"  12-9-08                    12.
                                         

                                      MITCHELL
                    Maybe she just can't fall asleep
                    unless she feels a woman's shape. 
                    That orphanage was all women.  

                                      CAMERON
                    I guess that's possible.

      Mitchell tries to hand Lily to Cameron.

                                      CAMERON (CONT'D)
                    What the hell is that supposed to
                    mean?

                                      MITCHELL
                    I just thought--

                                      CAMERON
                    What, that I'm more womanly?  

                                      MITCHELL
                    Now you're sensitive about that?  It
                    wasn't a problem on Halloween when
                    you just had to be Sarah Palin and I
                    was stuck all night in that John
                    McCain harness. 

                                      CAMERON
                    Is there a particular reason you've
                    been in a bitchy mood all day when
                    this is supposed to be the happiest
                    day of our lives?

                                      MITCHELL
                    I have not been --

      They are now at the checkout line and a few customers are
      behind them including a woman in a wheelchair.

                                      WHEELCHAIR WOMAN
                          (amused)
                    Look at that baby with those Twinkies.

      Mitchell turns on her.

                                      MITCHELL
                    Yeah, it's funny isn't it?  Hilarious! 
                    This baby would have grown up in a
                    crowded orphanage if it weren't for
                    us "twinkies" and I'd think someone
                    like you would have a little sympathy
                    for people who are a little different
                    than --        MY AMERICAN FAMILY  "Pilot"  12-9-08                    13.
                                         

      Cameron slaps him.  He has noticed that Lily has grabbed a
      Hostess Twinkies pack off the nearby display rack and is
      squishing them.

                                      MITCHELL (CONT'D)
                    What?!

      Mitchell then takes in the picture of Lily with the Twinkies.

                                      CAMERON
                    We'd like to pay for your cat food.


      SFX: DOORBELL

                                      HALEY (O.S.)
                    Don't answer it.  I'll get it.

      Claire quickly crosses to the door and answers it to find,
      DYLAN, a very tall and mature seventeen-year-old boy.

                                      CLAIRE
                    Hello, you must be Dylan.

                                      DYLAN
                    Hey.  Dylan.  Yeah.

      Haley rushes up and puts herself between Dylan and her mom.

                                      HALEY
                    Hey.  Let's go.

      They head up the stairs.

                                      CLAIRE
                    Hang on.  How old are you, Dylan?

                                      DYLAN
                      Seventeen.

                                      CLAIRE
                    Oh.  That's, um...

      Phil enters.

                                      CLAIRE (CONT'D)
                    Phil, Dylan's here and he's seventeen.

                                    PHIL
                    Sweet.  Let me meet this playa.
                          (offers fist bump)
                    Phil Dunphy, yo.

17INTERVIEW -- PHIL

      Phil stares intently into the camera saying nothing.  Then:        MY AMERICAN FAMILY  "Pilot"  12-9-08                    14.
                                         


                                    PHIL
                    It's like that.  You just let the
                    eyes do the work.  Your mouth might
                    be saying, "Hey, we cool", but your
                    eyes are saying, "I know what you're
                    here for, and that shiznit is broke."  


      Phil is at the bottom of the stairs as Dylan crosses back
      down to shake hands.  Phil starts to put on his "intimidating"
      face, but as Dylan reaches the ground floor Phil sees that
      Dylan is several inches taller than he is.

                                      DYLAN
                    Hey, what's up?

                                    PHIL
                    Nu-in, nu-in much.

                                      HALEY
                          (hating this)
                    Okay.

      Never losing eye contact, Phil steps up the first step of
      the stairs so that now he's a little taller than Dylan.

                                    PHIL
                    So you two have fun today, just make
                    sure you keep it real, know what I mean?

                                      DYLAN
                          (looks to Haley)
                    Uh..

                                      HALEY
                    Dad!

                                    PHIL
                    That's cool.  That's--

      To be even more intimidating, Phil steps up another step but
      loses his grip on the banister when it slips in some baby
      oil left over from freeing Luke.  He awkwardly saves himself,
      but wrenches his back in the process.

                                    PHIL (CONT'D)
                    Oh boy.  Ohhhh.  That's not good.

                                      CLAIRE
                    Honey?

                                      DYLAN
                    You okay?

                                    PHIL
                    Yeah, I'm ---
                                      (MORE)        MY AMERICAN FAMILY  "Pilot"  12-9-08                    15.
                                         

                                    PHIL (CONT'D)
                          (unable to stand)
                    -- no I'm not.


      Dylan carries Phil to the couch, holding him like a baby.

                                      CLAIRE
                    Should I call the doctor?

                                    PHIL
                    No.
                          (to Dylan)
                    You're very strong, Homes.

      Haley is horrified.

                                  END OF ACT TWO        MY AMERICAN FAMILY  "Pilot"  12-9-08                    16.
                                         

                                      ACT THREE


      Jay, Gloria, and Manny are walking through the mall.  Jay is
      still in his track suit.  Manny now wears his puffy, white
      shirt.  Manny spots Brenda Feldman, the cute 16 year-old we
      saw on her bike earlier, at work in Wetzel's Pretzels.

                                      MANNY
                            (reverently)
                    Brenda Feldman. 

                                    JAY
                    I can't watch this.

        A saleswoman passes, promoting cologne.

                                      SALESWOMAN
                    Panache for Men?

                                    JAY
                          (a little annoyed)
                    No.

                                      MANNY
                    I will take some.
                          (as she spritzes him)
                    Thank you.  And that is a lovely
                    color on you.

                                      SALESWOMAN
                    Well, aren't you a gentleman?

                                      MANNY
                    Yes.

      The saleswoman moves off as Manny pulls some folded sheets
      out of his pocket.

                                      GLORIA
                    What is that?

                                      MANNY
                    A poem I have written for Brenda.

                                    JAY
                    Of course it is.

      Gloria shoots Jay a steely look.

                                      MANNY
                    I put my thoughts into words, and
                    now my words into action.        MY AMERICAN FAMILY  "Pilot"  12-9-08                    17.
                                         

      Manny crosses over to Wetzel's Pretzels.  Jay and Gloria
      watch him go.  It's clear Gloria is giving Jay a cold
      shoulder.

                    I'll give him one thing, he's got
                    some cahoneys.

      She turns away from him.

                                    JAY
                    Look, I know you're upset cause I
                    got a little mad in the car.  You
                    want to talk about that?

                                      GLORIA
                    I'm trying to have an unexpressed
                    emotion.

                                    JAY
                    So you're just going to stay mad?

                                      GLORIA
                    I'll just say this:  You could learn
                    from Manny.  He doesn't keep how he
                    feels inside, and it may not work
                    out for him over there today but it
                    will someday.  He's not afraid of
                    how he feels, and women like that.
                          (admiring him)
                    He's like a bullfighter.

                                    JAY
                          (struggling with this
                            a little)
                    Okay, I think I got mad in the car
                    because I was bugged about what that
                    guy said to me at the game.  He
                    thought I was your Dad.  And that's
                    not the first time that's happened,
                    people... thinking I'm too old for
                    you.

      He looks to Manny.  He's reciting his poem now, Brenda holding
      the flowers Manny has brought.  It inspires Jay to go on.

                                    JAY (CONT'D)
                    And I guess I'm worried maybe you'll
                    think that too some day.        MY AMERICAN FAMILY  "Pilot"  12-9-08                    18.

                          (melted by his honesty)
                    How can you think that?  I would
                    never!  How could I when you're so
                    cute?

      She hugs and kisses him -- the public affection is a little
      too much for Jay. 

                                    JAY
                    Okay, that's enough of that.

                                      GLORIA
                    And if it bothers you and you want
                    to look a little younger, we can get
                    you some hipper clothes.  There's a
                    store right there that--

                    Let's not go crazy.  I'll be fine.

      Manny rejoins them.

                                      MANNY
                    She has a boyfriend.

      She hugs him.

                                      MANNY
                    I gave her my heart and she gave me
                    a pretzel dog.  
                          (then)
                    That was pretty stupid of me, wasn't
                    it?  

                                    JAY
                    You know what, Manny, no it wasn't
                    stupid. It was fantastic.  You took
                    a big swing and I respect the hell
                    out of that.   C'mon, let's go get
                    some lunch.  Anywhere you want to
                    go.

      They start off, Jay striding briskly. Gloria gives Manny a
      big hug, which causes them to linger behind a bit.  After a
      short distance, Jay is stopped by a security guard.

                                      SECURITY GUARD
                    Excuse me, sir, we ask that all mall-
                    walkers stay to the right.

                                    JAY
                    What?        MY AMERICAN FAMILY  "Pilot"  12-9-08                    19.
                                         

      He sees that he is being approached by a large group of senior
      citizen mall walkers.  Many of the men are dressed similarly
      to Jay.  They pass him.

                                      SECURITY GUARD
                    Thank you sir.

      The security guard heads off.

                                    JAY
                          (to Gloria)
                    I'll meet up with you guys.

      Jay turns and heads into the funky clothes store as Gloria
      and Manny continue on their way.


      The front door opens and Mitchell and Cameron enter, carrying
      Lily, their luggage and the groceries.  There is an antique
      '60s robot in one corner.

                                      CAMERON
                    Tada!  Your new home!  Isn't it
                    gorgeous, except for that robot -- I
                    hate to break it to you, your other
                    daddy is a big nerd.  

      They exit into Lily's room.


      They enter, and Cameron looks up at the ceiling.  On it a
      mural has been painted.  It is a heavenly scene, full of
      clouds.  Emerging from one cloud are Cameron and Mitchell
      painted like angels with wings.

                                      CAMERON
                          (gasping)
                    Oh my God, do you love it?

                                      MITCHELL
                    What the hell is it?

                                      CAMERON
                    I had Andre do it while we were gone. 
                    Look, that's us.

                                      MITCHELL
                    Yeah, I see.  With wings.

                                      CAMERON

                                      MITCHELL
                    Like fairies, you mean.  Okay, now I
                    get it.  "Yes, we pulled you out of
                    your home in Vietnam, but don't worry,
                    things will be perfectly normal here.

                    know, I really don't need my family
                      ridiculing me over this tonight. 
                    Call Andre and have him paint
                      something... less gay.

                                      CAMERON
                    That is not that gay.

                                      MITCHELL
                      A triptych of us having sex would be
                    less gay.

                                      CAMERON
                    You know what?  I've put up with
                    this mood of yours all day.  What is
                    your deal?

                                      MITCHELL
                    Nothing.

                                      CAMERON
                    See when he looks at the floor, Lily? 
                    That's what nerdy daddy does when
                    he's lying.

                                      MITCHELL
                    I never told them, all right?

                                      CAMERON
                    What?

                                      MITCHELL
                    I never told my family we were
                    adopting a baby.

                                      CAMERON
                    Are you kidding me?  Why the hell
                    not?

                                      MITCHELL
                    We weren't telling anyone until we
                    knew it was official and then when
                    the agency called last week I had
                    to, you know, pack and --

                                      CAMERON
                    We left two days later and I packed
                    for you!  You wussed out!        MY AMERICAN FAMILY  "Pilot"  12-9-08                    21.
                                         

                                      MITCHELL
                    Okay fine, my family was going to
                    have a big opinion and I just didn't
                    want to hear it.

                                      CAMERON
                    But it's the ceiling's that's too
                    gay. 

      Mitchell storms off.


      Claire is at the foot of the stairs.

                                      HALEY (O.S.)
                    Alex, get out!  Mom!

      Alex enters.

                                    ALEX
                    I was just getting my sweatshirt.

                                    ALEX
                    Nothing.  Lying on her bed watching
                    a movie.

                                    ALEX
                    Can I do the frosting?

                    Sure, sweetie.

      Claire begins to tie an apron around Alex.

                                      CLAIRE (CONT'D)
                    Wow, I remember when you used to
                    trip over this thing.

                                    ALEX
                    So, if Haley got pregnant, would you
                    ever do one of those weird things
                    where you pretend she has mono for a
                    few months and then tell everyone
                    the baby is yours?

                                      CLAIRE
                    What?

                                    ALEX
                    This senior at school was "out sick"
                    for like four months, but Robby
                    Richman swears he saw her
                      breastfeeding at a California Chicken
                    Cafe. 


      Claire and Alex are as before.  Claire is looking pretty
      horrified.

                                    ALEX
                    First of all, it would be really cool
                    to see Haley that fat.  And how awesome
                    would it be to have a secret little
                    brother who's really my  nephew.

                                      CLAIRE
                    Alex, Haley is not getting pregnant.

                                    ALEX
                    I'm just saying if.        MY AMERICAN FAMILY  "Pilot"  12-9-08                    23.

                          (trying to hide her
                            panic)
                    But there's no point in saying if. 
                    If is what you say when things can
                    happen and this can't happen.  
                          (then)
                    I can't believe I have to prove this
                    to you.

      She rushes out.


      Claire walks up the stairs, matching Phil's pace.


      Claire has reached Haley's closed door.  She's about to burst
      in, when she stops and retreats.


      Claire barrels through Haley's door to find:


      Haley and Dylan are on her bed, watching a movie on her
      laptop.  They both have Starbucks.

                                      HALEY

                    need anything, okay?

                                      HALEY
                    You could knock.

                                      CLAIRE
                    Knock?  You knock when you think
                    people are doing something private,
                    which you aren't, obviously, why
                    would you be?  Although I think we
                    all read that study this week saying
                      thirty-nine-percent of sixteen-year-
                    olds have had sexual intercourse. 
                    And as long as we're talking, what
                    is with the coffee all the time? 
                    Huh?  Whatever happened to ice cream? 
                    And all the texting and your cell
                    phones glued to your hands, like
                    you're little business-people. 
                    Doesn't anyone want to run around
                    and ride bikes and be kids anymore?

      They look at her stunned.

      Mitchell and Claire enter and begin changing Lily's diaper.

                    How could you not say something?  

                                      MITCHELL
                    I don't know.  Maybe I thought you'd
                    try to talk me out of it.        MY AMERICAN FAMILY  "Pilot"  12-9-08                    30.

                    I love how you see me as some huge
                    busybody.  
                          (pushes him aside,
                            takes over changing
                          the diaper)
                    I mean, yes, it's a huge
                      responsibility, it's gonna put a lot
                    of pressure on you two that you might
                    not be able to handle.  What did Mom
                    say?

                                      MITCHELL
                    I haven't told her yet, but that was
                    a good sneak preview.

                                      CLAIRE
                          (re: Lily)
                    So what do you know about her parents?

                                      MITCHELL
                    Not much.  I just know her mother
                    was sixteen.

                                      CLAIRE
                    Oh, God.  Well, she's gorgeous.

                                      MITCHELL
                    Thanks.  I just hope... 

                                      CLAIRE
                    What?

                                      MITCHELL
                    I already love her so much and...
                    it's hard enough for any kid, let
                    alone one with two dads.  What if,
                    when she gets older, she's ashamed
                    of us?   

      She hugs him.

                                      CLAIRE
                    Oh honey, don't be ridiculous.  You're
                    her parents.  Of course she'll be
                    ashamed of you.
                          (then)
                    My kids are mortified by me.  Which
                    is pretty ironic considering Haley
                    dresses like a hooker,  Alex dresses
                    like a lesbian and...


      The whole family is now gathered around a baby monitor on a
      table.        MY AMERICAN FAMILY  "Pilot"  12-9-08                    31.

                    ...Luke can barely get his shoes on
                    the right feet.  And tell me you're
                    not horrified by Dad and that Huggy
                    Bear outfit that Charo out there
                    bought for him.


                                      CLAIRE
                    The point is, Lily is the luckiest
                    little girl in the world, getting
                    you two.  So stop worrying. 

                                      MITCHELL
                    All right.

                                      CLAIRE
                    Come on, we're all together.  Let's
                    go out there and enjoy this.

      They head back out to the living room.


      As they enter, everybody stares at them unhappily.

                                      MITCHELL
                    What?
