We are in the midst of a field of tall grass wild flowers.
A long rutted road stretches into the distance. Faintly at
first and then closer - we hear a woman squealing with
laughter. We see her legs cut through the grass and fly up a
hill. Close on her heels is a young man, a good ten years
younger, in hot pursuit.
Over the field - across the tops of blades, sits an ancient
apple tree. We rise out of the grass and see the two young
people under the tree. They are entwined - in a deep embrace.
CLOSER NOW
We see them in glimpses:
Their eyes - Lips - Hands
Finally they part - the woman rests her head on his chest.
She reaches out and strokes his hand.
He stares at their fingers mingling together.
The woman sighs.
WOMAN
I Love it here.
I know you do...
WOMAN
I can feel my life - ya know.
He stares up into the boughs above him and sHd.les.
A legend appears: Il -_ 1
THE SOUND OF BALLGAmE OVER:
T. RURAL ROUTE 90 - PREDAWN
A BLUE 1973 CHEW PICK-UP winds around a corner and
disappears down a long stretch of road. "And that's it from
Fenway the final score Oakland 3 t1 Redsox 7. You have been
listening to the re-broadcast of last night's game. This
broadcast is the sole property of -- -)r League Baseball and

Matt & Ruth sit watching BARRY L DON. The duel between Barry
Lord Bullingdon is on screen. Bullingdon's pistol misfires.
LORD BULLINGDON
Sir Richard this pistol must be faulty -
I must have another.
AIDE TO RIC
I'm sorry Lord Bullingdon but you must
first stand your ground and allow Mr.
Lyndon his turn to fire.
SIR RIC
That is correct Lord Bullingdon - your
pistol has fired and that counts as your
shot--Mr. Lyndon are the rules of firing
clear to you?
YES -
SIR RICHARD
Lord Bullingdon are you rsdy to receive
Mr- Lyndon's fire?
LORD BULLINGDON
-.o yes -
15
SIR RIC
very well then - Mr. Lyndon cock your
pistol and prepare to fire.
Bullingdon is overwrought. He looks like he may vomit.
Ruth leans over to Matt.
RUTH
Let's go.
Ruth gets out of her seat. Matt looking confused follows.
Elwyn sits bare chested on a table. Matt finishes bandaging his
elbow - then listens to his chest with a stethoscope. He is
careful and thoughtful. Alma looks to him. Worried.
MATT
You can put your shirt back on now.
Alma stands and helps her husband dress.
Yesterday he was up and around all
afternoon, but toda - he tumbled. He's
fallen down twice. have all I can do to
get him up. He's weak and the longer you
lay in bed - the weaker you get.
MATT
Elwyn, you need to do those exercises,
you promised me, twice a day.
I know you miss the work -
important. but it's
ALMA
TO MATT)
Man idn't have ache nor pain--he's just
gave up-said when he couldn't work no
more, he didn't want to live. For a while
he'd sit and just mend on nets - but he
can't do that anymore.
ELWYN
(speaks with difficulty)
How's your dad Matt?
I'm sorry Dr. now Elwyn you remember
Jesse Fowler passed on somi&ime; back, we
were at the funeral. Remember?
Elwyn nods.
18
Matt knows. He's heard this before. Sometimes he feels more like
a mechanic than a doctor, working on old cars with parts that
have long been discontinued. He nods sympathetically.
Matt pulls on his jacket. He passes Janelle in the hallway as
he heads for the back door.
MATT
I'll be back in an hour. Forgot my lunch.
JANELLE
Starting to become a habit. I can get you
something from Willis's.
He's already out the door.
Natalie drives down Emerson Road.
As she approaches her house, she sees a Brown Suburban sitting
in her driveway. She looks confused.
THE KITCHEN
Natalie enters with groceries.
Richard is seated at the kitchen table. He's finishing the first half
of a sandwich. He drains a glass of milk.
Natalie sets her purse down on the counter, and starts cleaning
up his mess.
NATALIE
How'd you g et in this time?
RIC
(PLAYING ALONG)
chimney.
She takes the carton of milk that Richard, no doubt, left out. She pours
the final drops into his glass
RIC
Thank you.
She throws the carton out. She takes a seat, and stares at him
like a teacher counselling a troubled youth.
22
NATALIE
What can I help you with?
He kicks back the last of the milk, wipes his mouth.
RIC
I was just dropping that off for Jason.
NATALIE
What?
RIC
That.
He points to a BASEBALL TROPHY sitting on top of the microwave.
inscription bears his name and "Rockland High School 1982
Regional Championship."
RIC
I didn't know where you'd want to put it.
It was about time he got it. What am I
going to do with it?
Richard's wistful gaze stays locked on the trophy.
For a moment, Natalie's and slips away.
NATALIE
I think it will mean a lot to him,
Richard. He's really been improving
lately ...
RIC
(a sharp turn)
So I've heard.
NATALIE
It would have been nice if you'd come to
his game.
RIC
I just got your message. Where are t
with him?
NATALIE
That's none of your business.
RIC
I see. They're my kids but they're none of
my business.
NATALIE
You know what I mean.
E-??
Richard presses his fingers to his eyes. He takes a long, heavy
breath.
RIC
I - - I was thinking about moving back.
Here. With you and the boys.
23
NATALIE
What are you talking about?
RIC
What I talking about? I'm talking about
moving back, that's what I'm talking
about - I know what you're thinking, but
it's different now.
NATALIE
Oh reall ? How's the job? Your father
t ake you back on at the cannery?
RIC
(DRILY)
That's funny. You're still getting checks
aren't you?
She ignores him
RICHARD
Ya see my new rig out there?
Natalie looks annoyed.
NATALIE
Yeah - it's real nice.
RIC
It's not exactly new, I traded David the truck
for it. It's got room for all of us - a good
grocery gettin car.
A moment.
RIC
You wantta take a ride?
NATALIE
(LAUGHING)
Jesus - you don't change, do you?.
RIC
Change? No, I don't change. Everything
around me changes. You change. You take my
house, you take my kids, you fuck this
other y- No, I don't change at all.
NATALIE
It's not your house.
RIC
Oh- No?
NAT I o?
No- And as far as fucking oes - .who was it
that answered your phone t %e other morning?
RIC
She...
2-
NAT IE
I don't care. Really, you can just stop
now. It's not working.
He takes a breath.
RIC
I just want.. -a chance.
NATALIE
For what? To fool them for a few days into
thinking they have a real father, and then
it's back to
RIC
(cutting her off)
I their father.
NATALIE
(VEHEMENT)
No, Richard. You know what defines a
father? It's what he does, not what he
promises. It's being a positive,
consistent presence.
Richard eyes her suspiciously. 13
RIC
(mimicking  her )
"Positive consistent presence." Wow. What
does that mean? I just don't get it. But
I'm not fucking a college boy, am I?
NATALIE
Look ...can you just go now? I really don't
want you here when they get back.
RIC
Oh, no, wouldn't want that.
He doesn't budge.
NATALIE
You have to leave.
Finally, as if struck b some small discove . Richard places
his large hands on the kitchen table and pus es himself up.
He heads past Natalie without looking back. He closes the door
firmly be ind him.
'I. NAT IE' S HOUSE - FRONT YARD -,RUSK
Frank's truck parked out front
The lawn is littered with the boy's various plastic weapons
a small wading pool.
25
A children's television show is heard from inside.
Natalie is sprawled out on a chaise lounge, nursing a beer, and
sharing a cigarette with Frank, who is on his hands & knees
finishing an elaborte structure with a set of FROEBEL wooden
blocks.
NATALIE
You know I've been ignoring our
difference in age, but if you keep
playing with those blocks, I'm gonna
start to worry.
F
They're not blocks - they're gifts.
NATALIE
I'm sorry I know they're a gift and a
very generous one. I'm gust concerned
that Dunk. might think e's a little old
to be playing with them.
FRANK
They're not for playing - they're to learn about
unity & balance. Froebel called them "Gifts."
This is the second gift - a sphere, a cube, and a
cylinder. A five year old can learn the
difference in form depending on how they look at
them.
Why didn't he say so in the first place?
NATALIE
Oh ou said second gift. How many are
are there?
FRANK
Twenty.
A moment.
NATALIE
You've been pla in with these - excuse
me, working wit t ese for how long?
F
Since I was about Dunk's age. My mom took
me tough all twenty.
So that's what a good mother does.
NATALIE
.oh.
FRANK ??0
Come on down here and take a look.
She sets down her beer and Joins him. The small wooden structure
looks like a home that could have been built by Lautner or Wright
Frank looks pleased. Natalie is distracted.
26
NATALIE
Your Mother gave you these Frank - I feel
funny Duncan having them.
F
Don't be silly, it was her idea.
NATALIE
(SCEPTICAL)
Really?
F
You're not looking at the house - look.
It's not all mine, it's part Mack.
Frank speaks excitedly, as he makes a quick sketch on a colored
piece of construction paper using one of the boys' markers.
F
See the whole ideal of what Mack was
trying to achieve was a common area in the
middle of the house. I mean - a large,
common space wasn't uni e to Mack, but
the idea of separating the family so that
the kids were on one side and the parents
on the other, so they would all spill into
the center ...
He looks over to Natalie, checking in.
She smiles, and shifts her gaze.
F
I'm boring you, aren't I?
NATALIE
(SOFTLY)
No, not at all, I was just... . just
thinking.
F
About what?
NATALIE
About you. . ,school,
F
I'd rather talk about our house.
NATALIE
I know you would.
F
What if I wait a year?
NATALIE
R
F
A year's not going to make a difference.
27
NATALIE
You can't do that, Frank.
F
I've thought a lot about this.
NATALIE
But you told me it takes forever just to
establish yourself.
F
Exactl , so what's a year in forever?
Know w at Duncan said today?
She can't suppress a smile.
NATALIE
You wouldn't be changing the subject
would you?
FRANK
Yes.
NATALIE
What now?
F
He said, "Frank, I don't think Jason
really understands girls."
NATALIE
(LAUGHING)
He didn't!
F
He did ... "understands girls!"
NATALIE
What did you say?
F
I said, "give him time, Duncan."
They both break up.
F
I didn't know what to say! if this is how
he is now - boy are we in trouble-
He stops short. The word - We - hangs in the air. They watch each
other, unsure of how to react. Changing the subject quickly. Frank
reaches down to the grass and comes up with one of Duncan's toys. A
real musclebound superhero. Somewhat grotesque.
F

Richard gave it to Dunk for his birthday.

Frank sets it down.
The HEADLIGHTS OF APPROACHING CAR rake across ACTION
I NT. ROCKLAND HIGH SCHOOL MUSIC ROOM - NIGHT
Half a dozen girls age 15 to 18, are gathered in Ruth's
classroom. Desks and chairs are stacked up for summer recess.
The girls are in shorts and T-shirts, one with a picture of
the solar system, and another with the Pink Panther. Bri ht
bathing-suit straps are visible around some of their nec s:
This afternoon they were sw' ng. A few look sleepy enough
to be in bed already. Ruth stands with her arms up- keeping
time and controlling the dynamics. A single girl sings "The
Drone"` a low monotone one hears underneath the other voices.
They sing the Balkan folk song "Oj Savice."
CHORUS (SUBTITLED)
Oh, Sava, carry me across our quiet cool
water. There is my dear village and in
that village, the prettiest girl.
Without embarrassment, they shriek they drone, and at their
ease they whistle. The music transports these girls - who are
normally pre-occupied with images of MTV and Brad Pitt, to a
place of pure self. The song ends.
RUTH
That was really good! OK it's 7:30
we should stop.
The girls gather up their things quickly.
RUTH
Remember when you sing these words-
The way we feel about the harbor, is how
the Balkans felt about the river Sava.
The girls start out of the room.
RUTH
Listen to your tapes "Moilih Tan is still
very rough and we've of a 40 minute
program to get ready by Labor Day.
I NT. FOWLER HOUSE - NIGHT - LIVINGROOM
Ruth enters. She's beat. She starts to put her purse down, when
SHE NOTICES:
Matt, kneeling in front of the reclining chair. It's back is to
her.
MATT
Just hold still ...
29
Ruth drops her purse and quickly comes around the recliner.
Something stops her.
RUTH
Oh my God.
Matt holds Frank's jaw. He gently turns his face toward the
lamp.
Frank has stitches over his right eye. The blood under the
white of the pupil oozing. Both lips are bright and swollen.
F
DAD
MATT
Come on, Frank. Hold still.
Ruth hovers, in shock.
RUTH
This was her husband, wasn't it?
Frank nods wearily.
F
Ex, he dropped in.
He takes the compress from Matt and gingerly applies it to his
forehead.
MATT
Press charges.
F
No.
RUTH
What's to stop him from doing it again?
MATT
Did you hit him at all? Tell me you hit
him! Enough so he won't want to next time?
F
I don't think I touched him.
Matt pulls up the skin around the bloody eye.
F
! Jesus, Dad!
Ruth stares at the Hospital band around Frank's wrist.
8 -`V
MATT
So what are you going to do?
F
(SMILING)
Take Karate.
30
RUTH
That's not the problem.
F
You know you like her.
RUTH
I like a lot of people. What about the
boys? Did they see it?
F
They were asleep.
RUTH
Did you leave her alone with him?
FRANK
He left first. She was yelling at ham. I
believe she had a skillet in her hand.
RUTH
Oh for God's sake.
(TO MATT)
Did you call the police?
Not yet.
RUTH
You didn't call them?
MATT
When was I going to call the police, Ruth?
He just got in.
Ruth scans the room.
RUTH
Where's the phone?
F
MOM! hold on a second,
Calm down. Let's just talk about this.
Ruth wavers.
Now the cops'll go to her place first --
and it'll scare the hell out of the kids.
RUTH
Matt.
I
MATT %Q,
We have to call them Frank.
F
It wasn't that serious.
31
RUTH
Of course. Just like the relationship
isn't serious.
HATT
Ruth, this is not the time.
RUTH
Well, when is the time? After he knocks
him into a coma? This is stopping. Now.
F
Oh really?
RUTH
Come Fall, you're on a plane. Are you
taking them with you? How- do you think the
boys will feel when you disappear?
F
HEY A
RUTH
This isn't just some sweetie from Vassar,
that you'll see on holidays, Frank.
You're not in this alone.
Frank rises and leaves the room.
RUTH
Please listen. The sooner you end this
thing the better.
Ruth exhales.
She returns to Matt, who is leaning against the recliner, chin
in hand, deep in thought.
RUTH
What are we going to do?
Matt deliberates.
MATT
I don't know.
RUTH
.you've got to talk to him.
HATT
I don't ow.,,I think he's right about
scaring the kids. Why don't we call it a
night? We'll deal with it tomorrow.
RUTH
Matt are you going to call the police or
do I have to?
You just ..s- Bd me what I think. if you
want to call them. call them.
32
Ruth looks at him, stupefied.
Without warning, Ruth leaves and goes upstairs.
I NT. FOWLER HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
Ruth lies on her side reading. Matt comes in from the
hallway.
He stares at her.
She ignores him.
Finally, she turns over and faces him.
RUTH
It's not the first time she's played
around.
Matt seems relieved that she's talking to him. He sits on the
bed and starts taking off his shoes.
MATT
She's not with the guy anymore.
RUTH
I mean from before.
MATT
What are you talking about?
RUTH
Oh, come on - you've heard the same
things I have.
MATT
I think you forget. I don't take my lunch
in the teachers lounge -
RUTH
Maybe he still loves her.
Matt looks from Ruth, out the bedroom door, and into the
hallway. He sees Frank rounding the top of the stairs.
He gets up and closes the bedroom door.
I NT. F R HOUSE F 'S ROOM - S
Frank enters the room, pulls off his T-shirt and drops it on
the floor. He walks over and faces a wall mirror. He seems
nonplussed by what he sees.
INTO HENRY'S FISH SHACK - DAY
Henry Czar sits holding court with Jason Frank, whose facial
bruises have all but healed, the stitches replaced by a
butterfly bandage. They eat cod tongues and cheeks. Drink soda
pop from bottles.
33
HENRY
Best part of the cod - but most
outsi ers, they won't touch it.
The shack is too warm and smells of cordage and paint,
spilled beer and male sweat. Jason is in heaven.
HENRY
The summer fishermen, the part-timers,
like Frank here - get in your hair.
HENRY
There's as many as 80 of em with licenses
now - should put up a sign - "Fish your
own backyard or lose your traps0"
Frank smiles at Jason.
FRANK
A lobster is simple enough Jason. But if
the guy going after him is even simpler
well he might as well give up.
HENRY
Don't hurt my feelings any. Easy to talk

HENRY
Don't you listen to him son - that boat
is fine. She was my first.
Takes a sip of pop.
HENRY
Kinda miss her sometimes, and that truck
you're driving .when you headed back to
school Frank?-
For some reason this strikes both of them as funny and they
crack up. Not Jason, he seems concerned by the question.
Frank sees this.
Hen sits alone at the wooden table. There are three plates of cod,
and 3 soda-pops. Frank comes in exhausted. Henry looks up.
HENRY
You're nn'in late.
Frank nods. Takes a seat, and starts in on the cod.
Henry looks at the empty seat next to Frank.
HENRY
Where's our boy?
Frank ignores the question.
Frank drives. Traps stacked in the bed.
He slows down to gaze out his window, as he passes
NAT IE' S HOUSE.
The truck crawls to a stop.
He takes the moment, storin each detail: Folded up lounge
chairs. Scattered toys on t 9e porch. A tipped-over tricyle.
He idles, as if waiting for someone. After one last look he
drives off.

The choir finishes the last strains. Ruth is happy the

Willis opened this place after serving as a chief petty officer

Don't worry, I didn't make em.
Matt takes a bite. He winces.
WILLIS
What? Oh, that's mine.
He switches plates.
WILLIS
Sorry.
Matt takes another bite. Better,
WILLIS
You got back to work so quick, Matt. It's
not too soon?
MATT
I can't stay home. So, how's business?
WILLIS
Oh,.you know, same old crap. Got held up
again, you knew that.
MATT
No. I didn't.
WILLIS
yeah...they got seventy five bucks.
MATT
Were you on the till?
Willis chuckles, shakes his head.
WILLIS
They would have gotten something else if
I'd been on the till.
Matt nods.
WILLIS
How you doin', Matt?
You on't write, you don't call. Where'd
the love go? '0-'
MATT
Nag nag nag.
Matt glances at an old clipping from the BOSTON GLOBE stapled
to the wall. It's a photo from the 67 Redsox dream to
48
Petrocelli, Yaztrems i and Reggie Smith, each hold u two
fingers, they are s ling after hitting consecutive omeruns.
Matt remembers. Happier days.
WILLIS
They set the bail hearing yet?
MATT
Sometime in the next few days.ye ,
WI IS
Are you going?
MATT
I don't ow. Davis says it's a formallity
really. I haven't talked to Ruth about
weather she thinks we should go or not.
WILLIS
If it's too much for Ruth, I'll come with
you Matt.
MATT
Thanks, but I'm sure it'll be alright-
Davis says it's a formallity really.
WILLIS
The criminal trial set yet?
MATT
October.
WILLIS
October?
MATT
That's what they tell me, anyway.
WILLIS
Christ, they take their time.
MATT
.yeah, well, he's in there now.
WILLIS
They're keeping him busy, I'm sure - You
know where they'll move h once he's
sentenced?
Matt shifts the focus to his omelette.
MATT
You have any Tabasco sauce?
Willis pauses. He looks around, ca `out to the kitc hen.
WILLIS
Hey, Pete. Tabasco. Pete! Ah, shit.
He heads to the back. Matt looks out the window. A refrigera ted
truck with the STROUT logo on it's side pulls to a stop at the
light. Willis returns with sauce in hand.
49
He takes a seat. Shifts his tone again.
WILLIS
Next weekend Matt- We really want you to
come up to the c p- Katie's insisting.
Not to pressure you or anything. But if
you don't come se's going to invite her
sister and that idiot and I know I'm
going to wind up insulting him again.
Matt considers this.
WILLIS
The future of my family is in your hands.
MATT
Let me ask Ruth.
WILLIS
You know, your seat is getting cold at the
game. We have Carl's kid subbing for you.
Not that we mind - he loses every time
But we'd rather take your money.
MA T T T
(SMILING)
Thanks.
Matt stares aimlessly out the window.
Willis goes back to his eggs.
Both men comfortable enough with each other to be silent.
WILLIS
How's Ruth doing?
MATT
Alright. Her...her car broke down.
WILLIS
Always something.
T PHONE RINGS OVER:

Matt carries the bags into the kitchen.
MATT .S.
Fine. Saw Willis-
RUTH
My day was fine, too, thanks.
Matt comes out of the kitchen.
MATT
Sorry. ,how was your day?
Tried calling - thought you might have
gone out. The Grinnel's invited us up to
the camp next weekend. Said I'd check with
you, if we had other plans
RUTH
That sounds fine.

Hello, Mr. & Mrs. Fowler, this is Regina
at the District attorney's office
Mr.Davis would like to speak with you
both just as soon as possible.
51
A windowless rotunda. JUDGE WILLIAM WILKENSON presides.
CLOSE WILKENSON
WILKENSON
Mr. Strout has been in the custodyof The
Knox County Sherrif's department since
August second, held without bail.The
court is obliged to hold a bail hearing
within two weeks of incarceration , which
is the purpose of our procedings here
today. Given the schedule considerations
on this docket, the court feels that we
should conduct the probable cause hearing
in tandem. Witnesses will be called at
this time. Unless there are any
objections to the contrary this court
will recess until 2:00 p.m.
A gray concrete room, washed out by the buzzing overhead
florescent.
Matt and Ruth sit on metal fold-out chairs, alongside twenty or
so spectators, and a smattering of reporters, in the gallery.
Richard unkempt and dressed in an ORANGE JUMPSUIT, sits
patientiy next to one of his two attorneys.
Matt and Ruth glance over at
NATHAN STROUT, 62, sitting directly behind Richard.
Nathan's two other sons, both big men like Richard, sit at his
side.
Nathan feels the Fowlers, stares. His eyes stay focused on the
front of the room.
Richard's trial attorney, MARLA S, 301s, smart, expensive, and a
long way from her home in Boston, stands in the COURT WELL.
Natalie Strout in the witness box.
So, Mr. Fowler had asked you to go
upstairs with your chil, ?z s your

DAVIS
objection. Mrs. Strout's police interview
is already documented, the defense has a
copy of it. There's no reason to waste
anymore of the court's time . - .
KEYES
Your Honor, we just want to review exactly
what s. Strout saw on the afternoon of
July 17th. Isn't that why we're here?
The Judge nods.
JUDGE
overruled.
(TO NATALIE)
Please continue.
Natalie tries to recapture her place. Keyes nods.
MARLA KEYES
(RECAPPING)
So you were bringing your children up to
their bedroom ...
Natalie's glance wanders to the gallery, to Matt and Ruth.
She,sits on her hands to keep them from shaking.
NATALIE
0 Right. I was in Jason and Dunk's room I
didn't know what was happening downstairs. I was
getting worried. I asked Jason to read Dunk a
story. He didn't want a story - He wanted to come
with me ... so I sat him back down on the bunk
and I left them in the room.
KEYES
You left "them"?
NATALIE
My boys.
She starts to cry.
KEYES
(SOFTLY)
Of course - I'm sorry. on.
NATALIE
I closed the door...I moved down the hall. I
looked back to make sure they weren't behind me.
I had just started down the stairs, when I heard
the shot. I ran down...
A deep sob ...
NATALIE
.and Richard...
53
KEYES
I'm sorry, can we just back up? You said
you "heard the shot"?
NATALIE
Yes.
KEYES
You "heard"? s- Strout, did you witness
the accident?
Prosecutor Davis jumps up.
DAVIS
b`ection. There are no grounds to
in icate this was an "accident"
The Judge nods.
JUDGE
(TO STENOGRAPHER)
Please strike "accident" from the record.
(to Marla Keyes)
Ms. Keyes, please rephrase the question.
Marla Keyes hasn't taken her eyes off Natalie. They both know
what's next.
KEYES
(GENTLY)
Mrs. Strout ...did you actually see the
sidearm discharge?
I NT. DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - DAY
Davis hands a cup of coffee to Matt, who sits on a faux leather
couch with Ruth.
DAVIS
(to Ruth re: coffee)
You sure you don't want?
RUTH
I'm fine.
Davis takes a seat across from them.
DAVIS
You see, we can't appeal bail - It's just
not set up that way.
RUTH - -y
You let that bastard walk out and we're
supposed to just sit here? Don't tell us
there's nothing to do about this.
DAVIS
It's not us, s. Fowler. The state's bail
code is to ensure future court appearances
54
DAVIS
In this case Strout's family was prepared to
put up a substantial amount of property as
bail - That, along with his ties to the
community made it hard for us to convince the
judge of a serious "Risk of Flight".
RUTH
Oh - I see.
DAVIS
It's not just your case. Now you can file a civil
suit. I recommend it. But not now, wait till
after the crimminal trial.
Matt stares at a small cartoonish statue on Davis's desk. It is
one of those things that were popular in the 70's. A little man
chasing an ambulance. It reads "World's Greatest Lawyer."
RUTH
And when will that be? Next week, next
month?
DAVIS
Well... honestly - anywhere between twelve
and eighteen months?
RUTH
I thought you said there would be a jury
trial sometime in October!?
DAVIS
If he was incarcerated the udge would
move for an October date - basically to
save the County the cost of housing and
feeding him as an inmate - But with bail
the court date, unfortunately, is always
later.
RUTH
Oh my god, oh my god.
Matt jumps in.
MATT
But you're confident you'll be able to put
him away for good then... Right?
Davis looks uncomfortable with the question.
Ruth sees this. She gathers herself.
??
RUTH EJ
The things she said in there ...what is the
damage?
DAVIS
Manslaughter.
55
RUTH DAVIS
What? Oh, Jesus Christ! The wav this is going, that'd
be my bet - especially since
Nathan Strout brought up that
barracuda from Boston - she's
very smart.
RUTH
This was no accident. Be killed our son in
cold blood.
Ruth.
RUTH
What?
MATT
How long would he be sent away for?
DAVIS
Hard to say really. Anywhere between five
to fifteen years. We think we have a good
shot at the max - fifteen. Even with good
behavior, he'd do a full ten.
RUTH
Ten years? Five years? Are you out of your
mind!? He killed my son. Does anyone know
this?
Matt looks at his shoes, as Ruth glares down Davis.
Davis sits back, a little shook up.
DAVIS
I'm sorry, s. Fowler. I understand.
Unfortunately, in situations like this
when there is no eye witness, there ...
well, there's not a lot we can do.
Matt drives. Ruth looks out the windshield.
Both in their own worlds.
Ruth turns to look out her side window.
T CANNERY'S STACKS ARE HUMPING.
RUTH
You took the whole day?
Matt nods.
CAR DRIVES PAST T SITE.
Matt wearing a light coat over his pajamas, sits behind the
wheel of his car listening to the game.
He glances down at a piece of paper with an address. Then back
out his windshield, looking at the corner duplex unit.
Ruth sits at the table in her bathrobe. Smoking. The CAMDEN
HERALD in one hand. The COURIER GAZETTE, and THE WORKING
WATERFRONT within easy reach.
Matt enters, fully dressed in jeans and a sweater. He winces at
the smoke.
RUTH
You slept late. For you.
Matt pours himself some coffee.
MATT
I took one of your pills.
58
RUTH
You never do that.
She turns the page, absorbed in an article.
Shaking her head, she slaps the paper down.
RUTH
Well there it is in black and white. You
should read some of the things he says.
Unbelievable.
Matt takes a sip of coffee. He glances down at the paper.
He nods, without really looking.
MATT
yeah.
He checks his watch.
MATT
I should get going.
RUTH
Where? It's Saturday.
MATT
I won't be gone long.
He bends, kisses her lightly on the cheek.
MATT
I'm meeting Willis. I'll tell him we're
coming.
She stares at the kitchen doorway long after he exits.
Finally, she pulls the paper back and resumes reading.
. CANDY'S QUICK SHOP - DAY
Natalie stands behind the only counter cf a small MOM AND POP
STORE whose specialty is cold beer, wine, cigarettes, and fish
& Game Licenses. She rings up some items for a couple of
teenagers.
Matt enters the place, keeping his distance, a few feet from
the counter.
Natalie sees him.
She pauses, as if quickly trying to-,gather her thoughts, the
teenagers are waiting for their chang .
She counts it back to them, and they exit.
Matt steps forward.
59
Hi.
NATALIE

Natalie quickly rings up the items and bags them.
ELDERLY WOMAN
Can you break a fifty?
Natalie takes the bill, places it in a drawer underneath the
register, and hands the woman her change, with a smile.
ELDERLY WOMAN
Thank you, dear.
NATALIE
You're welcome.
ELDERLY WOMAN
Could I possibly get another bag?
Natalie quickly double bags the woman's groceries.
There is a break in the customer flow. Natalie steps to the end
of the counter.
MATT
I just wanted to see how you're doing. I
tried reaching you ...
NATALIE
Oh. We're at my mother's house now. I'm
sorry, I wanted to call you ...
MATT
It's okay.
She looks over. A man hovers over some ina?azines near the
re inter.
NATALIE
(ALMOST WHISPERING)
Dr. Fowler ..-I' so...I don't even know
how to begin...
MATT
You don't have to.
NATALIE ? er
I didn't lie the first time, I didn't,
it's just - how it came out. I'm so sorry.
matt nods, as if he had assumed as much.
60
NATALIE
Is s- Fowler .-- does she know you're
here?
The Man places a 12- ack of beer on the counter. Natalie looks
to Matt, who shakes his head no.
Natalie steps back to the register and rings up the beer.
Her chin quivers. She makes a mistake on the register, has to
start over.
A few more customers gather on line.
NATALIE
(TO CUSTOMER)
Can I get you anything else?
She rings him up. Makes change as another customer steps up.
Matt steps near her, trying to maintain privacy.
MATT
(QUIETLY)
How are the boys? Are they okay?
Natalie, choked by emotion, cannot respond. Near tears, she
puts her hand up, unable to speak.
Matt reaches out to touch her arm.
His gesture is interrupted as:
She pulls the cigarettes from an overhead rack. The Man pays.
Matt stays a moment longer. There's nothing else to say.
He leaves.
She returns to her job.
A small bouti e frequented by mature women. Blouses with a flair,
pantsuits, an nice dresses han from the racks. The sort of place a
woman can still buy a pair Joze a white gloves. The front of the store
is devoted to footwear.
Ruth sits while YVONNE, 45, kneels in front of her, holding
Ruth's stockinged foot. She slips on a dress shoe.
YVONNE
Oh, they're beautiful on you Ruth.
Ruth stands up, takes a few steps.
She stares at the shoes.
They are a rich black.
RUTH
Do you have them in brown?
YVONNE
I think so, let me check.
Yvonne disappears into the back.
Ruth walks to the front of the store, browsing.
She moves to the display window and brings a pair of very
young pumps u to her nose, and inhales. She smiles and sets
the shoes bac on the ledge.
Something OUTSIDE catches her attention.
Ruth looks disoriented.
YVONNE O.S.
I'm sorry Ruth - there's only the black.
63
She turns from the window. Yvonne stands next to her, an open
shoe box in her hands.
Ruth is at the table, alone, dressed for rehearsal, hair done.
She finishes her breakfast as she pours through the weekend's
mail.
Matt in a suit, steps in to say goodbye.
MATT
I'm going now.
She looks up.
RUTH
(FLAT)
Okay.
MATT
You ready to go back?
RUTH
70
MATT
(T IN )
You loo nice.
ANGLE
Who looks to Ruth for some kind of reaction. Nothing.
Matt heads out the door.
Ruth continues sorting the mail.
She stops on one piece. Seems stunned, repeatedly reading it.
THE ENVELOPE
It's from Publisher's Clearinghouse.
In oversized block letters, it reads,
FRANK FOWLER, YOU MAY HAVE ALREADY WON $10,000,000!
She stares at the piece for a long time.
Looks off. Smiles. And starts giggling. She can't stop.
The giggles quickly flow into a deep laughing fit, harder and
harder as the tears rain down.
Matt is in his office, on the phone.
MATT
(INTO PHONE
Well that's totall unacceptable isn't
it? - Well what did he say? uh huh
well, we can't allow that m I guess
we're gonna have to show him how the cow
eats the cabbage.
Janelle knocks on the door.
MATT
Hold on a second.
He puts his mouth over the speaker and lowers the phone.
Nods to Janelle and she enters.
JANELLE
Dr. Fowler, I'm sorry. There's someone '
Ryan Collit. His mother`N brought him
in. He doesn't have an appointment but--
I'm sorry bL _; you'll have to re-schedule.
Janelle's a little taken aback.
71
JANELLE
He's Ann Collit's son. I thought. Well, you know, I
thought you might want to
MATT
(into the phone)
I'll call back later.
He hangs up.
He gets up and grabs his jacket
MATT
Sorry Janelle, I'll be back at four.
JANELLE
(UNCOMFORTABLE)
.o.k.
Matt leaves her standing there.
I NT. DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - DAY
LOBBY
William Davis's secretary, REGINA, 40, sits at her desk. She is
on a call, Matt stands waiting.
REGINA
(HANGING UP)
I'm Sorry, Dr. Fowler, you just missed
him.
MATT
I really need to see him.He go to lunch?
REGINA
That's right.
She senses something in his tone.
REGINA
He's across the street.

A bustling dining room, packed with businessmen. The nice

The doors open. Matt enters.
He scans the room. His eyes set on
WILLIAM DAVIS
sitting at a table with colleagues, sharing a laugh.
72
Matt makes his way over to the table.
Davis sees h'
DAVIS
Hey, Matt.
Matt stands awkwardly, as Davis' companions look on.
DAVIS
(POLITE)
Have a seat.
Matt hesitates, takes a seat next to Davis.
Manages an obligatory smile to the others. The conversation
resumes.
EXT - MARKET ON MAIN RESTAURANT - STREET LATER
On the street outside the restaurant, walking.
DAVIS
We're doing all we can, Matto I promise
you that.
MATT
What can I do Bill?
DAVIS
There's nothing...
Matt takes Davis' arm.
MATT
It can't be manslaughter. There's got to
be something - isn't there something you
can find? A piece of evidence? That
happens - doesn't that happen?
He realizes he's holding Davis' arm. He lets goo
Davis looks at Matt sympathetically.
DAVIS
We really are doing everything we can,
Matt - But I'm not going to lie to you -
We've got no witnesses - only Strout - who
claims there was a struggle - and forensic
can't determine if there was a struggle.
because of the condition the house was in
when Frank got there.
Matt says nothing. Q.,
They come to the corner.
Matt steps under an awning and into the shade.
73
Davis stops. He shifts feet a couple of tes. Pla ing with
the change in his pocket, the way people do when they're
uncomfortable.
DAVIS
I'm sorry att. if it helps, we all want
this guy put away. We have kids, too.
Matt nods, without looking at him.
Matt looks at Davis's hand moving the change. He becomes
hypnotized by the sound.
Davis continues talking. Matt can't hear a word of it,
though. All he hears is the clinking of the coins in the
pocket.
A crowded working class tavern. Video oker machines, beef jerky at
the bar, Schaeffer's on tap. We're in fuck. it's happy-hour.
Tim sits around a table with a couple of buddies, laughing.
CHARLES
We lost a few strings and we had a fair
idea it was him who was doing it - so's I
just flat out asked him "No wasn't me."
You should of seen what he tried to pull
last wintah. He was up to the island there
- and he claimed our traps were in his
part of the cove - Bobb was up to the
tavern on the head and e d him shooting
his mouth off about how he and his
stet an was gonna take a bat to the old
man & me - so's I told the old man about
it and he says "Don't hurt my feelings
none."He says "Go on down to the Walmart
and buy a couple of plastic bats."
Next day the old man walks intah the
office at the market - near the scales -
where he know's the son of a bitch is
gonna come in with his catch. He's got two
six penny nails a hammer, and the bats
o'coarse, so he nails those things right
intah the wall. The guy at the scales
looks at him like he's nuts "Whatta ya
doing there Ivan" he says "Just sending a
message" and the old man walks out. I come
in and I could see what he wrote across
them things.
The door to the bar opens.
TIM
What?
CHARLES
"Here's the bats - if you got the balls."
Tim and the others crack up.
CHARLES
Didn't touch our traps aftah that.
stops mid sentence.
76
Matt is passing by his table.
TIM
Dr. Fowler?
Matt flinches, "surprised" to see Tim.
A FEW MINUTES LATER
Matt and Tim have moved to another booth.
Matt leans heavily on his elbows, listening to Tim.
TIM
No - no, I don't even see Richard anymore.
And he'd never tell me anything, believe
Me.
Matt takes a pull of beer.
MATT
Sure, of course. I was just wondering, you
know, maybe there was something you
heard, through the grapevine, maybe one
of his buddies said something ---
TIM
(SEARCHING MEMORY)
No -a-
MATT
I was thinking, Richard's brothers,
they're still working with you, right?
They must talk.
Tim throws a nervous look over to the table where his friends
ea They're oblivious to the conversation.
He looks back to Matt, shifting in his seat.
Matt leans forward. He speaks in an intense whisper.
MATT
I'm just saying, Tim, if we could find
something, something concrete. If you
could just ... it could be just a slip of
the tongue ---
Tim looks into Matt's eyes, feeling the torment.
TIM
I'll keep my ears open.
Matt looks at him, dissatisfied.
TIM
It's funny running into you here, Dr.
Fowler.
Matt looks at Tim blankly, then finishes his beer.
77
They drive back through town, the sea wall on their left hiding
the beach.
on the right are the places, most with their neon signs off,
that do so much business in s er: the lounges and cafes and
pizza houses. The street itself empty of traffic.
RICHARD
He was making it with my wife.
His voice is careful, not pleading.
Matt presses hard with the muzzle against Richard's head.
Richard flinches and moves his head forward.
Matt lowers the gun to his lap.
MATT
Don-t talk.
BOOM
THE GUN KICKS IN MATT'S HAND.
THE GUN'S REPORT ECHOES FOR ETERNITY.
MATT STANDS ABSOLUTELY STILL.
STILL HOLDS THE LITTLE SUITCASE.
LOOKS DOWN AT RICHARD STROUT SQUIRMING ON HIS BELLY. KICKING
ONE LEG BEHIND HIM, PUSHING HIMSELF FORWARD, TOWARD THE WOODS.
MATT WATCHES DISPASSIONATELY.
STEPS FORWARD, RAISES THE GUN AND FIRES ONE MORE SHOT.
RICHARD STOPS MOVING.
Matt stands there motionless.
We hear FOOTSTEPS.
Willis runs up to Matt.
STOPS AT RICHARD'S CORPSE.
WILLIS
(BREATHLESS)
MATT
The two men look into each others eyes. Matt seems to be somewhe re else
He looks back down at the body.
WILLIS
This isn't what we talked out,
MATT
He tried to run.
Willis looks at the gun still in Matt's hand, the little
suitcase in the other.
WILLIS
We were going to wait, and take him out in
the woods.
Matt raises his head. He looks at Willis flatly.
105
MATT
I coul t wait.
BODY -
a d in a BLUE TARP, is suddenly dragged away by the ATV. It
es quite a racket.
We follow it as it scrapes along, the road back into the woods
WOODS -
They have roved the body from the ATV and are now draggin it
deep into the wood. The only sound is the breaking of brans es
and their continual grunting.
The stopat the top of a small knoll, panting and sweating.
Wil is quietly removes a small mass of branches, revealing a o t
large, well-dug hole. Together, they drag the body t he edge
of the hole. Move behind it. Lift the legs, and push it in.
THE WOODS - LATER -
Willis and Matt come up from the woods. They carry Richard's
lug age. Willis drops the canvas bags into the hole. Matt
loo s at the suitcase and then drops it in.
Willis takes a couple of steps away, and grabs two shovels
leaning against a small birch. He hands one to Matt.
Together, they begin filling in the hole.
SAME PLACE - LATER -
Matt holds the flashlight as Willis sprinkles leaves and
branches over the hole.
Willis freezes, as if he has heard something. Matt cuts the
light.
They hear some footsteps approaching, closer, then they see it -
A DEER

Then he bounds off and is gone.
WOODS LATER -
The walk through the woods. The light on the ground. They
bot look up through the trees where they end at the lake.
Neither of them speak, only the sounds of their hea breathing
and clumsy strides through the low brush and over fa len
branches.
