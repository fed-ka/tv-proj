  11FROM BLACK - INT. PURDY'S OFFICE - DAY

          We drop right down into the middle of a nightmarish scene. 
          Purdy, looking beat up and scared, stands in his darkened
          office, silhouetted against the bright windows.  He's
          keeping his eye on someone off camera.

                                        PURDY
                        It's mine damnit.  You want it,
                        you'll have to kill me first.

          He lunges for his desk drawer, pulling a gun.

                                        VOICE (O.S.)
                        Don't be crazy.  This isn't worth
                        dying for.

          We SEE VISION JOHNNY (Observer) watching from the corner
          of the room.

                                        PURDY
                        You're wrong.  It might be the
                        only thing worth dying for.

          The view shifts to reveal the source of the voice: A MAN
          IN A MASK.  A THIEF of some kind, wearing a black
          balaclava.

                                        MASKED THIEF
                        Are you sure about that?

          The MASKED MAN reaches up and peels off the mask, REVEALING
          JOHNNY SMITH.

                                        PURDY
                        Johnny?

                                        JOHNNY
                         You have 30 seconds to do the
                        right thing.  If you don't, a
                        good man is going to die.

          Just then, the door to Purdy's office bursts open, and as
          Johnny turns to look, THE VISION ENDS.

                                        PURDY (V.O.)
                        Everything all right in here?          DEAD ZONE: "INSIDE MAN" - TEASER - 4/10/05 - PINK      2.


  22INT. PURDY'S OFFICE - DAY

          Reverend Purdy, looking happy and healthy, stands
          expectantly in front of Johnny, who is shaken by the
          vision, but covers his reaction, knowing he can't trust
          Purdy until he knows more.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah, everything's fine.

                                        PURDY
                        If we hurry I can give you a quick
                        tour before the doors open for
                        the public.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I saw the line out front, you've
                        got a pretty good turnout.

                                        PURDY
                        As it should be.  This exhibition
                        of religious artifacts is one of
                        the largest collections ever to
                        go on loan... and we've got it
                        here at Faith Heritage.  Walk
                        with me...

  44INT. EXHIBITION HALL LOBBY - DAY

          Purdy leads Johnny through the lobby toward the main
          exhibition hall.  Beyond them, outside the front doors, a
          LINE OF PEOPLE wait for the doors to open as SEVERAL USHERS
          finish setting up velvet ropes to handle the crowd.  The
          lobby features several large graphic banners for "Objects
          of Faith" sponsored by Faith Heritage.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Who put the collection together?

                                        PURDY
                        The Haliwell Foundation.  One of
                        the oldest names in Europe.  Some
                        of the objects have been in the
                        family collection since before
                        the Crusades.


  55INT. MAIN EXHIBITION HALL - FOLLOWING PURDY

          Johnny is surprised by the transformation as they step
          into the Faith Heritage Auditorium, now converted into a

          stylish museum.

                                        PURDY
                        Welcome to "Objects of Faith"

                                        JOHNNY
                          Impressive.

                                        PURDY
                                  (confiding)
                        Ticket sales have been phenomenal. 
                        It's a huge source of spiritual
                          rejuvenation for the entire
                          congregation.

          The auditorium has been subdivided with curtains and
            temporary walls into various small galleries off a main
          large hallway.  There are paintings hung on temporary
          walls, and objects of various kinds; books, chalices,
          crucifixes, religious icons -- all of them displayed in
          glass cases with tasteful cool lighting.

          Purdy points at several large tapestries hanging
            prominently.

                                        PURDY
                        These tapestries were kept safe
                        by early Christians after the
                        fall of Rome.

          Purdy navigates from object to object.  He points to a
          glass case containing a large Bible, displayed open.

                                        PURDY
                        One of the highlights, a Gutenberg
                        Bible, printed in 1455.  One of
                        only nine in the country.

          Johnny takes a closer look.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Makes you wonder how much of
                        today's culture will still be
                        around 500 years from now.

                                        PURDY
                        We have a jade Buddha that's over
                        1000 years old.

          Johnny's mind is still on the disturbing, confusing vision
          from the Teaser.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "INSIDE MAN" - TEASER - 4/12/05 - GREEN     4.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You haven't told me why you asked
                        me here.

                                        PURDY
                        There's one object in particular
                          I wanted you to see.

          Johnny gets a sense that Purdy is up to something.


  66MEANWHILE - INT. EXHIBITION HALL LOBBY - DAY

          The view tracks down the line of people, discovering WALT
          and J.J. in line.  J.J. has a camera hanging around his
          neck.

                                        J.J.
                        How much longer?

                                        WALT
                        Any minute now.

                                        J.J.
                        I'm gonna miss swim practice.

                                        WALT
                        You won't miss practice.  Besides,
                          a little culture won't kill us. *
                        And you need the pictures for*
                        your school report.*

          Walt checks his watch, he's even getting a little tired.


  77INT. EXHIBITION HALL - THE CENTERPIECE OF THE EXHIBIT

          Johnny and Purdy arrive at the Apex of the show, right in
          the center of the hall.

          A large glass cube, about 6 feet high, surrounds a second
          heavy duty glass box atop a steel pedestal.  Inside the
          inner glass case is an ornately jeweled box, not much
          larger than a jewelry box.  The inner box is propped open,
          a mini spotlight illuminating the contents -- a small
          white shard of bone.

                                        JOHNNY
                        A bone?





                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "INSIDE MAN" - TEASER - 4/10/05 - PINK      5.


    7CONTINUED:7

                                        PURDY
                        Not just any bone.  A bone fragment
                        thought to belong to John the
                          Baptist.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (taken aback)
                        John the Baptist?  Like in the
                        Bible?

          Purdy beams and Johnny leans forward, his nose nearly
          touching the glass of the outer cube.

                                        PURDY
                        The tip of his index finger. 
                        We're talking about a piece of
                        the hand that baptized Christ.

                                        JOHNNY
                        How can you be sure?  It's not
                        like they have DNA to compare to.

                                        PURDY
                        It's been authenticated back to
                        the early days of Christianity,
                        but its actual origin is still a
                        matter of faith.

          Johnny stares at the object, absorbed in thought.  It's
          becoming obvious to Johnny that Purdy has some agenda
          here -- he's working up to something.

                                        PURDY
                          Crusades have been launched over
                        icons such as this.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I bet.

          An USHER approaches.

                                        USHER
                          Reverend, they're ready to open
                        the doors now.

                                        PURDY
                        I'll be right there.
                                (then to Johnny)
                        Makes you wonder, if it really is
                        the finger that first pointed
                        Christ out as the Messiah... what
                        you might see if you touched it?

                        Gene, I was wondering if we
                          could...

                        Hold that thought.

          Purdy exits, leaving Johnny behind with the object and
          his thoughts.  Obviously Purdy is up to something -
            something to do with this relic.  Looking around and
          finding himself alone, Johnny gingerly reaches out and
          touches the outer glass cube, triggering:


  88VISION FLASH -

          The cube shatters, showering Johnny with glass.


  99JOHNNY COMES OUT OF THE VISION

          To find the glass cube still intact -- at least for the
          moment.  Hearing a noise behind him, he turns around just
          in time to see the front doors open, Purdy greeting the
          anxious crowd as they spill inside.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

  1010INT. MAIN EXHIBITION HALL - DAY

          Walt and J.J. shuffle from exhibit to exhibit, the objects
          slowly working their magic on them.  Reaching a display
          about the Crusades featuring a suit of armor, J.J. calls
          back to Walt, who lingers behind at the Gutenberg Bible.

                                        J.J.
                        Whoa, check this out. 

          J.J. snaps a picture of the display.

                                        WALT
                        It's about the Crusades and the
                        search for the Holy Grail.  This
                        stuff is like something out of
                        Indiana Jones.

                                        J.J.
                        Did they ever find the Holy Grail?

                                        WALT
                        I'm not sure it ever existed.

                                        J.J.
                        Then why is everybody looking for
                        it?

                                        WALT
                        Good question.

          J.J. pops off another picture, then scoots off to the
          next exhibit.


  1111INT. JOHN THE BAPTIST RELIC DISPLAY

          Purdy rejoins Johnny near the glass cube where a small
          crowd has gathered.  Johnny watches the crowd suspiciously,
          trying to figure out what might cause the vision he had
          of the case shattering.

                                        PURDY
                        It's amazing the effect these
                          religious objects have on the
                          faithful.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You have a lot of security.  How
                          valuable is this stuff?

          Purdy stares at the relic inside the glass cube.

                                        PURDY
                        To the cynic, it's worthless. 
                        But to the true believer, one
                        object alone could fetch millions
                        of dollars.
                              (a beat)
                        I want to show you something else.

          Off Johnny's look...


  1212INT. SECURITY CONTROL ROOM - DAY

          Starting tight on a bank of security monitors, the VIEW
          WIDENS TO REVEAL Johnny and Purdy watching over the
          shoulder of TWO SECURITY GUARDS who watch the screens as
          they cycle through various angles of the exhibition.

                                        PURDY
                        State of the art security system. 
                          Infrared beams, motion detectors,
                          redundant alarms.  It was the
                        only way we could afford the
                          insurance premiums.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (casually)
                        The display cases?

                        Bullet proof glass and reinforced
                        steel bolted directly into the
                        floor.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Who would want to steal a religious
                        object?  Where would you sell it?

                                        PURDY
                        You'd be surprised.
                                (talking about himself)
                        There are wealthy, powerful men*
                        who, when faced with the prospect*
                        of their own mortality, begin
                        seeking answers.  They need to
                        repent, but they lack conviction. *
                        They need proof, before they can*
                          believe.  These artifacts provide*
                        some of the only tangible evidence
                        for faith in God.

                                  commercial)
                        Finger bone of a dead prophet? 
                          Millions of dollars.  Restored
                        faith in God... priceless.

            Something on one of the monitors catches Johnny's eye.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (to the Younger Guard)
                        Excuse me, can you zoom in on one
                        of these cameras?

          The Guard casts a look at Purdy, who nods.

                                        OLDER GUARD
                        Which one?

          Johnny points to one of the screens.

                                        JOHNNY
                        There.

          The camera zooms in on one of the displays, finding Walt
          and J.J.

          J.J. snaps another picture.

                        He's working on a school project.

          Johnny tries not to let his concern for J.J. show.


  1414RESUME JOHNNY AND PURDY

          Purdy is relieved it's only Walt and J.J.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (to the Younger Guard)
                        Thanks.

          Johnny touches the Guard's shoulder as he acknowledges
          him, triggering:          DEAD ZONE: "INSIDE MAN" - ACT ONE - 4/10/05 - PINK    10.


  1515VISION - MATCH MOVE MORPH - CONTROL ROOM - LATER

          Johnny finds himself immersed in a vision of the control
          room later.  He and Purdy are gone, and only the Younger
          Guard sits at the control panel, watching all the monitors.

          As Johnny watches, the Older Guard returns.

                                        YOUNGER GUARD
                        'Bout time.  I was supposed to go
                        on break ten minutes ago.

          The Older Guard just stands there, like he's waiting for
          something.  He nervously checks the clock.  Vision Johnny
          notes the time: 9:59.

                                        YOUNGER GUARD
                          Something wrong?

          The Older Guard doesn't answer, just looking at the clock
          again.  As the second hand reaches the hour mark...

            A MUFFLED BOOM shakes the building, knocking out the power,
          plunging the room into darkness.

                                        YOUNGER GUARD
                        What the hell was that?

          The FIRE ALARM begins ringing as emergency lights come on
          in the control room, and the security panel springs back
          to life, but the monitors reveal the main power is still
          out, only a few dim emergency lights illuminating the
          exhibition hall.  Frightened VISITORS struggle to find
          the exits on every screen.  VISION ENDS.


  1616RESUME JOHNNY - PRESENT REALITY

          Hiding his reaction to the vision, Johnny eyes the Older
          Security Guard, then checks the clock -- 9:50.

          Acting casual, Johnny changes position, leaning closer to
          the Older Guard, stealing a touch with the deftness of a
            pick-pocket, triggering:


  1717VISION - EXT. PRIVACY FENCE - NIGHT

          The dark figure of the Old Guard looks back over his
            shoulder, paranoid, as he walks along a stretch of fence
          that features vertical slots he can only partially see-
          through.  A voice stops him.  [Later we will know the
          voice belongs to Thief #1 (Brother Gregarin)]

                                        OLD GUARD
                        Your note said to make sure I
                        wasn't followed.

          The Old Guard tries to get a glimpse of the man on the
          other side of the fence, but the design of the slots never
          lets him see more than a slice of eye and mouth.

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN (VOICE)
                        Timing is everything with this
                        job.  Here's your gear.

          A black gym bag is pushed over the top of the fence,
          landing at the Old Guard's feet.

                                        OLD GUARD
                        Why all the mystery?

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN (VOICE)
                        We don't know you.  You don't
                        know us.  That protects everybody. 
                        Stick to the timetable.  Anything
                          changes, a lot of people are going
                        to get hurt -- starting with you.

          The VISION ENDS.


  1818RESUME JOHNNY - PRESENT REALITY

          Johnny comes out of the vision just as the Older Guard
          gets up from his chair.

                                        OLDER GUARD
                        I'm going to the 'head'.

                                        YOUNGER GUARD
                        Hurry up.  I'm supposed to be on
                        break.

          Johnny watches the Older Guard pick up the black gym bag
          and walk out.  Johnny exchanges a look with the Guard,
          who glances away, unable to make eye contact.

          Meanwhile, Purdy checks his watch.

                                        PURDY
                        Johnny, if you'll excuse me, I

                        Why don't you join the others and
                        I'll catch up with you.

          Was Purdy checking his watch just a coincidence?  Johnny
          wonders if Purdy and the Guard are somehow in it together. 


  1919INT. SERVICE CORRIDOR - MOVING

          Johnny watches as the Guard and Purdy part company, going
            different directions, Purdy heading back toward the
          exhibition floor, while the Older Guard continues on in
          the service corridor.  Johnny watches as the Guard swipes
          an I.D. card through a reader and pushes through a door
          marked "HIGH VOLTAGE."

          Johnny sees the door closing and silently slips across
          the hall, stopping the door just before the latch clicks
          shut.  Holding the door open a crack, he whips out his
          cell phone and speed dials Walt, but instead of getting a
          ring, an ear splitting tone nearly deafens him.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (thinking out loud)
                          Something's wrong with the phones.

          Johnny gives up on getting help, having no choice but to
          follow the Guard himself.


  2020INT. HIGH VOLTAGE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Johnny cautiously pushes open the door, finding a large,
          bunker-like room full of electrical panels, and a doorway
          leading to another room with the furnace and air systems. 
          Seeing no sign of the Guard, he quietly steals into the
          room, the sound of his movement covered by the loud HUM
          from the electrical plant.  Something on the floor draws
          his attention.


  2121P.O.V. - THE BLACK GYM BAG

          In it, Johnny can see: The mask from his vision, a black
          commando jacket, a gun, some electronic gear, a roll of
          gaffer's tape, and a few tools.  He reaches down and
          touches the gym bag, triggering:

          where the Young Guard looks.  On the monitors, people
          crowd the exits, but manage not to panic.

                        I've got smoke alarms everywhere

                        the radio calls while I dial 911.

          As the Young Guard dials 911, he looks up and sees:


          VIDEO MONITOR

          On the monitor covering the Main Entrance, we see SEVERAL
          FIREMEN ARRIVE wearing oxygen masks.

                        Fire Department is here.  That
                        was fast.

          Just then, the Young Guard is blindsided from behind with
            a flashlight, knocking him out.  Johnny turns to see the
          Older Guard holding the flashlight.  He picks the phone
          up from where the Young Guard dropped it.

                                        OLDER GUARD
                        Sorry, false alarm.  Everything
                        here is under control, thanks. 
                        No, that won't be necessary.  Uh-
                        huh, you too.

          He hangs up the phone and turns his attention to the alarm
          control panel in front of him.  He punches three "disarm"
          buttons, each one buzzing for attention, waiting for the
          disarm code to be punched into a numeric keypad.  Vision
          Johnny watches the Old Guard punch in the code.

          Watches as the Guard reaches into his black bag, pulling
          out his mask and jacket, which he puts on.

          Just then, ANOTHER MASKED MAN, THIEF #1 (Brother Gregarin),

                        We good here?

                        Let's do it.

          Johnny notes the time on the clock: 10:05.  The VISION
          ENDS.


  2323JOHNNY - PRESENT REALITY - INT. HIGH VOLTAGE ROOM

          He comes out of the vision just as the Old Guard returns
          from the next room where the circuit breakers are --
          looking for his bag.  He's not happy to see Johnny.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What were you doing back there?

                                        OLDER GUARD
                        I'm making my rounds.  What
                          business is it of yours?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Why is the power going to fail?

          The Guard tries, but can't hide his reaction.

                                        OLDER GUARD
                        What are you talking about?

                                        JOHNNY
                        You did something to sabotage the
                        electrical system.

                                        OLDER GUARD
                        I don't have time for this.

                                        JOHNNY
                        This is some kinda robbery.

                                        OLDER GUARD
                        Get out of my way.

          He tries to push past Johnny and make a play for his gun,
          but Johnny's stronger, shoving him back deeper into the
          room, blocking his exit.

                        Let me outta...


          BOOM! AN EXPLOSION

          Rocks the room, the shock wave nearly knocking them both
          to the ground as the room is plunged into darkness.

          The force of the blast knocks loose an airduct from the
          ceiling, which falls and hits the Old Guard on the head,
          knocking him out.


  2424INT. MAIN EXHIBITION HALL

          Walt reacts to the echo of the distant "boom".  As the
          lights flicker and go out, Walt turns to look for J.J.
          catching just a glimpse of him across the hall.

                        Dad!  What's going on!?

          Everyone GASPS collectively as the hall goes dark.


          PURDY - NEAR THE GLASS CUBE

          reacts to the lights flickering.  Instinctively looks
          toward the relic as the hall goes dark.

                        they'll have the power back any
                        moment.  Move calmly toward the
                        exits.

          Older Guard, finding him unconscious on the floor.  Johnny
          reaches down and touches him, triggering:


  2626VISION - INT. SECURITY CONTROL ROOM

          Johnny is back in the control room for a REPEAT of the
          vision of the Young Guard after the explosion, except
          this time, the Older Guard is not there to knock him out.

          VISION JOHNNY notes the time: 10:05

                                        YOUNGER GUARD
                          Hello... 9-1-1?  Faith Heritage
                          Security.  We have multiple fire
                        alarms in the main auditorium.
                                (re:the monitors)
                        Fire Department is here.  That
                        was fast.
                                (then looking around)
                        Where the hell is Magruder?

          Just then, the door opens and Brother Gregarin steps into
          the room, surprised to find the Young Guard there.

                                        YOUNGER GUARD
                        What the...?!

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN
                          Magruder?

                                        YOUNGER GUARD
                        No.  What's going on?

          The Younger Guard suddenly realizes what's going on.  He
          reaches for his gun, but the Masked Man is faster, firing
          first, wounding the Young Guard.

          Falling to the floor, the Young Guard gets off a shot,
          hitting Brother Gregarin, who slumps in the doorway.  A
          Second Masked Man, THIEF #2 (IVAN), steps into the doorway,
            returning fire, killing the Guard.  He pulls his wounded
            companion away.

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN
                        Get me out of here.

          They exit, but Vision Johnny HEARS what happens next: MEN
          YELLING. 

                                        GUARDS (O.S.)
                        Hold it right there.  Freeze!

          The guards must have heard the gunshots and returned to
          find the wounded Thieves.  Suddenly A SCREAM.  THEN A
          HORRIFIC VOLLEY OF GUNFIRE as the VISION ENDS.


  2727JOHNNY - BACK TO REALITY

          Comes out of the vision standing over the unconscious
          Magruder and his black bag.  Johnny realizes if the Old
          Guard isn't there, people will get killed.  He looks at
          the clock -- 10:01.  He looks at the bag.  Thinking.  He*
          looks at the clock again -- 10:02.*

          He grabs the black bag and runs out of the room.

          the smoke and darkness back to the Security Control room.

                        Dad!

          Frightened by the crowd, he backs up against a door,*
          slipping through it, looking to escape. *


  28A28A*INT. SERVICE CORRIDOR

          He finds himself in the service corridor between the
          exhibits and the back of the auditorium, the door clicking
          shut behind him.  Unable to go back the way he came, lost*
          and frightened, he runs toward a flashing emergency light
          in the distance.


  2929INT. CORRIDOR - OUTSIDE THE CONTROL ROOM DOOR

          Johnny stops to think.  Checks the black bag.  Pulls out
          the flashlight he saw the Older Guard use to knock out
          the Younger Guard.  Rejects that idea, going to plan B as
          he heads through the door into the control room.


  3030INT. SECURITY CONTROL ROOM (10:02 ON THE CLOCK)

          As before, the Young Guard is overwhelmed as Johnny bursts
          in.

                        there are toxic fumes.  Everybody
                        needs to evacuate the building.

                        Where's Magruder?

          Johnny is pulling the scared kid up out of his chair.

                        He's in the main hall.  They want

                          control.

                        let's go!

          Johnny ushers the nervous Young Guard out the door into
          the dark hall, but stays behind, ducking back inside,
          shutting the door behind him.

          He looks at the clock -- 10:04.  Then he remembers
          something, reaching into the black bag, pulling out the
          mask.  He stretches the mask over his face, then leans
          back against the wall, catching his breath.

                        I think so.  Can't be sure 'til
                        the Fire Department does a sweep
                        of the building.  Magruder's still
                        in there somewhere.

          As the Younger Guard runs off, Purdy stands with his back
          to the entrance, checking to see if anyone's looking,
          before quietly slipping back inside the building.

          before killing the siren and stopping.  FOUR FIREMEN,
          helmets and breathing gear already on, hop off the truck
          and begin pushing the crowd back, setting up cones.

                                        FIREMAN #4 (MARIO THE DRIVER)
                        I need you people to back up and
                        give us room to work.  Everything
                        is under control.  Just a small
                        electrical fire.  Nothing to worry
                        about.  Back up please.

          Fireman #2 (Ivan), a huge guy built like a bouncer, throws
          the jaws of life over his shoulder, picks up a small
          generator, and leads the way into the smoking building. 
          Fireman #1 (Brother Gregarin) and #3 (THE AMAZING SVETLANA)
          unload several large rolling cases marked "haz mat" and
          begin shoving them inside the building.

          Johnny, his mask pulled up off his face, lays out the
          contents of the black bag on the counter in front of him. 
          He touches each object, triggering a WHOOSH!  And a quick
          flash of a vision.

            - BLUEPRINTS - WHOOSH! 

          Sees flashes of various wiring schematics for the alarms,
          sections highlighted, almost like he were downloading
          information -- but it's fragmented and incomplete.

          - WIRE CUTTERS - WHOOSH! 

          Snipping a series of wires.  Was that a red wire or green?

            - FLASHLIGHT - WHOOSH! 

          He gets a brief flash of Purdy fighting him off from his
          initial vision.

            - SCREWDRIVER - GOGGLES - SECURITY CARD READER

          We just HEAR - WHOOSH! - WHOOSH! - WHOOSH!  Johnny's
          expression tells us what he's seeing raises as many
            questions as answers.  A few scattered pieces of a big
          puzzle.

          One of the MONITORS catches his eye.          DEAD ZONE: "INSIDE MAN" - ACT TWO - 4/10/05 - PINK    21.

          Fireman #1 (Brother Gregarin) continues along the service
            corridor.

                                        JOHNNY (O.S.)
                          Firemen.  But no thieves.  Where
                        the hell are they?

          Johnny toggles through the various camera angles like he
          saw the Young Guard do earlier.  No sign of any thieves
          or masked men.


  3434JOHNNY

          Turns his attention to the security console.  He looks
          for the three "arm/disarm" buttons for the alarms, the
          ones the Old Guard used in the vision.  He finds them and
          pushes them, mimicking what he saw the guard do.

          Working hard to hear himself think over the buzz of the
          alarms, he struggles to remember the disarm code.  He
          types in the code, pausing to second guess himself.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Four - five - eight?  Four-five-
                        eight.  No.  Four - five - nine.

          He punches it in.

                                        JOHNNY
                          ...seven - seven - seven.

          The control panel lights up green, the alert buzzer
            silenced.


  3535THEN HE SEES - UP ON THE MONITORS

          Fireman #1 (Brother Gregarin) right outside the door to
          the security control room, pulling off his oxygen mask as
          he reaches for the door.


  3636THE DOOR

          Opens REVEALING Fireman #1 (Brother Gregarin) -- now Thief
          #1 -- a mask pulled down over his face -- the Masked Man
          from the vision.  Johnny hurriedly pulls down his mask as
          the door opens.

    36CONTINUED:36

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN
                        We good here?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Whaddya think?

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN
                        Let's do it.

          Brother Gregarin drags in the "haz mat" case and cracks
          it open, revealing a variety of electronic gear.  He picks
          up a small box about the size of a wireless mic
            transmitter, with an antenna and some cables.  He reaches
          around behind the surveillance monitors, clipping his
          black box to the monitor inputs and extending the antenna.

          Then he notices something wrong.

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN
                        Where's the other guard?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I sent him to help evacuate the
                          building.

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN
                        That wasn't the plan.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The plan changed.

          Brother Gregarin considers the situation, then lets it
          go.  He's got other things on his plate.  He pulls a small
          Watchman TV out of the case and switches it on.


  3737ON THE WATCHMAN MONITOR

          The black box is broadcasting the signal from the
            surveillance cameras to the Watchman.  Brother Gregarin
          toggles through the various camera angles by changing
          channels on the Watchman.  Nice.

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN
                        We're on-line.  Let's go.

          As they head out the door, Johnny takes an opportunity to
          brush against Brother Gregarin triggering:


  3838VISION - INT. CANDLE-LIT MONASTERY CHAPEL (1940S) - NIGHT

          THREE HOODED MONKS kneel in front of a small altar,

                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "INSIDE MAN" - ACT TWO - 4/10/05 - PINK    23.


    38CONTINUED:38

          praying.  On the altar, an ornate tabernacle is open,
          empty, its contents missing.

          Vision Johnny studies the monks, wondering if these are
          early Christians.  Then a sharp voice, SPEAKING GERMAN,
          turns him around to see...


          NAZI SOLDIERS

          Their guns aimed at the monks.  Vision Johnny finds himself
          directly between the monks and the soldiers.

                                        GERMAN OFFICER
                                (in German)
                        I will give you one last chance. 
                        Where is it?

          The monks continue to pray.

                                        GERMAN OFFICER
                                (calmly)
                        Shoot them.

          The soldiers obey with a quick burst of machine gun fire,
          tracers whizzing right through a horrified Johnny.  He
          turns to find the Monks dead on the floor.  The soldiers
          move in, clearing the bodies away from the altar where
          they discover...


          A YOUNG BOY

          Hiding under the altar, clutching something.  He's bleeding
          from a gash above his eye.  The soldiers drag him out
          from under the altar and roughly pry the object he's
          protecting away from the little boy -- it's the relic of
          John the Baptist.  VISION ENDS.


  3939RESUME - JOHNNY

          Emerges from the vision wondering how what he just saw
          relates to the thief in front of him.  Brother Gregarin
          grabs his equipment and heads out the door, Johnny
          reluctantly following.


  4040INT. EXHIBITION HALL - AT THE GLASS CUBE - SERIES OF
          SHOTS

          Johnny and Brother Gregarin arrive at the glass cube,
          finding Ivan and Svetlana busy assembling equipment.

                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "INSIDE MAN" - ACT TWO - 4/10/05 - PINK    24.

          With clockwork precision, they attach a long hose to a
          gas cylinder marked "liquid nitrogen".  The other end of
          the hose is fitted with a custom nozzle that fits over a
          small air vent at the base of the outer cube.

          That done, they turn on the gas and begin filling the
          cube with white-cold gas.

          Gregarin meanwhile tapes a digital thermometer to the
          outside of the glass, checking the readout.

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN
                          ...fifty-five degrees and dropping.

          Dropping like a stone, fifty-five, forty-five, thirty-
          five...


  40B40BIVAN AND SVETLANA

          Next begin taping a thick electrical wire to the surface
          of the glass, criss-crossing each side in an "X" pattern. 
          Johnny watches from off to the side, wondering what's
          going on.


  4141AT THE OPPOSITE END OF THE EXHIBITION HALL

          A wide eyed J.J. hides behind one of the displays, watching
          as the masked robbers go about their business.  His hands
          shaking, he steadies his camera against the display and
          snaps a picture.


  4242JOHNNY - AT THE GLASS CUBE

          Senses something.  Looks down the long hallway in the
            direction where J.J. is hiding in the dark.  Seeing a
          glint off the camera lens, and a slight movement as J.J.
          ducks, Johnny starts moving to investigate when he hears...

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN
                        We have company.

          Johnny turns back to see Brother Gregarin and Svetlana
          looking at the handheld monitor.          DEAD ZONE: "INSIDE MAN" - ACT TWO - 4/10/05 - PINK    25.


  4343ON THE MONITOR - SURVEILLANCE POV

          Purdy, finding his way in the dark, opens the door to his
          office and slinks inside.

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN
                        What's he doing?

          Johnny joins them, looking over their shoulder.

                                        IVAN
                        What do you want to do?

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN
                        Bring him to me.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'll do it.

          Brother Gregarin thinks it over.  Nods his approval to
          Johnny -- then turns to Svetlana.

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN
                        Go with him.  I don't want anymore
                        surprises.

          Clearly hoping he was going alone, Johnny heads off for
          Purdy's office.  (Which for purposes of this show, I'm
          assuming is in the same building as the auditorium.)


          J.J.

          Still hiding, sees that they are headed straight for him,
          and scrambles off in search of help.


  4545EXT. EXHIBITION HALL - DAY

          Walt, having circled the entire building looking for J.J. 
          finds himself back at the entrance near the fire truck.

                                        WALT
                                (yelling)
                        J.J.?  J.J.?

          He turns toward the entrance, and seeing the lone Fireman
          standing watch at the door, starts toward him to report
          J.J. missing.  As he passes the fire truck, something
          catches his eye.

          P.O.V. - THE FIRE TRUCK DOOR

          The decal for the Penobscot Fire Department is just a
          little crooked.  A closer inspection reveals the decal
          has been plastered over a haphazard paint job covering
          the insignia of another fire department.

          He looks again at the Fireman guarding the door, this
          time noticing something odd.  The VIEW ZOOMS IN on the
            Fireman's boots - but they aren't boots - he's wearing a
          pair of sneakers under his fireman pants.


          WALT

          Slips his cell phone out, keeping an eye on the Fireman. 
          When he dials, he gets the same jamming tone Johnny got
          when he used the phone earlier.

          Snapping the phone shut, we see a decision cross his face
          and he turns to head off around the building with purpose.


  4646INT. PURDY'S OFFICE

          With the power out, Purdy moves in silhouette against the
          bright windows, busy putting something in a briefcase on
          his desk.  A loud KNOCK on the door startles him.

                                        PURDY
                        Who's there?

                                        JOHNNY
                                (changing his voice)
                        Fire Department.

                                        PURDY
                        Just a moment.

          Purdy sets the briefcase on the floor and moves to answer
          the door.


          AT THE DOOR

          Purdy opens the door and barely has time to react to the
          masks before he's bashed in the face with a gun by Svetlana --
          knocking Purdy back into his office.

                        ON THE FLOOR!  NOW!

          Johnny hangs back, agonized, not sure what to do as
          Svetlana puts a knee in Purdy's back and a gun to his

          head.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He said no more surprises.

          Svetlana considers things, then...

                                                                                  CUT TO:


  4747INT. EXHIBITION HALL - AT THE GLASS CUBE

          Johnny shoves Purdy down on one of the empty cases. 
          They've duct taped his mouth.  Brother Gregarin rips off
          the tape over his mouth.

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN
                        What is this?

                                        SVETLANA
                        We found him in one of the offices. 
                        He nearly wet himself when he saw
                        us.

          The others laugh, except Gregarin, who isn't into the
          crude humor.  Purdy notices his serious demeanor.

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN
                        Who are you?  Why were you still
                        inside?

                                        PURDY
                        My name is Gene Purdy.  I'm the
                        man responsible for the exhibit.

          Gregarin seems slightly amused by the comment as he steps
            deliberately towards Purdy.

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN
                        So you're the money changer of*
                        this temple... the whoremaster...*

          The others suddenly take notice.  Purdy is suddenly on
          his heels.

                                        PURDY
                        I beg your pardon.

          Gregarin steps up close to Purdy, who has now stood up.

                        Instead of selling the flesh and*
                        blood of the innocent, you sell
                        the body and soul of the Divine.  

          The others watch silent, never having seen this particular
          passion from their mysterious leader.

                                        PURDY
                        I am a man of God.  These articles
                        belong to the faithful.*

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN
                                (flares)
                        These articles have been stolen
                        from the faithful by the greedy*
                        and unworthy!  They are covered
                        in the blood of those who came
                        before!

          Gregarin holds his rage, then realizes he's shown too
          much of himself in the moment.  Purdy looks into his eyes
          and sees a reflection of something else... somebody other
          than this cold-blooded thief.

                                        IVAN

                        kill him?

          Svetlana exchanges a look with Johnny...

                        He's worth more as a hostage.  In
                        case something goes wrong.

                        It's almost ready.*

          The outer cube is now nearly filled with sub-zero vapor,
          looking like a giant ice-cube.

          Ivan finishes taping the last of the electric wire to the
          exterior of the cube, while Gregarin takes the other end
          of the wire and alligator clips the leads to ceramic posts
          on a terminal attached to the generator for the jaws of
          life.

          The whole time he's doing this, Ivan is pulling and
          struggling with his balaclava.

                        What's wrong?

                                        IVAN
                        Mask is too hot.  I'm sweatin'
                        like a pig and I can't see.  Hell
                        with it!

          Frustrated, he starts to peel off his mask.

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN
                        What are you doing?

                                        IVAN
                        What's it look like?

                        You can't...

          He's already got the mask off, revealing his face.  Purdy
          sees it too, which is probably not going to be good for
          him in the long run.

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN
                        You fool.  Now we all know who
                        you are.

                                        SVETLANA
                        Not to mention the 'pimp'.

          Eyes on eyes around the room.  Ivan sees the problem.

                                        IVAN
                        You seem to have me at a
                          disadvantage.
                                (then pulling his gun)
                        So, everybody take them off.

          Everyone hesitates.

                        Look, we're wasting time here, so
                        make up your minds...

          He points the gun at each of the others to drive home his
          request.  Reluctantly, they all start to comply.  Johnny,
            desperate to keep Purdy from seeing him and possibly giving
          him away.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (quick thinking)

                        Put a bag on his head first!

          For a second we wonder if Purdy recognizes Johnny's
          VOICE...

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN
                        He's right.  Why take any
                          unnecessary chances.

          Johnny, now even more desperate to keep his identity a
          secret, as he grabs Ivan's discarded mask off the floor
          and yanks it down backwards over Purdy's head.  Purdy
          reacts with a muffled 'Yeck!' 

                                        IVAN
                        Okay, now everybody take 'em off!

          First, Svetlana pulls off the mask, revealing her identity
          as a stunningly tattooed WOMAN.  Sexy and scary. 

          Next, Brother Gregarin pulls his mask up, revealing himself
          to be an older, distinguished looking man, a trim 60. 
          Johnny notes the large scar above his eye.

          Finally, not sure what will happen when they see him,
          Johnny carefully peels off his mask.

          He waits tensely for them to realize he's not who they
          think he is -- but when they don't, he relaxes -- ever so
            slightly.  Svetlana shoots him a playful wink which catches
          him by surprise.

          Svetlana reacts to the glass cube, which is groaning and
          popping from the cold.  She looks at the thermometer.

          Covered in frost, the readout cracked, bottomed out at
          175 degrees below zero.

          The tension broken, everyone snaps back to the task at
          hand.  Gregarin checks the thermometer for himself.

                        That's it.  Everyone back.

          Brother Gregarin puts on a pair of goggles, everyone else
            following suit - Johnny has to scramble a bit to find
          his. 

          Ivan, meanwhile, mans the switch on the terminal box
          attached to the glow wire wrapped around the cube.

                        Ready?

          Brother Gregarin nods yes, everyone bracing themselves as
          Ivan flips the switch, sending the juice to the glow wire.

          Slips on his goggles, watching as the current heats the

  47D47DTHE OUTER CUBE - MONEY SHOT

          As the electricity hums through the glow wire, it warms
          up and glows bright orange, taking about four seconds to
          become white hot.  The glass screams from the temperature
          change, then suddenly shatters, the pressure blasting
            shattered glass everywhere, just like Johnny saw in his
          initial vision.  Way cool.  The impenetrable glass cube
          now a pile of broken glass.

          Or what remains of it.  Johnny sifts through the sparkling
          rubble.  He looks up at...


          THE RELIC

          Standing atop its next layer of defense, a black steel
          obelisk about four feet high, on top of which is a hardened
          steel and glass case housing the actual relic box.  The
          beams of several flashlights propped up on the cases
          converge on the relic, giving it an ethereal glow.


          BROTHER GREGARIN

          Starts the small generator.  The VIEW FOLLOWS the power
          cord to a portable hydraulic pump, then continues on,
            following the hydraulic hoses as they snake their way
          to...

          Who hoists the jaws of life, testing the pneumatic jaw as
          he carries it toward the relic case.

          With the help of Svetlana, they place the point of the
          jaw inside a seam along one corner of the obelisk beneath
          the case.  Slowly but surely they widen the seam, bending
          open one side of the case, revealing a narrow channel for
          electrical wiring running up the interior of the obelisk,
          leading to the bottom of the glass and steel case.

          Takes a beat to check on the blindfolded Purdy, but can't
          say anything to give himself away as the others work

            Carefully pulls the wires out of the channel, exposing

          slathering her arm with petroleum jelly.  He checks his
          watch.

                        We're behind schedule.

          Johnny watches her grease up her arm, wondering what comes
          next.  She slips finger condoms on the tips of her fingers
          and looks up, catching Johnny in mid-gawk.

          He runs along in the dark, not sure which way to go. 
          Seeing a door with a sliver of light under it, he runs
          for it.  Finding it wedged open a crack by a piece of
          debris, he opens the door.  A NOISE behind him spooks
          J.J., and he ducks inside the room -- freezing in terror
          at what he sees.

          Flashing emergency lights illuminate the smoke-filled
          room, revealing the unconscious figure of the Older Guard,
          laying on the ground where Johnny left him.  (With the
          low light and shock of it all, he can't tell that it's a
          guard, just a body.)

          Frozen as the door clicks shut, locking behind him. 
          Hearing the lock, he turns and runs to the door, twisting

          can't get out.  He looks back over his shoulder at the

          Svetlana finishes greasing up her arm, then picks up a
          tiny screwdriver, holding it deftly between her thumb and
          forefinger (the ones with the rubber tips).  Finally, she
          clips a small "lipstick" cam to her index finger before
          nodding to the others that she's ready. 

          Brother Gregarin and Ivan slide one of the cases over,
          pushing it right up against the opening in the obelisk.

          Johnny watches with fascination, dying to know what the
          hell is going on.  Hopefully so are you.

          Sits down on the case with her back to the obelisk,
          twisting around so she can slip her greased up arm into
          the narrow wiring conduit.

          Everyone watches as she contorts her arm into the tight,
          bendy, tube that leads up toward the steel and glass relic
          case.  She checks her progress as she goes on another
          small WATCHMAN TV receiving the signal from her finger-

          Ivan lifts a small power saw.

                        Let's hope so.*


          WIDER

          The thieves draw closer as Svetlana sweats her arm deeper
          into the case, using deep breathing to relax as she commits
          herself up to the shoulder in a very uncomfortable looking
            position.  She must have practiced this a lot.  Johnny
          grimaces just watching her.

                                        IVAN
                                (under his breath)
                        That's why she gets paid the big
                        bucks.

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN
                        Quiet.  She must concentrate. 
                        She should have been in three
                        minutes ago.


          HER ARM (A VISUAL EFFECT)

          As she jams the last inch of her arm in the hole, we get
          a look at the entire journey the arm takes, her impossibly
          contorted, double-jointed wrist rising like a cobra up
          into the case in front of the relic.


          AS THEY ALL WATCH

          Her hand strains toward the jewelry box case containing
          the actual relic.  Her practiced fingers make a series of
            choreographed moves until her fingertips are just
          millimeters away from the sacred shard of bone.


          EXTREME ON HER FINGER TIPS - RUBBER TIPS

          As they scissor together to grasp the tiny relic.

                                  (perspiring and focused)
                        I have it.

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN
                        Be very careful, if you drop it
                        we may not get another chance.

                                        SVETLANA
                        Relax, old man, I never drop the*
                        package... unless some fool*
                          distracts me.*

          Her hand moves like a robot arm moving radioactive
            isotopes.

          Finally she lifts the relic off its perch, TRIGGERING:


          AN EAR SHATTERING ALARM - WIDER VIEW

          A high pitched "antipersonnel" alarm SHRIEKS persistently,
          forcing everyone to stop what they were doing and cover
          their ears.

                                        IVAN
                        What the hell is that?!


          SVETLANA

          Reacts to the shrieking alarm, but is stuck with her arm
          fully involved.  Startled, the relic slips slightly in
          her fingertips and as she moves to correct, she DISLOCATES
          HER SHOULDER!  She cries out in pain, but then guts it
          out, pinned to the source of the high decibel alarm.


          HER HAND

          Contorts with agony as she drops the relic, which falls
          to the bottom of the case where she can't possibly reach
          it.


          EVERYONE

          Reacts, seeing this bad turn of events.

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN
                        NO!

          PURDY

          Still blindfolded, but hearing the alarm, knows something
          went wrong for the thieves.

                                        PURDY
                                (can't help himself)
                        That doesn't sound good...*

          Ivan rushes over with the jaws of life, threatening Purdy,
          who can't see him.  Brother Gregarin stops him.

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN
                        Get away from him!

          Then he grabs Purdy and yells over the alarm...

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN
                        Do you know how to shut this off?!

                                        PURDY
                        Not if I can't see!

          Brother Gregarin pulls down his own mask, then nods for
          the others to do the same.  Johnny pulls down his mask,
          but Svetlana can't, and Ivan won't.

                                        IVAN
                        He looks at me again and he's
                        dead!

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN
                        You must keep your eyes down!

                                        PURDY
                          Understood!

          Brother Gregarin pulls the mask off Purdy's head.  He
          reacts to the mayhem around him...

          PURDY'S SLIGHT POV

          From the corner of his vision, Purdy can see the damage
          to the inner case, where the relic is missing from its
          spot.

                                        PURDY
                        Dear God... they took it.

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN
                        Stop talking to God and tell me
                        what to do!

                        There's a second alarm panel! 
                        Across the room!

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN
                        Go!  Eyes down!
                                (to Johnny)
                        You help!

          Johnny and Brother Gregarin escort Purdy towards a hidden
          wall panel across the room.


            MEANWHILE - IVAN

          Endures the decibels to help Svetlana, who is still stuck. 
          He tries to adjust her body position, but she CRIES OUT...

                                        SVETLANA
                        Stop!  Don't touch me again, you
                        idiot!


          ON A NEARBY WALL

          Purdy divines his way along the wall.

                                        PURDY
                        There's a small camera above the
                        hidden panel!

          Johnny spots the camera at the top of the wall and lines
          it up and locates the hidden panel.  He pushes and it
          pops unlatched.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I got it!

          He opens to reveal a small "qwerty" keypad and an l.e.d.
          readout.

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN
                        What is the password?

          Purdy hesitates...

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN
                        Answer me!

                                        PURDY

          Johnny and Gregarin exchange a look, then...

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN
                        I want that password!

                                        PURDY
                        No.

          Brother Gregarin considers the moment, then he chambers a
          round into his pistol.

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN
                        I'm going to give you five seconds
                        to decide.

          He presses the barrel against Purdy's neck.  Purdy sweats
          and holds his ground.  1... 2... 3... 4...

          Gregarin gently begins to squeeze the trigger, and...

                                        JOHNNY
                        WAIT!

          Everything freezes, as Gregarin pauses in mid-fire.  Johnny
          leans in close to Gregarin, so Purdy can't hear him so
          well.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He hasn't seen us, right?

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN
                        So?

                        Ivan is an animal and he's stupid. 
                          Whatever happens to him he
                          deserves.  I, on the other hand,
                        don't want a pointless murder on
                        my back for the rest of my life.

          Gregarin considers the moment, then...

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN
                        I need that password.*

                        Give me a minute.

          Gregarin pulls Purdy out of the way, slamming him back*
          against a nearby wall.*

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN*
                        Eyes forward!*

          Johnny gently begins 'touching' the control pad.  Gregarin
          seems both curious and confused by what's happening. 
          Then... Johnny suddenly looks up.

                        There's still time to reconsider

          Gregarin becomes steely, pressing in on Purdy.

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN
                        Don't speak to me about God or
                        faith.  You have no idea what it
                        means to truly believe.

          Purdy suddenly realizes he's dealing with no ordinary

                        lose that arm if we don't get it
                        out.

          Svetlana reaches out and grabs a pistol with her free
          arm.  She swings it towards them the best she can, she's
          a pretty feisty little girl.

                        your head off!

          It's clear she'd rather not lose the arm.  Gregarin steps
          towards her, as she swings the barrel back at him.  He
          throws his hands up...

                        With what?

          Johnny gestures towards the jaws.

                                        JOHNNY
                        With that.

                        Could it work?

          Ivan considers this, then...

                                        IVAN
                        It might.

                          Twenty-thirty minutes.

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN
                        We don't have that much time. 
                          Somebody must have heard the alarm.

          Ivan draws his gun and crosses the room towards Purdy.

                                        IVAN
                        Maybe we should just cut our losses
                        and get the hell out of here!

          He raises his gun toward Purdy.

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN
                        Put the gun down!

                        Screw you!

          Ivan ignores him until he hears the click of Brother
          Gregarin's gun behind him.

                        Put it down.

          Ivan stops and then breaks into a wide grin at Brother
            Gregarin.

                                        IVAN
                          Whatever you say, chief.

          He pans his gun off Purdy, then quickly raises it on
          Brother Gregarin in a classic two-man standoff.


          JOHNNY

          Watches.  Seeing the standoff, he takes advantage of the
          beat to reach out and touch the glass case, triggering:


  5656VISION - MATCH-MOVE-MORPH - SAME PLACE - HOURS LATER

          The dark exhibition room is suddenly transformed into a
          brightly lit CRIME SCENE.  Vision Johnny watches as Walt
          and ROSCOE survey the carnage, several BODIES scattered
          about under plastic sheets, a photographer in the
          background dutifully photographing the one uncovered body --
            Johnny's.  Shot in the chest.

                        All this bloodshed over a piece
                        of bone.

                                        ROSCOE
                        They were using the jaws to tip
                        this thing so it would roll out
                        the hole like a penny candy. 
                        Funny thing is, a couple more
                        minutes and they would have had
                        the darn thing.

                                        WALT
                        I still can't believe Johnny was
                        mixed up in this.

          VISION JOHNNY looks at the relic case and obelisk, seeing
          it's different, it's tipped like the Tower of Pisa, the
          jaws of life wedged under the bottom, prying the base up. 
          Just a few more inches of tilt, and the relic would have
          rolled out the hole in the bottom.  VISION ENDS.

          He quickly steps in between the two gun barrels.

          Everyone looks at Gregarin...

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN
                        We've got ten minutes.

          Greed trumps pride and the guns come down, Purdy breathes
          a sigh of relief.  Brother Gregarin and Ivan join Johnny.

                                        JOHNNY

          They pull her out in one hard yank, the suction making a*
          hideous sucking noise -- combined with some nice bone*
          cracks.  They set her aside to recover, rubbing her numb*

          He sweeps Johnny aside with the jaws, then plants the*
          business end in the seam where the obelisk is bolted to
          the floor.  It doesn't take long before the whole unit
          starts to tip.


          BROTHER GREGARIN

          Pulls Johnny aside.

  5858INT. HIGH VOLTAGE ROOM

          J.J. sits with his back against the door, having given up
          on getting the door open.  He stares at the man on the
          floor in front of him, eyes wide, trying not to cry.

          A voice squawks from somewhere, startling J.J.  Taking a
          beat, he looks closer and realizes the voice is from a
          walkie talkie, still in the Old Guard's belt.


  5959INT. SERVICE CORRIDOR - MOVING

          Johnny, his mask still on, walks Purdy ahead of him. 
          Johnny keeps looking behind him, checking to see if he's
          out of view of his newfound partners yet.

                                        PURDY
                        Before you kill me, you might

          Purdy complies, eyes closed, his back to Johnny, bracing
          for the end, expecting to get shot.  Johnny looks around,
          then starts to take his mask off, when suddenly...


          OUT OF THE SHADOWS - WALT

          He rushes forward and tackles the Masked Man holding Purdy
          hostage.  He slams Johnny hard against the wall, the two
          men going down hard to the floor.  Johnny reflexively
          defends himself, punching his attacker several times as
          he scrambles back to his feet.

            Straightening up, Johnny gets his first good look at his*
            attacker.  Realizing it's Walt, he's frozen for a moment
          as his brain catches up to the action.*

          Walt uses the moment's hesitation to land a hard cross to
          Johnny's chin, knocking him backward and down, before
          Johnny has a chance to say anything.

          Johnny hits the floor, then spins around to see Walt
          looming toward him, but before Walt can do any more damage,
          Brother Gregarin appears behind him, cracking Walt over
          the head with his gun, knocking him out.

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN
                        That was close.

          Johnny considers Walt's face a few feet from him.

                        Yeah, close.

          Johnny considers how things keep getting more complicated.

                        Don't make me come back.

          He exits, Johnny hesitates as Gregarin reaches back in

          A hooded Monk cleans the empty tabernacle, closing and
          locking it.  As he turns away from the altar, he lowers
          his hood, revealing Brother Gregarin.  As he peels off
          his robe, a GROUP OF WORSHIPERS surround the Monk/Thief,
          patting him on the back and wishing him well.  One man, a
          TAILOR, helps the Monk into a new suit jacket.  A PEASANT
          WOMAN gives him a basket of food.  SOMEBODY else hands

          A teenager donates his cell phone to the cause.  The Monk
          turns back to them and nods goodbye, before exiting,

          him somehow -- as the VISION ENDS.

          Johnny and Brother Gregarin wedge their shoulders against
          the tilting obelisk and push with all their might, trying
          to help reach a tipping point.

          Just happens to fall into position to catch the relic as
          it rattles out of the exposed conduit.  When it falls
          into his hand EVERYTHING FREEZES AND WE HEAR A MONSTER
          WHOOSH!  -- the VIEW SWOOPING IN ON JOHNNY as if he's had

          first, Brother Gregarin just stands there regarding it,
          his eyes slowly filling with tears.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Take it.

          Gregarin gently takes it and kisses the relic, closing
          his eyes to say a silent prayer -- but he's rudely
            interrupted.

                                        IVAN
                        I hate to break up this emotional
                          reunion, but we'll take that now.

          The Monk opens his eyes to find a gun pointed at his head. 
          He looks to Johnny, who has problems of his own: Svetlana,
          a gun in her good hand, pointed at Johnny.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

          FADE IN:

  6464TIGHT ON A WALKIE TALKIE

            Squawking unintelligibly.  The VIEW WIDENS TO REVEAL:


          INT. HIGH VOLTAGE ROOM - EMERGENCY LIGHTS

          J.J. creeps across the room, mustering all the courage he
          can as he approaches the body on the floor, keeping his
          eyes glued on the walkie, trying to ignore everything
          else about his surroundings.  Each time the walkie hashes
          to life, J.J. pulls back.  Trying to stay as far away as
            possible, he finally gets within arms reach.  Closer...
            Closer... Just as he's about to grab the prize, the Old
          Guard GROANS and moves -- sending J.J. scrambling back to
          where he started.


          EYES WIDE AS SAUCERS

          He watches the guard, who's gone silent again.  He tries
          the door once more in desperation, still locked.  After a
          beat, J.J. ventures forward again, a determined look on
          his face as he creeps toward the walkie.


  6565INT. EXHIBITION HALL - AT THE RELIC CASE

          The standoff continues.  Johnny tries to ignore the gun
          in his face as he watches Brother Gregarin, wondering
          what he'll do.  Ivan keeps the pressure on, inching the
          gun closer and closer to Brother Gregarin's head.  Brother
          Gregarin just stares back at him like stone.

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN
                        You don't understand the eternal
                          darkness taking this object will
                        bring to you.

                                        IVAN
                        You didn't seem to be worried
                        when you put this little picnic
                          together.  Now, you either hand
                        it to me, or I'll take it out of
                        your cold, dead hand.

          Brother Gregarin realizes he has no choice but to live
          and fight another day.  Reluctantly he unclenches his
          fist, dropping the small relic in the palm of Ivan's hand.

    65CONTINUED:65

                                        IVAN
                        On second thought, I just as soon
                        not spend the rest of my life
                        looking over my shoulder.

          Ivan pulls back the hammer on his gun.  Svetlana does the
          same, aiming at Johnny's head.

          JUST THEN, a WALKIE-TALKIE sitting amongst the gear barks
          to life...

                                        J.J.
                                (garbled on walkie)
                        Can anybody hear me?  I need help. 
                          Somebody is robbing Faith Heritage. 
                        Anybody hear me?  There are men
                        with guns...

            Everybody is startled by the sound of the walkie, all of
          them turning to look.  Johnny uses the distraction to
          push Svetlana into Ivan, then dive for cover.  He manages
          to pull Brother Gregarin out of the way as well, just as
          Ivan fires a wild shot.


          THE WALKIE

          Suddenly comes to life, several garbled VOICES talking at
          once as some of the other guards outside respond to J.J.


          JOHNNY

          takes cover, pulling Brother Gregarin to safety with him,
          hiding in the darkness.


          IVAN AND SVETLANA

          She starts to pursue them, but he stops her.

                                        IVAN
                        Let them go!  We have to get out
                        of here!

          He pockets the relic as they start to back out of the
          room, guns at the ready.

          They turn and run toward the entrance, grabbing their
          coats and helmets as they disappear into the darkness.

    65CONTINUED: (2)65

          BROTHER GREGARIN

          Steps out from behind cover to pursue them, but Johnny
          physically restrains him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Don't.  It doesn't matter if they
                        get away.

          Gregarin now takes a harder look at Johnny, realizing he
          is truly different... special.

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN
                        It matters.

          He pulls away from Johnny and turns to go.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (then as a last chance)
                        The relic isn't real.

          Brother Gregarin stops dead in his tracks.  He turns back
          to Johnny a look of disbelief on his face.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's a fake.

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN
                        How could you know this?


  6666EXT. EXHIBITION HALL - DAY

          Ivan and Svetlana exit the hall, racing right past Mario --
          who is surprised by their sudden appearance.

                                        MARIO
                        What took you so long?

                                        IVAN
                        Never mind, just keep the crowd
                        back!

          Ivan and Svetlana jump into the cab of the idling fire
          truck, leaving Mario to work the crowd.

                                        MARIO
                        Everything is under control, thank
                        you for your cooperation...

          Hearing the siren fire up behind him, he turns to run
          after the moving fire truck, barely jumping on the back
          as they roar off, leaving behind confused onlookers.          DEAD ZONE: "INSIDE MAN" - ACT FOUR - 4/10/05 - PINK   55.


  6767INT. EXHIBITION HALL

          Picking up with Johnny and Brother Gregarin.

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN
                        A psychic?

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's how I knew you were going
                        to steal the relic, how I figured
                        out the password for the alarm.

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN
                        Why?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I saw a vision, I knew if you
                        weren't successful, innocent people
                        would die.  When your inside man -
                          Magruder - was hurt, I took his
                        place.

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN
                        You expect me to believe this?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I saw it.  Just like I saw the
                        Nazis put the scar over your eye.

          Brother Gregarin is completely taken aback.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The relic.  The German's stole it
                        from your monastery.

          Gregarin nods.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I saw you hide it under the altar.

          Brother Gregarin stares at Johnny, not sure what he's in
          the presence of. 

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN
                        What kind of man am I in the
                          presence of?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Just a man like you, no better or
                        worse than you.

          Gregarin hesitates, then tells his story.

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN
                        When the war broke out, my mother
                        left me in the care of the Monks. 
                        When the Nazis came, they took
                        the relic.  Many brothers were
                        killed that day.  There has been
                        so much pain and misery in my
                          country.  The people need something
                        to believe in again.

                                        JOHNNY
                        So you planned to steal the relic
                        and take it back to your church.

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN
                        The icon had been with the Monks
                        for centuries.  When we heard the
                        relic was for sale, we raised
                        money.  A wealthy American outbid
                        us.  I had no choice but to come. 
                        It was a matter of faith.

                                        JOHNNY
                        And now the relic is a fake.

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN
                          Impossible.  The object has
                          performed many miracles.  Somebody
                        must have switched it.

          Brother Gregarin rushes out of the building, only to be
          confronted by a group of armed deputies.

          Gregarin hesitates, then makes a dash for freedom.  He's
          gunned down in a hail of bullets.

          Johnny flashes out of the vision.

                        Come with me, there isn't much
                        time.  You need to do exactly
                        what I tell you.

          Gregarin nods, as they take off together.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

          Walt is scraping his wrist binding on his chair, trying

  70A70AINT. SECURITY CONTROL ROOM - DAY

          Masks on, Johnny and Brother Gregarin burst into the
          control room, startling Purdy and Walt.  Brother Gregarin
          flashes a knife, cutting the tape that binds Purdy to his
          chair.

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN
                        GET UP!  NOW!

          He yanks him to his feet and shoving him out the door,
          leaving Walt alone.

                                        PURDY
                        Where are you taking me?  Why are
                        you doing this?!

    70ACONTINUED:70A

          Walt listens to all this, wondering.  Waiting a beat to
          make sure they're gone, he starts back in on cutting his
          wrist ties, grunting in pain at the effort.


  7171INT. PURDY'S OFFICE - DAY

          Purdy is shoved into his office, Johnny and the Thief
          right behind him.  Brother Gregarin rips off Purdy's
          blindfold, leaving him squinting at two silhouettes against
          the bright window.

                                        PURDY
                        What do you want?

                        I don't know what you're talking
                        about.

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN

                                        PURDY
                        It's been stolen.  By you.

          Purdy inches slightly towards his desk, then makes his
          move and goes for his gun (like he did in the Teaser) 
          But the drawer is empty.

                        Looking for this?

          Johnny holds up the pistol.  Then he pulls off his mask. 
          Purdy nearly passes out.

                                        PURDY
                        Johnny?  What are you doing?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Same thing I've been doing all
                        day, trying to save your life.

                                        PURDY
                        I don't understand.

                                        JOHNNY
                        This is Brother Gregarin.  The
                        last of his order.

          Gregarin also removes his mask.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The Sacred Order of John the
                          Baptist.  You've heard of them?

                                        PURDY
                                (realizing now who's
                                  robbing him)
                        Yes...

                                        JOHNNY
                        He wants their relic back.

                                        PURDY
                        But the robbery...

                                        JOHNNY
                        We know about the fake. 

                                        PURDY
                        A fake?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Where is the real one, Gene?

          Purdy hesitates, then looks away, ashamed.  He begins to
          tear up.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What did you do?  Steal it from
                        your own exhibit?
                                (beat, flares)
                        Answer me?

                                        PURDY
                          Alright.  I have the relic.  But
                          I didn't steal it.  I bought it
                        from the Haliwell Foundation. 
                        The purchase was perfectly legal.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Why the fake?

                                        PURDY
                        I was warned that there were other
                        bidders who were still anxious to
                        possess it.  Others willing to do
                          anything to have it.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Where is it?

                                        JOHNNY
                        It never belonged to the people
                        who sold it to you.

                        You don't understand.  It wasn't
                        just for me...

          Purdy seems like a man that's just had the light turned
          on for him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You have 30 seconds!  Or a good
                        man is going to die!

          Purdy reaches under his desk for the briefcase he hid
          there earlier.  Reaching into the briefcase, he pulls out
          a small manilla envelope, pouring its contents out on the
          desk.  The real relic, in the flesh... kind of.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It was in your briefcase the whole
                        time?


          THE RELIC

          Almost seems to glow.


          WIDER

          As the three men stare at the object of so much attention.

                                        PURDY
                        It wasn't about money.  It's about
                        finding something to believe in. 
                        Since you came into my life Johnny,
                        I've lost my way.  Your existence
                        challenged my faith in a way I
                        can't reconcile.  I thought if
                        you could touch this, and see
                        what John the Baptist saw when he
                        looked on the face of Christ,
                        then I could believe again.  My
                        faith would be restored, and with
                        it, the faith of those I minister
                        to.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Faith is believing something is
                        true in the absence of proof.

                                        PURDY
                        Touch it.  Tell me what you see?

          Johnny looks to Brother Gregarin -- it's his relic.

                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "INSIDE MAN" - ACT FOUR - 4/12/05 - GREEN  60A.

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN
                        I don't need anyone to tell me
                        this is real.  I already believe
                        it.  Not in my head, but in my
                        heart. 

          Purdy picks up the relic.  He holds it a moment as both
          Purdy and Gregarin watch intently.

          Then he puts it back in the envelope and offers it to the
          brother.

                                        PURDY
                          Consider it an anonymous donation
                        to the Holy Order.

          Purdy gives Johnny a weary look.  Damn psychics.


  7272EXT. EXHIBITION HALL - EMERGENCY EXIT - DAY

          Johnny and Brother Gregarin poke their head out the side
          door, finding the coast clear.  In the distance they can
          hear MANY WAILING SIRENS --  hopefully chasing a stolen
          fire truck.  Johnny gives Brother Gregarin his coat.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Remember, stay on the North side
                        of the building.

                                        BROTHER GREGARIN
                        If you ever get to the Ukraine...

                                        JOHNNY
                        You need to go.

          They shake hands, as Gregarin takes off into the distance.

          As Walt makes his way toward the front lobby, he sees
          ROSCOE leading J.J. toward him.  J.J. breaks from Roscoe
          and runs to Walt.

                        It's okay, kiddo.  I'm here.

          Just then Johnny walks up like he just got there.

                        guys.  Why, did something happen?*

                                        J.J.
                        You won't believe it.  Robbers

                        They caught two of them in a stolen
                        fire truck, up near the Interstate. 
                        Some kid called it in.

          Walt notices Johnny rubbing his sore jaw.*

                        Yeah, lucky.  Let's go home, huh.*

          As they walk toward the door, Johnny makes eye contact
          with Purdy as he's led out by a paramedic.  The look says
          everything.

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:          DEAD ZONE: "INSIDE MAN" - ACT FOUR - 4/10/05 - PINK   63.

          Back in its rightful place.  The VIEW PULLS BACK to reveal
          a tired but reverent Ex-Thief #1, Brother Gregarin, back
          in his robe, leading a silent prayer in thanks for its
          safe return.  The VIEW CONTINUES BACK REVEALING the tiny

          found again.
