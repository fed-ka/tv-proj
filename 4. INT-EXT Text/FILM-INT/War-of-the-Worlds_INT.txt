Mary Ann, Rachel, Ray, and Tim walk into the kitchen as Robbie
heads straight upstairs to his room. Mary Ann sees a car engine
next to the kitchen table and looks at Ray in disgust.
RAY
(to Tim) It's a 302 V8. It's gonna be
out of here next week.
Mary Ann walks over to the refrigerator to check for the basic
food supplies. Ray gets frustrated that she is going through
HIS stuff.
RAY
(trying to get her to leave) You better
get going if you want to beat the traffic,
don't you think?
Mary Ann ignores his comment as she opens the refrigerator which
is almost empty.
MARY ANN
You're out of milk. (smells it) And
everything else.
Shot of Rachel, intensely listening from the stairs.
RAY
(mad) Would you close the door please?
Now that that's my refrigerator.
TIM
I'm gonna go wait outside. (to Rachel)
I love you sweetheart (hugs her) see
you in a few days.
RACHEL
Bye Tim.
MARY ANN
I'd better get this upstairs.
Ray tries to further rid of her but she continues.
RACHEL
(trying to get her bag form Mary Ann)
Mom, Mom!
RAY
Mary Ann, let me get this.
MARY ANN
I can get it.
RAY
(rushes to close his bedroom door, as
if hiding something) Excuse me.
Ray gets his door closed as Mary Ann goes into Rachel and Robbie's
room.
Mary Ann and Ray go into the room where Robbie is laying on his
bed listening to his MP3 player. Rachel sits down on her bed.
MARY ANN
A little old to still be sharing aren't
they?
RAY
I don't hear any complaints.
MARY ANN
No, I do.
Mary Ann walks over to Robbie on his bed and grabs his MP3 player.
She un-plugs the headphones and the music stops. Ray sits down
on a desk chair.
MARY ANN
Robbie's got a paper... (looks at Robbie
to make sure he's listening) ...on the
French occupation of Algeria due Monday
which he's yet to begin. It would be
nice if he were done by the time we
got back so we don't have to keep him
up all night on Sunday.
Mary Ann looks at Robbie who promptly says...
ROBBIE
I just got to type it up. (makes typing
motion)
MARY ANN
No, you just got to start writing it
first.
ROBBIE
(interrupts her) I love you mom!
Mary Ann kisses him.
MARY ANN
I love you. (begins walking over to
Rachel) Listen to your father.
Mary Ann hugs Rachel and promptly notices...
MARY ANN
Oh, no shoes on the bed.
INT Ray's House - Walking Down Stairs - Dawn
MARY ANN
We'll be at my parent's house in Boston
but don't call the house line, because
you know. Well the point is I've got
my cell phone. So if anything comes
up, or if you have any questions just
call.
RAY
Believe it or not, I can handle it.
MARY ANN
I'll leave the phone on.
RAY
Mary Ann? (beat) It's a good look for
you.
Mary Ann opens door and proceeds to walk out the door. She stops
to say...
MARY ANN
You think?
RAY
Yeah.
MARY ANN
Take care of our kids.
RAY
Mary Ann, you got nothing to worry about.
Listen, you tell your mother that Ray
sends his love and kisses.
MARY ANN
(laughs) She'll love that.
Mary Ann leaves.
INT Ray's House - Rachel and Robbie's Room - Dawn
Robbie is watching the TV stories about lighting storms in other
parts of the world. Channel changes ever few seconds. Ray turns
off the TV and throws Robbie's baseball mitt at him. He catches
it and says...
ROBBIE
Baseball season's over.
RAY
Five minutes. It's not going to kill
you.
Ray takes off his shirt, seems to loose his cap with it, and
takes off his boots as he gets in his bed and goes to sleep.
INT Ray's House - Living room -
Day
Rachel is flipping TV channels as Ray walks down the hall after
his nap. He sits down and sees Rachel picking at a splinter.
Rachel has his hard hat on.
RAY
What's the matter?
RACHEL
I got a splinter.
RAY
Where'd you get it. Come here.
RACHEL
On your porch railing.
RAY
What, you want me to... (beat) You want
me to take that out for you?
RACHEL
Absolutely not!
RAY
Well, come here let me see it.
Rachel shows him but doesn't let him touch it for fear he may
pull it out. Rachel and Ray ad lib as she stops moving it and
he looks at it.
RAY
It's gonna get infected.
RACHEL
No it wont.
RAY
Yes, it's gonna get infected.
RACHEL
No, it won't. When it's ready, my body
will just push it out.
RAY
Push it out?
RACHEL
I read that. (as she sits back down)
You should get TiVo. Tim got it for
my room. It's awesome. I can watch all
my shows after homework.
RAY
Yeah, I'll just put that on my platinum
card. Robbie? (no response) Robbie?
Ray takes a bite of the food sitting on the coffee table in front
of him, having no idea what it is.
RAY
(with the disgusting food in his mouth)
What is that?
RACHEL
Hummus.
RAY
Hummus?
RACHEL
From the health food place. I kept one
of their menus last time we were here.
Ray gives Rachel a "this is gross" look and she gawks at him.
RACHEL
Uh, you said order!
RAY
(laughs) I meant order food! Where is
Robbie?
RACHEL
He went out.
RAY
Out where?
RACHEL
I don't know. He just took your car
and left.
EXT Ray's House - Front Driveway - Day
He glances at his open garage door with the car that should have
been in it. He runs across the street to search for his car.
As he sees everyone else looking at the sky, he looks himself
to find a large black cloud with a white hole in the middle of
it. The cloud is swirling as if it was being artificially turned.
FRIEND 1
You ever see something like that?
RAY
(scratching his chin) In the springtime
maybe. Not this time of year. Come on,
we can see better from the back yard.
(continuous) EXT Ray's House - Back Yard - Day
Ray runs by the fence to his back yard. As he runs, the wind
starts to pick up. 30-40 mph.
RAY
That is so weird.
FRIEND 2
What?
RAY
The wind is blowing toward the storm.
FRIEND 2
That is weird.
Winds pick up faster. 40-50 mph.
RAY
Rachel, wanna see something cool?
Rachel rushes down the stairs to his side and hugs him in fear.
Pan up to view the 'storm' that appears to be lighting up with
multiple colored lights. Wide angle shot of clothes blowing in
the wind. Suddenly the wind dies down to nothing. Lightning hits
the pavement about 300 feet away.
RAY
It's okay.
RACHEL
I want to go inside.
RAY
It's okay.
RACHEL
I want to go inside.
RAY
Okay, you go ahead.
The friend's baby starts to cry...
FRIEND 2
That's enough weather for me. (begins
walking inside)
RACHEL
I don't want to go by myself.
BAM!! BAM!! BAM!!! LIGHTNING hits the ground more rapidly and
louder now. Rachel and Ray run towards the eves of the house.
BAM! The lighting continues. BAM!
RAY
Kind of fun, ain't it?
RACHEL
No.
RAY
Oh, Come on. It's like the fourth of
July.
RACHEL
No it's not.
Ray begins singing as... BAM!! The LIGHTNING gets even louder
and scares the both of them enough to hightail it for the house.
BAM!!! Half the car alarms go off in a 10 block radius. BAM!!
Another few car alarms go off. BAM!!! Louder and louder the LIGHTNING
continues.
INT Ray's House - Kitchen - Day
Ray and Rachel are running as fast as they can up the stairs
into the kitchen. BAM!! The lighting continues again and makes
Rachel scream.
RAY
It's okay. You're fine.
RACHEL
It hit right behind our house.
RAY
Yeah, well it's not gonna hit there
again because lighting doesn't strike
twice in the same place.
BAM!! It hits again and makes Ray jump.
RAY
Oh, SHIT!
They both get under the table for safety as the LIGHTING continues.
They both begin panicking. BAM!! BAM!! BAM!! The LIGHTNING goes
on with no apparent end. Ray and Rachel both scurry on the floor
under the table as the lighting goes on.
RACHEL
Where's Robbie?
RAY
I don't know.
RACHEL
Is Robbie okay? (no response) Are you
okay?
BAM! The lighting continues.
RAY
Where's the thunder?
RACHEL
Why won't it stop?
Pan out from under the table as the lightning subsides and all
is silent.
RACHEL
(with hesitation) Is it over?
Ray remains speechless as he is fixated on the area where the
lightening came from. Ray climbs out from under the table to
get an idea of what just happened.
RACHEL
Where are you going?
RAY
Just checking things out. Just wait,
wait there.
RACHEL
Are we going to be okay?
RAY
I don't know.
RACHEL
You don't know.
RAY
No. I meant... Rachel, please, just
stop asking so many questions. Just
wait here.
Ray walks around to various parts of the kitchen to see if everything
is okay. The power is off. After saying "just wait here" he then
walks into the living room. Nothing in the living room has power.
He checks his phone which doesn't work. He tries his cell phone
which also appears to not work at all. He sees his watch which
has also stopped working.
Ray runs into his room while Rachel and Robbie are downstairs.
He hastily enters the combination to a metal box that contains
a hand gun. He tucks the gun into his belt on his back and folds
his shirts over it.
Street Sidewalk - Evening
Ray, Rachel, and Robbie are walking at a very fast pace down
the sidewalk with about 20 other people around them. Rachel is
clutching Ray's hand and Robbie is carrying the box of food.
ROBBIE
What's happening?
RAY
Shh, Shh, I can't tell you now. We...
We've only got about another minute.
Ray sees the car that Manny was working on just as Manny's Apprentice
closes the hood. Ray mutters...
RAY
Please, Please, Please.
People are seen rushing down the street in the intersecting direction.
Ray, Robbie and Rachel approach the car.
RAY
Just keep it down.
ROBBIE
Ray, I'm standing right beside you.
Can you please answer me?
Ray does not respond as he looks in the ignition and finds keys.
RAY
Just get in the front seat Robbie.
Ray loads Rachel in the middle row of seats as Robbie gets in
the passenger seat.
RACHEL
Who's car is this?
RAY
Just get in.
RACHEL
Who's car is this?
Ray throws Rachel's bag in the row of seats behind her, slams
the door and starts walking to the driver side of the car. He
is caught by Manny walking.
MANNY
Hey, Hey, Ray! You were absolutely right.
I had to change the sole... Ray?
Manny sees Ray has loaded his whole family into the car.
MANNY
Hey Ray? Ray? What?
Manny walks over to the passenger side as Ray and Robbie watch
him.
MANNY
Ray. Open up.
Ray, who did no such thing sits there. Robbie looks at ray wondering
what he's going to do.
MANNY
Open the door, come on! OPEN THE DOOR
RAY!
Ray reaches over Robbie and opens the door.
MANNY
What are you...
RAY
(interrupts him) Get in.
MANNY
That's funny, you gotta get out of the
car. You can't take it.
Ray tries to get Manny to calm down from the panic he is in...
MANNY
It's not my car. It's not your car.
Where you going? Daddy's acting crazy
kids. Guy's gonna come back...
RAY
(interrupts him) I don't have time to
expl....
MANNY
(interrupts him) You're busting my chops.
I got a shop to run. You know how many
people...
RAY
(interrupts him) Get in!
MANNY
No, RAY GET OUT OF THE...
RAY
GET IN MANNY OR YOU'RE GONNA DIE!
Rachel begins crying as she says...
RACHEL
What do you mean?
A dead silent pause falls on everyone. Robbie stares at Ray in
fright as Ray and Manny stare at each other.
MANNY
All right, get out of the truck! I'm
not kidding now. GET OUT OF THE CAR
RAY!
Rachel cries more as a view of an approaching robot shoots flame
at a nearby tree. Ray and Manny continue as Rachel looks at the
flaming tree.
MANNY
I'm not fooling around, I got a busy
day ahead of me...
RAY
(to Robbie) Close the door! CLOSE IT!
Ray helps Robbie close the door on Manny as they begin speeding
away.
MANNY
RAY! BRING THE CAR BACK RAY! IT'S NOT
MY CAR!
Manny just finishes his line as he is zapped by a disintegrator
beam. Camera shows the auto shop zapped by the beam and exploding
to smithereens.
Trying to outrun the beams...
RAY
GET DOWN! GET DOWN! GET DOWN!
RACHEL
Is this the terrorists?!?!
RAY
JUST GET DOWN. GET DOWN!
Ray grabs Robbie's collar of his jacket and shoves him toward
the floor.
RAY
GET DOWN!
ROBBIE
HOLY SHIT!
High shot shows the bridge behind Ray's house being blasted away.
The expressway gets hit by the beams and overturns into the houses
below. One of them Ray's. An explosion is seen as a fuel tanker
falls on Ray's house that obliterates 4 houses. Flaming debris
flies all over behind the van.
The van has now made it on to the freeway where hundreds of cars
are scattered all over the road broken down. The van speeds by
them honking the horn every few cars.
ROBBIE
Where are we going?!?!?!
RAY
We gotta go! We got to be the only working
car around here. I'm not stopping until
we are clear.
ROBBIE
CLEAR OF WHAT?!?!
RAY
We gotta go.
ROBBIE
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON!?!?!?
RAY
YOU SAW! WE'RE UNDER ATTACK!!
Rachel begins frantically crying. After a few seconds, she begins
hyperventilating.
ROBBIE
BY WHO? WHO IS ATTACKING US?!?!
RAY
Rachel... Rachel you've got to keep
it down Rachel!
After honking his horn a few more times, she has only gotten
worse.
RAY
Rachel! SHUT UP RACHEL! I CAN'T THINK!
ROBBIE
(with a vein driven face) YOU ARE FREAKING
HER OUT!!
RAY
WELL, LOOK, I'M DRIVING, DO SOMETHING!!!
Robbie turns to the back seat as an attempt to calm Rachel. He
thinks of an old technique he was taught.
ROBBIE
Okay, (slapping his arms together on
top of each other, demonstrating) Put
em' up Rache.
Rachel makes his demonstrated arm formation.
ROBBIE
Make the arms. (he grabs her elbows
so she holds the position. He begins
to calm her down) This space right here,
this is yours.
Robbie stares directly into her eyes. She takes deep breaths
to regain control. She is able to open her eyes and stare back
into his eyes to maintain contact.
ROBBIE
... This belongs to you, right?
RACHEL
(panting, but keeping eye contact) Yes...
ROBBIE
(reassuring her) You're safe in your
space.
RACHEL
(keeping eye contact) I'm safe in my
space.
ROBBIE
(reassuring her) You're safe in your
space. Nothing is going to happen to
you in your space.
Ray looks back into the back seat in amazement at Robbie able
to do what he's doing.
RACHEL
I'm really scared.
ROBBIE
I'm gonna go to the front seat to talk
to dad...
RACHEL
No....
ROBBIE
(reassuring her) I will be two feet
away. Okay.
Rachel breaks eye contact and starts controlling her breathing
while Robbie grabs her hand as reassurance.
ROBBIE
Will you hold my hand?
RACHEL
Yes.
ROBBIE
Are you gonna be okay?
RACHEL
(relatively calm) Yes.
Robbie grabs her hand and they both lean forward toward the front.
ROBBIE
(taking a breath to calm himself) I
want to know everything you know.
Ray looks into Robbie's eyes who is looking straight forward
on the road.
RAY
This thing, this machine, it crawled
out of the ground and started torching
everything, just killing everybody.
ROBBIE
What is it? (break) Is it terrorists?
RAY
No, this came from some place else.
ROBBIE
You mean like Europe?
RAY
NO ROBBIE!! NOT LIKE EUROPE!!!
Ray swerves to miss a car as the camera cranes around to the
driver's side.
RAY
That machine, it was already buried.
Ray looks into the sky. What for is unknown.
RAY
Maybe it came down in the lightning
storm.
ROBBIE
Wait a minute... you just said it was
buried.
RAY
No, the machine I'm talking about was
buried. But, what came down in the lighting
storm, what operates it. That's the...
that's the.... You know. The....
Robbie jumps back into the passenger's seat as Rachel scoots
forward in the back seat. Robbie is looking toward the sky.
RACHEL
The what?
ROBBIE
Why aren't there any helicopters or
airplanes?
RAY
Hey Rache. How you doing there girl?
(to Robbie) How she doing?
ROBBIE
How you doing?
RACHEL
I'm fine.
ROBBIE
(to Ray) She's good.
RAY
Good.
Hey, what was that thing you
did with her?
ROBBIE
Works sometimes. She gets claustrophobic.
RAY
Hey Rachel
RACHEL
I want mom.
RAY
I know. You feel better?
RACHEL
I want mom.
RAY
Yeah, tell me about it, you know?
RACHEL
Take me to Mom's!
RAY
Listen, I just need you to hold it together
for me, okay?
RACHEL
I WANT MOM!!!
RAY
When you start screaming like that,
you know, I can't really...
RACHEL
TAKE ME TO MOM!!!
Robbie gets back into the back seat to repeat the "arms" process
with her to calm her again.
RAY
I know...
RACHEL
TAKE ME TO MOM'S!!!
RAY
That's where we're going right now.
RACHEL
TAKE ME TO MOM'S!!!
RAY
I KNOW!!
Rachel and Robbie are shouting for "mom" and "Tim" as Ray walks
through the door. Rachel and Robbie meet Ray in the entry from
different parts of the house in their search.
ROBBIE
They're gone.
RACHEL
Is she dead??
RAY
She's not dead. All right? She's just
no here. Okay? They're never here.
ROBBIE
How do you know?
RAY
Because they are on their way to Boston....
The camera goes to the phone which is briskly picked up by Robbie.
Then the camera views into the new family vacation portrait next
to the phone. It has Ray missing who is replaced by Tim.
RAY
... and so they just kept on going,
they're probably up to your grandma's
house by now.
ROBBIE
(dialing the phone) I'm gonna call her.
RACHEL
How come the lights are on here and
not at your place?
RAY
Umm.... Because nothing bad happened
here. Okay?
Robbie is having no luck and is only getting error tones out
of the phone.
RAY
So, were safe here. All Right?
Remembering Robbie's calming "arm" technique...
RAY
Okay, Rachel? This is your area. Okay,
you are safe in your area...
RACHEL
Dad. That's not how it goes.
RAY
Okay, well, you hungry, huh? I'll get
you some food. I'm gonna feed you. Get
something to eat.
(digs into the box)
What do we have here??
ROBBIE
.. Busy signals, one of the fast ones....
You think all the circuits are down?
RAY
(continues) Ketchup, Mustard, Ahh, Tabasco,
Barbeque Sauce. This is really good
Robbie. Vinaigrette. I said pack food.
What... What the hell is this?
ROBBIE
That's all that was in your kitchen.
RAY
Okay. No, it's all right, it's all right.
Robbie takes his hat off and sits down as Ray searches the box
for food. He finds peanut butter.
RAY
Uh, food... Uh, bread... (getting the
bread) okay, we're gonna have... umm....
We'll just get some sandwiches.
Ray takes the twist tie off the bread bag and dumps the whole
loaf on the counter. He taps his hands together to try to calm
Rachel and Robbie.
RAY
You ever see me deal? Wanna see me deal?
Okay, there's two for you, two for Robbie,
two for me, (he has one extra in his
hand) ...one for the house. (laughs)
Ray opens the peanut butter and grabs a wooden spoon from the
cooking utensil holder on the counter.
RAY
Maybe after we get done eating, I will
take you down, teach you how to play
some poker. A little five card stud...
a little blackjack...
RACHEL
I'm allergic to peanut butter.
RAY
(laughs) Since when?
RACHEL
(with a snotty look) Birth!
Robbie shakes his head yes to her statement.
RAY
Okay, well, umm, here (hands her two
pieces of bread) You can eat the bread.
Okay?
RACHEL
I'm not hungry.
RAY
Okay, well. Robbie and I are going to
be eating peanut butter sandwiches.
(to Robbie) You want jelly on this sandwich?
ROBBIE
I'm not hungry either.
RAY
You're not hungry either? Well, that's
fine.
Ray picks up the bread pieces and throws them at the sink window.
One with peanut butter sticks on the window and slowly slides
off.
RAY
Everybody just relax, okay? Because
we are here now and we're safe, and
we're gonna stay.
And in the morning
your mom and Tim are going to be here
and everything's gonna be fine. Okay?
(no responses) Okay.
Rachel and Ray are running down the stars carrying their own
pillows and blankets. Robbie follows slightly behind them carrying
his own and a few extra pillows and blankets.
RACHEL
If everything's fine, why do we have
to sleep in the basement. We've got
perfectly good beds.
RAY
It's like a slumber party.
ROBBIE
What are you afraid is gonna happen
to us?
RAY
(walks over to the weight room corner
of the basement) Nice basement.
RACHEL
I want to sleep in my bed. I've got
back problems.
RAY
Okay. You know on the Weather Channel
when there's a tornado, and they tell
you to go to the basement for safety?
It's like that.
RACHEL
There's gonna be tornadoes?
RAY
Rachel, no more talking.
Robbie puts his hat on Rachel's head and ushers her over to the
spot under the stairs where blankets are laid out. Ray walks
over to the chair about five feet away from the bed.
RACHEL
Could you be a little nicer to me. God!
Rachel and Robbie are heard in the background...
ROBBIE
Wanna stay here?
RACHEL
Yeah. Good night, love you.
ROBBIE
Love you, Rache.
Ray takes out his gun and puts it under a pillow of the sofa
as he sits down. So Robbie and Rachel wont notice.
Bushes are heard rattling against the window. They become louder
and louder against the window. Eventually they become just shy
of loud enough to wake Ray up. FLASH! A strike of lighting gets
Ray's eyes to roll back around and open. BAM! The second flash
is loud enough to get Robbie (who is now in the seat next to
Ray) to jump up next to him. A few more flashes and the lightening
starts like the first time. BAM! BAM! Every strike of lighting
lights up the entire downstairs. Rachel gets up and looks thought
the stairs.
A close up shot of Robbie. With every lightening strike, his
breathing becomes more erratic.
RACHEL
Is the lighting back?
RAY
No, this is something else...
Just as ray finishes, an ear piercing noise from a jet engine
begins. The howl rattles things off of shelves on the walls.
Robbie and Ray wince at the pain in their ears. Rachel runs up
to Robbie and hugs him in security. Things fall off of shelves
everywhere.
A shot of the incredibly bright window as the noise grows even
louder.
ROBBIE
(screams) AHHHH... WHAT'S THAT SOUND?
RAY
I NEVER HEARD THAT BEFORE!!!
RACHEL
IS IT THEM!!! IS IT THEM!!!
The lighting grows more intense as does the sound.
RAY
WE GOTTA GO!! WHERE DO WE GO??? ROBBIE,
THIS IS YOUR HOUSE, WHERE DO WE GO??
Robbie opens the door to the furnace room and shows Rachel down
the stairs who runs. Robbie goes back to get Ray.
Ray realizes he has forgotten his gun.
RAY
WAIT!! WAIT!! WAIT!! WAIT!!
Ray and Robbie run to the door just as a fireball bursts through
the windows. Flaming debris follows after. Ray gets the first
door closed but the fire blasts through the wooden one. He manages,
after a struggle, to get the metal one closed on the inside of
the furnace room.
The door closes and the room is completely black. In the dark,
you can hear the debris being thrown around everywhere around
them.
RACHEL
Are we still alive?
Ray is looking out the window at the top of the room. He is holding
on to the metal wire conduit. Seeing hardly anything, he judges
it to be safe to go outside the furnace room.
He walks by Rachel who is sleeping in Robbie's arms who is sleeping
against some copper piping. Holding his slightly burned arm in
pain, Ray exit's the room through the charred doors and finds
most of the basement in ruins. The ground floor is now the top
floor because the second floor was completely torn off.
The camera pans out to find a winding down, burning airplane
engine. Panning out further we can see ray walking through the
remains of different sections of an airplane.
REPORTER
We were feeding New York but New York
went dark. So we patched over to D.C.,
they went down, L.A., Chicago, uplink
to London. Even called the affiliates
to try and get them to catch the feed,
but nobody answered.
The reporter looks at tapes to find the one she's looking for.
When she does so, she jams it into the VCR which promptly begins
playing it.
REPORTER
It's the same everywhere. Once the tripods
start to move, no more news comes out
of that area.
She shows him a tape of about 30 tripods destroying a city.
RAY
Oh, my god!
REPORTER
You ain't seen nothing yet.
She wheels her chair around to show him the next piece.
RAY
I saw that storm. I was right in the
middle of one of those.
REPORTER
No, you didn't see it like this. Those
machines come up from under the ground,
right? That means they must have been
buried there a long time ago. So who's
driving the god damn things? (pointing
to the monitor) Watch the lightning.
Watch it..... Watch the lighting.....
She slows the footage down so he can get a good look. She advances
it slowly. She points out an alien capsule like object running
down the lighting bolt.
RAY
What is that?
REPORTER
That is them. They come down in capsules,
riding the lighting into the ground
into the machines right?
A vibration noise is heard by an approaching robot. They both
jump at the noise.
DRIVER
You hear that? We're getting the hell
out of here.
The camera man has his hands full of meals as he loads into the
van.
DRIVER
Come on! Get in! Get in! Get in!
The door almost closes on Ray as she stops and opens it again.
REPORTER
Hey. Were you on that plane?
Ray shakes his head no.
REPORTER
Oh, that's too bad, it would have been
a really great story.
She closes the door on him.
Black blend to:
Ray is talking to Rachel...
RAY
Look at me. Look at me.
Rachel and Ray are putting on their coats.
RAY
You keep your eyes only on me, you understand?
Rachel has her big eyes on him as she nods yes.
RAY
Don't look down, don't look around me.
I'm taking you to the car and you're
gonna want to look around. But you are
not going to, are you?
She shakes her head and whispers "no".
FIELD - DAWN
Ray is carrying Rachel to the van. Robbie is walking along behind
them looking at the devastation.
RAY
You're doing good. You're doing good.
Keep your eyes on me. We'll go right
to Boston, and we're gonna see your
mom.
RACHEL
I'm not gonna look, dad.
RAY
That's a girl. That's my girl.
Okay,
listen, I want you to close your eyes.
Got them closed?
RACHEL
Um-Huh.
RAY
There you go. Keep em' closed for me.
Camera follows Robbie who puts his hands on his head in amassment
of the devastation. Ray starts the car and turns it around to
pull out.
RAY
Robbie, get in.
Robbie does not react at all. Ray becomes agitated.
RAY
ROBBIE!! GET IN!!!
RACHEL
Why are you yelling?
Ray gives him a mean look as Robbie realizes that they must go.
RAY
(to Rachel) It's okay. (to Robbie) Get
in!
They pull away from the wreckage and continue on their journey.
Robbie is staring out the window in the exact opposite direction
of Ray. The radio is broadcasting the emergency alert test. Ray
turns off the radio and says...
RAY
If I close my eyes, why don't you drive
for a bit.
ROBBIE
I don't have a license.
RAY
Since when has that stopped you?
Robbie is driving into a city. Ray is sleeping in the passenger
seat. The streets are crowded with people walking. Robbie gets
worried and gets Ray to drive.
ROBBIE
Ray. (no response) Ray. (no response)
Dad!
Ray wakes up and Robbie tries to get him to take the wheel.
ROBBIE
You think you could.... You think you
could...
RAY
Don't stop... don't take your foot off...
Okay. I got it... I got it....
RACHEL
Where's everybody going?
RAY
I don't know Rach.
RACHEL
But we do right?
RAY
Yeah, we do.
They continue driving through the crowd as they become more and
more mad at Ray for not letting them on. They begin banging on
the glass.
RACHEL
Why'd he do that?
The man continues hitting the windshield.
RACHEL
Why is he doing that?
RAY
He wants a ride. Everybody just wants
a ride.
RACHEL
Can we give him one?
RAY
Just sit back and put on your seatbelt.
Robbie, put on your seatbelt.
Rachel is busy looking at all the people who are now begging
for a ride.
RAY
Put on your seatbelt Rachel.
The three of them fasten their seatbelts.
ROBBIE
Be careful.
People bang on the windows louder as they shout "give me a ride".
RAY
I'm sorry, I can't. Please get away
from the car.
A police man jumps on the hood and bangs on the window.
RAY
HEY!!
POLICE MAN 3
Stop the car!!
RAY AND ROBBIE TOGETHER
GET OFF THE CAR!!! GET OFF THE CAR!!!
POLICE MAN 3
You could carry 20 people in there!
STOP THE CAR!!!
Rachel is panicking and starts to do the "arms" process to stay
calm.
RAY AND ROBBIE TOGETHER
GET OFF THE CAR!!! GET OFF THE CAR!!!
Ray hit's the gas pedal as the police man falls off the side
of the van. Ray speeds away now and gains some speed just as
someone throws debris into the windshield which breaks it. Rachel
screams in panic.
RACHEL
(screams) AHHHH!!
RAY
Oh hold on!!
Robbie and Ray see a woman standing dead in their way holding
a baby. They swerve to miss her.
ROBBIE
Look out! Look out!
RAY
(seeing a telephone pole) Oh, GOD!
The van smashes into the telephone pole and the pole lurches
about 20 feet. The transformer on the top of the pole begins
to arc and spark. The crowd is now rocking the van from side
to side shouting at about a riot level.
RAY
Are you okay?
Rachel has no time to respond before the back windshield is busted
open by a crowd member. The driver and passenger side windows
are then promptly busted. Robbie ducks to avoid the flying glass.
A man jumps on the hood and starts ripping glass away from the
hole in the front windshield. He is so desperate to get in the
van he rips his hands to shreds. A crowd member suggests to "push
it". He does so and the glass falls through.
The passenger side door is opened and Robbie is pulled out by
the rioting crowd.
ROBBIE
(screams) AHHHHH!!!! RAY!!!
RAY
ROBBIE?!?! ROBBIE?!?!?
Ray then screams to the rioting crowd who are now pulling him
out of the driver's side window.
RAY
NO, JUST WAIT!!! WAIT!! STOP!!! JUST
STOP!!!
RACHEL
DADDY!!!!
A man from the crowd runs up to Rachel's window, breaks it, and
tries to grab Rachel. Ray pulls the man out and throws him back
into the crowd.
RAY
Rachel!! (grabs guy) GET OUT OF THERE!!!
Ray is pushed by the man he just threw and hit's the driver's
side door. Ray kicks the guy square in the gut which gets him
back into the crowd.
RACHEL
DADDY!!!
Ray wrestles another man trying to grab Rachel. The man gets
tossed to the ground. Just as Ray stands up... WHAM!!! Ray is
hit in the back of the head by a man with a baseball bat. The
blow was not severe enough to cause life threatening damage to
Ray.
RAY
(grasping his head in pain) AHHH!!!
Another man grabs Ray to try to fight him. Women in the crowd
yell to "stop them" but nobody does so. The man who is strangling
Ray yells to "get in the car". Robbie fought off the men who
pulled him out of the car, comes over to Ray's side, and begins
choking the man who is choking Ray. Robbie hit's the man's head
against the car. The man releases his grip on Ray, the man and
Robbie are drug into the rioting crowd beyond frame view.
A man gets into the driver's seat and tries to start the car.
RAY
(through a choking grip) Rachel, get
out of the car! GET OUT OF THE CAR RACHEL!!!
Ray just barely finishes as he is drug off into the crowd beyond
frame.
RACHEL
DADDY!!!
Rachel tries to get out, but there is an overflow of people barreling
into the car through the windows. She is surrounded by people
in the car. Robbie and Ray are getting beat in the crowd.
Ray manages to pull out his gun. He fires off two rounds into
the air. The crowd instantly moves away from him. One man yells
"take it easy!" No sign of Robbie.
RAY
(pointing the gun at the people on the
roof of the car) GET OFF THE CAR!! GET
OFF!!!
Men start getting off the car to avoid the gun threatening Ray.
RAY
(continues) GET OFF THE CAR!! Move!!
Move!!
Realizing Robbie is nowhere in sight....
RAY
Where's my son?!?!
RIOT MAN 1
You don't need that, Man!
RAY
WHERE'S MY SON?!?! ROBBIE!!
....
ROBBIE!!
RIOT MAN 2
Put the gun down, man. It's not me!
RAY
(still determined to find Robbie) ROBBIE!!!
Ray is able to pull Robbie out from the crowd. Robbie has a running
bloody nose and a badly bruised stomach. He is fighting to catch
his breath because he had it knocked out of him.
RACHEL
DAD!!!
The camera moves from Robbie to Ray, then pivots on his face
to reveal a man holding another gun at Ray's head.
RIOT MAN 3
Okay, man, now listen. Put down the
gun. I'm taking the car.
RAY
My daughter's in the car...
RIOT MAN 3
(shaking the gun nervously) Put down
the gun, I'm taking the car.
RAY
All I want is my daughter....
RIOT MAN 3
PUT DOWN THE GOD DAMN GUN!!!
Ray is scared into dropping his gun on the street. Ray then puts
his hands near his head to avoid being shot.
RAY
Please, all I want is my daughter.
RIOT MAN 3
(surprisingly calm) I'm taking the car.
RAY
I just want my daughter. Please just
let me take my daughter, can I.... All
I want is my daughter.
RIOT MAN 3
Yeah. Okay, go ahead, take her, take
her, yeah, yeah....
Ray grabs Rachel out of the car as the riot man gets in the driver's
seat and closes the door.
RAY
Robbie!!
Robbie, who has managed to get to his feet, hunched over, walks
over to Ray. Ray, with Rachel in his arms, and Robbie walk to
the diner on the street. The man backs up the car just as the
camera pans down to see a man who sees the gun on the street.
The man picks up Ray's gun and looks at the man in the van.
The three of them are walking to a booth in the diner. Ray, with
Rachel in his arms, is beginning to bleed from his head wound.
He walks with a slight limp. Rachel is panic stricken. Robbie
lets go of his bloody nose and, with both hands, clenches his
chest in pain. He is still fighting to catch his breath. They
are all soaked from the rain.
They all sit down at the booth. The power is flickering on and
off. As they begin to relax from the ordeal they just had, gunshots
are heard. BAM!! BAM!! Ray jumps and catches his head in his
hands as it throbs. Robbie jumps and flails his arms in pain
as the jump tightened muscles in his stomach. Robbie turns around
to see the man with Ray's gun firing at Riot Man 3. BAM! One
more gunshot is heard. Rachel scurries over to Robbie who, despite
his pain, grabs Rachel and they hug each other seeking comfort.
The van drives away.
Rachel sobs as Ray also starts crying because nobody knows what
to do from here. Robbie looks at Ray for some comfort. He has
none.
Walking Down the Street - Dusk
They are walking in a crowd of about 300. Some men share their
stories of assumption. One man says... "Europe's got it the worst...."
while another man says "We've got it the worst......" while some
people "don't give a shit who it is....."
RACHEL
Looks like the power's still on here.
RAY
Yeah, power's still on because nothing
bad has come up from under the ground.
A rail road crossing guard stick comes down as the bells and
lights start going off. The people stand behind the guard just
like cars. They wait.
A train approaches and is blowing off fireballs from an encounter
with a robot. The entire train is flaming and burning. The train,
as it whisks by is releasing pieces of red hot ash. The bars
go up as the train completes it's crossing. The people continue
walking.
The captain sees some sort of whirlpool sucking water down into
a hole. The ship begins to slowly turn toward the hole, being
sucked in.
CAPTAIN
Oh, my god!
Passengers rush over to the starboard railing where a robot emerges
from the whirlpool. WOOSH!!! Hundreds of gallons of water are
tossed up with the robot. The water in the air turns to snow
as it falls on the ship. The robot's engines howl in the air.
RAY
(fearing danger to his son) ROBBIE!!!
The robot's claws begin pushing the ship making it lean to one
side and finally tip over on it's side. Robbie is already running
towards Ray. At the turn of the ship, the three go into the water.
Cars start coming towards them. WOOSH!!! A car comes right for
them. SPLASH!!! The car hit's the water where they are, instantly
pinning Robbie and Ray to the front of it. Rachel is holding
on to Robbie's back, also going down.
The people in the car are screaming as the car fills with water.
As the ship completely capsizes, people are thrown or washed
into the water. Cars sink down, people float and the ship bobs
in the water. Ray is able to un-pin himself and pulls Robbie
out. They all begin swimming to the surface. Rachel lags behind
and Robbie grabs her and helps her up.
At the surface, they
meet. A ship propeller at full power. They begin to swim away
from it. Claws from the ship over head are grabbing people and
pulling them into the robot's holds.
Harland walks up to the lantern hanging on the wall and looks
at Ray and Rachel. His face, half lit looks medieval with the
clothes he wears.
Harland grabs the lantern and carries it over to where Ray and
Rachel are huddled shivering in their damp clothes.
HARLAND
(to Rachel) You all right?
Rachel does not respond most likely due to shock.
HARLAND
(to Ray) And what about you?
Ray looks up at him and looks at the lantern. He is still heard
muttering "Robbie" very quietly.
Harland moves a wheel barrel as rats are seen scurrying about
on the floor. The army platoon has gone far enough over the hill
that gunfire can no longer be seen or heard.
RAY
(while Harland moves the wheel barrel)
(to Rachel) There you go. Is that comfortable?
I need you to close your eyes now, okay?
You need some sleep.
Rachel's face is pure white with some red around her eyes.
RACHEL
Dad?
Ray already knows what she is going to ask.
RAY
He's gonna meet us. Hey, Robbie's gonna
meet us, Rach, In Boston, at your grandma's.
Harland is watching them through fallen out boards in the wall.
RACHEL
(about ready to cry) What do you think
mom's doing right this minute?
Harland sits down on the stairs to listen to their conversation.
He begins sharpening a shovel with a file.
RAY
Mom? She's in Boston. Waiting. And I
know she's not sleeping 'cause she is
so worried about you. (trying to comfort
her) ... And she's in grandma's kitchen,
and she's making that awful tea that
she makes. And they're all just... ...
...there all just counting the minutes
until they see you again.
Rachel is crying because she misses Robbie and her mom. Ray sees
the first place ribbon she keeps carrying around and begins to
investigate what it is.
RAY
(picking up the ribbon) What is this?
What... What is this?
RACHEL
I won.
RAY
You won?
RACHEL
The walk, trot, and canter. Third place.
She begins to feel dreary...
RACHEL
Sing me "Lullaby and Goodnight"?
RAY
(shakes his head in displeasure because
he can't think of it) I don't remember
that one.
RACHEL
Sing me "Hushabye Mountain"?
RAY
I'm sorry Rach, I don't know that one
either.
Rachel turns over (her back to Ray) because she realizes that
it is a lost hope to get a song out of him. Ray thinks for a
moment and remembers an old nursery rhyme he was taught.
RAY
(begins to sing) I'm not bragging, baby.
So don't put me down. Because I've got
the fastest set of wheels in the town.
Something comes up to me that don't
even try....
Rachel turns back over as Ray continues singing...
RAY
(continues singing) ... If I had a set
of wings, man, I know she could fly.
She's my little deuce coupe. You don't
know what I've got... just my little
deuce coupe. (now whispering) You don't
know what I've got....
Rachel has fallen asleep. Ray kisses her on the forehead. Harland
taps two glasses together and says...
HARLAND
Peach schnapps.
Ray gets up and begins walking towards him.
HARLAND
Disgusting, I know it. I found a whole
case of this shit.
Harland hands Ray a glass as they both sit down.
RAY
Thank you.
Silence falls over for a period.
HARLAND
I'm sorry about your son.
RAY
We got separated... he's gonna meet
us in umm... in Boston.
Ray drinks the schnapps as he begins to ask...
RAY
Did you... (pauses) ... (whispers) Did
you loose anybody?
HARLAND
All of them.
Another pause.
HARLAND
(introduces himself) Harland Ogilvy.
RAY
(introduces himself) Ray Ferrier.
They shake hands.
HARLAND
I got water... Food.... Enough for weeks.
You're welcome to stay, both of yous.
Ray gets up from the conversation.
RAY
I'm sorry. I'm gonna get some sleep.
HARLAND
(speaks loud enough to get Ray to pause)
Those machines, those tripods they got...
They buried them... right under our
feet. Since before there were even people
here. They've been planning this for
a million years. We're beat to shit.
Ray looks at Harland sternly because he is afraid Rachel may
hear what he may say next.
RAY
Please, my daughter.
HARLAND
Think about it.
...
They defeated
the greatest power in the world in a
couple days. Walked right over us.
....
And these are only the first,
they'll keep coming. This is not a war
any more than there's a war between
men and maggots. This is an extermination.
Ray walks over to where Rachel is sleeping.
HARLAND
(feeling he's not grasping the reality)
Are you afraid?
RAY
Of course I am.
HARLAND
(going on) I been around death plenty.
Drive an ambulance in the city. Well,
drove and ambulance in the city. That's
all over now, huh?
....
You know
the people who make it Ray? The ones
that don't flatline before the hospital?
It's the ones who keep their eyes open,
keep looking at you, keep thinking.
....
There the ones who survive...
....
We can' t loose our heads
Ray.
....
Running, that's what'll
kill you.
......
I'm dead set
on livin'.
He pauses and begins chuckling at his own joke.
HARLAND
Hah. Dead set on Living.
Harland walks back over to the place where the conversation first
started.
RAY
Thank you for taking us in.
Ray lies down next to Rachel as Harland finishes...
HARLAND
We're not going to be exterminated.
The ground starts shaking from robots walking around outside.
Ray gets back up just as BOOM!! A small piece of the corner of
the basement collapses from all the vibration.
HARLAND
(with shotgun at side) It's okay! Come
on, I wanna show you something!
They both are waling towards a window.
HARLAND
We're gonna fight them Ray. They gotta
have a weakness. Come on, take a look.
Ray and Harland see two robots spraying vine like strands out
of a hole on the bottom of the ship onto the ground.
HARLAND
Somehow they killed a few of these things
in Osaka. That's what I heard. You telling
me the Japanese can figure it out but
we can't?
Ray goes over to Rachel and picks her up to take her somewhere
else.
HARLAND
We can do it. We can get 'em. We can
figure it out.
Ray puts the now wide awake Rachel in a chair.
RAY
Stay right there!
Ray opens up a window guard to see two robots skimming the ground
almost as if they are tilling up the soil. He now understands
that robots do this on a regular basis.
RAY
I have a daughter! Why did you bring
us here?
HARLAND
To fight 'em together, Ray.
....
Now we'll be the ones coming up from
underground. When the time is right,
we'll take 'em by supries, the way they
took us. We'll take 'em by surprise.
Ray puts his hands over his face as he realizes he is staying
with an insane man.
HARLAND
We're right under their feet, Ray. Right
here, under their feet.
Ray looks at the mysterious red plant that is growing wildly.
He feels it and them snaps a piece of it off of a pipe. He examines
it closely as he walks over to the window where lights are beaming
in and out as the robots work. He takes another piece of a wall
and studies that one.
Ray hears a hovering craft over his head. A light flows over
the roof boards that streams down to the other end of a board
hall in the basement. Harland is sitting on the stairs with Rachel.
HARLAND
You miss your mommy? I had a little
girl nearly your age. You know, if anything
happens to your daddy, I'll take care
of you.
Ray is very angry that Harland is saying things like that to
his daughter.
RAY
Rachel!
Rachel runs towards him and he points to stand beside him. They
both stare at Harland, on the stairs, in dismay.
RAY
(distinctly angry, but not yelling)
You don't have anything to say to her,
do you understand? If you want to talk
to somebody, or ask somebody a question,
you ask me!
HARLAND
(also angry at Ray) What exactly is
your plan, Ray? I know what I'm gonna
do. How about you? You gonna sit here,
wait for them to come get you? Is that
your plan?
Harland walks around to different parts of the basement doing
miscellaneous things.
HARLAND
Maybe you want to get caught. Couple
of days hiding in a basement too much
for you, I bet. You'll probably turn
yourself right in!
The robots outside stop moving. All the rumbling stops.
RAY
Listen. It stopped.
HARLAND
(paying no attention) Maybe you'll be
okay. Maybe you'll get lucky and they'll
train you as their pet. You know, train
you, feed you, teach you how to do tricks...
RAY
(yells) WILL YOU SHUT UP AND LISTEN?!?!?!
Pieces of wood fall from the hole as a robot camera comes floating
down into the hole. Ray hides behind the stairs. The camera eye
opens and lights turn on for it.
Rachel is hiding as well. The camera looks around the couch.
Ray moves as to not be seen by it moving around the couch. It
sees a rat and quickly follows it for a few seconds. Ray and
Harland exchange looks as Ray runs toward Rachel to hide with
her.
The robot continues checking out the basement. Harland grabs
an axe to cut off the camera from it's limb. Ray shakes his head
no to get him to stop. Ray silently does expressions to convince
him not to.
Harland goes towards ray so they can hide together. Harland almost
makes it before he thuds against a cabinet full of glass containers
which clang together. The robot hears this and turns around toward
the noise. They run to a different spot.
Robot gets closer...
Ray puts a mirror in front of the doorway to trick the robot
into seeing another robot. The camera looks over the mirror and
sees nothing.
It turns around just as... Rachel's boot slides, making a noise.
The robot views into the boot that is hanging out. It looks behind
the mirror to find just a boot sitting there. Ray, Rachel and
Harland are in the middle of the basement. A sight of relief
comes as the robot camera exit's out of the hole.
Now the actual aliens come into the basement. Harland turns the
lantern out and runs to hide. The aliens look around the basement.
They look at, smell, and touch various different things throughout
the basement. Ray, Rachel, and Harland scurry to different parts
of the basement.
Harland loads his gun and aims it to fire at one of the aliens
but the gun is pulled back by Ray.
RAY
(dead silent) Give me that!
Ray and Harland are in a silent fight for the gun. They both
have their hands on it. The aliens continue looking around.
Ray and Harland are both sweating bullets fighting for the gun.
Still silently.
Harland pins Ray against the wall and forces
him down to the ground to try and break the gun free of his grasp.
The aliens are seen taking and smelling a photograph from a box.
Ray lets go of the gun and Harland jerks it away from him just
as the vibration like noise is heard from the robot. The aliens
scurry out through the open hole.
Harland comes down to Ray, now sitting on the floor, and says....
HARLAND
You and I... I don't
think we are on
the same page.
The vines ray looked at are growing at a phenomenal rate along
the concrete slab under the window. Robots are spraying a red
mist out of the back of their ships. Ray holds his hand in the
mist that is entering the window.
After a moment.... Ray retracts
his hand and turns it over to reveal what appears to be blood.
HARLAND
RAY!!! RAY!!!! RAY!!!! RAY!!!!
RAY
KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN!!! QUIET!!!
Harland turns around and his whole face is covered in spots of
blood.
They both turn back around then Harland runs. Ray watches a man
being set down, fighting to be let go. A needle like object comes
down and stabs the man. It then pumps the blood out of him. Ray
has a horrified look on his face.
HARLAND
(repeats for about 2 minutes) Not My
Blood!!!
Ray realizes they will have the same fate if he keeps yelling.
Then... the robots stop because they hear him. Ray runs to Harland
who is digging some sort of hole.
RAY
Stop it! Stop it! You gotta stop it!
You gotta be quiet or they'll hear you!
HARLAND
(with an insane expression and tone)
They drink us!
RAY
Please, they'll hear you!
HARLAND
Then they spray us, like a fertilizer!
RAY
You gotta be quiet!
HARLAND
Drink US and....
RAY
They're gonna come back down here!
Harland has mentally lost it now.
HARLAND
Then they spit us out all over their
goddamn red weeds!
RAY
(no longer whispering) Do you understand
what I'm gonna have to do? I can't let
my daughter die because of you.
Harland pays no attention to him.
HARLAND
This tunnel will get us to the city.
We'll have our own tunnels there. Ready
Made! Subway, see what I'm saying!
RAY
Stop it!
HARLAND
You can hide a whole army down there!
RAY
Stop it!!
HARLAND
... We'll go underground!
RAY
STOP IT!!!
HARLAND
Sneak attacks at night!
RAY
YOU STOP IT!!!
Ray grabs him by the arm just as he hits ray in the forehead
with a shovel. Ray releases his grip and lies on a dirt pile
next to Harland.
HARLAND
We're the resistance Ray! They can't
occupy this country! Occupations always
fail! History's taught us that a thousand
times. This is our land.
Ray runs up the stairs of the room to Rachel standing calmly
in the middle of the basement.
HARLAND
(continues) ... We eat it, we breathe
it, only we can live on it! They can't
survive here Ray. They weren't built
for it.
Ray hugs Rachel because he knows what he has to do.
Harland goes on saying odd things as Ray gets Rachel prepared
for what he has to do.
Ray puts a black cloth over Rachel's eyes which makes her breathing
go erratic.
RACHEL
What are you doing?
RAY
Whatever you hear... don't take this
off.
RACHEL
Dad??
RAY
Rach?
RACHEL
Dad?
RAY
What was that song... that lullaby I
didn't know?
RACHEL
Hushabye Mountains
RAY
Yeah. Please, Rach, sing it.
RACHEL
(begins to sing) ... A gentle breeze....
RAY
Don't stop.
RACHEL
... On Hushabye Mountain...
RAY
That's my girl.
RACHEL
... For far away my baby goes...
Ray kisses her hands and has her put them over her ears. Then
walks back to Harland. He is still digging and chanting "not
my blood"
RACHEL
... it fills the sails ...
Harland stops and sees Ray standing in the doorway.
RACHEL
... of boats that are waiting ...
Ray closes the door behind him as he steps in.
RACHEL
... Waiting to sail your worries away
...
Rachel hears screams and grunts as the two men fight behind the
door.
RACHEL
... So close your eyes. You're on Hushabye
Mountain ...
Rachel's voice begins trembling as she holds her ears tighter.
RACHEL
... Wave goodbye to the cares of the
day and watch your boat, from Hushabye
Mountain, sail far away from Lullaby
Bay.
All is silent for a while. Ray opens the door and walks out.
Rachel releases her hands and takes off the blindfold. Ray is
sitting on the stairs.
Rachel sits in his lap and puts his arms around her. They both
sit there in silence.
Ray and Rachel are sleeping on the couch. As we view down from
Ray's face we find that Rachel is wide awake for some reason.
She sits up and....
RACHEL
(screams) AHHHH!!!
A robot camera is 1' away from her face. Rachel runs to the wall,
still screaming as ray hit's the camera with his hands. The camera
hit's the ceiling and shakes it's self off of debris.
Ray begins blasting the axe he had in hand into the camera attachment
line. Rachel screams as he hit's the line. Over and over and
over. Rachel runs up the basement stairs. Ray continues hitting
it and it finally pulls away. The camera, still attached by a
hair, hits some wood planks and is pulled out of the hole.
RAY
Rachel???
No response for a few seconds, then Rachel lets off a gut wrenching
scream.
RAY
RACHEL!!!
(to himself) Oh, my god,
no!
He runs up the stairs to search for her in the house.
RAY
Rachel? Rachel? (looks up the stairs)
Rachel??
Ray opens the front door to find red vines coated in blood in
the doorway. He quickly brushes them down stepping out the door.
RAY
(searching) Rachel, make some noise
baby. Rachel??
He begins walking down a path to look for her farther out.
RAY
Rachel? Rachel? Talk to me baby, come
on!
He gets no response from Rachel. All is dead silent accept for
him.
RAY
Rachel?!? RACHEL?!?!?!
Ray sees an entire field of blood coated red vines beyond the
hill.
RAY
RACHEL!!!! RACHEL!!!
A robot's lights turn on to him as a food lands close enough
to him to blow him back. One of the robot's grabbing claws comes
after Ray. He hides in a truck. The claw breaks through the glass,
grabs the car, and flips it, causing it to roll about 3 times.
RAY
(screams) AHH!
Now in the car, lying upside down, he hears Rachel scream. He
looks and Rachel is standing at the top of a hill.
The robot centers above her and begins to grab her with a claw.
Ray runs towards her to try and do what he can to stop it.
RACHEL
(screams) AHHHHH!!!!
RAY
NO NO NO!!!
The robot blasts through a building. Ray is right behind the
foot. He runs into an army vehicle and finds a belt full of grenades.
He takes on off, removes the pin and throws it at the robot.
RAY
HEY!!!
It hit's the robot's shields and the robot turns right around.
It eyeballs Ray for a moment and picks him up by a grabbing claw.
RAY
(screams in pain) AHHH!
He is thrown into a cage with about 30 other people in it as
well. The gate closes on the top as he is thrown in. The camera
shows he is in one of two cages. People scream and cry in confusion.
Ray spots Rachel sitting on the side of the grate.
RAY
RACHEL!!
He goes towards her just as the door opens, it makes a sound
and a grabbing claw comes out of a hole on the robot. Ray falls
down (luckily), it grabs another person and sucks him into the
ship. The same happens in the other cage.
RAY
(reaching Rachel) Rachel. (no response)
Rachel.
She seems to be frozen.
RAY
Rachel.
RACHEL
Dad?
Ray goes to speak just as BOOM! The grate shifts, tossing all
the people around and the door opens to take another person up.
Ray ducks down with Rachel but this is noticed by the grabbing
claw. He is swept up by it. Rachel holds on to his neck to go
with him. But then, Ray sees his belt of grenades. He prigs Rachel's
hands off of him and grabs the grenades. A soldier sees this
and latches onto Ray's arm.
SOLDIER 2
Pull me! Pull me!!!
People all start latching on to the soldier and begin heaving
him and Ray down. They loose ground until more people join.
SOLDIER 2
We got him! Keep pulling! Pull me!
Ray is let loose by the clamp and they all fall back into the
cage. Ray spits out two grenade pins out of his mouth. This is
seen by the soldier.
SOLDIER 2
EVERYBODY DOWN!!!
Hardly anybody gets down as the inside of the robot explodes.
We can see the robot exploding on the inside. It breaks doors
and fluid stars spilling out of it. The robot releases it's cages
and they fall into a tree. Splitting open. People promptly climb
out.
Once the robot falls to the ground, Rachel looks at Ray in a
way that meant how did you do that.
Boston City Limits - Freeway - Day
Ray walks with Rachel down the road as soldiers are ushering
them to "keep moving." The crows are now eating the red plant
which appears to be dying rapidly.
Ray picks up a piece, of
dead plant.
RACHEL
What happened to it?
Ray crumples the plant in his hand. It turns to dust and blows
away.
RAY
It's dying.
Watching the dust, they walk along to find a robot lying half
struck into a building.
RAY
What happened?
SOLDIER 3
I don't know, something's happening
to them. Please keep moving.
Ray goes up to another soldier for information.
RAY
Something's happening to them?
SOLDIER 4
Go. Go. Just keep moving, sir.
Ray asks another soldier down the road for information.
RAY
Excuse me, excuse me, what happened
here? You guys take it down?
SOLDIER 5
No sir, it was behaving erratically,
walking in circles then it went down
on it's own about an hour ago. (to people)
Now let's keep moving, don't stop do
not stop! Keep moving!
Rachel and Ray are walking down the road with soldiers and other
people.
RACHEL
How is it dead all by it's self?
RAY
Rachel, I'm not sure.
Seeing another robot, one soldier motions to get into the water
tunnel. Other soldiers make signals to get set up for defense
if necessary. Everyone gets into the tunnel. A soldier can be
heard telling everyone "calm down and get in the tunnel".
Ray notices that birds are flying over AND LANDING ON the robot.
The robot's shields are down. As he goes to tell someone, the
robot makes the viberating sound.
RAY
(to a soldier, during the robot noise)
LOOK AT THE BIRDS!!!
SOLDIER 6
I CAN'T HEAR YOU!!!
RAY
LOOK AT THE BIRDS!!!
SOLDIER 6
I CAN'T HEAR YOU!!
RAY
(louder) LOOK AT THE GOD DAMN BIRDS!!!
The soldier looks at them and doesn't get what Ray's getting
at. He looks back at Ray. The noise continues erratically as
if the robot is fighting to stay alive.
RAY
NO SHIELDS!!!
SOLDIER 6
(motions and says) I CAN'T HEAR YOU!!!
RAY
(pointing) NO SHIELDS!!!
SOLDIER 6
(now getting it) (to the soldiers) THE
JAVELIN'S THE KEY! LOAD THE GUSTAV,
IT'S GONNA BE A TOUGH KILL!!! LET'S
GO!!!
Ray gets in the tunnel as all the soldiers come running out.
RAY
(to the people in the tunnel and Rachel)
It's safer in here!
SOLDIER 6
LETS GO!!! BRIGN OUT THE JAVELIN!!!
Soldiers scurry to get set up and they hurriedly fire missiles
at the robot. The first missile hit's the grabbing claws and
knocks them off. A few more shots and the robot collapses into
a nearby factory. The factory explodes and the robot grinds to
a halt on the ground. They check it to be clear as an alien falls
out of the door. It quickly dies on site.
SOLDIER 6
IT'S CLEAR!
We watch the alien turn to stone as it dies.
Boston - Walking Down Street near Mary Ann's Mother's house -
Day
Mary Ann walks up to the front door and sees Ray walking down
the street with Rachel in his arms. She flutters open the doors
and she and Rachel run towards each other on the street. Mary
Ann begins crying.
RACHEL
MOM!!!
They hug each other crying.
Mary Ann looks at Ray who is still standing in the middle of
the street.
MARY ANN
(just barely hearable) Thank you.
Mary Ann's parents come out of the door. The mother has a shocked
look on her face. Tim is behind them.
Ray's eyes and face perk up as we see ROBBIE coming down the
front steps towards him.
RACHEL
Robbie?
Ray and Robbie take a good look at each other and Robbie finally
mutters with a dry throat.
ROBBIE
Hey dad!
They hug each other in thankfulness for each other's survival.

NARRATOR
From the moment the invaders arrived,
breathed our air, ate and drank, they
were doomed. They were undone, destroyed,
after all of man's weapons and devices
had failed, by the tiniest creatures
that God and his wisdom, put upon this
earth. At the toll of a billion deaths,
man had earned his immunity, is right
to survive among this planet's infinite
organisms. And that right is ours against
all challenges, for men do not live
nor die in vein.
