The undisturbed beauty of nature serves as our backdrop as
we MOVE CLOSER to Kale and Jeff, taking note of their t-
shirts: Jeff's has a silkscreened cartoon rendition of a
Bass wearing aviator goggles with mounted missiles on its
fins. Beneath it, the slogan: "Weapons of Bass Destruction."
The fish on Kale's shirt wears a stock car uniform, a single
word across the bottom: BASSCAR.
As Jeff steadies Kale's hand and pulls away:
JEFF
You don't want to scare him off.
You've got his attention, now just
play with him. Tease him a little.

Kale and Jeff watch the water in anxious silence... Kale
inching the line back toward the boat. One more crank, then --
The BLACK BASS suddenly ATTACKS THE LURE with a tremendous
SLOSH OF HIS TAIL!
KALE
Holy shit!
JEFF
It's all you, Kale, keep cranking!
Kale cranks fast and furious.
But this is one fish that's
going down fighting.
KALE
I need reinforcements!
Jeff moves in, grabs the rod and reel from behind Kale.
JEFF
Heave, laddie!
They PULL.
The rod curls under the weight.
JEFF (CONT'D)
(pirate accent)
Give it all ya got, mate, or you're
gonna lose him!
KALE
(laughing; pulling;
struggling)
Dad, your pirate -- impersonation --
sucks!!
JEFF
How would ya know, have ya ever met
one? I doubt it --
The BASS SLOSHES FURIOUSLY around the bait, now just a few
feet from the boat!
KALE
He's freakin' pulling us in!
JEFF
(laughing)
Never! No Brecht has ever -- lost a
fight -- to a fish!
The BASS suddenly snaps free. The line goes limp. Jeff and
Kale lose their balance, nearly falling backward. Then --

All becomes silent save for Jeff and Kale's heavy breathing.
Kale winds the empty line back to the boat, shoots a glance
to Jeff, then throws the rod aside in mock disgust. Jeff
takes a seat in the captain's chair.
JEFF (CONT'D)
Throw me a --
Kale is already in the cooler. He throws Jeff a Coke.
Both
sit in silence for a beat. Then --
JEFF (CONT'D)
Hey, at least the weather's great...
we're spending quality time together.
KALE
(grabbing pole)
That fish is going down.
JEFF
(not missing a beat)
Let's nab the bastard.
They both cast their lines --

An amber glow sets the mountainside ablaze as Jeff's SUV
winds through the serpentine pass.

A couple of final, METAL-CRUNCHING FLIPS send the SUV's
undercarriage CRASHING to a violent stop on top of a rickety
wood beam-mounted GUARDRAIL.
A silent beat.
Then -- steam billows from the hood...

INSIDE THE SUV

Airbags deflate. Dust settles. Blood streams from Jeff's
hairline. His eyes flutter open.

He looks up to Kale, strapped in the passenger seat,
unconscious. A small gash on his forehead. We only see
blue sky through Kale's shattered passenger window.
JEFF
Kale?
-- Kale, are you okay?
Kale opens his eyes.
Jeff reaches up, touches Kale's face.
KALE
I think so.
Kale looks down at his dad -- his eyes widen in horror, not
only at the sight of Jeff, but of the ravine beneath them --
For this brief moment, we may have thought the SUV was stable.
But we CRANE BACK UP AND OUT KALE'S PASSENGER WINDOW to REVEAL
A MUCH GRIMMER REALITY: the SUV is PERCHED LENGTHWISE ON TOP
OF THE GUARDRAIL AT A 45-DEGREE DOWNWARD ANGLE.
The SUV's right front and rear tires precariously grip the
rail, keeping it from plunging 500 feet to the RAVINE below.

BACK INSIDE THE SUV

KALE
Oh my God, dad --
-- Jeff's leg is trapped beneath the crumpled dashboard.
JEFF
I'm fine. But you're gonna have to
climb out, Kale. Can you do that?
Kale's hands shake from the SHOCK as his fingers search for
the seatbelt buckle. But the shoulder strap is LOCKED IN
PLACE, preventing Kale from turning. He tugs it furiously.
KALE
I can't -- It won't give --
JEFF
That's okay, I've got it -- grab the
door, I don't need your ass falling
on my face --
Kale reaches up, grips the outside of the door as
JEFF'S HAND
shakily reaches to Kale's seatbelt buckle and presses. Kale's
belt SNAPS LOOSE. Kale's body DROPS, but he hangs on to the
window -- just as a
GUARDRAIL BEAM SNAPS LOOSE FROM ITS FOUNDATION!

slowly slides down the outside of the door, then turns around
on his chest, reaches his hand back down to Jeff --
KALE
Dad, here --
Jeff reaches up as a
SECTION OF GUARDRAIL RIVETS
a few inches behind the SUV's rear bumper suddenly POP LOOSE.
THE GUARDRAIL SNAPS IN TWO!
KALE SCREAMS, hangs on for dear life as the GUARDRAIL and
SUV SWING OUT AND OVER THE RAVINE.
The guardrail is buckling fast. Another beam RIPS FREE of
its foundation -- Kale slides a few more inches down the
door and right front fender allowing
HIS FEET
to find the edge of the foundering rail underneath.
Having
at least some footing, Kale reaches back inside --
KALE (CONT'D)
Dad, please, you can do it --
Jeff unbuckles his belt and reaches up. Kale summons his
strength, grabs Jeff's wrist, pulls him up and through the
passenger window just as the
SUV FALLS AWAY!
Jeff's weight pulls Kale down. Kale's feet SLIP off the
rail. Kale SLAMS chest down, his TORSO wrapping around the
top of the rail, feet dangling... But he's still clutching
Jeff's wrist as the SUV CRASHES INTO THE RAVINE IN A MUSHROOM
CLOUD OF DUST AND DEBRIS.
JEFF'S WRIST
slips from Kale's grasp. Kale struggles to hang on, but
he's losing the battle and the balancing act. And he knows
it. Tears well in Kale's eyes.

JEFF
(with a slight smile)
I know --
CU - Jeff's left hand enters frame, clasps Kale's. Another
beat of eyes on eyes. The guardrail continues to BUCKLE.
Then -- Jeff starts to PRY KALE'S HAND AWAY --
Jeff's arm RELEASES FROM KALE'S GRIP.
Kale opens his mouth
to scream as a shrill bell RINGS!

A few stray beams of sunlight pierce the blinds. Otherwise,
it's a tomb. Clothes strewn everywhere. We TRACK ACROSS
the floor and a virtual DEBRIS FIELD of junk food bags,
wrappers, Mountain Dew cans... find Kale in bed, ankle and
bracelet stick out from the sheets, arm hangs over the side --
19
34
Kale instinctively STOMPS ON IT with his SOCKED FEET!
KALE
Oh shit!
Shit water shit!
Kale frantically hops around, looking for a hose, bucket,
anything wet -- but the flames are already out. Kale looks
down, finally realizes this -- but there's another problem --
his socks are smothered in SLIMY DOG SHIT.
We hear GIGGLING O.S. Kale glances up as two neighborhood
BRATS on bikes emerge from their hiding place behind a shrub
across the street. They high five each other.
BRAT #1
What a retard!
Kale glares -- then heads down the steps into...
D.J. Caruso

Kale walks briskly, menacingly toward them --
KALE
You think that's funny?
The Brats grow more concerned, back away as Kale draws closer--
BRAT #2
What are you gonna do, kill us like
your teacher?
KALE CHARGES THEM!
KALE
Not before I shove this shit up your
ass!
The brats pedal away. Kale races through the sprinkler,
crossing his yard into the far corner of Ashley's, trying to
cut the Brats off as they race down...
36
36
The chase is on.
Kale increases his speed.
Almost catching
up to them --
BRAT #2
(terrified to Brat #1)
Dude, you said he couldn't leave his
house!!
Kale overhears, stops cold.
He glances to the ANKLE BRACELET:
FLASHING RED LIGHT.
KALE
Shit!
Kale races back down the street, his shit-stained feet leaving
tracks as he goes. He cuts through Ashley's yard again,
yelling at the bracelet all the way--
KALE (CONT'D)
Turn green turn green turn green...
Kale races by ASHLEY'S PARENTS, leaps back into...
He looks at the bracelet. Still FLASHING RED. He hops up
and down as the SPRINKLER STREAMS approach him from behind.
KALE (CONT'D)
No, c'mon, I'm way inside, turn green --

He spins back toward the house, runs SMACK into the STREAMS,
trips on the sprinkler, falls on his face. Now his foot's
tangled in the sprinkler. Spraying water all over him.
Kale's foot jiggles the sprinkler free. He then sees the
ankle bracelet: GREEN LIGHT.
KALE (CONT'D)
Yes!
That's what I'm talking about!
He gazes over: ASHLEY'S PARENTS, EACH WITH A MOVING BOX,
STAND THERE, JAWS DROPPED. BOTH TAKE A NERVOUS STEP BACKWARD
as ASHLEY steps out the front door. Freezes at the sight of
the sopping wet, shit-and-grass-stained Kale. Kale locks
eyes with her. Then smiles and waves.
KALE (CONT'D)
It's cool, I'm all green.
Then -- SIRENS WAIL. Kale turns to the street: TWO POLICE
CARS SCREECH TO A STOP. Kale loses the smile.
PARKER (V.O.)
(phone filter prelap)
Kale, calm down, the officers were
probably in the neighborhood already.
37
39
ON KALE'S FEET - entering frame, inching their way through
the yard...
ON THE BRACELET - The green light suddenly goes out, red
light FLASHES. Kale's foot quickly steps back. GREEN LIGHT.
A beat, then --
A SMILING GARDEN GNOME SLAMS DOWN INTO FRAME.
WIDER - Kale ties kite string around the gnome's hat, then
unspools it across the yard to a waiting croquet mallet
already hammered into the ground. He pulls the string taut
and ties it off.
We PULL BACK to REVEAL Kale's emerging KITE STRING PERIMETER --
a crude SEMI-CIRCULAR ARC around the yard tied off at
different points using makeshift "stakes" -- gnomes, mallets,
shovels, screwdrivers...
40
40
Same "BOUNDARY CONSTRUCTION" here. Kale shoves a screwdriver
into the ground a few feet shy of his mailbox. He ties some
string to it as he glances over to the other neighbors' (the
PILCH's) yard, sees their black Labra-doodle watching him.
KALE
Hey doggie, come here...
The dog trots toward Kale. It almost reaches his outstretched
hand when it suddenly gets ZAPPED by the underground electric
fence. It YELPS away. Spins back around, sits and stares.
KALE (CONT'D)
(re: his ankle bracelet)
Hey, you and me both.
OVER KALE'S SHOULDER IN THE B.G. - ASHLEY
lifts more boxes from the back of their station wagon. She
sets them on the drive, SLAMS the liftgate. Kale turns
around. Ashley throws him a quick glance, then heads around
the back of her house. Kale stares after her.

ON KALE - now clean-shaven, sitting on the front steps. He
eyes his watch, then stretches his neck. Yawns. Then he
sees something O.S.

KALE'S POV - peering down the street, Ashley's stationwagon
rounds the corner --
Kale hops to his feet, quickly fixes his hair as the
stationwagon draws closer.
Kale casually strides into the yard, approaching the kite
string boundary and mailbox. Then -- keeping his feet planted
in what looks to be a very practiced maneuver, he suddenly
falls forward against the mailbox. Reaches around with his
free hand, opens the door, going to grab the mail inside
just as
ASHLEY
pulls the car into and up the drive.
She glances at Kale
who nods and smiles back.
As the stationwagon heads up the driveway, Kale tries to
push himself upright -- but his feet SLIP. He pitches forward
more. He glances back over his shoulder, sees Ashley getting
out of the car and looking his way. Kale struggles under
his own weight, trying to keep his feet from crossing the
line -- he looks back to Ashley who's now heading toward
him. A slight smile crosses Kale's face as --
ASHLEY
Can I help you?
KALE
Nope, no I'm fine.
ASHLEY
(helping him up)
Too late.
KALE
Thanks, that was really humiliating.
Ashley reaches in the box, grabs the mail, hands it over.
ASHLEY
Please. I think any pride you had
left was gone a while ago.
KALE
Oh, you mean that thing with the
cops? They had the wrong guy, total
foul up. I'm Kale by the way.
Ashley nods with a semi-polite smile, starts to head away --
KALE (CONT'D)
Hey, so -- how'd the move go?

ASHLEY
Still going.
KALE
I'd help, but...
(re: ankle bracelet)
I'm a little spatially challenged at
the moment.
Ashley walks closer to Kale, checks out his ankle bracelet.
ASHLEY
Yeah, you've kinda got the whole
Martha Stewart thing going on --
KALE
(nodding)
But minus the 48-hour allowance for
office visits. And no lame
"Apprentice" spin-off.
(off her laugh)
So where'd you move from?
ASHLEY
I'm a city girl. Born, raised, and
now...
(glances around; sighs)
Forcefully relocated.
KALE
That doesn't sound good.
ASHLEY
I'm telling you, if I have another
clueless jock hit on me or one more
soccer mom cuts me off in her oversize
SUV, I'm gonna go postal.
KALE
Oh, sorry, I was just gonna see if
you wanted to hop in my Hummer and
cruise to a kegger.
(turning away)
Nice talking to you.
ASHLEY

ASHLEY

Oh, I'm Ashley --
KALE
Noticed that, too.
Ashley smiles, disappears inside.
Kale's in love.

ON KALE - sitting in the leather chair, binoculars raised.
On the floor next to the chair is a 7-11 bag, a slurpee cup,
a bag of beef jerky and an AUTOMOTIVE MAGAZINE with a MUSTANG
on the cover.
BINOCULAR POV - Ashley sits on the roof leaning against her
closed window. She's reading Lolita.
RONNIE (O.S.)
So you don't know what year the
Mustang is?
REVEAL RONNIE - sitting at dad's computer looking at the
FBI'S OFFICIAL WEBSITE.
KALE
(now flipping through
magazine)
'65 or '66, couldn't tell.
RONNIE
Check this out. The feds think your
missing girl might be related to
three murders in Austin. All
redheads.
Kale processes that as we suddenly hear a car door SLAM O.S.

Ronnie joins Kale at the window.
THEIR POV - Ashley flips her sandals off one at a time, pulls
her tank off revealing her bronzed back and bikini top.
RONNIE
Dude...
Ashley slinks out of her shorts revealing a "near-thong"
bikini this time.
RONNIE (CONT'D)
DUDE!!
KALE
(re: bikini)
That's definitely new.
Ashley crouches down, runs her fingers through the water.
RONNIE
Oh, it's so warm, baby...
Ashley cups her hands, scoops a handful of water from the
pool, splashes her face... runs her hands through her hair...
She stands, takes a deep breath, holds it -- then exhales...
RONNIE (CONT'D)
Cleansing breath...
Ashley stretches her arms high above her head.
RONNIE (CONT'D)
Concentrate now. This is for the
gold.
Ronnie grabs the binoculars from Kale, puts them to his eyes,
moves closer to the window -- but his zoomed-in vision causes
him to underestimate the distance -- THWUMP. The end of the
binoculars HIT THE WINDOW just as Ashley dives into the pool --
Ronnie and Kale hit the deck as we hear the splash O.S.
KALE
Jackass!

Dude, there's no way she heard that.

BINOCULAR POV - Ashley's underwater at the far end of the
pool. She tucks and pushes off the wall, swims back...
RONNIE
(peering out)
She's got great lung capacity.
ON ASHLEY - She suddenly surfaces, hoists herself from the
water. She spins and sits on the ledge, rings the water
from her hair. But she suddenly stops -- and shifts her
GAZE UP toward Kale and Ronnie!
KALE
(pulling Ronnie down)
I think she saw me --
RONNIE
There's no way --
Ronnie grabs the binoculars back.
RONNIE (CONT'D)
(re: Ashley O.S.)
Okay, maybe she did.
KALE
Seriously?
Kale peeks out --

top. She heads to the back door, tries the knob. Locked.
Over this, Ronnie turns to Kale:
RONNIE
Her swims always that short?

No, she usually takes her time --

Ashley smiles. They suddenly hear VOICES O.S.
Kale and
Ashley glance over to Giles' house.

Giles
is right behind her.
Ashley grabs Kale's arm and pulls him behind a shrub on his
side of the boundary.
They peek back over to Giles'.

audible voices of Giles and the WOMAN. Talking SERIOUSLY
about something --

woman -- Ashley shifts her head, straining to listen --
GILES
You really should stay.
WOMAN
I just don't think it's a good idea --

more frustrated)
Where the hell are they?
The woman suddenly drops her purse.
The CONTENTS spill onto

Suddenly, the woman's CAR KEYS WHACK the other side of the
fence, then PLOP DOWN underneath it just a couple of feet
from Ashley's position!
ON ASHLEY - she startles, looks over, sees the keys.

Kale tries to get Ashley's attention, but she's not looking --

CLOSER - ASHLEY'S FINGERTIPS barely TOUCH them when --
GILES' HAND - suddenly SWOOPS IN from O.S., BRUSHES ASHLEY'S
FINGERS just before grabbing the keys and swiping them back
to his side!
Somehow Ashley keeps herself from screaming as she YANKS HER
HAND BACK, PRESSES HERSELF AGAINST THE FENCE. She puts her
hand over her mouth to silence her own breathing --
KALE'S POV - Giles stands frozen in the shadows behind Ashley.
WITH ASHLEY - She slowly turns her head, sees Giles through
one of the cracks -- STANDING RIGHT THERE.
Ashley starts to slowly SLIIIDE away... when suddenly -- a
TWIG SNAPS under her foot! Ashley FREEZES. She peers back
through the nearest crack.
ASHLEY'S POV - searching for Giles -- doesn't see him --
Ashley presses herself even harder against the fence as we...
TILT UP AND PAN OVER TO REVEAL GILES - peering over the fence.
We can only hope it's tall enough to keep him from looking
down and seeing Ashley.
WITH KALE - He's seeing it all.
ON GILES - He raises up, standing on his tip toes to get a
better look down. Shifting his head back and forth.

It's even darker on this side. No lights on in Giles' house.
Kale cautiously rounds the side, approaches the front door --

last week, he killed maybe three
others, all redheads, they could be
in a bag -- a big blue plastic bag --
in his garage -- my friend knew this --
(re: Giles)
That's why he's covering -- he didn't
just wake up five minutes ago --
Uniform #1 looks concerned as he steps away from Kale.
UNIFORM #1
(to Uniform #3; re:
Kale)
Can you --
Uniform #3 nods as Uniform #1 heads back up to Giles and
Uniform #2.
KALE'S POV - Uniform #1 whispers something to Uniform #2.
They turn back to Giles.
UNIFORM #2
Sir, do you mind if we take a look
inside?
A beat. A couple more police cruisers roll to a stop.
Curious NEIGHBORS are now gathering across the street.
GILES
Absolutely, be my guest.
Giles ushers them through the door and follows them into the
house. Giles turns, shoots a quick glance to Kale before
closing the door.
ON KALE - all he can do is wait. He shifts his gaze to the
gathering neighbors. A few lock eyes with him, shake their
heads. Kale turns back toward the house...
TIME CUT TO:

ON THE GARAGE DOOR - as it slowly raises up.
WIDER - The uniforms, standing with Kale, wait as the door
opens all the way.

A light comes on inside. Giles and Uniform #1 come out the
inner garage door as Uniform #2 Giles drags the BLUE BAG out
from the garage.
Sure enough, there's blood smears and visible strands of
matted hair near the top. Uniform #2 unties the bag, pulls
the sides away. Everyone gathers around, peers inside, then
suddenly yank themselves back at the horrible STENCH emanating
from within.
Kale eyes Uniform #1 who gestures him to look.
Kale steps
toward the bag.
KALE'S POV - We peer into the bag to reveal the WIDE OPEN
eyes of a dead -- DEER.
GILES
(to the cops)
I hit it the other night. Thought
I'd save a few steps and get it off
the road myself. I was gonna bury
it sooner, but it's been a helluva
week --
KALE
So why'd you have to have the car
fixed in record time, huh? Because
it was covered in her blood --
GILES
(talking over him;
re: Mustang)
Because it's a classic, I got it out
of storage for the auto show, I needed
it in pristine condition.
UNIFORM #2
It's one of the biggest in the world.
(off Uniform #1)
The auto show.
All eyes on Kale.
He slumps.
Giles has an answer for
everything.
UNIFORM #1
I think we're done here.
Sorry for
the intrusion, sir.
GILES
Please, I understand.
As the Uniforms lead Kale back down the driveway...

KALE
(quietly; drained)
So where's my friend, then? Can
anyone tell me that? Does anyone
believe me?!
Kale looks over, sees PARKER, standing with JULIE whose eyes
are filled with it all: anger, concern, sadness...
JULIE
Kale, come on --
Kale turns back to Giles' house. Sees lights being turned
out inside. As Kale shifts his gaze forward, he locks eyes
with ASHLEY standing in the crowd of neighbors. She watches
him with concern. Kale turns away, drops his head as the
cops, Parker and Julie lead him away... a FLASH OF LIGHTNING
in the distance...

Kale bolts out the door, but trips on a well-placed garden
gnome on the steps. Giles or the brats must have put it
there. Regardless, it slows Kale down. He staggers into
the yard, SCREAMING for anyone to hear. But the WIND and
THUNDER drown him out as
GILES
-- Now right behind him -- swings the bat and trips Kale up.
Kale falls just short of his kite string boundary line.

Like a quarterback pressing to the goal line, Kale lunges
forward, but --
GILES' HAND suddenly grab's KALE'S ANKLE just as the ANKLE
BRACELET is about to cross the line.
Kale screams, digs his hands into the earth, trying to pull
himself forward, but Giles is too strong. He DRAGS Kale
backward, then PINS him to the ground, pulls out a roll of
duct tape, quickly and efficiently wraps some around Kale's
mouth, hands and ankles.
Giles yanks Kale up, throws him over his shoulder and heads
back toward Kale's house.

Kale raises the bat, swings it at the 2nd floor hallway window
that separates the interior of the house from the porch.
The window SHATTERS. Kale tosses the bat back to Ashley.
KALE
(to Giles O.S.)
We're out here, asshole!
There's a lull in the thunder. All becomes eerily quiet for
a beat as Kale waits for Giles to appear at the window. He
glances back at Ashley who ducks behind the wall inside dad's
office -- she glances to the office door. No more BANGING.
She shrugs to Kale: "where is he?"
Another beat, then suddenly -- a FLASH OF LIGHTNING reveals
GILES
Standing in the other porch doorway BEHIND KALE!
ASHLEY
Kale!
Kale whirls around just as Giles reaches out, grabs him by
the throat, pulls him off his feet and HURLS KALE through
the shattered window into the hallway!
ASHLEY (CONT'D)
NO!
You son of a --
Ashley charges out onto the porch with the bat. Swings it
at Giles who promptly RIPS it from her hand and hurls it off
the porch. Ashley whips out the letter opener, spins around,
about to stab Giles, but he backhands her. Ashley falls,
SMACKS her head on the porch railing.

She drops to the floor, half conscious as Giles picks up the
letter opener, turns his attention back to the 2nd floor
hallway window --
HIS POV - THE HALLWAY - KALE'S GONE.
WHIP PAN to behind Giles -- REVEAL KALE - CHARGING OUT the
same porch door Giles just came out! Kale uses his FULL
BODY WEIGHT to SHOVE Giles back through the SAME BROKEN WINDOW
and into the hallway!
KALE
Ashley!
Are you okay?
ASHLEY
I wanna kill him --
KALE
Stick to the plan --
Over this, Kale pulls Ashley to her feet. They share a smile
as Ashley ducks into the porch door leading to Kale's room.
Kale turns back --
KALE'S POV - A BLOODY GILES
Gets to his feet and heads toward the window.
Kale turns
for the ladder, starts climbing up.
Giles pursues, steps out the window as we see Ashley, in the
b.g., appear from Kale's bedroom and race for the stairs!

Kale reaches the top of the ladder, steps onto the roof, but
Giles, from below, HEAVES THE LADDER UPWARD, tripping Kale.
Kale SLAMS down on the roof, smacks the back of his head.
KALE'S BLURRY POV - against a fury of lightning flashes,
Giles races up the ladder and steps onto the roof. Stalks
toward Kale.
Kale gets to his feet, draws the racketball racket from his
shorts, takes out the ball, assumes a professional looking
serving position and WHAM! Kale beams the ball at Giles --
and misses completely.
KALE
That was a warning!
Giles rushes Kale who wails on him with the racket. Giles
ducks, spins around, brings his fist up and punches Kale in
the chest.

Kale drops the racket. It slides away down the roof as Kale
doubles over. But Giles grabs Kale before he can fall. He
pulls Kale up off his feet, pulls him closer, gets in his
face. Kale summons some strength, tilts his head up and
HEADBUTTS GILES.
Giles stumbles back, pulling Kale with him. Giles SLAMS
down on the roof. He and Kale roll down the incline and
stop just short of the edge --
Kale looks over, spots his STEREO SPEAKER a few feet away.

109
Kale HURLS the speaker at Giles', SMACKING him hard.
Giles
shakes it off, grabs the speaker wire --
WITH KALE - he gets to his feet, heads back up the roof as
Giles suddenly whips out the letter opener and hurls it like
a THROWING KNIFE at Kale.
The letter opener embeds itself in the back of Kale's thigh.
Kale screams, falls to his knees.
CU - Kale cringes from the pain as Giles, now right behind
him, wraps the SPEAKER WIRE around Kale's NECK and pulls.
Kale grabs for it as Giles chokes the life out of him. Kale
only has one chance. He reaches behind his leg, grabs the
embedded letter opener, RIPS it away, twirls it in his hand
and shoves it back into Giles' stomach!
Giles recoils as Kale flings himself away from the choke-
hold, falls back to the roof, rolls down and PLUMMETS to --

Kale hits HARD, the wind knocked out of him. He looks over,
sees his racketball racket lying there. He grabs it, looks
back up.

KALE'S POV - Giles stands on the upper roof, smiles as he
brings up the letter opener.
Kale's eyes widen. He pulls himself to his feet, and sidearms
the racket up at Giles. The racket spins through the air
like a boomerang and miraculously smacks Giles in the hand,
knocking the letter opener away!
WITH KALE - he whirls around, races toward the edge of the
roof... and JUMPS.
ANGLE: FOLLOWING BEHIND KALE IN MID AIR, WE CRANE UP AND
OVER HIM PEERING DOWN TO REVEAL ASHLEY'S POOL!
ON THE ANKLE BRACELET - it FLASHES RED.
Kale drops into the pool with a tremendous SPLASH!
He pulls
himself to the surface, peers up --
KALE'S POV - the roof -- Giles is gone.
Kale frantically swims to the edge, pulls himself out --
