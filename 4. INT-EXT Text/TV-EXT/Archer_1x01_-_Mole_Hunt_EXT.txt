    A nondescript storefront laundry, which takes up the ground 
  floor of an equally nondescript Midtown office building.


    Outside the corner office, CHERYL - 26, very pretty - types 
  on her computer while trying, unsuccessfully, not to cry.  She
  looks up in surprise to see Archer standing at her tidy desk.

                                      ARCHER (O.S.)
                    No, you're so ugly when you cry...

                                      CHERYL
                    [gasps, then] Mr. Archer!

                                      ARCHER
                    I'm fine, is she in, or out eating a
                    baby?

                                      CHERYL
                    You stood me up again last night!

                                      ARCHER
                    Last--?  Yeah, what happened was, did
                    you see "Brian's Song?"  Same thing,
                    pretty much happened.  I helped a guy
                    with cancer.  Look, I'm sorry, Carol.

                                      CHERYL
                    [gasps, then] It's Cheryl.

                                      ARCHER
                    I know, Ca -- Cheryl.  So to make it
                    up to you...

                                      CHERYL
                      [cleansing breath, then] I'm ready.

                                      ARCHER
                    Could you buzz me in.

                                      CHERYL
                    Is that all you have to say?!

                                      ARCHER
                    Yes?


  We are MID-SHOT on Archer, who addresses camera: determined.

                                      ARCHER
                    So here's the thing: I need to access
                    my operations account, and you're
                      preventing that.  Now we can do this
                    easy, or we can do it hard.
                          (raises gun)
                    Your call.  No?  Hard it is, then!

    Archer points his GUN at camera, and... PHUT PHUT PHUT PHUT! 
  just about empties his entire clip.  During which we reveal
  that he is actually shooting at THE BULLETPROOF MAINFRAME DOOR.

    Bullets go ricocheting off in every direction, and we hear:

                                      DRONE AGENT (O.S.)
                    Agh!  Jesus Christ, Archer!

    Archer stops firing, looks off-screen, almost embarrassed.

                                      ARCHER
                    Ooh, sorry!  I forgot that the --
                    did I get you?

                                      DRONE AGENT (O.S.)
                    What the is wrong with you?!

                                      ARCHER
                    Me?  Nothing!  You, on the other
                    hand... have a bullet inside you!

                                      CRENSHAW (O.S.)

                    I see the foot's all better...

    Archer turns to find Crenshaw, gloating over his coffee mug.

                                      ARCHER
                    And I see you're still a hatchet-
                    faced prick.  So...

                                      CRENSHAW
                    Mmm.  Do you see that sign?

                                      ARCHER
                    Uh, do you see that sign?

    REVEAL: a SIGN reading "NO FOOD OR DRINK IN THIS AREA"              Duchess - Pilot Episode ("Mole Hunt")  REVISED RECORDING SCRIPT 3/30/09   17

                                      CRENSHAW
                    Well --

    SMACK!  Archer SMACKS Crenshaw's COFFEE out of his hands.

                                      ARCHER
                    That's why.  So we don't get ants.

  As Crenshaw puzzles this, Archer shoots his cuffs and exits.


    Cyril, holding a TAKE-OUT BAG (from WRAPSODY IN BLUE), speaks
  into an INTERCOM on the wall next to the ISIS mainframe DOOR.

                                      FIGGIS
                          (overly enunciated)
                    Cyril.  Figgis.


  That same Michael Bay-esque shot of the ISIS headquarters, the
  night skyline of Manhattan illuminated in the background.

                                      ARCHER (O.S.)

                    So thanks for nothing, Carol.  Now I
                    have to break into ISIS headquarters,
                    in a nine hundred dollar turtleneck.


    Archer, in all black, aims his large GRAPPLING HOOK GUN.

                                      ARCHER

                    And if it gets ruined?  I'll make 
                    you drink heavy cream, you... Carol!  

    SHOONK!  He FIRES the hook.  As it THUNKS home, we CUT TO:


    Archer is at the door, a black DUFFEL BAG over his shoulder.

                                      ARCHER
                    Wow, that was actually pretty easy. 
                    Thanks, new turtleneck --

    RRRIIP!  He shrugs off the DUFFEL BAG, which rips his sleeve.

                                      ARCHER
                    Oh for -- and thank you, duffel bag!
                    Jesus, what else could go wrong...?


                                      FIGGIS
                    And here we are.  All fine.

                                    LANA
                    Cyril, please don't be --

    BRRRRRRRT!  Cyril's PHONE rings.  He finds it, raises it.

                                      FIGGIS
                    Oop!  Now who's a naughty Nelly?
                          (into phone)
                    Yes, hello?

                                      ARCHER (O.S.)
                    Hi, who's this?

                                      FIGGIS
                          (overly enunciated)
                    Cyril.  Figgis.              Duchess - Pilot Episode ("Mole Hunt")  REVISED RECORDING SCRIPT 3/30/09   29


    Archer stands at the mainframe INTERCOM, holding his PHONE.

                                      ARCHER
                    I'm sorry, did you say Faggis?

                                      FIGGIS (on phone)
                    No, Figgis.  


    Malory, straight from bed and hurriedly dressed, stands with
  Cyril on the sidewalk in front of the breached laundry door.

                                      MALORY
                    So why are you sitting down here in
                    the car, eating... stir-fry?!

                                      FIGGIS
                    It's Stir-Friday.  And Lana said to.

    Crenshaw lurches out of the laundry, shocked to see them.

                                      MALORY
                    Crenshaw?

                                      CRENSHAW
                    Ms. Archer?!

                                      MALORY
                    What's this flap about a break-in?!

                                      CRENSHAW

                    Uh --

    Archer and Lana lurch out of the laundry, GUNS drawn.

                                      ARCHER

                    Mother, look out!  Crenshaw's a mole!

                                      MALORY

                    Oh, Pam's as full of crap as she is
                    of... carbohydrates.  Now -- rrrk!              Duchess - Pilot Episode ("Mole Hunt")  REVISED RECORDING SCRIPT 3/30/09   35

    Crenshaw grabs Malory from behind, puts his GUN to her head.

                                      CRENSHAW

                    Not this time, you impossible bitch! 
                    Also, you should all be nicer to Pam.

                                    LANA

                    I am always nice to her!

                                      FIGGIS

                    To her face...

                                    LANA

                    Why aren't you in the car?

                                      MALORY

                          (being choked)

                    Rrk!  Will somebody... do something?!

    Archer GRABS Lana from behind, puts his GUN to her head.

                                    LANA
                    ["just got grabbed" sort of noise]

                                      EVERYBODY
                    Archer?!  What're you doing?!  Etc!

                                    LANA
                    What're you doing, you idiot!

                                      ARCHER
                          (low, to Lana)
                    Shut up!  It's classic misdirection.
                          (to Crenshaw)
                    Looks like we've got a Mexican
                    standoff, Kremensky!

                                      CRENSHAW
                    Wh--?  How is this a Mexican standoff?

                                      ARCHER
                    Ummm...

                                      CRENSHAW
                    I don't care if you shoot her!

                                      ARCHER
                    Oh.              Duchess - Pilot Episode ("Mole Hunt")  REVISED RECORDING SCRIPT 3/30/09   36

                                    LANA
                    Idiot.

                                      FIGGIS
                    I do!

                                      CRENSHAW
                          (cocks pistol)
                    But what if I shoot her, mama's boy?

    Archer cocks a mildly intrigued eyebrow at the prospect...

                                      MALORY
                          (still being choked)
                      Sterling...?  Sterling!

                                      CRENSHAW
                    Yes, picture her dead in the gutter,
                    and what your pathetic life will be
                    like without old mommie dearest...

                                    LANA
                    Oh, for -- Jesus Christ!

                                      EVERYBODY
                    What?!  Huh?  Etc.

                                    LANA
                    He's got an erection!

    Malory, aghast and furious, rips away from Crenshaw's grasp.

                                      MALORY
                    What?!

                                      CRENSHAW
                    -- the hell is wrong with you peopl --

  BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM!  Four quick shots rip into Crenshaw's
    chest, sending his body flying off-screen, away from Malory.

                                      EVERYBODY
                    Gasp!  Ack!  What the--?!  Etc!

    REVEAL: smoke wisps out of Archer's raised GUN.

                                      ARCHER
                          (overly cool)
                    Adios, amigo... ow!  Ow!  Hey!

    WHACK!  WHACK!  Malory starts bashing Archer with her PURSE.

                                      MALORY
                    An erection?!              Duchess - Pilot Episode ("Mole Hunt")  REVISED RECORDING SCRIPT 3/30/09   37

                                      ARCHER
                    Ow!  What is in there, buckles?!

                                      MALORY
                    The thought of me dead gives you an
                      erection?!

                                      ARCHER
                    No, just half of one!  The other
                    half... would've really missed you.

                                      MALORY
                    [sound of utter contempt]

    Malory turns on her heel and storms into the laundry, past
    Crenshaw's corpse, lying in a crumpled heap on the ground.

                                      ARCHER
