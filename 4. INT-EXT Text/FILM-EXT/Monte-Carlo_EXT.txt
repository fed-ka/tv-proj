Alice, a heavy bag slung over her shoulder, and her boyfriend
RICHARD (30's, scruffily handsome in sweats and a coach's
jersey), carrying three binders and a bag of baseball bats,
exit the school among a crush of students.
Together, they cross a lawn dotted with patches of late snow,
to the parking lot, stopping at Alice's weathered Volvo where
Richard hands over the binders with a kiss.
RICHARD
Got practice until five thirty,
then I'll be by.
ALICE
I'll see you then. Thanks.
They kiss again and Richard takes off for the athletic
fields, passing Meg as she comes from the school, waves.
RICHARD
Hey, Meg! Bon voyage!
Alice offers a binder to Meg as she arrives at Alice's car.
ALICE
I finished our travel binders!
Meg takes the binder, looks it over.
MEG
Remind me again why we're taking
phonebooks to France?
Alice gives her a look.
MEG (CONT'D)
I love my binder. I do.
ALICE
Where's Emma? She knows we're
meeting, right?
MEG
Forgot her purse.

MEG (CONT'D)
You know, for the first time in a
long time, I feel just as lucky as
any of these kids. They may have
their whole lives ahead of them but
we've got a week in Paris.
ALICE
Oh, that's right. I keep
forgetting your life is completely
over. So sad. I'm really going to
miss you.
MEG
Funny.
EMMA
Well, that was a close call!
They turn to see Emma. crossing the parking lot holding a
quality knock-off designer handbag over her head.
MEG
Look at her. The only teacher in
Racine County that wears four inch
heels in six feet of snow.
ALICE
She always looks great, doesn't
she?
ME G
(WITH AFFECTION)
Damn her.
EMMA
(ARRIVES)
My passport was in here!
MEG
Where'd you find it?
EMMA
Second floor girl's bathroom.

Ooh, binders! Great!
Alice passes one to Emma.

ALICE
Emma, we're a team.
EMMA
I'd just be sitting around the
condo, trolling e-Harmony...
MEG
The fact that you have trouble
finding a date--
EMMA
I'm telling you, it's this town!
MEG
Gives me less than no hope.
EMMA
You know what we should do, Meg?
When we're over there? we should
all treat ourselves. Find a real
salon. Total spa treatment. And
I'm gonna get my hair done. Just
like this!
She holds up a European tabloid she's pulled from her purse,
stabbing a finger at a photograph: CORDELIA WINTHROP SCOTT
(30's), a blonde heiress deflecting paparazzi in couture.
NOTE: EMMA and CORDELIA are Played by the same actress.
ALICE
Look at us.
Meg and Emma turn to Alice, smiling.
ALICE (CONT'D)
(MARVELLING)
We're really going.
GLENN (30s), in a police uniform, watches Meg squeeze her
children tightly.
MEG
(TO SEAMUS)
Remember. Gameboy goes to bed when
you do. Nine o'clock.
GLENN
Seam, why don't you take your

Can we get on the radio?
MEG GLENN
No. No.
Meg watches her kids run to the squad car parked at the curb,
just as KARYN (30's, also in uniform) emerges on the
passenger side to meet them.
GLENN
And no lights!
KARYN
Hey, Meg!
Meg lifts her chin in greeting, but that's it.
GLENN
I uh... I heard from my lawyer.
She said you'd signed your papers.
Meg watches her kids climb in the car with Karyn.
GLENN (CONT'D)
Guess that makes us official, then.
MEG
You and me?
(a nod to the car)
Or...
GLENN
You and me, Meg.
A beat as they look at one another, hold.
SEAMUS
Mom!
Seamus reappears, charging up the walk to pull Meg down to
his level, hugging her.
SEAMUS (CONT'D)
Have fun.
Alice opens the door, kissing Richard who holds up a suitcase
in one hand, a bottle of champagne in the other.
RICHARD
Special delivery.
Alice emerges with Meg and Emma, each struggling with their
luggage, onto the thronged arrivals deck.
EMMA
There it is! Esprit de Corps!
Alice looks to where Emma points, seeing a small sky-blue
flag at the end of a long staff held by MADAME VALERY (40s,
pinched) their harried tour guide in a suit of the same blue.
ALICE
Excuse me, are you Madame Valery?
0
Madame Valery glances up from her clipboard beside their bus.
ALICE (CONT'D)
Hi, my name is Alice Perry--
MADAME VALERY
(GESTURING)
Bags go under the bus.
ALICE
I'm traveling with my friends, Meg
Kelly and Emma Lindgard--
MADAME VALERY

I speak English.

ALICE (CONT'D)
Now, I was hoping you could tell me
which route the bus will be taking--
MADAME VALERY
(WEARILY PREDICTIVE)
You're not going to be a problem,
are you?
The battered Esprits de Corps Tours bus careens through the
streets, listing wildly from side to side.
The bus hurtles around the drive, screeching to a halt,
bouncing roughly on its shocks at the museum's entrance.
Esprit de Corps tour members disembark from their bus in
front of a comically narrow and vertical Baroque hotel with
its name in feeble buzzing neon: Le Petit Sommeil.
ALICE (PRE-LAP)
Look! Look at this picture and
tell me what's different!
Madame Valery leads a diminished flock, bobbing her staff
with its blue flag, in a forced march across the span of the
ornate pedestrian bridge toward the waiting tour bus.

MADAME VALERY
The Pont des Arts has it's name for
the vast number of art students
that come here to paint this famous
city view...
Meg and Emma, the worse for wear, trail Madame Valery at a
distance with Alice who now leads her own handful of tour
members, Carl and Deedee among them.
ALICE
It's called the Pont des Arts
because the Louvre was formally
known as the Palais des Arts...
Madame Valery stops ahead, turning back to take in Alice and
her cluster of appreciative followers.
MADAME VALERY
People! We must keep together!
Alice's group circles an inscribed stone medallion with a
star-shaped brass inset on the pavement outside Notre Dame.
DEEDEE
"Point zero. Dez roots dee France."
ALICE
It's from right here that all the
highway miles in all of France are
measured. They also say that if
you stand on this exact spot, you
are be destined to return to France
in the future.
MEG
Oh, I'm in! Come on. Everyone!
Together, they all step forward, arms entwined, laughing.
EMMA
I want a picture! Of all of us!
Alice looks up as Emma breaks away, to see Madam Valery
leading her dwindling group from the great church.
Madame Valery sends her charges to the bus, then heads
straight for Alice as Emma tries to enlist a JAPANESE COUPLE
to take a group photo with her camera.

I'm sorry. I was explaining about

Madame Valery sizes Alice up and taps her staff as the group
forms around them, joined by the Japanese couple.
MADAME VALERY
This flag? I do not carry it for
my pleasure.
ALICE
We were just on our way inside--
MADAME VALERY
Well, now you may head to the bus.
ALICE
But, we haven't been--
MADAME VALERY
Which is why you must follow my
flag!
ALICE
okay. We will. I promise. But,
these people haven't seen the
CATHEDRAL---
MADAME VALERY
There are many churches on the
tour.
ALICE
But, this is Notre Dame! They need
to see this--
MADAME VALERY
I assure you, they will see
everything they need to see--

The Japanese wife frames the action with Emma's camera.
ALICE
I might not have ever been here
before, but...
(EMOTIONAL)
I've waited my whole life for this
trip.
CARL
We've waited thirty years--
MEG
You tell her, Carl.
ALICE
You keep rushing us through, like
this is some kind of race--
(REALLY HURT)
And you won't even speak French
with me.
(SGUARES HERSELF)
Now, I think I've been very nice.
We're from Wisconsin. But, I'm
telling you, I am not getting on
that bus until my friends and I
have seen Notre Dame.
Meg and Emma exchange looks as Alice plants herself with
folded arms and steely resolve before Madame Valery.
MADAME VALERY
Perhaps, if Madame is not satisfied
with my tour she could conduct her
own.
EMMA
What'd she say?
Alice's eyes narrow in regarding Madame Valery and all fall
silent a beat; a crowd anticipating fireworks.
CLICK! The Japanese wife snaps a picture of the standoff,
the sound of the shutter triggering Alice to action.

With lightning speed, she seizes Madame Valery's flag.
CROWD
Whoa!
Madame Valery, nonplussed, reaches out to reclaim her flag,
but Alice jerks it further away, while the Japanese woman
snaps picture after picture.
DEEDEE
Carl, we're getting on the bus!
Madame Valery lunges for the stick.
The bus pulls away, revealing the Japanese couple who return
Emma's camera with a bow, Meg, and Alice holding the flag.
EMMA
That was fantastic!
MEG
"A" plus!
Alice, cheeks flushed, watches Carl waving goodbye from the
0
bus's rear window.
MEG (CONT'D)
Alice, you okay?
Alice brings the staff down across her knee, snapping it in
two, casting the broken ends into the gutter as she raises
herself to her full height.
ALICE
Now, the real tour can begin!
MEG
Let's kick this town's ass!
Alice marches forward as a few drops of rain fall.
EMMA
I think it's starting to rain--
ALICE
Who cares? We're in Paris! What's
a little rain?

Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 23.
Water pours in sheets from the sky as Alice, Meg and Emma
splash down the Rue de Rivoli and duck beneath the shelter of
the hotel's canopy.
They shake water from their arms and hair, pluck at their
sopping clothes.
PHOTOGRAPHER 1
Cordelia!
They glance over at a few PAPARAZZI sharing the protection of
the overhang on the far side of the entrance, as a camera
flashes in taking Emma's picture.
Emma smiles, blinks, confused as another photographer
admonishes the first.
PHOTOGRAPHER 2
You're wasting your film. That's
not her.
EMMA
What're they saying?
Alice looks about in equal confusion, but stops short when
she sees the opulent restaurant behind the window's glass.
ALICE
Oh.
Meg and Emma turn to gape as well at the DINERS and elegant
tables inside as the rain hammers down.
ALICE (CONT'D)
That, mes aims, is Paris.
EMMA
You think they'd let me use the
bathroom?
As they emerge, the manager and doormen hustle Alice, Emma
and Meg towards a waiting car and driver, as paparazzi call
and shoot from across the boulevard.
ALICE
Thank you so much but I think we'll
WALK--
MANAGER
(LAUGHS)
But, you can not walk to the
airport.
ALICE

The airport?

A beat, as Emma and Meg look to Alice for direction and the
frenzied calls of the paparazzi increase.
The car drives across the wide stretch of runway on a
trajectory for a waiting private jet.
The steward helps the women from the plane, where another
UNIFORMED MAN waits on the tarmac to escort them further.
They emerge onto the deck, Emma squealing and grabbing Alice
when she sees their waiting helicopter.
Alice, Meg and Emma delight as the helicopter banks along the
coast, the Mediterranean glittering in blue and green below.
A craggy ridge falls away and all of MONTE CARLO unfolds in
step upon step of coral rooftops, cream and gold.
END MONTAGE.
Alice, Emma and Meg step from a limousine, blinking in the
bright sunlight to take in the square in front of the hotel,
its fountain and the adjacent casino.

Check out the palace, or the beach?

Let's find a map--
JEAN-PIERRE
Mademoiselle Scott!
They turn as JEAN-PIERRE MICHAND (late 30's), sophisticated
in jeans and a sportscoat but with a warm bohemian air, comes
down the steps, an oversized envelope tucked under his arm.
EMMA
Well, bon jour me.
JEAN-PIERRE
You made it! I was getting a
little frantic--. When I did not
hear from you--. So I sent your
TRAVEL--
(laughs at himself)
But, you are here.
(off her blank look)
Forgive me. Jean-Pierre. Michand.
With the foundation--
He pauses in shaking Emma's hand as his eyes land on Alice
with friendly curiosity, a charge.
JEAN-PIERRE (CONT'D)
Welcome--. I---. I didn't realize
you would be bringing--
EMMA
Oh, I'm sorry! This is Alice Perry
and Meg Kelly. Two of my dearest
friends. Visiting from America!
ALICE

Hello.
Jean-Pierre has trouble pulling his eyes from Alice as he

EMMA (CONT'D)
(WHISPERED ASIDE)
No ring.
JEAN-PIERRE
I'm terribly sorry, but, I am
already late for a meeting--
MEG
We won't keep you--
JEAN-PIERRE
I just wanted to make sure you
arrived safely and that I was here
to greet you.
(AN AFTERTHOUGHT)
Oh. And, of course, to deliver
your invitations for the week, and
the foundation's report--
EMMA
Invitations for the week--?
JEAN-PIERRE
Various events. Leading up to the
AUCTION--
(THE WATCH)
Again, I am so sorry, but, I am
reluctant to keep His Highness
waiting.
EMMA
His Highness?
JEAN-PIERRE
The Prince. But, we will see each
other at the casino for tonight's
game. Please, bring your friends--
ALICE
You are very generous, and we'd
love to, but, I'm afraid Cordelia
has other plans this evening--
Jean-Pierre turns, charmed by Alice's perfect French, and
alarmed by this news.

Perhaps we have misunderstood each
other. Mademoiselle Scott--. She
must be there for tonight's game.
The prince. His Highness has asked
to be seated across from her--
EMMA
What's he saying? Which prince?
Jean-Pierre looks imploringly between the three.
JEAN-PIERRE
Please. It is for the foundation.
Alice, Meg and Emma burst through the salon doors into the
street, their hair color richer, eyes brighter, a new
lightness to their step; vivid, brilliantly polished versions
of their essential selves.
Heads turn as they set out together.
MEG
Where was I ever going to wear
them? Seriously?
EMMA
You wear them here! Anywhere!
Alice, you tell her--
Alice opens her mouth, but stops herself as the three wander
the crowded market stalls heaped with fountains of flowers in
every color, breads, fresh produce, trinkets and souvenirs.
ALICE
No. I'm not going to tell you what
to do.
MEG
Thank you. It's silly, anyway.
They're just jeans. I want to find
something for the kids--

Emma leaps to one of the stalls, seizing a profusion of
plastic jeweled tiaras displayed alongside photographs of
Princess Grace. She places a tiara on her head, modeling.
EMMA (CONT'D)
How perfect is this?!

Alice holds up a pair of pink satin toe shoes, swinging them
from their ribbon laces.
Richard exits the shoe repair carrying Alice'.s repaired
suitcase, headed for his car.

Hey, Richard!
Richard glances up to see Glenn crossing the parking lot with
Seamus and Finn, pushing a cart piled high with groceries.

I love surprises!
RICHARD
What? No, I---
GLENN
Oh, man, I win!
Richard blinks as Glenn claps him on the shoulder.
GLENN (CONT'D)
Meg and I've had this bet going:
She thought it would be on Alice's
next birthday, but I knew it was
going to be this trip to France!
RICHARD
Glenn, listen--
GLENN
Don't worry! I won't blow it for
you! I won't call anyone, ruin the

gesture, you know? Not too
dominating: Supportive. Loving!
(shakes his head)
You're the man, Richard. Big
props.
Glenn pulls Richard into a big happy bear hug.
GLENN (CONT'D)
Congratulations.
RICHARD
Glenn. She said, no.
BERNARD ROCHAND (late 30's), an appealing Frenchman in a worn
sportscoat, pauses in collecting leeks when he spots Meg on
the other side of the open stall.
He watches as she surveys the rich array of fresh produce,
lifting a tomato to her nose, inhaling with a private smile.
Meg bites into the tomato, spurting juice onto her cheek and
down her front.
She looks up as she attempts to wipe the juice away, stopping
when she catches Bernard smiling with amusement.
Meg rolls her eyes with self-deprecation and moves on along
the line of stalls.
Bernard pays for his purchase and follows, finding Meg at
another stall where a FRENCHWOMAN tries to communicate how to
prepare the fish they both admire.
Meg nods, not entirely understanding, but getting enough of
it to gesture responses.
The woman grabs some newspaper, wrapping the fish, and
thrusts it towards Meg with a smile.

She is only a visitor. Without a
kitchen. But, it is a beautiful
fish. Maybe next time.
Meg turns to find Bernard beside her.
BERNARD (CONT'D)
I have explained.
Meg hesitates uncertainly before this friendly stranger.
MEG
Well, thank you...
She smiles at the woman and starts to walk away, only to find
Bernard falling into step with her.
BERNARD
You are American.
Meg glances at Bernard and away, uncomfortable, but curious,
drawn by his warmth and the familiar greetings he exchanges
with various vendors as they walk.
MEG
From Wisconsin. Yes.
Bernard reaches a handkerchief from his jacket for Meg.
BERNARD
You cook in Wisconsin?
Meg uses the handkerchief to blot the remaining tomato juice.
MEG
I try. But... We don't have even
half of this at home.
She points to a tray of miniature lobsters.

Meg shakes his hand and returns the handkerchief.
MEG
Meg. Kelly. Thank you again for
YOUR HELP--

And, how long are you in Monte

Thanks, though.
She slips into the moving crowd, leaving Bernard to watch as
she meets Alice and Emma further up the street.
He holds a beat, then turns when called to by a vendor.
Madame Valery, cellphone to her ear, leads'the few remaining
members of her flock down the wide steps, across the Seine
from the Eiffel tower.
MADAME VALERY
She refused to follow my
instructions. She sabotaged my

Wait. Alice did? Alice Perry?

BUT--
GLENN
What's she saying?
MADAME VALERY
You are the husband, yes?
Richard hesitates, looks to Glenn.
RICHARD

Yes. I am the husband.
Glenn nods emphatically.

strolling party guests.
ALICE
I thought she was right behind us--
Alice and Emma walk with Meg down the narrow street at the
end of which the party guests stroll and Jean-Pierre waits
for Alice, with Penelope, Domenico and Nikolai.

He is so cute! And a cook--!

The paparazzi swarm from the steps towards Emma.

the paparazzi meet them, flashing away.
Leaning against the fountain's balustrade, Emma gestures for
everyone to join them.

Her feet zip out from beneath her and she sails backwards
over the balustrade, reaching for Alice and Meg, pulling them
with her as the camera's flash.
SPLASH!
A 747 airliner touches down on the tarmac.
Richard steps from the hotel with a MANAGER (50's) who
pantomimes that he recognizes Alice from the snapshot Richard
shows him, but has no idea where she could be.
Richard pulls out a map to point at a random spot and the
manager gestures up the street, down the street, shrugging:
She could be anywhere.
Alice, amid a crowd of tourists, only half watches the
changing of the guards outside the palace gates.
She snaps herself out of her distraction with a shake of her
head and turns to the marked pages in her guide book.
CARL
Alice?
She glances up to find Carl and Deedee from the tour.
DEEDEE

only live once! And as long as
we've got each other--
CARL
We've got everything, right?
Alice blinks, unaccountably teary eyed.
ALICE
Yes. That's right.
CARL
Sometimes you've just gotta follow
your heart. Be bold: Let the rest
take care of itself.
Richard stands with his map beneath the arch where all roads
come together in a spinning roundabout of bleating car horns.
He looks down the length of the Champs Elysees, overwhelmed.
The Japanese couple from Notre Dame approach Richard to ask
directions and he shrugs helplessly, pressing the map on
them, and steps out as a crosswalk signal turns to green.
Alice embraces Deedee and Carl beside a waiting taxi.
CARL
Tell the girls we would have loved
to see them, but--
DEEDEE
Italy calls! And Greece! We're
even thinking of hitting Turkey!
Imagine! We'll send you postcards.

Deedee scrolls the window down.
ALICE
Enjoy every second of it!
DEEDEE
You, too, honey!
CARL
Bon voyage!
The car pulls away, Carl and Deedee turning in their seats to
wave at Alice through the rear window.
Alice waves until they are out of sight and slowly lowers her
hand, standing alone in the street.
A beat.
Alice sighs and pulls out her guide book, unfolding a map as
she looks up to gather her bearings.
She takes in the quiet street, the view of the ocean, then
looks back at the map in her hands.
She straightens up, a new look of purpose on her face, and
crosses the street to toss her guide book and map in the
trash can on the corner, striking out unaided down a narrow
twisting street hung with vines and flowers.
Alice rounds the corner of one street into the tight
intersection of two narrow alleys in the fading twilight.
She looks around,.cheeks flushed, hair pasted to her
forehead, lost in a maze of dilapidated walled courtyards and
apartment blocks; home to the city's service workers.
She hesitates, then forges ahead down one street until she
sees that it dead ends, and she doubles back.
Alice suppresses panic as she walks briskly up a steep alley,
high in the hills, trailed now by a small stray DOG.
She stops, turns to the dog that also stops then sits.
ALICE
is Go. Go home.

She turns and starts forward, the dog following.
Alice stops again, turns, and the dog sits.
ALICE (CONT'D)
Don't follow me. I have no idea
where I'm going...
The dog cocks its head in comment.
ALICE (CONT'D)
Okay?
Alice turns to climb the street's incline.
The dog follows.
A pair of strolling LOVERS draw Richard's attention as he
massages his stockinged foot at a sidewalk table.
He watches them stop, kiss, then continue on their way.
A WAITER returns with Richard's change on a plate and Richard
fits his shoe back on his foot, gathers his things to stand.
He stops when he notices the front page of a newspaper folded
on a chair at the next table.
He quickly unfolds it to the photograph of Alice and Meg with
Emma in the fountain, scans down to the caption: Cordelia
Scott and friends in Monte Carlo. Hotel de Paris, etc...
Alice feeds the little dog a scrap of meat as she eats a
kabob, seated on the curb by a street vendor's food cart
around which ALGERIAN MEN lounge in plastic lawn chairs.
The dog looks at her avidly, hungry for more.
Alice holds her kabob stick out for the dog to eat,
surrendering her dinner with pleasure.
As Alice sips from a bottle of beer, a soccer ball bounces
off the curb and rolls to a stop beside her.
She looks up as a ragtag BAND OF KIDS call from the dusty lot
across the street, asking for their ball.
A beat as Alice regards the ball.
Emma wears Cordelia's elaborate necklace, standing alone,
within a throng of PARTY GOERS, all conversing in French.
she nods and smiles absently, though she's clearly lost, out
of her element, when Giorgio approaches.
GIORGIO
Where is Meg? I do not see her.

No. I... I don't think she's

survey the party, smiling wistfully at Penelope and Domenico
locked in intimate conversation.

The trio of paparazzi putter alongside in a small boat,
peppering the yacht with their camera flashes.
Emma looks out at them, without her usual animation.
PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT'D)
Smile, Cordelia! Please, smile!
Emma waves, but can't seem to manage that smile.
NIKOLAI
Ty v poryadke?
Emma turns to find Nikolai standing beside her in white tie,
a piece of cake extended in one hand, a fork in the other.
Emma's eyes light up as if a switch has been thrown and the
flash of a camera records her huge, dazzling smile.
EMMA
Niki.
He bows slightly, offering the cake.
EMMA (CONT'D)
You work here too? You never get a

Alice sails down the makeshift soccer field as one of the
kids passes the ball to her, chased by the others.
She dodges and kicks the ball through the goal to score.
Her "team" jumps and cheers, as do a collection of spectators
who have gathered to watch this tall red headed woman in a
summer dress racing around the dusty lot with a band of kids.

Yeah. No. No way.
Bernard straddles a beat up moped, motor running, as Meg
shakes her head emphatically.
BERNARD
I can not take you, if you will not
get on.
MEG
What do you want me to tell you?
I'm not getting on that thing.
Bernard fixes her with a level look, which Meg mimics.
BERNARD
(AMIABLY)
C'est bon. Au revoir.
He swings a leg over the moped, revs the engine.
MEG
Hold on.
Meg hangs on to Bernard as they zip along the beachfront
drive and turns her face to the wind with a smile.
She surrenders to the ride, the sheer fun of it, laughing.
MEG
How do you say "faster?"
Jean-Pierre drives an open silver sports car full of PARTY
GOERS down the twisting streets, when he sees the commotion
and crowd around the dirt lot.
Then he spots Alice running-around.
Alice sticks like glue to a kid with the ball, maneuvers in,
steals the ball, and doubles back in the opposite direction,
racing up the field as the crowd laughs and claps.
She passes the ball to kid who drives it to the goal, scores.
Alice looks up from the game at the tapping of a car horn to
see Jean-Pierre honking in celebration as he leans against
the car with his GUESTS, enjoying the game.
Alice stops to wave, and takes the ball full in the face.

around Alice's prone body.

She leaps up as Jean-Pierre crosses the lot.
ALICE
I'm up! I'm up! Let's go!
She sets off down the field with the kids.
Empty and half-filled glasses, bottles litter every surface
along with plates, ashtrays, crumpled napkins.
Emma sits on the lower landing deck, legs in the water, shoes
in her hand, looking out at the lights.
Nikolai moves his legs in the gentle current beside her,
tuxedo trousers rolled, while he concentrates on working a
napkin into intricate folds.
Emma turns to look back at the silent boat.
EMMA
It doesn't seem fair. Leaving you
to clean up all alone.
(THINKS)
I'll help. But, you've really got
to talk to your boss.
Nikolai laughs, shaking his head.
NIKOLAI
Ya ryadom.
EMMA
It must get kind of lonely
sometimes... Not being understood.
(PAUSES)
I know how that can feel.
Nikolai holds up the napkin he's transformed into a crown
adorned with flowers and the wire cages from Champagne corks.
Emma looks at him, her face soft and vulnerable, open, as
Nikolai places the makeshift crown on her head with care.

Nikolai looks down at his hand on the edge of the deck next
to Emma's, and turns it palm up in invitation.
Emma places her hand in his.

Hard to say. There are many.
Alice steps out onto the hotel's roof with Jean-Pierre's
jacket over her shoulders.
ALICE (V.O.)
Well, Africa, then. How often do
you get to go?
He leads her around the maze of skylights to the front of the
building that faces the sea and the lightening sky.
JEAN-PIERRE (V.0.)
Not enough. Mostly I am on planes.
To the places where sunlight and
parties make people generous.
Alice's smile flickers with a vague disappointment as she
leans against the hotel's crown beside Jean-Pierre.
ALICE
That seems a shame...
JEAN-PIERRE
But, I can think of one place I
have never been. It is in my
imagination only, so it is very
special.
He places an arm around Alice as they take in the view.
JEAN-PIERRE (CONT'D)
It is just a small town, in a vast,
open space. Maybe in the middle of
America. There are people there
like yourself, who are kind. And
children who have everything they
need.
Alice turns to Jean-Pierre as he takes a strand of her hair
in his fingers, and they hold a beat, looking at one another.

horizon just as the rising sun crests the open sea.
Nikolai shrugs himself out of his formal shirt to stand
before Emma in nothing but starfish printed boxer shorts.
He lifts his hands: This is me. Here I am.
Emma hesitates, then lets her gown fall around her, bare
except for her panties, the necklace, and her napkin crown.
Nikolai pushes himself off the side of the boat at a run,
hiking up his legs into a cannonball. SPLASH!
He surfaces and turns back to the boat just as Emma dives in
with a SPLASH!
She swims to Nikolai, pushing him under in a child's game,
and he pops up, spitting water like a fountain.
They laughs and Emma loops her arms around him.
A beat as they sober.
Emma pulls Nikolai close to her, and they kiss.
On the landing deck, Emma's gown shimmers in the morning sun
with Nikolai's crown and Cordelia's yellow gem and diamond
necklace nestled among its satin folds.
Richard exits the plane, walking down a mobile stairway onto
the tarmac, carrying Alice's repaired suitcase.

Thank you.
Meg hugs him briefly, awkwardly, then turns for the steps.
BERNARD
Goodbye, Meg.
Meg stops, holds a beat with her back to Bernard.
Then she turns and marches to him with purpose, seizing his
face in both her hands and kisses him passionately.
She releases Bernard, who staggers against the moped,
catching himself just before going over, as she turns again
for the steps, an enormous smile on her face.

precariously perched atop the adjacent balcony's railing,
back pressed against the face of the hotel.

the view of the ocean and the yachts in the bay behind them.
A BOAT DRIVER in uniform passes a captain's hat to Nikolai,
who places it on his head as they speed towards the marina.
Meg turns to get a gauge on the distant yacht as she and
Alice labor with the oars of a fisherman's dinghy.

Penelope through the revolving door.
Nikolai rings the doorbell.

Cordelia opens the door to Nikolai, who holds out the room
key and flower with a smile as her brows come together.

They look at each other in confusion, Nikolai's smile fading,
Cordelia with mounting alarm.

Emma and Meg, as Nikolai removes the necklace from his pocket
and reaches to ring the suite's bell again.
EMMA

They race down the hall towards Nikolai, who gapes, perplexed
by the sight of Emma.

Euros to Jean-Pierre.

Domenico, beside a waiting sedan at the base of the hotel's
steps where the trio of paparazzi shoot away.

other two pause to reload their cameras.
