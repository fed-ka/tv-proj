                Hello, Donna.  I have the conference room 
                booked for this morning, right?

                              DONNA
                Yup.

                And the large meeting room for tomorrow 
                night?

                                LESLIE
                Tomorrow night is our very first public 
                forum solely about our new park project.    
                It s like my sub-committee s Debutante 
                Ball.  Or Bar Mitzvah.  Or -- what s the 
                name of that Native American thing where 
                they send the kids off into the desert to 
                have visions or something?

                Yeah... I want to say again, this is a 
                bad idea.  It s way too early for a

  LESLIE TALKING HEAD

                                LESLIE
                My mother is my hero.  She s been on the 
                Pawnee School Board since 1989.  She 
                invented the motto of the Pawnee public 
                schools:  Every Kid s an Honors Student.   
                She came up with that when she eliminated 
                the honors program.


  Leslie can t seem to find a nonchalant perch.

                                LESLIE
                So.  You hear about the Deputy Mayor?

                Ooooh -- no.  You got dirt?

                                LESLIE
                Huge dirt.  I read in the paper he s 
                lukewarm about the Mayor s new clean 
                streets initiative.  You didn t hear it 
                from me.

  Marlene stares at her.

                April is a very sour, obstructionist

                this.

  She turns and lifts her shirt to show a red  APPROVED  stamp 
  placed like a tattoo on her lower back.


  Ann shows Mark in.  Andy is on the couch, playing ROCK BAND 
  in boxers and an open flannel shirt.  He doesn t look up, 
  intent on an expert-level guitar riff.

                              ANDY
                      (calling off)
                Babe, someone at the door.

  Ann looks at Mark, then the camera.

                              ANN
                Yeah, it s me, honey.  I wasn t home.

                              ANDY
                Oh, I thought you were in the bathroom or 
                  something.

                              ANN
                All day?

                              ANDY
                I know, right?  I was like,  she s taking 
                awhile. 

  Andy cranes his neck.  Sees Mark.  And the cameras.

                              MARK
                Hello.

                              ANDY
                Hey, man, what up?  Lemme just pause 
                this, so I don t lose any fans.
                      (he pauses the game)
                Mork, right?

                              MARK
                ...Mark.

                              ANDY
                That makes more sense.  Right on.

  Ann goes into the kitchen.  As she does:

                              ANN
                Hon, can you--

  She indicates that Andy should cover up a little.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)  PARKS AND RECREATION       Canvassing         [01003]           23.

                Oh yeah.  Sorry.

  Andy reaches for the nearest thing -- a cereal box -- and 
  places it over his crotch.  It doesn t do much.

  Ann brings in glasses of ICED TEA.  Mark sips his and sighs.

                              MARK
                This is so much better than knocking on 
                people s doors.

                              ANN
                Yeah.

                              ANDY
                Hey, bro, you play Rock Band?  Drums are 
                wide open.  I d offer bass, but it got 
                broken when I smashed it.

  Mark looks at a FRACTURED, SMASHED ROCK BAND BASS on the 
  floor.

                              MARK
                I m good, thanks.

                              ANDY
                 I m good  like you suck, or  I m good  
                like you re scared  cause I m a 
                  professional musician and you ll get 
                crushed?

                      (to Ann)
                I like this guy!

                              MARK
                And I like you!

  Ann looks a little unsure.


  Leslie and Fred drink coffee and eat little cookies.

                Well, don t get me wrong -- I ve lived in

                Sullivan Street used to be a dirt road 
                between two farms.  

  Leslie perks up.

                              FRED (CONT D)
                Heck, my wife grew up right near Ramsett 
                Park, and we used to take our grandkids 
                there...

  Leslie glances at camera: this guy s a catch!


  Andy plays Rock Band in the b.g., as Ann and Mark drink iced 
  tea.  Ann is on her cell PHONE, trying to cover the 
    background noise as much as possible.

                              ANN

                Leslie says she s got a  hot lead.   She

                No, we got set up by a girlfriend of mine.

  down next to Andy.  Mark sits uncomfortably, trying to smile 
  to the cameras a little.

  Fred is fast asleep, his chest rising and falling.  Leslie 
  has dimmed the lights, and speaks quietly to not wake him up.

  curled up like a baby, is Leslie -- fast asleep.

  Tom is at his desk.  Leslie rushes in.  She looks like she 
  slept on a couch.  Because she slept on a couch.  She 
  frantically searches piles on her desk.

  Leslie looks around, opens a closet and grabs a BIG GREEN 
  CAN.  She sprays herself with it, like perfume.

  April sits behind the desk, handing out permit applications.

                Don t worry about it.

  She walks off.  Mark stares after her.

                Yeah, I patched things up with Ann.  So, 
                I guess we re back to being... 
                  acquaintances. 


  There s a relatively large crowd.  They don t seem happy.  
  Leslie speaks into a microphone.

                                LESLIE
                Good evening.  My name is Deputy Director 
                of the Parks and Recreation Department 
                Leslie Knope.  Thank you for coming to 
                our very first public forum about our 
                proposal to turn Lot 48 on Sullivan 
                Street into a community park.  Yeah!!

  Nothing from the audience.  Leslie glances nervously to 
  camera.  Marlene notices and looks to camera, too.

                Hello.  My name is Kate Spivak, and I 
                want to say that I am firmly, one hundred 
                percent against this park.  I think it 
                would be bad for the community, and there 
                are hundreds of better uses for that 
                space.

  Many people in the crowd APPLAUD.  Leslie looks scared.  This 
  is off to a terrible start.  Leslie gets back behind the 
  microphone.

                                LESLIE
                Okay, thank you for your comments.  
                Before we continue, I d just like to give 
                you a little history.  The City of Pawnee 
                was incorporated in 1817, after Reverend 
                Luther Howell of Terre Haute traveled one 
                hundred miles by ox and planted a flag in 
                the ground, before being twisted to death  
                by a small band of Wamapoke Indians.

                Yes, uh, Democracy does mean hearing the 
                public s opinion.  But Advanced Democracy 
                also has dozens of loopholes built in.  
                One of those is: the filibuster.  You 
                just keep talking, and nobody can do 
                anything  til you stop.


  It s been a while.  People are getting antsy.  Marlene looks 
  impressed and proud.

                This is supposed to be a public forum.  
                That means the public talks, and you 
                listen.

  Leslie sees Fred in the crowd.  She brightens.

                                LESLIE
                Okay.  Yes.  You are right.  Let s start 
                with that gentleman, right there.

  Fred looks slightly surprised, but makes his way to the 
  microphone.

                                LESLIE (CONT D)
                Go ahead, sir.

                              FRED
                Well, my name is Fred Tessop.  I ve lived 
                in Pawnee all my life.

                              FRED
                  I remember when I was a young boy, I used 
                to go feed the birds in Ramsett Park.  I 
                do feel strongly that Pawnee would 
                benefit from a new park, so my 
                  grandchildren and their children can feed 
                birds for years to come.

  The crowd seems touched.  Leslie looks incredibly relieved.

                                LESLIE
                Thank you, sir.  A moving tribute to my

                I would also point out that I did not 
                feel this way yesterday.  But that young 
                lady speaking up there had so much 
                passion for the project, she spent the 
                night with me.

  The crowd REACTS.

                name is Ann Perkins, and I m a Pawnee 
                citizen just like you.  I live right next 
                to that pit, and I d like to say for the 
                record: I also fully support Ms. Knope s 
                proposal to turn it into a park.  And you 
                know what?  It seems like she s working 
                really hard to try to get something done, 
                and make the neighborhood better, and I 
                think we should respect that.

  Leslie is tremendously moved.  She and Ann smile at each

                Most of us think this park is a bad idea, 
                so why don t we take a vote!

  Leslie.
