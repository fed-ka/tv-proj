Super: THE KHYBER PASS, AFGHANISTAN
We're looking down at what used to be called "The End of the Known
World." A landscape that is both beautiful, and forbidding.
In the center of this vista, there is a deep ravine.
Pushing in on the ravine, there appears to be a giant icicle hanging
over a cliff:
AN ICE FALL. A 600 foot waterfall whose face is frozen solid.
Pushing in still closer, there is a tiny black dot inching its way up
the ice. A human figure. This is:
JAMES BOND, BRITISH SECRET SERVICE AGENT, 007.
Bond is sweating and straining, four hundred feet in the air. He has
an ice-pick tethered to each hand, ice-cleats on his boots. A black
backpack. As he climbs, spider-like, pulling himself up, he goes to
JAM A CLEAT into the ice, but -
CRACK! A 50 foot stiletto of ice breaks off, CRASHING onto the rocks
below. Regaining his foothold, Bond looks down: Certain death. He
looks up: So very, very, far to go. Bond shakes his head:
BOND
There has to be an easier way to earn
a living.
Still, Bond climbs. Huffing, sweating, he goes up, and up, until -
ANOTHER ANGLE -
He's 25 feet from the top. He drives a first ice pick in. Gets a
toehold. But when he slams the second pick in -
THE ICE WALL SHATTERS, FALLING AWAY IN FRONT OF HIM. IN THE SHOCK -
BOND LOSES HIS GRIP ON THE FIRST ICE PICK -
And 007 is now dangling, 575 feet in the air, staring at a torrent of
water - hanging only by the leather thread around his wrist, attached
to the first ice-pick, still embedded in the wall.
Bond pauses. Thinks. And coolly begins to swing himself back and
forth, in widening arcs, like a clock's pendulum.
At the high point of his swing, Bond reaches back to smash his other
pick into the ice - BUT MISSES. He looks up at:
THE FIRST ICE PICK, STILL EMBEDDED IN THE WALL -
Beginning to work its way out. The tether, fraying.
RETURN ON BOND -
Cautiously, 007 begins to swing a second time. Once. Twice. And on
the third arc, he swings the ice-pick viciously - but MISSES AGAIN.
ANGLE ON THE FIRST ICE PICK, STILL EMBEDDED IN THE WALL -
Now jutting downward, barely holding. The tether is almost totally
frayed through.
RETURN ON BOND -
One last chance. Bond swings. Once. Twice. He reaches back, hurls
himself at the wall, lunging - AND SMASHES THE SECOND PICK INTO THE
ICE... Just as the tether finally snaps on the first one. Still,
he's all but home: He reaches over, grabs the first pick (barely
holding in the ice,) jabs it in, and continues upward.
Exhausted, Bond reaches up, over the edge. He drives a pick down -
through the ice, into the hard, flat, ground beneath the waterbed.
As he pulls himself up, (his full weight on the first ice-pick,) he
smashes a second pick through the ice, into the waterbed, and -
THE ENTIRE ICE FALL GIVES WAY -
Breaking off with a groan, tumbling onto the rocks below.
IN THE WATERBED -
A torrent of water crashes over 007. Fighting the oncoming deluge,
he crawls - on his belly - through the water - 25 feet inland.
NEW ANGLE - (TOP OF THE WATER FALL, INLAND)
Bond stands, walks out of the riverbed. He looks back at the cliff:
BOND'S POV - THE WATER FALL -
On either side of the water, there are two small RADAR DISHES, angled
down, scanning every inch of the area, save for the waterfall itself.
In other words: This was the only way in.
RETURN ON BOND -
007 shrugs. From his backpack, he takes out TWO CIGAR-SIZED BLACK
CANISTERS, and an ELONGATED BLACK BOX. He presses a button on the
side of the box, and - fwap, fwap, fwap - SNOW SKIS unfold.
He presses buttons on the canisters: TELESCOPIC SKI POLES. Bond
slaps on the skis, and takes off, through the snow.
Bond hurtles over the side, going airborne, landing 100 feet below,
amidst boulders. In perfect Olympic form, he skis out, and down.
Bond slaloms down, in and out of trees, to avoid detection. At the
bottom, where the snow thins, he comes to:
A ROCK OUTCROPPING.
Hiding behind the rock, Bond takes off his skis, knapsack. He
unpacks (and unfolds) a HIGH TECH AUTOMATIC RIFLE. Puts on a
HEADSET. He creeps up on the rock, and looks out on:
A SECRET MILITARY BASE/AIR STRIP (BOND'S POV)
50 feet down, 200 yards away: 50 MEN are unloading CARGO from a dozen
MILITARY TRANSPORT TRUCKS; there are TWO NORTH KOREAN MiG-29s on the
ground (one partially obscured by a truck,) plus FLATBEDS carrying
HELICOPTERS and SCUD MISSILES.
Near a QUONSET HUT, a TRUCK-MOUNTED RADAR DISH scans the area, with
INFRARED GATLING GUNS mounted on either side.
BOND - AT THE ROCK OUTCROPPING -
Props his rife on the boulder, and peers through the GUN SIGHT.
THROUGH THE TELESCOPIC SIGHT -
He sees a closer (but still wide) telescopic view of men bargaining
over weapons, and forklifts loading/unloading crates of munitions.
THE SAME SCENE ON A VIDEO WALL - MI-6 SITUATION ROOM, LONDON.
BOND'S VOICE
(over a speaker)
Seven, in position.
TANNER'S VOICE
Roger, Seven.
Watching this display is M, TANNER, and a handful of MILITARY BRASS,
including a RUSSIAN GENERAL, BUKHARIN, and BRITISH ADMIRAL ROEBUCK,
an aging sea-lion with no love for M, or MI-6.
M deals with the humorless Admiral by, well, humoring him:
M
... What were you saying, Admiral?
Something about this 'not being a job
for a wine-sniffing, skirt-chasing
playboy spy?'
ADMIRAL ROEBUCK
- I'll be sure to acknowledge 007's
'assistance' in my report to the
Prime Minister. But this is, still,
a naval operation.
M
What do they say in Russia, General
Bukharin?
(asks questions in
flawless Russian)
The general chuckles. Translates:
GENERAL BUKHARIN
'In a joint operation, someone's nose
always gets put out of joint.'
M turns to Admiral Roebuck:
M
I'm interested in success, Admiral.
Not who gets credit.
(turning to:)
Mr. Tanner: What have we got?
Tanner points to the video wall with a RED LASER PEN.
TANNER
(ironically)
A regular terrorist swap meet. Death
at discount: Two Chinese Long March
Scuds, a pair of Soviet A-17 attack
helicopters -
BUKHARIN
(interrupting)
Stolen -
TANNER
And the crates look like American M-16
assault rifles, Chilean antipersonnel
mines, six French Exocet missiles, and
75 - no maybe a hundred - kilograms of
Czech made C-4 Semtech explosive.
(beat)
Something for everyone. Fun for the
whole family.
M
(freezing him with a glance)
What about ID's?
TANNER
(pushes a button on a console)
One to seven: Deal the face cards.
THE ROCK OUTCROPPING -
Bond adjusts a knob on the scope.
MI-6 SITUATION ROOM -
On the video-screen, the picture zooms to a CLOSE UP of one of the
arms traders. Tanner presses a button, and - almost instantly - the
man's bio and vitals appear on another video screen.
TANNER
Gustav Meinholtz. Neo-Nazi, former
East German STASI agent. Ties to the
Beider-Meinhoff gang.
(pressing a button)
Aces high, seven. Bid to the east.
Bond shifts his aim, east. (Intercut as necessary) He zeroes in on
another face, and the man's stats appear in London.
TANNER
Vilko Barkoviac. Bosnian war
criminal; thought to be operating
freelance out of Teheran.
(pressing a button)
Full house, seven. Bid to the North.
Bond complies. Another face, another set of stats:
TANNER
Sitoshi Isagura. Japanese religious
fanatic. Wanted for the Tokyo subway -
ADMIRAL ROEBUCK
(impatiently, cutting him off:)
I've seen enough. Let's finish this.
(ordering M:)
Tell your man to drop back. We're
initiating plan B -
M
But -
ADMIRAL ROEBUCK
- Thank you, M. But this is more
than your man can handle.
(to Bukharin)
Are we in agreement?
BUKHARIN
(hesitant, at first)
- Yes. Yes.
M
Admiral -
Moving swiftly, the Admiral has picked up a RED PHONE:
ADMIRAL ROEBUCK
Command to Nelson: Authorization to
fire.
A launcher rotates, and - BOOM - a Cruise missile blasts off.
Bond goes into evasive maneuvers - jinks right, jinks left - when,
suddenly, THE COPILOT REVIVES, and starts trying to STRANGLE Bond
with a METAL LANYARD. Struggling, Bond HEARS a THIN HIGH-PITCHED
TONE -
The pilot has locked onto Bond's MiG. Boom! TWO HEAT-SEEKING
MISSILES roar away.
Fighting the garrote, Bond KICKS THE THROTTLES forward and PULLS BACK
ON THE YOKE. The MiG goes into a spine crushing climb as -
THE TWO HEAT SEEKING MISSILES FOLLOW HIM, LOOPING UPWARD.
Fighting against the garrote, Bond strains to reach a RED BUTTON on
the panel: COPILOT EJECTOR SEAT.
Bond finally taps it, and - THE BACK HALF OF THE CANOPY BLOWS OFF!
The COPILOT BLASTS OUT OF THE PLANE, DOWNWARD, directly into MIG-2's
cockpit. Bond peels off.
For a second, MiG-2 hangs in the air. Until... BOOM!!! The TWO HEAT
SEEKING MISSILES BLAST IT TO SMITHEREENS.
Back in MiG-1, Bond fiddles with the radio.
MI-6 - SITUATION ROOM -
BOND'S VOICE
Seven to base. I have a full
house. Your bid.
The situation room erupts in cheers.
RETURN ON BOND IN THE MIG -
BOND
By the way: Thank the General for all
his "assistance." Over and out.
Goes to AFTERBURNERS. And from the fiery glow of the engine, we
DISSOLVE TO:
THE 007 GUN BARREL. MAIN CREDITS.
After credits, fade in on:
All ivy and bricks... And a certain Aston-Martin DB-5, parked.
The DB-5 drives past the guard.
A GLEAMING WHITE YACHT - with two on-board helicopters, and a huge
tarped hold - dominates the harbor. (Harmsway's SEA DOLPHIN II.)
Tonight, however, we find a GONDOLA, gliding through the water...
Arriving at a festively-lit dock, crowded with gaily costumed
partygoers and musicians in medieval garb.
Wearing the mask from M's office, (and a bright blue cape,) Bond
alights the gondola, and plunges into the crowd.
A swirl of colors, noise and music. Pushing his way into the chaotic
celebration, Bond scans the crowd, looking for a face:
NOTHING BUT A SEA OF MASKS. White. Yellow. Red. Blue.
Caught up in the tumult, he turns left, he strains to turn right,
anxiously looking for the contact. Who is it?
THREE MASKED WOMEN appear in front of Bond. They curtsy, and giggle.
WOMAN
Buona sera, signore -
He's spun by a MASKED MAN with a bottle.
MAN
Vino?
Bond waves him off - and is jostled in the other direction, by a
group of celebrants carrying a long banner.
Suddenly, the CROWD SURGES FORWARD: A PROCESSION, carrying the
EFFIGY OF CARNIVAL is making its way through the square.
Locked shoulder to shoulder in the crowd, Bond struggles to look
forward - left, right - when he FEELS A TUG at his cape from behind.
He can only crane his neck to see/hear -
MASKED WOMAN
I may have been followed. Meet me at
the Church in five minutes!
With an effort, Bond turns to look at her - but sees nothing, save
the wisp of a satin costume, disappearing as the crowd closes ranks
behind him.
SAN GIACOMO SQUARE - NIGHT
Five minutes later. Almost deserted. A few stray couples. The
MASKED WOMAN appears, walking tentatively between the shadows and
the moonlight, looking for Bond. Suddenly -
Whomp! - an arm reaches out, and yanks her into an alcove.
BOND
Looking for someone?
Recovering her breath (it was a violent yank,) the woman - PARIS
removes her mask. She shines a sexy, 1000-watt smile at 007:
PARIS
Hello, James.
Bond reacts. He is not happy to see her.
BOND
Paris?!? What are you doing here?
PARIS
Is that any way to say hello?
BOND
I thought your specialty was good-bye.
Paris smiles coyly. She LIFTS A HAND to tousle his hair -
PARIS
Oh, James. I've missed you -
BOND
(grabbing her by the wrist)
Is this another one of your games?
PARIS
Stop it! You're hurting me! Can't
you just be nice?
BOND
I've got half the British government
breathing down my neck. I don't have
time for your nonsense.
She's surprised - and hurt - by his coldness.
PARIS
Don't you even miss me? Didn't I
mean anything to you?
BOND
Nothing.
She turns away from him, fighting back tears. Bond doesn't care:
BOND
What about Elliot Harmsway? Or is
this just another one of your stunts?
PARIS
(anguished)
No! He's crazy - he's insane. He
hates everybody. He's got these
plans -
(facing Bond, becoming hysterical:)
You've got to help me, James. I'm
sorry. I'm sorry for everything. I
know I was wrong - but you've got to
protect me. I know you still love -
BOND SLAPS HER. She's stunned. He waits. She's angered:
PARIS
Do you feel better now?
BOND
(not giving an inch)
Do you?
She turns away. Bond feels remorse for hitting her. Softens:
BOND
What about the uranium?
PARIS
It's on the boat. He's holding a
press conference tomorrow.
Bond reaches out to touch her. She falls into his arms, burying her
face in his shoulder.
PARIS
I'm so sorry, James. I promise, I'll
never leave you again.
BOND
(patting her head)
Shhhhh...
PARIS
Just hold me.
Bond thinks for a moment, then gently pushes her away, a foot
backwards, to look in her eyes:
BOND
How do you know Harmsway?
Paris' eyes flicker at something over Bond's shoulder. She swoons:
PARIS
Kiss me.
She pulls Bond to her, kissing him - then HAULS OFF, BELTING him
across the mouth.
PARIS
Bastard! Leave me alone!
She shoves him off, darts away. Bond is bleeding from his mouth -
and not altogether surprised at her behavior. He turns to see -
ANOTHER ANGLE - SAN GIACOMO SQUARE - (BOND'S POV) -
Paris running to FOUR MEN dressed alike in three-corner hats,
enveloped from head-to-foot in BLACK CAPES. Their faces are
completely concealed behind flat, bone-white masks covering all but
their chins. They look like messengers of death.
CLOSER ON PARIS AND THE MEN -
The leader is STAMPER; the others are locals, THUG #1, #2, #3. (THUG
#1 is built like a bank vault.) Stamper looks steadily at Bond
STAMPER
Who is he?
PARIS
Nobody. Just some drunk. Leave him
alone -
STAMPER
(to Thug #3)
Take her to the boat.
RETURN ON BOND -
He sees STAMPER and the TWO HENCHMEN approaching. He turns and walks
quickly toward -
Pushing past carnival-goers, Bond rushes up the central staircase of
the bridge. At the top, looking onto the main span, he sees -
THE EFFIGY OF CARNIVAL PROCESSION, approaching like a tidal wave.
BOND throws a look over his shoulder, and SEES THE THREE MEN, rushing
up the stairs, knocking people out of the way like bowling pins -
completely unaware of the oncoming parade at the top.
BOND turns to face the men... And suddenly THROWS HIS CAPE UP,
dramatically, like Batman - blocking their view of the procession.
STAMPER AND THE TWO THUGS hesitate for a moment -
And BOND PULLS THE CAPE TO HIS BODY, just as the PROCESSION SURGES
PAST HIM, and spills down the stairs, overwhelming Stamper & Co.
BOND
(to himself, flexing the cape)
So that's how he does it.
Bond disappears into the oncoming crowd.
Stamper and Thug #2 are pushed to the bottom of the staircase - but
Thug #1 bulls his way up, shouldering through the crowd.
RIALTO BRIDGE - SECOND (DOWN) STAIRCASE - NIGHT
As Bond nears the bottom of the staircase, he looks back up:
THUG #1 is coming down the stairs like an infernal machine, tossing
carnival-goers aside like rag-dolls. Spotting Bond, he charges -
But gets caught between TWO MEN CARRYING A SATIN BANNER. He goes
right through it - ripping the material apart with his bare hands,
pulling the men down, after him.
BASE OF THE RIALTO BRIDGE - CANAL SIDESTREET - NIGHT
Bond turns past the wall at the bottom of the colonnade. He sees:
A GROUP OF TOURISTS, posing for a photo by the bridge -
and just beyond this -
A STREET SELLER hawking souvenirs from a PUSH CART.
BOND approaches the TOURIST with the camera, offering to take the
picture for him.
BOND
Prego, prego. Permissio.
TOURIST
Grazie.
Bond takes the camera. The tourists pose. And with perfect timing,
Bond turns, and - POP! - sets off the FLASHBULB in THUG #l's face
just as he comes around the corner.
Bond flips the camera back to the tourist -
BOND
Grazie -
And heads for the PUSHCART. Wheeling it around, he SHOVES IT at the
thug, who is still stumbling, blinded by the flashbulb.
The CART SLAMS INTO THE MAN, knocking him on his back. The cart
stops on top of him, pinning him down.
BOND takes off, threading through the crowd toward a SIDESTREET.
Meanwhile, THE STREET SELLER rushes to his wrecked cart. It ERUPTS
in the air as Thug #1 jumps to his feet. He's getting really pissed
off. He looks around for Bond - just catching a glimpse of him, as -
007 disappears down the sidestreet.
Thug #1 makes a bee-line for Bond - but finds his path blocked by TWO
MOTORCYCLISTS, chatting away. Barely stopping, Thug #1 lifts one of
the motorcycles - with the driver still in the seat - and THROWS IT
INTO THE CANAL.
RETURN ON THE BASE OF THE BRIDGE -
Stamper and Thug #2 arrive at the wrecked cart - in time to see Thug
#1 disappear onto the side Street.
Stamper motions for Thug #2 to come with him on a parallel course
along the canals toward -
THE PLAZA SAN SALVATORE - NIGHT
Bond enters the deserted plaza from the side-street. Sticking close
to the buildings, he ducks into an alleyway.
ALLEYWAY - OFF THE PLAZA SAN SALVATORE -
Shrinking back into the shadows, Bond peers out into the Plaza.
BOND'S POV - THE PLAZA
Stamper and Thug 2 charge in. Bond watches as they split up and
start looking for him.
RETURN ON BOND - IN THE SHADOWS -
Suddenly, a huge hand grabs 007's shoulder, spinning him around:
THUG #1 has Bond in his grasp, with murder his eyes. In one fast
move, Bond side-steps, ducks, and twists out of the cloak, throwing
it over the Thug's head. And as the Thug struggles to get out from
under it, Bond slams him head-first into a wall, knocking him out.
(He's left sitting upright, slumped against the wall.)
NEW ANGLE -
Bond heads off down the alleyway, away from the Plaza, toward the
courtyard of Il Bovolo.
RETURN ON ALLEYWAY ENTRANCE -
Thug #2 enters, spots the figure in Bond's cloak. Very quietly, he
pulls out his gun, kneels... And as he brings the gun up to the
cloaked figure's head, chambering a round -
The cloak erupts, with Thug #1 viciously biting Thug #2's gun-hand,
hurling him against the opposite wall.
With a frustrated fury, Thug #1 rips off the cloak, and stands.
THUG #2
Marco - I didn't know -
THUG #1
After him!
They charge off.
IL BOVOLO - COURTYARD - NIGHT
Bond enters from the alley, scans the courtyard: Three walls. No
way out... Save for a SPIRAL STAIRCASE that leads up to the FOURTH
FLOOR INTERIOR BALCONY, overlooking the courtyard.
THE SPIRAL STAIRS -
Bond takes the marble steps, two at a time.
RETURN ON THE COURTYARD -
The two Thugs enter the square. Motioning for quiet, they HEAR
BOND'S FOOTFALLS on the steps, and race up after him.
THE BALCONY -
Coming off the staircase, Bond tries the doors to the interior of the
building: Locked. Too heavy to burst in. He glances down at the
courtyard, and HEARS THE THUGS' FOOTSTEPS running up the stairs.
Bond glances up to the roof, just above his head: The only escape.
Pocketing his mask, Bond hops on the BANISTER, REACHES for the
GUTTER. He pulls himself up, throws a leg over - onto the roof, and
disappears from sight...
Just as the Thugs enter the balcony from the staircase.
FIRST ROOFTOP -
Bond scurries along the steeply pitched terra-cotta roof. There are
SHEER DROPS on three sides - but the fourth side is a one-story drop
to an adjoining building. Bond jumps.
SECOND (LOWER) ROOFTOP -
007 lands on another steeply pitched roof; unable to get a foothold
on the tiles, he slides down, rolling to the edge. He looks down:
The adjoining building is one story lower, with a skylight roof.
As Bond struggles to climb back to the peak of the second roof -
RETURN ON THE BALCONY -
Thug #1 holsters his gun, and climbs on the banister. He's too heavy
to climb onto the roof by himself - so Thug #2 shoves him from below.
FIRST ROOFTOP -
Thug #1 searches for Bond. He HEARS BOND moving, below him, on the
next building. He makes a running leap.
SECOND (LOWER) ROOFTOP -
Bond has hauled himself up to a crouch as Thug #1 lands. They
grapple. The Thug sends Bond sliding down toward the edge of the
roof, then loses his balance, and slides down after Bond.
AT THE EDGE OF THE ROOF, Bond is about to slide off, onto the
skylight below, but GRABS THE COPPER GUTTER at the last moment.
007 is now hanging, fifteen feet above a glass skylight... As Thug #1
tumbles off the edge of the roof, and saves himself by GRABBING ONTO
BOND'S LEGS.
They sway in the air for a second. The GUTTER bends, breaks, and the
two of them fall -
CRASHING THROUGH THE GLASS SKYLIGHT, INTO: -
VENICE MEDIEVAL ARMOR MUSEUM - NIGHT.
They land in a shower of glass on the grand banquet table in the
Great Hall. Bond is winded. Thug #1, unfazed. He grabs Bond by the
collar, hauling him up on his feet.
Thug #1 shoves the nose of his gun under Bond's chin, forcing 007 up
on his toes. Snarling, he thrusts his face menacingly close to Bond:
THUG #1
I owe you some pain.
With lightning speed, Bond: 1) Grasps the Thug's elbow and yanks his
gun arm forward, as, 2) Bond pitches his head back. Bond's chin just
clears the barrel as THE GUN FIRES INTO THE CEILING.
The flash momentarily blinds Thug #1. Bond snatches a CANDELABRA,
and smashes it against the Thug's arm, knocking the gun away.
As BOND DRAWS HIS WALTHER, the Thug grabs Bond's wrist, and brutally
(yet effortlessly) SQUEEZES THE GUN from 007's hand, ONTO THE FLOOR.
With a sick smile, the Thug tosses Bond into a corner of the room.
He's having fun.
AS BOND STAGGERS, PICKING HIMSELF UP FROM THE CORNER -
THUG #1 tosses aside a massive table and chairs to get at Bond.
BOND shoves a SUIT OF ARMOR (on wheels) at Thug #1 - who bats it out
of the way, like a gnat.
Concerned this might be getting serious, BOND grabs an OAK LEG from
the shattered table. He wields it like a bat, to ward off the Thug.
Unimpressed, the THUG SMASHES HIS FIST INTO a GLASS DISPLAY TABLE,
and plucks out a CLAYMORE - a two-handed "King Arthur" type sword.
With one roundhouse blow, THUG #1 SLICES BOND'S TABLE LEG IN TWO.
The Thug swings the Claymore a second time, forcing Bond back to:
A DISPLAY WALL -
filled with pole weapons. Bond snatches a lethal-looking HALBERD.
(Ax, fluke and spike on a staff.) Thug #1 stops in his tracks.
Drops the Claymore. Grabs a pole-ax.
THE TWO MEN face off in a short, furious battle, which ends with Thug
#1 shattering Bond's Halberd with the pole-ax.
NEW ANGLE -
Gripping the pole-ax horizontally in both hands, Thug #1 forces Bond
backward, to a SECOND DISPLAY WALL that features AN IRON MAIDEN.
(Something like a hinged sarcophagus, lined with spikes.)
Thug #1 tries to push 007 into the case, but Bond side-steps at the
last minute. Thug #1 lurches forward, and is only stopped from
killing himself by the pole-ax hitting the sides of the iron maiden.
As Thug #1 steps back, Bond grabs a MORNING-STAR from the wall. (A
studded iron ball on a chain attached to a club)
Bond swings the Morning-Star down, SNAPPING THUG #1'S POLE-AX IN
TWO... But loses the weapon in the process.
Now, Thug #1 lunges for Bond's throat. Grappling, they slam into the
wall next to the IRON MAIDEN - which is STARTING TO COME LOOSE FROM
THE LEATHER STRAPS holding it upright.
-
In a near death-grip, Bond manages to push/kick/smash Thug #1
backwards, down onto the floor.
AND AS BOND REACHES UP FOR ANOTHER WEAPON - A HAND-AX -
THUG #1 LUNGES FOR BOND'S GUN ON THE FLOOR.
BOND CAN'T GET THE HAND-AX OFF THE WALL. HE TURNS TO SEE:
THUG #1 ABOUT TO SHOOT HIM.
And at the very last second, BOND DISLODGES THE HAND-AX, SLASHES THE
IRON MAIDEN'S LEATHER RETAINING STRAPS and -
NEW ANGLE - FROM INSIDE THE IRON MAIDEN'S POV -
The iron maiden falls forward, impaling Thug #1 on the wooden floor.
RETURN TO SCENE -
The Iron Maiden covers all of Thug #1, except for his arm, still
clutching Bond's gun. Bond bends down and retrieves it.
BOND
He fought hard...
(holstering the gun)
But the case was terminal.
And on this note, we -
DISSOLVE TO:
Under a beautiful blue sky, the gleaming white SEA DOLPHIN II sits at
dock, festooned with pennants and banners. There's a crowd onboard.
At the same time, however, 500 feet away...
Bond rushes down the gangplank, along the dock. Jumps in a gondola.
BOND
The Danielli. Presto!
RETURN ON THE METALLURGY LAB -
Harmsway closes the door. Yung is there.
YUNG
That was too close.
HARMSWAY
Don't worry. Mr. Bond will get the
message. So will his boss.
Harmsway presses a button - and suddenly the red box lifts, and a
second red box appears underneath it, like shuffling a deck of cards.
HARMSWAY
I'm going to the plane. Tell the
captain to set sail at once.
Bond jumps out of the gondola, sprints into the lobby.
FOURTH FLOOR CORRIDOR -
Bond appears, rushing up a staircase. He comes to his doorway. It's
closed, but unlocked.
Paris Harmsway is dead, floating in the water.
RETURN ON BOND -
Crushed. Devastated. And to make matters worse:
DiGIACOMO'S VOICE
Signore Bond?
Bond turns. A flashbulb goes off, capturing Bond and DiGiacomo.
DiGIACOMO
You're under arrest.
CUT TO:
THE SOUTH CHINA SEA - DUSK
The HMS INDOMITABLE - a 3,300 ton British frigate, surges through the
water, heading toward the setting sun.
CLOSER -
BATTLE-DRESSED ROYAL MARINES patrol the deck; GUNNERY CREWS man the
weapons. Whatever is going on here, it's not business as usual.'
THE BAGPIPE AND DRUM CORPS of the Royal Highland Regiment (aka the
"Black Watch") is playing a FUNERAL DIRGE outside a vast stone house,
with a HARMSWAY NEWS HELICOPTER on the lawn, and LIMOUSINES, A HEARSE
and a FLOWER CAR in the driveway.
SIX MEN IN FORMAL MOURNING ATTIRE are entering the house.
Stamper holds the back door open for Number Three. He gets in.
Number Three fidgets in the back... And notices Stamper smiling at
him in the REARVIEW MIRROR. He sees Stamper reach INTO HIS JACKET -
and PANICS! Is he going to get shot? Is it over? He winces, as -
STAMPER'S HAND SUDDENLY THRUSTS BACKWARD THROUGH THE PARTITION.
STAMPER
Gum?
Shaking his head, he pulls out a HANDKERCHIEF to mop the flop sweat.
RETURN ON THE MANOR HOUSE - FAVORING THE HNN HELICOPTER -
Amidst ad-libbed 'good-bye's" from the gang of six (now five,)
Harmsway gets in the waiting HNN chopper. It powers up, takes off.
Stamper's limousine parks near a Gulfstream jet. He opens the back
door for Number Three. At last, the man believes he is safe.
NUMBER THREE
Thank you! Thank you so much. You
must thank Sir Elliot for me.
STAMPER
(producing a NEWSPAPER)
Here. Something to read on the plane.
Stamper TUCKS THE PAPER FIRMLY UNDER #3'S ARM - and gives him a
friendly pat on the back, sending him up the stairs.
At the doorway, Number Three looks back. Stamper smiles, waving:
STAMPER
Bye-bye.
As the earth turns below, a TINY SILVER DOT appears in the distance:
A COMMUNICATIONS SATELLITE, spinning slowly on its axis.
It comes closer and closer to camera, until it FILLS THE SCREEN, and
the LOGO on its body ROTATES INTO VIEW:
HNN. THE HARMSWAY NEWS NETWORK.
The ship is moving towards a DARK VERTICAL SHAPE - Harmsway's SEA-BED
CORE BORING DRILL (shorthand "THE WORM',) attached to a long flexible
dredging pipe.
CLOSER - THE HEAD OF THE WORM -
Motionless, hanging in the water. Then the monster awakes: A metal
sphere retracts, revealing a wide angle CAMERA LENS.
Propelled by water-jets in its head, THE WORM STREAKS TOWARD THE
INDOMITABLE, emitting a HIGH PITCHED whine as its drill bit revs up
to speed. The drill's BLACK TEETH glisten in the water.
THE WORM'S POV - (UNDERWATER, NIGHT)
Closing in on the hull like a torpedo. It gets closer, picking up
speed, until - on IMPACT -
Bow rises completely out of the water as the stern goes under.
TWO CREWMAN manage to get a LIFEBOAT away. TWO OTHERS scramble up
from below and leap into the water.
WIDER
The bow is at a forty-five degree angle... And the H.M.S.
Indomitable pauses - for just a moment - before SLIPPING UNDER, STERN
FIRST, throwing up a series of great waves.
Rocked by waves from the sinking ship. The Cook, a Marine, and Three
Crewmen hear a splash along side. Two of the Crew pull the SONAR
OFFICER aboard. He takes a minute to catch his breath, then:
SONAR OPERATOR
Six. That's it? Only six of us?
COOK
Most of the crew never made it to
their life jackets. The Captain?
SONAR OFFICER
(shrugs, then:)
The First officer stayed on the bridge.
One of the CREWMAN SPOTS SOMETHING IN THE DISTANCE:
CREWMAN
Hey - look! Over there!
NEW ANGLE - (ROCK OUTCROPPING - STRAIT OF MALACCA - NIGHT)
The SEA DOLPHIN II emerges from a cove, looking like a ghostly white
apparition in the fog.
RETURN ON THE LIFEBOAT -
The men yell and wave and whistle, hoping to be saved.
CLOSER ON THE SEA DOLPHIN II - DECK -
Elliot Harmsway removes a pair of binoculars from his face. Turns to
YUNG, standing next to him at the rail:
HARMSWAY
Lovely night for a shipwreck, isn't it?
Yung looks at Harmsway like he's crazy. Oblivious, Harmsway looks at
his WATCH, then looks through the BINOCULARS again - and begins to
WHISTLE the opening notes of My Fair Lady's "WOULDN'T IT BE LOVERLY."
("All I want is a room somewhere, far away from the cold night air")
THE LIFEBOAT -
As the men cry for help, the Sonar Operator spots something just
below the surface, moving toward the lifeboat at great speed.
He hears the hum. His eyes follow the churning water...
And suddenly - out of nowhere - the Worm hits the lifeboat from
below, smashing it to bits, hurtling the pieces in the air.
THE SEA DOLPHIN II -
Harmsway lowers the binoculars' smiling. Stamper appears, hands
Harmsway a piece of paper.
STAMPER
We've decoded their last transmission.
Harmsway studies it for a moment - smiles.
HARMSWAY
Perfect. They'll be searching miles from here.
(then)
Time for phase two. You can get the
men in the water.
And with this, Harmsway turns, and walks off, jauntily whistling
"Wouldn't It Be Loverly."
Stamper looks at Yung, re: Harmsway's glee.
YUNG
You heard him. Get the men in the water!
NEW ANGLE - SIDE OF THE SEA DOLPHIN II - NIGHT -
In the water next to the chip, FOUR DIVERS drop the last of their
equipment in a DIVE BOAT. They cast off, motoring into the fog.
The classic Michelin building on Fulham road.
Passing a NEWSPAPER DELIVERY TRUCK with an ad for "TOMORROW" ("The
Paper that Never Lies,") Bond's DB-5 roars past the guard.
Foreground, empty diving boat. Background, Sea Dolphin II, with the
"flexible hose" hanging over the rail, down into the water.
The worm follows the Divers into the hull.
Harmsway walks along the side of the ship, observing the operation:
The WORM'S DREDGING PUMP sucks up the ground-up GOLD AND WATER SLUR-
RY, (through the TUBE hanging over the side,) and dumps it into a
SERIES OF SLUICES. At each stage the gold nuggets fall to the bottom
of the sluice, and excess water flows off the side of the ship.
AT THE STERN HOLD -
where all the water has been drained off, leaving a cascade of gold
nuggets pouring into the ship's hold -
HARMSWAY reaches into the shimmering cascade, and takes a hand-full
of gold. He sees Stamper approaching.
HARMSWAY
Remember the golden rule, Mr.
Stamper: He who has the gold, rules.
He drops the gold back in the hold.
HARMSWAY
Is the helicopter ready?
STAMPER
Fueled and waiting.
HARMSWAY
Good. We have an appointment in Hong Kong.
M
I've already contacted our station in
Kuala Lumpur. They're lining up a
local contact.
(beat)
I want you to find that gold, and
secure it.
They've arrived at her car. The door is already open.
BOND
... Didn't Elliot Harmsway just move
his headquarters to Kuala Lumpur?
She turns, freezes Bond with a look:
M
Contrary to what you may believe,
007, the world is not filled with
mad-men who can hollow out volcanoes,
stock them with big-breasted women,
and threaten the world with nuclear
annihilation.
Bond reacts to the comeuppance. She continues:
M (cont'd)
The case is closed. The Italian
authorities ruled the girl a suicide.
We had enough trouble keeping your
name out of the media. For
everyone's sake -
(beat)
Your job is to find the gold. Not
settle some personal score with
Elliot Harmsway.
Super: HONG KONG. Harmsway's helicopter is perched atop the famous
tinker-toy-styled building in the Central district.
Under the whirring blades of the chopper, Harmsway bids farewell to
General Li. He and Stamper get in helicopter.
CLOSE ON THE HELICOPTER -
As Harmsway waves good-bye from the window, the helicopter rises,
REVEALING a METAL CABLE attached to the LANDING SKID.
WIDER -
The cable leads to a spool, which runs to the FIFTH METAL VENTILATION
SHAFT Harmsway referred to in the last scene.
The chopper hovers above the HNN boat -
PILOT (on pa speaker)
Please leave the area. please leave
the area.
We're looking up at the world's tallest building: The 1500' twin
Petronas Towers. (They look like an architectural collaboration
between Friz Lang and H.G. Wells.) At the 50th floor, there's a sky
bridge connecting the buildings, where -
The Sea King comes in above several police cars and boats. Bond
jumps the last ten feet, and the chopper peels off.
MALE VOICE (O.S.)
Yo! Jimbo!
Bond turns to look: It's JACK WADE.
BOND
Wade, what the hell are you doing here?
WADE
I am not here, ol' buddy. The CIA has
absolutely no knowledge of the
missing ship, the missing gold, where
it was going, or when it left Hong
Kong.
BOND
That's reassuring.
WADE
Hey - the world is my office.
BOND
Let's take a look at the body.
As Bond moves off, WADE SNIFFS THE AIR, savoring the aroma:
WADE
Smells like... Coffee plants.
NEW ANGLE -
A POLICEMEN pulls a white sheet from the body. (We don't see it.)
Bond and Wade look down at something gruesome:
WADE
Colorful... Shark attack?
Bond shakes his head grimly.
BOND
I don't think so. The veins are
cauterized - as if they were sealed
by heat...
(beat, confounded)
But there are no burn marks on the
flesh. It doesn't make sense.
(to the policeman)
Who found the body?
POLICE OFFICER
(points to)
Dato. Local fisherman. Says it came
in with the tide early this morning.
BOND
Ask him if it could have washed in
from the west side of the Strait.
The POLICEMAN has an animated conversation with FISHERMAN. Then:
POLICEMAN
No. He says it's not possible. The
current could have only brought the
body in from the east.
BOND
(to Wade)
You have a boat?
WADE
I don't know if you'd call it a boat...
BOND
Something with an engine? Not oars?
WADE
Step into my office.
Smashing through the water at breakneck speed. Wade and Bond yell
over the engines.
WADE
What do you want with the Harbor Master?
BOND
Tide and current charts. Work
backward from the body - find where
the ship sank.
(Wade nods appreciatively)
Where did you get the boat?
WADE
Seized it from a guy smuggling
computer chips out of Bangkok.
(beat)
Should have seen his rose garden:
Blooms the size of hand grenades.
Bond looks at Wade: The man remains, forever deranged.
The Harbor Master's tower overlooks a small armada of yachts, fishing
boats, etc. A series of long dockways jut out into the harbor.
CIGARETTE BOAT - (PORT KLANG - WATERWAY) - DAY
Wade's boat is moving slowly along the waterway at the end of the
docks. Looking off, Bond spots the Harbor Master's Tower:
BOND
Over there.
Wade turns the boat down one of the dock channels.
NEW ANGLE - WADE/BOND'S POV - DOCKWAY CHANNEL -
A SLEEK LAUNCH is ROARING TOWARDS them, on a dead collision course.
A WOMAN in a baseball cap is at the wheel.
WADE pulls his boat to the right; the LAUNCH ROARS AROUND THEM,
rocking the cigarette boat with its wake.
BOTH BOND and WADE clock the woman - who we will later learn is
SIDNEY WINCH. Wade stares after her:
WADE
I think I've just seen my next future
ex-wife.
BOND
(seeing they're about to crash)
Not if you kill us first - unless
that's how you plan to leave Muffy.
Wade scowls, setting the boat back on course.
DOCKSIDE - PORT KLANG - DAY -
Bond hops off the boat, securing the lines. Wade joins him.
WADE
By the way, Jimbo - whatever happened
to that girl - in Cuba - ?
Finished tying the boat, they walk toward the Harbor Master's office.
BOND
Natalya?
WADE
Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.
BOND
She married a hockey player.
WADE
I envy your 'undercover' assignments.
BOND
(a look, then)
We work in the dark. We do what we can.
Bond emerges, carrying the charts, along with Wade.
BOND
I have to get these to London. Do
you know this Captain Cheong?
WADE
Spends his nights at the Kuala Lumpur
yacht club.
BOND
Can you arrange a meeting?
WADE
Hell. The CIA built that club.
Palm trees, torch lights, and Rolls Royces.
Bond walks down a long dock towards a lone boat, moored at the end.
Bond looks around furtively, before climbing aboard the sleek ocean-
going craft. On the aft-deck, there's a large covered object.
As Bond reaches for the CABIN DOOR, it opens by itself - and a
succession of THREE YOUNG ENGLISH WOMEN in STRING BIKINIS emerge.
GIRL ONE
Good morning!
GIRL TWO
Good morning.
GIRL THREE
(calling back into the cabin)
He's arrived.
Bond turns from the door to watch the women. He hears:
Q'S VOICE
You're late 007. I've been expecting
you.
Q emerges from the cabin in a blazer and an ascot. He's irritated:
BOND
Q! How are you?
Q
Retired. I'm not getting paid to
help you save the world anymore.
BOND
I'm sorry. It was a national emergency -
Q
That hardly makes up for the imposition.
(beat)
Now, for what I hope will be the very
last time - pay attention, 007.
(he unfurls a map:)
First, computer generated retrograde
analysis map. Body here, meteorolog-
ical influences here, likely vector-
ing of the ship's coordinates here.
BOND
Do you have any idea of what any of
that means? In English?
Q
Not a clue. I didn't lose the ship.
(reaches for a Filofax sized device)
Next, your new personal communicator.
(flips it open)
Picture-phone, fax, beeper.
BOND
(taking it)
Do I have to dial '9' to get out?
Q
I don't care who you dial, so long as
it's not me. Next -
Q walks to the large object on the aft-deck. Pulls off a tarp:
Q
Your new car. (Insert name)
BOND
(interrupting)
- Four wheel drive?
Q
Yes. And do try to keep all four of
them on the road.
(continuing)
All the usual refinements: Smoke,
missiles, machine guns -
(shows him a key fob)
Fully operational remote control.
Drives forward, reverse -
(Bond presses a button,
opening a window)
Stop that!
(grabbing it away)
Plus infrared thermal imaging radar,
heads up instrumentation, and 17
beverage cup holders.
BOND
... 17 Beverage cup holders?
Q
Standard equipment. The world's
automobile manufacturers seem to be
in some kind of mad war to see who
can provide the most beverage cup
holders.
Bond nods, and LOOKS AT a distraction from the GIRLS IN BIKINIS.
BOND
I must say, Q, you seem to be doing
rather well in your retirement.
Q
Don't even think about it. 007.
They're my granddaughters.
STRAIT OF MALACCA - DAY -
Clear skies and blue water. The only vessel in sight is a thirty-
five foot SPORT FISHING BOAT underway at full throttle.
Wade at the helm; Bond next to him, near sonar, holding Q's map.
BOND
Slow down. We're close.
Wade pulls back on the throttle.
AERIAL - (SPORT FISHING BOAT/STRAIT OF MALACCA) - DAY -
The boat starts a wide turn -
NEW ANGLE - (SPORT FISHING BOAT/ROCK OUTCROPPING/STRAIT) - DAY -
And we're back at the outcropping where the Indomitable sank. The
SPORT FISHING BOAT is trolling against a background of sandy beaches
and the lush green hills of Sumatra.
FLYING BRIDGE -
Wade scans the shore; Bond studies the sonar display.
WADE
I dunno, Jimbo. It can't be out
here. How could they get this far
off course?
BOND
(concentrating on the sonar)
Who knows? Fog, night...
WADE
They'd never sail this close to the shore.
BOND
Wait a minute -
(beat, pointing to the
screen)
I've got it. There! Off the port bow!
INSERT SONAR SCREEN -
The murky electronic outline of a ship.
BACK TO SCENE -
Bond watches the sonar screen. Wade slows engines, consults charts.
BOND
Cut the engines! It's about two-
hundred fifty feet down.
JUMP CUT TO:
AN ANCHOR BEING PITCHED INTO THE WATER - (BOW OF SPORT FISHING BOAT) -
By Wade. Bond is strapping on his scuba tank.
WADE
Two-fifty's pretty deep for air. You
should really be using mixed gases.
Bond glances at the air gauge on his tanks.
BOND
I'll make a bounce dive. If I can
keep my bottom time short, I'll be
all right.
Bond gathers up FLARES, and sits on the gunwale.
BOND
(only half teasing)
Keep your eye out for pirates.
Wade pulls back his shirt to reveal TWO SIX-SHOOTERS.
WADE
I got you covered.
BOND
That's reassuring.
Bond rolls backward into the water and disappears.
UNDERWATER -
Bond swims to the anchor line, and begins pulling himself downward,
handover-hand, deeper and deeper into a monochromatic gloom.
UNDERWATER BOTTOM -
Bond touches down by the anchor; his fins kick up the sandy bottom.
Checking his wrist compass, he sets off through a rocky channel.
Ahead, in the dimness, a huge gray shape looms out of the sand.
Bond lights a FLARE, and the scene is suddenly alive with color.
From Bond's position, the hull seems to go on forever before being
lost beyond range of his flare. Bond checks his air gauge.
INSERT GAUGES -
Depth: 283 feet - Air capacity: 3/4 tank remaining.
BACK TO SCENE -
Bond swims to the hole in the side of the Indomitable. He pauses to
study the damage. Then enters.
The net erupts through the surface, is hauled up into the air, and
deposited on -
THE DECK OF A SELF-PROPELLED SALVAGE BARGE.
(An old scow, with a large crane, two-story deck-house, and a crew
whose idea of 'cruise-wear' runs to tattoos and grotesque scars.
BOND'S POV - THROUGH HIS DIVING MASK -
As the water drains from his mask, Bond sees the mesh being pulled
away, and FIVE GOONS come into focus, training AUTOMATIC WEAPONS on
him. (Bond still has the diver from behind, knife to his throat.)
One of the goons reaches forward, ripping off Bond's mask. 007 sees:
Brandishing an UZI at Bond, with a malevolent smile:
TARO
Uzi beats knife.
BOND
...Interesting point.
Bond sticks the knife into the deck, and releases the hostage.
TARO
Get him up. Take his belt.
(motioning to Wade)
Take the two of them to the Captain.
The men grab Bond roughly, and shove him next to Wade.
TARO
By the way. I almost forgot.
(smashing Bond)
I owed you one.
Bond and Wade are frog-marched to the bridge, passing under the gaze
of various cutthroat crew members. Wade is completely unfazed.
WADE
(sniffs the air)
Smell that Jimmy? Sea Kelp.
Bond gives Wade a look.
WADE
Hey - it could be worse. At least
they speak English.
Bond glances up at a crew member, SHARPENING A MACHETE, smiling.
BOND
...Somehow, that's not reassuring.
A BRITISH NAVAL CUTTER is pulling alongside the barge - SEA SIREN
WAILING, crew members in battle gear, FORWARD GATLING GUN manned.
CAPTAIN MORTON
(on bullhorn)
Attention sea barge: Lay down your
weapons, and prepare to be boarded.
ON THE BARGE - Sidney and Co. stand, weapons ready.
CAPTAIN MORTON
Repeat: Lay down your weapons, and
prepare to be boarded.
Bond turns to Sidney, who's grabbed a bullhorn of her own.
BOND
If I were you -
SIDNEY
- You're not.
BOND
(as she hoists the bullhorn)
Just remember: They think there's ten
billion dollars in gold down there.
SIDNEY
Thank you.
(clicks it on, and:)
"Now hear this: Drop dead."
Bond and Wade exchange an amused/helpless glance - as if they both
know what's coming next. There's a pause, then -
THE CRUISER'S GATLING GUN ERUPTS WITH AN EARDRUM-SHATTERING SALVO.
It's only a warning shot, but -
EVERYONE ON THE BARGE DIVES FOR THE DECK... Except for Bond and
Wade, who might as well be having tea. Bond looks down at Taro,
cowering on the boards.
BOND
Gatling gun beats Uzi.
NEW ANGLE - (CUTTER/BARGE) - DAY
An ARMED BOARDING PARTY is coming across an aluminum bridge that has
extended from the Cutter onto the barge.
CAPTAIN MORTON
(a tiny popinjay)
Who's in charge here?
SIDNEY
I am. What do you want?
CAPTAIN MORTON
You have precisely one minute to pull
up your anchor and be under way.
SIDNEY
Forget it. No way. I got here first.
CAPTAIN MORTON
(ignoring her)
Who's Wade?
WADE
That would be me -
CAPTAIN MORTON
(snidely)
Thanks for your message.
(turns to)
And you're Bond?
BOND
Yes -
CAPTAIN MORTON
Guard! Arrest these men! Escort
them to the cutter!
Bond and Wade are stunned. The Marines move in. Bond struggles -
BOND
Wait a minute -
CAPTAIN MORTON
Get them out of here. If he says one
word, shoot him.
As TWO MARINES with automatic rifles take Bond and Wade across the
folding bridge -
SIDNEY
(demanding)
What's your name?
CAPTAIN MORTON
Captain Morton.
Pause. She expects him to ask "And yours?" but he doesn't.
SIDNEY
My name is Sidney Winch, and -
CAPTAIN MORTON
Good for you, Miss Winch. You now
have exactly 30 seconds to get this
rust bucket out of here.
SIDNEY
(furiously)
I know my rights. These are
international waters. The British
Navy abandoned that boat, and I'm
claiming it. Under international
law, I have the right to salvage
what's on that wreck.
CAPTAIN MORTON
Fifteen seconds. Perhaps you should
consider hiring an attorney.
SIDNEY
I was an attorney!
CAPTAIN MORTON
Hmmm. I suppose this is a step above
that profession.
(beat)
Ten seconds. Are you leaving?
SIDNEY
No.
CAPTAIN MORTON
You leave me no alternative.
CAPTAIN MORTON
(upholstering a walkie-talkie)
Cut her anchor.
As Sidney yells "NO!" - THE FORWARD GATLING GUN erupts to life. One
short, bone rattling burst CUTS THE CHAIN.
SIDNEY
You won't get away with this!
CAPTAIN MORTON
(stepping onto the bridge)
Good-day, Miss Winch. I advise you
to get some steam up - before you run
aground.
As she floats away, Sidney calls out to the Captain, Bond and Wade:
SIDNEY
You bastards! Believe me - you
haven't heard the last of me!
Bond, Wade and the Captain.
WADE
- Nice trick with the arrest. Very convincing.
CAPTAIN MORTON
It's no trick, Mr. Wade. I've got
half a mind to throw both of you in
the brig.
BOND
Don't you think you're overreacting?
CAPTAIN MORTON
(with great sarcasm)
Yes. The famous James Bond. I've heard
all about you, sir. You were under
direct orders to act as an observer -
and yet you had to go off, on your own,
like some half-assed CIA cowboy -
(Wade reacts)
Endangering the gold, attracting that
lunatic woman, and then putting in a
distress call for us to save your
bloody hide.
BOND
(Calmly)
...That's all well and good, Captain,
save for one thing:
(beat)
There's no gold down there.
CAPTAIN MORTON
What are you talking about? We went
through all this and the ship isn't
even down there?
BOND
Yes, the ship is down there. But the
gold is gone.
CAPTAIN MORTON
That's absurd! It took two squads of
forty men fifteen days to load that
gold.
BOND
I know what I saw -
CAPTAIN
I don't care what you think you saw.
You're a damned amateur.
(beat)
Just get off my ship. Go back to
your trench-coats and your code names
- and leave the job to professionals.
BOND
(exchanges a glance with Wade, then)
Aye-aye, Captain.
As Bond and Wade push away from the Naval Cutter:
WADE
Where to now, Jimbo?
BOND
(thinking)
I'm not certain... But I think
there's someone I want to press for
some answers in Kuala Lumpur.
Bond'- car travels through the tropical landscape, turning at a sign
for Kuala Lumpur.
Bond's car approaches the camera, passes it, and heads for HARMSWAY
TOWERS, looming over Kuala Lumpur in the distance.
Bond's car passes the front of the building, and drives down a ramp
into an underground car park.
Bond and the PR Woman step off an escalator onto an open arcade with
GLASS WINDOWS looking down into a mammoth NEWSPAPER PRINTING PLANT.
PR WOMAN
(moving to a door)
Mr. Harmsway is checking the afternoon
editions. If you'll just follow me -
Five floors directly down is the GLASS-ENCLOSED SKY BRIDGE; just
above him, he sees TWO WINDOW WASHERS being pulled up on a TWO MAN
SCAFFOLD.
BACK TO SCENE -
A CHIME SOUNDS; the elevator doors open. Bond and Sidney ad-lib
good-byes to the secretary and get in.
It's magic hour as Bond and Sidney rush out onto the setback. Bond
sees a WINDOW WASHER'S RIG. And although Sidney asks -
SIDNEY
Now what?
Bond's first concern is to make sure Stamper can't get them. Amidst
a pile of CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT, he spots a PNEUMATIC NAIL GUN. He
grabs it, and -
BANG. BANG. BANG. He fires 3 NAILS through the door into the frame.
BOND
That should buy us some time.
Now, Bond moves to the WINDOW WASHER'S RIG - a two-man bucket-like
scaffold ON TRACKS, with TWO LEATHER SAFETY HARNESSES inside, and a
LARGE CABLE SPOOL/MOTOR that stays on the roof.
Approaching it, Bond looks over the side:
BOND'S POV - LOOKING DOWN FROM 72ND FLOOR -
Twenty stories below is the sky bridge. 50 stories below that, the
ground. It's a long, long, way down.
RETURN ON BOND - AT THE WINDOW WASHER'S RIG - TERRACE SET-BACK -
BOND
Help me move this.
Bond is positioning the window washer rig. He explains:
BOND
We'll go down close to the sky bridge.
We may be able to swing over and use it
for cover.
As Bond climbs into the bucket, Sidney peers over the side.
SIDNEY
No way. I sail. I do not fly.
BANG! Behind them, Stamper's AX HAS JUST PENETRATED THE DOOR.
BOND
... Sometimes, you just have to take
the plunge.
Bond yanks her in, flips switches on the control pod, and starts
down, as fast as they can go.
Bond and Sidney descend. Tiny specs against the sunset.
Stamper and the guards rush to the ledge.
BOND AND SIDNEY - DESCENDING ON THE RIG - 60TH FLOOR -
Bond, looking up - for Stamper - and down - to check their progress.
SIDNEY
All I know is one thing: If we get
out of here alive, that gold is mine.
(beat)
I've earned it.
Looking upward, Bond SEES STAMPER peering over the rail. BOND FIRES.
BOND
One thing at a time.
Stamper jumps back from the ledge, enraged. Ax in hand, he moves to
the WINDOW WASHING RIG'S MACHINERY -
And takes a roundhouse swing at the UNSPOOLING CABLE - but instead of
cutting it, the ax BOUNCES OFF, and the RIG SLIDES ON ITS TRACKS.
THE RIG - (STILL DESCENDING) -
Swings! Sidney SCREAMS - almost falling out. Bond grabs her. They
are now 5 STORIES DIRECTLY ABOVE THE SKY BRIDGE, swaying like a giant
pendulum - although still descending.
RETURN ON STAMPER - TERRACE SET-BACK - 72ND FLOOR - TWILIGHT -
Having failed at the cable, Stamper goes at the PULLEY feeding it.
He swings. Swings again. With each blow, the pulley shaft weakens.
BOND AND SIDNEY - (WINDOW WASHER'S RIG) -
Dropping in VIOLENT SPURTS - just trying to stay in the damn bucket.
STAMPER - WIELDING THE AX -
Finally, the pulley shaft SHATTERS. THE CABLE GRINDS TO A HALT.
BOND AND SIDNEY -
are stopped about 20 feet above the sky bridge.
SIDNEY
(panicked, anxious, fast)
What now? And don't give me some
movie clich like 'trust me.'
BOND
(what the hell)
Trust me.
And with this, he turns, and SHOOTS OUT the adjacent WINDOW.
BOND
Let's go -
But as he starts to climb out - SIDNEY SCREAMS! THE CABLE SUDDENLY
DROPS THEM 10 FEET LOWER, BELOW THE WINDOW.
THE TERRACE SET-BACK -
Stamper whacks away at the side of the cable drum. It's coming loose
from its moorings.
BOND AND SIDNEY -
look down at the curved glass top of the sky bridge - facing what
(she thinks) is certain death:
SIDNEY
We're going to bounce off that thing!
Bond looks up - assuming they have only seconds left before Stamper
cuts the cable. HE GRABS HER:
BOND
Hold on!
TERRACE SET-BACK - 72ND FLOOR - TWILIGHT -
Stamper takes a final swing at the cable drum. With a GREAT CLAT-
TERING SOUND it SNAPS FREE OF THE MOORINGS, smashes into the wall,
and the whole mechanism CAREENS OVER THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING.
THE WINDOW WASHER'S RIG -
Bond and Sidney feel the cable give way. They start to free-fall.
BOND - FIRES HIS MACHINE PISTOL at the glass top of the sky bridge.
THE BULLETS SHATTER THE GLASS -
BOND AND SIDNEY CRASH THROUGH, INTO -
Bond and Sidney fall from the bridge - 50 stories up.
They go down,
And down,
And down -
Bond and Sidney jerk to a halt. They're swinging about five feet
from the balcony. There's a pause...
SIDNEY
Is this - like - a normal day for you?
BOND
It's a lousy job, but -
(reaching for the balcony)
The only reason I stay is for the
health benefits.
Bond PULLS THEM OVER TO THE BALCONY.
The TAIL-LIGHTS DROP DOWN and MACHINE GUNS start to fire.
It is early morning in this strange harbor - a place where floating
restaurant rise out of the fog; where an old Chinese man wearing an
LA Laker's jersey practices tai-chi on the bow of an ancient junk;
where sampans cut through the chop filled with ducks, computer boxes
and women dressed in Chanel 1996, and Beijing 1256... While the
captains of these small water-taxis chatter away on cell-phones.
At the end of the harbor, dominating this scene, the CAMERA FINDS:
THE FIVE SMOKESTACKS OF THE ABERDEEN HARBOR NUCLEAR POWER PLANT.
Panning down this massive dockside facility, the image changes to:
THE SAME SCENE ON A 5" PORTABLE VIDEO MONITOR -
With one important difference: There's an HNN logo in lower corner.
ASIAN MALE NEWS REPORTER (VO)
As part of our continuing report on
terrorism, we're outside Hong Kong's
Aberdeen Harbor nuclear power plant...
Two VIDEO CAMERAMEN are shooting an ASIAN HNN REPORTER interviewing a
middle-aged CHINESE MAN. We don't see the reporter's face; from the
"over the shoulder" news angle, he's WEARING A HAT.
(There's also HNN BELL JETRANGER HELICOPTER on the ground, and a
seemingly empty HNN BOAT moored to a nearby pier.)
ASIAN MALE NEWS REPORTER (cont'd)
- Interviewing Mr. David Chin, senior
engineer in charge of security.
(beat)
Tell me, Mr. Chin: How safe is this
plant from a terrorist attack?
He holds out a MICROPHONE to Chin.
CHIN
Totally secure. Without codes, you'd
need a missile to blast through the
front door; you normally can't even get
this close (to the plant) without a full
security clearance.
ASIAN MALE NEWS REPORTER
...Could you say that a little closer
to the microphone?
He pushes the microphone closer to Chin's face:
CHIN
Of course. You'd need -
Suddenly, A PUFF OF WHITE SMOKE EMERGES FROM THE MICROPHONE... And
CHIN COLLAPSES. The HNN reporter TAKES OFF HIS HAT: IT'S YUNG.
YUNG
(to the guards)
Now!
At once, the two cameramen turn: One AIMS his shoulder-mounted video
camera at a SURVEILLANCE CAMERA; the other aims at the FRONT DOOR.
BOOM! ROCKETS shoot out from their lenses, destroying both.
YUNG
Let's go!
As Yung and the cameramen rush forward -
ANGLE ON THE HNN BOAT -
Harmsway emerges from the boat accompanied by two men carrying a box
of equipment. He calls back to TWO MEN who have appeared on deck:
HARMSWAY
Get the machine in the water!
They begin using a hoist to lift one of the "worms" from a hold.
(This one looks like an open-mouthed torpedo, with an antenna on top,
and no flexible tubing attached.)
Stamper is marching Bond and Sidney through the door in handcuffs.
BOND
Sleep well?
SIDNEY
Next time, I do the driving.
Bond gives her a look.
RETURN ON THE CONTROL ROOM -
Harmsway and Yung are locking down at the VIDEO SCREEN of a portable
version of the "worm" controller we saw on the SEA DOLPHIN II.
YUNG
The drill is in the water;
approaching the intake tunnel.
HARMSWAY
Excellent.
Harmsway looks up, hearing:
BOND
I see you're in your natural element,
Harmsway: A room filled with lethal
power...
(beat)
...With a toxic core at its center.
Harmsway smiles at Bond and Sidney, who have entered (handcuffed, at
gun point,) with Stamper and a guard. Harmsway is charming as ever:
HARMSWAY
Do come in Mr. Bond, Sidney...
You're just in time for a nuclear
meltdown!
Coming closer, Sidney struggles against her cuffs, swinging at him -
SIDNEY
You bastard -
Stamper restrains her, while Bond scans the room for an advantage.
He sees a MACHINE PISTOL on the console.
HARMSWAY
Please, Sidney. I'd like to remember
you fondly.
YUNG
(calling from the console)
Approaching the first gate.
HARMSWAY
Start the grinders.
UNDERWATER - POWER PLANT INTAKE TUNNEL -
The "worm" is nearing an iron sluice gate; the eye closes, the
grinders rev, and it starts to eat through the bars.
RETURN ON CONTROL ROOM -
BOND
...So that's what the weapons grade
uranium was for.
HARMSWAY
Precisely, Mr. Bond. In a matter of
minutes, the boring device will
arrive at the core of the reactor...
(beat)
And when the radioactive blades cut
into the plutonium -
BOND
- Instant melt-down.
HARMSWAY
Chernobyl will look like a campfire.
Young calls out again, with a hint of urgency. Bond decides to try
rattling Harmsway - so he can move Closer to the gun, unnoticed.
YUNG
We're through the first gate.
Approaching the second -
BOND
(demanding)
Why, Harmsway? Wasn't stealing the
gold enough?
HARMSWAY
(to Yung)
Bore through.
(to Bond, chuckling)
...They used to say living well was
the best revenge, Mr. Bond.
(beat)
They're wrong.
(beat)
Revenge is the best revenge.
YUNG
Entering the main tunnel - ten
minutes to target -
BOND
(fiercely)
What could you possibly have to be
vengeful for, Harmsway? Still trying
to prove yourself to daddy?
This infuriates Harmsway. Bond moves closer to the gun.
HARMSWAY
Hong Kong, Mr. Bond!
YUNG
You have to leave -
HARMSWAY
(enraged, ignoring Yung)
A hundred and fifty years ago, my
ancestors took this island - a
barren, lifeless rock - and turned it
into the greatest city known to
modern civilization.
(beat)
And now that I'm being forced to give
it back, I intend to return it in
exactly the same condition: A
barren, lifeless rock.
(beat)
The gold is merely reparations -
payment from the spineless British
government who wouldn't listen.
BOND
(to Sidney, glancing at the gun)
... I think Uncle Elliot is having
his own melt-down.
YUNG
Approaching the third gate -
HARMSWAY
Smash through it!
(then)
Laugh all you'd like, Mr. Bond - but
you fit perfectly in to my plans.
(he reaches for a newspaper)
Here. This just in. Newsflash.
Read all about it.
He thrusts an issue of TOMORROW at Bond, holding the top half out as
Bond reads THE HEADLINES, sourly:
BOND
... Hong Kong destroyed by nuclear
meltdown... British agent found in
reactor suspected of sabotage; Harmsway
calls for British government to resign.
Harmsway smiles at Bond:
HARMSWAY
...As the advertising says: Tomorrow
never lies.
BOND
What about the gold?
YUNG
You must go. Now. Otherwise the
boat won't be out of range -
Stamper and the guard appear nervous, itching to leave -
HARMSWAY
Thirty seconds.
(then, to Bond)
That's the most brilliant part of the
plan, Mr. Bond: To save the economy,
I'll let the new British government -
my British government - announce that
the gold was irradiated in Hong Kong
- where no one will be able to touch
it for a hundred years.
(beat)
And just by coincidence:
He turns the paper over and reads/reveals a smaller headline:
HARMSWAY
...Gold mine opens in Vietnam.
(turns to Stamper)
Let's go. Put them in the airlock.
Stamper moves towards Bond and Sidney. Bond edges closer to the gun.
BOND
You'll never get away with it,
Harmsway. Too many people know.
Bond tenses, ready to spring -
HARMSWAY
Who, Mr. Bond? The kooks - the
crazies - the conspiracy theorists?
The Oliver Stones of the world?
(pausing, then, with great scorn:)
I'll publish their books, I'll make
their movies, I'll put them on my TV
shows!
(beat)
They're my bellboys. They carry my
luggage.
Bond moves, but - the guard picks up the gun!!! Bond frowns.
HARMSWAY
Now. Get them in the airlock.
Fortunately, Bond has a back-up plan. As Stamper hustles them off -
BOND
One problem, Harmsway: The girl. And
the handcuffs. They'll give it away.
Harmsway considers this for a second. Sidney takes Bond's arm.
SIDNEY
No. I want to stay with him.
Bond looks at her. He's surprised: In the blink of an eye, he
realizes he's developed feelings for her. He knows that if he could
hold her, he'd kiss her, and whisper "You're a hell of a girl"...
But at the same instant - throwing a glance at Yung - he knows he's
running out of time against the worm, and is better off alone.
HARMSWAY
(breaking the moment, cynically)
How sweet.
SIDNEY
(satto, to Bond)
My timing always was lousy.
BOND
(cold and hard)
I'd rather die alone.
HARMSWAY
Take the girl. Leave the handcuffs.
We'll drown her at sea.
SIDNEY
(to Bond, sarcastically)
Enjoy the rest of your life.
As Stamper pushes Bond into the reactor room airlock, he hears:
HARMSWAY
I'll meet you on the boat, south of
Lantau Island.
With the sound of fire engines approaching in the background, Bond
straps the dead guard into the passenger seat, and takes off.
The HNN boat has pulled alongside the Sea Dolphin II. The gang from
the nuke plant is boarding the larger boat.
(Note: From the air, we should notice that the "gold hold" is now
covered by a steel hatch, and the biggest worm is stored in the open,
hanging from a steel boom.)
THE DECK -
Coming up the ladder first, Harmsway is greeted by the Captain.
HARMSWAY
Any news?
THE CAPTAIN
The call just went out on the Hong
Kong police radio: Fire at the power
plant.
HARMSWAY
(ironically)
Alert the media!
Stamper and Sidney have climbed onto the deck.
STAMPER
What do you want me to do with her?
SIDNEY
- Can't we make a deal? I won't say
anything -
HARMSWAY
(touching her cheek)
You're so cute, my dear.
(beat)
But I'm afraid not.
(to one of the cameramen)
Put her in the storage room.
The cameraman takes her away. Harmsway turns to the captain:
HARMSWAY (CONT'D)
We'll get rid of her when we're in
International waters.
(then)
Set sail, full speed, due south.
I'll be in my cabin. Let me know
when Mr. Yung arrives. We'll break
out the champagne.
Several hundred feet in the air, the helicopter is heading for an
island in the distance.
Stamper bounces himself, handing out AUTOMATIC WEAPONS from an arms
cache hidden inside a DINGHY.
The two cameramen take their M-16's and rush forward, jumping up on
some machinery to climb onto -
THE ROOF OF THE BRIDGE -
They rush forward, and assume positions shooting at Bond.
ANGLE ON THE HELICOPTER -
Taking hits. Bond pivots and turns the chopper, heading straight for
them.
HARMSWAY is trying to make his way up the ladder as the boat
continues to veer out of control. He pauses to look up at:
THE HELICOPTER, GYRATING WILDLY -
With the worm dangling from a boom in the background, he watches:
With the chopper about 15 feet above the gold hold - just barely
under control - Bond opens the door.
He leaps out onto the hatch, and rolls off, disappearing as -
THE CHOPPER CRASHES onto the gold hold, in a GIANT BALL OF FLAME and
twisted metal.
With FLAMING DEBRIS still falling around him, Bond is stealthily
moving down a passageway toward the front of the ship.
(Bond has two goals in mind at this point: First, to neutralize any
threats, and second, to save Sidney if she's still alive.)
Arriving at a BULKHEAD DOOR, Bond checks both directions down the
passageway, then pokes his head inside -
And is SUDDENLY YANKED BACKWARDS, OUT INTO THE PASSAGEWAY, thrown
against a railing.
Bond looks up:
STAMPER stands with a smile on his face. One arm is raised above his
head, grasping the WORM on the swinging boom. The worm is attached
to the boom by a thin metal cable.
STAMPER
You're mine now.
Bond rushes at Stamper, slamming into him. The man doesn't flinch.
With his free hand, he grabs Bond by his shirt, and throws him
against a steel wall. Bond crashes to the deck.
As Bond recovers, Stamper (still smiling) presses a RED BUTTON on a
wall, and THE WORM comes to life.
Stamper closes in on Bond with the worm.
Bond tries to stand, but Stamper flings him back down, pinning Bond
against the wall with his free hand as he -
MANEUVERS THE WORM TOWARDS BOND'S HEAD.
With the cutting blades whirring inches away from Bond's nose -
STAMPER
I'm going to do this slowly -
Bond executes a scissor kick to Stamper's ankles. Stamper tumbles
sideways. Bond rolls away from the worm -
But by the time Bond gets to his feet, Stamper has recovered, and is
rushing at Bond full force, with the worm.
Stamper thrusts the worm at Bond once. Bond ducks. The worm chews
into the wall.
Pulling the device back, Stamper thrusts a second time - (same
action,) then a third (same action) - still missing Bond.
INSERT - CLOSE ON THE CABLE SPOOL/CABLE -
With all the yanking and pulling, a loop of slack has developed in
the cable, on the ground.
RETURN TO SCENE -
Stamper is about to attack Bond a fourth time when Bond kicks him in
the groin. Stamper doubles over in pain -
And the worm FLIES OUT OF HIS HAND, swinging on the boom OVER THE
SIDE OF THE SHIP.
UNDERWATER -
The grinders propel the worm forward, into the hull.
As Stamper straightens up, winded from the groin kick -
HARMSWAY'S VOICE
(continuing, on Stamper's radio)
Report to the bridge!
BOND rushes to A SMALL PILE OF SLACK CABLE, which is rapidly growing
taught as the worm wends its way underwater.
Stamper rushes Bond -
And in one lightening fast move, Bond wraps the cable twice around
Stamper's neck.
Suddenly THE CABLE TIGHTENS, and -
STAMPER soars 15 in the air, HANGING BY HIS NECK, as -
As the boat rocks, Bond steadies himself, then starts for the bridge,
using the same route as the cameramen lifted by the chopper:
First climbing up on some machinery, then up onto the bridge roof.
The boat is sinking. Bond is running across the bridge roof, when:
THE BOAT SUDDENLY LISTS TO THE STARBOARD SIDE.
