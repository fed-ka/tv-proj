  The sun hangs low. BATIATUS and LUCRETIA stand proud atop 
  the balcony, which brims with ROMAN ELITE. DOMITIA, 
  NUMERIUS, AEMILIA and her husband SEXTUS among them. 
  ILITHYIA is at Lucretia's side, a forced smile gracing her 
  lips. ASHUR hovers near Batiatus, ever the loyal dog. MIRA 
  and AURELIA serve wine and food in the background.

  SPARTACUS, AGRON, DURO, CRIXUS, and the other Gladiators are 
  on display in the training square. All are in CHAINS, under 
  the watchful eye of DOCTORE. GUARDS and several of GLABER'S 
  MEN, led by IOVIS, are stationed to keep the gladiators in 
  check. Spartacus is fixed on Batiatus as he addresses the 
  crowd.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The noble House of Batiatus stands 
                        deeply humbled! Humbled by the 
                        blessings the gods have seen fit to 
                        shower upon us. And by the presence 
                      of the most revered citizens in all 
                      of Capua, come to join in 
                        celebrating the patronage of 
                        Legatus Claudius Glaber!

  Polite applause. Spartacus steals a concerned glance at 
  Crixus. Crixus does not return it with his usual blistering 
  scorn. He simply averts his eyes, lost in his own thoughts.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        The man himself regrets duties of 
                        the senate prevent attendance. Yet 
                      he would see you properly 
                        addressed, his words delivered by 
                        pleasing tongue of trusted wife.

  He indicates Ilithyia. She steps forward, reading from a 
  small scroll.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        Good citizens of Rome's favored 
                        sister. It is with great pleasure 
                        that I, Legatus Claudius Glaber, 
                        bestow upon Quintus Lentulus 
                        Batiatus my patronage, and all 
                        encompassing benefits. No man in 
                        all of Capua is more deserving of 
                        such esteemed privilege.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    2.
  CONTINUED:

  The hint of displeasure lurks behind Ilithyia's practiced 
  smile as she glances at Lucretia. Lucretia returns it with a 
  satisfied one of her own.

                                          ILITHYIA(cont'd)
                        Good Batiatus should be held as 
                        example to a city mired in shadows 
                        and treachery.

  Agron fidgets, his eyes flicking to the Guards.

                                          ILITHYIA(cont'd)
                        The guiding light of his virtuous 
                        heart providing illumination in 
                        these dark and troubling times. For 
                        this reason and too many others to 
                        give voice, I lend Batiatus full 
                        and unconditional support towards 
                        the honored position of Aedile.

                                          SPARTACUS
                                  soft, to Agron)(
                        Still yourself.

  The crowd TITTERS. Sextus eyes Batiatus in surprise.

                                        SEXTUS
                        Aemilia failed to mention you had 
                        mind towards office.

                                        BATIATUS
                        I admit to none, good Sextus. Until 
                        the Legatus broached the subject.

                                        SEXTUS
                        Aedile is but a breath below 
                        Magistrate. We should dine, and 
                        discuss the matter further.

  Batiatus shares a smile with Lucretia. Everything is going 
  according to plan. He turns back to the crowd, beaming.

                                        BATIATUS
                      My heart to Legatus Glaber and his 
                        support. In hopes that you will 
                        share it in the days to come, I 
                        present a gift of blood! Two 
                        legends of the arena, to face each 
                        other sine missione! No quarter 
                        given! No mercy shown! Behold, 
                        Crixus! The savage Gaul!



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    3.
  CONTINUED:

  There's more than a little contempt in that description. A 
  fleeting look of GUILT clouds Lucretia's eyes as Crixus 
  steps forward. The crowd applauds, excited as Crixus is 
  unchained and given sword and shield. Ashur eyes his hated 
  nemesis with a barely contained, KNOWING SMILE.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        And who shall attempt to tame him? 
                        There could be but one! Spartacus! 
                        Slayer of the Shadow of Death!

  The crowd goes wild as Spartacus is unchained and given two 
  swords. Mira watches with fearful intensity.

                                          AEMILIA
                      He is of a form, is he not?

                                        NUMERIUS
                      He stands a god.

  Aurelia glances at him, uncertain, trying to unravel 
  something in her mind.

  SPARTACUS

  squares off against Crixus, but something is obviously 
  troubling him. He whispers, attempting to broach subject.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Crixus --

                                        CRIXUS
                        I have given you answer. Let us 
                        finish this.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Begin!

  Crixus attacks. Spartacus hardens his resolve and counters, 
  trading thunderous blows. As their swords clash --



  (TWO DAYS BEFORE THE FIGHT.) PRACTICE SWORDS CLASH as 
  Spartacus spars with RHASKOS. Iovis and VESPER stalk the 
  training square, clubs at the ready. Gladiators that aren't 
  sparring are in chains.

  RHASKOS ATTACKS,

  moving in close to hiss at Spartacus, his voice a low growl.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    4.

                                          RHASKOS
                        You speak of dangerous things.

  Spartacus counters, sending Rhaskos crashing to the ground.

                                          SPARTACUS
                      We live in dangerous times.

  He offers his hand to help Rhaskos up. Rhaskos hesitates. He 
  takes it, drawing close to give reply.

                                          RHASKOS
                        Many yet hold Crixus our true 
                        champion. As he draws breath, count 
                      me among them.

  Rhaskos moves off. Spartacus frowns, calls to Doctore.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Doctore. I would work the palus.

  Doctore looks to Iovis, not liking the new hierarchy of 
  command.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Permission for Spartacus.

  Iovis absently waves his approval. Doctore nods to 
  Spartacus. Spartacus works the palus beside Agron. Duro 
  trains nearby.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Have you traded words with 
                        Hamilcar?

                                        AGRON
                      He is with us. But Liscus and the 
                        Gauls refuse to grab cock without 
                        Crixus holding their balls. Where 
                        does Rhaskos stand?

                                          SPARTACUS
                        The same. Our numbers are yet 
                        shallow. We must gain Crixus' 
                        support and see them rise.

                                        DURO
                        The fucking mad man is still under 
                        lock and key. How will you turn him 
                      to cause if you cannot break words 
                        with him?



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    5.

                        Being champion yet affords 
                        privilege. A way shall present 
                        itself.

  GRUNTS OF PAIN pull their attention to Iovis and Vesper as 
  they beat a GLADIATOR on the ground. Iovis grins at Doctore. 
  Doctore glares, but turns away, having no recourse.

                                        AGRON
                      It had best "present" fucking soon.

  OFF SPARTACUS, feeling the truth of that as he returns to 
  training, the blow of his sword WIPING US TO --



  Mira and Aurelia pour wine and lay out food. Lucretia 
  ignores them, absently watching Spartacus and the men train 
  as the sun sets. Her mind drifts towards Crixus, her hand 
  absently dropping to caress her belly. Batiatus' hand slips 
  over hers as he appears behind her, nuzzling her neck.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Can you yet feel him move, eager to 
                        make entrance into the world?

                                        LUCRETIA
                      It is too soon by many months. And 
                        how do you divine a son?

                                        BATIATUS
                        Because the gods fucking favor us. 
                        Glaber's patronage, access to the 
                        upper strata of Capua, the promise 
                      of political office. Everything we 
                        have bled for, finally within 
                        grasp.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      We are truly blessed.

  Lucretia forces a sad smile, thoughts of Crixus lingering. 
  Batiatus flares in frustration.

                                        BATIATUS
                        I but deliver glorious news this 
                        day, only to be met with tempered 
                        response!

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Joy is restrained to lend clear 
                        mind towards celebration. Glaber's 
                        patronage may have paved road to 
                        the elite, but they are of ravenous 
                        appetites.

                        One only the House of Batiatus can 
                        prepare. Spartacus, Slayer of 
                        Theokoles, in a contest to the 
                        death.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Similar diversion was already 
                        presented, at Numerius' Toga 
                        Virilis, where Varro fell to 
                        Spartacus' sword.

  Aurelia tenses in the background, the words a knife in her 
  heart. Mira catches that, can't help but feel pity.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Varro was never match for the 
                        Champion of Capua. We must give the 
                        crowd what was denied that night. 
                        What all of Capua longs to see, yet 
                        only the privileged few under our 
                        roof will bear witness to. 
                        Spartacus in a fight for his life 
                        with the only man that has ever 
                        defeated him.

                      Is this your hope? That the fallen 
                        Gaul be granted fucking opportunity 
                      to regain position?

                        against the House of Batiatus.

  Batiatus scrutinizes her, knowing the deeper reason.

                      We stand as one in such regard. Yet 
                        your tongue named cause of doubt. 
                        Crixus is the only gladiator to 
                        pose threat to Spartacus. And there

                        campaign for office.

  Lucretia's eyes fall on Spartacus in the training square. 
  Once her bane, he is now the instrument of her revenge.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Then we must ensure Spartacus 
                        victorious. And Crixus fades from 
                        memory.

  OFF LUCRETIA's ultimate betrayal...



  SLAM BACK TO THE PRESENT. Spartacus CRASHES to the ground, 
  bleeding. Crixus charges, attempting to sever head from 
  neck. Spartacus narrowly intercepts the blow, managing to 
  kick Crixus back and regain his footing. Crixus hammers him 
  with sword and shield. Spartacus shoots a look to

  MIRA

  on the balcony. What the fuck is she waiting for? Mira 
  glances at Lucretia, trying to muster her nerve.

                        I would not have wagered the Gaul 
                        such a challenge to Spartacus!

                        You underestimate the man, Aemilia. 
                        Crixus was once Champion, was he 
                        not?

                        The match is but newly born. Much 
                        may yet happen as it matures.

  Batiatus shares a look with Lucretia. Ashur suppresses a 
  grin. Mira whispers to Lucretia, finally gaining her 
  courage.

  Mira glances down to Spartacus, gives a subtle shake of her 
  head. She's trapped.

  TRAINING SQUARE

  Spartacus grits his teeth, refocusing his attention on 
  deflecting Crixus' deadly assault. Agron shares a concerned 
  look with Duro. The plan is falling apart.

  CRIXUS

  redoubles his attack. Spartacus counters, drawing in close 
  to hiss at him.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        You must listen to me --

  Crixus snarls, answering with his sword and drawing blood. 
  The ROMANS cheer and scream, their faces twisted in 
  bloodlust as Crixus pounds Spartacus. ANGLE ON Doctore, 
  proudly watching his protege as WE SMASH TO --



  Spartacus spars with Agron and Duro. The three speak in 
  hushed whispers, constantly on the alert for Iovis and 
  Vesper.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    16.

                        Filled with the elite. Their deaths 
                        will shatter Capua to chaos. It 
                        will be days before it regains 
                        sense to pursue us.

                        Our plan takes form.

                                        DURO
                        What of Crixus? You still must find 
                        way to broach subject with the 
                        fucking Gaul.

                                          SPARTACUS
                      It presents itself, as promised.

  SHOUTS and CHEERS erupt. Agron and Duro turn to gawk as 
  Crixus steps out into the square with Doctore. Iovis glares 
  as Rhaskos and a crush of other loyal men cheer and thump 
  swords against shields.

                                        AGRON
                        Fuck my ass.

  Crixus is given a practice sword and shield. He grips them, 
  throwing Spartacus a deadly look.

                                          AGRON(cont'd)
                        Now all that remains is convincing 
                        the man that hates you to join your 
                        cause.

  OFF SPARTACUS, his mind set to the task...



  Spartacus eyes Crixus as he trains with a GLADIATOR. Crixus 
  is intense and focused, a killing machine waiting to be 
  unleashed. He slams the Gladiator with his shield, sending 
  him crashing to the sand. Rhaskos and other followers of 
  Crixus grin and laugh. Doctore cracks his whip.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    19.

                        sun has past.

  Doctore nods to Crixus as he moves off, pleased by his 
    performance. Crixus gives his shield and sword to a SLAVE.

                                          SPARTACUS (O.S.)
                        You move well.

  Crixus glances at Spartacus, who hands ANOTHER SLAVE his own 
  swords.

                                          SPARTACUS
                      As if lash had never been struck.

                        Pain is erased, when inflicted upon 
                        others. I hear gratitude is 
                        deserved for my release to 
                        training.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I would have you at your best when 
                      we face each other.

                                        CRIXUS
                      Is that all you would have from me?

  Crixus shifts his eyes to Rhaskos as he passes. Spartacus 
  shoots him a troubled frown. Crixus snorts.

                                          CRIXUS(cont'd)
                        What fever grips brain, that 
                        Spartacus would think me to band 
                        with him? To risk the life of my 
                        men? My life?

                                          SPARTACUS
                      Is there one? Without the woman you 
                        love within it?

                        I have never had stronger reason to 
                        live.

  He heads for the Mess Hall across the square. Spartacus 
  follows, his voice low.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I know your heart, Crixus. I felt 
                        the beating of it within my chest 
                        once.

                      By tongue of his man Aulus, before 
                        silencing it forever. I will see

                        with it the villain's blood upon 
                        the earth.

  Crixus weighs that, the revelation striking a deep chord.

                                        CRIXUS
                      As would I, in your place. Yet I am 
                        far removed from it. My escape 
                        would not aid Naevia's. How would I 
                        purchase her freedom, or even find 
                        her, while being hunted like an 
                        animal by the Romans?

                        Join me, and we will find her. 
                        Together.

  Crixus considers Spartacus with newly minted eyes.

                                        CRIXUS
                      In another life, perhaps you and I 
                        would have been as brothers.

                        But not in this one. I must win my 
                        freedom in the arena. Only then 
                        does hope of Naevia swell.

  Spartacus accepts that with begrudging respect.

                        Then we stand in the way of each

                        are victorious, one day you will

  A beat. Crixus extends his arm. They grasp forearms, sealing 
  the bond among enemies.

  Crixus grins sadly at Spartacus.

                        I fear it was always fated so.

  OFF SPARTACUS as he watches Crixus being led away, no longer 
  nemesis, yet neither friend...



  SLAM BACK TO THE PRESENT. Spartacus and Crixus trade blows. 
  Both bloodied by the conflict. If Crixus has been drugged, 
  it sure as fuck isn't showing.

  THE BALCONY

  Numerius ROARS in excitement as Crixus lands a series of 
  blows.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    23.

                      He gives much better showing 
                        against Spartacus than the fool

  Aurelia tenses, her uncertainty towards Numerius shifting 
  towards thinly veiled hatred.

  She shares a sly smile with Numerius. He barely contains 
  himself, yet lusting for her touch. Ilithyia turns her 
  attentions to the fight.

  He shoots Lucretia a look of concern.

  A faint, ambiguous smile graces her lips. Batiatus tenses. 
  Does she know more than she's letting on?

  THE CHEERS OF THE CROWD

  rip his attention back to the fight. All eyes are transfixed 
  by the epic battle. Mira senses her moment. She steels her 
  nerves and quietly fades back into the villa.

  Crixus hacks at Spartacus with vicious determination.



  Spartacus, Agron, Duro and the other men are sitting in the 
  training square in chains, eating as SLAVES decorate the 
  Mess Hall. Doctore passes, whip in hand. Agron waits, then 
  whispers to Duro.

                                        AGRON

                        I only wish your life protected, 
                        you fucking cock!

  Doctore glances back with a glare, continues on.

                                          SPARTACUS
                                  a hiss)(
                        Speak louder, and see us all 
                        undone.

                        I would have his fucking whip 
                        removed, along with the arm that 
                        wields it.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Doctore is an honorable man. I 
                        would not have him dead. Nor any 
                        slave.

                                        DURO
                        You fret of shit and piss. Rhaskos 
                        and the others still will not fall 
                      to purpose without Crixus.

  Spartacus spots Aurelia as the Guard stationed inside the 
  pantry unlocks the gate with his KEY for her. She enters 
  with the basket of flowers.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        They will seize the moment. When 
                        Crixus is dead, and there stands 
                        but one champion.
                                  calling out)(

  Doctore looks to Iovis for permission. Iovis absently waves 
  his approval. Spartacus heads to the rain barrel -- which is 
  right next to where Aurelia is placing flowers. He drinks, 
  keeping an eye on Iovis as he whispers to her.

                                          SPARTACUS(cont'd)
                        These celebrations have habit of 
                        turning from control. Should they 
                        again, remove to a safe place.

                        None exist. Not since Varro was 
                        taken from me by your hand.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        And I shall forever despise it for 
                        the deed. In company with the voice 
                        that commanded it.

                        For many things. But not this. It 
                        was the boy Numerius who demanded 
                        simple sport end in death.

  That stops Aurelia. She eyes Spartacus, then hardens.

                                          AURELIA
                        And I should believe a man that 
                        would do anything to win?

  Spartacus glances at her, having no idea what she's talking 
  about. Aurelia snorts in disgust.

                                          AURELIA(cont'd)
                      Do not take me a fool. I heard the 
                        dog Ashur tell his master he made 
                        purchase from Marcellus. A shit 
                        well known in the market as peddler 
                      of flesh and deception. And now 
                        Ashur prepares meal for Crixus, and 
                        speaks of the certainty of your 
                        fucking victory.

  The shock of realization slams into Spartacus.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        They corrupt his food?

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I have no hand in this.

                        Crixus takes your life before he 
                        falls.

  Aurelia moves away. OFF SPARTACUS, deeply troubled...



  Crixus pounds Spartacus -- but begins to falter, the drug 
  finally taking effect. He blinks the sweat from his eyes, 
  confusion washing across his face as he stumbles back. 
  Spartacus seizes the moment, attacking. The crowd ROARS.

  THE BALCONY

  Batiatus grins in relief, whispers to Lucretia.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Crixus begins to fade.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      As all memories do.

  Her eyes harden as she drains her wine. She holds her cup 
  out for Mira to refill it.

                                          LUCRETIA(cont'd)
                        Mira --

  She turns, surprised to find her gone.

  PANTRY GATE

  TIGHT ON a bloodied HAND as it unlocks the gate. WIDEN TO 
  REVEAL Mira with a key taken from the Guard she killed.

  TRAINING SQUARE

  Spartacus spots Mira standing in the now open gateway to the 
  pantry. She holds up her blood-stained palm as a signal.

  SPARTACUS SNARLS,

  attacking Crixus. Crixus struggles to counter, his vision 
  blurring from the drug. They lock swords, Spartacus leaning 
  in to hiss a warning.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        You weaken because of something in 
                        your food! They wish you dead.

  Crixus shoves Spartacus back. He looks up at Lucretia in 
  shock. She averts her eyes, her guilt obvious. Crixus growls 
  in rage, knowing he has been undone as he attacks Spartacus. 
  Spartacus easily counters, hammering him.





                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    33.

                        brother. And see the House of 
                        Batiatus fall.

  Crixus struggles with the choice as he continues to fight. 
  With his last ounce of strength he manages to knock one of 
  Spartacus' swords loose. It spins into the air, landing near 
  Agron.

  SPARTACUS UNLEASHES ON CRIXUS,

  landing a blow that sends him crashing back onto the sand. 
  The crowd CHEERS. Agron tenses. This is it.

  BLOOD DRIPS

  down Crixus' face, the world coming through in distorted 
  waves. He locks eyes with Spartacus -- and taps his shield, 
  signaling his acceptance of what must be done.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Spartacus...

  SPARTACUS BELLOWS

  and charges. Crixus raises his shield at the last moment. 
  Spartacus uses it as ramp, as he did against Theokoles. TIME 
  SLOWS as he SOARS THROUGH THE AIR towards the balcony, 
  framed by the golden light of the setting sun.

  BATIATUS

  constricts in horror as he sees Spartacus slamming towards 
  him. He grabs Sextus at the last moment, using him as a 
  shield as TIME RESUMES. Spartacus runs Sextus through the 
  head as he lands on the outside of the balcony.

  PANDEMONIUM ERUPTS

  as Sextus tumbles from the balcony, taking Ashur with him as 
  he clutches for purchase with his dying breath. TIME SLOWS 
  as Ashur crashes to the ground, Sextus' body breaking his 
  fall as he's knocked unconscious.

  SPARTACUS REARS BACK

  to split Batiatus' skull in two. Batiatus' eyes go wide. 
  CRACK! TIME RESUMES as Spartacus' hand is stopped by





                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    34.

  DOCTORE'S WHIP

  lashing around his wrist from below. Guests scream as they 
  rush back into the villa. Batiatus wades through them with 
  Lucretia and Ilithyia as Spartacus struggles against 
  Doctore's whip. He's about to tumble from the balcony when

  CRIXUS SEVERS THE WHIP

  with his sword. Doctore flies back, sliding to a stop 
  dangerously close to the edge of the cliff, dazed, face 
  bleeding. Crixus roars to the men.

                                          CRIXUS(cont'd)
                        Kill them! Kill them all!

  CHAOS as Rhaskos and the other men erupt into violence. 
  Agron grabs up Spartacus' fallen sword and attacks the 
  Guards. Duro swings his chain, smashing a Guard in the face.

  THE BALCONY

  Spartacus shakes the severed whip from his wrist and leaps 
  over the railing. Guards attack. Spartacus trades blows as 
  Batiatus SEALS THE DOORS to the villa.



  Spartacus battles the Guards on the balcony. Down below, the 
  Gladiators use their chains as weapons to block swords and 
  clubs. BODIES fly and BLOOD splatters.

  CRIXUS

  struggles against the effects of the drug as he severs limbs 
  with his sword.

  IOVIS

  slices open a Gladiator, bellowing.

  AGRON

  splits open a Guard with his sword. He grabs the man's keys, 
  unlocks his chains.

                        Duro!

  He tosses the keys to Duro, who follows suit.

  ANGLE ON CRIXUS

  as he hacks a Guard open. He spots Ashur as he comes to from 
  his fall. Crixus flares with hatred.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Crixus!

  Crixus whirls to find Doctore coming at him from across the 
  square. Ashur seizes the moment, escaping into the ludus. A 
  GLADIATOR tries to intercept Doctore. Doctore tosses him, 
  gaining the man's sword without breaking stride.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)

                      My mind is clear. Spartacus shows 
                      us the way.

                        fucking house.

  Doctore wavers, tears welling in his eyes. He screams, his 
  world shattering as he rears back and HURLS HIS SWORD. TIME 
  SLOWS as it rotates towards Crixus -- and narrowly misses 
  him, instead

  SLAMMING INTO IOVIS

  as he raises his sword behind Crixus to cleave him in two. 
  TIME RESUMES as Iovis crashes to the sand, dead. Doctore 
  spits in contempt, eyes hardening.

                        Go.

  Crixus nods in gratitude. He turns and heads for the pantry 
  gate. Rhaskos and half a dozen men fall in with him. Doctore 
  stands frozen for a moment as the sun finally sinks below 
  the horizon behind him. His eyes climb to

  The remaining Guards battle Agron, Duro, HAMILCAR and a 
  clutch of other bloodied Gladiators. Hamilcar is fatally

  Duro flares, hacking and slashing. Agron cuts down a Guard, 
  but another blind-sides him. Agron smashes to the ground, 
  dazed. The Guard raises his sword for the death blow.

  Agron surges to his feet and decapitates the Guard. Duro 
  crumbles. Agron cradles him. Duro locks eyes with him, 
  smiling through the agony.

  The light fades from his eyes. A frozen beat, shattered by 
  Agron's scream as he rips the sword from Duro's body. He 
  attacks the remaining Guards in a frenzy of blood. OFF 
  AGRON's crimson rage...



  RAMP TO SLOW MOTION as the gates are smashed open. Spartacus 
  is first out, with Crixus, Doctore, and Agron close behind. 
  The Gladiators, Mira, Aurelia, and the other Slaves swarming
