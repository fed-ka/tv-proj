in the dark. Coming toward us. Up and down in sync to an
INSTRUMENTAL LEAD-IN from somewhere. A slip of light. A
glimpse of somebody in shadow under a sweatshirt hood,
staring at us, in and out of the dark as...
up and down, running along a dark road in the dead of night,
passing vacant lots with debris amid trees and faded
buildings. He is CASSIUS CLAY. He runs in construction
boots. His eyes stare from under the hood. He passes the
husk of an abandoned car, a pastel storefront. We're in
Overtown, Miami's inner-city black neighborhood.
now runs diagonally across NW 7th INTERCUT with Cooke
shouting, "Yeah!"
SAM COOKE'S AUDIENCE (O.S.)
Oh, yeah!
Cassius runs toward us. Off to the side in the black-
mirrored water of Biscayne Bay, leaden clouds in a black sky.
And now Sam Cooke SINGS "...because you make me wanna
mooove...!" and breaks into the first verse of "Feel It."
But we see Cassius' eyes are FOCUSED, CONCENTRATED,
ELSEWHERE. To where is this man running? Why is his
expression so distant? A WHITE LIGHT suddenly hits him from
behind. He looks over at...
2.
WIDE FROM THE FRONT:
CASSIUS + A METRO-DADE POLICE CAR
that's slowed, clocking the suspicious, running black man.
The driver starts to pull over, to hassle Cassius. Then,
the cop riding shotgun gets a radio call. He taps the
driver's shoulder. They take off, the driver laughing.
Cassius looks after the white cops. He is neither relieved
nor angry. He's dismissive. And, instead, he sees
something else...
CASSIUS' EYES - NIGHT
back here, now, crossing through black night and over black
water of the MacArthur Causeway. We start to HEAR pop pop
pop pop pop pop POP over Sam Cooke's music, and Sam Cooke's
image SUPERIMPOSES as he segues from "Feelin'" to "Bring It
On Home." And the pop pop pop pop pop carries us into...
past guards, Bundini, press, starts to enter. Inside,
Clay's on the sofa, in his underwear, watching "The Man With
the X-Ray Eyes," who has the power to imbue and control from
beams emitted from his eyes. Dundee and Bingham hang out.
Cassius' mind is elsewhere. His eyes float to the corner of
the doorway before we see Pacheco, even though from the
outside, has started to enter...
(MIAMI)
Nothing. Cassius is asleep in a lounge chair...incongruously
a TV is run from the house by an extension cord. Cassius
wakes. His eyes say, "Who are you?"
BUNDINI
(entering)
I'm called Bundini, rhymes with
Houdini. He was a Jew, too...some
other people call me Fastblack...or
Daddy Mac...
Drew "Bundini" Brown, early forties, holds a hat in his hand,
his eyes always seem to be glistening, ready to rage, laugh
or cry, tentatively approaches. Cassius' flat eyes return
to the television.
11.
BUNDINI (CONT'D)
(motions at lounge
chair)
Shorty sent me to Sugar Ray
Robinson. I gave my power to Sugar
Ray for seven years, gave him my
voodoo, my magic. Now Shorty sent
me to you.
CASSIUS
Who Shorty?
BUNDINI
I call him Shorty 'cause he like
'em circumcised. Original people.
Like Moses. And I was a babe in a
basket, too. I was born on a
doorstep with a note 'cross my
chest that read, "Do the best you
can for him, world." I had to suck
the first nipple come along. I
didn't run away from home...I been
runnin' to home.
Cassius should kick him out, but Bundini's got his foot in
the door of Cassius' attention.
BUNDINI (CONT'D)
(beat, and his raison d'tre)
Now, I gotta ask you. You fixin'
them fights? Else no way you could
tell great Archie Moore what round
you droppin' him in...all of them
predictions you make, comin' true.
Never heard of nobody predictin'
the round like you. You either a
phony or Shorty's in your corner.
Tell me the truth, young man...
Cassius, stretched out, mumbles without looking at him...
CASSIUS
...I study every fight. 'Til I got
a plan. Wear him down two through
four. Drop him in the fifth round.
So the p'diction ain't a p'diction.
It's a plan. And 'cause of all the
poppin' off I do, I know I gotta
win! That's the truth. And why
I'm tellin' you?
12.
BUNDINI
'Cause I'm gonna be your Inspiration.
Your motivator. In your corner.
Can I be in your corner, young man?
CASSIUS
(thinks, then)
Yeah...
BUNDINI
(inexplicably moved,
covers)
Ain't spent much time in Miami.
Where the water?
Cassius has drifted off, back to watching TV.
What he sees
as his eyes close is:
CROSSES - NIGHT
through the club, with lots of partygoers, picks up
Chesterfields from the cigarette girl and goes out by pool,
around which we see women at tables in cocktail dresses and
good-looking men. Most of the rooms' doors are wide open,
couples drinking, celebrating...radios playing out into the
Floridian night.
OF PEOPLE (NEW YORK, 1964) - DAY
Suddenly we're in Harlem. The streets are jammed. Making
them crazy, causing a riot, coming down the sidewalk,
looking like a rock-and-roll star in a black leather jacket,
is CASSIUS CLAY and in an overcoat and hat, MALCOLM X. They
OWN this day on 125th Street.
engulf them. People are their army. The sea of people
press close to their heroes...reaching out to touch the
champ, share a joke, laugh. A girl runs up to hug Cassius
and runs off. We catch a glimpse on the periphery of Joseph
13X. Seven or eight reporters, black and white, and still
photographers and Bingham, half with Cassius, half
photographer in privileged position.
A REPORTER
The people look to you. Do you
plan on being a people's champ,
like Joe Louis?
CASSIUS
(tentative)
Yeah. I going to be a people's
champ...
(beat)
But not like Joe Louis, exactly...
A REPORTER
(starts)
Mr. Clay...?
And Cassius drops it on them...
CASSIUS
And I'm not Clay. Clay's the name
of the people who owned by
ancestors. I don't want to be
called after that slave name no
more. So I'm "X." Cassius X. And
I'm a member of the Nation of Islam.
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad is my
spiritual guide. Malcolm X is my
mentor.
This is hard news!
REPORTERS
(all at once)
You a card-carrying member?
Aren't
Black Muslims a hate group?
23.
CASSIUS
(droll)
"Card-carrying"...? Don't need no
"card." You got a Christian card?
750 million people believe in Islam.
I'm one of them.
ANOTHER REPORTER (O.S.)
Minister Malcolm...what about the
reports of a split between you and
Elijah Muhammad?
JOSEPH 13X:
we read his face listening to Malcolm.
MALCOLM X
This is the champ's time. And I'm
here as a friend to celebrate his
victory. So I got nothing you want...
CASSIUS
I'm going to be a people's champion.
But I don't have to be the way you
want me to be. I'm gonna be what I
want. And I'm free to think any
way I want...
And, as he goes on, the crowd knows neither Cassius nor
Malcolm will ever turn their backs on them.
enters into the street with his Bodyguard and looks up to a
top-floor window in which he sees a light is still on at 4 a.m.
We've entered mid-scene.
CASSIUS CLAY, SR.
Why you want to change?
A NEIGHBOR (V.O.)
(to Ali)
Could we get a picture with you?
(to Cassius, Sr.)
You mind, Mr. Clay?
A neighboring family coming to stand beside Ali.
Cassius,
Sr. steps aside.
CASSIUS CLAY, SR., a sport, a flamboyant man, is impatient.
Inside, Odessa Clay and brother, Rudy, are talking.
CASSIUS CLAY, SR.
What's wrong with the lawyers and
managers you got?
28.
A NEIGHBOR
One more.
(click)
Thank you.
CASSIUS CLAY, SR.
Yeah, yeah...
They leave.
CASSIUS CLAY, SR. (CONT'D)
You got...I got you the best white
men I could find. Right here in
L'ville...
ALI
When the contract run out. I want
black lawyers and managers.
Chauncey Eskridge on North La Salle
Street...
CASSIUS CLAY, SR.
(angrily)
They saved you from the gangsters,
from the jackals and the hyenas of
boxing. Never cheated you.
Protected you with a trust fund...
ALI
I don't need no "protectin'" from
myself. Why I need protecting from
myself by them...?
CASSIUS CLAY, SR.
And now I got to go tell them,
"Piss off. Cassius don't want you
around no more."
ALI
I ain't one of their thoroughbreds!
Or their charity things. "Let's do
somethin' for that well-behaved
colored boy, Cassius." I ain't
well-behaved nothing! I am a man.
The light starts to go...porch lights starting to come on...
ALI (CONT'D)
And I am not Cassius. I changed my
name. I am Muhammad Ali, now.
CASSIUS CLAY, SR.
You what?
29.
ALI
That's right.
CASSIUS CLAY, SR.
(stunned)
What? What's wrong with...our name,
my name...? We're...we made you.
We...
ALI
No one "made me"...
CASSIUS CLAY, SR.
No bow-tie-wearin', Arab-talkin'
nigger gonna change that...
ALI
(anybody's son)
I made me.
(adamant)
No one's in that ring but me!
CASSIUS CLAY, SR.
You don't know who you are...
ALI
I know who I'm not...I'm not
drinkin'! Goin' back on my wife!
I am not prayin' to no blue-eyed,
blonde-haired Jesus. I ain't...
CASSIUS CLAY, SR.
Paintin' blue-eyed, blonde-haired
Jesuses and signs on cars is what
put steak and vegetables in you,
clothes on you...
ODESSA CLAY
...dinner!
And we realize it has gotten too dark to see...
CASSIUS CLAY, SR.
(cold)
Go ahead!
Bitter silences.
CASSIUS CLAY, SR. (CONT'D)
Go ahead.
Cassius, Sr. walks off...his back arched too straight,
trying to hold his pride together.
30.
ODESSA CLAY
You didn't get it from me...your
words, your sense of humor, what
makes you angry, what makes you a
fighter. You got that from your
daddy...
ALI
You saying I'm just like him?
ODESSA CLAY
I'm saying, if he was your age
today, he'd do the same as you.
And he knows that.
And Odessa goes back inside.

CAM FOLLOWS IT and we HEAR...
BETTY SHABAZZ (V.O.)
We should think of a name, Malcolm...
in a Mercedes convertible. It's a monumental expression of
the force for the independence of black Africa. Accra is a
wonder to Ali. A Third World showplace, in 1964 Ghana is
alive with the optimism of emerging Africa. Infrastructure

and real estate are well-managed. Under Nkrumah, the city
is in a frenzy of building public housing...
ALI
in the three-car caravan, passes the huge triumphal arch
with its giant black star on the top. Thousands line the
route to see the heavyweight champion and cheer him. For
Ali it's another kind of parade...
ALI'S POV:
GHANAIANS
They're stockbrokers and street cleaners, salesmen and
secretaries, hotel managers and military officers... All is
a contrast to the de facto apartheid of the middle America
of Ali's experience. They all cheer his caravan as it passes.

Meanwhile, a different group are about to depart in limos.
One among them, a tall Man in a dashiki and sunglasses and
carrying a walking stick, separates. He sees Ali. So does
the woman next to him. She is the poet Maya Angelou.
MALCOLM X
(shouts)
Brother Muhammad...
Taking off his shades, we realize it's Malcolm X. He wears
a goatee, now. Ali turns, sees him. Total surprise.
ALI
Hey, man!!!
They embrace. Ali greets him like the old friend he is.
Maya and the Chinese diplomat wait a few steps removed.
ALI (CONT'D)
How you doin'? What's up, brother?
I knew you were here...didn't think
you were still here...
MALCOLM X
And I heard you were coming.
34.
ALI
We just got here now...
(words rush out)
And, maaan, the brothers were flyin'
a DC 8. Flippin' switches,
navigatin', filing flight plans,
talkin' French...
And they remember how much they like each other.
ALI (CONT'D)
Where you goin'?
MALCOLM X
When...uh, Liberia.
When you
fighting Liston?
ALI
November.
MALCOLM X
This is Maya Angelou and Ambassador
Huang Ha. Amando Gonzalez is from
Cuba. Taher Kaid is the Ambassador
from Algeria.
Ali waves.
They keep their distance.
ALI
Man, where should I go?
We're
planning on Egypt.
MALCOLM X
Algeria. See Ben Bella...
(beat)
Go to Mecca, Medina. I just came
back. Made my seven circuits
around the Kaaba, prayed at
sunrise... There were two million
people...pilgrims from all over.
Dressed all the same, high and low,
the same. Blonde-haired, blue-eyed
Muslims. Arabs.
(off Ali's look of
surprise)
Blacks. Yeah. All of them,
Muslims praying together.
MALCOLM X
Drank from the well of Zem-Zem...
And you should visit Cairo. I have
friends there in...
Meanwhile...
ALI
(his thoughts)
...shouldn't have quarreled with
the Honorable Elijah...
The rapport between them becomes fleeting.
Ali's attention
drifts away. He closes down...
37.
ALI (CONT'D)
(to himself)
You shouldn't have...
(vocalized)
...quarreled with the honorable
Elijah Muhammad...
MALCOLM X
What?
ALI
You shouldn't have quarreled with
Elijah Muhammad.
And Ali separates.
He turns away.
Malcolm calls after him...
MALCOLM X
Brother Muhammad...
Ali won't turn back from his rejection of Malcolm.
He
shakes his head "no" and walks off.
MALCOLM X (CONT'D)
Brother Muhammad...!
BUNDINI + BINGHAM - DAY
HERBERT
What?
ALI
That's right.
I wanna marry her.
HERBERT
You can't marry that girl! She was
a date! Have some fun! She's not
your wife! You don't marry this
girl.
(puts contracts in
front of him)
Sign there. Management papers. My
father will kill me.
BUNDINI
True love!
Bundini cracks up. Ali signs without even glancing at the
documents. Bingham notices this.
BINGHAM
Watch what you signing, Ali.
HERBERT
(to Bingham; sharp)
Nothing to do with you.
BINGHAM
You talkin' to me, or someone walk
inna room, fat boy? Anything's do
to with me I think's to d-d-do with
me...I'm st-st-still a Christian.
ALI
(signs anyway)
And get me a kosher cook...lady who
cooks at Malcolm's temple. Put my
brother on the payroll. 50g a year
for drivin' and jivin'.
HERBERT
Lana Shabazz...
42.
ALI
Yeah. How 'bout it, Howard. You be
my official full-time photographer.
BINGHAM
I ain't goin' on your payroll. I
like it freelance. Emphasis on "free."
As Ali signs the last of the contracts.
HERBERT
Muhammad. She's not...for you.
When I met her, she was working at
a cocktail lounge with a bunny tail
on her backside.
BUNDINI
What were you doin' down at a
cocktail lounge, Herbert? Sellin'
"Muhammad Peeks"?
Ali and Bingham crack up...
HERBERT
(to Bundini)
Sober up and say something to this
man, Bundini. You supposed to be
his "inspiration."
BUNDINI
(looks at Ali; to
Ali, serious)
I got to know about Sonji, Muhammad.
She got a sister?
(as Ali laughs)
BINGHAM
You been s-s-saving it up, training,
Champ. You can't unleash it on
this girl all sudden. You may kill
her! Maybe you should spread it
around more before you tie it down.
ALI
No. Marriage is the cornerstone of
Muslim life.
HERBERT
Sonji Roi is not a Muslim!
ALI
She gonna be a Muslim, now!
(flashes)
So fix it up, Herbert.

Reporters, trying to ambush him. Lots of activity in the
motel forecourt.
51.
ALI
(to Bundini)
Where's Herbert?
Bundini indicates and Ali exits into Herbert's room. Beyond
is the Holiday Inn marquee: "Clay vs. Liston II." A few
letters droop.
ALI
What do I do...?
Ali, angry, stands in front of Herbert.
HERBERT
If you want, have no contact with
her for ninety days. Then you make
a public statement of divorce in
the mosque, and Islamic law will be
satisfied.
BUNDINI
"Satisfied?"...satisfaction is not
makin' it with the woman who send
you to the moon?
Cassius, Sr. bursts in.
Bundini has Ali's championship belt
over his shoulder.
BUNDINI (CONT'D)
Man, I'm the only normal person
left around here and I'm a black
Jew who can't read and is half drunk.
CASSIUS CLAY, SR.
I gotta talk to you.
Bundini and Herbert start to leave.
ALI
Please stay, Brother Herbert.
CASSIUS CLAY, SR.
He ain't your brother! Your
brother taking your wife back to
Chicago. She's crying like a widow.
ALI
I ain't dead!
CASSIUS CLAY, SR.
You might as well be. You don't
remember your name or who you are.
52.
Cassius, Sr. leaves the room.
LOBBY - CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE - DAY
waits at the curb as Ali and Herbert pull up and get out of
a car...move through the crowd...reporters shouting
questions at him we don't hear, go up the steps, into the
lobby, joining other recruits and M.P.'s.
CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE
(quietly)
You do six weeks basic...you go
into the Reserves...you don't go to
Vietnam...you get to box...you even
get to keep the money...
He gives Ali a piece of paper signed by the Justice
Department, confirming the deal...
HERBERT
(lets him know)
The Messenger would not object if
you joined under these terms.
ALI
I stay out of jail and I get to fight.
HERBERT
(nods)
All you have to do is accept the
induction. And life goes on.
CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE
They call your name. You say yes.
We're not sure what Ali will do.

conspicuous unmarked police cars and neighborhood people.
ALI

his late 20's we've seen before. He and Howard Bingham,
waiting inside, know each other. They enter. The phone's
already RINGING.
Time has passed. It's winter. Snow's on the ground. He's
in a car coat and a hat with a hooded sweatshirt underneath.
Street lights are on. Traffic's slight. He walks through

A fast car drives by, distracting Ali momentarily.
Then,
Ali focuses 100% on...
ALI
Where the money come from, Chauncey?
Herbert tell me I'm runnin' on
empty. Put aside "how do that
happen"? Licenses all revoked. No
passport. I can't fight here.
Can't fight abroad.
(beat)
And what happen if I lose the
Supreme Court?
CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE
It's all over. You go to jail for
five years.
There's no response from Ali.
Ali hangs up, looks the other
way, lost in thought.

number. A sound CRACKS OPEN THE NIGHT...
Chauncey runs up the stairs to the second-floor balcony to

King involuntarily spasms. Under King, dark blood pools

as if they were pointing at a burning fire, sirens, blue
police flashers, an isolated gunshot. And REVEAL Ali on a

JIMI HENDRIX
"Outside in the cold distance,
a wild cat did growl,
two riders were approaching,

He leaves off to look into the distance. The agility, what
he was with Terrell, isn't there. He exhales in time with
punches HUH, HUH, HUH...Ali's struggling to hold onto
diminishing sharpness. Police lights. Looting? He
contemplates the fabric of the city ripping itself apart

landscape, ending at the lakefront and the cold, open sky

who turn as ALI pulls up in a convertible. He's solemn for
a moment. Then he's out of the car...

Dead or alive!

Don't bother me. I'm a world-

I can't be seen you, it would be
calamitous to my reputation.
alone in the convertible parked in a distant corner of the lot.
ALI
Put me on, Howard.
HOWARD COSELL
Muhammad, I'd do anything for you.
But I got bosses who only give a
damn about Nielsen ratings.
ALI
I guarantee...it will be a
historical and momentous night!
ALI (V.O.)
You want me to buy you a drink?
Ali's dad sits on a crate, painting the door of a delivery
truck. He looks up...Ali is there. Emotion wells up in
both men. The younger "rebelistic" son, seeing his father,
who is so like him. The older hep-cat who got cheated by
life of his potential and promise. In this case, his boy,
his boy's name, pride and reflected glory...
CASSIUS CLAY, SR.
I don't drink no more.
(squints at him)
You wanna fight?
ALI
I don't wanna fight no more.
Not
with you...
As they embrace, Odessa comes out, watches them.
83.
Ali stands on the street corner, shades, incognito. A gold
Cadillac pulls up: JOE FRAZIER. He is wearing a lemon
yellow cowboy outfit, Stetson hat, striped pants. Ali looks
at him in disbelief.
ALI
Who dress you, Joe?
You look like
Dale Evans.
FRAZIER
Shut up.
Get in.
Ali gets in, Frazier takes off. He sits sideways on the
seat, steers with one finger, flicks on the radio: Isaac Hayes.
FRAZIER (CONT'D)
What the hell you in Philly for?
Philly my town.
ALI
To be closer to you, honey.
FRAZIER
Fuck you.
ALI
There be two undefeated heavyweight
champions! And they ain't fighting!
FRAZIER
I wanna fight you! Said it a
hundred times. The Man won't let
you fight no more. What you
complainin' to me for?
ALI
'Cause you gotta get behind this
and we gotta do this.
Frazier screeches to a stop in the middle of Columbia Avenue.
FRAZIER
We..."gotta" do nothin'!!!
ALI
You wanna get this on, Joe?
You
and me? Or not?!
FRAZIER
What about your license?
84.
ALI
I can fight in Atlanta.
FRAZIER
How's that? What about the Boxing
Commission?
ALI
Georgia ain't got no state boxing
commission. And Atlanta got a
black city council; a liberal
Jewish mayor, Sam something. It
all set. I do a prelim in Atlanta
with Jerry Quarry. But we got to
get the steamroller movin' now.
FRAZIER
What I got to do?
ALI
You announce that if I beat Quarry
you give me the title shot.
(puts it to him)
So what you say...maaan?
Frazier stops in front of his renovated duplex in the North
Philadelphia ghetto.
FRAZIER
My daddy was a sharecropper. I
worked in a slaughterhouse...right
on that corner. I came up from
nothing.
(raises fist)
What I got, I got with this. And I
already got the title. So I got
nothing to win and everything to lose.
ALI
But you know you ain't the champ yet.
FRAZIER
(looks at him)
Yeah..."yet."
(beat)
All right. You beat Quarry, I'll
get inna ring and fuck you up...
They drive off.
After a moment, Frazier looks sideways at him.
FRAZIER (CONT'D)
(quieter)
You need any money or anything to
tide you by...?
85.
ALI
(turns away)
I'm fine. Thanks.
And Ali rests a hand on Frazier's shoulder, and they drive
off like that.
PUSH THROUGH people and SEE an Air Zaire DC-10 pulling in.
A ramp is wheeled up. The plane stops taxiing. Zairian
officials in safari suits, paratroopers with white helmets,
LT. NSAKALA and hundreds of African, European and American
media with cameras and lights approach. The hatch opens. A
ROAR emerges from the right and left. We don't see the source.
emerges and reacts. He's electrified. Dundee, Bingham, and
a few cops are with him. Everybody else got left behind.
REVEAL 10,000 people are OUTSIDE the airport, cheering his
arrival. Their cheer is thunder.
ALI
(to Zairian Official;
shouts)
What are they saying, man?!!!
Why
they saying that?
ZAIRIAN OFFICIAL #1
They say, "Ali, boma ye. Ali, boma
ye."
ALI
What's that mean?!
I don't understand!
ZAIRIAN OFFICIAL #1
It mean...!
ALI
(can't hear)
What?!
ZAIRIAN OFFICIAL #1
(has to shout)
It mean..."Ali, kill him! Ali,
kill him!"
Ali moves forward. The Zairian Official and four cops fade
back, nervous about being in so large a crowd. The crowd's
a tidal wave, carrying Ali forward, supporting, never
mobbing him.
MUHAMMAD ALI
is overcome. This is all for him. He is their hero. He
defied the world's powerful. They tried and could not
destroy him. His defiance made him their champion. And now
he has come to contest his rightful title against the numb
instrument of the all-powerful. He raises his arm, too, and
shouts...
ALI
Ali, boma ye!
Ten thousand voices carry it on the wind and take away Ali's
breath.
ALI (CONT'D)
Ali, boma ye!
103.
DON KING, ZAIRIAN OFFICIALS #1 + #2
in the rear realize, as do we, this is NOT MERELY A BOXING
MATCH.
CUT TO:
ALI
enters from his bungalow. We SEE we're in a compound. They
are white and severely truncated houses linked by sidewalks
and too many large street lamps. As Ali starts to jog
through this imitation of suburbia with the scale all wrong.
It's like a Gulag in reverse for the rich and powerful to be
within while keeping the rest of the country out. As Ali
passes, REVEAL we are at the bank of the Congo River. As
Ali starts his predawn run, across the river the first band
of magenta tints the horizon and reflects molten on the water.
TRACKING SHOT:
ALI + DUNDEE, SARRIA IN A PICKUP TRUCK - RED
DAWN
plus two trainers and the ever-present Zairian POLICEMAN, Lt.
Nsakala. The early paints the red-earth ochre.
104.
ALI
(to himself)
Fast. Six left jabs flash from his
chest and shoulder, followed by a
right hook and left and right
uppercuts.
ALI (CONT'D)
(to himself)
Back up, maaan...
(weaves suddenly;
another voice)
...you fast!
Ali slides to the right and throws a left jab and hooks off
the jab.
Ali ENTERS, running. The road is lined with Mobutu's green
billboards in French and English, proclaiming Zaire
wonderful. A few kids emerge from behind the signs, coming
out from between...and they trail Ali.
KIDS
Ali, boma ye!
ALI
(repeating)
Ali, boma ye George Foreman!
And he throws a couple at an imaginary George Foreman.
There are 15 to 16 kids, now.
ALI (CONT'D)
You out, sucker!
Curious, Ali runs behind the green signs from where the kids
came.
ALI'S
still jogging. Behind the signs, he becomes a magnetic
attraction. People are surprised to see Ali. He's making
their day. Euphoric kids parallel him, run with him, follow
him...
PAST ALI:
the concrete-and-cinder-block walls to the dusty, bare
ground are chromatic. Primary colors. Ethnographically
interesting.
105.
ALI SEES interiors. Broken walls. No roof. No plumbing.
People come from a ditch with a shower curtain for privacy,
surprised to see Ali. Faces indifferent to squalor. This
is the ethnographically "interesting" surface of what, in
fact, is civic disintegration starting to occur... It is
the human concomitant to 13 years of Mobutu kleptocracy.
ALI
looks at the backs of the signs. He and we realize the
signs' purpose: to hide the makeshift plastic walls and
rooms made from cardboard containers and oil drums from the
foreigners traveling the road to Kinshasa. One TEENAGER
WITH A WITHERED ARM and a big smile runs up...
TEENAGER
(broken English)
You beat them, Ali!
ALI
Foreman?
I kill him!
He mimes knocking out Foreman. Something powerful is
affecting Ali. We don't know what it is. Ali slows down...
...throws two lightning jabs and a hook. Ali reaches to the
kid's head and pulls a coin. He flips it to another kid and
walks on. A SECOND TEENAGER comes out and wants Ali to look
at something around the back. He takes Ali's hand...and
holds it. Ali complies. The entourage follows...
AROUND CORNER:
KIDS' PAINTING ON WALL
It's an imitation fight poster. Childlike caricatures in
Basquiat-like brush strokes. Foreman's got crosses for eyes.
He's out! Ali is victorious! His fist is raised. His
cartoon face shouts his victory...the people's champion.
There's more. There's knocked-out white policemen, knocked-
out black soldiers, knocked-out landlords, knocked-out South
Africa, knocked-out planes and tanks, knocked-out tse-tse
flies...everything!
So much, it means "ALL"...all expectation. This childish
painting powerfully affects Ali. The kids look at him.
It's still. Some kids in the back leap up in the air to see
over taller heads what Ali's doing.
ALI
looks at individual faces. A grinning OLDER MAN with a blue
transistor radio (we'll see him later). A smiling kid. A
girl with no shoes. A teenage kid jumping up and down...all
looking at him. Ali makes four pieces of rope appear. He
rubs them together...
106.
ALI (CONT'D)
Shazaam!!!
They become one. Everybody goes nuts. As Ali leaves, his
eyes go back to the people and the painting...
ALI'S FACE - MORNING (GREEN SCREEN)
ALI
(to himself)
...even if I die here. If it kill
me, no matter what...I gotta win.
Concentration has taken him into the athlete's zone, the
state of unified awareness wherein dwells his total self-
knowledge. And he knows the transaction: what they give
him with their adoration, which he converts to power, is in
exchange for what he means to them. And what he means to
them is specific: he represents them in defying power and
vanquishing what oppresses. He validates the existence of
expectation, that struggle is possible...George Foreman,
mute and unknowingly, represents disinterested power. Ali
doesn't "accept" his obligation; he embraces it. It is his
purpose, revealed. And he will never waver from it.
CUT TO:
to percussion.
The number.
112.
ALI,
Angelo and Bingham in the empty seating, looking at the ring
under the canopy. Behind them is the rehearsal. Meanwhile...
CUT TO:

Official #2, a Policeman Driver; and in the second car is
Don King, Herbert, VERONICA, and another American Woman

is being taught to dance by two dancers. They fail. In the
background, workers are raising gigantic Mobutu portraits.
The Pointer Sisters begin.
AISLE
Don King and entourage approach.
DON KING
(over the drumming)
Champ! Champ! George had an accident.
ANGELO DUNDEE
(suspicious)
What are you talking about?
Pointer Sisters start "Yes, We Can Can."
DON KING
Got cut. Right above his right eye.
His sparring partner's elbow.
Split it open, so...
ANGELO DUNDEE
Can he fight?
DON KING
Not for six weeks.
Ali laughs.
DON KING (CONT'D)
This is not a humorous situation,
my champion. This postponement
could be long, especially if George
leaves.
113.
ANGELO DUNDEE
Are you tryin' to pull something,
Don? Ali wants his title. And he
wants it back in Zaire. George
leaves, he ain't comin' back.
George don't like it here.
Pointer Sisters' rehearsal cuts...re-organizes.
DON KING
How right you are, my suspicious
and short Italian brother. And my
fiduciary responsibility to this
first all-black promotion is like a
garden in the African sun. It must
grow! It must bloom! It cannot
flower in the gloom and shade of
postponement to some dome. Like
the Astrodome, the Super-dome, any
dome outta Zaire, where it be
deprived of light and bled of water.
'Cause what gonna bleed...is money.
A hemorrhage of cash.
(sees it all)
...blood on the floor. Double
hotel costs. Double travel costs.
Airplanes. Food and beverage...
ANGELO DUNDEE
(rhetorical)
What do you expect us to do, Don?
DON KING
(moves close to Ali)
Muhammad. Find a way to get George
to stay. Be Moses in reverse: do
NOT let my people go! Stay the
fuck right here, in Egypt, if
you'll pardon my Swahili.
BINGHAM
L-l-l-lingala.
DON KING
What?
BINGHAM
Lingala.
They s-s-s-speak Lingala.
DON KING
Who cares?
Pointer Sisters probably end here.
After a beat, percussion
starts up. Dancers drift in.
114.
ANGELO DUNDEE
(pissed, dissed big)
If George goes? You forfeit five
million. You crawl back to
Cincinnati. You ain't promotin' a
charity raffle...
We see Herbert watching all of this closely...particularly
the challenge to Ali/Dundee.
DON KING
(irrepressible)
If George goes? George goes, my
champion, I will get you Joe
Frazier. Ali-Frazier III...the
fight everybody want to see.
Waiters scurry. Ali talks to a blonde reporter from France
and settles next to Lloyd Price, without a shirt. Everyone
crowds around their table. A ZAIRIAN INTERPRETER and
Lieutenant Nsakala are present. Ali disregards their
presence because his attention tracks...
ALI'S POV:
VERONICA
seen over the heads of Zairians. She's 5 feet 10 inches
tall. Without acknowledging she's the object of Ali's
attention, her radar tells her she's the object of Ali's
attention.
ALI (V.O.)
Say, girl...!
Veronica turns, sees Ali.
Lights up.
ALI (CONT'D)
C'mere.
I know you?
OVER VERONICA as she makes her way to the table by Ali's
side, where he takes her hand in his.
VERONICA
I don't think so.
ALI
What's your name?
VERONICA
Veronica Porche.
ALI
Like the sports car.
VERONICA
(laughs)
Yes.
ALI
But with a little something extra.
(beat)
Veronica, I know you now. C'mere,
sit down.
He steers her into the chair next to him, which is
immediately vacated by Lloyd Price.
ALI (CONT'D)
You with Don?
118.
VERONICA
Don brought me here, but I'm not
"with"...anybody.
The others are paying them no attention. Bundini stands to
talk to Howard Cosell. There's an ocean of side
conversations. Ali's presentation to Veronica is natural,
open admiring. It is not seduction. It's more seductive
than seduction. She feels from Ali nothing predatory or
exploitative...only the warm rays of the sun from his open
face and appreciating eyes. Still holding her hand...
ALI
Where you from?
Meanwhile, George Foreman, with Sadler, Moore, Broadus, sees
and laughs at Ali and Veronica and onto George Foreman going
into hotel.
VERONICA
L.A. But my people are from
Louisiana. We're Creole. So I'm
African, French, Spanish, my
mother's grandfather was Jewish.
ALI
(looking at her
admiringly)
Well...they all came together real
nice.
VERONICA
You know...
(hesitating; low)
...I'm glad you said what you did.
You made sure this fight stays here.
ALI
All them writers in there think
Foreman gonna...kill me!
(eyes go wide)
What you think?
VERONICA
Ali, boma ye.
Meanwhile, 15 Chinese and some Vietnamese approach and wait
patiently. Ali has to force his attention away from
Veronica to respond... They all bow. He bows.
The Zairian Interpreter translates English to French to
another Zairian, who speaks Mandarin. It all gets lost in
chaos while Bingham shoots pictures and a Plimpton type
explains pedantically to Bundini...
119.
PLIMPTON TYPE
...she's an African "succubus."
Means witch doctor.
BUNDINI
Succubus? Suck my dick. They
ain't room in Africa for more than
one witch doctor. And that's B'dini.
The eyes of some of the Asians are very emotional. Ali
stands up and bows to them. Chinese bow themselves away.
Ruth Pointer arrives. Ali kisses her. She sits, but talks
to Bingham.
ALI
You been to Hong Kong?
Taiwan?
Thailand?
VERONICA
No.
ALI
I can't go there. All the ladies
out there from Indonesia, Japan,
Hawaii, India...
(high-pitched voice,
imitating female fans)
"Ali-i-i-e-e-e! Ali-e-e-e! Oh,
Muhammad Al-i-i-i!"
(speaks in faux foreign
language, imitating
female fans; to Bingham)
You seen those people from Thailand?
I was in Bangkok -- I couldn't walk.
(laughter; hangs his
head)
I couldn't...I just couldn't do
nothin'. "Get me outta this
country!"
(laughter)
The women were so pretty...
BINGHAM
'B-b-b-bout Hong Kong, man?!
You
know what I heard?
ALI
(interrupts)
Ladies in Thailand, their hair
comes down to their knees...and
they about Veronica's
complexion...and they bad!
(MORE)
120.
ALI (CONT'D)
But they ain't nothin' like the
"sisters."
(holds Veronica's
hands, looks deep
into her eyes)
Ain't NOTHIN' like the sisters!
Veronica laughs as Ali mocks swooning over her...
Another
news crew arrives.
NEWS CAMERAMAN
Champ...
ALI
(to Veronica)
Let's go for a ride.
and old people, teenagers in dirty T-shirts with strange
hats. Their eyes are wide.
REVERSE:
ALI
shows his bare hands. Now he rubs them together and
MAGICALLY pulls from his closed fist a colored scarf.
The
kids scream.
VERONICA
squints, trying to figure out how he did it, because...
ALI
shows the scarf, pushes back his cuffs so that he can't hide
anything up his sleeves. His wrists are bare. He shows
both sides. Now, he takes the scarf and pushes with his
right hand and feeds it into the closed fist of his left.
He looks up wide-eyed at everybody. Then, he opens his
fingers and the scarf is not there!
ALI + VERONICA
walk, towering over the kids. One girl holds Ali's hand.
The others maintain a respectful proximity so that they
don't invade the space around Ali.
ALI
So why you glad we still here?
121.
VERONICA
Holdin' this in Africa make people
proud. All over the world.
They're proud of you. Anybody can
fight in Vegas.
ALI
That's one job.
I got two...
They pass through cinder-block houses, shipping crates, oil
drums for cooking fires, a few car parts.
ALI (CONT'D)
(melodramatic)
...gotta whup George!
VERONICA
Islamic faith help you to that?
ALI
Listen, girl, as a Muslim, I am
busted out and failed in the eyes
of God. I shoulda discovered Islam
at 50! 'Cause I am weak on women.
They take my eyes and my heart
follow...causing me to be a lovin'
husband and a terrible husband...!
(looks down at her,
intensely)
...green eyes and cocoa skin...?
(feigns wobbly legs)
...okay, rest of me, let's go!!
Veronica laughs. She brings his hand up to her mouth and
kisses it. Hand in hand, a towering man and a towering
woman walk away at their ease against the soft sky with
their entourage of teenagers and kids. On the perimeter, a
kid does flips and, then, gets distracted...
leaving, steals a glance at Ali and Dundee. It's adversarial.
The camaraderie was not false. Both are true. But being
strategic, he is a threat to Ali. George has a first-rate team.
125.
ALI'S CITROEN - NIGHT
and outriders depart.
EVERYTHING - NIGHT
Lights flood it.
They pour down artificial sunshine.
THE PEOPLE
Ali, boma ye! Ali, boma ye!
Ali,
boma ye!
ROARS from 65,000 voices at a quarter to four in the morning.
The moon is out, revealing storm clouds.
131.
HIGH + WIDE SHOTS:
ALI
and entourage.
The crowd goes nuts.
TRAVELING WITH ALI THROUGH THE MASS
The crowd roars; Angelo behind, Bundini on one side, Pacheco
and Sarria.
They cheer. Ali raises his hand and salutes them. Ali
dances from one end of the ring to the other...dances into
George's corner... The crowd roars.
ANOTHER ANGLE:
ALI
dances back to his corner...
ANGELO DUNDEE
George is playing prima donna.
He
wants to make you wait.
Ali laughs. You won't psyche out Muhammad Ali with that
stuff. Instead, Ali uses the time. He tests the ropes. He
gets the feel of the distance between the center and the corner.
CLOSER:
ALI
circles the ring. He looks at the crowd from different
angles, from the corner, the center... He looks up at the
lights and gets used to the heat from them.
ALI'S FEET
do a shuffle. He feels the canvas. He feels the soft spots.
The firm spots. He feels how much slide there is because of
the resin on the canvas, how much spring there is in the
boards...
ALI
sheds his robe, now, and throws a blistering array of jabs
and hooks. The crowd goes nuts. Ali looks ringside and sees...
ALI'S POV:
JIM BROWN
Lloyd Price...further along...Robert Lipsyte.
out comes Foreman in his red robe, Archie Moore following in
his blue pea-cap, and Dick Sadler -- never a fashion
plate -- in the world's least-attractive T-shirt, followed
132.
by former featherweight champ Sandy Saddler.
CROWD
Foreman!
Foreman!
Foreman!
Foreman!
THE RING - ALI
is shadowboxing as Foreman climbs in the ring and crosses
past him, near to him. The look on Ali's face is indifferent.
Foreman goes immediately to his stool. He doesn't move
around the ring. He doesn't touch the ropes.
DISSOLVE TO:
DON KING
as tall as only three other men: Foreman, Ali and Bundini,
walks into the ring wearing black...
ZACK CLAYTON,
the referee, moves to the center of the ring.
A great roar
fills the air: "ALI, BOMA YE! ALI, BOMA YE!
ALI, BOMA
YE!"...another one. "FOREMAN! FOREMAN!"
OVERHEAD
as Ali, Foreman and both their crews meet in the center of
the ring.
CLAYTON
Now, both of you know the rules.
When I step back, I want a good,
clean break.
(Clayton keeps going)
No hitting below the belt, no
kidney punches, no...
ALI
Motherfucker, you 'bout to discover
you ain't nothin'.
CLAYTON
Ali, be quiet!
George's eyes glare.
Ali rocks back and forth, ready to rumble.
CLAYTON (CONT'D)
No kidney punches. Now...
133.
ALI
(past the ref;
eyeballing George)
You been hearin' about me for years.
All your life you been hearin'
about Muhammad Ali. Now you gotta
face me.
CLAYTON
Ali, I'll disqualify you. Now, I
want a good, clean, sportsman fight...
ALI
(to Foreman)
You never should have come to Africa.
Foreman is unfazed by all of this.
His cold eyes say
"battery and homicide."
CLAYTON
(blows up)
All right!!
(beat)
Now go to your corners and come out
fighting when you hear the bell,
and may the best man...win...
DISSOLVE TO:
Ali turns his back and continues to shuffle and shadowbox.
DISSOLVE TO:
OVERHEAD:
ALI + FOREMAN'S
corners are clear. Ali is facing his corner, praying to
Allah. Foreman is bent over at the waist, flexing and
releasing the last tension in his huge shoulders, as the
bell for ROUND ONE clangs...
THE RING - BOTH
charge out and stop as if they ran into a brick wall five
feet from each other. Then Ali dips, throws a left, which
George takes on the shoulder...a BIG RIGHT HAND to George's
head. The crowd goes nuts. George clinches, picks up Ali
and swings him through 180 degrees with his power. As he
puts Ali down, Ali pushes George's head down and away and
Ali clocks him with ANOTHER RIGHT. Foreman clinches and
drives Ali back to the rope. Ali throws ANOTHER RIGHT that
lands. Ali dances, circles, stays out of Foreman's way.
Then he slams him again with a right.
134.
Foreman gets Ali in the corner, throws vicious combinations
and a hook that nails Ali in the body and a wild shot hits
Ali on the side of the head. CLOSER ON ALI...stunned, his
eyes clear. He's just taken a Foreman shot. He pushes
Foreman, the stronger man, out of the way and dances and
circles. Foreman ties him up again. Ali pushes out, dances
and hits HIM with a RIGHT. Ali ties him up, and there's the
BELL.
ALI'S CORNER:
ALI
ALI
(to himself)
Legs heavy...air's heavy...like sand...
SLOWLY MOVE IN ON ALI
as Angelo and Bundini's talk fades away. We see Ali's
awareness in a deep concentration. He is holding counsel
with himself. Ali stares into space across the diagonal to
the other corner, but not really at Foreman. Ali is
weighing something. A gamble. He blinks, and whatever it
is, he's decided it NOW. AMBIENT SOUND starts to come back
as Ali's attention returns to the present and he ignores...
ANGELO DUNDEE
...keep moving. Don't let him put
you into the corner. Stay off the
rope!
THE BELL FOR ROUND TWO
Ali charges into the center of the ring, provoking Foreman
to chase him, and Ali immediately BACKS TO THE ROPE. And
stays there! Seizing opportunity, Foreman throws big hooks.
ALI IS DOING EXACTLY WHAT HE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO DO. He gets
off the rope and backs to the rope on the other side. Most
of the shots are blocked by the gloves of both men. No
damage. Then George throws a left, which Ali blocks, and a
big right hook.
ALI
turns away.
Nevertheless, it crashes into his jaw.
MACRO ALI
TIME SLOWS. He ties up George. We SEE Ali's hurt.
Dazed.
But he must make George believe he's unhurt.
ALI
That all you got...?
That it?
135.
Foreman reacts. Ali takes vicious hooks to the midsection,
hangs on and goes right back onto the ropes, tying Foreman up.
LOW ANGLE
George's shots are taken on Ali's elbows and gloves. But
for every four that are thrown, one or two tremendous hooks
get through to Ali's ribs, his side.
ALI'S FACE
reveals impact, but nothing diminishes the TERRIBLE
FORTITUDE with which he endures. Now, he ties up George.
Now, George drives Ali into the corner and pummels him.
ANGELO + BUNDINI
going crazy in the corner!
ANGELO DUNDEE
Get off the ropes! Get off the
ropes! Get off the ropes! Dance!
Ali blocking, getting hit.
WORRIED FACES in the crowd.
One
woman looks away.
ALI'S EYES
alive, more than alert, the sharpest eyes in boxing.
FOREMAN'S LEFT JAB
coming in.
Ali feints, shifts.
It misses by a quarter of
an inch.
FOREMAN HOOKS OFF HIS JAB
Ali leans back on the top rope. Foreman's punch falls short
and connects with little effect. That's how good is Ali.
The techniques BECOME CLEAR.
Foreman goes upstairs, throws three hooks, all get taken on
Ali's gloves. Foreman slams a hook that began in Cape Town
and ends up in Zaire, into Ali's abdomen. And another. Ali
takes the shots, hangs on.
ALI'S EYES
are bright like stars.
His white mouth guard shines.
A
grimace? A grin?
136.
ALI
(to himself)
There is nothin'... Nothin'!
(another Foreman
hook lands)
...I cannot take.
Ali pushes Foreman off and Ali connects with a left and a
straight right to the jaw. They pound but don't stop George.
Ali ties him up. Ali's jabs end the round. Nothing
effective, but Ali shakes his head, disapprovingly, puts his
hand on the back of George's neck, and as the BELL sounds...
ALI (CONT'D)
Thought you was bad!
George laughs.
He won the round overwhelmingly.
ALI'S CORNER
is apoplectic.
BUNDINI
Dance, dance!
DUNDEE
Get off the ropes!
What are you
doin'?!
ALI
(it gets quiet; to
himself:)
Here come George's "murder" round.
(refers to Round Three)
Ali pushes away from his handlers and rises. He opens his
arms to the crowd. We hear a massive "ALI, BOMA YE" start up.
CLOSER:
ALI
opens his arms as if the roar of 65,000 voices is sunlight.
By opening his arms, his skin soaks it in and converts it to
power. And the BELL STARTS ROUND THREE.
They trade. Nothing. Foreman advances, Ali backs to the
ropes, tags Foreman with a couple of harmless left jabs.
Now Foreman opens up with heavy artillery. Ali gets in a
couple of shots, but for the center of the round he's
pummeled by Foreman. Midway through...
FOREMAN accepts a left jab, and while Ali's left arm is out
with it, Foreman hammers a right into the exposed lower
137.
midsection of Ali and then follows it with six tremendous
hooks to Ali's abdomen. Ali pushes him away. Foreman comes
in again. Foreman gets him on the rope again, and a
surprising right on the left side of Ali's face.
ALI
ties up Foreman's left in the crook of his elbow, and they
stagger, married, awkwardly, into the center of ring. The
referee separates them.
ANOTHER ANGLE:
FOREMAN
charging and throwing heavy shots. Ali takes some on his
elbows, arms, biceps and shoulders. NOW we see Ali lean
BACK. WAY BACK. 45 degrees back... We start to hear the
TWANG of the rope. We get it. Ali is using the rope as a
shock absorber. Some Foreman punches get through, but the
rope TWANGS and Foreman's hitting a trampoline with a hammer.
Between deflection and being ring-wise, Ali dilutes much of
what George throws. Then Foreman drives three powerful
hooks into Ali's side.
ALI'S BODY SPASMS
But, as if inconsequential...
ALI
George!
Show me something.
Ali -- insulting, taunting -- snaps jabs into George's face,
talking through his mouthpiece...
ALI (CONT'D)
Where's your punch, man?!
BUNDINI/DUNDEE (O.S.)
Ali, get off the ropes! Stick 'em!
Jab! Off the ropes!
UP CLOSER:
ALI
blocks a rage of Foreman head shots with his fists, the
abdominal shots within his elbows. Each Foreman punch is a
haymaker.
FOREMAN
suddenly switches.
FROM THE FLOOR:
FOREMAN'S UPPERCUT
comes from camera and slams right through Ali's guard, right
into his jaw.
138.
ALI'S
hurt!
He holds on.
DUNDEE/BUNDINI (OVER)
Off the ropes! Dance, champ, dance!
Ali's pushed back like a rag doll.
FOREMAN
throws a right hand.
It, too, slams through Ali's guard.
He's in trouble.
ALI'S EYES
flash.
Roll in his head.
He sees neon.
TIME SLOWS...lights
dim...
ALI
(calmly)
...been here before.
ANGELO DUNDEE (V.O.)
(distant echoes)
Ali, move!
(beat)
Dance, champ!
Ali glances at the crowd. He SEES: the OLD MAN with the
transistor radio on his shoulder from the shantytown, urging
him on!
ALI
(to himself)
Open the door, Richard...outta this
room... Put on your coat,
man...get out...
THE RING:
FOREMAN
slams shots into Ali's kidneys, his ribs. Ali will piss
blood for two months. But Ali stays on the ropes. AS TIME
CATCHES UP TO NORMAL...
ALI (CONT'D)
(to himself)
Think my fight's over...? That...
(to George)
...all you got? That the hardest
you hit?
ALI comes off the rope, and Ali hits Foreman with a terrific
three-shot combination, a right-left-right. WHAM-WHAM-WHAM.
139.
Feints.
Hits Foreman with a left-right.
WHAM-WHAM!
ALI (CONT'D)
C'mon, chump!!!
The BELL. It's an Ali rally at the end. He throws Foreman
a look of contempt as he walks to his corner.
ALI'S CORNER
ANGELO DUNDEE
(panicked)
Get off the goddamn ropes!!
ALI
Took somethin' away from him, Angie,
that round...
BUNDINI
You gotta move! Stick and MOVE!
ALI
(to himself)
They don't know what's happenin'.
Ali looks to the left and sees Jim Brown.
ALI (CONT'D)
(to Jim Brown)
You bet the wrong horse! He can't
fight no better than you can act!
Jim Brown laughs.
WE DON'T HEAR A BELL. INSTEAD, WE'RE SUDDENLY IN THE LAST 15
SECONDS OF ROUND FOUR.
Ali is braced on the ropes, as far back as the ropes will go.
Foreman throws a barrage of shots, he slams in five and six
at a time. THE BELL.
ALI
covers with gloves at his head. Elbows at his ribs. When
head shots come in, Ali slips them the right or left, or
turns them into glancing shots, or just leans straight back
so that they all fall short by quarter of an inch. The BELL.
ALI
covering, taking the most powerful hooks Foreman's thrown in
the fight, one after the other to the body.
140.
ALI
(to himself)
Take it! Terrify him with what you
can take...
Ali's eyes are stars. He sees everything. He sees things
no one else can see in the quantum physics of deflecting the
force of Foreman's blows.
FOREMAN
desperate, pounds a left to Ali's side, a blocked left to
the head, three lefts to the belly, which get through!
Ali's left arm convulses downwards, involuntarily, with the
blows. What Ali's not ready for and doesn't block is the
right hand that follows. This shot is jarring and concussive.
He grabs Foreman's neck and has to hold on.
The BELL.
leaning way back at impossible angles -- soaking up George's
shots. George is SLOWER...BUT Ali's not throwing at all!
ALI
(hisses to George)
Eight more rounds... You runnin'
outta gas?
Then...Ali comes out from under.
WHAM.
WHAM.
WHAM.
WHAM.
WHAM.
Five hard shots are followed into Foreman's puffed face.
They surprise and enrage him.
WIDER:
GEORGE
drives Ali with his 220 pounds...George's arms and fists now
SWING HEAVILY. Some get through. Ali's right eye is puffy.
Both tie up. And BELL ends the round.
Angelo and Bundini talk.
Neither we nor Ali hear them.
ALI
(to himself to George)
...can't let you get that second
wind which you don't know is out
there for you.
(MORE)
141.
ALI (CONT'D)
(talking to George in
his head)
Want the title...wear the
heavyweight crown?
(to himself)
Jaw broke? Nose smashed? Face
busted? You ready to die? Is that
you?
(towards George)
'Cause you gonna meet a man who
will die before he let you win.
A tall African Girl walks by with the number "8." As she
passes near Ali, she has the audacity to wink at him. ALI
happens to see it. He winks back at her. She smiles. He
brightens right up! THE BELL RINGS.
goes to the ropes, throws a couple and, now, comes off the
ropes. He's in the center of the ring. HE'S HUNTING. A
couple of lefts from Ali. Foreman throws a haymaker and
almost falls out of the ring. Ali's in the corner, having
avoided the shot.
FOREMAN
gets in a couple of lefts that Ali deflects. Ali takes
another on the cheek, leans way back again. Suddenly, he
seems tired, as is Foreman. Tied up, they go diagonally to
the other corner of the ring, both fighters exhausted,
leaning against each other. Resting. BUT...
EXTREMELY CLOSE:
WE SEE ALI'S EYES ARE DEAD SHARP
He's faking.
FOREMAN
backs Ali into the corner.
ALI
hits Foreman with a left. Foreman launches a short left
that Ali counters with a BIG RIGHT CROSS that connects.
FOREMAN'S
head snaps around. Sweat sprays in a parabola of light.
Crowd ROARS with expectation. George Foreman tries a right
uppercut, fails as Ali circles, guiding Foreman onto the
ropes. Foreman's on the ropes NOW.
142.
ALI'S EYES
know the moment is...
ALI
(to himself)
Now...
ALI'S
short, chopping right turns Foreman's head down.
CLOSER:
FOREMAN
comes over the ropes and turns back into...
ALI'S RIGHT HOOK
slams his head down and sideways.
And Foreman charges into Ali.
CLOSE SLO-MO:
ALI
snaps a combination: an overhead right to Foreman's face, a
short chopping left and a right hook. Ali's eyes light up
like white phosphorus.
ALI (CONT'D)
(to himself)
RIGHT NOW!
FOREMAN
wrestles Ali into the center.
And the most significant
moments begin...
SLO-MO:
ALI ON THE LEFT + FOREMAN ON THE RIGHT
...and Ali's left hand is extended way behind him with the
wrist bent, no power. As it passes his body, Ali converts
it into a left hook. As he's doing this, he's dropping his
left foot back. The left foot DOES NOT support a left hand.
It's for a right hand so the body can untorque across with
the punch. And Ali is already cocking his right. Meanwhile,
the left connects with Foreman's jaw and raises his chin.
As the left is departing Foreman's chin, Ali launches the RIGHT.
SLO-MO:
AS ALI'S RIGHT HAND
comes in, Ali's torso untorques, transitioning all 217
pounds to Ali's left foot and putting that weight and power
behind his right fist that crashes into George Foreman's
chin...and the impact transfers to Foreman's skull...and
Foreman's head snaps around. He is gone. He is falling in
a spiral...a metaphor for vertigo...turning downward into
143.
unconsciousness. And through the spiral, Ali has moved with
him, pivoting with the falling Foreman, his right fist
cocked to unload again if he has to. He never does...
MASSIVE OVERHEAD:
FOREMAN
down. Ali is pushed into the corner by referee Zack Clayton.
Foreman is counted out. Clayton raises Ali's hand. 65,000
people go crazy!
TOTAL CHAOS
Ali is seized by Rahaman, Dundee, Bundini. And in the
corner, hardly seen by anybody, Ali, now, faints. Veronica,
with a DON KING AIDE, is overcome. Tears stream down her face.
As if finally released from the suspense, the sky opens.
The monsoon begins.
NIGHT
celebrate. The city is crazy with the air of liberation in
the rain. People are drunk, bowing to one another,
extending their arms and legs in strange gestures. Laughter.
THUNDER is deafening in the downpour. People celebrate
despite the storm, dancing on sidewalks on Rua Absini.
Almost empty. The downpour.
The last fans rip down one
gigantic image of Mobutu...
Rain stopped. The cold, blue light is illuminated with
magenta at its base as dawn starts to rise over the Congo River.
WIDE:
ALI
in a pale green shirt and slacks, walks towards the water,
followed by Zairians, teenagers, some kids who snuck into
the compound, two older men. No media; no elite; no hype.
One policeman who staggers, drunk. Ali doesn't so much as
walk to a destination as amble. He rubs the head of a 12-
year-old boy who starts shadowboxing five feet in front of him.
ALI
You think you got a chance, chump?
Now you in trouble.
Ali begins to spar with the 12-year-old, who is fast and
knows a little bit about boxing.
ALI (CONT'D)
You even dream of beating me?
You
better wake up and apologize!
Kid throws a punch.
Ali collapses to his knees.
ALI (CONT'D)
He too much for me!
Some laughter. Then Ali stands and puts his hand on the
boy's shoulder. He ambles with the group towards the river.
The sun's coming up on the other side.
FADE TO BLACK.
