LOS ANGELES - DAY
The whole dysfunctional megalopolis, beige and blurry in the
summer smog. If this is the American Dream, do me a favor and
wake me up.
LAX - DAY
The traffic loop outside the terminals is gridlocked -- mostly
with stretch limousines.
FREMONT PLACE - DAY
An exclusive, walled-off section of Hancock Park. There's only
one route in and out, past a manned guardhouse on Wilshire.
NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY
A Colonial-style mansion, surrounded by an imposing, wrought-
iron fence. There is a bronze plaque, in English and Korean,
next to the entranceway:
Consulate
of the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea
The driveway gate opens and a long, black Mercedes with tinted
windows and diplomatic license plates glides out.
UTILITY POLE - OLYMPIC BLVD - DAY
From atop a pole outside the south wall, a man with binoculars
overlooks the private streets of Fremont Place.
HIS POV - THROUGH BINOCULARS
as the Mercedes cruises through the quiet neighborhood.
BACK TO SCENE
The man, PAUL JAVAL, is thirtyish, nervous; with short, sandy
hair. He takes the binoculars away from his face and we see
his eyes -- they're a strange, unnaturally light gray.
Javal takes an ORANGE PILL from an unlabeled prescription
bottle and pops it into his mouth. He climbs down the pole to
a van with a phone company logo on it.
WILSHIRE BLVD - DAY
The Mercedes comes out of the Fremont Place gate, and turns
into the heavy morning traffic.
CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY
Javal's van, also with tinted windows, turns onto Crenshaw. It
follows the Mercedes, several cars behind it.
SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY
Traffic is moving at about 35 MPH. The Mercedes merges onto
the freeway, heading west. Javal's van follows.
The thumping of a RAP SONG rattles the other drivers' fillings
as a LOWRIDER with its stereo turned up to "11" cruises by.
SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY
The van follows, now directly behind the Mercedes, in a
procession of vehicles going up the long, curved overpass
arcing 100 feet above the 10, toward the 405.
FREEWAY OVERPASS - DAY
A nightmare scene of smoke, twisted wrecks, dazed victims. The
Mercedes and van sit motionless in the backed-up traffic.
JAVAL'S VAN & ROADWAY - DAY
Javal slides open a TRAP DOOR on the floor of the van. He
slips a wheeled, mechanic's repair platform through it.
ANGLE WITH JAVAL
as, unnoticed amid the chaos, he lies on the platform and
rolls under the Mercedes.
The undercarriage of the Mercedes is armored with steel. Javal
stops at a patch of perforations -- an air exchange vent. He
attaches a slim DEVICE over the vent, flips a switch on it,
then rolls back toward the van.
FREEWAY OVERPASS - DAY
The CHP has cleared a path through the devastation, and
traffic trickles through. As the Mercedes and the van pass by,
Javal looks proudly at the misery he's wrought. He follows the
Mercedes onto the 405 south.
SIERRA BONITA AVENUE - CARSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT
A pretty street in the Miracle Mile, lined with neat, single-
family homes. Timed SPRINKLER systems water some of the yards.
Every house on the block except the one we're in front of has
a "For Sale" sign on the lawn. From the weathered looks of the
signs, they've been there for quite a while.
BEVERLY DRIVE - (CARSON'S DREAM) - DAY
Quick, SILENT IMAGES: A street cordoned off with police tape.
Cops, SWAT teams, FBI surround BEVERLY THRIFT, a bank.
Carson, younger, hair shorter, sits in an FBI COMMAND TRUCK
across from the bank. Covering the mouthpiece of the phone in
his hand, he's arguing with the OTHER AGENTS in the truck.
Suddenly, a huge, fiery EXPLOSION blows out the front of the
bank building. Horrified, Carson runs toward it...
CUT TO:
CARSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT
Carson comes around to the driveway, which is illuminated by
the streetlight --
Where two 20-ish ASSHOLES are sitting in his 1965 Mustang
convertible, their presence courtesy of a huge cut they've
made in the otherwise-perfect ragtop.
Car-theft tools in a leather case between them, they're prying
the ignition switch out of the dashboard.
Asshole #1 spots Carson. He gets out of the car, wielding a
crowbar. His partner keeps working.
NEW ANGLE
Asshole #1 lunges viciously, swiping at Carson with the
crowbar, taking a piece out of his side. Carson starts
BLEEDING profusely, but he's too pissed to notice.
Carson uses his bat to take the offensive. They go at each
other like combatants in a swordfight, the CLANKING of metal
echoing through the neighborhood along with the screaming
house and car ALARMS, and frantic neighborhood DOGS.
Surprised at Carson's fury and strength, Asshole #1 backs onto
the lawn, oblivious to the running SPRINKLERS.
As he backs away, his shoe catches on one of the sprinkler
heads. It breaks off, and a huge GEYSER of water sprays out.
Carson holds his bat in both hands and jams the front of it
into Asshole #1's breadbasket. He doubles over.
Carson grabs Asshole #1's arm, and pulls it quickly against
his raised knee. There is a SNAP and a loud howl as the arm
breaks, and Carson tosses him aside.
Seeing this, Asshole #2 gives up on the car. He takes off
toward the street. Carson runs to head him off, but he's a lot
faster in his Air Jordans than Carson is in his bare feet.
WIDER
Carson grabs the metal lid from a garbage can at the curb and
FLINGS it like a huge Frisbee. It sails across the street --
And NAILS Asshole #2's head. He kisses the pavement, stunned.
Carson runs up and grabs him, but he pulls out a long, sharp
screwdriver and jabs at Carson with it.
Then, blue flashing lights appear from around the corner: A
WESTEC Chevy Blazer. Two uniformed GUARDS get out, and fumble
with their sidearms.
WESTEC GUARD
Everybody... chill! Bikini boy! On
the ground!
Asshole #2 is still trying to gouge Carson with the
screwdriver. Carson glares at the dopey Guards.
CARSON
Asshole was trying to boost my car!
ANGLE ACROSS STREET
Carson's fiftyish, black, next-door NEIGHBOR, wearing pajamas
and a robe, comes out of his house. Carson sees him.
CARSON
Mike -- call 911!
NEIGHBOR
Been trying...
(has a cordless phone)
It's busy.
(to Guards; re Carson)
He's the good guy, you schumcks.
The Guards seem to get it. Without warning, one takes out a
TASER and ZAPS Asshole #2. Carson lets go just in time.
CLOSER
Holding his bleeding side, Carson walks back to his house. He
notices the "Neighborhood Watch" sign has graffiti spray-
painted on it. He touches it -- the paint is still wet. His
Neighbor shrugs -- whatta ya gonna do?
The PAPER GUY drives by... and tosses Carson's newspaper right
under the gushing SPRINKLER.
CARSON
I hate this fuckin' town.
NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - ESTABLISHING - DAY
CARSON'S HOUSE - PATIO & KITCHEN - DAY
Miranda, dressed in a conservative skirt, jacket, black shoes,
is out on the patio. Her breakfast -- a bowl of fruit and
wheat germ -- sits on the patio table while she waters some
sickly-looking ROSE BUSHES in a planter.
Carson, dressed in shirt and tie, looking beat, fries a steak
and three eggs in butter. He comes outside with his breakfast
and a magazine article: "American Expatriates in New Zealand."
MIRANDA
(looks him over)
Have you gotten any sleep lately?
CARSON
(ignores the question)
Shop's gonna tow the car in --
goddamn ignition's trashed.
MIRANDA
Take mine. I'll ride in with Diane.
Carson watches as she carefully picks the dead leaves off the
rose bushes.
CARSON
You ask me, those suckers are a lost
cause.
She continues, then glances at the article Carson is reading.
MIRANDA
It's not for you.
CARSON
You mean it's not for you.
MIRANDA
I don't chase car thieves in my
underwear. C'mon, you'd die of
boredom if we ever sold this house
and moved.
CARSON
I'd die of shock, from finding
anyone dumb enough to buy the place.
Even for what it's worth now.
MIRANDA
Lots of people bought at the top of
the market...
CARSON
That sure cheers me right up.
MIRANDA
I don't know why we even talk about
it. The city's not the problem. So
we move. It wouldn't matter. What's
that saying: "Wherever you go, there
you are."
Carson just looks at her. Reaching for the salt, he winces
from the cut in his side.
MIRANDA
(continuing)
I hope you're current on your
tetanus booster. Was it worth it?
CARSON
One cut... two assholes in the
hospital... Yep.
Carson glances at his watch and gets up.
CARSON
(continuing)
Well, another day of baby-sitting my
favorite bunch of people...
He grabs a Bianchi shoulder holster with a Sig-Sauer P-229,
9mm pistol, straps it on, then pulls on a blue windbreaker.
Emblazoned on the back are large yellow letters: FBI.
MIRANDA
Ask for a transfer.
CARSON
They're not gonna transfer me. You
know damn well why I was bumped down
to guard duty...
(as he's leaving)
My outstanding people skills.
Miranda tries to return to tending her roses. But instead, she
sadly watches him go.
CARSON'S HOUSE - DAY
A look of sorrow crosses Carson's face as he watches some
YOUNG KIDS laugh and shove, getting onto a school bus.
He then glances at his wounded Mustang, parked in the street.
He spots something on the windshield: A pink parking ticket.
The parking sign above the graffiti-stained Neighborhood Watch
sign reads: Street Cleaning - Friday 8-10 AM.
CARSON
I hate this fuckin' town.
Carson CHIRPS open Miranda's car: a red Volvo 960.
As he pulls away, we SEE a bumper sticker on the car: a circle
and slash through cartoon weapons on one side, cartoon teddy
bears on the other, and "Arms Are For Hugging" in between.
NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY
The Driver backs the Mercedes out of the garage behind the
Consulate. We notice there is ANOTHER MERCEDES parked inside.
Mrs. Han, Sam and Joy come outside. They hear some heartfelt
SWEARING:
ANGRY VOICE (OS)
Goddamn Limey overpriced piece a
shit...
THEIR POV
In the driveway across the street, a man in a business suit
has his head under the hood of a brand-new Jaguar convertible.
The JAG OWNER's 15-year-old, blonde daughter, LISA, sits in
the car with her schoolbooks in her lap.
JOY
turns to Mrs. Han:
JOY
Can we give Lisa a ride?
MERCEDES - DAY
It pulls into the driveway across the street. The Jag Owner is
still SWEARING mightily. Lisa climbs into the Mercedes.
LISA
Hey, Joy... Sam...
Joy rolls the window up and the SOUND of cursing disappears.
LISA
(continuing)
Excellent -- I can't hear him!
SAM
(raps on window)
The glass is an inch thick.
(points to doors, roof)
Armor-plated. Bulletproof. Bomb-
proof.
LISA
Perfect car for L.A.
(looks back at her Dad)
Starts, too.
CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY
As the Mercedes travels its usual route down Crenshaw, Javal's
van begins following it.
INSERT ANGLE - UNDER THE MERCEDES
where Javal's DEVICE is attached, still waiting...
NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY
A dark-green government Dodge pulls up and parks behind one
just like it on a paved area near the Consulate gate.
DAVE JUAREZ, (chubby, 40, Mexican-American, a desk jockey) gets
out of the Dodge and hangs an FBI shield over his top pocket.
He glances over at North Korean Security Chief COLONEL LEE,
(45), who has paused inside the gate to regard Dave, and the
outside world, with profound contempt.
Dave, attach case in one hand and notebook computer in the
other, walks to a 10-by-15 detached guardhouse on the far
corner of the property, just outside the high fence.
CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY
The van drives in the lane alongside the Mercedes.
CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY
As they approach the light at Washington Blvd, just turning
yellow, Javal's van gets in front of the Mercedes.
Their lanes stop for the red light. A FRUIT VENDOR holding a
bag of oranges walks from car to car.
Javal slips the van into neutral and lets it roll back until
his rear bumper taps gently against the Mercedes' front bumper.
CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY
The Driver, Mrs. Han, Joy, Sam and Lisa pile out of the car.
Jittering with excitement, fear and speed, Javal hops out of
his van, holding a Benelli M-1, a semi-automatic shotgun.
He SHOOTS the Driver in the chest. The BLAST from the shotgun
muzzle, however, is unlike anything we've ever seen before: it
is blindingly BRIGHT, even in broad daylight, belching a huge
cluster of glowing, white-hot magnesium.
The Driver flies back against the Mercedes, EMPTYING his
machine gun into the air. The wound in his chest is full of
BURNING magnesium shrapnel.
WIDER
The other drivers in the intersection see this and go
completely nuts. Some duck for cover under their dashboards.
Others peel away. A few COLLIDE with oncoming traffic.
The Carpool Lady in the Cherokee pushes the kids down on the
floor. The Fruit Vendor hides by rolling under a car.
Sam and Joy are incapacitated by tear-gas coughing fits. Mrs.
Han stumbles toward them, trying to get them to run away.
Javal PUNCHES her, knocking her down.
He turns to Lisa, surprised to see her. Sweating, he points
the shotgun at her... almost pulls the trigger... then notices
Mrs. Han's expression of horror and thinks the better of it.
He spots a MOTORIST in a Ford Escort, peering cautiously over
his dashboard to get a look at the action.
Javal SHOOTS the Motorist through the windshield with another
bright, searing blast of magnesium. The Motorist and the
entire front of his car burst into FLAMES.
Mrs. Han is on her knees, sobbing. Javal grabs her by the arm
and pulls her to the back of the van. He opens the doors.
JAVAL
You see that I'm serious in my
intention, yes?
(she nods)
If you cooperate, you and your
children will be home for dinner
tonight.
He tightens his grip on her. She nods again, then looks at the
kids. Javal shoves her, Sam, Joy and Lisa into the van.
CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY
Several people, including the Carpool Lady, rush over to the
Driver, who lies DEAD and SMOLDERING on the ground.
His hand is halfway inside his bloody pants pocket, holding a
small plastic card with the Consulate's phone number on it.
NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY
Colonel Lee and a North Korean Army OFFICER come running out.
ANOTHER OFFICER starts up a car in the back of the house.
NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY
Ambassador Han runs out. He has a stricken look on his face.
COLONEL LEE
(Korean; to Ambassador Han)
[You must stay here.]
Ambassador Han nods. The FBI agents run up. To them:
AMBASSADOR HAN
Someone took my family!
The agents look at each other -- holy shit! Colonel Lee's car
SCREECHES to a stop. Sabatini stands in front of it.
SABATINI
You got no jurisdiction outside
this property!
Colonel Lee shoves a big, ugly Tokorev 7.62x25mm-caliber
pistol in her face as he's opening the car door.
SABATINI
(continuing)
Shit!
(to Ambassador Han)
Yank his fuckin' leash!
AMBASSADOR HAN
My men are going!
Colonel Lee jumps into the car and it screeches away, almost
running Sabatini over.
AMBASSADOR HAN
(continuing; to Sabatini)
It's a white telephone van, driving
west on Washington Boulevard.
The agents rush back to their guardhouse. Dave's government
Dodge is blocking theirs.
ROBBINS
Keys!
Dave tosses them to Robbins. Sabatini shoves Dave into the
back seat. He looks at her, dumbfounded.
SABATINI
You're ridin' shotgun.
FREMONT PLACE - DAY
Just as they race out of Fremont Place past the guard gate,
Carson, in Miranda's Volvo, comes in on the other side.
FEDERAL BUILDING, WESTWOOD - ESTABLISHING - DAY
WASHINGTON BLVD - DAY
Driving skillfully, Carson edges past the North Koreans.
WASHINGTON BLVD - DAY
Carson tries to approach Javal without drawing his attention.
WASHINGTON BLVD - DAY
During a lull in traffic, a WELL-DRESSED WOMAN jaywalks across
the street. An LAPD black-and-white changes lanes and puts on
its flashing lights. As two COPS write her a ticket...
Around the corner TWO MEN make a quick exchange of money and a
vial of crack.
NEW ANGLE
The Cops do notice Javal speeding by, with Carson's Volvo, the
FBI Dodge and Colonel Lee's car in hot pursuit. They shove the
ticket in the Well-Dressed Woman's hand and hop in their car.
LA CIENEGA BLVD / SIDE STREETS - DAY
Javal turns onto the side streets -- rows of run-down
apartment buildings. He takes a circuitous route, gaining a
one-block lead on Carson and the others.
Then, he makes a sudden turn into a one-way alley.
ALLEYWAYS
The duplicate van takes off down the alley. Just as it gets up
to speed, Carson and the others round the corner into the alley
behind it. As far as they know, they're still chasing Javal.
The alley is several blocks long, running parallel to the main
road, separated at each block by perpendicular streets. The
duplicate van races along, scraping against parked cars and
the rear walls of buildings...
ALLEYWAYS - DAY
Indeed, as the duplicate van crosses a street, cars swerve to
avoid hitting it. It continues into the next alley.
Up ahead, a garbage truck lumbers into the far end of the
alley, its metal lift-rods extended to pick up a dumpster.
CARSON (OS)
Oh, shit...
The duplicate van CRASHES into the garbage truck and EXPLODES.
NEW ANGLE
Carson, horrified, jumps out of his car. Robbins and Sabatini
run up. They have to hold Carson away from the burning van.
Dave hurries to the back of a building and gets sick.
Colonel Lee, wide-eyed with anger, gets in Carson's face.
COLONEL LEE
You should not have interfered!
Carson shoves Colonel Lee out of his way, hard.
CARSON
I'm in no mood...
Colonel Lee comes back, ready for a fight. Carson is happy to
oblige, but Robbins grabs Carson's arm.
ROBBINS
Forget about him!
By now, ONLOOKERS have begun to gather, as LAPD black-and
whites and helicopters converge on the area.
ALLEYWAY GARAGE - DAY
A block away, the garage door opens, and we hear something
eerie and unexpected: a scratchy, music-box kids' SONG, coming
from a loudspeaker.
Javal's van pulls out and we see its TRANSFORMATION: The
superstructure surrounding the body of the van makes it look
like a graffiti-covered, unlicensed ice cream vendor.
ALLEYWAYS - DAY
The entrance of the alley is blocked by a black-and-white. So,
accompanied by the SONG, Javal drives along the one-way alley
in his camouflaged van, passing unnoticed by the authorities.
Anguished, Carson is staring at the BURNING duplicate van...
CUT TO:
BEVERLY DRIVE - (FLASHBACK) - DAY
Beverly Thrift EXPLODES and BURNS...
CUT TO:
ALLEYWAYS - DAY
Carson tries to shake the memory away. He looks around, sensing
that something isn't right, then turns to the other agents.
CARSON
Let's get back to the Consulate.
Off their perplexed looks, we
DISSOLVE TO:
NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY
As the copter lands, Carson comes out to meet Walther.
WALTHER
Carson?
(Carson nods)
Walther. Who told the Ambassador?
CARSON
His Security Chief.
(beat)
There was a civilian with them --
fifteen-year-old girl from across
the street. We're trying to reach
the parents.
WALTHER
Goddamn it...
(sotto)
Look, Mrs. Han was the North Korean
Premier's niece! We're hearing
rumors they're gonna make a major
issue out of what happened here...
PYNGYANG, NORTH KOREA - DAY
SUPER: Pyngyang. Capitol of North Korea.
Poster city for the charms of Communism: dreary, crumbling,
gray, stifling, hopeless.
WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - ROOFTOP - DAY
Crouched behind an air-conditioning unit, the Major, an
American Operative, speaks in UNACCENTED ENGLISH into a small
UPLINK DEVICE, disguised to look like a palmtop computer.
OPERATIVE
(into uplink device)
...They've got the Premier agreeing
to the hard-line position --
He hears footsteps approaching (OS).
OPERATIVE
(continuing; sotto)
More to follow...
He angles skyward a tiny dish-shaped antenna on the Device. On
its screen it says COMPRESSING... SCRAMBLING... UPLINKING...
After it's finished, the Operative snaps it closed and puts it
into a false bottom in his attach case. He disappears just
before a GUARD rounds the corner.
STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY
"Welcome Pacific Partners" banners hang everywhere.
WORKERS and CATERERS prepare for the various parties and
events around town. COPS and PRIVATE SECURITY do their best to
keep traffic moving, but it's already getting congested.
WHITE HOUSE, WASHINGTON, DC - ESTABLISHING - DAY
NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY
Inside, the grandfather clock in the foyer CHIMES THREE TIMES.
Colonel Lee, carrying an AMD-74 machine gun, goes to get in the
driver's side of the second armored Mercedes, but Carson is
already there. Grumbling, he crosses to the passenger's side.
Carson drives off just a moment before Colonel Lee is
completely in the car.
HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY
The Mercedes crosses Melrose, going into Hollywood. The town
is all done up with posters and banners.
Robbins and Walther follow a block behind the Mercedes in an
unmarked car; Sabatini and Dave drive ahead in Dave's Dodge.
HIGHLAND AVENUE - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY
Robbins and Walther are inching along in traffic on Highland
near Hollywood Blvd.
Elsewhere, we see unmarked police and government cars cruising
around, dropping off disguised FOOT-SURVEILLANCE OFFICERS, etc.
A BIKER CLUB
of twenty aging, weekend-warriors, all on custom Harleys, turn
from the Boulevard onto Highland.
DEMILLE BARN - DAY
Carson drives the Mercedes into the entrance of the Hollywood
Museum Park. Carson stops in front of a yellow barn with a
sign atop it: "Jesse Lasky Famous Players."
JAVAL'S VAN - DAY
Still disguised as an ice-cream truck, the van is parked
across Highland by the entrance to the Hollywood Bowl, where a
Summit-related concert is being readied.
Javal watches the Mercedes, and takes his last pill. He's flying.
DEMILLE BARN - DAY
Javal's van drives into the parking lot, and stops right above
the bags of money.
DAVE
(into radio)
Our boy's in a fuckin' ice cream
truck!
ODIN STREET - DAY
Sabatini and Dave watch Javal's van through the trees.
HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY
At the complex intersection where Highland ends at the 101,
Javal bears to the right, toward the South on-ramp.
Sabatini and Dave follow a few cars behind as he gets on it.
Suddenly, he scoots over to the shoulder and slams the van
into REVERSE. He backs off the on-ramp, past a row of angry
drivers, passing by Sabatini and Dave.
Peeling in reverse onto Highland, Javal stomps on the brakes.
The snap buckles holding the ice-cream-truck superstructure
around his van BREAK APART, and the whole thing slides off...
blocking Sabatini's way.
Javal drives forward again, this time getting onto the 101
North on-ramp.
HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY - DAY
Colonel Lee leans out and SHOOTS Javal's rear tires out.
The van drives erratically, held in its lane by bumping
against the cars around it.
Carson pulls up closer...
Suddenly, the rear doors of the van burst open...
And Javal flies out, riding a motorcycle. He's got the money
stuffed into two big, chaps-sized SADDLEBAGS slung over the
back of the machine.
He straddles the lanes, going against traffic, riding like a
maniac back the way he came.
Carson watches him in the rear-view... and speeds up, driving
away from him.
COLONEL LEE
Turn around!
But Carson hugs the shoulder, moving through the heavy
traffic, until he spots what he was looking for:
The Biker Club, riding in formation up ahead.
Carson cuts in front of them and slams on the brakes. He jumps
out and grabs one of the Biker's machines by the handlebars,
wrestling it to a stop. While pulling its BURLY OWNER off it:
CARSON
FBI. Call our office, they'll take
care of you.
Meanwhile, the other BIKERS have come to help their friend.
They pull guns, knives, chains...
They're stopped by Sabatini, who appears holding her MP-5
machine pistol. The Biker yells at Carson as he drives way:
BIKER
I'm a taxpayer! I'm a goddamn
dentist!
COLONEL LEE
gets in the driver's seat of the Mercedes and turns it around.
JAVAL
continues down the freeway on his bike, straddling lanes,
driving the wrong way, retracing his route back to Highland,
leaving CAR HORNS, CURSING, and COLLISIONS in his wake.
WIDER
When everyone thinks they've seen it all, here comes another
mad biker -- Carson -- riding against traffic in pursuit.
HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY
Javal rides against traffic down the Cahuenga on-ramp, then
jumps the divider, runs the light crossing Highland, and gets
into the southbound lanes.
He just misses a BUS, nearly wiping out.
CARSON
Just don't kill yourself, you piece
of shit...
Carson fishes out his two-way.
CARSON
(continuing; into radio)
Helicopter or two would be nice!
HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY
Speeding up, Carson precariously cuts in between traffic.
CARSON
(to himself)
Not just now, dear...
Seeing Carson approaching on his right, Javal pulls his Benelli
shotgun from one of the saddlebags. He rests the barrel on his
arm and FIRES a blinding-white load of magnesium at Carson.
Carson grabs the brake handles to slow down, and the BLAST
crosses just in front of him. A few BURNING pieces pepper the
front fender of the bike, but the bulk HITS the concrete art-
deco statue in the entrance to the Hollywood Bowl. The statue
shatters into a million FLAMING fragments.
CARSON
(continuing; grumbling)
I coulda had a ranch... maybe some
horses... but no, we moved to L.A.
JAVAL
speeds up. A car passing on the right BUMPS him. Javal grabs
for the handlebar to stabilize himself, DROPPING the shotgun.
A HELICOPTER appears, and flies just above him.
Then, spotting some police cars ahead, he quickly hangs a
right, ducking onto Alta Loma Terrace.
ALTA LOMA TERRACE - DAY
Carson stops at the entrance to the winding, hillside
neighborhood, accessible only by footpaths. The area is
covered by thick foliage, hiding Javal from the helicopter.
Carson revs down so he can listen for Javal's machine. He
HEARS it up above and takes off, up a steep flight of stairs.
NEW ANGLE
Javal has reached the summit, only to find he's boxed in. He
can either turn around, or take the neighborhood's unique,
outdoor elevator, housed in a free-standing, three-story
concrete tower.
He jumps off his bike. Carrying the saddlebags, he runs into
the elevator -- but it needs a key to operate.
Javal comes back out, panicking.
He HEARS Carson coming up
the hill. He spots a GARDENER watering nearby with a hose.
ANGLE WITH CARSON
as he reaches the summit. He sees Javal's motorcycle,
abandoned, lying on its side...
And then he sees the Gardener, sprawled on the ground, a
BULLET HOLE in the center of his forehead.
Carson turns off his motorcycle and pulls out his Sig 9mm. He
moves slowly toward the elevator tower and looks inside.
HIS POV
The casement window in the back of the tower is broken. One end
of the gardener's hose is tied to a grate, and the hose is
hanging through the broken window.
Carson looks out the window as Javal climbs down the outside of
the tower on the hose to High Tower Drive, the street below.
CARSON
(into radio)
He's on foot, at the base of the
elevator tower!
But just as Carson is about to climb down the hose...
HIGH TOWER DRIVE - DAY
Javal spots a COLLEGE GIRL backing a tiny Geo out of her
garage. He rips her out of the car, jumps in and tears away.
ALTA LOMA TERRACE - DAY
Carson jumps back on his motorcycle and starts it up.
CARSON
(into radio)
Goddammit! He's in a blue Geo!
HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY
In the Geo, Javal drives out onto Highland. He muscles his way
through traffic, then cuts across to Franklin.
Behind him, Robbins and Walther drive along the divider lane.
On the bike, Carson emerges from Alta Loma, joining Sabatini
and Dave in Dave's Dodge and Colonel Lee in the Mercedes as
they all try to catch up to Javal.
The helicopter flies ahead, then disappears past the hill
below Franklin.
VINE STREET - DAY
Javal hangs a hard right off of Franklin onto Vine, putting
him on top of a hill that drops down to Sunset.
Carson and Colonel Lee close in on the Geo.
Suddenly, the helicopter RISES UP from the bottom of the hill.
It's less than fifty feet in front of Javal, at eye level.
Javal FIRES at the copter with his Beretta.
Colonel Lee indiscriminately FIRES his machine gun at the Geo.
Carson SHOUTS at Colonel Lee, furious at his carelessness!
VINE STREET - DAY
Everyone on the road scatters to get out of the copter's way.
It appears as though it's going to crash onto the street, then
it gains altitude, GYRATING wildly just above the Geo.
Javal tries to move away, but one of its landing runners
SMASHES through the top of the windshield, WEDGING itself
against the inside of the Geo's roof.
Snared, the little Geo is LIFTED off the ground -- instantly
too high for a terrified Javal to escape from it.
VINE STREET - DAY
The copter and Geo lurch over and past the round Capitol
Records building, KNOCKING the spindle off the top of it.
The impact further destabilizes the copter's flight. It's
heading right toward the 20-story Sunset Vine Tower, at the
bottom of the hill.
SUNSET VINE TOWER - DAY
The copter and the Geo CRASH into the side of the Tower, 12
floors up. Glass blows out in all directions; the rotor
shatters; office furnishings are blown through the hole like
backwash.
The Geo hangs passenger's side down from the runner.
CLOSER
From the series of jerking, slipping MOVEMENTS, it is clear
the copter is not going to stay where it is for long.
The Geo's passenger side door pops open. Javal, panting with
fear, jimmies his foot against the dashboard and holds the
steering wheel to keep from falling out.
ANGLE ON VEHICLES BELOW
In the clog of traffic, cars swerve away, rapidly reverse...
anything to get away from the area below the impact.
JAVAL
reacts to another SLIP. The big saddlebags of money on the
seat start to slide toward the open door.
He gingerly reaches over to grab them... the copter SHIFTS
again... he loses his grip...
And, clutching the saddlebags, he TOPPLES out of the car.
We stay with him as he FALLS 12 stories, SCREAMING...
Then LANDING on top of a parking meter. It RIPS though his
chest and he hits the sidewalk with a wet THUD.
VINE AND SUNSET - DAY
Carson rushes across the street to Javal's body. The teetering
copter and Geo are right above it.
Grimacing, Carson tries to lift Javal's body up off the
parking meter, but it's messy, slippery work...
Unable to move the body, Carson quickly searches its pockets.
All he finds is the now-empty prescription bottle.
Above, the copter GROANS... it's about to come loose...
Carson pulls out his Sig 9mm and FIRES several times at
Javal's right wrist, then TEARS the HAND off the body.
With a loud WRENCHING of metal, the copter and Geo break away
from the building.
Carson grabs the saddlebags and runs like hell across the
street, diving for cover behind a car.
BEHIND CARSON
the copter and Geo crash to the sidewalk and EXPLODE.
NEW ANGLE
Sooty, covered in Javal's blood, Carson crosses to the others.
He throws Walther the saddlebags and Sabatini the severed hand.
CARSON
Fingerprint it.
(to Walther)
He's not gonna tell us where to find
the hostages...

CARSON (Cont'd)
(looks at watch)
Meaning we got exactly 80 minutes to
figure it out for ourselves.
WALTHER
Figure it out?! With what?!
CARSON
(ignores him; into radio)
Miranda! We need a copter, pronto!
(to Robbins)
Get back to his van. There were no
plates, but check the VIN, look it
over, then meet us at the Consulate.
Robbins is still trying to process what just happened.
CARSON

PACIFIC OCEAN - ANGLE ON FISHING TRAWLER - DAY
SUPER: Pacific Ocean. 500 miles west-northwest of Los Angeles.
We FIND a nondescript commercial fishing vessel. Up top, some
Asian "FISHERMEN" crank in and stow their nets.
FISHING TRAWLER - DAY
Coming closer, we see it's actually a disguised North Korean
SPY VESSEL. Several MEN, working under hanging tarps, secure
a 20-foot-long missile launching track to the bow.
Two MISSILE EXPERTS install a green, cone-shaped WARHEAD of
high explosives onto the nose of a 23-foot-long, short-winged
CRUISE MISSILE. They wait for the CAPTAIN's orders...
HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY - DAY
Robbins is in Javal's van, examining the innards of the remote-
control boxes. He picks up his radio.
ROBBINS
(into radio)
A lot of the components are made by
the same manufacturer -- a car
security company.
CARSON (VO)
(thru radio)
Jump a copter to the Consulate. See
if the manufacturer sells to the
public. Find out what shops use their
stuff; put people on the phones with
a description of the perp.
CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY
At the kidnapping site, the intersection is blocked off with
yellow police tape. Several LAPD cruisers are parked nearby.
Some COPS are interviewing the Carpool Lady.
Despite this, the neighborhood's bazaar -- a sidewalk sale
with MUSIC, food vendors, etc. -- has half-heartedly begun.
The government helicopter HOVERS and Carson helps Miranda climb
down a long chain ladder. Colonel Lee follows impatiently.
NEW ANGLE
Carson uncovers the bodies of the Driver and the Motorist,
lying on the sidewalk. He grimaces. Colonel Lee does not.
Miranda wants to look, but Carson drops the cover. She picks
it up, then turns away in horror.
A young BLACK COP crosses to them. He's holding a plastic bag
with a spent shotgun shell in it.
YOUNG COP
Inspector! Look at this...
(reads from shell)
"Dragon's Breath..?"
CARSON
Twelve-gauge shell filled with
magnesium and ignition powder. Shit's
worse than napalm -- Geneva
Convention outlawed it for warfare.
MIRANDA
Then how did he get it?
CARSON
Easy -- you can buy 'em mail order.
(looks around)
Where's the Consulate's car?
YOUNG COP
(beat)
Uh... apparently it was stolen...
COLONEL LEE
Stolen!? What is it with you
people --
YOUNG COP
(angry)
-- What's this "you people" shit?
CARSON
(to Colonel Lee)
Shut up!
MIRANDA
(aside; to Young Cop)
He means all of us "you people."
CARSON
(to Young Cop)
Find it! How many bulletproof
Mercedes could be cruising around
Crenshaw?
YOUNG COP
You'd be surprised...
CARSON
I hate this fuckin' town.
FISHING TRAWLER - PACIFIC OCEAN - DAY
The North Korean COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER puts down his
headphones and hurries on deck to the Captain. It's time.
Suddenly, a BEARDED CREWMAN crosses to the Captain. He calmly
SHOOTS him and the FIRST MATE.
The rest of the Crew is shocked. Holding his pistol on the
Crew, the Bearded Crewman nods at the Missile Experts.
Saluting, they remove the green warhead from the missile.
Two OTHER CONSPIRATORS, carrying a metal locker, appear from
below deck. The Crew murmurs nervously as they remove from the
locker a red warhead and attach it to the missile.
Finishing, one of the Experts pushes the firing trigger and
the missile WHOOSHES from its launching pad.
NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY
The government helicopter touches down behind the Consulate.
PYNGYANG, NORTH KOREA - ESTABLISHING - DAY

...Missile heading to L.A. has a

Kipchak equipped! It was switched by
order of --
A GUNSHOT rings out (OS), and the Operative's chest EXPLODES
in blood. He pitches forward... but presses the "transmit"
button on the uplink device before dying.
On screen it says UPLINKING... (without scrambling)... then
another GUNSHOT destroys it.
Angry, General Kai steps INTO FRAME and kicks the Operative
over with his foot.
APARTMENT BUILDING - CLOSE - DAY
A team of GARDENERS has arrived on the property for their
weekly mow, blow, and go. They have lawnmowers, edgers, blowers
-- it's as NOISY as an aircraft carrier during takeoffs.
STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY
LAPD cruisers squeeze through the crowded streets, fanning out
through the various parties around town. COPS walk through the
crowds with copies of the picture Javal faxed, and photos of
the Han family and Lisa.

K-EYE STUDIOS - LANDING PAD - LOS ANGELES - DAY
Just as the government helicopter lands, Bobbi's news copter
lands right next to it.
Bobbi intercepts Carson, Sabatini, Miranda and Colonel Lee on
the pad. Her Cameraman follows, ENG camera on his shoulder,
videotaping everything.
CARSON
Oh, great, the media...
(realizing)
It's the goddamn traffic girl!
MIRANDA
Traffic person.
BOBBI
Where are you going?
CARSON
We can't get into that right now...
BOBBI
Hey, you expect to use my station's
facilities and not even tell us --
Carson grabs the ENG camera, pops the videotape out of it and
crushes the tape.
MIRANDA
(to Bobbi)
Sorry...
BOBBI
(looks Miranda over)
What the fuck are you, the Barbie
Corporate Ass-Lick model?
Miranda is utterly aghast. She reaches under Carson's jacket
and takes the handcuffs off his shoulder rig. She grabs Bobbi
by the arm and gets her in a half-Nelson.
MIRANDA
Guess what, Sister... you're about
to spend the next five years in a
penitentiary for interfering with a
federal investigation.
The STATION MANAGER comes running out of the building.
STATION MANAGER
Bobbi! I promised we'd respect their
news blackout!
BOBBI
(to herself)
Figures... you dickless wonder.
Bobbi wriggles out of Miranda's grasp. Carson looks at his
wife, who's still fuming, and smiles to himself.
The Station Manager hands Carson the keys to his Lexus.
STATION MANAGER
I get an exclusive later, right?
CARSON
This works out, I'll play the
fuckin' banjo for you.
SKY OVER PACIFIC OCEAN - DAY
The cruise missile makes a slight course adjustment.
STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY
People begin to arrive at the events. BOOSTERS pass out food,
wine and beer... and crank up the Beach Boys TUNES.
Meanwhile, law enforcement cars move into the areas with high
rises -- Century City, Westwood, downtown, etc.
U.S. AIR BASE - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY
A sign on the control tower reads: U.S. Air Force, Okinawa.
Flight Crews direct a squadron of planes out onto the flight
line: F-16 fighter bombers, along with F-15 fighter escorts.
They begin to TAKE OFF...
FOUNTAIN AVENUE - DAY
The Lexus is stuck in a dense knot of traffic.
Carson gets out and walks across the hoods of the stopped
vehicles around him -- to much COMPLAINING by their owners --
until he finds the reason for the jam-up:
Along the shoulder of the road, a long line of equipment
trailers and motor homes, cables, lights, rent-a-cops and
gawkers. A MOVIE SHOOT. Carson groans.
He hurries back to the Lexus. Miranda rolls her window down.
CARSON
We're hoofing it.
Miranda and Colonel Lee immediately get out of the car and run
off, leaving Sabatini to contend with it.
SABATINI
(pissed)
'She's got the field experience'...
To park the fuckin' car!
MIMOSA APARTMENTS - DAY

ADJACENT APARTMENTS - DAY
The SWAT team SHARPSHOOTERS crouch on the roof.
SWAT TEAM #1

Feds going up -- Anglo male and
female; Asian male.
MIMOSA APARTMENTS - DAY
The SWAT sharpshooters watch from the next building over as
Carson, ten floors up, peers through the slit in between the
curtains into the window of Javal's apartment.
He swings his legs over onto Javal's ornamental balcony... the
bolts holding the rail onto the wall are loose and rusty...
the balcony SLIPS a little...
He leans on the crank-operated window until it SNAPS open.
STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY
The streets of Hollywood are even more congested than before,
as the festivities really start rockin'.
BEVERLY THRIFT - (FLASHBACK) - DAY
Carson is in the FBI command truck, talking on the phone to:
A BANK ROBBER, barricaded inside the bank. Phone in hand, he
holds a shotgun on a dozen hostages: BANK EMPLOYEES and
CUSTOMERS -- including a couple of YOUNG KIDS. One is holding
a soccer-sized, rainbow-colored rubber ball.
The OTHER BANK ROBBER wires up a series of explosive charges.
Both Robbers rush inside the vault, and pull the door closed
to protect themselves...
The front of the building, where the hostages are, EXPLODES.
Carson runs to the bank. He spots the kid's ball, rolling in
the street... BURNING. He turns away, horrified, devastated...
DISSOLVE TO:
WILSHIRE BLVD - DAY
The city's reaction to Bobbi's announcement is immediate and
severe. It makes the panic during the '92 riots look like a
drive in the country.
NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY
Carson bursts through the door just as the second armored
Mercedes CRASHES through the wrought-iron entry gates. Carson
fires several SHOTS, which ping harmlessly off the Mercedes.
Carson sprints for a car. Miranda's Volvo is the closest one.
FREMONT PLACE - DAY
Colonel Lee crashes through the Fremont Place guard gate, then
hangs a right on Wilshire. He drives the center turn lane,
zooming past the snarl of cars.
NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY
In the back of the Consulate, Miranda, sore as hell, climbs
into the government copter. It WHINES to life and TAKES OFF.
SKY OVER LOS ANGELES - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
Several large military helicopters approach -- troop
contingents from Pendleton and Ft. Irwin.
The big CH-54 dual-rotor copters set down and offload MARINES
and ARMY INFANTRY.
Others, like Apache Gunship combat copters and Hueys, begin to
follow the pursuit. They join the police and TV copters, and
it looks like the Ride of the Valkyries.
STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY
People flee from the festivities in droves. Seeing the
helicopters and TROOPS in bio suits only fuels the hysteria.
We hear news REPORTS coming from car radios, boom boxes, TV's.
Reporters chatter urgently in English, Spanish, Japanese,
Korean, Farsi, their voices mixing with the shouts of
pedestrians, the rumbling and horn-blowing of the traffic...
Everyone, everywhere is getting into their cars in a mad dash
to get out of town or rendezvous with loved ones.
This is the mother of all rush hours.
WESTERN AVENUE - DAY
Colonel Lee's car turns right onto Western Avenue. He's in the
heart of Koreatown -- hardly any of the signs are in English.
He swerves through the panicked drivers jamming the roads --
in the center lane, or into the oncoming traffic. The cars he
HITS crumple against the Mercedes without slowing it down.
Carson's Volvo follows, squeezing through traffic in its wake.
WESTERN AVENUE - DAY
Colonel Lee gets stuck in a line of cars trying to get onto
the 10 East. Above, a swarm of HELICOPTERS circle him.
COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - DAY
Colonel Lee depresses the trigger on the launcher and a
rolling-pin-sized rocket is EXPELLED.
SKY ABOVE WESTERN AVENUE - DAY
The rocket SLAMS into a police helicopter just in front of the
Apache, creating a huge FIREBALL, turning the copter into two
tons of red-hot shrapnel.
WESTERN AVENUE - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY
The burning hull of the police copter CRASHES into a mini-
mall, causing a FIRE and EXPLOSION.
Hot metal and debris PINGS and POPS as it rains over the

HELICOPTERS - DAY
Vreeland's Apache and the remaining helicopters scramble away.
VREELAND
(into radio)
Out of the air, or retreat 7,000
meters from target vehicle!
The copters set down in parking lots, rooftops, wherever.
Armed troops climb out to keep PANICKED MOBS from swarming
them in an attempt to leave the city.
SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY
Other drivers, not knowing whether Colonel Lee's rocket is the
biological missile, scatter away from him. Colonel Lee
squeezes onto the freeway on-ramp.
SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY
Several police cars clear a path for two huge, yellow DWP
BULLDOZERS borrowed from a construction cite.
They rumble up onto the eastbound freeway, turn, and then
stop, side by side, facing oncoming traffic. They lower their
huge front shovels to create a roadblock.
STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY
All of the celebration locales are trampled, abandoned messes.
So much for "Fun Fun Fun" and L.A. putting on its best.
MOBS make panicked runs on the stock in grocery, drug and
hardware stores. Violence breaks out in the aisles and parking
lots.
PEOPLE in their homes work feverishly to seal their doors and
windows against the plague with tape, towels, plastic.
SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY
The windows on the Mercedes glide open....
Carson hurries to catch up to it...
Colonel Lee FIRES a rocket at the bulldozers through the
driver's side window. The BACKBLAST from the launcher vents
through the passenger's side.
The ROCKET impacts the bulldozer on the left; the EXPLOSION
actually FLIPS the huge machine head over tail into the air.
The bulldozer lands upside down on the lane divider, crushing
a portion of it.
Colonel Lee rolls up his windows and drives around the burning
wreckage.
The other drivers really give him wide berth now...
HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY
Approaching downtown, Colonel Lee turns onto the 110 north.
HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY
A red and white LAFD paramedic's ambulance puts on its SIREN
and hurries to the Volvo. Two PARAMEDICS jump out.
CARSON
Get me out of here...
They pry his door open with a crowbar. Carson climbs onto the
roof of his car. Grimacing from pain, he looks around.
CARSON
(continuing; into radio)
Anybody see him?
MIRANDA (VO)
(thru radio)
Still heading north on the 110.
The Paramedics pry the passenger door open and help Ambassador
Han out. Carson looks at the ambulance. He's getting an idea...

south... I'm on an ambulance by the
9th Street exit.
MIRANDA (VO)
(thru radio)
Are you out of your mind?
HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY
Carson waves his arms as he sees a helicopter approaching.
The glare from the sun masks the copter's markings. It HOVERS
above him. With the canvas bag slung over his shoulder, Carson
jumps up onto the runner, then climbs up inside the cockpit.
NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
The door opens and Bobbi comes TUMBLING out of it!
WIDER
They're hovering above the roof of a high-rise hotel downtown.
Bobbi lands with a huge SPLASH in the rooftop swimming pool.

Carson replies by tossing her industrial-sized bottle of
Mylanta out after her.

COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - DAY
Colonel Lee calmly aims the rocket launcher and FIRES.
HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY
Miranda and the L.A. Cop, both holding small tear gas pistols,
split up. Crouching behind the cars on the freeway, they sneak
up on the stopped Mercedes.
HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY
Miranda is climbing the metal stairs leading to a graffiti-
covered freeway sign.
HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY
Avoiding coils of razor-sharp concertina wire around the sign,
Miranda FIRES a tear gas canister at the Mercedes' sunroof.
It misses, bouncing off the windshield, filling the area with
white smoke. Colonel Lee keeps his eye on the copter...
HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY
Colonel Lee spots Miranda, up on the freeway sign, loading
another tear gas canister. He STRAFES the sign.
She flattens; the BULLETS tear through the sign above her.
The L.A. Cop rushes the Mercedes. Colonel Lee FIRES at him,
hitting him across the legs.
Colonel Lee ducks back into the Mercedes and drives away.
VARIOUS ANGLES
As Miranda comes down from the sign...
Carson climbs up the embankment from Sixth Street to the 101...
The downed L.A. Cop waves as a pair of ambulances drive up,
lights flashing and sirens WAILING.
Carson runs alongside one of the ambulances, pulling the
driver's door open before it's stopped.
The Paramedic is the one who helped him and Ambassador Han out
of the Volvo. Carson yanks him out of his ambulance.
MIRANDA
Sorry...
HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY - DAY
Carson suddenly cuts to the left. When they reach the Glendale
Blvd exit, he SLAMS the ambulance into the side of the
Mercedes, forcing it onto the freeway off-ramp.
GLENDALE BLVD - DAY
Carson keeps BUMPING the Mercedes as they reach Glendale Blvd,
running right alongside the lake.
With a hard shove, Carson sends the Mercedes SKIDDING off the
road, through the small guardrail, and INTO the lake.
Carson slams on the brakes, fishtailing the ambulance into the
grass surrounding the lake. Sig 9mm in hand, he hops out.
The Mercedes is so heavy that it's already half-submerged.
COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - DAY
WATER pours in from the floorboards, the air vents...
Colonel Lee climbs out through the sunroof and FIRES at Carson
with his AMD-74.
ECHO LAKE - DAY
Carson ducks behind the ambulance, takes careful aim...
And SHOOTS Colonel Lee, WINGING him in the shoulder. Colonel
Lee's machine gun goes flying, and he tumbles into the water.
Meanwhile, Cops, Army, Marines, etc. arrive via helicopter and
car. Major Vreeland is among them. The news media, ENG cameras
bouncing on their shoulders, run alongside them.
CLOSER
Carson races over to grab Colonel Lee, who is slogging out of
the lake. There is a glint of bright steel... and Colonel Lee
SLASHES at Carson with a knife.
Carson moves aside... but the knife SLICES across his upper
arm. Carson falls backwards.
Colonel Lee, on hands and knees, tries to crawl away. Suddenly,
someone KICKS him in face, flipping him over.
It's Miranda. Colonel Lee's knife goes flying.
Carson, bleeding, piles onto Colonel Lee. Vreeland assists.
Colonel Lee fights like mad to break free...
Until Miranda JAMS her heel into his groin. He cries out.
MIRANDA
Ever hear of "fuck-me" pumps?
Well, these are fuck you pumps!
(pushes harder)
Where's the family?
Surprised at his wife's new negotiating technique, Carson
shoots a look at Vreeland. Vreeland grimaces.
ECHO LAKE - DAY
While Miranda continues to apply encouragement to Colonel
Lee's gonads, Ambassador Han limps over. He yells some ORDERS
at Colonel Lee. After a moment, Colonel Lee sags.
AMBASSADOR HAN
Let him up.
Carson's not so sure, but they're completely surrounded by
military and law enforcement personnel. He releases his grasp.
Miranda removes her heel.
Then, with lightning reflexes, Colonel Lee grabs Vreeland's
Rock Island Arsenal Colt .45 Auto from its snap-holster.
COLONEL LEE
Victory!
Carson dives back onto him. But he twists his arm around and
PULLS the trigger -- with the muzzle underneath his own chin.
Carson, Miranda and Ambassador Han are SPRAYED with his blood.
WIDER
Dumbfounded everybody looks at each other...
Carson, dogged, kneels next to Colonel Lee's body and searches
through his pockets, looking for something, anything.

Carson feeds out a steel cable from a winch...
Then throws a spring-loaded grappling hook onto the thick,
iron balcony railing.
Hanging onto a webbed rescue harness, Carson slides quickly
across the line, onto the balcony. Using the butt of his Sig
9mm, he BREAKS a hole in the glass on the locked sliding glass
door. He reaches through and unlatches it.

Carson is helping Joy get free of her chair. As she stands,
the pieces of her hair stuck to the gum over the microphone
head begin to PULL the gum away!
Mrs. Han sees the meter heading for the red, and the yellow
warning light flashing... She grabs Carson's arm.
Carson quickly covers the mic... The meter drops to zero.
WIDER
The FIRE is spreading across the carpet and walls. Carson is
hurrying everyone out onto the small balcony. He helps Lisa
into the rescue harness. She's terrified.
CARSON
You'll be over in five seconds...
She nods. Miranda pulls her across the cable and send the
harness back. Carson turns next to Sam, but he stands back so
his sister can go.
ANGLE ON BOMB
One minute... fifty-nine seconds...
CARSON

He pushes her across. As soon as she's there, he gestures to
the Apache Pilot to move closer so he can release the hook.
ANGLE ON BOMB
Thirty seconds... twenty-nine...
THE HARNESS
slides back across to him; Carson grabs it with one hand and
tries to undo the hook buckle with the other...
But the cable is crooked, and the buckle is JAMMED -- if he
can't release it, he's stuck there! Carson tries to free the
hook, but it's dug in between the concrete and the railing.
Fifteen seconds to go...
Carson looks over at the helicopter and waves them away.
CARSON

Release the cable from your side!
Get out of here!

The entire railing around the balcony BREAKS away, with Carson
HANGING on the harness next to it...
The helicopter turns and flies away...

The bomb EXPLODES, blasting a huge hole in the tower.
All the windows in the nearby towers and apartments IMPLODE.
CARSON

APACHE HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
The force of the blast HITS them like a tidal wave. The Pilot
fights to keep control while looking for a place to set down.
BELOW
Huge chunks of debris, glass, furniture, etc. rain down.
Carson and the section of railing underneath the helicopter
swing like a pendulum from the force of the blast.
Groggy, he loosens his grasp on the harness, and jumps clear
as the helicopter lands.
Miranda leaps out of the Apache and runs to him...

Dust and debris from the explosion hang in the air;
