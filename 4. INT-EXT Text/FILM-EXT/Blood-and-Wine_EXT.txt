Alex throws open the back door; he's counting on the
element of surprise.
HIS POV
His red Cadillac convertible is idling nose.to the chain
locked across the parking lot. A MAN in his twenties,
whose tropical shirt fairly glows under the security
lights, is using a pair of bolt cutters on the chain.
ALEX
(ADVANCING)
You think you're gonna steal my car,
asshole?
The younger man whirls around.
YOUNG MAN
You scared me, man.
A middle-aged man, a REPO MAN, calls out lazily from
behind the wheel.
REPO MAN
This is not your car, sir. This car
belongs to the Star Leasing Company.
Alex buries the gun in the rear of his waistband as though
he's rubbing his stiff back and cranks his smile to a
higher wattage than the security lights.
REPO MAN
I can collect either the money or
the car. Given how much you owe, I
figure it's the car.
The younger man has almost hacked through the chain.
ALEX
Pop the. trunk.
REPO MAN
We inventory the property at the
yard.
He keeps his eye on the chain, ready to gun the engine as
soon as the exit is clear.
ALEX
I just want to show you something.
Worked by the combination of natural curiosity and Alex's
charm; the repo man pops the trunk and gets out of the
still-running car.
(CONTINUED)

6 CONTINUED:
In his hand he has the locking "Club" Alex usually uses to
secure his. steering wheel. He's not stupid. Amused, Alex
takes a step back, palms up.
YOUNG MAN
What are you doing?
The repo man ignores him and looks in the trunk.
ALEX
Do you drink?
REPO MAN
Not on the job. What is this,
booze?
ALEX
Two cases of single malt whiskey
aged in the barrel before he was
born.
REPO MAN
The Caddy's overdue.
ALEX
So are you. Drink it with the kid.
Teach him what smooth is. Enjoy
yourselves. Isn't that worth a few
days' breather...
(A BEAT)
My accountant's a fuck-up. So am I,
maybe, for not firing him.
The bolt cutters clip through. The chain falls.
YOUNG MAN
We're clear.

Alex turns into the garage of an expensive condominium
building before the gate has slid all the way open. The
TIRES SQUEAL as he powers the car around the corner.
(CONTINUED)

8 CONTINUED:
A DUCATI MOTORCYCLE
hogs his space. Alex lays the car in tightly. He has to
squeeze out the door. He bumps the Ducati. It starts to
topple; he grabs it before it goes over.
9
On the flying bridge of an old fishing boat, Jason eases
the throttle to idle speed. The engine quiets down. The
SWELLS SLAP harder against the wooden sides. The boat
dips and dances to the music of the water.
Jason swings down the ladder. He sets up his linis to
troll. The starry dome of the sky is starting to brighten
around its rim. Jason leans on the transom and stares at
the flat, silvery wedge of wake. He breathes out a word.
JASON
:. Bite...

14 CONTINUED:
Nothing happens. He doesn't move. Then the top of one of
the rods shivers slightly, goes still. Jason delicately
fingers the rod like a blind man reading Braille, to feel
for vibration. A smile pulls at his mouth. He steps
behind the rod. The fish hits.
JASON
(CALLING OUT)
Henryl Fish ont
The line screams out. Jason's ready. He sets the hook.
JASON
Time to go to work, man! C'mon.
A tall, black drifter appears from-below, still yawning,
scratching. HENRY, 33. He wears a red Panama hat that's
weathered his head for some time.
HENRY
Who we got?
JASON
Let's find out.
He hauls back on the rod, the line rises from the ocean,
they both recognize the fish at the end.
HENRY
Fucking sharks. Miami's fished out
of the good stuff. Damn.
He spits over the side. Jason grins.
JASON
This one's got more to worry about
than you do.
He starts to reel in the fish. Henry moves to the wheel.-
HENRY
Just shoot 'Jaws' in the water. I
want to know the sucker's good and
dead 'fore he sets a fin in my boat.
You got a barb on that hook? .
JASON
Oh, yeah.
Jason braces for the fight.
13.
15
Jason and Henry are cutting the shark with the speed and
dexterity of professionals.
HENRY
The Gulf, man, that's the place.
And what makes you think fifty-fifty
is right? My boat. My gas.
JASON
My skill.
(slicing off the fins)
... My fins.
16
Jason and Henry slap their catch onto the Fishmonger's
slippery counter. The market's noisy, men shouting. We
see the negotiation from a distance.
Jason and Henry walk through the hubbub.
HENRY
You cool?
JASON
I'm cool.
HENRY
We cool.
Jason guns his Ducati.
Jason jams on his helmet and starts his. motorcycle, guns
it down the street.

20 CONTINUED:
MIAMI SKYLINE
Jason weaves through traffic, expert enough to take
chances that goose the adrenalin.
21
Robert and Alex are loading cases of wine into the trunk
of the Caddy when Jason skids into the parking lot. He
takes off his helmet.
ALEX
Just get in the car.
22
The Cadillac rolls to a stop at the ate. A tough, but
amicable-looking armed guard in his forties, MIKE, opens
the window of the air-conditioned booth. His RADIO is
tuned to the FOOTBALL GAME.
ALEX
Hi, mike -- what's the score?
MIKE
(CHECKING THE
APPOINTMENT BOARD)
Dolphins down by nine, minute forty
to go. It's over.
ALEX
Don't underestimate Marino.
Mike ticks off the appointment, raises the gate.
MIKE
I told you, they don't have it this
year.
With a wave of acknowledgment for Mike, Alex.. drives onto
the grounds.
ALEX
(YELLING BACK)
 Judas!
Grinning, Mike routinely writes down the license plate
number.
17.
24
Alex cruises past a collection of oversized villas, and
turns into the driveway of the gaudiest. He and Jason
climb out of the car. Alex opens the trunk. He loads two
wine cases into Jason's arms, takes the third himself.
They haven't said a word to each other.
25
Alex rings the intercom with his elbow. Gabriella's VOICE
CRACKLES in response.
GABRIELLA (V.O.)
on the intercom)
Who is it?
ALEX
Wine delivery.
The INTERCOM CLICKS off. They hear FOOTSTEPS approaching.
The door opens. Jason's eyes focus. He's hooked.
Gabriella is smiling at Alex. She has her arms full of
clean burp cloths.
GABRIELLA
Oh, the boss himself!
ALEX
(with a modest chuckle)
How are you?
She glances politely toward Jason, not at all expecting
what she sees. A circuit connects between them.
ALEX
Gabriella takes care of Baby Reese.
(TO GABRIELLA)
This is my stepson, Jason.
GABRIELLA
(VERY CORRECT)
How do you do.
JASON
Hi.
GABRIELLA
Is the wine for the boat? Come
through the house.
18.
26
They follow her inside. Jason takes in the richness of
the place, but is more focussed on Gabriella. They exit
TO T
he lawn which leads to a dock.
27
A sleek, ocean-going yacht is tied up at the dock, the
crew unobtrusively at work. FRANK REESE, a powerful,
confidant man in his mid-sixties, is sitting with his
INSURANCE AGENT at a table on deck where policies are
spread out next to a jewelry box. Reese's expensive 35-
year-old wife DINA has turned her chair to sun her legs
while she plays with the BABY.
DINA
-- what's the point of having it, if
I can't wear it, Frank?
AGENT
(DEFERENTIALLY)
You can wear it anywhere you like,
Mrs. Reese -- except out of the
country.
Gabriella leads Alex and Jason aboard. Frank likes Alex
and is glad to see him. Alex can't help glancing at
Dina's long legs.. She smiles.
FRANK
Alex, should we insure the wine
while we're at it?
His arms tired,'Alex is happy to set down the case.
ALEX
Aren't you covered on your home
policy?
GABRIELLA
(TO JASON)
I'll show you, come on.
AGENT
How much wine are we talking about?
Jason follows Gabriella down below, the VOICES on the deck
fading.
DINA (O.S.)
Why bother insuring it? Let's drink
it instead.
19.
28
The agent is putting a magnificent diamond necklace in a
velvet pouch that he fastidiously cinches and ties.
Alex looks away from it to take a bottle out of the
remaining case on deck.
AGENT
-- so back to the safe it goes --
Dina lifts up the baby and smells its bottom.
FRANK
Dina, that's disgusting.
DINA
The alternative is using your
fingers, Frank. which offends you
more?
Alex laughs. Frank pushes back his chair.
FRANK
Don't encourage her, Alex. Her
mouth is big enough.
Dina is hurt.
FRANK
(to the agent)
I'll show you that painting in our
stateroom.
The agent follows him away.
ALEX
(kindly; to Dina)
Do you want to see the label?
She hides her hurt by not looking at him.
DINA
Just open the bottle, Alex. Pour us
both a glass. I'm not allowed to
drink alone.
When she turns her head and looks at him, she's flirting.
22.
30
Gabriella. lifts the fussy baby from Dina, her hands sure
and calming. She coos nonsense to his little ear as she-
reaches for the diaper bag and slings it over her arm.
GABRIELLA
He.'s ready for his nap.
(CONTINUED)
23.
31
31 CONTINUED:
Frank and the agent return from another section of the
boat.
FRANK
You doing up to the house,
Gabriella?
(off her nod)
Want to take this with you?
He sweeps the policies into a large manila envelope, drops
the 'pouch in with them, ties the string, hands it to her.
FRANK
Put it on my desk.
He looks at his wife with her glass, Alex with his glass,
and doesn't like it. His voice hardens slightly.
FRANK
Are we all set, Alex?
ALEX
I'm going to check the storage room,
see what else'll travel. I know I
put some vintage Armagnac in there,
maybe some Porto?
He heads down the gangplank.
FRANK
He's a vendor, Dina. It's like
drinking with the help.
DINA
(DISARMING HIM)
Did you pick the wine, sweetie?
It's lovely.
Frank grins, pleased. His hand curves around her
shoulder. He has forgotten about the other vendor
present, the agent.
AGENT
(AWKWARDLY)
So I'll messenger over the rider for
your signature --
Frank laughs out loud, in a better mood:
FRANK
-- You still here?
Dina laughs, too.
24.
32
Alex climbs the open stairs, heads down the cantilevered
walkway, knocks at Victor's door.
For an instant Alex doesn't recognize the uniformed
repairman who opens it: Victor, disguised.
VICTOR
(TICKLED)
Like it?
45
The Cadillac pulls up, Alex driving, Victor beside him.
Mike is not in the guard booth, the gate is closed.
47
Alex goes into the booth, finds the appointment board,
checks off "Gates Wine -- Repair," and presses a button
that opens the gate.
Down the side of the house, the dock. can be seen, empty.
Alex rings the front bell. victor is carrying a tool kit.
There's no answer. Alex rings it again.
VICTOR
Tell me we're at the wrong house.
Alex raises a hand to wave, Victor turns.
THEIR POV
GOLF
Mike, the guard, is rolling toward them on a security
cart. He pulls over.
RESUME SCENE
ALEX
(ALL CHARM)
There you are, Mike.
MIKE
Don't flip the gate like that.
ALEX
I was helping you out. I checked
off the appointment, didn't you see
it?
He rings the doorbell again.
MIKE
They sailed out this morning.
ALEX
I know., but the nanny's supposed to
be here --
Victor rolls his eyes, unseen. The nanny.
MIKE
-- The Venezuelan? They fired her.
(with a snigger)
Don't pay to be too good-looking in
these jobs.
Victor interrupts the gossip. He -sounds exactly like a
repairman.
VICTOR
I got a schedule to keep, Mr_ Gates.
Is this gonna be another day?
(CONTINUED)

50 CONTINUED:
ALEX
It can't wait.
(TO MIKE)
He'll lose his entire wine
collection if the humidifier isn't
fixed.
MIKE
(TO VICTOR)
What's your name?
VICTOR
Harold Freeman.
Mike notes the name "Harold" stitched onto his coveralls.
MIKE
Okay. Stay here. I'll get the
keys.
He rides away on his cart. Victor sits down in the shade
to wait. He stifles a cough.
VICTOR
Dear God. A cop on the job.
ALEX
You all right?
VICTOR
(a little too sharply)
Why wouldn't I be?
51
Jason follows her toward her car parked down the street.
JASON
Congratulations.
GABRIELLA
You don't know anything!
JASON
You hated it there!
GABRIELLA

GABRIELLA (Copt' d )
Now I have to go stay at my cousin's
place -- my cousin, her husband,
their four kids, and two cats. I
hate cats.
JASON
What's wrong with cats?
GABRIELLA
They shed on the couch I'll have to
sleep on. You know how long it took
me to find that job? Everybody
thinks they're running for office.
You don't have papers, they don't
even want to meet you. And the only
real way to get legal is to get
married. Do you understand?
He opens her car door for her.
JASON
So let's go get married.
Gabriella looks at him. They connect.again; it scares
her.
GABRIELLA
... Are you old enough to vote?
She slides behind the wheel.
JASON
(TARTLY)
You're not too much older. Are you
going past the wharf? You can gimme
a ride.
He's already walking around the car to get in the other
side. Gabriella smiles in spite of herself and reaches
over to unlock the door for him.
GABRIELLA
(as he climbs in)
Aren't you working?
JASON
It's my lunch break..
GABRIELLA
Well, let's not tell the boss I
stole you.
41.
54
Gabriella watches Jason walk with a long stride toward
Henry's boat. She likes the way he moves. Henry is
nearby drinking beer with some Haitians. Jason talks to
him for a moment. Henry glances down the walkway to
Gabriella, then hands Jason his. keys. Jason gestures to
Gabriella to come down.
58
Mike is shutting off the water while Alex watches when
another GUARD, mid-30's, turns the corner.
GUARD
(TO MIKE)
What are you doing?
Mike looks up, wet and muddy.

58 CONTINUED:
GUARD

His uniform is crisp, and his nature is alert and
suspicious.
MIKE
The valve's stuck.
GUARD
That's the sprinkler valve.
Mike climbs out of the bushes with injured dignity.
MIKE
Okay, you do it.
GUARD
(QUIETLY)
Is he the homeowner?
ALEX
(CHEERFULLY)
No.
59
Jason drops anchor in turquoise waters off a sand bar, no
other boats around. Gabriella takes in the idyllic
surroundings.
JASON
You can learn on the fish around
here, but you can't eat 'em.
They're junk fish.
GABRIELLA
Will you teach me?
He laughs.
JASON
Oh, you think you're ready for that
kind of commitment?
(CONTINUED)
45.
62 CONTINUED: 62
She grins and shrugs.
GABRIELLA
I'm only investing an afternoon.
She takes in the landscape, breathing in the lovely
isolation.
GABRIELLA
Where are we?
JASON
My father used to bring me here.
She hears something in his tone.
GABRIELLA
(GENTLY)
No more?
Jason concentrates on securing the boat.
JASON
He's dead. He drowned in a storm.
She shivers involuntarily.
JASON
He was a fisherman.
GABRIELLA
I don't know if I would like boats
after that.
He smiles.
JASON
I feel close to him when I'm on the
water.
GABRIELLA
How old were you?
JASON
-- Eight. I'd just turned eight.
She takes his hand. He tightens his fingers through hers
and looks out at the horizon, trying to control the
emotions her sympathy has roiled. Gabriella senses this.
She puts her arms around him, kisses him on the cheek.
They stand, holding each other. Then Jason, on impulse,
kisses her on the lips.
46.
63
Jason is standing behind Gabriella, helping her cast. His
arm grazes her breast.
JASON
You can do anything you want out
here -- you can swim nude, you can
Her laugh cuts him off.
GABRIELLA
I am not taking my clothes off.
JASON
(flustered, irritated)
That's not what I meant.
ONTO
He reels the line out of the water. Gabriella climbs
the rail. She's barefoot. The breeze blows her thin
dress against her legs.
JASON
HEY
She dives into the water. He kicks off his shoes, dives
in after her.

65
Jason is sprawled half across Gabriella on the deck of the-
boat, a seat cushion under her head. He has his hand in
her panties. She clutches his wrist and pulls his hand
back into sight. He lifts his head to look at her.
GABRIELLA
(SOFTLY)
I can't.
He sits up, offended.
JASON
You waited long enough to tell me.
Gabriella arranges her clothes.

66 CONTINUED:
GABRIELLA
(FLARING)
Because it felt good, and I'm an
idiot!
He fondly touches her face with the back of his hand.
JASON
No, you're not.
She scrambles to her feet.
GABRIELLA
I want to go back now. Can we go
back, please?
JASON
... Sure.
He stands up and moves to the helm, his legs stiff with
injured dignity.
Gabriella sits down on the bench, the cushion clutched in
front of her.
Jason sneaks a look back at her. With her hair wet and
her makeup washed away, she looks younger than he does.
She's resting her chin on the edge of the cushion.
He switches on the engine and eases the boat forward over
the anchor, engages the power winch. The CHAIN starts to
CLANK.
JASON
I'm sorry.
She turns her head toward him.
GABRIELLA
What?
JASON
(LOUDER)
I'm sorry!
GABRIELLA
Me, too.

A bridge has parted. Underneath, the boat makes its way
on the opalescent water.

67 CONTINUED:
Skyscrapers swagger down either side of the river, their
windows bright squares against the darkening sky. The
signal BELL SOUNDS.
68
She locks her car and walks toward the elevator, carrying
a department store shopping bag. The garage is darker
than she likes. Her HEELS ECHO against the cement walls.
She walks a little faster.
Suzanne backs out the door pulling the suitcases, right
into Jason. She cries out in fright.
JASON
-- Hey, hey.
SUZANNE
(FRANTIC)
-- Don't go in therel We're
LEAVINGS
He sees the blood smeared all over her face, her clothe:,,
and charges past her.
SUZANNE
- JA-SONII
55.
Jason runs for the car with his gear and climbs in.
Suzanne peels away before the door is completely closed.
He gets out and lopes around the car to the driver's side.
The car recedes down the highway.
86
Gabriella is sitting on the front step with her suitcase,
waiting. She rubs her legs as though she has been there
a long time. The DOGS are BARKING inside.
87
Jason is waiting behind the wheel.
Suzanne gets back in the car. She has pulled a cotton
sweater over her bloody clothes and washed her face.
She's presentable again, and subdued. He starts the
car...
Suzanne and Jason cross the parking lot toward the coffee
shop, which anchors a suburban surface mall. He notices
a jewelry store. They reach the restaurant. He opens the
door for Suzanne.
JASON
Order something for me, okay? I'm
stiff, I need to walk around.
He's already walking away. Concern and exasperation
cancel each other; she goes inside.
As Jason and Suzanne reach the car, he sees the jeweler on
the sidewalk now, outside the store, gesticulating to a
sign painter.
JASON
MOM --
He wants to tell her he took the necklace.
SUZANNE
(BREEZILY)
-- No, 1111 drive.
The jeweler happens to glance in their direction. Jason
ducks into the car, unnoticed.
Jason and Suzanne are sitting on a small, rickety pier,
eating from the takeout boxes open on their laps.
SUZANNE
-- I feel... exhilarated.
JASON
Adrenalin does that.
SUZANNE
-- It ain't adrenalin, it's freedom.
And she slips her wedding ring off her finger and hurls it
overhand as far as she can. It drops into the sea.
SUZANNE
(EXULTANT)
I don't want one goddamn thing of
HISS
She eats with gusto. Jason is staring at the water.
JASON
I can't believe you did that.
At the reception window Suzanne is checking in with the
MOTEL OWNER, a solidly-built, ruddy woman in her fifties
who shouldn't wear sleeveless blouses. Suzanne has her
wallet open. Her fingers hesitate at the credit card.
OWNER
There's a cash discount. Ten
percent.
SUZANNE
(SMILING)
Sounds like cash.
She starts to count it out.
Ensconced at a table under an umbrella, Jason is writing
on a paper towel.
JASON (V.O.)
Dear Gabriella. I don't know if
you'll get this letter. I don't
know if I'll send it. All I know is
that for some reason I need to write
it...
SUZANNE AND THE OWNER

Suzanne isn't offended.
SUZANNE
He's my son.
The owner gives her a startled glance.
OWNER
You look great!
Suzanne laughs.
Jason is sitting on the lawn chair outside the room door,
working on his letter again under the yellow bug light.
The Coke MACHINE HUMS noisily next to him.
JASON (V.0.)
That day on the boat made me realize
I understand the sea better than I
do the world.
The. car speeds north. Alongside, the Gulf shimmers under
the mirror of the sky.
JASON (V.O.)
-- I know what lure to use to catch
any fish in the water, but what's
the lure for a woman? Truth? Lies?
Jason is fishing.
JASON (V.0.)
-- I caught a fish that had three
hooks grown through his lips. Three
times he'd gotten away. He kept
taking the hook.
64.
Jason is gutting and skinning his catch.
JASON (V.0.)
It occurs to me that you're the
fisherman, not me. I can feel the
tension of the line. I've taken the
hook just like he did.
CUT TO:
A MAP OF THE GULF 106
Coastal towns have been crossed out, one after the other.
Jason has put on his suit, changed his looks. He sizes up
the store.
67.
The classified section already folded and marked beside
her, Suzanne has propped herself on her elbows. She's
looking out to sea. Talking heads bob like buoys, the
waders. She notices, some distance away, a man in a suit
walking along the beach. The image amuses her. He's
moving in her direction. She finally recognizes Jason and
raises her hand.
SUZANNE
(CALLING OUT)
Hey, sailor...
She puts on her hat to cut the glare. From under the brim
she admires his approach.
SUZANNE
(as he reaches her)
... Look at you. What's the
occasion?
Jason squats down beside her and balls up the classifieds.
JASON

She stands up, brushes off the sand, rolls up her towel.
SUZANNE
So we're packing.
They start walking together. From the water a MAN calls
out to Suzanne.
MAN
Hey, I thought you were coming back
in.
She smiles and waves goodbye.
SUZANNE

GUY-
She and Jason keep walking. He no longer looks like a
boy.

Alex is waiting for victor outside.

ALEX

They can't be too far.
Victor stares at him.
VICTOR
I never understand your optimism.
ALEX
Or he wouldn't have lied.
HENRY (O.S.)
Hey, mister!
ALEX
(TO VICTOR)
I think you made a friend.
Victor turns around, Alex keeps walking.
HENRY
is in the doorway to the bar.
HENRY
What's it to you if I see the kid?
Victor smiles.
From a distance we see Jason follow a beefy, jeans-wearing
salesman into the building.
Jason is helming a classic wooden fishing boat, THE
HERCULES II, old and not too big, but with good lines.
He's purely happy.
72.
121
Jason steers toward the beach and drops anchor. There's
a cabin among the palmettos. No car.
122
Suzanne takes a flat of geraniums out of the trunk and
sets them on the porch. She opens the door.
124
NEAR THE
Modest, nondescript. Victor parallel parks
jewelry store with his usual careful manner.
134
It barrels up the highway, passing the same landmarks
Suzanne and Jason did.
138
A storm is blowing in, and Jason walks quickly along the
docks to his boat and swings aboard.
78.
140
The waves have already started to slap against the sides
of the boat. Jason tosses over his fenders and secures
them to protect the boat from the pilings. He starts
toward the cabin. The lock has been popped. The door is
slightly ajar. He hears a NOISE inside. He draws his
knife.
141
Jason lopes along the quay, toward the businesses at the
far end. The sky is about to open.
143
The rain is sheeting down. Cars fishtail slightly on the
grease not yet washed from the streets.
VICTOR
reaches his car with a long stride; he can't run.
145
She stops at a light.
147
The upside-down car rips through a fence, slides down off
the road. The engine dies. The only SOUND is the
SPINNING back TIRE and the WINDSHIELD that now caves in.
154
Victor swerves to the side of the road. Alex leaps out of
the car and runs toward the wreck. Victor follows at a
slower pace, opening his umbrella. He's still eating his
apple. He sees a neighboring house light come on in
response to the crash.
AT THE WRECK
Alex is trying to open the jammed door when Victor reaches
him.
VICTOR
We don't have much time.
Through the window they can see Suzanne and Jason, both
unconscious, limbs entangled, covered in glass. Suzanne
is hemorrhaging from a gash in her side. Her leg twitches
in spasm.
Car headlights pass by on the road.
ALEX
We need to get some help!
VICTOR
Already on the way, I'm afraid.

Alex kicks out what remains of the back side window and
slithers into the car. Victor calls in after him.
VICTOR
Open the trunk, please.
He walks toward the back.
155
The car is rocked far enough forward on its hood to enable
the trunk to open. The contents cascade onto Victor. He
starts his search, the apple gripped between his teeth.
157
SIRENS begin to be heard, closing. Victor bends down next
to the car.
VICTOR
Alex, c'mon, get out of there.
159
Alex's feet pop out through the window. He's trying to
shimmy himself backward out of the car, harder than going
in, the principle of a lobster trap.

ALEX
HELP MET
Victor grabs his ankles and pulls. Alex starts to
reemerge.
161
Victor picks the lock. Alex doesn't follow him inside.
Alex is sitting on the stairs, staring out at the Gulf.
He gives no indication of having heard Victor.
Jason is running down the road, his face contorted.
172
Jason keeps running onto the sand. He kicks off his shoes
and plunges into the water and swims. Swims until he's
exhausted and gasping. He tips his head back in the water
and screams his grief to the pitiless sky.
173
A truck pulls over, Jason swings down and waves goodbye.
174
Jason appears, walking down the street. He looks into the
garage. Seeing Alex's Cadillac, he smiles a tight smile.
175
Alex carries his suitcase toward the condo.
181
Alex puts his key in the lock, opens the door.
ALEX

Gabby?

Jason. is walking along the docks. He turns suddenly.
Victor melts into the doorway of a shed, but not before
Jason has glimpsed him. Jason walks faster. A couple of
Fishermen he knows call out greetings. He hops onto a
docked boat.
191
Jason jumps from boat to boat. He pushes them apart so he
can't be followed.
192
When he leaps ashore again, he has shaken Victor. Or so
it seems.
193
Foot up on the lowest crossbar of the balcony railing,
Alex leans on his crossed arms and watches her step into
a cab. He's pleased.
HIS POV
Gabriella waves to him.
106.
Jason guns the motorcycle into the street, Gabriella holds
him tight.
Victor's car merges into traffic several cars behind them.
(TRAVELING) 200
The RADIO MUSIC playing, Victor weaves through traffic.
He keeps the motorcycle in sight.
202
Jason checks in his mirrors.
IN THE MIRROR-
He catches sight of victor's car, the same one that was
following his mother.
JASON
accelerates. Gabriella nuzzles his neck.
Jason jams the motorcycle TOWARD us, PAST us. Behind,
Victor's car suddenly squeals through a U-turn.
JASON
looks back.
A few Truckers make remarks as Gabriella walks toward the
bank of phones. "Hey, pretty lady." "Possibility?"
"She's not your type." She doesn't mind swinging her hips
a little for their benefit.
207
The motorcycle cruises up the coast road. The surf glows
with plankton.
GABRIELLA
presses her cheek against Jason's back.
211
Jason secures the motorcycle. He puts his arm around
Gabriella, they walk down the dock to his boat. He helps
her aboard.
JASON
(CALLING OUT)
HENRY --
Henry emerges from the cabin. He eyes Gabriella.
HENRY
Oh, my.

211 CONTINUED:
JASON
This is Gabriella. She's my
contraband.
She looks quickly at Jason, who smiles. Henry reaches out
to shake her hand.
HENRY
Kid's a sucker for dark skin.
On watch, Henry finds his gaze sliding to the NOISY
dockside BAR, its beer sign beacon-bright. The SOUNDS
BELOW embarrass him. He makes up his mind. He swings off
the boat and heads toward the bar. He doesn't notice
Alex's Cadillac idling in the alley. The headlights click
off, the motor goes silent. The BOATS CREAK against the
slips.
Jason finishes setting the lines.
JASON
-- Okay. I'm ready to listen.
He sits down beside a pole and looks over at Gabriella,
who has put on a hat. She's staring out to sea.
JASON
(TO GABRIELLA)
Alex wants to make me an offer.
She gives no sign of having heard him.
ALEX
We're giving you a hard choice,
Gabby. Two rich men.
Gabriella swivels her head slowly.
GABRIELLA
I don't want either one of you.
A line quivers. Jason reels in a little.

215 CONTINUED:
JASON
Something's going to bite, just
ABOUT --
(his biceps tightening)
-- now.
And the bait is taken at the moment he said. The line
reels out very, very fast. He lets the fish run with it.
Gabriella has turned around to watch. Now Jason reels in
a little, making the line taut, testing the weight.
He yanks back. The line rises from the ocean, bringing to
the surface a big, dark green fish. _
ALEX
Jesus! What the hell is that?
JASON
Hammerhead. Young. Male.
Jason plays the shark until it's close to the boat and
thrashing for its life. Gabriella's scared.
GABRIELLA
Help him, Alex.
ALEX
I'd just get in his way.
His hand comes to rest on her shoulder as Jason expertly
reels in the bucking hammerhead. She shrugs away from his
hand. Jason has hooked a ten-foot, three-finned sea beast
with a spade-shaped head and black eyes on each side. He
attaches the line to a winch and winds it up onto the
deck. It twists wildly, knocking things over until it
slows down and finally lies very still. His chest heaving
with the effort, Jason looks around. Alex has disappeared
without either of them noticing.

dropping out the open gate in the transom.
ALEX
scrambles toward the necklace.
GABRIELLA
Don't let him have it! He'll kill
USL
Jason grabs her-and holds her with both arms to keep her
from going any closer. Alex turns his head, puzzled,
warned. Too late. The shark suddenly thrashes, its jaws
snapping around him. Gabriella screams with Alex. He
FIRES his GUN over and over until it's empty. The shark
continues to tear at him.
ALEX
Help me, help.mel!
Gabriella runs down into the cabin. Much as he hates
Alex, Jason can't let him die. like this. He charges.
forward and straddles the shark, jams the blade of his
knife into the primordial brain. He twists the handle
once. The shark dies instantly. Trembling with
adrenalin, Jason gets off its back. With his elbows Alex
drags himself out of the jaws. He's badly mangled.. The
shark slowly changes color to a dull brown.
ALEX
You knew it wasn't dead.
Jason squats down beside him to access his injuries.
JASON
Mom didn't take the necklace.

Alex struggles to stay conscious.
ALEX
Then you killed her yourself.
Jason slowly nods.
JASON
And you were in the car behind us.
Gabriella drops down beside them. She has a flare gun, no
longer needed, and sheets from the cabin to stop the
bleeding. She starts to tear them up. She's crying
slightly.
GABRIELLA
We were supposed to turn him ini I
didn't think you were going to kill
him!
JASON
Well, I didn't.
Alex manages to laugh.
ALEX
Jesus. You set me up. You had her
call me.
(TO GABRIELLA)
Shit... I believed you.
Jason pushes to his feet and heads for the cockpit.
JASON
I'll get on the radio.
Gabriella wraps the strips of sheet tightly around what's
left of Alex to bandage. She smears away the tears so she
can see and leaves blood tracked across her face. She
looks down to see his bloody hand clutching the necklace.
They look at each other.
JASON
has the microphone in his hand. He's setting course.
Gabriella appears behind him. She's holding the flare
gun. She puts it back where she found it, and steps
beside him and puts her arm around his waist. He lays his
arm over her shoulders and holds her close while he uses
the radio.
JASON
This is Hercules II, calling the
Harbormaster...
The boat heads back to port.
219
At an unused pier Gabriella leans back against the line to
hold the boat in place. Henry and Jason carry Alex off
the boat and lay him on the planks. SIRENS can be faintly
heard. Jason leaps back on the boat. Henry pushes them
off.
CLOSER ANGLE
HENRY
You cool?
JASON
I will be.
HENRY
See ya.
He and Jason wave goodbye. The boat moves out. Henry is
left with Alex.
ALEX
(weakly; to Henry)
What's your name?
HENRY
No way --
ALEX
(still the salesman)
-- No, listen, listen -- this is
worth a fortune.
(thrusting the necklace
TOWARD HIM)
Play the possibilities.
HENRY
Yeah. Good advice.
And he walks away fast.
ALEX
Wait, don't go! Come back here.
Come on back!
Henry's gone. Alex rolls onto his belly and starts
dragging himself down the dock, too much of an optimist to
give up hope in a hopeless situation.
