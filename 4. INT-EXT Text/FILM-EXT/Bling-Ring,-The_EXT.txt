A Toyota parks and five teenagers get out and walk towards
us, down a quiet residential street in the Hollywood Hills.
One of them, a slightly drunk girl in a pale blue Juicy sweat
suit stumbles.
DRUNK GIRL (NICKI)
(laughing)
Shit.
GIRL 1 (REBECCA)
C'mon. Hurry up.
They come to a gated home. A girl that seems to be the
leader, leans down and pulls on an unraveling part of the
bottom of the chain link fence.
She rolls under, and the others follow.
A loud song kicks in as they put their sweatshirt hoods up in
unison and turn around and walk backwards toward the house.
They've done this before, they have it down.
One checks under the mat of the front door, we follow them as
they go around to the back, checking doors, and find a back
window open.
A guy gives Girl 1 a lift up, we see her bright underwear as
she climbs inside into a laundry room.
She runs around to open a side door for the rest, and they
slip inside.
Once inside, we follow REBECCA into a bedroom dressing area.
She is the 17 yr-old Korean-American ring-leader, who is
totally cool and composed.
She looks over her shoulder at the others with a raised eye-
brow.
REBECCA
Let's go shopping!
And she pulls open the closet door.
CLOSE UP: grabbing Louis Vuitton bags.
A drawer opens with a few Rolexes, that are scooped in to a
