      Wild and unforgiving.  Can almost see the fossilizing 
      carcasses of dinosaurs scattered across the red dirt.  

      FLOAT toward a breathtaking waterfall.  Long, white sheets of 
      water plunging into a languid blue green pool below... all 
      surrounded by red craggy cliffs.  Reaching for the sky like 
      they re trying to escape.  

      CLOSER... you see three little specks clinging to those 
      cliffs... people... three women in their late 20's, wearing 
      cut off shorts, bikini tops and hiking boots.  

      CLOSE ENOUGH now to see the dirt under their fingernails, the 
      strands of hair clinging to their faces in sweat.... No sound 
      but water pounding water and the girls  labored breath as 
      they climb...

      Finally they reach the top.  The wind swirls with mist.  For 
    a moment, they just stand on the cliff s edge looking out at 
      the jaw-dropping view.  Then they look at each other -- a 
      mixture of awe, pride and conspiracy.  

      They grab hands and JUMP --

                                                                          SMASH TO:


      Kat weaves her way through the crowd, juggling all her crap.  
      The heel breaks off her shoe and she stumbles.  Screw it.  
      She takes off the shoe and keeps running... 

                                  KAT (V.O.)
                    The night of the face-frying, wrist-
                    breaking incident, my other best 
                    friend Zoey had the same test to 
                    study for.  But unlike me, she went 
                    to the party...


      Kat limps/runs up the steps and through the lobby.  Hits the 
      elevator button a few hundred times till it opens and she 
      steps inside...  

                                  KAT (V.O.)
                    Oh, and the next morning?  She aced 
                    the test.  I, however, got a B minus. 

      As the doors slide closed...


      Zoey pushes outside like she s being chased.  Her carefree 
      attitude suddenly wiped clean.  She leans against the 
      building and closes her eyes, fighting against tears...  

      Opens them to see all the people walking by.  So much life...  
      She pulls out her phone.

                                  ZOEY (ON PHONE)
                    Yeah, I d like to know if it s 
                    possible to change the departure 
                    date on a plane ticket.


      Walking arm in arm.  Elan s eating cheese puffs.   

                                  ZOEY
                    Nice dinner.                                                                                    11.


                                  ELAN
                    I ll have you know all four food 
                    groups are represented in this bag.  
                    You got your cheese: protein and 
                    milk.  Puffs...
                          (scanning the ingredients)
                    Some kind of corn product, so 
                    there s your bread.  And, um, chili 
                    and lime: fruits and veggies.

                                  ZOEY
                    Well then, please to share.

      They crunch.  But Zoey s distracted, contemplating whether or 
      not to tell him what s going on--  

                                  ELAN
                    I m sorry I have to play on one of 
                    our last nights together.

                                  ZOEY
                      Actually... I wanted to talk to you 
                    about that... I changed my ticket.

                                  ELAN
                          (hopeful)
                    You leaving later?

                                  ZOEY
                    Earlier.  Tomorrow.

                                  ELAN
                    What?  
                          (stops walking)
                    Wow.  I m trying not to take this 
                      personally, but why are you in such 
                    a hurry to get out of here?  
                      Australia s not going anywhere.

                                  ZOEY
                    I m just going crazy waiting. 

                                  ELAN
                    And I was going crazy thinking we 
                    only had a week left...

                                  ZOEY
                    Elan.  Really.  I just have to go.  
                    It has nothing to do with how I 
                    feel about you.

                                  ELAN
                    Obviously not.
                          (beat)
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    12.

                                  ELAN (CONT'D)
                    I have to get back to sound 
                    check.

      Zoey opens her mouth to say something, then stops -- she 
      can t.  Elan leans in and kisses her.  A damn good kiss.  

                                  ELAN (CONT D)
                    Why d I have to meet you now?

      And he goes.


      Kat, Zoey and Rebecca throw their spankin  new backpacks onto 
      the security conveyor.  (Note: Kat wears an old NY ballcap.)

                                    REBECCA
                    God, I m regressing -- I haven t 
                    had a backpack since college.  What 
                    am I doing? 

                                  KAT
                    I know, I got the you re-crazy-you-
                      can t-just-leave-for-a year-it s-
                      irrational speech from, let s see, 14 
                    different people?  Mom, Dad, Brian--  

                                  ZOEY
                    Brian s not allowed to weigh in.

                                  KAT
                    His argument was he made a mistake, 
                    but I m about to make a bigger one.

                                  ZOEY
                    Naked closet girl isn t a mistake.  
                    It s not like he broke your 
                    favorite mug--

                                    REBECCA
                          (miming the order in the air)
                    Slavery, witch hunts, Brian.

                                  KAT
                    I know.  I hate him.  I do.  I just 
                    don t know if this is the answer.  
                      Everything in me is screaming to 
                    stay here, get another job, forgive 
                    Brian--

                                  ZOEY
                    That girl s hoo-hah touched your 
                    wedding dress, Kat!

                                  KAT
                    I know!

                                  ZOEY
                    Okay, you re making a vow, right 
                    now.  Think of what you would 
                    normally do, then do the opposite.                                                                                    17.


                                  KAT
                    Normally do, then do the opposite.  
                    Okay.  Good.  Done.

                                  X-RAY ATTENDANT
                    Does one of you have liquid 
                      containers over 3 ounces?

      Kat freezes, like she s sincerely guilty of being a drug mule. 

                                  KAT
                    Me.  I do.  I m sorry.  That s me.  
                    I m so sorry.  You wanna search me?

                                    REBECCA
                          (looks to Zoey)
                    Got a little ground to cover.


      As  Time to Get Away  by LCD Soundsystem plays we see the Sydney 
      Opera House, Uluru, Broken Hill and the Great Barrier Reef...


      Taxi drives the girls up to a postcard perfect resort.  
      Turquoise water.  Hammocks stretched between the palm trees 
      on a white sand beach.  Ahh. 

                                  KAT (V.O.)
                    See.  Emerald City.

                                  ZOEY
                    This is so not what I had in mind.

                                    REBECCA
                    Then I ll probably love it.

                                  KAT
                    Zoey, I just need to squeeze this 
                    honeymoon suite for all it s worth 
                    then I promise, we ll go into full 
                    roughing it mode.  Yes?  


      The girls stand silhouetted against a raging fire.    

                                    REBECCA
                    Heaven?  I thought fire went with 
                    the other place.                                                                                    21.


      The owner, OWISO, a magnetic and striking Australian-Aboriginal 
      man in his 30's, walks up, all smiles.  When you think 
          Australian-Aboriginal, think modern Native-American: street 
      clothes, normal Australian accent, etc. 

                                  OWISO
                    Hello!  Welcome to Baganu Sugar 
                    Cane Farm.  I m Owiso.  Aren't you 
                    girls lucky to be here during a 
                    real burn-off?!

      Off the girls... they sure are...


      Pitch dark.  Rebecca climbs into the outhouse trying not to 
      touch anything.  Pulls down her shorts and hovers...   

      Then, a noise outside.  Shorts go up and she freezes. 

      Moment of quiet, then more noise.  Sounds of someone stepping 
      on dry brush.  Rebecca's eyes dart around for a weapon.  
      Grabs a shovel.  Counts to herself, one, two...  Then leaps 
      out, shovel raised like an axe.  Owiso throws up his arms. 

                                    REBECCA
                    What the hell are you doing?

                                  OWISO
                    I came to tell you that the 
                    outhouse is for the farm workers.  
                    You re welcome to use it but 
                    there s a regular bathroom down the 
                    hall from your room.  

                                    REBECCA
                    You came to tell me this at three 
                    in the morning?  

                                  OWISO
                    I was checking on the fire.
                          (smiles, amused)
                    You going to put down the shovel?

      She finally lowers it.  Looks around for a place to set it.  
      Owiso takes a step toward her, holds out his hand.  He takes 
      the shovel, brushing her hand.  Rebecca flinches.  He 
      chuckles to himself as she hurries off.                                                                                     23.


                                  OWISO (CONT D)
                    Good night.


      CLOSE ON KAT.  Sleeping blissfully.  She giggles as if being 
      tickled.  PULL BACK to see a few fat roaches nesting in her hair.  

                                    REBECCA
                    What re you giggling about?
                          (flopping over)
                    You having a dirty dream-- Ahh!

      Rebecca jumps outta bed.  Zoey and Kat's eyes fly open.

                        KATZOEY
      What?  What is it?What s happening?!

                                    REBECCA (CONT D)
                    Roaches!  

                                  KAT
                    Where?!

                                  ZOEY
                    In your hair!

      Kat screams, shaking her hair out.  The roaches scatter.

                                    REBECCA
                    Guess we found the charming little 
                    animals.


      Zoey and Kat are sitting at a picnic table full of breakfast 
      food.  Owiso s pouring juice.  Rebecca walks out.

                                  OWISO
                    Yes, I apologize for that.  Insects 
                    come inside because of the fire.

                                    REBECCA (ON PHONE)
                    And someone will call me the minute 
                    it gets in?  Thank you...
                          (hangs up)
                    I hate people.  Especially when 
                    they take my luggage.

                                  KAT
                    Still no backpack?

                                  OWISO
                    Good morning.                                                                                    24.


      Rebecca just nods.  

                                  ZOEY
                    Sit down and have some brekkie.  
                    It s so authentic -- look, vegemite!  

                                  KAT
                          (pointing to fried eggs)
                    These yellow and white things are 
                    good.

                                  OWISO
                    If you ve lost your luggage, I can 
                    possibly help.

                                    REBECCA
                    I didn t lose it.  The airline did.  
                    But no.  Thanks.  I ve got it.

                                  OWISO
                    Are you sure?  I can--

                                    REBECCA
                    I said, I ve got it.

      Owiso nods, smiles, walks away.

                    He was just trying to be nice.

                                    REBECCA
                    I don t trust nice.

      Zoey lightens the moment, looking out at the view.

                                  ZOEY
                    You guys, we are here.  Look.

      Without the fire, you can finally see the place.  And it s 
        spectacular.  The grounds are tropical and lush.  But it s 
      the sky that s epic.  Cobalt blue streaked with white.  

                                  KAT
                      Amazing... So let s go see it.
                          (opens a guidebook)
                    There s a tour that goes from 
                    Cairns to Port Douglas, maybe--

                                  ZOEY
                    No.  No guidebooks.  We already 
                    decided how we re gonna do this.  In 
                    the bar, remember?  The dream list.

                                  ZOEY (CONT'D)
                    Now I already wrote down the cherry 
                    blossom trees and the tomato chucking 
                    but we need something for Australia.  
                    So... what are your dreams?

                                  KAT
                    Oh.  Well.  Lemme think...  

                                  ZOEY
                    Rebecca?

                                    REBECCA
                    Um... 

                                  ZOEY
                    Here, I ll give you one of mine...  
                    there s a group called the 
                      Thankakali Aboriginal Corporation. 
                    They teach art and stuff to kids 
                    who ve been part of the justice 
                    system.  I called them before I 
                    left, they said I could maybe teach 
                    a music class.  When I was a kid, I 
                    had support.  I want to give some 
                    to kids who don t.  Now, you.  

                                    REBECCA
                    Wow.  Well, I hear that the bar 
                    bathrooms here are tiled all the way 
                    to the ceiling in case people barf.  
                    I d like to see if that s true.

                                  ZOEY
                          (hurt)
                    Look, this trip is very important to 
                    me.  You guys are basically crashing 
                    my party, so I d appreciate it if 
                    you didn t mock me.   

      Zoey gets up to go, Rebecca stops her.

                                    REBECCA
                    Wait, Zoey, I m sorry.  I m not 
                    trying to make fun of you.  You ve 
                    just had a lot more time to think 
                    about it than we have.  And, I 
                    don t know, I ve never thought of 
                    what my dreams would be... outside 
                    of dominating the Manhattan 
                    financial district, of course.  So 
                    just... gimme a little time.

                                  ZOEY
                    Okay.                                                                                    26.


                                  KAT
                    Ya know, Brian and I were going to 
                    take this big scuba diving adventure.  
                    I was terrified but I spent three 
                    weeks in a pool getting certified, 
                    might as well put it to use.

                                    REBECCA
                    But was that Brian s dream or yours?

                                  KAT
                    Mine?  Sort of.
                          (off the girls, unconvinced)
                    I mean, I m not that scared.  
                    Really.  I wanna go.  I like fish.


      Sun bounces off the azure water as a dive boat rips through 
      it.  Rebecca s driving, Zoey's upfront in the spray and Kat 
      (wearing her NY ballcap again) is green.

                                  KAT
                    So much water.

                                  ZOEY
                          (pleasant)
                    It s not the water you should worry 
                    about -- it s what s in it.  You 
                    know how many things are in there 
                    that can kill you?  Sharks, 
                    saltwater crocodiles, box jellyfish, 
                    cone shells, blue ring octopus...
                          (waves at Rebecca to stop)
                    Okay, this is good.  Let s get in!


      Magical.  Surreal.   Beautiful Day  by U2 plays as the girls 
      swim in a kaleidoscope of coral and fish.    

      Until Kat taps Rebecca... spells out Z-O-E-Y with her finger 
      then shrugs?  Rebecca looks around and shrugs back.  Where is 
      she?  They swim around, searching the water.  Panic rising...

      Finally Kat spots her in the far distance.  She grabs Rebecca 
      and points.  They swim toward Zoey but Zoey swims further 
      out.  They wave their arms.  Doesn t she see them?   

      Kat and Rebecca give it a serious push and finally catch up 
      with Zoey.  Kat points at her oxygen gauge.  Zoey shakes her 
      head starts to swim away again.  This time, Rebecca grabs 
      Zoey's arm, points adamantly back the way they came and 
      starts towing her along--                                                                                       27.



      The girls come up for air.  Kat s more scared than angry.

                                  KAT
                    What s wrong with you?!  Where d 
                    you think you were going?

                                  ZOEY
                    Just swimming.

                                  KAT
                    What s the first rule I told you?  
                    Buddy system.  Stay close to each 
                    other.  We only have an hour tank-- 

                                    REBECCA
                    Hang on, where s the boat?

                                  KAT
                          (spinning around)
                    What?  It s right--  Where is it? 

                                  ZOEY
                    We didn t go that far.  Did we?

                                  KAT
                          (panicking)
                    No, I was paying attention.  This is 
                    where we left it.  I think... Oh God, 
                    Oh no.  Oh no--  

                                    REBECCA
                    Alright, calm down.  It s gotta be 
                    close by.

                                  KAT
                    No, no, no.  It s gone.  This is 
                    like Open Water only worse.

                                  ZOEY
                    How s it worse?

                                  KAT
                    Because it s happening to us.

      Off Kat, Rebecca and Zoey terrified and floating in the 
      middle of the great blue. 


                                  END OF ACT TWO                                                                                    28.


                                      ACT THREE


      The girls tread water.  Exhausted.  Faces sunburnt.  

                                  KAT
                    This was Brian s dream.  What was I 
                    thinking?  I was trying to be 
                    brave.  But I m so not brave.  I m 
                    terrified we re gonna die out here 
                    and it s gonna be my fault.

                                  ZOEY
                    We re not gonna die.

                                  KAT
                    How do you know?

                                  ZOEY
                    Because we ve got a year of 
                    adventure left.  We can t die the 
                    first week.

                                    REBECCA
                    Solid reasoning.  I m swimming for 
                    shore.

                                  KAT
                    Not a good idea.  Land can look 
                    close, but water plays tricks on 
                    you.  And swimming actually speeds 
                    up hypothermia... and death.  

                                    REBECCA
                    So do sharks, blue-winged octopuses 
                    and all their other scary friends.

                                  KAT
                      Blue-ring.

                                    REBECCA
                    What?

                                  KAT
                    It s not blue-winged, it s blue ring.  
                    Isn t that what you said, Zo?

      Zoey nods.

                                    REBECCA
                    I m going to kill you, Zoey.                                                                                     29.


                                  ZOEY
                    What d I do?

                                    REBECCA
                    If we didn t have to chase you for 
                    five miles, we might ve seen the 
                    boat drift away.

                                  ZOEY
                    It s not my fault it drifted in the 
                    first place.  I wasn t in charge of 
                    dropping the anchor.

                                  KAT
                    I did exactly what the rent-a-boat 
                    guy told me to.  Maybe it broke.

                                    REBECCA
                    Maybe somebody came by and stole 
                    it.  This continent was populated 
                    by criminals.

                                  KAT
                    What s that?

                    What s what?  

                                  KAT
                    That noise...  It s a boat.  Over 
                    there!  Wave your arms!

      They all wave and yell like maniacs.  The boat heads over.  A 
      tan and lean Aussie, MAX (30ish), down under s answer to 
      Matthew McConaughey, waves back and yells:

                                  MAX
                    Ahoy!


      A perfect, remote beach.  Fifteen or so tents and a big 
      campfire.  Shiny, happy people playing in the surf, tossing a 
      frisbee about... or some other sport that requires you to run 
      in the sand and look carefree...

       The Kids Don t Stand a Chance  by Vampire Weekend plays as 
      the three girls (in bikinis now, wet suits in hand) approach.

                                  KAT
                    So... what do we do now?

                                  MAX
                    Nothing.

      And for the first time, we see smiles on all the girls  faces.


      Sunset.  Everyone s milling about, getting dinner ready.   
      Kat' sitting on the sand, watching the waves.  Max sits.  
      Hands her a bottle.

                                  MAX
                    Hey.  Brought you some Supercat.
                    It s like moonshine.  You ll love 
                    it.

                                  KAT
                    Thanks... I think
                          (swigs, winces)
                    I don t know why I expect the sun 
                    to set over the water down here.

                                  MAX
                    I know.  Toilets flush the wrong 
                    way but the sun still sets in the 
                    West.  We don t make sense down 
                    here.
                          (looks out at the water)
                    Just wait til morning.  The sunrise 
                    is amazing.

                      I graduated law school last year.  
                    Was working at my Da s firm.  One 
                    morning I looked at his face across 
                    the desk.  There was no happiness 
                    in it.  And it occurred to me that 
                      I couldn t remember him being happy 
                    one day in his life.

      Rebecca's getting way too into spear fishing.  She's got a 
      huge bucket-o-fish and she's still stabbing.  Zoey approaches.

      Rebecca stabs another fish.


      Big ol' bonfire.  It's like a weenie roast only with fish...

      it starts to pour rain.  The group heads for the biggest 
      tent.  Everyone's laughing.  Kat swoons.  Max steadies her.

      butted down the beach.  Kat pulls on some clothes, joins 
      Rebecca and the others.

      in the moonlight.  She suddenly cuts toward the waves.

      Zoey grins.  Loving the game.  Suddenly she leaps into the 
      water, screaming with delight.  A few people laugh with her.

      But then, she lets out a short scream.  A few laugh, assuming 
      she s kidding.  But the screaming doesn t stop.  Everyone 
      sprints down the beach, leaps into the surf and drags Zoey 
      onto the beach.

      Zoey winces in pain.  Kat takes off running--


      Kat tosses the bag to Max.  He pours vinegar on Zoey s leg, 
      yanks on a glove then sprays the site with shaving cream.                                                                                    40.

                    This is crazy... Kat?  

                                  KAT
                    I don t know.  It doesn t make 
                    sense.  If my hat washed up here, 
                    why wouldn t the boat?  

                                    REBECCA
                    Come on, let s go.  We gotta get 
                    Zoey to a hospital.  

                                  MAX
                    Kat.  You have to believe me--

                                  KAT
                    I want to but--  

                                    REBECCA
                          (taking Kat by the arm)
                    Let s go.

                                  MAX
                    Kat?

      Kat glances back once, beyond confused... betrayed...  Max 
      throws his hands up, stunned.  Watches them walk away.

                                        ACT FOUR


      Middle of nowhere.  Sun's blazing.  Kat and Rebecca support 
      Zoey's weight between them as they walk.  Kat and Zoey have 
      swim fins on.    

                                  KAT
                    The ground s so hot I can feel it 
                    through these things.

                                  ZOEY
                    Well, these fins weren t made for 
                    walkin .  

                                    REBECCA
                    Wanna borrow what s-his-name s flip 
                    flops?  It was the least I could 
                    steal.

      Kat shakes her head.  Zoey winces.

                                  KAT
                    You okay, honey?

                                  ZOEY
                    Yeah, I m fine.

      They continue schlepping.  Zoey glances at an unhappy Kat.

                                  ZOEY (CONT D)
                    How  bout you?

                                  KAT
                    I just don t understand it.  I 
                    follow my head, and things go 
                    wrong.  So I follow my gut, and 
                    things still go wrong. 

                                    REBECCA
                     Gut  isn t really the word for 
                    what you followed.

                                  KAT
                    I know.  I was perhaps too easily 
                    charmed by the Australian accent.  
                    I was like a cobra with that crazy 
                    flute.

                                  ZOEY
                    Well, I say, good girl.  You had 
                    fun, didn t you?                                                                                    43.


                                  KAT
                    I kinda did.
                          (sighs)
                    But still, is there anybody out 
                    there I can trust anymore?

                                    REBECCA
                    Yeah.  Us.

      They look at each other... grateful.  Not an ounce of 
      toughness on Rebecca's face -- a rare, but beautiful thing.  
      Then finally, in the distance, they see a pick-up truck 
      approach.  They wave their arms to flag it down...


      The pick-up drops the girls off.  Owiso jogs out to meet them 
      like a worried parent.

                                  OWISO
                    Where were you?  I was so worried 
                    when you didn t come home last night.  

                                    REBECCA
                    Are we grounded?

                                  KAT
                    We went diving, but then we kinda 
                    lost our boat, or rather -- it was 
                    stolen--  

                                  ZOEY
                    --then we hung out with the guys 
                    who stole it--  

                                  KAT
                    --anyway, long story.  Right now we 
                    should get Zoey to a hospital -- 
                    she was stung by a jellyfish.

      Owiso bends down to check Zoey's leg.

                                  ZOEY
                    No, no, no.  I m fine.  Seriously.

                                    REBECCA
                    Zoey, we should get it checked out 
                    just to be sure.

                                  ZOEY
                    Hospitals make people sicker.  I m 
                    not going.                                                                                    44.


                                  OWISO
                    Don t need a hospital.  I ve got 
                    something better.


      Owiso's talking to some workers when Rebecca walks up.

                                    REBECCA
                    I wanted to thank you for getting my 
                    bag.  You didn t have to do that.

                                  OWISO
                    I know.
                          (off Rebecca, pulling out 
                            cash)
                    I don t want money.

                                    REBECCA
                    Then what do you want?                                                                                    48.


                                  OWISO
                    Nothing.  Can t someone just do 
                    something nice for you?

                                    REBECCA
                    Not usually, no.

      Owiso's phone rings.

                                  OWISO
                    Baganu Farms?... Great.  Thanks.
                          (hangs up, smiles)
                    You re not going to like this -- 
                    more nice things... they found your 
                    boat.


      The girls and a frowning RENT-A-BOAT GUY stand beside the 
      trashed remains of their dive boat.  

                                    RENT-A-BOAT GUY
                    Couple fisherman found it aground 
                    in a rocky inlet.  Windy day 
                      yesterday.  Boat must ve drifted.

                                  KAT
                    But, how?  I dropped the anchor.

                                    RENT-A-BOAT GUY
                    Yeah.  All the way you did.  
                    Must ve hit the release lever.

                                  KAT
                    Oh no.  Then this whole thing is my 
                    fault.

                                  ZOEY
                          (turns, grabs Kat)
                    Wait, Kat.  Who cares.  This means 
                    Max was telling the truth.  We need 
                    to go back.

      Zoey starts to pull Kat back toward their waiting taxi. 

                                    RENT-A-BOAT GUY
                    Hang on then.  Someone needs to pay 
                    for the boat.

                                    REBECCA
                    Right.  How much is it?

                                    RENT-A-BOAT GUY
                    About 20 thousand dollars.                                                                                    49.


                                  KAT
                    God.  How much is that in American 
                    money?

                                    RENT-A-BOAT GUY
                    About 20 thousand dollars.

      Zoey and Kat turn expectantly to Rebecca.

                                    REBECCA
                    Don t look at me.  My money s in my 
                    closet -- and I don t think this 
                    guy wants shoes.  

                                    RENT-A-BOAT GUY
                    You re right.  Cash or I call the 
                    cops.  

                                  ZOEY
                          (sotto)
                    Great.  We get the only prick in 
                      Australia.  What happened to  no 
                    worries, mate? 

                                    REBECCA
                    Gimme your passports.

                                  ZOEY
                    I m not being sold into slavery.

                                    REBECCA
                    Just--
                          (gestures: hand them over)
                    Here.  Hang on to these as 
                      collateral.  We ll be back to 
                    figure it out later, okay?

      Rent-a-boat guy hesitates, then takes the passports and the 
      girls are off--


      The girls stand on an empty beach.  What used to be Tent City 
      in front of them.  All that's left now is a dead campfire.   

                                  KAT
                    I liked him.  I really liked him 
                    and I blew it.
                          (finally breaking)
                    This sucks.  This isn t working.  I 
                    screw up everything.                                                                                    50.


                                    REBECCA
                    Not true.  I did this.  You shouldn t 
                    have listened to me.  I imposed my 
                      judgmental paranoia onto you.

                                  ZOEY
                    She s right.  Stop being so hard on 
                    yourself.  It s not your fault you 
                    got fired; not your fault Brian 
                    cheated on you; and it s not your 
                    fault the boat drifted away--

                                    REBECCA
                    --No, that kinda was--

                                  ZOEY
                    --okay, but most of the time it's 
                    not, so stop doing that.  

                                  KAT
                          (fast)
                    I m just worried that if I don t do 
                    the right thing, I ll let everyone 
                    down.  But then I m worried that 
                    the right thing, isn t what s right 
                    for me.  But I don t think I even 
                    know what s right for me.  I m 
                    worried that... that...

                                  ZOEY
                    Stop worrying.

                                  KAT
                    I m not good at not worrying.

                                    REBECCA
                    Don t say that, think positively.

                                  KAT
                    Okay.  I m good at worrying.

                                  ZOEY
                    Worrying is a waste of imagination.

                                    REBECCA
                    Can I get that in a bumper sticker?  
                    Maybe a t-shirt?

                                  ZOEY
                    It s gonna make you inert, make me 
                    plow into a wall and make Rebecca -- 
                    well, Rebecca likes to pretend she 
                    doesn t worry so we ll keep up the 
                    ruse.                                                                                      51.


                                    REBECCA
                    Not a ruse.  Worry free.

                                  ZOEY
                    Point is, it s holding you back.  
                    Sucky things happen.  It's what you 
                    do about it that matters.

                                  KAT
                          (thinks)
                    Then I know what I m gonna do.  I m 
                    gonna pay for the boat.  

                                    REBECCA
                    But you can t do that and still go 
                    on the trip.

                                  KAT
                    I m not going on the trip.  I m 
                    going home.

                                    REBECCA
                    No, no.  We should all pay.  Maybe 
                    it ll shorten the trip by a few 
                    months but that s okay -- we ll 
                    travel as long as we can.

                                  KAT
                    You just told me not to listen to 
                    you.  I'm going home and that's it.
                          (touches Rebecca's cheek)
                    I think I ll miss you the most, 
                      Scarecrow.  Oh, wait, you re the 
                    Tin Man.

                                    REBECCA
                    Too many movies, honey.

                                  KAT
                    Let s just go.


      And when their taxi drives up, Kat's mouth drops open 
      because...  Brian's standing there.  

                                  KAT (V.O.)
                    All I need is a tornado and a 
                    house.

                                        ACT FIVE


      To find Rebecca and Zoey spying from outside the window.  
      Rebecca and Zoey moan like they just saw a bad ski wipeout.

                                    REBECCA
                    Man down.  Man down!

                                  ZOEY
                    Crap.  Whatta we do?

                                    REBECCA
                    Lemme think... We chop off Brian s 
                    balls, give  em to Kat.  Two birds.  
                    One stone... well, two stones.

                                  ZOEY
                    I m serious.  This is serious.  She s 
                    got that look.  I hate that look.                                                                                    53.


      INSIDE, Brian smooths a piece of stray hair back from Kat's 
      face...

                                  BRIAN
                    I love that look -- that little 
                    lost look.  You re so cute when 
                    you re confused.  

                                  KAT
                          (looks away; fights tears)
                    I just--  I don t know what I m 
                    gonna do when I get home.

                                  BRIAN
                    Be with me.  Where you belong...  
                    Honey, who else is gonna love you 
                    despite all your funny little 
                    neuroses?  Because I do.  Panic 
                    attacks, insomnia... all of it.

      Brian takes Kat's face in her hands...

      OUTSIDE,

                                  ZOEY
                    Is her eye twitching?  If it s 
                      twitching, it s over.  

                                    REBECCA
                    I can t tell.  His ham hands are in 
                    the way.  

                                  ZOEY
                    That s it.  We re intervening.   

                                    REBECCA
                    Yes.  Good.

      Rebecca goes to the door, grabs the knob.  Zoey stops her.

                                  ZOEY
                    Wait.  Give her 20 more seconds.  
                    One, two--

      INSIDE,

                                  BRIAN
                    I m glad you ve realized that this 
                    trip isn t for you.  You need to 
                    come home... with me.  My funny, 
                    lost little Kat...

      Brian s still got her face in his hands.  He leans in to kiss 
      her but Kat suddenly bursts out laughing.                                                                                      54.


                                  BRIAN (CONT D)
                    What?  What s so funny?

                                  KAT
                    I just can t figure it out.

                                  BRIAN
                          (can t help but laugh too)
                    Figure what out?

                                  KAT
                    What I ever saw in you.

      Brian stops laughing.

                                  KAT (CONT D)
                    You think this trip isn t for me 
                    because I m weak, right?  Wishy-
                    washy, safe, nice, little me.  Know 
                    what?  Not anymore.  I don t know 
                    exactly what I want or even who I 
                    am, but I know I don t want to be 
                    with a patronizing asshole.  

      She turns around, zips up her pack. 

                                  KAT (CONT D)
                    I m staying, Brian.  For once, I m 
                    taking a leap of faith.  

      She smiles at him, grabs her pack and heads for the door.  
      With her hand on the knob, she turns back around.

                                  KAT (CONT D)
                    And speaking of insomnia?  I just 
                    realized I ve slept better in this 
                    crazy place with roaches in my hair 
                    than I ever did in your arms.

      As she turns the knob.  Rebecca and Zoey burst in, act casual.

                                    REBECCA
                    Hello.  Hi.

                                  ZOEY
                    What s up?

                                  KAT
                    I finally thought of something for 
                    the dream list.


      Owiso helps the girls load their stuff into a taxi.                                                                                      55.


      Zoey stands off to the side and pulls out her iPhone.  Taps 
      Skype.  Taps Elan s name.  His groggy face appears.

                                  ELAN (ON PHONE)
                    Hi.  Hi.

                                  ZOEY
                    I m so sorry, did I wake you up?

                                  ELAN (ON PHONE)
                    Yeah... but no, it s okay.  I m 
                    just happy you called.  I wasn t 
                    sure you were going to... but, I m 
                    just really glad you did...

      Rebecca shakes Owiso s hand.

                                  OWISO
                    Goodbye, Rebecca.  Maybe we can 
                    keep in touch.

                                    REBECCA
                    Keep in touch?  What s with you?  
                    We didn t even sleep together.

                                  OWISO
                          (chuckles)
                    I just like you.  You re very... 
                    spirited.

                                    REBECCA
                    That s what they call kids who have 
                    to wear helmets to school.

                                  OWISO
                    And funny.  So, can I get your email?

                                    REBECCA
                          (hesitates, then)
                    I m not really the pen-paling type.  
                    Sorry.

      She gets in the taxi.  The other girls hug Owiso goodbye...

                                  KAT (V.O.)
                    In real life, the yellow brick road 
                    doesn t end at Emerald City.  You 
                    don t just change or figure things 
                    all out overnight...  


      The taxi rumbles away then suddenly stops.  Rebecca jumps 
      out, runs back and hands a small piece of paper to Owiso.                                                                                      56.


                                  KAT (V.O.)
                    But you can get closer..

      As she runs back to the taxi, he unfolds it and smiles.  It's 
      her email address.        

                                  KAT (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    With every risk you take.

      And as the taxi disappears in the distance, see another car 
      pull out from a side street and start to follow it...


      The two men from Rebecca s apartment stride through the 
      terminal.

                                  TALL GUY (ON PHONE)
                    Good.  Keep her in sight.  We re 
                    getting on a plane now.

      TIGHT ON: KAT'S ENGAGEMENT RING 

      ...as she pulls it off her finger and hands it to the rent-a-
      boat guy...

                                  KAT (V.O.)
                    That s not to say things will turn 
                    out perfectly...

      TIGHT ON: KAT'S LAPTOP

      ...as she types in the back of the taxi... the first entry of 
      her travelogue...  

                                  KAT (V.O.)
                    And I m still terrified.  But since 
                    I can fall on my face in my dorm 
                    room, I might as well get out there 
                    and play some beer pong.   

      Then the taxi rolls to a stop.  They're here.                                                                                    57.


      TIGHT ON: THREE PAIRS OF HIKING BOOTS 

      ...as the girls jump out of a jeep and onto the dusty red 
      clay.

                                  KAT (V.O.)
                    Because I have a feeling... 


      ...Zoey holds up the photo of her mom.  Nope.  Not this time.  
      But that s okay... one down...  

      And then, we're back at the beginning.  Watching the girls 
      hike the banks of that steep waterfall. 

                                  KAT (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    The only leaps of faith I m ever 
                    going to regret...

      They reach the top, hold hands and jump...  

                                  KAT (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    ...are the ones I didn t take.

      Cue Ida Maria s  Oh My God  as, this time, we watch them 
      plunge into the dark pool below - a flurry of white froth 
      boiling up in their wake.  And then, for a moment, it's 
      still...  

      Until suddenly they burst back through the glassy water, and 
      as they each take a huge gulp of air, we: 

                                                                  SMASH TO BLACK.
