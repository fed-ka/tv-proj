Out west where the sun descends gloriously over desolate
mountains. A sense of timeless and incorruptible beauty
if you ignore the TWANG of the MUSIC, the SPUTTER of the
TRACTOR, the ZAPS, the THWACKS... and something else...
... MEN'S VOICES.
Garrulous with drink, fraternity and
amusement.
We PAN DOWN TO:

A man, JOSE, is on the roof, wrestling with a rickety
satellite dish, stringing wire, trying to get it to work.
(We get glimpses of him throughout the scene as he
struggles with what is assuredly a pirate operation.)
Four of six floodlights nailed to the roof cast pools of
yellow into the gathering darkness. ROY "TIN CUP" McAVOY
stands under the swarm of moths crowding the brightest
light, hitting golf balls. THWOCK...! Launching them,
really, into the deepening night. There's a beer between
his legs. Behind him:
A group of men forms a semicircle, facing away from Tin
Cup. These men are the range regulars: CURT, CLINT,
EARL, and DEWEY. Each man has money in one hand and his
preferred libation in the other. They're all looking
back and forth between the bug lights hung on the back
wall, and muttering what sounds like bets to:
ROMEO POSAR -- a smaller man, he stands at the center of
the group with a handful of cash. Romeo is a part-time
bookie and full-time driving range man. Born across the
river in Mexico, Romeo is Tin Cup's caddie, confidante,
best friend.
ROMEO
Okay, all bets are down!
Their eyes rivet on the bug lights, edgy, hopeful,
until... ZAP! A BUG is ELECTROCUTED. And Dewey cheers
triumphantly while the other regulars mutter curses about
how they woulda, coulda, shoulda bet.
2.
ROMEO
Number one is the winner! Dewey
has the winner. Pays five to two!
Romeo quickly pays Dewey and more quickly takes money from
the losers. It's fast-paced, inane, time-killing
gambling. Tin Cup looks over.
TIN CUP
Don't you shitheels ever get
bored?
The regulars flap dismissive palms and mutter in the
negative as they turn back to Romeo and the action at the
bug lights.
TIN CUP
... 'Cuz I got a riddle.
Tin Cup leads the regulars inside.
CUT TO:

The lesson begins. Tin Cup can be slightly condescending
in these situations, though she's got him a little wary.
TIN CUP
The first thing you gotta learn
about this game, Doc, is it ain't
about hitting a little white ball
into some yonder hole. It's about
inner demons and self-doubt and
human frailty and overcoming all
that crap. So... what kinda
doctor'd you say you were?
MOLLY
I'm a psychologist -- in layman's
terms call me a neo-Jungian, post-
modern Freudian, holistic
secularist.
TIN CUP
Damn.
She begins unpacking one of her bags, pulling out every
golf gimmick on the market -- swing aid straps to pull
your elbows together, a ball pendulum that hangs from
your hat, a metal contraption for your feet, etc.
MOLLY
Inner demons and human frailty are
my life's work. I used to
practice in El Paso but I've moved
here now...
TIN CUP
What're those?
MOLLY
I ordered these from the Golf
Channel.
6.
He stares in disbelief as she tries to wriggle into some
of this stuff. He's enchanted and dismayed.
TIN CUP
That stuff's a waste of money.
MOLLY
I'm sure there are excesses and
repetitions here, but I believe in
the gathering of knowledge and I
figured, well, there must be some
truths about the golf swing
illustrated by these devices --
and that you'd help me sort
through it.
She stands there with contraptions coming from every
limb.
MOLLY
I have dozens of golf videotapes,
too... And a golf watch.
TIN CUP
(irritated, impatient)
Take it off. All of it. Now!
You're a smart woman, for
Chrissakes -- don't you know the
work of charlatans when you see
it?
She deposits all the golf gimmick devices in a pile.
MOLLY
No. I can always tell when
someone is lying to himself, but
I'm quite susceptible and
frequently wrong when that person
lies to me.
(pointing to the
pile of devices)
That stuff cost me over 200
dollars --
TIN CUP
Then it's 200 dollars of shit...
He tees a ball, hands Molly her driver and steps back.
TIN CUP
Go ahead.
Take a swing.
Molly takes a pitty-pat swing and whiffs, and mutters
under her breath with the ease of a longshoreman.
7.
MOLLY
Aw, fuck...
TIN CUP
Well, you talk like a golfer --
Molly unloads a mighty second swing. The club head
bounces off the mat. The ball sits untouched.
MOLLY
Shit.
TIN CUP
'Fuck...' 'Shit...' these are
highly technical golf terms and
you're using them on your first
lesson -- this is promising.
MOLLY
Awright, wise ass, show me.
Tin Cup takes the club from Molly, motions for her to
step back, tees up a ball, and rockets a drive into the
night.
TIN CUP
Something like that.
He hands her back the club and tees up another ball.
Molly just looks at him.
MOLLY
Impressive. Y'know, I tend to
process things verbally. Can you
break down into words how you did
that?
Tin Cup takes a deep breath -- this is his speech.
TIN CUP
'What is the golf swing?' -- by
Roy McAvoy.
(beat)
The golf swing is a poem.
TIN CUP (CONT'D)
Sometimes a love sonnet and
sometimes a Homerian epic -- it is
organic and of a piece, yet it
breaks down into elegant stanzas
and quatrains. The critical
opening phrase of this song is the
grip, in which the hands unite to
form a single unit by the simple
overlap of the smallest finger...
(displays grip)
... held lightly, a conductor's
8.
baton.
(starts swing)
Lowly and slowly the clubhead is
pulled back, led into position
not by the hands but the body
which turns away from the target,
shifting to the right side without
shifting balance. Tempo is
everything, perfection unobtainable,
as the body coils, now to the top
of the swing, in profound equilibrium.
And then a slight hesitation, a nod
to the gods...
MOLLY
A nod to the gods?
TIN CUP
To the gods, yes... that he is
fallible. As the weight shifts
back to the left pulled now by
powers inside the earth -- it's
alive, this swing, a living
sculpture -- and down through
contact, always down, into terra
firma, striking the ball crisply
-- with character -- a tuning
fork goes off in your heart, your
balls -- such a pure feeling is
the well-struck golf shot -- And
then the follow through to finish,
always on line -- The reverse 'C'
of the Golden Bear, the steelworker's
power and brawn of Carl Sandburg's
Arnold Palmer, the da Vinci of
Hogan, the unfinished symphony of
Roy McAvoy.
MOLLY
What?
What's unfinished?
TIN CUP
I have a short follow through --
my swing can look unfinished.
MOLLY
Why?
TIN CUP
Some say it's because that's the
best way to play through the winds
of West Texas... and some say it's
because I never finish anything.
You can decide. The point is every
finishing position is unique as if
that is the signature left to the
artist, the warrior athlete who,
9.
finally and thereby, has asserted
his oneness with and power over the
universe by willing a golf ball to
go where he wants and how and when,
because that is what the golf swing
is about...
(finally)
It is about gaining control of
your life, and letting go at the
same time.
Molly stares back, exhausted and intrigued.
MOLLY
Jeez Louise...
TIN CUP
There is only one other acceptable
theory of how to hit a golf ball.
MOLLY
I'm afraid to ask. What's the
other theory?
TIN CUP
Grip it and rip it.
MOLLY
While I appreciate your poetic
sensibility, Mr. McAvoy --
TIN CUP
Call me Roy, Molly...
MOLLY
Call me Dr. Griswold...
MOLLY (CONT'D)
Roy... but at this point I think
I'm more of the 'grip it and rip
it' school. Hand me the driver.
Tin Cup does.
She tees it up.
TIN CUP
Waggle it, Doc, don't forget to
waggle.
(as she stares at
him)
Waggle... the club head...
(shows her)
... it's a little relaxing
ritual...
She waggles the club head, then takes the club back.
10.
TIN CUP
Let the Big Dog eat!
She stops, lets the club fall.
MOLLY
What Big Dog?
TIN CUP
The driver, the number one wood --
MOLLY
It's metal.
TIN CUP
Yeah, woods are metal -- don't
worry about it -- and the driver's
known as the Big Dog and I'm just
saying to turn him loose, let 'er
rip, let the Big Dog eat!
MOLLY
Oh.
She swings.
Tops the ball.
It goes ten feet.
MOLLY
This is, without a doubt, the
stupidest, silliest, most idiotic
grotesquery masquerading as a game
that has ever been invented.
TIN CUP
(cheerfully)
Yes, ma'am, that's why I love it.
(beat)
And if you hit one good shot -- if
that tuning fork rings in your
loin -- you can't wait to get
back.
She cracks one dead solid perfect out into the night.
It
felt great and she knows it.
MOLLY
I think the Big Dog ate something.
TIN CUP
Did the tuning fork ring in your
loin?
MOLLY
I wouldn't go that far.
TIN CUP
Always quit on a good shot. We'll
call that lesson number one...
11.
(confidentially)
... and if ya wouldn't mind paying
me in cash -- there's a little
I.R.S. situation I'm dealing with
--
MOLLY
If you're such a legendary striker
of the golf ball as everyone says,
then why are you, at your age, out
here in the middle of nowhere
operating a barely solvent
establishment, ducking the I.R.S.,
collecting a few pathetic dollars
to buy your next sixpack -- when
you're capable of so much more?
Her speech is delivered without judgement or rancor, so
matter of factly that he's disarmed.
TIN CUP
Perhaps I'm chocked full of inner
demons?
MOLLY
No, you're chocked full of
bullshit --
(cheerily)
Same time next week?
She heads off to the parking lot.
He stares.
TIN CUP
What did you mean I should try
'being saddled' sometime?
TIN CUP (CONT'D)
Were you being literal or was that
some kind of Freudian type deal?
Molly? Doctor?
(beat)
What kind of saddle?
CLOSE ON MOLLY
As she walks into the West Texas night.
She smiles,
enjoying Tin Cup's confusion.
Tin Cup just stares into the night, holding his cash, until
JOSE'S VOICE ECHOES down from the roof.
JOSE

Tin Cup and Romeo head toward the entrance.
ROMEO
We lost everything, boss! We owe
Doreen twelve thousand bucks!
TIN CUP
I think I been dating too many
big-haired blondes.
ROMEO
Them big-haired blondes are a lot
smarter 'n us...
(beat)
... how we gonna pay her?
TIN CUP
You underestimate me, Romes.
Romeo doesn't realize the truth in his own response.
ROMEO
It's a bad habit I picked up
from knowing you so long.
TURK (THE BOUNCER)
Hey, Tin Cup, Doreen's looking for

TIN CUP
I'm sure she is...
They enter the strip joint.

Romeo and Simms under the awning.
A spiffy new car
parked nearby.
DAVID SIMMS, 38, looking every bit like the successful
tour pro he is... Payne Stewart to Tin Cup's Maynard G.
Krebs.
SIMMS
Romeo! It's been awhile.
Is
Tin Cup around?
Romeo is evasive.
ROMEO
He's on business in Houston... You
supposed to be out playin' on the
golf tour.
19.
SIMMS
(unfazed)
Well, you tell him I'm in town for
my big charity best-ball
tournament, and I got a spot for
him when he comes back from...
whatever.
ROMEO
You got a spot for Tin Cup?
I
thought you hated him.
SIMMS
Romeo! You wound me. I'm fond
of the guy, going way back to our
days at University of Houston,
when we won all those titles
together.
ROMEO
He says he carried you on his
back.
Simms won't be drawn into this adolescent competition --
he's too comfortable with himself and his success.
SIMMS
I didn't have much craft back
then -- just a little native
ability. Roy's a great ball-
striker....
ROMEO
Why you here?
SIMMS
I want to win my own tournament,
and he can help me if we can
manage to behave like grownups
together. Tell him that.
Tin Cup suddenly appears in the doorway.
TIN CUP
What's the catch?
SIMMS
There is no catch. I put together
a tournament with an elite field
and a half-million dollar purse,
and I'm tired of seeing all the
money head out of town.
TIN CUP
Then make more birdies.
20.
SIMMS
I need you on my team.
TIN CUP
You ain't that friendly a guy...
SIMMS
We're playing Cottonwood where you
once shot fifty-nine, where you
can shoot sixty-five in your sleep
'cuz you know every bump on every
fairway, every subtle break on
every green --
TIN CUP
(warily)
You an' me --
SIMMS
Me an' you -- like the old days.
Tin Cup can't quite believe this offer from his old
nemesis but there aren't many options out there. He
grabs Simms's hand and starts pumping it, gushing
with enthusiasm.
TIN CUP
... Well, put 'er there, partner!
These two homeboys are gonna show
the world what golf in West Texas
is all about!
SIMMS
No, Roy. I didn't mean I want you
to play with me. I just want you
to caddie for me, read my putts,
club me, that kinda stuff.
Tin Cup wilts like a time-lapsing daisy.
His hand falls
free of Simms's. Words fail him.
ROMEO
You son of a bitch.
TIN CUP
(to himself, blankly)
Caddie? Me?
SIMMS
I can't bring a guy in off the
street to play in my tournament.
It's a big-time event, corporate
sponsors, thirty dollar tickets...
I got a network to cover --
ROMEO
(interrupting,
21.
outraged)
This guy off the street, he could
kick your ass on that golf course.
Like he kicked your ass in junior
golf. Like he kicked your ass in
college. Like --
SIMMS
I'll pay you a hundred for the
loop, five percent of any
earnings --
ROMEO
Get the hell outta here! Take
your goddamn color coordinated
corporate sponsored soul and get
outta here.
SIMMS
Okay, okay, just thought I'd offer
you some work...
Simms heads to his car.
TIN CUP
Simms!
SIMMS
(stops)
What?
TIN CUP
I'll take the job.
ROMEO
We'll take the job.
Simms nods in agreement, and exits.
Tin Cup stands there
with Romeo, feeling humiliated.

A leader board reads:
SIMMS/STADLER -10, MICKELSON/
MCCORD -8.
A giant gallery lines the fairway and rings the distant
green which is fronted by a lake, as:
STADLER hits a three wood toward the green -- the BALL
PLUNKS in the middle of the lake. The GALLERY GROANS.
Stadler just shrugs to Simms, as if to say, "I thought I
had enough club."
SIMMS
Like I told you, it was more'n
you had in the bag.
STADLER
Yeah, well... I had to go for it
after your caddy said he could
get home from here.
Simms swivels his head around to look at Tin Cup.
TIN CUP
I could.
Simms looks away, at the shot he's facing: a two hundred
fifteen yard carry over water. He looks back at Tin Cup,
shaking his head.
SIMMS
I gotta hand it to you, Roy. For
fifteen holes you've seemed to
grasp the concept here: I'm
trying to win and your job is to
help me.
23.
TIN CUP
Five percent of your earnings does
numb the gag reflex.
SIMMS
Give me the seven iron.
I'm
laying up.
TIN CUP
You can make that shot.
SIMMS
The smart play's to lay up.
TIN CUP
These fans didn't pay thirty bucks
to watch a tour star lay up on a
short par five.
SIMMS
I'm sitting on a two shot lead
with three to go, and my partner's
in his pocket. Suddenly, par's a
good number. Gimme the seven
Iron.
TIN CUP
No way. You're going for the
green. These fans paid good money
to see golf shots they can't hit,
not golf shots they feel shitty
about themselves for having to
hit.
Simms reaches for the seven iron.
Tin Cup clamps a hand
over the club.
TIN CUP
Thirteen years on tour and you're
still a pussy. Hit the fucking
one iron, Dave.
SIMMS
Thirteen years in a driving range
and you still think this game's
about your testosterone count.
Simms removes Tin Cup's hand from the seven iron and
grabs the club, stepping up to address the ball. Tin Cup
mutters to the gallery.
TIN CUP
Two-fifteen to carry, and the tour
star's laying up.
And the remark summons gallery voices suddenly urging
Simms to go for the green. Simms motions for Tin Cup, as
24.
if reconsidering.
SIMMS
But if you're gonna editorialize,
do it on the other side of the
ropes. I got no qualms about
firing your ass right here, right
now.
TIN CUP
Fire me?
Hell, I should fire you.
Simms steps back to his ball with the seven iron, and:
16
Stadler's still standing back where he hit the shot into
16
the lake. MICKELSON and GARY McCORD, the other team in
the pairing, are there with him. Romeo, Stadler's caddie,
stands just behind them.
McCORD
(to Mickelson)
I know you could knock it on from
here, I'm just saying that caddie's
been drinking muddy water if he
thinks he can.
ROMEO
He can.
All the players look at Romeo as:
Simms dumps his seven iron shot safely down in front of
the water to a smattering of polite applause.
Simms tosses the club back to his bag as Tin Cup
retrieves the divot. And:
STADLER
Hey, Dave!
We in a hurry?
Simms looks several yards back where Stadler is still
standing with McCord and Mickelson.
STADLER
'Cause I just bet McCord and
Mickelson that your caddie could
knock it on from here.
SIMMS
We're trying to win a tournament,
pardo.
STADLER
I know.
But I'm getting five to

The ANNOUNCER from the GOLF CHANNEL looks at the monitor

Stadler, McCord, and Mickelson are smiling at the bet.
This is golf. But Simms snarls at being challenged.
Stadler drops a ball in the rough for Tin Cup to hit.
STADLER
Here ya go.
Take a hack at it.
SIMMS
Balls versus brains, Roy. You
hit that shot, just keep walking,
'cuz your ass is fired.
Tin Cup mulls over the warning, as:
STADLER, McCORD, MICKELSON
Come on, Roy!
Your fans are
calling!
Stadler waves his arms to summon a cheer from the gallery.
Tin Cup puts down Simms's golf bag.
TIN CUP
How you gonna fire me in front of
all these people? Especially when
I knock it on the green.
And he heads over to where Stadler and the others stand
waiting.

It seems like the Charity
Tournament is taking a little

Gary McCord moves toward the camera and takes the
microphone.
McCORD
Peter, I've done a little
background here -- this unfolding
disaster's a driving range pro
named Roy McAvoy, who everyone
calls Tin Cup. Locals claim he
he was a pretty good college lick
and knocked around the mini-tours...

Tin Cup steps up to hit the shot.
McCord lowers his
20
voice.
McCORD
... but I guarantee you, he's
about to suffer brain arrest.
He's thinking about the cameras
and the gallery and the water, and
all that gray matter between his
ears is turning to goo... and
incidentally, Stadler's got it booked
at ten to one...
Tin Cup swings, and:
21
The CAMERA PICKS UP the ball arching high and true off
21
the club. It lands on the green. The CROWD ROARS... and
the roar becomes deafening as the ball rolls three feet
from the pin.

He's not that good... he's
definitely not that good... (etc.)

SIMMS
Take a hike, Roy -- the loop's

TIN CUP
You can't fire me. How can you
fire me? I just knocked it stiff
from two fifty. Gimme that bag.
Tin Cup reaches for the bag. The guy holds onto it.
They wrestle briefly, as Simms sighs with fatigue and
looks for a marshal.
27.
SIMMS
Security!
Tin Cup gives up wrestling when he sees a couple marshals
approaching. He turns his anger on Simms.
TIN CUP
What about my money?
SIMMS
You just hit the shot that took
you out of the money. Welcome to
life on the tour.
Tin Cup goes after the bag again. The guy still hangs
on. The marshals arrive, and begin to wrestle with Tin
Cup. He goes berserk... a WWF battle royal.

Mr. McAvoy, I can appreciate that
you have a fairly laid-back,
relaxed lifestyle -- but I have
hours to keep.
TIN CUP
A former paramour once ascribed my

Molly addresses the shot.
Her stance is rigid, overly

Tin Cup winces.
But she looks terrific.
TIN CUP
Quit trying to wring that club's
neck, Molly. Show it a little
warmth and compassion...
He moves around behind her to reposition her shoulders.
TIN CUP
Remember, this game's about trust
and touch and letting go. So
while I'm subtly enhancing your
technical prospects, why don't you
tell me all about your personal
life...
MOLLY
It's none of your fucking
business, Roy.
Tin Cup's hands move down to square her hips.
He's
discreet and professional.
TIN CUP
Your boyfriend's a golfer --
that's my bet -- and he's why
you're taking this game up.
Hell, I probably even know

The trunk opens. A set of expensive golf clubs is
removed by a wealthy looking guy, BOONE, 40'S. He
turns to face Tin Cup and Romeo who is reaching into
the trunk of Roy's Cadillac.
BOONE
Let me get this straight -- you're
going to play me for four hundred
dollars with those?
Romeo removes an old golf bag from the trunk. It
contains a rake, a hoe, a baseball bat, and assorted
garden tools.
TIN CUP
And I'll give ya two a side... I
got the title to my car as
collateral.

BOONE
I'm not interested in that piece

That's cuz you think of it as

(holds out
a palm)
Louisville Slugger, please.
Boone's a little rattled by Tin Cup's insouciance.
ROMEO
You got Boone shakin' already --
(studying the
approach)
Front left bunker's your best
angle to the pin.
TIN CUP
(calling his shot)
Front left bunker -- plugged lie.
He tosses up the ball and fungoes a lazy fly ball.
CUT TO:
35
35
Boone gazes with malicious delight at Tin Cup's ball,
buried in the front left bunker. He watches Tin Cup take
the hoe from Romeo and move down into the trap.
BOONE
I want to see a legitimate swing.
No scooping.
Tin Cup holds up a hand like a gallery marshal requesting
silence.
TIN CUP
Stand, please.
Gallery, please,
stand.
38.
He addresses the ball, choking down on the hoe,
positioning the blade at an odd angle. He hacks at the
ball with an unorthodox chopping motion. The ball pops
up in the air, lands on the green, releases and rolls up
a foot from the hole.
Boone's jaw drops. Tin Cup hit an impossible shot with
utter ease and facility.
TIN CUP
I'll finish.
Tin Cup trades Romeo the shovel for the rake, takes the
pin out of the hole, and pool cues the putt home. Par.
Boone looks at his own sixty-foot putt and he knows he's
just been had... utterly, embarrassingly, and thoroughly.
Without a word he counts four hundred dollars from his
roll and drops it on the green.
BOONE
Get the hell off my course.
38
38
Tin Cup and Romeo emerge, Romeo carrying T.C.'s sticks.
TIN CUP
Listen, swami, your job is to
teach me patience and humility,
not to advise me on my love life.
ROMEO
No. My job is to get your head
straight so you can qualify for
The Open, much less win it. To
get your head straight you got to
forget about the doctor lady.
They head up the street under a collonade toward Tin
Cup's waiting Caddy.
TIN CUP
Not all my thinking occurs below
the belt. I actually stand for a
few things beside where my next
romantic interlude is coming from.
ROMEO
Then you got no problem telling
the doctor lady you can't teach
her no more till after the Open.
Tin Cup blinks silently a moment, feeling slightly cornered.
39.
TIN CUP
That would make an issue of
something that ain't an issue.
Besides, I'm focused.
Romeo responds with a Spanish curse.
TIN CUP
I mean, this is my quest!
ROMEO
Ahhh... your quest... chingaso...
TIN CUP
This is where I stand up for all
the little guys everywhere who've
had their fill of soulless robots
like David Simms --
ROMEO
He may be a soulless robot but
he's a rich, happy soulless robot
with a beautiful doctor lady
girlfriend who's got you by the
huevos --
(beat)
Besides, how is getting into the
U.S. Open gonna change what she
thinks about you?
TIN CUP
It'll prove to her that I'm not
who she thinks I am.
ROMEO
But you are who she thinks you
are! Look, I don't bet on a
horse with a hard-on.
TIN CUP
Hard-on?! Hard-on?! Hard-on?!
Here, touch me, feel --
(as Tin Cup grabs
himself)
I don't feel nothing! Here!
ROMEO
(embarrassed)
Hey, hey... shit... cool it...
39
Suddenly a convertible passes -- Simms and Molly,
39
laughing, carefree, enjoying each other. The couple in
the car doesn't see Tin Cup grabbing his crotch making
a fool of himself on the sidewalk -- but Tin Cup and
Romeo see them.
40.
The car disappears down the street. Tin Cup cools off,
chilled, really -- and full of chagrin.
TIN CUP
Okay, okay... maybe I got a semi.
CUT TO:
40
A42
Tin Cup's Caddy pulls up and
he gets out, goes to the
front of a store that is now
a health services office.
He looks around warily -- as
if someone might see him
entering such a place -- and
ducks inside.
43.
CUT TO:
B42
43
The lone figure of Tin Cup stands on a tee, arching SEVEN
IRONS -- THWOCK! -- into the night, serenaded by CRICKETS
and the occasional BUG-LIGHT ZAPPING a fly.
Romeo and the regulars stand behind Tin Cup observing
approvingly. Tin Cup mutters something with every swing.
It sounds like he's saying --
TIN CUP
(just before
swinging)
Dollar bills...
Tin Cup hits another shot, totally focused.
TIN CUP
Dollar bills...
49.
ROMEO
How'd it go with the doctor lady,
boss?
TIN CUP
If she was a par three, I'd'a made
a nine.
ROMEO
Stroke and distance, eh?
TIN CUP
(nods, deep in
concentration)
Dollar bills...
Romeo backs off to let the man practice, and Clint asks:
CLINT
What's he saying?
ROMEO
Dollar bills. His divots got to
look like dollar bills. 'Course
Moe Norman hits divots like bacon
strips 'cuz he come over the top,
but that's gettin' too technical
for you.
Clint turns and nods approvingly to the rest of the
regulars.
CLINT
See that, boys? He's hitting
dollar bills. Tightening his
game.
They murmur approval, but Earl catches Clint's eye and
jerks his head at Tin Cup, indicating Clint isn't doing
his job as group spokesman. Clint takes a step forward.
CLINT
Uh, something us shitheels want
you to know, Tin Cup, is uh, well,
we been to see Doreen, and we told
her we'd stage a customer's strike
if she didn't give you time off to
win the Open.
This remark penetrates Tin Cup's concentration.
He turns
with a smile to the regulars.
TIN CUP
You perverts did that for me?
JOSE
We believe in you, man.
50.
EARL
And if you get past the local
qualifier, we gonna sponsor you.
Tin Cup looks at the beaming faces of the regulars and
smiles broadly.
TIN CUP
Thanks, boys -- a man couldn't
have better friends. Now move the
hell back and shut the fuck up.
You're messing up my
concentration.
And with big smiles, they move each other back so as not
to mess up Tin Cup's concentration. And he pulls out
another ball, mutters dollar bills, and hits another
perfect shot.
DISSOLVE TO:

Everyone's gone home except Tin Cup, who keeps drilling
beautiful shots into the Texas night.

A car is parked unnoticed. A figure sits alone, watching
Tin Cup from a distance. Molly.
MOLLY'S POV - SOLITARY FIGURE OF TIN CUP
With his elegant swing,
as graceful as he is crude, a Zen
ritual. Finally, weary
at last, Tin Cup tosses his club
in his bag and drags it
toward his ever-present
Winnebago, which we see
him enter.
CUT TO:

47
Local qualifier. The First Tee of the Local Open
Qualifier. And the voice of the starter.
STARTER (V.O.)
... the next group... Roy McAvoy,
Salome, Texas... who will be
playing with...
The regulars applaud and whistle and shout way too many
"You the man's!" as Tin Cup steps onto the first tee,
followed by his Sancho Panza, Romeo. Tin Cup is feeling
on top of the world, at his cocky best.
ROMEO
How ya feelin', boss?
TIN CUP
I'm feelin' like par's a bad
score, podnuh -- fifty-eight's
within the realm!
ROMEO
Jesus, the doctor lady's here --
POV SHOT - MOLLY
standing not far from the regulars.
TIN CUP
Didn't I tell ya? She's gonna be
your guru partner. You handle my
swing mechanics and she handles my
brain mechanics.
ROMEO
Long as you keep your dick out of
it --
TIN CUP
Me an' the 'big guy' have an
understanding. He's gonna lie low
till I get in the Open -- then...
then...
ROMEO
The Big Dog'll eat?
TIN CUP
The Big Dog'll hunt, that's for
sure...
Tin Cup steps up to the tee, a couple quick limber
54.
swings, and he tees it up.
As he does, Romeo slips over
to Molly.
ROMEO
(softly)
Looks like we partners, Dr. Molly
--
MOLLY
I just have to help him keep his
head on straight --
ROMEO
If you can, you be the first.
MOLLY
He does have the occasional
tendency towards self-destruction
it seems.
ROMEO
It ain't occasional and it ain't
no tendency -- it's a fact of life
that he gonna blow sky high, it's
just a matter of when and how
fast can the pieces be put back
together.
(beat)
Behind that twinkle in his eyes is
nitroglycerin.
Tin Cup waves and motions to his team.
TIN CUP
Quiet in the gallery! A man's
trying to do his job.
And Tin Cup uncoils a mighty drive with an elegant
stroke, fully confident and smooth. The gallery
applauds.
TIN CUP
(generally
announcing)
Got my 'A' game with me today,
folks... you're in for a real
treat!
Molly leans to Romeo just before they all head down the
fairway and confides --
MOLLY
I find him mildly attractive when
he's obnoxious and arrogant like
this --
55.
ROMEO
Good. 'Cause it's his best
side...
And they head down the fairway, a scruffy little gallery
on a so-so course. With a lot at stake...

Tin Cup's in a zone, talking to himself, full of himself,
in a fabulous, indomitable state of mind.
Molly and Romeo keep looking at each other and shrugging,
Tin Cup's on a roll and needs no help. So far...
A couple of the regulars shout out encouragement.
CLINT/EARL
You the man, Tin Cup! You the
man!
ROMEO
They bugging you, boss -- I can
shut 'em up?
TIN CUP
The way I'm swinging today,
56.
nothing bugs me -- except
insufficient applause.
(surveying the
fairway)
Gimme the lumber.
But Romeo is handing him a two iron.
ROMEO
I think two iron's safer.
TIN CUP
I said I want the Big Dog.
Romeo looks warily down the fairway of a tight dogleg
left par five.
ROMEO
Tight par five, out of bounds
left... you don't want to hit
driver.
TIN CUP
I'm not going left of those trees.
I'm going over those trees... with
a little draw. That way I get
home in two. That way I'm putting
for eagle.
ROMEO
You don't need eagle to qualify!
You need to get used to playing
smart -- no mistakes wins the
Open.
TIN CUP
Qualify? I want the course
record! Now gimme the lumber!
Tin Cup reaches for the driver.
Romeo shifts the golf
bag beyond Tin Cup's reach.
ROMEO
You not going to listen to me?
You don't care I'm trying to help?
You think I'm full of shit?
TIN CUP
I think I'm gonna get penalized
for slow play if you don't give me
that fucking driver.
ROMEO
You a head case, boss, always
were, always will be.
57.
TIN CUP
Then let's ask the head doctor.
Dr. Griswold?
(to Molly)
Dr. Griswold, should I hit the Big
Dog or the two?
Suddenly an OFFICIAL steps forward.
P.G.A. OFFICIAL
Soliciting shot selection advice
is a two-stroke penalty.
MOLLY
Trust your feelings, Roy.
TIN CUP
(to Romeo)
Ha!
Gimme the driver and shut up.
Romeo pulls out the driver and he snaps it in half over
his knee. He tosses the two halves on the ground near
Tin Cup.
ROMEO
... Go ahead.
Hit the driver.
Tin Cup looks at the two halves of his driver, curbing
his anger, not giving Romeo the satisfaction of a
reaction.
TIN CUP
I changed my mind. Gimme the
three wood.
ROMEO
You can't clear the dogleg with a
three wood.
TIN CUP
Wanna bet?
Romeo pulls out the three wood, snaps it
over his knee,
and tosses the halves on the ground next
to the driver
halves. Tin Cup turns with amusement to
his playing
partners, lest they think management has
lost the upper
hand with labor.
TIN CUP
Guess I'm going with the safe
shot, boys.
Tin Cup reaches for the two iron, studies it a moment,
frowns, and then:
He snaps it over his knee. He dumps these halves on the
ground with the halves of the driver and three wood.
58.
Romeo stares, aghast.
Tin Cup merely shrugs.
TIN CUP
Sometimes I fan that two iron.
Better gimme the three.
Romeo warily hands Tin Cup the three iron.
Tin Cup looks
at it, frowns, then:
He snaps it over his knee and tosses it on the ground.
Molly leans over to the regulars.
MOLLY
Is this normal behavior for him?
EARL
The word 'normal' and him don't
collide in the same sentence too
often.
She watches in amazement as --
TIN CUP
Sometimes I catch that three a
little thin...
He drops the three iron halves with the other halves, and
steps past Romeo and sequentially yanks all but the seven
iron from his bag.
He snaps them over his knee, one by one, citing the
crimes of each club with mounting absurdity and ire.
TIN CUP
And I've hooked my four iron...
(snap)
... and hit flyers with the
five...
(snap)
... and shanked the six...
(snap)
... and skulled the eight...
(snap)
... and fatted the nine...
(snap)
... and chili-dipped the wedge...
(snap)
... and bladed the sand wedge...
(snap; then pauses
to reflect
contemptuously
on his putter)
... and then there's Mister
Three-putt...
He snaps the putter in half and dumps it in the pile of
59.
broken clubs at his feet.
Then, he reaches for the last club in his bag, the seven
iron. The regulars hold their breath, thinking this is
the end of Tin Cup's Open bid. But...
Tin Cup smiles and caresses the seven iron
affectionately.
TIN CUP
But the seven iron, I never miss
the seven iron. It's the only
truly safe club in my bag.
He moves to the tee, drops a ball, and hits it down the
middle with the seven iron.
TIN CUP
You happy, Romeo?
ROMEO
No, boss, I'm tired... my life's
too short to spend it watching you
fall apart. I done it too many
times.
Romeo turns and starts walking away.
TIN CUP
What's this? You're quitting?
First sign of adversity, you're
quitting?
(as Romeo
continues)
Anyone want to bet me I can't par
in with a seven iron?
(to Molly)
Doc? Take the bet?
MOLLY
Roy -- just shut up and hit the
ball.

and cockiness, and pronounces --

Tin Cup holds court surrounded by his regulars and much

Beer for everybody.
CLINT
You the man, Tin Cup!
A toast is raised to their king, and Tin Cup eats it up.
TIN CUP
Thanks, boys, what'ya think was my
best shot -- the seven iron on
twelve, the seven iron on
fourteen, or maybe it was the
bunker shot on eighteen which, to
my recollection was a -- seven iron?
Much laughter.
This is the Tin Cup they love.
EARL
You definitely the man!
TIN CUP
How'd I do, Doc?
MOLLY
(cheerfully)
You failed miserably.
61.
TIN CUP
What?! I parred the back nine
with a seven iron, I qualified for
the regionals, I --
MOLLY
Your job is not just to qualify
for the Open, it's to prepare for
the Open. My job is to help you
prepare.
TIN CUP
You said to 'trust my feelings'!
MOLLY
I didn't know you felt like
breaking all the clubs in your
bag.
CLINT
He didn't break the seven!
EARL
He smoked that seven, brother --
MOLLY
From what I understand, the U.S.
Open is the most difficult golf
tournament in the world played
under the most difficult
circumstances with the greatest
players -- winning it means
controlling yourself, managing
your emotions, staying cool, not
getting in a pissing contest with
your caddie who, incidentally,
quit.
TIN CUP
He always quits, he always comes
back.
MOLLY
Nonetheless, from the mental
aspect -- which is my domain --
you have regressed and are
fumbling somewhere between
delusion and denial.
TIN CUP
'Regression, delusion, denial'?
You gotta use all this
psychological language?
MOLLY
I'm a psychologist.
62.
Tin Cup turns to the regulars for support.
VOICE (O.S.)
Have a bad day, Roy?
Everyone turns to see David Simms enter the conversation.
MOLLY
Hi, honey...
TIN CUP
I shot 65 -- parred the backside
with a seven iron.
SIMMS
(intrigued)
Why?
MOLLY
That's the question -- why?
Silence.
CLINT
'Cause he broke all his other
clubs.
EARL
Snapped 'em in two -- even the
putter.
SIMMS
Jesus, Roy, I'm on your side here.
We go way back... I hope you get
into the Open, but if you don't
play under control, you'll get
slaughtered. Good players shoot
82 in the Open. You can't always
go for it.
TIN CUP
Swear to God, Doc, this guy is
not who you think.
CLINT
It's a well-known fact that if a
camera's not on him, he treats old
people and children like dirt.
EARL
And dogs.
TIN CUP
Yeah, don't forget the dogs.
MOLLY
I think we should go, David.
63.
SIMMS
I think so...
Tin Cup's worst characteristics flare up, he won't let
go.
TIN CUP
You ever shoot par with a seven
iron?
SIMMS
It never occurred to me to try.
(to Molly)
C'mon, let's go. The car's over
here....
TIN CUP
I'll bet you a thousand dollars
against my car that I can beat you
in any game -- any game, you name
it -- with a seven iron.
SIMMS
This is ridiculous.
TIN CUP
You a coward? You gonna lay up
the way you did at the Masters
last year?
REGULARS
(taunting, like
children)
Chickie, chickie, chickie...
Simms is a little drawn in, not so much by the challenge
as the desire to shut up Tin Cup.
SIMMS
Any game, I name it?
MOLLY
Oh, come on, David --
SIMMS
I just want to teach him a lesson.
MOLLY
Why do men insist on measuring
their dicks?
Tin Cup takes her literally and rises, starting to
unbuckle his belt.
TIN CUP
Awright, awright! Let's measure,
64.
right now!
MOLLY
For God sakes, I wasn't being
literal!
(beat)
David, let's go.
SIMMS
Molly, trust me on this one. Call
it part of his mental preparation
for the Open, where the rough is
deep, the greens are slick, and
the nerves are shattered.
(to Tin Cup)
I'll take the bet.
MOLLY
Oh, jeez...
The Regulars cheer -- this is what they live for. Simms
hands a roll of cash to Molly. Tin Cup hands her his car
keys.
TIN CUP
Awright!
What's the game?
SIMMS
One swing each. Who can hit the
longest seven iron --
TIN CUP
It's a lock! I hit the seven like
John Daly hits a three!
The Regulars whoop it up. Their man's a cinch. Tin Cup
pulls a ball from his pocket, drops it right on the
ground in the middle of the patio.
TIN CUP
From right here, okay?
SIMMS
Fine with me.
MOLLY
You guys are really being
childish --
SIMMS
Molly, leave this one to me.
TIN CUP
Dr. Griswold, I know what I'm
doing.
Tin Cup takes a couple of swings to limber up, aiming out
65.
onto an open area of the course.
Serious, intent, the
look of eagles...
TIN CUP
(to himself)
Dollar bills...
He takes a full back-swing, opens beautifully, and
launches a seven iron like a rocket out toward some
driving range markers... to "oohs" and "ahhs" from his
faithful.
The ball lands at a 170 yard marker and bounces further.
CLINT
Them signs are at least thirty
yards farther -- that ball musta
gone 220...
TIN CUP
That ball's about 2-2-7... toed it
a bit... but it'll do...
REGULARS
Nearly 230 with a seven!
Pureed
it, baby, he pureed it!
Tin Cup hands Simms the seven iron.
TIN CUP
Take a minute to limber up, fine
with me --
SIMMS
Don't need to.
Simms is still in a sport jacket, slacks, no golf shoes.
TIN CUP
Take your jacket off?
SIMMS
No, no, I'm fine.
Simms drops a ball about where Tin Cup's sat.
He stands
above the ball and addresses it.
TIN CUP
(cockily)
You're gonna need to muscle up,
big guy -- give it the old steroid
jerk...
Simms is cool as ice. He smiles, then moves around to
the other side of the ball, suddenly facing away from the
course. This baffles everyone.
66.
REGULARS
What the hell you doin'?
Wha's
this?
And David Simms hits an effortless seven iron out toward
the desert, onto the lonely highway...
59
... and the ball bounces and bounces and bounces, for
59
About three miles, forever. It's probably still going...

TIN CUP hits a wedge approach -- the ball lands inches

TIN CUP
Straight?! Thing's a roller
coaster breaks four ways and dies

EARL
Actually, I am blind... 20-60 in
one eye -- and that's the good
eye...
TIN CUP
I got a blind caddie... just hold
the stick, Earl -- and be sure to
pull it out...
Tin Cup studies the hell out of this putt. If it goes
in, he's in the Open. He misses, back to Salome.
MOLLY (V.O.)

Tin Cup shakes the Walkman and pounds his ears.

Yeah, yeah... I'm flying solo

TIN CUP
I gotta make this putt.

MARSHAL
Obviously.
Tin Cup stares endlessly at the long putt.
TIN CUP
... just pick the line, feel the
speed -- bad timing, doc, Jesus...
He steps up to the putt, still talking to himself.
TIN CUP
Like a million others you made in
your life, Roy. Just see it going

back of the jar... just pull the
goddamn trigger, you pussy...
76
He strokes the putt -- It starts right, curls back
76
left, straightens out, over the ridge, back again,
endlessly...
TIN CUP
Pull the stick, Earl, pull it!
Earl's having trouble with the flagstick, shaking it,
panicking, and finally -- he snaps it free, but...
The ball stops dead on the lip of the cup.
Tin Cup contorts in anguished body-English, then falls to
his back like a shot animal.
TIN CUP
Choking dogs die!
And the BALL falls into the cup with a CLICK -- and a
ROAR.
Tin Cup takes a peek at the cup.
The ball stays in the
hole.

The Winnebago returns home, a travelling party of beer,

Tin Cup arrives, fresh from the qualifier.
Romeo is
shafting glubs.
TIN CUP
Romes!
You've come back!
(no answer)
You shoulda been there, Romes, I
drained a 30-foot snake to
qualify!
(off no answer)
Earl gave me a straight read --
the thing broke half a dozen times
-- missed ya, pods!
Romeo gives him the silent treatment.
TIN CUP
Okay, don't talk to me -- but
you're still my guy...
(losing patience)
It's a little late to be pissed
off! We're in the Open! You and
me!
Still nothing from Romeo.
TIN CUP
Awright, be that way --
(switches course)
-- say... has Molly been around?
ROMEO
I knew you had the hots for her.
TIN CUP
What's this? Garbo speaks? Of
course I have the hots for her and
I'm doing a damn good job of
keeping things platonic and
professional till I kick Simms'
ass and show her I ain't who she
thinks I am because, in fact, I am
who she thinks I am but if I win
the Open I won't be.
Romeo stares back at that curious logic.
ROMEO
Well, I don't think her nor me nor
the God of Golf his self can keep
you from blowing up in the Open...
TIN CUP
I made it this far! I just got to
hold it together for 72 more
76.
holes!
ROMEO
There's a lotta triple bogeys out
there waiting to grab your ass.
TIN CUP
(cheerily)
You're complaining again! Romeo's
back! Whining, bitching, pissed
off -- you're my man!
Silence.
Some chagrin.
ROMEO
You didn't fall in love with Earl
to be your caddie?
TIN CUP
He was a wheezing heart attack
waiting to happen -- cost me
three strokes a side...
(beat)
I carried my bag the last four
holes. I love ol' Earl but I need
you.
ROMEO
You don't love me?
TIN CUP
(exasperated)
I love you, too, God damn it!
ROMEO
As much as Earl?
TIN CUP
I don't know! Yes, yes, as much
as Earl --
(beat)
More than Earl!
ROMEO
Am I special?
TIN CUP
If you can remove the sexual
connotations and overlay a golf
theme, Romeo -- I am your Juliet.
Romeo ponders it all.
ROMEO
Muy bien, Julietta. In that case
-- I am your caddy once again.
77.
TIN CUP
Podnuh.
They shake hands.
TIN CUP
Awright... now that we got that
bullshit outta the way, I'm gonna
hit me some balls and start oilin'
that sweet swing o' mine for the
big boys...
Romeo sits back in the shade, still washing the thousands
of golf balls in the rack, watching as --
79
Tin Cup drops a bucket of balls on the hardscrabble
79
ground, pulls out a club and limbers up.
TIN CUP
Nobody heard from Molly, eh?
ROMEO
You got it bad, don't ya?
TIN CUP
Somethin' about that chick...
Tin Cup addresses the ball and takes a swing.
Everything
looks normal in his swing, but...
Thwock! -- the BALL squirls off to the side and RATTLES
against a fence. Ugly.
TIN CUP
Hmmm... little chili dipper
there...
ROMEO
Be sure to do that in the Open.
Unfazed, Tin Cup steps up to hit again, but... once
more --
Thwock! -- Another horrible-looking squib to the right.
Romeo stops washing balls and notices, watching Tin Cup.
Thwock, thwock! -- Something's terribly wrong.
CLOSE ON TIN CUP
Concern crosses his face.
TIN CUP
Romeo!
78.
ROMEO
I'm watching.
TIN CUP
It ain't no chili dipper.
ROMEO
Yeah, boss, you got the 'S' word.
TIN CUP
What am I doing wrong?
ROMEO
Shanks are like a virus -- they
just show up. Nobody can figure
'em out.
Thwock, thwock, thwock! -- Three more chili dippers.
Our
man definitely has the shanks. And he's panicking.
TIN CUP
Romes!
Something's terribly
wrong.
What's your guess?!
ROMEO
It's the woman.
TIN CUP
I thought you said it was a virus?
ROMEO
A woman can have the same effect.
TIN CUP
What do I do?
ROMEO
Keep swinging...
DISSOLVE TO:

Thwock, thwock, thwock! -- Night has fallen and he still
has the shanks.
The regulars have gathered and are huddled, murmuring.
The word has spread like wildfire -- Tin Cup has the
shanks.
CLINT
Never thought it would happen...
EARL
The shanks is for us mortals, not
79.
for the great ones...
JOSE
Esta muy feo... muy, muy feo...
(It is very ugly, very, very ugly...)
Tin Cup angrily throws his club out into the night and
turns to the regulars.
TIN CUP
Y'know why they named this game
'golf'? 'Cause the words 'fuck'
and 'shit' were already taken!
A CAR HORN HONKS -- All heads turn to see:
POV SHOT - PINK CORVETTE
pulls in -- Doreen gets out, carrying a big package.
DOREEN
Hiya, fellas!
TIN CUP
What is this? Everybody like to
watch a train wreck?!
Doreen approaches the regulars, and we notice for the
first time that there are a number of bags and packages
with the boys.
DOREEN
He's in one of his pleasant moods,
I see --
ROMEO
He's got the shanks. We got the
makings of a Greek tragedy here.
DOREEN
(shouting to
Tin Cup)
Quit whining and get over here.
We've got something for you.
Tin Cup drags his sorry ass to the group.
TIN CUP
Unless it's a 'swing thought,' I'm
not interested...
DOREEN
(ignoring his
attitude)
We're here to sponsor you in the
80.
Open. Me an' the boys have pooled
our resources and come up with
some cash so you can look and feel
as spiffy as all them big-name
pros.
TIN CUP
But I got the shanks --
DOREEN
Yeah, and you obviously still have
a hard-on for the doctor chick --
your face is all screwed up and
tight like you haven't been laid
in awhile --
TIN CUP
Is it really that obvious?
DOREEN
It's not a good look for you.
Roy, your heart is not the only
organ you wear on your sleeve.
There's a certain, vulgar appeal
to your transparency.
Tin Cup shrugs.
She always has him outflanked.
CLINT
C'mon, Tin Cup, we're trying to
make you a presentation --
TIN CUP
Awright, awright...
She unwraps a tour golf bag -- Big gold and red lettering
advertises "The Golden Tassel." Pastie tassels hang from
all over the bag. Doreen sets it down proudly.
DOREEN
I got the Golden Tassel to sponsor
you at the Open.
TIN CUP
You expect me to pack that around?
ROMEO
I'm carrying the bag.
DOREEN
It's worth four hundred dollars
endorsement money to you --
Earl steps forward with a golf shirt bedecked with sewn
on patches and logos.
81.
EARL
See, Dewey got you First State
Banking of Salome, and Clint got
you Short-Haul Trucking and I got
you Brink and Brown sanitation --
TIN CUP
I'm being sponsored by a sewage
disposal system?
EARL
We call it human resources
management, Roy, please...
Jose steps forward with a golf cap, also emblazoned.
JOSE
I've got Wally's Smokehouse for ya
-- kind of a nice sign...
DEWEY
And since I couldn't get the post
office to come aboard, me and my
girl friend Muriel's gonna buy a
fan club patch you can put anywhere
you want.
Doreen and the regulars look at Tin Cup proudly.
TIN CUP
I'm supposed to wear this shit?
JOSE
This shit is us, man.
You can't
win without us.
DOREEN
You're the pride of Salome!
TIN CUP
Hell, I won't even make the cut!
DOREEN
What happened to your confidence?
ROMEO
He's shanking his love life so
he's shanking the golf ball.
DOREEN
Must be true love.
ROMEO
He's a goner.
Tin Cup surveys all the bizarre sponsorship loot, and
starts loosening up. These are his people, after all,
82.
and they're behind him all the way.
TIN CUP
Look, everybody, this is great.
I'm sorry I'm acting so pathetic
but my swing's never abandoned me
before. I just need a little time
to work it out.
EARL
Anything you want --
CLINT
Give him some room, boys --
TIN CUP
(to anyone who'll
listen)
Maybe it's my grip... maybe I'm
opening up too soon... too late...
coming over the top... no,
dropping underneath...
(beat)
Oh, sweet Jesus, why have you
abandoned me?
DOREEN
(to the regulars)
He's trying to talk to God.
It's
time for us to go.
Doreen and the regulars quietly slip away to leave Tin
Cup with his newly sponsored gifts and, more importantly,
his newly lost grip, swing, and confidence.
ROMEO
You want me to stay, boss?
TIN CUP
I need to be alone.
ROMEO
You got it.
And Romeo herds the rest of them out to their cars in the
lot. And as they drive away, Tin Cup sits down, his head
in his hands.

But Roy isn't driving -- Molly is.

She knocks.
MOLLY
Roy?
Anybody home?
There's no answer so she tries the door, and walks in on:

Tin Cup and Molly in his convertible.
He works on her

TIN CUP
I know a spot along the river's

MOLLY
Not tonight.
TIN CUP
'Not tonight' means maybe some
other night?
MOLLY
I didn't mean it like that.
TIN CUP
Consciously you didn't mean it
like that -- but how about
unconsciously, you're the expert,
did you mean it unconsciously?
MOLLY
Unconsciously, Roy, I don't have a
clue what I'm talking about.
TIN CUP
I feel we're making progress.
87.
MOLLY
I do too. But I have no idea what
it's progress towards...
A84

The Caddy pulls up in front of her office at the new
mall. She gets out.
MOLLY
Good luck in the Open, Roy.
TIN CUP
Put your money on me, Doc, the

He drives away, and we stay:

ROMEO

Goin' to the U.S. Open with the
shanks. Gonna be chili dipping my
way around the course on worldwide
television... sure, relax.
ROMEO
I'm gonna get rid of them shanks

TIN CUP
Molly and I are circling each

ROMEO
She the enemy, boss.

Naw...

ROMEO
Well she wakin' up with the enemy

TIN CUP
Tell me something, Romes -- the
absolute truth -- you think I can
go 72 holes without falling apart.
Romeo keeps driving, pretends not to hear.
TIN CUP
You heard me! I don't want no
bullshit... do you think I can do
it?
ROMEO
I don't know, boss, I just don't

And Tin Cup puts on his Walkman, and stares out the

ROMEO
Look! Right there! Fred

Romeo notices that Tin Cup is staring at the pile of
practice balls lying there on the tee.
TIN CUP
Look at these balls. Brand new
Titleists. Lookit 'em, every one
a brand new Titleist.
(lowers his voice)
Sneak a few in the bag when you
get a chance. We swipe enough
free shit we might even pay for
this fiasco.
Tin Cup limbers up, trying not to be in awe of the real
legends who line the practice range, hitting beautiful
shot after beautiful shot with graceful ease.
ROMEO
You think it would be
inappropriate to ask Ray Floyd for
an autograph?
TIN CUP
I think it's a dead giveaway,
Romes... but if I still got the
shanks we're gonna be found out
real fast...
Tin Cup nudges a ball from the pile into address
position. Romeo hands him a different club.
ROMEO
Hit the seven iron. You never
miss the seven...
92.
TIN CUP
Good thought, Pods...
Tin Cup waggles, shakes, limbers, addresses...
TIN CUP
Dollar bills...
And he swings.
THWOCK! A hideous shank squirrels across line, almost
hitting a group of U.S. Open officials. Heads turn.
TIN CUP
(to anyone who'll
listen)
Who hit that shot? Anybody see?
He addresses another one.
And swings.
THWOCK!
A disaster.
He crumbles.
ROMEO
A little thin, Boss.
TIN CUP
A little fucking thin?! I still
got the shanks! Everybody's
watching! Christ, Simms is here...
Simms has arrived and is watching Tin Cup with delight as
he loosens up.
ROMEO
Maybe we should work on putting.
Ya can't shank a putt.
Tin Cup pretends to limber a little more before daring to
strike another ball.
TIN CUP
If you're the Mexican Mac O'Grady,
Romes, you gotta figure out why
I'm still shanking the ball.
(beat)
What's the problem? I'm catching
it on the hosel, right? Moving my
head? I'm laying off it, I'm
pronating, I'm supinating, I'm
clearing too early, I'm clearing
too late, I'm off plane, I ain't
dropping in -- oh, God, my swing
feels like an unfolding lawn chair.
ROMEO
You got a virus in your brain.
I

got to kill the brain to kill the
virus.
TIN CUP
Anything.
Kill me now!
ROMEO
Put all your change in your right
pocket.
Tin Cup follows orders, not questioning the logic.
ROMEO
Very good. Now tie your left
shoelace in a double knot.
Again, Tin Cup dutifully follows orders.
ROMEO
Esta bueno. Now, turn your hat
around backwards and put a blue
tee behind your right ear...
TIN CUP
I'll look like a fool.
ROMEO
What you think you look like
hitting those squirrelly chili
peppers up Freddy Couples' ass,
eh? Do what I say or I quit.
TIN CUP
Okay, okay...
ROMEO
Perfect... now hit a seven iron
into that tree over there. You're
ready.
Tin Cup hits a perfect seven iron into the trees.
TIN CUP
How'd I do that?
ROMEO
You ain't thinking about shanking,
you ain't thinking about the
doctor lady, you ain't thinking
period. You just lookin' like a
fool and hittin' it pure -- your
natural state.
TIN CUP
Fuck you.

ROMEO
You cured.
TIN CUP
That's it?
ROMEO
That's it. Your brain was getting
in the way.
TIN CUP
That's rarely been a problem.
What now?
ROMEO
Well, I should recommend you go
work on your short game but I
think it's better if you go get
drunk instead.
TIN CUP
Get drunk?
ROMEO
Yeah. You always play better when
you're wasted.
Tin Cups stares at the swami, and --

The first tee -- the early morning air is heavy and

gallery is sparse. The silence is broken by the
starter's voice.
STARTER (V.O.)
With the honor in the 7:08
pairing, from Salome, Texas,
Mr. Roy McAvoy.
A half-dozen people clap, and --
Tin Cup and Romeo stagger to the tee, barely making it on
time. Tin Cup is massively hung-over and unshaven.
TIN CUP
No time for a bucket, eh?
ROMEO
Almost missed the starting time
trying to get you off the floor,
boss. You don't handle the hooch
like you used to...
Tin Cup tries to get warm quickly, taking a few hurried
practice swings. The early tee times are strictly for
the longest of long shots, and almost nobody is around.
Tin Cup's hand shakes as he closes the Velcro flap on his
glove. He's wearing the hat and shirt with the sew-on
patches, as he stares down the first fairway.
Romeo hands him a driver.
96.
ROMEO
I seen this hole on TV. Hit the
big dog down the chute --
TIN CUP
No, I've learned my lesson. Gonna
play it safe, smart, conservative.
Fairways and greens. Hand me the
two iron.

You sure?
TIN CUP
Thought of the day is -- `be

Eleven bogeys and seven pars. I
didn't make a three. I didn't
make one goddam three all day.
ROMEO
You weren't trying to make threes.
You were trying to avoid making

ROMEO
Maybe that was a coaching error on

Simms cuts down behind the tent toward the clubhouse,

CUT TO:

We hear Ben Wright's voice as Tin Cup marks his ball on
the green. A small gallery has begun to follow him.
WRIGHT (V.O.)
If anyone was ever to make a run
at what is the most storied number
in Open history, Miller's sixty-
three, it would be today when the
rain has softened the greens,
enabling the players to take dead
aim at the flags. Still, the
unswerving courage of an unknown
driving range pro from Salome has
raised that humble journeyman from
the ashes of an ignominious
eighty-three to wave a mighty fist
at the pantheon of golf's
immortals. This man, this Roy
McAvoy has laid siege to the
record book by birdieing the first
seven holes. A brave par from the
water at eight, and a glorious
birdie three at the daunting
twelfth, another at thirteen...
Tin Cup gets his read, and steps up to putt.
WRIGHT (V.O.)
... this putt to go ten under for
the day...
Tin Cup putts -- When the ball is still two feet from the
hole, Tin Cup raises his putter in triumph... and sure
enough, the ball drops in the hole.

Tin Cup and Romeo survey the shot -- a long downhill

ROMEO

Tin Cup looks at the iron Romeo proffers. He looks back
at the shot, throws some grass in the air, testing the
wind. He looks at the gallery, the lake, the green, the
whole grand setting... and then:
He locates Molly behind the gallery ropes, watching.
She
makes a little charging gesture with her fist. And:
Tin Cup reaches defiantly past Romeo and pulls out the
three wood.

Venturi and Nantz watch Tin Cup set up to play the shot.
VENTURI
His adrenalin's gotten the better
of him, Jim. If he lays up he
takes bogey out of play.
VENTURI (CONT'D)
But if he knocks this ball in the
water he could make seven or eight.
And he still has to think about
making the cut.
SUMMERALL
Well, every golf fan in America is
pulling for him.

Wearing that look, the look of eagles, Tin Cup addresses 111

club, the gallery roars, and...
TIN CUP
Nope.

He swings and holds the pose. He caught the ball
perfectly -- it sails high and true into the luffing

ROMEO
It's a water hazard. You go up

Tin Cup's eyes blink with thought as Romeo's words get

No one's ever been ten under for
the Open, not even Nicklaus.
JACOBSEN
That's right, Ledge. Not even
Nicklaus.
And he moves off to putt. Tin Cup drops a couple balls
on the green to putt, and:
A ball rolls past them and into a hole.
Tin Cup looks
over and sees Simms.
SIMMS
Sorry, Roy, can't believe I didn't
see you with all that high-priced
endorsement crap you're flaunting.
TIN CUP
That's always been your problem,
Dave. You don't think about
winning; you just want to look
good.
(turns away
to putt)
Thing is, this ain't a beauty
pageant.
(turns back, getting
in Simms' face)
And it ain't a rain-shortened Quad
Cities or a Greater Greensboro you
can back into. This is you'n me,
pal. This is match-play, and this
time you ain't getting no three
shots.
CUT TO:
125
125
A large gallery surrounds the tree and lines the fairway
as:
STARTER
With the honor in the final
pairing, from Salome, Texas, Mr.
Roy McAvoy.
Boisterous applause.
Tin Cup tips his cap and nods at
117.
David Simms, his pairing in this the final twosome of the
final round of the U.S. Open.
TIN CUP
Fairways and greens, Dave... and
don't forget to wave as I blow by.
SIMMS
You mean blow up? Like you always
do?
And Tin Cup moves to the tee.
His hand shakes worse than it did the first day as he
tees his ball. Stepping back to line up his shot, he
peers down the fairway through a narrow corridor of
faces. A daunting sight. He edges over to Romeo and
tautly whispers:
TIN CUP
Do me a favor. Bet me a buck I
don't put it in the fairway.
ROMEO
I bet you a hundred.
TIN CUP
Okay, good.
(going to tee off)
Puts things back in perspective.
CUT TO:
126
126
Tin Cup looks at his ball, almost invisible in the deep
rough. He tries to locate the green beyond the trees
that surround him. In golf parlance, he's in jail. He
selects a club.
ROMEO
Which way you going?
Tin Cup points over the trees.
Romeo grimaces.
Tin Cup
addresses the shot. Then:
Tin Cup swings -- the ball flutters weakly out of the
rough and disappears into the branches of a bushy tree,
dropping eventually next to its trunk, and:
CUT TO:
127
LEADER BOARD
127
A scorer changes the number beside Tin Cup's name from -7
118.
to -5.
Simms is still -7.
CUT TO:
128
128
Tin Cup arrives on the tee where Simms now has the honor.
SIMMS
Nice double, Roy.
TIN CUP
Just keep making pars, asshole.
SIMMS
I'll take eighteen of 'em.
TIN CUP
And I will own you.
CUT TO:
129
129
Molly and Doreen stand together behind the big gallery.
Molly is using a cardboard periscope to look over the
gallery to the green. Doreen is on her tip-toes but all
she can see are the backs of heads.
A swell of cheers builds, then turns to groans.
MOLLY
Oh no, Tin Cup ran it five feet
past.
(beat)
How did he get the name 'Tin Cup'?
DOREEN (O.S.)
He played catcher on the high
school baseball team. The star
pitcher had this big-league curve,
and not all his pitches hit Roy
in the mitt. Finally, you gotta
respect a man's doggedness. You
know?
(beat)
The team decided Tin Cup sounded
better than Clank.
Molly puts down the periscope at that remark, and hands
it to Doreen.
MOLLY
'Clank''s not a good name for a
man...
119.
Doreen looks through the periscope.
PERISCOPE'S POV - TIN CUP
lining up a putt.
She pans over to Romeo helping him.
DOREEN (V.O.)
Tell me something, Molly... have
you ever had a Latin lover?
CUT TO:
130
130
The regulars study the board -- the scruffiest lot ever
seen at an Open. Next to them stand a group of U.S.G.A.
officials, all in neat, matching blazers. The contrast
is thrilling.
CLINT
Our boy's in trouble... ya think
he's chokin'?
EARL
Our boy don't choke. He fucks up
but he don't choke...
The scorer changes the number beside Tin Cup's name to
-- -4. Simms is -7, and --
CUT TO:
131
131
Wright looks at the monitor where Tin Cup stands among
some trees.
BEN WRIGHT
This is disaster for McAvoy.
After losing three shots to par in
the first four holes, he should
have just taken iron off the tee
to get the ball in play. Does he
have any shot at all, Gary McCord?
132
132
Tin Cup's ball lies on dirt next to the trunk of a tree.
He surveys his options. Behind him, wearing a headset,
McCord analyzes the situation for the TV viewers.
120.
McCORD
This is definite jail. This is
life without parole. His only
chance to stage a jail-break is go
at the ball left-handed and hope
he can somehow snake it back into
the fairway, and save par from
there.
Tin Cup glares balefully back at McCord. Then he walks
over to a nearby tree, and surveys the line to the green
from it. He walks back for his ball, turns to McCord...
and we see that familiar fierceness aflame in Tin Cup's
eyes.
TIN CUP
Fifty bucks says I knock it on...
with a seven iron.
And he selects the seven iron, addresses the ball right- handed,
and:
He swings -- the ball rockets low off his club, and...
... it ricochets off the trunk of a nearby tree, and...
... it bounces up the fairway, skitters past a trap, and
trickles onto the green, stopping ten feet from the pin.
The gallery goes crazy as Tin Cup steps from the woods
collecting his money from McCord while jabbing a taunting
finger at Simms.
133
134
Simms ignores Tin Cup's taunt, and lines up his shot.
SIMMS
(to himself)
That's just Roy being Roy. Just
wait him out, Dave. Just make
pars. Let him make the mistakes.
And he hits his iron to the fat part of the green, and --
TIN CUP (O.S.)
Beauty, Dave.
Par written all
over it.
121.
135
135
The scorer posts a -5 next to Tin Cup's name.
Simms is
still at -7, and --
CUT TO:
136
136
Tin Cup intently follows the flight of his iron shot, as:
The ball lands near the front of the green, bounces, then
rolls, following the contour of the green. It finally
stops five feet from the pin.
A SWELLING, DEAFENING ROAR from the GALLERY accompanies
the unfolding shot, and --
137
137
Jacobsen looks toward the roar at the ninth green.
JACOBSEN
He's making his run.
138
138
The scorer posts a -6 next to Tin Cup's name.
Simms is
still at -7.
CUT TO:
139
139
Molly and Doreen watch Tin Cup drain a putt.
MOLLY
(still watching
Tin Cup)
So why'd you leave him?
DOREEN
You ever dated a guy who actually
believes in soul mates?
MOLLY
Actually, no.
DOREEN
He thinks he's a tough guy, but
he's a hopeless romantic.
122.
And as the gallery falls silent, she turns to watch Tin
Cup.
CUT TO:
140
140
Tin Cup's firmly-struck putt spins out of the hole.
The
GALLERY GROANS, sharing his agony, and --
141
141
Jacobsen, pausing to watch, sighs with relief before
starting down the fairway.
CUT TO:
142
142
Tin Cup follows the flight of his approach, and up ahead
on:
143
143
Peter Jacobsen hears the GALLERY ROAR.
He turns to his
caddie, incredulous.
JACOBSEN
He's throwing darts back there.
We gotta make birdies, Squeaky, or
we are playing for second.
And he snatches his driver from the bag, determined to
make birdies.
CUT TO:
144
144
The scorer posts -7 next to Tin Cup's name.
Simms is
still at -7, as is Jacobsen. And...
145
145
Jacobsen rolls a long putt into the hole, and as the
GALLERY CHEERS, he points a finger of challenge back at --
Tin Cup waiting in the fairway.
Tin Cup seems to enjoy
the taunt.
TIN CUP
That's right, Peter. You'n me.
That's all there is.
123.
And he selects a club, and...
CUT TO:
146
147
The leader board is superimposed on the monitor.
McAvoy
-8, Jacobsen -8, Simms -7.
NANTZ
So it's come down to the seventy-
second hole of this great
championship, and the skill and
courage of three Texans who have
dueled throughout the day for the
chance to be crowned Open
Champion... Peter Jacobsen is on
the fairway at 8 under, McAvoy at
the 18th tee is tied at minus 8,
and David Simms trails by one...
148
148
Tin Cup and Romeo watch Jacobsen hit his shot.
TIN CUP
Jacobsen's laying up.
(turning to Simms)
You ain't gonna have that luxury,
Dave. Not if you play to win.
He moves to the tee, and...
CUT TO:
124.
149
149
The monitor shows Tin Cup's drive bounding down the
middle of the fairway.
NANTZ
McAvoy's hit a perfect drive, Ken.
VENTURI
I'm not sure that's good news for
McAvoy. With his inexperience,
the last thing he needs is an
excuse to fool with that water
again today.
150
BACK TO TEE
150
Tin Cup whispers to Romeo as Simms tees up.
TIN CUP
I didn't catch it all.
ROMEO
Then you got to lay up.
Simms rips a drive down the middle, the ball landing
a little short of Roy's.
151
151
Tin Cup in the fairway, studying his shot.
TIN CUP
So birdie wins it.
He looks at Simms, ten yards across the fairway from him.
TIN CUP
You or me, Dave?
Simms points to himself. He has a wood in his hands, but
he puts the club back and reaches for an iron. Tin Cup
edges closer to Romeo.
TIN CUP
(whispering)
He's laying up. Birdie to tie,
eagle to win, and that gutless
wonder's laying up.
ROMEO
(whispering)
Par to tie, birdie to win... you
lay up too, Roy. You can make
birdie laying up.
125.
They watch Simms lay up. Then Romeo offers Tin Cup an
iron, hoping he'll take it.
TIN CUP
You know something, Romeo? Eagle
puts me ten under. No one's ever
finished an Open ten under, not
even Nicklaus.
ROMEO
You don't need an eagle. Birdie
wins, par ties.
(firmly)
Hit the lay up. Hole a wedge for
goddamn eagle.
Tin Cup throws some grass in the air, looks back at the
green, the gallery, the whole grand setting... and he
seeks out Molly's face in the crowd. He moves over so
she can hear him.
TIN CUP
This is everything, ain't it?
This is the choice it comes down
to. This is our immortality...
ROMEO
No time to be thinkin'
'immortality,' Cup... time to be
thinkin' 7 iron.
Molly stands with Doreen, hearing Tin Cup's words.
Thrilled and terrified and spellbound, she finds herself
nodding. Doreen, on the other is turning ash-white.
DOREEN
Oh no. This is what always
happens. He's going for it.
MOLLY
Go for it!
DOREEN
No! He just needs par to tie!
Tell him to lay up! He listens to
you!
MOLLY
Go for it, Roy! Knock it on!
DOREEN
This is why we split up -- he
always went for it...
MOLLY
My problem is I've never been with
126.
a man who went for it...
DOREEN
Well, honey, he's your guy.
BACK TO TIN CUP
He selects the three wood.
Romeo sighs.
152
152
NANTZ
Good Lord, he's going for the
green.
VENTURI
This could be tragic.
153
153
Tin Cup's eyes focus with the look of eagles as he
addresses the shot.
TIN CUP
One swing, Roy. One good swing.
Dollar bills...
He swings -- the ball explodes off his club.
Tin Cup
holds the pose...
TIN CUP
We're home...
Suddenly a gust of wind blows, out of nowhere, and Tin
Cup's cap blows off, provoking immediate concern.
TIN CUP
... little gust there, Romes...
154
TELEVISION MONITOR
154
Picking up the flight of the ball approaching the green,
carried it seems by the swelling roar of the gallery.
The ball clears the water...
... and lands at the top of the slope fronting the
elevated green. It pops up in the air, lands just past
where it hit, and comes momentarily to rest. The gallery
roars. And then:
The ball starts trickling back down the slope, gaining
speed, moving towards the water, even as the gallery
screams for it to stop...
127.
... until finally it disappears into the water with
scarcely a ripple.
155
BACK TO TIN CUP
155
He stares first with betrayal, then with anger, and
looks at Romeo, who just shrugs, then at Molly.
MOLLY
You can still make par from up
there --
ROMEO
She's right, Pods, a drop and a
stroke, up and down par -- we'll
win it in sudden death.
But Tin Cup still has the look of eagles. He's staring
at the shot he just made, still holding the three wood.
TIN CUP
I nutted that thing. Little gust
from the gods cost me...
ROMEO
Helluva move you put on that
sucker, now let's get up there,
take the drop, and make our par,
tie Peter...
TIN CUP
I can make this shot.
ROMEO
Not now.
TIN CUP
Now.
Tin Cup throws another ball on the ground.
TIN CUP
I'm playing it from here.
MOLLY
Take your drop and make your par!
Tin Cup addresses the ball.
CUT TO:
156
156
Venturi nearly comes out of seat watching Tin Cup take a
128.
drop from his original lie.
VENTURI
I don't believe this. He just
took himself out of the tournament
with that drop. He could have
walked up to the hazard line,
saved par with a wedge and forced
a playoff with Jacobsen. Now he
needs a miracle shot.
McCORD (V.O.)
Ken, I'm right behind McAvoy here.
And all he said to his caddie was:
I can make it across.
157
157
Tin Cup swings again -- The ball sails long and true once
again, and once again...
158
... it lands into the hill, bounces once, and trickles
158
back into the water.
VENTURI (V.O.)
Oh, my.
This is tragic.
159
BACK TO TIN CUP
159
Holding his hand out to Romeo, as the gallery murmurs
uncomfortably.
TIN CUP
Gimme another ball.
BACK TO DOREEN AND MOLLY
watching behind the ropes.
MOLLY
I can't believe he's doing this.
DOREEN
(unfazed)
I can, honey...
MOLLY
He can blow the whole tournament!
DOREEN
It's a miracle he lasted this
long...
129.
CUT TO:
160
REGULARS
160
waiting at the green, amidst the rest of the gallery
who's in shock about Tin Cup's decisions to keep going
for it, keep trying to prove a point.
CLINT
He done blew a gasket, boys...
EARL
The wheels is definitely falling
off now...
JOSE
It was a miracle while it
lasted...
REGULARS' POV
Tin Cup swings a third time.
CUT TO:
161
161
A BALL lands SPLOOSH! in the WATER, and...
162
BACK UP FAIRWAY
162
Tin Cup holds out his hand for yet another ball, saying
nothing.
Romeo hands him another ball.
Tin Cup unloads another 3-wood.
Another splash.
Tin Cup holds out his hand again.
ROMEO
This is your last ball, man. If
this gets wet, you disqualified.
TIN CUP
I can make it across.
Tin Cup snatches the ball from Romeo's hand.
163
163
Venturi and Nantz can barely look at the monitor.
130.
VENTURI
This is the most painful thing
I've ever watched.
McCORD (V.O.)
Jim, this is the last ball he has
in his bag. If he doesn't finish
the hole with it, he can't turn in
a card. He'll be disqualified.
Venturi and Nantz cover their eyes.
Tin Cup unloads another three wood -- another splash.
164
BACK TO TIN CUP
164
He looks at Molly.
CLOSE ON MOLLY
She's just laughing.
Romeo tosses down another ball -- Tin Cup launches
his fifth attempt to clear the pond. Splash.
MOLLY
You're right, Roy, what the hell!
Let 'er rip!
DOREEN
You two are made for each other.
BACK TO TIN CUP
This is still all business to him.
He sets his jaw,
addresses the shot, and:
TIN CUP
Dollar bills...
He swings -- another perfect shot... but this time the
wind relents a knot, and:
165
BALL
165
clears the water, clears the slope, hits the front of the
green, rolls up toward the pin, and drops in the hole.
The gallery goes berserk!
166
BACK TO TIN CUP
166
Raising his three wood aloft in triumph, he looks over at
Molly and finally cracks a smile.
131.
166
CONTINUED:
166
And when she smiles back, he takes his hat off and walks
to the green, to as great an ovation as the game has ever
heard.
CUT TO:
167
BACK IN TELEVISION TOWER
167
Venturi and Nantz slump, drained, over their monitors.
CUT TO:
168
169
A roar goes up from the milling fans as Tin Cup emerges.
He tries to smile, but it's all dawning on him.
TIN CUP
My God... I just gave away the
Open...
And then McCord is there, shoving a mike in Tin Cup's
face.
132.
McCORD
Ledge, I know it's tough to talk
right now, but --
TIN CUP
It's not difficult to talk... it's
difficult to explain... I coulda
laid up and still won. I made a
twelve on the last hole of the U.S.
Open. You know how much money
that cost me?
McCORD
Cost you a bundle...
TIN CUP
I gotta get outta here.
McCORD
It was the greatest 12 I ever saw.
Back to you, Jim...
Tin Cup exits the scorers' tent and runs into the
regulars -- They're beaming, undyingly loyal.
CLINT AND EARL
Greatest 12 I ever saw... you
crunched that dog, baby...
gorgeous shot, etc...
He looks up and there's Molly -- He stops short.
They
embrace.
TIN CUP
Molly, I'm an idiot. I gave away
the Open. The one time in my life
I know the play is to hit the lay
up -- my whole life and future
and career on the line, and I
still can't make myself do it. I
am a twisted human being and a
cautionary tale. And I guess I'm
a fool?
MOLLY
Yes.
A magnificent fool...
DISSOLVE TO:
A170
A170
Mosquitoes, pools of light, the TRACTOR CHUGS around
picking up balls.
CUT TO:
133.
B170
170
Tin Cup and Molly are sitting, feet up, a couple Lone
Star beers beside them, just taking in the warm Texas
night. Her head rests on his shoulder. The world at
peace.
TIN CUP
Some people don't like West Texas
but I think it's the most
beautiful place on earth...
MOLLY
It has its charms...
(beat)
Y'know, by finishing in the top 15
at the Open you qualified to be in
it next year --
TIN CUP
Damn, I didn't know that...
MOLLY
I'm thinking with your game you
should go back to the Qualifying
School, try to get out on tour...
TIN CUP
Then I wouldn't see you...
MOLLY
Actually, I picked up a whole
bunch of new clients at the Open.
Lotta guys on the tour said if I
could do that much for you,
imagine what I could do for
them...
TIN CUP
There's a lotta head cases out
there, you could make a bundle...
MOLLY
And sleep in the Winnebago at
night...
134.
Silence.
TIN CUP
Y'know... a man goes through what
I've gone through, he's supposed
to learn something.
(beat)
I'm trying to figure out what I
learned. Did I learn anything?
MOLLY
You're learning some discipline and
self-control...
TIN CUP
And that there's a time in life to
play it safe...
MOLLY
That's great,
Roy... and I'm learning
how to listen
to the tuning fork,
throw caution
to the wind, and take
crazy risks I
never thought were
possible...
TIN CUP
C'mon, Molly, when did you ever take
a crazy risk?
MOLLY
I fell for you...
WIDE SHOT - LANDSCAPE
A desolate driving range outside of Salome, Texas. Bugs,
trucks passing in the night, and a tiny RADIO SENDING
GEORGE JONES across the plains.
FADE OUT.
