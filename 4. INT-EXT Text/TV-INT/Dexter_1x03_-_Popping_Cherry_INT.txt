                        I search for ones who think they beat 
                      the system.  They re not hard to find.  
                        Like young Jeremy Downs.

    Dexter sees JEREMY, 19, hardened beyond his years.  He steps 
    through the gate, squinting into the sunlight.  The guard 
    escorts Jeremy, who has no one to greet him, into a van that 
    says  Homestead Halfway House. 

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        Today, Jeremy is just another piece of 
                        trash on the street.  But four years 
                        ago, he was the toast of Miami...

                                                                              CUT TO:

    A SCREEN55

    An Asian REPORTER stands in a park, holding a microphone.  A 
    GRAPHIC reads:  BREAKING NEWS.  SANDRAYEE.  MIAMI.   Police 
    cars can be seen behind her, along with yellow police tape 
    stretched out to keep a gathering CROWD out of the park.

                                        SANDRAYEE
                      It was a gruesome scene today.  The 
                        bloody body of a teenage boy found 
                        stabbed to death inside this South 
                        Miami park.

    PULL BACK to reveal that we are --


    Dexter sits shirtless behind his desk on a hot Miami night, 
    eating popcornand watching the archived NEWS REPORT on his 
    computer.  A gentle breeze billows the curtains behind him.

                                        SANDRAYEE
                        Police haven t released the name of 
                      the victim, but our sources tell us 
                        that investigators are holding a 15-
                        year-old suspect in custody.  

    On the computer, B-ROLL NEWS FOOTAGE shows uniform officers 
    wheeling out a BODY covered by a white sheet, followed by 
    fuzzy LONG-LENS SHOTS of police poking aroundthe area.

                                        SANDRAYEE
                        We re hearing that the suspect lured 
                      the older boy to the pond to spot 
                        alligators.  But once they were alone, 
                      the victim was robbed and repeatedly 
                        stabbed.

                                                                        (CONTINUED)            DEXTER 103   "Popping Cherry"    Final Draft - 06/23/06     5.

    Using the mouse, Dexter closes the window on-screen with the 
    news report and clicks on a folder with AUTOPSY PHOTOS.  He 
    starts flipping through COLOR STILLS of the dirty, bloody 
    body of a HEAVYSET BOY, 17, crisscrossed with deep knife 
    wounds.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.) 
                      To the coroner, the knife strokes 
                        looked random, impulsive.  But I saw 
                      the work of a young virtuoso.  Too 
                        many major arteries were severed...  
                        femoral, brachial, carotid.

    Dexter, staring with wide eyes, takes a bite of popcorn.  He 
    clicks the mouse and a PHOTO OF JEREMY in the courtroom 
    appears.  The boy has a smug smile on his face.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        Jeremy got off easy.  Four years in a 
                        juvenile facility for manslaughter.  
                      But I knew what he was, and what he d 
                      do again.  All I had to do was circle 
                      my calendar... and wait.

    PUSH INTO the bulletin board near the desk, where on the 
    calendar a DATE IS CIRCLED that says:  Jeremy. 

                                                                      SMASH CUT TO:


    Rita sits on the toilet peeing and crying.  She reaches into 
    a vanity drawer mirror for a rubber band, pulls it onto her 
    wrist, and starts snapping it.  She hears a KNOCK.

                                                                            INTERCUT:


    Dexter stands outside the bathroom door.

                        Yes.

    Dexter really wants to help but isn t exactly sure how.

                                        DEXTER
                      Do you need toilet paper?

                                        RITA

                        He s gone.

    Rita dries her eyes, flushes the chain, and adjusts her 
    skirt.  She opens the door to find Dexter standing there.

                                        DEXTER
                      Guy clearly had no idea who he was

    Rita subconsciously pulls her sleeve over the rubber band.

                                        RITA
                      No, Dexter -- thanks.  No reports.  
                        Paul s out of our lives, I ve filed 
                      for divorce... I just want my past to

                      It went away in your RAV4.

                        work until you get another car.

    Rita slips her arm through Dexter s and heads outside.

                                        RITA
                      Or, I can take the bus like millions 
                      of other people.  Now c mon, let s go 
                        outside and enjoy this beautiful day.

    Off Rita forcing an impossibly hopeful smile --

    crimson blood stretching up a wall.  Dexter and ANGEL 
    BATISTA discuss the photo, pinned on a bulletin board.

                        drops are elliptical in shape.They 
                        were cast off by a weapon, something 
                      the killer swung overhead.

    As Dexter shows Batista a CRIME SCENE PHOTO, VINCE MASUKA 
    enters the work area.

                      on that one, yeah?  Yeah?

    Dexter just stares at them blankly.  Batista explains --

                        Mira aqu .  You do her doggy style,

                      you grab her hips and yell another 
                        woman s name.  Bam, you re riding a 
                        bronco  cause she s trying to buck you 
                        off.

    Masuka, getting into the spirit of things, lets out a holler 
    and pretends to ride.  Dexter can only stare in amazement.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        Many times in life, I feel like I m 
                        missing some essential piece of the 
                        human puzzle.  This is one of them.

    Debra runs up, looking for Dexter, and sees Masuka.

                                        DEBRA

    Dexter, craning his neck around in awe,enters the massive 
    indoor stadium,where the MiamiBladesplay hockey.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        I knew he d be back.  It feels like 
                        Christmas morning.


    Dexter enters the expansive space, which looks even bigger 
    with the uniform rows of empty seats.  SOUNDS of an active 
    murder scene echo across the cold, hard surfaces.  Dexter 
    stops at the perimeter of the ice rink and peers through the 
    plexiglass with child-like wonder.

    REVERSE ANGLE

    Reveals a woman s bloodless BODY PARTS, carefully wrapped in 
    butcher paper and stacked on ice inside the goalie net.  The 
    brunette HEAD of the victim is perched ghoulishly atop the 
    pile.  Crime scene PERSONNEL work the area.

                        right setting is essential, but this -- 
                        it s stunning.

    AT THE HOCKEY NET

    Batista and Masuka are already examining the body.  Dexter, 
    struggling not to slip, crosses the ice and joins them.

                                (realizing)
                        He s escalating the thrill.  Posing 
                      his victim in a 20,000-seat stadium 
                      for all Miami to see.  To show them, 
                        show us, what he s capable of doing.

    Debra eagerly slips and slides her way across the ice to 
    join them and skids into Dexter, who catches her.

                                        DEBRA
                        What dI miss?  What dI miss?

                        Relax.  You re not missing anything.

    Masuka smiles and waves a SEVERED HAND at Debra.  The 
    FINGERTIPS have been sliced off.

                                        MASUKA
                      But sheis... fingertips.

                        Fucking A!  That s my girl!
                                (toDexter)
                        This body belongs to the fingertips we 
                        found frozen in the ice truck.  Shari 
                        Taylor.  Another prostitute.

    Dexter smiles proudly at his sister.

                                        DEXTER
                        Well, no blood, no need for me.  I 
                        should probably get going.

    Doakes strides over, managing much better than Deb and Dex 
    did on the slick ice.  He glowers at Dexter.

                                        SGT. DOAKES

    Doakes walks away.  Intrigued, Dexter turns to Debra.

                                        DEXTER
                        There s really a suspect?

                                        DEBRA
                              (a little cocky)
                        I ll let you know, Bro.  When I get 
                        back from my first official homicide 
                        investigation.  Damn, it s good to be 
                      out of vice.  I can t wait to...

    Her voice trails off when Masuka stands, WIPING FRAME to 
    reveal the SEVERED HEAD of the victim.  Debra blanches.

                                        DEBRA
                        I knowher.

                                        DEBRA
                      She called herself Cherry.  We worked 
                      the same corner when I was undercover.  
                      We had coffee together.  She always 
                        ordered hers black.  Like her pimp.
                                (knowingit s lame)
                      She thought that was funny.

                                        DEXTER
                      So you and Cherry were, like, friends?

                                        DEBRA
                        I guess.

    Debra appears shaken, maybe even close to tears.  Dexter has 
    compassion for his sister, but as a semi-sociopath he never 
    knows how to show it.

                                        DEXTER
                                (sincere)
                      You want a hug?

                                        DEBRA
                              (as if)
                        Fuckoff.

    Upset, she turns to go, slips a little, rights herself and 
    walks away.


    LaGuerta has set up a command post halfway up the stands, 
    with a dramatic view of the ice below.  Doakes briefs her.

                        Someone had to be here last night who 
                      saw something.  A rent-a-badge?  A 
                        cleaning crew?  A crack whore in the

                        Unless the Ice Truck Killer abducted 
                      him to gain entry into the arena.

    They turn to see Debra coming up the stairs to join them.

                              (to Debra)
                        It s possible the watchman was in the 
                        wrong place at the wrong time.  That s 
                      why we need to get to his apartment, 
                      see what we can find.

    Debra turns to LaGuerta.  Takes a deep breath...

                        Actually, I was hoping I could hit

    LaGuerta folds her arms, loving this.

                      No.  I want you to stay with Doakes.

    LaGuerta turns to go.  Debra can t believe it.  Doakes is 
    caught in between, but he s a detective first and foremost.

                        Maria.  She s got contacts.

    LaGuerta stops on the stairs and turns back.  After shooting 
    Doakes an annoyed look for putting her on the spot, LaGuerta 
    glares at Debra.  

                                        LAGUERTA

                        Don t come back without information.

    LaGuertaturns and walks away.  Debra gives a small nod of 
    appreciation to Doakes, who nods back.

                      And what s wrong with being a fucking 
                        whore?

    Debra shakes her head.  She can t win.


    CLOSE on an open file with court transcripts and photos of 
    Jeremy Downs.  REVEAL Dexter multitasking: working-out on an 
    exercise bike, eating an egg sandwich, and reading the file 
    at the same time.  When his phone RINGS, he sets down his 
    sandwichbut, still engrossed in the file, takes it with him 
    as he hops off the biketo answer the phone.

                        Hello...

                                                                            INTERCUT:


    Packed with UNIFORM COPS and DETECTIVES, including Dexter,

    with LaGuerta off to the side.

                      As you all know, a night watchman from 
                      the hockey arena s missing.  Till now, 
                      we presumed he was abducted, or worse, 
                      by the Ice Truck Killer.

    Doakes nods to someone offscreen, and a grainy SURVEILLANCE 
    VIDEO starts playing on the HUGE SCREEN behind Doakes.  The 
    tape shows a MAN in a security uniform hauling chopped BODY 
    PARTS across the ice and stacking them in the goalie s net.

                                        SGT. DOAKES
                        However, we searched his apartment and 
                        found a stolen surveillance tape from 
                      the night of the murder.  Chief of 
                        security at the arena confirmed it... 
                      the man you re looking at is Tony 
                        Tucci, the missing night watchman.

    Dexter and Debra watch in shock.  LaGuerta steps up.

                                        LAGUERTA
                        Here s the best part.  Tucci s got a 
                        record.  Pulled a knife at a party in 
                         97.

    LaGuerta nods and the tape stops.  A STILL IMAGE appears on 
    the big screen -- the grinning employee ID photo of Tony 
    Tucci, a simple blue-collar type.

                                        LAGUERTA
                        Ladies and gentleman, I give you Tony 
                        Tucci... the Ice Truck Killer.

                                (whispers to Dexter)
                        Bullshit.

                        Captain Matthews is coordinating with 
                      the FDLEto launch a statewide manhunt 
                      as soon as we get clearances.

                                        DEBRA
                              (out loud to LaGuerta)
                        Does he drive a station wagon?

                                        LAGUERTA
                        Excuse me?

                                        DEBRA
                        Tucci.  What kind of car s he drive?  
                      The last victim was seen getting in --

                                        LAGUERTA 
                        I don t recall asking for questions, 
                        Miss Morgan.  Thank you.
                              (to the room)
                        From this moment forward, all our 
                        resources go into finding this man.  
                        Your individual assignments will be 
                        coming shortly.  That s all for now.

    The briefing breaks and the detectives start buzzing.  Debra 
    stands and turns to Dexter in frustration.  Dexter stares at 
    the projected photo of Tucci.

                                        DEBRA
                      It doesn t make sense.  After being so 
                        careful for so long, why in the hell 
                        would he leave recorded evidence?

    Debra angrily turns to go and brushes past Batista.

                                                                        (CONTINUED)            DEXTER 103   "Popping Cherry"    Final Draft - 06/23/06     29.

                        Excuse me.

    HOLD for a beat on Batista, who was listening to her words, 
    before he heads out with everyone else.  Dexter stays in his 
    seat, staring up at the grinning face of Tony Tucci.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                      Of course, I agree with my sister.  
                      But unlike her, I m not upset.  He s 
                        still out there.  And I m waiting.  
                        Breathless.

    Off his revery --


    Dexter and Debra, both early 20s, stand over a hospital bed.  
    Harry, looking green against the sheets, lies with his eyes 
    closed, hooked up to an IV.A sturdy nurse named MARY -- 
    the one we foreshadowed earlier -- fluffs up his pillows.  
    On her way out, she whispers to Dexter and Debra.

                                        MARY
                        Just try to make him comfortable.  
                        It s about all we can do now.

                                        DEBRA
                              (torn apart)
                        I don t understand.  A week ago the 
                        doctor said he was getting better.

                                        MARY
                                (all-wise)
                      He isgetting better, sweetie.  A body 
                        cannot suffer in sweet repose.

    She pushes a nurse s cart out, past an unconscious OLD 
    PATIENT in the next bed.  Annoyed, Debra calls after Mary.

                                        DEBRA
                        What does that mean?
                              (to Dexter)
                        What the hell s that mean?

                                        DEXTER
                        That she s weird?

    Harry opens his eyes and rolls his head toward his children, 
    as if some invisible hand pushed it from the far side of the 
    pillow.

                                        HARRY
                        Listen you two, I m not gonna be 
                        around much longer.

                        this.  If you fight.

    Debra s grief can be seen in the tears she angrily brushes 
    back.  Dexter holds his pain inside.

                                        HARRY
                        I am fighting, honey.  With every 
                        breath.
                              (to Dexter)
                        When I m gone, I can t stop you... 
                        from being who you are. Sooner or 
                        later, you ll -- need -- to do it.

    Dexter nods, scared.  But Debra has no idea what Harry is 
    talking about.

                                        DEBRA
                      Do what?

                              (to Debra)
                        I never worried about you, Debra.  You 
                      got your mom s spirit.  But Dexter, he 
                        required extra handling.

                                        DEXTER
                                (simply)

                      Yes you can.  If you feel like you re 
                        slipping, you lean on your sister.

                        a better person than you think, Dex.

    As Dexter wonders if that s really true --

                                                                    END FLASHBACK:

    REVEAL Batista closely watching the tape on a TV set in the 
    mostly empty bullpen.  Debra enters with her nose in a FILE.

                        Tucci s hair and fibers.

    She looks at the TV screen to see Tucci holding the victim s 
    WRAPPED TORSO.

                        Ofcoursehis hair and fibers are on

                        fucking peculiar behavior for a genius 
                        serial killer, if you ask me.

    Disgusted, she tosses the file onto a desk.

                        Same as the other bodies.  The killer 
                        used liquid nitrogen to preserve the 
                        tissue.  Give it that bleached look.

                        Yeah, you know how unstable liquid 
                        nitrogen is?  You gotta be a serious 
                      lab rat to mess around with that shit.  
                        Tucci didn t even pass high school 
                        chemistry.

    Intrigued, Debra moves over to Batista, who hasn t taken his 
    eyes off the TV screen the whole time.

    Deb stares at the screen.  As Tucci places the wrapped torso 
    inside the net, he subtly TURNS HIS HEAD as if responding to 
    someone off screen, then adjusts the position of the torso.

    Off her energy --


    Dexter sits inside, shadowing Jeremy.  He watches as Lucas 
    overcomes his fear and starts climbing the chain-link to 
    break into the marsh.  Dexter raises binoculars for a better 
    look.

    LONG-LENS POV

    As Jeremy climbs, his shirt lifts and Dexter spots the GLINT 
    of the skinning knife strapped to Jeremy s hip.

    Debra shows CAPTAIN MATTHEWS the security tape FREEZE FRAMED 
    on Tucci s turned head.

                                        DEBRA
                      See the look on his face?  Like he s 
                        scared.  Like he s got a gun pointed 
                      at him.

                                        CAPTAIN MATTHEWS
                        It s not much to go on, Debra.  A look 
                      off camera?

                                        DEBRA
                        There s more, one of my vice contacts, 
                        Gabrielle, I trust her, and she saw 
                      the victim get into a panel wagon the 
                        night of her death.  That was the last 
                        time anyone saw the victim.

    Debra, on a roll, hands a file to the Captain.

                                        DEBRA
                        I checked Tucci s background report.  
                      He doesn t even owna car.  I m 
                        telling you, there s no fucking way he 
                      can be the Ice Truck Killer.
                                (catching herself)
                        Sir.

    Captain Matthews appears impressed, but circumspect.

                                        CAPTAIN MATTHEWS
                        What s Lieutenant LaGuertathink of

                        I came straight to you, Captain.

                        I gave you a shot in homicide because 
                        I think you can make a halfway decent 
                        detective, but I ll put you right back 
                      on the street if you can t swim in 
                        these waters.  Got it?

                                        DEBRA
                        Yes, sir.

    Captain Matthews turns to go, then pauses --

                                        CAPTAIN MATTHEWS
                        Your fathernever would ve pulled the 
                        shit you just did.

    That hurts.  The Captain exits, leaving Debra chastised.


    CLOSE ON a hypodermic needle filling up with liquid.  The 
    needle slowly rises to face of Mary, who s holding the 
    syringe.  She squirts out the air bubble.  RACK FOCUS to 
    Harry, lying behind her in bed, looking very close to death.

                                        HARRY
                              (very faint)
                        Wait...

    FIND Dexter sitting on the edge of the bed.  Dexter turns to 
    his dying father to see a small spark shining in his eyes.

                                        DEXTER
                        What Dad?

                                        HARRY
                        Don t let her...

    Mary, not hearing Harry (or ignoring him), turns with the 
    needle and gently lifts Harry s frail arm.

                                        MARY
                        Okay, my brave little soldier.  Let s 
                      get this nasty shot over with.

                                        HARRY
                        No... no shot...

    Dexter sees the horror in his father s eyes.  Just before 
    Mary plunges the needle into Harry s raised blue vein, 
    Dexter reaches out and restrains her arm.

                                        DEXTER
                        Wait.

    In SLOW MOTION, Mary s eyes snap to Dexter and fix him with 
    a look of cold rage.  It mirrors the rage we watched earlier 
    in Jeremy s eyes.  Dexter registers the look, before we 
    RESUME NORMAL SPEED and Mary breaks out a granola smile.

                                        MARY
                        What is it, honey?

                                        DEXTER
                      He doesn t want the shot.

                                        MARY
                        Your father is very sick.  He s in a 
                      lot of pain.

    She holds up the needle, and a melodramatic SHAFT OF LIGHT 
    from the window shines through it like her own Holy Grail.

                                        MARY
                      He needs a shot.

    Harry s hand slowly reaches for Dexter s hand and gives it a 
    squeeze.  Dexter looks down at his frail father, fighting 
    his way up through the fog.

                                        HARRY
                        I want... pain.

    Dexter smiles and looks at Mary.

                                        DEXTER
                      He wants pain.

    Mary forces down a savage roar and replaces it with a 
    petulant shake of her head.

                                        MARY
                        I ll have to tell the doctor.He 
                        won t be happy that you re refusing 
                        your medication.

    She turns on her heels and sails out into the hallway like 
    some large and deadly bird.  Dexter looks back at Harry.

                                        HARRY
                        You... can tell.

                                        DEXTER
                        About the nurse?  Yeah.  She s like 
                      me.  How could youtell?

                                        HARRY
                      She gives... too much...
                              (he gasps in pain and 
                                closes his eyes)
                        ...too much morphine.  It s making me 
                        worse.

    Harry swivels his head and nods at the other bed.  Dexter 
    looks over -- and we reveal for the first time that it s 
    EMPTY.  The old patient gone.  Dexter turns back to Harry.

                                        DEXTER
                        What should I do?

    Harry gives Dexter s hand a squeeze.

                                        HARRY
                        Stop her.

                      I m going out tonight with the guys,

                        Yeah, man.  Sounds good.

    McNamara slips away.  As Doakes turns to the TV, now showing 
    the videotape of Tucci hauling body parts across the ice --            DEXTER 103   "Popping Cherry"    Final Draft - 06/23/06     44.




    Rita, working behind the front desk, inserts a pair of flat 
    hotel keys into a folder and hands it to a YOUNG COUPLE with 
    a smile.

                        Rita?  This is Mr. Curtis.  Are you 
                        coming to pick up Astor?

    Rita speaks low and turns away from the lobby for privacy.

                                        RITA
                      No, a friend of mine s picking her up.  
                        Denise.  She s not there?

                        Afraid not.  But your daughter is.

                      Oh no.  I don t have a car.  How s 
                        Astor?

    Rita s eyes fill with tears.  She feels like the worst mom.

                                        TEACHER S VOICE
                        She s just fine, but we can t keep her

    Dexter runs through the house with a child under each arm, 
    like he s a twin-engine airplane.  Astor doesn t look any 
    worse for the wear.  Dexter sets them down in the kitchen.

                      Now Master Cody, let s see what we can 
                      do about that splinter.  Sit.

    Cody sits at the kitchen table.  Dexter pulls a washcloth 
    from his pocket and unrolls it to reveal tweezers, a needle, 
    cotton, a Band Aid -- echoes of his kill tools.  Dexter 
    takes Cody s hand and gently touches his RED FINGER TIP.

                                        DEXTER
                        It s a deep one.  Might sting a bit, 
                      but the magical Splinter Fairy will 
                        soon make you forget all about it.

    Dexter tries to get hold of the splinter with the tweezers.

                                        ASTOR
                        Who s the magical Splinter Fairy?

                                        DEXTER
                        Second cousin of the Tooth Fairy.  She 
                        leaves candy if you put your splinter 
                        under your pillow at night.

    In the background, Rita enters the house with groceries.

                                        CODY
                        I know there s no Tooth Fairy.  She s 
                        make believe, like the Boogey Man.

                                (entering)
                      Hi babies.

    The kids turn to say hello.  With Cody distracted, Dexter 
    yanks the splinter free.  Cody jumps.

                                        CODY
                      Ow!

    Dexter holds up the gnarly SPLINTER, with a drop of blood.

                                        DEXTER
                        You re right Cody, no such thing as 
                      the Boogey Man.  But the Splinter 
                        Fairy?  She s the real deal.

    Big crocodile tears start brimming in Cody s eyes.

                                        CODY
                        Will she still leave candy if I cry?

    Dexter opens his arms and Cody slips into them, burying his 
    head in Dexter s shoulder.  As Dexter soothes him --

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                      If I had a heart, it might be breaking

    Rita, hugging Astor now under her arm, smiles at this man 
    taking care of her son.  They almost look like a normal 
    family.  Well, almost.


    McNamara turns off the engine and shuts off the headlights.  
    Doakes rides shotgun with McNamara s two beefy cop friends 
    from the cemetery sitting in back.

                        This is it.

    McNamara reaches under his seat, produces four rubber CLOWN 
    MASKS, and starts passing them around.  Doakes looks down at 
    the goofy grinning mask in his hands.

    McNamara pulls abrown-bag bottlefrom his jacket and takes 
    a shot.

    As McNamara passes the bottleto the backseat, Doakes turns 
    to see one of the cops has donned his clown mask.  It s an 
    eerie effect.  Doakes turns to McNamara.

    Its shabby contents include a ping pongtable with a sagging 
    net, a weathered foosballtable, and an donated community TV 
    bolted high in the corner of the room, playing a fuzzy MUSIC 
    VIDEO.

    On the far side of the rec room, we see Jeremy playing a 
    1980sarcade machine, like Centipede, with his back to us.

    CLOSE on Jeremy.  As he struggles with the game, the LIGHTS 
    and TV go out, plunging the room into shadows and darkness.  
    Jeremy turns around, more bored than scared.

                                        JEREMY
                        Quit fucking around!  Turn on the

    Beat.  Jeremy starts feeling a little nervous.  He steps 
    away from the machine, deeper into the room, his eyes 
    searching.

                                        JEREMY
                        Come on, man.  Turn on the fucking --

    From seemingly nowhere, a FAMILIAR SHADOW blindsidesJeremy, 
    who lets out a reflexive grunt, and pile-drives him into a 
    column.  REVEAL Dexter, the real Boogey Man, holding Jeremy 
    firmly from behind.  He leans close, whispers menacingly.

                                        DEXTER
                        You re mine now.

                        Silence.

    Dexter SLAMS his body into Jeremy, flattening the boy s face 
    against the column, so that he can pull the SYRINGE from his 
    jacket pocket.  As he raises it to Jeremy s neck --

                                        JEREMY

                        killed the last guy who raped me.

    Shocked, Dexter pauses with the needle hovering.

    Jeremy, afraid, doesn t say anything.  Dexter lowers the 
    syringe with one hand and forcefully spins Jeremy around 
    with the other, so he s looking into his eyes.  No time for 
    bullshit here.

                      you were fifteen?

    Jeremy, his face lit by a SHAFT OF LIGHT beaming through a 
    high window, struggles valiantly not to cry.

                                        DEXTER
                      Why didn t you tell someone?

                        Would you?  He fucked me and I killed 
                      him and if you try I ll kill you, too.

    Despite Jeremy s best effort, tears start rolling down his 
    face.  Dexter stares at his victim with sudden realization.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        I understand now.  Why didn t I see it 
                        before?  Jeremy didn t murder that boy 
                        four years ago...

    Jeremy suddenly TRANSFORMS into TeenageDexter, and for an 
    instant, Dexter holds his own young life in his hands.

                        Just like I do.

    Young Dexter TRANSFORMS BACK to Jeremy.  Dexter, rattled, 
    slides the lethal syringe into his pocket without Jeremy 
    ever seeing it.  He doesn t, however, loosen his grip around 
    the kid s neck.

                                        DEXTER

    Dexter lets go of Jeremy and unzips his backpack.  As Dexter 
    digs for his wallet, Jeremy watches Dexter, trying to figure 
    out who this guy is and what he s about.  

                                                                        (CONTINUED)            DEXTER 103   "Popping Cherry"    Final Draft - 06/23/06     51.

    Dexter finds his wallet, tosses the backpack to Jeremy, and 
    walks out of the room.  Jeremy can t believe it.


    Jeremy catches up to Dexter about to leave the building and 
    calls after him.

                      Is that all?

    Dexter stops and turns back to Jeremy.  An overhead LAMP 
    holds them both in a pool of light, with the rest of the 
    area fading dramatically into darkness.

                                        DEXTER
                      You want more?

    Jeremy nervously shakes his head no.  Dexter stares at him 
    for a beat.

                        That boy who raped you four years ago.  
                      Did he deserve to die?

    Jeremy thinks and then nods with unerring certainty.

                                        JEREMY
                        Yeah... he did.

                                        DEXTER
                        Well, the boy last night didn t.  
                        Remember that.  It might save your 
                        life one day.

    With that, the Boogey Man turns to go.  As he walks INTO 
    CAMERA, showing no emotion --

                                                                            FLASHBACK:


    The back kitchendoor opens and Mary enters, dressed in her 
    hospital wear.  She deadbolts the door behind her, sets down 
    her purse, and looks around.

                                        MARY
                      Mr. Tinker?  Where are you, Mr. 
                        Tinker?

    She hears a faraway MEOW.

                                        MARY
                      Mr. Tinker?

                                                                        (CONTINUED)            DEXTER 103   "Popping Cherry"    Final Draft - 06/23/06     52.

    Mary walks through the dark, shadowy kitchen.  It s a sweet 
    place really, full of cute and craftsy knickknacks, but they 
    only add to the building sense of dread.  Mary hears another 
    MEOW.

                                        MARY
                      Are you hiding behind the couch again, 
                      Mr. Tinker Stinker?

    She walks toward the living room and sees --

    MARY S POV

    Every conceivable inch of the living room, from floor to 
    ceiling and everything between, is covered in PAINTER S 
    PLASTIC.  The clear polyethylene film makes everything in 
    the room appear both shiny and blurry, like a dream of a 
    room.  Sitting atop the plastic-covered couchis MR. TINKER, 
    who MEOWS.

    MARY

    Only has a confused and horrified beat to take all of this 
    in -- before twentysomething Dexter MATERIALIZES from the 
    shadows behind her.  But Mary hears him and turns to see 
    Dexter wearing a surgical mask, gloves and cap, and holding 
    up a SYRINGE, just like the one shewas using on Harry.

    There s a surprised, awkward beat -- before Dexter plunges 
    the needle into Mary s neck.  But before he can press the 
    plunger, the big-boned Mary twists freeand yanks the needle 
    from her neck. 

    The terrified Mary opens her mouth to scream -- but Dexter 
    tackles her to the ground before she can make a sound and 
    covers her mouth with his hand.  As the two awkwardly roll 
    around on the plastic --

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        Things were a little messy in the 
                        beginning.  Hey, perfecting a new 
                        craft takes time.  But I was trained 
                        well.  Those who witnessed my early 
                        stumbles never had a chance to tell.

    Unable to get Mary under control, Dexter, palm still firmly 
    over her mouth, finally grabs her head with both hands and 
    SLAMS it into the floor.  ONCE.  TWICE.  BLACK.            DEXTER 103   "Popping Cherry"    Final Draft - 06/23/06     53.



    FADE FROM BLACK - A SHORT TIME LATER4949

    Mary stirs awake to find herself lying naked on her plastic-
    covered dining table, wrapped tightly in clearplastic that 
    straps her arms to her side.  Her mouth is stuffed with 
    thick wads of white gauze.

    Wide eyed, Mary rotates her head to see Dexter sitting on a 
    dining room chair in surgical wear, flipping through a 
    frilly photo album full of OBITS FOR ELDERLY PATIENTS.

                                        DEXTER
                        I ve been reading through your photo 
                        album.  Hope you don t mind.

    Panicked, she tries to speak, but it sounds like GRUNTS with 
    the gauze in her mouth.  Dexter indicates the album.

                                        DEXTER
                      Are all your victims in here?
                                (offher GRUNTS)
                      I m sorry, let me help you with that.

    Dexter starts to remove the gauze, then pauses, remembering 
    something.  He pulls the SKINNING KNIFE from his youth out 
    of his pocket and holds it close to her face.

                                        DEXTER
                        Scream.  And lose a tongue.

    He removes the gauze.  Mary bursts into tears.

                                        MARY
                        I helped them, all of them... They 
                        were sick... I took away their pain.

                                        DEXTER
                                (smiles)
                          I understand.

    Dexter stuffs the gauze back into her mouth.

                                        DEXTER
                      And now it s time to take away your
                        pain.  I ve been waiting a very long 
                        time for this.

    Mary launches into a primal struggle against her bonds but 
    it s useless.  Dexter secured her well.  He raises his knife 
    and looks over her body in anticipation, trying to decide 
    where to begin.  PUSH INTO Dexter.  As he makes his first 
    cut, blood spurts onto his chest.  He looks down.  That was 
    unexpected.

                      It was messier than I anticipated, but 
                        still a special day.  The Nurse was my 
                        first playmate--and I ll always be 
                        grateful to her for opening up so many 
                        magnificent new doors for me.

    As Dexter speaks, PAN to Mr. Tinker watching impassively 
    from atop theplastic-wrapped couch.  Offthe cat sMEOW --


    Twentysomething Debra bursts from the hospital room pushing 
    Harry in a wheelchair, his color and strength back again.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                      But of course it was really Harry, 
                        wise and wonderful Harry, who paved 
                      the road to my salvation.

    A jubilant Debra spins Harry in a circle, laughing.

                                        HARRY
                      For God s sake, Debra.  You re gonna 
                      put me right back in the hospital.

    Dexter steps out of the hospital room.  He leans against the 
    doorway and smiles, watching his father and sister together.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        With the Nurse put down, Harry lived 
                        another year before hardening arteries 
                        squeezed the last bit of life from 
                        him.  But his lessons never failed me.

                                                                    END FLASHBACK:


    The down-low neighborhood joint we established on Calle 
    Ocho.  LaGuerta sits on wooden chairs with a group of OLD 
    CUBAN MEN, smoking hand-rolled cigars and speaking Spanish.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                      He taught me that none of us are who we 
                        appear to be on the outside.  But we 
                        must maintain appearances to survive.

    LaGuerta laughs with the old men.  Just one of the guys.  In 
    the corner, nobody even notices the big TV with a NEWSCAST
    of LaGuerta talking about the Ice Truck Killer.
