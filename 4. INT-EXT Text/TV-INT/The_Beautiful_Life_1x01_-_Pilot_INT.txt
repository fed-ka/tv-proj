      FLASHBULBS, THROBBING BEATS, and of course, a parade of 
      gorgeous MODELS, with long legs and narrow hips, strutting 
      their way to the end of a catwalk.  We find RAINA, a fresh 
      young model with the face of an angel, making her way towards 
      us, PAST the designer, PHILLIP LIM, seated in the CELEBRITY 
      ROW, along the side of the stage.  Raina is practically 
      bubbling over with sprite enthusiasm as the crowd applauds 
      what they see.  And even with her wild makeup and girlish 
      smile, Raina s big doe eyes express a rich depth and a 
      glimpse at the old soul hiding behind them.

      We follow Raina, flashbulbs popping with every step, as she 
      exits the runway and hurries backstage...   


      Skin everywhere, and no time for modesty.  Lounging in a 
      chair in front of a mirror is the Alpha-male-model, an 
      impossibly good looking guy named KAI.

                    You realize we re nothing but 
                      accessories tonight, right?  

      Off to the side, we find EGAN, angular, with a wild head of 
      hair, and his perpetual side-kick, ISAAC, black, from London, 
      with a Lenny Kravitz vibe, taking in the room full of girls, 
      scrambling around in various stages of undress.

      A HALF NAKED MODEL bends over, right between Isaac and Egan.

      Raina scurries up, still buzzing from the catwalk...

                                  RAINA
                    Oh my God, you guys won t believe

                    crushed it out there.

                    Chloe, Gabriel, Kai, Marissa! 

      A RUNWAY COORDINATOR, with headset and clipboard, zips up--

                                  RUNWAY COORDINATOR (CONT D)
                    I need everyone in line for the 
                    finale in twelve minutes.  

      The Coordinator gives a once over to GABRIEL, 19, a great 
      looking kid, but he s obviously sketched out on something.

                                  RUNWAY COORDINATOR (CONT D)
                    Gabriel.  Who cut your hair?

                                    GABRIEL
                    I did.  Cool, right?

                                  RUNWAY COORDINATOR
                    No, not cool.  You so much as trim 
                    the hair on your ass, you re in 
                    breech of contract.
                          (to a nearby  hair girl )
                      Christine, fix this.

      Christine pulls Gabriel away.  Isaac and Egan take note.

                                  ISAAC
                    Man, that boy is tweaked.

      The Coordinator hears that, steps over to Egan, Issac, and 
      Raina.   "THE BEAUTIFUL LIFE"      Network Draft      2/8/2009    3.

                    I think he means us, E.  

      The Coordinator shoots them a look.

      Egan snags a bottle of Champagne from a nearby dressing 
      table.  And as Egan, Raina and Isaac hustle out of the way...


      The iconic and pricey Central Park restaurant is filled to 
      capacity with a mix of well heeled New Yorkers and wide eyed 
      tourists.  PICK UP on a BELEAGUERED BLONDE WAITRESS, hustling 
      her way through the busy restaurant.

                                  MAN S VOICE
                    Waitress?

      The harried Waitress spins around to face SIMON TISDALE, 
      30's, a slight, expertly coiffed man in black framed glasses, 
      seated with his Male Companion.

                                  SIMON
                    Our Peakytoe Crabcakes?

      The Waitress speaks with the THICK EASTERN EUROPEAN ACCENT of 
      a recent immigrant.

                                  WAITRESS
                    Of course.  Just let me drop this 
                    check off quickly.

                                  SIMON
                    I m not sure the word  quickly  means 
                    the same thing in your language as it 
                    does in ours.

      The deeply weeded Waitress exhales, turns and rushes over to 
      a small table near the kitchen, where the DRESSED DOWN, BLUE 
      COLLAR ANDREWS FAMILY stares at the remnants of a single 
      dessert they all obviously shared, some time ago...    "THE BEAUTIFUL LIFE"      Network Draft      2/8/2009    4.



                                  WAITRESS
                    Here you are sir, thank you very 
                    much for your patience tonight.

      The Waitress sets the check down in front of BILL ANDREWS, a 
      Mack Truck of a man, who grumbles something inaudible and 
      unpleasant.  The Waitress knows she s blown it, but offers 
      her best conciliatory smile anyway, which is kindly returned 
      by the STRIKING YOUNG MAN at the table, CHRIS ANDREWS, 18, 
      square jawed and wholesome, with sturdy shoulders and a 
      disarming smile.

                                  CHRIS
                    Dinner was terrific.

      The Waitress takes a moment to appreciate Chris  gesture 
      before rushing back to her demanding customers.  KAREN, the 
      dutiful and observant wife and mother to the Andrews clan, 
      reaches into her purse and pulls out a laminated card.

                                  KAREN
                    Need the tip chart?

                                  BILL
                    Two hour wait for an over cooked 
                    Pork Chop?  I don t think so. 

      Bill proceeds to count out exact change for the tab, as 
      DANIELLE ANDREWS, 12, whip smart, spirited, and proudly 
      sporting a lobby-fresh  WICKED  sweatshirt, pipes up.

                                  DANIELLE
                    You can t just stiff her, dad, 
                    that s totally embarrassing.  

                                  KAREN
                      Danielle...

                                  BILL
                    You have any idea how much this 
                    little vacation has cost this family?  
                    How  bout a little gratitude?

      Chris is a pro at diffusing this particular brand of family 
      tension.

                                  CHRIS
                    Thanks for everything, dad.  It s been 
                    a great week.

      Danielle glares over at her big brother, but he gives her a 
      firm look of his own that says: follow my lead.  After a 
      minor huff, Danielle crosses her arms, and manages:   "THE BEAUTIFUL LIFE"      Network Draft      2/8/2009    5.



                                  DANIELLE
                    Thanks.

      Bill grunts something that kinda sounds like  you re welcome. 


      MARISSA, a confident, ambitious model, applies finishing 
      touches to her makeup in the mirror.  As the fussers finish 
      their fussing over Kai, seated next to her...

                    Where the hell is Sonja?  She s 
                    wearing Phillip s signature piece 
                    and he s asking for final touches.

                                  KAI
                    Haven t seen her.

                          (a little mischief)
                    Anyone check the bathroom?

      The Coordinator moves off, Kai looks over at Marissa in the 
      mirror, knows her game...

                                    MARISSA (CONT D)
                    What, Kai?

                                  KAI
                    Nothing.  Looking good, Marissa.

                    Like you d know...


      In a tiny bathroom we find SONJA, a beautiful veteran of the 
      high fashion circuit, desperately trying to pull a bold and 
      dramatic designer dress up across her bust line.  It won t 
      go.  She looks panicked.  A POUNDING ON THE DOOR.

                    Give me three minutes!

                                  RUNWAY COORDINATOR (O.S.)
                    You have ten seconds-- don t make 
                    me break down this door!

                                  SONJA
                    All right!  All right!

      Sonja takes a good, hard look in the mirror.

                                  SONJA (CONT D)
                    You can do this.

      And as she sucks in her breath, makes one last attempt to 
      squeeze into that dress--


      The Andrews family makes its way to the exit.  But just as 
      they reach the doors, Chris holds up.

                                  CHRIS
                    I m gonna run to the restroom, meet 
                    you out there. 

                                  BILL
                    Hurry up, cabbies start the meter the 
                    second they pull over.

      As his father heads out the door, Chris gives his little 
      sister a soothing wink before heading to the restroom.  But 
      as soon as he arrives at the MEN S ROOM DOOR, Chris glances 
      back to make sure his family is safely out of sight, and 
      doubles back towards the restaurant. 

      OVER AT THE TABLE the Immigrant Waitress counts out the cash.  
      When she realizes there s no tip, her eyes well with tears.

                                  CHRIS (O.S.)
                    Excuse me.

      The Waitress turns to see Chris standing behind her, holding 
      out a twenty dollar bill.

                                  CHRIS (CONT D)
                    My pop just realized he forgot to 
                    add in your tip.  Here you go.

      The Waitress looks up at Chris, amazed at his simple 
      kindness.  He doesn t want to make a big deal out of it.   "THE BEAUTIFUL LIFE"      Network Draft      2/8/2009    7.



                                  CHRIS (CONT D)
                    Have a good night.

                          (snapping his fingers)
                      Waitress-- you do understand 
                    English, don t you?

      Chris and the Waitress turn to see Simon, fed up with the 
      crappy service, sniping in their direction.

                                  SIMON (CONT D)
                    Our crab cakes?

                    Of course.  It s my fault, I m sorry.

      And as the Waitress rushes off to the kitchen...

                    Look, I don t know what your job 
                    is, buddy, but walk a mile in her

                    In those shoes, you re damn right.

      Chris just shakes his head, turns to leave.  Simon can t help 
      but crack a smile, calls after him...

                                  SIMON (CONT D)
                    Hey, Clark Kent.

      Chris turns as Simon stands, walks over, does a spin around 
      Chris, sizing him up.  Chris postures, ready for a fight.

      Egan and Isaac pass the bottle of Champagne between them as 
      the A-list models gear up for the finale.  Raina watches the 
      action, rapt with excitement.

      A pixie-faced MODEL approaches Egan.

                    Step into my office...

      Egan hands the Champagne bottle to Isaac, leads the Pixie 
      over to a corner, where Raina can see Egan pull a small bag 
      of white powder out of his pocket, spoon out a bump for the

      with a kiss on the cheek.  Isaac offers Raina the Champagne--

                    It s not my fault!

      WHIP PAN to SONJA, in a thong and little else, holding the 
      spectacular finale dress, she couldn t fit into.  She s 
      flanked by the Runway Coordinator as they come up on VIVIENNE 
      HUGHES, master seamstress and dress builder, who s pinning 
      back a model s dress nearby with the help of two assistants.  

                                  RUNWAY COORDINATOR
                    Vivienne, we have an emergency.  
                    Sonja s dress doesn t fit.

                                  SONJA
                    You must have measured wrong.  It s 
                    the only explanation.

      Vivienne glares at Sonja, takes the dress. 

                                  VIVIENNE
                    Not the only one.

      They arrive at DESIGNER PHILLIP LIM, who does his best to 
      stay cool under the circumstances.

                                  PHILIP LIM
                          (to the seamstress)
                    Is there anything we can do?

                                  VIVIENNE
                    Turn a size zero into a size 2 in 
                    under two minutes?  

      Marissa steps up...

                                    MARISSA
                    I m a size zero.

      Phillip looks at Marissa, it s an option.  Sonja stares daggers.

                                  RUNWAY COORDINATOR
                          (checks his watch)
                    It s your call, Mr. Lim.

      A beat.  Everyone is hushed.  Phillip scans the room full of 
      hopeful models until his eyes land on...

                                  PHILIP LIM
                    Her.

      He s looking directly at RAINA.  Marissa s face falls, as 
      Sonja dashes off, humiliated.   "THE BEAUTIFUL LIFE"      Network Draft      2/8/2009    10.

                    Hair!  Make up!  
                          (the dress she s in)
                    Get that off, get this on.  We have 
                    ninety seconds people!  Let s go, 
                    let s go!

      Raina s eyes go wide as a veritable Beauty Pit Crew instantly 
      descends on Raina, stripping, pinning, brushing, spraying... 
      And off Raina, terrified and exhilarated, we...

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Kai, Marissa, and the rest of the A-list models as they 
      sashay down the runway, turn, and disappear the way they 
      came.     "THE BEAUTIFUL LIFE"      Network Draft      2/8/2009    11.


      After the last model crosses backstage, the audience applauds 
      what appears to be the end of the show, when suddenly, the 
      MUSIC STOPS, and the lights BLACK OUT.  

      A beat later, the roar of an AIR RAID SIREN shakes the room, 
      and miniature Kleig lights zip back and forth across the 
      stage.  The energy in the place LEAPS a dozen notches, as the 
      curtains part, and a spot light hits the threshold, 
        revealing...

      RAINA -- HAIR TEASED TO THE SKY, A DRAMATIC RAINBOW OF MAKE-
      UP SPLASHED ACROSS HER FLAWLESS FACE, eyes forward, 
      expression frozen in a dramatic thousand mile stare.  

      A DRIVING BEAT KICKS IN and joins the AIR RAID SIREN, and 
      just at the right moment, in lock step, Raina begins STOMPING 
      HER WAY down the catwalk, seizing the moment for all it s 
      worth.  THE CROWD GOES CRAZY, leaps to its feet, and it s 
      obvious to everyone watching, a star is born.  

      And as Raina marches down the runway in perfect synch with 
      the music, the lights, and the roaring applause, we...

                                                                      LAUNCH INTO:

                                        ACT TWO

      FADE IN:


      Spacious and modern.  FRAMED ADS and MAGAZINE COVERS line the 
      walls, many are of Sonja, one more recent and more prominent 
      one is of KAI...  The waiting area is filled with female 
      MODELS, all dressed down in flats and minimal makeup, most of 
      whom are staring at, and whispering about... RAINA, who 
      fidgets in her chair, uncomfortable with the attention. 

                                  GIRL S VOICE
                    Get used to it.

      Raina looks over to see Marissa, perched nearby. 

                                  RAINA
                    Used to what?

                                    MARISSA
                    Every model in New York hating you.  
                    You re having your  moment. 

                                  RAINA
                    I am? 

                                    MARISSA
                    Uh, yeah.  Might be time to drop 
                    the  gee whiz  act.

      On that, THE DOUBLE DOORS fly open and SIMON bursts into the 
      lobby. 

                                  SIMON
                    Marissa, you're up.  C'mon, c'mon, 
                    Franco is totally jetlagged, you do not 
                    want to keep him waiting.

                                  RAINA
                    Good luck.

      Marissa gives Raina a look as she heads back with Simon.  
      After they disappear behind the doors, Raina looks around at 
      the other models, staring daggers at her.  Decides she s had 
      enough catty scrutiny, and moves over to the window sill, 
      leans against the wall, looks down to the city below... 

      THE ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN and CHRIS and his FAMILY step into 
      the lobby.  Danielle takes it all in, like Dorothy stepping 
      into a Technicolor OZ.     "THE BEAUTIFUL LIFE"      Network Draft      2/8/2009    13.



                                  DANIELLE
                    This is by far the coolest thing 
                    we ve done in New York.  Way cooler 
                    than Wicked...

      Bill and Karen look up at all the half-naked photos of young 
      men and women that line the walls, clearly uncomfortable.

                                  CHRIS
                    You guys wait here.

      Danielle, Karen, and Bill shuffle over to the windows.  
      Danielle steps up to Raina.

                                  DANIELLE
                    Are you a model?

      Raina takes a beat before turning from the window to look at 
      Danielle, whose eyes are full of stars.  Then, owning it, 
      proudly:

                                  RAINA
                    Yeah, I am.

                                  DANIELLE
                    I m Danielle.  That s my brother, 
                    Chris.  He s gonna be a model, too.

      RAINA looks over at Chris as he checks in with the 
      Receptionist, handing over Simon s business card to confirm 
      his appointment.  As the Receptionist begins speaking into 
      her headset, Chris looks back to his sister, with a hopeful 
      shrug.  Raina can t help but smile at his easy charm...  At 
      that moment, the

      ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN and,

      SONJA storms into the lobby, a model on a mission, not 
      stopping to acknowledge the other models, the receptionists, 
      and least of all Raina, as she barrels through the double 
      doors into the back office.  Danielle matches Sonja to her 
      photographs lining the walls.

                    Yeah.  It was.

      It's a much faster pace back here with ASSISTANTS clamoring 
      about, answering phones, pulling Zed cards from the wall.  

      At a large circular desk in the center of the room is CLAUDIA 
      DIMETEO, the agency owner, a fiery, former 80 s Supermodel, 
      barking into her headset.  Behind the desk is a series of 
      Vintage VOGUE, and ELLE COVERS featuring Claudia, back in the 
      day. 

                                    CLAUDIA
                    Why wasn t Celine in the package for 
                    Anna Sui?!  I need her book over there 
                    now--

                                  GIRL S VOICE
                    Claudia!

      Claudia looks up to see Sonja, pissed, bee-lining for her.  

                                    CLAUDIA
                    Son of a bitch.

      Claudia is expert at dealing with irrational models, she 
      practically invented the category.  She forces a smile as she 
      takes off her headset, it doesn t look natural on her.

                                    CLAUDIA (CONT D)
                    Sonja, sweetheart, how are you?

                                  SONJA
                    Why wasn t I called in for this job?  

                                    CLAUDIA
                    Honey, they re looking for an 
                    unknown, I didn t want to waste 
                    your time.  

                                  SONJA
                    No one knows what they re looking 
                    for until it walks through the door, 
                    that s what you taught me.

                    Calvin Klein would be the exception 
                    to that rule.  It s a brand new line 
                    of sheath wear and Franco was very 
                    specific about wanting a fresh face 
                    for the campaign.     "THE BEAUTIFUL LIFE"      Network Draft      2/8/2009    15.



                                  SONJA
                    Franco Falcone is shooting this?  I m 
                    the reason Franco even has a career-- 

      At that, the door to the conference room opens, and out steps 
      Marissa and Simon.  Marissa can see Sonja s fragile state, 
      can t help but throw one more kick in...

                                    MARISSA
                          (so sad)
                    Sonja, you re back to doing cattle 
                    calls?

      Sonja s had enough.  She marches past Marissa and Simon, into 
      the conference room, shuts the door behind her.  Simon looks 
      at Claudia.

                                  SIMON
                    Should I--

                                    CLAUDIA
                    No.  If this is the way she wants 
                    to go out, better to just stand 
                    back and let her do it.

      Off a faux-concerned Marissa...


      FRANCO FALCONE, chain smoking Euro-trash photographer, sits, 
      feet kicked up on the conference table, a pile of Zed cards 
      in front of him.  A handful of agency suits flank him.  He 
      doesn t look up from the photo of Marissa in his hand.

                                  FRANCO
                    Let s put this girl on avail.  But 
                    call Vivienne to verify her 
                      measurements.  That dress has to 
                    fit like second skin.

                    I just stepped out of a meeting with

                    And you did not call me?  I am very 
                    wounded.

                                  SONJA
                    My schedule has been insane, you 
                    know how it is.  I hear you re 
                    doing Calvin s latest?

                                  FRANCO
                    You have good ears.

                          (touching the dress)
                    This must be the piece?

                                  FRANCO
                    The one and only, as you say.  But 
                    come this time next season, every 
                    teenager in the free world will be 
                    wearing it.  
                          (Sonja scrutinizes the dress)
                    What do you think?

                                  SONJA
                    I d say it s definitely missing 
                      something.

                                  FRANCO
                    And what is that?

                                  SONJA
                    Me.

      And as Sonja holds the dress up to herself, making a play...


      Danielle talks to Raina by the window.

                                  RAINA
                    It s no problem.  Your sister was 
                    keeping me company.  I always get 
                    nervous before a look-see.  

                                  CHRIS
                    What s a look-see?

                                  RAINA
                     Look?   See? 

      Raina points two fingers at her two eyes, then back at his, 
      he still doesn t get it-- 

                                  RAINA (CONT D)
                    You re on one. 
                          (then)
                    Mind if I make a suggestion?  

      Raina steps up to him, reaches her hands over his shoulders, 
      musses up Chris  hair, it s a little close for comfort...    "THE BEAUTIFUL LIFE"      Network Draft      2/8/2009    18.



                                  RAINA (CONT D)
                    I m Raina.

      Raina un-tucks his well-worn flannel shirt, thinks better of 
      it, and tucks one half of it back in to expose his belt.

                                  CHRIS
                    Uh.  Chris...

      BILL CLEARS HIS THROAT as he and Karen walk up.

                                  BILL
                    How long this gonna take?  I wanna 
                    get to the airport early.  

                                  CHRIS
                    Not sure.  They told me to wait here.  

      Simon comes out of the double doors.  Looks at Marissa, 
      completely ignores Chris.

                                  SIMON
                    Raina, lets go. 

      Simon stands there at the door as Raina collects her stuff.

                                  SIMON (CONT D)
                    Leave all that.

                                  DANIELLE
                    We ll watch it for you.

                                  CHRIS
                          (as Raina takes a breath)
                    Good luck.

      And as Raina heads through the door, Simon finally looks at 
      Chris.

                                  SIMON
                    You too, Farm Boy.  Follow me.

      Simon turns back, disappears behind the doors.  Chris looks 
      at his family, who give him a  you heard him-- GO!  look.  
      And as Chris chases after them...


      Simon marches through the main room with Raina, as Chris hustles 
      to catch up.    "THE BEAUTIFUL LIFE"      Network Draft      2/8/2009    19.



                                  SIMON
                    Heard you brought the house down last 
                    night.  The whole town s buzzing.

                                  RAINA
                    Just a lucky break.

      Up ahead, they see Sonja coming out of the conference room, 
      air kissing Franco.  

                                  SIMON
                    Not for Sonja.  

      Head high and working it, Sonja struts right past Claudia s 
      desk, past Simon, Raina, and Chris...  And as they arrive at 
      the conference room door, Simon gives Raina a once over. 

                                  SIMON (CONT D)
                    Okay, Raina, nice and confident, 
                    lots of energy...

      And with that Simon opens the door, looks to Chris.

                                  SIMON (CONT D)
                    You wait here.  Don t speak.  

      With that, Simon follows Raina into the  look-see,  and we 
      stay with Chris, his back to the wall, watching the flurry of 
      assistants chasing down Comps and Zeds.  About twenty feet 
      away, he watches Claudia launch into a phone-fit.

                                    CLAUDIA
                          (into headset)
                    A verbal contract is still a 
                    contract, Aaron...  You try it and 
                    I ll have our lawyers down your 
                    throat so fast you ll be eating 
                    through your ass the rest of your 
                    miserable life...  No, you listen to 
                    me-- poach this girl away from Focus 
                    Models, and the only picture you ll 
                    be seeing of her is on the back of a 
                    goddamn Milk Carton!

      And as Claudia slams the phone down, the conference room door 
      swings open, and Simon and Raina exit, nearly as quickly as 
      they entered.  Chris snaps out of his Claudia-trance.

                                  CHRIS
                    That s it?  How d it go?

                                  SIMON
                    They loved her.     "THE BEAUTIFUL LIFE"      Network Draft      2/8/2009    20.



                                  RAINA
                    How do you know?

                                  SIMON
                    Because everyone loves the next Big 
                    Thing. 
                          (to Chris)
                    Come on.

      And as Simon drags Chris off, Chris looks to Raina...

                                  CHRIS
                    See you later?

      Raina beems, then turns for the lobby, but not before taking 
      one more glance over her shoulder for Chris...

      PICK UP ON SIMON, LEADING CHRIS TO... Claudia, who s in no 
      mood from the events of the day.

                                  SIMON
                    Claudia, this is Christopher.  The 
                    boy I told you about.

                                  CHRIS
                    Actually it s just Chris.  Only my 
                    mom calls me--

                                    CLAUDIA
                    Push your hair back.
                          (Chris does as he s told)
                    Strong hairline.  Good bone 
                      structure.  Do you have a book?
                          (off Chris)
                    Any pictures I can look at?

                                  CHRIS
                          (beat)
                    My sister s got some from a photo 
                    booth at the Statue of Liberty.

                                    CLAUDIA
                          (to Simon)
                    Are you kidding with this?

                                  SIMON
                          (to Chris)
                    Go stand over there and wait for me.

      Chris shrugs, heads back to his spot along the wall.  Once 
      he s out of ear shot, Simon leans in to Claudia.   "THE BEAUTIFUL LIFE"      Network Draft      2/8/2009    21.



                                  SIMON (CONT D)
                    I know he s green--

                                    CLAUDIA
                    Green?  That kid s Kermit the Frog.

                                  SIMON
                    Let me order a few test shots, 
                    Carlos said he d squeeze him in 
                    today at half rate as a favor.  

                                    CLAUDIA
                    We re in the business of making 
                    money, Simon, not spending it.  

                                  SIMON
                    I ll pay for the proofs myself.  
                    Take the whole thing out of my 
                    expense account.
                          (beat, he s serious)
                    I ve got a feeling on this one, Claudia, 
                    there s something about him...

      FRANCO and the Calvin Klein Execs step out of the conference 
      room.  Franco drops three photographs on Claudia s desk.

                                  FRANCO
                    You have two girls in consideration, 
                    Make sure they re both at the club 
                    tonight.

      He takes Claudia s hand, kisses it.

                                    CLAUDIA
                    They ll be there.

      And as he leaves, Claudia looks down at two pictures and 
      separates them: Marissa and... Raina.

                                                                      CUT OVER TO:

      CHRIS - UP AGAINST THE WALL, watching... Franco and company 
      ignore him as they pass by.  A beat later, Simon makes his 
      way over from Claudia, unreadable.

                                  CHRIS
                    What d she say?

                                  SIMON
                    She agreed to let me hip-pocket you.

                                  CHRIS
                    What does that mean?   "THE BEAUTIFUL LIFE"      Network Draft      2/8/2009    22.



                                  SIMON
                    It means you have exactly seven 
                    days to book a job, or I m about to 
                    waste a lot of time and money...

                    the ride of your life.

                                      ACT THREE

      FADE IN:


      The double doors open and Chris walks out with Simon.  

                                  SIMON
                          (to the lobby of girls)
                    Sorry girls, client s seen what they 
                    needed to see today.  The rest of 
                    your meetings are cancelled.  

      Chris steps over to his expectant family.  

                                  DANIELLE
                    Well?!?!

      Raina waits with the ANDREWS, a hopeful look on her face... 
      But as Chris approaches, he s shaking his head.

                                  CHRIS
                          (crestfallen)
                    Looks like they re gonna... 
                          (playing with them)
                    ... Give me a shot!

      Danielle immediately starts screaming, jumping up and down 
      and hugging her brother.  Bill looks to Karen, worried, but 
      also... proud.  Raina smiles, it s been a good 24 hours.

                                  SIMON
                          (calling from the door)
                    Raina-- I need to speak to you.

      Raina steps away from the celebrating family.  As she arrives  
      at Simon s side...

                                  SIMON (CONT D)
                    You like Chris, right?

                                  RAINA
                    Yeah, I mean... I just met him.

                                  SIMON
                    Claudia doesn t see it, I really had 
                    to stick my neck out, and I m gonna 
                    need your help.

                                  RAINA
                    What do you want me to do?

      He hands her an ONYX AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD.   "THE BEAUTIFUL LIFE"      Network Draft      2/8/2009    24.



                                  SIMON
                    Buy him a wardrobe.  La Croix, D&G, 
                    Rag and Bone.  I ve got him booked 
                    with Carlos Vasquez at two o clock.  
                    I want you there, make sure he s 
                    relaxed in front of the camera.  
                    These pictures need to blow 
                    everyone away.  After that, take 
                    him to the residence and introduce 
                    him around. 

                                  RAINA
                    Simon...

                                  SIMON
                    My reputation is riding on this.  
                    Wasn t so long ago you were in the 
                    exact same spot.  You owe me...

      Raina nods, turns.

                                  SIMON (CONT D)
                    One other thing.  
                          (she turns back)
                    You re on avail for Calvin Klein.

      A wink from Simon, as he turns, heads back through the doors.  
      And OFF Raina, thrilled...  


      ... a design studio, bustling with people.  We see racks of 
      clothes, sewing machines, mannequin forms.  Sketches line the 
      walls and an air of success fills the room.  Isaac, Egan and 
      Gabriel (looking like shit, no sleep, too many drugs the 
      night before) wait while a cluster of activity circles around 
      KAI, our Alpha-male model, being fitted for a suit.  

                                  ISAAC

                    home last night?

                                  VIVIENNE
                    Still tighter, Bobby.  I really

                                  BOBBY
                    If we go much tighter than this, 
                    Kai won t be able to lift his arms.

                                  VIVIENNE
                    Kai, you ll be gorgeous, darling, I 
                    promise.

                                  BOBBY
                    When isn t he?
                          (and then)
                    We re good here, sweetie, you can 
                    slide this off.

      As Kai carefully removes the jacket.  Bobby gestures toward 
      Isaac and Egan--

                    Put that one in the suit up in my 
                    office.  I want to take care of him 
                      personally.

      Bobby grins, has an idea what that means.  Vivienne steps 
      over to Gabriel, disgusted.

                                  VIVIENNE (CONT D)
                    You, go home and sleep.  I can t 
                    use you looking like this.

      Too tired to care, Gabriel gets up, saunters out.  Off 
      Vivienne, watching Isaac ascend the stairs...


      We find Isaac, with his sculpted chest and washboard abs, 
      changing in Vivienne's office.  The space is well adorned, 
      with walls of glass, giving it a bird s eye view of the 
      design floor.  A SLEEK, TIGHT-FITTING BEADED DRESS is 
      displayed on a dress form.  Isaac slips on a pair of suit 
      pants as Vivienne enters, watching him as if it were a show 
      meant just for her.

                    This is the Calvin Klein dress.

                    And I thought the suit you got me 
                    in is nice.

                                  VIVIENNE
                    It is.  I was thinking you might 
                    like to wear it to the Purple Party 
                    tonight.  As my companion, of 
                    course.

                                  ISAAC
                            (cautiously)
                    Are you asking me on a date?

                                  VIVIENNE
                    You make it sound like a death 
                    sentence.  Who knows, you might 
                    even enjoy yourself.

      Vivienne flips a switch and the privacy glass frosts over, 
      secluding them from any of the onlookers below.

                                  ISAAC
                    I m not sure what to say.

                                  VIVIENNE
                    There are only two answers, 
                    darling.  I ve had my eye on you 
                    for a while, now.  I can give you 
                    things most models only dream of.  
                    Access to designers and magazine 
                      editors... beautiful clothes...

      Vivienne circles around Isaac, letting her fingers drag 
      across his naked torso.

                    The arrangement is simple-- you 
                    take care of my needs, I ll take 
                    care of yours.

                                  ISAAC
                    Vivienne, I m flattered but... I 
                    can t.  I don t need to--

                    a few jobs here and there but 
                    you re never going to be Kai.

                    taking a day-job or being dropped 
                    by your agency and quitting 
                      altogether.  I can make this city a 
                    lot more enjoyable for you.  And I 
                    know you can do the same for me. 

      A beat, then--

                                  ISAAC
                    I m sorry, I can t do that.

                                  VIVIENNE
                    Your choice.

      She heads for the door, says without looking back--

                    Hang up the suit before you leave.

      Vivienne exits.  Off Isaac, wondering what just happened...


      Chris stands on a box in front of a three way mirror, while 
      the store tailor measures Chris  shoulders and neck.  Raina 
      watches from a nearby chair, enjoying the show.  The tailor 
      then drops to his knees to get Chris  inseam.  As he creeps 
      the tape ever closer to his crotch, Chris raises his eyebrows 
      uncomfortably.  Raina laughs.  And then we re...


      Chris sits in a chair, surrounded by dozens of open boxes of 
      expensive leather shoes.  A salesman shoe horns Chris  foot 
      into a perfectly good looking shoe.  But Raina is shaking her 
      head, not having it.  She points to another box.  And as the 
      beleaguered salesman soldiers on..


      Chris exits a dressing room in a funky club shirt and skinny 
      jeans, looking very uncomfortable.  Raina looks at him, uh... 
      no.  Hands him the next group of outfits to try on...

                                                                        QUICK CUTS:

      Chris exits the dressing room in something too trendy... 
      then, too retro, too Businessman-y, too Euro...

      Raina hangs more and more shirts and jeans over the top of 
      the dressing room door, as Chris tosses more and more outfits 
      back over the door at her.  One lands on her head. 

      Chris, goofing around, exits the dressing room in a 
      Seersucker suit, complete with fedora, and funky eyeglasses.  
      Raina laughs. 

      Finally, Chris steps out of the dressing room in an Italian 
      cut suit, simple, handsome white button down.  He looks like 
      a million bucks.  Raina smiles.   Mission accomplished.   And 
      as Kanye and T-Pain roll out...


      A large, open freight elevator arrives, and Chris and Raina 
      step into this airy Tribecca loft/photography studio, with 
      state of the art lighting equipment, Cyclorama, and, of 
      course, sound system.  A handful of arty young camera 
      assistants amble around, setting up equipment in the staging 
      area where CARLOS VASQUEZ, 40, tests his expensive-looking 
      camera.  The lights POP each time he clicks the shutter.     "THE BEAUTIFUL LIFE"      Network Draft      2/8/2009    30.

                    Feather the light a little from the 
                    beam and I think we re good to go.

      As the Camera assistant launches into action, Carlos spots 
      Raina and Chris at the door, approaches.

                                  CARLOS (CONT D)
                    Raina, kiddo.  Good to see you.

                                  RAINA
                    You too.  Carlos, this is Chris

                                  CARLOS
                    Great.  Ready to do this, Chris?

                                  CHRIS
                    Should I change first?  I got all 
                    these new shirts and pants...

                                  CARLOS
                    What are you most comfortable in?

                                  CHRIS
                    Uh, what I m wearing, I guess.

                                  CARLOS
                    Don t change a thing.  Point is to 
                    capture your authentic image.  
                    We re not selling clothes today, 
                    we re selling you.  What kind of 
                    music do you like? 

      And off Chris...

                                                                            CUT TO:

      As Chris tentatively steps onto the staging area, makes his 
      way to the center of the Cyc.

                                  CARLOS
                    Okay, Chris, we re gonna start with 
                    a few tests to make sure we have 
                    the right lighting.  

      Carlos starts snapping away, and the flashbulbs pop behind 
      the diffusers.  Chris isn t sure what to do.   "THE BEAUTIFUL LIFE"      Network Draft      2/8/2009    31.

                            assistant)
                    I m catching some ambient fall-off 
                    towards the back of the Cyc.  Close

                    What should I do?

                    Right there.

                                  CHRIS
                    Right here?

                                  CARLOS
                    That s perfect.
                          (to Chris)
                    Okay, Chris, you ready to try a few?  

      Chris nods, confused and nervous.  Raina offers a supportive 
       go get  em  look.  Carlos starts shooting.  Chris puts his 
      hands on his hips and smiles, the way you would for a high 
      school football photo.  Stands there, frozen. 

                                  CARLOS (CONT D)
                    Okay, Chris.  Let s just tone the 
                    wattage on that smile down about a 
                    hundred and ten percent.  And hands 
                    off the hips.

      Chris does as he s told, but is left fidgeting, staring into 
      camera like a deer in head lights.  Carlos looks to Raina, 
      who can see this is not going to go well.  She gets up, walks 
      off.  Carlos leans to an assistant:

                                  CARLOS (CONT D)
                    Let s get him a chair.

      The assistant rushes in with a chair.

                    Go ahead and try sitting down.

      After a few more snaps, it s obvious none of this is working.  
      Carlos stands up from his camera, not sure what to do.  Just 
      the SOUNDS OF DEF LEPPARD mercifully STOPS, and we, 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      A HAND, SWIRLING THROUGH THE LIBRARY OF SONGS IN AN IPOD 
      ATTACHED TO THE STEREO.  

      Widen to see the hand belongs to Raina...  

      She chooses a song, turns and walks back towards the photo 
      shoot.  Takes the scrunchy out of her hair, and lets it fall 
      around her shoulders.  As Raina arrives on set, we hear MARY 
      J. BLIGE,  TALK TO ME  KICK IN.  The mood in the room 
      instantly changes as she approaches Chris, behind the chair. 
      Leans in.

                    Just relax, listen to the music. 

      She smooths her hands over his shoulders and down his arms.  
      She whispers --

                    Close your eyes.  Pretend you re in 
                    the shower--

      Chris turns to ask a question, she turns him back, smooths 
      his shoulders again.

                    you breathe in the steam and the 
                    heat...

      Chris  breathing changes, he s visibly relaxing, his body 
      moving with Raina s sensual description.  She s right behind 
      him, whispering in his ear.  Carlos begins to see what he s 
      looking for and starts shooting, circling Raina and Chris.   "THE BEAUTIFUL LIFE"      Network Draft      2/8/2009    33.



                                  CARLOS
                    Touch him, Raina.

      Raina runs her fingers gently through Chris  hair, he opens 
      his eyes and turns to face Raina.  SHUTTER CLICKS.

                                  CARLOS (CONT D)
                    Oh, that s good.  That s so good...

      Chris looks into Raina s eyes, drawn to her and she to him.  
      He pulls Raina closer to him and she bends with his touch 
      until they are face to face, so close and then... their lips 
      are touching and they are lost in a kiss while SHUTTER CLICKS 
      surround them.  The moment goes on... until -- 

                                  CARLOS (CONT D)
                    Okay!  Got what I need.  Fantastic, 
                    you two.

      Chris and Raina part, stunned by the pull between them and 
      unable to let it go.  Off this tableau --

      FADE IN:


      It looks like Spring Break in here, with beer bottles and 
      trash, pretty people and a yellow caution sign on the wall 
      that reads,  DON T FEED THE MODELS.   Chris follows Raina off 
      through the dorm-like residence, wide-eyed to the party that 
      unfolds before him.  The residual sexual tension between 
      them, still palpable.

                                  RAINA
                    So, this is the residence.
                          (points)
                    My room s down there.  Yours is...

      She leads him to a particular door, opens it. 

                                  RAINA (CONT D)
                    Here.

      Raina may be blushing just a little as she enters...


      Raina and Chris enter to find Isaac and Egan, on a small 
      couch, taking turns smoking from a bong.  Gabriel hovers over 
      them, fidgety.  The common room is cramped, barely furnished, 
      and anything but luxurious.  There's a small attached kitchen 
      and two doors that lead to adjoining bedrooms.

                    In here?  This ought to be good.

      Egan opens a box, pulls out a small packet of white powder, 
      hands it to Gabriel in exchange for a wad of bills.

                                    GABRIEL
                          (to Chris)
                    Welcome to the jungle, man.

      Gabriel exits.  Raina shoots a look to Isaac and Egan.

                                  RAINA
                    I have to get ready for the Purple 
                    Party so be nice, okay?
                          (to Chris)
                    See you later?

                                  CHRIS
                    Yeah.

      The chemistry here does not go unnoticed by the other guys.  
      Raina exits, Isaac gets up.

                                  ISAAC
                          (to Chris)
                    You want a beer, brother?

                                  CHRIS
                    More than you can imagine.

      Isaac cracks open a bottle, hands it to him.  Egan takes 
      another hit off the bong, offers it to Chris, but Chris 
      shakes him off, swigs from his beer.

                                  EGAN
                    I can t believe they assigned Kai a 
                    roommate.

                                  ISAAC
                    He s gonna be off his head.

      Chris looks around, confused, takes another swig from his beer.

                                  CHRIS
                    Who s Kai?


      Raina enters to find Marissa on one of the beds, painting her 
      toenails.

                                  RAINA
                    Hey.   "THE BEAUTIFUL LIFE"      Network Draft      2/8/2009    36.



      Marissa barely looks up.  We HEAR someone THROWING UP in the 
      bathroom.

                                  RAINA (CONT D)
                    Who s that?

                                    MARISSA
                    Sonja.  For the third time.

      Raina goes to the bathroom door, pushes it open to see Sonja, 
      wiping her face with a towel.

                                  RAINA
                          (concerned)
                    Are you sick?

                                  SONJA
                    Are you an idiot?

      Sonja slams the door shut.

                    She s trying to get her weight down 
                    for the party.  

      Sonja comes out of the bathroom, heads to the closet, starts 
      flipping through clothes.

                    Not a problem.

                                    MARISSA
                          (under her breath)
                    It was last night...

      Sonja comes out of the closet.

                                  SONJA
                    I heard that, you bitch.

      Marissa smiles.

                    Your closet is a disaster, anyway.

      Sonja ignores Raina, exits.

                    Is she mad at me about last night?

                                    MARISSA
                    Of course she s mad at you.  She s 
                    also mad at me for booking the 
                    Calvin Klein job.

                                  RAINA
                    You booked it?

                                    MARISSA
                    They put me on avail.  

                                  RAINA
                    So you didn t book it.

                                    MARISSA
                    I m using  the Secret  to bring it 
                    to me.  Apparently it s down to me 
                    and one other girl.

                                  RAINA
                    That would be me.

      Off Marissa...


      Sonja waits at the door to the guys  room.  Egan appears.

                                  EGAN
                    Here.

      He hands her a bottle of pills.

                                  SONJA
                    You re sure they burn fat?

                                  EGAN
                    Like a mother.  But be careful, if 
                    you take too many, they can stop 
                    your heart.  Don t mix and match.

                                  SONJA
                    Whatever.  Thanks, Egan.

      She shoves several bills into his hand.  The ELEVATOR opens 
      and Kai gets out.   "THE BEAUTIFUL LIFE"      Network Draft      2/8/2009    38.

                    Hold the elevator, Kai.

      He does, she runs to catch it.


      Kai enters, heads to his room without bothering to say hello 
      to Isaac, Egan or Chris.  Chris jumps up.

                                  CHRIS
                    Hey, are you Kai?  I m your new 
                    roommate.

      Kai stares back at him with contempt.

                                  KAI
                    I don t have a roommate, it s part

                    This is the only empty room, and

                    Hello?... 

      Off Chris...


      Chris walks in, carrying his bags.  The apartment s retro yet 
      swank, lit with dozens of candles.

                    The guest room is just down the 
                    hallway to the right.  You have 
                    time to shower before the party.  
                    You want something to drink?

      Simon starts rifling through Chris  bags...

                                  SIMON (CONT D)
                    Let s take a look at what you and 
                    Raina picked up today.

                      immediately... take your clothes 
                    off, put this on.

      He lays a shirt and pants out for Chris.

                                  CHRIS
                    Right here?

      Chris hesitates, wary.

                                  SIMON
                    Don t tell me you re modest?  At 
                    castings and shows, you re gonna be 
                    in front of fifty, sixty people, in 
                    a whole lot less than your 
                    skivvies.  Come on.

      Chris begrudgingly undresses down to his boxers.     "THE BEAUTIFUL LIFE"      Network Draft      2/8/2009    40.



                                  SIMON (CONT D)
                    Not bad.  A bit beefy, and those 
                    sad little chest hairs will have to 
                    go, but we can work with this... 
                    Your neck s a little big, so s your 
                    waist.  

      Simon reaches his finger tips into the pants above the top of 
      his crotch; Chris reflexively FLINCHES.

                                  SIMON (CONT D)
                    Calm down, cowboy, this isn t my 
                    first time at the rodeo.

                    Sorry, I m just not really used to 
                    all of this.

                                  SIMON
                    If I m going to be helping you, 
                    you re gonna need to learn to trust 
                    me...

      Simon drops down to his knees, much like a tailor would, 
      looks up at Chris as he says...

                                  SIMON (CONT D)
                    You re gonna need to walk, talk, 
                    dress, and act the way that I tell 
                    you to.  Now, come on, open up.

      Chris widens his stance and Simon reaches up between his legs 
      to measure his inseam.  Chris FLINCHES again.

                                  SIMON (CONT D)
                    Okay, this is getting annoying...  
                    Believe me, if I wanted to touch 
                    you, I d just touch you...

      Chris, normally quick with his fists, can t believe what s 
      happening.  Simon stares back at him, daring him to react.

                                  SIMON (CONT D)
                    Do you have something you want to 
                    say?  Because we can just stop 
                    right now?

      Chris remains frozen, forced to swallow his pride.

                                  SIMON (CONT D)
                    Great, seems we have an understanding.   "THE BEAUTIFUL LIFE"      Network Draft      2/8/2009    41.

      FADE IN:


      Chris is in awe as he enters.  The club is a large warehouse 
      styled space, with multiple bars and a whisper lounge which 
      are now decorated for The Purple Party.  Large mock-ups of 
      the latest issue of Purple Magazine are scattered about the 
      room.  Power players and pretty people mingle in booths and 
      on cushioned sectionals.    

      The dance floor is packed with models and fashionistas from 
      all over the world.  We see every type and every color, from 
      classic beauties, to exotics, to the ugly-chic.  Chris 
      follows Simon through the crowd, and into...


      ... the whisper lounge.  It s small and dark, with booths and 
      cocktail tables, but it s still close enough to the dance 
      floor to hear the pump of the music.  Simon smiles, puts his 
      arm around Chris and gestures discreetly to the notables in 
      the room.

                    Zac!  Hi.  

      They give each other a kiss-kiss.  Chris watches on. 

                                  SIMON (CONT D)
                    Claudia absolutely loved the 
                    handbag you sent.

                                  ZAC POSEN
                    Have her call me.  I have a new

                    Posen, this is Chris Andrews--

      Chris offers his hand to shake, which Zac Posen finds almost 
      quaint. 

                                  CHRIS
                    Hi.  Zac, is it?

                          (amused)
                    Yes.

      Zac smiles to Simon,  where d you find him? 

                                  SIMON
                    Chris is fresh off the farm.

                    Enjoy corrupting him.

                                  SIMON
                    Oh, I will.

      Simon LAUGHS and ushers Chris across the room.


      Raina enters, looks around, knows no one.  Spotting Marissa 
      at the bar, she heads over.


      Marissa takes a sip of her martini as Raina walks up.

                                    MARISSA
                    Martini?   "THE BEAUTIFUL LIFE"      Network Draft      2/8/2009    44.



                                  RAINA
                    No, thanks.  Who ARE all these 
                    people?  I don t recognize anyone. 

                                    MARISSA
                    You will, once you ve worked a 
                    little more.

      Raina feels that dig, but sees Sonja enter the club, WEARING 
      THE ONE OF A KIND CALVIN KLEIN DRESS FOR FRANCO S SHOOT.

                                  RAINA
                    Oh, my god.

                                    MARISSA
                    What?
                          (sees Sonja)
                    Are you kidding me?  How did she 
                    get that dress?

      Sonja walks toward them, working that dress and enjoying the 
      moment.

                                    MARISSA (CONT D)
                    You stole the Calvin Klein?  Are 
                    you psychotic?

                                  SONJA
                    Vivienne told me to go through her 
                    stock and take whatever I wanted.  
                    This one called out to me.

      Sonja stretches her arm out on the bar, smiles seductively at 
      Franco, who is approaching, with Claudia.  Franco arrives 
      with a wicked smile on his face; more turned on than 
      outraged.

                                  FRANCO
                    Sonja, you bad, bad girl.  That 
                    dress looks like it was made for 
                    you.

                                  SONJA
                    Say the word, and it was.

                                  FRANCO
                          (leaning in, whispering)
                    I didn t know you had it in you.
                          (then, for Claudia s 
                            benefit)
                    I may just have to re-think this 
                    campaign.  We may need a 
                      recognizable face after all.   "THE BEAUTIFUL LIFE"      Network Draft      2/8/2009    45.



      Claudia plays it off.  Off Sonja smiling, vindicated,


      Isaac checks his coat while Egan checks his hair in a 
      mirrored wall.

                                  ISAAC
                    Afraid you re too ugly to get laid?

                                  EGAN
                    At least you ve got Vivienne to 
                    fall back on.  Literally.

      Isaac shoots him a  fuck off  look as Gabriel skitters up to 
      Egan.  He s fidgety; his eyes are wet and a little wild.

                                    GABRIEL
                    Yo, Egan, hook me up.

                                  EGAN
                    I know you are not asking me what 
                    you seem to be asking me, right 
                    here at the front of club.  I know 
                    you are not that dumb.

                                    GABRIEL
                    Come on, dude.  It s time to party.

                                  EGAN
                    Looks like you started the party 
                    too early.

      Egan discreetly pulls a vial of powder from his pocket, 
      slides it to Gabriel.

                                    GABRIEL
                    I ll get you back at the residence.

                                    GABRIEL (CONT D)
                    Thanks, man.

      Gabriel disappears into the crowd.  Isaac shoots Egan a 
        disapproving look, as they move into the party.


      Chris and Simon take drinks from the bartender, scope out the 
      crowd.  Simon spots HARVEY COMSTOCK, 50 s, across the room, 
      talking with Claudia.   "THE BEAUTIFUL LIFE"      Network Draft      2/8/2009    46.



                                  SIMON
                    There s Harvey Comstock, the 
                    Editorial Director of VOGUE.
                          (hands Chris his drink)
                    Watch for my signal, then bring 
                    over the drinks.

      Simon moves away.  Marissa slides up next to Chris, who is 
      now holding two drinks.

                                    MARISSA
                    Enjoying your date?

                                  CHRIS
                    It s not a date.  Simon s just 
                    helping me get started.

                                    MARISSA
                    I m pretty sure you re the only one 
                    in this room who believes that.  
                    Simon s been telling everyone he 
                    has you living with him, now.  I m 
                    Marissa.

      Chris isn t crazy about the smirk on Marissa s face.  He 
      looks over to see Simon chatting up HARVEY COMSTOCK with 
      Claudia.  At that moment, Simon waves to Chris and motions 
      for him to come over.

                                    MARISSA (CONT D)
                    Better hop to it.  Simon hates for 
                    his boys to keep him waiting.

      Chris is about to fire back at Marissa, but instead, heads 
      over to

      SIMON... who takes his drink from Chris with a smile.

                                  SIMON
                    Oh, baby, thank you.
                          (to Harvey)
                    Come meet Harvey--

                                  CHRIS
                    Don t do that.

                                  SIMON
                    Do what?

                                  CHRIS
                    I m not your baby.

      Simon exchanges uncomfortable looks with Harvey and Claudia.   "THE BEAUTIFUL LIFE"      Network Draft      2/8/2009    47.



                                    CLAUDIA
                    Excuse me, Harvey...

      Claudia heads off, but as she does, leans into Simon.

                                    CLAUDIA (CONT D)
                    Get a grip on that kid, Simon.

                                  SIMON
                    We re fine.
                          (as she goes, to Chris)
                    Loosen up, we re here to have fun, 
                    have a sip of that drink.

      Simon places his arm on Chris  back but Chris throws Simon s 
      arm off, pushing him away.

                                  CHRIS
                    Quit touching me--

      Simon falls back into Harvey, spilling Harvey s drink all 
      over his suit.

                                  SIMON
                          (turning on Chris)
                    Have you lost your mind?

                                  CHRIS
                    I m not your boyfriend.  If that s 
                    what this is about, forget it.

                                  SIMON
                    Oh, believe me, any interest I had 
                    is forgotten.  Now leave before I 
                    have you thrown out.  

      Chris turns and goes.  Simon hurries to Harvey, begins wiping 
      the alcohol off his trousers.

                                  SIMON (CONT D)
                    I m so sorry Harvey--

                                  HARVEY
                    Get your hands off me, Simon.  And 
                    get that client of yours back here.  
                    He s the first kid I ve met all 
                    night who isn t just another pretty 
                    boy.

                                  SIMON
                    Harvey, all due respect--   "THE BEAUTIFUL LIFE"      Network Draft      2/8/2009    48.



                                  HARVEY 
                          (to Claudia)
                    Can you get him for me or not?

                                    CLAUDIA
                      Absolutely.
                          (to Simon)
                    Simon?

      Simon is mortified and angry, but he does as he s told.  Off 
      Simon s exit,


      Chris pushes angrily through the crowd, passing Raina without 
      speaking to her.  Raina s confused by the snub but then sees 
      Sonja coming out of a private curtained booth, disheveled and 
      upset.  Sonja runs to the women s room.  A moment later, 
      Raina sees Franco exit the curtained booth, straightening his 
      shirt and looking around, pissed.  Raina follows Sonja to --


      Raina enters, HEARS SOBS, follows them to the end stall.  
      Raina knocks on the door --

                                  RAINA
                    Sonja...

      Unlocked, the stall door swings open to reveal Sonja, crying 
        uncontrollably.

                                  SONJA
                    Could you please leave me the hell 
                    alone?!

                                  RAINA
                    What s wrong?  What happened with 
                    Franco?

      Raina notices that the side zipper on Sonja s $20,000 dress 
      is ripped.

                                  RAINA (CONT D)
                    Oh, my god, Sonja... the zipper is 
                    almost out.  What did he do?

                                  SONJA
                    He said if I was desperate enough 
                    to steal the dress, I was desperate 
                    enough to let him take it off.  No 
                    one s ever treated me like that.   
                    I m through...   "THE BEAUTIFUL LIFE"      Network Draft      2/8/2009    49.



                                  RAINA
                    No, Sonja.  You re a star--

      Raina tries to touch Sonja, but Sonja pulls away, violently.

                                  SONJA
                    Don t you dare feel sorry for me.  
                    This is going to be you in a few 
                    years, just wait.  

      Raina sees the fear in Sonja s eyes.  Sonja slams past her 
      and exits the bathroom.  Off Raina,


      Chris pushes his way toward the entrance as Simon catches up 
      to him, grabs his arm.

                                  SIMON
                    Chris--

                                  CHRIS
                    I don t want to talk to you--

                                  SIMON
                    Do you want a job?  Because Mr. 
                    VOGUE Magazine is back there 
                    drooling over you for manhandling 
                    me.

      Off Chris, confused,


      Egan and Marissa enter together as Raina is leaving the 
      bathroom. 

                                    MARISSA
                    Having fun?

      Raina ignores her, exits.  Marissa looks to Egan, who shrugs, 
      pulls out a vial of coke.

                                    MARISSA (CONT D)
                          (kidding)
                    You re not going to charge me for 
                    this, are you?

                                  EGAN
                    Actually, I am.   "THE BEAUTIFUL LIFE"      Network Draft      2/8/2009    50.



      Egan kisses Marissa.  It s a good one.  Marissa s surprised 
      by how good.  Just then, Gabriel enters, holding hands with a 
      KATE MOSS LOOK-A-LIKE.

                                    GABRIEL
                          (to Egan)
                    I need a little more, bro.

                                  EGAN
                    You already blew what I gave you? 

                                    GABRIEL
                    Got a lot of friends.  Had to 
                    share.  Come on, I m good for it.  
                    I m on avail for Hugo Boss and 
                    Roberto Cavalli.

      Egan considers for a beat.  He s more upset about having his 
      time with Marissa interrupted.  He slips Gabriel another 
      packet of powder.

                                  EGAN
                    Take it somewhere else.  This is a 
                    private party.

      Gabriel looks to Marissa.  Smiles.

                                    GABRIEL
                    Egan s moving up in the world.  Or 
                    you re moving down...

                                    MARISSA
                    Bite me, loser--

                                  EGAN
                          (to Gabriel)
                    Just go, okay?

                                    GABRIEL
                    Sure, bro.

      Gabriel takes the coke and the girl, moves down the row of 
      stalls, heads into one, laughing and flirting.  Egan looks 
      back to Marissa, who is now hyper aware of being affiliated 
      with someone beneath her status.

                                    MARISSA
                    I m going back to the party--

      Egan grabs her arm, pulls her to him.  They hold the moment, 
      close together before Egan kisses Marissa deeply.  Again, 
      it s good.  Marissa pull away slightly, considers, then leads 
      Egan into a stall and closes the door.   "THE BEAUTIFUL LIFE"      Network Draft      2/8/2009    51.




      Raina sees Sonja take a long black coat from the COATCHECK 
      GIRL, drape it around herself and hurry out the door.  Raina 
      turns and scans the crowd until she spots Franco.  A beat, 
      she makes a beeline for him.


      Raina approaches Franco.

                                  RAINA
                          (seductively)
                    Got a minute?

                                  FRANCO
                    Depends.  What do you want?

                                  RAINA
                          (leans in, whispers)
                    The job.

      He smiles at her.

                                  FRANCO
                    Why don t we step into my office 
                    and discuss it.

      He opens the curtain to the private booth, Raina saunters in.


      It s dark, cozy as Franco follows Raina in.  He slides his 
      hands onto her hips and turns her toward him.

                                  FRANCO
                    Now, exactly how much do you want 
                    the job?

                                  RAINA
                    That s hard to put into words.

                                  FRANCO
                    Then show me.

      As he lifts her up onto the table and lays her back, we see 
      that Raina has her cellphone out and is recording.  

                                  RAINA

                                  FRANCO
                    It s how you will.  I m about to 
                    make some lucky girl a star.  Why 
                    not you?

      Franco kisses her neck, takes down the straps of her dress.  
      It s then he notices the cell/camera.

                                  FRANCO (CONT D)
                    You like to take pictures, dirty 
                    girl?

                                  RAINA
                    Video, actually.

                                  FRANCO
                    Even better.  Send me a copy.

                                  RAINA
                    I will.  Right after I email it to 
                    a friend for safe keeping.

      She hits  send  on her phone.

                    I m fifteen.

      Franco stops pawing her.

                                  FRANCO
                    Is this a joke?

                                  RAINA
                    Am I laughing?

      Franco realizes she s serious, grabs her phone but the file 
      has been sent.

                                  RAINA (CONT D)
                    So.  Here s what s going to happen...

                                        ACT SIX

      FADE IN:


      Egan has Marissa up against the wall, kissing her 
      passionately.  They re both into it when suddenly, we hear a 
      SCREAM.

                                  KATE MOSS LOOK-A-LIKE
                    Help!  Oh, my god!  Somebody help!

      Egan and Marissa run to find Gabriel on the floor of the 
      bathroom, having a seizure.  His wispy girlfriend is high and 
      freaking out.  Egan checks Gabriel.

                                  EGAN
                          (to the girl)
                    Call 9-1-1.

                                  KATE MOSS LOOK-A-LIKE
                    Oh, my god...

                                  EGAN
                    Do it!

                                  KATE MOSS LOOK-A-LIKE
                    I can t be involved in this.

      She runs out.  Egan looks to Marissa.

                                  EGAN
                    We gotta get out of here.

                                    MARISSA
                    We can t leave him like this-- he s 
                    having a seizure or something.

      Egan takes Marissa s hand and pulls her out of the stall.

                                  EGAN
                    They ll take care of him.  We can t 
                    be here.

                                    MARISSA
                    I m calling for help.

      And as Marissa dials 911...


      Simon follows Chris as he approaches Claudia and Harvey 
      Comstock.  Claudia sees Chris coming, is overly friendly --   "THE BEAUTIFUL LIFE"      Network Draft      2/8/2009    54.



                                    CLAUDIA
                    There he is!

                                  CHRIS
                          (defensively)
                    You wanted to talk to me?

                                    CLAUDIA
                    Harvey s intrigued by you.  He 
                    thinks there may be something for 
                    you down the road at VOGUE.

                                  CHRIS
                          (to Harvey, skeptically)
                    Really.

                                  HARVEY
                    I d like you to come by the 
                    magazine next week, meet some 
                    people.  Claudia will set it up.

      Chris looks to Claudia, whose smile confirms what Harvey 
      said.

                                  CHRIS
                    Well, that would be... that sounds 
                    great.  Thank you.

                                  HARVEY
                    And wear your own clothes.

      Chris looks at the clothes Simon insisted he wear.

                                  HARVEY (CONT D)
                    I want to see you.  Not some 
                    stylist s idea of who you are.

                                  CHRIS
                    Yes, sir.

      Harvey kisses Claudia on the cheek, exits.  Simon stares 
      daggers at Chris.  

                                  SIMON

                                    CLAUDIA
                    Don t be stupid.  Of course you 
                    will.  Enjoy the fact that you were 
                    right about him having something 
                    special and take the commission.

                      Otherwise, I ll be forced to hire 
                    an agent who will. 

      Simon is seething.  He exchanges a look with Chris as Franco 
      walks up to the group.

                                  FRANCO
                          (agitated)
                    Claudia, I need to talk with you 
                    about the campaign.  I ve made a 
                    decision.

                                    CLAUDIA
                      Fantastic.  Who s the lucky girl, 
                    Marissa or Raina? 

                                  FRANCO
                    Sonja.

                                    CLAUDIA
                    I m sorry.  Did you say Sonja?

                                  FRANCO
                    You heard me.  Is she available?

                                    CLAUDIA
                    Yes.  Of course.  But why--

                                  FRANCO
                    Are you really going to argue with 
                    me about hiring your most expensive 
                    client?

                                    CLAUDIA
                    I ll have her at your office first 
                    thing in the morning.  I think 
                    Sonja s a dynamite pick.

                                  FRANCO
                    That s better.
                          (then)
                    Good night.

      Franco walks away.

                                  SIMON
                    What the hell was that? 

                                    CLAUDIA
                    Something must have happened to 
                    change his mind.  But if he wants 
                    to pay four times the money, I ll 
                    be happy to take it.   "THE BEAUTIFUL LIFE"      Network Draft      2/8/2009    56.



      Chris watches Franco exiting.  An unfriendly look passes 
      between Franco and Raina on Franco s way out.  Chris wonders 
      what that was about when suddenly, PARAMEDICS rush into the 
      club.  Chris heads in the direction of the disturbance, sees 
      Marissa and Egan coming toward him.

                                  CHRIS
                    Did somebody get hurt?

                                  EGAN
                    I don t know, man.  We re heading out.

      Marissa barely looks at Chris as they pass.  Chris joins the  
      crowd of onlookers outside of the bathroom, which includes 
      Isaac.

                                  ISAAC
                    It s Gabriel.  I think he overdosed 
                    or something.

                                  CHRIS
                    Or something.

      The crowd pushes back to make room for paramedics to wheel 
      Gabriel out on a gurney.  As the gurney passes Claudia, Isaac 
      hears her tell Simon - -

                                    CLAUDIA
                    That s it.  Take him off the board.  
                    He s finished.
                          (then)
                    But first find a suitable 
                      replacement for the Hugo Boss job.

      Off Isaac, absorbing the callousness of this world,


      Vivienne is sitting in a booth with a GORGEOUS YOUNG MALE 
      MODEL when Isaac comes up.

                                  ISAAC
                          (to Vivienne)
                    Sorry to interrupt, but I need to 
                    talk to you.

      Vivienne doesn t move a muscle.

      She s fucking with him and he knows it.  He s going to have 
      to earn it.  He leans on the table, getting closer to her.

                                  ISAAC
                    Afraid it can t wait, love.  It s urgent.

      Vivienne keeps eye contact with Isaac as she loops her arm 
      through the gorgeous male model s --

                                  VIVIENNE
                    I don t want to be rude to Jeffrey.

                                  ISAAC
                    Then allow me.
                          (to the male model)
                    Move or I ll take your bloody arm 
                    off.

      Unsure of how to react, the male model looks to Vivienne, 
      who s suddenly turned on...

                                  VIVIENNE
                    Take a walk, Jeffrey.

      Jeffrey exits, Isaac takes his place.

                                  ISAAC
                    I ve been thinking about your offer.

                                  VIVIENNE
                    The position s been filled.

                                  ISAAC
                    You mean Jeffrey?  I wouldn t have 
                    walked away from you just now.

                                  VIVIENNE
                    No, you walked away from me 
                    earlier, so crawling back now--

      Isaac stops her with a kiss full on the mouth.  When they 
      part, Isaac says --

                                  ISAAC
                    Send Jeffrey home.

      A wicked smile spreads across Vivienne s face.  Off which,

      As the reality dawns on her that it really might be over, 
      Sonja begins to cry.  She can t do this anymore.  Going a 
      little mad, she flings open the medicine cabinet, rifles 
      through pill bottles until she finds the ONE.  She looks at 
      it soberly for a moment before unscrewing the top and pouring 
      out a HANDFUL OF PILLS.  As she contemplates her next move,

                    I hope Gabriel is going to be okay.

                    the agency.
