INSERT FOOTAGE: Phil is power walking with two hiking poles 
and wearing MBT trainers with big, rounded soles.

Cameron and Mitchell arrive at their car.  Mitchell is 
carrying Lily.  Cameron opens the door for Mitchell to load 
her in, but Mitchell stops.

MITCHELL
Maybe you should do this.  

CAMERON
Why?

MITCHELL
I don t want to bump her head against 
the door or pinch her with the seat 
belt.

CAMERON
Mitchell, how long are you going to 
beat yourself up over one mistake?  Is 
this going to be like the blonde 
highlights all over again?MODERN FAMILY "Run For Your Wife" 8/11/09 Shooting Pink Rev  20A.


MITCHELL
It s just... I think I suck at being a 
father.

CAMERON
What are you talking about?  We re new 
at this.

MITCHELL
Except that you re like a natural at 
this.  You walk in the room and she 
lights up.  You can change a diaper 
with one hand.  Nice, huh, I m 
actually jealous of you.

CAMERON
But you do so many things I don t do.  
You baby-proofed our entire house.  
You took care of all the adoption 
paperwork.  Without you, we wouldn t 
even have a baby to injure. 

MITCHELL
It was just a few forms...

CAMERON
Which I couldn t make any sense out 
of.  And you got us on those preschool 
waiting lists.

MITCHELL
I still can t believe you were going 
to wait until she was  old enough.

Claire and Phil are mid-race.  Claire is winning easily.  She 
is neither breathing hard nor sweating.  Phil is a mess, so

the kids with the caption,  World s Best Dad .

CLAIRE
I run five miles a day.  I have a 
resting heart rate of forty-eight.  I 
would never lose a two mile race to 
Johnny Ski Pole.  But after seeing the 
look on Phil s face when the kids came 
home from school and then seeing that 
shirt, I realized something.  The 
first day of school is a big 
adjustment for all of us, but it s 
especially hard on Phil.MODERN FAMILY "Run For Your Wife" 8/11/09 Shooting Pink Rev  26.



Claire is comfortably ahead.  She glances over her shoulder 
at Phil and after a beat, lets him pass.

PHIL
And down the stretch he goes.


Phil makes it back to the house first and begins his victory 
celebration.
