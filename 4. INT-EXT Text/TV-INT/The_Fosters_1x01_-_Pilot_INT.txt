      CALLIE JACOB (16, offbeat, beautiful, hard behind the eyes) 
      navigates the maze of cement tables, chin up but eyes down, 
      trying to find a place to eat in the buzzing, grey-green 
      cafeteria.  When she spots a COUPLE GIRLS in a shouting match, 
      she reconnoiters to avoid the conflict.

      She spies an empty table on the periphery and sits down 
      quietly.  Before she can finish even a bite of the slop they 
      call a meal in this place, TWO TOUGH GIRLS descend, plopping 
      down on either side of her.

                                    GIRL #1
                  You getting out today?  Huh?  That s 
                  what we heard.

      Callie grips her fork, lets out a deep sigh, and looks down.

                                    GIRL #2
                  Aw, she don t want no trouble.  That 
                  it?

                                    GIRL #1
                  Why you so quiet, bitch?  You was all 
                  mouthy the other day when I cut in 
                  front of you in the showers.  I lost 
                  my yard privileges  cause of you...

      Callie bites her tongue so hard it almost bleeds, then nods 
      her head and grabs her tray.  She stands up slowly, carefully.

      Girl #2 gets in her face.  Callie tries to turn around, but 
      Girl #1 is already there.  She is trapped.

                                    GIRL #2
                  She asked you a question - you 
                    gettin  out today?

      She shoves Callie, who rocks back but does not fall.  The rage 
      and fury behind Callie s eyes is terrifying.  But she still 
      says nothing.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"2.


                                    GIRL #1
                  Huh?  You too good to talk to me, 
                  pretty girl?

      She shoves her again.  Callie s tray falls to the floor with a 
      clatter.

                                    GIRL #1 (CONT D)
                  We oughtta beat the crap outta you.

      Tough Girl #1 shoots a look at one of the GUARDS standing in 
      the corner.

                                    GIRL #1 (CONT D)
                  Nah, you ain t worth it.  You ain t 
                  worth anything.

      But she stays in Callie s face.  These words set off something 
      in Callie, who can t hold her tongue anymore.

                                    CALLIE
                          (with venom)
                  You really need a dog treat for that 
                    breath, bitch...

      And with that, Girl #1 hauls off and CLOCKS Callie, right in 
      the jaw, hard.  Callie staggers to the left, absorbing the 
      blow.  But she does not retaliate.

      This enrages the girls, who both unleash on Callie, pounding 
      her from all sides.  It s almost hypnotic, watching Callie 
      receive punch after punch, never responding.

      IN SLO-MOTION: Callie gets knocked side to side, her eyes full 
      of rage and pain, but even more than that, full of purpose.  A 
      soft, elegiac piece of CLASSICAL MUSIC begins to play on a 
      piano.

      The brutality of Callie s beatdown is highlighted against this 
      soothing, perfect composition.



      A dark high school auditorium.  Onstage, BRANDON FOSTER (16, 
      intense, sexy, different, think young Andrew Garfield) plays a 
      baby grand piano and finishes his song.  Behind him, a banner 
      proclaims SAN DIEGO MUSIC SOCIETY ANNUAL COMPETITION.

      Throughout the audience, a smattering of STUDENTS and 
      CHAPERONES wait their turns.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"3.


      Toward the back of the house, STEF FOSTER (about 40, strong 
      but full of heart), still wearing her Police Officer s 
      uniform, proudly bobs her head in time with her son. 

      On the seat beside her, her iPhone lights up   LENA CALLING   
      but she doesn t notice.  It finally stops its silent ring and 
      the screen changes to read SIX MISSED CALLS.



      Inside, LENA FOSTER (35, warm, striking, African-American) 
      sits in her car with her cell phone pressed to her ear. 

                                    STEF (V.O.)
                  Hey, it s Stef.  I m either working 
                  or avoiding your call, so leave a -

      Lena hangs up, takes a breath, then climbs out of the car.



      Callie sits in one corner of the kitchen, diametrically across 
      from MARIANA (15, Latina, smart as a whip) and JESUS (15, 
      Mariana s fraternal twin, surfer dude swagger) - who are 
      carefully eyeing this new girl.  They exchange a look of WHO-
            IS-THIS-GIRL-AND-WHAT-IS-SHE-DOING-IN-OUR-HOUSE?

      Lena pulls a bag of frozen peas out of the freezer and hands 
      it to Callie, who puts it on her swollen eye without saying 
      anything. 

                                    LENA
                    Mariana and Jesus were in the foster 
                    program, too.  They came to us about 
                  eight years ago, and we formally 
                    adopted them, what -

                                    JESUS
                  - five years ago.

                                    MARIANA
                          (making an effort)
                  The foster system sucks -

                                    LENA
                    Mariana...      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"8.


                                    MARIANA
                  What?  It does.  

                                    JESUS
                  What happened to your face?  You get 
                  in a fight?

      Callie looks at her for a moment, then shrugs.  She is not 
      ready to open up to these people.  Lena jumps in.

                                    LENA
                    Callie s had quite a day, so why 
                  don t we cool it with the third 
                    degree.  

      An awkward moment.  Callie finally speaks.

                                    CALLIE
                  Is there a - where s the bathroom?

      Lena points down the hall.

                                    LENA
                  Second door on the right.

      Callie nods, disappears down the hall.  Mariana turns to Lena.

                                    MARIANA
                  So... where d she come from?

                                    LENA
                  Um, well - I, um, called Bill - from 
                  Child Protective Services, remember 
                  him? - to talk to him about 
                    something, and he was in a jam and 
                  needed a place for Callie to stay.  
                  She s had a - rough time lately, so I 
                  want you guys to be extra nice to 
                  her... 

                                    JESUS
                    Whaddaya mean, a rough time?

      Lena conspicuously doesn t mention juvie.

                                    LENA
                  She got herself in some - trouble, 
                  that s all.  Don t worry about it.

                                    MARIANA
                          (antenna up)
                  Talk to Bill about what?      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"9.


                                    JESUS
                          (to his sister)
                    Guess...

      Lena considers whether to tell them or not.

                                    LENA
                  I was gonna wait until everyone was 
                  home to tell you guys, but...  I was 
                    calling to see if we could arrange a 
                  visit with your birth mom.

      A beat.  Silence.  Lena looks at them both.

                                    LENA (CONT D)
                          (mostly to Mariana, 
                            confused)
                    I thought you d be more excited.  
                  It s kinda all you ve been talking 
                  about for the last six months.

      Mariana shakes her head, gets a little quiet.

                                    MARIANA
                  Yeah, I know.  I just - I don t think 
                  so.

      Lena is completely shocked by Mariana s response.  Frankly, so 
      is Jesus.

                                    LENA
                    Really?  
                          (then)
                  Did Jesus talk you out of it?  Just 
                    because he doesn t want to -

      Jesus throws his hands up.

                                    JESUS
                  Don t look at me.

                                    MARIANA
                  No.  I just changed my mind, is all.

                                    LENA
                  Are you nervous?  Is that it?  You 
                  know I d be there with you, right?

      Mariana shakes her head again.

                                    LENA (CONT D)
                  Did something change?  I m just not 
                    understanding, Mariana...      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"10.


      Mariana gets up to get herself a cookie.

                                    MARIANA
                          (not unkindly)
                  Look, I just - I decided I m not 
                  ready, okay.  Can we please talk 
                  about something else?

      This doesn t ring entirely true to Lena, but she decides not 
      to push it for the moment.  

                                    LENA
                  Okay.  Well, let me know if you 
                  change your mind.



      Callie sits on the closed toilet with her knees pulled up 
      under her chin.  She stares into space, the first quiet moment 
      she s had in ages.

      There is a soft knock on the door.

                                    LENA (O.S.)
                    Callie?  You okay in there?

      Callie takes a deep breath and opens the door.



      Lena leads Callie back into the kitchen.

                                    LENA
                  Okay, guys, did everybody do their 
                    homework?

      Mariana nods.

                                    JESUS
                  Yeah.

      Lena doesn t quite believe him, shoots a look to Mariana.  
      Mariana shakes her head.

                                    JESUS (CONT D)
                  Man, why you gotta be like that?  
                  Just because you don t ever gotta 
                  study and you get all A s...

                                    LENA
                  We all have our strengths, Jesus.  
                  You heard your sister, get to it.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"11.


      Jesus makes a big show of being annoyed, gets up to head 
      upstairs, when Brandon wanders in, carrying his guitar.  He 
      slaps hands with Jesus, who uses the interruption to avoid 
      going to do his homework.

                                    BRANDON
                  Hey.

                                    LENA
                  How d it go?

                                    BRANDON
                  What?

                                    LENA
                  The music thing.

      Brandon locks eyes with Callie.  He s never seen anyone quite 
      like her - beautiful, but broken.

                                    LENA (CONT D)
                  How d it go?
                          (no answer)
                    Brandon. 

      Callie looks away, snapping Brandon back to reality.

                                    BRANDON
                  Oh - good, good.  I made the finals.

                                    LENA
                  What?  You did?  That s great!


                                      MARIANA/JESUS
                  Oh my God./Nice.

                                    BRANDON
                          (a little sheepish)
                  It s no big deal.

                                    LENA
                  It s a very big deal!  When are they?

                                    BRANDON
                    Tomorrow night.

                                    LENA
                  Oh, I can t wait.

      Brandon tries to deflect the attention, turns to Callie.

                                    BRANDON
                  So...  who s this?      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"12.


                                    LENA
                  Oh!  This is Callie.  She ll be 
                    staying with us for a while.

      Brandon looks to Lena.  This is surprising - and weird - news.  

                                    BRANDON
                  Like staying with us?  Really?  Wow.  
                  Okay.  Nice to meet you.

      Callie nods at him.  A beat.

                                    CALLIE
                  What about him?

      Lena is surprised that Callie is starting to open up a bit.

                                    LENA
                  What?

                                    CALLIE
                  What about him?  How d you get him?  
                          (then, a joke)
                    Amazon?

      Lena laughs, pleased.  This is going better than expected.

                                    LENA
                  Oh, Brandon is my -

      Just then, Stef strides in to the kitchen, STILL IN HER 
      UNIFORM, carrying her bag.

                                    LENA (CONT D)
                    - partner Stefanie s biological son.  
                  Hi, honey.

      Seeing Stef s uniform, Callie s blood goes cold.  She visibly 
      stiffens.  The twins both notice. 

                                    JESUS
                  You okay?
                          (then)
                  What?  Nobody told you our mom s a 
                  cop?

                                    MARIANA
                  See?  This is why no boys ever wanna 
                  come over.

                                    STEF
                  As it should be.
                          (then, to Lena)
                  Hey, babe.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"13.


      Stef kisses Lena.  Callie takes this in.  Her tone becomes 
      less jovial, more defensive.

                                    CALLIE
                  So you re dykes?

                                    JESUS
                  Um, they prefer the term  people,  
                  but yeah, they re gay.

      Stef clocks Callie, and looks around, perplexed.

                                    CALLIE
                  And he s the real son?

      This brings the conversation to a halt.  All the air gets 
      sucked out of the room.  Jesus lets the comment roll of his 
      back, but something in Callie s words hit Mariana where it 
      counts; she ices over instantly.  This pushes even friendly 
      Brandon back on his heels.  After an unbearable pause - 

                                    BRANDON
                            (territorially)
                  We re all their real children.

      Callie just nods - sure. 

                                    STEF
                  And who s this?

      Off Stef s tight smile...

                                        END OF ACT ONE      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"14.


                                        ACT TWO



      The other kids have gone to their rooms, leaving Callie alone 
      with Lena and Stef.  Stef explains the house rules.

                                    STEF
                  - and you don t leave the house 
                    without asking permission.  Also, 
                  you ll be going to school while 
                  you re staying here - 

      Callie is surprised to hear this, and is visibly more hostile 
      to Stef than to Lena.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"16.


                                    CALLIE
                  Why do I have to go to school?  It s 
                  not like I live here...

                                    STEF
                    Because you re not staying around the 
                  house all day.  Lena is the Vice-
                    Principal, and all the kids go to 
                  Riley, so you ll be fine.  Everybody 
                  leaves at 7:15, so lights out by -

                                    CALLIE
                          (cutting her off)
                  Where do I sleep?

                                    STEF
                  Excuse me?

                                    CALLIE
                  It s not my first time in a foster 
                  home.  Where do I sleep?

      Callie s attitude rubs Stef the wrong way.  She shoots a look 
      to Lena, who silently gestures for Stef to  breathe.   Stef 
      lets out a long sigh.  Lena whisks Callie away.

                                    LENA
                  Let me show you...



      Lena finishes making up the couch for Callie to sleep on.

                                    LENA
                  One pillow - or two?
                          (off Callie s shrug)
                  Okay, I ll leave them both.  It s 
                  just for tonight.  Tomorrow I ll move 
                  Jesus in with Brandon so you can have 
                  his room.  There s a bathroom just 
                  down the hall.  You have a 
                    toothbrush?

                                    CALLIE
                  I m not disgusting.  I have a 
                    toothbrush.

                                    LENA
                          (done with the attitude)
                  Okay, Callie?  We re on your side.  I 
                  know you ve had a rough time lately -  
                  but we re the good guys.  So you can 
                  take it down a notch.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"17.


      Callie looks down, then starts digging around in her backpack, 
      then realizes something.  She considers what to do.  Finally -

                                    CALLIE
                          (softer)
                  I need toothpaste.

      Lena smiles a little, to herself.  This is a breakthrough.

                                    LENA
                  Let me get you some.  And I ll grab 
                  you a towel, so you can take a 
                    shower, if you want.

      And Lena makes her way down the hall, then looks back to see  
      Callie standing there, clutching her canary yellow toothbrush 
      like a shiv.  Lena stops.

                                    LENA (CONT D)
                  You okay?

      Callie nods.

                                    LENA (CONT D)
                  You seemed pretty upset when you were 
                    talking to David earlier...

      Callie takes a breath, resolves to take Lena into her 
      confidence.  After a moment -

                                    CALLIE
                  Um, it s just - when they sent me to 
                  juvie -

      Just then Stef comes in from the kitchen.  Callie clams up.

                                    STEF
                  Got enough blankets?  Need anything?

      Callie doesn t say anything.  Lena shakes her head.  

                                    STEF (CONT D)
                  Okay.  Good night.

      Stef continues on upstairs.  Once she s gone - 

                                    LENA
                  You were saying?

      But Callie s moment of openness has passed.  

                                    CALLIE
                  You got that toothpaste?      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"18.


      Lena decides not to press her.  She smiles at her and 
      disappears down the hall.



      Mariana and Jesus lounge on the bed, talking in Spanish - 
      never a good sign.  Stef appears at the door.

                                    MARIANA
                          (in Spanish)
                  - I don t trust her, she s weird.

                                    STEF
                  Hey.  You know the rules - no using 
                    Spanish to talk behind people s 
                  backs.

      Mariana doesn t respond.

                                    STEF (CONT D)
                  You guys know it s not true, right?  
                  What Callie said.  You two are every 
                  bit as much our kids as Brandon.  

                                    JESUS
                  We know.

                                    LENA
                    Mariana?

      They look at Mariana, who puts on a smile and nods.  But Jesus 
      notices something in her expression - something unsettling.

                                    STEF
                  Okay.  Love you guys.  Lights out in 
                    fifteen.  Goodnight.



      Callie lets the steaming hot water of the shower run over her 
      bruised body.  She winces with the pain.



      Stef looks over Brandon s shoulder as he does his trigonometry 
      homework on his computer.

                                    STEF
                  You need to step up while Callie s in 
                  the house, okay?  I m counting on 
                  you.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"19.


      Brandon rolls his eyes, unsure what that means exactly.

                                    STEF (CONT D)
                  I m serious, Brandon.  Callie s a lot 
                  older than the twins were when they 
                  got here.  

                                    BRANDON
                  So?

                                    STEF
                          (thoughtfully)
                  So... just between us, Callie was in 
                  juvie for a little bit.  Okay?  

                                    BRANDON
                            (protective)
                  She was in - what the hell is she 
                  doing in our house, then?

                                    STEF
                  She s fine, just - keep your eyes 
                  open.  I m counting on you to... I 
                    dunno...

                                    BRANDON
                  Okay, I ll be sure to  I dunno  as 
                  much as I can.

                                    STEF
                  Are you sure you re not Lena s 
                    biological son?

                                    BRANDON
                  Mom.  I ve got homework to do.  MOBY 
                  DICK waits for no man.

      Stef shudders.  Brandon looks at her.

                                    STEF
                          (going for the dirty joke)
                  You said MOBY DICK.  Gave me 
                    flashbacks of your father.

                                    BRANDON
                  Uch, Mom!

                                    STEF
                    Speaking of MOBY DICK, do you need 
                    condoms?  You and Talya are using 
                  them, right?  

                                    BRANDON
                  Oh my God.  I m gonna kill you.  Go!      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"20.



      The house is dark and quiet.  Callie, her T-shirt and boxer 
      shorts clinging to her damp body, towel dries her hair.  After 
      a moment, she tosses the towel on the floor starts padding 
      around the room, looking at things, inspecting things - almost 
      like she s casing the place.

      She wanders over to the desk, looking for something specific.  
      She spots the base for the cordless telephone, but the 
      receiver s not there.  Damn.



      The phone receiver lays on the nightstand beside Stef, who is 
      already in bed, watching a rerun of FRIENDS.  Lena comes out 
      of the bathroom, rubbing lotion into her hands.

                                    LENA
                    Haven t you seen that one about a 
                    hundred times?

      Stef gets the message - Lena wants to talk.  She turns off the 
      TV, as Lena sits on the edge of the bed beside her.

                                    LENA (CONT D)
                  I m sorry.  I know we agreed once we 
                    adopted the twins that we weren t 
                  gonna foster again until Brandon was 
                  out of the house, but I just... 
                    Anyway, I get it.  I won t do it 
                  again.

                                    STEF
                  Thank you.  Please don t.  You keep  
                    bringing kids home and it s gonna be 
                  like the Brady Bunch in here.  
                          (then, after a laugh)
                  I know you only did it  cause you 
                    wouldn t have been able to sleep 
                    knowing there was some poor girl out 
                  there with no place to stay...

                                    LENA
                  There are lots of kids out there 
                    tonight, without a place to stay.

                                    STEF
                  Wait!  Come back from the dark place!  
                    Because of you and that big stupid 
                  heart of yours at least one of them 
                  is safe tonight.  It s fine.  
                    Everything is gonna be fine...      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"21.


      She pulls Lena down onto her chest, and the two women lie 
      there, still and quiet for the first time all day.  Then -

                                    LENA
                  Wanna hear something strange?  I told 
                  the twins that we would arrange a 
                    meeting with their birth mom like we 
                  talked about - and now neither one 
                  wants to do it.

                                    STEF
                    Really?  Not even Mariana?

                                    LENA
                  Nope.  She said she wasn t ready.

      A beat.  Stef lets out a long, slow breath.

                                    STEF
                  Good.

      Lena closes her eyes, and drifts off to sleep.  Stef goes back 
      to watching FRIENDS.



      Mariana is in the kitchen, looking for something in a cabinet 
      near the sink.  She grabs a PRESCRIPTION BOTTLE and empties 
      about half a dozen blue and red pills into her hand.  She puts 
      the bottle back, closes the cabinet and turns to see -

      - CALLIE STANDING THERE.  Mariana covertly slips the pills 
      into the pocket of her sweatshirt.  How long has Callie been 
      watching?

                                    MARIANA
                    I needed some water.

      Mariana brushes past Callie and heads upstairs - without a 
      glass of water.



      Callie tiptoes through the house in the dark, peering in 
      closets and lifting up everything that isn t nailed down - 
      touching it, to see what it is.  This place is foreign to her.

      She wanders down the hall and spies in to Jesus  room, where 
      he sleeps splayed across the bed, almost impossible to see 
      under the clothes and surf magazines.  Mariana s door is shut 
      tight.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"22.


      Then Callie comes to Brandon s room.  The lights are still on 
      and Callie watches through the crack in the door as the golden 
      boy, shirtless in his pajama bottoms, sits at his keyboard, 
      practicing intently, headphones on.  He keeps messing up a 
      chord progression, and is getting frustrated with himself - 
      but he doesn t stop.  He plays it again and again until he 
      finally gets it right.

      There s something almost erotic about the way Callie s looking 
      at him   like she s seeing some exotic animal in its natural 
      habitat.  Then she spots his CELLPHONE, charging on top of the 
      dresser beside the door.

      She holds her breath and reaches inside ever so carefully, 
      keeping her eyes locked on Brandon.  She tugs it free from the 
      wall and silently pulls it out the door.

      Brandon hears something, and pulls off his headphones.  He 
      turns around - but no one is there.



      But it s chaos inside.  Stef, in her uniform, fills a thermos 
      with coffee while Lena dishes up breakfast.  Brandon is still 
      busily doing homework, Jesus is riding his skateboard on the 
      hardwood floor, and Mariana is talking in Spanish to someone 
      on her cell.  Callie is conspicuously not present.

                                    STEF
                  Did you wake Callie up?

                                    LENA
                  Three times.  I ve been trying for 
                    half-an-hour.

                                    STEF
                    Unacceptable.

      Stef sighs, then gets an idea.  She grabs a glass, fills it 
      with cold water.

                                    LENA
                  What are you doing with that?

                                    STEF
                          (with a smirk)
                  I m thirsty.

                                    LENA
                    Stef....

      Jesus runs into one of the cabinets.

                                    LENA (CONT D)
                  Jesus!  Enough!  Have you taken your 
                    Ritalin?

      Lena opens a cabinet, grabs a bottle and pours a blue and red 
      pill into her hand.  She hands it to Jesus who swallows it 
      without water.

                                    LENA (CONT D)
                  Jesus, drink something.

      Jesus makes a big show of getting himself a glass.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"24.



      Stef strides into the living room where she finds Callie, or 
      rather a lump under the covers that she presumes to be Callie.

                                    STEF
                    Callie.

      Callie grumbles, rolls over.

                                    STEF (CONT D)
                    Callie, it s time to get up.

      Nothing.  Stef peels back the blanket over Callie s head - 
      then bit by bit POURS THE GLASS OF WATER ON HER.  Callie jumps 
      up, livid.  Callie s eye is still somewhat bruised but she 
      looks decidedly better.

                                    CALLIE
                  What the -

      Stef stands her ground, smiling.

                                    STEF
                  Next time Lena comes to wake you up - 
                  get up.  Breakfast is ready.  You re 
                    leaving in fifteen.

      And she heads back into the kitchen.  Callie glares at her as 
      she goes.  This place might be worse than juvie.



      Stef returns to the kitchen where the kids are scarfing down 
      oatmeal or cereal and Lena is eating a yogurt at the counter.  
      Lena notices Stef s empty glass and raises her eyebrows.

                                    STEF
                  She ll be in for breakfast shortly.

                                    LENA
                  What did you do?

                                    STEF
                  I have no idea what you re talking 
                  about.  

      Stef grabs her keys, kisses Lena on the forehead and heads out 
      the back door.

      After a moment, Lena notices that Stef forgot her thermos of 
      coffee.  She runs to the back door.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"25.


                                    LENA
                  Stef!  You forgot your...

      Too late - Stef is already pulling out of the driveway. 



      Brandon sits at the piano, his brow furrowed as he practices 
      his ORIGINAL COMPOSITION.  Callie meanders around the room, 
      touching things and half-listening.

                                    CALLIE
                  What is that?

      Brandon stops playing, slightly annoyed.

                                    BRANDON
                  What, the song?  I wrote it.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"27.


                                    CALLIE
                  You wrote it?  Really?

      Brandon nods.

                                    BRANDON
                  For the contest.  You have to play 
                  one classical piece and one original 
                    composition. It s about the night Mom 
                  and Mama asked me if it was okay for 
                  the twins to come and live with us. 

      Callie stares at Brandon for a moment.

                                    CALLIE
                  How is it  about  that?  It doesn t 
                  have words...

                                    BRANDON
                  Listen -

      He starts to play the simplest melody line from the piece.

                                    BRANDON (CONT D)
                  This is me.  And here -

      He adds two more chords on top of the phrase.

                                    BRANDON (CONT D)
                    - these are my moms.  And then this -

      And now the piece reaches its full resonance - five different 
      lines all working in unison.

                                    BRANDON (CONT D)
                  - this is all of us - me, mom, Lena, 
                  the twins.  See how it all works 
                  better together.

      Callie nods.  She gets it - sort of, anyway.  

                                    CALLIE
                  Nice.

      Brandon shrugs, a little embarrassed by his own geeky 
      enthusiasm.

                                    BRANDON
                    I dunno.  Now I kinda feel like it s 
                    missing something.

                                    CALLIE
                  I like it.
                          (then)
                                    (MORE)      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"28.

                                    CALLIE (CONT'D)
                  They asked you if the twins could 
                  move in?  What were you gonna say, 
                  No?  I bet you wanted to...

      Brandon smiles a little.

                                    BRANDON
                  Nah, I figured there was enough to go 
                    around. 

                                    CALLIE
                  Enough of what?

                                    BRANDON
                    I dunno.  Everything.

      This lands on Callie.  She s never had the privilege of 
      believing there was enough for everyone.

                                    BRANDON (CONT D)
                  It s a good thing I didn t.  Their 
                  mom s a total mess - she couldn t 
                  take care of herself much less two 
                  little kids.  

                                    CALLIE
                  At least they have a mom.

                                    BRANDON
                    Actually, they have two, now.

      Oh.  Right.

                                    BRANDON (CONT D)
                  But you - do you know your mom?  Is 
                  she - around?  Is she -

                                    CALLIE
                          (simply)
                  Dead.  She s dead.

      Brandon wasn t quite prepared for this response.

                                    BRANDON
                  Oh.  Sorry.

      Callie shrugs, smiles a little, shakes off his pity.  

                                    CALLIE
                  Don t be.  It is what it is.  

      Brandon s sense of Callie is changed in this moment - for the 
      better.  A little electricity passes between them.        "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"29.


      Just then, a GIRL S VOICE calls out from behind Brandon.

                                    GIRL (O.S.) 
                  Hey, baby!  Who s this?

      Brandon looks over, smiles at TALYA (16, beautiful, boho 
      chic), who is standing in the doorway.  Talya is the kind of 
      girl who isn t interested in how pretty she is, which makes 
      her surprisingly cool and fun to be around.

                                    BRANDON
                  Hey, Talya.  This is Callie.  
                          (beat)
                  She s staying with us for a while.

      Talya kisses Brandon on the mouth, then offers her hand to 
      Callie.

                                      GIRL/TALYA
                  Hey.  Welcome to Riley.

      Callie manages something that passes for a smile and shakes 
      her hand.

                                    CALLIE
                    Thanks.

      Talya wraps her arm over Brandon s shoulder.  A moment of 
      silence.  Brandon jumps in.

                                    BRANDON
                    Callie s gonna be in Timothy s class 
                  with you, T.  Can you show her where 
                  it is?

                                    TALYA
                  Yeah, sure, of course.  But we should 
                  go.  Timothy gets all parental when 
                  we re late.  And I don t wanna make 
                  him mad - I totally didn t do the 
                    reading last night, gonna have to 
                  wing it...

      And they head out the door, leaving Brandon alone with his 
      piano.



      Callie, Talya and about a DOZEN STUDENTS sit in big chairs in 
      a circle, where TIMOTHY (30s, hip) leads a discussion about 
      Kafka s METAMORPHOSIS.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"30.


                                    TIMOTHY
                  - but do you think he participated in 
                  his own transformation?  Did he will 
                  it?  Did he want it to happen?  Or 
                  did it happen to him?

      Talya looks over at Callie and winks.  Then she jumps in, even 
      though she has no idea what she s talking about.

                                    TALYA
                  Huh.  That s a really interesting 
                    question, Timothy.  Because, I mean, 
                  you could really argue it both ways.  
                  Did he want it to happen?  Or did it 
                  happen to him?  I totally see both 
                    sides...

      Callie laughs to herself, starts looking around the room.  The 
      BOY next to her shifts in his seat, and his HEAVY KEYCHAIN 
      jangles on the wood.  Callie looks at it, gets an idea.

      Timothy tries to engage her in the conversation.

                                    TIMOTHY
                  What about you, Callie?  I know you 
                    haven t read the material, but what 
                  would you do if you suddenly woke up 
                  and found yourself living a 
                    nightmare? 

                                    CALLIE
                          (without blinking)
                  If I was living a nightmare?

      Timothy s not quite sure what to say - neither is anyone else.



      Mariana sits at one of the school computers, logs on to her 
      Facebook account.  She goes straight to her messages, opens 
      one from someone named ANA GUTIERREZ.  It reads I M SO HAPPY 
      I M GOING TO GET TO SEE YOU.  CAN YOU MEET TONIGHT?

      Mariana looks at it for a long time, not sure exactly how to 
      respond.  After a long moment of going back and forth in her 
      head, she types YES.  AS LONG AS IT S AFTER DINNER.  MEET YOU 
      AT WESTERN HILLS PARK, AS SOON AS I CAN GET THERE.  She 
      presses send.

                                        ACT FOUR



      CAPTAIN ROBERTS (50s, fatherly) looks up from his desk as Stef 
      enters his office.  MIKE (almost 40, handsome, average joe) 
      stands off to one side.  Stef looks at him quizzically.

                                    CAPTAIN ROBERTS
                          (teasing her)
                  You okay?  You re not gonna start 
                  crying are you?

                                    STEF
                  With all due respect, Sir - screw 
                  you.

      Roberts laughs.

                                    CAPTAIN ROBERTS
                  Well, Vasquez was a pain in my ass, 
                  so as far as I m concerned, 
                    Sacramento can have him.  You re too 
                  good of a cop to be taking care of a 
                    hothead like that anyway. 
                          (then)
                  Now, since you re both partner-less, 
                    starting tomorrow I m gonna pair you 
                  up with Mike.  

      Stef s eyes get wide.

                                    STEF
                  Sir?

                                    CAPTAIN ROBERTS
                  That a problem?      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"36.


      Stef looks around, clearly taken aback.  She looks at Mike, 
      who explains.

                                    MIKE
                    I asked.  That cool?

      Stef considers this a moment, then...

                                    STEF
                  Sure.  No problem.  Sir.

                                    CAPTAIN ROBERTS
                  Good.  Take the rest of the day off, 
                  you guys can hit the beat tomorrow.

      Stef looks at Mike, something strange passing between them, 
      then back to the Captain.

                                    STEF
                    Yessir.



      Brandon and Callie sit tensely on the subway, Callie deep in 
      thought.  Brandon notices their knees are touching and looks 
      over at her.  Callie suddenly remembers something.  

                                    CALLIE
                  Don t you have that music thing 
                    tonight?

                                    BRANDON
                  It s just a - don t worry.  There ll 
                  be others.

      A beat.  She looks at him gratefully.

                                    BRANDON (CONT D)
                  So what happened?  In the house?

      Callie takes a breath.

                                    CALLIE
                          (matter of fact)
                    Well... 
                                    (MORE)      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"42.

                                    CALLIE (CONT'D)
                  my foster father caught my brother 
                    wearing one of his ex-wife s dresses, 
                  and started beating the crap out of 
                  him.

                                    BRANDON
                    Seriously?  He hit him?

      Callie nods, half-laughs.

                                    CALLIE
                  Um, yeah.  He used to hit me all the 
                  time, which, you know, whatever... 
                  But when I saw him going after Jude, 
                  I just went nuts.

      Brandon knows what it means to protect your siblings.

                                    CALLIE (CONT D)
                  So I got his baseball bat and whacked 
                  him on the knees.  And then I went 
                    outside and beat the hell out of his 
                  car.  When the cops came, he told 
                  them he was defending himself.  
                  Nobody seemed to care much about my 
                  side of the story.

                                    BRANDON
                  If he was so awful to you guys, why 
                  was he even a foster father in the 
                  first place?

      Callie looks at him with a knowing laugh.

                                    CALLIE
                  The money.  He doesn t have a job, 
                  so...

      Brandon is horrified to hear this.  After a moment, he places 
      his hand on her knee, as reassurance.  She looks down at it, 
      unsure what to do, as the train rockets through the city.



      Jesus flops across his bed, playing a surf game on his 
      computer.  Lena appears.

                                    LENA
                          (casually)
                  So - what s going on with Mariana?      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"43.


                                    JESUS
                          (playing dumb)
                    Whaddaya mean?

                                    LENA
                  Has she said anything to you?  Any 
                  idea what s up with her?

                                    JESUS
                    I dunno.  Maybe it s her time of the-

                                    LENA
                          (playfully)
                  If you say,  Time of the month,  I m 
                  going to sign you up for a Women s 
                  Health Workshop at Planned 
                    Parenthood.  Don t ever say that in a 
                  house full of women.  

                                    JESUS
                  Okay, fine.  Jeez.

                                    LENA
                  And you re sure you don t want to 
                  meet with Ana?  Don t you think it 
                  would be good to have some, um, 
                    cultural influences?  Someone to ask 
                  about your heritage?  I know for me 
                    growing up in a white neighborhood, 
                  it was really important to hear 
                  family stories and things.  Helped me 
                  feel less... out of place.

      He shrugs, shakes his head.  It s just not his thing.  Mariana 
      comes upstairs, listens from the hall.

                                    LENA (CONT D)
                  Well, if M says anything or you 
                  notice anything, let me know, okay?

      Mariana can t believe what she s hearing, gets furious.

                                    MARIANA
                  You want him to spy on me?
                          (then, in Spanish)
                  You might as well put me in juvie 
                  like Callie!

                                    LENA
                    Mariana...

      She storms into her room, slams the door.  Lena looks to 
      Jesus, who just laughs at her.  Stef s voice rings out from 
      downstairs.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"44.


                                    STEF (O.S.)
                  I m home!



      Stef is shoving some string cheese into her mouth, staring off 
      into space, when Lena descends upon her.

                                    LENA
                  So Mariana overheard me asking Jesus 
                  if something was going on with her 
                  and completely flipped out on me. 

                                    STEF
                  Okay.  We ll talk to her.  So listen -

                                    LENA 
                  You re gonna have to talk to her, 
                    because I swear I m going to lose it!  

                                    STEF
                  Okay, fine.  Can we get into this 
                  later?  I m not in a great mood - 
                  today was Vasquez s last day.

      Lena feels horrible, shifts gears.

                                    LENA
                  Oh.  Right.  I forgot.  You okay?

      Stef nods.

                                    STEF
                  And in other exciting news - guess 
                  who they re partnering me with now?

                                    LENA
                  Who?

                                    STEF
                  Mike.

      Lena actually falls speechless.  A beat. 

                                    STEF (CONT D)
                    I guess he asked for me.

                                    LENA
                          (not cool with this)
                    Uh-huh.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"45.


                                    STEF
                  Oh, God.  Don t go all non-verbal on 
                  me.  It s fine.

      It may be, but Lena is not.  Stef goes to the fridge, grabs 
      herself a beer.  The DOORBELL RINGS.  



      Lena opens the front door to reveal MIKE, still in his 
      uniform.  She looks at him dryly, raises an eyebrow.

                                    MIKE
                  Hey.  You guys ready?

                                    LENA
                    Brandon!  Your dad s here!  Time for 
                  your contest!

      No answer.  They wait an uncomfortable moment.

                                    LENA (CONT D)
                  He ll be down in a second.  I think 
                  he s nervous.  Brandon!

      The tension is so thick you would need a hacksaw to cut it.  

                                    LENA (CONT D)
                  So I hear you and Stef are gonna be 
                  back on the beat together.

                                    MIKE
                  Oh.  Yup.

                                    LENA
                            (territorially)
                  Stef said you asked for her?

      A breath, while Mike figures out how to explain.

                                    MIKE
                  Look, it was either me or some 
                    rookie.  I never felt comfortable 
                  when she was working with Vasquez.  I 
                  just - I feel better knowing I m 
                    around.  I mean, we ve got the kids 
                  to think about.

      Lena takes a deep breath of her own.  She s a little 
      embarrassed by her assumptions.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"46.


                                    LENA
                  Oh, okay.  Thanks.
                          (then, lightly)
                    I mean, the feminist in me is 
                    offended, but as her wife, you 
                    know... thanks.

                                    MIKE
                  Don t tell Stef I said that, okay?

      Lena shakes her head - of course not.  Another moment passes 
      between them.

                                    LENA
                  Mind if we take separate cars?  Stef 
                  and I can meet you there.

      He agrees.  Another beat.

                                    LENA (CONT D)
                  God, where is that kid?  

      Stef wanders in from the kitchen, nods at Mike.

                                    STEF
                    Brandon!  Let s go!  You re gonna be 
                  late!

      Jesus appears at the top of the stairs.

                                    JESUS
                  He s not here.

                                    STEF
                  Wait.  Where s Callie?

                                    JESUS
                    I haven t seen them since school.

      Stef and Lena share a concerned look.  This isn t like 
      Brandon.  

                                    STEF
                  So where the hell are they?



      Lena hangs up her cell.

                                    LENA
                  He s not answering.

      Jesus is there with Stef and Mike.

                                    LENA (CONT D)
                  Let me try Talya.  

      And she picks up her phone and steps away.  

                                    MIKE
                  Guys, I m sure he s fine.  Let s not 
                  freak out.  Maybe he thought we were 
                  gonna meet him over there?  At the 
                    contest?

      Maybe...

                                    MIKE (CONT D)
                  Why don t I head over there and 
                  check.

      Stef nods, and he heads out the door.  Then she gets an idea.

                                    STEF
                  Jesus - hand me my phone.

      He reaches across the counter and hands it to her.

                                    JESUS
                  Who you gonna call?

                                    STEF
                    Nobody.

      She starts up an app on her cell.

                                    STEF (CONT D)
                  I put that tracking app on all our 
                    phones, since you -
                          (to Jesus)
                  - are always leaving yours 
                    everywhere.

      Lena hangs up, rejoins the conversation.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"48.


                                    LENA
                  She says the last time she saw him he 
                  was talking to Callie before seventh 
                    period.  Maybe Mike s right - maybe 
                  we re over-reacting.

      Stef checks the screen in front of her

                                    STEF
                  If we re over-reacting - what are 
                  they doing in San Ysidro?

      A beat.  Nobody has an answer.  Stef shoots Lena an I-TOLD-YOU-
        THIS-WAS-A-BAD-IDEA look.

                                    LENA
                  Are they going to Tijuana?

                                    STEF
                  I m gonna kill him.  Where are my 
                  keys?

                                    JESUS
                  You want us to come?

                                    STEF
                  No, stay here with your sister.  
                  We ll be back soon.

                                    LENA
                  Don t forget to take your pill.  And 
                  finish your homework.

      And she and Lena take off.  Jesus opens one of the cabinets, 
      pulls out his bottle of Ritalin, opens it.  He dumps one into 
      his hand when he notices that there are VERY FEW LEFT.  



      Mariana watches out her bedroom window as Stef and Lena pull 
      out of the driveway.  She immediately grabs her purse and is 
      headed for the door when Jesus appears in the hall.

                                    JESUS
                    Brandon and Callie are missing...
                          (then)
                  Where are you going?

                                    MARIANA
                  What do you mean, missing?

                                    JESUS
                  They never came home from school.        "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"49.


                                    MARIANA
                  Oh.  Huh.  I guess Brandon went with 
                  her.

                                    JESUS
                  Where?

                                    MARIANA
                  She wouldn t tell me...

      Mariana is clearly trying to get out of her room, but Jesus 
      doesn t clear the door.

                                    JESUS
                  Hey - you didn t take any of my 
                    Ritalin, did you?

      Mariana freezes, just for a millisecond.

                                    MARIANA
                  What?  No, why?

                                    JESUS
                   Cause Mom just picked me up a new 
                    bottle, and now it s almost gone.

                                    MARIANA
                  What are you looking at me for?

                                    JESUS
                  I was just asking.

      She s avoiding eye contact with him.  But he s onto her.

                                    MARIANA
                  Well ask Brandon.  Or Callie.  Now 
                  excuse me, I gotta go.

      She tries to push past him into the hall, but Jesus stops her.

                                    JESUS
                  Is that how you got all that money?  
                          (then)
                  Are you selling my freaking pills?

                                    MARIANA
                  Wha-  No...

                                    JESUS
                   Cause Mama sure as hell didn t give 
                  you that big wad of cash.  Or did 
                  she?  Should I ask her?

      Her silence is the only confession he needs to hear.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"50.


                                    JESUS (CONT D)
                  Why?  Why would you do that?  It s so 
                  damn stupid.  What the hell do you 
                  need all that money for, anyway?

      A long beat.  Mariana decides to tell him the truth.

                                    MARIANA
                  I been talking to Ana.

                                    JESUS
                  Ana, our birth mom?

      Mariana nods.  Jesus can t believe what she s saying.

                                    MARIANA
                  She got back in town last month. 

                                    JESUS
                  Wait - what?  I thought you didn t 
                  want to meet her...

                                    MARIANA
                  No - I just didn t want Stef and Lena 
                    sticking their noses all up in my 
                    business, okay?  They wouldn t get 
                  it.  Ana needs some money.  I just 
                  want to help her out a little.

                                    JESUS
                  You re giving her money?  For what?

      Mariana shrugs.  He glances over to her desk, where she has a 
      FRAMED PHOTO of the two of them, at THREE YEARS OLD, sitting 
      on the lap of a WOMAN in her mid-twenties (who looks 
      remarkably like JENNIFER LOPEZ), all smiling radiantly.

                                    JESUS (CONT D)
                  Why?

                                    MARIANA
                    Whaddaya mean, why?   Cause she s our 
                  mom.

                                    JESUS
                  She s not our mom!  Our moms live 
                  here, in this house!  What the hell 
                  is wrong with you?

                                    MARIANA
                  I knew you wouldn t understand.  
                  That s why I didn t tell you.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"51.


                                    JESUS
                    Understand what?!  That woman is not 
                  our mom, Mariana.  She freaking 
                    abandoned us!  That woman -

      Jesus grabs the framed photo, RIPS open the back of the frame 
      and yanks out the picture.  He shoves it in Mariana s face.

                                    JESUS (CONT D)
                  This woman is not our mother.  She s 
                    a monster who left her two babies so 
                  she run off with some dumbass and 
                  screw whoever she wanted!  This. 
                  Woman. Is. Not. Our. Mother.

      And with every word, he tears the photograph into smaller and 
      smaller pieces.  

                                    MARIANA
                  Jesus, stop!

      But it s too late.  Mariana starts to cry, in spite of 
      herself.  It s obvious how much Ana represents to her.  

                                    JESUS
                    I thought you were supposed to be the 
                  smart one.

      As soon as he is gone, Mariana takes the pieces of the photo 
      and starts taping them back together, her heart as broken as 
      the picture.



      Stef drives as Lena stares out the window apprehensively.  
      Stef s phone rings.  Lena picks it up, looks at it, answers 
      it.

                                    LENA
                  Hey, it s Lena.

                                                                            INTERCUT



      Mike stands inside the auditorium, looking through the CROWD 
      for some sign of Brandon.

                                    MIKE
                  No sign of him here.  He hasn t 
                    checked in yet either.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"52.


                                    LENA
                  We tracked his phone.  He s in San 
                    Ysidro.  We were afraid they were 
                  headed to TJ but it doesn t look like 
                  it.  We re on our way now.  I ll call 
                  you as soon as I hear something.

      And she hangs up, the urgency filling the silence.



      Jesus is searching through Mariana s things, looking for 
      something.  He digs into the bottom of her backpack from 
      school, where he finds a baggie containing a few of his 
      Ritalin pills.  Damn.



      Stef and Lena drive Jude, Callie, and Brandon home in silence.  
      Stef places a comforting hand on Lena s leg.

      Callie is draped protectively around Jude.  Brandon stares at 
      her, more taken with this confounding creature than ever.  She 
      looks over at him with a soft smile.  Then something occurs to 
      him.

      Just then, Brandon s music begins to build, but this time 
      there is an ADDITIONAL LAYER - TWO new components adding to 
      the complexity of the piece.  It makes the sound richer, 
      darker even - but also more harmonious.  It s beautiful.  

      Brandon ever so SUBTLY PLAYS AN IMAGINARY KEYBOARD along with 
      the music.  He glows with satisfaction.



      Jesus pulls up Mariana s name on his cell phone, presses send.



      The SUV cruises down the boulevard, framed by palm trees and 
      the street lamps.      "THE FOSTERS: Pilot"60.
