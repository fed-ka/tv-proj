      FADE IN:

      INT. MIDVALE NURSING HOME - DAY

      TV SCREEN - ONSCREEN: Manhattan Cable is screwed up again.  

      On Turner, Jimmy Cagney s just taken one to the gut when the 
      picture judders, jerks and vanishes in a hurricane of flying 
      pixels...IMAGE FLICKS...to Mr. Ed who manages a brief 
       Wilbur  before he too suffers a bad case of digital 
        rash...IMAGE FLICKS...George Costanza clutches his head as he 
      remembers he missed Susan's birthday...in mid-kvetch we...

      REVERSE ON: A WOMAN'S FACE lit by a wall-mounted tube TV.  
      CARRIE WELLS, mid 30s, loose black curls, pale cheeks with a 
      hint of freckle.  What we most notice are her enormous 
      luminous violet eyes...intensely focused, hyper-alert...as 
      they drink in the parade of old comedies and dramas...

      Carrie's fiddling with the TV, trying to get a clear channel.  

                                  ALICE (O.S.)
                    Would you move, please?  I can t 
                    see.

      Carrie turns to ALICE, late 60s, one of several older women 
      and men seated in a lounge area.  Alice is a good ten years 
      younger than the other residents, which makes the severity of 
      her early onset Alzheimer s all the more tragic.

                                  CARRIE
                    Nothing to see you haven t seen 
                    before, Alice.

                                  ALICE
                    Are you new here?

      As she plumps Alice s cushions:

                                  CARRIE
                    Nah, you and me go way back. 

      An OLDER MAN is quarreling with an attendant, GIDEON, 30s, 
      African.

                                  MAN
                    I told you already, I took the 
                    Hyzaar.  I take it again, I have to 
                    go and go, I m always going.                                                                                      2.


                                  GIDEON
                    Let s ask Carrie, she never gets it 
                    wrong.  
                          (to Carrie)
                    Mr. Wanamaker says he already took 
                    his meds for the day.  What do you 
                    think?

      Carrie pretends to be thinking hard.

                                  CARRIE
                    Well, Mr. Wanamaker, you took your 
                      Ependramine, two pills, ten 
                      milligrams, this morning at eight 
                    forty eight and had three Chloracid 
                    twenties at one fifteen.  That 
                    would make you due for two more 
                    Hyzaar right about...now.

      Gideon smiles.  The old man nods reluctantly.

                                  GIDEON
                          (to Carrie)
                    You know you re good at this.  If 
                    you ever want a job.

                                  CARRIE
                    I have a job.   fact, tonight I 
                    think I'll ask for a little raise.

                                  GIDEON
                    Good luck.

                                  CARRIE
                    Luck?  Who said anything about 
                    luck?

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

      INT. WAREHOUSE CASINO - RED HOOK - NIGHT

      Roulette wheels, poker tables and, of course, blackjack.   
      Which is where we find Carrie, almost unrecognizable in a 
      clingy black dress and spike heels.  Carrie has her winnings 
      in cash stacked high beside her.  Her demeanor is relaxed, 
      professionally nonchalant.  But her eyes instantly catalogue 
      each card played.  Of course, she wins again...

      Suddenly there's a hand on her shoulder.  It belongs to a big 
      meaty guy, JERRY, 40s, Russian.

                                  JERRY
                    Norman would like to talk to you.                                                                                      3.


                                  CARRIE
                    Can Norman wait a minute?  I m 
                    doing really great here.

                                  JERRY
                    That s what he d like to talk to 
                    you about.  

      Jerry pulls Carrie up by the arm, sweeps her winnings off the 
      table, steers her toward a door in the back.

      INT. WAREHOUSE CASINO - BACK ROOM - LATER

      Carrie's in a chair, being grilled by the club owner, NORMAN, 
      30s, Adam Goldberg-ish.  Beside him, the muscle, Jerry and 
      another thug, ISAAC, 30s, also late of Belarus.

                                  NORMAN
                    There s lowlifes, and lower lifes, 
                    then there s card counters.
                          (to Jerry, quickly)
                    Lemme hear it, lemme hear...

                                  JERRY
                    Karty proteevodyestely.

                                  NORMAN
                    Beautiful language, I love it.
                          (back to Carrie)
                    The point is, you re famous, lady.  
                    You were thrown outta the Bel-Air, 
                    the Mexicana and the Atlantic 
                    Aladdin, which is a nice place, for 
                    doin  the same thing.  

      Norman takes out a HUGE AUTOMATIC, lays it on the desk.

                                  NORMAN (CONT D)
                    So.  Gimme my money back.  Give it 
                    back now.  And we re done.  Or 
                    maybe you d like to add some 
                    interest?  I know what interests 
                    me.   

      He leers at Carrie s legs, licks his lips.  His guys GIGGLE.  

                                  CARRIE
                    That s sweet.  Okay, I was at the 
                    Aladdin a couple of weeks ago.  
                          (she indicates Isaac)
                    He knows, he was there too.  
                    Palling around with some big bald 
                    guy, scar across his left cheek, no 
                    pinky?                                                                                      4.


      Isaac, who s been smiling, freezes.  Norman turns to him.

                                  NORMAN
                    Milosz?  The hell you doin  with 
                    Milosz?  Isaac?  

                                  ISAAC
                    She is lying.  It wasn t me.

                                  CARRIE
                    Sure it was.  You had on that 
                    leather jacket, brown, with the 
                      buttons...

                                  NORMAN
                          (to Isaac)
                    The Varvatos?  I gave you that 
                    jacket.  And two weeks ago you told 
                    me you took your dad to 
                      Cooperstown.

                                  ISAAC
                    Norm, think about it.  Why would I 
                    be with Milosz?  He is jerk-off...

                                  CARRIE
                            (innocently)
                    Maybe I can help?  You were talking 
                    about Bay Ridge.  Something about 
                    container tracks...trucks maybe?

                                  NORMAN
                    You told that schmuck about Bay 
                    Ridge?

                                  ISAAC
                    I never talked to the guy, I swear!

                                  NORMAN
                          (to Jerry)
                    How you say,  Izzy s sweating too 
                    much? 

      Isaac turns and sprints out the door.

                                  NORMAN (CONT D)
                          (to Jerry)
                    GO!

      When Norman turns back to Carrie, she s holding his gun.

                                  NORMAN (CONT D)
                    C mon, sweetheart, put the big gun 
                    down, you don t know how to use it.                                                                                      5.


      Wrong.  Carrie expertly slides out the clip, examines the 
      bullets and snaps it back in. She motions Norman to sit. He 
      does.

                                  CARRIE
                    Now stay there for a while.

      She sweeps up her money and is out the back door.

      EXT. WAREHOUSE CASINO - RED HOOK - CONTINUOUS

      Carrie emerges into a back alley, tosses the gun in a 
      dumpster, races down toward a busy street.  She finds a taxi 
      letting someone off at the club and hops in.

      INT. TAXI - CONTINUOUS

      Carrie throws herself back against the seat, heart pounding.   
      She steadies her breath, gives the CABBIE a Long Island City 
      address.  He nods, peels out.  The car's speakers are 
      BLASTING the Eurythmics, Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This).  

                                  CARRIE
                          (quickly, to cabbie)
                    Could you turn it down...?

      Too late.  As we've already guessed, Carrie has a great 
      memory.  How great, we're about to learn.  It s more than 
      just a knack for names and numbers - Carrie never forgets 
      anything.  Every detail of every place she's ever been, every 
      word of every conversation she's shared or overheard is still 
      there, waiting to be accessed - to be rebuilt into a virtual 
      memory-world.  

      But like a genie, Carrie s memory can be wild and 
      unpredictable.  Sometimes - when she s tired or frightened - 
      the memory-worlds rebuild themselves... 

      As Annie Lennox's dark contralto slides from the speakers...

      EXT. SYRACUSE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - 1983 - DAY

      ...daylight sweeps across Carrie's cab.  The car's hood, 
      roof, windows, doors are torn away as if by a tornado...grass 
      springs up and carpets the Brooklyn asphalt...the old 
      warehouses lining Conover Street collapse into lush stands of 
      Norway maples and honey locusts.  We're outside a two-story 
      brick school building in Syracuse NY.  It's October 14th, 
      1983, 8:21 a.m.  A passing Sanitation Truck's blares the 
      Eurythmics.  We rocket from the cab of the truck through an 
      open window...                                                                                      6.


      INT. SYRACUSE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS

      ...into a fourth grade classroom...to the ear of nine-yr-old 
      Carrie who stands shyly beside her TEACHER'S desk.  Her 
      teacher is staring at her.  So are her fellow students.  

                                    TEACHER
                    Carrie, when I asked you to learn 
                    something from Romeo and Juliet, I 
                    didn't mean for you to memorize the 
                    entire play.  

      The KIDS snicker.  Little Carrie turns red.

      INT. TAXI - RESUME

      The cab driver's in a fickle mood.  He punches a button.  
      [NOTE: Carrie's memories only last five to ten seconds each.]  
      In the back seat, Carrie flinches...

      INT. SYRACUSE HIGH SCHOOL - 1990 - DAY

      ...and memory-trips to a 1990 high school hallway where a 
      group of GIRLS are taunting her at her locker, CHANTING 
      Sinead O'Connor, Nothing Compares To You.  Carrie slams the 
      locker door, turns to confront her tormentors...  

      INT. TAXI - RESUME

      The driver punches in Hot 97...Carrie jolts...

      EXT. SYRACUSE ALLEY - 1997 - NIGHT

      ...and the memory-tornado tears away 1990.  We're in an alley 
      in 1997 Near West Side Syracuse.  A BOOMBOX is BLASTING 
      2Pac's Toss It Up.  Carrie, now 23, is in full police blues, 
      her Glock 22 trained on a huge Man in who lies at her feet.  

                                  CARRIE
                    I said BEHIND your head!  NOW!  

      INT. TAXI - RESUME

      Another button, another song.  Missing, Everything but the 
      Girl...

      EXT. LAKE BEACH - 1996 - DAY

      ...PLINKS softly from Carrie s battered yellow Sony Sport CD 
      player...July 21, 1996, 2:05 P.M...Green Lake State 
        Park...while she lounges in a beach chair...fingers trailing 
      in the hot sand...a MAN's hands massaging her shoulders.  We 
      can't see his face, but his voice is low and deep:                                                                                       7.


                                  MAN (O.S.)
                    You have a nice neck.

                                  CARRIE
                    So I ve been told.

                                  MAN (O.S.)
                    Did you know there's a nerve right 
                    under your levator scapula that 
                    leads all the way down to the 
                    pelvic floor?

                                  CARRIE
                          (chuckle)
                    Given the circumstances, I think 
                    that's the dirtiest thing I've ever 
                    heard.

      The man LAUGHS.

      INT. TAXI - RESUME

      Carrie smiles.  The driver punches in a jazz station.  

                                  CARRIE
                    Hey!  Leave it on, willya?  It s a 
                    good song.

      The driver shrugs, switches back to Missing.  Carrie leans 
      back in her seat...in her beach chair...lets long-vanished 
      hands work her tired muscles...

      EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

      Carrie slides from the cab, starts down the street.  She 
      hears something - a Couple exiting the late night GREEK DELI 
      across the street...LAUGHING, arm in arm...

      TIGHT ON: Carrie.  Their easy companionship s a far cry from 
      her own life.  

      She turns and enters her building.

      INT. CARRIE S APARTMENT - NIGHT

      Dressed in a pair of baggy pajamas, Carrie climbs into bed.  
      As she does, we notice the walls of her bedroom are 
      completely bare.  She picks up a stack of postcard-sized 
      photos from a night table and flips through them.  It's a 
      falling-asleep ritual: she finds an image that represents a 
      peaceful memory and fixes her attention on it.  

      She picks a PHOTO of an Adirondack meadow.  Gives it her full 
      attention.                                                                                        8.


      As she does, we PUSH IN on the photo till the meadow fills 
      the entire frame.  Carrie's eyelids droop and finally fall.  
      FADE TO BLACK.

      OVER BLACK: SOUNDS, at first soft, as if from far 
      away...growing closer...louder...ANGRY VOICES...furniture 
      being KNOCKED AROUND...a WOMAN'S SCREAM...a door BANGING 
        OPEN...footsteps POUNDING DOWN a short staircase...

      Carrie's eyes flash open.  The footsteps ECHO down a hallway.  
      O.S., a distant door SLAMS.  Carrie runs to the apartment 
      door, flings it open. 

      INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

      The hallway carpet and walls are streaked with blood.  Carrie 
      charges down the hall, tears open the inner door into the 
      mailbox vestibule, then the outer, into the night.

      EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT

      Struggling poplars lit by bare bulbs cast shadows across the 
      entrance courtyard.  A dozen steps from Carrie, a WOMAN is 
      lying face down in her own shadow...which seems to grow 
      ominously beneath her...  

      Carrie runs to her, kneels.  The woman's been stabbed 
      repeatedly.  There's blood everywhere.  Carrie reaches to 
      check for a pulse.  As she does, in a FLASH she sees...

      EXT. WOODS - DAY

      ...a YOUNG GIRL, maybe 12, standing at the edge of a DARK 
      FOREST, hands planted firmly on hips, a disapproving smirk on 
      her face:  

                                  YOUNG GIRL
                    Carrie, will you come on, there s 
                    no bears in the woods...!

      EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT - RESUME

      Carrie recoils, GASPS.  Gasps again when she realizes 
      someone's standing beside her... 

      It's a MAN, 60's, in a flannel bathrobe.  A neighbor.  
      Staring at the woman's body in horror.

                                  CARRIE
                          (collecting herself)
                    Call the police.

                                          END TEASER                                                                                      9.


                                            ACT ONE

      EXT./INT. CRIME SCENE/ - DAWN

      Police cars, lights flashing, parked in front.  Uniforms have 
      taped off the courtyard area.  CSI folk photographing and 
      collecting.  Neighbors and lookiloos milling around.  Carrie 
      is finishing up an interview with a young Detective outside 
      the door of her building. 

                                  CARRIE
                    A few of the neighbors had come 
                    down too by then.  I think one of 
                    them called the police.

                                  DETECTIVE
                    And this was at what time?

                                  CARRIE
                    I m not a hundred percent sure, I 
                    think I...

      Carrie s eyes widen as she notices...

      ...NYPD Detective First Class AL BURNS, late 30s, emerge from 
      a sedan and stride across the courtyard.  He still moves like 
      the high school jock he was back in Syracuse.  He's always 
      going forward, life is to be lived, not dwelled upon.

                                  CARRIE (CONT D)
                          (flustered)
                    Sorry, I, uh...

      She subtly shifts her position so she is blocked by the 
      detective.

                                  CARRIE (CONT D)
                    ...I only looked at my watch later.  
                    Probably around three thirty...

      Across the courtyard, Al s met and filled in by Detective 
      MIKE COSTELLO, late 30s, Yonkers to Queens by way of the 3rd 
      Marines, Desert Storm.

                                  MIKE
                    Got a Catherine Grant, early 30 s 
                      Caucasian.  Looks to be a stabbing. 
                    According to the building manager, 
                    she s been a tenant three months.  
                    She paid her rent pretty regular, 
                     nice quiet girl.   His words.

                                  AL
                      Witnesses?                                                                                    10.


                                  MIKE
                    Nada.  Most the other tenants 
                    asleep, lady downstairs heard some 
                    kinda fight, came out, found the 
                    body.  Roe s finishing up with her 
                    now.

      He nods to where Carrie is being interviewed by the man we 
      now know to be Detective Second Class ROE SAUNDERS, mid 20s, 
      the junior member of our squad.  Al glances over, but

      AL S POV: Roe is blocking Carrie.

                                  AL
                    Weapon?

                                  MIKE
                    Uniforms looking.  Nothing so far.

      CARRIE AND ROE

      Carrie s eager to finish.

                                  CARRIE
                    That s really all I know.

                                  ROE
                    Thanks.  I m gonna give you my 
                    card.  Call if you think of 
                    anything else.

      Carrie takes the card and heads quickly back into the 
      building.  Roe moves over to Al and Mike.

                                  AL
                    Sorry to get you up so early.

                                  ROE
                    Always here for you, boss.

      They head into the building.

      INT. APARTMENT FOYER - CONTINUOUS

      Blood stains have been marked off on the floor.

                                  MIKE
                    Front door s locked, but someone 
                    coulda buzzed in a stranger.

                                  AL
                    Might not be a stranger.  Let s run 
                    all the tenants, get the list 
                    from...                                                                                    11.


                                  ROE
                    From the manager, already doing it.

                                  AL
                    You are here for me, Roe.

      As they head across the foyer, Al nods up to a

      RUSTY SECURITY CAMERA

                                  AL (CONT D)
                          (to Mike)
                    Whad'ya think, Christmas come early 
                    this year?

                                  MIKE
                    You musta been naughty, chief.  
                    Camera s been out for three weeks.  
                    Landlord was gonna replace it, but 
                    the neighborhood s getting so much 
                    safer. 

                                  AL
                    Someone wanna tell Catherine Grant.

      INT. CATHERINE GRANT S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

      The three detectives step into the victim s apartment.  More 
      Techs.  Photographers.  Sparsely furnished one-bedroom.  
      Living room dominated by a thirty-two inch FLAT-SCREEN with 
      DVD/DVR combo hooked-up and a few DVD cases scattered about.  
      A small dining table, lamp, and chair have all been knocked 
      over, lying beside another blood stain on the carpet.  Some 
      paperbacks fallen from a shelf.

      Detective NINA INARA, mid 20s, separates from a Uniform, and 
      heads over.  Nina s got lotsa smarts and lotsa ambition - a 
      local girl, born in Rockaway Park, she left her girlfriends 
      at Stella Maris H.S. far behind -- one of the youngest cops 
      ever to make Detective. 

                                  NINA
                    No forced entry.  Handbag and 
                    wallet still up on the shelf. About 
                    eighty bucks. If he was after 
                      something, wasn t money.

                                  AL
                    Or she resists, he gets scared, 
                    sticks her and runs.

      Mike comes over with Catherine s wallet.                                                                                    12.


                                  MIKE
                    Take a look.  Catherine Grant on 
                    the lease, right?  
                          (holds up a plastic card)
                      Supermarket card, says Catherine 
                    Issacs.

                                  NINA
                    Married name.  An ex?

                                  MIKE
                    What I thought.  Except...
                          (another card)
                      ...expired driver s license, under 
                    Gail Issacs.

      Okay, things just got a little strange. 

      INT. CARRIE S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

      Whatever it means, Carrie was definitely agitated by seeing 
      Al.  She throws on a coat, opens her door to go, but stops 
      when she sees a Uniform coming down the stairs.  Carrie 
      retreats back into her apartment.

      INT. CATHERINE GRANT S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

      Al and Mike are looking around the room as Roe steps up.

                                  ROE
                    They got a few sets of prints.  
                    Mostly partials.  But better 
                    still...
                          (holds up a baggie)
                    ...we got a cellphone.  Maybe find 
                    some friends or family.

                                  AL
                          (a little doubtful)
                    I hope so.  

      He bends down to pick up a paperback.

                                  AL (CONT D)
                    Friends and family usually end up 
                    on the fridge.  Nothin  there, no 
                      knickknacks, snapshots from the 
                    past, phone numbers.  And her 
                    books, all romance novels.
                          (takes in the apartment)
                    This was a lonely woman.

                                  MIKE
                    I got nothing on my fridge.                                                                                    13.


                                  AL
                    My point.  You should get out more.

      Al notices something on the kitchen counter, a

      BUTCHER BLOCK KNIFE SET.

      Al checks out the few knives.

                                  ROE
                    What, ya think he put the weapon 
                    back?

                                  AL
                    It s what s not here.  Most popular 
                    knife there is.  Eight inch chef s 
                    knife. 

                                  MIKE
                    Weapon of convenience.  Means he 
                    didn t come to kill her.

                                  ROE
                      Consistent with what I got.  Lady 
                     found the body says it started as 
                    a fight, the guy got her once 
                    upstairs, she takes off, he 
                    follows, finishes her outside.

                                  AL
                    Gotta love CSI.  Everybody s an 
                    expert now.  She say how she came 
                    up with that scenario?

                                  ROE
                    No. But you can ask her yourself...
                          (checks his pad)
                    ...C. Wells. One-eighteen.

      That gets Al s attention.

                                  AL
                    What s the name?

                                  ROE
                    Carrie Wells.

                    What d she look like?

                                  ROE
                    Mid thirties.  Dark hair.  Pretty.                                                                                    14.


                                  AL
                    That all?

                                  ROE
                    She looked like a witness, Al.

                                  AL
                    I think I ll go talk to her.

      He starts out.  Roe takes a step to follow.

                                  AL (CONT D)
                    I m okay.

                                  ROE
                      I thought, `cause I did the 
                      initial...

                                  AL
                    I said I m okay.

      He goes.  Roe and Mike exchange looks.

                                  ROE
                    He and Elaine gotta get engaged.  I 
                    think the tension s getting to him.

      INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

      Al heads down the hallway, pauses in front of Carrie's 
      apartment.  He's about to knock - hesitates, his knuckles 
      inches from the door.  What's he actually gonna say if it's 
      her?

      EXT./INT. CARRIE S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

      Carrie's inside, just on the other side of the door.  She's 
      really hoping he doesn't knock - or maybe, that he does.   
      The RAP of Al's knuckles sets off an involuntary memory...

      INT. SYRACUSE HOUSE - DAY

      Carrie's house, Syracuse, the broiling summer of 1998.  Al 
      POUNDING on one side of the door, Carrie adamant on the 
      other...

                                  AL
                    Carrie, honey, open the door, open 
                    the door, I can explain...

                                  CARRIE
                    You slept with her, Al, I don t 
                    need to hear why...                                                                                    15.


                                  AL
                    It s not what you think, I love 
                    you...

                                  CARRIE
                    Shut up, just go away...

      Al hits the door with an open palm.

                                  AL
                    You listen to me.  Listen to me!  I 
                    try - I have tried with all my 
                    heart to love you, but you won t 
                    let me... 

                                  CARRIE
                    Now it s my fault...??

                                  AL
                    You won t let anybody!  You re 
                    alone, you re stuck and you won t 
                    let anybody help you...

                                  CARRIE
                    I don t need your help...

                                  AL
                    You re a freak, Carrie!   You know 
                    that!  You need me.  You need 
                    people!  Carrie?  Carrie??

      He slams the door with a final blow.  Carrie flinches.

      EXT./INT. CARRIE S APARTMENT - RESUME

      Al's second quiet KNOCK takes Carrie out of her memory.  She 
      opens the door.  

                                  CARRIE
                    You don t have to break it down.  I 
                    heard you.  

                                  AL
                    Nice to see you too.  

      They stare at each other.  Al and Carrie were always the two 
      smartest kids on the block, and the ribbing, the one-upping, 
      the flirting, were as natural as breathing.  They still are.

                                  AL (CONT D)
                    May I enter?

                                  CARRIE
                    Depends.  You have probable cause?                                                                                    16.

                    What the hell are you doing here?

                                  CARRIE
                    I live here.  What are you doing 
                    here?

                                  AL

                    around, ask questions, you remember 
                    how that works...   

                                  CARRIE
                    I mean, what are you doing in New 
                    York?

                                  CARRIE
                    You were always driven, Al.

                                  AL
                    Look who s talkin .

                                  CARRIE
                    Oh I gave that up.

      Al glances around at the bare walls.

                                  AL
                    I can tell. 

                                  CARRIE
                    So, married?  With children?

                                  AL
                      Girlfriend.

                                  CARRIE
                    Not Linda Perini.

                                  AL
                    C mon, that was never anything...

                                  CARRIE
                    Enough to end a relationship.

                                   AL
                    That s not why it ended.                                                                                    17.


                                  CARRIE
                    No, it s because I m a freak.  
                          (off Al)
                    Don t look at me, you said it.

                                  AL
                      What...when?.

                                  CARRIE
                    Lemme see.  August 14th, 1998...

                                  AL
                    I never said that...

                                  CARRIE
                    Around two thirty...four.  Hot 
                    night, no rain.  There were 
                      crickets...? 

                                  AL
                    Okay, okay, I didn t mean it.  I 
                    was angry, I was frustrated, I 
                    was...

                                  CARRIE
                      Insensitive?  And I m too 
                      sensitive.  Ta-dah.  

      Sounds about right.  Truce.  

                                  AL
                    Look, can you help me here?  
                    Catherine Grant?  216.  

                                  CARRIE
                    Like I told freshface, I heard the 
                    fight, went outside, found the 
                    body.  Checked her vitals, made 
                    sure someone phoned it in.  That s 
                    it.  

      He nods, fishes in his pocket.  

                                  AL
                    Okay.  My card.  Work number.

                                  CARRIE
                    Oh, please.   

                                  AL
                    Call me if you think of anything.

                                  CARRIE
                    Why else would I call?                                                                                      18.


      He turns to go.

                                  CARRIE (CONT D)
                    Apology accepted, by the way.

      He goes.  She slumps against the wall.  What the hell's going 
      on?  First the murder, then the memory in the woods - my God, 
      that memory - then Al.  Start of a perfect day. 

      INT. 108TH PRECINCT - DETECTIVE S BULLPEN - DAY

      An open collection of small working areas surrounding a 
      conference table.  Nina, Mike, and Roe all have desks out 
      here.  Mike, with his softball trophies, family photos and 
      postcards, has clearly been here the longest.  The Junior 
      detectives  desks have less history.   Roe s is cluttered 
      with reports; Nina s, impeccably neat.

      Catherine s photo and the few leads they have are posted on a 
      cork case board.  Beside them, a crude timeline of known 
      events surrounding the murder.  Catherine s aliases are 
      listed with question marks beside them. 

      Al s staring at the board.

                                  NINA (O.S)
                    She had lotsa pay stubs from temp 
                    agencies.  Mostly secretarial 
                    stuff.  I m thinking...

                                  AL
                    What about her last place of work?

                                  NINA
                    You just asked me that.  We ll find 
                    it.

      Caught off guard thinking about Carrie, Al covers.

                                  AL
                    Yeah, yeah, go on.  She was 
                    temping, so what else?

                                  NINA
                    Nothing yet.  But something must ve 
                    come her way pretty recently.  Her 
                    bank records show about a thousand 
                    bucks a week going in for the last 
                    three months...in cash.

      Mike enters.

                                  AL
                    Drugs maybe.                                                                                    19.


                                  MIKE
                    Prob ly not.  Just got the 
                    coroner s report.  Tox scan was 
                    clear.  He confirms cause of death 
                    as multiple stab wounds to the 
                    chest and abdomen.  Consistent with 
                    -- thank you, boss -- an eight inch 
                    chef s knife.  Good news is we got 
                    some hair from under her 
                      fingernails.  Doin  a DNA work up.

                                  AL
                    Help if we had a suspect to match 
                    it to.  Anything from her phone?

                                  MIKE
                    I m getting the records.  

                                  NINA
                    Here s what s bugging me.  I m 
                    putting together a personality 
                    profile and I swear, Catherine 
                    Grant, Catherine Isaacs, whatever 
                    her name is - it s like she s got 
                    no past.  No journals, no old 
                    letters, no photos.  Not even a 
                    snow globe from some stupid 
                    vacation somewhere. Bank account s 
                    two years old.  Mail goes to a box 
                    at one of those shipping stores...

      A young Cop enters, puts a folder down in front of Mike.  He 
      flips through it.  

                                  NINA (CONT D)
                    If she s leaving tracks, I can t 
                    find em.  

                                  AL
                    Maybe that s the point.

      Mike looks up from the folder he just was handed.

                                  MIKE
                    Okay, we got a hit on her prints.  
                    As  Jennifer Goodwin  this time, 
                    arrested for prostitution, 1993. 

                                  NINA
                    `93?  Jesus, she must ve been a 
                    kid.                                                                                    20.


                                  MIKE
                    Might explain the cash.  She s back 
                    in business. 

                                  AL
                    Just get me the last place she 
                    temped.  I want to find someone who 
                    knows this woman.

                                  ROE (O.S.)
                    Maybe we already have.

      The young detective enters in a hurry.

                                  ROE (CONT D)
                    Those unidentified prints we found 
                    in her apartment, one of em belongs 
                    to the neighbor  C. Wells 118. 
                          (to Al, pointedly)
                    Mid thirties, dark hair.  Pretty.

                                  NINA
                    She said she barely knew the vic, 
                    right?

                                  MIKE
                    Why is she even in the system?

                                  ROE
                      Interesting question.  Turns out 
                    Carrie Wells s prints track back to 
                    a badge on the Syracuse P.D, 1996 
                    to 2000.  She was a cop.  

      All eyes turn to Al.  Roe says what everyone s thinking.

                                  ROE (CONT D)
                    Syracuse P.D.  That s your old 
                    haunt, Al.  Isn t it?

      Off Al...

      INT. MIDVALE NURSING HOME - LATER THAT DAY

      Carrie's in the dayroom, helping a resident finish his 
      brownie and applesauce.  Gideon passes, smiles.  

                                  GIDEON
                    How d it go last night?
                          (off Carrie)
                    Your luck?

                                  CARRIE
                    It sorta ran out.                                                                                    21.


      She hears a GIGGLE, turns.  

        A forty-something Man with two LITTLE GIRLS is visiting his 
      mother.  One of the girls glances over at Carrie...  

      Carrie takes a breath.  

      EXT. WOODS - DAY

      A carpet of twigs and fallen leaves rolls down the dayroom 
      floor, the ceiling drywall peels back revealing a soaring 
      canopy of trees...broken sunlight lances through high 
      branches...the CAMERA REVERSES and where Carrie was sitting, 
      a red-faced GIRL of eight - young Carrie - now stands.  She's 
      breathing hard, terrified, searching.   

                                  YOUNG CARRIE
                          (crying out)
                      Rachel...RACHEL!!  Where are you?  
                    Rachel, PLEASE...!

      INT. MIDVALE NURSING HOME - RESUME

      TIGHT ON Carrie.  Stunned.

                                  GIDEON (O.S.)
                    You okay?  Carrie?

      The little girl who looked at Carrie turns away.  That seems 
      to break the spell.  Carrie rises unsteadily.

                                  CARRIE
                          (to Gideon)
                    Can you take over here?  I need a 
                    break.

      Gideon nods.  Carrie s shaken to her bones, struggles to 
      regain her cool.  It's not just the nature of the memory.  
      She's never had the memory before... 

                                  AIDE (O.S.)
                    Carrie?

      It s a round-faced Nurse s AIDE, 20 s.  

                                  AIDE (CONT D)
                    Excuse me.  There s a policeman 
                    wants to talk to you.

      Carrie looks.  It s Al.  Brilliant timing.

      Carrie s pissed.  How the hell did he know about Midvale?  
      Well, better anger than the terror of those woods...                                                                                    22.


                                  CARRIE
                    The plan was, I call you, remember?

                                  AL
                    Yeah, well I also remember, you 
                    don t call.  

                                  CARRIE
                    You want a juice box?  How  bout 
                    some Jello...?

                                  AL
                    Why didn t you say you knew 
                    Catherine Grant? 

                                  CARRIE
                     Cause I didn t know her.

                                  AL
                    Then how come your prints were in 
                    her apartment?

                                  CARRIE
                    Jesus, Al, I helped her carry in 
                    some groceries a few weeks ago.

                                  AL
                    Why didn t you mention it?

                                  CARRIE
                    Your boy never asked me.  Sloppy, 
                    sloppy. 

      Al shakes his head, grins.

                                  AL
                    You can t stop being a cop.  

                                  CARRIE
                    Oh I can.  I did.  How the hell 
                    d you find this place?

                                  AL
                    You know I finally figured out how 
                    to use a computer.  And you were 
                    right, there s this incredible 
                    thing called the Internet.  Helps 
                    you find people who wanna stay 
                    lost.

                                  CARRIE
                    I m not lost.                                                                                      23.


                                  AL
                    No, you re a...nurse?  

                                  CARRIE
                    I should be so lucky.  I volunteer.
                    Folks here aren t exactly hung up 
                    on the past.  I like that.  
                          (indicates with a nod)
                    Look at Mr. Chu.  Gina and I gave 
                    him a shower this morning.  He 
                    doesn t remember any of it.  I on 
                    the other hand remember every soap 
                    bubble.  The sunlight made a 
                    rainbow in the spray exactly like 
                    one in my bathroom on Buckingham 
                    Ave., April 23, 1985, 11:22 a.m.

                                  AL
                    I know how it works, Carrie.  It s 
                    also why you were a good cop.  
                    Nothing got by you. 

                                  CARRIE
                    Yeah, like the look of that kid who 
                    blew his own head off with a 12 
                    gauge  cause his crackhead father 
                    forgot to lock it.  Some things you 
                    wanna forget.  After ten years, I 
                    almost can.  Which is why I m not 
                    gonna help you.

                                  AL
                    Did I say anything about help?

                                  CARRIE
                    You re going to.

                                  AL
                    What, you read minds now?

                                  CARRIE
                    I can read yours.

                                  AL
                    All right, look, we got nothin  on 
                    this one, no motive, no weapon, no 
                    friends or family.  Hell, I m not 
                    even sure we got a name...  

                                  CARRIE
                    I told you, I m done.                                                                                    24.


                                  AL
                    I'm not asking you to help as a cop 
                    - though God knows I could use you - 
                    I'm asking you to help as a 
                    witness.

                                  CARRIE
                    Al, I didn t see anything.

                                  AL
                    You don t know what you saw.  I 
                    need you to look harder.  You know 
                    what I mean.  

      She does.

                                  AL (CONT D)
                    You can t forget it anyway.  Might 
                    as well do some good.

      Carrie sighs.  This is how it starts.

      EXT. COURTYARD - DAY

      The team are in the courtyard, waiting, when Al and Carrie 
      pull up in Al's car.  Carrie approaches the spot where the 
      young woman died.  Her eyes take on a peculiar intensity.

                                  NINA
                          (quietly, to Roe)
                    Aren t we supposed to hold hands, 
                    or something?

                                  ROE
                    If there s chanting, I m so out.

      Al glares at them.  Carrie's looking hard, remembering...

      EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT OF THE MURDER

      Night swallows day.  Naked bulbs burn in the courtyard.  

      Carrie is kneeling by the still warm body of Catherine Grant.  
      She stands.  But the Carrie that's part of the memory, 
      remains kneeling...dressed in a pair of baggy pajamas... 

      This is the first time we've seen Carrie choosing to relive a 
      memory in order to study it.  When she deliberately re-enters 
      a memory, Carrie's able to stand outside of herself.  To be a 
      witness of her earlier self.  

      But the virtual world that springs to life around her is 
      limited to what Carrie saw when the memory was formed.                                                                                      25.


      What she didn't see, isn't there.  It s like a photo splashed 
      on a digital canvas.  What isn t photo, is blank.

      What Carrie heard that night forms its own aural canvas.  The 
      singsong CHIRRUP of a night bird, a far-off DOG BARK, the 
      doppler whine of a passing FIRE ENGINE. 

      Carrie walks around.  What did she miss that she can see now?  
      She notices the spidery shadow of trees crisscrossing the 
      courtyard.  The thicker shadow of a dilapidated cement 
      fountain.  And something else, emerging from the shadow of 
      the fountain - an irregular shadow with no apparent source...

      Carrie watches her memory self - memory-Carrie - beside 
      Catherine's body.  Everything moves a little slowly as in a 
      dream.  Memory-Carrie glances toward the fountain, then back 
      to the body.  The neighbor in his robe approaches from the 
      entrance.  When he's beside the body, memory-Carrie gasps, 
      turns to him.  

      Carrie looks back at the irregular shadow.  It's gone.  
      Someone - the killer - was hiding behind the fountain.

      EXT. COURTYARD - DAY - RESUME

      Carrie rises, moves swiftly to the fountain.  

                                  CARRIE
                    Someone was here.  Someone was 
                    hiding here.

      She runs her hands over crumbling cement vines, into the leaf-
      choked basin.  She reaches deep into a rusty drainpipe.  Very 
      deep.  Now she s touching something, trying to get a grip... 

                                  ROE
                          (quietly to Nina)
                    If it s a Derek Jeter rookie card, 
                    it s mine.

      Carrie pulls out a CHEF S KNIFE, stained brown with blood. 

      The team stare at one another.  You don't see that every day.

                                        END ACT ONE                                                                                    26.


                                            ACT TWO

      INT. PRECINCT - SANDOVAL S OFFICE - DAY

      Al is standing before the desk of his superior, Deputy 
      Inspector ERNIE SANDOVAL.

                                  SANDOVAL
                    You saying she s a psychic?  You 
                    asking me to authorize a psychic.

                          ALSANDOVAL
      She s not a psychic. Would Cause if I need my fortune 
      you listen to me...read, there s plenty...

                                  AL
                    Ernie, it s got nothing to do with 
                    reading minds, any woowoo crap like 
                    that.  She has a great memory, 
                    that s all.

                                  SANDOVAL
                    So does my Aunt Jacquie, never 
                    forgets a birthday, but I don t 
                    bring her in to consult on homicide 
                      investigations.

                                  AL
                    With all due respect, and I don t 
                    know this, but I suspect Aunt 
                    Jacquie wasn t the youngest 
                    Detective in the history of the 
                    Syracuse police department.

      Sandoval glances at a folder, Carrie s old police record.

                                  SANDOVAL
                    Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got that right 
                    here - 
                          (reading)
                    - parents are college professors, 
                    drops out of school to become a 
                    cop, detective at 25, highest solve 
                    rate on the force.  Okay, I m 
                      impressed, so she remembers what, 
                    like facts and stuff?

                                  AL
                    Fact patterns, crime scenes, 
                    witness testimony, criminal 
                    profiles, once she s got em, she s 
                    got em.                                                                                    27.


                                  SANDOVAL
                    And she doesn t forget anything?

                                  AL
                    She can t forget anything.  Since 
                    she was a kid.  Some kind of trauma 
                    thing, her sister was murdered.  
                    Never found the guy.  It s called 
                      hyperthymesia.  It s super rare. 
                    They actually tested her up in 
                    Boston.  Everything she s 
                      experienced, all of it, it just 
                    sticks.  We d drop her in 
                      undercover, never needed a wire.  
                    She is the wire.   

                                  SANDOVAL
                    Mike tells me, when she found that 
                    knife, it was like she was really 
                    back there on the night.

                                  AL
                    When Carrie revisits a memory, it s 
                    like she s living it again, except 
                    this time, she s watching it 
                    happen.  As long as she took it in 
                    the first time, hearing, seeing, 
                    smelling, whatever...she can go 
                    back, study the things she didn t 
                    pay attention to.

      Sandoval goes back to Carrie s report.

                                  SANDOVAL
                    What s  indefinite leave, personal 
                    reasons  mean?

                                  AL
                    It means...some things about this 
                    work, you gotta forget. 

                                  SANDOVAL
                    You sure she s okay about getting 
                    back in?

                                  AL
                    Victim was her neighbor, she wants 
                    to help.

                                  SANDOVAL
                    Fine, bring her on.  We ll run it 
                    as a special consultant.                                                                                     28.


                                  AL
                    You won t be sorry.  I m telling 
                    ya, Carrie Wells was the best cop I 
                    ever saw.

                                  SANDOVAL
                          (not looking up)
                    And you saw a lot of her, I 
                    imagine.

      Al doesn t take the bait.

                                  SANDOVAL (CONT D)
                    How s Elaine?  You guys makin  
                    plans?

      More bait.

                    Elaine s fine.

                                  SANDOVAL
                    I ll put the papers through.

      Mike sticks his head in.

                                  MIKE
                    You want the good news or the bad 
                    news?

                                  AL
                    Surprise me.

      Al moves to Mike.

                                  MIKE
                    Bad news, no prints on the knife.  
                    Good news, pay stubs came through.  
                    We found her last place of work.

      EXT. HARBOR TRUCK RENTAL - LOADING DOCK - DAY 

      Mike threads his way through a fleet of bright orange trucks 
      with large-and-in-charge young boss KEN HARBERT, late 20s. 
      Ken s assistant, JILL, walks alongside.

                                  KEN
                          (into cell)
                    No, you can do more, but I m not 
                    gonna insure it.  Look, take the 
                      twenty-two.
                          (holds up a  one second  
                            hand to Mike)
                    Four tons, you do it all, one trip.                                                                                      29.


      He hands the cell to Jill, covers the speaker.

                                  KEN (CONT D)
                      One-twenty-nine, nothing lower.

      Jill peels off, as Ken continues with Mike, who hands him the 
      photo on Catherine s driver s license.

                                  KEN (CONT D)
                    I m sorry.  Yeah, I remember this 
                    one.  She temped for a while when 
                    Lourdes left to take care of her 
                    mom.

                                  MIKE
                    When was this?

                                  KEN
                    I don t know, few months ago.  My 
                    girl could give you the dates.

                                  MIKE
                    Do you remember, she have any 
                    problems with any of the other 
                      employees?

                                  KEN
                    Not that I know of. 

                                  MIKE
                    How long was she here?

                                  KEN
                    Week or so.  To be honest, I don t 
                    remember.  Only reason I remember 
                    her at all is, she rented a truck.  
                    Well, a van, for a coupla days.  We 
                    gave her a good deal.  

                                  MIKE
                    She say why she wanted the van?

                                  KEN
                    Yeah, actually.  Something about 
                    moving out on a boyfriend.  She 
                    seemed in a hurry.

      Boyfriend?

      INT. PRECINCT - BULLPEN - LATER THAT DAY

      TIGHT ON: An index card with the word  BOYFRIEND  written in 
      black Sharpie.  Roe finishes pinning it to the crime board.                                                                                     30.


      Below it, a SEVENTIES MAGAZINE AD of the smiling Coffee-mate 
      guy with sideburns and cigarette.  Roe grins at his 
      handiwork.

                                  ROE
                    Smile, ya bastard.  You won t be 
                    smilin  long.

      Nina looks over from her desk.  Carrie s at an extra desk on 
      the side. 

                                  NINA
                    Ever hear of innocent till proven 
                    guilty? 

                                  ROE
                    Oh he did it.  Nobody s innocent 
                    with those lapels.  

      The phone RINGS.  Nina answers it.  Roe goes back to the 
      board.

      Carrie flips a document, and comes upon the faded DMV photo 
      of Catherine.  She stares at it, shaken by the image...

      Roe, oblivious, calls over.

                                  ROE.
                    So, Wells, you knew the chief back 
                    in the day?

      Carrie decisively turns the photo of Catherine over.  The 
      last thing she needs is that memory, now.

                                  ROE
                    What was he like?

                                  CARRIE
                    Younger.

      Roe takes the hit.  What s with this chick?  Nina hangs up 
      the phone.

                                  NINA
                    That was the M.E., hair under the 
                      fingernails definitely not the 
                    victim s.

                                  ROE
                    DNA, baby. 
                          (to the photo)
                    That s  R.I.P.  to you, good-
                    lookin .                                                                                    31.


                                  NINA
                    Would help to know who good-lookin  
                    is first.

                                  ROE
                    I m on that too.  Henry cut 
                    together a Quicktime from that 
                    hallway security camera before it 
                    broke...

                                  NINA
                    From a month ago.  And even if the 
                      boyfriend s on there, we don t know 
                    what he looks like.

                                  ROE
                    You got somethin  better?

                                  NINA
                    Maybe.

      Carrie suddenly interjects:

                                  CARRIE
                    Can I see it?  The video?  

      Roe and Nina exchange a quick look.  

                                  ROE
                    Sure, help yourself.

      Carrie seats herself at his computer, takes up the mouse.

                                  ROE (CONT D)
                    You can make it bigger by dragging 
                    the little corner...

                                  CARRIE
                    Got it.  Thanks.

      She starts scrolling through the video at speed.  Roe leans 
      back against his desk, puts on a thoughtful look.

                                  ROE
                    So, what is the deal?  Really.  You 
                    can remember everything?

      Nina rolls her eyes.  Carrie doesn t even look up.

                                  ROE (CONT D)
                        Everything...really?  
                          (silence)
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    32.

                                  ROE (CONT D)
                    Like, if I asked you, you would 
                    know what tie I was wearing 
                      yesterday?  
                          (still no answer)
                    Or how many steps it is out to the 
                    elevator?

                                  CARRIE
                    Yes, yes, yes, blue with pink 
                    birdies, 29.

      Whoa.

                                  CARRIE (CONT D)
                    Now let me look at this thing, 
                    willya?  

      Al enters.

                                  AL
                    How we doin  with the boyfriend?

                        ROENINA
      Tough one, boss, I m workin  I think I got it.
      a coupla angles...

                                  NINA
                    Okay, it s simple.  I went back and 
                    checked the mileage of the van 
                    Catherine rented.  Mileage in, 
                    mileage out.  I worked in the 
                    distance from Harbor Truck to her 
                    new apartment, voila, compassed out 
                    a circle within which must be this 
                    guy s apartment. 

      She holds up a marked-up Google map.

                                  NINA (CONT D)
                    Now, what do you put your name on 
                    when you move in with a boyfriend?  
                    Catherine liked movies, didn't she?  
                    She had that great TV, all those 
                    DVD's lying around.  And no Netflix 
                    - she didn't have a computer.  If 
                    she used an old-fashioned video 
                    store, maybe, just maybe, she piggy-
                    backed on her boyfriend s account. 

                                  AL
                    Video stores.  
                          (they wait)
                    I like it.                                                                                    33.


                                  ROE
                    You gotta be kidding, there must be 
                    fifty stores in that area.

                                  AL
                    That s why she s gonna need some 
                    help.

      Roe sighs.  Al nods at Nina, who struggles to suppress a 
      smile.  He comes over to Carrie.  

                                  AL (CONT D)
                    You got a second?

      Carrie rises and follows him into his office.

      INT. PRECINCT - AL S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

      Al's got a stack of 8x11s on his desk.

                                  AL
                    Okay, I ve been going over the 
                    crime scene photos of her 
                      apartment.  Look at this.  
                          (indicates the photo of 
                          one wall)
                    The spacing is weird.  Frame, 
                    frame, nothing.  That s an empty 
                    hanging hook.  There was something 
                    there.  Something worth taking 
                    down.  Be nice to know what it was.
                          (off Carrie)
                    So you were there.  In the 
                      apartment.  

      He offers the 8x11.  

                                  AL (CONT D)
                    What do you think?

      Carrie hesitates.  She s deliberately avoided all memories of 
      Catherine.  But this is why she s here...

      She takes the photo, gazes at it intently.  The image seems 
      to deepen, to grow in size and detail.  Carrie lifts her 
      eyes...

      INT. CATHERINE GRANT S APARTMENT - DAY

      ...Catherine's apartment - on a bright morning three months 
      ago - rises up like a wave, devouring the reality of Al's 
      office.  Al can't see what Carrie sees - can picture only 
      what she tells him.  But he can see her face, and guess what 
      she's experiencing.                                                                                    34.


      As Carrie watches, she sees an earlier version of herself 
      enter the apartment carrying a bag of groceries, trailing a 
      very living CATHERINE GRANT.  The last time Carrie saw 
      Catherine, the young woman was growing cold on the courtyard 
      concrete.  Despite herself, Carrie is deeply moved.  

                                  AL
                    What s going on?  Carrie?  You see 
                    the wall?

      Carrie doesn't answer.   The off-hand quality of her exchange 
      with Catherine makes the memory that much more poignant.  
      She s Emily in Our Town...observing the impossible 
        preciousness of the lived and gone...

      Catherine speaks with a slight English accent.  She indicates 
      a table.

                                  CATHERINE
                    You can put it there.  

      Memory-Carrie places her grocery bag on the table, admires 
      the white blossoms trailing from it.

                                    MEMORY-CARRIE
                    Nice flowers.  

                                  CATHERINE
                    I love flowers.  My idea of heaven 
                    would be fresh flowers everyday.
                          (suddenly)
                    You re just downstairs, right?  If 
                    I make too much noise, just bang on 
                    the ceiling.

                                    MEMORY-CARRIE
                    Nah, that s okay.

                                  CATHERINE
                    No, no, do it.  These old buildings 
                    are so loud.
                          (taking up the flowers)
                    I better put these in water.  Oh, 
                    I m Catherine, by the way.

      She wipes her hand on her shirt, offers it to Carrie.  

                                    MEMORY-CARRIE
                    Carrie.

      Their hands touch...  

                                  AL
                    Carrie, can you see it?  Carrie...?                                                                                    35.


      Carrie finally tears her attention from Catherine and her 
        memory-self.  There, over the faux fireplace - a PICTURE IN A 
      FRAME.  Carrie goes to it...it sharpens, comes into focus as 
      she approaches... Yes, it's a PHOTOGRAPH - of Catherine and 
      an unknown WOMAN, beaming for the camera.  

                                  CARRIE
                    You re right.  There s a photo.  
                      Catherine, and another woman.  
                    Maybe ten years ago... 

                                  AL
                    What s the woman look like?

                                  CARRIE
                    Blonde, about the same age, could 
                    almost be her sister.  
                          (softly)
                    They look happy.  

      Carrie turns, still within the memory.  Catherine s returned 
      with the white flowers now in a vase.  Carrie moves toward 
      her...stepping into the place of memory-Carrie, who vanishes.  
      Catherine pulls out a flower, and offers it, smiling.

                                  CATHERINE
                    Thanks.

      Carrie accepts it...no longer a mere spectator of the 
      past...seeing in Catherine s eyes the pain of what s 
      been...knowing the horror of what s to come...

      It would be too much for anyone...

      INT. AL S OFFICE - RESUME

      Catherine s apartment vanishes.  Carrie s shaken.

                                  AL
                    You okay?

                                  CARRIE
                    Yeah, it s just...it s like she s 
                    alive.

      Al nods.  He s been through this with Carrie before.

                                  CARRIE (CONT D)
                          (back to work)
                    So who s our mystery woman?

                                  AL
                    We ll get you with the sketch guy. 
                    Maybe it was her sister.                                                                                    36.


                                  CARRIE
                    Maybe.  I doubt it.  She seemed so 
                    alone.  Like she was always alone.
                    She died alone.

                                  AL
                    News flash.  We all do.

                                  CARRIE
                    Some more than others.

                                  AL
                    Well, she had a friend at the end.  

                                  CARRIE
                    Me?  I barely knew her.  I couldn t 
                    help her.

                                  AL  
                    You just did.

      Nina and Roe pop into the office.  He s got an enlarged DMV 
      photo.

                                  NINA
                    We got the boyfriend!  Turns out 
                    there were like two rental places 
                    in the whole area.  

                                  ROE
                    Catherine Grant shows up on the 
                    Rocket Video account of this guy, 
                    George Creller.

                                  CARRIE
                          (re: the DMV photo)
                    Can I see that?

      Roe hands it to her, dubiously.  Carrie focuses.

                                  CARRIE (CONT D)
                    He visited her.  Creller.  I saw 
                    him on the security footage.

                                  ROE
                    C mon, there musta been dozens of 
                    people on that...

                      CARRIEAL
      Trust me. Trust her.

                                  AL
                    You ll find it makes things easier. 
                    Now go.                                                                                     37.


      INT. PRECINCT - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

      Nina and Roe are heading to the elevator.  Nina s excited.

                                  NINA
                    I ran George Creller through the 
                    indices, looks like he s got a...

      She looks at Roe.  He talking to himself, counting steps:

                                  ROE
                      Twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-

                      Twenty-seven, twenty-eight...twenty-

      He looks up.  He and Nina have reached the elevator bank.  
      Roe shakes his head.

                                  ROE (CONT D)
                    Lucky guess. 

      INT. MOTORCYCLE SHOP - JAMAICA AVENUE - - DAY

      Roe and Nina talk to GEORGE CRELLER, 30s, in his Queens 
      Village motorcycle shop.  Kinda rough place.  Creller looks 
      like he s been hit hard.  Might just be an act, might not.

                                  GEORGE
                    I met her at a Saturn dealership 
                    out on Northern Boulevard. They had 
                    her in front, meeting the walk-ons.  
                    We really connected.  She moved in 
                    like two weeks later.  She had a 
                    past, though, you know. She was a 
                    hooker.  You probably know that.  I 
                    mean, I don t judge, I ve done some 
                    things, too...

                                  ROE
                    Yes you have, George.  Narcotics 
                      possession, petty theft.  Got some 
                      experience moving bikes too.  Like 
                    the Ducati 996 you stole 
                      in...Hoosick, NY and tried to 
                    unload in Kingston, Ontario.                                                                                     38.


                                  GEORGE
                    Hey, I put all that behind me.  I 
                    bought this place last year, really 
                    turned things around for me.  I 
                    wanted that for Catherine too.  I 
                    told her, s`never too late for a 
                    new start. 

                                  ROE
                     Less you re dead.  Neighbors filed 
                      a complaint a while back.  Officers 
                      responding to reports of a fight.  
                    You knock her around, maybe rough 
                    her up a little with your 
                      motorcycle chains?

                                  GEORGE
                    What?  No.  I couldn t hurt her.  

                                  NINA
                    When was the last time you saw her?

                                  GEORGE
                    Day she moved out, three months 
                    ago.

                                  ROE
                    Except we got you on a security 
                    camera at her new address three and 
                    a half weeks ago.  Now you got 
                    three seconds to tell us the truth, 
                    or I m gonna Harley your Davidson 
                    ass into the station and we ll 
                    finish this there.

                                  GEORGE
                    I didn t kill her!  I loved her, 
                    she loved me...

                                  NINA
                    Then why d she leave you?

                                  GEORGE
                    I wish I knew.  Things were really 
                    going good, we were talking about 
                    her working at the shop with me.  
                    And then something happened.  She 
                    just started freaking out.  The 
                    tiniest thing would set her off.  
                    Like I d be late somewhere, or one 
                    time, I brought home a box of Cuban 
                    cigars, there s this doctor I know.  
                    She started screamin , throwin  
                    stuff around.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    39.

                                  GEORGE (CONT'D)
                    I knew she hated smoking but, 
                    c mon.  Then bam, she s gone.  

                                  NINA
                    Will you give us some DNA?

                                  GEORGE
                      Absolutely.  Look, when she left, I 
                    was crazy.  Finally found out where 
                    she d moved to.  I went over, stood 
                    outside her door, told her how much 
                    I loved her, said whatever happened 
                    between us, we could start over.
                          (a beat)
                    I wasn t lying about not seeing 
                    her.  She wouldn t even open the 
                    door. 

      INT. YUM-YUM DONUT - DAY

      Al and Carrie at a donut shop.  Four sticky tables, crap 
      coffee, but brightly lit, friendly.  Al s on his cell.

                                  AL
                          (into phone)
                    Nice job.
                          (hanging up)
                    No go on the boyfriend.  He was at 
                    his sister-in-law s in Mamaroneck 
                    night of the murder.  They went 
                    out, it got late, he stayed over.  

                                  CARRIE
                    Says the sister-in-law.

                                  AL
                    Says his Easy Pass.  He took the 
                      Triborough to the Bruckner, then up 
                    95.  Back the next morning.

      She s impressed.

                                  CARRIE
                    Wow.  Guess you really can take the 
                    boy out of Syracuse.   

                                  AL
                    I was going crazy up there, Carrie. 
                    Shutting down frat parties, giving 
                      sobrieties all night.  I applied 
                    around, Sandoval took a shot on me.  
                    Been eight years now.  What about 
                    you?  My sister heard you were out 
                    in Wyoming or something...                                                                                    40.


                                  CARRIE
                    Yeah, after I left, I thought, wide-
                    open spaces.  No people, no 
                    memories.  Wrong.  So I drifted 
                    south.  Place to place.  Nothin  to 
                    hold on to.  Turns out there s 
                    plenty. 

                                  AL
                    Why New York?  Why Queens?

                                  CARRIE
                    You can still get a one bedroom 
                    under 1200. 
                          (off Al)
                    Maybe because you can be more alone 
                    here than anywhere.  It s the most 
                    restless place I ve ever been, and 
                    the most restful.  Gives me a 
                    chance to get a handle on it. 

                                  AL
                    And have you?

                                  CARRIE
                          (shrugs)
                    What do you think?

        A double-barrelled question.  Al chooses the better answer.

                                  AL
                    I think, yeah.

      Carrie feels herself blush.  She didn t mean to open herself 
      up to any judgment, much less Al s.  But she almost trusts 
      him...again...

      The intimacy s a little uncomfortable for Al too.  He checks 
      his empty coffee cup.  Stands.

                                  AL (CONT D)
                    You want somethin ?  A chocolate 
                      sprinkles?

                                  CARRIE
                    Nah, I m off sugar.

                          ALCARRIE
      I ll get one, you have...You get one, I ll have a 
                                                  bite.

                                  AL
                    ...a bite.                                                                                    41.


      Al grins - it s an old game - moves away to the counter.  
      Carrie finds herself eyeing his broad shoulders.  She 
      carelessly strokes her neck and remembers...

      EXT. LAKE BEACH - DAY

      ...strong hands rubbing her shoulders at the beach at Green 
      Lake.  As we now learn, they belong to Al.  And the massage, 
      the banter that afternoon, were the prelude to this moment.  
      Their first love-making.  Alone on an empty beach.  When 
      Carrie thought she, even she, could be in love...

      INT. YUM-YUM DONUT - RESUME

      Al returns with his prize, two shiny donuts on a tray.

                                  AL
                    I got two.  So shoot me.

      Carrie's still flushed with the experience of him.  

                                  AL (CONT D)
                    Wow, you okay?

      She stares at him.  His cell rings.  

                                  AL (CONT D)
                          (into phone)
                    Great, where are you? 

      EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - DAY

      Al and Carrie with Mike on Park Avenue in the low 80 s.

                                  MIKE
                    So, according to Catherine Grant s 
                    phone records, she made a lotta 
                    calls to a disposable cell phone 
                    over the past three months.  These 
                    end abruptly two and a half weeks 
                    ago.  Then we have a bunch of one-
                    minute calls to a Steven Latman, 
                      successful lawyer, who, it so 
                    happens, is about to get married.

                                  CARRIE
                    They were having an affair.

                                  MIKE
                    S what I m thinkin .  Disposable 
                    phone, very discreet, guy decides 
                    to call it off, our girl goes 
                      ballistic, calls him repeatedly at 
                    his home, he ignores her.                                                                                    42.


                                  AL
                          (not sold)
                    Okay.  But it s a little light, no?

                                  MIKE
                    This add some weight?  One of the 
                    places Catherine temp d last year 
                    was the Manhattan Athletic Club, 
                    where Mr. Steven Latman is a member 
                    in good standing.

                                  AL
                    Nice.  Where s this guy live?

                                  MIKE
                    You re soaking in it.

      He points up to the building they're standing in front of.  
      Carrie smiles.  She likes Mike.

                                  LATMAN (O.S.)
                    Look I appreciate you people are 
                    just doing your job...

      INT. LATMAN S APARTMENT - DAY

      They re with STEVE LATMAN, early 40s, in Latman s enormous 
      dining room.  A long mahogany table is covered with boxes.  
      Workmen cross in the bg.  

                                  LATMAN
                    ...and I ve always had the deepest 
                    respect for the Department, in 
                    court and out.  Queens police, 
                    great police.  But this is about a 
                    phone call?

                                  MIKE
                    Sixteen calls, actually.  All 
                    within a forty-eight hour period.  

                                  AL
                    All under a minute, all from a very 
                    dead woman named Catherine Grant.  

                                  LATMAN
                    Look around, guys.  I m getting 
                    married.  People in and outta here 
                    all day long.  You think I keep 
                    track of who uses the phone?  I got 
                    a wedding planner, a decorator, her 
                    crew, a caterer who practically 
                    lives here and right now requires 
                    my attention.

                    Wendy... ? 

                                  AL
                    You re a member of the Manhattan 
                    Athletic Club.

                                  LATMAN
                    Yes, for many years.

                                  MIKE
                    Were you aware that Catherine Grant 
                    was an employee there?

                                  LATMAN
                    No. 

                                  AL
                    So you never met her?

                                  LATMAN
                    I may have met her.  I may have 
                    smiled at her.  Maybe...
                          (ominously)
                    ...she even got me a towel.

                                  WENDY (O.S.)
                    Steve?

                                  LATMAN
                    Now, if you ll forgive me, my 
                    fiance wants me to look at gnocchi.

      Al nods.  Latman goes.  As the team move off, they pass the 
      hallway to the kitchen. Carrie catches a glimpse of Latman s 
      fiance, WENDY WILSON, mid 30s, chatting with the caterer.

      TIGHT ON: Carrie.  Wham.

                    It s her.

      INT. PRECINCT - BULLPEN - DAY

      The team, including Carrie, are assembled around the bullpen 
      table.  Al holds up Wendy s photo.  

                                  AL
                    Wendy Wilson.  What do we know?

                                  MIKE
                    We know she and the lawyer didn t 
                    do Catherine Grant.  Doorman has em 
                    both in around 11:30.  They lock 
                    the door on 82nd after midnight, 
                    night guy says they never came 
                    down. 

                                  AL
                    How  bout her background?

                                  NINA

                    I got her even earlier.  A Wendy M. 
                    Wilson took her high school

                    Remind you of someone?                                                                                    45.


                                  AL
                    Wendy and Catherine, two peas in a 
                    pod.  Two women who never existed 
                    till fifteen years ago.

                                  CARRIE
                    There s a difference.  Wendy s a 
                    survivor.  

      They turn to her.

                                  MIKE
                    Survive what?

                                  CARRIE
                    That s the question.  Whatever it 
                    was, two intelligent, beautiful 
                    women buried the people they were 
                    in order to forget it.  We find out 
                    what that something was, we solve 
                    this thing.

                                  AL
                    So let s get her in here.
                          (to Nina and Mike)
                    You guys keep diggin .  I want some 
                      ammunition.

      Al stands, Carrie turns to him.

                                  CARRIE
                    She didn t come forward.  Why do 
                    you think she ll open up now?

                                  AL
                    Won t know  til we ask.

      He goes.  HOLD ON Carrie.  Dubious.  And a bit blown-off.

      INT. PRECINCT - INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER THAT DAY

      Wendy Wilson s come in for questioning.  She's brought a hard-
      ass lawyer from her fiance s firm, HANK STURGIS, 40s.  Al s 
      at the table with Carrie.  Wendy s flipping through pictures 
      of Catherine: a blow-up of her driver s license, a grainy 
      mugshot from the  90s.

                                  WENDY
                    No.  

                                  AL
                    You don t recognize this woman at 
                    all?                                                                                    46.


                                  WENDY
                    No.  Not at all.  

      Carrie s eyes are on Wendy, hard.  Why would she lie?

                                  AL
                    So, to be clear, you don t know 
                    Catherine Grant.  Or  Catherine 
                    Isaacs.   Or  Jennifer Goodwin   
                    Never met her.

                                    STURGIS
                    Ms. Wilson already told you, she 
                    has no knowledge of this person...

                                  AL
                    So there d be no reason for her to 
                    call your home, which she did 
                    nearly two dozen times.  

                                  WENDY
                    None that I can think of.

                                  AL
                    Maybe to talk to your fiance...?

                                    STURGIS
                          (to Wendy)
                    You don t have to go there...

                                  WENDY
                    Steve says he doesn t know her.  I 
                    trust him absolutely.  So there s 
                    your answer. 

      Wendy glances at Carrie, who holds her eyes for a moment.            

                                  AL
                          (pressing)
                    Calls to and from a disposable 
                    cellphone purchased six months ago 
                    from a Rite-Aid two blocks from 
                    your office...   

                                    STURGIS
                    Midtown Manhattan, work population 
                    two million.  Nice try.  Are we 
                    done here...?                                                                                     47.


                                  AL
                          (hotly)
                    You say you don t know Catherine 
                    Grant, you never heard of Catherine 
                    Grant, so what are you doing in a 
                    photo with her?

      Wendy stares at Al.  Her face is steel.   

                                    STURGIS
                    What photo?

                                  AL
                    We have a photograph of your client 
                    with the deceased.

                                    STURGIS
                    Would you care to produce this 
                    photo?

      Now it s Al s turn to hesitate.

                                  AL
                    Of course.

                                    STURGIS
                    Well?

      Al s turning red. 

                                    STURGIS (CONT D)
                    Wow.  That s kinda bush league, 
                    isn t it?

      Al stands, gestures with his eyes for Carrie to follow.  
      Carrie rises, steps with Al into 

      THE HALLWAY

                                  AL
                    Carrie, you saw her, right?  She s 
                    the one. 
                          (Carrie nods)
                    You know, I really don t like being 
                    lied to.  To my face.  The class 
                    act, the loyal wife, the lawyer - I 
                    wanna know where she was, who she 
                    was, before Park Avenue.  And why 
                    her relationship with Catherine 
                    should be such a damn secret.  I ll 
                    sweat her all day if I have to.

                                  CARRIE
                    With what?                                                                                    48.


                                  AL
                    With her non-existent past, for one 
                    thing.

                                  CARRIE
                    He s not gonna let you go there.  
                    It s irrelevant... 

                                  AL
                    I know what s relevant...

                                  CARRIE
                    I m just telling you, beating her 
                    up is not goin  to work...

                                  AL
                    What, you re identifying with her 
                    now...?

                                  CARRIE
                    Jesus, Al, don t start....

                                  AL
                    You got a problem with my tactics, 
                    just say so.

                                  CARRIE
                    Tactics, like bringing up evidence 
                    you don t have?

                                  AL
                    That woman is stonewalling a murder 
                      investigation, she s sitting in 
                    there lying to us.  If I have a 
                    shot at her, I m gonna take it.

                                  CARRIE
                    One woman is dead, you wanna pound 
                    the crap out of another woman who 
                    prob ly just missed being dead by 
                    inches. 

                                  AL
                    If it gets me some answers...

                                  CARRIE
                    Well it won t.  She s not lying to 
                    mess with your investigation, her 
                    whole life is a lie.

                                  AL
                    And you know this because you have 
                    some mysterious knowledge of this 
                    woman I don t know about?                                                                                      49.


                                  CARRIE
                    I know because it s obvious, Al.  

                                  AL
                    No, what s obvious is that you re 
                    bringing your own life to the table 
                    again, Carrie, and if you 
                       remember,  that s exactly what 
                    messed you up the first time.

      It s out of his mouth, before he can stop it.  Carrie looks 
      at him.  She nods.

                                  CARRIE
                    Messed me up?
                          (under control)
                    All I m doing, Detective Burns, is 
                    telling you what will work and what 
                    will not, in a murder 
                      investigation.  You don t wanna 
                    hear it?  Fine.  But leave me, and 
                    my  life  out of it.  You couldn t 
                    handle it before, and I definitely 
                    don t need you to now.  

                                  AL
                    Great.  So tell me.  You got some 
                    other idea how to get to her, I d 
                    like to hear.  Tell me.
                          (off Carrie)
                    I didn t think so.

      He heads back into...

      THE INTERROGATION ROOM.  

      ...slams back into his chair.  Wendy and her lawyer look at 
      him.  Al considers.  Ah, the hell with it.

                                  AL (CONT D)
                    That s all for now, thank you for 
                    coming in.

      He s up and out of the room, back into...

      THE HALLWAY

      ...where he s about to tell Carrie, there, you happy now..?!

      Only, there s no Carrie.  She s gone.                                                                                    50.


      INT. PRECINCT - KITCHEN AREA - CONTINUOUS

      Carrie s pissed, and even more pissed to feel so hurt and 
      betrayed, and useless.  She tries to calm herself...runs some 
      water over her hands, presses her palms to her eyes...

      EXT. WOODS - DAY

      CAMERA REVERSES...a little girl, Carrie at eight years old, 
      is slowly lowering her hands from her tear-stained 
      face...daring herself to look down...at the broken body lying 
      in the underbrush...the face she knows so well...turning dark 
      in death...the face of her older sister, Rachel...

      INT. PRECINCT - KITCHEN AREA - RESUME

                                  CARRIE
                          (whisper)
                    Rachel.

      Carrie s devastated.  She looks around, looking for some 
      answer, some relief...  

      Sees, through the KITCHEN DOORWAY, other cops passing by, 
      chatting, cracking each other up.  Something about the 
      lumpish normality of precinct life grounds her.  

      She reaches for a glass, fills it under the tap.  Stops in 
      mid gulp - the glass - she flashes to Wendy in the 
      interrogation room.  She was drinking from a glass...  

      Carrie bolts the kitchen, heads back at a run to 

      INT. PRECINCT - INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

      A Guy cleaning up.  There s a glass where Wendy was sitting.  

                                  CARRIE
                    Hang on a sec!

      She picks up the glass, holding the inside with two fingers, 
      and steps into the MAIN OFFICE, locates a Tech, HENRY, 20s.  

                                  CARRIE (CONT D)
                    Henry, right?  Did we find Wendy 
                    Wilson in the system?

                                  HENRY
                    No, we had no prints.

      She holds up the glass.

                                  CARRIE
                    Now we do.                                                                                    51.


      INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DISPLAY WINDOW - DAY

      TIGHT ON: the perfect features of a FEMALE MANNEQUIN.  WIDEN 
      to reveal an elaborate WINDOW DISPLAY DIORAMA.  A Dresser is 
      fitting a figurine in a chic power suit.  Wendy Wilson is 
      supervising her.  Carrie shows up.

                                  CARRIE
                    Ms.  Wilson?  Carrie Wells.  D you 
                    have a minute?

                                  WENDY
                    My lawyer advised me not to speak 
                    with the police.  I told you, I 
                    didn t know that woman.

                                  CARRIE
                    I m not the police.  Not 
                      technically.  And I don t want to 
                    talk about Catherine.  I d like to 
                    talk about Mallory Evans.

                                  WENDY
                          (to the dresser)
                    Deanna, can you try those Akoyas on 
                    the Anne Klein.  Take your time.

      With a look, the dresser goes, leaves Wendy and Carrie alone. 

                                  WENDY (CONT D)
                    I have nothing to say about Mallory 
                    Evans. 

                                  CARRIE
                    I m surprised.  She s an impressive 
                    woman.  Born in Ohio, alcoholic 
                    mom, abused by her stepfather, ran 
                    away to New York as a teenager.  
                    Fell in with some bad people, did 
                    some bad things.  Even got herself 
                    a police record.  Prostitution.

      Wendy is silent.

                                  CARRIE (CONT D)
                    But she pulled herself out of it.  
                    Changed her name.  Got an 
                      education, a career.  Now about to 
                    marry a very successful lawyer - 
                    who I have to say, looks really 
                    good in Zegna.

                                  WENDY
                    Sounds like quite a life.                                                                                    52.


                                  CARRIE
                    It s a rare person who could do 
                    what she did.  What you did.  

                                  WENDY
                    Whatever. 

                                  CARRIE
                    Your friend Catherine had a hard 
                    life too...  

                                  WENDY
                    My life was hard.  Hers was a 
                    disaster.

      And just like that, it s out in the open.

                                  CARRIE
                    You tried to help her...

                                  WENDY
                    Of course I did.  But she didn t 
                    want help.  She wanted what she 
                    got...  

      A sudden rush of emotion.  Her long, heartbreaking 
        relationship with Catherine glimpsed in an instant.  Wendy 
      the businesswoman bites it back.

                                  WENDY (CONT D)
                    That s cruel.  Olga didn t deserve 
                    to die.  That s her name, Olga.  
                    Olga Romanyenka.  From Minsk.  I 
                    thought that was a joke the first 
                    time I heard it.  She came here 
                    when she was fifteen.  Some Russian 
                    guys promised her a job.  They sold 
                    her to this family out on the 
                    Island.

                                  CARRIE
                    Sold her?

                                  WENDY
                    Yeah, that s what they do.  They 
                    take your passport and say buy it 
                    back.  And the only way you can do 
                    that is, you work for them.  She 
                    was a maid for this guy and his 
                    wife.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    53.

                                  WENDY (CONT'D)
                    The wife used to beat her up when 
                    she dropped a dish, and the 
                      guy...well, the scumbag did what 
                    scumbags do to fifteen-yr-old girls 
                    who don t have anyone to protect 
                    them. 
                          (pause)
                    They had young kids too.  In the 
                    same house.  You believe it?   

                                  CARRIE
                    When was this?

                                  WENDY
                    Early  90 s.  She eventually got 
                    out.  But where was she gonna go?  
                    We were both working at this club 
                    in Woodmere.  They busted the whole 
                    place.  Put us in a group together, 
                    a Twelve Step thing.  Everyone 
                    thought she was my kid sister... 

      She finds her purse, takes out a faded photograph.  The same 
      one Carrie saw.

                                  WENDY (CONT D)
                    We took it the day we got out.  
                    Drove up to Bear Mountain - it was 
                    so windy and clear - we both 
                    decided we were never going back. 

      She looks at the photo, remembering.

                                  WENDY (CONT D)
                    I tried to help her, you know, get 
                    a job, get a place, a decent man, 
                    but she kept drifting back into the 
                    life.  Like that s all she was good 
                    for.  I lent her money.  I put 
                    myself on the line for her, even 
                    got her a job at the club I go to.

                          (surprised, then...)
                    Oh right.  Steve s club.  It s 
                    where I met him, actually.  Anyway, 
                    it worked out...for a while. 

      Another surge of feeling halts her.                                                                                      54.

                    And then...?

                                  WENDY
                    About three months ago, she called 
                    me out of the blue, all excited.  
                    She said she d run into the guy, 
                    the guy who bought her.  I told 
                    her, stay away from him, let it go.  
                    The past was past.  But she was 
                    obsessed.  She said she was gonna 
                    blackmail him. 

                                  CARRIE
                    She called you...at home?

                                  WENDY
                    No.  I wouldn t allow that.  I was 
                    living with Steve.  So I got a 
                    separate cell phone, just for her.  
                    After two weeks, I stopped taking 
                    her calls.  She s asking this guy 
                    for more and more money, it was 
                    enough.  Then she called me at 
                    Steve s.  That was it.  I told her 
                    she was on her own.  This was my 
                    life.  I threw out the phone.  

      She looks back at the photo.

                                  WENDY (CONT D)
                    That day, we said we d always be 
                    there for each other.  I just 
                    couldn t.

      Again, Wendy is overwhelmed.  Carrie waits, then...

                                  CARRIE
                    Wendy, do you know the name of the 
                    man, the one she was blackmailing?  

                                  WENDY
                    No.  She wouldn t say his name.  I 
                    swear, I would have told you, if I 
                    knew.
                          (Carrie nods)
                    All I know is, she met him  at 
                    work.  

                                  CARRIE
                          (suddenly)
                    When was this?                                                                                    55.


                                  WENDY
                    About three or four months ago.  I 
                    don t know the name of the place.

                                  CARRIE
                          (putting it together)
                    That s okay.  I do.

      INT. HARBOR TRUCK RENTAL - DAY

      Ken Harbert empties the dregs from an aging Mr. Coffee as he 
      talks to the detectives.  

                                  KEN
                    No, I m happy to help in any way I 
                    can.  

      He expertly tears three sugar packets with his teeth, dumps 
      them into the sludge.

                                  AL
                    This shouldn t take too long.  We 
                    need to talk to your older 
                      employees, any one over fifty or 
                    so.

                                  KEN
                    Well that s the easiest one I ve 
                    had all day.  
                          (calls)
                    Hey Tony, ya got a sec?

      All eyes turn.  From an adjoining cubicle, TONY, 60s, Harbor 
      Trucking s single over-fifty employee rolls over.  

      In a wheelchair.

      The team glance at one another.  Dead end.  

      Carrie s been hanging back by the door.  She glances down the 
      hallway, wanders a few steps into it. 

      There s another OFFICE next to Ken s.  Big desk, leather 
      chair, pictures on the wall.  Carrie enters, moves to the 
      desk.  It s dominated by an expensive brass-trimmed humidor 
      and an ashtray filled with cigar butts.

      Nina pops her head in.

                                  NINA
                    Well, that sucked.  Maybe Wendy 
                    Wilson got her dates wrong...
                          (off Carrie)
                    What s up?                                                                                    56.


                                  CARRIE
                    Nina, didn't Catherine s boyfriend 
                    tell you she lost it when he 
                    brought home Cuban cigars?

      Nina s not used to Carrie s prodigious memory.

                                  NINA
                    Yeah, I think so.  Why?

      Carrie notices a framed PICTURE on the edge of the desk, 
      picks it up.  

      It s a PHOTO of Ken Harbert with an older Man, big stogie 
      stuffed in the older guy s mouth.

      Carrie moves quickly to the door, spots Ken s assistant.

                                  CARRIE
                     Scuse me?  Jill?  
                            (indicating)
                    Who s office is this?

                                  JILL
                    That s Ken s dad s.  He only comes 
                    in on Wednesdays and Fridays.  

                                  CARRIE
                    Today s Friday.

                                  JILL
                    Yeah, I know.  He called in 
                      yesterday, said he was sick.

      Bingo.

      INT. PRECINCT - OUTSIDE THE INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

      Nina and Mike are at the glass, looking in at Al and Carrie 
      with FRANK HARBERT, late 50s, muscle gone to paunch.  Roe 
      comes up, report in hand.

                                  ROE
                    Got it.  The old man s DNA matches 
                    the hair under Catherine s 
                      fingernails, four regions.

                                  MIKE
                    Don t think they need it.  Guy went  
                    down when they told him they had 
                    his prints in her apartment.  

      She nods past the glass, where Frank is clearly a broken man.  
      Roe steps into the room.                                                                                    57.


      INT. PRECINCT - INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

      Al faces Frank, Carrie stands to the side.  Roe hands Al the 
      DNA analysis.

                                  AL
                    Frank, I m not required to, but I 
                    will ask you again if you d like to 
                    have an attorney present. 

                                  FRANK
                    Nah, don t need one. 

                                  AL
                    So you were giving her money?

                                  FRANK
                    She figured she earned it.  I 
                    suppose she did.  But I had to 
                    leave something for my family.  So 
                    I went over there to tell her, no 
                    more.  Whatever I did, and I did 
                    it, and I m gonna burn in hell for 
                    it - whatever I did, I paid enough.

                                  AL
                    What happened then?

                                  FRANK
                    She went crazy, she said she was 
                    gonna call the cops.  I tried to 
                    calm her down, you know, to hold 
                    her.  I still had affection for 
                    her.  
                          (to Carrie)
                    You, you think I m sick?  

                                  CARRIE
                      I wouldn t know.

      OUTSIDE THE GLASS

                                  NINA
                          (to Mike, re: Frank)
                     Could put it to a vote.

      RESUME

                                  FRANK
                    We almost done?  I m tired.

                                  AL
                    In a bit.  What happened after she 
                      threatened to call the police?                                                                                    58.


                                  FRANK
                    She went for her phone, you know, 
                    and I...I grabbed the knife, it was 
                    just lyin  there, and I guess I 
                    went a little crazy too.  

      He lowers his head into his hand.  The team wait.

      INT. PRECINCT - BULLPEN - LATER THAT DAY

        Congratulations all around.  Roe s pouring something from a 
      flask into paper cups.  Mike holds up a cup in toast fashion.

                                  MIKE
                    Both of you guys...nice job.

      Carrie s alone at her desk, pushing some stuff into her 
      shoulder bag.  Mike leans over.

                                  MIKE (CONT D)
                    Hey.  Good work. 

      Carrie smiles briefly, returns to her packing.  Al comes up.

                                  AL
                    Takin  off?
                          (Carrie nods)
                    So, you were right.  About Wendy.  
                    I shoulda listened to you...

                                  CARRIE
                    You don t have to do this.

                                  AL
                    Do what?

                                  CARRIE
                    Follow a ten-year old fight with a 
                    ten year old apology.  

                                  AL 
                    Who s apologizing?  You were right.  
                    You re always right.  Admit it, 
                    Carrie, you re good at this.  You 
                    should come back.

                                  CARRIE
                    Nah, this is it.  I m done.  
                    Listen, Al...

      She might as well tell him.  She has to tell someone.                                                                                    59.


                                  CARRIE (CONT D)
                    Look, you know me, better than 
                    anyone.  You know I started 
                      remembering everything, every 
                    fraction of every second, the day I 
                    found Rachel.  When they tell me I 
                    found her.   Cause I don t remember 
                    finding her.  

                                  AL
                    Yeah.

                                  CARRIE
                    Well what you don t know is, I m 
                    starting to remember.  Ever since I 
                    saw Catherine, lying there.  I m in 
                    the woods.  I m lost.  I see 
                    Rachel.  I can touch her.

                                  AL
                    Okay.

                                  CARRIE
                    And there s more every time.  
                    There s more that I remember.  I m 
                    afraid of what s coming.  

                                  AL
                    Don t be afraid...

                                  CARRIE
                    I am afraid, Al.  You don t 
                      understand.  I need to control 
                    what s in my mind, what I remember.  
                    That s the only way I ve been able 
                    to make it work.  If I can t 
                    control my mind... 

      From her expression, we glimpse what that would mean to her.  

                                  CARRIE (CONT D)
                    Look, don t you get it?  This...
                          (waves her hand around the 
                            bullpen)
                    ...this is Syracuse all over again.  
                    I can t control what it does to me, 
                    and I have to.  I have to.  I love 
                    the job, Al, but - I m done.  

                                  AL
                    Carrie...                                                                                    60.


                                  CARRIE 
                    Enjoy the party.  Enjoy your life.  
                    I mean that.

      Al watches her go.

      INT. PRECINCT HALLWAY - MOMENT LATER

      As Carrie heads out, she sees Frank Harbert being led down a 
      hallway.  Cuffed, head bowed, he walks slowly, as if nursing 
      knees a bit unstable with age.  Carrie watches, and then... 

      INT. CARRIE S APARTMENT - NIGHT OF THE MURDER 

      Carrie s eyes flash open  The SOUND of footsteps POUNDING 
      DOWN the stairs...ECHOING down the hallway.  First 
        Catherine s, then her killer s...

      INT. PRECINCT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

      Harbert disappears into a holding area.  

      ON: Carrie.  Processing it all.

      EXT. STREET - NIGHT - LATER

      Carrie walks home, unease tugging at her.  What doesn t feel 
      right about Harbert?  The speed of those pursuing footsteps?  
      The quick confession?  But what about his fingerprints in 
      Catherine Grant s apartment, his DNA...?

      She passes her local GREEK DELI as two young Hipsters exit 
      playfully fighting over a bag of fresh bread.  Carrie glances 
      at them, then - FLASH - 

      EXT. STREET - NIGHT OF THE MURDER

      The Couple from the night of the murder LAUGH as they exit 
      the same Greek deli...Carrie, in her tiny black dress, 
        contemplates them from across the street...

      EXT. STREET - NIGHT - RESUME

      TIGHT ON Carrie.  She was on this street only hours before 
      Catherine was stabbed to death.  Was there something here, 
      something not important then...but now...?

      Carrie focuses all her attention...digging into her 
        memory...deliberately summoning the past...

      EXT. STREET - NIGHT OF THE MURDER

      The streetlights shift subtly and she sees a familiar yellow 
      CAB pull up in front of her building.                                                                                      61.


      Sees herself - memory-Carrie - sliding from the cab.  Right 
      on cue, a LAUGH is heard, and memory-Carrie glances in the 
      direction of the Couple exiting the Greek deli...who, like 
      the deli itself and a swathe of the adjoining buildings, 
      bloom into being as memory-Carrie s gaze falls upon them...

      Time seems to slow to a crawl - SOUNDS become heightened and 
      distinct - as Carrie follows memory-Carrie s line of sight to 
      a wall...

      BESIDE THE DELI

      ...where a dark Figure nurses a cigarette in the shadows.  
      Carrie s focus moves in.  She can t make out the man s face.  
      Then he leans forward into the light.  No luck.  It s a 
      Counter Man from the deli, white apron around his waist, out 
      sneaking a puff.

      Carrie turns her attention to the PLATE-GLASS WINDOW of the 
      deli.  Behind it, a few late-night Customers are seated at a 
      narrow counter.

      Carrie focuses more closely, moving slowly over the 
      customers: a Punjabi Sikh Cab Driver, in full pagri, stirring 
      his tea...a Goth Teen Couple, tearing at a dripping 
      hero...and at the end of the counter, another Man, in a 
      hoodie, hunched over a steaming coffee.  His heavy shoulders 
      look familiar, but his face is hidden.  Carrie waits, and 
      then, slowly, the man lifts three sugar packets together, 
      tears them with his teeth...

      Carrie s eyes widen...FLASH!

      INT. HARBERT TRUCK RENTAL - MEMORY

      Stained teeth ripping three sugar packets...oh no...

      EXT. STREET - NIGHT OF THE MURDER - RESUME

      The man in the hoodie finishes bite-tearing the sugar, dumps 
      them into his coffee and finally starts to look up...

      PUSH IN ON Carrie, her eyes on fire.

      The man s face comes into view.

      It s Ken Harbert.  

      EXT. STREET - NIGHT

      Carrie goes into action.  Grabs her cell, punches buttons.

      INTERCUT WITH:  Henry, the lab tech, at his station.                                                                                    62.

                    Henry, it s Carrie Wells. Listen, 
                    exactly what DNA test did we run on 
                    Frank Harbert?

                    You wanted it yesterday, so we did 
                      a quickie, just a Y chrome.

                    whatever you got.  

                                  HENRY
                    Sure, what s goin  on?

                                  CARRIE
                    Just do it, will ya?  Thanks.

      She hangs up.  Punches in another number.

      INT. AL S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

      Al's cell BUZZES away on a side table.  Al s opening some 
      wine.  In the bg, his girlfriend ELAINE is making dinner.

      Carrie gets Al s voice mail.

      She hangs up.

      EXT. HARBOR TRUCK RENTAL - NIGHT

      The lights are still on.  Carrie, in the parking lot, moves 
      closer, stares through a window into a large STORAGE AREA.

      CARRIE S POV: Inside, there are stacks of boxes of all sizes, 
      some as big as refrigerators.  A Man sorts through the towers 
      of packing material, CURSING as he throws a bale of boxes 
      onto a growing stack.

      Ken Harbert.

      REVERSE ON: Carrie.  She heads inside.

      Ken s got his back to the door, so he doesn t hear his 
      visitor enter.

                                  CARRIE (O.S.)
                    Mr. Harbert.

      Ken turns suddenly.  

                                  KEN
                    What re you doin  here?

                                  CARRIE
                    Where is everyone?

                                  KEN
                    Most of the employees were pretty 
                    upset, I gave  em the night off.  
                    Me, I wanted to stay busy.  

                                  CARRIE
                          (nods)
                    Talk to you for a second?

      Ken flings another bale into the corner, a little violently.

                                  KEN
                    You know it s all crap.  I don t 
                    care what my dad said, he d never 
                    do something like that to anybody.

                                  CARRIE
                    Ken, he admitted...

                                  KEN
                    I grew up in that house, I had a 
                    lotta nannies, baby-sitters when I 
                    was young, that woman wasn t one of 
                     em!  She s just a nutjob tryin  to 
                    make a buck.  

                                  CARRIE
                    You re right, it doesn t any make 
                    sense your father confessed.  
                      Especially when the crime scene DNA 
                    doesn t match him.

                                  KEN
                          (hesitates)
                    I don t understand.                                                                                     64.


                                  CARRIE
                    We ran a standard Y chromosome 
                    test.  Pretty damn accurate.  Only 
                    hitch, fathers and sons tend to 
                    match out the same.  Ken, where 
                    were you that night?

                                  KEN
                    At home, asleep.

                                  CARRIE
                    You weren t at the Paros Deli on 
                    35th St. off 31st Ave. havin  a cup 
                    of coffee, piece of baklava? 
                          (off Ken)
                    Wanna hear my theory, as to why he 
                      confessed?  He was protecting 
                    someone, someone he loves.  And 
                    maybe, just a little, to make up 
                    for something he did fifteen years 
                    ago. 

                                  KEN
                    I want a lawyer.

                                  CARRIE
                    Good idea.  You can take a DNA test 
                    if you d like, and who knows, maybe 
                    I m totally off base...

                                  KEN
                    I m not takin  a test. 
                          (pause)
                    What d you want me to do, she had 
                    him by the short hairs.  He s a 
                    sweet guy, he s not gonna stand up 
                    for himself.  I told him to tell 
                    her, no more.  I knew he couldn t 
                    do it.  Christ, and now the son-of-
                    a-bitch confessed.

                                  CARRIE
                    So you followed him... 

                                  KEN
                    Yeah, I wanted to make sure.  I was 
                    going to go in with him but 
                    then...I didn t want him to see me.

                                  CARRIE
                    So you waited in the Chinese 
                      restaurant till he was gone.                                                                                      65.


                                  KEN
                    Yeah.

                                  CARRIE
                    Then you killed Catherine Grant.

                                  KEN
                    Stop calling her Catherine Grant.  
                    She was some Russian whore we took 
                    in.  And that s how she repaid us?  
                    I don t care what he did.  How he s 
                    gotta make up for it.  She shoulda 
                    shut up and gone away.  Why the 
                    hell didn t she shut up and go 
                    away?

      Suddenly, Ken pulls down a huge tower of boxes, bolts for the 
      door.  Carrie dodges, follows...

      EXT. HARBOR TRUCK RENTAL - NIGHT

      ...into the darkness of the truck parking lot.  

                                  CARRIE
                    Ken, you can t run, there s no 
                    where to go.

      Ken leaps out from behind a truck with a lethal crowbar.          
      He swings at Carrie, who dodges back, falling against the  
      cab of the truck.  But Carrie was a cop.  When Ken comes for 
      her again, she quickly sweeps his leg, knocking him off 
      balance.  She reaches for a control hold, but Ken has eighty 
      pounds on her.  He rolls her off, and in moment has her 
      pinned to the floor.

                                  KEN
                    You shouldn t have come alone.

      A HUGE PISTOL is pressed against Ken s skull.  It s Al.

                                  AL
                    She didn t.

      Ken releases Carrie.  Al grabs him roughly, cuffs him.  
      Carrie s shaken, but...

                                  CARRIE
                    You took your time.

                                  AL
                    Woulda been sooner but...
                          (he lifts his cell)
                    ...had it on vibrate.                                                                                    66.


                                  CARRIE
                    Given the circumstances, I think...

                                  AL
                    ...that s the dirtiest thing you 
                    ever heard?

      An echo of Green Lake, long ago.  Carrie looks at Al, shocked 
      that he remembers.  Al smiles.  

      INT. MIDVALE NURSING HOME - DAY

      Archie s letting Meathead have it.  Again.

      REVERSE ON Carrie, remote in hand, satisfied.

                                  CARRIE
                    There, how s that? 

      Carrie s old friend Alice is on the couch.  A number of other 
      patients are seated around the lounge.

                                  ALICE
                    Much better, thank you.
                          (then)
                    Nurse, do you know if my daughter s 
                    coming today?  She said she was.

                                  CARRIE
                          (after the briefest beat)
                    She was here this morning, Alice.  
                    Don t you remember?  You played 
                    cards.

                                  ALICE
                    Oh, yes.  She s a good girl, my 
                    Rachel.  She never forgets me.

      Carrie nods.  Alice s blanket has slipped. Carrie adjusts it.  

                                  ALICE (CONT D)
                    Thank you, Miss.  What d you say 
                    your name was?

                                  CARRIE
                    Carrie.

                                  ALICE
                    You know, my younger daughter s 
                    name is Carrie.

      TIGHT ON: Carrie.  It s almost too much for her.  Not being 
      recognized by the woman we now realize is her own mother...                                                                                    67.


      She kisses Alice on the forehead.

                                  CARRIE
                    I know.

      Carrie rises.  Glances around the dayroom...

      CARRIE S POV: Dishes leak half-eaten meals onto folding 
        trays...yellowed paperbacks tip from a sagging 
        bookshelf...aides gossip with each other while their patients 
      snooze open-mouthed in their recliners...

      UNDER ALL, the insistent HISS of steam heat in old pipes and 
      the interminable SQUAWK of the TV...

                    The handsome policeman wants you.

      Al has just appeared in the day room.  Carrie moves to him.

                                  CARRIE
                    I still don t remember calling you.

                                  AL
                    Just thought I d tell ya, in 
                    person, Sandoval says you pass the 
                    JST.  You d come on as Detective, 
                    Second Class.  First class,  far as 
                    I m concerned. 

                                  CARRIE
                    If I were interested, that d be 
                      interesting.

      Al looks around the nursing home.

                                  AL
                    So that s it.  Bed pans and 
                      blackjack? 

                                  CARRIE
                    Yeah.  But I m thinking maybe I ll 
                    try game shows.  Alex Trebak never 
                      kneecapped anyone, far as I know.

      Al smiles, but if you thought he was giving up...                                                                                    68.


                                  AL
                    All right, I m gonna say something, 
                    and you re gonna listen.  For once. 
                          (she does)
                    Look, what if your memory coming 
                    back - the memory of Rachel - what 
                    if it doesn t mean you re 
                      unraveling, what if it s a good 
                    thing?  Maybe this journey, or 
                    whatever you been on, maybe it 
                    worked.  And you re remembering 
                    what happened in those woods  cause 
                    it s time for you to remember.  You 
                    ever think of that? 

      Maybe she has, but still...  

                                  AL (CONT D)
                    Just sayin,  ten years in the 
                      wilderness, Carrie - you re not the 
                    person you were.

                                  CARRIE
                    When I m ready, Al.

                                  AL
                    You re ready now.

      He turns to go.  Adds, lightly:

                                  AL (CONT D)
                    Maybe when you realize that, you 
                    will give me a call.

      And gives her one of those Al grins...

      EXT. LAKE BEACH - DAY

      Green Lake.  Al running butt naked into the water.  He flings 
      himself back into the surf.  Happy to be alive, and in love.  

                                  AL
                    Come on in, it s unbelievable!  

      REVERSE on a younger, smiling Carrie, clutching the remnant 
      of her bikini top to her breasts.  

                                  AL (CONT D)
                    Come on, Carrie...!

      Carrie takes a step, hesitates, looks down.  The water laps 
      at her feet...                                                                                    69.


      EXT. MIDVALE NURSING HOME - RESUME

      ON: Carrie.  She can still feel the sun on her face.  

      CAMERA REVERSES.  Al's gone. 

      PUSH IN ON: Carrie.   A flicker of a smile...  

      EXT. CEMETERY - DAY 

      Catherine's funeral, at a little cemetery on Long Island. 
      It's a lovely spot, quiet, surrounded by trees.  Our team are 
      there.  Wendy Wilson, in dark glasses.  George the boyfriend.  

      They found a Russian PRIEST to say the prayers.  He chants 
      words of peace in Old Slavonic.  

      Suddenly Carrie is there.  She approaches the gathering, then 
      stops.   She nods to Wendy.  

      Al catches her eye.  The rest of the team are looking at her 
      too, waiting.  

      Then, like a high diver, who after a final squaring and 
      settling leaps into space, Carrie moves to them and takes her 
      place with the team.  Despite the sadness of the occasion, 
      they share a few brief smiles.  

      The mourners are tossing flowers into the grave.  As Carrie 
      fingers the WHITE FLOWER in her hand, she looks to the woods.  
      And shudders...because the woods seem to rush toward her...

      EXT. WOODS - DAY

      ...in an instant, she's eight again...plunged in forest 
        gloom...bending over Rachel's body...brushing the hair from 
      her dead sister's face...whispering her name over and over 
      again...a SOUND...the CRACKLING of twigs...just beside 
      her...TIGHT ON young Carrie's face...she turns slowly, 
      slowly...to face the towering figure of a MAN...so heavily 
      backlit, he seems more silhouette than solid...we can't see 
      his features...but - can the little girl...??

      EXT. CEMETERY - RESUME

      TIGHT ON: Carrie.  Remembering.

      BLACKOUT
