          It's dark as night but for small streaks of sunlight that
            penetrate the old building; the contrast makes it hard to
          see but as they move in further, they see junk food
          wrappers and other signs of squatters who have been there. 
          Kohlan catches a whiff of something coming from another
          room... whispering --

                                        OFFICER KOHLAN
                        You smell that?  That ammonia
                        smell?

                        Smells like cat piss.

                                        OFFICER KOHLAN
                        What are these kids up to?

          Kohlan nods, intrigued, yet still unsnaps the safety strap
          on her holster and puts her hand on her gun... looks to
          Walt...

                                        OFFICER KOHLAN
                        I know you're a little out of
                        your jurisdiction, Sheriff, but I
                        might need a little back-up here,
                          okay...?

          Walt acknowledges...


          MOVING LONG SHOT POV TO REVEAL A SMALL AREA IN THE
            WAREHOUSE -- DAY

          SCOTT (17, a grungy/punky street kid, but clearly very
          bright in a computer geek sort of way) is working at a
            makeshift lab table.  Two other boys sit on the floor
            watching.  Leaning against a wall watching are two girls:
          TAMMY MOE (16), a VERY punked-out girl with a mohawk and
          multiple piercings and tattoos, and JILL DERR (also 16, 
          not nearly as hardcore as Tammy, a more accessible
          appearance, 'newer' to the alternative culture).  Jill is
          the runaway from Cleaves Mills who is the object of Walt
          and Johnny's search.

                                        TAMMY
                        I'm hungry.  Anyone have any money?  

          The lab table contains only the most basic implements --
          just modified everyday items from a hardware store -- and
          empty boxes of cold medicine litter the table and floor:
          raw materials.


          RESUME KOHLAN, JOHNNY AND WALT

          as the cop looks to Walt and Johnny, silently directing
          them to split up to best cover escape routes although the
          open space design makes that very difficult... we stay
          with Johnny as he eyes --


          POV - JILL

          who looks tired, worn out... she reacts as Kohlan moves
          in from her position...

                        How's it going there, Mr. Science?

          Scott reacts by pushing over the lab table to block
          Kohlan's approach and the boys bolt... Walt and Kohlan
          running after the boys into the darkness of the warehouse,
          trying to cut off their escape... but Johnny's quest for
          Jill takes him into the lab...


          ANGLE - SLOW MOTION

          Jill's briefly frozen like a deer in headlights as she
          sees him coming toward her; Johnny and Jill's eyes
          connect... but then we HARD CUT TO -- 


          RESUME NORMAL SPEED - NEW ANGLE - FLOOR

          where two different pools of spilt liquid running towards
          each other.  When they collide, they erupt in a FUMEY
          CHEMICAL REACTION.


          RESUME THE ROOM

          Jill and Tammy use the diversion to escape... but Johnny
          is caught in the misty cloud of fumes...  Coughing, Johnny
          tries to push himself away from the noxious vapors, but
          he is overcome and passes out.

                                                                              FADE OUT:

          FADE IN:


          Johnny sits, as DR. TRAN finishes up an examination...
          (Note: let's get some MEDTECH help here to suggest some
          alternative to our usual checking the eyes and looking at
          brain scans.  Maybe a nurse is drawing blood during this. 
          Or they're doing an EKG.  Might the lab results be on a
          computer screen?)

                                        DR. TRAN

          That just isn't an option for Johnny, he shakes his head,
          stands to leave...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't have twenty-four hours

            A typical scene in a runaway's home.  A frantic, sleepless
          mother on the phone... talking to police... talking to
            neighbors... talking to anyone who might have some word
          on the whereabouts of their daughter...

          Here, MRS. DERR (Jill's mother, 40's, middle class) can
          be seen through the door to the kitchen on the phone... 
          on the other end, is a Portland police officer...

          And the content of this conversation is not terribly
            important to absorb... it's a tone, a mood, a setting
          because as it continues, we pan to find Johnny waiting...  
          musing over a variety of pictures on a piano...

                                        MRS. DERR
                                (to phone)
                        What I don't understand is...
                                (beat)
                        No, but what I don't understand
                        is...  
                                (beat)
                        But I thought you said this, this
                          warehouse district is where all
                        the kids...

          As Johnny picks up a photograph of Jill as a six year old
          Tinker Bell...  Mrs. Derr's dialogue getting lost in the
          background as Johnny's vision begins... we RAMP TO HIS
          FACE as we hear: 

                                        BOY #1'S VOICE
                        Jill, come back!  You'll get lost.



          CLOSE ON Tammy Moe as she sits in the Sheriff's office. 
          Then WIDEN to reveal Sheriff Walt Bannerman across his
          desk from Tammy and Johnny sitting off to the side...

          In the background, through the windows of Walt's office,
          we can see Tammy's MOTHER (Late 30's, worn as an old
          leather jacket) sitting in a chair waiting for her
            daughter.  She lights up a cigarette, bored.  Obviously
          this isn't the first time her daughter has been in trouble.

          Walt sets a tiny (1 inch by 1 inch) ziploc bag on his
          desk containing a trace of white powder in it, and also a
          small glass vial (like the kind insulin or other legal
          drugs come in).

                                        WALT
                        You just happen to have pet
                          tranquilizer lying around your
                          bedroom.

                                        TAMMY
                        I have a rambunctious cat.  What
                        are you gonna do?

                                        WALT
                        Having this in your possession is
                        serious... you'll have a juvenile
                        record now...

                                        TAMMY
                        Oh well, there goes my full ride
                        to Harvard.

          Walt glances to Johnny - this isn't going anywhere...

                        Maybe she needs to be in rehab...

                                        TAMMY
                        She's not doing that many drugs. 
                        Do you know what they do to people
                        in those places?  They shoot you
                        full of tranqs and strap you in
                        bed.  Talk about danger.

                        I need a cigarette.

                        There's no smoking in the building.

                                        TAMMY
                                (looking over her
                                  shoulder at her Mom)
                        My mom's smoking.

          Walt frowns, hits the intercom...

                          breaking the law three feet away
                        from you.

          Hangs up; in the background we see a deputy tell the woman
          to put out the cigarette.  During Walt's action, Tammy
          studies Johnny...

                        I just want to get Jill home
                        safely.

                        It's not even any of your business. 
                        It's Jill life.  She has the right
                        to do whatever she... 

          She reacts as Johnny moves toward her with a purpose...
          she's not sure what he's about to do...

          He takes her wrist and holds it and RAMP TO HIS FACE...



          Johnny pulls a few items out of his dresser and packs
          them into a duffel/sports bag as BRUCE watches... and
          it's important to note that this tone is amiable and
            perfectly normal interplay for these two...

                        I sent me to check up on you.  A

                        I am.

                        I am.

          Bruce just stares at him.

                        Okay, one of my visions was a
                          little... 'off'...

                                        BRUCE
                        'A little off'... do you understand
                        what it means in the context of
                        the rest of humanity for your
                        brain to be a little off... that
                        puts you in another galaxy far,
                        far away.  A little off how and
                        don't spare the details...?

                                        JOHNNY
                        When I saw the girl in the alley... 
                        she wasn't her real age - she was
                        maybe six or seven years old...
                        dressed in a Halloween pixie
                        costume... like a... a leftover
                        from another vision I had of her
                        this morning... 

                                        BRUCE
                        This is Johnny's dead zone.  This
                        is Johnny's dead zone on drugs. 
                          Scrambled eggs, baby.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It was just a little
                            disconcerting... but I understood
                        what it meant...

                                        BRUCE
                        It meant you have to go back to
                        the hospital, John.

          Moving with them out of the bedroom...



                                        JOHNNY
                        I can't go back to the hospital...

                        mine: we don't screw around when
                        it comes to your brain.

                        Walt's in court all day.  Her
                          mother's got to stay by the phone. 
                        That leaves me.  

          Bruce looks at him, sighs.

                        All right.  But I'm not letting
                        you go alone.

                        Fine.  I could use your help.

                        I just need to find somebody to
                        cover for me at work.  Let me see
                        your cell, man... 

          Johnny hands him his cell phone... and as he does...

                        He's being difficult.  I'm gonna
                        need help to bring him in.

          as he reacts to this impending betrayal... except as Bruce
          finishes dialing...

                                (to phone)

                        for me this afternoon?  ...Thanks.

          He clicks off and tosses the phone back... Johnny realizes
          his vision was not accurate... but he's sure not going to
          tell that to Bruce... still Bruce notices something is
          wrong...

                                        BRUCE
                        What?

                          Nothing.  Can we go now?

                                (nods)
                        And don't even think about getting
                        behind the wheel...

          And they're out.



          A makeshift club with a DJ's sound-system in the corner,
          a few flashing lights, water bottles and light sticks
          everywhere and a MULTITUDE OF TEENAGERS dancing to a
          thumping techno beat.

          A rave is in full swing...

          CAMERA FINDS Scott (the young man we saw making drugs in
          the teaser) standing... suddenly without warning, he's
          grabbed by a hand with the same Cougar tattoo from Johnny's
          vision and pushed into the wall... and we're face to face
          with MALCOLM (late 20's, Caucasian, short hair, clean cut --
          put him in a suit and he could be lean and hungry junior
          exec, except for the brutal, amoral look in his eyes, the
          look of a true criminal; the young Ray Liotta).

                                        MALCOLM
                        What did I tell you?  What did I
                        tell you?

                                        SCOTT
                          Malcolm, I'm clean.

                                        MALCOLM
                        I don't think you are, Scotty.  I
                        hear you're dealing again.

                                        SCOTT
                        I'm not.

                                        MALCOLM
                        Oh.  So your chemistry set didn't
                        go up in smoke last night?  I'm
                          misinformed?

          Scott is busted and he knows it.

                        It's a limited marketplace.    
                        My profit margin is down and the
                        people I work with want to know
                        why and you're the why, Scotty. 
                        So you're gonna have to make it
                        good... from what we hear, you've
                          pocketed at least ten grand this
                        week...

                                        SCOTT
                        Ten grand.  That's crazy.  I don't
                        have ten grand... I'm completely
                        tapped out...

                                        MALCOLM
                        I hope you're lying, Scotty.  I
                        really hope for your sake you're
                        lying.  Because I need that money. 
                          Tomorrow. 

          Finding Jill on the dance floor, glancing over to see the
          action between Malcolm and Scott concluding... her eyes
          narrow with fear...

                                        MALCOLM
                                (to Scott)
                        Bright and early.  Early worm
                        catches the bird.  

          As he moves away, he sees Jill looking at him - their
          eyes connect.  We follow Malcolm through the crowd and we
          PAN DOWN and watch his legs disappear into a sea of legs
          and then moving to find among the legs A CANE.  WIDEN TO
          REVEAL Johnny making his way through the crowd in the
          opposite direction.  He looks over and acknowledges --

          JOHNNY

          reaches out and grabs Jill's arm.  She reacts, turns and
          as she does, we RAMP TO HIS FACE as we hear:

                                        BOY'S VOICE
                        Jill, come back!  You'll get lost.



          Bruce watches Dr. Tran prepare an injection of some sort...
          finding Johnny strapped in a bed... struggling... (and
          astute observers might recognize that his vision is
          similar, although exaggerated, to the description of rehabs
          that Tammy delivered at the station house.)  Off the shock
          of the flash --



          SARAH, trying to gather herself out of sleep, on the
          phone...

                        He stole your car?

          (From now on, in scenes where Johnny is alone, the camera
          work should become darker, more film noir.  His world
          should appear more ominous than it actually is -- the
          look should express the growing paranoia in Johnny's mind. 
          For example, this scene should be a MILD version of the
          driving scene in "Natural Born Killers.")

          Johnny drives, forcing himself to focus.  His cell phone
          RINGS.  He ignores it.  It keeps ringing.  Finally, he
          answers...

          Sarah who is trying to get dressed and talk on the wireless
          phone at the same time is frenetic... 

                                        SARAH
                        Johnny, are you all right?

          Johnny can guess why she's calling but he plays dumb,
          puts on a cheerful voice...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey, Sarah, what are you doing up

                        I'm up this late because I just
                        got a very scary call from Bruce.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah, well Bruce has a problem...

                        He has a problem...?  He says you
                        knocked him to the ground, stole
                        his car...

                          I didn't 'knock him to the ground'. 
                        It was a little push... he
                        tripped...

            Suddenly, the intercut takes a strange turn as we push to
          Johnny who looks at the phone -- and this time when we
          intercut to Sarah we're --



          And this is not real - it's Johnny's paranoid vision: in
          his mind, the office looks more like NORAD with
            sophisticated technical gear, scanners, satellite maps on
          monitors... experts working on isolating a signal...
          finding Walt signaling Sarah to stretch Johnny longer...
          she nods... now conspiratorial --

                        just tell me where you are...

                        You're tracing this call, aren't

                                        SARAH
                        What are you talking about...

                                        JOHNNY
                          I thought I could trust you, Sarah.  

          Johnny turns off the phone... after a beat, he throws it
          out the window.



          Back to reality.

                                        SARAH
                        Johnny?  Johnny?

          She knows he's hung up.  Off her reaction...



          The first warehouse we were in when the drugs exploded. 
          As Johnny walks through, on the wall is one of those
            wonderful film noir chiaroscuro shadows -- a bunch of
          vertical lines: shadows of the bars covering the windows.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          THE DEAD ZONE: ENEMY MIND - ACT TWO - 05/22/02 - YELLOW  24.

          NEW ANGLE

          As Johnny continues inside, NOT looking at the shadows,
          the shadows have now transformed into a silhouette of
          trees blowing softly in a breeze deep in a poplar forest...

          Johnny reaches the same area which, in the teaser, Jill
          and Scott were "squatting" in, but now their items are
          gone...

          Johnny looks through the debris on the floor.  Picks up a
          few junk food wrappers, doesn't get any visions.  But
          then he finds a dime, picks it up and --



          (Note: The diner must have a rear exit.) Jill eats a
            breakfast burrito with gusto.  She's hungry, yet with
            occasionally full mouth, she still unburdens herself to
          Johnny.  An extra bag full of food - Scott's bag - is
          also on the table.

                                        JILL
                        Leave it to my mother to hire a
                        psychic to find me...

                          I wasn't hired...

                        You just do this for fun.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I did this because I saw how
                        worried your mother was when the
                        Sheriff introduced her to me.

                          I called Tammy yesterday.  She
                        told me about you.  She said you
                        like invaded her soul... she thinks
                        you're a psychic peeping Tom...

                        that way...

                          Totally.  So far I'm not impressed.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I found you, didn't I?

                        Your mom has a cork sculpture of
                        a tiny Chinese village, and when
                        you were a little girl, you used
                        to stare at it for hours,
                          daydreaming that you lived in the
                        little house on the island.  You
                        were married and had a little
                        baby and the stork flying over
                        the house was your pet.

          By now, Jill has stopped chewing in shock and now she
          swallows hard.  She stares at him incredulously...

                                        JOHNNY
                        You'd already started running

                        Or do you...?

          Johnny glances out the window... eyes narrow as he sees --

          incongruous in the middle of this downtown gritty district.

                        you and your mom are suddenly

                        My mother doesn't want me home...
                        She was going to send me away.  I
                        just saved her the trouble.

                        Talk to her.  Just like this. 
                        Neutral location.  She can come
                        here.

                        I can't talk to her.  I've never
                        been able to talk to her.

                                        JOHNNY
                        There are people who can help
                        with those kinds of things.

                                        JILL
                        It's too late for that.  I mean,
                        it's not like I'm planning on
                        doing drugs the rest of my life. 
                        I even told her that I'd go to
                          meetings, you know, like A-A,
                          whatever, but she said she couldn't
                        trust me.  She's never trusted
                        me.
                                (beat, and that hurts)
                        So I left.  And I'm doing all
                        right.  I've got the nicest
                          boyfriend I ever had.  We're even
                        getting an apartment together as
                        soon as we have the money, which
                        we'd probably already have if
                        this psychic guy hadn't shown the
                        cops where our lab was...

          RESUME JOHNNY

          Johnny shakes his head... she tears off a check and hands
          it to him and on the exchange -- RAMP TO HIS FACE...


  4747THE WAITRESS - A MINUTE INTO THE FUTURE

          in another part of the diner turns to greet a new customer
          as the door opens and Malcolm enters - Johnny sees the
          Cougar tattoo on his hand as he makes eye contact with
          Jill who looks scared... but before we can see what happens
          next, time seems to slow and then actually GOES BACKWARDS
          (STEADY CAM) as though it has stretched like a rubber
          band too far and then is snapped back -- as Johnny's drug-
          induced weird vision shows Malcolm reversing course - and
          this is like a magic carpet ride - with a WHOOSH - Malcolm
          flying backwards in time out the door and down the street
          (walking in reverse) backing into one alley and then
          another... where he is arriving back at the body of Scott,
          sprawled at the foot of the dumpster.

          In this reverse action, Scott stands and Malcolm pulls
          the knife out of him, and then the action begins to move
          forward.  Malcolm kills Scott again, Scott's body falls
          to the ground, and as Malcolm begins to leave the alley
          the vision ends and we...

          Bruce, Walt, and Sarah look around but no Johnny.  The

          JILL

          She grabs Johnny's arm and coaxes him to follow her... as
          she touches him... Johnny notices...


          ON THE WALL - THE SHADOW OF A COUGAR STALKING PREY 


          JOHNNY

            hesitates... doesn't stand... she looks at him...

                                        JILL
                                (whispers)
                        What?

          He looks around confused...

                                        JILL
                        Come on... he's gone... I think
                        he went upstairs...

                                        JOHNNY
                          I can't.

                        What's wrong?

                                        JOHNNY

                        I'm lost in the woods.

          And as she reacts confused... we track around them to
          reveal that - to Johnny - they're in the woods, surrounded
          by trees as far as the eye can see...

                                                                              FADE OUT:

          FADE IN:


          As before, very very dark... Johnny holds tightly onto
          her wrist... as though he's holding on to reality itself...
            whispering...

                                        JILL
                        But that was yesterday... the
                        drugs should have worn off by
                        now...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe in other people...

                                        JILL
                        Are you still in the woods?


    6666FAVORING HIS ANGLE

          to see that he still sees them surrounded by the woods...
          he nods, in his own way blind... ...

                                        JOHNNY
                        It doesn't usually stay like
                        this... for this long... I just
                        can't get out of it...

          The teenage Jill is in the woods with him in this view in
          matching proximity as the industrial plant... and as chatty
          as the dialogue sounds... Johnny is still gripping her
          arm and she's scared half to death... so it's not meant
          to be funny when she says:

                        I got lost in the woods when I
                        was six.  At a Halloween party.

                        I know.

          She realizes what she has to do in this situation and she
          rises to the challenge.  She moves to look him straight
          in the eye...

                        I can't remember ever being so
                        scared.  But I got out.  And so
                        will we.  Okay?

                        I've been through bad trips of my
                        own... people helped me get through
                        them... I'm going to help you
                        now... the important thing is to
                        get us out of here, okay?  Can
                        you trust me to do that?

          Johnny actually has to smile...

                        I'll make you a deal.  If you

          She takes his hand and they rise...


  6767RESUME INDUSTRIAL PLANT - CONTINUOUS

          They obviously have to keep their voices low... but she
          needs to maintain aural contact with him...

          They move out of their hiding place and she looks in the
          darkness for any sign of Malcolm as she leads Johnny toward
          the way out...

                        one of them over some garbage
                        cans... and my old girlfriend
                        who's married to the sheriff was
                        tracing me by satellite through

                        Just remember that your mind reacts
                        to stuff in unexpected and
                          sometimes scary ways.  I can help
                        you control it...

          The growl of a large cat startles Johnny and he turns to
          see --


          ANGLE ON THE WALL - THE SHADOW OF THE COUGAR

          Jill pauses...

  6868THE SHADOW

          ...belongs to a REAL Cougar and when the CAMERA MOVES and
          finds it, its appearance takes us into...



          reacts to the yell too... looking for another way out...
          Jill bites his hand... and he groans and drops her...

                                        JILL
                        Over here!



          and the Cougar is right behind him.  The cougar LEAPS at
          Johnny, and it is as if the cougar brings the woods with
          him and we go back to --          THE DEAD ZONE: ENEMY MIND - ACT FOUR - 05/22/02 - YELLOW  46.



          And we see it is not a stick in Johnny's hand but the
          cane.  Malcolm reels.

          We now INTERCUT between the woods and the plant, a la
          "Altered States."  Each time Johnny swings the branch/cane,
          when it lands on Malcolm, the impact momentarily snaps us
          back into reality...

          Finally, Johnny swings the branch/cane and catches Malcolm
          flush on the side of the head and Malcolm falls... This
          last HIT ends this intercut and now we STAY in:



          as Malcolm falls backwards yelling very briefly.


          ANGLE - LOOKING DOWN AT MALCOLM

          We see he's fallen on some industrial equipment below
          grade.  He is strangely contorted - clearly he's broken
          his back and neck...  Blood oozes from his mouth.

          A beat later, Walt, Bruce Sarah and Kohlan, gun drawn,
          run up... and look down at the dead man...

                          Johnny...

          Johnny out of breath... just looks at them...

8080A MONTAGE

          -- Close on Jill, sitting in the back seat of the Cruiser,
          mind thinking about an uncertain future, as the car heads
          back to Cleaves Mills...

          -- a forensic team by the dumpster... the taped outline
          of Scott's body is all that's left of him.

          -- The rave... finding Tammy dancing... laughing...
            stoned...

          -- The hospital... where Dr. Tran examines Johnny... 
          Sarah looking on from the waiting room.          THE DEAD ZONE: ENEMY MIND - ACT FOUR - 05/17/02 - BLUE  48.



          Mrs. Derr looks exhausted... the television is on in the
            background... and canned sitcom laughter fills the scene
          as she pours herself a cup of herb tea at the kitchen
          counter... for a beat, the day catches up to her and her
          mind drifts and she just stands there thinking but then
          she pulls herself back to the moment and we may realize
          this sort of thing happens a hundred if not a thousand
          times a day.  She reacts as she hears a door shut... and
          her first thought is that it's on the TV... but then she
          realizes who it might be... because every door you hear
          might be the door that brings her back... and this time
          her dreams are realized because as she moves out of the
          kitchen, she sees Jill standing there... and as mother
          and daughter's eyes ask so many questions, a tear rolls
          down Jill's cheek... and she moves into the arms of her
            mother... and these two very troubled women hold each
          other for support... as the sitcom laugh track howls in
          the background...

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

          Johnny looks over at the doorway from whence the sound
          came.


          ANGLE ON THE DOORWAY

          as Jill sticks her hand around the doorframe.  It's holding
          the Tinker Bell wand, the right distance above the floor
          where a child would hold it.  Johnny reacts as Jill pokes
          her head around the doorframe as well, and we see it's
          the 16-year-old Jill -- she's just kneeling to make herself
          appear shorter.

                        You know, you may have a flashback
                        or two someday.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I know who to call when I do. 
                              (a beat, a smile)
                        How about you?  How're you doing
                        at home?

                                        JILL
                        Clean and sober for three days.

                                        JOHNNY
                            Congratulations. 

                                        JILL
                        I'm doing the meetings.  'Hi, my
                        name is Jill and I'm an addict. 
                                (as crowd)
                        'Hi, Jill'... they drive me crazy
                        but hey, it's better than a lock-
                        up... My mom and I... we're in
                          counseling... we cry a lot...
                                (beat, sad)
                        I'm going to Castle Rock this
                        weekend for Scott's funeral.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm sorry.  It'll be difficult. 
                        But you'll find later it helps to
                        say good-bye.

          She nods, thoughtfully, they exchange a look.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You know, you never told me...

                                        JILL
                        What?

                                        JOHNNY
                        How you got out of the woods when
                        you were a little girl...

                        I ran and ran around in there
                        until I got tired and sat down. 
                        My mom; she heard me crying and
                        found me.

          They exchange an intimate look...

                                        JILL
                                (moving quickly by
                                the sentiment)
                        Hey, I brought something else...
                        when I was a kid my mom used to
                        read this to me when I was sick
                        in bed... now I'm going to read
                        it to you...

          She shows Johnny a book:  Alice's Adventures In
            Wonderland...

                                        JOHNNY
                        My favorite.  After this we can
                        sing a few choruses of "Puff the
                        Magic Dragon"...

          And as Jill opens the book and begins to read the opening
          lines...

                                        JILL
                        "Alice was beginning to get very
                        tired of sitting by her sister on
                        the bank, and of having nothing
                        to do..."

          And we pull back and...

                                                                              FADE OUT:
