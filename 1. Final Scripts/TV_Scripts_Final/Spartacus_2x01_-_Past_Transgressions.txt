  INT. BATIATUS' VILLA - NIGHT (EP 113 SEASON 1)

  [NEW MATERIAL] A SWIRL OF RED fades into existence. 
  Beautiful. Mesmerizing. We PULL BACK to reveal BLOOD spewing 
  in slow motion as a ROMAN GUARD lazily flies through the 
  FRAME, dying from massive wounds.

  RAMP TO NORMAL SPEED

  as he crashes to the ground, dead. THREE MORE GUARDS rush 
  in, stepping over their fallen comrade to confront the cause 
  of his brutal end.

  SPARTACUS

  greets them, his sword drawing fresh blood. He moves with 
  deadly purpose, striking the Guards down in a gory display. 
  NOBLE ROMANS scream as they rush to flee the slaughter. 
  Spartacus ignores them, bellowing for the only man he seeks.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Batiatus!

  A threat. A challenge. A promise of impending doom...


  INT. TROPHY ROOM - BATIATUS' VILLA - NIGHT (EP 113 SEASON 1)

  [MATERIAL SHOT IN SEASON 1] Batiatus hustles through the 
  carnage with Lucretia, Domitia, Numerius, and Aurelia. They 
  stumble upon a dying Guard.

                        Why would she do such a thing --

  A Gladiator surges behind her, slicing her open in an 
  eruption of blood.

  CONTINUED:

  Batiatus grabs the dead Guard s sword and runs the Gladiator 
  through. Batiatus rips his sword free, shouts to Lucretia 
  and the others.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Go!

                        GO!

  Batiatus hustles off, sword clenched in trembling hand.


  INT. BATIATUS  VILLA - NIGHT (EP 113 SEASON 1)

  [NEW MATERIAL] Several NOBLE ROMANS flee from two blood-
  splattered GLADIATORS. BATIATUS appears after they exit. 
  SCREAMS echo as the Gladiators catch up to their prey OFF 
  SCREEN. Batiatus considers his options, cautiously heads in 
  the opposite direction.

  FOLLOW BATIATUS

  as he weaves through the destruction. He holds his breath as 
  a pack of Gladiators pass nearby, hooting and laughing. He 
  turns to go, but is startled by a WOUNDED ROMAN staggering 
  out of the shadows.

                                          WOUNDED ROMAN
                                  sputtering blood)(
                        Help me! Please, Batiatus!

                                        BATIATUS
                        Still yourself, you fucking --

  Too late. A BURLY GLADIATOR appears, drawn by the noise. He 
  grins as he spots Batiatus, rushing for him. Batiatus 
  whirls, shoving the Wounded Roman in his path. Wounded Roman 
  gets a sword through his chest, but Burly Gladiator is 
  knocked to the ground.

  BATIATUS POUNCES,

    decapitating Burly Gladiator before he can recover. Batiatus 
  spits on the severed head in contempt as he moves on -- and 
  runs afoul of RHASKOS and a knot of blood-drenched warriors.





                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    3.
  CONTINUED:

  BATIATUS TAKES OFF,

  running for his life. Rhaskos and the others howl in 
  delight, giving chase. They finally corner him in

  THE ATRIUM

  [MATERIAL SHOT IN SEASON 1] Bodies litter the floor. Crixus 
  and Agron glance over, both bloodied and spent. Rhaskos and 
  the Gladiators laugh and jeer, taunting their master. 
  Batiatus wields his sword, desperately trying to keep them 
  at bay.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        I am your Dominus! I will see your 
                        fucking hearts for this!

                        Quintus...

  Batiatus freezes in horror as he spots Lucretia, clutching 
  her stomach, the wound Crixus inflicted gushing blood.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Lucretia!

  Batiatus starts to go to her as she collapses, but is 
  intercepted by Spartacus, his eyes blazing with hot desire 
  for revenge.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        What would you do? To hold your 
                        wife again? To feel the warmth of 
                        her skin? The taste of her lips? 
                        How many men would you kill? A 
                        hundred? A thousand? There stands 
                        but one, between you and her.

  Batiatus screams, attacking. Spartacus counters, driving him 
  to the ground, sword to his neck.

                                          SPARTACUS(cont'd)
                      Go to her. Tell her the gods 
                        themselves will not keep you apart. 
                        Lie. As you lied to me of my wife.

  Spartacus releases him. Batiatus rises, trembling as he 
  scans his men for mercy. His eyes fall on Doctore, entering 
  with a shell-shocked Aurelia.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Oenomaus...


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    4.
  CONTINUED:

  Oenomaus averts his gaze. Batiatus swells, fear giving way 
  to rage. He abandons his sword, locking eyes with Spartacus 
  in defiance.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        You were nothing before me! I gave 
                        you the fucking heavens! I gave you 
                        means to accept your fate!

                                          SPARTACUS
                        And now you are destroyed by it.

  Spartacus HACKS OPEN BATIATUS' THROAT. Batiatus sputters in 
  shock as BLOOD spews from his ruined neck. He staggers 
  towards Lucretia, collapsing on the crimson floor next to 
  her. [NEW MATERIAL FOLLOWS]

  PUSH IN ON BATIATUS

  as the life begins to fade from his eyes. OFF SCREEN we hear 
  Spartacus' voice coming through in DISTORTED WAVES as he 
  makes his rousing speech to the liberated slaves.

                                          SPARTACUS (O.S.)
                        I have done this thing... because 
                      it was just. Blood demands blood...

  CONTINUE PUSHING IN. Batiatus' EYES fill the FRAME. 
  Spartacus' voice is replaced by the cacophony of a CHEERING 
  CROWD. The sound swells to a DEAFENING ROAR, propelling us 
  to --


  EXT. OLD CAPUA ARENA - DAY

  Not the spectacular arena from Season 1. No grand 
    appointments, no fluttering awnings to shield spectators 
  from the blazing sun. Much smaller and in disrepair.

  THE MOTLEY CROWD ROARS

  as two GLADIATORS trade deadly blows on the sand. It's a 
  dirty, brutal fight, lacking in refinement.

  REVEAL BATIATUS,

  frowning sourly, jammed in with the common dregs in the 
  stands. He's slightly younger at this point in time, his 
  hair not yet troubled by encroaching gray. With him are his 
  body slave ACCO (large brute), LUCRETIA (slightly younger, 
  natural hair), her body slave MELITTA (30-ish, curvy red- 
  haired beauty -- has a tattoo on the back of her shoulder 
  like Naevia did in season 1), and several ATTENDING SLAVES.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    5.

  LUCRETIA

  jumps at a bone-jarring blow, laughs.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        The fights are particularly 
                        entertaining this morning.

  A DIRTY FAN too close at hand erupts, spilling wine.

                                        DIRTY FAN
                        Fucking kill him!

                                        BATIATUS
                                (frowning, to 
                                  Lucretia)
                        I would find it more so viewed from 
                        the pulvinus.

  He glances up to the "pulvinus," which is little more than a 
  roped off area set up and apart from the unwashed masses. 
  VETTIUS, a holier-than-thou young lanista (early 20s) from 
  Nola, holds court with upper crust Romans. Two seats next to 
  him are conspicuously empty. Vettius spots Batiatus, tosses 
  him a smug grin. Batiatus smiles politely.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                                  through the smile)(
                        Fucking shit eater.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Let Vettius preen like a woman. You 
                        will school him in the ways of men, 
                        when Gannicus takes to the sands.

  Batiatus eyes the empty seats in the pulvinus.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Absent Tullius and the Magistrate 
                      to bear witness, what's the fucking 
                        purpose? One man in today's games. 
                        One only, and the seats needing to 
                        impress stand empty as Vettius' 
                        head.

  SOLONIUS appears, pushing his way through the throngs with a 
  frown of distaste. Batiatus greets him warmly. At this point 
  in time they are as brothers.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Solonius! What news do you bring?



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    6.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Tullius and the Magistrate were 
                        delayed with pressing business, but 
                        arrive shortly. As long as the 
                        current match --

  The crowd ROARS as one of the Gladiators goes down in a 
  spray of blood. Batiatus leaps to his feet.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Get up! Get up, you fucking...

  The Gladiator coughs a gout of blood, goes still. Batiatus 
  throws his hands up in frustration as the body is dragged 
  off. Vettius waves down for the next match to begin.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      He begins the match? Without proper 
                          introduction?

                                        BATIATUS
                        Proper? Vettius and the word are of 
                        distant relation.

  A grungy MURMILLO gladiator takes his position in the arena. 
  Helmet, heavy shield, sword.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        I for one am grateful to be spared 
                        his oratory. The man's voice causes 
                        skull to ache.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Gannicus takes position!

  GANNICUS appears -- and he is a golden fucking god. Late 
  20s, tall and muscular, with a perpetual twinkle in his eye 
  and a grin on his lips. Han Solo by way of Achilles. Two 
  swords, no helmet. A leather necklace graces his throat (the 
  exact same one Crixus wears in Season 1). Batiatus cheers.

                                        BATIATUS
                                to the crowd)(
                        Now there is a fucking gladiator!

  Gannicus takes his position opposite the Murmillo. He 
  assesses the man from head to toe. And laughs. Really? This 
  is who he's fighting? He glances up to the pulvinus, 
  awaiting the signal.

                                          VETTIUS
                        Begin!


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    7.
  CONTINUED:

  The Murmillo attacks. Gannicus counters -- and he ain't your 
  daddy's gladiator. He's a showboater, laughing and playing 
  to the crowd as he trades blows with the deadly serious 
  Murmillo. Solonius sighs in disapproval.

                                        SOLONIUS
                      Is your man ever of a serious note?

                                        BATIATUS
                      He can strip naked and fight with 
                        his cock, as long as he wins.

  A SEXY WOMAN in the crowd exposes herself for Gannicus. He 
  grins at her, laughing in approval. The Murmillo strikes, 
  slicing open Gannicus' arm while he's distracted.

                                        MELITTA,
                        Lucretia's body slave, reacts to 
                        the injury. Worry clouds her eyes. 
                        Batiatus shares her concern.

  GANNICUS

  glances at the blood dripping down his arm, locks eyes with 
  the Murmillo. The Murmillo tenses, waiting for Gannicus to 
  retaliate. But instead Gannicus stabs his swords into the 
  ground, disarming himself.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        What is he doing? Quintus --

  Gannicus throws his arms out, mocking the Murmillo, daring 
  him to attack. Murmillo hesitates, then surges forward, 
  hacking and slashing. Gannicus deftly avoids each blow -- 
  and kicks the man in the ass for good measure.

  THE CROWD HOWLS

  in approval. Vettius frowns from the pulvinus, whispers 
  something disapproving to the man next to him. Batiatus eyes 
  the empty seats in the pulvinus, turns back to whisper 
  pleading instruction to Gannicus.

                                        BATIATUS
                      Do not kill him yet... Do not --

  Gannicus retrieves his swords and lands half a dozen 
  lightning fast blows. Batiatus sags. The Murmillo sinks to 
  his knees, keels over dead. Gannicus throws his arms up. The 
  crowd LAUGHS and CHEERS.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    8.

  PULVINUS

  TULLIUS and MAGISTRATE SEXTUS (ep 113, Season 1) finally 
  arrive. Tullius is a dark, handsome man in his mid 40s, 
  flanked by his huge, deadly bodyguard THERON. Vettius leaps 
  up to greet them.

  THE STANDS

  Batiatus glowers at the sight.

                        A victory regardless.

                        Won in dewy morn. The important 
                        matches do not even begin until 
                        after the midday sun has passed.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Consider yourself fortunate to have 
                        a man in the games at all. Good 
                        Solonius stands with empty hands.

  Batiatus laughs, realizing the truth in that. He clasps his 
  friend on the back.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Come then. Let us see them filled 
                        with drink.

                        Tell Doctore to see Gannicus back 
                      to the ludus. And properly rewarded 
                        for his showing.

                        Can we not stay for the rest of the 
                        games?

                                        BATIATUS
                        Vettius  men command the prominent 
                        matches. He has more than enough 
                        eyes to watch him stroke his cock. 
                        I would not add ours to the fucking 
                        sight.

  Batiatus rises, WIPING US TO --                                                                                    9.


  INT. CHUTES - OLD ARENA - DAY

  Batiatus' Attending Slave weaves through the dilapidated 
  wooden chutes, maneuvering past dead and wounded Gladiators.

                                          ATTENDING SLAVE
                                (spotting someone

                        Doctore.

  REVEAL DOCTORE -- but it isn't Oenomaus. This DOCTORE is a 
  grizzled giant of a man. Skin baked a golden bronze, white 
  SCARS standing out in stark contrast. He wears the 
  chestplate that Oenomaus one day will take possession of, 
  but at this point it is merely weathered and has not been 
  patched up.

                                          ATTENDING SLAVE(cont'd)

                        the ludus, and seen to reward.

  OTHO, a big bearded slab of ugly, laughs as he spots 
  Gannicus returning through the chute gate.

                                        OTHO
                        Perhaps one day the pretty little 
                        bitch will fight later in the 
                        afternoon. With the rest of the 
                        men.

  The Gladiators chuckle. Gannicus grins mirthlessly.

                                        GANNICUS
                        You and your tiny cock best pray 
                        that day never comes.

  Otho GRUNTS, starts for him. Gannicus is ready to go. 
  Doctore intervenes.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Save blood for the fucking sands. 
                        Gannicus.

  Gannicus grins, blowing Otho a kiss as Doctore leads him 
  away. Otho spits in disgust, continues suiting up. Doctore 
  hisses at Gannicus.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)

                      an arm and both legs.

                        Hubris. A fine quality. Often 
                        possessed by cunts who have 
                        perished from it.

  Doctore leads Gannicus out, WIPING US TO --


  EXT. CAPUA STREETS - DAY

  ARM DOWN into the bustling streets of Capua. MERCHANTS hawk 
  their wares. Questionable meats perfume the air. PROSTITUTES 
  display their charms.

  BATIATUS

  strolls through the chaos with Solonius and Lucretia. They 
  are closely followed by Melitta, Acco, and Attending Slaves.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Did you catch the manner of his 
                        eye, as he gazed down from the 
                        pulvinus? Fucking Vettius. Barely 
                        free of his mother's tit, yet 
                        carries himself above lanistas of 
                        more deserving years.

  Batiatus drinks from a wine skin, passes it to Solonius.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Youth often imagines itself swollen 
                        beyond its worth.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Time will cure him of the 
                        condition, as it does all foolish 
                        young men.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Time is what he holds in abundance. 
                        The new arena will be finished in 
                        but a handful of months. If we are 
                        excluded from the opening games...

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Vettius is but shit from a shit 
                        town.  How could Tullius and the 
                        Magistrate favor a boy from Nola 
                        over Capua's own sons?

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    11.

                                        SOLONIUS
                      We must prove ourselves in the more 
                        important bouts in the old arena 
                        and secure position.

                      To fight later in the day we must 
                        first distinguish ourselves against 
                        Vettius' men. Yet Vettius' men only 
                        fight later in the day.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        A vexing conundrum.

                                          WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Lucretia?!

  Lucretia turns, shocked to see GAIA launching out of the 
  crowd. Gaia is a stunning beauty dripping with sexuality and 
  mischief, a few years younger than Lucretia (early 30s). 
  She s dressed in the finest appointments, jewels, and an 
  expensive BRACELET adding to the image. Currently blonde, 
  she wears the wigs that we will see Lucretia in during 
  Season 1.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Gaia!

  They both shriek like schoolgirls, throwing their arms 
  around each other. Solonius forces a smile, eyeing the crowd 
  to make sure no one of note has witnessed the break in 
  decorum.

                                          LUCRETIA(cont'd)
                        You return to Capua without telling 
                        me?

                        I have only this moment arrived, 
                        with intentions of seeking you out.

                        this life, at least.

                        and gossip?

  Lucretia kisses Batiatus and heads off with Gaia. Melitta 
  and a few Attending Slaves follow in their wake.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        You must tell me everything. Secret 
                      no detail.

                        Removed from the ears of men, my 
                        lips willingly part...

  She gives Batiatus and Solonius a smile as she heads off. 
  Solonius admires Gaia as she goes.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Gaia returns unencumbered. And in

  He clasps Solonius on the back, leading him away. Acco and

  A SIDE STREET

  In the distance the new Capua arena looms, now 80 percent 
  complete. WORKER SLAVES haul stones and equipment past 
  Batiatus and Solonius, heading for the construction site. 
  Batiatus takes in the splendor of it.

                        I would shout his fucking praise to 
                        the heavens. His hands shaped 
                        events resulting in the erection of 
                        the new arena. He supplies slaves 
                        from the furthest reaches of the 
                        Republic to help speed its 
                        completion. Through the ambitions 
                      of Tullius, Capua is elevated. A 
                        lesson to be studied, and 
                        reproduced in kind.

                                        SOLONIUS
                                  laughs)(
                      Is that all? Well, a simple task 
                        then, Batiatus.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Between us, we have the greatest 
                        gladiators in Capua. Gannicus, 
                        Barca, Arkadios, Decabalis -- Men 
                        forged into something beyond their 
                        worth. Beyond anything that smug 
                        little piss Vettius could ever hope 
                      to offer --

  A commotion interrupts. One of Tullius' Worker Slaves has 
  abandoned his stones in favor of beating the shit out of 
  another. Brutal and ugly. Citizens shout in surprise, 
  scampering out of the way.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Perhaps Tullius should not have 
                        strayed so far abroad in acquiring 
                        his slaves.

  Worker Slave #1 gets his opponent down, fists hammering his 
  face into pulp. APPIUS, a large, bearded slaver, rushes in 
  with two GUARDS. They smash Worker Slave #1 off -- revealing 
  a younger CRIXUS. Hair wild, chin stubbled with beard, face 
  not yet scarred from years in the arena.

                                        APPIUS
                        Crixus! You know of the rules.
                                to other slaves)(
                      No one breaks the line!


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    15.

  He raises a spiked club to bash Crixus' brains in, but 
  Batiatus intervenes.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Hold! This is one of good Tullius' 
                        slaves?

  Appius eyes Batiatus suspiciously.

                                        APPIUS
                      It is.

                                        BATIATUS
                                (fishing out coin 
                                  purse)
                        I would make purchase.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Purchase?

                                        BATIATUS
                        What is the man's worth?

                                        APPIUS
                      He is not for sale.

  Appius raises his club again.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Fifty denarii.

                                        SOLONIUS
                                  hissing to him)(
                        What are you doing?

                                        BATIATUS
                                  whispered)(
                        Seizing balls.

                                        APPIUS
                        The man is barely worth ten. Why 
                        would you pay such a sum for a shit 
                        Gaul?

                                        BATIATUS
                        Shit? Do you not see the promise in 
                        his eyes? The spark smoldering 
                        within his breast? I would give it 
                        tender, to ignite in the arena!

  Appius hesitates, tempted.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    16.

                                        APPIUS
                        Fifty?

                                        BATIATUS
                        And an extra five to weight your 
                        own purse.

  Appius licks his lips, nods. Batiatus grins, counts out his 
  coins. Realizes he's a few denarii short. He whispers to 
  Solonius.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Loan me twenty denarii.

  Solonius sighs, digs into his own purse.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        You pay too much for the man.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The man is nothing. I pay to gain 
                        favor with Tullius.

  Batiatus hands the coins over. Appius snorts.

                                        APPIUS
                        A waste of coin. The shit fuck will 
                        never be a gladiator.

  Batiatus takes Crixus in, musing on that.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Even the lowest man can rise beyond 
                        the heavens, if tempted with proper 
                        reward...

  OFF Batiatus' calculating grin...


  INT. GANNICUS' CELL - BATIATUS' LUDUS - DAY

  The same cell Spartacus received in episode 106 after his 
  victory over Theokoles. Gannicus fucks two BEAUTIFUL SLAVE 
  GIRLS. Everyone is drinking and laughing and having a 
  rollicking good time. Wine flows. Passions climax. Slave 
  Girl #1 writhes in ecstasy as she orgasms, SMASHING US TO --


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS' LUDUS - SUNSET

  PRACTICE SWORDS clash as GLADIATORS train under the watchful 
  eye of Doctore.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    17.
  CONTINUED:

  OENOMAUS WIELDS A SWORD,

  the golden rays of the setting sun bathing his marbled flesh 
  as he spars with BARCA (training as a Hoplomachus, with 
  spear and shield). Oenomaus is still a gladiator at this 
  point, although the scars marring his chest, back, and face 
  indicate that his fight with Theokoles is in the past.

  AUCTUS,

    a well-muscled tank of a man (and Barca s lover), spars with 
  GNAEUS nearby. Auctus is also a Hoplomachus, but Gnaeus 
  trains as a Thraex, not the Retiarius he will later become.

  NEW RECRUITS,

  the Mark of the Brotherhood yet to be earned, train in the 
  background. Among them are ASHUR (heavily muscled, face 
  clean shaven), DAGAN, a hulking Syrian, and INDUS, a svelte, 
  athletic youth.

  GANNICUS' CELL DOOR OPENS

  across the square. The Slave Girls spill out, exhausted and 
  glowing. Melitta is waiting with a GUARD to escort them back 
  up to the villa.

                                          MELITTA
                      He was well satisfied?

  Gannicus appears, sweaty, a jug of wine in hand as he ties a 
  bit of cloth around his waist, barely hiding his nakedness.

                                        GANNICUS
                        Very well.

  He grins, smacking one of the girls on the ass as Melitta 
  leads them to the mess hall gate.

                                          MELITTA
                        Dominus will be pleased.

                                        GANNICUS
                        Not as much as I am.

                                          MELITTA
                        When are you not so? Especially 
                        with yourself?

                                        GANNICUS
                      It is a curse. Being blessed with 
                      so much to offer.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    18.
  CONTINUED:

  Gannicus grins, taking a swig of wine. The two have an 
  easygoing friendship, filled with good-natured barbs.

                                          MELITTA
                        And so few interested in sharing 
                        it.

  Melitta catches Oenomaus' eye across the square, graces him 
  with a loaded smile. Oenomaus returns it.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Doctore. A moment?

  Doctore laughs, signals him permission.

  MESS HALL GATE

  The Guard opens the gate leading up to the villa. Melitta 
  shoos the Slave Girls in.

                                          MELITTA
                        See yourselves well scrubbed. I 
                        would not have you smell of goat.

                                        GANNICUS
                                  sniffing himself)(
                        Goat?

                                        OENOMAUS (O.S.)
                        A dead one.

  Gannicus breaks into a toothy grin, clasping forearms with 
  Oenomaus as he joins them.

                                        GANNICUS
                        The smell of victory, brother.

                                        OENOMAUS
                                  laughs)(
                        Well earned. The men all speak of 
                        your triumph.

  Melitta catches the longing in Oenomaus' eyes.

                                          MELITTA
                      As they will of yours, when you 
                        return to the arena.

                                        GANNICUS
                        The crowd will fucking cum in great 
                        geysers, drenching the gods 
                        gathered to witness Oenomaus once 
                        more upon the sands!

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    19.

  Oenomaus forces a smile, uncertain the day will ever come.

                        I would have words with my wife.

                        Absent your cock, which has escaped 
                        you.

  Gannicus laughs, adjusting his wrap below FRAME.

                                        GANNICUS
                      It will be missed.

  He drinks, heading off to the baths in all his naked glory. 
  Oenomaus turns to Melitta, anxious.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Has Dominus spoken of my return?

                        Almost a year has past since I 
                        faced Theokoles. Perhaps Dominus 
                        does not intend --

                                          MELITTA
                        You were the only one to ever stand 
                        against the Shadow of Death and 
                        live. Batiatus would be a fool to 
                        keep you from the arena.

                                        OENOMAUS
                      Or I am the fool, for dreaming of 
                        such a thing.

                                          MELITTA
                        You are many things. Foolish is not 
                        among them. Batiatus waits but for 
                        the perfect moment for his champion 
                      to retake glory.

  She pulls him into a passionate kiss.

                                          MELITTA(cont'd)
                        Now see your ass back to training, 
                        and be well prepared for the day.

  She disappears with a grin up the stairs. Oenomaus watches 
  her go with a warm smile, her love and confidence 
  infectious. He moves back to the square, WIPING US TO --                                                                                    20.


  INT. BATIATUS' VILLA - NIGHT

  DIONA, a pretty young slave barely out of her teens, and her 
  best friend NAEVIA titter as they pelt the two Slave Girls 
  with questions about Gannicus' prowess. [NOTE: Naevia does 
  not have the tattoo on the back of her shoulder yet.]

                                        DIONA
                      Is it true? That his thing is large 
                      as a horse's?

                                        NAEVIA
                        Diona!

                                        DIONA
                        Are you not curious?

                                (hesitates, to 
                                  Slave Girls)
                      Is Gannicus  really that big?

  Diona and Naevia shriek with laughter -- which they quickly

                      In the triclinium with her guest.

                        Diona, see the girls bathed.

                                        DIONA
                        Yes, Melitta.

  Diona exits, giggling with the girls. Naevia falls into step 
  with Melitta as she moves off. Melitta glances sideways at 
  Naevia.

                                          MELITTA
                      It is exciting, speaking of such 
                        things, is it not?

  Naevia isn't sure how to answer. Melitta laughs. She 
  obviously has a fondness for Naevia, as a big sister would 
  towards a younger sibling.

                                          MELITTA(cont'd)
                        I was of a similar age, not so long 
                        ago.  I know the giddy enticement 
                      of the subject.

                        Yet you and Diona should turn 
                        thought from it. Soon enough your 
                        flowers will be plucked. Hastening 
                        the moment will only result in 
                        bruising of the petals.

  Naevia nods uncomfortably, feeling properly chastised.

                                          MELITTA(cont'd)
                        And in regards to Gannicus... I 
                        have seen bigger.

  Melitta hits her with a wry smile. OFF Naevia, forcing back 
  a laugh...


  INT. TRICLINIUM - BATIATUS' VILLA - NIGHT

  Lucretia and Gaia lounge, drinking and laughing.

                        You do not seem overly distraught 
                      at his passing.

                        But when you left Capua I thought 
                        you madly in love.

                                        GAIA
                        I was -- with his purse. Sadly his 
                        fortunes went dry towards the end.

  Lucretia eyes Gaia's expensive dress and jewelry with a 
  knowing smile.

                                        LUCRETIA

  She removes her jewel-studded bracelet, places it around 
  Lucretia's wrist.

                        pleasures to be shared...

  She kisses her on the lips, lingering for a moment before 
  returning to her wine. From Lucretia's lack of reaction, it 
  is not an uncommon thing between them.

                        Everything has changed, and for the 
                        better, by the judging of it. When 
                        last we parted, this house was a 
                        tomb, haunted by the living specter 
                      of your husband's father. And you,

  Melitta and Naevia enter, bearing food and more wine. 
  Lucretia seizes on the opportunity to shift the subject.

                        the ludus since Oenomaus was 
                        injured against Theokoles.

  She catches the pain of that in Melitta's eyes, offers balm.

                        The last trial. We must all face 
                        one of the seasoned men, and 
                        demonstrate to the Dominus what we 
                        have learned. Live, and receive the 
                        Mark of the Brotherhood, proving 
                        yourself worthy of the arena.

  Crixus hardens at the thought.

                                        CRIXUS
                        I will stand upon its sands.

  The other men chuckle.

                        tall enough to suck my cock.]

  Ashur grins at Crixus.

                      He longs to call you brother, and 
                        join you as gladiator.

  Dagan laughs, spits. Crixus eyes him, knowing that isn't 
  close to what he said.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Tell him the feeling is well 
                        shared.

  OFF Crixus, a challenging smile bending his lips...


  EXT. BALCONY - BATIATUS' VILLA - NIGHT

  The moon blazes in the night sky, illuminating Batiatus and 
  Lucretia. Batiatus drinks as he paces, agitated.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Fifty denarii, for a fucking stone

                        Was it? Word surly has reached 
                        Tullius  ear, yet none of gratitude 
                        return. Fifty denarii! Solonius was 
                        right. I should temper patience, as 
                      my father would.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        You are not your father. Nor would 
                        I have it so.

  Lucretia kisses him gently, whispering support.

                        Perhaps tomorrow you will find 
                        yourself in the market. Where you 
                        have often mentioned Tullius 
                        frequents upon a certain hour, 
                        overseeing his concerns.

  Batiatus grins, gaining her meaning.

                                        BATIATUS
                        A chance encounter, to gauge his 
                        reaction?

                        For a few days, until she can 
                        manage other arrangements.

                                        BATIATUS
                                  laughs)(

                      it from the heavens.

  She starts to head back in. Batiatus stops her.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Let her keep company with her wine 
                        a moment longer...

  He kisses her, passion rising, hands exploring... Lucretia 
  sighs at his touch.

                        Has a wife ever had such a husband?

  Batiatus turns her around, lifting her dress as he whispers 
  in her ear.

                                        BATIATUS
                      He but honors her... and the gods 
                        for guiding such treasure to his 
                        arms...

  He enters her, their faces seized by pleasure and love. 
  REVEAL Gaia watching from the shadows inside the villa. Her 
  hand drops below frame to pleasure herself as she takes in 
  the show. As she bites her lip in mounting ecstasy, the 
  SCREEN IS CONSUMED IN LIGHT, transitioning us to the BLAZING 
  SUN --


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS' LUDUS - DAY

  The sun beats down, scorching Gladiators and Recruits as 
  they train under the crack of Doctore's whip. Oenomaus again 
  spars with Barca. Auctus trades blows with Gnaeus.

  CRIXUS

  spars with Ashur. Ashur pivots, smacking Crixus across the 
  face with his practice sword. Dagan chuckles.

                                          DOCTORE
                        You lower shield when you thrust. 
                        See it raised, or your fucking 
                        brains upon the sand.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Yes, Doctore.

  Ashur grins, whispers at Crixus.

                                        ASHUR
                        A lucky blow.

                                        CRIXUS
                      It was well struck. I will not 
                        repeat the mistake.

  Ashur laughs, attacks. Crixus counters, then raises his 
  shield just in time to deflect Ashur's blow.

                                        ASHUR
                        Good! Again!

  Crixus attacks. Gannicus steps out of his cell across the 
  square, squints in hang-over discomfort at the searing 
  light.

                                        GANNICUS
                        Doctore! I would work the palus. In 
                        the shade.

  Doctore frowns, motions approval. Gannicus takes a practice 
  sword and heads for a palus in the shade. Crixus eyes him 
  curiously as he passes.

                                        ASHUR
                                to Crixus)(
                        I would not let gaze linger. 
                        Gannicus is a fucking fool, yet one 
                      of deadly skill. He is often 
                        rewarded for his victories with 
                        wine and cunt. Gain Dominus' favor, 
                        and such delights could be yours.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Drink and women are not my concern.

                                        ASHUR
                        More for me, then.

  Ashur attacks. Barca chuckles as he spars with Oenomaus.

                                        BARCA
                        Fucking recruits. Smaller and 
                        smaller each year.

  Oenomaus ignores him, his attention drawn to Batiatus as he 
  appears from the villa. He heads for the main gate, Acco and 
  Attending Slaves in tow. Oenomaus sees a chance to gain 
  notice.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    30.

                        Apologies.

  WHAM! Oenomaus attacks, driving Barca back. Batiatus pauses 
  at the gate, glancing over. Barca counters. They trade bone- 
  shattering blows, but Barca is outmatched. CRACK! Oenomaus 
  sends Barca to the ground, dazed and bleeding. Auctus rushes 
  over to help him.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Oenomaus.

  Oenomaus looks over, eyes shining with expectation.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        You return to form. Pair with 
                        Crixus, and bring him to speed.

  Oenomaus barely hides his disappointment.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Dominus.

  Batiatus exits. Crixus hustles over.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Gratitude. Your instruction is much 
                        appreciated --

  CRACK! Oenomaus smashes Crixus to the ground with a single 
  blow. He glares down at him, the sting of being assigned to 
  train a raw recruit flaring in his eyes.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Lesson one: never drop your fucking 
                        guard. Rise. And prepare for lesson 
                        two...

  Crixus spits blood and painfully rises, WIPING US TO --


  EXT. CAPUA STREETS - DAY

  Batiatus anxiously weaves through the crowd with Solonius. 
  Acco and Attending Slaves follow.

                                        BATIATUS
                      Do you lay eyes?

                        No. Perhaps Tullius did not come 
                        today.

                        proper student would in pursuit of 
                        knowledge.

  Batiatus spots Tullius' bodyguard Theron standing outside of 
  a meat shop.

  Batiatus grins, heads for him. Solonius frowns, follows.

                        I seek your master, good Tullius. 
                        Would he be within?

  Theron stares down at Batiatus, says nothing. Batiatus licks 
  his lips, tries another tactic.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        I wish to express gratitude for 
                        allowing me to purchase his slave 
                        Crixus. The Gaul shows great 
                        promise towards the arena. Perhaps 
                        you could pass word of my 
                        presence...

  Batiatus presses a few coins into Theron's hand. Theron 
  stares at them. Batiatus frowns, adds a few more. Theron 
  disappears inside without a word.

                        You owe me a few of those, if you

  Batiatus hands over the borrowed coins from yesterday.

                                        SOLONIUS
                      In mocking tone.

  Tullius greets Batiatus with a warm smile.

                                          TULLIUS
                        Good Batiatus. I hoped for occasion 
                      to give gratitude for relieving me 
                      of that troublesome Gaul.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Think nothing of it. A gesture of 
                        respect, for a man deserving of it.

                                          TULLIUS
                        Received with all intentions. Yet I 
                        fear you have overpaid.

                                          VETTIUS
                        A common mistake, for those with no 
                        head towards business.

  Tullius presses a small purse of coins into Batiatus' hands.

                                          TULLIUS
                        Fifty denarii, minus the ten of the 
                        Gaul's actual worth.

  Batiatus is stunned, struggles to regain advantage.

                                        BATIATUS
                        This is -- I do not ask for its 
                        return. Fair bargain was struck.

                                          VETTIUS
                        Fair?
                                  snorts)(
                        A clumsy maneuver to gain position 
                        for your ill-trained men.

                                          TULLIUS

                        could best yours fucking

                        Listen how the rooster crows.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        Let us calm ourselves, with drink, 
                        perhaps --

  Solonius takes Batiatus  arm. Batiatus shakes it off, 
  getting in Vettius' face.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You doubt my words? Test them. If 
                        you have fucking nerve to request 
                        the match in next month's games.

                                          VETTIUS
                        Why delay? Let us see it here in 
                        the morning, the people to judge 
                        who holds the better man.

                                        SOLONIUS
                      In the market? Surely the 
                        Magistrate would not approve such 
                        disruption.

                                          VETTIUS
                        Good Tullius has his ear.

  Vettius looks to Tullius. Tullius considers it, nods.

                                          TULLIUS
                        The Magistrate could be swayed to 
                        allow it... if that is what you 
                        wish?

                                        BATIATUS
                      It is. And long past due.

                                          TULLIUS
                        Tomorrow then. A friendly rivalry, 
                        well settled.

  Tullius moves off with Vettius and Theron. Solonius frets.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        You press beyond advantage.

  OFF Batiatus' determination...


  INT. BATIATUS' VILLA - DAY

  Wine spills into a cup as Batiatus excitedly regales 
  Lucretia and Gaia with his tale of the marketplace.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You should have seen young Vettius, 
                      so easily goaded into making 
                        challenge! The fucking child!

  Batiatus drinks with a laugh.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        All men are reduced in years, when 
                        faced with superior mind.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Superior in all accounting! A fact 
                        Tullius and the rest of the city 
                        will bear witness to in the 
                        marketplace!

                                        GAIA
                        Sleep will come with difficulty 
                        tonight. It has been ages since I 
                        have seen a decent match. Or 
                        Tullius. In the blush of youth, he 
                        was forever attempting to slip 
                        beneath my robes.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You should have let him. Tullius 
                        has grown to a man of worth.
                                (pouring her more 
                                  wine)
                        One to be emulated and admired.

                        tomorrow. A color he once favored.

                        opportunity. The question begs 
                        careful consideration...

  Batiatus drinks, turning the possibilities in his mind...


  INT. OFFICE - BATIATUS' VILLA - NIGHT

  Oenomaus is escorted in. He can barely contain his 
  excitement as Batiatus counts coin at his desk, not looking 
  up. He finishes, rises.

                                        BATIATUS
                        I have news to lift the heart. 
                        Vettius has made challenge.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        The coward finds his cock.

                                        BATIATUS
                                  laughs)(
                        And I would see it shriveled. My 
                        best man is to meet his dog in the 
                        marketplace come morning.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        The market?

                                        BATIATUS
                        A detail of no consequence. My 
                        question to you is plain. Is our 
                        man prepared for such a vital 
                        match?

                                        OENOMAUS
                                (swelling with 
                                  pride)
                        Yes, Dominus. I long to honor this 
                        house once again.

  Batiatus stares, laughs uncomfortably.

                                        BATIATUS
                        No, I fear you have mistaken 
                        intentions.  I speak of Gannicus.

  Oenomaus barely contains his disappointment -- and 
    embarrassment.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    36.

                      be better put to Doctore.

                                        BATIATUS
                        His counsel is always valued, yet 
                      he is my father's man. His 
                        judgement clouded through the haze 
                      of outdated tradition. I seek a 
                        more visceral assessment. You and I 
                        practically grew up together in 
                        this ludus. You have seen the rise 
                        and fall of a dozen champions. What 
                        now does your gut tell you of 
                        Gannicus? Is he worthy of assuming 
                        the mantle?

  Oenomaus struggles with the question.

                                        OENOMAUS
                                  soft)(

                      He must truly be, for you to offer 
                        support despite your own desires.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        I would not give false tongue to 
                        gain advantage.

                                        BATIATUS
                        There are few that would stand with 
                        you so.

  He clasps Oenomaus warmly on the arm.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Your wife's weekly visit. Two days 
                        hence?

  Oenomaus nods.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        I would see her to your bed tonight 
                      as well. In gratitude for honest 
                        thoughts.

  He motions to the Guard. Oenomaus is led out, WIPING US TO

  INT. OENOMAUS' CELL - BATIATUS' LUDUS - NIGHT

  Melitta, naked, lights a candle at a makeshift altar (the 
  same seen in episode 106, season 1). She mouths a silent 
  prayer before sliding into bed with Oenomaus. He takes her 
  in his arms with a troubled frown.

                                        OENOMAUS
                      Do the gods ever answer your 
                        prayers?

                        They often reveal their leanings, 
                        though not in words. Much like my 
                        husband.

  He forces a sad smile. Melitta knows him too well.

                                        OENOMAUS
                                  reluctantly)(

                      He has chosen him as champion, to 
                        face Vettius' man in the 
                        marketplace tomorrow.

                                          MELITTA
                        And this is why you sulk? The 
                        streets are no place for the mighty 
                        Oenomaus to make his return. The 
                        arena will be home to your 
                        triumphs, when the time comes. And 
                        I will be there to witness it...

  Her lips devour him, hungrily, passionately. Oenomaus 
  responds in kind, her words and her touch dispelling doubt 
  --for the moment...


  EXT. MESS HALL/TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS' LUDUS - NIGHT

  A Guard escorts Melitta and Oenomaus to the pantry gate, 
  unlocks it. She embraces her husband.

                                          MELITTA
                        I will dream of your touch.

  He kisses her, their lips lingering, neither wanting to 
  part. She finally disengages, touching his face with a smile 
  before following the Guard up into the villa. A great 
  sadness creeps into Oenomaus' eyes. He turns to go, freezes 
  in concern as he spots

  GANNICUS

   tightrope walking  along the cliff s edge, wine jug in 
  hand, singing a little song to himself.

                                        GANNICUS
                                (singing softly, 
                                  muttered)
                        The blood rains down, from an angry 
                        sky, my cock rages on, my cock 
                        rages on...

  Oenomaus draws close, hissing to him.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Gannicus!

                                        GANNICUS
                      My brother! Join me!

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Lower voice! If the Guards were to 
                        see you --

                                        GANNICUS
                        They have already passed. And were 
                        well plied with wine to keep nose 
                        from fucking business.

  He takes a swig from his jug.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Tomorrow you fight for the honor of 
                        this ludus. Now is not the time for 
                        drink.

                                        GANNICUS
                        Every night is time for drink. For 
                        the morning sun may greet you with 
                        your last fucking day.

  A cloud threatens to darken the perpetual twinkle in his eye 
  as he takes another swig. A loose stone gives way under his 
  foot. He tumbles to the sand with a thud, almost going over 

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    39.

  the cliff. A frozen moment -- broken by Gannicus bursting 
  into drunken laughter. Oenomaus glowers, helping him up.

                        Words of fucking wisdom, well 
                        received.

  Gannicus laughs, heads for his cell. Oenomaus half chuckles, 
  half glowers as he turns for the barracks.

                                          GANNICUS(cont'd)
                        Oenomaus?

  Oenomaus pauses. Gannicus hesitates, his eyes belying a rare 
  moment of seriousness.

                                          GANNICUS(cont'd)
                      It should be you tomorrow.

  Oenomaus registers that, nods in thanks. Gannicus laughs, 
  returning to his old self as he sings himself to his cell.

                                          GANNICUS(cont'd)

                        Till death is found, my sword 
                        swinging hot, my cock rages on, my 
                        cock rages on...

  Oenomaus takes a deep drink from the wine jug, turns to head 
  back to his own cell for the night, WIPING US TO --


  EXT. CAPUA MARKETPLACE - DAY

  A crush of CITIZENS crowd the marketplace. The air is 
  electric as they push and laugh, eyes shining with 
  excitement. Acco parts the crowd, clearing a path as

  BATIATUS

  makes his grand entrance with Doctore and Gannicus. Gannicus 
  wears a cloak, the hood up. Lucretia, Gaia (in the classic 
  Lucretia red wig), Solonius, Melitta, and other Attending 
  Slaves follow. Batiatus mock-searches the crowd with a grin.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    40.
  CONTINUED:

                                        BATIATUS
                        Where is good Vettius? Is he among 
                        you? Or did he come to sense, and 
                        remain within warm safety of his 
                        bed?

  The crowd LAUGHS. Batiatus spots Vettius at the other end of 
  the marketplace, standing with Tullius and Magistrate 
  Sextus. Vettius' gladiator Otho looms close by, as does 
  Tullius' bodyguard Theron.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Ah! There he stands! Fresh and 
                        young as a newborn calf!

  More chuckles from the crowd. Batiatus presses the flesh as 
  he makes his way towards Vettius. Vettius glares.

                                          VETTIUS
                                to Tullius)(

                                  warmly)(
                        Batiatus. We had begun to fret on 
                        your arrival. Although I see you 
                        arrive with unexpected gift...

  He smiles appreciatively at Gaia, recognizing her.

                                          TULLIUS(cont'd)
                      It has been too long, Gaia.

                                          VETTIUS
                                (irritated, re: 
                                  Batiatus)
                        And grows longer still.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Apologies for my delay. I found 
                        much difficulty in the choosing of 
                        a man.
                                (playing to the 
                                  crowd)
                      An imposing task, when each among 
                      my stable stands a titan!

  The crowd TITTERS approval. Batiatus eyes Otho with a frown.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Perhaps good Vettius should have 
                        taken more time in the choosing of 
                        his own.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    41.
  CONTINUED:

  The crowd LAUGHS. Vettius flares.

                                          VETTIUS
                        Words fall from your mouth, as shit 
                        from ass.

  Tullius intervenes with practiced smile, playing peacemaker.

                                          TULLIUS
                        Let us not become mired in base

                        between respected rivals. Clear 
                        space!

  The crowd complies, creating a ring for the gladiators to 
  fight. Gaia smiles appreciatively at Tullius as she moves.

                                        GAIA
                                to Lucretia)(

                        And his purse.

  Lucretia gives Gaia a loaded smile, knowing exactly what 
  she's thinking. Gaia laughs, not denying it.

                                          DOCTORE
                                  soft, to Batiatus)(
                        A brawl in the streets. Where is 
                        the honor in such a thing?

                                        BATIATUS

                        The event turns larger than 
                        expected. Your mad schemes may yet 
                        bear fruit.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Enough for both of us to feast 
                        upon.

  Tullius raises his hands. The din of the crowd dies down.

                                          TULLIUS
                        Gratitude to Magistrate Sextus for

  Cheers. The Magistrate acknowledges them with a nod.

                                          TULLIUS(cont'd)
                        Batiatus. Present your man.

                                        BATIATUS
                                to the crowd)(
                      In honor of the Magistrate, 
                        esteemed Tullius, and the people of 
                        Capua... I give you the most 
                        fearsome Gaul ever to take up arms 
                      in the arena! Conqueror of giants! 
                        Slayer of beasts! Behold Gannicus! 
                        Champion of the House of Batiatus!

  Melitta tightens at the title as Gannicus throws off his 
  cloak and steps forward. He is truly a golden god, bound 
  only in a subligaria. A rousing cheer ripples through the 
  crowd. Batiatus beams. Gannicus takes twin swords from 
  Doctore, eyes Otho with a searing grin.

                                          TULLIUS
                        A fine choice. Vettius. Present 
                        your man.

                                          VETTIUS
                        I have no tongue for overripe 
                          embellishment. Nor is it required. 
                        Otho! Stand forth!

  Otho, also in a subligaria, takes his position. The crowd 
  explodes in a deafening ROAR. Lucretia frowns to Batiatus.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        They favor Vettius  offering.

                        Only until he falls.

  The worry lurking in Batiatus' eyes contradicts the 
  assurance of his words. Otho takes a sword and a shield from 
  VETTIUS' DOCTORE, grins at Gannicus.

                                        OTHO

                        Now, let us judge who stands the 
                        better house!

  Tullius nods to the Magistrate. Otho and Gannicus tense as 
  Magistrate Sextus raises his fist and --

                                          VETTIUS
                        Apologies, Magistrate. There 
                        appears to be something missing.

                        Where is your man's blindfold?

  Batiatus sputters in shock. The crowd WHISPERS. Vettius 
  grins, his trap sprung.

                                        BATIATUS

                        That was your boast, was it not? 
                        That your gladiator could best any 
                      of my men absent sight...?

  Vettius holds out a ragged piece of cloth, offering it as 
  the blindfold. Batiatus turns to Tullius for help. Tullius 
  reluctantly can give none..

                                          TULLIUS
                        You did voice such challenge.

  Lucretia stiffens. Gannicus tenses. The crowd MURMURS 
  excitedly. Batiatus attempts to dismiss the matter.

                                        BATIATUS
                        A simple figure of speech, not 
                        meant to -- Good Tullius --

                                          VETTIUS
                      If Batiatus does not wish to honor 
                        terms, he should remove himself. 
                        With tail between legs.

  The crowd CHUCKLES. Batiatus looks to Gannicus, trapped. A 
  tense beat. Gannicus turns from Otho, holding his swords out 
  for Doctore to take.

  Otho grins. The crowd chuckles. Batiatus deflates. Doctore 
  takes the swords -- but Gannicus doesn't retreat. Instead 
  hecrosses to Vettius and takes the blindfold. The crowd 
  titters. Gannicus ties the blindfold around his head, just 
  above his eyes.

                                          DOCTORE

  Gannicus retrieves his swords.

                                (loudly, for the 
                                  crowd)
                        The task should not be that 
                        difficult. I need only direct my 
                        blades towards the smell of shit.

  The crowd ROARS as Gannicus pulls the blindfold down over 
  his eyes. Doctore glowers.

                                          DOCTORE

                        The choice is removed from my 
                        hands.

  Gannicus raises his swords, readying himself. The Magistrate 
  raises his fist and brings it down.

                        Begin!

  Otho GRUNTS and attacks with sword and shield [Note: Otho 
  grunts loudly before each attack]. Gannicus narrowly 
  counters. Melitta's heart leaps into her throat.

                                        GAIA
                        How thrilling. I have never seen

                        For good reason.

  He shoots Batiatus a worried look. Batiatus ignores it, 
  focusing a glare at Vettius. Vettius grins.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    45.

  THE CROWD REACTS

  as Otho draws blood. Melitta tenses. Gannicus shakes it off. 
  Otho grunts, attacks. Gannicus counters and miraculously 
  lands a blow of his own, drawing blood. The crowd ROARS. 
  Batiatus brightens.

  OTHO GRUNTS,

  attacking. Gannicus counters, but Otho clocks Gannicus in 
  the face with his shield. Blood flies. Otho redoubles his 
  attack, pummeling and hacking at Gannicus. Gannicus 
  staggers, bleeding and bruised. Otho circles Gannicus, 
  playing for the crowd. Batiatus sags.

                                          SOLONIUS(cont'd)

                      To be remembered only in its 
                        failing.

  Gannicus desperately tries to keep a fix on where Otho is, 
  but the sounds of the crowd are disorienting. Otho gets 
  behind him. He grunts, going in for the kill. Gannicus spins 
  at the last second, narrowly avoiding Otho's sword. TIME 
  SLOWS as the blade just barely SLICES THROUGH GANNICUS' 
  BLINDFOLD, restoring his vision.

  GANNICUS SURGES,

  attacking with a series of lightning fast blows, ending by 
  SLAMMING HIS SWORD through the big man's face and out the 
  back of his head. The crowd goes silent. Batiatus gawks, not 
  believing his eyes.

  OTHO

  takes a few shaky steps with the sword lodged in his skull, 
  then collapses, dead before he hits the ground. The crowd 
  EXPLODES.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Yes! Have you ever seen such a 
                        fucking thing?!

  Gannicus, more dead than alive, grins at Melitta. Melitta 
  returns it, greatly relieved for her friend.

                        man less prone to death against the 
                        mighty Gannicus!

  Vettius glowers, his hatred for Batiatus multiplied.

                        position in the games.

                        man at length.

  He smiles warmly at Gaia as he exits, Vettius in tow. 
  Batiatus basks in his triumph, signaling his approval to 
  Gannicus. The crowd mobs him, anxious to soak rags and the 
  tip of robes in his blood. They press in, WIPING US TO --


  INT. BATHS - BATIATUS' LUDUS - NIGHT

  Naked Gladiators cheer and laugh, welcoming a victorious 
  Gannicus back into the fold (his wounds tended to by 
  Medicus). Crixus, Ashur, Dagan, and Indus, battered from the 
  day's training, look on from the sideline.

                                        AUCTUS
                        Only mad Gannicus could win contest 
                        fucking blindfolded!

  The Gladiators ROAR. Barca laughs in mock scorn.

                        Barca could do the same!

                        fool.

  Auctus laughs, roughly grabbing Barca and kissing him hard 
  in warning. Oenomaus appears. The din dies down. Oenomaus 
  still commands much respect among the men.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Auctus speaks truth. Facing 
                        Vettius' man absent sight was 
                        beyond foolish. The gods must have 
                        taken pity on your addled brain, to 
                        see you yet among us.

                        Otho grunts like a stuck pig before 
                        each attack. His squeals gave way 
                        position!

  The men roar in approval. Oenomaus joins them, clasping 
  forearms with his friend. Oenomaus' approval obviously means 
  a lot to him.

  exits with the Gladiators in tow.

  INT. BEDCHAMBER - BATIATUS' VILLA - NIGHT

  Batiatus roars with excitement as Naevia and Diona dress him 
  in his finest robes. Gaia and Lucretia sip wine, enraptured.

                        Gannicus' victory forges path to 
                        greater glory. With Tullius' 
                        support, we will finally gain 
                        proper position in the games!

    temptation...


  INT. NESTOR'S MEAT SHOP - BACK ROOM - NIGHT

  Animal carcasses hang from meat hooks. Cleavers and carving 
  tools litter the room. Tullius and Batiatus sit at a small 
  table. Batiatus' bodyguard Acco stands a ways back, as does

                        again. With exception of poor 
                        Vettius. He is fit for seizure from 
                        the ordeal.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Unfortunate. That he could not 
                        produce more worthy opponent. Yet 
                        his stock is well known to be of 
                        inferior quality, as the boy 
                        himself. The manner in which he 
                        tends his ludus. The child has no 
                        fucking talent for it.

  Tullius eyes Batiatus, a faint smile bending his lips.

                                          TULLIUS
                        You surprise me, Batiatus. Your 
                        disposition towards business is 
                        much more... aggressive. Than your 
                        father's.

                                        BATIATUS
                      We are of diverging temperament. 
                        And desires.

                                          TULLIUS
                        How does he fare in Sicilia?

                                        BATIATUS
                        The clime is more agreeable with 
                        various conditions brought about by 
                        the passing of years.
                                  back to business)(
                        How did the Magistrate find 
                        Gannicus' display?

                                          TULLIUS
                        Ignited by it, as was the crowd.

  Tullius refills Batiatus cup.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    51.

                                          TULLIUS(cont'd)
                      He even broached subject of 
                        retaining the man. For the opening 
                        games of the new arena.

  Batiatus lights up.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Gannicus in the opening games? If 
                        you could aid in such a thing, I 
                        would forever be in your debt.

                                          TULLIUS
                      It merely requires a word in the 
                        proper ear. All that remains is to 
                        agree upon a price.

  Batiatus' mirth falters. Ah, here it comes. The shakedown. 
  He forces a smile.

                                        BATIATUS
                      Of course. I would be happy to see 
                        coin to your hands in exchange for 
                        your assistance. What sum did you 
                        have in mind?

  Tullius stares in surprise, then laughs.

                                          TULLIUS
                        You misunderstand, Batiatus. I do 
                        not offer to broker arrangement. I 
                        offer to purchase your man.

  The bottom drops out of Batiatus' world.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Purchase? But --
                                  laughs)(
                        Why would you want a gladiator? You 
                        are not a lanista.

                                          TULLIUS
                                  laughs)(
                        Jupiter's cock, no. Yet I do have 
                        many vested interests. In shipping. 
                        Goods and services. This very shop.
                                  pointedly)(
                        And young Vettius' ludus.

  Vettius appears behind Tullius, a nasty smile cracking his 
  face. With him are several large, brutish GLADIATORS. Acco's 
  eyes flick nervously to the Gladiators. Batiatus tenses.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    52.

                                          VETTIUS
                                  laughs)(
                        Look at the little fuck now. About 
                      to shit himself.

                                          TULLIUS
                        Still your tongue. The grownups are 
                        talking.

  He levels his gaze at Batiatus, all pretenses of warmth and 
  friendship vanishing. He sets a heavy purse of coins on the 
  table between them.

                                          TULLIUS(cont'd)
                        Two hundred denarii. A generous 
                        offer.  In respect of your father.

  Batiatus hardens. Wrong thing to say.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Apologies. I would not part with 
                        the man.

  Tullius considers that, has a sip of wine.

                                          TULLIUS
                        I allowed you to purchase one of my 
                        slaves. Yet now you deny me the 
                        same opportunity?

  Batiatus' eyes flick to Vettius and his men. He licks his 
  lips, musters the courage to stand his ground.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Gannicus is not for sale.

                                          TULLIUS
                        Everything is for sale, Batiatus. 
                        The question is but price.

  He smiles warmly, his eyes flicking to his man Theron. 
  Theron erupts, sinking a meat cleaver into Acco's skull. 
  Batiatus overturns the table, using the distraction to 
  scramble out of the room. Vettius and his men rush after 
  him.


  EXT. CAPUA STREETS - NIGHT

  Batiatus crashes out of Nestor's shop. He takes off through 
  the mostly deserted street, fleeing for his life. Theron, 
  Vettius, and his brutes chase after him. Music swells, 
    TRANSITIONING US TO --                                                                                    53.


  INT. BEDCHAMBERS - BATIATUS' VILLA - NIGHT

  TIGHT ON the little clay bottle, the remainder of its 
  powdered contents spilling out onto a side table. ADJUST TO 
  FIND Lucretia sprawled on her bed, eyes glazed in opium 
  bliss. Gaia appears next to her, gently stroking her hair. 
  She kisses Lucretia. Lucretia half smiles, too out of it to 
  even care. Gaia's hands crawl over Lucretia's body, slowly 
  undressing her.

                                                                    INTERCUT WITH:


  EXT. SIDE STREET - NIGHT

  Batiatus gets cut off by Theron. He turns to run the other 
  way, but Vettius and his men are there. Batiatus tries to 
  fight, but he's quickly overpowered. Vettius and his men 
  beat the living shit out of him.

                                                                    INTERCUT WITH:


  INT. BEDCHAMBERS - BATIATUS' VILLA - NIGHT

  A naked Gaia kisses her way down an equally exposed 
  Lucretia. Lucretia writhes in absent pleasure, her eyes hazy 
  and unfocused. Gaia disappears OUT OF FRAME as she goes down 
  on her. Lucretia gasps in ecstasy.

                                                                  MATCH CUT WITH:


  EXT. CAPUA STREETS - NIGHT

  Batiatus gasps on the ground, his face bloodied and raw. He 
  spits blood, barely conscious. Tullius appears, looming over 
  him.

                                          TULLIUS
                        I make fair offer. And you produce 
                        cock to piss on me. Do you know 
                        what that feels like, Batiatus?

  Tullius reaches down OUT OF FRAME and parts his robes. 
  Batiatus sputters as Tullius pisses on him. A show of power. 
  He finishes, closes his robes.

                                          TULLIUS(cont'd)
                        Reconsider your answer. Or be 
                        excluded from the games forever.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    54.
  CONTINUED:

  Tullius exits. Vettius spits on Batiatus, laughing as he 
  follows with the men. Batiatus' eyes flutter shut as he 
  loses consciousness. ANGLE UP to reveal the PARTIALLY 
  COMPLETED ARENA looming in the distance.


  FADE OUT.
