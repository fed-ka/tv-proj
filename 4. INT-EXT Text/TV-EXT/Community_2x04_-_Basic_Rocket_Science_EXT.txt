HEROIC MUSIC plays as JEFF, ANNIE, SHIRLEY, BRITTA, TROY, 
ABED and PIERCE all walk towards camera in slow motion, 
wearing painter coveralls and carrying buckets and brushes.  
re just moving  not actually shot in slo-mo, they They re
slowly, and everyone but Abed looks irritated at having to do 
it.

JEFF
Can we stop walking in slo-mo now?

ABED
Twenty more yards.

PIERCE
You guys are walking in slo-mo? 

FADE OUT.

ACT ONE


The space bus is parked.  Dean Pelton addresses the gang. 

DEAN PELTON
(checking his watch)
You guys are an hour late. 

ANNIE
(frustrated)
Abed kept making us redo our walk. 

DEAN PELTON
I think you know the reason this *
group has been chosen for this job.  *
To atone for the obscene entry you 
submitted to the Greendale school 
flag contest.

He holds up a color printout of a simple flag design, a blue 
field behind a pink circle with arrows pointing outward.

DEAN PELTON (CONT D)
t a * right, I know this isn That s
symbol for the crossroads of ideas, 
 a butt.I now know it s*

The group (minus Annie) stifles snickers.

DEAN PELTON (CONT D)
Keep snickering.  Pack yourselves 
with peanuts and really be 
satisfied, because guess what?  
This won.  This is now our school *
flag forever.  Proud of yourselves?*

The group is not displeased to hear that.

TROY
 our design?  How do you know it s
We submitted it anonymously.
(realizing)
Oops.

DEAN PELTON
Wrong.  One of you actually came 
forward.

Everyone looks at Annie.

ANNIE 
(defensive)
What?

DEAN PELTON
Now, somewhere beneath this dirt is *
 newest pride.  My hope Greendale s
 is that while you scrub it, you ll
find the school pride in your *
hearts.*

ABED*
When we finish cleaning it, do we 
get to go inside? 

DEAN PELTON
 a job for a group of No.  That s*
upstanding students, who are *
training right now in the Simulator 
Simulator.*


As before. 

DEAN PELTON
I will be back to check on your 
progress.  I expect this craft to 
be spic and span...
(catching himself)
Owe myself a quarter.
(correcting)
Squeaky clean in time for the 
pretend launch in front of the 
  press at three o clock.

Dean exits.  The seven begrudgingly grab supplies and move *
toward the bus.*

BRITTA
(re: bus, to Jeff)
I remember this old thing.

seconds after the Dean left.

Annie walks off towards the bus in search of the boys.*


The front end of the bus has been hitched and raised by a 
large tow truck, which now pulls it out of the lot.  We watch 
it go, then pan back to look at a row of handicapped parking 
spaces, across which the bus had been parked.

After a moment, Abed approaches, dressed in a flight suit.  
He stops where the bus was.  He looks around.  Finally, and 
slowly... He looks up.

FADE OUT.

ACT TWO


 down the road.  Pull flying  tight on the space bus  We re
out to reveal the tow truck, cruising along.


The space bus has been unhitched and is parked by itself in 
the middle of a rural field, surrounded by cows.

JEFF (O.S.)
Coldwater.


A triumphant shot of the space bus speeding down the road.


The Greendale quad is decorated for a ribbon-cutting 
ceremony, with a podium in front of a ribbon.  A large crowd 
has gathered.  Reporters are looking at their watches.


The space bus makes a hard turn.


Dean Pelton walks slowly across the quad, stalling for time.  
Dean Spreck follows him, taunting.

DEAN SPRECK 
 never make it back, Craig.    They ll
That thing might as well be on a 
simulation of the moon.

The Space Bus barrels onto the quad.*

It knocks over a couple easels and tables stacked with *
flyers.  It almost hits a guy who dives out of the way at the *
last second. (other physical bits?) Also, maybe Dean sees it *
coming and takes the podium here?*

The bus screeches to a tire-smoking stop behind the ribbon.  *

CHILDREN from around the neighborhood come running after it, 
cheering.

PHOTOGRAPHERS snap pictures and roll video as Annie climbs *
down from the cab, walks over to the main cabin door and 
opens it.

Pierce runs out first, straight through the crowd, screaming, 
and into the distance, never looking back.

One by one, the rest of the study group exits the Winnebago, 
waving to photographers and high-fiving the crowd. 

The Dean runs up to the podium.

DEAN PELTON
Ladies and gentlemen, returning 
from their maiden simulation, the 
fabulous Greendale Green-stronauts!

Annie is receiving congratulations from strangers when Dean 
Spreck approaches her.

DEAN SPRECK
 not Well, Annie.  I guess you re
City College material after all.

ANNIE
Thank you.

ANGLE ON Troy wading through the admiring crowd when he sees 
Jeff.  They shake hands and pull into an embrace.

JEFF
Hey.  Great job up there, captain.

TROY
Really?  You think I could be an 
astronaut some day?

JEFF
If NASA ever needs someone to keep 
an arrow inside a moving rectangle,

Troy smiles, genuinely touched.  Abed approaches.

JEFF (CONT D)
Abed.  Want to take a seat in the 
ve  chair?  I think you captain s
earned it.

Abed gives the space bus a long hard look. 

ABED

 already done today.I ve

Troy, Jeff, and Abed look at the ship a while.  *

It bursts into flames.  The crowd screams and scatters.*

ABED (CONT D)
Ok, that was cooler.

We pan up to the new Greendale butt flag, flying proudly over 
the smouldering bus and the rest of the Greendale campus.

FADE OUT.

TAG


Abed sits in the cockpit of a cardboard space ship, flying 
through space.  It s NOT a cheesy green-screen effect, it s a *
 in their professional green-screen effect because we re*

are cardboard and home-made.*

They high-five, then peel off, firing ping-pong ball cannons 
mounted on their space ships.

their cardboard space ships in study room.  Chang sits in a *
much crappier cardboard space ship, getting pelted by ping *
