Miranda's Volvo pulls in as students amble up the steps.
Doug kisses his wife and hops out. Exemplary carpoolers.
Students are already chatting him up as Miranda drives
off.
Miranda's car at some sort of guard gate. A BUZZER lets
her in. As the car drives past we read the plate on the
wall:
(CONTINUED)
2.
CONTINUED:
"WOODWARD FORENSIC INSTITUTE"
The gate shuts behind her with a certain finality as
we...
Miranda drives off, leaving the majestic grounds behind.
A GUARD waves her off.
END OPENING CREDITS.
Miranda slows down at the sight of colored lights up
ahead. A knocked-down telephone post blocks the road.
EMERGENCY VEHICLES at the scene. A patrolman waves her
down.
Miranda drives down the curvy road toward an old bridge.
Something definitely creepy about this deserted place --
Miranda cautiously approaches the girl, who is now not
moving. Just standing there. Her back to us.
MIRANDA
Hello?
Are you hurt?
Hello?
Nothing.
As we get closer we see she is covered in
bruises.
Clearly something horrible has happened to her.
MIRANDA
Were you in an accident? Were you
attacked? It's okay, I'm a doctor.
(beat)
My name is Miranda Grey...
And now she turns. Young, seventeen tops. Busted lip,
black eye. Miranda pulls off her coat, wraps it around
the girl --
MIRANDA
You're in shock right now, that's
perfectly natural. I'm going to
get you to the hospital. Okay?
The girl suddenly grips Miranda's arm.
Hard.
MIRANDA
Don't be scared. It's going to be
fine.
Now the girl is touching Miranda's face. Her movements
desperate, smothering. Like the movements of a drowning
person. Miranda tries to push the girl's hands back down.
MIRANDA
Hands off me, okay? Tell me your
name, do you remember your name?
The girl tries to speak but no words come out. Instead
she produces a strained, wettish sound. Creepy as hell.
And now she is prying Miranda's mouth open and she's much
stronger than expected and Miranda is panicking --
(CONTINUED)
9.
CONTINUED:
MIRANDA
What are you doing? I'm trying to
help you --?!
The girl opens her own mouth wide like a snake. And as
Miranda muffles a scream, blood starts leaking out of the
girl's eye sockets and from wounds all over her body.
SLAM CUT TO:
CAMERA SOARS through the tall iron gates, past the guard.
Now we spot the source of our continuing THWIP THWIP
sound: sprinklers watering the impressively-kept gardens.
The expansive complex is more Victorian campus than drab
prison, with separate wings (male and female), research
units, libraries, gym and volunteer outpatient center.
10.
Miranda's CAR SCREECHES to a stop and she jumps out,
glances around.
Miranda and a man exit the theater.
Giggling.
FLASH CUT TO:
20.
PUSH INTO a quiet house on a quiet suburban street. Two
Volvos parked in the driveway. Perfectly-kept front lawn.
CUT TO:
Miranda and Doug laugh at their wedding. It's clearly
hot, because she wipes sweat off his brow with a
handkerchief.
SPRINKLER SYSTEMS doing their thing: THWIP, THWIP,
THWIP... The female patients are out in the gardens for
their freshly dose of air. BOOM DOWN TO Miranda alone at
a bench. A cigarette appears before her, being offered
to her:
JENNA
You a Marlboro girl?
Miranda sees Jenna looming above her, shielding the sun.
MIRANDA
I don't smoke, thanks.
(CONTINUED)
34.
CONTINUED:
JENNA
All we have is our health,
cupcake.
(sits beside her)
What I do is quit constantly,
start again. Drives them all
crazy. One day I quit three
times.
MIRANDA
Huh.
Jenna lights her smoke, blows out the match slowly.
Miranda turns and checks the building entrance as Jenna
rambles on.
JENNA
They allow me one match at a time
and pretend they're not watching.
Check it out: salivating goon
number one at three o'clock, oh-
so-inconspicuous goon number two
at five o'clock.
Miranda follows Jenna's gaze. Sure enough, she's being
closely watched by two orderlies.
MIRANDA
What did you set on fire to wind
up here?
JENNA
Very perceptive, Doc. I burnt
down the building where I worked.
I found a baby at the doorstep,
called the cops -- of course the
bottom feeding pricks never
showed. It's beside the point,
really.
Miranda shrugs. God knows what Jenna is talking about
but who is she to say? Once again, Miranda checks the
building entrance and now sees Parsons emerge. She
rises --
MIRANDA
Phil.
He keeps walking.
Headed to the parking lot beyond.
MIRANDA
Phil!
(CONTINUED)
35.
CONTINUED:
He turns. His first instinct is to smile. But he checks
himself, reminding himself of her new status. Slips into
his best professional face:
PARSONS
Hello, Miranda.
MIRANDA
I wonder if I could talk to you.
PARSONS
Of course.
(checks his watch)
Well, actually, I'm about to...
MIRANDA
Your staff meeting's done and
Thursdays you don't schedule
sessions until the afternoon.
This will just take one minute.
Promise.
Impressive.
She remembers his schedule perfectly.
PARSONS
True.
(points)
But the Sheriff wants to ask me
some questions.
She follows his look to the parking lot where Sheriff
Ryan emerges from his patrol car. Miranda nods.
MIRANDA
It's about Pete.
PARSONS
What about him?
MIRANDA
Perhaps he's not the most
qualified person to be treating
me.
His tone is fatherly yet direct.
PARSONS
Are you complaining about his
methods or are you referring to
the nature of your past
relationship with him?
This surprises her.
(CONTINUED)
36.
CONTINUED:
MIRANDA
What did he tell you?
PARSONS
He explained there might be a
conflict of interest because he
has feelings for you. You two
engaged in a kiss at one point.
Am I right?
MIRANDA
Yes.
PARSONS
I told him we're all grownups here
and the fact is he's the best doctor
on my staff. As such, and given the
severity of the charges you face, I
consider him the most qualified person
to assist your recovery. Now, if
you'll excuse me, Sheriff Ryan is
not a patient man.
Stonewalled in the simplest of ways, she's left feeling
like an idiot. Watches Parsons join the Sheriff by his
car. The two men shake hands when suddenly Irene runs
past her, yelling --
IRENE
Hey!
Chloe!
Now two ORDERLIES race past. Miranda looks over to see
what the fuss is all about. Chloe is on top of an
institute staff member we haven't seen before, a round
black woman named CONSUELO. Punching her --
Other patients have crowded around the scuffle.
CHLOE
You fucking cow giving me the evil
eye, huh? Fuck you, you fuckin'
voodoo witch -- !
Irene and the orderlies yank Chloe off Consuelo. Chloe kicks
and screams like an animal. Consuelo meekly stands up.
CONSUELO
(heavy Cuban accent)
Is okay, she's okay -- she don't
mean nothing.
CHLOE
You bet your goddamn fat ass I
mean it, you're a witch -- !!
(CONTINUED)
37.
CONTINUED:
IRENE
McGrath, that's enough!
The orderlies start pulling Chloe away.
Chloe spits at
Consuelo, full of venom.
CHLOE
Take your voodoo shit back to
Cuba --
IRENE
I said that's enough.
CONSUELO
Irene, she's okay. Pobrecita, la
infeliz. It's a misunderstanding.
Pobrecita. I was only trying to
help her --
CHLOE
You wanna help me? You pity me?
(grabbing her
crotch)
Suck me.
The orderlies haul Chloe off. Irene disperses the crowd.
Consuelo sighs, embarrassed, wipes a bloody lip. Her
manner says she just wants to get back to her duties.
Excitement over, the patients resume whatever it is they
were doing.
Miranda stares at her bleak surroundings when something
catches her eye: Pete watching her from his office
window. He quickly slides the curtain shut. Odd.
PHOTOGRAPHY SHOTS)
A sunny sky grows dark as night envelops us with a SWOOSH --
Dead quiet. CRICKETS CHIRP or whatever it is
crickets
do. Miranda steadies her breathing, perusing
rows of
unfamiliar cars. She clicks Simon's key-ring
button
repeatedly until a set of headlights blink on
and off.
The gate GUARD reads a magazine as Miranda's stolen car
approaches. The guard barely registers the driver in the
booth mirror, immersed in his article. Hits a button to
open the gate for him. It opens SLOWLY. S-l-o-w-l-y.
67.
The neighborhood perfectly quiet late at night. Miranda
parks in the driveway and stares at the empty house.
Steels herself, climbs out of the car and heads around
back.
She finds her SPARE KEY behind a potted plant, takes a
deep breath and lets herself in through the back door.
Miranda jumps out, panicked. Glances around. Looks
inside the car: no Rachel. A beat to catch her breath,
making up her mind. Slides behind the wheel and makes a
U-turn.
Miranda opens her car door and walks down the empty
street to retrieve her suddenly magical keys.
We watch her reach the keys, all alone out here. The
moment she bends down to pick it up she is blinded by the
glare of HEADLIGHT and the ROAR OF AN ENGINE. Miranda
jumps out of the way, narrowly avoiding being flattened
by a ROAD SWEEPER, spraying water as it goes.
She watches the truck disappear down the block. Heart in
her throat. Calms her nerves and now walks over to the
pesky keys again. Smack in the middle of a puddle now.
BOOM UP the posts harnessing power lines which surround
the area until we STOP ON a pair of INDUSTRIAL BOLTS
fastened around the insulators of a thick power line.
From here we see Miranda bend down and pick up her keys.
And now the bolts suddenly shake off their hinges, coming
loose right in front of our eyes -- moved by some
invisible force --
Miranda tilts her head at the sound of a METALLIC SNAP
and turns. The bolts pop out of their sockets. The LIVE
WIRE uncoils like some gigantic serpent and swings
straight towards the paralyzed Miranda --
She looks down at her feet, ankle-deep in the puddle,
back up at the 11,000 VOLTS OF POWER about to fry her to
a crisp and jumps out of the way at the last second. The
wire hits the water and the monumental charge sends
SPARKS flying in every direction. It looks like
lightning.
A silent, sudden beat.
That was as close as close gets.
MIRANDA
(fighting tears)
What do you want from me?
No sign of Rachel. Miranda yells at the air, glancing
over her shoulder, seemingly demented:
MIRANDA
What is it you want me to do?!!
A moment. Miranda stranded. The stolen car in the
middle of the road. And now the SQUEAK of a GATE OPENING
abruptly. Miranda whips her head in the direction of the
sound.
It's the front gate to her house. And now the front door
SWINGS OPEN. And now the living room LIGHTS switch on.
(CONTINUED)
70.
CONTINUED:
Clearly Rachel wants her back in the house.
MIRANDA
I can't.
(softly)
Please, please don't make me go
back in there.
But even as she's saying this her feet are moving towards
it. She pauses, looks at the car in the middle of the
road. Looks at the fizzling puddle where she was almost
electrocuted. No neighbors have come out to investigate
yet, but how long can that last? She walks to the car.
A "FOR SALE" sign still flapping in the wind.
The first
few rays of light break through the dawn sky.
Miranda's (Simon's) car approaches up the road until it
FILLS the FRAME and parks. Miranda steps out.
She studies the house before walking up the drive. We
watch her peek through windows and walk around back,
looking for something. What exactly, we don't know.
(Neither does she.)
She makes her way back to the starting point and fixes
her stare now on the barn. The one place he hasn't
looked.
Miranda comes crashing out of the barn, doubles over and
throws up. The bright light outside blinding her
momentarily. Her bloodshot eyes taking a moment to
register --
THE PATROL CAR
parked in front of the house. A POLICE OFFICER
cautiously peering inside her stolen car. He looks up
and notices her.
Miranda hesitates. Nowhere to run.
The officer waves.
His name is TURLINGTON.
OFFICER TURLINGTON
Howdy there.
He says this while already strolling over.
Miranda's
mind races a mile a minute --
OFFICER TURLINGTON
Everything okay?
MIRANDA
Y-yes.
OFFICER TURLINGTON
That your vehicle, ma'am?
She stares at the young, friendly cop. His left hand
resting on his belt. Right next to his gun. But it
seems as if he has no idea who she is. At least not yet.
MIRANDA
Yes -- I -- I just pulled over.
I
was -- looking for a bathroom.
Morning sickness, you know...
OFFICER TURLINGTON
Congratulations. But I'm afraid
this is private property -- you
can't just waltz on in. You
understand that.
She nods, nerves shot to hell.
Starts walking.
MIRANDA
I'll be on my merry way now. My
husband will never forgive me if I
get a ticket for trespassing.
(CONTINUED)
76.
CONTINUED:
The cop nods at that, seeming to have a fair grasp of
marital dynamics. He flashes a smile but suddenly stops,
whips out his gun and trains it on her --
OFFICER TURLINGTON
Holy shit.
(clicks the safety
off)
Lady, stay right where you are.
Miranda shuts her eyes, busted.
Freezes.
OFFICER TURLINGTON
Hands up where I can see them.
Miranda awkwardly raises her shaky hands.
OFFICER TURLINGTON
Nice and slow, start talking to
me. And make it good. Tell me
just exactly who that is.
A confused Miranda slowly turns in the direction he's
looking to see Tracy Seaver at the barn door. Dragging
herself in agony, clearly in a severe state of shock.
Battered, yet somehow -- incredibly -- still alive.
But just barely.
A car pulls up to the chaotic ER area.
Phil Parsons and
Pete step out, rush inside.
Pete hurries down the front steps of the main building as
TWO POLICE CRUISERS pull up. Miranda is brought out of
one of the cruisers by two OFFICERS.
PETE
We can take those off now.
Sheriff Ryan leans out of the other cruiser.
SHERIFF RYAN
Don't push it, Doctor. She's
cuffed until your people secure
her in a cell.
(CONTINUED)
82.
CONTINUED:
Pete sighs, gestures for the officers to bring her in.
Irene and two heavy-duty orderlies will also be part of
the escort. Miranda locks eyes with Pete as she
approaches.
PETE
Are you alright?
MIRANDA
(quietly)
I was wrong. It wasn't Phil
Parsons. It was Doug.
PETE
Can we talk about this later?
(to Sheriff)
Thanks, Sheriff.
SHERIFF RYAN
Tomorrow morning first thing my
deputies are here.
PETE
I know, I know. We'll see you
then.
SHERIFF RYAN
And my offer still stands if you
need added security.
PETE
Thank you. She won't go anywhere.
I guarantee it.
The Sheriff waves, whatever. Knocks twice on the hood
and the officer behind the wheel shifts into drive.
MIRANDA
That's why Rachel picked me.
It
was Doug. I'm so stupid.
Pete regards her now, has no idea what she's going on
about this time. Tries to remain professional.
PETE
Inside, okay?
A tense Phil and Dorothy Parsons in their parked car.
DOROTHY
I'm not doing it for Miranda, I'm
doing this for Rachel.
PARSONS
You're making a complete fool of
yourself. Do you realize what you
sound like?
She sighs, climbs out of the car, leaving him there.
Takes three steps. Stops. Turns back around and lets
him have it:
DOROTHY
What do I sound like, Phil? Like
one of your patients? Well, it's
probably because that's exactly
how you treat me. And I've had
enough of this deafening silence
between us, this exemplary
mourning in front of the
community, tiptoeing around our
lives with you pretending Rachel
never existed.
BANK CUSTOMERS walk around the argument, pretending not
to hear. Phil is mortified. But Dorothy doesn't care:
(CONTINUED)
87.
CONTINUED:
DOROTHY
I'm losing my mind. Our daughter
is gone and I miss her and I'm
angry.
She turns and storms off. Phil takes it all in for the
first time. A moment later he climbs out of the car.
The sky darkens fast.
The storm moving in.
We're back at the bridge.
Rachel pries open Miranda's
mouth. Miranda panics:
MIRANDA
What are you doing? I'm trying to
help you -- ?!
Rachel opens her mouth wide like a snake. And as Miranda
screams, blood starts leaking out of Rachel's wounds.
And now we see it. Rachel's lips touch Miranda's and
BREATHE HER SPIRIT INTO Miranda with a WHOOSH --
90.
Two POLICE CRUISERS parked outside.
The WIND has really PICKED UP now. A massive LIGHTNING
BOLT streaks the sky, officially announcing the storm's
onset.
A POLICE CRUISER pulls up to the guard gate.
93.
FIRE ENGINES and PATROL CARS arrive at the scene, SIRENS
blazing. Sheriff Ryan and additional deputies rush from
their cars to contain the breakout. A large SPOTLIGHT
comes to life. We spot Jenna making a run for the garden
wall when the spotlight hits her. Two officers rush
after her.
A car pulls up at the scene.
Pete and Parsons step out.
(CONTINUED)
97.
CONTINUED:
PETE
Miranda...
Pete rushes up the steps --
Turlington escorts a cuffed Miranda to a waiting cruiser.
He jumps behind the wheel and starts to pull out when
Pete suddenly taps on Miranda's window, startling her --
(CONTINUED)
103.
CONTINUED:
PETE
I'll call your lawyer and -- !
OFFICER TURLINGTON
Sir, not now --
PETE
I'll meet you at the station!
She shakes her head.
Mouths something Pete can't make out.
OFFICER TURLINGTON
Sir, please --
PETE
What?
Turlington hits the gas. Miranda presses her face
against the window so only Pete can see her say the
following:
MIRANDA
The girl in the hospital.
Pete locks eyes with her, nods -- as the cruiser leaves.
WE SEE Turlington and two other COPS climb in a patrol
car and drive off. WE MOVE INSIDE the empty station...
Turlington comes out of his cruiser, carrying a bag of
take-out food. Chatting with his colleagues.
CAMERA SOARS THROUGH the tall gates, PAST the guard, PAST
the sprinklers watering the impressive gardens. A
TAXICAB pulls up.
SUPERIMPOSE:
SIX MONTHS LATER
A healthier, much happier-looking Chloe shakes Pete's
hand at the front steps. Small suitcase by her side.
CHLOE
Thank you for everything, Dr.
Graham. I'll never forget all
you've done for me.
PETE
It's been my pleasure, Miss
McGrath. Good luck out there.
Chloe smiles.
Awkward.
Her first day out in the real
world.
CHLOE
Well, I guess this is it. I hope
not to see you again unless it's
for coffee or something.
PETE
Hey, you never know. It's a small
world, unless you have to clean it.
Chloe picks up her bag, climbs down the steps to her cab.
Stops midway, turns:
CHLOE
You don't have to tell me if you
don't want to, but -- have you
ever heard anything from -- ?
Pete shakes his head. Chloe nods, climbs inside the cab.
Pete waves as it drives off. Then he pulls out a postcard
from his pocket. It has a New York City postmark.
115.
INSERT - POSTCARD
MIRANDA (V.O.)
Dear Pete. Hope this finds you on
both feet, preferably having been
promoted to director after Phil's
retirement. Not that you had much
competition, but a big hug to you
anyway... I was as surprised as
anyone to read about Sheriff
Ryan's suicide and the startling
discovery that it was he who
murdered my late husband. I wish
I could personally thank certain
people for their convincing
testimonies in the case.
NEWSPAPER HEADLINES
fly AT us under her V.O.:
A) "Female doctor still at large, wanted for
questioning," with a picture of Miranda underneath.
B) "Guilt-ridden serial killer killed accomplice, then
killed self: Female Doctor cleared on charges."
Pictures of Sheriff Ryan and Douglas Grey side by side.
C) "Authorities close case on dual serial killers:
community mourns murdered daughters." A picture of
Officer Turlington, Pete, and Phil Parsons at a press
conference.
MIRANDA (V.O.)
As for myself, I have a new name
now and a job working with teenage
girls at a runaway shelter, trying
to keep an open mind at the
horrors they tell me...
BOOM DOWN TO a young woman kneeling down to set flowers
on a grave and we recognize her as Tracy Seaver.
Shockingly cleaned up and properly attired -- she's even
cute.
MIRANDA (V.O.)
Which reminds me: Consuelo the
Cuban witch is a keeper, don't
fire her. She knows things about
the world you and I don't.
(CONTINUED)
116.
CONTINUED:
PULL BACK to see the gave is Rachel's, and it is
positively overflowing with flowers. She's become
something of a cause celeb in these parts. Tracy walks
back to the retired couple holding hands, Phil and
Dorothy Parsons.
MIRANDA (V.O.)
Well, gotta run now, I have some
country songs to write and lots of
social invites to decline...
STILL PULLING BACK THROUGH the lush cemetery, PAST
several trees until we find Rachel watching the serene
scene. She turns TO CAMERA now and we PUSH INTO her
eyes, finally at peace, until it FILLS the SCREEN and in
it we see...
Miranda walking among the throng of pedestrians. She
looks confident, relaxed, down to earth. No longer the
tightly wound professional at the beginning of our story.
MIRANDA (V.O.)
P.S. And in case you're wondering
what the chances are of me buying
you a beer and maybe finishing
something we almost started, the
answer is: it's just not going to
happen. Especially not at
McSorley's next Friday night. Say
around nine. So you probably
shouldn't bother showing up. All
my love, M.G.
She turns at the light and gets lost in the crowd.
FADE OUT.
