      An office birthday party is in progress.  LISBON sits with a 
      cake in front of her, candles lit.  There is small stack of 
      presents next to her.  CHO, RIGSBY and VAN PELT are just 
      finishing singing.  

                                  VAN PELT
                    Blow out the candles and make a 
                    wish.

      Lisbon blows out the candles.

                                  VAN PELT (CONT D)
                    Okay, now the presents. 

      Lisbon picks up the first gift.  An air of anticipation.  
      They are about to play what has become a birthday ritual: the 
        stump-the-Mentalist game.  Lisbon looks at the cylindrical 
      package to see if she can guess what it is.

                                  LISBON
                    A vase?

                                  JANE
                    It s a yoga mat.

      Lisbon looks over at Van Pelt, who smiles and shrugs: he s 
      right.  Lisbon opens the present -- a yoga mat.

                                  VAN PELT
                    We talked about that Ashtanga 
                    class.  I thought...

                                  LISBON
                    Thank you.  It s very nice.

                                  CHO
                    Okay, what about mine?

      Cho hands Lisbon a wrapped box.  Jane eyes the box, eyes Cho.

                                  JANE
                    A bottle of wine.  Champagne, I d 
                    guess.  Vintage?

      He raises an eyebrow at Cho s extravagance.

                                  CHO
                    I think birthday s are important.

      Lisbon opens the box: Jane was right again.  He smiles 
      happily.  Rigsby holds up his -- an envelope.  

                                  RIGSBY
                          (confident)
                    Ten bucks you don t get this one.

      Jane stares at the envelope as if with X-ray eyes.

                                  JANE
                    Gift certificate to... some kind of 
                    spa?  

      Rigsby hands it to Lisbon.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Damn.  

      She opens the envelope and finds a gift certificate.

                                  JANE
                    How about some cake?

                                  CHO
                    Where s your present?

      Oh shit.  Jane covers.

                                  JANE
                    It s on its way.

      Lisbon shakes her head.

                                  LISBON
                    Typical.

      Van Pelt s PHONE RINGS and she answers it.

                                  JANE
                    What does that mean?  You don t 
                    really think I forgot your present, 
                    do you?

      Lisbon looks at him, cuts the cake.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    It s on its way.

                                  LISBON
                    Yeah right.

      Lisbon passes out pieces of cake, just a tad disappointed.

      Cho and Rigsby laugh at him.  Lisbon glares at Jane with mock 
      ferocity, hefts the piece of cake in her hand with plans of 
      mayhem, but Van Pelt puts down the phone and saves the day...

                                  VAN PELT
                    -- Boss, we got a call.  

      Jane looks relieved.


      The CBI team enters.  Inside is an attack on the senses -- 
      FLASHING LIGHTS, BELLS, WHISTLES and SIRENS.  

                                  JANE
                    Who s got a dollar?

                    I do.

      Jane holds out his hand.  Cho hesitates, he s not loose with 
      his money.

                                  JANE
                    I ll give it right back.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)            THE MENTALIST     "Red Sauce"     GREEN 3/09/09     7.

      He takes a dollar from Cho, and makes his way to a change 
      machine.  He feeds in Cho s dollar, four tokens are released.  
      Jane holds one of them up for CBI to see: the same diamond-
      cut pattern as the token found on the body.  Grins.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Open sesame.

      Lisbon has to give it up again.

                                  LISBON
                    Well, okay...

      Jane gives Cho the tokens.


      Sitting on a high stool, the OWNER, a paunchy, balding man 
      staring down at a PICTURE of the victim.  Shocked, but too 
      jaded and sedentary to show much.  Talking with Jane and 
      Lisbon.

                                  OWNER (O.S.)
                    Yup, wow.  Wow.  That s Ed

                    working for me about two years.  

      Jane looks pointedly to Lisbon.  He was right.

                                  LISBON
                    Okay.  Okay.

      Lisbon takes the photograph back.  

                                  LISBON
                    Somebody killed him.  You know of 
                    anything that could explain why 
                    that happened?

      The Owner shakes his head slowly.

                                  OWNER
                    No.  Kept to himself, mostly.  No

                    yourself, that s an untenable 
                    ethical position.  Every modern 
                    society has some kind of police 
                    force.  It s like saying, screw the 
                    public transport system. 

      Beat of silence as the teenagers stare in bemusement.  


      Jane racks up a huge score on the pinball machine.  The crowd 
      of spectators has grown.  Putt Putt and Midget Thug still 
      among them.  All very impressed.  Rigsby s bored.

                                  PUTT PUTT
                    Crazy.  How d you do that?

                                  JANE
                    Focus.  Watch now.  I m going to 
                    make this machine do my bidding.

      Jane works the machine with fingers and body English like 
      Fred Astaire.  

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Do.  Exactly.  What.  I.  Tell.  
                    You.

      BELLS RING and LIGHTS FLASH as Jane hits a record score.  
      About twenty balls come cascading into the game.  The crowd 
      cheers, all transfixed by the display.  Jane steps away from 
      the machine and looks to the Midget Thug.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Take over.

      Midget Thug does as he s told instantly.  Jane touches Putt 
      Putt.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Come with me.

      Obediently, Putt Putt follows Jane and Rigsby past his posse 
      of friends and over to a corner table at the snack bar.


      Jane, Rigsby and Putt Putt sit down.

                                  JANE
                    Tell us what you know about Ed 
                      Didrikson.

      Putt Putt frowns, placing the name.

                                  PUTT-PUTT
                    Oh, yeah.  Eddie that works here? 

                                  JANE
                    Yes. 

                                  PUTT-PUTT
                    Eddie s a cool guy.  He ll hook you 
                    up any time, if he knows you.  

                                  JANE 
                    Hook you up with what?

                                  PUTT-PUTT
                    Yeah, you know, weed.  It s Tiny s 
                    stuff, but --

                    stuff, same price, but he doesn t 
                    mess with people like Tiny does.  
                    Or you can borrow money from him?  
                    He charges a heavy vig, but that s 
                    alright.

                    A vig? 

                                  PUTT-PUTT
                    Yeah, why?  Did I say it wrong?  
                    Vig?

      Jane looks to Rigsby.

                                  JANE
                    Did he say it wrong?

                                  RIGSBY
                    No, that s right.

      Jane turns back to Putt-Putt.

                                  JANE
                    What else can you tell us about 
                    him?

                                  PUTT-PUTT
                    He s always talking about respect. 
                    Won t tolerate any kind of dis.  
                    One time Slow Ritchie gave him the 
                    finger?  Eddie just reached out and 
                    broke it.  Man, you could hear the 
                    crack.  Ritchie s on the floor 
                    screaming and Did looks at him real 
                    cold, cusses him out in French or 
                      something, and goes about his 
                    business.

                                  RIGSBY

                    What?  Eddie?  No?  What happened?

      Putt Putt had no idea.

                    That s too bad.  He was a good guy.

      He taps Putt Putt on the chest, breaking the light hypnotic 
      contact.  Putt Putt hesitates -- What just happened? -- then 
      wanders off back inside the arcade. 

                                  JANE (CONT D)

      Lisbon, Cho and Van Pelt move round the ground floor, in 
      proper SWAT style.  In the living room, the television is 
      tuned to an EXERCISE PROGRAM with the SOUND OFF.

                    Mrs. Didrikson?!

      Lisbon and Cho and Van Pelt start up the stairs, but are 
      confronted by JENNY DIDRIKSON crouched at the top, a SHOTGUN 
      in her hands, pointed at them.  (NB -- we ll come to know her 
      better as GINA RUSSO, so that s what we ll call her from the 
      start.)

      The CBI trio scramble for cover.

                                  GINA
                          (scared but firm)

      Lisbon talks loud and calm, from cover.

                                  LISBON 
                    Mrs. Didrikson, I m going to show

      Before Lisbon can answer, the front door is kicked open and a 
      team of US MARSHALS burst in, guns drawn, while another team 
      of MARSHALS enters from the back.

      FADE IN:


      A Mexican standoff with Lisbon, Van Pelt and Cho, the US 
      Marshals, and Gina/Jenny Didrikson, all pointing guns at each 
      other.  Jane s voice can be heard coming from Lisbon s phone, 
      still in her hand.

                    Lisbon?  I think Didrikson used to

                    Witness Protection.  That s why 
                    he s out here.  I m on my way.  Be

      Snaps shut her phone.  The lead Marshal -- EXLEY, (40 s) in 
      plain clothes -- stares at Lisbon and the others in 
      confusion.  KNOX, his partner, female, African-American, 
      stands by.

      They all gingerly lower their weapons.  Even Gina.  Exley

      She tries to go for Knox.  Van Pelt has to hold her back 
      tightly.

      Van Pelt and Cho sit across from Jenny Didrikson, who used to 
      be Gina Russo.  She is distraught.

                    Gina then.  When did you last see 
                    your husband?

                                  GINA 
                    Last Friday morning.  He never came  
                    home from work.  He called that 
                    afternoon and said he had some 
                    business to do, that he d be home 
                    late.  That s the last I heard from 
                    him.

                                  CHO
                    What kind of business was that?

                                  GINA
                    I don t know.  Business.  I didn t 
                    ask.

                                  CHO
                    You didn t ask?  Or you didn t want 
                    to know?

                    Oh I get it.  He s a bad man. 
                    Must have been doing something 
                    wrong, yeah?  Out there raping and 
                    killing people probably.  Deserved 
                    what he got uh?

      Jane enters, watch from the doorway.

                    did.  My husband did the right

                    country asked him to do.  So why

      Three BIKERS sit in a circle around a suitcase of beer.  It s 
      the end of the day, work s over, they re kicking back,

      They fall in a heap on the floor and things are about to get 
      ugly, when Van Pelt pulls the stun gun she grabbed from the 
      glove box out of her pocket, and she zaps Tiny with it.  He 
      calms down very abruptly.  Rigsby, still holding onto Tiny, 
      is zapped as well.  

                                  RIGSBY (CONT D)

                                  LISBON
                    Come to my office.  It s quieter.


      Exley and Knox sit facing Lisbon.

                                  LISBON 
                    I won t beat around the bush.  Two 
                    weeks ago, did you guys get Eddie 
                    Russo off the hook on a drug bust? 

      Exley and Knox both look surprised and angry by the notion.

                                  EXLEY 
                    No.  We did not.  What are you 
                    talking about?   

                                  LISBON
                    Somebody did.  And made Russo s 
                      accomplice very angry at him.

                                  KNOX 
                          (flustered)
                    Why would we do that?

                                  LISBON
                    Maybe you made a deal with Russo. 
                    Maybe he gets to deal drugs and 
                      whathaveyou and you look the other 
                    way and even help him out; just so 
                    long as he keeps helping the Feds 
                    do their thing.   

                                  EXLEY
                    Let me explain the real world to 
                    you, Teresa.  Russo is already 
                    squeezed dry for testimony.  
                    The Federal Prosecutors don t need 
                    him any more.  They don t give a 
                    damn what happens to him.  And 
                    neither do we.  If he gets busted, 
                    that s his problem.  Less work for 
                    us.  

      Exley stands.  Knox follows his lead.  Cho enters.  





                                                                            (CONTINUED)            THE MENTALIST     "Red Sauce"     GREEN 3/09/09     33.

                                  EXLEY (CONT D)
                    So, either the local cops were in 
                    business with Russo, or, my guess, 
                    you re just as misinformed as you 
                    are disrespectful and dumb.  

      Exley leaves, followed by Knox, Cho standing aside to let 
      them by.

                                  CHO
                    Bye now.

                                  LISBON
                    Sounds dirty, doesn t he?

                                  CHO
                    Yup.

                                  LISBON
                    Check with IA on him and his 
                    partner.  See if anything pops. 

      Cho nods.

                    And where s Jane?

      Cho clears his throat uneasily.

                                  CHO 
                    Uh, don t get mad, but I have a 
                    feeling he might have gone to talk 
                    to Battaglia.  

                                  LISBON
                    Damn it.

                                  CHO
                    Should one of us head down to Palm 
                    Desert just in case?

      Lisbon considers it, shakes her head.

                                  LISBON
                    He made his bed. 


      Lisbon, Cho, and Rigsby look incredulously at Jane.  The case 
      timeline is on a whiteboard behind them.

                                  RIGSBY
                    You played golf, with Sonny 
                      Battaglia.

                                  JANE
                    I did. 

                                  LISBON
                    And what did you find out?

                                  JANE
                    Battaglia didn t kill Russo, and 
                    golf is easy.   

                                  LISBON
                    You re sure of that?

                                  JANE
                    Sure.  It s all about rhythm.  
                    Anyone can do it.

      Lisbon gives him a deadpan...

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Yes.  Battaglia s clean.  I think,  
                    hard to say with sociopaths.
                    That doesn t mean some other 
                    mafioso didn t do it of course.  
                    Battaglia thinks it s a jealous 
                    lover.

                                  CHO
                    The key is who sprung Eddie from 
                    that charge.  And I m betting it 
                    was those Marshals. 

                                  RIGSBY
                    Which means we have to accuse the 
                    Sierra Vista PD of double-dealing.  
                    That s always fun.  

      Van Pelt enters from the other side of the office.

                    A vehicle registered to Edwin 
                    Didrikson just entered the system.  
                    It was towed from the lot outside 
                    House of Games Monday morning.

      Rigsby shakes his head in disbelief.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Sierra Vista PD couldn t find their 
                    ass in the dark.  

                                  LISBON
                    If Russo s car was still outside 
                    House of Games, it means someone 
                    picked him up.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Maybe the arcade security cameras 
                    got a picture of who that was.

                                  LISBON
                    Let s find out.


      The place is empty, lights down.  The Owner is trying to fix 
      the Dance Revolution machine.  Rigsby and Cho talk to him.

                                  RIGSBY
                    We need to look at your security 
                    tapes. 

                                  OWNER
                    Tapes?  I have no tapes.

                                  CHO
                    You have cameras.

                                  OWNER 
                    Of course.  But only the little red 
                    light works.  That s all you need. 
                    What you want to see anyhow?  
                    Nothing happened here.

                                  RIGSBY
                    We want to know who picked up 
                    Russo. 

                                  OWNER
                    I can tell you that.  His wife 
                    picked him up.  I saw her in the 
                    parking lot.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)            THE MENTALIST     "Red Sauce"     GREEN 3/09/09     39.

                                  OWNER
                    Yeah.  

                                  CHO
                    You re sure it was her?

                    Sure.  I mean, I assume it was his 
                    wife.  She s picked him up a couple 
                    times before. 

                                  CHO
                    Brunette, slim, maybe five-four?

                    Glasses, short hair.  

      Cho and Rigsby look at each other in surprise.


      Marshal Exley comes barging in, mad as all get out.  Yells at 
      Jane and Lisbon, the only people there.

                    What do you people think you re

                    Hello, Marshal Exley. 

                                  EXLEY
                    I just got a call from my chief 
                    telling me that you put in an 
                    offical request to question Marshal 
                    Knox.  As a person of interest in 
                    the Russo case.

                                  LISBON
                    Yes.   

                                  EXLEY 
                    Why are you trying to ruin her?  
                    It s all over the department.

                                  LISBON
                    Did you know she met with Russo 
                    Friday night, the night he 
                    vanished?

                                  EXLEY
                    You re saying she fingered him?  
                    Set him up for the mob?

                                  JANE
                    It certainly looks that way.

                                  EXLEY 
                    That s garbage.  That s absurd.  I 
                    would have known.  She s my partner 
                    for godsake.  I would know if she 
                    wasn t straight. 

                                  LISBON 
                    We confirmed with Sierra Vista PD.  
                    When Russo got arrested, Knox went 
                    in and got him off the charges, as 
                    if on behalf of the Marshal s 
                    Service. 

      Another blow to Exley.  His world s upside down.

                                  EXLEY
                    But why would she do that?

                                  JANE
                    No good fingering Russo if he s 
                    locked up safe in prison.

                                  EXLEY 
                          (weakly)
                    This is a mistake.  There s some 
                      explanation.

                                  LISBON
                    Why can t we find her to hear her 
                    say that?

                                  EXLEY
                    I don t know.

      Lisbon on the phone, walking in, to Jane and Cho with Exley, 
      who sits with head in hands.

                    she ll make it.

      Exley takes a beat, murmuring thanks and prayers to whatever 
      God he favors.

      Exley stifles a flash of anger.

                                  EXLEY 
                      I understand.  You have a job to 
                    do.  

                                  JANE
                    Hey, here s a thought.  What if you 
                    did it?

      He points at Exley

                                  EXLEY
                          (indignant)
                    Me?  What?  Me?  

      Jane cogitating swiftly and he s seeing it all now...

                                  LISBON
                    Jane...

                                  JANE
                    Yes.  Knox didn t set Russo up for 
                    the mob.  She was meeting him that 
                    night because they were having an 
                    affair.

      The other CBI team members are intrigued.  Exley is angered.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Yes.  It makes sense.

                                  EXLEY
                    That s absurd!

                                  JANE
                    See how angry?  That lowlife crook 
                    in bed with your Christy?  Don t go 
                    telling us you don t have a secret 
                    crush on her... 

                                  EXLEY 
                    Don t push me.  That s crap, okay?

                                  JANE
                    And this is the sort of scandal 
                    that screws up your career, along 
                    with hers, right?  Any man in your 
                    position would want to kill him.

                                  EXLEY 
                    That s enough.

      Jane raises innocent palms.

                    I don t say that you did know about 
                    the affair.  I m only saying that 
                    if you did, you d be our prime 
                    suspect.  Funny really, your best 
                    defense is your apparent lack of 
                    the most basic detective skills. 

      Exley goes for Jane. 

                                  EXLEY

      Cho steps in his path.

                    Sorry.  Just thinking aloud.  No 
                    offense.

      Exley growls at Jane and stalks out.  

                                  LISBON
                    Well, that pushed his buttons.  
                    Cho, come with me to the hospital. 
                          (to Van Pelt and Rigsby)
                    You two go see Gina Russo.  
                    See what she has to say about all 
                    this.

                                  JANE
                    I will try.

      Lisbon exits with Cho.  Jane turns to Van Pelt.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Can I see your phone?

      Van Pelt hands him her phone.

                                  VAN PELT
                    You really think he did it?  Exley?

      Jane takes the phone, taps in a number.

                                  JANE
                    Do you think he did it?

                                  VAN PELT
                    If there was an affair, he had 
                    motive, like you say.

      Jane hands Van Pelt back her phone.

                                  JANE 
                    When someone answers, say,  Is Mary

      We hear a MUFFLED VOICE answer.  Van Pelt hesitates.  Jane

      Jane hands Rigsby a pair of black sunglasses.  He puts them 
      on.  Jane appraises the effect.

      Rigsby sighs, but does as he s asked.  Jane punches in a 
      number.

      Rigsby holds the phone away from his ear, looks at Jane.

                    Romantic?  With the Marshal lady?
                          (laughs)
                    No.  Never happen.  No.  You 
                    kidding me?

                                  JANE
                    Why are you so sure?  Eddie liked 
                    the ladies, didn t he?  A 
                      womanizer.  Famous for it. 

                                  GINA
                    In his old life, maybe.  He 
                    changed.

                                  JANE
                    Changed?  Really?  You think people 
                    can change who they are?  

                                  GINA
                    Sure.  People change.

                                  JANE
                    Eddie couldn t change.  He used to 
                    be somebody.  Now he s got to be 
                    nobody?  No.  So even after 
                    dragging you all the way out here 
                    to the middle of nowhere, still 
                    some nights he didn t come home.  
                    Business, right?  Just like before. 

      Gina s silence is a form of assent.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Before you can move on, you have to 
                    make things right now, Gina.  Tell 
                    the truth.

      Gina pushes her plate away, makes a contemptuous gesture.

                                  GINA
                    That for the truth.  I m saying 
                    nothing.

                                  JANE
                    You found out he was cheating and 
                    you snapped.  You shot him.

      Gina glares at Jane defiantly.

                    You can say whatever you like.  
                    Means nothing.  You have to prove 
                    it.

                                  JANE
                    Where did you do it, Gina?  Where s 
                    the gun you used?

      Gina dead eyes Jane, gets up.

                                  GINA
                    You want some coffee?  Dessert? 

                                  JANE
                    No thanks.  

      He watches her as she crosses to the refrigerator.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    The reason I m here alone?  My 
                      colleagues are kinda straight 
                    arrows.  I didn t want them mixed 
                    up in anything, you know, sketchy.    

                                  GINA
                    What sketchy?

      Beat.  Jane gives Gina a sinister look.

                                  JANE
                    I went to talk to Sonny Battaglia.  
                    See what he had to say about all 
                    this.

                                  GINA
                    Oh?

                                  JANE
                    He s an impressive man.  Knows how 
                    to get what he wants.

                                  GINA
                    He s a vicious scumbag.

                                  JANE
                    Yes.  He doesn t speak well of you 
                    either.  He seems to think it was 
                    you that encouraged Eddie to turn 
                    rat in the first place. 

                                  GINA

                    That s what he thinks.  And you 
                    know how he is once he gets an idea 
                    in his head.  Stubborn. 
                          (beat)
                    He offered me a very sweet deal.

      Gina s scared now.

                                  GINA
                    What kind of deal?

                                  JANE
                    What kind do you think?

      Gina looks around instinctively for danger.

                                  GINA
                    Tell me.

      Jane gets up, crosses to Gina.

                                  JANE
                    Gina, here s the bottom line. 
                    Either you can make me look good 
                    with the cops, and confess what you 
                    did.  Or, you can make me look good 
                    with Battaglia, and die. 
                    Your choice.

      Gina backs away from Jane.

                                  GINA
                    Die?  But, but, you re a cop.

      Jane follows.

                                  JANE
                    And they never bend the law, do 
                    they?  Besides, I m not a real cop, 
                    I m a consultant.  I m not breaking 
                    any oaths to the State or anything. 
                    Just looking out for number one.
                          (looks at his watch)
                    Better make up your mind.  
                      Battaglia s man is on his way.

      Gina takes a beat.  Looks at Jane shrewdly.

                                  GINA
                    I don t believe you.

      He takes out his phone, punches in a number.

                    Yes.  Sure.  I ll put her on.

      He hands the phone to Gina, who takes it warily.

                                  GINA
                    Hello?


      Gina snaps the phone shut, terrified now.

                    What s it going to be, Gina?

      He takes out a little mini digital recorder.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Confess or die?

      A CAR PULLS UP outside.  It s the CBI car, but Gina doesn t 
      know that.  Jane peers out the window.  His POV -- Rigsby 
      gets out, walks toward the front door, wearing his hair 
      slicked back a little, and sunglasses.  He looks the part. 

                                  JANE
                    He s here already.  Didn t think 
                    he d be so fast.

      Gina looks out the window, sees Rigsby.  Sees him adjust his 
      concealed shoulder holster.

                                  GINA
                    Oh God.

      Gina looks around frantically for protection.  Jane holds up 
      the recorder.

                                  JANE
                    There s no guns in the house.  
                    The police took them all.  
                    It s me or him, Gina.  Me or him.

                    Alright!  Alright!  I confess.

                    I watched him leave work with her 
                    on Friday night.  I followed them 
                    to a motel.  They were there for 
                    two hours and then she drove him 
                    back to his car, and there was 
                    nobody around.  I shot him.  Then I 
                    drove him to a bridge and I dumped 
                    him over the edge.  

      Jane turns off the recorder.

        A chastened-looking Exley is talking to Lisbon and Jane.

                    Knox wanted to apologize to you in

                    She s out of the Marshal service, 
                    of course.  She s going to take 
                    some time to figure out what to do 
                    next.

      He clears his throat awkwardly.

      He shakes his head.

                    It certainly isn t the way we do 
                    things in the Marshal s Office, but 
                    I guess it worked.

      He heads out.  Lisbon turns to Jane.

                    Yeah.  Speaking of which -- what

                    Anyhoo, you needn t be grumpy anymore. 

      Jane gestures toward her office.  Lisbon gives him a 
      suspicious look and walks warily into --


      -- there she finds, grazing placidly at the papers on her desk -- 
      a small but BEAUTIFUL PONY, with a sign around its neck saying, 
       Happy Birthday.   Lisbon turns to yell at Jane, but he has such 
      a happy smile on his face, as do Van Pelt and Rigsby and Cho, 
      who have gathered to watch; that she can t help but smile 
      herself, just a little.

                                                                          FADE OUT.
