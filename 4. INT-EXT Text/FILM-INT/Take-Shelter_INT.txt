Curtis holds his head under the running shower nozzle. Cool,
clean water rushes over his face.
SAMANTHA(29) stands at the stovetop stirring eggs in a pan.
She's still dressed in her sleeping attire, an oversized T-
shirt and pajama bottoms with cartoon frogs on them.
HANNAH(5) sits at the kitchen table tearing up a piece of
toast and feeding it to the dog.
2.
Hannah is a blonde little girl with a large hearing aid
wrapped over her right ear. It clips into her hair near the
back of her head. The dog's name is Red, a Rhodesian
Ridgeback that appreciates the attention.
Curtis enters the kitchen and kisses Hannah on the head. In
the same motion, he takes the piece of toast from her hand
and sets it on her plate.
CURTIS
(takes a seat)
No, no, no...Don't feed the dog
darlin'.
Hannah immediately picks the piece of toast back up and feeds
it to the dog. Samantha brings the pan over and spoons eggs
out on everyone's plates.
CURTIS (CONT'D)
Thanks babe.
SAMANTHA
You slept late.
CURTIS
Yeah. I need to go. What you got
going today?
SAMANTHA
I've got to finish up some curtains
for Saturday, and Nat and Cam are
coming over.
CURTIS
(MOUTH FULL)
With the kids?
SAMANTHA
Yeah. Cammie said she just needed
to get out of the house.
Samantha takes her seat at the table.
CURTIS
Tell Nat to take it easy on her.
Curtis gets up and goes to Hannah.
SAMANTHA
Cam can hold her own. We need to
send in the deposit for the beach
condo.
He kneels beside his daughter's chair and waits for her to
make eye contact. She looks over at him. He speaks using
sign language. Three broad, slow gestures.
3.
CURTIS
(SIGNING)
I love you.
Hannah puts her arms around his neck and he squeezes her. He
stands and grabs a sack lunch off the counter. On his way
out, he kisses Samantha on top of the head.
CURTIS (CONT'D)
Just write the check, babe. Okay.
SAMANTHA
Okay. Bye.
Samantha sips her coffee as Hannah feeds more toast to the
dog.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
(as she signs)
No more food. You, eat.
Samantha sits at a table running a long piece of sheer fabric
through her sewing machine. She's making curtains.
NAT(37) sips a screwdriver from a clear plastic cup designed
not to sweat. She's a woman with rough edges.
CAMMIE(24) cradles a brown-haired BABY on top of her
pregnant, eight month belly.
As Nat speaks, she looks out a sliding glass door at her two
kids, DJ(7) and SUE(5), playing with Hannah.
NAT
They were just drinkin' and
laughin' and oh, my god...it was
like I was bein' in a museum and I
saw the progress from apes to men.
I saw it. I saw the future.
Dewart, that was him...that was
going to be him in 20 years.
SAMANTHA
Oh my god.
Cammie laughs.
NAT
Let me tell you, you laugh. You
laugh. But this little one in your
arms is gonna be shufflin' in a bar
just like `em. Yep...
(GLANCES OUTSIDE)
Hannah!
Samantha jumps up from her sewing to see outside. Hannah,
with her back to the house, bangs a 2 X 4 with a rusted nail
in the end into the ground. Samantha is out the door.
5.
The lights are out and the house is quiet. Curtis eases open
the front door and steps inside. Standing on the door mat,
he slips off his mud-caked boots and gently sets them aside.
AT HANNAH'S BEDROOM DOOR,
Curtis places his palm flat on the door and lets it open.
Hannah is curled up with the covers. He watches her sleep.
Samantha, barefoot and wearing a sleep shirt, walks up behind
Curtis. He turns his head when she approaches.
CURTIS
(SOFTLY)
Hey baby.
She wraps her arms around his waist and he lifts his elbow to
make room for her. They whisper.
CURTIS (CONT'D)
She do all right today?
9.
SAMANTHA
She was fine. She's still not
playin' with the others, though.
She can't connect. Honey, you
gotta clean up that trash pile in
the back. She fished out a board
that had nails on it.
CURTIS
I'll get to it this weekend.
It's quiet for a moment.
CURTIS (CONT'D)
I still take off my boots so I
won't wake her up.
She smiles up at her husband.
SAMANTHA
I still whisper.
He pulls her tight. They stand together in the doorway. The
house is silent.
Curtis bolts up in bed grabbing his forearm. He grinds his
teeth and doubles over in pain. It takes a moment for him to
find his bearings.
His breathing slows. He gently rubs his hand over the skin
on his arm. Sweat has collected around his collar and
temples.
From the bed, sheets in a twisted mess, he looks around the
room unsure of what just happened to him.
Eggs cool on a plate.
Curtis sits at the kitchen table dressed for work. He stares
vacantly at his breakfast.
He looks up at Hannah. She sits on the floor surrounded by
toy building blocks and plays with the dog. She rubs under
Red's chest and in turn he licks her face. She smiles and
gently pushes him away.
Samantha sits with her knees up drinking coffee.
11.
SAMANTHA
Curtis?
CURTIS
What?
SAMANTHA
Did you hear me? You got to be
home, showered, ready to walk out
the door by six tonight.
Curtis stands up and goes over to Hannah. He grabs her off
the floor and she begins to protest with kicks and crying.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
What's wrong?
CURTIS
Nothing. I just want her to eat her
breakfast and stop playin' with the
damn dog.
SAMANTHA
She's fine down there. She had
toast already.
Curtis, against flailing, manages to get Hannah in her chair.
Curtis backs off, frustrated. Hannah climbs down from her
chair and goes back to the floor and the dog.
CURTIS
Hannah. Come here. Hannah.
SAMANTHA
Curtis?
CURTIS
What?
He stops and checks his watch.
CURTIS (CONT'D)
I'm late.
SAMANTHA
You didn't eat anything?
Heading out.
CURTIS
It's okay.
Curtis is gone. Samantha looks at Hannah on the floor with
the dog.
12.
The main headquarters of Delta Agri-Pro is housed in a giant
metal building. A row of cheaply built, 70's style offices
with drop tile ceilings line the left of a large warehouse
that contains all manner of agricultural and construction
equipment. Tractors, backhoes, welding rigs, etc.
A GROUP OF MEN, many of which were represented at Gator's bar
yesterday, sit in folding chairs or stand in a semi-circle
around JIM THOMPSON(53). He speaks, clipboard in hand.
JIM
I didn't say you had control over
the weather Russell, what I did say
was that the top shelf has to be
cleared by the 15th. That's non-
negotiable.
Dewart eats from a bag of Sunflower seeds. Curtis stares
down at his forearm. He rubs the skin there. Jim runs a
finger down his clipboard.
JIM (CONT'D)
Umm, Curtis. Where we at on that
east 82nd site?
Curtis snaps his head up, takes a second.
CURTIS
Yesterday slowed us down. We
couldn't get the second pilot hole
drilled.
Jim drops his head and the clipboard falls to his side. A
melodramatic move.
JIM
It rained for two hours yesterday.
Two hours and our entire schedule
went in the toilet. We lose the
permit if you're not out of there
by end of day.
CURTIS
Yes sir.
JIM
End of day Curtis.
Curtis nods.
JIM (CONT'D)
All right. Valerie tells me that
the father son pancake cook off...
13.
Dewart stands by a flatbed cart with a prefab DOGHOUSE
sitting on it.
Curtis loads chain-link fencing materials onto the cart.
Curtis' work boots are encased in dry mud. Chunks have
broken off and pepper the thin blue industrial carpet. His
mud-stained fingers tap on the top of a desk. Dirt caked
under his nails.
TEACHER (O.S.)
So if you continue with the basic
vocabulary, this will allow you to
communicate with your children
better.
Curtis sits, filthy, at a school desk he doesn't quite fit
into. A TEACHER speaks to a ROOM FULL of PARENTS.
TEACHER (CONT'D)
Between the ages of four and seven
the focus is more on the sign and
then later we'll begin adding the
alphabet as more of a support
syster. Now in ASL...
Curtis looks over at Samantha, who is sitting in the desk
next to him. She won't look at him.
He cranes his neck around to see toward the back of the room.
An ASSISTANT TEACHER sits on a large, colorful rug with a
GROUP of CHILDREN, all different ages, playing games that
teach hand signs. Hannah actively participates in the group.
TEACHER (CONT'D)
...the male sign is signed at the
forehead area. For example, father
is signed up here like
this...Father, very good.
Curtis turns back in his chair and makes the sign for "dad"
along with the other parents.
Curtis, Samantha, and Hannah sit on the floor in a circle
atop the colored rug.
Samantha turns over large flashcards with illustrated scenes
on them. They take turns making the corresponding sign.
Curtis stares at Samantha, but she's still giving him the
cold shoulder. Finally, while holding up a card, she looks
at him. He signs, "I'm sorry". A fist moving in a circular
motion at his chest.
16.
SAMANTHA
You're not sorry.
CURTIS
I am sorry.
She looks to Hannah and signs, "swim".
SAMANTHA
Well, you stink. You smell really
bad.
He smiles.
CURTIS
I think I smell good.
She smiles, begrudgingly, and then signs to Hannah, "Dad" and
"stink". Curtis turns to some ladies behind him.
CURTIS (CONT'D)
Do I smell good?
Samantha laughs and tries to cover his mouth with her hand.
CURTIS (CONT'D)
See. Maybe I should marry her
instead.
They continue to laugh.
SAMANTHA
Stop.
Curtis slams the door to his truck, sealing him off from the
torrential rainfall outside.
He shakes water off, wipes his face. The windows are smeared
by thick, dark rain. It's hard to see out.
He looks over to Hannah sitting in her car seat. It looks
odd on the front bench of the truck. He signs to her.
CURTIS
(signing and speaking)
You okay?
She nods. He cranks the truck and turns on the wipers. The
liquid on the windshield streaks into long smudges. Curtis
leans forward to get a better view of the street. He checks
his blind spot and pulls away.
MOVING FAST ON A MAIN ROAD,
17.
Stop lights blur into hazy red and green spheres.
Curtis checks the rearview, but the back window is covered by
the rain. He tries rolling down his window, but water blows
in. He rolls it back up and the smudging gets worse.
The truck shimmies from left to right, pushed by the wind. A
THUNDER STRIKE rattles.
Suddenly,
THE SHAPE OF A PERSON STANDING IN THE ROAD.
CURTIS (CONT'D)
SHIT!
Curtis stomps on the brakes and turns the wheel. The truck
hydroplanes.
CRASH! Curtis' head busts against the steering column. The
front windshield cracks as the truck jerks to a stop.
The HISS of a broken radiator. Curtis winces from the blow
to his head. Hannah is crying. He reaches over to her.
CURTIS (CONT'D)
Are you okay?
Hannah physically looks all right, but she continues crying.
Curtis reaches out and places a hand on her head. He's
dazed, mumbling.
CURTIS (CONT'D)
You're okay.
The truck is angled up slightly like the front end has inched
up a pole. A cut on his forehead has begun to bleed.
He sees movement. A PERSON passes by the hazy side window.
A SHAPE moves past the driver's window.
The truck shifts as weight is added to the bed. The SOUND of
SOMEONE pulling things from the back of the truck. A moment.
WHACK! Curtis flinches as a 2X4 pounds the windshield.
The truck jostles from the weight of someone jumping on the
hood.
Bump. Bump.
The roof caves in with two FOOTSTEPS.
Curtis looks around frantically. He reaches over to Hannah
and begins to unstrap her from the car seat.
18.
SMASH! A BOARD breaks through the Passenger Window.
A WOMAN, pale and aggressive, stands in the rain storm
staring through the broken glass. She reaches for the lock.
Curtis pulls Hannah from the child seat and recoils against
his door but is jolted as another board CRASHES through the
driver's window.
A HAND yanks Curtis by his collar. He's pulled against the
door. A pasty forearm wraps around his neck, choking him.
He strains against the arm. Sucks air. Needing to breath.
The Woman at the passenger door grabs for Hannah. Curtis
kicks at her.
A MAN's boot KICKS OUT the back window. The Man in the bed
of the truck reaches for Curtis' face. He flails and kicks,
unable to break free from the forearm at his door.
The Woman gets hold of Hannah. The child is yanked from
Curtis' arms. He screams.
CURTIS (CONT'D)
Hannah! Hannah!
Hands claw at Curtis' face. Scratching. Blood streaks. The
Woman has disappeared into the storm with Hannah.
Curtis screams. Fingers swoop into his open mouth, grabbing
hold of his cheek. They pull the cheek back. TEARING.
He yells in pain.
Samantha walks down the hallway holding Hannah's shoes.
Hannah trails behind her.
SAMANTHA
Here honey. Put on your shoes
IN THE KITCHEN,
Samantha walks in. Curtis is standing at the counter in his
undershirt and boxers pouring a cup of coffee.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
Good, you're up.
Curtis doesn't turn to greet her. He just stirs a spoon in
the black coffee.
Samantha walks up to him and puts a hand on his back. She
notices that his shirt is soaked with sweat.
19.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
Honey, you're soaked.
He turns, taking a sip from the mug. She feels his forehead.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
Are you sick?
CURTIS
I've felt better.
SAMANTHA
I guess we could stay home if we
need to.
CURTIS
Where you goin'?
SAMANTHA
It's Saturday, I was going to take
Hannah to my booth.
CURTIS
Oh. Yeah.
Curtis walks to the table and takes a seat.
SAMANTHA
You look really sick honey.
CURTIS
I'm all right. It's just a cold or
somethin'.
SAMANTHA
Let me get you some Advil.
She heads for the hallway.
CURTIS
No. Don't worry about it. Ya'll
just go. I'll be fine.
SAMANTHA
You sure?
CURTIS
Yeah.
(holds up the mug)
Better already.
Samantha walks to her purse on the counter and roots through
to find a set of keys.
20.
SAMANTHA
Okay. I got my phone if you need
anything. Don't forget Sunday
lunch is here tomorrow.
This reminder makes Curtis rub his face with a grunt.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
If you're sick, we should cancel.
CURTIS
I'll be all right.
SAMANTHA
Okay, we'll talk later.
She heads for the door with Hannah.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
Come on. Let's go.
(TO CURTIS)
You sure?
CURTIS
Honey, please.
SAMANTHA
Okay.
Samantha scoops up her bag and takes Hannah by the hand. They
leave the room.
Curtis notices the dog, Red, sitting on his haunches looking
at him. Curtis stares back, sipping his coffee.
-A linen sheet floats down over a folding table.
-The hanging bag is placed on a portable clothes rod.
-Hands place an assortment of home sewn crafts like napkins
and embroidered pillows out onto the table.
-A tackle box is opened revealing a tray of small bills and
change. A calculator is removed.
Hannah kneels in front of a folding chair behind their BOOTH
at an open-air flea market. She uses the seat of the chair
as a table for a tiny porcelain tea set.
Samantha stands over her display table smiling and nodding at
perusing CUSTOMERS.
Samantha turns to see a large woman holding up an intricately
embroidered pillow.
You can tell by the look of her that she's a flea market pro,
a BARGAIN HUNTER(54).
BARGAIN HUNTER
How much you asking for this
pillow?
22.
SAMANTHA
This pillow's fifteen dollars.
BARGAIN HUNTER
That's more than I want to spend.
SAMANTHA
This is all hand stitched. It takes
a really long time. That's why I
charge that.
BARGAIN HUNTER
I'll give you seven for it.
Samantha looks at the woman, who is almost daring her.
SAMANTHA
I can't go that low.
BARGAIN HUNTER
Well that's my offer.
The woman sets down the pillow and begins looking over other
items on the table. Samantha bites the inside of her cheek.
She doesn't like to haggle.
SAMANTHA
How about 10?
The woman doesn't look up.
BARGAIN HUNTER
I'll give you eight, but it's in
change.
Samantha forces a smile and motions to Hannah.
SAMANTHA
That's fine.
The woman smiles and removes a Ziplock bag of assorted coins
from her purse. Hannah takes the bag.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
Lucky for you she likes to count
change.
Hannah opens the bag and begins to turn it over.
Coins splash across the kitchen counter. Curtis sets an
empty coffee can back on the shelf in front of him and begins
sifting through the change.
Odd screws, buttons, then he gets to what he's looking for.
A small set of brass keys on a matching ring. He grabs the
keys from the pile and exits.
It's pitch black inside. Curtis makes his way down the steps
and holds out the flashlight. An assortment of trash on the
ground, empty cans and water bottles, some candy wrappers.
The whole shelter is only about 6' X 8'. His head fits fine,
but he still ducks like he might bump it.
He shines the light on the back wall. A rotted, wooden bench
is bolted into the concrete there. Curtis walks to it and
takes a seat.
He's looking back toward the steps now. A shaft of light
cuts a strict beam through the open doors, lighting only the
concrete entry.
Curtis takes in the quiet of the concrete box. He leans his
head back on the wall and closes his eyes.
He shuts off his flashlight. Left in the dark, he takes a
deep breath. Exhales slowly.
NEWS ANCHOR
(ON TELEVISION)
While rescue workers made several
attempts to reach the family,
Walter Jacobs wife...
Curtis sits in his Lazyboy bent over a frozen dinner. He
watches the local news on TV. Samantha walks in with a glass
of milk and some Oreos, a magazine tucked under her arm.
Samantha takes a TIN down from the top of the fridge. It has
designs of starfish and other ocean creatures on it.
25.
She sets the tin on the counter next to the tackle box she
uses as a cash register and yells to Curtis in the den.
SAMANTHA
But that's what I don't understand.
If he didn't do anything why did
you put him out back?
Samantha counts out the money earned at the flea market. She
sets a portion aside and closes the tackle box. Curtis says
something, but it's inaudible.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
What?
She opens the tin and removes an envelope with the word
"BEACH" written on it in black sharpie. Samantha adds the
money to the envelope and puts up the jar. She opens the
fridge and takes out the milk.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
You hear me? I said if he didn't
do anything why did you have to put
him outside?
Curtis' attention is on the TV. Samantha sits on the couch.
CURTIS
I just wanted him to be outside for
awhile.
SAMANTHA
He's your dog. He's always been an
inside dog.
CURTIS
He's my dog, and that's why he's
outside. Right now with Hannah and
everything I just think it'd be
better.
SAMANTHA
Hannah loves Red.
CURTIS
Hold on.
Curtis stares at the television program. Samantha's eyes
narrow. Frustrated, she flips open her magazine.
NEWS ANCHOR
...the gas cloud spread across
their six acre property.
(MORE)
26.
NEWS ANCHOR (CONT'D)
The only way off their land was
across the train tracks which were
blocked by wreckage.
WALTER JACOBS
(from a hospital bed)
I tried using some wet rags and
towels to breathe through but that
just seemed to make it worse.
NEWS ANCHOR
While rescue workers made several
attempts to reach the family,
Walter Jacobs' wife and brother-in-
law died in the home. Jacobs
survived despite enduring eleven
hours of exposure to the gas cloud
before finally being flown out by
helicopter.
CURTIS
You hearin' this?
Her nose still in the magazine.
SAMANTHA
It's awful.
CURTIS
Eleven hours. No way out.
Samantha shakes her head. Curtis watches the footage of
Walter Jacobs. He watches his red rimmed eyes. The deep
lines in his face.
It's daytime, but the house feels dark from the storm blowing
outside. The SOUND of rain pelts the windows and roof.
Curtis, dressed for work, walks from his bedroom down the
hallway. He passes the den and stops at its entryway.
IN THE DEN,
Hannah sits on the couch with her back to him. She's on her
knees looking out one of the front windows.
A dull orange glow halos from the bank of windows. What
sunlight there is appears diffused by the dark, thick rain
smearing down the outside of the glass.
A THUNDER STRIKE.
27.
Curtis flinches. He shows concern as heavier rain begins
battering the house. The wind picks up making wood beams
creak on their foundation.
CURTIS
Hannah.
Hannah doesn't move. She continues staring out the window.
The SOUND of the storm outside intensifies. Windows begin to
rattle in their frames.
Curtis walks over and reaches for Hannah but is startled by
the sight of a MAN'S FACE just outside the window. Hannah
and the Man have been staring at one another.
The Man, hollow eyed and pale, moves out of the window and
out of sight.
CURTIS (CONT'D)
Hey!
Thunder CRACKS overhead. Curtis scoops Hannah into his arms
and heads out of the room.
BANG. The front door rattles. Curtis stops and turns back.
BANG. BANG. The SOUND of someone kicking at the front door.
The storm outside has grown to a deafening pitch.
The power goes out.
The entire house vibrates, like a freight train running
across the roof. The BANGING at the front door continues,
frame giving way, as the STORM reaches its apex.
Curtis, holding Hannah, kneels and braces himself in the
entryway to the den. He covers the back of Hannah's head
with his hands and squeezes her tight into his shoulder.
Then Silence. A stillness.
The rain stops. No more banging at the front door. The SUN
moves brightly though the front windows.
WOOSH.
The furniture in the den lifts off the ground. A couch,
Lazyboy, coffee table and lamp. It all hangs in the air,
floating for a moment. Quietly.
Curtis watches, eyes wide. A rumbling. Grows. The SUNLIGHT
vanishes.
SMASH! The sound of the storm is sucked back into the room as
the furniture crashes to the floor, breaking apart on impact.
28.
The windows BLOW OUT.
Curtis squeezes his eyes shut and pivots his body, trying to
protect Hannah. Shards of glass splinter across his face.
Curtis gasps for air. It doesn't come.
Gasp. He's sucking for a breath. Hyperventilating.
He rises up in bed, gasping. His face flushed and head
soaked in sweat. His eyes dart around the room, frantically
searching his surroundings.
One more gasp, and air enters his lungs. He coughs. More
air. Long, deep breaths. He's calming down.
His breathing comes under control. His attention turns to
something else. Something under the sheets.
Curtis pulls back the bed sheets. The mattress is soaked in
YELLOW urine. This scares him.
His hand trembles as he reaches out to touch his wet boxers.
The toilet FLUSHES. Footsteps in heels.
Curtis quickly pulls the covers back up. Samantha enters the
bedroom. She pulls her hair into a tight ponytail and picks
earrings off a nearby dresser, her back to Curtis.
CURTIS
Babe?
SAMANTHA
Yeah?
CURTIS
You got the number for Dr. Shannan?
She turns.
SAMANTHA
You're still not feeling good?
CURTIS
Yeah, but you got the number?
SAMANTHA
Uh, yeah baby but he'll be closed
today.
She approaches the bed and he holds his hand out.
29.
CURTIS
Right. Yeah. I'll call tomorrow.
SAMANTHA
Honey if you're not feeling good we
take you in somewhere.
She walks closer to the bed.
CURTIS
No. Stop!
She's taken aback.
SAMANTHA
Okay. Do you want me to cancel
lunch today...
CURTIS
Shit...
SAMANTHA
What is that?
CURTIS
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just I
got a sore throat. I'm sorry I'm
taking it out on you.
SAMANTHA
I was gonna leave Hannah with you
so I could go to church, but I'm
not going to with you like this.
CURTIS
It's fine. I'll be fine.
SAMANTHA
No. She needs breakfast.
CURTIS
(STERN)
I've got it.
SAMANTHA
I'm sorry that you feel bad but you
need to drop the attitude.
CURTIS
Come on. Just go.
SAMANTHA
What's wrong with you?
CURTIS
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Just go.
30.
SAMANTHA
Hannah's in the den. We have
cereal for her.
Samantha stomps out of the room. Curtis sighs. He halfway
lifts the sheet then lets it fall again.
Curtis strips the sheets off the bed.
The laundry room is a stackable set squeezed into a closet
off the hallway.
Curtis loads the sheets into the washer and presses start.
Watching the clothes spin, a thought.
Curtis pushes Hannah's shoe onto her foot. He stops with the
shoes to concentrate. He moves his index finger from one
shoulder to the other and speaks.
CURTIS
We're going out.
Confused, she slices her finger down an open palm.
CURTIS (CONT'D)
(with open palms)
We're going out. Okay? It's okay.
Curtis holds the glass front door open for Hannah. They stop
in the entryway and survey the LIBRARY.
There are only a few people, one of which is the LIBRARIAN
sitting behind a central desk. It is an open room with
cinder block walls painted in brightly colored shapes.
31.
Curtis finds the children's section to the left and leads
Hannah over. She takes a seat at a kid's size table as
Curtis grabs a Dinosaur book from a nearby display.
Kneeling in front of her, Curtis shows her the book and
motions with open hands to the ground.
CURTIS
You stay put okay?
Hannah begins looking through the book. Curtis stands, he
sees a set of computers under a sign reading, "CATALOGUE".
AT THE COMPUTERS,
Curtis takes a seat in front of one of the two computers set
up on a folding table. He eyes the search screen. Title,
Author, Subject.
He clicks on "Subject" and types the word "DREAMS". He
scrolls through a list of titles and writes down a number.
He looks back for Hannah. She's still flipping through her
book. No one else is around.
He begins another search. He types "MENTAL ILLNESS".
AT THE BOOK SHELVES,
Curtis scans the spines looking for his title. He already
holds two books against his chest.
He pulls out a thick hard cover book. The title reads,
"Understanding Mental Illness."
I/E. CURTIS' TRUCK/GRAFTON STREETS - MOVING - DAY
Hannah is once again strapped into her car seat. She holds a
big children's book in her hands.
They pass a Grocery Store. Curtis turns as it goes by.
The truck pulls a U-turn in the street and heads for the
store parking lot.
Curtis pushes a cart down the aisle. Hannah rides in the
fold down metal seat.
They stop at the bottled water section. Curtis loads several
plastic, gallon jugs of water into his cart.
The cart is filled with an assortment of supplies:
Batteries, canned food, first aid supplies, matches.
32.
Samantha sits in the dining room at a fully dressed table.
Steam rises off bowls of mashed potatoes and green beans.
Fried chicken piled on a platter.
MELVIN(58) taps his finger on the empty plate in front of him
and subtly checks his watch. JANINE(57) smooths out the
embroidered table cloth.
KATHRYN(37) and CHARLIE(39) tend to their child, REX(3). Rex
repeatedly jams a finger into the potatoes.
SAMANTHA
Let's just start.
MELVIN
Let's all join hands for the
blessing.
The SOUND of the front door opening. Samantha gets up and
leaves the room.
BY THE FRONT DOOR,
Curtis has Hannah in his arms. He closes the door. Samantha
appears behind them. She speaks in a hushed, angry voice.
SAMANTHA
Where the hell have you been?
CURTIS
I know. I'm sorry. I had to run an
errand.
SAMANTHA
You're really late.
CURTIS
I know.
SAMANTHA
You didn't even bring your cell
phone.
Samantha heads back to the dining room. Curtis sucks his
teeth.
Potatoes dalloped, chicken passed, the table is active with
the family serving and eating. Curtis watches it all,
somehow separated from it. He's exhausted.
33.
MELVIN
Missed you at church this mornin'
Curtis.
SAMANTHA
Dad.
MELVIN
He knows what to do if he wants me
to stop askin'.
Curtis looks at him.
CURTIS
Was it a good service?
MELVIN
It was. It was good work.
Curtis nods. The family in front of him eats the meal.
CURTIS
I'm thinking about cleaning up that
storm shelter out back.
They look at him.
Light from the open closet door cuts a shape in the
relatively dark hallway.
Curtis roots through the back of the closet.
-Curtis sweeps the concrete floor of the storm shelter. A
Coleman camping lantern sits on the wooden bench attached to
the back wall. It casts an odd light up into the room.
-Curtis places cans of food onto metal shelves.
-Curtis flips through keys on his key ring. He adds the two
small padlock keys to the ring.
Samantha sits on the bed in her pajamas applying lotion to
her legs. She wipes the remainder on her knuckles and looks
at the empty spot on Curtis' side of the bed.
34.
Samantha walks into the kitchen and turns off the overhead
light. She pauses, seeing something in the backyard.
She stops at the back door and stares out at the storm
shelter. The camp lantern's orange light glows through the
open metal doors.
She watches for a moment.
The shelter has been cleaned up. The metal shelves hold
canned food, water jugs and first aid supplies. Blankets and
pillows are stacked on the other side of the room.
Curtis sits in the back corner of the shelter on the wooden
bench. He flips through one of the books from the library.
The cover reads, "DREAM ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION". The
book on mental illness sits by his feet.
The Doctor's Office is a converted one-story residential
house. Curtis slouches in a faux leather chair grouped in
the small reception area. He has nodded off.
His head snaps up. He sucks air through his nose and sits up
in his chair. He sees a WOMAN(25) reading a children's book
aloud to her DAUGHTER(3) on a colorful rug in the corner.
A door opens and a NURSE with a clipboard steps out.
NURSE
Curtis?
Curtis stands and follows the nurse out of the room.
Curtis sits, fully clothed, on the edge of a paper covered
bench in the exam room. DOCTOR SHANNAN, an older man with a
smoker's voice, enters smiling and gives a firm handshake.
DOCTOR SHANNAN
Curtis, how you doin' bud?
CURTIS
Hey Doc.
DOCTOR SHANNAN
How's my girl?
35.
The Doctor turns to a small table in the corner and grabs a
wooden tongue depressor and an otoscope from a drawer.
CURTIS
She's good.
DOCTOR SHANNAN
That's good to hear. Tilt your
head back for me.
The Doctor shines the otoscope into his nostrils.
CURTIS
I don't have a cold.
The Doctor pauses and turns to check a chart on the table.
DOCTOR SHANNAN
Oh. Did she get that down wrong?
CURTIS
No, I just told her that.
DOCTOR SHANNAN
Oh. So what's the problem?
CURTIS
I've been havin'...I've been having
some trouble sleepin'. I was
hopin' you could give me somethin'
for it.
Doctor Shannan takes a seat on a rolling stool and processes
the request.
DOCTOR SHANNAN
How long's this been goin' on?
CURTIS
`Bout four nights now.
DOCTOR SHANNAN
You're not sleepin' at all?
CURTIS
Well some, but real restless.
DOCTOR SHANNAN
Well, I think four nights is a
little too soon to tell. My advice
would be to not eat or drink
anything after 8 o'clock at night.
Cut back on any alcoholic drinks,
tobacco, caffeine...get some daily
exercise.
36.
CURTIS
Well, I think...
Curtis isn't sure how much he wants to say.
CURTIS (CONT'D)
I think I may need to try some
medication.
DOCTOR SHANNAN
Why do you say that?
CURTIS
(STILL RELUCTANT)
The reason I've been having trouble
sleeping is because of some dreams
I've been havin'. I didn't think
it was anything at first, but then
the other day I woke up and the bed
was wet.
DOCTOR SHANNAN
You urinated in your bed?
CURTIS
Yeah. Couple days before that I
had a dream that my dog attacked me
and it took all day for the pain in
my arm to go away.
Doctor Shannan leans his back against the table and thinks
about this.
DOCTOR SHANNAN
You been to see your mother lately?
He swivels the stool around and writes on a prescription pad.
CURTIS
It's been about a month.
He tears two sheets off and holds the first out to Curtis.
DOCTOR SHANNAN
Okay. This is a prescription for a
pretty mild sedative. It's non-
habit forming, but I'm only giving
you enough for a few days anyway.
Take it and see if it helps. In
the meantime,
(holds up the other slip)
This is the number of a good friend
of mine in Columbus. He's a
psychiatrist. It's a drive, but
he's the best I know.
37.
CURTIS
Okay.
DOCTOR SHANNAN
I'll give him a call and let him
know you'll be down to see him.
CURTIS
All right.
An INSURANCE AGENT(62) sits behind her desk with the phone to
her ear. She's an older woman wearing a pant suit.
Samantha sits by a fake plant and sips a Coke. She watches
Hannah play with building blocks from a plastic tub provided
by the office.
INSURANCE AGENT
(into the phone)
No. Look it. I've told you this
twice. Please. Just get me the name
and or the approval code.
(BEAT)
Okay.
The Agent writes something down.
INSURANCE AGENT (CONT'D)
(into the phone)
All right. And the phone. Well
great. Thank you very much.
The Agent hangs up the phone and rips a piece of paper from
the pad in front of her. She hands it to Samantha.
INSURANCE AGENT (CONT'D)
This is the name and number of the
specialist who the insurance
company approves of. Just call and
make an appointment. Now if this
doctor signs off , you should have
the implant procedure fully
covered. I'm sorry it took so
long.
Samantha looks at the paper, impressed.
SAMANTHA
Can I give you a hug?
39.
INSURANCE AGENT
It's fine. It's fine. You know
your husband's company actually has
very good insurance when it kicks
in. Not a lot of jobs offer
policies half as good. You're very
lucky.
Curtis stands in line at the pharmacy located in the back
corner of the grocery store. He approaches the counter and
hands over his prescription to a female PHARMACIST.
She disappears behind a divider as Curtis removes his wallet.
He takes out an insurance card and runs his thumb over the
bills.
The Pharmacist returns with a stapled white bag. Curtis
holds out the insurance card.
PHARMACIST
That's okay. We have your
insurance on file. That'll be
$47.64.
CURTIS
What's the co-pay?
PHARMACIST
That is your co-pay.
Curtis studies the small paper sack and removes three, 20
dollar bills from his wallet.
Curtis enters the front door, closing it behind him. He
turns and is met by Samantha, who wraps her arms around him.
CURTIS
Hey.
She squeezes him. Then kisses him.
SAMANTHA
I love you.
CURTIS
I love you too.
SAMANTHA
I have good news.
40.
Curtis finishes off a dinner of roast and potatoes. Samantha
sets the piece of paper the Insurance Agent gave her in front
of him and begins clearing the table.
Hannah draws on a piece of construction paper at the other
end of the table. Samantha picks up a crayon and shows it to
Hannah.
SAMANTHA
Green? How `bout a red?
She pretends to use the crayon as lipstick.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
It was like talking to a sane
person for once. She made one
phone call. That's it. I've been
trying that 800 number for weeks.
CURTIS
It's great. It's great.
(TO HANNAH)
Hey, Hannah.
Hannah doesn't look up. He stands and goes over to her.
Touches her shoulder and kneels beside her.
CURTIS (CONT'D)
You excited? Huh? We're gonna get
you some help.
Curtis touches his finger to her chest then stops. He can't
think of the sign. He turns to Samantha.
CURTIS (CONT'D)
How do you say...sign excited?
SAMANTHA
Like this.
Samantha shows him the sign. Curtis mimics.
CURTIS
Excited. Yeah?
Hannah nods. He kisses her on the forehead. He picks up a
crayon and holds it up to her lips like lipstick.
CURTIS (CONT'D)
Now I got to do you.
41.
Samantha lies under the covers looking at a real estate
magazine. Curtis takes off his clothes by the dresser. He
subtly removes a prescription bottle from his pants pocket
and cups it in his palm.
SAMANTHA
Oh, honey. Look at this one. It's
a 2-1 and it sits directly on the
beach. Wouldn't that be great? We
wouldn't have to worry about Hannah
crossing traffic.
Curtis walks over and leans in to see the page. They are
rental photos of beach condos.
CURTIS
What's the rent?
SAMANTHA
Eight ninety nine a week.
CURTIS
That sounds real nice.
Samantha keeps flipping through the magazine as Curtis heads
to the bathroom.
Curtis turns the water on in the sink and shakes two pills
from the orange bottle. He stuffs them in his mouth and
chases it with water from the faucet.
Curtis looks at himself in the mirror for a moment before
cutting out the light.
A crack in the ceiling slowly comes into focus.
Curtis sits up in bed, rubbing his eyes. He looks around the
room. He hears Samantha in the kitchen.
He takes a deep breath, smelling the breakfast cooking.
Curtis smiles.
Curtis sits at the kitchen table as Samantha dishes up some
eggs.
42.
SAMANTHA
You sleep well?
CURTIS
Yeah. I did.
SAMANTHA
You look like you're feeling
better.
Curtis nods and eats his breakfast.
Curtis stands by the door for apartment 212 in an interior
carpeted hallway. He knocks.
45.
A passing ATTENDANT guides an elderly WOMAN down the hallway.
Curtis nods to them.
The door opens. SARAH(61), a plainly dressed woman much too
young to live in a nursing home, looks surprised.
SARAH
Curtis.
CURTIS
Hey Mom.
Her eyes light up and she wraps her arms around Curtis.
SARAH
Come in.
CURTIS
Sure.
She leads him inside.
The apartment is small, but nicely kept. Not much furniture
or personal trappings. Framed family photos mostly.
CURTIS
I'm going to get some water.
He fills his glass at the sink. Takes a sip.
CURTIS (CONT'D)
You want some?
SARAH
No.
Curtis enters the living area as Sarah stops in the
kitchenette.
Sarah runs her fingers around the bent edges of a small photo
of Hannah.
SARAH
Isn't she lovely.
Curtis drops his head. He looks uncomfortable.
CURTIS
Mom?
46.
SARAH
Yes.
CURTIS
I need to ask you somethin'.
She looks at him. Totally open.
CURTIS (CONT'D)
Do you remember what year we
brought you up here? To the first
place.
She has to think about it.
CURTIS (CONT'D)
It was `86.
SARAH
Yes. Because Kyle was going to be a
senior.
CURTIS
I was 10.
SARAH
Yes.
Curtis nods.
CURTIS
Can you remember what happened
before you got diagnosed?
SARAH
What do you mean?
CURTIS
I mean...I just want to know how it
all started. Before you had to
leave.
Sarah settles in her chair, understanding the question.
SARAH
Oh, I don't know. I remember it
was a real stressful time. Your
father was gone a lot, and I
couldn't handle things on my own.
CURTIS
Did you ever have any dreams? Like
bad dreams.
SARAH
No. Nothing like that. There was
always...
(MORE)
47.
SARAH (CONT'D)
(searches for the words)
There was always a panic that took
hold of me. I thought people were
watching me or listening to me.
I...
Sarah is remembering. Her face draws tight, frustrated.
CURTIS
It's all right. It's all right.
It's fine.
Sarah looks up and smiles. Her focus shifts back to her son.
SARAH
Are you okay?
CURTIS
Yeah. Yeah. I'm fine.
Sarah looks back down to Hannah's photo.
Curtis steps quietly into the bedroom. The lights are on,
but Samantha has fallen asleep on top of the made bed.
He empties his pockets on the dresser and Samantha wakes up.
SAMANTHA
Hey.
CURTIS
Oh, hey. Sorry I woke you up.
SAMANTHA
It's okay. Where you been?
CURTIS
I went to see mom.
Samantha sits up in the bed.
SAMANTHA
Is she okay?
CURTIS
Mmm hmm. I just wanted to check up
on her.
SAMANTHA
You shoulda told me we would have
gone with you.
CURTIS
That's okay.
Samantha lays back down, tucking herself under the covers.
SAMANTHA
Come to bed.
CURTIS
I will in a bit.
Curtis finishes emptying his pockets.
Hannah sleeps soundly in her bed. Curtis stands at the door
watching her. He walks over and takes a seat on the edge of
the bed. He listens to her breath.
The house is quiet and the den is lit by a single lamp.
Curtis sits alone on the couch, hunched over the coffee
table. He writes on a yellow legal pad. It's a list with
the heading, "REMODEL". It reads:
-Shipping Container, $1,800
-PVC, $475
-Plumbing and waste, $1,650
-Bobcat, $1,750
-Jackhammer with pneumatics, $800
-Sealant, $150
-Dirt, -$250
At the bottom of the list, Curtis writes the figure, "$7,500"
and circles it.
He studies the number, then begins drawing a rectangular
diagram below it.
Curtis blows into a Styrofoam cup and stares through the
blinds of an office window. Outside, a flag snaps at the top
of a pole next to the FIRST NATIONAL BANK sign.
He looks down at a NEWSPAPER laid out on an end table next to
him. He flips it over and studies the ads on the back. A
big one in the corner catches his eye.
It reads, "CUYAHOGA GUN AND KNIFE SHOW!" The ad lists items
for sell/trade: ...Tactical Gear, Gas Masks, Batons...
Curtis focuses in on the words "Gas Masks" and tears the ad
out. JOHN MYERS(34) enters with a set of papers in his hand.
Curtis quickly tucks the ad into his back pocket.
Myers takes a seat in one of two chairs in front of his desk
and looks over the papers. He takes a pen out of his pocket
as Curtis sits down next to him.
MYERS
Well you've kept up with the
payments on the house.
50.
CURTIS
We've been good about that.
Myers nods, but he carries a look of concern. He confides.
MYERS
I gotta tell you Curtis, banks
aren't loaning money the way they
used to. We've got you a loan
today, but the interest rates are
variable and we have to tie it to
your house.
CURTIS
That's fine.
Myers sits back, drawing the pen to his lips and tapping it.
MYERS
Curtis, I've known you a long time.
We financed your house for you, two
vehicles. I'm telling you this is
a risky loan you're taking.
CURTIS
I need the money John.
Myers nods, then leans forward and clicks the pen.
MYERS
Okay.
Curtis sits in the lobby filling out a clipboard full of
forms and questionnaires. Light traffic flows in and out.
He flips a page over. The section heading reads, "Family
Medical History". Curtis begins to write.
53.
Curtis references a slip of paper as he looks for a room
number in a long, linoleum tiled hallway; a book and note pad
tucked under his arm.
He finds the correct door ajar and knocks.
KENDRA (O.S.)
Come in.
KENDRA(42), a black woman with short hair, sits behind a
public issue desk in a public issue office. A poster about
flu shots hangs on the wall. There is no personal decor.
KENDRA
Hi.
CURTIS
Hello.
She half stands and offers a hand.
KENDRA
Have a seat. I'm Kendra.
CURTIS
Curtis.
Curtis shakes and they sit. Kendra opens a manila folder.
KENDRA
I'm gonna start by askin' you some
questions.
CURTIS
Okay. I already answered all the
questions on the forms.
KENDRA
Yeah, I know. I looked at `em, but
I need to get a profile started on
you.
CURTIS
Right. Well...
Curtis slides the yellow legal pad out of the book he
brought. It's the library book on Mental Illness.
CURTIS (CONT'D)
Out of the five possible symptoms
needed to be diagnosed with
SCHIZOPHRENIA:
(MORE)
54.
CURTIS (CONT'D)
(reads off the pad)
delusions, hallucinations,
disorganized speech, disorganized
behavior, and the negative
symptoms, I've had two. Delusions
and hallucinations. But they say
it has to continue for six months
to be diagnosed schizophrenia and
mine hasn't been goin' on anywhere
near that long. So, I took this
quiz in the back of the book and I
scored a five out of a possible
twenty. Schizophrenia starts at
twelve. So, they say it might be
a...
(reads off the pad)
brief psychotic disorder. Whatever
it is, I need to know what to do or
what to get on to get this thing
under control.
Kendra stares at him.
KENDRA
Look. I'm a counselor. Certified,
but I'm not a psychiatrist. I
can't prescribe anything to you. I
can talk to you, I can recommend
where to send you, but that's it.
Curtis begins to gather his things.
KENDRA (CONT'D)
Now that said, if you want to talk,
I'll listen. For a lot of people
that's a good start.
Curtis hesitates.
KENDRA (CONT'D)
Now you said here that your mother
was diagnosed with paranoid
schizophrenia in her thirties. And
you're at 35. You wanna talk about
that?
Curtis settles in his seat. Sets his book on the floor.
CURTIS
Yeah, I don't know my mother's
symptoms. I was just 10. My
brother was 17. And, uh...I don't
know. She just left me in the car
in the parking lot at the grocery
store one day. And she didn't come
back. And then they found her a
week later eatin' trash out of a
dumpster in northern Kentucky.
(MORE)
55.
CURTIS (CONT'D)
My dad had to put her in the state
hospital in Columbus. And she's
been in assisted living ever since.
Yep. My dad raised me. He died
last April.
Kendra nods, a pleasant look on her face.
KENDRA
So tell me `bout these dreams.
Curtis studies her face, bites at the inside of his cheek.
The class has finished. PARENTS and KIDS trickle out.
Samantha stands off to the side speaking with the Teacher.
SAMANTHA
I don't know what our schedule will
be, but...
TEACHER
That's all right. But I really do
think you should continue with the
sign language. And any additional
therapies that kids need for the
cochlear implant.
SAMANTHA
Absolutely.
TEACHER
Okay. Good night.
SAMANTHA
Good night.
As Samantha talks to the Teacher, Curtis looks over
flashcards with Hannah. He signs "SUNSHINE", a circle in the
sky with the hand then coming down, fingers spread.
I/E. SAMANTHA'S CAR/INTERSTATE - NIGHT
Curtis drives while Samantha and Hannah sleep in the back.
Surrounding farmland drops quickly into darkness joining a
purple sky in the distance. Through the passenger window, a
streak of lightning breaks across the horizon. Then another.
Curtis, seeing this, repositions to get a better look through
the window. It's horizontal lightning that appears to leap
from cloud to cloud. Well defined bolts that strobe the
night sky silhouetting towering thunderheads.
56.
Curtis looks back to Samantha and Hannah, still asleep.
He pulls the car over to the shoulder of the interstate and
continues watching. He climbs out.
ON THE SHOULDER OF THE INTERSTATE,
Cars rush by as Curtis gently closes the car door. Keeping
his eyes on the lightning storm, he walks to the shoulder.
It's a fantastic display of light. Hurried and intense. A
BOLT of lightning reaches down to the ground. Sparks pop off
the earth in the distance. Another BOLT streaks down,
getting closer.
Curtis sees the traffic continuing to pass by at full speed.
CURTIS
(TO HIMSELF)
Is anyone seeing this?
Curtis walks to the back window of the car and sees Samantha
sleeping inside. He reaches out to knock but stops himself.
He turns back to the lightning and watches.
The giant rolling door curls up in the Delta Agri-Pro
warehouse. Sunlight bounces off the finished concrete.
Curtis pulls the chain for the door as Dewart slams the tow
latch down on the back of a DUMP TRUCK.
I/E. FLEA MARKET/LAFORCHE HOME - SERIES OF IMAGES - DAY
-The Dump Truck and Tow Trailer sit parked on the street in
front of Curtis' house. Dewart stands at the back of the
trailer with his hand on the ramp lever as Curtis reverses a
BACKHOE onto the street.
-Samantha works her booth at the flea market. Hannah neatly
organizes a collection of colored beads on the floor.
-A 20 foot rectangle has been outlined in bright orange paint
next to the storm shelter in Curtis' backyard. Other colored
markings denote gas and water lines. The bucket on the
Backhoe digs into the center of the dotted rectangle.
-Dewart maneuvers the Backhoe's bucket and drops a load of
earth into the bed of the Dump Truck. Red, the dog, barks at
the loud machinery from his pen.
57.
-Curtis uses a smaller trench digging machine on the backside
of the yard, radiating out from the main dig site. He
notices a NEIGHBOR watching him from they yard next door.
-Samantha tallies cash from the tackle box she uses as a
register. Hannah counts out the change.
-Dewart assembles a series of PVC pipe next to the trenches
Curtis dug.
-Curtis, work goggles on, stands in a head deep hole holding
a pneumatic jack hammer up to the exposed exterior wall of
the storm shelter. He begins hammering.
Hannah watches television in the den by herself.
IN THE BEDROOM,
Samantha sits on the edge of the bed. Curtis stands a few
paces back. His hands dug into the back of his dusty jeans.
SAMANTHA
Not a word. You didn't say one
word about this to me. Don't you
think you owe me that? Don't you
think that you might respect me
enough to at least consider what I
had to say?
CURTIS
I didn't want you worryin' about
it.
SAMANTHA
Well I'm worried Curtis. How are
you paying for all that?
CURTIS
I got a home improvement loan from
the bank.
Samantha is stunned. She stands and gets in his face.
SAMANTHA
How could you do that without
talking to me? You know the
expenses we have comin' up. You
want to waste money on a stupid
tornado shelter?
CURTIS
I'm doin' it...I'm doin' it for us.
I know you don't understand.
SAMANTHA
You're right. I don't understand.
I don't understand half the stuff
you've been doin' lately. I don't
understand you puttin' Red out
back. I don't understand you
stayin' up all night in that stupid
tornado shelter. You don't come to
bed half the time. You leave and
don't tell me where you're goin'.
Explain that to me. Please. Tell
me something that helps me
understand why you're bein' like
this.
59.
Curtis can't look at her. He tries to find words but fails.
CURTIS
There's nothin' to explain.
Samantha stares at his face, searching for an answer. She's
on the verge of tears.
CURTIS (CONT'D)
I'm gonna go put Hannah to bed.
Curtis walks out of the room. Samantha can't hold back,
tears run down her face.
Curtis stares at himself in the mirror. He opens the bottle
of prescription pills and shakes out two. Looks at them.
Shakes out another three. He pops the pills in his mouth and
drinks from the faucet.
It's dark and quiet in the house. Samantha sleeps on her
side, her back to Curtis.
Her head is jostled. More. The bed begins to vibrate. Her
eyes open. She turns over to see Curtis.
He's having a SEIZURE.
Samantha reaches for him. Eyes closed, his body convulses
violently. Samantha quickly turns on a bedside lamp.
SAMANTHA
Curtis!
She touches his arms. A small amount of BLOOD begins to
trickle from both sides of his mouth.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
Baby. Oh, my God. Baby...Oh, my
God. Baby.
Samantha jumps off the bed and grabs a cordless phone on the
dresser. She dials, watching her husband continue to shake.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
I need an ambulance! My husband's
having a seizure. 41800 Tindale
Road. Hurry up. He's bleeding!
Samantha goes over to him. Holding her hands out, cautious
to touch him.
60.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
(into the phone)
Okay. Okay.
Samantha puts the phone receiver down on the nightstand. The
Operator's VOICE still coming through. She touches his arm.
Suddenly, the seizures stop. Curtis' body is still.
Samantha freezes.
His eyes open and he thrashes up in bed. Samantha jumps,
tripping and stumbling backward.
Curtis sucks short breaths into his lungs. His head darts
back and forth, eyes wild. He sees Samantha staring up at
him from the floor. He begins to calm down.
Curtis touches his mouth. Sees the blood there.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
Honey?
Samantha stands up and goes over to him. She sits on the
edge of the bed and touches his arm. She's scared.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
Honey? Are you okay?
Curtis slowly nods.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
You were having a seizure. I
called an ambulance.
Curtis sees the phone on the nightstand and grabs it.
CURTIS
(into the phone)
No. It's fine. It's fine. Don't
send an ambulance. It's fine.
Curtis clicks off the phone.
SAMANTHA
What are you doing?
Curtis wraps his arms around her. He holds her tight. The
SOUND of ambulance sirens approach from the distance.
Samantha speaks, her voice trembling.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
Baby what's goin' on?
61.
Curtis turns up a bottle of peroxide and swishes it in his
mouth. It burns. He spits into the kitchen sink.
Samantha sits at the table watching him. Concerned, scared.
She holds a balled up tissue in her hand. Curtis takes a
seat across the table. She waits for him to say something.
CURTIS
I haven't been honest with you.
I'm sorry.
SAMANTHA
What's goin' on?
CURTIS
I've been havin' these dreams. I
guess they're more like nightmares.
It's why I've been actin' like
this.
Samantha listens with a furrowed brow.
CURTIS (CONT'D)
They always start with a kind of
storm. Like a real powerful storm.
(MORE)
62.
CURTIS (CONT'D)
And there's always this dark, thick
rain. Like fresh motor oil. And
then the things, people, it just
makes `em crazy. They attack me.
Sometimes they go after Hannah.
First one I had Red nearly chewed
through my arm.
SAMANTHA
That's why you put him out back?
CURTIS
Yeah.
SAMANTHA
What was the dream? Tonight.
CURTIS
It was Dewart. We were at the job
site. The storm started and
somethin' happened. His face. His
eyes were different. He came after
me with a pick ax. And we fought.
And he ran it through my leg.
Curtis zones out for a moment. Samantha says nothing.
CURTIS (CONT'D)
It's hard to explain, because it's
not just a dream. It's a feeling.
I'm afraid something might be
comin'. Something that's...not
right. I can not describe it. I
just need you to believe me.
Samantha's eyes are red. Her nose. She nods slightly and
dabs the tissue at the corner of her eye.
CURTIS (CONT'D)
I've been to a counselor. I've
seen her a few times.
This makes Samantha look up.
CURTIS (CONT'D)
You know what I come from. And I
promised myself...I promised myself
I would never leave. And I am
doin' everything that I can to make
that true.
The room is quiet. Samantha watches her husband.
63.
Hannah lies flat as the sled moves her through the oval CT
scanner. A red, lighted crosshair passes over her face.
Samantha has Hannah on her lap. She and Curtis listen
intently to an ATTENDANT who sits next to them with a file.
ATTENDANT
Since the doctor's approved her for
surgery, We just need to get her
scheduled. The next possible
opening is...
(reviews a calendar)
The 21st of next month. That's six
weeks.
CURTIS
Six weeks?
ATTENDANT
Is that okay?
SAMANTHA
It's wonderful.
Jim fills out paperwork at his desk. There is a KNOCK.
JIM
Come in.
Curtis walks inside. He stands in front of the desk.
JIM (CONT'D)
What you need Curtis?
CURTIS
I need a favor Jim.
JIM
What's that?
CURTIS
Can you take Dewart off my crew?
Just reassign him someplace else.
Jim sets his pen down and leans back.
JIM
What's the trouble? He not pullin'
his weight?
CURTIS
No, nothin' like that. He's a good
worker. He's a good man. He's my
friend. I think it'd be easier not
being in charge of someone I'm so
close to.
Jim nods.
JIM
You know, I understand. This is
part of what it means to manage
people Curtis. You're gonna have
to learn that.
65.
CURTIS
Yes sir. I appreciate that but...
well it would just be very helpful
in this case.
JIM
Okay. Well, I can put him with
Russell. Anybody else you prefer?
CURTIS
No. Whoever you think's right.
JIM
Okay.
CURTIS
Thank you.
Curtis turns to leave the office.
JIM
You been missin' a lotta work
Curtis.
CURTIS
I know. My daughter's had a lot of
doctor's visits. I haven't let
anything get behind.
JIM
No. But don't. Okay.
CURTIS
Yessir.
Curtis shows himself out.
Nat and Samantha sit at the kitchen table going over a list
of food in a note pad.
SAMANTHA
I know they just usually do oysters
and fries but what if we did
something healthier on the side?
66.
NAT
What like slaw?
Nat gets up to refill her drink. She looks out the back door
and surveys the construction zone. A FORKLIFT lowers the
Shipping Container into the giant hole in the backyard. Nat
shakes her head.
SAMANTHA
I don't know. Maybe a vegetable or
salad.
NAT
Dewart's been tellin' me how
strange Curtis has been actin'
lately. I am so sorry.
Nat brings her drink back to the table and sits. Samantha
doesn't look up from her pad.
NAT (CONT'D)
It's not like you don't have enough
on your plate with Hannah.
Nat puts her hand on Samantha's. Samantha moves it.
SAMANTHA
Things are fine. We're fine.
Nat smiles sympathetically.
Curtis meanders inside. He sees police tactical and survival
gear behind the counter. Chief among them is a collection of
gas masks hanging on the rear partition.
OWNER
Can I help you?
CURTIS
Yeah. Can I look at one of these
gas masks?
OWNER
Sure. Which one you want to look
at?
CURTIS
The newest one.
The OWNER of the store removes a mask and hands it to him.
Curtis fiddles with the mask.
67.
CURTIS (CONT'D)
How much?
OWNER
One seventy eight.
Curtis frowns at the price.
CURTIS
Anything cheaper?
OWNER
No. That's the cheapest one I got
in the store. They go all the way
up to two ninety. I don't know what
you want to spend but a gas mask
ain't something you want to go
cheap on.
CURTIS
You got any kids sizes?
OWNER
No. Kids can't wear those. They got
a have a special thing, its like a
hood. I don't fool with those.
Curtis nods. The perusing Shopper listens in.
CURTIS
Yeah. Ring me up a couple of `em.
Hannah, fresh from the tub, stands to let Curtis rub her wet
head with a towel. He finishes and stands.
CURTIS
All right. Bedtime.
Hannah looks up at him. Curtis signs his hand like a pillow
then touches his watch. They move out of the bathroom.
Curtis sits on the edge of his bed staring at the window in
their room. He's already dressed for work.
He watches as the thick, dark rain hits the window and
streaks. He has a curious look on his face.
MOVING, down the hall.
MOVING, past the den.
MOVING, into the kitchen.
Curtis stops at the entry to the kitchen. Samantha, wearing
a robe, stands with her back to him. She's cooking something
at the stove.
Curtis notices the back door standing open. HARD RAIN slants
down outside. He looks down at the tile floor.
WET FOOTPRINTS track inside.
They lead to where Samantha is standing. She turns to him.
She's pale with a vacant look on her face. Her hair is
soaking wet.
Curtis looks at her, concerned. She stares back,
emotionless. She slowly looks down at the counter next to
her. A kitchen knife rests there.
Curtis looks at the knife. They look at one another again.
73.
Curtis sits at the breakfast table across from Hannah. He
looks over at Samantha. She cooks, her back to him. Hannah
climbs out of her chair and goes to look out the back door.
Samantha turns and dishes eggs onto Curtis' plate.
SAMANTHA
You okay?
She touches his hand. Curtis FLINCHES.
Their eyes meet. He wants to take it back, and she can see
that. It begins to sink in for her.
Hannah vocalizes something behind them.
Samantha looks at her husband, shakes her head in disbelief.
Hannah makes another sound, pounds on the back door.
Samantha turns and sees a MAN standing in their backyard.
She flinches.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
Who's that?
Curtis stands to see out the back door.
CURTIS
Ah shit.
Samantha clears the table. Hannah sits, watching her father
walk in. Curtis stops just inside the door, closes it.
CURTIS
I've been fired.
Samantha continues clearing the dishes to the sink. She
doesn't look up.
SAMANTHA
What about the health insurance?
CURTIS
We get two more weeks.
Samantha slams the plates into the sink. They break. She
holds her head back and stares at the ceiling.
She walks over to Curtis...
CURTIS (CONT'D)
I'm sorry...
...and SLAPS him across the face.
Hannah begins to cry.
75.
Samantha turns and collects Hannah from the table. She grabs
her things and walks out of the house.
Curtis stands alone in the kitchen.
Curtis walks down the hallway to Kendra's office. The door
ajar, he knocks and enters.
Curtis finds ANDY(42), a man in khakis and a button up,
sitting behind the desk.
CURTIS
Oh, `scuse me.
Andy rises from his chair.
ANDY
Are you Curtis?
CURTIS
Yeah.
ANDY
Come in. Kendra transferred out.
I'll be meeting with you today.
Curtis looks at the man. He's kind of mincing.
ANDY (CONT'D)
Please, sit down.
Curtis takes a seat.
CURTIS
What happened to Kendra?
ANDY
She got into a program at OSU so
she'll be transferring near there.
I've split her case load with
another counselor. It's been kind
of crazy around here lately.
CURTIS
Huh.
ANDY
So I've looked over your file. It
says your mother was diagnosed with
paranoid schizophrenia in her early
thirties. Let's start there.
76.
Curtis looks at the man for a moment, then stands and walks
out of the room.
Curtis hefts a porcelain toilet down the steps of the
shelter. A dull light glows through the new entryway that's
been knocked out through the back left wall.
Curtis goes through it.
IN THE SHIPPING CONTAINER SECTION,
Curtis sets the toilet on the floor. He picks up the camping
lantern and holds it up to the space.
The lack of light makes it feel more cavernous than it is.
Two cots have been brought down as well as an assortment of
supplies. Canned food, a small gas burner.
Curtis hangs the lantern onto a hook on the wall and goes
about connecting the toilet to a pipe sticking out of the
back corner.
Samantha walks inside followed by Hannah and a WOMAN from the
flea market.
SAMANTHA
I'm so sorry. I completely forgot.
WOMAN
That's okay. Don't worry about it.
SAMANTHA
Here. I hope you like them.
Samantha hands over the plastic bag.
WOMAN
Thanks. I brought cash.
SAMANTHA
That's terrific. It's fine.
77.
Samantha takes three twenties from her.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
Call me if they don't work and I'm
sorry again.
WOMAN
Oh, it's okay. Thank you.
Samantha closes the door.
IN THE KITCHEN,
Samantha takes the tin decorated with ocean creatures down
from the fridge. She removes the envelope with the word
"BEACH" written on it and takes out a stack of bills.
She folds the bills over and stuffs them into her purse
before placing the empty envelope back in the tin.
She looks out back and sees Curtis sitting with Hannah.
OUTSIDE,
The shipping container has been covered over with dirt. Two
rotating vents spin at either end of the brown mound. Curtis
sits on the freshly packed dirt signing with Hannah.
He signs something that makes her laugh. Hannah smacks a
muddy clump between her hands. Curtis touches her nose,
leaving a dirt smudge. Hannah laughs. She touches his face,
smudging it.
IN THE KITCHEN,
Samantha watches through the back door.
Samantha tucks Hannah into bed. She kisses her on the head
and turns out the bedside lamp. Samantha leaves the room.
The inside of the club is a musty banquet hall with wood
panelled walls and a drop tile ceiling. The place is packed.
Rows of folding tables fill the center of the room. A long
LINE has formed along the side wall that wraps to a serving
station at the back. Heated metal bins filled with fried
oysters and french fries.
Curtis gets in line with his family.
AT THE SERVING TABLE,
Curtis holds two paper plates.
CURTIS
How many pieces does Hannah get?
SAMANTHA
Just one.
Curtis uses tongs to grab pieces of fried oyster. Looking
up, he can see back through the kitchen to an open door
outside. Dewart stands there over a butane fired frying pot.
He wears an apron and stares at Curtis.
Curtis moves down the line.
Lewis sits with Cammie and their baby. He laughs and talks
with another man. From a different table, Russell leans over
to eye Curtis.
80.
Curtis sits at a table with his family. He loads Hannah's
plate up with ketchup.
A tap on his shoulder. Curtis turns to find Dewart standing
over him.
DEWART
What're you doin' here?
CURTIS
Not here man.
Dewart taps him on the shoulder again.
DEWART
I said what are you doin' here.
Curtis stands and Dewart takes a step back. The general
noise of the place starts to quiet down as people take
notice. A few stand.
SAMANTHA
Curtis.
DEWART
I told people what you been doin'.
CURTIS
I know.
DEWART
You cut me loose. Everything we
been through.
CURTIS
I know. I'm sorry.
Dewart shoves him in the chest.
DEWART
You ain't fucking sorry. You sorry
you wouldn't cut me loose. We
fuckin' friends! This how you
treat friends?
Curtis places a hand on Dewart's chest.
CURTIS
Come on.
Dewart punches Curtis in the face. It stings.
CURTIS (CONT'D)
God dammit.
81.
Samantha gathers Hannah and moves back. Dewart shoves Curtis
across the table. Oysters and bottles go everywhere. The
entire room is on its feet watching.
Curtis slips getting up. Dewart walks around the table,
heading for him.
SAMANTHA
STOP IT DEWART!
Curtis stands and kicks Dewart in the knee. It buckles back
and he's on the floor. He cries out and grabs the twisted
joint. He's done.
Curtis paces over him, covered in ketchup and soda. He
shouts down at him.
CURTIS
I SAID NOT HERE! GOD DAMNIT!
He wipes at his face. Sees all of the people staring at him.
Addresses them.
CURTIS (CONT'D)
You think I'm crazy?! Huh! Is that
what he told you!
Curtis TURNS OVER A TABLE. He points to the gawking crowd.
CURTIS (CONT'D)
Well, listen up! There is a storm
comin' like nothing you have ever
seen. And not a one of you is
prepared for it.
(PACING)
You think I'm crazy? I'M TALKIN'
TO YOU RUSSELL!
(PACING)
LEWIS! You think I'm a thief?
Hannah watches. THE SOUND MUTED. She looks on as Curtis
paces, pointing and yelling, red faced at the crowd.
Curtis backs off.
CURTIS (CONT'D)
Sleep well in your beds. Cause if
this thing comes true, there ain't
gonna be any more.
Curtis looks down at Dewart.
He turns to see Hannah. She's tucked under her Mother's leg
crying. This hits him hard. He stops. Looking at Samantha,
his eyes fill with tears.
82.
Samantha, leading Hannah by the hand, walks to Curtis. He
stares at her, on the verge of breaking down.
She takes her hand and gently pulls his head down to her
shoulder. Without another look toward the crowd, Samantha
leads her family out of the dining hall.
Curtis wakes to Samantha shaking him by the shoulders. She's
nearly on top of him in the bed.
SAMANTHA
Curtis! Wake up! Wake up!
TORNADO SIRENS continue to scream throughout the
neighborhood.
Curtis looks to the window. Rain and hail are battering the
house. He jumps to his feet and grabs Samantha by the arm.
They rush out of the room.
Curtis bursts into the room. Hannah is standing at the
window looking out. Curtis scoops her up, scaring her. She
begins to cry as they run from the room.
Curtis slams the doors behind them. It's pitch black until
he gets to the switch on the lantern. The room fills with
the orange glow as Curtis snaps the padlock through the door
handles.
84.
CURTIS
Come on. It's okay.
Curtis leads them through the entry to the larger section of
the shelter. Samantha takes Hannah and sits with her on one
of the cots. She's signing to her, trying to calm her down.
CURTIS (CONT'D)
It's okay. All right. Come on. Sit
down.
Curtis goes to a trunk in the corner and begins rooting
through it. He removes two gas masks and an oxygen mask
connected to a small tank.
He goes over and kneels in front of Hannah. He tries
slipping the oxygen mask over her face. Samantha grabs his
wrist.
SAMANTHA
No. Don't do that.
CURTIS
It's okay. It's oxygen. Here. Put
this on.
Curtis hands Samantha a gas mask.
SAMANTHA
Are you kidding?
CURTIS
Please just do it. Okay?
He looks to Hannah and places an oxygen mask over her face..
CURTIS (CONT'D)
There we go. All right. Keep it out
of your eyes. Okay?
He signs to her.
CURTIS (CONT'D)
Hey. I love you. It's okay.
Curtis eases on the knob at the top of the tank.
He climbs onto the cot and puts his arm around them. He
slips on his gas mask.
Samantha is hesitant. She looks at her husband in the mask
and leans back against the side of the container. Hannah
looks up at her. She touches her mother's mask.
Samantha slips on the gas mask.
85.
The camping lantern on the floor casts long shadows up. The
faint boom of thunder rolls softly outside.
The family sits huddled together on the cot, wearing their
masks.
A CRACK of thunder rattles the shelter. Curtis snaps awake,
still wearing his gas mask.
Samantha has climbed on the other cot and is asleep. Hannah
sleeps under Curtis' arm. He gently lays her down on the cot
and stands to stretch.
He walks into the original section of the shelter and grabs a
small flashlight off the metal shelving. He clicks it on and
moves over to the concrete steps.
He takes a seat and listens. He places his hand onto the
metal door. A BOOM of thunder.
He can hear the rain and wind blowing outside.
Samantha rubs Curtis' shoulder, gently waking him.
SAMANTHA
Wake up babe.
Curtis' head moves. He sees that Samantha and Hannah have
removed their masks.
CURTIS
Where's your mask?
SAMANTHA
We took them off. It's fine. Take
it off.
CURTIS
No.
Curtis hesitates.
SAMANTHA
We're fine. Take it off.
Curtis slips the mask off his face. Worried, he takes a
breath.
SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
You need to open the door now.
86.
Curtis doesn't move. He looks at them.
CURTIS
(MUMBLES)
What if it's...What if it's not
over?
SAMANTHA
What?
CURTIS
What if it's not over?
SAMANTHA
It's over. Get the keys. Open the
door.
Curtis slowly gets to his feet. He sees the dark entryway to
the original section of the shelter. Taking the lantern, he
walks to it.
Samantha and Hannah follow.
Curtis stops just inside. He holds the lantern up,
illuminating the padlocked metal doors.
He looks back at his family, then climbs the steps. He
places his hand on the door. He flinches.
CURTIS
It's still storming.
SAMANTHA
No. It's not.
CURTIS
I can hear it.
Samantha stares at him. The room is silent.
SAMANTHA
I don't hear anything.
CURTIS
Put your hand on the door. You can
feel it.
He takes Samantha's wrist and guides her to the doors. He
watches her face as she places a hand against the metal. She
looks at him, her eyes getting red, and shakes her head "no".
Curtis kneels in front of Hannah and mimics the signs from
earlier.
CURTIS (CONT'D)
(signing and speaking)
Thunder? Do you feel it?
87.
He flinches again. Looks to the ceiling
CURTIS (CONT'D)
(signing and speaking)
You feel it? You feel it?
Hannah walks to her mother. Samantha holds onto her.
Curtis steps back from them. They watch him, their backs to
the doors. He flinches and covers his mouth.
CURTIS (CONT'D)
I'm sorry.
SAMANTHA
Baby, there's no storm outside.
CURTIS
I'm sorry.
Samantha walks over to him.
SAMANTHA
Curtis. I wouldn't lie to you. We
love you very much. Please open
the door.
Curtis is on the verge of tears.
He slowly reaches into his jeans pocket. He removes the
keys. He holds them out to Samantha.
CURTIS
I'm sorry. I can't.
Samantha looks at the keys, then at Curtis. Tears shake from
his trembling face.
SAMANTHA
I love you, but if I open the door,
then nothin's gonna change. You'll
see that everything's fine, but
nothing will change. Please. This
is what it means to stay with us.
This is something you have to do.
He looks at Hannah, then Samantha. Curtis steadies himself,
trying to control his flinching. He wipes his face with the
back of his hands and takes a deep breath.
Curtis walks toward the doors. On the steps, he reaches up
to the padlock. The keys shake in his fingers. He turns to
Samantha.
CURTIS
Could you move Hannah back?
88.
Samantha picks Hannah up in her arms and Curtis watches them
retreat to the rear wall.
He goes back to the lock. He inserts the key. The padlock
pops open. Curtis removes it. He looks back at Samantha,
then flings open the doors.
SUNLIGHT.
It's blinding. Curtis holds his hand up to cover his eyes.
He stares up at a crystal blue sky. Samantha watches as
Curtis steps out of the shelter.
Curtis sits with Samantha in the plush office of a
PSYCHIATRIST(56). Curtis rubs his hand over the soft leather
upholstery on the couch.
PSYCHIATRIST
Do you have any vacation time that
you could use?
CURTIS
I don't have a job right now.
PSYCHIATRIST
Well, I know that times are hard,
but I think it's really important
for you to separate yourself from
that storm shelter.
(MORE)
89.
PSYCHIATRIST (CONT'D)
I think you need to break away from
it for awhile. We can start you on
some medication that I think will
help, but that action alone would
mean a lot.
SAMANTHA
We usually go on a trip to Myrtle
Beach every summer. We were gonns
go this month.
PSYCHIATRIST
I think that would be okay if we
start the medication now. It would
give you all some time to prepare
as a family, but I want to be
clear, when Curtis gets back he'll
need to take more time than that.
SAMANTHA
What does that mean?
PSYCHIATRIST
I mean that he'll need hands on
therapy at a real facility.
Curtis looks up for the first time.
CURTIS
You mean I have to leave my family.
PSYCHIATRIST
I think you need to seriously
commit to some treatment.
Curtis processes this. Samantha takes his hand.
Samantha drops four hotdogs into a boiling pot of water and
stirs a bubbling pot of canned chili.
90.
The beach condo is small, but brightly furnished.
