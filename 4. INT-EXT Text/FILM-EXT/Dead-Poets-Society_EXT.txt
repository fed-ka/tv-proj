The school lawn is a filled with luggage, students, and parents mulling
about in every direction.
INT CHURCH ENTRANCE - DAY
Mr Nolan stands by the entrance, speaking with each family as they leave.
MR NOLAN
Glad you could come by.
MR ANDERSON
Thrilling ceremony as usual Dr. Nolan.
MR NOLAN
You've been away too long.
MRS ANDERSON
Hello Dr. Nolan.
MR NOLAN
Good to have you back.
MRS ANDERSON
This is our youngest, Todd.
MR NOLAN
Mr. Anderson.You have some big shoes to fill,
young man. Your brother was one of our finest.
TODD
Thank you.
Todd and his parents leave while others file past Mr. Nolan.
WOMAN
Lovely ceremony.
MR NOLAN
Thank you. So glad you liked it.
MR PERRY approaches with his son Neil. He shakes Mr. Nolan's hand.
MR PERRY
Gale
MR NOLAN
Tom
MR PERRY
Good to see you again.
NEIL
Hello Mr. Nolan.
MR NOLAN
Neil. We expect great things from you this year.
NEIL
Thank you, sir.
MR PERRY
Well he won't disappoint us. Right Neil?
NEIL
I'll do my best sir.
EXT SCHOOL GROUNDS - DAY
A bell tolls. Parents begin wishing their boys farewell.
FATHER
Hey, come on son.
MOTHER
Chin up.
FATHER
No tears now.
BOY
Okay.
MOTHER
Chin up.
Another boy hugs his mother.
BOY
I don't want to go here.
MOTHER
You be a good boy and do your lessons.
EXT SCHOOL GROUNDS - DAY
Neil emerges from a building and sees Todd.
NEIL
Hey, I hear we're gonna be roommates.
He shakes Todd's hand.
NEIL
I'm Neil Perry.
TODD
Todd Anderson.
NEIL
Why'd you leave Balincrest?
TODD
My brother went here.
NEIL
Oh, so you're that Anderson.
INT DORMATORY - DAY
DR. HAGER is standing in his room doorway while SPAZ and his father are
going over some last minute precautions over the boy's allergies. Spaz's
father hands Hager various bottles.
FATHER
This is for sinuses. Oh, and if he can't swallow you
give him one of these. And if he had trouble breathing
you can give him some of those.
HAGER
All right fine.
Dr. Hager takes the bottles and quickly backs into his room, shutting
the door.
FATHER
(to son)
Did you remember your vaporizer?
SPAZ
Yes, I put it in my room.
Spaz's father tries to say something else to Dr. Hager but realizes he
has already gone.
INT HALLWAY - DAY
Neil pushes his way through a crowd of boys, carrying two suitcases. As
he enters his room, Knox quickly passes by.
KNOX
Hey, how's it going Neil?
NEIL
Hey Knox.
Cameron comes by and leans against the doorway.
CAMERON
Neil, study group tonight?
NEIL
Yeah, sure.
CAMERON
Business as usual, huh? Hey, I hear you got the new
kid. Looks like a stiff!
He begins laughing when he notices Todd coming into the room.
CAMERON
Oops!
Cameron quickly leaves. Neil tries to keep from laughing as Todd enters
the room and sets his luggage down on his bed.
NEIL
Listen, don't mind Cameron. He was born with his
foot in his mouth. You know what I mean?
He pulls some papers from his blazer pocket and playfully whacks Todd
across the back with it.
CHARLIE comes to the door with a smug expression on his face. Knox and
MEEKS are close behind him. He points at Neil
CHARLIE
Rumor has it, you did summer school.
NEIL
Yep. Chemistry. My father thought I should get ahead.
How was your summer Slick?
CHARLIE
Keen.
The boys enter the room. Charlie turns around and looks at Meeks who is
just entering.
CHARLIE
Meeks. Door. Closed.
MEEKS
Yes sir.
NEIL
Gentlemen, what are the four pillars?
BOYS
Travesty. Horror. Decadence. Excrement.
Charlie makes himself comfortable on Neil's bed and lights up a cigarette.
Meanwhile, Todd is by his bed unpacking his luggage.
CHARLIE
Okay, study group. Meeks aced Latin. I didn't quite
flunk English. So, if you want, we've got our study
group.
NEIL
Sure. Cameron asked me too. Anyone mind
including him?
CHARLIE
Hmm, what's his specialty, boot-licking?
NEIL
Come on, he's your roommate.
CHARLIE
That's not my fault.
Meeks seems to notice Todd for the first time.
MEEKS
Oh, I'm sorry, my name is Steven Meeks.
Neil quickly gets up from his spot by the window.
NEIL
Oh, this is Todd Anderson.
Todd turns around and shakes hands with Meeks.
MEEKS
Nice to meet you.
TODD
Nice to meet you.
CHARLIE
Charlie Dalton.
Charlie continues to lay on the bed, looking smug. Knox extends a hand.
KNOX
Knox Overstreet.
NEIL
Todd's brother was Jeffrey Anderson.
CHARLIE
Oh yeah, sure. Valedictorian. National merit scholar.
MEEKS
Oh well, welcome to Hell-ton.
CHARLIE
It's every bit as tough as they say, unless you're a
genius like Meeks.
MEEKS
He flatters me. That's why I help him with Latin.
CHARLIE
And English, and Trig.
Charlie begins coughing. There is a knock at the door. Charlie quickly
stamps out his cigarette on the floor and Neil tries to wave the smoke
from the air.
NEIL
It's open.
The door opens and Mr. Perry walks into the room. Neil quickly rises from
the window.
NEIL
Father, I thought you'd gone.
The other boys stand up when he enters.
BOYS
Mr. Perry.
MR PERRY
Keep your seats fellows, keep your seats. Neil, I've
just spoken to Mr. Nolan. I think that you're taking
too many extra curricular activities this semester, and
I've decided that you should drop the school annual.
NEIL
But I'm the assistant editor this year.
MR PERRY
Well I'm sorry Neil.
NEIL
But Father, I can't. It wouldn't be fair.
MR PERRY
Fellas, would you excuse us for a moment?
Mr. Perry walks towards the door and Neil hesitantly follows. Mr. Perry
pauses by the door and smiles to the other boys.
A clock bell chimes five o'clock. Enormous flocks of birds, apparently
disturbed by the noise, take to the sky.
The boys emerge from the school, loaded down with numerous books.
PITTS
That was weird.
NEIL
But different.
KNOX
Spooky if you ask me.
CAMERON
Think he'll test us on that stuff?
CHARLIE
Come on Cameron, don't you get anything?
CAMERON
What? What?
The car leaves Welton and drives towards the Danburry's house.
INT / EXT DANBURRY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
The doorbell rings.
MRS DANBURRY (O.S.)
Chet, can you get that?
CHET (O.S.)
I can't, Mom.
CHRIS (O.S.)
I'll get it.
The door opens and Knox is awe-struck by the beautiful girl (CHRIS) who
has answered the door.
CHRIS
Can I help you?
Knox manages to break out of his daze.
KNOX
Hi. Knox Overstreet. Uh, Dr. Hager.
CHRIS
Hi.
KNOX
This is the Danburry's, right?
CHRIS
Are you here to see Chet?
KNOX
Mrs. Danburry?
Chris begins to laugh as Mrs. Danburry arrives behind her.
CHRIS
No.
MRS DANBURRY
Sorry. Thank you Chris. I'm Mrs. Danburry.
You must be Knox.
KNOX
Yes.
MRS DANBURRY
(to Dr. Hager)
Back by nine.
(to Knox)
Please come in.
CHET (O.S.)
Chris, come on, what are you doing?
CHRIS
Chet, I'm coming.
Knox enters the house, his mind still hung up on Chris as MR DANBURRY
comes out of the living room to meet him.
MR DANBURRY
Knox. How are you? Joe Danburry.
KNOX
Nice to meet you sir.
MR DANBURRY
Well he's the spitting image of his father,
isn't he. How is he? Come on in.
CHET (O.S.)
Chris!
KNOX
He's great. He just did a big case for GM.
CHRIS (O.S.)
I'm coming.
MR DANBURRY
I know where you're headed, like father
like son, huh?
Keating is walking down towards the lake, whistling the same tune as before.
The boys emerge from the building and chase after him.
NEIL
Mr. Keating? Mr. Keating? Sir? Oh Captain,
My Captain?
Keating immediately turns around.
KEATING
Gentlemen.
NEIL
We were just looking in your old annual.
He hands Keating the annual and Keating looks at his old photograph.
KEATING
Oh my God. No, that's not me. Stanley
"The Tool" Wilson-
Keating crouches down and continues looking through the book.
KEATING
God.
Neil crouches down next to Keating.
NEIL
What was the Dead Poets Society?
KEATING
I doubt the present administration would
look too favorably upon that.
NEIL
Why? What was it?
KEATING
Gentlemen, can you keep a secret?
NEIL
Sure.
The other boys crouch down around Keating.
KEATING
The Dead Poets were dedicated to sucking
the marrow out of life. That's a phrase
from Thoreau that we'd invoke at the
beginning of each meeting. You see we'd
gather at the old Indian cave and take
turns reading from Thoreau, Whitman,
Shelley; the biggies. Even some of our
own verse. And in the enchantment of the
moment we'd let poetry work its magic.
KNOX
You mean it was a bunch of guys sitting
around reading poetry?
KEATING
No Mr. Overstreet, it wasn't just "guys",
we weren't a Greek organization, we were
romantics. We didn't just read poetry,
we let it drip from our tongues like honey.
Spirits soared, women swooned, and gods
were created, gentlemen, not a bad way to
spend an evening eh? Thank you Mr. Perry
for this trip down amnesia lane. Burn that,
especially my picture.
Keating hands the annual back and walks away, whistling once again. Neil
remains crouched.
NEIL
Dead Poets Society.
CAMERON
What?
The school bells begin ringing and everyone heads back towards the school.
Neil stands up.
NEIL
I say we go tonight.
CHARLIE
Tonight?
CAMERON
Wait a minute.
PITTS
Where's this cave he's talking about?
NEIL
It's beyond the stream. I know where it
is.
PITTS
That's miles.
CAMERON
Sounds boring to me.
CHARLIE
Don't go.
CAMERON
You know how many de-merits we're talking
Dalton
CHARLIE
So don't come, please.
CAMERON
Look, all I'm saying is that we have to
be careful, we can't get caught.
CHARLIE
No shit, Sherlock.
HAGER
(yelling)
You boys there, hurry up.
Neil turns around and faces the other boys.
NEIL
All right, who's in?
CAMERON
Come on Neil, Hager's right-
NEIL
Forget Hager, no. Who's in?
CHARLIE
I'm in.
HAGER (O.S.)
I'm warning you, move.
CAMERON
Me too.
PITTS
I don't know Neil
NEIL
What? Pitts-
CHARLIE
Pitsie, come on.
MEEKS
His grades are hurting Charlie.
NEIL
You can help him Meeks.
PITTS
What is this, a midnight study group?
NEIL
Forget it Pitts, you're coming. Meeks,
are your grades hurting too?
MEEKS
I'll try anything once.
CHARLIE
Except sex.
MEEKS
Ha ha ha.
CAMERON
I mean as long as we're careful.
The boys run into the building.
CHARLIE
What about you Knox?
KNOX
I don't know Charlie.
CHARLIE
Come on Knox, it'll help you get Chris.
KNOX
Yeah? How?
CHARLIE
Women swoon.
Charlie laughs and runs inside. Knox chases after him.
KNOX
But why do they swoon? Charlie, tell me
why they swoon. Charlie!
INT LIBRARY - DAY
The boys are all gathered around one of the tables with a map laid out
on it.
NEIL
(whispering)
Okay, follow the stream to the waterfall.
It's right there. It's got to be on the
banks.
CAMERON
I don't know, it's starting to sound
dangerous.
CHARLIE
Well, why don't you stay home?
MCALLISTER
For God's sake stop chattering and
sit down.
The boys take their seats once again and Neil goes over and sits next to
Todd, who is sitting by himself.
NEIL
Todd, are you coming tonight?
TODD
No.
NEIL
Why not? God, you were there. You heard
Keating. Don't you want to do something
about it?
TODD
Yes, but-
NEIL
But? But what?
TODD
Keating said that everybody took turns
reading and I don't want to do that.
NEIL
Gosh, you really have a problem with
that, don't you?
TODD
N- no, I don't have a problem. Neil,
I just- I just don't want to do it,
okay?
NEIL
All right. What if you didn't have to
read? What if you just came and
listened?
TODD
That's not how it works.
NEIL
Forget how it works. What if - what if
they said it was okay?
TODD
What? What are you gonna do, go up and
ask them?
Neil shrugs.
TODD
No. No, Neil.
NEIL
I'll be right back.
TODD
Neil, Neil!
Neil gets up and rejoins the others. McAllister hears the boys whispering
again.
MCALLISTER
Oh shut up, will you.
INT BATHROOM - NIGHT
Various boys are crowded around the sinks getting ready for bed. Someone
is playing snake charmer music on a kazoo while someone else is bothering
Spaz with a red sock puppet acting like a snake.
SPAZ
That's my- that's for my asthma, okay.
Could you give that back please? Could
you give that back?
BOY
What's the matter? Don't you like snakes?
Neil enters and taps Todd on the shoulder.
NEIL
You're in.
SPAZ
Get away from me, okay?
BOY
Spaz, why don't you check your pocket,
huh? Come on Spaz I have to brush my
teeth
SPAZ
Get a- get off,
Hager walks past the bathroom and into his room.
HAGER
Cut out that racket in there.
The kazoo player lets out a rude squeek before finally stopping. Hager
glares at them for a moment.
INT NEIL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Neil stands in his doorway. He looks across the hall to the other room
where Cameron and Charlie are standing. Cameron gives a thumbs up. Neil
closes his room door and takes out his cloak and a flashlight. Setting
the flashlight down on the desk, he notices a worn book, "Five
Centuries of Verse", sitting there. Opening it up, he sees John Keating's
name at the top followed by "Dead Poets". Below the title of the book,
is written: "To Be Read At The Opening of D.P.S. Meetings." Along with
several lines from Thoreau, beginning with "I went to the woods because
I wanted to live deliberately
"
INT STAIRWAY - NIGHT
The shadows of hooded figures can be seen moving throughout the darkened
halls.
INT HAGER'S ROOM - NIGHT
Hager hears a dog barking.
INT HALLWAY - NIGHT
Someone drops a number of dog biscuits by the dog's feet. He stops
barking and immediately begins gobbling them down. Hager looks out
into the hallway with his flashlight but sees nothing.
EXT SCHOOL GROUNDS - NIGHT
The boys quietly leave the building and set off running across the
fields towards the woods.
EXT WOODS - NIGHT
The boys search about the trees trying to find the cave. Meeks is
searching around when Charlie leaps up behind Meeks in the dark
shining the flashlight up at his own face and grabs Meeks by the
shoulder.
CHARLIE
Arrr, I'm a dead poet.
MEEKS
Aww, Charlie.
CHARLIE
(laughing)
Guys, over here.
MEEKS
You're funny. You're real funny.
INT CAVE - NIGHT
The boys are trying to start a fire. The cave is quickly filling up with
smoke.
MEEKS
It's too wet.
CHARLIE
God, are you trying to smoke us out of
here?
MEEKS
No, no, the smoke's going right up this
opening.
Pitts tries to stand up and slams his head into the low rock ceiling. He
lets out a yell while the others laugh.
NEIL
You okay?
PITTS
Oh God. Clowns.
NEIL
All right, all right, forget the fire.
Let's go gentlemen.
Neil stands before the others with the book in hand, and takes a drag
on a cigarette.
NEIL
I hereby reconvene the Dead Poets
Society.
The boys cheer.
NEIL
Welton chapter. The meetings will be
conducted by myself and the other new
initiates now present. Todd Anderson,
because he prefers not to read, will
keep minutes of the meetings. I'll now
read the traditional opening message by
society member Henry David Thoreau. "I
went to the woods because I wanted to
live deliberately. I wanted to live deep
and suck out all the marrow of life."
CHARLIE
I'll second that.
NEIL
"To put to rout all that was not life,
and not, when I had come to die,
discover that I had not lived.
Several boys whistle softly in reaction to the poem.
NEIL
And Keating's marked a bunch of other
pages.
Neil begins flipping through the book.
CHARLIE
All right, intermission. Dig deep right
here. Right here, lay it down
CAMERON
On the mud? We're gonna put our food on
the mud?
CHARLIE
Meeks, put your coat down. Picnic blanket.
MEEKS
Yes sir, use Meeks' coat.
CHARLIE
Don't keep anything back either. You
guys are always bumming my smokes.
Meeks lays his coat down and everyone dumps their food on it. Amongst
the pile are chocolate chip cookies, a box of raisins, a few apples, an
orange, and half a roll.
NEIL
Raisins?
KNOX
Yuck.
CHARLIE
Wait a minute, who gave us half a roll?
PITTS
(talking with his mouth full)
I'm eating the other half.
CHARLIE
Come on.
PITTS
You want me to put it back?
INT CAVE - NIGHT
Neil, lit up by a flashlight, begins to tell everyone a story.
NEIL
It was a dark and rainy night, and this
old lady, who had a passion for jigsaw
puzzles, sat by herself in her house at
her table to complete a new jigsaw puzzle.
But as she pieced the puzzle together, she
realized, to her astonishment, that the
image that was formed was her very own
room. And the figure in the center of the
puzzle, as she completed it, was herself.
And with trembling hands, she placed the
last four pieces and stared in horror at
the face of a demented madman at the
window. The last thing that this old lady
ever heard was the sound of breaking glass.
BOYS
Ohhh
no
NEIL
This is true, this is true.
CAMERON
I've got one that's even better than
that.
CHARLIE
Ha!
CAMERON
I do. There's a young, married couple,
and they're driving through the forest
at night on a long trip. And they run
out of gas, and there's a madman on the-
CHARLIE
The thing with the hand-
All the boys react, recalling the story and miming the scraping on the
roof of the car.
CAMERON
I love that story.
CHARLIE
I told you that one.
CAMERON
You did not. I got that in camp in
sixth grade.
CHARLIE
When were you in six, last year?
As everyone's voices begin to calm down, Pitts begins reading from the
book.
PITTS
"In a mean abode in the shanking road,
lived a man named William Bloat. Now,
he had a wife, the plague of his life,
who continually got his goat. And one
day at dawn, with her nightshift on,
he slit her bloody throat."
The boys laugh.
PITTS
Oh, and it gets worse.
CHARLIE
You want to hear a real poem?
Meeks hands Charlie the book but he shoves it away.
CHARLIE
All right? No, I don't need it. You take
it.
MEEKS
What, did you bring one?
NEIL
You memorized a poem?
CHARLIE
I didn't memorize a poem. Move up.
Neil moves to the side as Charlie stands and takes his spot.
MEEKS
An original piece by Charlie Dalton.
KNOX
An original piece.
PITTS
Take center stage.
NEIL
You know this is history. Right? This is
history.
Charlie clears his throat and pulls out a page from a magazine and
slowly unfolds it, revealing a Playboy centerfold (Elaine Reynolds,
Miss October, 1959)
MEEKS
Oh, wow.
CAMERON
Where did you get that?
CHARLIE
Teach me to love? Go teach thyself more
wit.
I, chief professor, am of it.
Neil gets up and looks over Charlie's shoulder to see what he is
reading.
CHARLIE
The god of love, if such a thing there
be, may learn to love from me.
Charlie winks at the guys and they clap and cheer.
NEIL
Wow! Did you write that?
Charlie turns over the centerfold to show where he had written down
the poem.
CHARLIE
Abraham Cowley. Okay, who's next?
Neil sits reading from the book by flashlight.
NEIL
Alfred Lord Tennyson.
Come my friends,
'Tis not too late to seek a newer world
for my purpose holds to sail beyond the
sunset.
And though we are not now that strength
which in old days
Moved earth and heaven; that which we
are, we are;--
One equal temper of heroic hearts,
Made weak by time and fate, but strong
in will.
To strive, to seek, to find, and not to
yield.
Meeks takes center stage and begins reading a poem like he is
performing a chant.
MEEKS
Then I had religion, then I had a
vision.
I could not turn from their revel in
derision.
Then I saw the Congo creeping through
the black,
cutting through the forest with a golden
track.
Then I saw the Congo creeping through
the black-
CHARLIE
Meeks, Meeks.
MEEKS
...cutting through the forest with a
golden track.
Then I saw the Congo creeping through
the black,
cutting through the forest with a golden
track.
Knox picks up a metal container and begins using it as a drum. The
other boys stand and begin going in a circle, making music with
sticks of wood, combs, etc.
Then I saw the Congo creeping through
the black,
cutting through the forest with a golden
track.
Then I saw the Congo creeping through
the black,
cutting through the forest with a golden
track.
BOYS
Then I saw the Congo creeping through
the black,
cutting through the forest with...
The boys continue to chant the chorus as they emerge from the
cave.
The clock tolls two as the boys silently run back to their dorm.
Cameron, Charlie, and several other boys are rowing while Mr. Nolan
shouts orders from a bullhorn.
MR. NOLAN
Take a power train in two! Three! Keep
your eyes in the boat!
Noisy static is replaced by music as Pitts climbs down form the peak to
join Meeks at their makeshift radio.
MEEKS
We got it, Pittsie. We got it! Radio
Free America!
EXT CAMPUS - DAY
Several students are fencing on a grassy slope.
Meeks and Pitts perform a goofy dance together to the music.
Knox is riding his bike around in circles near the entrance. Seeing no
one nearby, he races through the open gates and down the road. He comes
to the top of a hill and then goes downhill across the grass, shouting
as he sends an immense flock of geese flying into the air.
A number of vehicles drive up, filled with students dressed in bright red
cosyumes, playing trumpets and various other instruments as they pass.
Knox watches the growing crowd of students. They are all converging on
a bus. A football player, wearing a horned helmet, dances on the roof of
the bus. A band is playing while a group of cheerleaders are practising.
Knox spots Chris amongst the cheerleaders. He watches her until Chet
comes along and she grabs hold of his hand. Knox looks away in disgust.
COACH
Okay, everybody on the bus. Let's go,
boys. Come on, let's go. On the bus,
boys. Now!
Chris jumps into Chet's arms as everyone begins to board the buses. Knox
turns his bike around and leaves.
Keating walks across the field, followed by his students. He kicks a ball
ahead of him while he carries a number of other balls in a net slung over
his shoulder.
KEATING
Now, devotees may argue that one sport
or game is inherently better than
another. For me, sport is actually a
chance for us to have other human beings
push us to excel. I want you all to come
over here and take a slip of paper and
line up single file.
Keating reaches the stands. He tosses the balls aside and pulls sets
his briefcase down. As the boys line up he begins ripping off slips
of paper from a notepad and handing them out.
KEATING
Mr. Meeks, time to inherit the earth.
Mr. Pitts, rise above your name.
He hands the notepad to another student.
KEATING
I want you to hand these out to the boys,
one apiece.
The students are all lined up in single file, each holding a slip
of paper. Keating blows his whistle.
KEATING
You know what to do, Pitts.
PITTS
"Oh to struggle against great odds. To
meet enemies undaunted."
KEATING
Sounds to me like you're daunted. Say it
again like you're undaunted.
PITTS
"Oh to struggle against great odds. To
meet enemies undaunted."
KEATING
Now go on.
Pitts gives one of the soccer balls a good kick.
KEATING
Yes! Next.
One of the students sets up the next ball as the line advances.
BOY 1
"To be a sailor of the world, bound for
all ports."
KEATING
Next. Louder!
BOY 2
"Oh, I live to be the ruler of life, not
a slave."
Keating walks away and starts up a record player.
BOY 3
"To mount the scaffolds. To advance to
the muzzle of guns with perfect
nonchalance."
Classical music begins playing on the phonograph. Meeks goes to
read next but is confused by the music.
KEATING
Come on, Meeks! Listen to the music.
MEEKS
"To dance, clap hands, exalt, shout,
skip, roll on, float on."
KEATING
Yes!
HOPKINS
(without energy)
"Oh, to have life henceforth the poem of
new joys."
Hopkins crumples up his paper and then barely taps the soccer
ball with his foot.
Keating puts a look of disgust on his face.
KEATING
Oh! Boo! Come on, Charlie, let it fill
your soul!
Charlie raises his hands over his head.
CHARLIE
"To indeed be a god!"
A lone bagpiper plays out on the dock.
Keating's students are playing a soccer game. After they score the
winning goal they hoist Keating onto their shoulders and carry him
away.
The students are standing in a line while Cameron, Pitts, and Knox
are walking in a circle. Keating watches as they go around.
KEATING
No grades at stake, gentlemen. Just take
a stroll.
After a few moments, the three boys begin to march to the same beat.
KEATING
There it is.
The other boys start clapping to the rhythm of their steps.
KEATING
I don't know, but I've been told--
BOYS
I don't know, but I've been told--
KEATING
Doing poetry is old--
BOYS
Doing poetry is old--
Mr. Nolan looks out at them from his office as Keating joins the
boys and begins marching with them.
KEATING
Left, left, left-right-left. Left, left,
left-right-left. Left, halt!
The boys come to a halt.
KEATING
Thank you, gentlemen. If you noticed,
everyone started off with their own
stride, their own pace.
Keating begins walking very slowly.
KEATING
Mr. Pitts, taking his time. He knew he'll
get there one day. Mr. Cameron, you could
see him thinking, "Is this right? It might
be right. It might be right. I know that.
Maybe not. I don't know."
Keating begins walking with his groin pushed forward.
KEATING
Mr. Overstreet, driven by deeper force.
Yes. We know that. All right. Now, I
didn't bring them up here to ridicule
them. I brought them up here to illustrate
the point of conformity: the difficulty in
maintaining your own beliefs in the face
of others. Now, those of you -- I see
the look in your eyes like, "I would've
walked differently." Well, ask
yourselves why you were clapping. Now,
we all have a great need for acceptance.
But you must trust that your beliefs are
unique, your own, even though others may
think them odd or unpopular, even though
the herd may go, "That's baaaaad." Robert
Frost said, "Two roads diverged in a
wood and I, I took the one less traveled
by, and that has made all the
difference." Now, I want you to find
your own walk right now. Your own way of
striding, pacing. Any direction.
Anything you want. Whether it's proud,
whether it's silly, anything. Gentlemen,
the courtyard is yours.
The students begin walking about, some walking casually, others
making up silly walks. Keating notices that Charlie is still
leaning up against one of the pillars.
KEATING
You don't have to perform. Just make it
for yourself. Mr. Dalton? You be joining
us?
CHARLIE
Exercising the right not to walk.
KEATING
Thank you, Mr. Dalton. You just
illustrated the point. Swim against the
stream.
Nolan moves away from the window where he had been watching them.
Neil is walking by with the notes for the play when he notices Todd
sitting off by himself on one of the walkways.
NEIL
Todd? Hey.
TODD
Hey.
NEIL
What's going on?
TODD
Nothing. Today's my birthday.
NEIL
Is today your birthday? Happy birthday.
TODD
Thanks.
NEIL
What's you get?
TODD
My parents gave me this.
Neil looks down at a deskset sitting next to Todd, still in
its wrappings.
NEIL
Isn't this the same desk set-
TODD
Yeah, yeah. They gave me the same thing
as last year.
NEIL
Oh.
TODD
Oh.
NEIL
(laughing)
Maybe they thought you needed another
one.
TODD
Maybe they weren't thinking about
anything at all. Uh, the funny thing is
about this is I, I didn't even like it
the first time.
NEIL
Todd, I think you're underestimating the
value of this desk set.
Neil picks up the desk set and begins examining it more closely.
NEIL
I mean, who would want a football or
a baseball, or-
TODD
Or a car.
NEIL
Or a car if they could have a desk set
as wonderful as this one? I mean, if, if
I were ever going to buy a, a desk set
twice, I would probably buy this one
both times. In fact, its, its shape is,
it's rather aerodynamic, isn't it? I can
feel it. This desk set wants to fly.
Neil tosses the desk set lightly in the air. Todd stands up
and Neil hands him the desk set.
NEIL
Todd? The world's first unmanned flying
desk set.
Todd flings the desk set over the side of the walkway and it
falls to pieces down below.
TODD
Oh, my!
NEIL
Well, I wouldn't worry. You'll get
another one next year.
Neil bikes away as the clock bell tolls.
Knox exits one of the doors. The ground is covered with a thick
layer of snow. He looks around to see if anyone is about and then
hurries over to the bike rack. grabbing one of the bikes, he hurries
off.
Snow is lightly falling as Chris and Knox walk outside.
CHRIS
It's fine for you to come barging into
my school and make a complete fool out
of me?
KNOX
I didn't mean to make a fool out of you.
CHRIS
Well, you did. Chet found out. And it
took everything I could do to keep him
from coming here and killing you. Knox,
you have got to stop this stuff.
KNOX
I can't, Chris. I love you.
CHRIS
Knox, you say that over and over. You
don't, you don't even know me.
Keating calls out from a nearby car.
KEATING
Will you be joining us, Mr. Overstreet?
KNOX
Go ahead, Captain. I'll walk.
CHRIS
Knox, Knox, it just so happens that I
could care less about you?
KNOX
Then you wouldn't be here warning me
about Chet.
CHRIS
I have to go. I'm gonna be late for the
play.
KNOX
Are you going with him?
CHRIS
(laughs)
Chet? To a play? Are you kidding?
KNOX
Then come with me.
CHRIS
Knox, you are so infuriating.
KNOX
Come on, Chris. Just give me one chance.
If you don't like me after tonight, I'll
stay away forever.
CHRIS
Uh-huh.
KNOX
I promise. Dead Poets Honor. You come
with me tonight. And then, if you don't
want to see me again, I swear I'll bow
out.
CHRIS
You know what would happen if Chet found
out?
KNOX
He won't know anything. We'll sit in the
back and sneak away as soon as it's
over.
CHRIS
And I suppose you would promise that
this would be the end of it.
KNOX
Dead Poets Honor.
CHRIS
What is that?
KNOX
My word.
Chris walks away from him and then turns to face him.
CHRIS
You are so infuriating.
Chris gestures for Knox to follow her. Charlie does a little
twirl as he joins her and puts his arm around her. They walk away.
Mr. Perry pushes his way through the crowd of people, with Neil close
behind.
MR. PERRY
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.
The boys notice Neil and try to dtop him to talk.
CHARLIE
Neil, Neil, you were great.
NEIL
I can't, guys.
TODD
Neil! Neil!
Outside of the crowd, Keating manages to catch up to Neil. He takes
hold of Neil's coat.
KEATING
Neil. Neil. You have the gift. What a
performance You left even me speechless.
You have to stay with-
Mr. Perry returns from his car and shoves Neil aside.
MR. PERRY
Get in the car. Keating, you stay away
from my son.
CHARLIE
Neil! Neil! Mr. Perry, come on.
KEATING
Don't make it any worse than it is.
Neil and Mr. Perry get into their car and drive away. Keating
stares after them.
CHARLIE
Is it okay if we walk back? Captain?
Charlie motions Todd to follow.
CHARLIE
Knox.
The boys leave and Keating continues to stare after the car, wiping
the falling snow from his face.
It is a snowy, overcast morning. Todd walks through the snow. He
has his coat on over his pyjamas. The other boys follow closely
behind him as he walks down towards the water. He stops and stares
out at the snow-covered surroundings.
TODD
It's so beautiful.
Todd begins to gag and then goes down on his knees, vomiting into
the snow. The other boys huddle around him, hugging him.
CHARLIE
Todd. It's okay, Todd.
PITTS
Calm down.
CHARLIE
It's all right, Todd.
PITTS
Todd, it's okay. It's okay, Todd.
CHARLIE
It's all right. It's alright.
Charlie grabs a handful of snow and wipes Todd's mouth with it.
TODD
He wouldn't-- He wouldn't have done it.
MEEKS
You can't explain it, Todd.
TODD
It was his father!
CHARLIE
No!
TODD
He wouldn't have left us. It's because he-
He wouldn't have. His dad was-- his, his
father did it.
CHARLIE
Todd.
TODD
His father killed him. He made him do it.
MEEKS
You can't explain it, Todd.
Todd pushes himself away from the boys and stumbles down the hill,
slipping and falling in the snow.
MEEKS
Todd!
CHARLIE
Leave him be.
The boys watch as Todd runs down towards the dock by the river,
yelling and crying. He finally seems to regain control of himself
and walks in silence out onto the dock.
Mr. McAllister leads his students, textbooks in hand, through the
snow outside the classrooms.
McALLISTER
Grass is gramen or herba. Lapis is
stone. The entire building is
aedificium.
Keating looks out from his office window. McAllister pauses and looks
up at Keating, giving him a brief wave. Keating waves back.
