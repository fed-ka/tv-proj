      CLOSE ON THAT SAME PAIR OF EYES -- but twenty years younger.  
      And one of them is almost SWOLLEN SHUT.

      TWELVE YEAR OLD JACK stands nervously in the doorway of an 
      imposing STUDY.  Beautiful.  Ornate.  The kind of place where 
      you don t want to touch stuff.  Jack currently focused on --

    A WELL-WORN LEATHER CHAIR.  Its back facing us.  But 
      someone s in it -- A MASCULINE HAND reaches to the small end 
      table next to the chair, picks up a GLASS OF SCOTCH...

      CLINKS the ice cubes as he gently rotates his wrist.  And 
      finally --

    A FACE peers from around the chair.  Extremely handsome.  
      Very intense.  INTELLIGENCE dances behind his eyes.

      This is DR. SHEPHARD.  This is JACK S FATHER.

                                  SHEPHARD
                    Not the best decision, huh kiddo?

      Shephard offers a smile to his son -- but it s only with his 
      mouth, not his EYES.

                                  SHEPHARD
                    You wanna come in?

      Not really.  But Jack does anyway.  Walks up to his dad s 
      chair.  Of course, there s no place for him to sit.

                                  SHEPHARD
                    So how s the other guy look?

      Jack doesn t get the joke.  His father sighs --

                                  SHEPHARD (CONT D)
                    Want to tell me what happened?

                                  JACK
                          (shrugs)
                    Couple guys jumped Marc Silverman.

      (CONT'D):1313

                                  SHEPHARD
                    Couple guys jumped Marc Silverman.
                          (beat)
                    But they didn t jump you.

                                  JACK
                    No.

      Shephard just looks at his son for a moment.  Can t quite 
      read it... but it feels a lot like PITY.  Then --

      He extends his FISTS.  Face down.

                                  SHEPHARD
                    Okay, Jack.  One s got a quarter in 
                    it.  Other s empty.  You choose   
                    right, quarter s yours.  You choose 
                    wrong, you give me a quarter.

      Jack just looks at his father s outstretched hands for a 
      moment.  Not sure what s going on right now...

                                  SHEPHARD (CONT D)
                    Decide, Jack.

      Jack deliberates another moment.  Finally --

      Picks the left hand.  Shephard opens it up -- NOTHING inside.  
      Shakes his head --

                                  SHEPHARD (CONT D)
                    Pay up.*

      Is he serious?  Yeah.  He is.

      Jack reaches into his own pocket, hands his father a QUARTER.  
      The old man takes it, looking over his son s beaten face.  
      Downs a swallow of his drink --

                                  SHEPHARD (CONT D)
                    Your heart s in the right place.  *
                    Sticking up for the little guy.*
                          (beat)
                    But look what happened.  You made *
                    the wrong call.  You lost, buddy.*
                          (beat)*
                    You failed.*

      And let s stop for a second here.  Because this is one of 
      those moments in your childhood.  One of those moments where 
      your folks say something that just NEVER GOES AWAY.




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST         "White Rabbit"        (BLUE)         8/6/04     18.

      Something that sticks with you.  That BECOMES you.  And Jack 
      is listening to every fucking word of it.

                                  SHEPHARD (CONT D)
                    Boy was on my table today.  Year 
                    younger than you, maybe.  Bad 
                    heart.  And it was a real rough 
                    one, Jack.  Got real hairy, real 
                    fast.  People were looking to me to 
                    make decisions.  Big decisions.  
                    What to do.  How to do it.
                          (beat)
                    And I was able to make those 
                    decisions because at the end of the 
                    day after that boy died, I was able 
                    to wash my hands, come home to 
                    dinner, watch Carol Burnett and 
                    laugh until my sides hurt.  And how 
                    can I do that?  Even when I fail -- *
                    How do I do that?
                          (beat)
                    Because I have what it takes.

      And his father actually puts his hand on Jack s shoulder.  He 
      does love his son.  This is said out of that love... no 
      matter how fucking cruel is sounds to us --

                                  SHEPHARD
                    Don t choose, Jack.  Don t decide.  *
                    Walk away from the fights.  Because *
                    when you fail -- when you make the *
                    wrong choice?  It s gonna hurt.  *
                    And buddy?  When that hurt comes?
                          (beat)
                    You don t have what it takes.

      Jack absorbs that.  And more importantly, because this is his 
      father.  Because he is twelve.  Because this must be true --

      He BELIEVES it.

    A beat.  And then, his father again extends two fists --

                                  SHEPHARD (CONT D)
                    Same rules.  Double or nothing.  
                    Decide.

      But Jack just looks at the extended hands.  Many, many, many, 
      beats pass before Jack finally shakes his head.  No.

                                  SHEPHARD (CONT D)
                    Good boy.




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST     "White Rabbit"     (PRODUCTION DRAFT)     8/4/04    19.
      (CONT'D): (3)1313

      And OFF YOUNG JACK, the lesson not only learned, but HARD-
      WIRED, WE COME BACK TO--*


      Those same intense eyes.  UNBLINKING.

      Jack sits alone in the INFIRMARY TENT.  AND what s he staring 
      at?

      The OPEN RED SUITCASE that Charlie placed on the floor -- THE 
      EIGHTEEN BOTTLES OF WATER.

      And as if that wasn t enough to worry about here s -

                                  BOONE (O.S.)
                    Why didn t you leave me?

      Jack looks up to see BOONE standing in the opening of the 
      tent.  We get the feeling he s been working his way up to 
      this confrontation all morning.

      And this is the last fucking thing Jack needs.  He gets up, 
      exits the tent --

                                  JACK
                    Not now, man.*

                                  BOONE
                    I could have made it back.
                          (Jack ignores him)
                    What?  You re not gonna answer me?  
                    I told you to leave me, man.  I 
                    told you I could ve...

                                  JACK
                    You were drowning.

      And Boone can t argue that.  So --

                                  BOONE
                    You should ve saved her.

      Jack stands.  Gets in real close to Boone.  Something about  *
      his eyes -- something FRAYED.  But what he says, he says 
      quite SIMPLY --

                                  JACK
                    But I didn t save her.
                          (beat)
                    And neither did you.




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST     "White Rabbit"     (PRODUCTION DRAFT)     8/4/04    20.
      (CONT'D):1414

      And with that, Jack pushes past him and out to --*

      THE BEACH1515 *

      Boone isn t gonna be blown off.  Stays with Jack as he moves  *
      across the beach --*

                                  BOONE
                    You think you re all noble and 
                    heroic coming after me?  I was 
                    fine.  You re not the only one 
                    around here who knows what to do, 
                    man.  I run a business.  Who *
                    appointed you savior?  What gives 
                    you the right to...

      And although Boone continues his rant, his voice begins to 
      fall away.  Because Jack isn t looking at Boone anymore...

      He s looking over Boone s shoulder.  Because there s 
      something there.  No -- SOMEONE.

      OFF IN THE DISTANCE1616

      There on the TREE LINE.  Where beach meets jungle.

      The MAN IN THE SUIT and he s wearing WHITE TENNIS SHOES. *

      Too far away to discern the figure s identity.  Just standing 
      there.

      AND WE RE BACK WITH JACK1717

      Because he s not taking his eyes off the man this time.  He s 
      already walking away from Boone --

                                  BOONE
                          (shouts after him)
                    Hey -- Don t you walk away from me.  
                    Where the hell are you going?  HEY!

      But Jack is BREAKING INTO A RUN.  Eyes locked --

      ON THE TREE LINE1818

      Where the SUITED MAN turns around, heads INTO THE JUNGLE...

      AND JACK1919

      RUNS.  Stumbles in the sand -- but immediately regains his 
      footing.  SINGLE PURPOSE.  DESPERATE.




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST     "White Rabbit"     (PRODUCTION DRAFT)     8/4/04    21.
      (CONT'D):1919

      And we follow Jack ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE BEACH until he...


                                  MARGO (O.S.)*
                    He s gone, Jack.

      And we find JACK S REFLECTION in a window begin pummelled by 
      RAIN.  The Jack we know and love.  Same age as he is on the 
      island... and surprisingly, equally as RUN DOWN.

                                  JACK
                    He ll be back.

      And Jack turns away from the window to face --

      MARGO.  His MOTHER.  Late fifties.  A crisply put together  *
      woman.  All Blue blood.  STOIC.

                                  MARGO*
                    This time it s different.*

      Both stand in HIS FATHER S STUDY.  Not as imposing as it was 
      when Jack was boy -- But THE EMPTY LEATHER CHAIR is a 
      constant presence in every shot...

      Jack looks over a mantle of PHOTOGRAPHS -- All of SHEPHARD.  
      Catching a fish, receiving an award, giving a speech.  Jack 
      reaches to pick one up --

                                  MARGO*
                    Please don t touch that.



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST         "White Rabbit"        (BLUE)         8/6/04     23.
      (CONT'D):2222

      But Jack picks it up anyway.  Maybe DEFIANTLY.

                                  JACK
                    Ever notice there aren t any 
                    pictures of me in here?  Or you?

                                  MARGO
                          (simply)
                    It s his study.

                                  JACK
                    Yeah.

      Jack puts the photo back.  Just the sound of the RAIN for a 
      few beats.  Then --

                                  MARGO
                    I want you to bring him back.

                        JACKMARGO
          (shaking his head)
      That s good.  Yeah.  Me.
                                                  -- What?

                                  JACK
                    He hasn t talked to me in two 
                    months, man.

                      MARGOJACK
      You haven t talk to him in 
      two months.-- He doesn t want me to 
                                                  bring him back.  Trust me.  
                                                  Let one of his  friends ...

                                  MARGO
                    He doesn t have friends anymore.
                          (beat; pointed)
                    Why do you think that is?*

      Okay.  Starting to heat up a little here.  We re definitely 
      dropping in on some big time FAMILY SHIT -- and we don t need 
      to know exactly what it is to get the main idea -- WHATEVER 
      MADE HIS FATHER RUN OFF, JACK IS RESPONSIBLE FOR IT.

      Jack s eyes drop under his mother s GLARE.  Whatever it is 
      she s accusing him of, part of him is OWNING IT.  Then --

                                  MARGO
                    He was right about you.

      And that fucking hits a nerve.  Jack s eyes dart back up, 
      giving her a GLARE right back --




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST         "White Rabbit"        (BLUE)         8/6/04     24.

                                  JACK*
                    Right about what?

                                  MARGO
                    You don t understand the pressure 
                    he was under.  You --

                                  JACK
                    I understand pressure.

      Beat.  And Jack s eyes begin to water.  He s TRYING to hold 
      it together.  We re seeing the PAIN here...

      And damn if Margo doesn t see it too.  She actually SOFTENS.  
      Vulnerable --

                                  MARGO
                    Please -- You know how he gets.  He 
                      doesn t... he won t take care of 
                    himself.  You have to go after him.
                          (beat)
                    Please.*

    A moment.  ON JACK.  And this is hard from him to say, but --

                                  JACK
                    I m sorry.  I can t.

      And that vulnerability in Margo?  It is gone in a SECOND.

                                  MARGO
                     I can t?   You don t get to say  I 
                    can t.   Not after what you did.  *
                    Was it hard?  Betraying your own *
                    father?  Was that a tough decision?  *
                    Oh -- but you thought you were *
                    actually helping him, didn t you?   *
                    But you took it all away, you... *
                    You ruined him.  You did this.*
                          (as near rage as she gets)
                    You bring you father home, Jack.

      And whatever she s talking about -- whatever Jack  did  -- it 
      gets him.  A low blow... but a TRUE blow.  So finally --

                                  JACK
                    Where is he?

      Beat.

      THE COMPLETION OF THAT WILD SPINNING AS WE FINALLY REST ON --

      JACK.  And he s standing in the middle of a HOTEL ROOM.  
      Crisp.  Sharp.  LIFELESS.  This place is where fancy business 
      travellers might stay - A complete CONTRAST to the organic 
      jungle of the island.

      Jack stares at the KING-SIZED BED - It has not been slept in.

                                  HOTEL MANAGER
                    The maid says he hasn t used the 
                    bed in the past three days.

    A YOUNG HOTEL MANAGER stands a few feet behind Jack.  He 
      looks uncomfortable.  A clear AUSTRALIAN ACCENT.

      Jack wanders around the room.  Jack picks up a DIRTY BUTTON- *
      DOWN SHIRT neatly hanging over one of the chairs.  Runs his 
      finger over the collar --





                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST     "White Rabbit"     (PRODUCTION DRAFT)     8/4/04    29.
      (CONT'D):3030

                                  JACK
                    He rent a car through your 
                      concierge?

                                  HOTEL MANAGER
                    No, sir.

      Jack puts down the shirt.  Floats over to the DESK -- A 
      chaotic, ugly representation of his father s STATE OF MIND.

    A TORN MAGAZINE, MEDICATIONS, TICKETS, RECEIPTS, CIGARETTE 
      PACKETS.  Jack PULLS OPEN ONE OF THE DRAWERS --*

      INSIDE -- THREE mostly empty bottles of SCOTCH.  Jack 
      abruptly CLOSES the drawer.

                                  HOTEL MANAGER
                    Quite honestly, Mr. Shephard, I 
                    don t think he rented a car at all.

                                  JACK
                    Yeah?  Why s that?

                                  HOTEL MANAGER
                    There was an incident a few nights 
                    ago.  Here at the hotel bar.  I had 
                    to ask Security to escort your 
                    father to his room.

      Jack turns.  Maybe a little embarrassed.  Maybe a little 
      guilty.  But definitely a little ANGRY --

                                  JACK
                    What s that have to do with renting 
                    a car?

                                  HOTEL MANAGER
                    I m sorry.  I shouldn t have...

                        JACKHOTEL MANAGER
      C mon.  What s it have to do 
      with renting a car?-- Mr. Shephard...*

      The Hotel Manager shakes his hand.  He takes a BEAT.  Then -- *

                                  HOTEL MANAGER
                    I don t think any rental agent in 
                    Sydney would lease your father a 
                    car in his condition.

      Well.  There it is.  And Jack does not like hearing it.  NOT 
      AT ALL.  Takes a step towards the Manager --




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST     "White Rabbit"     (PRODUCTION DRAFT)     8/4/04    30.
      (CONT'D): (2)3030

                                  JACK
                    My father...
                          (holding it in but it s 
                          not fucking easy)
                    Is a Chief of Surgery.

      The Hotel Manager quickly realizes he s crossed the line --

                                  HOTEL MANAGER
                    Of course, sir.  I apologize.*

      And Jack is so fucking angry he wants to pound this guy, but 
      luckily his attention is diverted as --

      He spots something on the NIGHT STAND.  A WALLET.  Jack  *
      immediately crosses to it.  Picks it up.  Opens it --

      Cash.  Credit Cards.  Driver s License.  HIS FATHER S.

      Jack settles down onto the bed -- as if the AIR has been  *
      knocked out of him.  A few moments pass.  Then... softly -- *

                                  JACK*
                    He left his wallet.  Who leaves a 
                    wallet?

                                  HOTEL MANAGER*
                    Perhaps you should talk to the *
                    police, Mr. Shephard.*

      The Manager remains awkwardly in the center of the room, but 
      we re MOVING IN ON JACK -- his eyes full of DESPERATION.  As 
      he whispers softly to himself --

                                  JACK
                    Where are you?

      WE BLAST BACK OUT INTO --


      We find CLAIRE inside the shade of the infirmary tent.  She 
      NAPS... not looking too hot.  PALE.

                                  CHARLIE (O.S.)
                    Hey...

      Claire s eyes flutter open to see CHARLIE settling down next 
      to her.*

                                  CLAIRE
                          (disoriented)*
                    Hey.  How long have I...?

                                  CHARLIE
                    Couple hours.  Here -- it s not 
                    much, but it s what we have.

      Charlie offers her a small THERMOS CUP -- A little liquid 
      splashes inside.  Claire takes a grateful SIP --

                                  CLAIRE
                    I should get up...

      NO SHE SHOULDN T because another wave of DIZZINESS falls over 
      her.  Charlie immediately SUPPORTS her, nurturing instinct --

                                  CHARLIE
                    You just relax, yeah?
                          (smiles)
                    Got to think about the little one.*

      The dizziness passes as Claire eases back down on the 
      cushions --

                                  CLAIRE
                    Thanks for the water.

                                  CHARLIE
                    Yeah.  A whole swallow.
                          (somewhat darkly)
                    There d be more if some git hadn t 
                    nicked it.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Is Jack back yet?

                                  CHARLIE
                    No.  No one s seen him.
                          (seeing her concern)
                    Don t worry though -- good ole  Mr. 
                    Locke s gone into the jungle to get 
                    you some water.  Should be back 
                    before nightfall.





                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST         "White Rabbit"        (BLUE)         8/6/04     35.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Great.  Our only hunter s gonna get 
                    eaten so that he can get the 
                    pregnant girl some more water.

                                  CHARLIE
                    I wouldn t worry, love.
                          (smiles conspiratorially)
                    You tell me who d you rather meet 
                    in a dark alley -- whatever s out *
                    there, or that geezer and his four *
                    hundred knives?

      Claire actually begins to GIGGLE --

                                  CHARLIE
                      Seriously.  Who packs four hundred 
                    knives?  Personally?  I only have 
                    room for two hundred.  Three 
                    hundred, the most.

      The two share a nice LAUGH.  A real moment -- And then Claire 
      becomes serious.  Contemplative --

                                  CLAIRE*
                    When are they going to find us?  *
                    The rescuers?*

      Beat.*

                                  CHARLIE*
                    Soon.*

                                  CLAIRE
                          (smiles)*
                    Thanks, Charlie.

                                  CHARLIE
                    Thanks for what?

                                  CLAIRE
                    People don t look me in the eye 
                    here.  I think I scare them.  The 
                    baby...
                          (searching for the words)
                    I m like this time bomb of 
                      responsibility waiting to go off.

      Charlie considers this.  Then --

                                  CHARLIE
                    You don t scare me.

      And off this genuinely sweet MOMENT...


      FLAMES flicker in BLACK & WHITE.  PULL OUT to find them on a 
      small TELEVISION.  We re watching a local NEWS BRAODCAST. *

      JACK sits in a small chair in a spartan HALLWAY, watching the  *
        wall-mounted TV -- *




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST         "White Rabbit"        (BLUE)         8/6/04     45.
      (CONT'D):4646

                                  AUSTRALIAN NEWSCASTER (O.S.)
                    And wildfires continue to burn just 
                    outside Melbourne.  While local 
                    crews coordinate their efforts, an 
                    arson investigation is underway...

      And the NEWSCAST is interrupted as Jack looks up to see --

                                  DOCTOR (O.S.)
                    Mr. Shephard?  Will you follow me, 
                    please?

    A Middle-Eastern MAN in a white lab coat -- looks like a 
      DOCTOR.  And although we re not entirely sure why yet, Jack s 
      eyes make it clear -- he does not want to follow this man.  
      Not at ALL.


      JACK and THE DOCTOR walk along the corridor.  This place is 
      depressing - FLICKERING FLUORESCENT LIGHTS.  WORN PAINT JOB.

                                  DOCTOR
                    There are ways we can make it 
                    easier for you.  We can take a 
                      photograph if you d prefer...*

                                  JACK
                    No.  I want to see him.

      The two reach THREE STAINLESS STEEL DOORS -- FREEZERS.  The  *
      Doctor pulls open the middle one.*

      ON JACK, as he follows the Doctor--*

      INSIDE.A48A48 *

    A GURNEY waits.  ON IT,*

    A BODYBAG.*

      The Doctor looks at Jack one last time.*

      Then slowly, he pulls down the bag s zipper, revealing the  *
      body inside, and of course it s--*

      JACK S FATHER.*

      Just as he s appeared on the island.  Gray haired.  Sixties.  
      And completely lifeless.





                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST         "White Rabbit"        (BLUE)         8/6/04     45A.

                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST         "White Rabbit"        (PINK)         8/9/04     46.
      (CONT'D): (2)A48A48

                                  DOCTOR
                    I m very sorry.

                                  JACK
                    What happened?


                      DOCTORJACK
            (sympathetic)
      It s probably best not to -- What happened?
      know the details, Mr...

      And as the Doctor begins to speak, we HOLD ON JACK -- PUSHING 
      IN as every second brings more emotion.  A deeper sense of 
      pain and loss.  And it is fucking DEVASTATING to watch.

                                  DOCTOR (O.S.)
                    The police found him in an alley in 
                    Kings Cross.  There was no  *
                      identification, so they brought him 
                    here.  Our tox screen showed a 
                    blood alcohol content... which for 
                    a man of his size would most likely 
                    have brought on myocardial 
                      infarction -- a sizeable and fatal 
                    heart attack.
                          (best bedside manner)
                    If it s any consolation, it was 
                    painless.

      And now we are RIGHT UP on Jack s EYES.  And in this, the 
      single most devastating moment of his life, the last word 
      that comes to mind is  painless.   And as a SINGLE TEAR drops 
      from his eye...


      MOONLIGHT pierces through the obscured ceiling of this caved-
      in VALLEY, lighting Jack s way --

      And his father is nowhere to be seen.

      But Jack hears the sound of TRICKLING WATER.  Drawn to it --

      And here s a WALL OF WATER dripping into a SHALLOW POOL.  
      Jack approaches -- looks into it and --

      There s a small, pale FACE shimmering under the surface.  But 
      Jack seems more confused than scared as he reaches into the 
      water and pulls out --

    A CHINA FACED DOLL -- blonde hair, floral dress.  Jack lays 
      the doll down, walks deeper into THE VALLEY, his torchlight 
        illuminating the openings of a series of CAVES...

      And there are more dolls.  MANY MORE.  A TRAIL of them.  Jack 
      follows it, raising his flaming torch as he finally comes to 
      the source -- A SMASHED CRATE.  And right next to it --

    A fallen fifteen foot-long section of WRECKAGE from our 
      place.  The OCEANIC LOGO PROMINENT.

      All around this area of the valley; scattered pieces of  *
      LUGGAGE.  OF CARGO.  Jack looking it over...

      And then he FREEZES.

      Because there, at the edge of a cave, trapped partially under 
    a piece of wreckage is what looks like a LARGE BOX.

      And Jack is drawn to it.  THIS is why he s been led here.  
      THIS is what he s supposed to find.

      Yeah.  It s a COFFIN.

                                  END OF ACT THREE







                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST     "White Rabbit"     (PRODUCTION DRAFT)     8/4/04    48.


                                        ACT FOUR


      Jack stands right where we left him, in this moonlit cave-
      like VALLEY.

      And he s just FIXATED on that banged-up but surprisingly 
      intact SIMPLE WOODEN CASKET which lies FACE DOWN in the dirt.

      And this time, it s not Jack that we PUSH INTO, but that 
      coffin as we hear the sound of a PLANE TAKING OFF and --


      We re in SYDNEY AIRPORT.

      And here s Jack.  Wearing the very same SUIT we saw him 
      wearing in the Pilot.  He stands at the OCEANIC CUSTOMER 
      SERVICE COUNTER.  And he is fucking losing it.

                                  JACK
                    What do you mean you won t put it 
                    on the plane?

    A FEMALE AUSTRALIAN TICKET AGENT looks back at him --

                                  TICKET AGENT
                    I m sorry, Mr. Shephard, but our 
                    policy is that the body must have *
                    the proper documentation if we re *
                    to put it on board.  I m afraid *
                    there s no latitude to...

                        JACKTICKET AGENT
      No latitude?  No latitude?
                                                  -- Without the proper 
                                                    documents...

                        JACKTICKET AGENT
      You can t do this to me.  I m 
      read to go now...-- Sir, perhaps another 
                                                    carrier may...

                                  JACK
                          (enough)
                    NO!

      And he fucking SHOUTED THAT.  People standing around actually 
      look over, nervously.  But Jack could care less.  He leans in 
      to the DESK ATTENDANT, eyes burning --




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST     "White Rabbit"     (PRODUCTION DRAFT)     8/4/04    49.
      (CONT'D):5151

                                  JACK
                    I want you to listen to me, okay?  
                    Because I m asking you a favor...
                          (reads her name-tag)
                       Chrissy?   I am standing in front 
                    of you wearing the same suit I m 
                    wearing to my father s funeral and 
                    I m asking you a favor.
                          (beat)
                    In sixteen hours I need to land in 
                    LAX.  And I need that coffin to 
                    clear customs because there is 
                    going to be a hearse waiting there.  
                    And that hearse needs to take me 
                    and that coffin to a cemetery.  
                    Why, Chrissy?  Why can t I just 
                    land and bring him to a funeral 
                    home and make all the arrangements 
                    there?  Why can t I really take my 
                    time with it?  Because I need it to 
                    be done.  I need it to be over. *

      And Jack suddenly realizes he s YELLING.  Stops.  Pulls  *
      himself together.  But his eyes are watering.  And this is  *
      said softly, but not without desperation --*

                                  JACK
                    I just need to bury my father.

      And Chrissy is actually MOVED by this.  Affected by Jack s 
      pure emotion.  So after a beat, she NODS --

                                  TICKET AGENT
                    Let me see what I can do, sir.

      And as Jack finally registers some sense of RELIEF...


      We re back on the island.  In this valley.

      And Jack looks down at what we now know to be his FATHER S 
      CASKET.  Neither one of them made it to Los Angeles.

      But Jack has found it.  Been led to it.

      So now, finally, he ll get to bury his father himself.

      And as much as we don t want him to do it, we have to WATCH 
      HIM as he carefully slips his hand under the casket.





                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST     "White Rabbit"     (PRODUCTION DRAFT)     8/4/04    50.
      (CONT'D):5252

      Jack squats -- then with great STRAIN he manages to LIFT IT 
      UP - pushing it on to its side -- but OH FUCK -- the lid 
      FLIPS OPEN!

      BUT THE COFFIN IS EMPTY.

      Jack is confused.  Devastated.  And then, ultimately --

      DEPRIVED.

      Maybe the body fell out in the crash -- maybe it s still out 
      there in the jungle -- or maybe...

      But none of that matters now.  Because all of this pressure, 
      this anxiety, this fucking situation is all so UNFAIR.

      And that translates to pure RAGE for Jack... ANGER at not 
      being able to put this behind him... and ANGER at his father 
      for haunting him, even here...

      And Jack s pulling a METAL ROD from the wreckage, raising it 
      over his hand and he -- 

      SMASHES the coffin.  Over and over.  Into fucking splinters.

      And as we PULL BACK, leaving Jack to resolve his demons the 
      only way he knows how...


      CLAIRE as she lies asleep.  She s alone.  We re looking down 
      at her.  No -- SOMEONE S LOOKING DOWN AT HER and...

    A bottle of WATER is brought to her chapped lips.  Claire s 
      eyes flicker open as the cool liquid flows into her mouth.  
      Someone has come to her rescue!  And Claire looks up to see 
      her benefactor is...

      BOONE?

      He offers an awkward smile -- screws the cap on the remainder 
      of the bottle, places another FULL ONE by her side...

                      CLAIREBOONE
      How did you...?
                                                  -- Shhhh.




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST     "White Rabbit"     (PRODUCTION DRAFT)     8/4/04    51.
      (CONT'D):5454

      And we don t get much of a chance to put this all together 
      because a VOICE from the entrance of the tent snaps us out of 
      this quiet moment --

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                    Where did you get that?!

      WHIP AROUND TO REVEAL --

      CHARLIE.  And he ain t happy.
