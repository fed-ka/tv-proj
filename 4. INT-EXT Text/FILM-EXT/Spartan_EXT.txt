We see the drawn face of a young woman. Camera tracks with
her as she runs through the thick woods. She is exerting
herself heavily as she moves up a steep hillside. She looks
behind her quickly, and continues.
ANGLE, we see a young man, and then another, running through
the woods, out of breath. They are dressed in filthy BDU's,
and show several days growth of beard. The leader stops for
a moment, and looks around. The two men separate.
ANGLE, the
young woman, who has come to a small ledge, over
a ravine.
She stops, panting, and bends over, to attempt to
catch her
breath. She looks around, and looks back, her back
to a steep
wall, a steep drop before her.
ANGLE, the first young man, having come up to the spot
vacated by the young woman. In the BG we see his colleague.
He looks down, and sees movement in the brush below him, in
the ravine. He starts to descend, and then looks up.
ANGLE, the young woman, pulling herself up the steep
rockface. The young man regains the ledge and looks up.
Camera takes him around a bend in the ledge.
Standing here we discover ROBERT SCOTT. He is somewhat older
than the two men, he is very fit, also dressed in filthy
BDU's. He is making a note in a small notebook, which he
closes. Now, the two men look across the ravine at the young
woman, seen disappearing over a ridge.
SCOTT
(quietly)
...you better catch her...
The man looks around, and begins climbing up the rockface
behind him, pulling himself up, hand over hand by the roots
of trees. Several feet up, he falls on his back. He tries to
work himself to his knees and winces in pain. He looks to
Scott for help.
SCOTT
...your Dad's napping on the
sofa, your Mom's watching Let's
Make A Deal, and God is Dead.
What do you expect me to do...?
YOUNG MAN
(very weakly)
...I'm tired, Sir...Sir, there's
no way...
2.
SCOTT
There's always a way...Don't You
tell me there's no way...
A pause, as the man tries again to get to his feet. Scott
looks up at the young woman on top of the ridge and gives
her a "hold" gesture. She stops, at his command. Scott nods,
as if to himself, and then kicks the young man in the ribs.
The man starts, his eyes grow, and he gets to his feet.
SCOTT
How 'bout that? That's called
'Adrenaline'. You said you Wanted
In.
He moves into the now-standing young man, and hits him, not
heavily, but convincingly, several times.
SCOTT
This is where you get in. The
mugger don't care. The shooter
don't care...get up...Or I will
beat you to death on this fucken
hill...Now: you better Catch her...
He motions with his head. In the BG we see the young woman
nod, and begin running again. We see her, for a moment,
breast a hill, and disappear again...
ANGLE, on the young man, as he looks at Scott, empty, now,
of self-pity, as if he just realized something.
SCOTT
(responding to his look.
As if to say "That's right.")
There's nothing but the mission...
The young man begins to climb the rockface.
HOLD on Scott for a moment.
Scott, showered, in civilian clothes, a lumberjacket and
jeans, comes out of the building, carrying a small, yellow
duffle-bag. He opens the trunk.
He takes the yellow bag, and puts it into the trunk which we
now see contains woodworking tools - old levels and planes
and saws. He closes the trunk. We see the young woman from
the first sequence, now in civilian clothes, conferring with
a colleague. She nods at him, and he responds. As he starts
to get into the car. A squad of exhausted men is marching
past. As they come to a halt one of the men turns in the
direction of Scott.
DRILL INSTRUCTOR
(to that man)
What the hell are you looking at?
There ain't nobody there...
A young worker in a hardhat, by a large gravel pit, at which
we find several earthmovers, idle. He is standing by a high
chainlink fence topped with barbed wire.
ANGLE HIS POV. Some half-mile away, the Mustang, heading in
his direction on a rough road. The young worker opens the
lock on the chainlink fence and swings it open.
We see a sign "McGarrity Construction Company" on the gate.
The young man walks back toward a construction trailer. We
see a red light blinking on a telephone on top of a littered
desk. The young worker enters the trailer hurriedly, and
opens a cabinet which we see contains several assault rifles,
and grenades. Another phone, its red light blinking, is
found in the cabinet. The young worker picks up this phone
quickly.
YOUNG WORKER
(into phone)
...Frontgate...
We see his face grow serious, as he begins to write on a pad.
and get, inquisitively, out of the car. We see the young
worker run up to him and hand him a sheet of paper. Scott
takes the paper and begins to read.
He looks up, to ask a question of the young worker. We see
the worker begin to respond, his body language saying
"That's all I know." As he starts to speak his words are
drowned out by the sound of a helicopter. Scott looks up.
ANGLE HIS POV. A helicopter, flying low.
Seen through the windshield of a car.
ANGLE, a black, government Suburban pulls outside the
boathouse. We see scaffolding being erected outside the main
entrance.
10.
Scott and several types in suits get out of the Suburban,
and proceed toward the door, over which is hung a large,
paint-spattered drape. A sign on a stanchion reads
"Temporarily Closed For Repairs".
Two students, walking through the yard. They acknowledge a
uniformed security guard, who walks, with his back to us.
A slight, Asian young woman, her arms full of books, walks
toward the camera, hurrying. She indicates something, back
over her shoulder, and the guard, who is in front of the
camera, walking away, veers off in that direction.
19.
A young man (MICHAEL BLAKE) is, furtively, working on
jimmying open one of a set of mailboxes. He senses something,
and turns.
ANGLE HIS POV. The Security Guard (Scott) standing just
beyond a glass door, looking in at him. Scott enters, coming
to camera.
SCOTT
Could I see your hands, son...?
The Boy, Blake, moves his hands away from his body, to show
a screwdriver. Scott motions him away from the mailbox,
which we see is in the process of being demolished. Scott
reads the name on the mailbox.
SCOTT
L. Newton.
(pause)
You lose your mailbox key, Mr.
Newton...?
(pause)
BLAKE
Um.
SCOTT
You a student here?
BLAKE
Yes.
SCOTT
Could I see some identification,
please...? Mr. Newton?
(Scott takes out a
walkie and begins to
talk into it)
Ten-Twelve patrol, requesting...
BLAKE
No, please...please...
(pause)
Please, Oh, God.
He starts to advance on Scott, who draws a nightstick, and
keeps him at bay.
SCOTT
Calm down, Son. It's gonna be
what it's gonna be...
20.
BLAKE
One minute, could I please talk
to you for one minute...Look
look look: I broke up with My
Girlfriend...
with a male friend, pass in front of the vestibule. Beyond
them we see Blake and Scott, as Blake motions to the mailbox,
and moves to the mailbox and takes out a letter.
Blake and Scott sitting on a bench in the deserted yard.
Scott holds the envelope and the letter, on which we see
this symbol %-) and begin to read: "This is a sham. Your
view of the world is not cockeyed, but corrupt. You cunt.
And you deserve everything that is going to happen to you..."
BLAKE
...I was just...trying to
retrieve the letter.
ANGLE, on Scott, as he looks at the letter.
SCOTT
...this is not very nice language.
(pause, Blake looks away)
How old is this girl?
BLAKE
She's...just turned 18.
(Scott shakes his head,
sadly. pause)
I was mad.
SCOTT
(of the letter:)
..."everything that's going to
happen to her"...What was going
to happen to her?
(pause)
You hurt her...?
(pause)
Did y'hit her, son...?
BLAKE
Hit her? No. I...
(he gestures to the note)
I called her...I called her a
whore...I...
SCOTT
Why...?
23.
The boy bangs his head. Scott, as he rises, brings Blake to
his feet.
SCOTT
(as if realizing "This
is the question")
Where is she?
BLAKE
(as if the question
had not occurred to
him previously)
She must...she must...she must
have gone home...
SCOTT
Why...?
BLAKE
(gesturing around, quietly)
Because the Secret Service, isn't...
As they walk by a parked van, we cut inside the van. Where
we see a Secret Service type. Through the windshield we see
Scott gesture "Do Not Intervene."
ANGLE, on Scott and Blake, as they walk down the near-
deserted Mass Ave.
SCOTT
(of the sign on the
letter,the "Picasso"
sign, that is %-}. He
turns the sign
rightside up to show
it is a 'cockeyed smile')
What is this sign?
BLAKE
It's how she signs her letters.
(smiles)
Cause she looks at everything
cockeyed...Like Picasso - she
said they called her "Picasso".
(pause)
SCOTT
Who called her that...?
24.
BLAKE
You know, her, her...
(remembering)
He saw her yesterday! Maybe
she's...maybe she's with him!
SCOTT
Why'd you fight with her, Son...?
BLAKE
(pause)
She, uh, she got her hair
done...She cut it off. She dyed
it blonde. I said she looked
like a slut...and...
(pause)
SCOTT
Beautiful young girl like that.
We've all seen her pictures.
What'd you care how she dyed her
hair?
(pause)
What'd you care...? Why's that
make her a slut...?
(pause)
BLAKE
She...
(pause)
Uh...
SCOTT
She seeing another fella...?
(as he moves closer, confidingly)
...just between us. Off-the-
record, son...
25.
SCOTT
I know that nothing hurts worse
than that. She seeing another
guy...?
BLAKE
I...
(pause)
There's this, um...Teacher...I
shouldn't, I, I shouldn't tell
you this: She...
SCOTT
She sleeping with a teacher...?
BLAKE
She says she isn't. I said she
looked like a slut. She wants to
fuck old guys, she should go to
The Regency. Go all the Way.
SCOTT
The Regency, what's that?
BLAKE
(as if everyone knows
this place)
S'the Club, by the Fenway...it's
like a joke at school, it's like
a rumor: this or that girl, made
a thousand bucks, went with a
businessman for One Night...
Look: it's a Lover's Quarrel. I
said something I regret. I sent
her a note which I regret, and I
assure, you, Officer. If...
(pause)
If you would...
ANGLE. From inside the windshield of the van we see, through
their body language, that Scott is "giving the boy a break",
the boy is very thankful. Scott is admonishing him and the
boy is contrite. Now Scott begins to walk away, and we see
him minutely, signal to the van, we see the driver of the
van pick up a phone and speak softly into it.
ANGLE, Scott, walking down a sidestreet. The boy in the BG,
we see the young Asian girl, take up a tailing position some
half-block back of the boy, as a car glides to the curb. And
Scott gets in.
ANGLE, tight on Scott in the car, as he rubs his eyes,
beyond exhaustion. The car pulls away.
26.
He gives several instructions to the young man driving, and
then leans back, eyes closed. He opens his eyes again, and
we see him mouth, insistently, "The Regency". The driver nods.
A garish neon sign, beneath which we see a couple exiting,
getting into their limo. Scott, in his sportcoat, walks up
to the large and threatening bouncer at the velvet rope to
the club. We see the bouncer bar his way, and gesture to his
watch, meaning "closing up".
ANGLE INS. Two one-hundred dollar bills are passed to the
bouncer.
ANGLE, Anton, in a cab across the street, looking on.
A large Mercedes is parked outside on the quiet street. A
chauffeur reads the paper, he half turns, sleepily, at the
sight of a man walking across the street.
ANGLE Scott and Anton pulling up in a Camaro.
coming out of a side entrance, adjusting his clothes as he
walks. As Scott walks nearby - we take him to a garbage pail,
where he retrieves a small black bag - that is, as used to
transport dog shit. He walks up.
ANGLE, on Anton, getting out of the Camaro. Behind him,
around the corner, we see a dark van pull up. Anton motions
the van to hold.
38.
ANGLE, on Scott. As he walks up toward the Businessman,
holding the black bag. He whistles once or twice for his dog,
and then turns to see the Businessman.
SCOTT
...beautiful night...
BUSINESSMAN
(nods)
'Less you got hayfever...
(he gestures at the
flowering trees)
Scott walks up to him, and pushes him back into the vestibule.
ANGLE TIGHT on Scott as he flicks open his switchblade, and
holds his knife up to the Businessman's throat and whispers.
SCOTT
...you left something back inside.
Beat. The Businessman looks frantically around, beyond him
we see Anton taking his Chauffeur out of the car. The
Businessman turns to the intercom and pushes a button. We
hear a female voice answer, after a beat, "...yes...?"
ANGLE on Anton, holding a machine pistol, behind a corner of
the wall.
BUSINESSMAN
...I left my case inside.
There is a beat. And the far door in the vestibule is buzzed
open. As it opens several men in Swat gear stream through
the vestibule and up the stairs. Scott hands the Businessman
over to an Agent, who takes charge of him, and camera holds
on Scott, standing, wearily, at the bottom of the stairs.
He motions for Anton near him to hand him a cigarette. Anton
does so. Scott lights up. From the top of the stairs we hear
screams, sounds of breaking, yells, commands being shouted.
Beat. An Agent comes to the top of the stairs, looks down,
and shakes his head. Beat. Scott turns and finds the
handcuffed Businessman in his field of vision.
SCOTT
...they got some young girls up
there...?
Beat. The Businessman, terrified, is silent. Scott holds out
the photo of the girl in the black hair.
39.
SCOTT
You see this girl...?
(pause)
The Businessman looks at the photo. Scott gestures at Anton,
and passes the photo of Laura Newton to Anton. And then
looks as if to say "In or Out?" Anton hesitates a moment,
and then strikes the Businessman.
ANTON
Did you See This Girl...?
ANGLE on the Businessman, on the ground. Terrified. He looks
back at Scott, as if unable to focus. Scott gives him a beat,
nods, as if to say, "What would you expect", and starts up
the stairs.
In the foreground we see a lonely payphone in the deserted
square. It is festooned with ads for escort services. In the
deep background we see the lights on in a corner bank
building, and the cleaners at work.
Scott, in the backseat of a car, apparently asleep. Anton,
sitting in the front. Listening to the faint sounds from an
earwig.
ANGLE, XCU. Scott, his head tilted back, looking through
almost fully closed eyelids.
SCOTT
...who's walking up on us...?
ANGLE, Anton, as he looks around, down at Scott, and then up,
at a man in a suit, some thirty yards away, walking towards
the car.
Anton, as the man draws closer, looks down at Scott, as if
to say "How did you know"?
SCOTT
(as he loosens his
jacket, over his pistol)
...who is he?
ANTON
Boston. P.D.
We see Scott, relax for a moment. And then, putting Anton
out of his misery.
SCOTT
...always a reflective surface...
(then, to himself, as
if reciting a litany)
"...in the city, always a
reflection. In the Woods. Always
a sound..."
HOLD. On Anton, as he digests this. BEAT.
ANTON
...and in the Desert?
SCOTT
You don't want to go into the
desert.

53.
Scott and Anton, in the sedan. Anton listening on the
earpiece. Anton brightens.
ANTON
...they're moving...
Anton starts to put the car in gear, an Agent comes jogging
down the street, out of an alley, and motions Anton aside,
and gets into the car.
A shot of the helicopter, flying over the highway.
ANGLE, the sedan speeding down the deserted highway, the
city in the background. The helicopter, flying away overhead.
The margin of the scrubwoods, in the dunes. Scott and Anton,
moving quietly through the woods. Scott points to Anton,
indicating where he should stop.
ANGLE, Scott's POV. A run-down beach house on a deserted
cove. The blue light of a television flickering through the
window.
ANGLE, Scott peering through some scrubgrass. We see he
holds a small handful of torn-off grass before and over his
face, to break up his outline. He turns. To Anton, who
stands next to him, holding a sniper rifle. He points out a
position to Anton.
ANTON
...you want me to Come Through
the Door...?
SCOTT
(as he checks his
weapons. He shakes his head.)
Don't you go through the door
without an Overwatch.
He takes the small handful of grass and throws it into the
air, watching the way the wind takes it. Scott gestures to
Anton to take up a position beside a small run-down boat shed.
56.
We see Anton do so, then Scott moves across the dunes, to a
small skiff. Which lies just across a little cove from the
beach house.
ANGLE, on Scott, as he moves down the dune, to the skiff. He
opens his switchblade quietly, and severs the line holding
the skiff to the dock. He gets into the skiff, and pushes it
off, and we see it begin to drift across the little cove
toward the beach house.
ANGLE, on Anton, kneeling, beside the old boat shed, as he
assumes a prone position, and sights his rifle in on the
beach house.
ANGLE, HIS POV. Through the sniperscope, the house, the
television, flickering in an empty living room.
see the scene in green, through a sniperscope.
ANGLE, on Anton, looking through the scope.
ANGLE CU Anton, as he sees something in the scope.
ANGLE, in the house. Scott advancing toward the man.
SCOTT
...I just wannit to know, I just
came to ask you that question...
The man backs up, past a half-open glass French door.
ANGLE, on Scott, as he advances toward the man.
ANGLE, ANTON'S POV. Through the sniperscope. The faint
traces of what might be the Picasso symbol.
ANGLE, on Anton, as we see him move the sniperscope and
adjust its magnification toward the symbol. In a corner of
the scope, we see another man, in a dirty white shirt,
emerge, coming up the stairs from what might be the basement
of the beach house. We see this man take in the scene in the
next room, and secrete himself behind a wall.
58.
ANGLE, on Anton, whose vision is blocked - Camera takes him
to a position next to the white tool shed.
Scott, moving toward the Sedan Man, unaware of the man
around the corner.
ANGLE through the sniperscope. We see the man in the white
shirt ready himself behind the opening through which Scott
will come. We see him raise a pistol.
ANGLE Anton, as he realizes he is behind the curve. As the
man in the white shirt steps into the doorway Anton fires at
him through the sniperscope. We see this man fall.
A Police Cruiser coming quickly down a two-lane, deserted road.
restaurant. Off to the side we see the cruiser coming down
the road. As a roughly-dressed man runs out of the restaurant,
carrying a full paper bag in his hand. The Cruiser, unseen
by the man, pulls up to the gas pump, and the Trooper starts
to get out of the driver's seat. When gunfire erupts from
the restaurant. People are shooting at the fleeing man. A
man opens the door of the restaurant and fires at the
roughly-dressed man in a very urban leather jacket, who
returns fire. Glass breaks in the windows of the restaurant.
The roughly-dressed man runs to his car, an 80's Pontiac,
parked near the pumps. The man in the doorway fires again,
and the windshield of the Pontiac blows out and a tire
bursts. The roughly-dressed man returns fire, and the man in
the doorway falls. The roughly-dressed man turns to see that
the Trooper is out of his Cruiser, and is about to fire at
him. The roughly-dressed man drops his satchel, and fires at
the Trooper, who falls.
The paper bag has fallen to the ground and burst, and
currency is spilling out of it, and being taken on the wind.
The roughly-dressed man frantically begins to try to scoop
it up and into his jacket.
ANGLE CU on this man, who we now see is SCOTT. He stands
around, and moves to the fallen Trooper. He strips the keys
from the Trooper's keyring, and looks up. Feeling someone
gazing at him.
ANGLE HIS POV. In the car, two convicts, a Heavyset Man and
ELI ASSANI, the middle-eastern man we saw in the mugshot. He
is holding his neck, which is bleeding copiously.
63.
We see the back window behind him, shattered by gunfire.
ANGLE on Scott, who gets into the car, takes the keys he
took from the Trooper, and begins screaming off down the
highway.
LOW ANGLE, showing the car taking a turn vastly too fast,
the car careens up on two wheels, rights itself, fishtails,
corrects, and disappears in the distance.
fifty yards beyond a turnoff onto a dirt road. The car is
put in gear, backs up, and takes the road.
The car comes quickly up a small farm road, we see a run-
down barn, and a farmhouse, washing on the line. Scott pulls
the car into the barn, next to an old pick-up truck. He gets
out of the car, we hear Assani in the backseat calling to him.
ANGLE, Scott, as he turns to Assani, who is pressing a
blood-soaked shirt to his neck. Calling "Help me".
Scott opens the back door of the Cruiser, and the Heavyset
Man gets out, and offers his manacled hands for release.
Scott motions to Assani.
SCOTT
...drag him out...
(the man does so. Scott
motions for them to be quiet)
...got some business to do...
He takes his pistol and walks toward the farmhouse.
HOLD on Assani, and the other Convict, Assani is holding a
rag to his bleeding neck.
ASSANI
...help me...
HEAVYSET CONVICT

drying clothes, he is seen to go into the house. We hear a
woman's scream, and then two shots are fired.

camera, toward the Mustang.
SCOTT
...would be most grateful, sir,
to be included on the mission.
"At Such Time..."
(pause)
BLANE
...on a mission to Dubai.
79.
SCOTT
Is it in contemplation, sir...?
(pause)
ANGLE, on Blane, who looks at him to say "you know better
than to ask."
SCOTT
Yes, sir.
(pause)
If and When, Sir...
BLANE
You need a rest, Bobby.
(pause. as he extends
his hand)
Thank you, Bobby...
Scott puts down the small yellow duffle he carries, next to
his Mustang. The young man who drove it in stands by, as
Blane and Scott shake hands. Scott looks at the training
facility.
ANGLE HIS POV. The lecturer, executing unarmed combat moves
against a trainee, who holds a knife. The lecturer puts the
trainee on his back.
Scott starts to walk toward this facility. He stands outside,
by an open double-door, next to a water cooler, and draws
himself a cup of water, which he drinks. As he watches the
lesson.
He turns back, as he sees the young man who drove in the
Mustang pick up the yellow duffle, to put it into the car.
SCOTT
...please don't touch that.
(Scott picks up the
duffle and puts the
strap over his shoulder)
ANGLE, Scott's POV, as he turns. We see the young female
sergeant, Jackie Black, in the BG, walking across the area.
Scott nods at her. She nods back. Scott starts to get into
his car, and then turns back.
ANGLE. SCOTT'S POV as the trainee on the mat gets up, and
the lecturer gestures at the knife he has dropped on the mat.
LECTURER
...pick it up.
80.
The trainee picks up the knife. The lecturer shakes his head.
LECTURER
What are you studying here...?
I'm talking to you, son... What
are you studying?
TRAINEE
Sir, this Candidate is studying
knife fighting.
The lecturer pauses, looking down at the ground. Beat.
LECTURER
Hold your ground, son.
The Trainee goes into a knife fighting stance.
LECTURER
(pointing behind him)
...you, and your friend...
The Trainee lets his attention drift for a second, in the
direction the Lecturer has pointed. And the Lecturer screams,
steps in, disarms the Trainee, throwing him to the mat. As
the Trainee picks himself up the Lecturer turns to the class.
LECTURER
There are two ways to fight, you
can fight fair, or you can fight
to win.
The Trainee puts his hand to his head, and discovers he is
bleeding. The Lecturer nods his permission, and the Trainee
walks to a water cooler, next to which Scott is standing.
Scott looks at the shamed Trainee.
SCOTT
Don't you study knife fighting,
son. You Learn to Kill. And then,
f'you meet some other fellow,
studied knife fighting, you send
him to hell.
ANGLE, on the Lecturer, who calls another Trainee up.
LECTURER
Next man:
A Trainee stands.
LECTURER
Now: I want to see some evil intent.
81.
The Lecturer glances at Scott, and makes a small "have a
drink" gesture. The Lecturer nods back "yes". Scott walks
toward his car.
The man inside the "construction booth" raises the barrier,
and looks at Scott, who drives through.
A three-store town, a couple of pick-up trucks parked in
front of the country store. A large double log truck goes
through the town. The girl looks for some topic of
conversation, to bridge the awkward moment.
GIRL
...it's an odd knife.
SCOTT
Yeah. I got it from a Russian
fellow.
GIRL
Was it a gift...?
SCOTT
No. As I remember, he seemed
rather reluctant to part with it.
(pause)
It's just a knife.
A three store town. A couple of pickup trucks parked in
front of the country store. Scott's Mustang parked next to
them. A large, filled, double-length log truck speeds
through the village. Scott, in his lumber jacket, is
assembling various maintenance items on the checkout counter.
A large paintbrush, several boxes of nails, a gallon of
paint. The Proprietor, a good-natured fellow in his fifties,
comes up to the counter to check Scott out.
85.
PROPRIETOR
How you been, John...?
SCOTT
...workin hard...
PROPRIETOR
...bet you have...
SCOTT
How you, Billy...?
Proprietor pours Scott a cup of coffee from the pot on the
back counter. He mixes in sugar and cream. Billy nods in
response to Scott's question.
PROPRIETOR
...one gallon goin to do it...?
SCOTT
(pointing at him accusingly)
...you been lookin' at my house...?
PROPRIETOR
Nope, just trine a sell you some

down in front of Scott.
Joking)
...but, now you mention it...
ANGLE, On Billy, as he moves to a new customer, a farmer,
who comes in, and nods at Scott.
NEW FARMER
...John...
SCOTT
Mr. Reese, how are you...?
(Billy goes to take
care of the new
customer, and turns
back to deal with Scott,
who is waiting to ask
a question)
That new saw blade come in?
BILLY
(as if just remembering)
No, John. It did not. I beg your
pardon. I know that's your
baby...I'm gone call them up and
get Right On That.
86.
ANGLE on Scott, who sees something out the window, and moves
toward the front of the store.
BILLY
(as an afterthought)
...'spected you back a few days
ago...
SCOTT
(looking out the window,
absently)
I took the Long Way Home.
ANGLE Scott, who is looking, over his coffee, at something
on the street. And we see, his POV, a very city rent-a-car
which is now across the street. We see a man getting out of
the car.
We see the back of a man, next to the rental car, which is
next to the Mustang. He turns, and we see that it is Anton,
his arm in a slig, his face creased by pellet scars.
ANGLE, his POV. Looking at Scott, who has just snuck up
behind him.
SCOTT
Could I see your Right Hand,
please...?
ANTON
There's nothing in my right hand.
SCOTT
Could I see it, please...?
Anton holds up his right hand. Scott relaxes, and comes
forward. Anton gestures, meaning, "what was that about"?
Scott takes Anton's right hand, by the wrist, and turns it
over. He explains:
SCOTT
You put your wedding ring back on.
ANTON
(not understanding the
import of the question)
...yes...?
87.
SCOTT
Then I have to guess you're not
"on assignment".
(pause)
You're in the wrong place, baby.
(pause)
How did you find me...?
Anton gestures at the "Oilchange" sticker on the Mustang's
windshield.
Anton and Scott walking down the street.
ANTON
I saw the sign.
SCOTT
"You saw the sign". You were up
for a week, you coulda seen Jack
Ruby, you don't know what you
saw...your first-time-out.
ANTON
I saw the sign.
SCOTT
...then, you tell me: you saw
the sign, how is it, they found
the girl, the DNA...why would
they do that...? Her father? Her
father would do that to her?
ANTON
...maybe he doesn't know...
88.
SCOTT
Well. You're living in a
fairyland of your Own Devising.
You're seeing snakes.
(pause)
ANTON
Who's going to Dubai...?
(pause. Scott hesitates)
They've got a white slave ring,
in Dubai, with American girls
there - are they going in?
(pause)
Are they sending you in...?
(pause)
Ask them...
(pause)
SCOTT
You Got. To Leave it for your
Betters.
ANTON
Ask them.
SCOTT
Why would you want to know?
(pause)
Listen up, Pal. THEY don't go
through the door. WE don't ask
why. That's not a COST, it's a
Benefit. Because we Got to Travel
Light. You wanna lose sleep over
it, get over it, or get out.
(hold. pause)
You wanted to go Through the
Looking Glass. How was it? Was
it more fun than Miniature Golf...?
ANTON
I want a favor.
SCOTT
Why would I do you a favor?
Two old ladies come down the small main street.
OLD LADY
Morning, John, who's your friend...?
SCOTT
Fella wants to buy my car.
89.
The old ladies walk on. Pause.
ANTON
I saved your life.
SCOTT
Well what were they paying you
for...?
ANTON
Bobby, I saw the Sign...
SCOTT
My name ain't Bobby.
(pause)
ANTON
I saw the sign.
(he draws the Picasso
sign in the dust on
the window of the
country store)
I Saw it. At the beach house.
(pause)
I'm going back.
SCOTT
Back?
ANTON
To the beach house.
SCOTT
They took it apart with a
tweezers.
(Anton shakes his head)
ANTON
She was there. The Girl was There.
I'm going back.
(pause)
I want you to do something.
SCOTT
What would that be?
ANTON
The Secret Service Agent. Offed
himself.
SCOTT
...he was off boffing his girl.
90.
ANTON
He shot himself with a hide-out
pistol.
SCOTT
Yeah?
ANTON
Who frisked the sonofabitch?
(pause)
You ask them.
ANGLE, on Scott, obviously off-balanced by the question. Hold.
A small photograph on an easel - it is an image of Gaines,
the dead Secret Serviceman.
ANGLE, a small funeral. A Marine Honor Guard in attendance.
Small suburban cemetery.
ANGLE on the Pastor.
PASTOR
...in the Service. In the Service
of his Country. No less than had
he died in Combat. George Gaines,
a man who gave his life to
service, to protecting those who...
ANGLE, an unmarked sedan. Scott, and a Driver. Looking on.
93.
DRIVER
...sucker did the Dutch.
SCOTT
I heard it was a training accident.
DRIVER
Nope, he Ate the Gun. Didn't you
know?
SCOTT
I've been out of town.
DRIVER
Punched out early, off with the
girlfriend, his Principal wanders
off, winds up dead: hari-kari...
ANGLE, on Scott, as he sees something. Scott takes a book of
matches and starts to light a cigarette.
DRIVER
...rather you didn't smoke in here.
Scott gets out of the car.
ANGLE, on Scott, who takes out the Anton "Rogers Rangers"
card. He motions the driver to pass him a phone and Scott
looks at the number on the card and dials.
Beyond him we see, just at the limits of the gravesite.
Holding himself apart. A young man in a raincoat. The young
man turns at the sound of a limo driving up.
ANGLE Scott, looking at the limo. Out of the limo, which
stops near the grave, we see Burch emerge. There is a
susurrus among the crowd, which, visibly, straightens a bit,
at the honor of Burch's presence. We see Burch walk to the
gravesite, and have a word with the widow. Burch puts his
hands on her shoulders and comforts her.
ANGLE, on Scott, looking at the man in the raincoat. We hear
rifle fire, and Scott flinches.
ANGLE his POV. The Marine Honor Guard, rendering a salute.
We see a Marine bear the flag to Burch, who presents it to
the widow. He shakes several hands, and then moves off, back
to the limousine. He beckons Scott over to him.
ANGLE, Scott and Burch, walking through the cemetery. Burch
shakes his head. He hands Scott the program from the funeral,
and reluctantly begins.
94.
BURCH
I put myself in your hands.
Didn't I...?
SCOTT
I do not follow you, sir.
BURCH
I reached out to you.
(pause)
I put my life into your hands. I
entered into a conspiracy with
you. To commit Murder. Because
it needed to be done.
(pause)
I trusted you with my life.
SCOTT
I would never betray you, sir.
BURCH
(waving his assurances away)
I trusted you with my life. And
yet you cannot trust me.
(pause)
There are things you have not
been told. That's right.
(pause)
And now you're all out-of-line,
"Play me or trade me..."
(pause)
ANGLE, on the two.
BURCH
(almost as if against
his better nature)
There is an Arab World. To
penetrate it makes trying to
join the Mafia look like a walk
in the park. How would you do it,
Scott?
(pause)
We're dying. We're at war. And
we have no intelligence. How
Would you do it? How would you
infiltrate their clan structure?
Where is the interface?
(pause)
It's at the whorehouse. That's
where they go to get frisky, and
that's where we listen to them.
(MORE)
95.
BURCH (CONT'D)
For the few, priceless hints
that we get from that fucking
sandpile.
(pause)
Had the girl been there, we would
have moved heaven and earth -
you know we would, and, we would
have got her out. She was not
there. She got drugged up and
fell off a boat, and drowned.
She's dead.
(of the funeral)
That man,
(Burch gestures at the
photograph-on-the-
easel, of George Gaines,
the Secret Service man,
which stands by the
head of the grave)
That man a sworn office of the
Secret Service, went to get laid,
and she died. And you are risking
the lives of men and women in
the field, because you won't
take orders. How are you better
than him? Yes. You had best look
sheepish. What the fuck have you
got to say?
SCOTT
No excuse, sir.
BURCH
You're goddam right.
(pause)
Now: where's this new kid who
got you all bothered. Where's
your partner?
SCOTT
...I'll call him off.
BURCH
The fuck you will. You've got
nothing to say to him. He's gone
to the ground. Where is he...?
ANGLE. Over the Honor Guard, packing up, we see Scott hand a
scrap of paper to Burch, who makes one or two more points,
to which Scott nods, submissively. Burch walks off. Camera
follows the Honor Guard, down the path, toward Scott, who,
passing, nods at them.
96.
HOLD on Scott. As he watches the widow, at the gravesite,
being walked away to a limo by the pastor. He feels someone
behind him and turns.
ANGLE, SCOTT'S POV. A man in a raincoat, standing furtively,
half-hidden by a tree, some distance off from the funeral,
weeping. He holds a program for the funeral.
ANGLE on the man in the raincoat, the funeral beyond him. He
is obviously distraught, a rather slight young man in his
thirties. He looks at Scott for a moment, and then turns away.
ANGLE. On Scott. As he turns back to watching the end of the
funeral. As the gravediggers begin their work. He sighs. And
moves to a bench and sits. Looking at the gravediggers.
DISSOLVE.
Scott, still sitting on the bench. The gravediggers,
finishing their work, begin to walk off, joking with one
another. Scott stands, and turns, about to start out of the
cemetery. He stops for a moment.
ANGLE, HIS POV. The man in the raincoat, who is standing
where last seen, looking at the burial. Walks toward the
mound of earth, pauses for a moment, and then walks off.
THE CEMETERY. DAY.
The raincoat man is standing waiting for a bus, at the bus
stop, outside a working man's tavern.
ANGLE, on Scott, looking at the man, still weeping. Scott
walks up to the man. Each holds a copy of the program from
the funeral. The man looks down at the program, and then up
to Scott.
SCOTT
(beat)
Terrible thing.
(the man nods)
Did you know him?
The man nods. Beat. He turns back to Scott, looking for
sympathy. Anguished.
MAN
Did you know him...?
(Scott nods. Pause. Portentiously:)
Where did you know him from?
97.
SCOTT
(pause)
...you know.
MAN
(pause. Nods)
He wasn't in the accounting
office. You knew that...
SCOTT
Yes. I Did.
The man begins weeping heavily. Scott puts his arm around him.
MAN
I didn't think, he told anyone
what he did. Because...because...
(he looks for sympathy)
I...
SCOTT
A few of us knew.
(pause)
The man takes out a small photo in a leather case - we see
it is a smiling photo of the Secret Service Agent, Gaines.
MAN
And all he cared
about was doing
his duty...that's
all...that's
all... He used to
tell me...
(the man is
now overcome)
SCOTT
I'm so sorry.
MAN
He was supposed to see me that
night...After his
"shift"...We...His wife...
Scott nods his understanding.
SCOTT
Did she know? His wife. Did she
know?
MAN
How could she? How could
she...she didn't know him...
(pause)
Oh, the poor children...
98.
The man begins shaking, and Scott embraces him to comfort him.
Copley Square. Scott. Coming into the square.
ANGLE, the open-air phone stanchion we saw in the earlier
sequence. It is festooned, as before, with ads for escort
services and phone sex.
ANGLE, on Scott, getting, hurriedly, out of a taxi cab, on
the outskirts of the square.
ANGLE, his POV, scanning the square for Anton. Scott looks
at his watch, and he looks up.
ANGLE HIS POV. The figure of Anton, walking from the far
side of the square, toward the phone booth.
ANGLE, on Anton, as he looks around him, and then proceeds
toward the phone booth.
As Scott watches, a van pulls into the plaza, and heads
toward Anton. Anton sees the van, and retreats, toward the
streetside, where we see, the van has herded him toward
another car. Three men get out of the car, one slugs Anton,
and he is whisked into the car, and the car pulls away.
ANGLE, on Scott, on the far side of the square, looking on,
aghast.
ANGLE Anton, in the backseat of the car, pointing back, as
the car disappears.
ANGLE. CU. Scott, looking at Anton's gesture, and following,
looking in the direction in which he was pointing.
ANGLE Scott's POV. The telephone kiosk. Scott walks into his
POV, to the kiosk. He looks down at the pile of trash on the
shelf.
101.
He looks up at the various pornographic ads pasted around
the interior. He sees that, stuck in one of them is the
"Rogers Rangers" card, which Anton showed him earlier. He
pulls it out of the ad to which it is stuck. He looks down
at it inquisitively. We read in an insert: "Rule #11: Don't
ever march home the same way.
Take a different route, so you won't be ambushed." He then
sees that there is something else behind the ad. He tears
the ad off the kiosk partition, and he is rewarded, as a
folded envelope falls out from behind the ad. He picks up
the envelope. We see that it is the old yellowed envelope
from the beach house. It is printed "Hanson Marine -
Everything For The Boat", and we see, on it, the drawing of
the old power boat. We see Scott feel the envelope, shake it,
tear off the end, and pour something out into his hand. We
see his face, and then pan down to see the object in the
envelope was the red crescent earring seen in all photographs
of Laura Newton.
A wind is blowing from the sea. Scott turns up the collar of
his jacket. We see the house in the BG and Scott, walking
along the patio, the sea beyond him. We see him stop and
kneel, to the piling, from which he took the matchbook. He
sifts through the sand and gravel at the foot of the piling.
The wind blows up the dust, and Scott stands, it is evident
he has got a speck in his eye, and he tries to extract it,
blinking, and squinting. He turns his head.
ANGLE, HIS POV. Beyond the property line. Beyond the hedges
and on what is obviously the next lot, an old, ramshackle
dwelling, the small white toolshed.
ANGLE, Scott, looking at the toolshed, and gauging its
proximity to the Essex House. He begins to walk toward it.
ANGLE. Scott. At the small white toolshed. He stoops, and we
see he has picked up the shell, ejected by Anton's rifle. He
stands, he takes out a small spotter's scope.
ANGLE. HIS POV. His shoulder, rubbing against the pollen-
covered window in the small white shed, has uncovered a bit
of a sign.
ANGLE. Scott, looking at the sign in the window. He rubs the
pollen off, and we see emerge, on the inside of the window,
drawn in the dust, the Picasso sign %-).
ANGLE XCU Scott.
SCOTT
...ohmigod...
102.
Scott, shaven, neat, and determined, standing at a bus stop.
Reading a newspaper. Behind him, a large iron fence.
ANGLE INS. The newspaper shows "The Tragic Death of Laura
Newton", and photos of the accident. And a photo of a
distraught woman in sunglasses, being held up by two friends.
ANGLE on Scott. As he looks across the street. Surreptitiously.
ANGLE HIS POV. A plainclothes car, with two people in it,
looking vaguely in his direction.
ANGLE on the bus, as it pulls into the stop. We see various
people start onto the bus. At the last moment Scott, at the
back of the line, sheers away.
We see a woman getting into a Range Rover, in the vast
gravel drive outside of an estate.
A man comes out of the house, with a cup of coffee, hurrying
out to kiss his wife goodbye. He does so. She drives off.
112.
He finishes the cup of coffee, puts it down outside his door,
closes the door, and looks quickly at his watch, and hurries
to his Jaguar, which he puts in gear, and it starts down the
drive.
We see it is the Businessman from the whorehouse.
ANGLE on another car, coming down the drive, which smashes
into the Jaguar.
ANGLE on Scott, who gets hurriedly out of the car. He goes
out to the Jag, and drags the stunned man from his car, and
toward the house.
Scott, getting out of his car, rounds a corner. We see a car
coming down this street, rather quickly. Scott retreats into
a doorway.
ANGLE, HIS POV. The car blinks its lights three times.
Scott emerges from his doorway. As the car's rear door is
opened, Scott gets in.
114.
Scott, on a rooftop, behind a raised elevator housing. Scott
takes out a pair of binoculars, and Scott leans around the
elevator housing.
ANGLE HIS POV. Across the way, the window, and the ornate
scrollwork bars, in which we, earlier, saw the photo takes
on Laura Newton.
117.
ANGLE on Scott, as he comes back behind cover, and nods to
himself, picking up his yellow bag.
beyond him a building with an ornate scrollwork barred gate
over its courtyard door. In the courtyard beyond, two
Mercedes 600's.
As Scott walks past the trelliswork it begins to open. A
delivery truck is ushered through the gate, by an armed
guard. Scott stops, to let the truck pass.
ANGLE HIS POV. As he turns his head to the side.
ANGLE HIS POV. Walking from one outbuilding, across the
courtyard, beyond the gate, accompanied by a minder, is
Laura Newton. She is obviously drugged, disoriented, and is
held up by the guard. He gets into a conversation with a
woman, dressed as a matron, who comes out of the building
they have just vacated. And she stands, for an instant,
untended.
ANGLE on Scott, the gate open, as the gate guard ushers
through the delivery van, and Laura Newton stands several
yards away.
ANGLE XCU, Laura Newton, as she looks in his direction, and
her eyes begin to focus, as if trying to make sense of what
she is seeing.
ANGLE, her minder, who reacts to a change in her attitude,
and looks at her, and, then, follows the direction of her
gaze to the gate.
ANGLE HIS POV. The delivery truck coming through the gate,
as the gate closes behind it. The street beyond it, empty.
gets into a car, driven by Jones, which comes to the curb.
A deserted streetcorner. Various shuttered posh shops. Scott
walking across the street.
ANGLE CU on Scott, as he paces, as he walks.
SCOTT
...fourteen, fifteen, sixteen.
The camera takes him to the middle of the street. A right-
hand turn, a tight corner. He looks to his left.
ANGLE HIS POV. Beyond him, we see, several streets off, the
sign of the "Royale" hotel.
Scott beckons, and the man, Smith, comes out of the shadows.
He and Scott walk to a small passageway, at the corner.
Camera takes them through the passageway, where we see Jones,
standing by his car, in an alley.
SCOTT
It's good.
(to Jones)
It's very good.
(Jones nods his thanks)
The charge takes the car out...
(to Smith)
We got the flashbangs fore and
aft, You hit the driver, follow
down the driver's side, the car
ain't going nowhere, the muscle
gets out, I cap em, I go with
the girl.
(he points to Jones.
He points to the car.
Jones nods. To Smith)
You exfil on your own, we're on
to the airport.
ANGLE, tight on Scott, and Jones.
SCOTT
At the airport. When we hit the
Conex. When you Seal Us In...you
walk away.
JONES
I understand.
119.
SCOTT
I cannot have heat on it. Now: I
know: that you want to protect
the package. But: you have to
walk away. And que sera, sera.
JONES
I won't look back.
around the corner from the warehouse, a black clad driver,
sitting in the car, watching the warehouse.
The door is wrenched open, and we see Scott, the small
yellow duffle over his shoulder, drag the driver from the
car, and clout him to the ground. Scott gets into the car,
which begins to drive off.

gets behind the driver's seat. He puts the car in gear, and
it begins to drive off.
just becoming visible in the background.
off, a Muezzin is heard chanting morning prayers. Laura
moves toward him, unbuttoning her blouse.
LAURA
I could make you give me the smoke.
He slaps her lightly in the face.
SCOTT
Keep it together.
(he takes a small
hypodermic kit)
Keep it together, or I'm gonna
give you a shot and carry you out.
She reacts violently to the sight of the needle. Beat. Then,
she sits on the bed and cries self-pityingly.
LAURA
Nobody Cares about me...
124.
Hold. On Scott. And we take him back to a small shelf near
the door. He takes down what we see is an ashtray, overfull
with yellow-brown cigarette butts. He takes the ashtray to
the small table, takes out his knife, and begins shredding
the butts, and gathering the tobacco into a pile.
SCOTT
...that's right...
LAURA
...I'm just a whore...They
wouldn't even come get me...
SCOTT
They sent me...
Scott looks at the pile of tobacco. He extracts the "Rogers
Rangers" card from his pocket and looks at it. We read, in
an insert: "Rule #13: Every night, you'll be told where to
Meet, if Surrounded by Superior Force".
ANGLE, on Scott, as he very precisely peels the card into
two thin halves, and rolls one of the halves into a
cigarette, using the reclaimed tobacco from the ashtray. He
takes the cigarette to Laura. As a peace offering. She takes
it. Beat.
LAURA
Did my father send you?
SCOTT
(as he lights her cigarette)
...that's right.
LAURA
(derisively)
One man.
SCOTT
One riot, one Ranger, you ever
hear that?
ANGLE, on Scott, as he hears a car outside the window. He
draws a pistol and moves to the window, and looks down. He
gestures Laura to be quiet.
pulls up. A man gets out, and looks around. Beat. Another
man, and a woman, and two small children come out of the low
house and get into the car, which drives away.
125.
LAURA
Leonides, the King of Sparta,
when a neighboring state would
beg for Military Aid. Would send
One Man.
SCOTT
...well, there you go.
LAURA
...you ever hear that?
SCOTT
No. I think we went to different
schools.
He looks at her. Beat. She hands him the cigarette. And he
takes a drag, and passes it back. He checks his watch.
SCOTT
...put the bandana on.
LAURA
(softly)
Did you hear the one about the
king who turned his daughter
into Gold?
SCOTT
Yeah - I heard that one.
Beat. She turns away, and cries.
LAURA
...I don't want to go home.
SCOTT
I didn't ask you.
A long view of the airport.
ANGLE, a small delivery van we saw earlier. Parked in an
industrial area.
ANGLE INT THE VAN. Laura, dozing in the passengers seat.
Scott, sitting in the driver's seat, alert, watching.
ANGLE HIS POV. Seen beyond the corner of an industrial
building, beyond a chainlink fence, the airport.
and a woman emerge from the plane, and glare at the sun. We
see this man consult his watch.
ANGLE, on Scott and Laura, as he walks her out of the hangar,
and towards the news bizjet. In the B.G. We see Stoddard,
and his men, at their plane. Another car pulls up to
Stoddard, disgorging a man, who goes to conference with
Stoddard.
ANGLE, these two men.
SECOND MAN
(giving his report)
...all of the passenger terminals,
and all access-points to the
Cargo and General Aviation...
LAURA
(groggily, as in a dream)
No, you know what my mistake was...?
SCOTT
(as he looks around)
...what was that...?
He stops and picks up a pair of "paddles" from their
position, leaning against the nose wheel of a plane. They
walk on. In the BG we see Stoddard and his crew, searching.
SCOTT
...what was your mistake...?
LAURA
(from a distance, as
she begins to laugh,
as at a great private
joke; she stops walking)
...you think we bring our
troubles on ourselves...?
128.
SCOTT
I'm certain of it.
She starts laughing, getting hysterical.
SCOTT
No, no...come on baby...come on,
come on girl: just walk to the
plane: Just Get On the
Plane...WALK TO THE PLANE...
She starts to break free and Scott manoeuvres her into a
small hangar area. She is struggling mightily. Scott has his
hand over her mouth.
ANGLE. We see their feet moving through a pool of oil on the
concrete floor - we see she loses her footing. We see Scott
tighten his grip on her, and is furiously trying to calm her.
SCOTT
Shussh, baby... shussh...
shussh... it's going to be
alright...
We see him work a small hypodermic kit from the pocket of
his jacket. We see Laura see it, and her eyes grow wide.
SCOTT
This's going to make Everything
Allright...
Laura reacts to the hypodermic, which Scott is bringing
toward her. And screams.
LAURA
No!
We see Stoddard, and his men, about to get into their Jeep,
stop, and turn at the sound.
gossiping, with some of her crew, looks over in the
direction of Laura and Jackie, and does a double-take.
FEMALE REPORTER
Oh, my God...
ANGLE, on Stoddard, his man, and Scott. As they leave the
hangar. Stoddard looks around.
ANGLE, his POV. Inside the hangar, the fallen man, that
Scott has killed. Stoddard goes back inside, to drag this
man away. He looks up. And, as he does so, he sees Laura,
walking with Jackie Black, toward the Global News Plane.
STODDARD
(yells)
Wait...!
ANGLE, on Jackie Black and Laura, walking toward the plane,
where we see the crew hurriedly setting up a camera.
ANGLE, on Stoddard, as he draws his pistol, and fires toward
Laura and Jackie. We see Jackie move to shield Laura, and
then, struck by a bullet, she goes down.
JACKIE BLACK
(to Laura)
Keep walking...
ANGLE, on Scott, in the grip of Stoddard's henchman.
133.
HENCHMAN
(to Stoddard)
...do you want me to...?
In the moment he is distracted. Scott breaks the man's grip,
and his arm. He knees the man, and kicks him to the ground.
