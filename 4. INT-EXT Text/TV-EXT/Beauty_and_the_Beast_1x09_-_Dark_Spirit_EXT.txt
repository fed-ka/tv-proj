Bathed in the sanity of daylight.                                                                                    5.






  Downtown ethnic. A cab pulls up in front of a store bearing the
  sign "The Magic Eye". Cathy hops out and heads inside. The street
  people stare at her as she walks by -- this isn't the usual haunt
of uptown girls.





    Vincent enfolds Cathy in his arms.

                                                VINCENT
                              I came as soon as I sensed your
                            fear.

                                                CATHY
                            Did you see anyone leave?

                                                VINCENT
                            No.
                                            (puzzled)
                              Catherine, why would someone do
                            this?

                                                CATHY
                            The man I was investigating was a
                              member of a cult -- a voodoo cult.


                                                VINCENT
                            And he is responsible?

                                                CATHY
                                            (confused)

                          this afternoon.
                                      (a beat)
                            Vincent, there's adrawing on
                          the wall inside -

                                              VINCENT
                                    (quiet, troubled)
                          I have seen it.

                                              CATHY
                          What does it mean?

                                              VINCENT
                          I do not know.

  On Vincent's concern,

                                                                    CUT TO:



    CAMERA PANS through the verdant garden, FINDING Cathy and
    Alexander walking along a path.

                                              ALEXANDER
                          If you hadn't phoned this morning,
                            I was going to call and warn you.


                                                        CATHY
                          How did you know it was going
                          to happen?

                                                ALEXANDER
                            They hit my apartment, too.

                                              CATHY
                            Someone had a busy night.

                                                ALEXANDER
                                            (gently)
                            Cathy, I don't want to frighten
                            you, but it isn't over yet.

                                                CATHY
                            What makes you say that?


                                                                      CONTINUED                                                                                  22.

                      I've seen how they work.
                      Ocala was a powerful man, an evil
                      man. He has followers -they feed
                      off fear. His spirit is very much
                      alive.

                                          CATHY
                      What do they want from us?

                                          ALEXANDER
                      Plain and simple, we're being
                      blamed for his death. We're the
                      enemy, and they're going to make
                      us pay.

                                          CATHY
                      I don't scare easy.

                                          ALEXANDER
                      I know. It's part of your mystique.
                              (brushing a stray lock of
                              hair from her eyes)
                      So beautiful -- and so strong.

She blushes at the touch of his hand. Their eyes meet. Cathy can
feel her heart pounding. It's one of those moments when anything
can happen -- if she lets it. She doesn't.

                                          CATHY
                      It's getting late.

She starts to move away, but Alexander turns her towards him. His
grasp is gentle but firm.

                                          ALEXANDER
                      Have dinner with me tomorrow.

                                          CATHY
                        I don't know if -

                                          ALEXANDER
                          (almost a whisper)
                      Say yes.

There is something irresistibly seductive in his flashing eyes.
Cathy has no choice.

                                          CATHY
                      Yes.
                                                                  CONTINUED                                                                                          23.

      Alexander reaches past her and plucks a rose from the trellis

                                                ALEXANDER
                                            (handing her the rose)
                              Until tomorrow.

      Cathy hesitates a beat, then takes the rose. She s
      beginning to succumb to his charms.




    A romantic setting near the water. CAMERA PANS PAST the little
    white lights that sparkle in the trees to an intimate table shared
    by Cathy and Alexander. Cathy, dressed elegantly for evening, is in
    the middle of animated narration.

                                                CATHY
                            -- I heard footsteps, but it I
                            didn't see anyone.

                                                ALEXANDER
                            May I make a suggestion?

                                                CATHY
                            Please.

                                                ALEXANDER
                            Try the champagne.

                                                CATHY
                                        (taking the glass from him)
                              I guess I've been rambling on.

                                                ALEXANDER
                            It's all right.
                                    (putting his hand on hers)
                              You're safe now.

                                                CATHY
                                    (not referring to the case)
                            Am I?

                                      (not referring to the case)
                            Not really.

    He reaches under the table and pulls out a box wrapped in
      distinctively Bloomingdale lavender and white.

                                                CATHY
                              What's this?

                            An impulse. I went for a walk this
                              afternoon and saw it in a window.
                              I thought it would cheer you up.
                                      (as she opens the box)
                            You probably won't like it.

            Cathy lifts out a gossamer, shimmery white dress.

                                                                        CONTINUED                                                                                          31.

        He pulls her onto the dance floor and holds her close.As they

                                  Alexander -- there was a drawing on

                                of a -- creature.

                                  The beast. La bete noire. A
                                  god of great power. They say that

                                  masters of the power.

                                        off balance)
                                  Are you all right?

                                  Just a little dizzy. It must be the
                                  champagne. I wish I could stop
                                  thinking about what's happened.

                                Let me change the subject.

          Alexander tilts her chin up and kisses her gently. Their lips part
        -- and then are drawn together in a luscious, romantic kiss. As
          they embrace, CAMERA PULLS BACK, leaving them intimately entwined
        on the dance floor under the white lights, the crowning touch to a
          picture postcard of romance.



          Alexander walks Cathy to the front door and puts his arms
          around her.

                                                      ALEXANDER
                                  You're sure you're going to be
                                  all right?

                                  I'm sure.It was just the champagne.


                                  I could stay ---

          It's a tempting offer, but Cathy resists.

                                                    CATHY
                                  I'll be fine.

                                                      ALEXANDER
                                  You'll call me if you're not?

                                                      CATHY

                                  I promise.

          She kisses him lightly, knowing that saying good-bye is the
          only way to prevent herself from asking him to stay.

                                                      CATHY
                                  Thank-you.

                                  For what?

                                                      CATHY
                                  For giving me something else to
                                  think about.

                                                      ALEXANDER
                                    Good-night.

    Cathy closes the door. Alexander heads down the steps. CAMERA
    HOLDS on the greenery that lines the walkway, finding Vincent
    watching, carefully hidden. Stealthily, he moves to follow
    Alexander.



      Shrouded in the evening mist, Vincent hidden in the underbrush
    gazes up at the flickering light in the loft window.

FADE IN

INT - CATHY'S APARTMENT - DAY (DAWN)
A quiet KNOCK. Cathy, in her robe, hurries to the door and
admits Alexander. He takes her in his arms.

                                            CATHY
                      I m so glad you re here.

                                            ALEXANDER
                      Shsh.  It s all right.

                                            CATHY
                              (frustrated at showing weakness)
                        I'm still shaking.

                                            ALEXANDER
                        It's O.K. I would have been scared out
                        of my mind.
                            (leading her to the couch)
                        Right now you're going to sit down and
                        let me get you a hot cup of tea.


                                            CATHY

                        I'll get it.

                                            ALEXANDER
                                  (making her sit)
                        You stay right here and relax.



  Vincent pulls himself over the railing and onto the balcony in
  time to witness what's happening inside.

                                                                    INTERCUT:



      Cathy steps outside and looks around. There's no one there.
        Vincent has slipped away. Worried, she steps back inside,
        sipping her tea.




      Cathy hurries out of the building, and takes a deep breath. The
      fresh air seems to momentarily revive her. The hallucinations


                                                                                      CONTINUED                                                                                      44.

    have stopped. Spotting a telephone booth, she hurries over to it
    and steps inside. She drops the coins in the slot and dials.


                                              CATHY
                                    (into phone, urgently)
                          Is Professor Stone there yet?
                              (anxiety darkens her face)
                            Where is he?

    An impatient man taps on the glass of the booth. Cathy turns
    away, trying to ignore him, and faces the opposite direction.

                                              CATHY
                            I don't want to leave a
                            message! Just tell me
                            where he is!

    The impatient man taps on the glass again.Cathy looks around
    and gasps.


    CATHY'S POV

    The man's face is grotesquely distorted, covered with welts.


    CATHY

    chokes down a sob of horror and bolts from the phone booth,
    running recklessly into the street.



      Vincent waits.Cathy steps outside, crying.

                                                CATHY
                                        (referring to the welts)
                            Look at me! Look what's happened!

                            It's a drug. It isn't real.

                                                CATHY
                            Yes it is -- look at my hands!


      CATHY'S POV

    The welts have spread over both hands. She still clasps the
      shell tightly.

      CATHY'S POV

      Vincent's face has become distorted, his hair matted, his
      features haggard like a death mask. His voice sound ominous and

Vincent doubles over, stabbed not only be her words but by the
anguish his presence is causing her. He has no choice. Crippled
with pain, he crawls over the railing and disappears out of sight.
Cathy's sobs subside. Glancing down at the shell, she hurries
into:





      Cathy contemplates the shell.Vincent is at her side.

                            he know about you?

                              Coincidence perhaps. He could
                            have seen. He could have
                              sensed.

                              Fear is a powerful emotion. To
                              conquer it is the beginning of
                              wisdom.                                                                                      57.

      She smiles at Vincent, and they embrace. CAMERA PULLS back as they
      part. Vincent disappears into the mist.
