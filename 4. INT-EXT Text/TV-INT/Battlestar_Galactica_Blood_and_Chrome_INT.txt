ADAMA

packed with exposed conduits, wiring and machinery.*

approaches the corner, then darts around it -- only to find 
the other corridor empty.

Beka finds herself reaching up to it for comfort, touching the 
Cylon's smooth face, and we sense the echo of the earlier 
scene where the wounded Cylon reached toward Adama.  This 
time, the machine's eyes -- and it indeed has two eyes, also 
quite human-looking -- look back at her almost sorrowfully.

Figured you might want to volunteer, so 
I made sure there's a shiny new Viper *
with your name on it waiting for you.  *
Well, maybe not with your name on it 
just yet -- I hear you still have to *
pick a call sign.

Adama's expression betrays his conflicted emotions.  This is 
everything he wanted, but not the price he expected to pay.  
The Admiral can read him and puts a hand on his shoulder.

ADMIRAL (cont d)
Think about it.  Or maybe talk it over 
with a friend.

Now he smiles for real and steps aside -- to REVEAL COKER 
leaning on a crutch in the doorway, wearing a hospital gown.  
Adama goggles as the Commander steps out, Coker saluting *
before hobbling over to the bed.

ADAMA
Coker...?  I... ah...

COKER
What?  No cocky comebacks?  Think I like 
you better laid up like this.
(beat)
You look like shit by the way.

ADAMA
You look in a mirror yourself lately?

Still, his eyes beseech answers.

COKER
They said it was touch and go but 
apparently I was too frakking stubborn 
to die.  Kept me isolated while they 
debriefed me.  Guess they wanted to make

Adama is smiling.  He starts to chuckle, then laugh.

When you going home?

COKER
Still got about six weeks left in my

Adama reaches out, and Coker grasps his hand.  Off which..."Blood & Chrome" - Pre-Production Draft - 11/30/10      102.



Adama, wearing his flight suit, sits at a chair, briefing book 
open on his lap, writing a letter.

ADAMA (V.O.)
Got your last letter.  You're right 
about preconceptions being dangerous, 
and not just in court.  This war is 
turning out to be different than I 
expected.  But maybe my mistake was to 
have expectations.

He reacts to gleeful shouts of a group of newly minted pilots 
crowded around someone's handheld screen, from which the 
unmistakable sounds of another  war porn  video can be heard.  
 Adama who sighs, then turns back to his writing.Now it s

already hates it, another part knows 
that I will make soldiering my life.

INTERCOM VOICE
Contact, Cylon Base Star.  All pilots to 
their planes.  Set Condition One 
throughout the ship.

Adama shuts his briefing book, grabs his helmet and exits.*


Adama strides along in his flight suit, helmet under his arm, 
along with other personnel moving with purpose.

ADAMA (V.O.)
 tell you something else I know.  And I ll
 over, and some day it will be When it s
 remember most aren't the over, what I ll
battles but the men and women who fought 
them with me.

MEMORIES of some of those men and women now flash through his 
mind:  Ozar, Kirby, Elias, Toth.  And Coker.  Coker chewing *
him out after Adama smacked into him that first time.

the piano.*

ADAMA (V.O.)
And I will miss them.

He EXITS through a hatch into...


 An excited young, ROOKIE PILOT intercepts Adama as he s
heading toward his plane.

ROOKIE PILOT
Mister Adama!  Just wanted to say I 
heard about your mission and you are my 
new frakking hero, sir!

He sticks out a hand.  Adama looks past the outstretched hand 
 about to get into his and meets the eyes of Tornvald, who s

Adama turns back to the rookie.*

 about to say, but then he hesitates, We can guess what he s*
some part of him not ready to succumb to cynicism just yet.*

ADAMA (cont d)*
Just keep your head down, okay?*

The rookie nods, then Adama climbs into his shiny new Viper, *
tail number N7242C.*

 He finds a NOTE taped to his instruments panel.   Drinks

Adama looks across the deck and sees Jaycie smiling at him as 
she gets in her Raptor.  He gives her a smile and a nod, then 
closes his canopy.  The Viper is towed out of frame.
