      American and Brazilian. CAMERA MOVES INSIDE --  Production 
      Note:  The Consulate has one security camera on the exterior - 
      in front of the building and another camera inside, on the 
      front door/foyer (CAMS 1 and 2).  All consulate security 
      cameras are small  bubble  cams. 


      A crime scene now:  LAPD and FOUR DS AGENTS (Diplomatic 
      Security).  DON and DAVID walk up, met by DS Special Agent 
      BROWNER DUNN (50s, old military, in a suit like Mitch Yuson).  
      Production Note:  As they walk and talk, we MOVE with them 
      from outside to inside of the Consulate.

                    The Brazilian Consulate holds 2 
                    Andrades, a Portinaris and a diamond 
                      collection that rivals DeBeers.  None 
                    of it was touched.

                    Maybe your guy scared the thieves 
                    away. Who was on duty?

      Browner Dunn lifts a blown up PHOTO of Mitch Yuson-

      David and Nikki exit a Charger.  As they approach (passing 
      other cars), we see and hear-

      Hip-hop BOOMING from the store sound system.  A diverse line 
      (30 people) of SNEAKERHEADS spills out of the front door: 

      Asian Hipsters, Blond Super Models, Middle Aged Businessmen, 
      Homies from Crenshaw.  Everyone admiring each other s kicks.    
      PRODUCTION NOTE:  The people in line should be festive, 
      excited.  Girls putting wristbands on guys.  People comparing 
      shoes, debating, etc...

      A BEASTIE BOY WANNA-BE line organizer (17, hip hop skater) 
      with a clipboard steps in their way.

                    Once the first pair got auctioned for 
                    crazy money, the demand for these

                    I know everything about Primers.  
                    They started with  Primer  Nelson.  
                    Busted ankle ended his days in the 
                    league, so he made kicks to prevent 
                    injuries to others.  Mix tech with 
                    fashion and Primers became a 
                      phenomenon. 

                                  DON
                    Not here for the history lesson...

                                  VIC MORITZ
                    It s who I am.  I produced my first 
                    single to buy a pair of Primers.

                                  DAVID
                    You must have been ticked when 
                    Nespola got the Final Editions.

                                  VIC MORITZ
                    I won t lie.  Those kicks are my 
                    grails, but I don t need to steal 
                    from a reseller like Nespola.

      They find - The door to MORITZ S SNEAKER VAULT: more 
      beautiful than hi-tech - brass and engraved iron.   

      Moritz enters a combination and opens the vault...

      INSIDE THE VAULT -  A sneaker collection more extensive than 
      Nespola s - resembling a shrine more than a display room.  A 
      monument to  Primer  Nelson.  Framed (clear lucite) 1975 
      basketball card (featuring a 27 year old Jason  Primer  
      Nelson wearing a  Skyscraper  basketball uni), and a 
         Skyscraper  jersey.  And, no sign of the stolen Primers...

                    That why you sent threatening emails

                                  VIC MORITZ
                    I felt cheated, so I sent a message.  
                    As you see, I m more intimidating 
                    through email than I am in person.  
                    It s not about money for me.

                    They say love is putting on a fresh

                    say that for Nespola.

      OFF Don and David, eyeing a ridiculously extensive shoe 
      collection...


      Skid Row.  Two black and whites.  Two Chargers.  A coroner s

      Cates leads them past HOMELESS LOOKY-LOOS...

      ...into an alley strewn with trash and homeless camps

      Cates lifts the sheet to reveal...

                    And, how does this connect to us?  

      Cates lifts the other end of the sheet to see...   

      THE ALBANIAN S FEET - The left foot is bare - no sock.  The 
      right foot is sporting a Final Edition Primers sneaker. 
      (Production Note: these shoes look exactly like the stolen 
      pair from Nespola s binder).

      OFF David and Nikki over a dead Albanian with one sneaker,

                    We ve got everyone searching, but on 
                    this street, shiny new things 
                    disappear quickly. 

      ON HOMELESS LOOKY-LOOS pushing carts full of junk.

      Nikki s cell phone RINGS.  She picks up -

                                  NIKKI
                      Betancourt...  Great.   
                          (hangs up, then-)  
                    Liz and Charlie have a possible match 
                    on the M.O. from our Consulate heist. 

                                  DAVID
                    Can t wait to meet the guy who hacks 
                    Voice Recognition locks for a living.  

                                  NIKKI
                    Interpol says his name is Stephanois...

                    And, he s French, too...

      The smooth JEAN STEPHANOIS (60s, once was Cary Grant - now is 
      dead broke) in a chair.  We re...  


      Run down neighborhood.  Old storefronts.  An abandoned 
      warehouse with a Real Estate Sign (Banana Stand Realty). 


      David and Liz drive through the cheap rent district in a 
      Charger: monotone apartments, dead lawns, three beater cars.  
      They park, get out and look ahead to see... TWO LUXURIOUS 
      PORSCHES parked head to head (as though they arrived at the 
      same time and nearly crashed into each other).  What?

                                  DAVID
                    Not an every day sight in this 
                      neighborhood...

      They HEAR yelling beyond the Bentleys.  Walking further, they 
      discover -- Randall Nespola and Vic Moritz in each other s 
      faces, arguing - ON THE VERGE OF A THROW DOWN. 

                                  DAVID (cont d)
                    If you re taking bets, I got Nespola.

                                  LIZ
                    Bit O' Nutz could surprise.

      ON NESPOLA/MORITZ ARGUMENT -

                    Can t hide behind emails now!  You 
                    like shoes?  How about I put mine 
                    across your face?

                                  VIC MORITZ
                    Know why they call me Nutz?  I ll go

      Nespola PUNCHES MORITZ IN THE NOSE!  David and Liz rush in to 
      break it up - 

                                  DAVID
                    Alright, save it for the Octagon, fellas...

                                  LIZ
                    Aren t your bank rolls a little large 
                    to be duking it out in the street?

                                    RANDALL NESPOLA
                    I got a call from some guy offering 
                    to sell my Primers back to me.

                                   VIC MORITZ
                    I got the same call.  Nobody showed.  

                                  DAVID
                    Hard to show when you re dead. 
                            (to Liz)
                    Looks like our Albanian was trying to 
                    set up a bidding war.

                                    RANDALL NESPOLA
                    You find my Primers?

                                  DAVID
                    Halfway there.

                                  LIZ
                    Spend that much on shoes, they should 
                    stay on your feet...

      A moment as this registers for Moritz and Nespola, then- 

                                  VIC MORITZ
                    He wore them?!  

                                    RANDALL NESPOLA
                    That ruins the value! 

      David and Liz exchange a glance, amazed by these fools.  


      David and Nikki move through an alleyway, finding themselves 
      among a maze of buildings.  Everything is still, except- 

      A WINDOW ABOVE - reveals a lit flashlight inside.  David and 
      Nikki carefully move toward a door that is slightly ajar... 


      ...David is on Diddums  heels as they sprint through a 
      hallway - a corridor - high above a loading dock - seemingly 
      every corner of a rundown industrial maze...


      High end autos in mid repair/stripping.  2 x FBI SUVs screech 
      up.  FOUR AGENTS (hero tac), plus David and Liz (in hero tac) 
      file out-


      ON THE MOVE

      ...sparks fly from saws slicing vehicles apart.  Discarded 
      doors, windshields...  A Hummer, an Escalade (2 vehicles 
      outside)...  ...FOUR GREASE MONKEYS (20s)...

                                  DAVID
                    FBI, hands up!!

      ...throw their hands up...

A42A42INSIDE THE CHOP SHOP -- 

      Lee Diddums spots the FBI and takes off running - FAST... (1 
      vehicle inside) 
                                  LIZ
                          (sees him)
                    I got Diddums! 

      Liz takes off after him --


      Diddums dashes down an alleyway... 

      A FIRE ESCAPE LADDER UP AHEAD is all that stands between him 
      and freedom...

      Diddums reaches the ladder... begins to climb -- when -- 



                                                                            (CONTINUED)          NUMB3RS: 514/93: "Sneakerhead" - Rev. Green - 12/15/08     46. 

        CONTINUED:C42C42

      CLOSE ON -- a hand, grabs him sneaker/ankle -- 

      And SLAMS HIM TO THE PAVEMENT.

      Diddums looks up at the looming figure of David...

                                  DAVID
                    Got my running shoes on today.

      Diddums knows better and gives up.

      Liz catches up as Diddums stands and David cuffs him.

                                  LIZ
                          (to David)

                    Where are the Primers --

                                    DIDDUMS
                    Primers what?

      Diddums smiles defiantly.  David searches his clothes.  Finds 
      a cell phone - tosses it to Liz.  Finds a roll of bills...   

                                  DAVID
                    Lot of cash.  

                                    DIDDUMS  
                    Found it under my pillow... 

      Liz checks the call log on his cell.

                                  LIZ
                    He erased his call history.  

                                    DIDDUMS
                    Don t bother looking at the SIM chip, 
                    either.  I torched that, too. 

                                  DAVID
                    Learn that from your uncle?

      David places his hands on the wall to cuff him, notices...

      AN INK SMUDGE ON THE WALL 

      ...left by Diddums  hand.  Weird.  David overturns...

      DIDDUMS  PALM

      CONTINUED: (2)C42C42

      ...there s a PHONE NUMBER scribbled in ink.  David looks to 
      Liz.  She dials the number, listens.  Then holds the phone 
      out for Diddums (and us) to hear: 

      THE MUSICAL JINGLE ON A VOICEMAIL - a bad hip hop song with 
      the hook  You gotta be a Bit O' Nutz In This World ...  

      Diddums is gonna be sick.

                                  LIZ
                    Why would Vic Moritz give you his 
                    number? 

                                  DAVID 
                    Better question - didn t anybody 
                    teach you not to write on your hand? 

      OFF a sulking Lee Diddums... 


      Don and Nikki approach Vic Moritz (in robe and sneakers).  He 
      seems to have been waiting for them impatiently...

                                  VIC MORITZ
                    Where have you guys been?  I ve been 
                    calling you all day.  I m going 
                    crazy...

      Nikki turns him and cuffs him.

                                  NIKKI
                    Yeah, crazy enough to hire thieves to 
                    steal from Randall Nespola.

                          (surprised)
                    What? 
                      (then, understanding)
                    Well, there s gotta be something we 
                    can work out.  Some autographed CDs? 

                                  DON
                    Just point us to the sneakers. 

                                  VIC MORITZ
                    Wish I could.

                    You expect us to believe that?

                    I hear in jail, the term Bit O' Nutz 
                    has a whole different meaning. 

                                  VIC MORITZ
                    You re not hearing me - I had the 
                    Primers - past tense.  

      Don and Nikki give Moritz a skeptical look...


      Two FBI Suburban SUVs pull in.  A vintage green Jag XJ8 
        (Stephanois  car) is in the driveway.  Don, Nikki and David 
      file out to find:

      Jean Stephanois (dressed well and looking confident) exiting 
      the Consulate.  He sees them.  Gracious and elegant to the 
      last, he doesn t make a move.

                    Must have just sold the shoes. 

      DS Special Agent Browner Dunn (from teaser) approaches.  He 
      was expecting our guys...

                                    BROWNER DUNN
                    Got your call, Eppes.  Didn t believe

                    Where s Nespola?

                                    BROWNER DUNN
                    Inside.  Technically, he s on foreign 
                    soil and has diplomatic immunity.  

                                  DAVID
                    He might have immunity, but the shoes 
                    don't.  

      Browner Dunn nods.  He won t stand in their way.  


      Don, Nikki and Nespola walk out -- joining David -- who is 
      watching...

      NESPOLA'S 12 YEAR OLD SON

      Running, jumping and bouncing a basketball...

      ...wearing the prized First Pair Final Edition Primers.  The 
      kid sees his dad and runs over...

                    Dad, I saw you hide these, but 
                    they re so cool!  Best birthday ever! 

      Though he s only been wearing the shoes for a few minutes, 
      there are creases in the leather...  A scuff on the toe...  

      Nespola looks like he might hang himself.  His son sees his 
      expression.

                    The fun he s having is worth more 
                    than they are.

      Nespola watches his son play - a smile of pure joy on his 
      face.  Might be a hint of a smile on Nespola s face too... 

      OFF Don, David and Nikki... 


      We see phone lines from which pairs of sneakers hang... TILT 
      DOWN to a KID sweeping a warehouse balcony.  OFF the kid 
      closing one side of the door...
