      CARLY & EVELYN slap five as they exit, each eating a pastry.

                                                                              CUT TO:

      THE GIRLS turn a corner.                                                                                      9.


                                  EVELYN
                Hey, girl.

      EVELYN opens her jacket to reveal VARIOUS OFFICE SUPPLIES 
      taped to the inside, spilling out of her pockets, purse, and 
      pants.

                                  CARLY
                Woah! Where d you get all that?

                                  EVELYN
                      (Mob Wife voice)
                What I do at my place a work is none a 
                ya goddamn business.

                                  CARLY
                You are. In. Sane.

      They pass TEEN SKATERS ON A STOOP.

                                  TEEN #1
                Nice ass, Mommy!

                                  CARLY
                Go to school!

                                  EVELYN
                Tickets are 85 each, then we gotta get 
                an eighth. Plus drinks... We need like 
                200 bucks.

                                  CARLY 
                Wait, my Fishbowl of Change!

                                  EVELYN
                Perfect. Your F.O.C! You down with 
                F.O.C?

                                  CARLY
                Yeah, you know me!

                                  EVELYN
                So we ll head to Queens after we take 
                care of business.

      EVELYN opens her jacket again.

                                  CARLY
                      (Nodding)
                Yep, I saw it.

      CARLY & EVELYN run into STAPLES.                                                                                    10.


      The FOUR WOMEN set up the DRUMS and performance space near 
      the fountain when JAIME (Hy-may, early 20s), EVELYN s                                                                                     17.


      fashionable gay stoner roommate with a slight Venezuelan 
      accent, approaches. He is visibly stoned.

                                  JAIME
                Special delivery for Evelyn Wexler!

      He takes out of his attach  EVELYN S COSTUME, TAP SHOES, and 
      A BAGGIE OF WEED. EVELYN takes it and hugs and kisses him.

                                  EVELYN
                Jaim , you are the best roommate--

      EVELYN looks to CARLY and leans in to whisper to JAIME so 
      that CARLY doesn t hear.

                                  EVELYN (CONT'D)
                And best FRIEND ever. 
                (Beat.)
                Sooo whenever you re ready to become a 
                citizen, I m still on the table.

      CARLY approaches JAIME as EVELYN exits.

                                  CARLY
                Jaim ! Himmelz. Hymes!

                                  JAIME
                Hey girl.

                                  CARLY
                Are you... stoned?

                                  JAIME
                Yes I am.

                                  CARLY
                Good. Regarding the pot: we can give 
                you that 60 bucks a-s-a-p. OR. Orrrr.

      CARLY takes out from her back pocket the STAPLES GIFT CARD.

                                  CARLY (CONT'D)
                You could have this Staples gift card 
                that has one hundred and thirty-five 
                dollars on it.

                                  JAIME
                Woah.

                                  CARLY
                I know: it s Staples, what can you 
                even buy there? Only any electronic 
                device you could ever want.

                                  CARLY (CONT'D)
                Any office supply known to man. I 
                think they even have food now.

                                  JAIME
                I ll take it!

                                  CARLY
                Any type of paper -- your basic 
                printer, card stock, construction, 
                Post-it. 

                                  JAIME
                Okay, okay, gimme gimme--

                                  CARLY
                Even like big things -- trash cans, 
                rolly desk chairs, lamps--

                                  JAIME
                Please give it to me!

      CARLY hands it over. They turn away from each other.

                        CARLYJAIME 
      Yes!Yesss!


                                                                              CUT TO:

      In front of the drums, a SMALL SIGN leans on the FISHBOWL 
      that reads  Honey & the Sweethearts.  

      Both girls are now dressed in Vaudevillian-inspired outfits 
      and speak in Vaudevillian-inspired accents.

                        CARLYEVELYN
      Hear ye! Hear ye!Show s about to start!

                                                                              CUT TO:
      MONTAGE:

      CARLY & EVELYN fake blow into CARDBOARD BUGLES and then smack 
      each other with them, Three Stooges-style.

      CARLY plays the DRUM SET while EVELYN TAP DANCES.

      KRAGG & O NEILL take from-above Facebook pics on a phone.

      CARLY fails at a one-armed push-up with a LITTLE OLD LADY on 
      her back.

      THE GIRLS hold hands and bow. REVEAL CROWD: old-ass people in                                                                                     19.


      wheelchairs and walkers with private nurses try to clap.

                                                                              CUT TO:

      THE GIRLS each eat a lollipop as they walk on the sidewalk. 
      CARLY fans out the BILLS.

                                  CARLY
                We did GOOD.

      EVELYN opens up her jacket to reveal the bank s PENS AND 
      LOLLIPOPS stuffed into an inside pocket.

                                  EVELYN
                Yes we did.

      CARLY is unimpressed. She stops in her tracks.

                                  CARLY
                Evelyn, look at this.

      They re standing in front of BAR NONE, where a sign in the 
      window reads:

                Happy Hour Special: Drink Like A Fish. 
                If you can finish the fishbowl of 
                beer, it s free!!!

                                  CARLY (CONT'D)
                Dude, this is a great deal. Perfect 
                  pre-game. We ll be drunk all night!                                                                                    21.


                                  EVELYN
                      (Holding up the fishbowl)
                Oh my god. And we have this already 
                and it s empty. We can just go in!!! 

                                  CARLY
                Wh-- What? Then why would we go in at 
                all?

                                  EVELYN
                Cuz once you finish, it s free. And 
                ours is already empty.

                                  CARLY
                Are you kidding me right now? The only 
                reason we would do this is to drink. 
                We would finish the fishbowl of beer.

      EVELYN S mouth hangs open for too long.

                                  EVELYN
                  OoooOOOoooh.

                                  CARLY
                Are you stoned right now?

                                  EVELYN
                No. (Beat.) Yes.

                                  CARLY
                Ugh, you got stoned without me?

      EVELYN presents one of those one-hitters that looks like a 
      cigarette and hands it to CARLY with the POT.

                                  EVELYN
                Catch up now, bitch.

      EVELYN pushes CARLY into a PHONE BOOTH and holds her jacket 
      up, creating a wall. CARLY smokes.

                                  CARLY
                There s not even a phone in here.

                                  EVELYN
                Don t touch anything!
                (To a passer-by, sweetly)
                Nothing!

      THE GIRLS, still drunk, arrive at a nice apartment building. 
      They go up the steps, and EVELYN buzzes in.

                                  CARLY
                So can you finally tell me what we re 
                doing?

                                  EVELYN
                Okay, so we are about to clean an 
                  apartment for ONE HOUR ONLY. And we re 
                gonna make 400 dollars.

                                  CARLY
                FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS?! What? This is 
                amazing.

      The DOOR BEEPS: it s open. THE GIRLS enter the building.  
      EVELYN holds the door for CARLY with guilt in her eyes.

      THE GIRLS stumble along the sidewalk wearing JOHN WATERS s 
      outer-wear, holding the stolen goods. They laugh as a GROUP 
      OF TEENS walk by. One 5-year old calls:

                                  5-YEAR OLD
                Shake it, cougars!

                                  CARLY
                Change your diaper!

                                  EVELYN
                Go suck on your mom s tit!

      They continue walking.

                                  CARLY
                Evelyn, guess what I realized tonight?

                                  EVELYN
                What?

                                  CARLY
                      (Baby voice)
                I m a pwetty baby. 

      EVELYN throws her head back and shrieks. She sees a huge 
      BILLBOARD OF NICKI MINAJ and shrieks again.

                                  CARLY (CONT D)
                Ohh my god, NICKI!!

                                  EVELYN
                I knew I d see my queen tonight!

      EVELYN plays a NICKI MINAJ song on her phone and the girls 
      throw down the stolen goods and dance their asses off like 
      they re NOT wearing Vaudevillian-inspired costumes and an 
      adult baby s overcoats. People honk and cheer as they pass.

                                  EVELYN (CONT D)
                I fuck the world with a long dick!                                                                                    28.


                                  CARLY
                I do that, too! 

                                                                              CUT TO:
