      CLOSE-UP - VALERIE  VAL  STOKES

      The CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal a BEAUTIFUL  27-YEAR-OLD BLACK 
      WOMAN dressed quite fashionably; a sense of accomplishment on 
      her face.  The vacant property downstairs belongs to her and 
      will soon be transformed into her clothing boutique.  The 
      current gathering is a celebration of that milestone.

                    The difference is Marvin Gaye knew 
                    how to write a song and make a 
                    woman feel special, like she was 
                    the only woman in the world.

                    That s right.  Marvin?  He could 
                    get it.  And I mean all of it. 

      CLOSE-UP - DARRYL JENKINS, 37, BLACK, HANDSOME, would rather 
      be discussing the state of the union or the necessity of 
      having a diversified portfolio.  AND HIS SMOKING HOT WIFE, 
      APRIL GOLDBERG-JENKINS, 27, WHITE, JEWISH; one-part bougie, 
      two-parts cool and very comfortable in her own skin.

                                  APRIL
                    Sam Cooke and Teddy Pendergrass 
                    too, girl.   All of it.

                                  DARRYL
                    April, baby, we get it.  You like 
                    dark meat.  But fundamentally, 
                    there s no difference in their 
                    message.  Men are men.

      Woody, 23, DIM-WITTED, BUT SO PRETTY IT RARELY MATTERS, is 
      Keisha s date for the night.  

                                  WOODY
                    Only difference is the way they re 
                    asking for the ass.  

      QUINN DAVIS, mid-20 s, VAL S NBA PLAYER BOYFRIEND, puts his 
      hands around Val s waist.

                                  QUINN
                    Marvin was a genius.  He made women 
                    feel powerful, like they could heal 
                    him with their sex.  Luda s honest, 
                    he just wants to hit it.  Georgia 
                    Dome, fifty yard line, in the 
                    garden all in the dirt - whatever. 

      Quinn playfully smacks Val s ass.  The guys pound fists.

                                  VAL
                    One way is  acceptable nasty , the 
                    other way is  just nasty. 

                                  APRIL
                    Back in the day music was more 
                    seductive and romantic.  Like 
                    Luther Vandross, or Babyface, or 
                    Prince.  Now, Prince, he had an 
                    artful way to get a woman into bed.

                                  DARRYL
                    Hold up one second.  I know you re 
                    not saying Prince is romantic.

                                  KEISHA
                    Hell yeah.   Adore ,  The Most 
                    Beautiful Girl In The World , 
                     Nothing Compares 2 U.

                     Do Me Baby.   Sorry, but your boy 
                    is  just nasty. 

                                  VAL
                    No, he s  acceptable nasty.   But 
                    R. Kelly?  

                                    APRIL/KEISHA/VAL
                     Just nasty. 

                                  VAL
                    Yes, he can sing and write and I 
                    will always secretly buy his CD s.  
                    But I m sorry, I do see something 
                    wrong with a little bump and grind.  

      The girls all clink glasses.  

                                  APRIL 
                    The problem is, men don t want to 
                    date anymore.  They don t even know 
                    how.  I was watching my girl Oprah 
                    and she had one of those therapists 
                    on who came up with the  donut 
                    theory,  which is, if there s a 
                    hole in the middle, men will take 
                    the path of least resistance. 

                                  KEISHA 
                    That s why I give them a taste of 
                    their own medicine and keep it 
                    movin .   

                                  WOODY
                    Excuse me?

                                  KEISHA
                    Not with you, baby.

                                  QUINN
                    Hey, it s not just men who are 
                    freaks.   Women are freaks too.

                                  VAL
                    Babe, just because a woman knows 
                    instantly whether or not she s ever 
                    going to have sex with a man, 
                    doesn t mean she doesn t want to be 
                    romanced for a while before she 
                    gives him the keys to the kingdom.  

      The girls clink glasses again.  The guys exchange glances.  
      They re not sure about this philosophy.

                                  QUINN
                    So for the first three months you 
                    had me beggin  when you already 
                    knew you d let me tap it?

                                  VAL
                    Damn right.  You gotta wait ninety 
                    days to tap this.  I was raised a 
                    lady.

                                  WOODY
                    Okay, that kinda makes sense 
                    because a man knows in the first 
                    fifteen minutes of spending time 
                    with a woman whether or not he d 
                    ever marry her.

                                  DARRYL
                    Now that s true. 
                          (to April)
                    Even with all that hair spray and 
                    those ripped up fishnet stockings I 
                    knew I was gonna propose to you.

                                  APRIL
                    I thought we agreed to never 
                    discuss my Madonna phase.

      Darryl kisses April.  She smiles.

                                  WOODY
                    I met Keisha two weeks ago and I 
                    knew instantly we had something 
                    special.  Something just... Nasty.

                                  KEISHA
                    Glad you got it straight because 
                    you re too broke to marry me.

                                  WOODY
                    That s okay because we both know 
                    when you dig in my pockets you re 
                    not looking for change.   

      Keisha can t deny that.  Everyone laughs.

                                  WOODY (CONT D)
                          (to Quinn)
                    And what about you, Mr. Atlanta 
                    Hawks MVP?  With all the honies 
                    around you, when did you know you d 
                    marry Val? 

      The room gets uncomfortably quiet.

                                  WOODY (CONT D)
                    Oh, you guys aren t married?  My 
                    bad.  I thought you said you ve 
                    been together for five years.  What 
                    the hell are you waiting for, man?  
                          (a beat)
                    I should stop talking, huh?

                                  KEISHA
                    Ya think?

                                  VAL
                    No, Keish, it s a valid question.  
                    Why not get a valid answer?  Quinn?

                                  APRIL
                    Uh, who needs another drink?  Val?

                                  VAL
 In a minute, April.  Quinn?

      The tension is now palpable in the room.  This is obviously a 
      sore and all too familiar subject for the couple.  

                                  QUINN
                    Come on, baby, you just bought the 
                    building downstairs.  Can we 
                    celebrate that it s about to be 
                    your very own clothing store? 
                          (holding up glass)
                    To Val, everybody.  Cheers!

      Everyone toasts but Val remains distracted.  She walks out 
      onto the balcony, Quinn dutifully follows.

      NIGHT (DAY 1)

      Keisha and Woody are in bed at the TAIL END of raunchy SEX.  
      They climax, COLLAPSE in bliss.  Keisha LIGHTS A CIGARETTE.  
      Woody gets cozy, closes his eyes to sleep. 

                                  KEISHA
                          (tapping him hard)
                    Hello?  What are you doing?

                                  WOODY
                    Going to sleep.

                                  KEISHA
                    No baby, not here you re not.  I 
                    told you I don t like--

                                  WOODY
                          (by rote)
                    Yeah yeah.  You don t like to wake 
                    up with someone next to you.  I 
                    remember.  But it s four in the 
                    morning and I just put in work.

      He closes his eyes again.  She stares at him.  He can feel 
      her  glare.  He opens his eyes, sits up.

                                  WOODY (CONT D)
                    Is this about me starting that 
                    drama with Val and Quinn tonight?  
                    Because I already apologized.

                                  KEISHA
                    Bye, Woody.  I ll call you.

      She politely starts to gather his things for him.

                                  WOODY
                    You do remember I don t have a car.

                                  KEISHA
                    Please don t remind me of that 
                    after I just gave you some.  Cabs 
                    are easy to find over here.  

                                  WOODY
                    Keisha, I live thirty minutes away.  
                    Come on, ma, stop trippin  and 
                    let s go to sleep.

      She s not moved, hands him his underwear, smiles sweetly.

                                  WOODY (CONT D)
                    Boy, you re a cold piece.

      He angrily gets up, puts on his clothes, calls a cab.


      Almost feels bad, but not quite enough, Keisha holds the door 
      open for Woody.  One step outside and he realizes:

                                  WOODY
                    Uh, I m a little short on paper.

                                  KEISHA
                          (slides her hand down the 
                            front of his pants)
                    You re lucky you got all this.

      She puts money in his pocket with her free hand, plants a 
      sexy kiss on his neck, then his lips, closes the door on him.


      Back on her bed, her cell RINGS.  Peeved, she ANSWERS.

                                  KEISHA
                    Okay, now you re starting to work 
                    my nerves.  No means no.  


      CLOSE-UP - MALCOLM BANKS

      WE PULL BACK to see MALCOLM, early 30 s, DEVASTATINGLY 
      ATTRACTIVE; possessing the appeal women adore, the swagger 
      fellas envy.  He FLASHES his KILLER smile, flips through TV 
      channels with his high-tech remote in his high-tech mansion.

                                    MALCOLM (O.S.)
                    Well damn, is that what I get for 
                    not calling for three days?

      Keisha SITS UP.  It s not Woody.  She smiles, caught.

                                  KEISHA
 Malcolm Banks.  Well well well.

      INTERCUT BETWEEN KEISHA S BEDROOM AND MALCOLM S LIVING ROOM.

                                  KEISHA
                    Woody.  Real cute too.  I can t 
                    wait around for your call.

                                    MALCOLM
                    I have no doubt you stay busy.  We 
                    have that in common.

                                  KEISHA
                    Well, since we Skype more than we 
                    actually see each other in the six 
                    months since we met I have no other 
                    choice.  Miss me yet? 

                                    MALCOLM
                    I want to see you tonight.  Does 
                    that answer your question?

                                  KEISHA 
                    Malcolm, I will not be one of your 
                      booty-calls.  I m headed to bed.

                                    MALCOLM 
                    Then have dinner with me tomorrow.  

                                  KEISHA
                    You think you can just call out of 
                    the blue and I ll be available? 

                                    MALCOLM
                    I ll pick you up.  Wear something 
                    sexy.  Something red.

                                  KEISHA
                    I like black and I ll be ready at 
                    eight. 

                                    MALCOLM
                    Let s make it nine.

                                  KEISHA
                    Does it always have to be about 
                    you?

                                    MALCOLM
                    If you always make it about me 
                    you ll never go wrong.

                                  KEISHA
                    Good night, boy.

      They both hang up.  They both smile.  This is their dance.

      CARD OVER BLACK: 3 MONTHS LATER


      It s a far cry from the empty space we saw earlier.  With a 
      few more nips and tucks it will be fully transformed into a 
      hip and cool men and women s clothing boutique stocking the 
      latest, greatest brands, plus one-of-a-kind designs, shoes 
      and accessories.  It s the kind of spot celebs and wannabees 
      will  surely frequent to find exclusive, original pieces.    

      MALE AND FEMALE MODELS lurk near a PHOTOGRAPHER.  Some pose 
      for pics, others just pose.  Keisha lounges on a couch while 
      OMAR, 23, COCKY and WITH STYLE somewhere between David 
      Beckham and Kanye, effortlessly dresses a mannequin.  God 
      gave him two gifts: FASHION SENSE AND RUGGED GOOD LOOKS.

                                  OMAR
                    Boss sees you, that s your ass. 

                                  KEISHA
                    Val knows I m not cut out to work 
                    twenty hours a day like her.

                                  OMAR
                    You re not cut out to work, period.

                                  KEISHA
                    Thank you!  I mean, been there done 
                    that with the whole job thing.  Now 
                    I want a rich man to bring home the 
                    imported bacon and have our chef 
                    fry it up in a Neiman Marcus pan. 
                    Besides, if I get too good at all 
                    of this you ll be stuck like Chuck 
                    trying to replace me when I go.  

                                  OMAR 
                    Oh, so you re being trifling is a 
                    gift to us?  How thoughtful.

                                  OMAR(CONT'D)

                    But don t you find it ironic that 
                    you can shoot videos for twelve 
                    hours, half-naked in five-inch 
                      stilettos, but you can t find the 
                    energy to fold jeans part-time?

                                  KEISHA
                      A thousand dollars a day is a 
                    better motivator.  Besides, it s 
                    more fun to shake my moneymaker.     

                                  OMAR
                    You can talk smack now because 
                    you re all over TV in every video.  
                    But the video game ain t what it 
                    used to be and in five years that 
                    booty won t be bouncing the same 
                    either.  Then what?  We both know 
                    you haven t saved a dime.  So you 
                    better get used to real work or 
                    come up with one hell of a plan. 

      This harsh truth bothers Keisha but she masks it perfectly.  
      WE SEE an exhausted Val in the b.g. doing it all: monitoring 
      the photo shoot, dressing models, arranging racks, hanging 
      pictures, signs, etc.  She is definitely running the show.  A 
      woman on a mission to have the hottest boutique in the city. 

                                  VAL
                    These clothes aren t gonna hang 
                      themselves.  Grand Opening is this 
                    week.  Come on, guys.  And when I 
                    say guys I mean Keisha.  Move it!

      Keisha reluctantly gets up.  EVE, playing herself, ENTERS 
      from the back with armsful of CLOTHING WRAPPED IN PLASTIC.  

                                  EVE
                    Is her highness ready to speak with 
                    her only investor yet?  I ve 
                    checked email, paid bills online 
                    and burned five cd s.  What s up? 

                                  OMAR
                    Don t take it personal, Eve.  Ever 
                    since the break up she s like the 
                    Energizer Bunny - don t stop for 
                    nothin .   

                                  PHOTOGRAPHER
                    I heard he did it in front of a 
                    whole bunch of people too.  After 
                    five years?  Brutal.

                                  KEISHA
                    Jacked my girl up.  Buried herself 
                    in this boutique for three months 
                    to not think about him.  Store 
                    wasn t even supposed to open for 
                    six.  That s why I don t do love.  

                                  EVE
                    Thank you, T, M and Z.  Remind me 
                    to never have anything personal 
                    happen around y all.  Sheesh.  

      Eve notices Omar, checks him out for the first time, likes 
      what she sees, signals to Keisha.  Keisha signals back, 
      confused.  Eve signals again.  Keisha is still confused.  Eve 
      rolls her eyes at Keisha, gives up, decides to self-explore. 

                                  EVE (CONT D)
                            (flirtatiously)
                    So, Omar, since Val is so busy, 
                    maybe you and I can talk, kind of 
                    have a pre-meeting, go over some... 
                    points.  Here, put my number in 
                    your phone.  Call me later.

                                  OMAR
                    I m gay.  But if you have a 
                      brother...  

                                  KEISHA
                    Oh, that s what you wanted? 

      Eve looks Omar up and down again, can t believe it.  

                                  EVE
                    Damn.  For real?  Mmph.  Just have 
                    Val call me so we can reschedule.  
                    And tell her I know she s just  
                    getting me back for all those times 
                    I made her wait when she was my 
                    stylist.  Later, y all. 

      Eve laughs and HEADS TOWARD THE DOOR.  The photographer 
      suddenly gets the nerve to talk to Omar.

                                  PHOTOGRAPHER
                    Hey, maybe you and me could--

                                  OMAR
                    Dude, I m not that gay.

      The photographer spins away.  April WALKS IN as Eve EXITS, 
      HEADS TO Keisha.

                                  APRIL
                    We  ready to take our friend back?

                                  KEISHA
                    Let s get this party started.

      April and Keisha conspiratorially WALK OVER to Val, each one 
      grabs an arm, and they begin to STEER her back into the 
      storage room as she puts up a strong but futile protest.  


      This is like any other storage room.  Boxes, clothes, racks, 
      etc. fill the space around a cluttered but functional desk.  
        Everything s been pushed to the side to create a ghetto  spa  
      with candles, music, a massage table and chair, mani/pedi 
      equipment and three VERY GOOD-LOOKING, TOPLESS MALE MASSEURS.  
      Val enjoys the eye candy as she gets a foot massage.  Keisha, 
      face-up on a table with a magazine, gets her neck worked on.  
      April is on her Blackberry getting a manicure.  Each has a 
      glass of wine, clearly not their first.

                                  KEISHA
                    Okay, is it me or does somebody 
                    black need to get to little Zahara 
                      Jolie-Pitt and do her hair?

                                  APRIL
                    Those first grade pictures are 
                    gonna need to be re-touched.

                                  VAL
                    If I wrote the laws, any time white 
                    families adopt black babies, they d 
                    be required to take home a starter 
                    kit of lotion and hair grease.    

                                  APRIL
                    And that s exactly why you re not 
                    writing the laws.

      They share a laugh.  There s a visible lightness to Val now.

                                  KEISHA 
                    Admit it.  You needed this time-out 
                    like I need Barack to be single or 
                    to at least play around.  

                                  VAL
                    I guess I have been in my own world 
                    ever since... Well, ever since.

      A moment...

                                  APRIL
                    You also need a good cry or two.  
                    You re gonna burst holding it in.

                                  VAL
                    I refuse to give Quinn any tears. 

                                  KEISHA
                    That s right.  Man up and stay up!  

                                  VAL 
                    You know what s so crazy?  I had it 
                    all planned out.  I was supposed to 
                    marry Quinn and start having babies 
                    in three years when I turn thirty.  
                    We d raise our kids, grow old and 
                    later be buried in the same plot.  

                                  APRIL
                    Yeah, you can t get buried by 
                    yourself, that s pathetic.  

                                  VAL
                    I know!  Now I have to start all 
                    over and fall in love with a whole 
                    new man.  I ll be like Halle and 
                    Salma and have my baby at forty but 
                    without the benefit of a publicist 
                    to put a good spin on it.  

                                  KEISHA
                    Six billion people on the planet 
                    and women feel we have to find one 
                    guy.  It s ridiculous.  Val, do you 
                    use one supplier for your store?  
                    No.  So, run your relationships 
                    like you run your business: use 
                    your head, not your heart.

                                  APRIL
                    So, you re suggesting Val be a ho?

                                  KEISHA
                    Am I talking too fast or are you 
                    just listening too slow?  I m 
                    saying there s a lot of power 
                    between your thighs, you just have 
                    to know when to... employ it.  It s 
                    like having a triple A card.  You 
                    don t use it everyday but it s good

                                  VAL
                    I don t know, that s just not me.  
                    I believe in soul mates, happily 
                    ever after and true love. 

                                  KEISHA
                    If you want true love get a puppy.  
                    If life has taught me anything it s 
                    not to look for everything in one 
                    man because one man will never have 
                    all the things I require.  So I 
                    have one for sex, one for social 
                      functions, one to pay for treats 
                    like today, et cetera et cetera.   

                                  APRIL 
                    So you used your head to pay for 
                    today?

                                  KEISHA
                    Please.  Malcolm s paying for today 
                    and he hasn t even smelled it yet.

                                  APRIL
                    What amazes me is how often this 
                    strategy works for you.

                                  VAL
                    Oh, Chocolate Trump.  The new guy.

                                  KEISHA
                      Correction, the new guy who owns 
                    the prestigious Banks Jewels.  One 
                    of Atlanta s most eligible, wealthy 
                      bachelors.  And I m interviewing 
                    him again Friday night to see if he 
                    has what it takes to fill the 
                    position of my rich husband.  I 
                    can t be a video girl forever.

                                  VAL
                    He might have what it takes to make 
                    even a pimp like you fall in love.

                                  KEISHA
                    Love is an illusion for the weak 
                    set up by greeting card companies 
                    to convince women it s something we 
                    need.  But all we need is good sex 
                    and  money in the bank.

                                  APRIL
                    What do you really have under that 
                    skirt?

                                  VAL
                    I think all women need is what 
                    April has.  A solid relationship 
                    with a man who d die for her.  I m 
                    jealous.  Of all the cool, single 
                    black women I know who are looking 
                    for a good black man, it was my 
                    white friend who snagged one.

                                  KEISHA
                    True.  Darryl is the exception.

                                  APRIL
                    Yeah, he s something special.  
                          (then)
                    I m having an affair.

                                  VAL
                    Bitch what?!

                                  KEISHA
                    Oh hell no!

                                  APRIL
                    I know, I know.  It s wrong, it s 
                    immoral, it s... So damn exciting.  

                                  VAL
                    How could you?  And with who?  
                    Never mind.  I don t want to know.

                                  KEISHA
                    You just never know people, do you?

                                  APRIL
                    I got married when I was twenty.  I 
                    haven t lived yet.  It sounds 
                    insane, but Darryl is almost too 
                    good.  I love him but I m bored.

                                  VAL
                    Forget Darryl, I wanna whup your 
                    ass.  It s women like you who turn 
                    good men bad, you know that, right?

      The vibe is uncomfortable as they silently judge April.

                                  APRIL
                    You guys act like I m cheating on 
                    you!  Gimme a break.

                                    MASSEUR
                    Could I make a small suggestion?

                                    VAL/KEISHA/APRIL
                    Hell no!

      This cuts the tension and the girls share a laugh.  No matter 
      what, good, bad or ugly, they will always be friends.  


      Val, in pajamas, sits on the couch with her laptop eating 
      Doritos.  Keisha enters in pajamas, looks for a snack.

                                  KEISHA
                    As much as I enjoyed having your 
                    apartment all to myself for the 
                    past year, I m glad you re back.

                                  VAL
                    Me too.  Because now you have to 
                    stop sitting on my couch naked.

      They laugh.

                                  VAL (CONT D)
                    I thought you went out tonight.

                                  KEISHA
                    I can t be available all the time.  
                    Mystique is part of the game, baby.

                                  VAL
                    Well, the game sucks.  I met five 
                    guys on Facebook but all we do is 
                    write on each other s walls, leave 
                    comments or chat.  Have I been out 
                    of the loop that long?  People 
                    don t talk on the phone anymore?

      Keisha looks over Val s shoulder, reads her computer screen:

                                  KEISHA
                     I picked out my wedding colors, 
                    dress and location.  All that s 
                    missing is you.  LOL.   How long 
                    have you been chatting with him?

                                  VAL
                    Five, ten minutes.  I put LOL!  

      Keisha takes the computer away from Val, closes the screen.

                                  KEISHA 
                    You can t give a man all that 
                      information too soon, you ll scare 
                    him away.  You gotta know when to 
                    hold  and when to fold.  

                                  VAL
                    I ve only had two boyfriends my 
                    entire life.  I never had to play 
                    all these stupid games.  If I want 
                    something why can t I say it?  Why 
                    can t I just be myself?   

                                  KEISHA
                    That s the problem.  You re being 
                    yourself.  You haven t been on a 
                    single date since you and Quinn 
                    broke up.  If you don t play, you 
                    can t win.  You need to try 
                    something different.  

      Keisha grabs a short, yellow dress lying on a nearby chair.

                                  KEISHA (CONT D)
                    Put this freakum dress on you just 
                    designed and go out and get you 
                    some.  A break up means one door 
                    closes, now two legs can open.    

                                  VAL
                    I don t know about that.
                            (confessing)
                    It has been awhile.  But I m not 
                    like you.  I can t just have random 
                    sex.  It has to mean something.

                                  KEISHA
                    Sometimes it just means you re 
                    horny.  Sometimes it means rent.  
                    Sometimes it means new shoes and a 
                    bag.  How much meaning do you need?

                                  VAL
                    I can pay my own way and support 
                    myself.  I don t want a man just 
                    for money.  I want an emotional 
                      connection.

                                  KEISHA
                    I don t know about you but I get 
                    very emotional about accessories.

                                  VAL
                    In this day and age I m probably 
                    not supposed to admit this, but I 
                    want the Cinderella story.  I want 
                    the fairy tale.  I want my prince 
                    to sweep me off my feet.  

                                  KEISHA 
                    That s the difference between us.  
                    You want the prince - I want the 
                    castle.  If one day I happen to 
                    fall in love with the owner of the 
                    castle I m sure I ll be able to 
                      appreciate it.  But right now, it s 
                    simply not a requirement.  G nite.  

      She grabs the Doritos from Val, disappears into the back.

                                  VAL
                          (calling)
                    You need help!


      Today is the Grand Opening.  The boutique looks hot.  Val, 
      Keisha, Omar work the floor.  There s a good flow of 
      customers checking out the place.  Val admires Shelly, 20 s, 
      who comes out of the dressing room and models a dress.

                                  SHELLY
                    I look incredible.  And I never say 
                    that.  I couldn t picture it on me.

                                  VAL
                    You gotta trust me.  I know my ish.

                                  SHELLY
                    Well keep doing you because my 
                    fianc  is following me from store 
                    to store with his black card.

                                  VAL
                    You know that dress comes in three 
                    colors, right?

      April ENTERS the boutique FOLLOWED BY hip hop artist GULLY 
      MACK who has a very thuggish, ruggish, hard look.

                                  OMAR
                    Is this him now?

                                  SHELLY
                    No, he s taller than that guy.

      April aggressively clears her throat to quiet them.

                                  OMAR
                    What can I help you find today, 
                    sir?

                                  APRIL
                    Hey guys, this is Gully Mack.  Just 
                    signed with us over at LaFace 
                    Records and as her image consultant 
                    I decided she needs to fem things 
                    up a bit.  So, I thought I d bring 
 her to the hottest spot in town.

      Shock and awe as everyone slowly figures out  he s  a she.  

                                  APRIL (CONT D)
                    Hello?  Is this thing on?

                                  VAL
                    Omar, can you start pulling some 
                    items while I finish with Shelly?

                                  OMAR
                    I ve been known to work magic, but 
                    y all are pushing it.  Come on, if 
                    there s a girl in there somewhere, 
                    I ll find her.

      Omar takes Gully Mack through the store.  Val sends Shelly 
      back into the dressing room to try on a different dress. 

                                  VAL 
                    So, when s the wedding?

                                  SHELLY (O.C.)
                    Next year.  I just moved here from 
                    L.A., gotta get situated first.  
                    You know, get to know the area.

                                  VAL
                    Eve is having a party here Saturday 
                    night to launch some new pieces 
                    from her Fetish line.  If you and 
                    your fianc  are looking for stuff 
                    to do, come by.

                                  KEISHA
                    Oh that reminds me, Val.  Can I 
                    have Saturday off?

                                  VAL
                    Can you kiss my ass?

                                  KEISHA
                    It s good to see you smiling again.

                                  VAL
                    Good to be smiling for a change.

      Shelly comes out of the dressing room looking stunning as a 
      MAN walks into the boutique.  The sun is behind him so his 
      face is darkened, but his silhouette looks familiar.  

                                  SHELLY
                    Hi, baby.  You like my dress?

      He walks into the light and Val sees it s Quinn.  He boldly 
      stares at Val.  Seething, Val stares back.  Shelly has no 
      clue what s up.  April, Keisha and Omar freeze.  Oh no he 
      didn t send his fianc e on a shopping spree in Val s 
      boutique!  And oh no he doesn t have a fianc e!  

                                  SHELLY (CONT D)
                    Did I miss something?

      The walls are closing in on Val who can t do anything but 
      head toward the exit.  As she does, she violently pushes past 
      Quinn  as we watch her body become a silhouette outside.

                                                                          FADE OUT.

                                      ACT THREE

                                                                            FADE IN:


      Val is back at work, she s professional but it s obvious 
      something is bothering her.  A MAN stands in front of a 
      mirror trying on fedoras.  ANOTHER MAN, K.C., 20-something, 
      handsome, flirts with Val as she fits a jacket on him.   

                                  VAL
                    What do you think?

                                  K.C.
                          (not about his jacket)
                      Beautiful.

                                  VAL
                    Great.  Would you like me to ring 
                    it up?

                                  K.C.
                    Yes.  A smile would be nice too.  

      Val forces a smile, heads to the register, K.C. stops her.  

                                  K.C. (CONT D)
                    But first tell me something.  Which 
                    one of these hats makes me look 
                    cool enough to ask you on a date?

      He grabs a fedora, puts it on.

                                  MAN
                    Hey man, I m still trying to decide 
                    if I want that.

                                  K.C.
                          (ignoring him)
                    I ll try them on, you say the first 
                    thing that comes to your mind.

      He puts another hat on.

                                  VAL
                    Would you marry me?

                                  MAN
                    Damn.  Never mind.  That s all you, 
                    dawg.  Keep it.

      The man crosses over to the belts.

                                  K.C.
                    Marriage?  I m K.C. and you are?

                                  VAL
                    Val.  And calm down K.C., it s just 
                      a theoretical question.  I heard 
                    once that men know within the first 
                    fifteen minutes of meeting a woman 
                    if they d ever marry her.  

                                  DION (O.S.)
                    That s the most ridiculous thing 
                    I ve ever heard.

      DION, 27, HANDSOME, BLACK, emerges from the dressing room 
      where Keisha is waiting.  She helps him with his pants.

                                  DION (CONT D)
                    A man don t know whether he d marry 
                    a woman until he sleeps with her.
                          (re: Keisha)
                    That takes at least twenty-four 
                    hours.

                                  K.C.
                    That s Dion.  When his knuckles 
                    start dragging on the ground like 
                    that you just  gotta ignore him.

                                  KEISHA
                          (adjusting Dion s pants at 
                          the waistline)
                    You re just an itty-bitty little 
                    ole thing, aren t you?

                                  DION
                    What can I say, mama?  I grow on 
                    you.

      He hands her an American Express card.

                                  DION (CONT D)
                    I ll take all of that.

      They walk over to the register with tons of clothes. 

                                  K.C.
                    Where were we?

                                  VAL
                    You were about to tell me your 
                    views on the fifteen-minute theory.

                                  MAN
                    Well, I know you didn t ask me, but 
                    in my case it was true.

                                  VAL
                    You really knew in fifteen minutes?

                                  MAN
                    It only took me five minutes to get 
                    her pregnant, after that I didn t 
                    have any choice but to marry her.  
                    After all, I am a preacher s son.

                                  MAN #2
                    The real truth is that men don t 
                    ever want to get married.  We have 
                    to be forced into it.  We get as 
                    far as we can off wit and charm and 
                    fedoras with as many women as 
                    possible until finally you meet one 
                    who you like so much that when she 
                    lays down the law you gotta marry 
                    her, or lose her.  

                                  VAL
                    How romantic.  
                          (re: shirt he s holding)
                    You re buying at least two of 
                    those, right?

                                  K.C.
                    If you want to have this 
                      conversation over a homemade 
                    dinner, gimme a call.

      K.C. hands Val a card.

                                  VAL
                    Tattoo artist?

                                  K.C.
                    I own the shop.

                                  VAL
                          (covering)
                    Oh, I wasn t tripping.

      Keisha is still at the register with Dion.

                                  KEISHA
                          (hands Dion credit card)
                    That s three times.  It s now 
                    costing us money to run your card.

                                  DION
                    So, I guess that means I won t be 
                    taking you to dinner.

                                  KEISHA
                          (disgusted)
                    You got cash or what?

                                  K.C.
                    Just put our stuff together.  So, 
                    Val, please tell me you re single.

                                  KEISHA
                    That s  an understatement.

                                  VAL
                    Still getting used to that title.

                                  KEISHA
                    Her ex dumped her and within three 
                    months met somebody new and got 
                    engaged.  Then he sent his new 
                    piece in here today to rub it in my 
                    girl s face.  So scandalous. 

      Val gives Keisha a  shut the fuck up  look.  Keisha puts the 
      clothes in the bag, hands the receipt to K.C.  

                                  K.C.
                    Well, it was obviously his loss.  

                                  DION
                    And it don t sound like he just met 
                    that woman.  Sounds like old boy 
                    was creeping all along.  Playa 
                    playa kept one in the freezer.  

      For the first time Val considers this notion, looks broken.

                                  KEISHA
                    What do you add to the group?  
                    Forget it.  We re closed. 


      Val looks around, pleased.  Besides the incident with Quinn, 
      her first day of business went well.  She TURNS OFF THE 
      LIGHTS, locks the door.  Suddenly, K.C. steps up and smiles 
      through the glass.

                                  K.C.
                    Didn t expect you to call.  But I m 
                    stoked that you did.  So, your wish 
                    is my command.  What you wanna do?

                                  VAL
                          (thinks a beat)
                    I wanna do something... different.

      She awkwardly kisses him.  He s surprised, pulls away.  

                                  K.C.
                    Wait a sec.  Are you sure?  Because 
                    I got the feeling you were looking 
                    for more.  You know, like a good 
                    guy.  I thought you wanted--

                                  VAL
                    Don t think, K.C.  Just do.

      This is not what he expected at all, but she s serious so he 
      starts to undress her.  Like a little girl pretending she s 
      all grown up, she closes her eyes and lets him...


      Malcolm, dressed casual but nice, no sneakers, gets off his 
      couch and opens his front door.  Keisha is standing there in 
      a sexy red dress and coat, smiling seductively.  

                                    MALCOLM
                    Good girl.  You remembered.

      He goes to kiss her on the lips and without missing a beat 
      she turns her face so his lips land on her cheek.

                                  KEISHA
                    Yes, but you may have to get a new 
                    favorite color because I don t have 
                    that much red in my closet.     
                          (checking him out)
                    Hi, handsome.

                                    MALCOLM
                    Hey, pretty girl.

      She slides past him, walks inside, puts her coat down.  He 
      watches her walk, closes the door.  On the table are several 
      pieces of exquisite diamond jewelry.

                                  KEISHA 
                    Speaking of pretty.

                                    MALCOLM
                    Try them on.

      With no hesitation, Keisha puts on the diamond cuff while he 
      fastens the necklace on her.

                                    MALCOLM (CONT D)
                    I custom made these for J-Lo but 
                    she sent them back.  She told me to 
                    pick the color of the diamond.  I 
                    thought blue would look nice on her 
                    skin.  She didn t agree.

                                  KEISHA
                    Well that bitch is either blind or 
                    insane because these are bananas.

                                    MALCOLM
                    I agree.  I only want women who 
                      appreciate  my pieces to wear them.

                                  KEISHA
                    How can I show you my appreciation?

      He laughs and takes the jewelry off of her.  Her eyes follow 
      the pieces longingly back to the table.  So close...

                                    MALCOLM
                    You like surprises?

                                  KEISHA
                          (a la a little girl)
                    Uh huh.

                                    MALCOLM
                    I sent my chef home.  I was hoping 
                    you would cook tonight.  I like 
                    smothered pork chops, old-fashioned 
                    mac and cheese, greens, maybe a 
                    peach cobbler.  Been a long time 
                    since a woman spoiled me like that.

                                  KEISHA
                    So, I wore red for you, I m cooking 
                    dinner, you took the diamonds 
                    off... I m trying to figure out 
                    where Keisha s surprise is.

                                    MALCOLM
                    Ah, you can t cook.  Typical.  
                    Pretty girl, lost in the kitchen.

      Keisha is about to be pissed but is trying her hardest to 
      maintain.  She looks around the mansion, takes it all in, 
      reminds herself of the bigger picture, shifts her attitude.

                                  KEISHA
                    I know how to cook.  I just didn t 
                    think I d be wearing an apron over 
                    my Prada.  Where s the kitchen?

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


      CARD: 15 MINUTES LATER

      Keisha triumphantly enters through a swinging door holding 
      two plates as if she just won the Top Chef competition.  On 
      her plates are perfectly prepared bacon, eggs and toast.

                                    MALCOLM
                    Okay, two things:  I like breakfast 
                    for breakfast.  And I didn t expect 
                    you to take me seriously.  I really 
                    was joking.  But you went in there 
                    with authority and I heard pots and 
                    pans banging, cabinets opening, 
                    stuff sizzling.  I got  kinda happy.

                                  KEISHA
                    Okay, two things: I could really 
                    hurt you right now.  And okay, I 
                    don t really cook all that much.

      They both start laughing.  He gives her a hug.

                                    MALCOLM
                    I had my chef leave us some plates 
                    in the warmer.  We can eat that.

                                  KEISHA
                    Oh no, we re going to eat this.  
                    Then we re going to lick our 
                    fingers, say thank you and tell 
                    Keisha it was really tasty and 
                    worth sweating through her dress.

      He laughs and heads to the kitchen, she can t be serious. 
      Keisha starts to fume; the temerity of this man.

                                  KEISHA (CONT D)
                    Okay, I see what you are.  You re 
                    the kind of guy who likes to 
                      intimidate girls, get them off-
                    balance.  You get away with it 
                    because you got money, and charm, 
                    you re intelligent and you look 
                    damn good in a suit which by the 
                    way you re not wearing and if 
                    you re going to suggest I wear a 
                    nice dress, I d appreciate it if 
                    your attire complemented mine.

                                    MALCOLM
                          (amused)
                    Is that all?  Can we go eat now?

                                  KEISHA
                    You must be used to younger, 
                      inexperienced, insecure women.  But 
                    Malcolm, I assure you I m not that 
                    girl.  And based on the fact that 
                    we only see each other when you 
                    want and where you want, you re 
                    obviously a control-freak too.  But 
                    know this, I ain t scared of you.

      He waits for more incoming missiles -- 

                                  KEISHA (CONT D)
                          (smiling, satisfied)
                    Now we can eat.  

      She starts eating her food.  He examines her for a beat.

                                    MALCOLM
                    So, you came over to finally get 
                    that off your chest.  I thought you 
                    came over for some good company.

                                  KEISHA
                    Actually, I came to see if I was 
                    still interested in letting you 
                    date me.

      He bursts out laughing. 

                                    MALCOLM
                    Letting me date you?  Well, how s 
                    that working out for you so far?

 KEISHA
                    You haven t totally ruined your 
                    chances yet.

      The balls on this woman.  He takes her in once more then:

                                    MALCOLM
                    You re a brat, spoiled, just like 
                    me.  Pretty eyes, perfect nose, 
                    sexy lips, legs that won t quit.  
                    Don t get me started on your ass...

      She smiles, suddenly coy.

                                    MALCOLM (CONT D)
                    Your looks usually get you what you 
                    want.  When that don t work you use 
                    sex, either by giving it up or 
                      withholding it.  Either way, I m 
                    not mad at that.  Smart people use 
                    what they have to get what they 
                    want.  But let me tell you 
                      something, Keisha.  I m not like 
                    most dudes.  Takes more than a 
                    pretty face and a short dress to 
                    impress me.  Yeah, you got my 
                    attention - now you gotta keep it.  

                                  KEISHA
                    Are you through?

                                    MALCOLM
                    No.  I m sorry you spent fifteen 
                    minutes making a meal that I m sure 
                    tastes good.  However, my four-star 
                    chef made us a dinner that I m 
                    positive we ll both prefer, and 
                    that s what we re going to eat.  
                    So, what are you drinking tonight, 
                    wine or champagne?  

                                  KEISHA 
                          (bites her tongue)
                      Champagne.

      Keisha s impressed, even aroused.  This one will be tricky.

                                    MALCOLM
                    Now come over here and give me some 
                    of those pretty lips.

      With all the cool she can muster, she gets up and they 
        passionately kiss, then kiss some more.  It s hot.  They 
      could easily take it a bit further, but...

                                    MALCOLM (CONT D)
                    Come on, I ll show you how I can 
                    open a bottle of champagne with a 
                    sword.  I learned it when I was in 
                    France last year.  It s kinda cool.  

      He flashes that killer smile, sweetly takes her hand, and 
      leads her out.  

                                                                          FADE OUT.

                                        ACT FOUR

      FADE IN:


      Val checks herself in the mirror, approves.  She looks 
      stunning in that yellow  freakum  dress we saw earlier.  She 
      picks up her phone, dials.  

                                  VAL
                    Please don t pick up... Thank you!
                          (into phone, uneasy)
                    K.C., hey, it s Val.  Yeah, I ve 
                    gotten all of your messages every 
                    day for the past three weeks.  I ve 
                    just been super busy.  Look, we 
                    don t even know each other, so 
                    let s just chalk it up to that one 
                    time and forget it ever happened.  
                    Okay, well, take care.   

      She quickly hangs up.  A knock on the door.  She opens it.  
      Quinn follows her inside.

                                  VAL (CONT D)
                    Thanks for coming.

                                  QUINN
                    You look nice.

                                  VAL
                          (lying)
                    I have a date.

      He goes to sit down.

                                  VAL (CONT D)
                    This won t take long, I just need 
                    to say a few things.

      He remains standing.  It s extremely awkward for both.

                                  QUINN
                    Damn.  You look really good.  

      Mission accomplished, Val tries not to look pleased.

                                  VAL
                    I just need closure, Quinn.  Real 
                    talk.  Help me understand why you 
                    weren t big enough to end it a long 
                    time ago.  What was the point if 
                    you  knew we didn t have a future?

                                  QUINN
                    We had a future together, Val, it 
                    just didn t involve marriage but I 
                    was okay with that.  And you were 
                    too in the beginning, remember?

                                  VAL
                    Well of course in the beginning 
                      everything sounds wonderful and 
                    cool and everybody s all agreeable 
                    and tolerant but stuff changes.  I 
                    thought we were changing together.  
                    When you spend five years with 
                    someone and start picking out baby 
                    names it s not crazy to think that 
                    sooner or later a wedding is 
                    somewhere in the picture.  Is it? 

                                  QUINN
                    The timing wasn t ever right with 
                    us.  It just wasn t gonna happen.

                                  VAL
                    Obviously it wasn t gonna happen 
                    with me.  But you sure didn t waste 
                    any time going out and making it 
                    happen with some other chick.  What 
                    the hell is that? 

                                  QUINN
                    Look, we would still be together if 
                    you hadn t given me that ultimatum.  
                    But I m glad you did.

      Val glares at him.  If looks could kill...

                                  QUINN (CONT D)
                    You want to hear the truth, then 
                    here it is.  My mama liked you, you 
                    looked good on my arm, you didn t 
                    give me any problems and it was 
                    cool between us.  Real cool.  So I 
                    figured I d eventually fall in love 
                    with you.  But I never did.

      This is news to Val.

                                  VAL
                    Wait one damn minute, Quinn Anthony 
                    Davis.  Are you saying that you 
                    were never in love with me?   







 


 





 


 





 











 


 
 


 

 











































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































                                                                                    37.



                                  QUINN
                    I loved you, yeah.  And I cared 
                    about you, still do.  But  in 
                    love?   No.  

                                  VAL
                    You bastard.  Why would you play 
                    with my heart like that?  

                                  QUINN
                    Val, you were the first real 
                      relationship I ever had.  I thought 
                    that s how it went.  But you don t 
                    know  til you know.  If you hadn t 
                    pressed me I wouldn t have realized 
                    I was settling with you.  I didn t 
                    know you weren t  the one  until I 
                    met Shelly and it was so clear to 
 me that she was.  

      The wind is knocked out of Val.  She has never thought of 
      herself as someone to be settled for.  Denial sets in...

                                  VAL
                    No, no, no.  You re in different 
                    cities every damn week.  You were 
                    seeing that girl while I was the 
                    fool at home loving you.  And you 
                    have the nerve to try to make your 
                    cheating sound justified.  Don t 
                    insult me!  

                                  QUINN
                    You can tell yourself what you need 
                    to, but I didn t meet Shelly until 
                    after we broke up.  That s on my 
                    mama.  I never meant to do you 
                    wrong.  But really, I did us both a 
                    favor.  Now you can find somebody 
                    else to love you the way you need 
                    it... Like I did.

                                  VAL
                    If I were a weaker woman I d be 
                    really screwed up.  But I know my 
                    worth.  I m intelligent, fine, I 
                    run my own business, and actually, 
                    you re the weak one for not 
                      recognizing what you let go.  But 
                    you never deserved me anyway.  So 
                    please let the doorknob hit you and 
                    get your sorry, tacky ass out of my 
                      apartment.  You are dismissed.

      Quinn opens the door, gives her one last look, but her back 
      is turned.  He leaves.  Val lies down on the couch, the 
      weight of her heart too much for her legs.  She curls up in a 
      ball and lets the tears flow.  Finally.


      The party is still going.  Val downs a drink then quickly 
      grabs another one.  She seems stressed.  The music stops.   

                                  JERMAINE DUPRI
                    Alright, everyone, it s time to 
                    take a moment to congratulate our 
                    girl Val on opening this fly little 
                    boutique and giving the ATL a whole 
                    new style!  Y all get the word out 
                    and help support her.  Everybody 
                    lift  em up!  

      The  crowd raises their glasses in honor of Val and drinks.

                                  VAL
                    And before you go, feel free to buy 
                    something so I can hurry up and pay 
                    back my wonderful investor!

      Val holds up Eve s hand, hugs her.  Eve waves to everyone.  
      The music goes back up.  The party continues.  K.C. makes his 
      way over to Val who s very surprised to see him. 

                                  VAL (CONT D)
                    Whoa.  What are you doing here?

                                  K.C.
                    Calm down, I m not stalking you.  
                    My boy invited me.  But I did wanna 
                    get another look at the sweet girl 
                    who kicked me to the curb.  

                                  VAL
                            (uncomfortable)
                    I don t know what you want me to 
                    say.

                                  K.C.
                    Don t say anything.  From what I 
                    recall of that day in your dressing 
                    room, you re pretty good at that.

                                  VAL
                    Don t be a jerk.

      She gets tangled up by SEVERAL PEOPLE and loses K.C.  She 
      looks back and glares at him.

      ANGLE ON: KEISHA AND WOODY  

      Who are dancing.  Keisha notices Malcolm walk in, brightens.  
      On his arm is JASMINE TANAKA, 24, GORGEOUS AND BUILT LIKE A 
      BRICK HOUSE.  Keisha s smile fades but she quickly covers.  
      Jasmine stops to speak to someone she knows.  Malcolm SEES 
      Keisha, nods.  Keisha smiles back.

                                  KEISHA
                    Woody, can you go get me another 
                    mojito please?

                                  WOODY
                    Yeah.  Be back in a minute.

      Woody heads off as Malcolm makes his way over to Keisha.

                                    MALCOLM
                    So, who s that you re with?

                                  KEISHA
                    Just a guy.  And her?

                                    MALCOLM
                    Just a girl.  I can send her home 
                    anytime.

                                  KEISHA
                    And why would you do that?

                                    MALCOLM
                    I thought I might finally let you 
                    sleep with me tonight.

                                  KEISHA
                    What?  Your exotic Barbie won t do 
                    that for you?

                                    MALCOLM
                    Oh, I have a feeling she ll let me 
                    do anything I want to her.  But I m 
                      preoccupied by someone else.

                                  KEISHA 
                    And what would be in it for that 
                    someone else?

                                    MALCOLM
                    Bragging rights.  

                                  KEISHA
                    Children brag.  Call me when you 
                    wanna know what women do.

      She winks then walks away.  Malcolm shakes his head, laughs.  

      ANGLE ON: GULLY MACK 

      Who is dressed more feminine but still rough around the edges 
      trying to walk in her skirt and heels.  She wobbles over to 
      Omar who catches her just as she s about to fall, but not 
      before she takes down a SERVER and a rack of clothes. 

      ANGLE ON: APRIL AND DARRYL

      April is on her phone TEXTING.  Darryl brings her a drink, 
      gives her a kiss, indicates she has lipstick on her teeth, 
      helps her get it off, kisses her again.  She plays the role 
      of  happy wife  but her face belies the truth as she puts her 
      phone back in her purse. 

      ANGLE ON: MAYOR HOWARD AND HIS WIFE

      The Mayor opens his phone, a TEXT MESSAGE has arrived.  He 
      closes it quickly then turns to find April.  Their eyes meet, 
      linger,  then expertly, they both look back to their spouses. 

      ANGLE ON: KEISHA

      As Jasmine walks up behind her.

                                    JASMINE
                    Keisha?  I thought that was you.

                                  KEISHA
                          (mock surprise)
                    Jasmine!  Have you been here all 
                    night?  I didn t even see you.  

                                    JASMINE
                    Yeah, I got here a while ago with 
                    some guy who s ballin  out of 
                    control.  I m trying to see what s 
                    up with that.  You know how we do.

                                  KEISHA
                    Let s not act like you and I  do  
                    things alike.  You  do  and have 
                     done  way more than me.  

      Jasmine laughs mischievously, she can t disagree with that.

                                    JASMINE 
                    Well, I finally quit the video 
                    business.  I was way too wild.  As 
                    you know, I was out there.

                                    JASMINE(CONT'D)

                    But I found God and he told me I 
                    had to make a change.  So I m a 
                    writer now.  And actually, you re 
                    mentioned in a few different 
                    chapters of my book.  

                                  KEISHA
                    Excuse me?

                                    JASMINE
                    I m writing a tell-all book about 
                    my years as a video vixen.  I have 
                    lots of stories about lots of 
                    rappers.  I m about to make a 
                    fortune.  I didn t have all that 
                    fun for nothing.  

                                  KEISHA
                    What do me and God have to do with 
                    any of that?

                                    JASMINE
                    You didn t think anyone saw you do 
                    your dirty deeds.  But I was always 
                    lurking.  You ve been a very 
                    naughty girl, Keisha.  

      Jasmine turns and heads toward Malcolm.  Keisha tries to 
      steady herself as a wave of terror goes through her body.

      ANGLE ON: VAL AND K.C.

                                  K.C.
                    Hey, I m not losing sleep, but if I 
                    had stopped calling, you d have my 
                    picture up on a dart board with 
                    fifty holes in my head by now.  So 
                    before you get mad at the next dude 
                    for bouncin  after he bones you or 
                    your friends - think about how easy 
                    it is.  I m just saying.

                                  VAL
                    Look, I m sorry.  I just feel icky.  
                    I think maybe we moved too fast.  

                                  K.C.
                    We?  We? 

                                  VAL
                    Okay, me.  I was trying something 
                    different and seeing how it felt 
                    and it just doesn t feel like me.

                                  K.C.
                    Hey, I tried to be a nice guy, you 
                    didn t want that.  So, come on. 
                          (hands around her waist)
                    How about one last time?

      Val half-smiles and disappears with him into the back.


      K.C. begins unbuttoning his shirt.  

                                  VAL
                    Let me show you something first.

      She OPENS the back door.  He steps outside.

                                  K.C.
                    Hurry up, it s cold out here.

                                  VAL
 You could use the cooling off.

      She shuts the door, leaving K.C. outside.  A moment of relief 
      as He BANGS ON THE DOOR.  Keisha and April enter.

                                  APRIL
                    Okay, Tacky Patrol is here.  No sex 
                    during this party.

                                  VAL
                    Trust me.  That s the last thing I 
                    would ever do.  Especially now.

      BANGING on the outside door continues.  We HEAR K.C. yelling, 
      his voice muffled.  Val buries her head in her hands.

                                  APRIL
                    Okay, spill it.  What is going on 
                    with you tonight, Val?

                                  VAL 
                    I think I m pregnant.

                                  KEISHA
                    You do realize you have to actually 
                    have sex for that to happen, right?

      Val stares at her.

                                  KEISHA (CONT D)
                    You had sex?  With who?

                                  VAL
                    With him.

      She points to the door where K.C. s BANGING continues.  

                                  KEISHA
                    Shut up!  You and the white boy?  
                    Wait.  You didn t use protection?  

                                  VAL
                    Of course I did, but the condom 
                    broke.  I never have casual sex and 
                    the one time I do this happens.

                                  APRIL
                    Oh boy, this is so not good.  

                                  KEISHA
                    What are you gonna do? 

                                  VAL 
                          (near tears, shrugs)
                    I can t deal with this right now.  
                    I need another drink.

                                  KEISHA
                    Honey, don t we all?

                                  APRIL
                    But is that good for the bab--

      Val holds up her hand to make April stop talking.  Then Val 
      and Keisha, both focused on their own issues, head out.  

                                  APRIL (CONT D)
                    Well, don t leave me back here!

      April follows Val and Keisha back out to the party as we,

                                                                          FADE OUT.
