                                              TEASER


          FADE IN:

  11EXT. SMITH HOUSE - NIGHT

          Lights are on, it almost looks inviting.  From inside we
          hear the canned laughter of a laugh track...


  22INT. SMITH HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Johnny is on his couch, watching TV, and doing something
          we rarely see him do - he's laughing.  He lowers the volume
          on his TV as he reaches for the phone. 

          He looks pleased.  Piled up on the couch on the cushion
          next to Johnny are videotapes.  Find one labeled "Seinfeld -
          Season 8, do not tape over!"


  33INT. BRUCE'S PAD - CLOSE ON BRUCE - CONTINUOUS

          Bruce is perched on the edge of his couch, intense
            concentration on his face, an X-Box controller in his
          hand.  His eye twitches as the phone rings.  He pauses
          his game and picks it up, knows who it is.

                                        BRUCE
                        I'm saving the universe, what is
                        it?

          INTERCUT PHONE CONVERSATION - BRUCE AND JOHNNY

                                        JOHNNY
                        I just watched a great one. 

          Bruce sighs to himself, cradles the phone under his neck
          and unpauses his game, playing as he listens.

                                        BRUCE
                        Bizarro Jerry?

                                        JOHNNY
                        No, this is one where George's
                        girlfriend says "yada yada" all
                        the time and he thinks she's hiding
                          something...



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: THE OUTSIDER - TEASER - 10/21/02 - WHITE    2.


    3CONTINUED:3

                                        BRUCE
                        Yeah.  Yep. 

          Johnny nods, realizes Bruce isn't really listening.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You sure you don't want to come
                        over and watch these?

                                        BRUCE
                        My tapes, John.  I've seen 'em
                        all.  Maybe when you catch up on
                        the X-Files...

                                        JOHNNY
                        This is all ancient history to
                        you, isn't it?  1996, 1997...

                                        BRUCE
                        Not ancient.  It's just... cooler
                        for you than it is for me.

                                        JOHNNY
                          I guess.

                                        BRUCE
                        Look at it this way.  For me,
                        it's nostalgia.  For you, it's
                        like time travel. 
                                (yelling at game)
                        NO!

                                        JOHNNY
                        Okay, I can tell you're doing
                          something important.

                                        BRUCE
                        Hey, if you need to talk...

                                        JOHNNY
                        No, that's cool, it's late, I'm
                        gonna pass out in a second...

                                        BRUCE
                          Alright, man.  Take it easy.

          Bruce hangs up, resumes his game.  Then hesitates,
            wondering if he rushed Johnny off the phone.

          Johnny sits back, the wind taken out of his sails, maybe
          thinking about some of the other things he missed while
          in a coma.  Things he can't reclaim so easily. 

          Commercials are on, Johnny turns off the TV.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: THE OUTSIDER - TEASER - 10/21/02 - WHITE    3.

          Or at least he tries.  The remote doesn't respond.  He
          tries again.  No dice.  Johnny sighs the "low battery"
          sigh.  He drops the remote and grabs his cane, gets up,
          crosses to TV.  Commercial has switched to a pretty YOUNG
          WOMAN against a black background.  She speaks frankly,
          her naturalistic delivery is supposed to convince us she's
          not an actor.  She's cute, so Johnny pauses before turning
          off the TV, much like you'd wait for the last few bars of
          a song to play before turning off your car. 

                                        YOUNG WOMAN (TV)
                        It's not that I don't like the
                        way I look... it's that I do like
                        the way I look.
                                (endearing chuckle)
                        And I'd like to keep it that way. 
                        That's why Revivatin is for me. 

          Cut to a slo-mo shot of Young Woman and her MOTHER in a
          kitchen, cooking a giant holiday meal side by side and
          laughing over some shared memories as they look up into
          the camera.  Mom's face is attractive, but lined and
            wrinkled.  Daughter's is smooth, glowing. 

                                        ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        No one can turn back the clock,
                        but we've just figured out how to
                        slow it down.  Ask your Doctor if
                          Revivatin is right for you. 

          Johnny turns off the TV.  As his finger depresses the
          power button we SWING 180 DEGREES AROUND HIM TO LOOK OVER
          HIS SHOULDER AT THE TV AS --


          A VISION HITS 

          The TV image shifts, becomes blurred, then sharpens again
          and goes in and out as it crackles and fuzzes, like it is
          picking up a faraway signal...

          The image cuts to a YOUNG MOTHER, 30, who is being
          interviewed on a news segment.  This woman is clearly not
          an actress.  Her pain is real, so is her anger.

                                        YOUNG MOTHER (TV)
                          I started using Revivatin about...
                        April, 2005... and used it pretty
                          steadily, for the last four years,
                        ''til I found out I was pregnant...  

          The Young Mother bites her lip.  She controls an inhale
          and wipes the perfect skin around her eyes...



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: THE OUTSIDER - TEASER - 10/21/02 - WHITE    4.


  3CONTINUED: (3)3

          The shot cuts to a BABY in an INCUBATOR.  The baby is
          horribly WRINKLED from head to toe, and is crying. 

                                        REPORTER#1 (V.O.)
                        Her daughter born six weeks ago
                        is hanging on but her future,
                        like the future of thousands of
                        other Revivatin babies, is
                        uncertain.  Early reports indicate
                        that eighty percent of infants
                        born with the Revivatin birth
                        defect will die within two to
                        three months of birth.  

          During the above, we widen to include the whole room,
          filled with at least TWENTY incubators, each one containing
            a horrifically desiccated "Revivatin Baby."  Their cries
          fill the room...


          JOHNNY

          snaps out of his vision, shaken.  He steps back and looks
          at his TV.  It stares back at him silently, power off,
          screen black.  Johnny closes his eyes, hit hard by what
          he's seen... 

          CUT TO MAIN TITLES

  44EXT. FAITH HERITAGE ALLIANCE - DAY - ESTABLISHING


  55INT. PURDY'S OFFICE - DAY

          A cross between Grand-Dad's study and an ergonomic
            executive suite.  We're starting close on a website on
          Purdy's computer that Johnny has just called up... We see
          the LOGO of corporate giant CULP & BELLING.  Big ad for
          REVIVATIN.

                                        JOHNNY
                                  (mile-a-minute)
                          Revivatin is a Culp & Belling
                          product.   They tell you on their
                        website that it's FDA approved,
                        but get this: It only got Class B
                          approval, which means "in the
                        absence of human studies, animal
                        studies showed no risk."  It also
                        says "the chance of harm to a
                        human baby is remote," but it is
                          a possibility.  A possibility! 
                        They didn't do tests on pregnant
                        women, so they just slap a warning
                        label on the side.  But obviously
                        that's not gonna do the trick. 
                        This thing is a mass-murderer and
                        it ships nation-wide in nine days.

                        This is... I just need a moment...
                        to process this.

                        It's not that I don't understand,
                        it's that... your visions up till
                        now have taken you into individual
                        lives, or in rare instances, an
                        event that affects maybe a hundred
                        lives.  Like the steakhouse fire. 
                        But this... now, you're telling
                        me you've had a vision about
                          thousands...

                        it might be the whole planet...    

          Johnny's tone makes Purdy glance up at him.

                                        PURDY
                        What do you mean?

                        I mean I have to stop this drug
                        from coming out.

                        You're not going public with
                        this...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't want to go public.  If
                        you can just help me contact
                        someone at a high level at Culp &
                        Belling...  

          Purdy sighs, he was afraid of that. 

                                        PURDY
                        Johnny.  You're talking about
                        major dollar decisions that affect
                        everything from shipping to
                          advertising costs to corporate
                        image.  Major dollar decisions.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's gonna cost them a lot more
                        for the class action lawsuit six
                        years down the line.  I'm doing
                        them a big favor here.

          Purdy shakes his head at Johnny's naivete.

                                        PURDY
                          Somehow, I don't think they're
                        going to see it that way.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I need you to make some calls. 
                        Pull some strings.  Get me a
                          meeting.  Their headquarters are
                        in New Hampshire, near Concord.

          Purdy looks at Johnny.

                          connections to the corporate

                        One thing I've learned about you,
                        Gene.  If you don't know the
                          people... then you know the people
                        who know the people.

  66EXT. CULP & BELLING OFFICE PARK - DAY

          Johnny arrives in his Jeep, stops by the standard post
          9/11 security checkpoint at the entrance to the lovely
            manicured grounds of the sprawling office park.  Two suits
          are leaving as Johnny is arriving...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hi, my name's John Smith, I have
                        an appointment with Wendell Hahn.

                                        VETERAN GUARD
                          Identification, sir?

          Johnny hands the VETERAN GUARD his driver's license and
          as they touch... we hear the sound of a VISION starting
          and when Johnny looks up...


          SPLIT REALITY VISION: 

          The plaza is now lined on either side with angry PROTESTERS
          waving picket signs.  The two SUITS in present time
          continue to walk and talk like nothing's wrong.  The
          Protesters wave signs condemning the "Baby Killers." 
          Some signs have quotes from the Bible about paying the
          price for vanity.  Other Protesters hold up enlarged photos
          of babies with the Revivatin birth defect.  They are
          SHOUTING over each other, raging...

                                        VETERAN GUARD
                                (oblivious to the
                                  vision)
                        Thank-you, Mr. Smith.


          NEW ANGLE - THE VISION ENDS

          garage.          DEAD ZONE: THE OUTSIDER - ACT ONE - REV. 10/25/02 - PINK  8.


  77INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

          CLOSE ON WENDELL HAHN, 45, staring at Johnny, who sits in
          the guest chair opposite his desk.    

          A beat passes.  Hahn is poker-faced. 

          Another beat.  Johnny waits.  The tension in the room is
          thick.  Johnny has just said everything he's come here to
          say, and we are watching Wendell Hahn's reaction.  Milk
          the moment.  And here it comes... a sly smile.

                                        WENDELL HAHN
                        Garret Carter.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Come again?

                                        WENDELL HAHN
                        Garret Carter set this up.  Didn't
                        he.  This is payback for Vegas.   
                        C'mon, you can tell me.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Mr. Hahn, this isn't a joke.    

          Hahn's knowing smile becomes confused.  Johnny shakes his
          head.  Wendell shifts in his seat, becoming uncomfortable.

                                        WENDELL HAHN
                        And you really...
                                (about to say "believe")
                        You're a psychic.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I know, it's hard to swallow, but
                        I have a number of references...

          Johnny opens his briefcase, and Wendell tenses up.  Johnny
          notices, carefully takes out a resume-like document.

                                        JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                          ...Including the Sheriff of
                          Penobscot County, Arthur Markoff
                        CEO of Arthur Markoff Industries,
                        Roger Chatsworth...

                                        WENDELL HAHN
                                (perusing document)
                        Uh huh.  Uh huh.  And what exactly
                        do you want, Mr. Smith? 

          Johnny is caught off-guard by that.

                        this company from making a terrible
                        mistake...   

                                        WENDELL HAHN
                        Because you had a 'premonition'.

                                        JOHNNY
                        At least, have your scientists re-
                        examine their research...

                                        WENDELL HAHN
                        They do that every day, Mr. Smith,
                        without being prompted to by a
                          psychic.    

          Hahn stands, signaling the meeting is over...

                                        WENDELL HAHN (CONT'D)
                        But thank you for bringing this
                        to our attention, I will get right
                        on this.

          Hahn picks up his desk phone.

                                        WENDELL HAHN (CONT'D)
                        In the meantime, you understand
                        that the claims you've made... if
                        made outside this office would be
                        considered slander...  

          Johnny leans forward and grabs Hahn's wrist as he's
          punching numbers into the phone.

                                        JOHNNY
                        This company has a
                          responsibility...

          But as he grabs the wrist, suddenly...


88A VISION

          Wendell Hahn ages six years in a vision-morph, his hairline
          receding and mid-section increasing.  Overlapping from
          the next (vision) scene...

                                        SENATOR JOSEK (O.S.)
                        ...And as Senator Collick expressed
                        in yesterday's session, the aim
                        of this subcommittee is not to
                          determine if mistakes, judgment
                        errors, or oversights were made...

  99INT. HEARING CHAMBERS - DAY - 2009

          Johnny stands behind Wendell Hahn, who sits in a row with
          six other Culp & Belling LAWYERS, all scribbling notes. 
          In front of them sit men in more expensive suits - probably
          members of Culp & Belling's board.  Johnny looks around
          to see a raised table, behind which sit THREE SENATORS,
          two men and a woman.  The whole set-up is reminiscent of
          the Senate hearings on the tobacco industry.  A gaggle of
          PRESS HOUNDS hover in the back of the chambers, snapping
          pictures with tiny digital cameras that have become the
            pro-standard in 2009.    

          There is a single table facing the Senator bench, where a
          lone MAN sits, DR. THOMAS BERKE, 36.  His profile is all
          we can see from Johnny's perspective.  

          The female Senator is already droning when we arrive...

                                        SENATOR JOSEK (CONT'D)
                        ...but when they were made, why
                        they were made, and by whom. 
                        This same sentiment was
                          communicated to me this very
                        morning by Vice President Stillson,
                        as well as Surgeon General
                          Rayher...

          Johnny reacts to Stillson's name and future title...

                                        SENATOR JOSEK
                        Doctor Berke, as the leading
                        genetic authority on the Revivatin
                        crisis, can you shed any light on
                        these questions?

                                        THOMAS
                        Thank you, Senator Josek, members
                        of the Committee.  I can give you
                        names of the various groups
                          involved, I can give you dates of
                          clinical trials and FDA
                          approvals... but in the end I can
                        only tell you that, at the time
                          Revivatin was developed, the
                        technology to identify the mutating
                        agent was not available. 

          Johnny begins to walk over to Berke so he can get a better
          look at him.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: THE OUTSIDER - ACT ONE - REV. 10/28/02 - GRN  11.

                          I completed the development of
                        the Anza program in April 2008, a
                        year after the initial birth
                        defects began to appear from then
                        unknown causes. 

          Johnny stands directly in front of Berke, who talks through
          him to the Senators.  Johnny looks at his "paper
          nameplate," studies his face: handsome, solemn features.

                                        THOMAS (CONT'D)
                        Anza is a computer model that
                        allows for virtual invitro testing,
                        which was considered a
                          revolutionary process at the time. 
                        It certainly wasn't available to
                          researchers in 2003, otherwise
                          Revivatin would never have been
                          released...

          Johnny blinks, still holding Hahn's wrist.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Thomas Berke.  We have to find
                        Dr. Thomas Berke.

                                        WENDELL HAHN
                        Let go of me!

          Hahn pulls his wrist free, his phone drops.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He's the one who'll prove that
                          Revivatin causes birth defects...
                        but it will take five years!

          Two SECURITY GUARDS arrive at the door.  Hahn must've
          called them we he punched those keys on his phone.   

                                        WENDELL HAHN
                        And you have five seconds to back
                        out of this office.  

          Johnny glares at Hahn as the Guards approach him.          DEAD ZONE: THE OUTSIDER - ACT ONE - 10/21/02 - WHITE  12.


  1111EXT. BANGOR, MAINE - ESTABLISHING


  1212INT. BANGOR DAILY NEWS NEWSROOM - DAY

            Establishing with a front page staff BANGOR DAILY NEWS
          that we're back in Maine... finding Johnny entering... 
          he moves through the BULLPEN, ignoring several REPORTERS, 
          colleagues of DANA BRIGHT, who notice him and exchange
          glances with each other.  He crosses toward Dana who is
          talking to her editor, SAM BAKER (50s) in his office which
          has a glass wall... when she sees Johnny she comes out to
          meet him halfway... on the move to her desk...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Did you find him?

                                        DANA
                        Hi, Dana.  What's going on?  It's
                        good to see you.

          Johnny realizes his rudeness, feels guilty.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hi.  I'm sorry... you're right. 
                        This is important....

          Dana takes a long look at Johnny, picking up on how tightly
          wound he is.  

                                        DANA
                        Okay, you have to level with me. 
                        What's going on.

                                        JOHNNY
                          I already told you, I can't.  

          Dana smiles and folds her arms.

                                        DANA
                        Give and take is the foundation
                        of any working relationship.

          Is she talking reporter and source, or something else? 

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'll be honest.  There is a story.

                                        DANA
                        No, really?

                                        JOHNNY
                        A big story.  But it's a better
                        story if I find this Dr. Berke
                        because he can prove what I've
                        seen.  Right now, it's just my
                        word against theirs.

                                        DANA
                          'Theirs'?

                                        JOHNNY
                                (beat)
                        The second I can tell you, I will. 
                        Did you find him or...  

          Before he even finishes, she's handing him a bio she
          printed off the internet... (but she holds back a second
          and third sheet)...

                                        DANA
                        Dr. Thomas Berke.  Cardiovascular
                          surgeon.  Lives in New York. 
                        Celebrated his sixty-fifth birthday
                        last week.

                                        JOHNNY
                        No.  That can't be right.  The
                        doctor I'm looking for is young,
                        early thirties... does this guy
                        have a son?

                                        DANA
                          Daughter and her name isn't Thomas. 
                        He's the only Thomas Berke
                        registered with the A-M-A.  But...  

          Dana nods, smiling, waiting for Johnny to think.

                                        JOHNNY
                        My guy's not a Doctor yet...?

                                        DANA
                        Or maybe he's not a Medical Doctor.
                                (off Johnny's look,
                                hands him the second
                                file)
                        The answer is both.  Guy named
                        Thomas Berke graduated from  
                        M-I-T in 1992 with a Bachelors
                        in Computer Science... went
                          straight into the grad program
                        to pursue a doctorate degree.

                                        JOHNNY
                        So he's in Boston...

                                        DANA
                        Vancouver.  Quit M-I-T in '98. 
                        Never completed his degree. 
                        Believe me, Johnny, this guy was
                        harder to track down than you are
                          nowadays.  He doesn't even have
                        an unlisted phone number.

                                        JOHNNY
                        But you found him in Vancouver.

                                        DANA
                        Used every trick I got, and some
                        I made up.  I think I have to go
                          a Celtics game with an assistant
                          professor... here's the address...

          She hands the last sheet to him...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (genuinely impressed)
                        How do you do that?

                                        DANA
                        It's what I do.  How do you do
                        that Dead Zone thing?
                                (off his grin)
                        You owe me one.  Again.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (with an intimacy)
                        I owe you a lot more than one.

          And he's out.  Dana watches him go...


  1313EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

          Purdy's Limo soars along the freeway.


  1414INT. PURDY'S LIMO - DAY - TRAVELING

          Purdy adjusts some papers on his lap.  Johnny sits facing
          him, staring out the window.  Purdy watches him.

                        What are you thinking about?

                                        JOHNNY
                          A storm's coming.

    14CONTINUED:14

          Purdy looks out the window.

                                        PURDY
                        Weather reports didn't say
                          anything.

          Johnny gives him a look, "trust me."  Purdy nods.

                                        JOHNNY
                          I really appreciate this, Gene. 
                        You really came through.

                                        PURDY
                        You're welcome.
                                (beat)
                        And now I'm hoping you'll do me a
                        small favor.

          Purdy, slightly chagrined, hands the documents in his
          hands to a curious Johnny.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What's this?

                        It's a statement, which I'm hoping
                        you'll sign, that defines your
                          relationship to Faith Heritage
                          Alliance.  Basically delineates
                        you as a separate entity, something
                        you've actually been asking for. 
                        To make clear...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (dry)
                        ...The views and opinions expressed

                        reflect those of Faith Heritage,
                        so please don't sue us.  Right?

                                        PURDY
                        In legalese... something like
                        that.

                                        JOHNNY
                        If Thomas Berke can give us the
                          evidence we need to prove this...

                                        PURDY
                        And if he can't, what then?  You'll
                        back off?  I know you better than
                        that.

                              (a beat)
                          I admire you more than you can
                        imagine and I'll never, ever stand
                        in your way.  But like you, I
                        feel a responsibility to more
                        than myself.  I, too, feel a storm
                        is coming.  And I must protect my
                        house.

          Now it's Purdy who wields a demanding tone.  Johnny signs
          the documents.

          REVEAL the limo is crossing the field and approaching the

  1616EXT. VANCOUVER - DAY - ESTABLISHING


  1717EXT. GAS LAMP DISTRICT - DAY

          A taxi with signage that establishes we're in Vancouver
          pulls to the curb on a run-down sidestreet... Two young
          JUNKIES watch as Johnny steps out, regarding a slip of
          paper in his hand.  Johnny surveys the bleak terrain...
          can this possibly be the right address?  As the driver
          pulls away... Johnny walks in the street-level entrance
          of a three story walk-up. 


  1818INT. SEEDY HALLWAY - DAY

          Each step Johnny takes down the hall fills him with doubt;
          this doesn't look or feel like the right place for the
          man he saw in his vision.  As he walks, he hears: A baby
          cries in one apartment.  A man and woman scream at each
          other in Chinese in another.

          Johnny finds the apartment listed on his paper.  Rock
          music from inside.  Johnny, hesitant, knocks on the door.  

          No one answers for a beat, and Johnny is almost relieved. 
          Then, the door opens, revealing a 30 year old man in a
          grubby "Dr. Who" T-Shirt, clutching a forty of Boons. 
          Johnny, and we, are surprised to recognize him as THOMAS
          BERKE, however unshaven and long of hair.  At first glance,
          he appears to be Charles Manson.

          And with that Thomas closes the door in Johnny's face. 

          Off Johnny, standing in the hall, alone, and staggered.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                        THOMAS (O.S.)
                        Go away!

                                        JOHNNY
                                (yelling through the
                                door)
                        If I could just have a word with
                        you...  

            A CHINESE MAN sticks his head out the door... it's the
          same man who was yelling at his wife... and now he's
          yelling at Johnny...

                        CHINESE MANJOHNNY
                (in Chinese)(to the door)
              YOU'RE MAKING A RACKET OUTIt's about Anza.
            HERE.  PEOPLE LIVE HERE
            YOU KNOW?   

          The door opens.

                                        THOMAS
                        Excuse me?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm sorry, I meant to say your
                        biotech software that's supposed
                        to model complex chemical
                        reactions.  And maybe do some
                          gene-mapping on the side.

                                        CHINESE MAN
                                (in Chinese)
                        DON'T DO YOUR BUSINESS IN THE
                          HALLWAY!

                                        THOMAS
                                (in Chinese)
                        Go inside, old man.

          The old Chinese man grunts and glares and goes inside...
          Thomas pulls Johnny into his apartment.


  2020INT. THOMAS' APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

          A one room flat that is in fact been transformed into
            something otherworldly - from one end to the other, there


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: THE OUTSIDER - ACT TWO - REV. 10/25/02 - PINK  19.

          is a homebuilt supercomputer - multiple, open pieces of
          panels and exposed microchips and wiring throughout the
          room, multiple screens all of which display virtual Bonsai
          trees... (Note: it's worth taking a look at the film "Pi"
          to see the walk-in homebuilt supercomputer)...

          Johnny is awed.  It's clear this is a man with an
            obsession... and he's a man with cats, three Siamese cats
          check out Johnny as he enters... 

                                        THOMAS
                        So you've found me.  I don't know
                        how, but you've found me.
                                (Off Johnny's confusion)
                        You're from M-I-T.  Who sent you,
                          McLusker?  What, was the flight
                        too much for him?  I know the fat
                        bastard hates to fly...

                                        JOHNNY
                        You've got the wrong idea.

                                        THOMAS
                        Yeah, I know!  Everyone knows
                        that.  If I had the right idea,
                        you guys wouldn't have pulled my
                        grant out from under me and stabbed
                        me in the back!  But it's my wrong
                        idea.  Not theirs.  And if they
                        think they can just fly someone
                        up here to buy my data... then
                        they're wrong.  Wrong.

          One of the cats looks up to him with concern at his raised
          voice... meows... he picks up the cat... strokes it in
          his arms...

                                        THOMAS
                        Tell them I'm not doing Anza any
                        more. 
                                (re:the virtual bonsai)
                        Virtual bonsai gardening.  Much
                        more rewarding.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm not from M-I-T.  I'm not buying
                        or selling anything.  My name is
                        Johnny Smith.  I'm from a small
                        town in Maine.  Cleaves Mills.    

          Thomas looks at Johnny with curiosity.

                                        JOHNNY
                        About seven years ago, I was
                          involved in a near-fatal car
                          accident.  The trauma altered my
                        brain chemistry.  Now, when I
                        touch someone, or something, I
                        can see into the future, or the
                        past. 
                                (beat)
                        Like clairvoyance.   

          Thomas cracks a smile that says, "okay, this guy is clearly
            a fruitcake... but harmless."

                                        THOMAS
                        Well.  Why didn't you say so?  
                        That's much more interesting.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I've seen the future and Anza is
                        going to work.

                                        THOMAS
                        Do you like Chamomile tea?

          He moves to a hot plate.  Johnny sighs with frustration,
          pursues Thomas...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't know how, or when, or
                        what inspires your breakthrough,
                        but it will come.  Unfortunately,
                        it'll be too late to prevent a
                        side effect in a drug called
                        Revivatin.  I'm here because I
                        think I can help you do it sooner.

                                        THOMAS
                        Let me get this straight: you're
                        gonna poke your head into the
                        future, kind of bypass the ninety
                        nine percent perspiration, find
                        that one percent inspiration, and
                        just warp back here and give me
                        the answer.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You don't believe a word I'm
                        saying.

            Returning with the tea...

                        It doesn't matter what I believe. 
                        It's just doesn't happen that
                        way.  

          He hands Johnny the tea and as he does...

                                                                        DEAD ZONE TO:


  2121INT. HOSPITAL DELIVERY ROOM - DAY (VISION)

          And we track 360 degrees around Thomas, wiping out the
          street and turning it into a DELIVERY ROOM where Thomas
          now holds the hand of CLAIRE, 35, raven hair and green
          eyes, as she strains to give birth...

          Johnny stands behind Thomas, who is significantly cleaned
          up, closer to how he looked in the Senate hearing.

                                        THOMAS
                        Come on, Claire, come on baby,
                        that's it.  Push...

          And we hear a cry.  Claire gasps, taking in air.  So does
          Thomas.  The OBSTETRICIAN takes the baby, and, as the
          NURSE wraps her in a blanket, a look passes between Doctor
          and Nurse, concerned eyes above surgical masks.

                                        THOMAS
                        What?  What's wrong?

          The Obstetrician takes the baby from the Nurse.

                                        OBSTETRICIAN
                        Get Dr. Murkav.

          The Nurse heads out of the room.  Thomas' eyes follow
          her, anxious, then are brought back to his baby when she
          cries out again.

                                        OBSTETRICIAN
                        I'm sorry... 

          The Doctor steps forward, and Thomas sees into the blanket.

                                        THOMAS
                        Dear God.

          Thomas slowly reaches out, almost involuntarily, to touch
          his newborn.  A tiny, withered hand reaches out of the
          blanket, into the sharp light of the room.

                                        OBSTETRICIAN (O.S.)
                        We've been getting reports of
                        this syndrome from other hospitals. 
                        Right now we're not sure of the
                          cause...

          As Thomas' fingers touch his daughter's...


  2222BACK TO SCENE

          Johnny comes out of the vision, disturbed.  Thomas
          notices...

                                        THOMAS
                        Hey, are you okay...?  What just
                          happened...?

                                        JOHNNY
                        The drug I was telling you about,
                          Revivatin... is going to cause
                        severe birth defects in a few
                        years.
                                (more to himself,
                                  thoughts spinning)
                        And you're going to have a child
                        who's suffers this defect.

          Thomas studies this strange guy and this is just getting
          too weird now...

                                        THOMAS
                        I don't know what your deal is...
                        but that's really not funny...

                                        JOHNNY
                                  (insisting)
                        In about five or six years.  It
                        must be what motivates you to
                        find the cause...  Your wife has
                        black hair, and green eyes...

                                        THOMAS
                        Hey, I can't get a girl to look
                        at me much less procreate...

                                        JOHNNY
                        ...You called her Claire.

                        Claire?

          Thomas looks flustered for a moment.

                        We can't wait five years to find
                        the proof.  This drug is coming
                        out next week.

                        This isn't something you solve in
                        a week!  I've worked on this for
                        five years with no results.  It's
                        called failure.

          He moves to a Bonsai and begins to prune it electronically.

                                        THOMAS

                        let the cats out.

          A beat.  This is clearly a lost soul whose thoughts have
          moved inward into the black hole of his failure... Johnny
          has no alternative but to exit...


  2323EXT. BUILDING - DAY

          As Johnny comes out.  His mind works.  He can't waste any
          more time.  He dials his cell phone.

                        Absolutely not.  Revivatin was
                          subjected to rigorous clinical

                        Okay, I warned you.

                        After you left I started
                          thinking... and then, after I saw
                        the story about you on TV, I
                        started working.  Back to the

                        There's something else, about
                        what you said... about my future. 
                        You said there was a girl named
                        Claire, I said I didn't know

          He runs a nervous hand through his hair and laughs.

                        We haven't spoken in three years! 
                        She wasn't even into me, and he's
                        telling me we're gonna get married? 
                        It's not in the realm of

                        where she was working... I knew I

          He signals for a pen to write with - Dana hands him one...

          His hair is now shorn short, and he's wearing Johnny's

          as she opens the door.  Both exclaim their "Hey's" and
          Thomas extends his hand to shake.  She moves for the hug.

          The bar is in an anteroom to the dining area.  Dana and
          Johnny sit with their backs to that room, but they can
          watch Thomas and Claire through the mirror behind the
          bar.  Right now, they can see the reunion embrace.

          In the reflection, Thomas and Claire are led to their

                          coincidence.  The stars just
                        haven't aligned yet.

                                        DANA
                        And you're gonna line 'em up?

                                        JOHNNY
                        He's a scientist, she's a
                        scientist, he's always had a crush
                        on her, they get together in three
                        years and I bet it's both of them
                        who figure this out.  I just need
                        to speed up that timeline.

                                        DANA
                        Like by Sunday?

                                        JOHNNY
                        You got a better idea?   


  4949AT THE LUNCH TABLE - CLAIRE AND THOMAS

          Claire and Thomas are mid-laugh.  Claire is energetic,
            genuinely happy to see him.  Thomas is a bag of nerves,
          and is trying his best to disguise it.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: THE OUTSIDER - ACT THREE - 10/21/02 - WHITE  38.


    49CONTINUED:49

                                        CLAIRE
                        Last thing I heard, you up and
                        left McLusker's group, a few months
                        short of getting your doctorate. 

          Thomas smiles a certain smile.  It spreads to Claire.

                          THOMASCLAIRE
                McLusker.McLusker.

          They share a laugh.  Thomas eases up. 

                                        THOMAS
                        Well, you know how I feel about
                          Doctors.  I figured if I ever
                        became one I'd never forgive
                        myself. 

          Another mutual laugh.  Then, Thomas lies through his teeth.

                                        THOMAS
                        What happened is, an opportunity
                        came along and I had to take it.

                                        CLAIRE
                        This would be the government thing.

                                        THOMAS
                        Right.  Right.

                                        CLAIRE
                        Can you tell me about it?

                                        THOMAS
                        Uh, no, not really...

                                        CLAIRE
                        Well, whatever it is, it looks
                        like it agrees with you...  I
                        mean, you used to be unraveling
                        at the seams... and now...

                                        THOMAS
                        You look exactly the same,
                          Claire...

          She smiles... he smiles... and this is really going well...


  5050WITH JOHNNY AND DANA IN THE BAR

            Straining to follow the action...

                        He's getting up... something's
                          wrong...

          Suddenly Thomas enters furtively...

                                        THOMAS
                        Touch this.

          He's holding a glass of water in his hands...

                                        DANA
                        What are you doing?

                                        THOMAS
                        It's her water glass.  I told her
                        it had a crack in it and I'd
                        replace it.  Touch it and tell me
                        what she's thinking. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Thomas, get back there.

                                        THOMAS
                        Come on, I have to know.

          Johnny picks up the glass, closes his eyes.  Opens them.

                                        JOHNNY
                        She's into you, man.  Just take
                        it easy, be yourself, you'll be
                        fine. 

          Thomas nods, trying to psyche himself up.  He takes the
          glass and heads back.  Dana looks at Johnny.

                                        DANA
                        You really see anything?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Kid who washes the glasses is
                        gay.

          Dana nods. 


  5151BACK TO TABLE - CLAIRE AND THOMAS

          Thomas sets down her glass as he sits (same glass).

                                        THOMAS
                        You're safe now.

                                        CLAIRE
                        What'd that guy at the bar want?

                        What guy?

                                        CLAIRE
                        I saw you in the mirror, you
                        stopped to talk to them.

          Thomas looks at the wall-length mirror behind him, which
          reflects the dining area and the bar room beyond.  Shit.

                                        THOMAS
                        Oh, that guy.  He was asking for
                        directions to the interstate. 
                        So, Claire.  Let's talk about
                        you.  Seen you guys in the news
                        lately.

                                        CLAIRE
                        Isn't that crazy?  Some nutjob
                        comes out of the woodwork and
                        makes these crazy accusations and
                        the press actually reports it...

                                        THOMAS
                        Have you guys looked into his
                        claims?  On your end?

                                        CLAIRE
                        We went through regular clinical
                        testing for a year and a half. 
                        FDA approved us without batting
                        an eye.  Tell you the truth, I'm
                          thinking of using the stuff myself.

                                        THOMAS
                        Don't.

          He's so abrupt and emphatic that a couple DINERS at the
          adjacent table notice.  Claire is slightly thrown.

                                        THOMAS
                        I mean, there's no need.  You're
                          beautiful... 

          Thomas cuts himself off.  Claire reddens.  The lunch 
          just got officially awkward.  She tries to steer back.

                                        CLAIRE
                        Thanks, but... thirty's right
                        around the corner, and I've got a
                        couple of lines already starting
                        to make their attack.

                        I don't know if I'm ready to wave
                          good-bye to my twenties just yet.

                                        THOMAS
                        What about your future? 
                          Children... aren't you worried at
                        all about potential birth defects?

                                        CLAIRE
                        Can we talk about something else?

                        What?  Yes, I'm sorry.

                                        CLAIRE
                        Okay.

                                        THOMAS
                          I just...  I don't want you to do
                          anything you're going to regret. 
                        In the future.

                                        CLAIRE
                        Thomas, where is this coming from?

          Claire's eyes widen as something hits her.  She looks
          past Thomas to the wall-length mirror, at the reflection
          of the bar in the background.  She turns around in her
          chair and looks directly at the bar... at the couple
          sitting there... at their reflection in the bar mirror. 
          At Johnny Smith.

                                        CLAIRE
                        Oh my God.  That's the guy.  The
                        psychic guy...
                                (turns to Thomas)
                        And you were talking to him.

          Thomas looks guilty all over. 

                                        CLAIRE
                        What's going on?  Why is he here? 
                        Do you know him?

                                        THOMAS

          Several other DINERS are now looking over at them.

  5252EXT. RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS - DAY - SURVEILLANCE POV

          Snap shots freeze framing the action every second or so. 
          We are watching from across the street as Claire exits
          the restaurant, upset, and gets into her car parked nearby. 
          Thomas exits the restaurant behind her, distressed, calling
          for her to wait.  Claire quickly drives off.  Johnny and
          Dana exit the restaurant a beat later.


  5353BACK TO SCENE

          Johnny walks up to Thomas, who watches Claire's car go.

                        See for yourself.

          Thomas grabs Johnny's arm.  We RAMP around them and settle
          again, but we don't see what Johnny saw.

                                        THOMAS
                        We don't get together, anymore,
                        do we?
                                (Johnny doesn't answer)
                        DO WE?

                        I'll get the car.

          She moves away...

                        I knew it.  I knew this wouldn't

                        you ever consider that time would

                        many more babies' lives will that
                        cost, you think, John?  How much
                        worse did we make the future today?  

          Dana pulls the car over and he gets in, slams the door...
          Johnny just stands there as we pull back slowly...

                                                                              FADE OUT.

          She reacts, about to speak, but he holds up her hands to

          snaps... he grabs the first thing he sees... a monitor
          and throws it to the floor... and another... and now...
          he's turning over equipment... and it's sparking and

          Thomas has a spread sheet of equations running across the

          he's reaching into the refrigerator for a leftover half
          of a Dana sandwich when the phone rings...

  6161INT. LAB - NIGHT (INTERCUT AS NEEDED)

          Claire, on the phone, hesitates.

                        I'm in trouble, Thomas.  They saw
                        me at the restaurant...

                                        THOMAS
                        Who saw you?

                        The company.  They suspect an
                        insider has been working with
                        Johnny Smith.  I am now "under

                        This is all my fault.  I told
                        Smith about you.

                        That's where I live.  In a four
                        hundred square foot apartment in
                        the one bad part of the city.  I
                        don't work for the government, I

                        of months ago...

          Thomas' voice trails off as it becomes shaky.

                        I told Johnny it was a crush, but
                        that's a lie... that's taking
                        love for granted and I don't want
                        to take you for granted.  But I
                        guess I screwed that up, too. 
                        Like always. 

          Claire has forgotten about her troubles for a moment,
            genuinely concerned and bewildered by Thomas' revelations.

                        I've ever met...

          And now Thomas is almost overcome.

                                        THOMAS
                        I got some problems... I'm sorry
                        you had to see it.  I'm sorry I
                        made them yours.

                        What did this psychic guy do to

                                        THOMAS
                        He didn't.  He was just trying to
                        do the right thing.  He really
                          believes Revivatin is unsafe. 
                        And he says that Anza will prove
                        it...

                                        CLAIRE
                        And you believe him.

                                        THOMAS
                        I just didn't want to take any
                          chances.  Not with you. 
                                (beat)
                        Not with us.

          And that touches her... and begins to take this out of
          the scientific realm... and makes it personal... suddenly
            something inside her is scared about Revivatin too... she
          makes a decision.

          Johnny's Jeep pulls into the drive.  He abruptly taps on
