      AN EYE STARING AHEAD INTENSELY.  And as we PULL OUT, we 
      discover an OPEN CUT just above it.  And this eye belongs to -

      OUR BOY.  Dark hair.  Twelve years old.  Good looking.  And 
      as we PULL UP we see he s on his back -- lying on what looks 
      like BLACKTOP PAVEMENT.  A SCHOOLYARD?  We ain t on the 
      island, that s for sure.

      And right now a BIG KID -- fourteen and a real MEATHEAD -- 
      stands over OUR BOY wielding a clenched fist --

                                  MEATHEAD
                    Stay down.

      OUR BOY looks past Meathead, SEES --

      ANOTHER GOON pounding on a smaller KID.  The kid desperately 
      locks eyes with Our Boy between punches -- Help me.  OUR BOY 
      grits his teeth, starts to get up, but --

      Meathead gets RIGHT in his face (he s head taller) --

                                  MEATHEAD
                    Your choice, man -- Walk away now, 
                    you won t get your ass kicked.

      And the FIGHT behind Meathead is intensifying, the other kid 
      just getting PUMMELLED...

      The dilemma is clearly etched across OUR BOY S face -- He 
      knows what will happen if he helps his friend -- Knows he 
      doesn t stand a chance.  Yeah, he COULD walk away...

      But he doesn t.  PUSHES past Meathead -- but the kid is too 
      big and he grabs Our Boy by the arm and YANKS him back --

      And as Meathead shakes his head, cocking his FIST back to 
      literally knock Our Boy s head CLEAN FUCKING OFF, he leaves 
      us with a final piece of wisdom --

                                  MEATHEAD
                    Shoulda stayed down, Jack.

      (CONT'D):11

      And with the swift CRUNCH of contact --

                                                                    CUT TO BLACK:

      AND IN THAT BLACKNESS22

      we hear a familiar BRITISH VOICE shouting excitedly --

                                    CHARLIE (O.S.)
                    Jack?  Jack!  HEY JACK!


      JACK snaps out of a DAZE -- maybe half asleep.  Finds himself 
      sitting on the beach.  And right now CHARLIE is running 
      towards him, FULL TILT --

                                    CHARLIE
                    You ve gotta -- someone s out 
                    there!  The current!  Someone s --*

      Jack gets to his feet, as DISORIENTED as we are --

                        JACKCHARLIE
      What?
                                                  -- Someone s out there!

      And Jack is instantly ALERT.  Because Charlie is gesturing 
      towards the OCEAN --

                                    CHARLIE (CONT D)
                    I woke up -- I don t swim and...*

      But Jack is already SCANNING the water in the dawn light.  
      And GODDAMMIT...

      There IS someone out there.  Really fucking FAR OUT THERE.  
      We can JUST make out an ARM frantically waving for help as...

      ADRENALINE KICKS IN.  INSTINCT TAKES OVER.  And Jack is 
      PULLING OFF HIS SHIRT as he sprints for the water and he...

      DIVES IN.  And we go with him into --

      THE OCEAN

      As Jack s arms CUT through the water -- his face emerging 
      every ten strokes to take a GAPING BREATH -- a fucking 
      machine as he POWERS towards --

      THE PERSON OFF IN THE DISTANCE -- struggling to keep their 
      head above water -- still so FAR AWAY --




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST     "White Rabbit"     (PRODUCTION DRAFT)     8/4/04    3.
      (CONT'D):33

      And we re MOVING TIGHTER on Jack with every stroke -- his 
      purpose SINGULAR -- and he s closing that distance, but --

      The victim DISAPPEARS under the surface of the water.

      And we re WITH JACK in the ten seconds it takes to get to the 
      spot where they went under -- he takes a DEEP BREATH and 
      DIVES underneath the surface after them --

      And we wait.  And WAIT...

      Waves.  Ocean.  NO ONE.  Then -- Jack emerges, GASPING for 
      air!  But ALONE.  Takes another RAGGED BREATH as he --

      DIVES UNDER AGAIN.  And this time we sit on the surface even 
      longer.  BEAT.  ANOTHER BEAT.  How can ANYONE hold their 
      breath this long?  And just when we re counting Jack out --

      He EXPLODES to the surface!  And this time, he s got someone 
      with him.  We recognize the victim instantly --

      It s BOONE.  COUGHING up water.  GASPING for air.  But ALIVE.

                                  JACK
                    Deep breaths -- c mon, man -- relax 
                    -- you re okay -- deep breaths...

      And as Jack wraps him into a CROSS-CHEST CARRY and begins to 
      swim back to shore, we re CLOSE ON BOONE.  Completely SPENT.  
      But his lips are moving -- trying to SAY something.  Too 
      weak.  But he WILLS HIMSELF to do it.  And finally --

                                  BOONE
                    Did you... get her?

                                  JACK
                    What?

                                  BOONE
                    The woman... out there... I was 
                    trying to...
                          (focused)
                    Did you get her?

      WHAT?!  And Jack instantly turns back away from the shore, 
      THREADS WATER with one arm, holds Boone afloat with the other -

      JACK S POV - PANICKED.  HANDHELD.  Scanning the ocean from 
      side to side -- How could he not seen...?

      And OH FUCKING SHIT!  Because there -- ANOTHER hundred yards 
      out -- IS A WOMAN.  And she is about to go UNDER.




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST     "White Rabbit"     (PRODUCTION DRAFT)     8/4/04    4.
      (CONT'D): (2)33


                      BOONEJACK
      You have to get her ---- No -- Current s too strong
                                                  -- You won t make it back...*

                                  BOONE
                    LEAVE ME.

      Here s Boone.  Exhausted.  A sack of rocks in Jack s arm.

      And there s the WOMAN.  About to dip below the surface.  And 
      so far away we can t even make out her face.

      So it s Sophie s fucking choice here, folks.  And we --

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

      THE BEACH44

      As Jack heroically PULLS Boone out of the shallows and to the 
      safety of the beach.

      Some of the OTHERS (MICHAEL, WALT, SUN, HURLEY) here now --  *
      CHARLIE and KATE splash into the water, wrapping their arms  *
      around Boone --

      And as soon as they relieve Jack of the burden, he is already 
      turning back towards the ocean --

                                  KATE
                    Jack!

                                  JACK
                    There s someone else out there.

    A MOMENT.  Jack was spent before he swam out to get Boone and 
      back.  But he s going to go back in.  He s GOT to go back in.

      And Kate knows it.

      And time resumes as Jack DIVES back in -- Arms, legs, heart, 
      mind... all furiously dedicated to saving that woman..

      But we stay HERE.  And we re already PULLING BACK and UP.  
      OVER the gathered crowd at the shallows so all we see is --

      JACK.  Swimming out into the ocean.  A single figure cutting 
      through an endless expanse of BLUE.  And he can swim forever, 
      but it s painfully obvious to us...

      There s no one left to save.

                                    END OF TEASER



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST     "White Rabbit"     (PRODUCTION DRAFT)     8/4/04    5.


                                        ACT ONE


      We start CLOSE ON BOONE -- His blue eyes UNBLINKING as they 
      stare out towards the ocean.  PULL BACK to find --

      He s still shirtless.  Barefoot.  And the intensity in his 
      eyes.  If we had to guess at what he s feeling right now,  
      we d have to go with ANGER.  No sense of how long he s been 
      sitting here...

      But it s been awhile.

      And now Boone s gaze floats elsewhere on the beach.  Off in 
      the distance.  Onto JACK.  Walking towards the INFIRMARY  
      TENT, inexplicably carrying a full length MIRROR.*

      And now we leave Boone to join him as --

      DOWN THE BEACH66

      KATE moves to catch up with Jack, concern in her eyes.  
      Because now that we re closer, we can clearly see --

      Jack has seen better days.  UNSHAVEN.  EXHAUSTED.  And 
      because he is who he is, beating himself up for the life he 
      didn t save.

                                  KATE

                                  KATE*

      Jack shakes his head.  Hard to stomach the brutal irony --

                                  JACK
                    She was swimming this morning.  
                    Just swimming.  Riptide caught her.
                          (beat)
                    We ve been here six days and we 
                    never talked.  I never said a word 
                    to her.  There were --

                        KATEJACK
      Jack.  Don t.-- forty seven of us.  I 
                                                  didn t say a single word.

      And Kate is not a big believer in feeling sorry for oneself --

                                  KATE
                    You tried.

      Jack finally stops walking.  Puts the MIRROR down.  Turns to 
      look at Kate for the first time --

                                  JACK
                    No.  I didn t.  I thought maybe I 
                    could... I thought I could bring 
                    him back and still have time.  I 
                    was there -- in the water...*
                          (beat)
                    I didn t try.  I decided not to go *
                    after her.

      Kate doesn t know what to say to that.  And that s when it 
      happens --

      Jack goes WHITE.

                                  KATE
                      What s...?

      But Jack isn t looking at her.  He s looking PAST her.  WAY 
      past her.  And the SOUND DROPS OUT as we follow his gaze to --

      THE OCEAN.  There.  In the shallows.  A MAN.

      And we re TOO FAR AWAY to see his face, but he s wearing a 
      SUIT.  And he s WAIST DEEP in the water.  Just standing 
      there.  Facing us.  Facing Jack.

      And it s fucking CREEPY.

                                  KATE (O.S.)
                    Jack?




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST     "White Rabbit"     (PRODUCTION DRAFT)     8/4/04    7.
      (CONT'D): (2)66

      SOUND rushes IN -- Jack s attention is drawn back to Kate...

                                  KATE
                    Are you okay?

      But Jack is already looking back towards the ocean, MOVING 
      TOWARDS IT, in fact, But --

      There s no one there.

                                  JACK
                    You see that?

                                  KATE
                          (confused)
                    See what?

                                  JACK
                    He was just standing there... in 
                    the water.  A man.

      Jack turns back to her.  DESPERATE.  Needing her to tell him 
      he s not going fucking nuts.  Needing her to tell him she saw 
      the same thing he did.

                                  KATE
                    Jack...

      And her face says it all.  Jack is visibly distraught --

                                  JACK
                    You didn t see him?

                                  KATE
                          (tenderly)
                    When s the last time you slept?

      But Jack isn t in the mood for tenderness right now.  And he 
      sure as shit isn t answering that question, either.  He just 
      picks up the MIRROR...*

                                  JACK
                    I have to put this with the rest of 
                    the gear.

      And with that, Jack walks off.  And as KATE watches him go, 
    we begin to drift --

      AROUND THE BEACH77

      And there s a new feeling here amongst the castaways today.  
      One of LOSS.  They ve all heard about the woman who drowned --




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST         "White Rabbit"        (PINK)         8/9/04     8.
      (CONT'D):77

      But none of them are actually TALKING ABOUT IT.  We FIND --

      MICHAEL

      Still a little GIMPY from his run-in with the boar.  He 
      stands barefoot on the beach, BRUSHING HIS TEETH.  WALT  *
      stands next to his father, doing the same.

      Michael holds a cup of OCEAN WATER in a coffee mug.  Brings  *
      it to his lips.  Sloshes it around his mouth.  SPITS.   *
      Refills the mug.  Hands it to Walt.

                                  MICHAEL
                    Don t swallow it, okay?

                                  WALT
                    Why not?

                                  MICHAEL
                     Cause it s from the ocean.  It ll *
                    make you thirsty.

                                  WALT
                    Why?

      Michael is not up for the  constant barrage of questions  
      thing.  Especially today.

                                  MICHAEL
                    Just don t swallow it, man.

      Walt knows when to push and when not to.  So he takes the 
      cup.  Rinses.  And SPITS.

      And we PULL BACK to see Michael and Walt from afar.  SOMEONE 
      watching them.  And it s --

      SUN88

      She watches Michael and Walt from the TREE LINE.

      Sun is snapped out of her quiet observance as --

    A FINGER reaches into frame, gently touches her CHAPPED LIPS.   *
      Sun jumps -- immediately looks at --

      JIN.  He speaks softly (but not altogether kindly) in KOREAN.  
      As they re alone, we get the benefit of SUBTITLES --

                                  JIN
                    You need water.

                    No -- I m all right.  Thank you.

      He settles down next to her.

      And they sit in SILENCE for a few beats.  And we can see the 
      death of the woman... even though a stranger... it WEIGHS on 
      them, too.  And finally, it is SUN who speaks --

                                  SUN
                    When will someone tell us what to 
                    do?

                                  JIN
                          (surprised)
                    What?

                                  SUN
                    I don t think anyone is coming.

                                  JIN
                          (not so sure)
                    Someone will come.

      Sun shakes her head.  Unable to challenge what she clearly 
      knows is her husband s DENIAL --

                                  SUN
                    The others... they ignore us.  If 
                    we tried harder to communicate...

                                  JIN
                    We ll be fine.  We don t need them.

      And then, in an attempt to be reassuring --

                                  JIN
                    I will tell you what to do.

      And if Sun were actually looking into her husband s eyes 
      right now, she might see the same thing we do --

      Doubt.  But for now, we re MOVING ON AS --

    A LONG PAIR OF STUNNING LEGS99

      Tromp by Sun & Jin, dainty plastic SUNFLOWERS adorning a pair 
      of PINK FLOP-FLOPS as the feet within them stride with great 
      purpose towards --

    A PAIR OF FANTASTICALLY CRAFTED COWBOY BOOTS.  Toes in the 
      air.  One tapping to a tune no one can hear but its wearer.




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST     "White Rabbit"     (PRODUCTION DRAFT)     8/4/04    10.
      (CONT'D):99

      The Flip-Flops stop.  Square off against the boots.  A tense 
      beat.  Then --

                                  SHANNON (O.S.)
                    Have you got it or what?

      And we PAN UP to reveal the Flip-Flops belong to SHANNON.  
      The boots, of course, are on --

                                  SAWYER
                    You re in my light, sticks.

      SAWYER sits on a MAKESHIFT DECK CHAIR.  Doesn t even look up 
      as he reads a battered paperback --  WATERSHIP DOWN. 

                                  SHANNON
                       Lightsticks?   What the hell is 
                    that supposed to --

                                  SAWYER
                    Light.  Comma.  Sticks.  Meaning *
                    your legs.

      He turns a page.  This is a different side of Sawyer.  Less 
      directly adversarial with Shannon.  HMMMM.

                                  SAWYER
                    How s your brother?

                      SHANNONSAWYER
      What do you mean how --
                                                  -- Almost drowned, didn t he?

                                    SHANNON
                          (fuck you)
                    Look -- while I really love my new 
                    nickname and I think it s really 
                    sweet that you re asking...

                                  SAWYER
                    Calm down.  I got your damn stuff.

      And with that, Sawyer produces a can of BUG SPRAY from the 
      canvas bag at his feet as Shannon SCRATCHES her leg --

                                    SHANNON
                          (skeptical)
                    It ll keep off sand fleas?

                                  SAWYER
                    You bet.  And it s got aloe, too.




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST     "White Rabbit"     (PRODUCTION DRAFT)     8/4/04    11.
      (CONT'D): (2)99

                                  SHANNON
                    How much?

                        SAWYERSHANNON
      You serious?
                                                  -- Yeah, I m...

      And Sawyer finally puts his book down.  Looks at Shannon like 
      she just might be the stupidest person in the world.

                                  SAWYER
                    You in the same situation I am?  
                     Cause last I checked, we weren t 
                    going nowhere for awhile.
                          (slowly and clearly)
                    Your money s no good here.

                                    SHANNON
                    So what the hell do you want?
                          (then; dawning on her)
                    If you think that I m...

                                  SAWYER
                    Five grand.

      The effectively shuts her up.  After a beat --

                                    SHANNON
                    I thought you said money was no 
                    good here.

                                  SAWYER
                    I was negotiating.
                          (grins)
                    I ll take an IOU.  Somethin  tells 
                    me you re good for it.

      Shannon just looks at him.  Scratches her leg... but it 
      almost becomes a DEFIANT SCRATCH.  Then she straightens up.  
      Gives him the full on EVILEST EYE EVER --

                                    SHANNON
                    Screw you.

      And with that, she STALKS OFF.  Sawyer watches her go.  Drops 
      the bug spray back into his bag...

      And goes back to his book.

      And Claire stops talking -- Takes a step backwards, LOSING 
      HER BALANCE -- Kate immediately jumps up, steadying her --

                                  KATE
                    Whoa -- You okay?

      Claire shakes it off.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Yeah it s just the heat.
                          (bad joke)*
                    Oh.  And I m pregnant.

      Claire smiles.  Kate offers her a half-filled BOTTLE OF  *
      WATER.  Claire takes it appreciatively --

                                  CLAIRE
                    Thanks.

                                  KATE

                    the  practical clothes  from the

      Claire laughs.  Sits down.  Claire s eyes light up as she 
      spots a SUN HAT, puts it on --

                                  CLAIRE
                    Can I ask you something?  Don t 
                    mean to get personal, but I m 
                    curious.

                                  KATE
                          (stiffens; then)
                    Sure.  Shoot.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Are you a Gemini?

                          (surprised)
                    Yeah.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Thought so.  Restless.  Passionate.  
                    Everyone thinks Astrology is a load 
                    of crap, but that s because they 
                    don t understand it.  I could do 
                    your chart if you d like...
                          (Kate wouldn t like)
                    Ah.  All right then.
                          (shakes her head; sighs)
                    Geminis.

      Kate smiles at her.  Claire smiles back.  A genuine bond 
      between them.  And off this lovely moment we move BACK TO --


      JACK.  Still working.  Always working.  Eyes bloodshot. *

      Next to the tent, Jack has managed to drag a CARGO CONTAINER

      CLOSE ON JACK.  His eyes telling us that somehow his day 
      actually just go WORSE --

                    That s it?

      And we PULL OUT to find --

      Jack stands with CHARLIE AND HURLEY.  Next to them, one of 
      the RAIN STATIONS -- a jury-rigged TARP meant to collect 
      water.  But right now, all their attention is on --

    A RED SUITCASE.  Inside it, carefully arranged, BOTTLES OF 
      WATER.  Some bear the OCEANIC LABEL.  All about three 
      quarters full.

                                  JACK
                    How many?

                                    CHARLIE
                    Eighteen.

                                  HURLEY
                    People just took what they needed 
                     cause, y know we were supposed to 
                    be rescued?  But uh -- we weren t.  
                    And it hasn t rained, man.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Even if we divvied it up... split 
                    the bottles in half, it wouldn t be 
                    enough water for all forty-seven...

                                  JACK
                      Forty-six.
                          (beat)
                    There s forty-six now.

    A quiet moment as they all absorb the implication.  Then --

                                  HURLEY
                    It s getting pretty toasty out

      And they re looking to Jack for these answers.  And we can 
      FEEL his pain.  The enormous load he s bearing.  The enormous 
      load the others PUT ON HIM --

                                  JACK
                    I don t know.

                        HURLEYCHARLIE
      Maybe we can make one of 
      those water-finding sticks...-- Where should we put what 
                                                  we ve got?

                                  JACK

      And Jack is WALKING AWAY now, it s just TOO FUCKING MUCH...

      But Charlie picks up the RED SUITCASE.  He and Hurley nipping 
      at Jack s heels as he heads back for the infirmary tent --

                      CHARLIEHURLEY
      We should put it in the tent,

                      CHARLIEHURLEY
      Probably better if no one 
      knows how little is left...-- Dogs can find pot and 
                                                  bombs, so they can find 
                                                    water...

      They arrive at the infirmary tent and Charlie places the  *
      suitcase of water just inside the flap.*

                                    CHARLIE
                          (to Jack)
                    If you tell the others we re 
                    running low, we can ration it.  
                    That way you can decide who gets...

      And that does it.  The dam breaks.  Jack stops.  SPINS ON 
      BOTH OF THEM -- And he doesn t YELL, but it s fucking close --

                                  JACK
                    I m not deciding anything.

      And Hurley visibly flinches.  Not used to this from Jack.  
      Shit.  Neither are we.

                                  HURLEY
                          (quietly)
                    Why not?




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST         "White Rabbit"        (PINK)         8/9/04     15A.
      (CONT'D): (3)1212

      Jack GRITS his teeth.  Why not?  Why fucking not?















































                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST     "White Rabbit"     (PRODUCTION DRAFT)     8/4/04    16.
      (CONT'D): (4)1212

      Whatever the answer to that is, he ain t giving it to them.  
      So he turns.  And WALKS AWAY.

      And we stay with Jack as he leaves Charlie and Hurley in his 
      wake.  Moving closer.  CLOSER.  And finally, we re right on 
      his BLOODSHOT EYES as --


      Those same intense eyes.  UNBLINKING.

      Jack sits alone in the INFIRMARY TENT.  AND what s he staring 
      at?

      The OPEN RED SUITCASE that Charlie placed on the floor -- THE 
      EIGHTEEN BOTTLES OF WATER.

      And as if that wasn t enough to worry about here s -

                                  BOONE (O.S.)
                    Why didn t you leave me?

      Jack looks up to see BOONE standing in the opening of the 
      tent.  We get the feeling he s been working his way up to 
      this confrontation all morning.

      And this is the last fucking thing Jack needs.  He gets up, 
      exits the tent --

                                  JACK
                    Not now, man.*

                                  BOONE
                    I could have made it back.
                          (Jack ignores him)
                    What?  You re not gonna answer me?  
                    I told you to leave me, man.  I 
                    told you I could ve...

                                  JACK
                    You were drowning.

      And Boone can t argue that.  So --

                                  BOONE
                    You should ve saved her.

      Jack stands.  Gets in real close to Boone.  Something about  *
      his eyes -- something FRAYED.  But what he says, he says 
      quite SIMPLY --

                                  JACK
                    But I didn t save her.
                          (beat)
                    And neither did you.




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST     "White Rabbit"     (PRODUCTION DRAFT)     8/4/04    20.
      (CONT'D):1414

      And with that, Jack pushes past him and out to --*

      THE BEACH1515 *

      Boone isn t gonna be blown off.  Stays with Jack as he moves  *
      across the beach --*

                                  BOONE
                    You think you re all noble and 
                    heroic coming after me?  I was 
                    fine.  You re not the only one 
                    around here who knows what to do, 
                    man.  I run a business.  Who *
                    appointed you savior?  What gives 
                    you the right to...

      And although Boone continues his rant, his voice begins to 
      fall away.  Because Jack isn t looking at Boone anymore...

      He s looking over Boone s shoulder.  Because there s 
      something there.  No -- SOMEONE.

      OFF IN THE DISTANCE1616

      There on the TREE LINE.  Where beach meets jungle.

      The MAN IN THE SUIT and he s wearing WHITE TENNIS SHOES. *

      Too far away to discern the figure s identity.  Just standing 
      there.

      AND WE RE BACK WITH JACK1717

      Because he s not taking his eyes off the man this time.  He s 
      already walking away from Boone --

                                  BOONE
                          (shouts after him)
                    Hey -- Don t you walk away from me.  
                    Where the hell are you going?  HEY!

      But Jack is BREAKING INTO A RUN.  Eyes locked --

      ON THE TREE LINE1818

      Where the SUITED MAN turns around, heads INTO THE JUNGLE...

      AND JACK1919

      RUNS.  Stumbles in the sand -- but immediately regains his 
      footing.  SINGLE PURPOSE.  DESPERATE.




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST     "White Rabbit"     (PRODUCTION DRAFT)     8/4/04    21.
      (CONT'D):1919

      And we follow Jack ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE BEACH until he...


      BURSTS through the tree line.  The sun immediately obscured 
      by the JUNGLE CANOPY.  And Jack comes to an ABRUPT STOP 
      because --

      The Man In The Suit is ten yards away.

      Just standing still.  His back to Jack.  Close enough to make 
      out his GRAY HAIR.  And it s HAND-HELD.  CREEPY.  Jack takes 
    a few tentative steps forward.  Closing the distance...

      Jack reaches out to touch his shoulder... And the Man  *
      SUDDENLY TURNS!

      It s Jack s father.

      SHEPHARD.  Twenty years older.  But here.  On the island.

      And the SHOCK of this -- the fact that he s actually SEEING 
      this -- FLOORS Jack.  His eyes go WIDE as he literally 
      staggers backwards, TRIPS --

      And lands on his ass.

      His eyes never leave the fact of his father.  SO FUCKING MUCH 
      GOING ON -- but it s almost like Jack has regressed twenty-
      five years.  His voice almost childlike as he utters --

                                  JACK

                    Dad?

      And they LOCK EYES.

      But Shephard gives Jack nothing.  He just turns around.  And  *
      heads DEEPER INTO THE JUNGLE.

      And OFF JACK, eyes open wide.  FROZEN.  We --

                                                                    CUT TO BLACK:

                                  END OF ACT ONE










                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST     "White Rabbit"     (PRODUCTION DRAFT)     8/4/04    22.


                                        ACT TWO


      JACK is exactly where we left him.  Here where the jungle 
      meets the beach.

      And he s just BREATHING.  Fast.  ADRENALINE still pumping 
      with the weight of what he just saw.  Or what he THINKS he 
      just saw.

      And as we begin to CLOSE IN on Jack, we realize he s not just 
      breathing -- he s WHISPERING something.  Over and over and 
      over again...

      And now we re TIGHT enough to hear it --

                                  JACK
                          (whispers)
                    Gone... he s gone... he s gone...

      And as we begin to HEAR THE PATTER OF RAIN ON GLASS...


      JACK.  Still on his ass.  Brought out of his memory by --

      VOICES behind him.  Off in the distance.  And Jack looks over 
      his shoulder --

      BACK AT THE BEACH

      The CASTAWAYS milling around, doing their thing.  CHARLIE.  
      HURLEY.  BOONE.  Responsibility.

      And now Jack turns back towards THE JUNGLE.

      The way his father went.  And maybe the path of madness.

      TIME TO MAKE A DECISION.

      So Jack gets up.

      And walks into the jungle.

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

                    HEY!  HEY!

      FRANTIC.  HECTIC.  SEARCHING.  And the first person he comes 
      upon is KATE, immediately concerned--

                                  KATE
                    What s wrong?

                                  WALT
                    That pregnant lady fell down.

      CHAOS.  EVERYONE TALKING OVER EACH OTHER as Charlie and 
      Michael literally CARRY Claire across the beach towards the 
      INFIRMARY TENT.  Kate beside them --

      What happened?
                                                  -- She just dropped...*

                        KATEMICHAEL
    I was with her before -- the 
      heat... Is she breathing?
                                                  -- Where s the doctor?

                                  KATE
                    Let s get her inside --

      And we follow them --

      INSIDE THE TENT2727

      Michael and Charlie gently lay Claire down on the makeshift 
      BED of SEAT CUSHIONS.

                                    CHARLIE
                    She s breathing, I think...

      Kate leans over her --

                                  KATE
                    Claire?  Can you hear me?  Claire?  
                    Wake up...

      And THANK FUCKING GOD because Claire s eyes flutter open.  
      She looks around, confused --

                                    CHARLIE
                    What...?

                                  KATE
                    Claire, it s me -- Kate.  You 
                    passed out.  Take it easy okay?
                          (turns to Charlie)
                    She needs water.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Water.  Yeah.  There s some 
                    right...

      And Charlie turns to where the RED SUITCASE was...

      But it s gone.

                                  CHARLIE
                    What the...?!?




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST     "White Rabbit"     (PRODUCTION DRAFT)     8/4/04    27.

      Charlie madly pulls away various boxes, searching the tent.  
      But it s pretty clear that the suitcase isn t here.  Charlie 
      turns back to Kate...

                                  CHARLIE
                    The water s gone.

    I can go into the jungle.  
      Maybe find some fresh water.-- You re not going alone --

                    When the others find out we re out

                    I know where to look.

      And speaking of looking...


      JACK moves through the jungle.




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST     "White Rabbit"     (PRODUCTION DRAFT)     8/4/04    28.
      (CONT'D):2929

      This guy is literally COMING APART AT THE SEAMS.  A man 
      possessed.  Clearly in pursuit of something and someone that 
      couldn t possibly be here.  But that s not stopping him.

      Again, we re HAND-HELD.  DISORIENTED.  No rhyme or reason to 
      the direction that Jack is heading.  And he comes to --

    A CLEARING SURROUNDED BY DENSE JUNGLE

      And Jack STOPS.  Looks around him.  Has no idea where he is.  
      And maybe he doesn t care.  But we re starting to SLOWLY SPIN 
      AROUND HIM -- JACK, a man more lost now than ever before.  
      And it starts as a whisper...

                                  JACK
                    Where are you?

      Spinning FASTER NOW.  Jack louder --

                                  JACK
                    Where are you?

      And we re getting FUCKING DIZZY we re SPINNING SO FAST as --

                                  JACK
                    WHERE ARE YOU?!?

      And we SLAM INTO --


      COMPLETE SILENCE.  Jack stands frozen in the middle of the  *
      CLEARING where we left him.  Eerie.  No insects.  No birds.   *
      NOTHING.  Just the sound of his own BREATHING.

      And maybe it s just that Jack is literally at the end of his 
      fucking tether, but it s almost like we can FEEL A PRESENCE 
      here.  And Jack STOPS breathing because he hears something.

      THE CLINK OF ICE CUBES INSIDE A GLASS.

      And it s fucking CLOSE.  Jack WHIPS AROUND --




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST     "White Rabbit"     (PRODUCTION DRAFT)     8/4/04    31.
      (CONT'D):3131

      Nothing there.  But then the CRACK OF A TWIG snapping brings 
      his attention back to --

      THE SURROUNDING JUNGLE

      And Jack can just make out SOMEONE RUNNING THROUGH IT --

      The Man in the suit and white tennis shoes.  HIS FATHER. *

                                  JACK
                    Wait!

      And a new look of DETERMINATION falls over Jack s eyes.  
      Enough of this bullshit.  ENOUGH.  He s gonna catch him this 
      time.  He has to.

      So Jack cuts through the jungle, just catching GLIMPSES of 
      his father up ahead -- always far off, just out of reach.

      Jack pushes massive LEAVES aside -- and we re SO CLOSE on him 
      we lose perspective because Jack RUNS with such drive and 
      such purpose -- GAINING now, about to finally CATCH UP when --

      THE GROUND GIVES WAY.3232

      JACK FALLS FORWARD down an INCLINE -- FALLS ON HIS ASS -- 
      SCRAMBLING -- SLIDING -- Tries to STOP HIMSELF with his feet 
      but he s moving too fast and...

      OH SHIT -- He s flying off A ROCK SHELF and --

    A ROOT is all that saves him as his body goes over and his 
      LEGS KICK AT AIR because...

      Jack is hanging off the EDGE OF A CLIFF.  A hundred foot drop 
      to the ground.  Out here.  ALONE.

      And as we realize he s totally FUCKED...

                                      ACT THREE


      Jack right where we left him --

      CLINGING TO THE CLIFF FACE -- his grip slipping.

      And we wanna milk this.  Our guy.  Our hero.  Literally 
      facing DEATH and there is NO WAY he can escape it.

      Jack tries to wedge his foot amongst some rocks, but they re 
      LOOSE and...

      THE ROOT he s holding on to is PULLING FREE and ---

      GRIM RECOGNITION falls over Jack s WATERING EYES.  He s going 
      to die here.  Here on this fucking island --

      And just as the root is about to POP OUT OF THE CLIFF FACE --

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                    Take my hand.

      And Jack instinctively looks up at the SOUND OF THAT VOICE --

      It s LOCKE.

      Lying on his belly, extending his arm over the EDGE --

      And Jack barely registers the relief of seeing him before he 
      SLAPS his free hand into Locke s outstretched one just as the 
      ROOT COMES FREE, tumbles down into the abyss as --

      Locke GRUNTS, pulling Jack up and over the edge to SAFETY.

      Jack immediately rolls over, STARES up at the sky.  Quick 
      shallow breaths.  Borderline HYPERVENTILATION.

                                  LOCKE
                    You okay?

      Jack just nods.  Because he s not hyperventilating at all.  
      He s LAUGHING.  Louder now.  Hysterically.

      And okay, maybe it s a little insane, but this is what 
      happens when you ve been in a plane crash and haven t slept 
      and you re chasing your father through the jungle and you 
      almost fucking die.

      And as Locke looks on, starting to chuckle himself --




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST         "White Rabbit"        (BLUE)         8/6/04     33.

    A STUNNING SUNSET throws magical light across the camp as 
      various fires are lit - Night is falling.











































                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST     "White Rabbit"     (PRODUCTION DRAFT)     8/4/04    36.
      (CONT'D):3636

      And we pick up SHANNON as she approaches BOONE, sitting at 
      the edge of the ocean.  That same mix of contemplation and 
      anger in his eyes.

                                  SHANNON
                    Hey, Superman -- still moping?

      Boone just keeps looking out at the water...

                                  SHANNON
                    Boone?

      And Shannon actually sheds the bitch persona for a moment.  
      Maybe actually displaying GENUINE CONCERN --

                                  SHANNON
                    It s not your fault that...

                                  BOONE
                    Go away, Shannon.

      And when she gets shut down, she snaps back into purely 
      defensive mode.  PISSED --

                                  SHANNON
                    Nice talking to you, jackass.

      And Shannon STALKS off, passing --

      HURLEY.  A little out of breath.  Obviously excited about 
      something.  We PICK HIM UP as he hurries over to --

      KATE AND SAYID.  They look up expectantly --

                                  HURLEY
                    The Chinese people have water.


      CLOSE ON AN EMPTY OCEANIC WATER BOTTLE -- just like the ones 
    we saw in the RED SUITCASE.  PULL BACK to find --

                                  SAYID
                    Where did you get this?

      Kate and Sayid confront SUN outside her makeshift Lean-To.  
      Sayid is amped --

                      SAYIDKATE
      Where.  Did.  You --
                                                  -- She doesn t understand 
                                                  you, Sayid...




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST     "White Rabbit"     (PRODUCTION DRAFT)     8/4/04    37.
      (CONT'D):3737

                                  SAYID
                    She understands me.
                          (back to Sun)
                    Did you steal this water?

      SUN just looks at them nervously, speaks softly in KOREAN (no 
      subtitles here -- not when ENGLISH SPEAKERS are around) --

                                  SUN
                    This is a misunderstanding...

      And that s when JIN arrives.  Head full of steam -- 
      IMMEDIATELY GETS BETWEEN SAYID AND HIS WIFE -- PROTECTIVE --

                                  JIN
                    Get away from her, pig!  If you 
                    touch my wife..

      Kate gets into the fray, ever the peacemaker --

                                  KATE
                    Easy.  Let s just talk about this, 
                    all right?

      Sayid steps back, raises his hands in frustration, stares  *
      daggers at JIN.  Kate holds up the water bottle to Jin.  
      Points to it.

                                  KATE
                    Is this yours?

      Jin stares at her blankly.

                                  KATE
                    Who gave you this?

      And  WHO  is a word that Jin does understand, because his 
      immediate (albeit defiant) reaction is to POINT DOWN THE 
      BEACH.  Kate and Sayid turn to see --

      OFF NEAR THE FUSELAGE3838

      SAWYER.  Smoking a cigarette.

      Completely oblivious to the fact that he s just been picked 
      out of a lineup.

      BACK WITH KATE AND SAYID

                                  KATE
                    Sonofa...




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com  44A-LOST         "White Rabbit"        (BLUE)         8/6/04     38.
      (CONT'D):

      And Kate is set to rip Sawyer s fucking head off, but...

      Sayid grabs her arm.

                                  SAYID
                    I don t see the water.

                                  KATE
                    So?

                                  SAYID
                    You go after him now, he ll give 
                    you nothing.  But if you wait...
                          (beat)
                    A rat will always lead you to its 
                    hole.

      And OFF KATE, knowing he s right but not happy about it.  And 
      as NIGHT finally falls on the BEACH...


      MACRO CLOSE ON A SINGLE DROPLET OF WATER suspended on a 
      BANYAN LEAF.  And as the leaf tips, we watch that DROPLET 
      slide down its surface and into --

      AN OCEANIC BOTTLE.4141

      PULL BACK to find the bottle in the hand of Locke.  It s 
      barely a quarter full, but that s what happens when you do it 
      one drop at a time --

      JACK sits on a rock.  Staring into the jungle.  And we get 
      the feeling that Locke has just been letting him sit, too.  
      Something we should note about these two -- They can talk.  
      Kindred spirits.  Mutual respect.  Finally --

                                  JACK
                    How are they?  The others.

                                  LOCKE
                    They re thirsty.  Hungry.  Waiting *
                    to be rescued.*
                          (then; pointed)
                    And they need someone to tell them 
                    what to do.

      Jack stiffens.  And this is an instinct.  A FEAR.

                                  JACK
                    Me?  I can t --




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST         "White Rabbit"        (BLUE)         8/6/04     39.
      (CONT'D):4141

                                  LOCKE
                    Why can t you?

      That s really the question, isn t it?

      And maybe Jack has never spoken the words aloud before, but 
      when he does, we know he believes them --

                                  JACK
                    Because I m not a leader.

                                  LOCKE
                    And yet they all treat you like 
                    one.  Hm.

      Jack knows he s right.  Hates that he s right.

                                  JACK
                    I don t know how to help them.  *
                    I ll fail, I ll...*
                          (then; quietly)
                    I don t have what it takes.

      And in this moment -- his father s words travelling twenty 
      years to find themselves coming out of his mouth -- we know 
      that despite his own instinctual heroism, Jack BELIEVES this.

      Locke nods.  Twists the cap on the bottle as he settles down 
      across from Jack --

                                  LOCKE
                    Why are you out here, Jack?

                                  JACK
                    I think I m going crazy.

                                  LOCKE
                    You re not going crazy.

                                  JACK
                    No?

                                  LOCKE
                    Crazy people don t know they re 
                    going crazy.  They think they re 
                    getting saner.
                          (smiles; again now)
                    So why are you out here, Jack?

      And something about Locke -- Something HYPNOTIC about the way 
      his eyes dance... makes Jack open up the him --




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST         "White Rabbit"        (BLUE)         8/6/04     40.

                                  JACK
                    I m chasing something.
                          (beat)
                    Someone.

                                  LOCKE
                    Ah.  The White Rabbit.
                          (off Jack s confusion)
                    Alice in Wonderland.

                                  JACK
                    Yeah, Wonderland.  Because who I m 
                    chasing?  He s not here.

                                  LOCKE
                    But you see him.

                                  JACK
                    Yes.  But he s not here.

                                  LOCKE
                    And if I came to you saying the 
                    same thing, what would your 
                      explanation be?  As a doctor?

                                  JACK
                          (diagnosis mode)*
                    I d call it a hallucination.  
                    Result of dehydration.  Post *

                    more than two hours a night for the *
                    last week.  All of the above. *

                                  LOCKE
                    All right, then.  You re 
                      hallucinating.
                          (beat)
                    But what if you re not?

      Jack masks his fear of exactly that with a nervous laugh --

                                  JACK
                    Then we re all in a lot of trouble.

      And now we begin to PUSH IN on Locke.  A man who knows of 
      what he speaks, and what he speaks of is fucking SCARY --

                                  LOCKE
                    I m an ordinary man, Jack.  Meat *

                    That s impossible.*

                                  LOCKE
                    Even if it is, let s say it s not.

      And Jack is practically in a trance... because part of him 
      believes exactly THAT.  Softly --

                                  JACK
                    Then what happens if I catch him?

                                  LOCKE
                    I don t know -- But, I ve looked 
                    into the eye of this island.  And 
                    what I saw?
                          (beat)
                    It was beautiful.

      And with that, Locke stands up.  Runs his hands down his 
      legs, maybe to get the dirt off -- or maybe just because he 
      likes to touch them -- and picks up his pack.

                                  JACK
                    Wait -- Where are you --?

                                  LOCKE
                    Someone needs this water back at

                    No.  You need to finish what you 
                    started.

      And hoping Locke might actually have the ANSWER --

                                  JACK
                    Why?

                                  LOCKE
                    Because a leader can t lead until 
                    he know s where he s going.

      And with that, Locke melts back into the jungle.  OFF JACK, 
      looking after him -- a lot to think about...*


      And SOMEONE ELSE is moving briskly through the late day.  
      Crossing the SAND of the beach this person slips into...

      THE TREE LINE --4343

      And a PATCH OF DENSE FOLIAGE.  A HAND reaches in, pushes the 
      LEAVES aside to reveal --

      THREE SUITCASES.  The hider of this STASH is of course -- *

      SAWYER.  And we re close on him as he POPS OPEN one of the 
      suitcases revealing an array of goodies - SUNTAN LOTION, BUG 
      SPRAY, CANDY, CIGARETTES, LIGHTERS, MEDICINE, ALCOHOL...

      And as he reaches for a pack of the SMOKES...

      The CRACK of a twig behind him!  SPINS AROUND in time to see -

      KATE RUSHING HIM.4444

      It s a flat-out fucking TACKLE and this girl really fucking 
      knows what she s doing because in a matter of seconds --

      She s PINNED Sawyer -- her KNEES pressing hard into his 
      shoulders -- a provocative position under any other set of 
      circumstances.  As soon as Sawyer recognizes his attacker --

                                  SAWYER
                    It s about time.

                                  SAWYER
                    I made this birthday wish four 
                    years ago.

      Kate s eyes BURN as SAYID emerges from the jungle --

                    Does he have it?

      What?  You two follow me out 
      here?  I wanna see a warrant!-- Where s the water, you--

      And Sawyer suddenly PUSHES UP, TWISTS -- ROLLS OVER -- and 
      now he s pinning Kate down -- He GRINS, out of breath --

                                  SAWYER

                    -- Get off me...

      But Sayid is already there, PULLS Sawyer up, PUSHES him -- 
      Fed up with the cutesy bullshit --

                    Touch me again.

      Kate gets up, moves to the SUITCASES.  Pulls them open -- 
      More BOOZE, SMOKES, ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT -- But NO WATER --

                                    SAWYER*

                    And hell, I m an optimist.*

      And there s something about him -- despite the fucking 
      bravado -- that makes it instantly clear that Sawyer is 
      absolutely INNOCENT.  He s telling the truth.

      So they re back to square one.  And still without water.  
      Sayid turns to Kate --

                                  SAYID
                    Come on, let s go.

      Sayid starts back into the jungle as Kate levels Sawyer with 
    a look.  He just SMILES.  Kate shakes her head, goes to 
      follow Sayid when --

                                  SAWYER
                    Hey.  You forgot something.

      Kate turns as Sawyer tosses her a large LEATHER WALLET.  Kate 
      is confused... but FLIPS IT OPEN TO REVEAL --

      IT S THE MARSHAL S BADGE. 

                                  SAWYER
                    Seeing as you re the sheriff now, 
                    might as well make it official.

      Ah.  The IRONY.

      But Kate KEEPS the badge.  Slides it into her pocket as she 
      heads back to the beach.  Sawyer watches her go, pops a smoke 
      into his mouth.  And as the FLAME flicks from his lighter --


      We re deep in a small CAMPFIRE.  PULLING OUT OF IT TO FIND -- *

      JACK.  Alone.  Staring into the fire.  And he s in that zone 
      of non-sleep where he is actually HYPER-AWAKE.

      And there is something about these flames that is familiar to 
      him.  And as Jack looks deeply into them --


      We find that same tear sliding down his cheek back at the 
      CAMPFIRE.  And Jack is snapped out of this quiet repose by --

      THAT SOUND.  Ice cubes in a glass.

      Jack immediately LEAPS TO HIS FEET.  Something moving through 
      the JUNGLE beyond the fire.  Maybe we can just make out the 
      WHITE TENNIS SHOES... 

      And Jack is way beyond rational now as he PULLS A PIECE OF 
      WOOD FROM THE FIRE -- a makeshift TORCH --

      And he moves into the moonlight-dappled jungle -- Almost like 
      he s SLEEPWALKING -- following what just might be a GHOST --

      And he soon comes to a NATURAL STONE ARCHWAY.



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST     "White Rabbit"     (PRODUCTION DRAFT)     8/4/04    47.
      (CONT'D):

      Jack pauses -- a sense of whatever lies beyond -- but it s 
      too fucking late to turn back now -- his journey almost at 
      its inevitable conclusion...

      So he moves through the archway.  AND for the first time we 
      enter our SET...


      We QUIETLY MOVE towards the INFIRMARY TENT -- the sense that 
      this is the POINT OF VIEW of someone as we MOVE THROUGH THE 
      PLASTIC FLAP AND INSIDE TO FIND --


      BOONE takes a full face-plant into the SAND.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Here s your thief.

      We re out on the BEACH.  Charlie (that old DARKNESS in full 
      effect) is surrounded by Michael, Hurley, Sun, Jin, Walt, 
      Sawyer -- a few of the other survivors --

                    Dunno -- but this wanker had three 
                    bottles on him.

                    Why d you do it, Pretty Boy?  Eh?

      surrounded on all sides, scrambles to his feet -- PANICKED -- *

                    in the tent.  And he... Jack just

                    I say we throw him in the jungle 
                    and see what happens.

      SHANNON runs up -- locks eyes with Boone -- No fucking idea 
      what to do...

      Someone needed to take 
        responsibility.  It never -- Oh SHUT IT!

      SLAM!  Boone goes flying into the sand again.*

      And it s out of control.  Six days on the island.  The 
      stress.  The frustration.  The situation.  This is the very 
      worst of human nature because --

      The fucking MOB wants blood.

      Charlie ROUGHLY pulls Boone back up -- Pushes him into what 
      feels like a tightly constricting CIRCLE -- 

      And as Boone looks around at all these angry faces... these 
      people who might just TEAR HIM LIMB FROM LIMB --

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                    LEAVE HIM ALONE.

      And everything just STOPS.

      We re ON KATE as she turns towards the sound of that powerful 
      voice.  And thank fucking God...

      IT S JACK.5757

      And he might still be unshaven.  He might be fucking 
      exhausted.  But there is a LIGHT in his eyes now.

      The same light in his eyes when he got his ass kicked on the 
      playground twenty years ago.

      And they re ALL just staring at him.

      He starts quietly at first --

                    It s been six days and we re all 
                    still waiting.  Still waiting for

                          (beat)
                    But what if they don t?

      Jack steps forward -- engaging each person one at a time as 
      he speaks.  Powerful.  Charismatic.  FEARLESS...

                                  JACK
                    We have to stop waiting.  We need 
                    to start figuring things out.  A 
                    woman died this morning because she 
                    went for a morning swim.
                          (points to Boone)
                    He tried to save her life and now 
                    you re about to crucify him because 
                    he took some water?

      Charlie drops his eyes --

                                  JACK
                    We can t do this.  We can t just *
                    hope it ll figure itself out.  It s *
                    time to start organizing.  We need 
                    to figure out how we re going to 
                    survive.  I found water -- fresh 
                    water in the valley.  I ll take a 
                    group in at first light.  You don t 
                    want to come?  Then you find 
                    another way to contribute because 
                     every man for himself  isn t gonna 
                    work anymore, people.  Last week, 
                    most of us were strangers.  But now 
                    we re all here.  And God knows how

                    If we can t live together, we re 
                    gonna die alone.*

      And as we see them -- ALL of them -- just looking at Jack.  
      Looking UP to him.  And yeah, there s gonna be some bumps 
      along the way, but it s pretty fucking clear --

      We ve just witnessed the birth of a LEADER.

      And once again, CALM has come to the beach.

      CHARLIE & HURLEY

      Walk amongst the castaways with the RED SUITCASE -- doling 
      out HALF-CUPS of water to the SURVIVORS as we FIND --

      SUN & JIN5959

      Sun looks at her husband as he builds them a SMALL FIRE.

                                  SUN
                    Thank you.
                          (beat)
                    For getting me water today.

      Jin pauses for a moment.  Looks at his wife.  Then, as simple 
      as it is touching --

                                  JIN
                    That s what husbands do.

      And now, we FLOAT OVER to --

      MICHAEL & WALT6060

      Michael watches his son sleeping.  Has his half-cup of water, 
      but his kid s fine.  Not worth waking him up for.

      So instead, he gives his water to VINCENT.

      As the dog laps it up appreciatively, we FIND --

      BOONE6161

      Sits away from the camp, ALONE.  Spared a beating, but a 
      pariah nonetheless.

                                  SAWYER (O.S.)
                    How s it feel?

      Boone looks up to see Sawyer.

                                  BOONE
                    How s what feel?

                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST     "White Rabbit"     (PRODUCTION DRAFT)     8/4/04    55.
      (CONT'D):6161

      Boone just looks at him.

                                  SAWYER
                    Yeah.  Sucks, don t it?

      And as Sawyer strides off to wherever it is he strides off 
      to, we leave Boone to FIND --

      JACK

      He sits at a small FIRE close to the ocean.  Kate settles 
      down next to him, hands him a cup of WATER --

                                  JACK
                    Thanks.

    A few beats pass as they take in the night ocean together.

                                  KATE
                    Where were you today, Jack?

                                  JACK
                    Just taking care of some things.

      As always, not much has to be said between these two.  In 
      some kind of cosmic way, they just GET each other.

                                  KATE
                    That s all I m gonna get, huh?

    A few more beats pass.  Then --

                                  JACK
                    My father died.  In Sydney.

      Kate reacts -- surprised... but instantly sympathetic.

                                  KATE
                    I m sorry.

      Jack nods.  His eyes watering with the intensity of his day.  
      Watering with the closure he will not get.

                                  JACK
                    Yeah.  I m sorry, too.

      And as the two of them sit there in this moment of quiet 
      simplicity...

                                                                  FADE TO BLACK.
