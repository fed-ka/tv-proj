                                    BECKETT
                    I comfort myself knowing that if 
                    they re publishing cover art, the 
                    book - and our little partnership - 
                    is almost done.

      They reach an apartment door. Beckett nods to a UNIFORM and 
      they enter...


      A room bustling with UNIFORMS and TECHS taking crime scene 
      photos. We get a sense of urgency. Beckett quickly clocks the 
      spilled juice and cereal on the floor. CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY 
      approaches Beckett and Castle.

                                    BECKETT

                                    CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY
                    Because I love pissing off the FBI. 
                    And because you think outside the

      Beckett turns to see the parents, ALFRED and THERESA CANDELA 
      (30s, Hispanic), standing with FBI AGENT WILL SORENSON (30s, 
      attractive, charismatic, and smart as hell). He looks up and 
      sees Beckett. They lock eyes. Castle sees it and immediately 
      can tell (as we can) that there s a history.

      Beckett, Sorenson, and Castle are standing by an opened

                    then probably walked her out the

                                  CASTLE

                                  SORENSON
                    None they could think of. Not that 
                    either of them can think straight 
                    right now.

      Castle looks over at the Candelas, shell-shocked, on the 
      couch. Castle shakes his head.

                    This thing goes south, they ll 
                    never think straight again.

      Sorenson sees a look on Beckett s face and steps closer. A 
      little too close to be professional.

                                  SORENSON

      An FBI TECH, late-20s, female, has phone surveillance equipment 
      laid out on the coffee table. Beckett and Sorenson huddle with 
      Alfred and Theresa around the table, as the recording of the 
      ransom call is played. Castle watches from outside the circle.

                                    THERESA (ON RECORDING)

                    I want to speak to her. I want to 
                    know she s safe.

      There s a CLICK, then a DIAL TONE. The FBI Tech hits  stop.

                          (overwhelmed, to Alfred)
                    Where do we even begin? 

                                    BECKETT
                    Is there someone who can help you? 
                    An accountant, or maybe someone at 
                    your firm?

                                  ALFRED
                    Nina could help.

                                    BECKETT

                    Even if we give them money, how can

                                  SORENSON
                    You have to trust me. And you have 
                    to have hope. You have to imagine 
                    your little girl walking in that 
                    front door, safe and sound. Okay?

      The Candelas nod, assuaged. Castle s impressed with Sorenson. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Sorenson studies a transcript of the ransom call. Castle is 
      nearby.

                    You do this a lot? Kidnappings? I 
                    mean, you seem to know what to say.

                                  SORENSON
                    It s not about what you say. It s 
                    about controlling the situation. 
                      Controlling the emotions.

                                  SORENSON
                    So the situation doesn t spin out 
                    of control. 

      But that s not what Castle meant. 

                                  CASTLE
                    No, I mean, you requested your ex-
                      girlfriend for the task force. That 
                    doesn t seem to indicate control 
                    over your emotions.

      Sorenson stops and looks up at Castle. He doesn t like to be 
      analyzed. 

                                  SORENSON
                      I requested Beckett because she s 
                    the best in the city.

                                  CASTLE
                    Not because you wanted to see her 
                    again?

      Sorenson sizes Castle up. Smiles, but doesn t mean it.

                                  SORENSON
                    How about you, Castle? You ve 
                    written, what, twenty best-sellers? 
                    Why the sudden need to shadow a 
                    real detective?

                                  CASTLE
                    Because the ones on TV seemed oddly 
                    fixated on their sunglasses.

                                  SORENSON
                    So with all the fat, balding 
                      detectives in the NYPD, you just 
                    happen to end up shadowing her. 

                                  CASTLE
                    Maybe it s fate.

      Beckett enters the room. The boys drop it.

                                    BECKETT
                    Candelas have pulled their financials 
                    and the sister s on her way over. 
                    Anything with the transcript?

                                  SORENSON
                    It s clear the ransom demand has 
                      significance.

                    The kidnappers make an issue about 
                    knowing what the Candelas have. 

                                  CASTLE
                    They said it was everything they had.

                                  SORENSON
                    Whoever made the demand knows them 
                    well enough to know exactly what 
                    they re worth. 


      Sorenson, followed by Beckett and Castle, approaches Theresa, 
      who s settled in at the dining table. Financial statements 
      are laid out.

                                    BECKETT
                    How does it look?

                      Detective. Agent Sorenson. This is 
                    my sister, Nina.

      Nina nods. There s a gravity to her.

                                  NINA
                    It s doable. We ll market the 
                    stocks tomorrow morning, and we ll 
                    have to wipe out the retirement 
                    account and both pensions. You ll 
                    have to pay penalties.

                                    THERESA
                    I don t care. Whatever it takes.

                    Most artists I know don t have

                    So he d have something for him and 
                    Angela. Y know... in case.

      Castle s about to ask another question, when Sorenson jumps in. 

                                  SORENSON
                    Mrs. Candela, we think the 
                      specificity of the amount of the 
                    ransom demand suggests the kidnappers 
                    have knowledge of your finances.

      Off her confusion...

                                  CASTLE
                    What he means is, the kidnappers knew 
                    you could come up with the cash.

      Sorenson shoots a look at Beckett:  Why s your monkey talking? 

                                    BECKETT
                    Is there anyone who might have a 
                    grudge against you? Or anyone close 
                    to you who may need money right now?

      Searching her mind.

                                    THERESA
                    No one who d do something like this.

      They turn. Alfred s in the hallway, holding his brush.

                    What about those messages he left

                    I know what happened, Alfred!

      The stress is clearly getting to Theresa. Alfred backs off.

                                  SORENSON
                    Mrs. Candela, I know how hard this 
                    is. It s understandable to get 
                      frustrated. But, please, we need to 
                    know everything.

                                    THERESA
                    Of course. Ellers ran an asset 
                      management group. They weren t 
                      performing, so we let him go.

                    You mean you fired him.

                                  SORENSON
                    Did he ever threaten you?

                                    THERESA
                    He blamed me for his divorce. He 
                    said his wife left him because he 
                    got fired, and...

      Theresa stops, suddenly concerned.

      sitting at his desk, her feet up like she owns the place.

      He grabs Martha s name plaque off his desk and walks into...


      Castle heads toward the kitchen, Martha following.

                    Richard, you can t expect me to pay

                    What a world. No wonder you re so 
                    surly. Those poor parents, having a

      As he gets to the door, he sees ALEXIS coming down the 
      stairs. He runs up and ambushes her with a hug.

                    That didn t stop me from missing 
                    you. Missing us. Sundays in the

                    needed was a quick glance at a 
                    computer screen to get an address.

      Beckett gives Castle a look: he was right.

                                  BECKETT*
                    Pick her up.

      Beckett and Sorenson, with Lucia Gomez. 

                                  LUCIA
                    I was a junior in high school. What 
                    was I gonna do with a baby? 

                                  SORENSON
                    Two years is still a long time to 
                    think about a decision you made 
                    when you were sixteen. 

                                  LUCIA
                    Look, what am I doing here? What s 
                    this about? 

                                    BECKETT
                    It s about your baby and regretting 
                    your decision. 

                                  LUCIA
                    My decision? I don t regret my 
                    decision. I m in college now. I ll 
                    have kids when I can care for them.

                                  SORENSON
                    Then why did you try to find her?

                    You filed this petition with the 
                    adoption agency a couple months back.

      Beckett pushes the form in front of Lucia.

                                    BECKETT (CONT D)
                    It s a form requesting the identity 
                    of the adoptive parents.

                    No, really. See for yourself.

      She shoves the form and her driver s license to them. Beckett 
      and Sorenson compare the signatures. They re different.

                    Why? What s going on? What s

                    Did anyone in your family object to 
                    you giving up the baby?

                                  LUCIA
                    No one. My mom even helped me.

      But seeing Beckett s badge, Juan takes off running. Sorenson 
      races after him. 


      Juan books down the ramp, Sorenson behind him, with Beckett *

      Juan reaches the bottom and runs right into Castle, Ryan, and

      Juan puts them up and Ryan moves in to cuff him. A beat 
      later, Sorenson comes charging down, out of breath. Castle 
      pats him on the back.

                    that s what you do.


      Esposito and Ryan, wearing latex gloves, inspect the contents

      Sorenson, also gloved, inspects the trunk. Castle stands 
      nearby, watching Beckett interrogating Juan twenty feet away.

      Beckett, Sorenson, and Castle stand together, anxious. *
      Through the door in the bullpen, we see Ryan and Juan seated *
      at Ryan s desk. Esposito pops in from the bullpen.*

                    His motive was the instinct of 
                      fatherhood. If he took her, he 
                    would ve been with her. Not at his

                    Another call. About the ransom.

      It s good news. They hurry out, reenergized...


      A BANK GUARD unloads thick PACKETS OF $100 BILLS onto the 
      dining table. The FBI Tech downloads to Castle, Beckett, and 
      Sorenson. 

                                  FBI TECH
                    They asked for seventy-five packs 
                    of hundreds; randomized serial 
                    numbers and they warned about bait 
                    money, dye packs, and trackers.

                                  CASTLE
                    Sounds like they know your playbook.

      Beckett notices a GREEN BACKPACK on the table.

                                  FBI TECH
                    They were detailed, right down to 
                    the color, make, and model of the 
                    backpack. 

                                    BECKETT
                    Drop instructions?

                                  FBI TECH
                    We wait for their call.

                                  SORENSON
                    All right, let s get the money set 
                    and be ready to move.

      FBI Tech moves off to load the packets of $100 bills into the 
      backpack. But Theresa and Alfred come over.

                                    THERESA
                    It s good they called, right?

                                    BECKETT
                    Very good.

                                  ALFRED
                    But why didn t they tell us where 
                    to bring the money?

                                    BECKETT
                    They re testing you. It s not 
                    unusual.CASTLE Ep. 109  "Little Girl Lost"    Full White Draft    2-4-09      39.



                                  SORENSON
                    Which means, before we make the 
                    drop, we ll need to test them. 
                    We ll need proof that they have 
                    Angela and that she s okay.

      Alfred takes Theresa s hand.

                                  ALFRED
                            (frightened)
                    What if they don t give any? What 
                    if they refuse?

      Theresa pulls her hand away from him.

                                    THERESA
                          (snapping)
                    How can you think like that?

                                  ALFRED
                    I just mean, if-

                                    THERESA
                    You think she s dead?

                                  ALFRED
                    No. Of course not.

                                    THERESA
                      I should ve gotten up. I shouldn t 
                    have let you watch her-

                                  ALFRED
                    Don t say that-

                                    THERESA
                    Don t you tell me what to say! Tell 
                    me, Alfred, was it worth it?

      She points into the art studio off the living room, to the big 
      canvas with the red paint splatter - the one Alfred was working 
      on during the montage. Theresa picks up a vase and hurls it at 
      the painting. It slams against it, knocking it down.

                                    THERESA (CONT D)
                    Was it worth our little girl?

      Beckett crosses to Theresa.

                    Mrs. Candela? Theresa... You can t

      The phone rings. AGENTS and COPS spring into action, pulling 
      on headsets and flipping on monitoring equipment. Theresa 
      pushes toward the phone.

                                  SORENSON*
                          (to Theresa, reassuring)
                    Remember, no proof, no money. We 
                    need to be firm on that. 

      Theresa wipes away her tears and nods.

                    Okay, here we go. 

      Theresa answers the phone.

      A tense silence. Theresa looks over at Sorenson. Beckett and 
      Castle look concerned. Then:

                                  LITTLE GIRL S VOICE (SPEAKER)
                    Mama.

                    You have one hour. 

      The call ends. It s emotional. FBI Tech shakes her head.


      Castle, Beckett, and Sorenson. There s a sense of urgency. 
      Sorenson studies a map on the kitchen counter.

                                    BECKETT
                          (checking her watch)
                    We re north of twenty-four hours 
                    and she s still alive. 

                                  SORENSON
                    Doesn t guarantee a safe return.

                                  CASTLE
                    Even if you give  em the money?

                                  SORENSON
                    Once they get paid, there s no 
                    incentive to keep her alive. Which 
                    means, I ll make the drop.

                    No. They said no cops. 

      The three turn to see Alfred there, having overheard.

                                  SORENSON
                    It s okay. I ve done this before. 
                    They won t know I m an FBI agent.

                                    BECKETT
                    Mr. Candela, we need this to go as 
                    smoothly as possible.

                                  ALFRED
                    She s my daughter and we re going 
                    to follow their instructions to the 
                    letter. They said no cops.
                          (off them)
                    Look, I m her father and I can do 
                    this. Do I make myself clear? 

      Alfred turns and leaves. 

                                  SORENSON
                    No way we can send the father. Too 
                    many things could go wrong. He s 
                    too emotional.

                                    BECKETT
                    What other choice do we have?

                                  CASTLE
                    I m not a cop. And I m certainly 
                    not emotional.

                                  SORENSON
                    No. Absolutely not.

                                  CASTLE
                    The NYPD has a signed waiver from 
                    me. Plus, I don t like saying this, 
                    but you re running out of time. 

                                    BECKETT
                    Castle s right. 

                                  SORENSON
                    You can t be serious.

                                    BECKETT
                    He s followed me on cases. He s 
                    good under pressure. I hate to say 
                    it, but he s our best shot.

      Angela s  big girl  twin bed, with several stuffed animals 
      and a safety rail, is against a wall. Another framed PHOTO of 
      Angela in her bed, holding a stuffed bunny, is on a dresser. 
      FBI Tech works on wiring Castle, as Beckett steps in.

                                    BECKETT
                    Okay, this is where I d ask if 
                    you ve really thought this through, 
                    but then I remembered you never 
                    think things through. 

      FBI Tech threads a wire under Castle s shirt. He cackles.

                                  CASTLE
                    Ooh, cold hands. Cold hands.

      FBI Tech smiles, shakes her head, keeps working.

                                    BECKETT
                    These people are dangerous. You 
                    need to stay focused and alert.

                                  CASTLE

                                  FBI TECH
                    You re good to go.

      FBI Tech exits. Castle looks at Beckett, sees her concern.

                                  CASTLE
                    It s gonna be okay.

                    Not unless you want to.

      Beckett looks at Castle, searches for some insight; quickly 
      realizes none s coming. So, she covers.

                                    BECKETT
                    I just thought for the character,

                    I think I understand Nikki better 
                    than you think I do.

      Beckett shifts gears. She fixes his shirt.

                                    BECKETT
                    Be careful, okay?

                    He s not going to know.

                                  SORENSON
                    You never told him how you stood in 
                    a line for an hour just to get your

                    Is there anything you don t remember?

                    Not when it comes to you.

      As they share a look, Castle gets to the mailbox, crouches 
      down, and reaches under.

                                  CASTLE
                    I feel like Michael finding the gun 
                    taped behind the toilet.

      He rips the phone away from the bottom of the mailbox and 
      pulls the tape off. The phone beeps.

                                  CASTLE (CONT D)
                    Hey. Have Esposito and Ryan hang 
                    back. They just sent a text. It 
                    says,  We re watching you. 

                                  SORENSON
                    It could just be a ruse.

                                  CASTLE
                    Nope. Just got another one. It 
                    says,  You re wearing jeans and a

      It s correct. Castle is wearing jeans and a tan coat.*

                    Okay, so they re watching you. It 
                    doesn t change anything.

      Beckett then gets a text on her phone. She pulls it up:  U

                    Like that ll help.

      Castle reads the next text...

                    and head west on East 47th.*

      Castle walks a few steps, stops.

      Castle heads across the street and gets another text.

      As Castle heads toward the building, behind him we reveal

      Esposito and Ryan push through the crowd, starting to 
      separate from each other.

      They push past people as Asian Male heads outside. *

                    So? 

      Castle picks up the framed photograph of Angela clutching her 
      bunny in bed. He holds it up to Beckett.

                    There are two more pictures of her 
                    holding the bunny out there. So 
                    where s the bunny?

      Now Beckett is fully awake.

                                    BECKETT
                    You think whoever took Angela knew 
                    her well enough to take the bunny, 
                    too.

      Castle taps his nose:  Bingo.

      Beckett and Castle walk out and see Alfred and Theresa at the 
      dining table having coffee. They look up. But Beckett 
      discreetly approaches Sorenson.

                                    BECKETT
                    Theresa s sister, Nina? You got an 
                    address?

      Sorenson pulls it up on his LAPTOP. He turns the laptop 
      slightly for Beckett and Castle to see.

      Theresa and Alfred sit at the dining table. Beckett enters 
      carrying Angela, who is clutching her bunny. Sorenson and 
      Castle follow right behind.

      Beckett sets Angela down as Alfred, overcome, runs to his 
      little girl and scoops her up, giving her hugs and kisses.

                    Thank you. Oh, God, thank you so 
                    much. How did you find her?

      Beckett doesn t answer. Alfred, smiling ear-to-ear, turns to 
      Theresa. Curiously, she s still at the table, stone-faced. Numb.

                    What is it? What s wrong?

      But Theresa remains statue-like. Alfred looks back to 
      Beckett, Sorenson, and Castle, whose serious expressions 
      reveal that something is amiss.
