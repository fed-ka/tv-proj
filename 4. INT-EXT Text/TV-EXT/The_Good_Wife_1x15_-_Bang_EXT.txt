      LANA DELANEY, the pretty and knowing Federal agent from episode 
      107, stands, with a caustic smile, outside her FBI office.

                                  LANA DELANEY
                    This seems like a very one-way 
                      relationship.

      Kalinda smiles.  Lana nods for her two aides to go on ahead.

                                  LANA DELANEY (CONT D)
                    You do know we have a domestic 
                    terrorism problem, don t you?

                                  KALINDA
                    Yeah, and I m sure you re doing 
                    great with that...
                          (Lana laughs)
                    I have two questions for you.

                                  LANA DELANEY
                    Two?  Really?  They re multiplying.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #114     "Bang"     PINK COLLATED     1/15/10       35.

                    The Wagner homicide.  Did you offer 
                    to make Wagner a deal?

                                  LANA DELANEY
                    No idea.  Not one of mine.

                                  KALINDA
                    But you can find out?

                                  LANA DELANEY
                    I can do a lot of things.  I m just 
                    not feeling motivated.  The second?

                                  KALINDA
                    Peter Florrick.

      Lana stops.  Stares at Kalinda.  

                                  LANA DELANEY
                    No.  You re not getting anything 
                    from me on that.

                                  KALINDA
                    That sounds serious.

                                  LANA DELANEY
                    No, that sounds like a  no comment. 

      Kalinda starts to take out a photo, stops herself...

                                  KALINDA
                    No, you re right.  I m not getting 
                    anything from you.

                                  LANA DELANEY
                          (knows she s being 
                            manipulated)
                    Okay, what is it?

                                  KALINDA
                    No, Florrick isn t one of yours.  
                    You won t be interested.

                                  LANA DELANEY
                    Come on.  Let s go.

      Kalinda shows her the photo from the Nano: the mysterious 
      photographer.  Lana is immediately impressed.

                                  LANA DELANEY (CONT D)
                    Where dyou get that?

                                  LANA DELANEY
                    Where dyou get that?

                                  KALINDA
                    I think I ll handle this.

      Kalinda starts off.  Lana calls after her...

                                  LANA DELANEY
                    Tonight.  9 pm.  We ll talk.

      Kalinda considers it.  Nods.  And...


    An expensive Highland Park townhouse.  Alicia and Julius Cain 
      stand on the stoop, knock on the door again. 

                                  JULIUS CAIN
                    Get your name out fast. 

      Alicia nods, being used-- but what the hell.  She looks 
      toward the small garden out front.  Weeds.  Unkempt.  Plastic-
      wrapped newspapers not picked up.  The door is whipped open 
    by RACHEL KNOX, 30s, faded trophy wife, English accent, 
      brittle with scandal.  Rolls her eyes--

                                  RACHEL KNOX
                    Not interested--

                                  ALICIA
                    Mrs. Knox, I m Alicia Florrick--

      But-- BAM--she slams the door.  Julius frowns.  

                                  JULIUS CAIN
                    Not fast enough.

                          (yells in)
                    Mrs. Knox, I m Alicia Florrick.  I 
                    just have a few questions. 

      They wait.  Nothing.

                                  JULIUS CAIN
                    Maybe try another name.  

      Alicia rolls her eyes, but-- jiggle.  The sound of the 
      doorknob being turned.  And Julius smiles, nods respectfully 
    to Alicia: still got it. 


      Quiet.  The silence of the country.  A distant mooing.  It s 
      a farm on the edge of a forest.  Idyllic.  And...


      A cheap restaurant on the shore.  Two patio heaters burn 
      orange over Kalinda and Lana Delaney.  Sitting at a table 
      among a lot of empty tables.  No one else wanting to brave 
    the cold.  Paella.  Crab meat.  

                                  KALINDA
                    You know it s cold out?

                    I like the cold.  Part of the program 
                    training.  You get dropped in 
                    freezing water, and tread water for 
                    twenty minutes.

                                  KALINDA
                    Yep.  But this is dinner.

                                  LANA DELANEY
                    I have something I want you to consider.

                                  KALINDA
                    Going inside?

                                  LANA DELANEY
                    The FBI.  You d make a good investigator.

                                  KALINDA
                    You re serious?

                                  LANA DELANEY
                    Yes.

      Kalinda takes a second, as a SHIVERING WAITER comes out, 
      pours them more wine, rushes in again.  After he s gone...

                                  KALINDA
                    Why?

                                  LANA DELANEY
                    I like you.  You re good.  President 
                    Obama has gotten us more money.  The

      Lana smiles.  Reaches across, covers Kalinda s hand with 
      hers.  Kalinda stares down at her hand.  Looks up at Lana.

                                  LANA DELANEY
                    I want you to work under me.  Feed 
                    me random things you... come upon.

                                  KALINDA

                    That, sure.  Other things.

      Lana smiles at Kalinda.  But Kalinda pulls her hand away.

                                  KALINDA
                    No.  Thank you.  I m happy where I am.

      Kalinda pushes her chair away, stands.  Starts away.

                    The murder weapon.  It was sent

                    Bad news.  It s your client s.

      Kalinda slumps, damn, starts away.  Lana takes a second, then 
      feels a chill.
