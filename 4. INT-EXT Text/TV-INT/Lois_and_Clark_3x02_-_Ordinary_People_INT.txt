     Crime." We PULL BACK to find the paper in the hands of 
     PERRY WHITE as he moves through the desks to LOIS LANE, who 
     sits at her desk watching a morning news report with other       (X)
     Reporters.  From the TV SET, a coiffed male NEWSCASTER:

                    ... and Love Fortress International

     SNAP OFF the TV.

                    Just wanted to congratulate you.

     We TRACK PAST several Love Fortress magazine covers,             (X)

                    here.  Quite a colorful article you
                    did on my little operation.  I'd
                    like to make you a proposal.

     We now MOVE PAST several beautiful Women almost wearing
     scant, filmy items, bearing champagne bottles, trays of
     snacks.  The windowless room is richly done in "gentleman's
     club" decor, its every piece of artwork a tribute to
     physical perfection and hedonism.  Several large, handsome
     Bodyguards stand watchfully about.  We come to a TIGHT
     CLOSE-UP of SPENCER SPENCER, in his 30's, all oily charm and
     smoothness, a phone pressed to his ear.

     Spencer:  His entire body is encased in an elaborately 
     carved cabinet featuring the perfect body of a Greek god. 
     Only his head protrudes from the top of the cabinet, and 
     next to his head are several brass levers.

                    with you, we'll see who disgusts 
                    whom!!

     And he violently hits a lever with the side of his head.
     The motorized cabinet WHIRS from view and...

                    Clark asked me to marry him!

                    What?!  Wouldn't you like to try
                    dating first?

                                     LOIS
                    But see, I really love him.

                    Yes!  Yes, there is!  Perry, have 
                    you ever thought someone was 
                    exactly right for you, and then 
                    found out some... thing... you 
                    never knew about them that could 
                    just... wreck it all?

                                     PERRY
                    Yes.  After Alice and I were 
                    married, I found out her right leg 
                    was an inch shorter than her left.

                    shoe.  Made in Portugal.  Anyways, 
                    on our wedding night we stood 
                    before each other, her listing a 
                    bit to the starboard, and her 
                    secret was out.  But it didn't 
                    matter, 'cause I loved her.

                                     LOIS
                    That is so beautiful.

                    You and Clark gotta deal with 
                    whatever it is, and I don't mean at

                    After all these long months.  My 
                    brilliance and your millions have 
                    finally won out.

                    Do you mean to tell me you've 
                    performed the transplant... 
                    successfully?

     Heidi's wheeled in a large graphic covered by two panels, 
     positions it with back to CAMERA.

     Pescado flips the lower panel.

                        (beside himself)
                    And a body.... And a body... like 
                    Sylvester Stallone!  In the first 
                    'Rocky.' Before things got crazy.  
                    God, I'm gonna cry.
                        (as Klavel whips hankie

                    I'm not gonna cry, you moron.
                    Pescado... this surgery will work?
                    For me?

                                     DR. PESCADO
                        (starting out)
                    You have merely to select the body
                    you wish.

     And he slams his head against one of the levers.

                             _ACT TWO_

     FADE IN:


     Lois comes out of the bathroom in hang-out wear, drying her
     hair, preoccupied.  A RAPPING at the window.

                                     LOIS
                        (absently)
                    Who is it?

     Superman enters through the window.

                                     SUPERMAN
                    'Who _is_ it?' Lois who else                      (X)
                    knocks on your third story window?                (X)

     She crosses away, flops in a chair not facing him.

                                     LOIS
                    I ... guess I didn't seem very
                    appreciative today about all that
                    cheese.  But a boyfriend who can
                    turn my every whim into reality
                    takes getting used to.  I mean, my
                    God, what if I said I wanted a
                    perfect pearl from Japan? ...

     WHOOSH.  In the b.g. Superman is gone in a blur of blue,
     unnoticed by Lois, who rambles on.


                                     LOIS (CONT'D)
                    ... I'd never expect it to just
                    appear.

     WHOOSH.  He returns and places a pearl in an oyster on the
     table behind her.

                                     LOIS (CONT'D)
                    Or if I casually expressed a
                    craving for Swiss Chocolate...

     WHOOSH, he's gone.

                                     LOIS (CONT'D)
                    ... You think I'd really expect you
                    to go zipping off to Switzerland...

     WHOOSH, he's back with huge wrapped blocks of chocolate.

                                     LOIS (CONT'D)

                    These are just idle fantasies,
                    not the kind of thing...

     WHOOSH he's back with a pile of clean snow, which he 
     deposits on the table with the other items.

                                     LOIS (CONT'D)

                    ... that's really important between two...
                        (she turns and looks,

                    You've gotta stop _doing_ this!

                    happy.

     She drinks this in for a long beat.  Then:

                                     LOIS
                    Do you know why I gave up my crush
                    on Superman?
                        (he shakes his head)
                    Because I realized he was a 
                    fantasy.  Do you know why I fell in 
                    love with Clark?
                        (another "no")
                    Because he's real.  That's what I
                    want.

                                     SUPERMAN

                                     LOIS
                    He's got problems, insecurities,

                                     LOIS
                    When I say to Clark I like the 
                    scent of tulips from Holland, 
                    that's not your cue to start 
                    taxiing down the runway, it just 
                    means Clark and I would figure out 
                    a way we could put aside the money 
                    to take a vacation... Together.

                    No, Miss Reichstag.  His two best 
                    friends, Lois Lane and Clark Kent 
                    will lure him here.  My man in

                    pushin' 'em to go off to some 
                    remote little spot.  He says this
                    Clark guy is all for it.  Well,
                    gee whiz, I _live_ in a remote 
                    little spot!  And when they think 
                    they're stranded here, their 
                    buddy'll show up, and I _got_ him!
                    Am I smart or what??

     An awkward silence as they all wait in fear.

                    Get him outta here.

     Heidi pushes him into the operating room as CAMERA MOVES to
     reveal Dr. Pescado, in mask and cap, standing amidst an
     array of terrifying machines, tubes, and blinking lights.

                                     PATIENT
                    No.... no... !

     The door swings closed, muffling the shouts. CAMERA MOVES
     to a side ANGLE as Spencer moves to watch the procedure
     (which we can't see) through the glass in the door.  Belzer
     comes up.

                                     BELZER
                    Well, they're not sick, and no sign
                    of Superman anywhere.  Why don't I
                    just go grab those two?

                                     SPENCER SPENCER
                    No.  I don't want Superman even

                    they don't want to be rescued.

     CAMERA MOVES IN on side by side cells in which Lois and 
     Clark have been placed, their hands chained to the wall, 
     over their heads.  Fast and hushed:

                                     LOIS
                    Tell you what.  I'll forego the

                                     CLARK
                    Look, I have to pick my moments for
                    changing into

                                     CLARK
                    Maybe we're being watched.  I don't 
                    have the suit.  Maybe we'd bust

     Belzer and Klavel approach.  Klavel covers Lois with a gun
     as Belzer swiftly opens her cell, frees her hands during:

                                     BELZER
                    Your host requests the honor of

     He surreptitiously snaps the manacles at his wrists without
     lowering his hands.  He peers over the top of his glasses
     and aims a beam of HEAT VISION at the lock.

                                     LOIS (O.S.)
                    I'm gonna have to pass.  I didn't

     It heats and a small puff of smoke issues from inside it.

                                     BELZER (O.S.)
                    Spencer Spencer says it's

     Lois and Clark react to the name and Clark pulls his wrists
     through the manacles.  Belzer spots him, whips a hypodermic
     syringe from his pocket.

                                     BELZER
                    Hold, it Houdini!

     He plunges the needle into Lois' arm.

                    OW!

                    I don't know how you got outta
                    those chains, but this toxin takes
                    just seconds to kill.  The
                    antidote's upstairs.  You so much
                    as blink, she won't get it, and you
                    can say good-bye to your babe.

                                     LOIS
                    Don't call me 'babe.'

     And she passes out.

     A panel in the wall slides up, and Dr. Pescado wheels in a 
     large metal box on a cart.  As Lois and Clark watch 
     fearfully, he opens the box to reveal a GLOWING nugget of
     Kryptonite.

     Belzer drags a struggling Lois into the room, flings her
     into the cell Clark once occupied, locks it, and leaves.
     Lois fearfully clutches the bars as CAMERA RUSHES IN on her.



     Clark, shirtless, is strapped to a surgical table by a
     gowned Dr. Pescado, and a drape pulled up over his chest.
     On a cart, the Kryptonite glows nearby.  WIDEN to find
     Spencer Spencer, several feet away, watching with                (X)
     fascination.  Dr. Pescado positions a suspended tank marked      (X)
     "Liquid Nitrogen" overhead between the two tables.  Attached
     to it are two thick hoses.  Red arrows point to a trap door
     in the tank's bottom marked "Emergency Flush."

     Lois creeps along the slimy stones, freezes, presses herself
     into the shadows as Klavel passes through the far end of the
     hall, pauses, lights a cigarette, moves off down another
     passageway.  Lois moves to where he was, goes the opposite

     She stops, spotting an open doorway, someone's shadow

     around the doorway.

     air.  Heidi, Pescado, and Spencer Spencer are frozen in
     place, completely encased in a glittering block of ice.

                                     CLARK
                    Okay, that'll hold you 'til...                    (X)

101  CORRIDOR OUTSIDE OPERATING ROOM                               101   

     Belzer, joined by Klavel, automatic weapons ready, flings
     open the door.  A blast of mist.  Clark is barely visible as
     he turns to face Belzer.  The mist obscures Clark, but
     Belzer and Klavel FIRE.


102  A CORRIDOR - LOIS                                             102   

     She crouches in a recess in the gloom, hears the GUNFIRE,
     leaves the cart, rushes back toward the operating room.


103  OPERATING ROOM - CLARK                                        103   

     The bullets RICOCHET off Clark and strike the ice block,
     creating a thousand hairline fractures.


104  OUTSIDE OPERATING ROOM - BELZER AND KLAVEL                    104   

     They blink into the mist, which is beginning to clear, and
     step cautiously inside.  Now they stare at the ice block.


105  BLOCK OF ICE                                                  105   

     The block of ice, along with the villains inside, collapses
     into a pile of tiny chips.

106  BELZER AND KLAVEL                                             106   

     They stand staring, stunned.  Clark suddenly appears behind 
     them, grabs their heads, knocks them together, and the thugs 
     go down.  WIDEN as Clark stands surveying the wreckage and 
     Lois arrives.

                                     LOIS
                        (stunned)
                    Oh.  Oh gee.

     Clark moves into the room, looking at the rubble, disturbed.

                                     CLARK
                    I really didn't mean for this to
                    happen...

                                     LOIS
                        (looks around)
                    Where's Spencer Spencer?

                                     CLARK
                        (soberly)
                    He's a broken man.

     Lois recoils, Clark follows her into the corridor.

     As they move up the corridor.

                                     CLARK
                    I'll call someone to pick up those two.

                                     LOIS
                        (exhausted)
                    And then could we please go home?

                                     CLARK
                    You... want to wait for a boat?

                                     LOIS
                        (a little smile)
                    I wanna fly.
                        (she touches his chest)
                    First class.

     And he scoops her up in his arms, grins, we

     Lois, on phone in nightgown and robe, smiles resignedly. on
     the table, her laptop glows, attached to modem.

                                     LOIS
                    The story's on its way to you.
