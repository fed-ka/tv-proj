    The city s century-old seat of power - the Office of the 
      Mayor. Kane exits the elevator and makes his way through the 
      open floor buzzing with the mayhem of city management. On the 
      walls all around hang portraits of the old Bosses - Cermak, 
      Kelly, Kennelly, Daley, Washington. 

      Kitty O Neil walks with Kane, cell phone glued to her ear...                                                                                    11.

                    No dinner. He s out at eight PM. 
                    Sharp... What kind of gifts?

      Spotting them, a JUNIOR AIDE rushes up and hands Kitty a 
      batch of notes. She sifts through them as they continue to 
      walk, lands on one in particular...

                                  KITTY (INTO PHONE) (CONT D) 
                    Yup... ma am, ma am, I ll have to 
                    call you back. 
                          (hangsup, to Kane)
                    Cullen. Called 3 times since we 
                    left. 

                                  KANE
                    Get him. And tell Stone to come in.

      Kane enters his personal office, a sanctuary of calm away 
      from the bustle on the floor. He removes his jacket. His desk 
      phone rings. He hits the speaker button.

                                  KANE (CONT D)
                    Put him through.

      Click.

    The office door opens. IRA STONE (male, 50s) enters quietly, 
      lean and fit, Kane s  grey suit  (senior advisor) is grey in 
      demeanor, greyer in moral outlook.

                                  CULLEN (ON THE PHONE)
                    Hell of a speech.

                                  KANE
                    Thanks.

      Cullen sitting in the back, holds an iPadshowing the 
      Tribune s latest front page - a picture of himself on stage 
    at the rally earlier, arms victoriously aloft.                                                                                     12.


    The headline reads:  CRUSADER OF LIGHT . The sub:  Moral 
      muscle, backbone and unimpeachable integrity .

                    How does it look?

                                  CULLEN
                    Good...

      Cullen tosses the iPadto his Aide. He couldn t be angrier 
      about it. Hates even more having to pretend he s not with 
      Kane.

                                  CULLEN (CONT D)
                    We re going out wide for the next 
                    two weeks. Back in town a couple 
                    days before the primary.

                                  KANE
                    What s the temperature?

                                  CULLEN
                    It s a toxic shit storm. Anywhere 
                    across the fifty where there s a 
                    vote. Two-, sometimes three-, 
                    termers, wily old sons of bitches 
                    with smooth operations, cashed up, 
                    good messaging and plenty of grit 
                    getting their behinds handed to

                    With Walsh s ties to D.C. youjust 
                    run the adds and watch her self 
                    implode trying to explain them.

                                  CULLEN
                    Yeah, Walsh. Walsh, I know how to 
                    take. It s not the main event I m 
                    worried about, it s this primary...

                                  KANE
                    Primary s yours, Mac. You ve got 
                    Cook County, you don t need 
                    anything else.

                                  CULLEN
                    Yes. Of course. Thank you, Tom.                                                                                    13.


      Long beat. Close on Kane... Close on Cullen... neither man 
      speaking, each reading into the silence... then...

                                  CULLEN (CONT D)
                    Well, I guess that s it.

                    If there s anything else I can do.

                                  CULLEN
                    I ll be sure to ask. Thanks again,

      Click, they hang up. In the car, Cullen turns to his Aide...

                                  CULLEN
                    Alright. I need to know exactly how 
                    he s coming after me. When, who, 
                    what, fuck. 

                                  CULLEN S AIDE
                    Is this about O Hare?

                                  CULLEN
                    Don t fucking ask questions. This 
                    isn t some fucking learning moment.

                                  KANE
                    How s the kid looking?

                                  STONE
                    He ll be here in an hour.

                                  KANE
                    Is he ready? 

                                  STONE
                    He s ready. His attacks on Cullen 
                    are gaining some serious balls. 

                                  KANE
                    Anyone putting him up to it?

                                  STONE
                    No. He either really gives a shit 
                    or he s the most ambitious son of a 
                    bitch I ve ever seen.                                                                                     14.

                                  STONE
                    Solid. He s straight. Goes to 
                    church. Family. Kids. Camera loves 
                    him. He s young but the game has 
                    changed, no one cares about that 
                    anymore.

      Kane leans back in his chair. Swivels to look out the window.

                                  KANE
                    Stoney... I need five minutes. 

                                  STONE
                          (rising)
                    Sure.

                                  KANE
                    Can you tell them out there? No 
                    calls.

      Stone exits, leaving Kane alone. He is still, lost in 
      thought. Slowly he turns to face his desk, reaches for his 
      phone, thinks better of it, reaches into his pocket for his 
      cell phone and slowly dials a number...



      A small waiting area packed with the old and young, Black, 
      White and Hispanic, seated and standing. All around, there 
    are signs showing the understood transaction of the set up - 
    the health care is free because God loves you. 

      A simple folding table operates as receiving desk. A phone on 
    it is ringing... A VOLUNTEER seated at the desk ignores it, 
      focused on some form. A young woman appears from behind a set 
    of curtains, leans in next to the VOLUNTEER, finger running 
      down an impossibly long waiting list. Her name is ALICE KANE 
      (female, 30). No fuss, small, simply attired, she seems tired 
    but gives the sense of unending determination...

                                  CLINIC PATIENT
                          (calling out)
                    Sixty two.                                                                                    15.


      Alice looks up...

                                  CLINIC PATIENT (CONT D)
                    We re at sixty two.

                                  ALICE
                          (calling out)
                    Sixty two.

                                  CLINIC PATIENT
                    Yup, let s move it along.

      Alice crosses off the number on the list. The reception desk 
      Volunteer finally answers the ringing phone.

                                  CLINIC VOLUNTEER (INTO PHONE)
                    Clinic... Just a moment...
                          (motioning to the 
                            receiver)
                    Alice...

      Aliceshakes her head: not now.

                                  CLINIC VOLUNTEER (INTO PHONE) (CONT D)
                    Can I take a message?

      Alice pulls the curtain and waits for patient sixty two to 
      step forward. A frail looking old man (black, mid 70s) 
      approaches, helped by a young man (black, early 20s).

                                  YOUNG MAN
                    Can I come in with him?

                                  ALICE
                    Are you family?

                                  YOUNG MAN
                    I m his nephew.

    She nods them in. They walk slowly past rows of curtained 
      cubicles. All full. Medical. Dental. Eyes. Second hand 
      equipment, donations, stacks of generic drugs. Alice holds a 
      clipboard, filling out a questionnaire as they walk...

                                  ALICE
                    What s your name, sir?

                                  OLD MAN
                    Morrison. Edward Morrison.

                                  ALICE
                    Date of birth?                                                                                    16.


                                  OLD MAN
                    Two Five. Oh Five. Three Five.

                                  ALICE
                    Address?

    The old man has trouble talking, wheezing as he draws breath. 
    The younger man, seeing his uncle s discomfort, takes over.

                                  YOUNG MAN
                    He lives in Englewood. Do you need 
                    more than that?

                                  ALICE
                    A zip?

                                  YOUNG MAN
                    60621.

      They reach an empty cubicle. 

                                  ALICE
                    Mr. Morrison just take a seat here. 
                          (tothe Young Man)
                    Medicaid? PCA?CHIP?

                                  YOUNG MAN
                    No.

                                  ALICE
                    What s your name?

                                  YOUNG MAN
                    Darius. D. He has emphysema, he s 
                    been on inhalers but he s started 
                    to feel a lot of pain...

                                  ALICE
                    A doctor will be with you in a 
                    minute.

      DARIUS  cell starts to ring. He reaches into his pocket. 
      Checks the number. Doesn t answer it. It stops. A beat. Alice 
      continues filling out the form. DARIUS  cell rings again...

                                  DARIUS
                    Ma am? Can I take this?

    She looks at him: what do you want me to do?

                                  DARIUS (CONT D)
                    It s private.                                                                                    17.


                                  ALICE
                          (pointing at the equipment 
                          and medication)
                    I can t leave you in here alone.

      DARIUS is momentarily stunned by such a direct insinuation, 
    but he has to take the call. He ducks out, just to the other 
      side of the curtain, answers the phone... 

                                  DARIUS (INTO PHONE)
                    Yeah... I can t right now... Later, 
                    yeah... How much...

    As he talks Alice glances at him through the curtain. His 
      muscular bare arms and neck are covered in tattoos. His 
      jewelry is minimal but if it s real, it s expensive. Suddenly 
    he catches her staring at him. She immediately looks away. 

                                  DARIUS  (INTO PHONE) (CONT D)
                    ... Alright... Later.

    He hangs up. Enters the cubicle. His eyes on her, hers glued 
    to the form, scribbling. There s a long silence. She looks 
    up, connects directly with him again. Hold. 

      A doctor in overalls swishes in, breaking the discomfort...

                                  CLINIC DOCTOR
                    OK. What have we here?

      Alice hands the doctor the form and leaves. On the other side 
    of the curtain, the front desk volunteer intercepts her...

                                  CLINIC VOLUNTEER
                    It was your dad.

                                  ALICE
                    My dad?

                                  CLINIC VOLUNTEER
                    On the phone?

                                  ALICE
                          (beat)
                    What did he say?

                                  CLINIC VOLUNTEER
                    Just to call him.

      Alice is silent. The Volunteer shrugs, hands her the note: 
       Dad. 555-1212 . Close on Alice, staring at it, shaken.                                                                                    18.


    DAY

      A handful of faculty hover expectantly at the entrance. The 
      place is full of kids, seated cross legged in rows on the 
      floor, buzzing with excitement. On the walls hang their art 
    and craft work and a large sign put up specially for this 
      occasion - vivid in its branding it reads: A Scientia School.

                                  MEREDITH (O.S.)
                    ... But through its partnership 
                    with Scientia, Noble Square s 
                    faculty, staff and students have 
                    improved this school to become one 
                    of the most successful in the city. 

      MEREDITH KANE (female, late 40s) enters. She s suited, 
      immaculately groomed, smiling, with a minimal entourage of 
      EXECUTIVES and an AIDE.  Press photographers move in, 
      clicking. A WBBM-TV local crew covers for TV. She shakes 
      faculty hands. A group of kids come up together and proffer 
      various hand made gifts. She crouches down to them.

                                  MEREDITH (CONT D)
                    Did you make this?
                          (a kid nods)
                    For me?
                          (anotherkid nods)
                    Well, thank you.

    She hugs them. They hug back. Cameras click away.

    CUT TO: The main hall. The adults clapping, children 
      excitedly following suit. Meredith at a podium...

                    Grades are up. Attendance is up.

                    Scientia, working with local 
                      government, provided the critical 
                      technology, textbooks, supplies, 
                      maintenance and financial planning  
                    required to help turn this school 
                    around. Today, right at this 
                    moment, Scientia specialists are at 
                    work at schools across Chicago.

                    Scientia CEO, Mike Bosovic, is a 
                    Noble Square alumnus himself, so I 
                    know how saving this particular 
                    school has been of personal 
                    importance to him. 

      CLAPPING. BOSOVIC (male, 60s) humbly nods... 

    CUT TO:A WBBM-TV REPORTER wrapping up to camera. In the 
      background Meredith sits with kids, reading to them...

                                  WBBM-TV REPORTER

                    meetings with Scientia staff, at 
                    their headquarters, later this 
                    afternoon.

                    Ok... lets get some B-Roll.

    SAM MILLER (male, 30s) a Tribune reporter standing next to 
    the TV crew leans in toward them.

                                  MILLER
                    You guys want something with a bit 
                    more bite?

                          (shaking his hand)
                    What do you have in mind?

    CUT TO:P.O.V.of the TV camera, from the back of the hall, 
      capturing the dilapidated and disintegrating back wall and 
      ceiling, clumsily covered by felt drapery and kids  collages.

                    swing it to her...                                                                                    20.


    The camera pans from the dilapidation to Meredith, where she 
      was, at the front of the hall, reading to the kids. 

      SCIENTIA EXECS notice it, murmur to themselves in discomfort. 
      MEREDITH S AIDE quietly approaches her and whispers in her 
      ear. She nods, still smiling at the kids and continues on as 
      though nothing was happening...

      Back of the hall, Miller, the Tribune man, smiles to himself, 
      impressed with her cool. 

    We hear the LOUD BEEPING of a VEHICLE REVERSING...



      Sunk deep in a Lazyboy, a sports Tand shorts clinging 
      tightly to his rotund figure, ALBERTO  MOCO  RUIZ (male, 30s)

      CLOSE ON RUIZ, the receiver to his ear, slowly losing all 
      interest in the TV because of what he hears on the other end 
    of the line... he clicks the remote, turning the TV off...

                    I was born here, South Chicago, in 
                    the Bush. My father worked steel at 
                    E.C.Tin every day of his life. The 
                    only thing he ever expected from me

                    could see the whole thing. Not just 
                    the steps I d taken to where I was, 
                    but every step from there on out as 
                    well. The rest of my life in its

                    So I left, took a job at the 
                    housing authority. I was 
                      overqualified and underpaid, but 
                    everything changed. My worst day 
                    was always better than my best in

                    ran for State Treasurer. And I won. 
                    And every moment has been nothing 
                    but exhilarating since. Because 
                    everything I do, every decision I 
                    make, in a small, practical way, 
                    affects the lives of every citizen

      CENTER - DAY

      Head of neurology, DOCTOR ELLIHARRIS enters her consultation

                      manipulated that friendship to get 
                    here to see you.

      Harris takes a moment. Rests the file on her table - go on.

                                  MILLER (CONT D)
                    I m a reporter, with the Chicago 
                    Tribune. I m doing a story, taking 
                    kind of a deep look... at Tom Kane.

      Miller pauses, gauging her bit by bit. Harris is still. 

                                  MILLER (CONT D)
                    I know he s been to see you. And 
                    given what you... specialize in, it 
                    seems that maybe there s 
                      information here that might be of 
                    serious interest to the public.

      Harris rises, moving swiftly for the door.

                                  MILLER (CONT D)
                    I know you are bound by 
                    confidentiality but -

                                  DOCTOR HARRIS
                    Thank you, Mr. Miller.

      Harris has the door open, waiting for him to leave. It is 
      absolutely clear that she is not going to even entertain 
      speaking another word. Miller stands, makes his way out.

                                  MILLER
                    If you change your mind...                                                                                    30.


      Harris does not speak. The moment Miller s out she closes the 
      door on him. She returns to her desk, collects Miller s file 
    and dumps it in the trash. When she sits again her eyes catch 
      something else on her desk. She collects it. A business card:

      Kane and Stone seated. Kitty enters bringing in Alderman LALO
      MATA (male 50s-60s), political boss of the 30th ward and his 
      guy, HAIME (male 30s).

                                  MATA
                    Mr. Mayor.

      Mata shakes hands with Kane, motions toward Haime...

                    My nephew, Haime. Hope it's OK if 
                    he sits in. Thought he could learn 
                    a bit about the context of things.

                                  KANE
                    Take a seat.

    CUT TO:Kane at his desk. Mata before him. Stone and Haime, 
    on the couch. Kitty, by the door.

                                  MATA
                    It was a mistake. Tom, you know we

                    is. And let me tell you, I knowhis 
                    mother...

      Mata searches for the hint of a break. None is forthcoming. 
    As he goes on, Kane rises, makes his way to the front of his 
      desk and sits on the edge, boring down into him...

                                  MATA (CONT D)

                    Stop.

      Immediate silence. Kane keeps his eyes pinned on Mata.

      Mata s ear is now stretched up beyond recognition. Haime 
      finally stands knocked out if his stupor, ready to do 
      something for his boss. But he stops. Mata s own hand is 
      aloft, struggling to balance against the excruciating pain, 
    but holding Haime back...

      Stone is inscrutable. Kitty carries a perverse animalistic 
      satisfaction at the political mauling going on.

      Outside. Angle on the working floor craning to hear the 
      continued muffled shouting coming from inside Kane s office.

      Suddenly his door slams open, Kane appears, face fuming, and 
      waits in the doorway forcing Mata and Haime to cross so close 
    to him as they leave that they can feel his breath.

    As they hurry away, Kane watches them go, making sure they 
      continue to hear every syllable of his (now hoarse) shouting.

    He turns back into his office slamming the door with such 
      force it bounces off its frame and swings slowly open again. 
      Junior Aide comes rushing in with a bottle. Kane drinks, 
      breaths still hard, but calm.

      Inside the conference room.Lights go up. At a conference

      Beat. The room begins to empty, execs and assistants all 
      clearing out. Meredith nods to her own Aide who also leaves. 
      Bosovic and Meredith are alone. He smiles awkwardly.

                    I know. I apologize. We try, but 
                    sometimes we come across odd forms 
                    of intransigence, particularly from 
                    faculty. I assure you that our goal

    The ghetto. The worst part. Alice Kane drives alone. Her eyes 
      glance searchingly left and right. 

      Approaching a corner she spots a group of young black men 
      hanging out, loudly joking, whiling time away. She thinks she 
      recognizes one of them from behind, she slows right down, 
      pulling up close. These guys aren t doing anything, but given 
      where we are, her nearing them like this is quite bold. She 
      looks at them all from inside her car.                                                                                     36.


      Slowly, they notice her staring and they turn to her, 
      inquisitive at first, but becoming aggressive when she does 
    not respond.  What lady? What do you want?   

      Finally the last to turn is the one she thought she d 
      recognized. When she sees his face she realizes she was 
      mistaken. She takes off, fast. 



      Cameras clicking. The PRESS crammed in, fighting for the best 
      angle on a face to face summit at the long conference table.

                                  MORETTI (O.C.)
                    Mayor Kane and Chief English of the 
                    Potawatomi Nation have had good 
                    talks. They are excited about the 
                      possibility of a major 
                      archeological discovery...

      Kane and his administration on one side. Representatives of 
    the Potawatomi Nation on the other, all stone-faced and 
      dressed in identical Armanisuits. Their leader, CHIEF BILLY 
      ENGLISH, (male 60) is the only one wearing traditional garb, 
    his long grey hair cascading down both shoulders.

                                  MORETTI (O.C.) (CONT D)
                    ... Mayor Kane believes very 
                    strongly that any and all elements 
                    of the find should be housed in a 
                    museum, for safekeeping and proper 
                    preservation...

      RONNIE MORETTI, Kane s press spokesman reads a statement out 
    to the reporters as the cameras click away...

                                  MORETTI (CONT D)
                    We have already had contact with 
                    the Field Museum as well as the 
                    Smithsonian. Mayor Kane prefers a 
                    local museum so people can come to 
                    Chicago to see the treasurers of 
                    our country s past.

                                  KANE
                    And maybe stay in a hotel, buy a 
                    cup of coffee, a commemorative mug.

      Laughter.

                    Does this call the ownership of the

      More laughter in the room. Kane knows exactly how to play to 
    the  no questions , B-rollonly crowd. The Potawatomi smile 
      too. But not Chief English... he waits for it to subside...

                                  CHIEF ENGLISH

      Apparently Chief English also knows how to handle the B-roll
      only crowd. All the cameras have swung onto him, soaking up 
    his gravely solemn gibberish. Silence. He shows his hands...

                                  CHIEF ENGLISH (CONT D)
                    Proud builders.

      English rises. All his men rise with him. Kane stands, 
      reaches across and shakes his hand. Camera clicks go crazy.

                                  MORETTI
                          (ushering the press out)
                    Alright everyone, that s it. Thank 
                    you. Thank you. Thank you...

    CUT TO:Kane, Stone, Kitty and Moretti, sitting in the same 
      conference room. The press and the Potawatomi, gone. 

                                  STONE
                    That guy was two years ahead of me 
                    at Yale Law. Now he s dropping his 
                    pronouns and wearing sacks. 

                                  MORETTI
                    It works.

                                  KANE
                    Find out what that was with his 
                    hands and... builders. If he wants 
                    a contract on O Hare, we ll make 
                    him bid against Mata s guy. Fuck 
                    them both. 

      Kane get s up, walks to the door...                                                                                     38.

                    Something today. 

      Kane s out. Stone and Kitty look at each other. 

                                  KITTY
                    Nurses, cops, firemen?

                                  STONE
                    How about trash?



      Alice Kane, driving. She sees a lone man walking along the 
      road. As she shoots past she checks his face in the rearview 
      mirror. We recognize him - Darius  D , the young man who 
      brought his uncle to the clinic earlier. She pulls over, 
      takes a breath, looks around the street, no one coming, 
      throws the car in reverse and backs up, pulling up next to 
      him. He stops. Carefully, he looks down into the car, slowly 
      recognizes her and approaches. She lowers the window. 

                                  ALICE
                    Hey.

      Darius nods.

                                  ALICE (CONT D)
                    I was just driving here... and I 
                    saw you...

                                  DARIUS
                          (beat)
                    Yeah... Yeah... I walk here...

                                  ALICE
                    How s your uncle?

                                  DARIUS
                    He s alright. 
                          (beat)

                                  DARIUS (CONT'D)
                    They said you organized for the 
                    breathing device.

                                  ALICE
                    He needed it.

                                  DARIUS
                    Thank you.

      There s a long awkward pause.

                                  ALICE
                    Can I give you a lift somewhere?

      Beat. Darius looks at her...

                                  DARIUS
                    You looking for something?

    She looks away, then back at him.

                                  ALICE
                    Yes.

    He looks up and down the street, gets in, and they take off. 



      WIDE ON the city s grand council chamber. ALL FIFTY ALDERMEN 
    at their seats. Kane at the Mayor s dais, presiding.

                                  KANE
                    Chair recognizes Alderman Mata.

      Kane bangs his gavel. Mata rises, leans into his mic...

    Mr. President, if I may, the

                          (taking command)
                    Mr. President, this is outrageous. 
                      I respectfully ask that we debate 
                    the merits of the amendment alone. 
                    We have had neither the opportunity 
                    nor the time...

      Kane does not respond. His silence is seized upon, a shouting 
      match flooding in to fill it. His allies calling for an 
      immediate vote with cries of  Roll Call!  Opponents shouting 
      objections,  Debate the amendment!  

    As he observes, Kane calls over the City Clerk s Assistant 
    and whispers something into his ear.                                                                                     45.


    The Clerk s Assistant takes off, out a side door. Kane s eyes 
      shift to the press boxes overlooking the chamber - one by one 
      they are being emptied by the clerks and start to go dark. 
      From them, Kane looks down to the chamber floor where other 
      clerks are quickly ushering all floor press and nonessentials 
    out and shutting the grand doors. 

      Back on Kane, watching. He is suddenly aware of a faint 
      knocking sound... He looks down, under the dais table... one 
    of his hands is involuntarily shaking, knocking. He reaches 
      with the other, steadies it, looks to his immediate right - 
      RACK TO KITTY, sitting at the back of the dais in her usual 
      place. She's the only person with an angle to have seen it, 
    but her look seems pressed firmly on the chamber floor.

      Placing both hands on the table, Kane rises, leaning over the 
      entire place it seems, and waits. WE STAY ON HIM as the 
      chamber quickly falls to a complete hush. Then...

                                  KANE
                    Hand over the hardware.

    The Aldermen twist, looking up and around the chamber, 
      realizing for the first time that they have been locked in. 
      With outside eyes no longer on them, they all seem to have 
      suffered a sudden collective loss of spine.

                    Laptops, Blackberries, phones, 
                    iPods, all of it... 

      They reach into their jackets, pant pockets, holsters, 
      briefcases, grabbing all their gizmos. Some have multiples, 
      like weapons concealed in all sorts of places. They hand them 
    up the aisles to Clerks waiting with boxes and dump them in.

                                  KANE (CONT D)
                    No word in, no word out. No 
                    Twitter, no Facebook, nothing. 
                          (beat, boring into them)
                    The amendment to the ordinance 
                    stands. Each of you will remain 
                    here until you decide what it is 
                    that you wish to do. I expect a 
                    simple up or down vote. If the 
                    motion loses, I will make every 
                    single vote publicly known. You can 
                    explain your decision to your 
                    constituents on your own.
                          (grabshis gavel)
                    Let the streets run with shit.

      Bang. He walks off the dais and out of the chamber leaving it 
    in utter silence.                                                                                     46.



      Through the wrap around windows of the open floor, we see the 
      city outside bathed in dusk light. Staff is draining away...

                    The drop on Cullen, when it comes, 
                    and your pivot away, we think the 
                    best way the handle it is to go 
                    with a single source. Exclusive. 
                    Anonymous. That way the rest of the 
                    media will devour each other either 
                    trying to out do it or debunk it.

                                  KANE
                    Good. Who?

      Stone places a picture of Sam Miller in front of Kane.

                                  STONE
                    Sam Miller. Tribune. We ve kicked 
                    his tires. No known political 
                      affiliations. Not a beat guy. Not 
                    one of ours either. Did an expos  
                    on City Hall last year. Ruffled 
                    some feathers. 

                                  KANE
                    Remind me.                                                                                    47.


                                  STONE
                    A handful of Aldermen ran their 
                    mouths off to him for a month, 
                    forgetting who he is, and he 
                    printed it all. Stupid shit they 
                    and their assholeaides usually 
                    say. Only surprising if you believe 
                    them to be paragons of intellect in 
                    the first place. But a council 
                    press consultant got canned for it 
                    and Miller got to ride two or three 
                    news cycles on it nationally. Left 
                    him with a reputation for not being 
                    afraid to burn bridges. Truth is, 
                    he doesn t have any, but that's his 
                    brand, so he's perfect for this.

                                  KANE
                    Where are we with the ward 
                    captains?

                                  STONE
                    They ll wait for instructions. For 
                    now they re crunching their numbers 
                    for turnout alone. When we tell 
                    them which way to go, they ll do 
                    their thing. 

                                  KANE
                    Anything else?

      Beat. Stone reaches into his folder...

                                  STONE
                    There's one more thing. These were 
                    taken today...

    He places new pictures on the table. Taken long-lensed 
      through windows, they show Miller meeting with Doctor Harris. 
      Kane betrays nothing. 

                                  STONE (CONT D)
                    He was asking her about you. She 
                    threw him out. 

                                  KANE
                    Who took these?

                                  STONE
                    One of my guys. Like I said, we 
                    were kicking his tires.

                                  KANE
                    How much do you know?                                                                                    48.


                                  STONE
                    All I ve told you.

                                  KANE
                    Keep it to that.

      Stone nods.

                                  STONE
                    And her?

                                  KANE
                    What do you think?

                                  STONE
                    I think a gentle reminder of 
                    certain oaths...

                                  KANE
                          (beat)
                    Remind her.

      Stone begins to collect his things...

                                  KANE (CONT D)
                    I need some medication. Quietly. 

                                  STONE
                    What do you need?

                                  KANE
                    No, I want to do it alone.

      Without skipping a beat, Stone writes a number on a scrap of 
      paper, no name, and passes it to Kane.

                                  STONE
                    He s quiet.


      EVENING

      Kane sits on the couch by himself in the dark. Long beat. 
      Slowly he looks down at his hand, the one that wouldn t stop 
      shaking earlier. It s very still now. He turns it, flexes his 
      grip, releases, watching it as if it were not part of him.

      There is a knock on the door. He does not answer. The door 
      opens throwing in a shard of light. Kitty enters carrying a 
      pressed suit. She hangs it by his desk. When she turns to 
      leave, she catches him sitting in the dark and is startled. 

                                  KITTY
                    I m sorry. I thought there was no 
                    one in here. 
                          (offhis silence)
                    It s your suit. For tonight s 
                    dinner.

                                  KANE
                    Is it just a speech?

                                  KITTY
                    No, I couldn t get them to back 
                    down. They ll be giving you the 
                    Latino Business Association 
                    Chairman's Award.

                                  KANE
                    Can t phone-monkey out there bring 
                    that in for me?

                                  KITTY
                    Yes. He can.

      Beat.                                                                                    50.


                                  KANE
                    You are where you are. I ve always 
                    liked that you re unencumbered with 
                    excuses about it. Don t undermine 
                    yourself with shit like this.

                                  KITTY
                    Yes, sir.

    She makes her way to the door, pauses...

                                  KITTY (CONT D)
                    Sir, I hope you don t mind my 
                    asking, is everything alright?

                                  KANE
                    How long have you been working for 
                    me?

                                  KITTY
                    Eight years.

                                  KANE
                    Eight years.
                          (beat)
                    Don t ask me that again.

    The threat hits just as intended.

                                  KITTY
                    Yes, sir.

                                  KANE
                    Please leave the light off.

      Kitty steps out, pulling the door behind her. Outside, she 
      takes a breath.



      A large, old town house, split between multiple families. 
      Alice follows Darius up the stairs. Graffiti scratching on 
    the walls. Crappy fluorescent lighting. One floor up they 
      reach a door. Darius makes his way in, Alice behind him. 

                                  DARIUS
                    Wait here.

    He disappears into the apartment. A TV blares loudly. She 
      steps in a little. The place is a cramped mess. More people 
      live here than should.                                                                                    51.


      Down a hallway, through a door slightly ajar, she spots some 
    men in a room. She sees some money change hands. One of them 
      catches her looking and closes the door. She backs off, 
      growing anxious.

      Just beyond, she sees other people watching the loud TV. 
      Young and old, men and women. They eye her but say nothing. 
    She recognizes old uncle Edward, the breathing assistance 
      device gripped to his face. She smiles. He nods back. But 
      continues to stare - a piercing, quizzical stare: what are 
    you doing here?

    CUT TO:Darius, re-emerging from the bedroom, making his way 
      down the hallway to the entrance where he left Alice. He 
      finds the spot empty, the apartment door wide open...



      Wide on the breathtaking beaux arts lobby of the Palmer House 
      Hilton. Kane and Meredith make their way across. Kitty 
      follows.

                                  KANE (O.S.)
                    You are the new energy.

    CUT TO:Outside the open doors to the magnificent Empire 
      Room, a sign announces the event: The Latino Business 
      Association Annual Gala Dinner. In honor of his honor the 
      Mayor Thomas Kane. Recipient of the Chairman s Award.

                                  KANE (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    The rest of us are the sediments, 
                    the layers beneath.

    CUT TO: Inside the Empire Room. Kane and Meredith seated at 
    the high table. Dinner is being served - extravagantly 
      presented Chile Relleno, cascades of cream, stuffings of 
      meat. Meredith eyes hers, a grin covering her dread. 

    CUT TO:The CHAIRMAN of the LBAat the podium mic...

                                  CHAIRMAN
                    Our friend. Thomas Kane.

      Ovation in the room. Kane makes his way to the podium, 
      smiles, receives his award, shakes the Chairman s hand...

    CUT TO: Kane, mid-speech...

                                  KANE
                    You re the top soil. The good 
                    stuff. Toiling, striving. It s your 
                    time. Because achievement does not 
                    frighten you... You know, there s 
                    something we say, we talk about 
                    pulling yourself up by your 
                      bootstraps. I think the closest you 
                    guys have to it is... here I go... 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    54.

                    culo.

      Laughter erupts in the room. Claps. We find Alderman Mata at 
      a table with Associates and nephew Haime, heartily clapping. 

                                  KANE (CONT D)
                          (riding the wave)
                    Am I right?

      More laughter. We find Zajac, leaning toward the guy next to 
    him for a translation, already pre-emptingit with a laugh.

                                  KANE (CONT D)
                    He who wants fish, needs to get his 
                    ass wet...

      Explosions of laughter. We find Meredith, her permanent half 
      smile, changeless.

                                  KANE (CONT D)
                    My friends. As long as you get 
                    yours wet, I will get mine wet 
                    right with you.

      They re on their feet. Everyone. Clapping. Laughing.

                                  KANE (CONT D)
                          (holds award aloft)
                    Thank you.

    CUT TO:Kane and Meredith walking through the throngs of 
      tables, shaking hands, exchanging smiles. Gifts are offered, 
      plaques, bottles of mescal, tequila, a man gives Kane a faux 
      Mexican moustache and a huge sombrero. He clips on the 
      moustache, turns to Meredith. She does a  not bad  motion. It 
      brings the house down. 

      Approaching them, we see the head of a man from behind, 
      heavily bandaged around, early-80sMcEnroestyle, his greased 
    up black hair jutting out on top. He holds a gift box, 
      distinctively wrapped. The man moves through the crowd right 
    up to Kane and stops... It's MocoRuiz. 

                                  RUIZ
                    Mr. Mayor...
                          (hands Kane the gift box)
                    When you speak. We listen.

    Big smiles. Kane pulls Ruiz in, posing for the cameras. 
      Clicks away.                                                                                    55.



      Silence. Meredith s look firmly out the window. Kane looks at 
      her. Long beat.

                                  KANE
                    Thanks for doing that.

    The slightest flinch in her eyes betrays her startlementat 
    his overture. But she keeps quiet, looking out.

                                  KANE (CONT D)
                    Maybe I ll stay at the house 
                    tonight.

                                  MEREDITH
                    You do want you want, Tom.

      Beat. Kane gives up.

                                  KANE
                          (to the driver)
                    Frank, you have your Sox cap?

                                  DRIVER
                    Never go without it, sir.

                                  KANE
                    Hand it over, will you.

    The cap comes over. Kane puts it on.

                                  KANE (CONT D)
                    And pull over, please.                                                                                    56.


    The car comes to a stop. Meredith could not be less 
      interested in the reason why. Kane gets out.

                                  KANE (CONT D)
                    I won t need you for the rest of 
                    the night.

                                  DRIVER
                    Yes, sir.

      Kane shuts the door. The car takes off. Kane walks back to 
    the tail car, also pulled over, opens the door...

                                  KANE
                    Fellas, I m going to need this car.

    His two security guys hop out.

                    Give me your jacket.

      Security Man 1 hands it over. Kane puts it on, zips up, gets 
      into the car.

                                  KANE (CONT D)
                    Pick it up later at the house. No 
                    one follows.

      Kane drives off.

    CUT TO:Kane, driving. He reaches for the scrap of paper with 
    the number Stone gave him, dials it on his cell. It s 
      answered.

                                  VOICE (ON THE PHONE)
                    Hello?

                                  KANE
                    I got this number from Ira Stone.

                                  VOICE (ON THE PHONE)
                    Do you know how this works?

                                  KANE
                    No.

                                  VOICE (ON THE PHONE)
                    You tell me what you need I tell 
                    you when and where we meet. Come 
                    alone. Turn off your phone.

                    Not standby, off. Do you have a GPS
                    in your car? 

                                  KANE
                    No.

                                  VOICE (ON THE PHONE)
                    Good. Hold on...
                          (long beat)
                    Alright. Tell me what you need.



    In the stairwell. Zajac, back against the wall. Kitty, one 
    leg up, pinning him back. His suit pants down, hers dangling 
      around her ankle. Her grunts, aggressively loud. He covers 
    her mouth. She stops, removes his hand from her mouth and 
      resumes, grunting up the concrete and metal stairwell.

    CUT TO:They re done. His pants up again. He straightens his 
      hair.

                                  ZAJAC
                    Kitty... what s your real name?

                                  KITTY
                    That is my real name.

    He shrugs. Smiles. 

                                  ZAJAC
                    Wait five minutes.

    Out he goes. She, still panting, continues to adjust her 
      clothes.                                                                                     60.


    We hear church bells ringing, calling the beginning of 
      evening service...


      EVENING

      Continued sound of church bells ringing. Alice holds her cell 
      phone along with the note she got earlier that says  Dad. 555-
      1212  in her hand. She stares at them then places them down 
    on a coffee table and collects a stiff white clerical collar 
    off it, adjusting it to her neck. 



    The main church hall. Alice in full liturgical vestment, at 
    the altar leading service. She holds her arms wide...

                                  ALICE
                    We break this bread to share the 
                    body of Christ.

                                  CONGREGATION
                    We are one in spirit. We are one in 
                    Christ.

    The organ plays an AgnusDei. The congregation file up to 
      receive communion. Alice hands out a wafer to each in turn.

                                  ALICE
                          (repeated)
                    The body of Christ...

      Back of the hall, the church door edges open and Darius 
      enters quietly. He crosses himself, takes a seat in the back 
      most pew. From the altar, Alice s look momentarily finds him, 
    but she does not skip a beat, continues giving communion...



      It's dark. Cold. Quiet. The only light comes from the 
      kitchen. Kane heads for it.

    On the kitchen table he finds a pile of gifts from the Latino 
      Business Association. A note reads:  A selection. Kitty .

      Next to them, a stack of single sheet newspaper front pages. 
      Another note, same handwriting, reads:  Tomorrow s proofs .
    All of them, the Sun-Times, the Tribune..., carry the same 
      story. Kane picks up the Daily Herald - Headline:  ENTER 
      ZAJAC! State treasurer takes on Cullen in the primary .

      Kane reaches into his paper bag, takes out his newly acquired 
      medication, gets himself a glass of water and downs a pill.

    He grabs his cell, finds a number:  Alice. Church . He 
      ponders. Hits dial. It rings...



    The phone rings. No one there to answer it...                                                                                    62.



    The phone in the clinic reception rings... not a soul in the 
      whole place... except...

      Inside a curtained examination cubicle.Alice sits by herself 
      palming the note that says:  Dad. 555-1212 . The phone rings 
      insistently. Finally she rises, steps up to a large disposal 
    can marked:  Hazardous and Medical Material Only .She dumps 
    the little plastic bag of white powdery crystals that Darius 
      gave her, crunches up the note, dumps that too and walks out 
    of the cubicle turning the light off. The phone continues to 
      ring unanswered...



      Kane hangs up. Takes a moment. Suddenly his phone rings. He 
      answers.

                                  KANE
                    Alice?

                                  STONE (ON THE PHONE)
                    It s Stone.

                                  KANE
                          (beat)
                    Yup.

                                  STONE (ON THE PHONE)
                    The ordinance. We re still 4 yeas 
                    shy of a majority.

                                  KANE
                    Who s holding out?

                                  STONE (ON THE PHONE)
                    Ross and his Gang of Six... The 
                    South Side Nine... The entire 
                      GoogooBlock... 

    As stone talks we see the inside of the council chamber.
      ANGLE ON each dissenting faction as he names them. Blood shot 
      eyes, some nodding off in their seats, others trying to get 
    on with paperwork, still others whisper-plotting with their 
      gang leaders...

                    they re sweating it out hoping

                    It s a fun little game of chicken 
                    they re playing in there.

      Back on Kane in his kitchen.Phone to ear...

                                  STONE (ON THE PHONE) (CONT D)
                    All city waste management operators 
                    have already been warned. Starting 
                    in the morning, nothing s getting 
                    picked up. Looks like we ll have a 
                    fight on this one.

                                  KANE
                    So be it. 

                                  STONE
                    Yeah.
                          (beat)
                    You got what you were looking for?

                                  KANE
                    Yes. Thanks. 
                          (beat)
                     Night Stoney.

                                  STONE
                    Boss.

      They hang up. Kane s eyes go back to the pile of gifts from 
    the Latino Biz people. In the middle of them, he spots the 
      distinctively wrapped box he received from MocoRuiz. He 
      unwraps it, lifts the lid and finds, resting centered on a 
    bed of cotton, a pair of severed human ears. MocoRuiz  very 
      own.

    He takes them out, looks at them impassively then heads to 
    the sink. He dumps them down the drain, runs the water and 
      hits the garbage disposal switch. It runs then suddenly 
      sputters, clunks and dies on him. 

    His shoulders drop.

    CUT TO:Second floor. Kane reaches the top of the stairs. To 
    his right, down the hall, he sees a sliver of light under a 
      closed door. He goes to it, waits a beat, then knocks.

                                  MEREDITH (O.S.)
                    Yes.

      Kane opens the door. Meredith is on her bed busily fast-
      reading and annotating a document, paperwork spread all over.

      Kane remains at the threshold. Beat.                                                                                    64.


                                  KANE
                    You re awake.

    She continues her work, does not look up.

                                  MEREDITH
                    Yes.

                                  KANE
                    We need a plumber.
                          (offher silence)
                    Garbage disposal, it s broken.

                                  MEREDITH
                    OK.

                                  KANE
                    I ll get someone from the office to 
                    send someone.
                          (beat, then)
                    Meri...

      Something in the way he said that has her look up at him 
      finally. She puts her document and pen down.

                                  MEREDITH
                    Tom.

    He looks at her for a long beat. Nothing gives in her. 
      Finally...

                                  KANE
                    Good night.

                                  MEREDITH
                    Good night.

    He pulls the door closed on her. Turns and leaving us behind, 
      heads to the other end of the corridor. He opens the door to 
    his bedroom, flicks the light on, hesitates for moment 
      looking back at us, then disappears into the room closing the 
      door.

                                                                          FADE OUT.
