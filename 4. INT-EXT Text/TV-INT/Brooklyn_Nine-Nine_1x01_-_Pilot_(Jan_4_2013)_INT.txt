ACT ONE


A castle-like building on a busy New York street.

TERRY (V.O.)
(quietly)
All right.  Let s get started.


SGT. TERRY JEFFORDS (early 40s, built like an NFL linebacker 
only stronger) stands in front of a roomful of detectives, 
including Jake, Amy, MEGHAN (30s, somehow simultaneously sexy 
and incredibly scary), and CHARLES (30s, looks like he has 
bad allergies).  The detectives continue to chatter.

TERRY
(barely louder)
Quiet.  Come on, guys, I don t want to 
have to raise my voice--

MEGHAN
(super loud)
Shut up!

Everyone shuts up.

TERRY
Thank you, Meghan.  Where do we stand on 
the electronics store robbery from last 
week?

AMY
Thanks to R. Kelly over there, we picked 
up Rock Steady yesterday.

JAKE

Would you like to do the honor?

Annoyed, Amy walks up to the blackboard, which has written on

elderly neighbor.

During her interview, I deduced that she 
had something gross on her chin.  Here is 
a picture of said gross stuff.

CHARLES
I think it was flan.

JAKE
Charles thinks it was flan.  I think it 
was butterscotch pudding.  Anyway, the 
crime techs are there now, we re heading 
back in a few minutes.  First theory: the 
neighbor poisoned him...
(dramatic)
with her pudding!

CHARLES
Flan.

TERRY
I want all four of you on the murder -- 
it s gonna be priority one for new C.O.

AMY
What can you tell us about him?  You 
worked with him before, right?

TERRY
Yeah, years ago.  Captain Morales will be 
here soon, and I m sure he ll introduce 
himself.  

MEGHAN
Screw that, let s gossip about him.  Is 
he nice or a dick?  Sub-question: does he 
have solid abs and a rock hard ass?

support his detectives?

Jake thinks, twisting a ring on his right ring finger.  

JAKE
Morganthau was a food importer.  The perp 
stole a ham, that only a creepy foodie 
weirdo would know is expensive.

CHARLES
 Creepy  seems excessive.

I gotta say, I was skeptical, but it 
really does make a difference.  Also, 
filing stuff is interesting.  Do you go 
chronological?  Alphabetical?  Do you 
just put them on the shelves totally 
randomly so they look organized, but are 
really completely out of order?
