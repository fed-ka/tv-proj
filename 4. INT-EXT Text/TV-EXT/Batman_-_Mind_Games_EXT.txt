            AERIAL PAN over the Dark Deco city. It's immediately obvious
            that crime is rampant, even in this crime-ridden city. From on
            high we see buildings burning, looting, hold-ups ... if this
            isn't a full-scale riot, it's damned close. SFX: POLICE SIRENS,
            DISTANT EXPLOSIONS, GUNFIRE. CONTINUE PAN to find the city's
            richest area: Gotham Heights. Here PAN STOPS on a mansion that
            could rival Wayne Manor in splendor. PUSH IN on the imposing
            edifice.

            ANOTHER ANGLE - MANSION - NIGHT

            In front of the mansion, an N.D. DOORMAN/BUTLER in white gloves
            and tails holds open the door of a stretch limo as a middle-aged
            SOCIETY COUPLE exits the car and ENTERS the mansion.  The front
            door is held open by an N.D. BUTLER. As we FOLLOW the couple to
            the door we hear PARTY WALLA and appropriate SFX: (the CLINKING
            of glasses, the POP of a champagne cork, etc.) DIAL UP PARTY
            WALLA.

                                GUESTS
                          (party walla)


            Bruce, glancing back at the mansion to make certain he hasn't
            been spotted, runs towards the nearby hedges, pulling off his
            tie as he goes, giving the impression he's about to become
            Batman.

            ON HEDGES

            Bruce BURSTS OUT through the other side, running toward the
            road, pulling his jacket off.  He stops as O.S. headlights
            illuminate him.  He waves his jacket over his head as we REFIELD
            TO INCLUDE an approaching police car.


                                                                                                  Page 3 of 36file:///iBook%20HD/Desktop%20Folder/Michael's%20Docs/Website/Divisions/Teleplays/Batman/mindgames.htm GAMES3/10/03 7:43 PMMIND

                                BRUCE
                          (shouts)
                      Hey!  Over here!

            ON BRUCE

            He stands in the middle of the road, forcing the car to SKID to
            a halt, fishtailing sideways, so it stops just inches from him.
            Bruce flinches back.

            ON SQUAD CAR

            The passenger door flies open and an angry HARVEY BULLOCK
            lumbers out.  RENE MONTOYA gets out of the driver's side.

                                BULLOCK
                      Whadda you, nuts, Wayne? You tryin'
                      t'get yerself --

            ON BRUCE

            He points towards the mansion, quite upset.

                                BRUCE
                          (breathless)
                      Inside the mansion!  The Penguin -- a
                      robbery --!

            BACK TO BULLOCK AND MONTOYA

            They look at each other, then Bullock pulls his gun from inside
            his baggy jacket.

                                BULLOCK
                      Let's go, Rene!  You take the back --
                      I'll cover the front!

            ON MONTOYA

            She glances quickly at Bruce as she pulls her piece.

                                MONTOYA
                      For your own safety, Mr. Wayne -- wait
                      here.

            Then she takes off O.S., following Bullock.

            CLOSE ON BRUCE

            He looks relieved.  Then something bothers him; he frowns in
            confusion.

                                                                 CUT TO:


            The Penguin charges through the open doors, dropping the mist-
            spraying umbrella and pulling another one from inside his
            overcoat.  He raises it overhead; propeller blades SPROUT from
            it and begin to WHIR.  He begins to lift off O.S., carrying the
            bag of loot.

                                                                                                  Page 5 of 36file:///iBook%20HD/Desktop%20Folder/Michael's%20Docs/Website/Divisions/Teleplays/Batman/mindgames.htm GAMES3/10/03 7:43 PMMIND

            ANOTHER ANGLE

            Bullock stumbles out onto the balcony, still COUGHING.

                                BULLOCK
                          (coughs)

            He looks up, to see the airborne Penguin crossing the full moon.
            He raises his gun, then realizes the fowl fellow is well out of
            range.  Play his disappointment, then

                                                                WIPE TO:


            As we PUSH IN on the stately old manor, we HEAR:

                                BRUCE (V.O.)
                      It's really bothering me, Dick.


            It's a gray afternoon; dark clouds roll in over the city and
            there's a distant RUMBLE OF THUNDER in the air.  Bruce and Dana
            walk toward us, Dana pulling the collar of her topcoat closer
            about her throat as she glances up at the gathering clouds.
            Bruce also looks up as we slowly PUSH IN on him.

                                DANA
                      Gonna come a big rain, looks like.

                                BRUCE

                                                                                                  Page 9 of 36file:///iBook%20HD/Desktop%20Folder/Michael's%20Docs/Website/Divisions/Teleplays/Batman/mindgames.htm GAMES3/10/03 7:43 PMMIND

                      Don't worry.  We can still make it
                      back to the office before ...

            CLOSE ON BRUCE

            As he looks up at the threatening sky, we hear a sudden CRASH OF
            THUNDER and it starts to RAIN, huge drops SPLATTING on his face.

                                BRUCE
                          (voice trailing off)
                      ... it starts ...

            WIDE ANGLE

            Dana, trying to suppress her laughter, stands at the mouth of an
            alleyway, holding her purse over her head to keep off the rain.

                                DANA
                      We can take a shortcut through this
                      alley.

            CLOSE ON BRUCE

            Eyes narrowing, expression growing grim.  He's uncomfortable and
            he doesn't know why.  The RAIN is getting worse.

                                BRUCE
                          (uneasy)
                      ... I don't like alleys.

            ANOTHER ANGLE

            As the rain becomes a DOWNPOUR, a smiling Dana grabs Bruce's
            wrist and gently pulls him into the alley after her.

                                DANA
                      Well, I'm not particularly fond of
                      drowning either.  Come on!

            LOW ANGLE - BRUCE AND DANA

            They run along the alley, Dana still holding her purse above her
            head to protect herself, Bruce cautiously looking both ways as
            they run as if something may suddenly spring out of the shadows
            to grab him.  Ahead in the alley large crates are stacked along
            the sides, easily high enough for someone to hide behind.

            ANOTHER ANGLE

            TWO BIKER THUGS step out just in front of Bruce and Dana from
            behind the crates.  Dana is frightened, Bruce concerned.  One of
            the thugs holds a length of tire chain, the other a lead pipe.

                                1ST THUG
                      Out for a stroll on a rainy night like
                      this?

                                2ND THUG
                      And in such a bad neighborhood too. 
                      Not a smart idea.


                                                                                                  Page 10 of 36file:///iBook%20HD/Desktop%20Folder/Michael's%20Docs/Website/Divisions/Teleplays/Batman/mindgames.htm GAMES3/10/03 7:43 PMMIND

            FAVOR 1ST THUG

            He moves toward the frightened Dana.

                                1ST THUG
                      Gonna have to ask you for your money,
                      people.

                                2ND THUG
                      It's the economy.  You understand.

                                DANA
                      N-no ... d-don't ...

            FAVOR BRUCE

            Reaching inside his jacket, he pulls out his wallet and holds it
            out to the second thug gingerly.

                                BRUCE
                      Okay, easy ... we don't want anyone
                      hurt here.

            FAVOR 2ND THUG

            He SLAPS the pipe against his palm and grins unpleasantly as he
            moves toward Bruce.

                                2ND THUG
                      Speak for yourself, pal.

            As the Second Thug reaches for the wallet --

            ON BRUCE

            He suddenly delivers a smashing side kick straight INTO CAMERA.
            SFX:  THUD!

                                2ND THUG (O.S.)
                          (grunt of pain)

            ON ALLEY WALL

            The Second Thug sails THROUGH FRAME and SMASHES into the brick
            wall.  He slips to the ground, dazed.

                                2ND THUG
                          (dazed groan)

            ON 1ST THUG

            Furious now, he CHARGES at Bruce, his pipe raised overhead.

                                1ST THUG
                      Big mistake!

            WIDE ANGLE

            The First Thug swings his pipe at Bruce.  Bruce easily grabs the
            pipe, then pivots and uses the other's momentum to help flip the
            thug over his shoulder.  The First Thug SLAMS back first into


                                                                                                  Page 11 of 36file:///iBook%20HD/Desktop%20Folder/Michael's%20Docs/Website/Divisions/Teleplays/Batman/mindgames.htm GAMES3/10/03 7:43 PMMIND

            the opposite wall and slips to the ground in a heap.

                                1ST THUG
                          (dazed groan)

            Dana watches all this in open-mouthed astonishment.

            ON BRUCE

            He stands in the pouring RAIN, fists clenched, the two thugs
            sprawled to either side of him.  He is shaking; not with fear,
            but with rage, as a concerned Dana rushes up to him.

                                DANA
                      Mister Wayne, you okay?

                                BRUCE
                          (tense)
                      I'm fine, Dana.  They never even
                      touched me.

            FAVOR DANA

            She puts a comforting hand on Bruce's arm.

                                DANA
                      They could've done a lot more than
                      just touched you, boss man.
                          (beat)
                      What in the world got into you?

            ON BRUCE

            He looks up, his face grim, his fist still clenched.

                                BRUCE
                      I wish I knew, Dana.  I wish I knew.

            A sudden CRASH OF THUNDER and flash of lightning punctuate his
            words.

                                                               FADE OUT.


                                      END ACT ONE




                                        ACT TWO

            FADE IN:


            Bruce is in shirt and slacks, walking along a Caligari-esque
            corridor, distorted and nightmarish, with all the angles a
            little off.  Confused, Bruce looks around as he walks, uncertain
            where he is.

            ANOTHER ANGLE


                                                                                                  Page 12 of 36file:///iBook%20HD/Desktop%20Folder/Michael's%20Docs/Website/Divisions/Teleplays/Batman/mindgames.htm GAMES3/10/03 7:43 PMMIND

            He rounds a bend in the corridor, to see that it ends in a
            massive bookcase, filled with books as far as we can see in all
            directions:  A huge cliff of literature.

                                BRUCE
                          (surprised gasp)

            ANGLE DOWN ON BRUCE

            Bruce studies the bookcase, running his fingertips along the
            spines of the books as he moves along, reading the titles.

            CLOSER

            As he starts to pull a particular title from the shelf, suddenly
            a familiar black-gloved hand shoots out from between the books,
            KNOCKING several volumes to the floor.  Batman's hand grabs the
            startled Bruce's wrist and pulls him forward.

                                BRUCE
                          (gasp of fear)

            ANOTHER ANGLE

            Bruce struggles to free himself, and another gloved hand shoots
            out and grabs him, then another and another, reaching out from
            behind the bookcase like arms in a Cocteau film.

                                BRUCE
                          (straining)
                      Let -- go ...!

            CLOSER

            As the frightened Bruce is pulled toward the bookcase, books
            fall away, revealing a BLACKNESS beyond in which many pairs of
            slitted eyes glow.

                                BRUCE
                          (cry of fear)
                       --!!Nooo

                                                           SMASH CUT TO:


            The sleek Batmobile ROARS across the chasm and out into the
            night.  As it disappears into the distance:

                                DICK (V.O.)
                      Well, we made it out of the cave alive ...

                                                                WIPE TO:


            The Batmobile ROARS along a lamplit street, still the most
            powerful beast on the road.

                                BRUCE (V.O.)
                      There's another problem we haven't
                      discussed.


            The grappling hook FIRES from the front bumper like it did in
            the cave.  It EMBEDS in the side of the van, causing the
            burglars to leap out of its way, one to either side.

                                BURGLARS
                          (startled cries)

            ON BATMOBILE

            Bruce and Dick, not quite as graceful in their costumes as
            usual, leap out.  Bruce TACKLES the First Burglar, KNOCKING him
            flat.

                                1ST BURGLAR
                          (impact grunt)

            ANOTHER ANGLE

            Dick roundhouse KICKS the Second Burglar.

                                2ND BURGLAR
                          (impact grunt)

            The First Burglar leaps to his feet and grabs Dick from behind,
            SLAMMING him back against the van.

                                DICK
                          (groan of pain)

            Bruce is SLAMMED from behind by the Second Burglar, winding up
            against the van beside Dick.

                                BRUCE
                          (impact grunt)

            ANOTHER ANGLE

            Side by side now, backed against the van, Bruce and Dick stand
            braced as the two burglars brandish their guns.

                                1ST BURGLAR
                      Y'know, you two ain't nearly as tough
                      as we heard you was!

                                2ND BURGLAR
                          (calls)
                      Hey, Boss!  C'mon out -- you oughtta
                      be the one who ices 'em!

            ANGLE INCLUDES SIDE DOOR OF VAN

            Which SLIDES open.  TWO-FACE steps out of the dark interior, a
            gun in either hand.

            ON DICK AND BRUCE

            reacting.

                                                               FADE OUT.

                                                                                                  Page 24 of 36file:///iBook%20HD/Desktop%20Folder/Michael's%20Docs/Website/Divisions/Teleplays/Batman/mindgames.htm GAMES3/10/03 7:43 PMMIND

                                       ACT THREE

            FADE IN:


            Two-Face approaches the costumed Bruce and Dick, guns cocked.

                                TWO-FACE
                      Don't know how you two remembered who
                      you are, but one thing's for sure --

            ON TWO-FACE

            He snarls and raises his guns menacingly.

                                TWO-FACE (CONT'D)
                      You ain't gonna be remembering
                       from now on.
              anything

            ON BRUCE AND DICK - FAVOR DICK

            The two are pressed against the side of the vehicle as Two-
            Face's shadow flows over them.  Suddenly Dick's eyeslits widen --
            he's got an idea.

            ON DICK'S HAND

            He fumbles with his utility belt and two small GAS BALLS drop
            into his gloved hand.

            WIDE ANGLE

            Dick hurls the balls to the ground in front of the burglars and
            Two-Face.  The balls BURST and billowing clouds of gas envelop
            the startled crooks.

                                TWO-FACE, BURGLARS
                          (choking coughs)

            ANOTHER ANGLE

            Dick and Bruce quickly cover their mouths and noses with their
            cloaks as the gas rises about them.  Two-Face and his two
            toadies collapse at their feet.

                                TWO-FACE, BURGLARS
                          (fading groans)

            ON BRUCE AND DICK

            They lower their cloaks as the gas dissipates.  Bruce is
            suitably impressed.

                                BRUCE


                                                                                                  Page 25 of 36file:///iBook%20HD/Desktop%20Folder/Michael's%20Docs/Website/Divisions/Teleplays/Batman/mindgames.htm GAMES3/10/03 7:43 PMMIND

                      How did you know those were gas bombs?

                                DICK
                      I didn't.  I was just hoping they
                      weren't grenades.

                                                                WIPE TO:


            Bruce and Dick finish tying up Two-Face and the burglars as they
            hear approaching POLICE SIRENS.  They look up to see several
            squad cars SQUEAL to a halt near them.

            ON LEAD SQUAD CAR

            Harvey Bullock and COMMISSIONER GORDON get out of the lead car.
            Gordon seems both stunned and thrilled to see our heroes.

                                GORDON
                      Batman!  Robin!  Is it really you?

            WIDER ANGLE

            To take in Bruce and Dick as well, as they stand to greet
            Gordon.

                                BRUCE
                      So it would seem, Commissioner.

                                GORDON
                      But where have you been?  The city's
                      falling apart --

            FAVOR DICK

            He starts to explain.

                                DICK
                      It's a long story, Sir.  We were --

            Bruce steps forward, interrupting a surprised Dick.

                                BRUCE
                          (quickly)
                      Working, ah, undercover.  We'll
                      explain when we can.

            ON BRUCE AND DICK

            They get back into the Batmobile as Gordon and Bullock watch.

                                BRUCE
                      For now, we'd appreciate it if you
                      wouldn't tell anyone we've returned. 
                      We'll make it all clear to you,
                      Commissioner ...


            A nice Brownstone building on a quiet residential street.  There
            is an alley running beside the building, and as we PUSH IN, we
            can just barely make out the Batmobile parked in the alley.
