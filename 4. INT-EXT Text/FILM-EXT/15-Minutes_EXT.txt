Oleg and Emil stare at the bright lights - all the nonstop
action.
Each stands with an old suitcase.
OLEG
(in Russian)
Look.
Times Square.
Just like in the
movies!
EMIL
(in Czech)
Don't speak Russian!
OLEG
(in Russian)
Why?
Why do I always have to speak to
you in Czech?
EMIL
(in Czech)
Because I don't like your ugly language.
I heard enough of it in school!
Now
speak Czech or English.
And don't fool
around anymore.
You almost got us
thrown out!
Emil pulls out an envelope with Milos' address on it.
This
is who they came to see.
Emil hails a CAB.
Oleg is staring
inside a camera store - at himself on a monitor.
A
videocamera's pointed out in the street.
OLEG
Look.
New videocameras.
Color
viewfinder.
Image stabilization.
Solarization.
Night vision.
EMIL
We have no money.
Come on.
Oleg stares at the videocamera - dying to have one like this.
Emil slides into the cab.
CABBIE
Where you wanna go, buddy?
Emil pulls out the post-marked envelope.
Points to the
return address on it and passes it through the slot to the
Cabbie.
EMIL
Here.
Emil looks out the window - no sign of Oleg.
Then, Oleg
hurries out the camera store, gripping something inside his
coat.
He flings both suitcases in the trunk, SLAMS it shut
and jumps in the back seat.
He opens his jacket - pulling
out the VIDEOCAMERA he just stole.
EMIL (CONT'D)
Go!
Oleg smiles sheepishly at Emil.
Eddie's car pulls up.
Eddie, Leon and Hawkins get out.
HAWKINS
So what's unique?
EDDIE
Not what.
Who.
Eddie passes Hawkins a Polaroid - of a woman on a bed -
covered in blood.
EDDIE (CONT'D)
He's from Antigua.
His girlfriend was
taking too long to put her make-up on.
they were late for a party.
Stabbed her
with a beer bottle.
HAWKINS
That's unique.
EDDIE
Yeah.
And he still went to the party.
Leon moves to a LOOKOUT - gives him a twenty.
LOOKOUT
Top floor.
Back room.
EDDIE
Yeah.
I make big cases, they make the
news and I look good.
But the problem
with becoming a star is downtown.
They
shoot at stars.
Now be quiet.
Shhh.
As they reach the doorway - Eddie surprises two crackheads.
Waves them off.
They hurry away.
EDDIE (CONT'D)
I hope this prick doesn't run.
My knees
are killing me.
Stay behind me.
HAWKINS
You're worried for my safety.
I'm
touched.
Eddie flattens against the building - watches Unique descend
the fire escape.
HAWKINS (CONT'D)
Ready?
EDDIE
Keep them out of my way.
HAWKINS
Okay.
You ready?
EDDIE
Yeah, yeah.
Jesus.
Eddie closes in.
HAWKINS
(into his cell phone)
COME ON!
COME ON!
YOU FUCKING GUYS,
LET'S MOVE IT!
Unique is climbing down the fire escape - before he gets to
the bottom, Leon bursts through a door behind him and kicks
the fire escape, sending Unique flying into the alley.
Where
he lands dropping his gun.
Eddie pulls him off the ground as Leon scoops the gun up.
EDDIE
What's your rush?
Going to a party?
UNIQUE
Why you chasin' me, man?
EDDIE
I don't know.
You always come outta
your house that way?
UNIQUE
It's not my house, man.
I don't live
here.
EDDIE
Well, sounds like burglary to me.
Leon cuffs Unique who recognizes Eddie.
UNIQUE
I know you man.
An unmarked van comes tearing into the scene.
Disgorges a
mini-cam team that starts filming but they missed the bust.
HAWKINS
(to Eddie)
Any chance we can do that again?
EDDIE
Again?
I didn't wanna do it the first
time.
The cab is in front of an old five-story brownstone.
Oleg
gets the bags out of the trunk as Emil tucks the envelope
into his jacket, then steps up to the old building.
He looks
back at Oleg - who's VIDEOTAPING him.
EMIL
Turn that off!
Get the bags.
OLEG
Why should I carry your bag?
I am not a
dog.
EMIL
For five years I paid for your
stupidness - you'll carry my bag for the
rest of my life if I say so.
(challenging)
Unless you refuse, Oleg.
Oleg looks at Emil.
Even though Oleg is stronger than Emil,
he fears him.
He picks up both bags.
Emil searches the
occupant list over the buzzers to the apartment building.
EMIL (CONT'D)
There.
5RW.
Emil pushes ten of the buzzers except 5RW.
A BUZZER clicks
and Emil pushes it open.
A face comes from the darkness.
It's an athletically
handsome man, jogging out of a tunnel towards us.
He's in a
tie and jacket in Central Park at NIGHT.
He is JORDAN (JORDY) WARSAW.
A sensitive man of rugged
honesty.
He runs down the hill in a hurry.
A MUGGER steps
in his path.
MUGGER
Got any spare change?
How 'bout a spare
twenty?
JORDY
Look, I don't have time for you, get out
of my way!!
MUGGER
Alright, how 'bout all your fuckin'
money?
The Mugger pulls a knife - and in a whirl of movement, Jordy
grabs his wrist and disarms him in a deadly, professional
manner - hurling him down to the pavement, twisting his arm
behind his back.
With his other hand, Jordy whips out a
BROWNING 9MM from his shoulder holster and places it behind
the mugger's head.
Jordy displays his shield.
JORDY
Okay, you're under arrest!
Now you
happy?
MUGGER
Fire Department?
Firemen don't carry
guns.
JORDY
Oh yeah?
Guess again.
Jordy handcuffs the Mugger and searches the Mugger's coat
pockets - pulling out a handful of driver's licenses and
credit cards.
JORDY (CONT'D)
Nice - how many people you ripped off
tonight?!
Get up!
As Jordy yanks the Mugger to his feet, his BEEPER goes off.
JORDY (CONT'D)
You couldn't listen to me, could you?
Jordy drags the Mugger to a tree.
Cuffs him so his face is
pressed up against the bark.
JORDY (CONT'D)
I'll send a cop back for you.
MUGGER
Hey.
C'mon, you can't leave me like
this.
Some freak'll come by and stab
me!
Jordy jogs off across the park.
MUGGER (CONT'D)
Wait!
Come back!!
FIRE TRUCKS from three battalions.
Radios CRACKLE.
There's
a crowd growing.
Jordy pushes his way through.
The top
floor of the brownstone where Milos and Tamina lived has been
reduced to smoking ruins.
The trees are covered in debris
and soot.
Jordy moves to LOUIE - Battalion Chief.
LOUIE
Lieutenant - take up your line and
relieve Ladder Company 60 on the top
floor.
JORDY
Hey, Louie, were you first due?
LOUIE
Yeah, I radioed you guys right away
'cause you got two roasts on the top
floor but you don't hafta investigate
cause homicide is up there.
JORDY
Homicide?
Who let them up?
I didn't
make it a crime scene yet.
LOUIE
Hey, it's Eddie Flemming.
KORFIN (O.S.)
Yo, Jordy!
BOBBY KORFIN - an overweight arson investigator with a quick
with and good sense of humor - comes over, pulling on a
turnout coat.
KORFIN (CONT'D)
Where you been, man?
We got a
celebrity!
JORDY
I heard.
Who the hell let them up
there?
KORFIN
I don't know, you think Eddie will give
me his autograph?
JORDY
You see anything in the crowd?
Anybody
suspicious?
KORFIN
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
JORDY
Oh yeah, why?
KORFIN
'Cause Eddie woulda locked him up by
now!
As Jordy and Korfin exit the brownstone, a CAMERA CREW is
arriving.
Jumps out.
Korfin and Jordy cross toward Korfin's car.
They open the
trunk.
Take off their muddy boots throwing them in.
KORFIN
You see Eddie's face when I gave him the
timer?
Wish I had a picture of it.
JORDY
He knew all along.
KORFIN
What??
JORDY
That's why he was so quiet.
He was
testing us.
Eddie and Leon exit - Eddie carrying a baggie with a timer
inside.
NICOLETTE KARAS, young and attractive, pushes her
microphone at Eddie.
She's smart, aggressive and respected
by her peers.
NICOLETTE
Detective, does it look like a murder?
EDDIE
We don't know that yet.
It's much too
early.
There's a lot to be done.
NICOLETTE
How many victims are up there?
EDDIE
There are two bodies found at this
point.
NICOLETTE
Can we go up to the crime scene?
EDDIE
You know you can't do that.
C'mon.
NICOLETTE
Is it drug related?
EDDIE
We don't know.
When I have more I'll
let you know.
Nicolette signals for her camera man, MIKE, to zoom in on
Eddie's hand.
She barrels on...
NICOLETTE
Detective...what's that you're holding
in your hand?
Evidence?
Mike pans up to Eddie's face.
Other reporters arrive,
hurling questions which Eddie easily answers.
Cameras flash
as we PAN BACK TO Korfin and Jordy.
Jordy is about to get in
the car as he notices, back behind some construction - DAPHNE
HANDLOVA.
She's still wearing the crumpled summer dress.
She tentatively steps out to signal Jordy.
He only catches a
glimpse of her.
He starts toward her -- knifes through the
crowd - but Daphne is gone.
KORFIN
What?
JORDY
There was a woman - I think she wanted
to talk to us.
She looked scared.
Oh
shit!
Oh no!
Korfin's car SCREECHES to a stop.
Jordy leaps out.
Suddenly, Jordy stops...the Mugger handcuffed to the tree is
now NAKED!
MUGGER
You motherfuckin' bastard!
She stripped
me!
It was a bag lady!
She touched me
all over, it was disgusting.
Jordy unlocks the handcuffs.
JORDY
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.
Korfin delivers a blanket.
Jordy covers him.
JORDY (CONT'D)
You okay?
MUGGER
A dog pissed on me!!
I'm gonna sue you
for this!
You violated my civil rights!
JORDY
Your civil rights?!
You tried to rob
me!
I could arrest you right now!
You're lucky you're walking away from
this.
Now get outta here.
Jordy gives him a push.
The Mugger wraps the blanket around
himself cursing - hurrying away.
Exhausted HOOKERS who have worked all night loiter outside a
sleazy hotel.
CAMERA PANS up to a blinking hotel sign.
Korfin's car pulls up to the station - as a fire engine is
returning.
JORDY
Now that you know him, maybe you can get
extra work in the next movie they make
about him.
KORFIN
Yeah?
JORDY
Maybe you can be his stand-in.
Video POV of the news stand as a hand reaches into frame and
picks up a copy of THE NEW YORK POST.
Eddie's photo is on
the front page - holding the kitchen timer by the wires.
Underneath his picture the caption reads, "DOUBLE HOMICIDE...
FLEMMING'S ON IT."
The videocamera widens out revealing Emil
standing in front of a Times Square news stand, reading the
front page.
The videocamera turns around - until focusing on
Oleg himself.
OLEG
This is second day in America.
First
day was very exciting.
Full of thrills
and chills.
Over there, is co-star of
my new movie, Emil!
He turns the camera around - FILMING EMIL.
EMIL
(to vendor)
Who is he?
VENDOR
New York's finest.
This is his case.
The VENDOR - picks up People.
Stephen Geller is on the
cover.
VENDOR (CONT'D)
This all you want?
EMIL
Do you know how much killer gets for
movie rights?
VENDOR
(People)
In here, says he wants a million.
EMIL
Million?!
The killer gets one million
dollars for a television interview?
VENDOR
Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous
serial killer - half a million for his
interview.
And how much you think
Monica got for writing book about the
President coming on to her?
It pays to
be a killer or a whore in this country.
Look, you want magazine or not?
EMIL
Yes.
Both.
OLEG
And these.
Oleg picks up FILM COMMENT, MOVIELINE and PREMIERE magazine.
Emil pays for everything.
EMIL
(to Oleg)
Get a taxi.
Oleg tucks the magazines in his coat, picks up the suitcases
and hails a taxi.
As Emil collects his change he sees an old
BLIND WOMAN waiting at the crosswalk.
The light's blinking
WALK.
EMIL (CONT'D)
Let me help.
Emil gently takes her arm and crosses her to the other side.
BLIND WOMAN
Thank you, son.
Emil watches her walk on.
Jordy catches up.
Eddie finishes signing the autograph using
the man's back.
EDDIE
I'll let you know what happens.
JORDY
This is ridiculous.
I'm not gonna be in
your way - we can talk the case over.
EDDIE
Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin.
If you win you can come with me.
If you
don't win, you don't come.
JORDY
I'll call it... tails.
Eddie pulls out a coin and hands it to Jordy.
EDDIE
Okay.
I'll call it.
Heads.
Jordy flips the coin and it's heads.
EDDIE (CONT'D)
Heads.
See, you lost twice.
(beat)
Okay.
Get in.
Jordy goes for the passenger side of the car.
Before Jordy
can get in, Eddie starts to pull away.
Jordy stands on the
sidewalk - dejected.
Eddie stops the car again and this time
lets Jordy get in.
WHIP PAN TO:
As Eddie speeds through the street, SIREN BLARING.
As they come out, Eddie notices Daphne clutching something in
her hand.
He reaches for her hand.
Opens it.
It's a
brushed gold necklace.
EDDIE
Did he give you these?
Was he just
here?
Eddie searches the streets.
Notices Oleg and Emil on the far
corner.
Oleg is videotaping him.
Leon and Tommy pull up.
Korfin behind.
They all pop out.
Eddie grabs Leon -
squeezes his arm - quietly.
EDDIE (CONT'D)
The other side of the street.
The guy
with the videocamera.
(back to Jordy)
Don't look - put her in the car.
(to Leon)
Stay this side.
LEON
(back to Tommy)
Stay with her.
They start heading down the curb - trying not to attract the
attention of Oleg and Emil.
A VIDEO CLOSE-UP
of the scene from across the corner.
EMIL
(Czech)
Put the fuckin' camera down!
Let's go!
Emil starts to flee.
What follows next is an incredible foot chase with Eddie,
Jordy, Korfin and Leon running through traffic - chasing
Emil.
Eddie tries to stay in the lead but is running out of
breath.
EDDIE
Split up!
Jordy runs down one side of Madison - Eddie, the other.
Korfin continues down 62nd and Leon covers the other side.
They search for Emil, grabbing people, turning them around,
missing him.
Emil seems to have disappeared.
Leon, gun raised, approaches the cafe.
As he rounds the
corner, Emil darts out, cracking Leon across the face!
Leon
crashes into a table, dropping his gun.
Emil scoops up the
gun and PISTOL-WHIPS Leon.
BEATING the detective to a pulp.
People are running from the scene.
Emil takes Leon's wallet.
He is distracted by LAUGHTER.
Oleg is VIDEOTAPING the scene.
OLEG
Emil, look!
Oleg swivels with the videocamera.
Korfin is running toward
them - pushing through the crowd.
Emil FIRES!
Korfin is
blown backwards.
OLEG (CONT'D)
Perfect!
Cut.
Print!
Eddie arrives.
Bends down to Leon, whose face is red with
blood.
Jordy runs to Korfin, who's laying in the street,
shot in the side.
Jordy cradles his partner.
EDDIE
Are you hit?
LEON
No.
I'm okay.
JORDY
(to Korfin)
Bobby, Bobby!
Where're you hit?!
KORFIN
It hurts.
Aw, Jesus!
JORDY
Lay down.
Stay down, Bobby.
Jordy looks up as Eddie steps into the center of the street.
Cars screech out of the way!
Eddie crouches, taking aim at
Emil, who is almost two blocks away.
It's an impossible
shot, out of range.
But Eddie closes an eye, aims and squeezes off one SHOT.
Two
blocks away, Emil topples.
Korfin and Jordy look at Eddie,
astonished he made the shot.
Emil scrambles to his feet.
Runs.
Eddie holsters his weapon.
Pulls out a handkerchief.
Dabs Leon's wounds.
LEON
He got my gun!
Motherfucker was filming
the whole time!
EDDIE
I know.
Relax.
Take it easy.
Don't
worry, we'll get those fuckers.
DISSOLVE TO:
EMS VEHICLE
Eddie and Jordy watch as Korfin on a stretcher, is loaded in
an EMS VEHICLE and in b.g., an EMS DOCTOR attends to Leon's
bloody face.
Eddie and Jordy turn to go back into the
restaurant, now cleared out - as Nicolette Karas arrives with
her cameraman.
NICOLETTE
Detective - can you tell us what
happened here?
EDDIE
I can't talk right now.
We have some
things to take care of.
Jordy moves off, he doesn't want to get pulled in front of
Nicolette.
Daphne can be seen waiting in the back of the restaurant,
maybe twenty feet away.
Tommy stands next to her.
This is
where Eddie and Jordy are headed.
NICOLETTE
I understand, but I noticed that the
Fire Marshall is here with you.
Is this
somehow related to the fire department?
EDDIE
I really can't give out any information
right now at this point.
NICOLETTE
Okay.
But I do understand that your
partner, Leon Jackson's been injured.
Is that correct?
EDDIE
He was hurt, but not seriously.
He'll
be fine.
NICOLETTE
Do you have the suspect in custody?
EDDIE
Um...now is not a good time, okay.
Detective Jackson's hurt.
He's fine.
I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective
Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
NICOLETTE
(to cameraman)
Alright, cut, cut, cut.
Mike the cameraman cuts the cameraman - lowers it from his
shoulder.
NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
(to Eddie)
Eddie, are you okay?
EDDIE
Yeah.
Now's not a good time.
NICOLETTE
Alright.
EDDIE
Alright?
NICOLETTE
Alright.
EDDIE
Alright.
NICOLETTE
Okay.
Eddie walks into the restaurant.
Throws a look back at her,
then enters.
It's an old brownstone - in poor condition.
Jordy pulls up.
Opens the door for Daphne - takes her by the elbow - steering
her to the door.
He is edgy.
Jumpy.
Looking around.
DAPHNE
Are you alright?
JORDY
I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
DAPHNE
I'm sorry.
He looks at her.
Nods.
They walk up to the stairs as the
front door opens.
A NEIGHBOR exits, shocked.
Jordy pulls
Daphne out of the way.
DAPHNE (CONT'D)
(in Czech to the man)
Hello.
How are you?
Fire engines have arrived.
The street is filled with
gawkers.
Garcia and Korfin pull up just as Jordy runs from
the building - holding the kid in one arm and pulling Daphne
with the other.
Carefully guarding his bandaged hand.
A
fireman grabs the kid.
Another grabs Daphne.
Garcia and
Korfin run to Jordy.
GARCIA
Jordy!
What the hell happened?!
KORFIN
Are you alright, man?
Lemme see the
hand!
JORDY
Where's Daphne?
Daphne?
He spots Daphne on the corner as a familiar voice pushes
through the crowd.
VOICE
Isn't she a beauty?
She's my fire, look
at that loom-up on her!
Jordy turns - it's Max.
The attention pyromaniac who Jordy
threw out of his office.
As a news crew arrives, Max turns
to the cameras.
MAX
I did this!
I did this!
Take my
picture!
I'm Max!
Max Gornick!
Jordy grabs Max - pushes him away.
JORDY
Get outta here!
KORFIN
What the hell happened?
JORDY
They were inside.
They booby trapped
her apartment!
Korfin scans the crowd.
Looking for Emil and Oleg.
In the
b.g., Duffy is SCREAMING.
DUFFY
What the hell are you talking about???
They're gonna do what?
Jordy and Korfin turn.
The Chief has a phone to his ear and
is freaked.
Hawkins' van drives across Times Square.
Jordy's car
following.
We WIDEN OUT... Eddie's murder is being broadcast
on the JUMBOTRON in Times Square.
People stare up - stunned.
As Jordy comes out with a limping Emil, police are arriving.
Tommy, Leon and Murphy run over as Jordy opens the back door
to his car.
Leon grabs Emil.
LEON
I'll take him.
JORDY
No way!
He's mine!
LEON
(holding on to Emil, squeezing
his arm hard)
We're takin' him.
Don't argue!
JORDY
He's my collar!
LEON
Well, he killed my partner!
JORDY
He's yours but I take him in!
I'll
drive him to the precinct, you can have
him but I'm walkin' him in.
Leon realizes Jordy wants to be seen on TV taking Emil into
custody.
LEON
Okay, kid, have your 15-minutes.
I'll
follow you.
Tommy, you ride with him!
Leon stares hatefully into Emil's eyes.
LEON (CONT'D)
You're goin' down, motherfucker, you are
goin' down.
I'll be there with a smile
when they put you down!
Cutler hurries to Emil's side.
CUTLER
Don't say a word.
Don't respond to his
taunting!
(to Leon)
He's represented by counsel.
You want
to speak to someone - you speak to me!
TOMMY
Out of the way, counselor.
Tommy shoves Cutler aside.
CUTLER
Don't you put your hands on me,
Detective.
Jordy pushes Emil in the back seat and slams the door.
Leon
turns to Hawkins, whose cameras are filming everything.
LEON
And you, you'll pay for what you did!
HAWKINS
(low)
This footage will work in your favor.
When the jury sees this - no matter what
Cutler tries, they'll convict him.
Leon looks at him. This man used to be his friend.
LEON
You outta be ashamed.
Ashamed of
yourself.
HAWKINS
If I didn't put it on somebody else
would!
I was his friend!
LEON
Don't give me that fucking shit.
The cameras are rolling.
MURPHY
Don't get into it on TV.
LEON
(yells to other cop cars)
Alright, let's get going!
Leon and the other cops rush to their cars.
Jordy is already
behind the wheel.
As soon as Tommy jumps in the passenger
seat, Jordy takes off.
The cameras film him driving away.
Jordy pulls off on 130th Street.
They are way uptown in the
middle of nowhere.
The car drives down a dark street.
Crumbled, vacant buildings dominate the streets and there are
no people around.
The car slows down.
Tommy watches Jordy, realizes what's
going on.
Jordy stops at a dead end.
Pulls open the back
door, yanks Emil out and starts to drag him up into the
deserted tunnel.
TOMMY
Jordy...??? Listen to me.
You can't do
this.
This isn't the way to do things.
Jordy ignores Tommy, slamming him up against the tunnel wall.
JORDY
Were you a fireman?
That how you knew
how to rig the apartment?
EMIL
My father was.
He gave me many lessons
about fire.
Now it's my friend.
JORDY
Tommy, take a walk.
TOMMY
What are you gonna do?
JORDY
Don't you get it?
He knew he was gonna
get caught!
That's why he videotaped
Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna
get off.
TOMMY
Don't stoop to his level!
Jordy tosses the car keys to Tommy.
JORDY
Take the car.
Get outta here, Tommy.
TOMMY
Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.
JORDY
(erupting)
GET OUTTA HERE NOW!!
GET IN THAT CAR
AND DRIVE AWAY!!!
DO WHAT I SAY OR I'LL
KILL YOU, TOO!!!
Tommy nervously backs up toward Jordy's car.
Climbs behind
the wheel and drives away, leaving Jordy and Emil alone in
the darkness.
Jordy takes out Eddie's pistol.
The one Emil
took from Eddie.
Jordy opens the cylinder - two bullets
left.
Jordy snaps the cylinder shut, tucks Eddie's gun in
Emil's belt.
He drags Emil away from the wall, into the
center of the empty space - unlocks Emil's handcuffs and
throws them aside.
Still holding the gun on Emil, he circles
around to face him.
JORDY (CONT'D)
Get your hands up!
Get your hands up!
Now facing Emil, he sticks his gun in his waistband - the
same place he put Emil's.
JORDY (CONT'D)
You wanna be a real American?
Go for
your gun.
Emil holds his arms out - making it clear he's not going for
the gun.
JORDY (CONT'D)
Pull the gun!
You want to be famous?
Shoot me, you'll get more headlines and
make more money.
Emil watches Jordy...a slow grin spreads across his face.
EMIL
You can't kill me.
You're not a cop.
Just fireman with a gun.
I bet you
never shot anybody in your life.
JORDY
You'll be my first.
Jordy pulls out his 9mm and pushes the barrel right between
Emil's eyes.
EMIL
C'mon.
Pull the trigger.
Do it.
Oh,
look, you're sweating.
You don't have
the balls.
JORDY
Get down on your knees.
Emil gets on his knees and starts to sing in Czech.
SIRENS
fill the air.
Police cars come flying down the street.
JORDY (CONT'D)
Where's your partner?
EMIL
The Sheraton!
On Broadway!
Room 210.
Go get Oleg.
He'll kill you.
Leon runs up.
Tommy's relieved to see Jordy didn't kill
Emil.
LEON
Gimme your gun, Jordy.
We all want him
dead but you can't do it this way.
Emil is still smiling.
Jordy suddenly slams Emil in the
face.
Knocking him to the floor.
He jumps in his car and
speeds away.
Oleg bursts out a door which opens onto Broadway.
He runs
through the crowd - knocking pedestrians aside!
Jordy chases
him, gun in hand!
Oleg runs into the street, darting in and out of traffic,
cars braking to a stop.
One SLAMS into another.
Jordy leaps over a car, closing in on Oleg.
People gawk.
Even in New York, it's odd to see a man being chased in his
underwear.
Oleg runs, knocking people aside.
He's holding
the camera in his hand.
It's on.
JORDY
STOP!
STOP THAT MAN!
A UNIFORMED COP turns as Oleg runs right into him.
Knocking
him down.
Oleg beats him, takes his gun and runs into:
It's weeks later.
Nicolette is looking worn, tired,
frazzled.
She's trying to go through her stand up.
But
she's unraveling.
Not recovered from the loss of Eddie.
NICOLETTE
...and today with his partner who he
blamed for the crimes still at large,
Emil Slovak will appear in court.
His
lawyer will argue that he is mentally
unfit to stand trial.
Eyewitness News
has also learned that later this month,
Jordy Warsaw will himself be appearing
in court.
He will be arraigned on
charges of violating the civil rights
of...Zwangen...Zwagen...
MIKE
Zwangendaba.
NICOLETTE
Goddamn assholes everywhere.
Zwangenbobby..Zwangendaba.
I got it.
I'll do it.
Shit.
Let's start again.
5-4-3-2-1...
She starts over.
Jordy stands in front of the mirror over the dresser.
We see
the TV overturned in the b.g.
His back up gun is on it.
He
stares at it.
Dark thoughts dancing in his head.
Jordy sits in a taxi, wearing sunglasses.
Looking inside the
park where a POLICE BARRICADE surrounds a POLICE TUGBOAT.
Cutler and Emil are arriving - Emil is being transferred to
Rykers Island.
Jordy pulls his .38 out of his ankle holster
and sticks it in his pocket.
CLOSE ON METER
to $42.00.
The TAXI DRIVER looks in the rearview mirror.
TAXI DRIVER
I can't believe this guy got off.
Unbelievable.
Jordy takes out money.
All he's got is fifty bucks and he
crams it into the slot.
JORDY
Whatever's leftover, keep.
Jordy exits the cab.
The anger rising inside his body is
coming to a boiling point.
He walks into the park.
Leon is
sitting on a bench.
Just sitting there.
Also filled with
rage and frustration.
Jordy meets his eyes.
Leon gets up
and walks away.
Disgusted by it all.
Jordy's right hand
grips the gun inside his pocket as he walks on.
HIGH WIDE SHOT
Many policemen are trying to control a swarm of reporters.
All are waiting for Emil.
WE SEE:
HAWKINS
and his camera crew, and, not far from him - frustrated and
frazzled, waits Nicolette.
Still grieving her loss, she
looks over at Hawkins and his crew.
She shoots him a
disgusted look - Hawkins shrugs it off.
He checks his watch -
anxious - looks at his cameraman.
HAWKINS
He said he'd be here.
Pick him up as he
comes through the crowd.
Do you hear
me?
For Chrissakes don't miss this.
THE POLICE VAN PULLS UP
Cutler's car behind it.
Emil - handcuffed - is unloaded from
the van.
Reporters swarm forward - Cutler gets out of his
car, hurrying up, taking his place alongside Emil and the
POLICE ESCORTS.
The swarm follows - firing questions at
Cutler.
He answers the barrage of questions with:
CUTLER
...my client was suffering from a major
illness of schizophrenic nature wherein
during times of intense stress, as a
result of paranoid and psychotic
delusions - there was impairment of his
ability to appreciate wrongfullness...
This is a victory for the mentally ill!
Jordy walks alongside the moving mass.
His eyes focused on
Emil - his hand in his pocket.
We notice in the crowd Max,
the celebrity-crazed pyromaniac.
What's he doing here?
Max's hand is also stuck deeply in his pocket.
A weird gleam
in his eye.
We see Korfin in the group, speaking to other
cops.
Nicolette and her camera crew are vying for their
place in the mass.
She watches Emil with quiet rage.
Cutler
continues:
CUTLER (CONT'D)
...before Emil boards the police boat
and heads for Rykers Island where he
will be checked into the psyche ward, I
want to say one last word to you all...
As you know, Emil was coerced by Oleg
Razgul into committing these murders,
yet Oleg is still out in the street, a
free man, filming gruesome murders... My
client and I hope he is brought to
justice in the near future.
They are through the monuments, approaching the steps when
Jordy passes a distracted Hawkins - who's checking his watch
obsessively.
HAWKINS
Where the hell is he?
Goddamn it?!
Jordy glares at Emil.
Emil looks back at Jordy, gloating.
Smiles.
He won.
He beat the system.
Jordy suddenly erupts.
JORDY
You think this is funny??
What the hell
are you laughing at?
Emil stares down Jordy.
Jordy grips the gun inside the
jacket.
CUTLER
(to a nearby escort)
Officer, keep this man back, he's
assaulted my client on previous
occasions.
A PATROLMAN blocks Jordy from Emil.
JORDY
This is it?
This bastard kills the best
cop this city ever had and we do
nothing?
CUTLER
You may not like it marshal, but that's
the law.
JORDY
And what about the other victims??
What
about their families?
He'll end up in
some country club nuthouse while his
lawyer sells his rights to the movies
and we just stand here and do nothing?
We let this scumbag walk?
Jordy moves past the officer.
Emil breaks away from Cutler.
Gets in Jordy's face.
Laughs quietly.
EMIL
Be careful.
I can kill you.
I'm
insane.
Jordy shoves Emil into Cutler.
A scuffle breaks out as the
cops separate the two - pulling Jordy back as we cut to:
A VIDEO POV
as it approaches Hawkins from behind.
A hand dips into frame
tapping Hawkins on the shoulder.
Hawkins turns - sees who
he's been waiting for.
His face lights up.
HAWKINS
I thought you wouldn't show up.
Where
is it?
Where is the tape?
IT'S OLEG
In disguise - sunglasses and a hat.
Holding his videocamera.
OLEG
It's all in here.
All in here.
MEANWHILE JORDY
has been separated from Cutler and Emil as Hawkins' voice
cuts above the din of the crowd, announcing excitedly:
HAWKINS
Wait a minute, Bruce!
We've got some
interesting evidence, something you
should look at!
Reporters turn as Hawkins speaks.
His crew is taping as he
continues introducing his broadcast:
HAWKINS (CONT'D)
I have exclusive rights to the ORIGINAL
UNCUT videotape shot by Oleg Razgul,
proving Emil Slovak was not insane!
Hard to believe...watch!
Reporters swing their cameras over as Oleg holds his
videocamera up in the air.
OLEG (ON VIDEO)
He knew exactly what he was doing - all
of this was planned!
It's all here in
my movie.
Emil is not insane.
Look.
Look!
Oleg PLAYS his videocamera as lenses focus, we see excerpts
of the moment where Emil explains to Eddie:
EMIL (ON VIDEO)
...so we kill someone famous and if we
are caught, we are sent to mental
hospital...
CUTLER
(points to Oleg)
Officers, there's your killer, do your
duty, arrest him!
The police are attempting to get to Oleg, but a sea of
reporters separate them.
We hear the staccato calls from the
press corps.
Nicolette looks on in amazed outrage.
Jordy
notices and starts moving towards her.
Before the POLICE
CAPTAIN in charge of the detail can react, the rage which
killed Milos, Tamina and Honey wells up inside Emil.
He
yells at Oleg!
EMIL
Traitor!!
OLEG
No.
You are the traitor.
You are
murderer.
I am director.
Action!
Oleg pulls his gun.
Emil pulls Cutler in front of him as:
BANG!
Oleg FIRES!
Cutler is SHOT and goes down.
Hawkins swings
his camera over to Oleg - filming the would-be assassin.
Oleg FIRES off another SHOT - hitting the COURT OFFICER
escorting Emil.
Emil grabs the down officer's gun.
He
swivels - rapid fires at Oleg.
Oleg topples.
People are
screaming.
It's CHAOS.
Emil darts forward - grabbing Nicolette who is closes to him.
He puts his handcuffed arms over her head - points the gun at
her head.
CAPTAIN
Drop the gun!
DON'T SHOOT!
EMIL
I'll kill her!
Back off!
Everyone back
away from me!
We hear Jordy's voice above Emil.
JORDY
Let her go.
Let her fucking go!!
The captain is screaming at all his men.
CAPTAIN
No one shoot!
Lower your weapons!
Do
not fire!
No officer will fire his
weapon unless I say so!
(to Emil)
Let the woman go!
Cops reluctantly lower their weapons.
But Jordy is still
aiming his gun at Emil.
He is the only one who hasn't
lowered his gun.
The captain is yelling at him.
CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
Holster your weapons!
Back away.
That
is an order!
No officers will fire!
Emil is screaming back at the captain as Jordy screams at
Emil.
EMIL
Tell him to put his gun down!
JORDY
Let her go!
Let her go!!
EMIL
If he doesn't lower his gun I'll fucking
kill her.
Jordy doesn't lower his gun.
Emil tries to back away.
The
reporters - who have ducked and covered - are still keeping
their lenses pointed at the scene.
This is great film!
Jordy follows after Emil - his gun raised.
JORDY
Let her go.
NICOLETTE
Shoot!
Shoot him!!
EMIL
Shut up!
Meanwhile, the captain is still yelling:
CAPTAIN
No on shoot!
No one shoot!!
No officer
will follow.
No officer will shoot!
Nicolette is still encouraging Jordy.
NICOLETTE
Shoot!
Shoot!
Shoot him!!
EMIL
Shut up!
Everyone is screaming at once.
It's mass chaos.
The captain
is trying to keep everyone calm.
Cops following along with
their weapons lowered.
All except Jordy - his gun still
pointed at Emil.
Hawkins can't believe what footage he's getting.
He's
pushing his cameraman to the front of the pack.
Trying to
get the best coverage.
EMIL (CONT'D)
I'll surrender!! I'll surrender if he
lowers his gun.
He's pointing at Jordy but he's continuing to back away
towards the police boat.
NICOLETTE
Don't.
Don't let him surrender.
Shoot
him!
Jordy won't take his gun off him.
JORDY
Let her go.
Let her go.
The captain is yelling at Jordy.
CAPTAIN
Lower your weapon.
I told you - lower
your weapon!
Jordy struggles to get a clean shot at Emil.
He can't.
His
heart pounding.
Adrenaline pumping.
He suddenly lowers his
weapon.
Turns away.
The captain visibly relaxes.
Emil
laughs.
Jordy suddenly turns back.
Quickly raises his
weapon.
JORDY SHOOTS
Emil takes a shot in the leg.
Nicolette ducks under the
handcuffs and scurries away.
Emil looks at Jordy - surprised
he shot him.
Jordy FIRES AGAIN.
Emil is hit in the
shoulder.
Jordy marches forward, EMPTYING HIS CLIP in Emil's
chest.
Abdomen.
Head.
Gun fire echoes in the humid air as
Emil stumbles back.
Does a funny dance and drops to the
ground.
Dead.
The captain yells.
CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
I told you not to shoot!
No officers
should shoot.
Jordy quietly answers:
JORDY
I'm not a cop.
I'm a fire marshal.
HAWKINS
He's still alive.
Hawkins looks down at Oleg.
He is sprawled on the ground.
His videocamera in hand - he's still making the movie.
OLEG'S VIDEO POV
as it ZOOMS from the Statue of Liberty and PANS to Oleg.
He
looks in the lens with his dying eyes, gasps:
OLEG
A film...by Oleg Razgul.
And Oleg dies but suddenly his eyes pop WIDE OPEN.
Hawkins
jumps back, Oleg smiles, coughing in pain.
OLEG (CONT'D)
How was that?
Oleg's head rolls to one side.
Now dead.
Nicolette runs
over to Jordy.
Composing herself.
Coming together.
Glad
Emil is dead.
Jordy starts to walk away.
NICOLETTE
Wait a minute.
Where are you going?
Learn from Eddie.
Talk to the court of
public opinion.
Take the credit, you
need it.
She turns him around.
Straightens his tie.
Starts to push
the hair out of his face but he stops her hand.
JORDY
No thanks.
Jordy puts something in her hand.
She looks down.
It's
EDDIE'S BADGE.
The one Jordy took out of Daphne's bathroom.
She looks up at him.
Her cameraman rolling.
The lens
pointed at Jordy.
Jordy looks at Nicolette.
Meets her eyes.
He doesn't want to make a statement.
He still doesn't want
the fame.
He did learn from Eddie.
Eddie was killed because
he was a celebrity.
Jordy wants no part of it.
NICOLETTE
Cut.
Her cameraman lowers his leans.
Jordy smiles.
She nods.
Jordy turns and walks away.
NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
Get a shot of him leaving.
Then pan to
me.
Jordy disappears into the sea of people.
The camera PANS
back to Nicolette.
NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
Well, he wouldn't talk to us, but you
saw it.
The CAMERA PULLS BACK from Nicolette's face and the video is
now on:
THE JUMBOTRON IN TIMES SQUARE
We PULL BACK FURTHER and FURTHER.
Nicolette finishing her
stand up:
NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
New York City has a new hero, Fire
Marshal Jordan Warsaw.
I hope that Fire
Marshal Warsaw's heroic actions this
afternoon will help with his other legal
problems.
WB11 has also learned that
the fire Marshal has retained an
immigration lawyer to help Daphne
Handlova with her case.
We wish her
well.
This is Nicolette Karas, live at
Battery Park, WB11 New York.
Good
night.
