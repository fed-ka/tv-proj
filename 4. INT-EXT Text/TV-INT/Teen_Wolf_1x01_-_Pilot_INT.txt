      TWO HANDS thread the laces on the head of a lacrosse stick. 
      The work is fast and precise, fingers pulling each lace into 
      a diamond mesh pattern. Knotting the last loop, sixteen year-
      old SCOTT McCALL stands with the re-threaded stick.

      Dressed in only a pair of athletic shorts, his lithe frame 
      may still have some filling out to do but it s easy to see 
      that he ll soon grow into a strikingly handsome young man 
      with deep black eyes designed to melt the hearts of hopeful 
      young girls.

      Scooping a ball up from his bedroom floor, he gives the 
      lacrosse stick a spin, testing his handiwork.

      A moment later, the re-threaded stick lands next to a school 
      backpack while--

      Scott pumps out a few chin-ups at the bar mounted in the 
      doorway of his closet.

      Then, toothbrush in his mouth, he reaches for the window sill 
      to pull it down. But he stops when he hears a SOUND. He cocks 
      his ear to listen again. Under the whispering wind, he hears 
      MOVEMENT... A STRANGE SHUFFLING NOISE.                                                                                      2.




      Scott silently slips into the hallway and peers into another 
      bedroom. His mother, MELISSA McCALL, late thirties, both 
      remarkably strong and remarkably beautiful, sleeps over the 
      covers of the bed, fully clothed as if she d just passed out 
      after having walked in. Scott eases her door shut as--


      A SCHOOL BELL RINGS in the crowded hallway. At their lockers, 
      Scott takes off his backpack and pulls his shirt up a few 
      inches to show Stiles the BANDAGE on his lower back.

                                  SCOTT
                    It was too dark to see much but I m 
                    pretty sure it was a wolf.

                                  STILES
                    A wolf bit you? No, not a chance.

                                  SCOTT
                    I heard a wolf howling.

                                  STILES
                    No, you didn t.

                                  SCOTT
                    What do you mean  No, I didn t?  
                    How do you know what I heard?

                                  STILES
                      California doesn t have wolves. Not  
                    for the last sixty years.

                                  SCOTT
                    Really?

                                  STILES
                    Yes, really. There are no wolves in 
                      California.

                                  SCOTT
                    Well, if you don t believe me about 
                    the wolf, then you re definitely 
                    not going to believe me when I tell 
                    you I saw the body.

                                  STILES
                    You what? Are you kidding me?

                                  SCOTT
                    I wish. I m going to have 
                      nightmares about it for a month.                                                                                      9.



                                  STILES
                    That s freaking awesome. This is 
                    seriously the best thing that s 
                    happened to this town since...
                          (looking past Scott)
                    ...since the birth of Lydia Sayers 
                    who s walking toward us right now.

      A drop-dead gorgeous junior named LYDIA SAYERS walks the 
      corridor like it was a fashion show runway in Milan.

                                  STILES (CONT'D)
                    Hey Lydia, how are you? You look--

      She walks right past.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    ...like you re going to ignore me.
                          (at Scott s laugh)
                    You re the cause of this, you know. 
                    Dragging me down to your nerd 
                    depths. I m a nerd by association. 
                    I ve been Scarlet-nerded by you.

      Blending into the crowd, they head into--


      First period English. Scott takes the desk next to Stiles as 
      the teacher, MR. CURTIS walks in.

                                  MR. CURTIS
                    As you all know by now, there was 
                    indeed a body found in the woods 
                    last night. I m sure your eager 
                    little minds are coming up with all 
                    sorts of macabre scenarios as to 
                    how it happened but I ve been told 
                    that the police have a suspect in 
                    custody.

      Scott looks to Stiles who shrugs, news to him as well.

                                  MR. CURTIS (CONT'D)
                    A vagrant with a long history of 
                      psychiatric disorders was 
                      discovered camping out in the woods 
                    near where the body was found. 
                    Which means your undivided 
                    attention can be given to the 
                    syllabus outlining the semester on 
                    your desks. Read it now. And by 
                    read I don t mean skim.                                                                                    10.



      THE SOUND of paper pages flipping RUMBLES toward Scott as 
      students start reading. It s strangely loud, causing his ears 
      to twitch. Especially when--

      A CELL PHONE RINGS.

      He glances up. The other students quietly read the syllabus. 
      Scott appears to be the only one noticing the RINGING. Gazing 
      about, he can t seem to find the source until his eyes fall 
      on the WINDOWS of the classroom...

      OUTSIDE - across the quad, Scott sees ALLISON ARGENT. Sixteen 
      and radiating with an innocent beauty. When she puts a cell 
      phone to her ear, it becomes obvious that, despite the closed 
      windows and the distance, this is the RINGING Scott is 
      somehow able to hear.

      More astonishingly, Scott can hear both Allison and her 
      caller, their VOICES echoing with a tinny effect.

                                    ALLISON
                    Mom, three calls on my first day is 
                    a little overdoing it.

                                  MRS. ARGENT (V.O.)
                    Just making sure you re there okay 
                    and you ve got everything you need.

      But Allison digs through her bag, becoming alarmed.

                                    ALLISON
                      Everything except a pen. Oh my God, 
                    I didn t actually forget a pen.

                                  MRS. ARGENT (V.O.)
                    Don t panic. I m sure you can 
                    borrow one from another student.

                                    ALLISON
                    Okay, okay, I gotta  go. Love ya.

      Unable to take his eyes off the extraordinary girl, Scott 
      watches the school s PRINCIPAL join her on the steps.

                                  PRINCIPAL
                    Sorry to keep you waiting.

      The Principal guides her across the quad, their conversation 
      becoming clearer to Scott with every step.

                                  PRINCIPAL (CONT'D)
                    So you were saying San Francisco 
                    isn t where you grew up?                                                                                    11.



                                    ALLISON
                    No, but we stayed for more than a 
                    year which is unusual in my family. 
                    We kind of bounce around a lot 
                    because of my Dad s work.

      Even when Allison and the Principal disappear from view, 
      Scott hears the CLATTER of the building door opening, the 
      CLICKING of their heels on the tile floor of the hall.

                                  PRINCIPAL (O.S.)
                    Well, hopefully, Beacon Hills is 
                    your last stop for a while.

      The door opens, causing the rest of the class to look up.

                                  PRINCIPAL (CONT D)
                    Class, this is our new student 
                    Allison Argent. Please do your best 
                    to make her feel welcome.

      Scott barely breathes as Allison heads for the one empty desk 
      left in the room. Right behind him. 

      She puts her notebook down, then glances up to see Scott 
      turned toward her. Holding out a PEN. With a relieved but 
      curious smile, she takes it from him.

                                    ALLISON
                    Thanks.

      Scott gives her a nod. Turning around, his gaze FOCUSES on 
      Stiles s desk where his friend s SUNGLASSES sit. In the 
      MIRRORED LENSES Scott can see Allison reflected behind him 
      and he can t take his eyes off her.

                                  MR. CURTIS
                    Okay, let s begin with Kafka...


      Silence. Then the doors of the cafeteria push open. As Scott 
      steps in, the cacophony of high school lunch period SLAMS 
      into him. Every sound assaults him with pin-drop clarity.

                                  STILES
                    You all right?

        Overwhelmed, Scott doesn t even hear Stiles. His hands come 
      up to his ears to cover them when--

      He sees ALLISON across the room, paying for her food.                                                                                     12.



      The CASHIER breaks a roll of quarters, but the coins spill to 
      the floor. Scott hears each one PLINK against the tile.

      Allison immediately kneels to help the embarrassed Cashier, 
      giving a good-hearted smile to the grateful woman while the 
      other students just stand by waiting impatiently.

      Then Allison notices Scott and they connect eyes. Somehow 
      just this look from her seems to return his hearing to 
      normal. She starts to smile back, recognizing him. But then 
      Lydia Sayers swoops in front of her.

                                  LYDIA
                    That jacket is absolutely killer. 
                    Where did you get it?

                                    ALLISON
                    My Mom was a buyer for a boutique 
                    back in San Francisco.

                                  LYDIA
                    You re sitting with me.

      Taking Allison by the arm, she guides her to the popular 
      table. JACKSON, Lydia s boyfriend, pulls her toward his lap, 
      but she brushes him off, still talking to Allison.

      A few tables away, Scott sits with Stiles and their friend 
      Rebecca Harlowe, better known as HARLEY.

                                  HARLEY
                    Can somebody tell me how New Girl 
                    is here all of five minutes and 
                    she s already at Lydia s table?

                                  STILES
                    Because she s hot. Beautiful people 
                    herd together.

                                  HARLEY
                    Is that why Lydia isn t herding 
                    with you?

                                  STILES
                    Lydia s a long term project, okay? 
                    And trust me, I ve got all the 
                    patience in the world for a high 
                    yield investment like her.

                                  HARLEY
                    Well, I don t think New Girl s that 
                    pretty. Scott, you think she s 
                    pretty? Scott?                                                                                    13.



      He doesn t even blink, attention consumed by Allison.

                                  STILES
                    I d take that as a yes.

      Head cocked slightly, Scott TUNES in the conversation across 
      the room, VOICES coming into focus.

                                    ALLISON
                    A party?

                                  SENIOR
                    Friday night. We could go together.

                                    ALLISON
                    I can t. It s Family Night this 
                    Friday. But thanks for asking.

                                  SENIOR
                    You sure? Everyone s going after 
                    the scrimmage game.

                                    ALLISON
                    You mean like football?

                                    JACKSON
                    Football is a joke at Beacon. The 
                    sport here is Lacrosse. We won the 
                    state championship the last three 
                    years--

                                  LYDIA
                          (re: Jackson)
                    Because of a certain team captain.

                                    JACKSON
                    Every season starts with a 
                    scrimmage to decide the new first 
                    string. You ever watch Lacrosse?

                                    ALLISON
                    I m actually not sure how it s 
                    played other than--well, violently.

      Stiles notices Scott watching Lydia s table intently. Not 
      merely staring, but seeming to listen.

                                    JACKSON
                    Maybe you should just come see for 
                    yourself. We have practice today. 
                    You don t have to be anywhere right 
                    after school, do you?                                                                                    14.



                                    ALLISON
                    Well, no--

                                  LYDIA
                    Perfect. You re coming.


      Inside the town s lone veterinary clinic, Scott flips the 
      sign on the door to CLOSED and then grabs a few packages off 
      the reception desk.


      The door to a storage room opens into the corridor. Scott 
      backs out, hauling a huge bag of kitty litter. Setting it 
      against the wall he takes out a set of keys and unlocks the 
      next door. But just before pulling it open--

      He pauses, hand gripping the doorknob as he listens to the 
      utterly silent clinic. And then he hears it... RAIN. The 
      pattering of drops on the roof.

      Scott twists the knob and opens the door. He barely has a 
      foot inside the room when the cages filled with CATS come 
      alive with activity--

      The frightened felines suddenly bare their teeth, HISSING and 
      clawing frenetically at the cage doors. All of them focused 
      on Scott, their backs arched, struck with absolute terror.

      Stunned, he staggers out of the room, SLAMMING the door shut.


      Retreating into the waiting room, Scott can still hear the 
      pandemonium coming from inside when a HAMMERING spins him 
      around.

      Standing outside and banging on the glass door with her fist 
      is Allison. Rain-soaked it s nevertheless easy to see that 
      she s crying and in a visible panic.

      Quickly unlocking the door, Scott lets her in as she tries to 
      explain through tears what happened. 

                                    ALLISON
                    I didn t see it. I took my eyes off 
                    the road for like two seconds to 
                    switch songs on my iPod and this 
                    dog--it came out of nowhere--

                                  SCOTT
                    Okay, it s all right. Do you 
                    remember where it happened so I can 
                    send out animal control to find it?                                                                                    20.



                                    ALLISON
                    No. I mean yes, I know where I hit 
                    it. But the dog--

                                  SCOTT
                    Right. Where is it?

                                    ALLISON
                    In my car.


      Inside, Scott gently lays the injured animal down on the 
      examining table. Allison stays back, watching him inspect the 
      dog while petting it, doing an expert job of calming it.

                                  SCOTT
                    I think his leg is broken. I can 
                    splint it now myself, give him a 
                      painkiller and then let the doctor 
                    take a look in the morning.

      Allison steals glances at him, looking on with admiration as 
      he works. But Scott doesn t notice, terrified to glance at 
      the beautiful girl. When he finally does look up, he sees 
      she s hugging herself, soaked and obviously freezing.

                                  SCOTT (CONT'D)
                    I have a t-shirt in my bag.

                                    ALLISON
                    Oh, I don t want to trouble you.

      But Scott is already reaching into his bag for the shirt. 
      Allison takes it with a smile. When she steps into the hall 
      for privacy, Scott can t help but notice her REFLECTION in a 
      wall mirror. As she s pulling the wet shirt off, he catches 
      sight of her bare back. Looking away, Scott notices the dog 
      staring up at him.

                                  SCOTT
                            (whispering)
                    What? I didn t see anything.

      The dog doesn t look convinced. Allison comes back into the 
      room, now wearing his shirt and no longer shivering.

                                    ALLISON 
                    Thanks for doing this. I feel 
                    really stupid.

                                  SCOTT
                    How come?

                                    ALLISON
                    I don t know. For freaking out like 
                    a total girl.

                                  SCOTT
                    You are a girl.                                                                                    22.



                                    ALLISON
                    I freaked out like a girly girl. 
                    And I m not a girly girl.

                                  SCOTT
                    What kind of girl are you?

                                    ALLISON
                    Tougher than that. At least I 
                    thought I was.

                                  SCOTT
                    I d be freaked out too. In fact, 
                    I d probably cry. And not like a 
                    man. I d cry like the girliest 
                    girl. It would be pathetic.

                                    ALLISON
                          (laughing)
                    Yeah, right.

      Scott finishes wrapping the dog s leg.

                                  SCOTT 
                    So it looks like he s going to 
                    live. And I m pretty sure he ll 
                    even let you pet him if you want.

                                    ALLISON
                    I don t think so.

                                  SCOTT
                    Come on. You don t want him to sue. 
                    This breed is very litigious.

      Allison approaches, tentatively reaching out to stroke the 
      dog s neck. Calm now, the dog even licks her hand.

                                  SCOTT (CONT'D)
                    See? He likes you.

      He watches Allison. Unable to take his eyes off her.

                                    ALLISON
                          (noticing his stare)
                    What?

                                  SCOTT
                    Sorry. You have an eyelash on your 
                    cheek.

                                    ALLISON
                    Oh. From the crying.                                                                                    23.



      She wipes at her cheek. But the lash is still there. Scott 
      shakes his head. She tries again. Still there. So Scott 
      reaches with his thumb to brush the lash from her cheek.

                                    ALLISON (CONT'D)
                    Thanks.

      He nods, hand coming down like he s not quite sure what to do 
      with it.

                                  SCOTT
                    Um... I was wondering--I mean--is 
                    it really Family Night on Friday or 
                    do you think maybe you d like to go 
                    to that party with me?

      She throws him a curious look. How did he know she said that?

                                    ALLISON
                    Family Night was a total lie.

                                  SCOTT 
                    So is that a yes? You ll go?

                                    ALLISON
                      Definitely yes.


      Fingers click furiously over a keyboard. Eyes locked onto his 
      computer screen, Stiles bounces from one web page to the 
      next. Words and images pop up on the screen, flashing across 
      his face--

      Wolfsbane, Silver Bullets, Lycaon, Aconite, drawings of 
      werewolves in different forms, one mostly human, another a 
      massive fur-covered creature and yet another appearing as a 
      normal wolf. Image after image, page after page while...

      THROUGH THE WINDOW OUTSIDE - the sun can be seen setting on 
      Beacon Hills. A FULL MOON beginning to rise.                                                                                    28.



      As his room darkens, an increasingly panicked Stiles watches 
      a sheet of paper come out of his printer - a detailed wood 
      carving of a MEDIEVAL HUNTER standing over the body of a 
      werewolf, aiming a CROSSBOW at the creature.

      He pulls the page out, staring at it with a look of 
      escalating fear when--

      SOMEONE KNOCKS ON THE DOOR.

      Stiles practically leaps out of his chair. He rushes to the 
      door, unlocking it to find Scott standing out in the hall.

                                  STILES
                    Get in. You have to see this. I ve 
                    been reading. Websites, books, all 
                    this information.

      As Scott takes off his jacket, Stiles starts grabbing 
      printouts from his desk, pulling his computer screen around, 
      dozens of open web pages on it.

                                  SCOTT
                    How much Adderral have you had 
                    today?

                                  STILES
                    A lot. Doesn t matter. Just listen.

                                  SCOTT
                    Is this about the body? Did they 
                    find who did it?

                                  STILES
                    No, they re still questioning 
                    people. Even Derek Hale--

                                  SCOTT
                    The guy from the woods--

                                  STILES
                    Yeah, but that s not it.

                                  SCOTT
                    What then?

                                  STILES
                    Remember the joke the other day? 
                    Not a joke anymore.
                          (off his look)
                    The wolf. The bite in the woods. I 
                    started doing all this reading and--
                    Do you even know why a wolf howls?                                                                                    29.



                                  SCOTT
                    Should I?

                                  STILES
                    It s a signal. When a wolf is alone 
                    it howls to signal its location to 
                    the rest of the pack. So if you 
                    heard it howling that mean there s 
                    others. Maybe a whole pack of them.

                                  SCOTT
                    A pack of wolves?

                                  STILES
                    No. Werewolves.

                                  SCOTT
                    You re seriously wasting my time 
                    with this? You know, I m picking 
                    Allison up in an hour.

                                  STILES
                    I saw you on the field, Scott. What 
                    you did wasn t just amazing. It was 
                      impossible.

                                  SCOTT
                    So I made a good shot.

                                  STILES
                    No, you made an incredible shot. 
                    The way you moved--the speed, your 
                      reflexes--people can t suddenly do  
                    that overnight. And then there s 
                    the hearing, the senses, and don t 
                    think I haven t noticed you don t 
                    need your inhaler anymore. You 
                    haven t used it since that night.

                                  SCOTT
                    I can t think about this now. We ll 
                    talk tomorrow, okay?

                                  STILES
                    Tomorrow? Don t you get it? The 
                    full moon is tonight.

                                  SCOTT 
                    What are you trying to do? I just 
                    made starting lineup. I have a date 
                    with a girl I can t believe 
                    actually wants to go out with me. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    30.

                                  SCOTT  (CONT'D)
                      Everything in my life is somehow 
                    perfect. Why are you trying to ruin 
                    it?

                                  STILES
                    I m trying to help. With the full 
                    moon it s going to be too hard to 
                    resist and there s no going back. 
                    You re cursed, Scott. And it s not 
                    only that the moon causes you to 
                    change, it s also when your 
                    bloodlust will be at its peak.

                                  SCOTT
                      Bloodlust?

                                  STILES
                    Your urge to kill.

                                  SCOTT
                    I m already starting to have an 
                    urge to kill, Stiles.

                                  STILES
                    You need to hear this. The change 
                    can be caused by anger or anything 
                    that raises your pulse. And I ve 
                    never seen anyone raise your pulse 
                    like Allison does. You have to 
                    cancel your date. You have to call 
                    her.

      Stiles grabs Scott s jacket, pulling the cell phone out.

                                  SCOTT
                    What are you doing? Give me that.

                                  STILES
                    I m just finding her number--

                                  SCOTT
                    Give it to me.

      Stiles looks up to see Scott s eyes flash YELLOW for a brief 
      second. His voice low and guttural, he yanks the phone out of 
      Stiles s hand and SHOVES him against the wall.

      Pulling back before striking him, Scott instead LASHES out at 
      the desk chair sending it flying across the room, tossed like 
      it weighed nothing. Then, shaking with anger, he gazes up.

                                  SCOTT (CONT'D)
                    I didn t mean to do that.                                                                                    31.



      He starts to help Stiles up, but his friend flinches back.

                                  SCOTT (CONT'D)
                    I m sorry. Really, I didn t mean 
                    it. I have to go. I have to get 
                    ready for the party. I m sorry.

      Grabbing his jacket, Scott hurries out.

      Still shaken, Stiles gradually stands. He slowly picks up the 
      desk chair, putting it back. But then he pauses. With a shaky 
      hand, he turns the chair around to reveal...

      CLAW MARKS. The chair s fabric slashed to ribbons.

                                                                          FADE OUT.

      Towel around his waist, Scott yanks his closet door open and 
      starts tossing clothes onto his bed.

                                    MELISSA MCCALL
                    Big date?

                                  SCOTT
                    Mom, a little privacy please?

                                    MELISSA MCCALL
                    Hold on, what do we have here...

      She approaches, feeling his chin with her thumb.

                                    MELISSA MCCALL (CONT'D)
                    I think it might be time for you to 
                    start shaving.

      Something begins to happen to their VOICES. The quality 
      starts to change. Becoming TINNY as we pull back--


      Handing a cup to Allison, Scott keeps throwing nervous 
      glances back at the outside porch of the house. He takes a 
      gulp of the beer and then COUGHS, nearly spitting it out.

                                  SCOTT
                    That tastes terrible.

      Allison laughs at him, covering her mouth with her hand.

                                  SCOTT (CONT'D)
                    Now I see what they mean about an 
                    acquired taste.

                                    ALLISON
                    I ve actually never been drunk. I 
                    usually go to these parties and 
                    just stand there with a Diet Coke.

                                  SCOTT
                    Stiles and I got drunk on Tequila 
                    one night. The next morning I felt 
                    like I had a flamethrower pointed 
                    at my forehead.

                                    ALLISON 
                    Okay, since neither of us is any 
                    good at drinking, how are you at 
                    dancing?

                                  SCOTT
                    Much better. Infinitely better.

      Under the driving pulse of techno, Scott takes her hand, 
      pulling her into the crowd of dancing teenagers. Then as they 
      begin moving, as Allison starts to smile back at him, the 
      usually timid Scott begins to let go.

      His hands reach around her waist with the other teens pushing 
      them closer. Bodies pressed against each other, her cheek 
      brushes lightly against his.

      Then through the crowd, Scott notices Lydia dancing with 
      Jackson, grinding close to him, her fingers wrapped around 
      the back of his neck.

      She presses her lips to Jackson s locking him in a passionate 
      kiss. As he eagerly kisses her back, sliding his hands down 
      past her waist, Lydia opens her eyes.

      And looks right at Scott.                                                                                    35.



      Staring at him as she kisses Jackson. Unused to the attention 
      of one beautiful girl, much less two, Scott finds himself 
      dumbstruck until the bodies of the dancing teens push 
      together to leave him alone with Allison again.

      As Scott peers into her eyes, for a second it almost looks as 
      though they re about to kiss.

      Then the thumping beat of the music begins driving faster, 
      starting to sound almost like the quickening of a heartbeat. 
      Scott s HEARTBEAT.

      The sounds around him INTENSIFY. His fingers clench back, 
      veins at the surface of his hands as he presses against the 
      fabric of Allison s shirt. His upper lip pulls up momentarily 
      to reveal a sharpened incisor. 

      Lights GLARING in his eyes, Scott takes a hard swallow as his 
      breathing tightens, sweat beading his temples. He loses the 
      beat of the music, stepping back and pulling away.

                                  SCOTT (CONT'D)
                    Sorry. I have to... I have to use 
                    the bathroom.

                                    ALLISON
                    Are you okay?

      But he hurries past her and into the hallway.


      Teeth clenched, a sudden wave of pain SLAMS Scott back 
      against the wall, tremors shuddering through his body.

      Waiting in line for the bathroom, Harley notices him against 
      the wall, his arms wrapped around his stomach.

                                  HARLEY
                    Scott? You all right?

      But he doesn t answer, pushing through the crowd, trying to 
      find an exit out of the house. But one door leads to two 
      teens making out on a bed. Another to a smoke filled room 
      crowded with stoners. He can t seem to find a way out.

      Gasps sounding more like animalistic growls, he crashes 
      through the kitchen, shoving past people to the open door and 
      out to the backyard.


      Scott stumbles into his room, slamming the door shut. But 
      even as he s turning the lock, another wave of pain wracks 
      his body. He falls back, hitting his dresser and catching his 
      reflection in the mirror above where--

      TWO GLOWING, YELLOW EYES stare back at him.

      Crouched on the floor, breathing hard and with sweat 
      streaming down his forehead, Scott squeezes his eyes shut 
      trying to push back the animal inside when someone POUNDS on 
      the door.

                                  SCOTT
                    Go away!

                                  STILES (O.S.)
                    Scott, it s me.

      Hearing the panic in his friend s voice, he pulls himself up. 
      He unlocks the door but only allows it to open an inch.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Let me in, Scott I can help--

                                  SCOTT
                    No.

      Eyes still burning YELLOW, he stays hidden behind the door.

                                  SCOTT (CONT'D)
                    Listen, you have to find Allison. 
                    Take her home--

                                  STILES
                    She s fine. I saw her get a ride. 
                    She s totally fine.                                                                                    37.



                                  SCOTT
                    Stiles, I think I know who it is.

                                  STILES
                    Just let me in and we can talk.

                                  SCOTT
                    It s Derek. Derek Hale s the 
                    werewolf. He s the one who bit me. 
                    He s the one who killed the girl in 
                    the woods.

      Scott listens. But there s nothing but shocked silence from 
      the other side of the door. Until--

                                  STILES
                    Scott... Derek s the one who drove 
                    Allison from the party.
