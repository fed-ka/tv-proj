      PEOPLE gathered, looking, frightened -- and we now see OUR 
        SURROUNDINGS -- Los Angeles, in the year 2045.  Some of what 
      we know and see, but some wild mega-structures and a handful 
      of speeding HOVER VEHICLES --

      John sees in the intersection, a figure ON A SLEEK FUTURE 
      MOTORBIKE -- he holds a beefy BLASTER -- and he suddenly 
      SKIDS A 180 AND RIDES OFF -- and John runs and STOPS A 
      PASSING CAR -- 

                                  JOHN
                    I need your vehicle!

      The driver can barely say,  What the fuck--  when John holds 
      up his WALLET WITH A SLEEK LAPD BADGE:                                                                                       5.


                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    I m a cop!  

      And the Driver gets out and John gets in and CHASES THE GUY 
      ON THE BIKE!


      Quick, thrilling shots as John chases the bike -- turning ONE 
      hair-pin turn, then ANOTHER - 


      John BLASTS out of the car, watching helplessly as the  
      transporter disappears into the night. Just then, A COP CAR 
      SWERVES IN -- two UNIFORMS get out. 

                                  JOHN
                    ... I am no longer able to pursue. 
                    Heading northbound.
                          (showing his badge to the 
                            cops)
                    Roll an air ship.

      One of the cops runs back to his car. John and the other cop 
      watch the craft as it disappears into the night. John wrnkles 
      his brow -- SOMETHING occurring to him. The Uniform Cop #1 
      looks at John.                                                                                       6.


                                    UNIFORM COP
                    What is it?

                                  JOHN
                    ... Two transporters like that were 
                    just stolen by the Insyndicate two 
                    days ago. 

      HOLD ON JOHN -- SOMETHING DOESN T FEEL RIGHT... INSYNDICATE 
      (who? We shall find out). We PUSH IN ON JOHN as he gets a bad 
      feeling... CUT BACK TO:


      John exits, pale with panic, looks around frantically -- then 
      --  DRINNNG  -- his cell phone beckons. CLOSE ON JOHN S PHONE 
      -- A small HOLOGRAM of the building in 3D appears. A blinking 
      dot -- Anna s CELL PHONE SIGNAL sent from dispatch is 
      visible.  Which shows she s STILL THERE -- IN THE BUILDING -- 
      BUT MOVING UP -- John looks up the face of the tall building, 
      and we CUT TO:


      -- where he finds a FLYING VEHICLE, CLOSE, LOUD, WINDY, 
      COMING IN FOR A ROOF LANDING -- and there, across the roof is 
      ANNA, being grabbed by a MAN -- LONG HAIR -- DARK CLOTHES (he 
      will be known, importantly, as LONG HAIR) -- and ANOTHER MAN 
      who GETS INSIDE THE HOVERING VEHICLE --

                                  JOHN
                    Anna!!!

      LONG HAIR TURNS AND FIRES HIS BLASTER -- JOHN LEAPS OUT OF 
      THE WAY, takes cover, his mind racing, heart pounding -- he 
      has no weapon -- he looks back as they get in --

      He RACES FOR THEM, taking cover behind whatever he can as 
      they FORCE HER INTO THE VEHICLE, FIRING AT HIM -- but he 
      can t lose her now -- and he RUNS FOR HER as he sees her 
      struggling inside the vehicle -- and then ALL GOES SLOW 
      MOTION AS HE RUNS -- 

      And he can SEE them inside the transparent vehicle top AS 
      THEY SHOOT HER -- BANG! BLOOD STAINS THE GLASS AS THE VEHICLE 
      TAKES OFF AGAIN -- and JOHN JUST CAN T STOP RUNNING, 
      SCREAMING HER NAME -- AND HE RUNS AND THE VEHICLE FLIES OFF -- 
      AND JOHN RUNS -- 

      RIGHT OFF THE FUCKING EDGE OF THE BUILDING... INTO NOTHING 
      BUT SPACE AND HE WAKES UP IN:


      ... it wasn t all a dream.  Here we are, a few years later in 
      2048.  LA really is this wild place.  And all that, as far as 
      we can tell, really happened.

      Needless to say, these memories haunt our main character, and 
      Anna is dead.  And in most every meaningful way, so is John. 
      And off this, CUT TO:


      To establish. 


      Dozens of the future LAPD vehicles are parked -- they get 
      into their UNMARKED CRUISER -- it looks mean.


      Low but cool-moving HELICOPTER VIEW of a non-descript 
      industrial park.  HUGE BUILDINGS and FLYING MACHINES way off 
      in the distance.


      John FINDS THE THICK BLACK WIRES COMING FROM THE INSIDE -- 
      they run up the wall to the roof -- He climbs up...

      JOHN S POV - There are tiny grid-like cubes resting there. 
      ANOTHER COP calls up. 

                                    ANOTHER UNIFORM
                    What is it? 

                                  JOHN
                    Solar cubes. Looks like they wanted 
                    to stay off the power grid. 

                                    ANOTHER UNIFORM
                    Off the power grid -- hermetically 
                    sealed windows -- 

                                  JOHN
                          (thinking the same thing)
                    Yeah, some sort of lab. 

      Then:

                                    A THIRD UNIFORM
                    John? ...Found something.                                                                                     22.



      -- John runs -- finds the FLYING VEHICLE, CLOSE, LOUD, WINDY, 
      COMING IN FOR A ROOF LANDING -- across the roof is ANNA, 
      being grabbed by LONG HAIR and ANOTHER MAN who GETS INSIDE 
      THE HOVERING VEHICLE. As we saw before, John YELLS FOR HIS 
      WIFE and the LONG HAIR MAN TURNS AND FIRES HIS BLASTER --

      BACK TO REAL TIME 

      John considers the strange weapon -- haunted. 


      WE TRACK WITH A UNIFORM THROUGH THE HALL entering the 
      apartment -- The Uniform comes up to John.  

                                    UNIFORM COP
                    The safe house has been 
                      compromised.  


      John s car speeds through the city streets like crazy -- 
      madness --


      Cortez and the rest load the Captured Thief and split up into 
      numerous vehicles - tossing aluminum CANISTERS as they escape 
      -- HUGE EXPLOSIONS rock the area as they speed off, 
      preventing them from being followed.                                                                                    24.


      John SCREECHES HIS CAR to a stop near the explosions, gets 
      out, and runs through them -- 


      John s car pulls into an ally. 


      This street gang is violent. Tattoos all over them. But the 
      tattoos seems to shimmer -- it s cool.  

                                  JOHN
                          (to the biggest one)
                     Hola.

      But, suddenly, we HEAR footsteps approaching from behind -- 
      the MX draws its weapon, pointing it at the gang. Of course, 
      they, in turn, raise their own weapons and we INSTANTLY have 
        a highly-charged stand off. 

      John, freaked out, quickly defuses the situation.

                  JOHN (CONT D)MX-43
      No, no, no, no, no. Everyone Six of these suspects are 
      calm down. Calm down! Hang on currently violating parole - 
      a sec! they are armed. Two of them 
        (to the MX)have outstanding bench 
      ... What are you doing man? I warrants for felony 1s. You 
      told you to stay in the car. are in danger.  

                                  GANG MEMBER
                          (gun trained, scared)
                    I m gonna drop this Borg. I ve seen 
                    what they do. First hand. -- I m 
                    gonna drop him.                                                                                      31.


                                  JOHN
                    No, no, he s not gonna do anything 
                    here. Okay. 
                          (to the MX)
                    Put your weapon down. 

      The MX is unmoving, and he looks mean, and we can see how 
      they would be scary for bad guys -- Beat. 

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                    I m not in danger. Put. Your 
                    weapon. Down. 

      The MX lowers his weapon as told. Then, after a tense beat --  
      A VOICE from behind them --

                                  PUSHER
                          (in Spanish)
                    [What s with him?]

      John turns, seeing PUSHER,(20s), calmly standing there with 
      take-out food. He s tattooed like the rest - this is who John 
      came to see. And off this, CUT TO: 


      CLOSE ON A PIPE being lit -- something is being smoked. 
      REVEAL it s one of the GANGBANGERS, inhaling what we can only 
      assume is illegal drugs. The smoke is blue-tinged. And he s 
      doing it right in front of the MX-43, who is standing off to 
      the side now, waiting for John. 

      Further in the ally, John talks with Pusher alone. They have 
      a rapport -- John works the streets and he respects the 
      streets. Years of experience breeds trust. 

      Pusher walks to a box-crate and sits down with his food, he 
      moves a BAD ASS FUTURE ASSAULT RIFLE. 

                                  PUSHER
                          (in Spanish with 
                            subtitles)
                    [You didn t see this.]

      Pusher starts eating. 

                                  PUSHER (CONT D)
                          (in Spanish with 
                            subtitles)
                    [I ve heard of something twisted 
                    and weird, if that s what you re 
                    looking for.]                                                                                     32.


                                  JOHN
                          (in Spanish with 
                            subtitles)
                    [New? This would be a new drug. 
                    Something you ve never seen before. 
                    Very recent.] 

      Pusher nods. 

                                  JOHN (CONT D)
                          (In Spanish with 
                            subtitles)
                    [I want some.]

                                  PUSHER
                    I said I heard of it -- didn t say 
                    I can get it. I said I know a place 
                    that someone is trippin . I don t 
                    know who s distributing it.
                          (beat)
                    But, it s freaky.

                                  JOHN
                    ... How freaky?

      He just stares at John as he chews... Off this, CUT TO:


      MANY COP CARS AND EMERGENCY PERSONNEL. The writhing guy is 
      placed in an ambulance and driven away. John, stunned, 
      watches with the MX-43. 


      -- CARS SWERVE, as the robot tumbles, SPECTACULAR!!! - AS IT 
      GETS CRUSHED, HIT, RUN OVER and SMASHED INTO OBLIVION. HOLY. 
      FUCKING. SHIT!!!                                                                                      34.



      A CRIME SCENE is set up. John and Dorian arrive... they get 
      out of the car. 

      John walks through the crime scene, coming upon the CAPTURED 
      THIEF, dead, eyes open. 

      A CSI is working on him.  John now walks over to the head CSI 
      OFFICER.

                                  CSI OFFICER
                    He was dumped here. Overdose. Heart 
                    attack I think. Just waiting for 
                    the ME Lifter.   

      The CSI notices Dorian behind John, looking at the body. 

                                  DORIAN
                    He was dumped here? 

      The CSI nods. 

                                  DORIAN (CONT D)
                          (to the CSI)
                    Can you get me a shrapnel removal 
                    canister. 

      The CSI goes to his kit and finds what Dorian is looking for -
      - a small instrument that has a thin canister and a tube-like 
      spout.  

                                  CSI OFFICER
                    I said he likely died of a heart 
                    attack, not a gunshot. There s no 
                    shrapnel to suck out of his tissue. 

      Dorian says nothing, he s a man inspired. He gets down 
      carefully on his knees, and VERY GINGERLY moves the dead 
      Thief s head sideways. 

      ON JOHN - wondering what he is doing. 

      Dorian takes the shrapnel removal canister, readies himself, 
      and QUICKLY OPENS THE THIEF S MOUTH, JACKS THE CANISTER 
      INSIDE, AND PULLS THE TRIGGER, ALL AT ONCE!!!                                                                                     55.


      We see that Dorian has captured AIR FROM THE THIEF S LUNGS!

      Beat. 

                                  DORIAN
                          (holds up the canister)
                    This is the last breath of air he 
                    took. ... We ll analyze it through 
                    air quality control.

      Dorian hands the canister to the CSI. 

                                  DORIAN (CONT D)
                    By the distinct micro attributes in 
                    this sample, we should be able to 
                    identify, within a few city blocks, 
                    where he died. 

      You could hear a pin drop. 

      And off John, fucking impressed-- 


      Dorian stands by the car, waiting.  John approaches. He looks 
      at Dorian for a moment. 

                                  JOHN
                    That was good police work back 
                    there. 

      Dorian nods. 

                                  DORIAN
                    My cognition is coming back and 
                    will only become stronger. 

      Beat.

                                  DORIAN (CONT D)
                    I m here to protect and serve for 
                    you. At all costs -- in any way 
                    possible. 

      John stares at him -- considering Dorian, like he knows 
      something.  

                                  DORIAN (CONT D)
                    What?

                                  JOHN
                    See, I have the gift of perception 
                    too. ... I know a thing or two 
                    about psychology... 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    56.

                                  JOHN (CONT'D)
                          (then...)
                    I know you re trying very hard to 
                    impress me. ... You re down-playing 
                    it... but you want so bad for me to 
                    like you... to see your value. 
                          (then...)
                    ... So I won t see my way clear to 
                    stick you on that one-way aerobus 
                    to LAX. 
                          (then)
                    ... You re terrified. 

      There s a beat. It s LONGER than we expect -- and it s clear 
      John hit pay dirt. This is John calling Dorian out. 

                                  DORIAN
                    I was programmed to be a cop. 
                    That s all I want to be. It s my 
                    purpose. 
                          (beat)
                    Don t we all want to come face to 
                    face with our purpose? 

      John watches Dorian... It s the most HUMAN thing we ve heard 
      him say. 

      And although we don t REALLY understand a lot yet about what 
      a Synthetic Soul IS... we know what was just said came from 
      there. 

      HOLD ON Dorian - unsure of where he stands. A TACTICAL 
      OFFICER walks up. 

                                  TACTICAL OFFICER
                    We got a carbon pollution match. 
                    San Pedro. Long Beach. 

      And off this, CUT TO:


      This is an area jammed with industrial factories. John and 
      Dorian pull up in John s car and get out - looking around. 

      Not much happening. And dark. 

                                  JOHN
                    What time is it? 

                                  DORIAN
                    11:40. Why?                                                                                    57.


                                  JOHN
                    How many factories are burning here 
                    at quarter to twelve? 

      Dorian follows John s gaze, looks to the building in the 
      middle -- a smoke twist comes up into the night s sky through 
      the smokestacks. 

      John turns, seeing A THRONG OF POLICE BACKUP arriving. CUT 
      TO:


      John blasts out the roof door -- searching -- WIND and NOISE 
      are insane from the hovercraft.  

      John SEES Reinhardt climbing into the craft -- he FIRES!!! 
      BANG BANG BANG BANG. 

      LONG HAIR appears, UH OH, has John dead to rights. But, John 
      keeps firing at the craft -- oblivious. John hits a tail 
      rotor. The machine pitches, and spins, causing the wind to 
      BLOW LONG HAIR RIGHT OFF THE FUCKING ROOF!!! Holy shit! He 
      falls, LANDS HORRIFICALLY, DEAD OF COURSE.                                                                                     61.


      The hovercraft, in trouble, has no choice but to set down on 
      the roof. DORIAN BLASTS OUT THE DOOR - followed by TACTICAL 
      COPS, MX-43s. They swarm the hovercraft. 

      They pull Reinhardt from the craft, push him to the ground 
      and cuff him. 

      John goes to the ledge, and looks down. He sees Long Hair, 
      the man who killed Anna, dead on the ground below. Holy shit! 
      And off this, CUT TO:


      .... John YELLS FOR HIS WIFE and the LONG HAIR MAN TURNS AND 
      FIRES HIS BLASTER -- JOHN LEAPS OUT OF THE WAY, takes cover, 
      mind racing, heart pounding -- he has no weapon -- he looks 
      back as they get in --

      He RACES FOR THEM, taking cover behind whatever he can as 
      they FORCE HER INTO THE VEHICLE, FIRING AT HIM -- he RUNS FOR 
      HER as he sees her struggling inside the vehicle -- AND SEES 
      THEM INSIDE THE TRANSPARENT VEHICLE TOP AS THEY SHOOT HER -- 
      AND BLOOD STAINS THE GLASS AS THE VEHICLE TAKES OFF AGAIN -- 
      ... But THIS time, when we see it, IN TRUTH, SHE IS SHOT, BUT 
      IT ISN T CLEAR THAT SHE IS KILLED... CUT BACK TO:


      To establish.  


      John and Dorian walk to the car. FUTURE LA looms large in the 
      B.G. John stops before he gets in. Considers Dorian. 

                                  JOHN
                    Call me John. 

      Beat. Dorian nods, digesting that. John gets in the car.
