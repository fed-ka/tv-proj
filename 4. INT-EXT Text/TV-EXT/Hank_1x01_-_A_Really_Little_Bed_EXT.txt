(Hank, Tilly, Maddie, Henry)

HANK AND TILLY ENTER AN EMPTY HOUSE.  AN OLD TRADITIONAL WITH 
HARDWOOD FLOORS, BIG WINDOWS AND CHARACTER TO SPARE, THE 
PLACE IS NOT HUGE, BUT IT S CERTAINLY COMFORTABLE.  WITH A 
LITTLE LOVE THIS COULD BE SOMEPLACE SPECIAL.  THEY WANDER 
AROUND, TAKING IT ALL IN.  NOT LOOKING WHERE THEY RE GOING, 
THEY ALMOST WALK INTO EACH OTHER -- THEY BOTH MOVE THIS WAY 
AND THAT, TRYING TO GET OUT OF EACH OTHER S WAY.

                                HANK

              Shall we dance?

HE SPINS HER AROUND GRACEFULLY.  THEY STAY ARM IN ARM.

                                TILLY

              I know the last few months have been 

              tough for you, Hank.  

                                HANK

              No tougher than for you.

                                TILLY

              (GETS CLOSE) That s why we have to 

              make sure we  christen  the house 

              tonight.  I bought a little nightie... 

              very little... almost... imaginary. 

HANK LOOKS AT TILLY A MOMENT.

                                HANK

              I like you a great deal.

A CLOSE MOMENT BETWEEN THEM.

HANK AND TILLY PUT ON BIG SMILES.  HENRY, AN IMAGINATIVE, 
GOOFY, 10 YEAR OLD WITH WAY TOO MUCH ENERGY IN HIS LITTLE 
BODY, STAGGERS IN HOLDING A STICK TO HIS BELLY AS IF HE S 
BEEN RUN THOUGH WITH A SWORD.  HE CROSSES TO HANK.

TILLY INDICATES HE SHOULD PULL THE SWORD OUT.  HANK DOES.

              Thanks, that was close, this house is 

              old, you think people have died here?

                                HENRY (CONT'D)

              (DELIGHTED) I just freaked myself out!

HE TAKES HIS STICK-SWORD FROM HANK, PUTS IT IN A BELT LOOP 
AND RUNS OUT THE BACK DOOR TO EXPLORE.

              carrying on the Pryor name?

              Try coming to one of his parent 

              teacher conferences.  They refer to 

              Henry as  hyper-imaginative.

BUT UNMOTIVATED, AND, LIKE MANY TEENAGERS, NOT A FAN OF HER
