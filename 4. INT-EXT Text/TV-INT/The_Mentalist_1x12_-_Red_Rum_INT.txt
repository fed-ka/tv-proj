      A modest home.  Nothing fancy about it.  Lots of Cody's 
      football trophies and stuff serve as decor.  Cody's parents, 
      MICHAEL and JANICE ELKINS, (40) and Cody's brother, BRAD, 
      (14) -- a slightly nerdy, intense, emo kid are on the couch 
      together, holding hands. 

      Lisbon and CHO talk with them as Jane moves around the room, 
      touching and looking, absorbing the Elkins' vibe.

                    When did you last see Cody?

                                    MICHAEL
                    Friday night after the game.  Cody 
                    plays wide receiver for the high 
                    school team.  They got blown out on 
                    Friday, but it's a pretty good team 
                    this year.  Nationally ranked.   

                                  LISBON
                    When exactly did you see him last 
                    on Friday?

                                    MICHAEL
                    When he went to bed.  We were all  
                    three of us out of the house early 
                    the next morning.  By the time we 
                    came home, around midday, Cody was 
                    gone.  He was supposed to go meet 
                    the coach for some extra practice, 
                    but he never showed up. 



                                                                            (CONTINUED)        THE MENTALIST        "Red Rum"        SALMON 11/12/08        7.

      Janice starts crying, which makes Brad get up and ghost out 
      of the room.  Jane watches him go.

                                  LISBON
                    That Friday night, what was his 
                    state of mind?   

                                  JANICE
                    He was fine.  Fine.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Well, he was a little angry with 
                    himself about the game.  

      Janice acknowledges the truth of that.

                                    MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                    He had made some mental errors.  
                    Coach Dee got on him pretty good, 
                    and Cody kind of pushed back some.  

                                  LISBON
                    They had a fight?

                                    MICHAEL
                    You could say.  But you know, 
                    locker room stuff.  A lot of 
                    shouting.  Nothing serious. 
                    Cody just wanted to do better.   

                                  JANICE
                    How, how did he die?

                                  CHO
                    There were indications around the 
                    body of some kind of black magic 
                    ritual.  Did he have any friends or 
                      acquaintances who were involved in 
                    that kind of thing?

      Michael and Janice react strongly, look at each other wide-
      eyed.

                                  JANICE
                    Oh my God.  It was her.

                                    MICHAEL

                                    MICHAEL
                    Tamzin Dove.  She's into all that 
                    black magic stuff.  

                                  JANICE
                    Claims she's a witch.  Says she has 
                    powers.

                                  LISBON
                    And she had some resentment toward  
                    Cody?

                                    MICHAEL
                    About a week ago, she accused him 
                    of stealing her cat.

                                  LISBON
                    Did he?

                                  JANICE 
                    No.  Of course not.  But she said 
                    she put a spell on him in revenge. 

      Jane's suddenly interested.

                                  JANE
                    A spell?  What kind of a spell?

                                  JANICE
                    I don't know.  But she actually 
                    called him and told him that she'd 
                    done it.  

                                  LISBON
                    That must have been worrisome.

                                    MICHAEL
                    At the time, Cody thought it was 
                    kind of funny.  I mean, she's a 
                    geek.  That's why we didn't think 
                    of her right away.    

                                  LISBON
                    Where can we find Tamzin Dove?


      As Rigsby and Van Pelt move through rows of lockers, benches, 
      used towels strewn about, etc, Rigsby swipes a FOOTBALL off 
      the floor.

                    Hey, think fast.

      Rigsby tosses it to Van Pelt.  She stands there as Rigsby 
      goes out for a pass like a tight-end...

                                  VAN PELT
                    Fine.  Go long.

      Rigsby runs out.  Van Pelt makes the pass.  With precision.  
      And speed.  Rigsby catches it.  Impressed.

      Lisbon, Cho and Jane...

                      I promise, if you're turned into a 
                    frog, I'll find a beautiful 
                    princess to kiss you, if it's the 
                    last thing I do.


      Led by Jane, Lisbon and Cho enter and move through a darkly 
      pagan, but stylish Wiccan home (DECOR TBD).  

      Jane enters the LIVING ROOM, and finds Tamzin Dove -- zaftig, 
      big hair, dressed in romantic black -- sitting in an arm 
      chair, a table set with a steaming teapot, and four cups.  
      Tamzin's manner is weird, abstracted, as if she's living on a 
      different astral plane, seeing things that we can't.  It's 
      hard to tell if she's play-acting or a little nuts, maybe a 
      bit of both.

      Jane sits down.  Cho and Lisbon perforce, do the same, just a 
      little freaked out.

      True.  Jane nods appreciatively.

                    You were expecting us then.

                                  TAMZIN
                    Of course.  I heard what was done 
                    to Cody Elkins.  They used a 
                    pentacle and a flame.  Made it look 
                    like witchcraft.  Wicca.  Naturally 
                    you'd come to me.  I'm the only

      Tamzin Dove comes from the kitchen with a plate of cookies. 
      Offers them around.  Jane takes one.  Lisbon declines, as 
      does Cho.

                    rain and the animals would take 
                    care of Cody.  You can't help him.  

                                  LISBON
                    True.  We can't.  What we can do is 
                    find and punish the people that 
                    murdered him.

                                  TAMZIN
                    There's no need.  Cody deserved to 
                    die.  He was a bad person.  He 
                    stole and tortured and killed my 
                    cat.  I saw him take it.

                                  LISBON
                    Why would he do that?

                    Fear I guess.  That's just the way

      Coach Dieter glares grumpily at Van Pelt and Rigsby.

                                  COACH

                    So that you can explain why 
                    forensics tells us your blood is 
                    all over a T-shirt we found in 
                    Cody's locker.   

      Coach Dieter sighs, looks embarrassed.

                                  COACH
                    I told you.  We had an argument.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Now you're saying you had an actual 
                    fist fight?  He drew blood?

                    Yeah.  It was no big deal.         
                    I chewed him out.  He got mad, took 
                    a couple swings at me.

                    got mad over a card game or some 
                    crap, and beat Danno unconscious.  
                    Had to be dragged off him.

                      Seriously, don't sweat it.  We had 
                    a witch at my college.  It's not a 
                    satanic cult.  They're nerds in

                    There he is.

      Cho's pointing out the window at DANIEL BROWN, (16) exiting 
      school.  A backpack hangs off his shoulder.

      Rigsby and Cho get out of the car, come up on Daniel.

                    Daniel Brown.

                    CBI.  We've got some questions 
                    about Cody Elkins.

      But Daniel suddenly does an about-face and in true form, 
      Daniel dodges both Rigsby and Cho, as if he's making his way 
      down the field, runs back toward the street.  

      Rigsby and Cho TAKE OFF after him, giving chase down the road 
      when a PANEL TRUCK approaches AT SPEED.  The truck brakes 
      hard, and swerves to a stop, narrowly missing Cho, forcing 
      him to jump out of the way. 

      Rigsby tackles Daniel Brown down to the neighbor's lawn.   
      Kneeling, Cho starts to help Rigsby cuff him.

      The audience sees before Cho and Rigsby do that the panel 
      truck -- large in BG -- has A PAINTED LION ALONG THE SIDE, 
      WEARING A CROWN -- and a caption that reads: KINGSLY CARPET 
      CLEANERS.

                    Let me go.  Let me go!

      Cho stops dead and stares at the lion.

      FADE IN:


      RIGSBY walks in hard and fast, sits across the table from 
      DANIEL BROWN, trying to rattle him a little.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Tell me about your fight with Cody

                    Oh?  He beat you unconscious is 
                    what we heard.  We have witnesses.

                                  DANIEL
                    Who?  No.  Wasn't that bad.  

                                  RIGSBY
                    Put you in the hospital.

                                  DANIEL

                    Why didn't you press charges?

                                  DANIEL
                    It was a misunderstanding between 
                    friends.  Nobody's fault.

                    Perhaps you figured to get revenge 
                    more directly.

                                  DANIEL

                                  DANIEL
                    We were over at Roy T's place 
                    playing cards, drinking.  His mom's 
                    in rehab so he's got the run of the 
                    place.  I did some trash talking 
                    and Cody got mad.  We fought.  He 
                    won.  That's all.   

      Jane enters, pulls up a chair close, so that his knees touch 
      Daniel's.  

                                  JANE
                    Look in my eyes.

      Daniel is not keen, but obeys.

                          (forcefully but calm)
                    Don't look away.  What did you say 
                    that angered Cody?

                                  DANIEL
                    You know it's a card game, lot of 
                    trash talking.  I was tripping on 
                    his family, like your mama's a ho, 
                    your dad's a punk bitch...  

      Daniel's eyes drop and go back to Jane.  It's hard to keep 
      eye contact. 

                                  JANE
                    If you don't keep your eyes on me, 
                    I can't tell if you're being 
                    honest.

                                  DANIEL
                    I'm looking at you, man.  Cody went 
                    off.  Baaam.  Smashes a beer bottle 
                    over my head.  No warning.  I'm out 
                    cold, but the guys tell me he tried 
                    to seriously stomp me out.  If they 
                    hadn't of grabbed him, I could be

                    Is she in custody?  The witch?

                    Why not?

                                  JANE
                    She does admit to putting a spell 
                    on your son, as you said.  But that 
                    doesn't constitute a criminal 
                    offense.  It's protected free 
                    speech.     

                                  JANICE
                    So why are you here?

                                  CHO
                    It seems Cody had some violence 
                    issues that we need to speak about.

                                  JANICE
                    No!  He was a good boy.   

      JANE'S POV:  Brad comes quietly downstairs and heads to the 
      back of the house...

                                  CHO
                    We're not saying otherwise, ma'am, 
                    but if he had problems with his 
                    temper, that might help explain the 
                    context leading to his death.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Fine.  Yes.  And I know where this 
                    is going.  Cody had a fight with 
                    him, and yes, we gave Daniel some 
                    money to make up for any, any 
                      inconvenience.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Alright, I gave Daniel Brown the 
                    money to keep him quiet.  Cody has, 
                    had, a real shot at a college 
                    career.  Would've been the first 
                    Elkins to have that chance.  We 
                    were so proud.  But if coaches hear 
                    about those kind of run-ins... it 
                    could've ruined his chances with 
                    the top schools. 

                                  CHO
                    Had those 'run-ins' ever happened 
                    before?

                    No.

                                  JANICE
                    No.  Our son had no problem with 
                    violence.  It was an isolated 
                    incident.

      Michael looks around, suspicious.

      Rigsby opens a lunchbox and is dismayed to find carrots and 
      nuts and such.

      Wicca mood MUSIC PLAYS.  The room is lit only by candles.   

      Wearing an ornate robe, Tamzin Dove stands -- priestess-like -- 
      at the center of a PENTACLE MAT on the floor.  She holds a 
      sorcerer's knife and a glass of milk.   

      Brad Elkins -- in only his jeans and blindfolded -- is led 
      into the living room by two cloaked and hooded figures.   

      They lay him down on the floor -- face up -- at Tamzin's 
      feet. 

      Tamzin raises the knife and the glass above her head and 
      begins murmuring a Latin chant...

                                  TAMZIN

      Holding the knife and glass of milk high, Tamzin walks in 
      circles around Brad, lying on the floor as before.

                                  TAMZIN
                    By blood has he been sullied, by

      The MUSIC increases in tempo and intensity.  Tamzin repeats 
      the same Latin chant...

                                  TAMZIN

      She spills milk on Brad, and stabs at the air over his body, 
      getting closer and closer. 


      Their guns drawn, Rigsby and Van Pelt move down the dark 
      hallway, cautious.  The chanting getting louder, as they 
      finally--


      -- burst in on the ritual, guns aimed, held high.

                                  RIGSBY/VAN PELT
                    Drop the knife!  Get down!  Get 
                    down!

      Tamzin and her terrified acolytes do what they're told.  As 
      Rigsby and Van Pelt cuff them, Brad sits up and pulls off the 
      blindfold, angry that the ceremony was interrupted.

                                  BRAD

                    Be calm, Brad.  And be patient with 
                    the ways of the Cowan.

                    Brad's been an apprentice in my

                    There's no crime in that.

                    We're all born witch.  We're all

                    out about this new direction in his

                    Brad's parents just really hate 
                    witches for some reason.  I mean 
                    like, more than most.  About a 
                    month ago, his mom threatened to

                    Brad came to me of his own free 
                    will.  He was drawn to Wicca.  
                      I couldn't turn him away.

                    He's at peace with it.  That's why 
                    we were conducting the cleansing 
                    ritual.  Brad knows the difference 
                    between the world of magic and the 
                    real world.  He understands I 
                    didn't kill his brother.

                    it's, it's disturbing and a little 
                      embarrassing to tell the truth.

                    You can cast spells?

                    spells.

                    I don't appreciate it.

      Cho walks away.  

                                  JANE
                    He really is a little freaked out 
                    by this witchcraft malarkey, isn't 
                    he?  

                                  LISBON
                    Uh, yes.

                    We're going to need to work a 
                    double shift on the stake-out

                                  LISBON
                    You want to tell me what's going on 
                    at least?

                                  JANE
                    Oh come on.  You're telling me you 
                    don't know what's going on?
                    You don't know who did it and why?

      Lisbon gives him a deadpan look.

                                  LISBON
                    No.  But you're going to tell me. 

      Jane smiles...

                                  JANE
                    How 'bout I show you?

      He walks off with Lisbon...

      car.  


      Jane has the mike, and is enjoying himself.

      The monkey wrench, lies on the table.  Jane and Lisbon talk 
      with Michael...

                                  JANE 
                    Amazing, isn't it?  The murder 
                    weapon revealed.  Tamzin's spells 
                    really work.  She really is a witch 
                    I guess.

                                    MICHAEL
                    I don't know what you're talking 
                    about.

                                  LISBON 
                    I'm sure the forensics will confirm 
                    your son's blood and tissue on one 
                    end of that wrench.  Your 
                      fingerprints on the other.

                                    MICHAEL
                    I have no knowledge of that.

                                  LISBON
                    Why else would you be trying to 
                    hide it?  Tell us what happened, 
                    Michael.  Maybe there were 
                      circumstances.  Maybe you had to 
                    defend yourself.

                                    MICHAEL
                    I don't have to explain anything.

                    emergency room?  Their broken 
                    bones?

                                    MICHAEL
                    Just clumsy, I guess.  A little 
                    dense at times.

                                  JANE
                    Good thing they had you to keep 
                    them in line, eh?  Some people 
                    don't understand how lucky they 
                    have it.

                                    MICHAEL
                    That's right.

      Michael nods in agreement, until he looks up to find Jane 
      looking back at him with malice.   

      (Jane not only sees a murderer, but a man who is lucky enough 
      to have his family, yet chose to betray them.)

                                  JANE
                      I realized it was you when Brad 
                    said he liked going to Tamzin's 
                    house, because he felt safe there.  
                    Safe.  Who feels safer at a witch's 
                    house than they do at home?
                          (beat)
                    You've been beating and abusing 
                    your wife and sons for years, 
                    haven't you?

                                    MICHAEL
                    No.

                                  JANE
                    Cody finally stood up to you, 
                    didn't he?  What was it that 
                    finally set him off?
                          (beat)
                    My guess, you started smacking Brad 
                    around a little too much.  Cody 
                    wanted to protect his brother.   
                    Was that it?

                                    MICHAEL
                    No.

                                  JANE
                    No, he says.  Your wife and son are

      FLASHBACK


      MOS Michael's pushing his son in the chest, haranguing him 
      about something.  Cody takes it and takes it, then pushes 
      back.  Michael is enraged.  A spittle flecked red-faced scary 
      rage.  But Cody is mad too. 

                                  JANE (V.O.)
                    And you could not hear that.  Could 
                    not hear that.

      Cody picks up a monkey wrench off the shelf.  Mistake.  
      Michael's anger finds another gear.  He snatches the wrench 
      from his son, and smashes him upside the head with it.  
      Several times.

      END FLASHBACK


      Long beat... 

                                    MICHAEL
                    He tried to hit me.  I was 
                    defending myself.

      Jane stands abruptly.  Got the confession they need.

                                  JANE
                    Goodbye, Michael.

      He exits.  Lisbon takes a beat, pulls her seat closer to 
      Michael...


      Jane walks down the hallway, passing the spartan ROOM where 
      Janice and Brad are, well, waiting.  




                                                                            (CONTINUED)      THE MENTALIST        "Red Rum"        SALMON 11/12/08        50.

      He passes the room quickly, deliberately avoiding their gaze; 
      walks a bit further and stops.  Thinks.  Dammit.  He goes 
      back to the    waiting room, enters.  


      We see through the window as Jane closes the door behind him.  
      Sits with an anxious Janice and Brad.  We're unable to hear 
      what Jane says, but we know we're watching him tell them what 
      really happened to Cody.  

      As Jane rests his hand on Janice's knee, she deflates.  Tears 
      flow, yes, of sadness, heartbreak, what she always feared 
      could happen.  But amidst the horror, Janice grabs Brad's 
      hand, and we sense the slightest glimmer of relief, the two 
      knowing that all these years of terror and anguish have 
      finally come to an end...

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


      A little pillar of smoke rises from a ball of newspaper 
      burning in a saucer.  Jane waiting for it to burn up 
      completely.  Van Pelt enters.

                                  VAN PELT 
                    What are you doing?

                                  JANE
                    A small favor for Cho. 

      Jane pushes the ash into a jelly jar, puts on the lid.


      Cho at his desk.  Jane comes up, gives him the jelly jar.

                                  JANE
                          (casually)
                    Tamzin Dove told me to give this to 
                    you.  She said to keep it in a safe 
                    place.

      Jane moves on.  Cho is mightily relieved to have possession 
      of the ashes, and clutches the jar to his bosom as if it were 
      a precious living thing. 

                                                                          FADE OUT.
