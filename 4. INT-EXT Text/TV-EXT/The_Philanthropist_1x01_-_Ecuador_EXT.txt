      Pristine, verdant, untouched by Man.  Tall trees fill an
      azure sky, deep moss covers the ground.  The HUM and BUZZ of
      insects and animals; the CAW of a green ibis.

      The face of TEDDY RIST appears, as he snaps apart two yellow
      stalks.  He's running toward the CAMERA, wearing a Balenciaga
      shirt and a pair of Rogan jeans, both are soiled and torn. 
      Over his shoulder, a bulging backpack, bearing the logo of
      Maidstone-Rist Resources.

      Oddly, he is shoeless; his feet are muddy and bleeding.

                                      TEDDY (v.o.)
                    There's a moment in time when a man
                    must ponder the meaning of life.

      A BULLET WHIZZES past TEDDY's head.

                                      TEDDY (v.o., cont.)
                    But the rest of the time, he's just
                    gotta keep running.

      MORE BULLETS.  TEDDY, a portrait of steely determination, is
      unfazed by the GUNFIRE: he isn't running away from the danger
      but toward something else. 

                                      FEMALE VOICE (v.o.)

                    Tuvalu, nine tiny islands in the
                    middle of the Pacific.  Usually, the
                    place is a Paradise, but on this
                      particular morning, it was Satan's
                    butthole.


      Rain, wind.  The flood has reached the second floor balcony,
      where TEDDY stands, fully dressed, talking on phone; he is
      among a large crush of HOTEL GUESTS being loaded onto a
      lifeboat, which is already at capacity.  HOTEL MANAGER helps
      the POLYNESIAN WOMAN, in Teddy's clothes, get into the boat.  

                                      TEDDY
                    Yes, they're taking us to higher
                    ground, but, Maxine, I want off the
                    island, pronto.  I can't reach Dax
                    at the Gulfstream, a cop says the
                    airport's washed away --

      A glorious sun is setting, as the plane sails east into
      darkness.

                    I have an amazing talent to shove
                    what is painful back into the furthest
                    reaches of my memory.

      Overlooking Central Park.  TEDDY sits at a small, round table,
      with the spinning top, as MORGANA RIST serves lunch.  MORGANA --
        thirty-five, raven-haired, sensuous lips -- was once a
      stripper and, until recently, Teddy's wife.

                                      TEDDY (cont.)
                    Made in China.  These are probably

                    Time to eat, Teddy, put the toy away. 

      He stops the top from spinning, looks at his plate.

                                      TEDDY
                    Bucatini Alla Savini, my favorite.

      She hands him bottle of Moscato di Chambave.  He starts to
      uncork the bottle.

                                      MORGANA
                    Is this why you invited yourself to
                    lunch?  Today's to do list: "Get the
                    ex-wife a job" --

                                      TEDDY
                    No... I... I just hate to think of
                    you up here all day every day and
                    night -- with nothing to do --
                          (pops cork, pours)

                                      MORGANA
                    Ah, so you don't want me to find a
                    job, you want me to get a hobby.

                                      TEDDY
                      A purpose.  To fill the void.

      CONTINUED:

      The sad silence of shared loss descends.  Neither speak for
      a long beat.

                                      MORGANA
                    DeWitt Burton left word for me today.
                          (off TEDDY)
                    I haven't called him back.

                                      TEDDY
                    Don't.

      Another beat.  MORGANA looks at her food.

                                      MORGANA
                    I forgot the Parmesan.

      She enters the apartment.  He sips the wine.  On TEDDY,
      staring out at the city, then picking up the metal top,

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      The land of private jets.  The Lexus pulls up to a spanking
      new Gulfstream G550.  DAX, TEDDY, KYLE and SIPE step out.

                                      TEDDY
                    Dax, get ready to rocket.

                                    DAX
                          (sotto voce)
                    Do you want me to bring a weapon?
                          (off TEDDY)
                    Y'never know...

      TEDDY nods.  DAX goes into plane.  TEDDY looks at SIPE and
      KYLE, then decides: 

                                      TEDDY
                    Sipe, get on board.

      KYLE steps back, disappointed.

                                      TEDDY (cont.)
                    Kyle, stay on top of the Brazilian
                    perfume deal.  

      As TEDDY and SIPE walk up ramp, she asks, a little cocky:

                                    SIPE
                    Teddy, tell me -- why'd you pick me
                    over Kyle?

                                      TEDDY
                    He has a three month old.

      As SIPE's cockiness evaporates, replaced by fear,

                                                                                  CUT TO:

                    Me, too.  Why would you fly into an
                    active earthquake?

      GOVERNMENT GREETER and two SOLDIERS approach, as the door
      flips open.

                                      TEDDY (v.o.)
                    No, the quake was over. 

      TEDDY walks down steps, Red Scarlet digital camera filming
      everything in sight, followed by SIPE and DAX.

                                      TEDDY (v.o., cont.)
                    I went because I'm Teddy Rist.

      GREETER bows obsequiously.  TEDDY, DAX and SIPE hand over
      their passports.

                    Citizen of the world.  

      DAX stays with the jet, as the OTHERS exit into:


      Limousine moves slowly along the congested street, which is
      packed with TRUCKS, CARS and WORKERS, mostly poor, going
      about their day-to-day routine.

                                      TEDDY
                    We made our way through the streets
                    of the capital, which was relatively
                      unaffected by the quake.

      A military jeep follows the limo.


      TEDDY faces HEALTH MINISTER, as SIPE stands with CADDY.

                                      TEDDY
                    In gratitude for your hospitality, I
                    have written a check to your favorite
                    charity.
                          (holds up an envelope)

                                      HEALTH MINISTER
                    How do you know my favorite charity?

                                      TEDDY
                    I don't.  Which is why I made out
                    the check to "cash" --

      HEALTH MINISTER grins greedily.  TEDDY hands him the envelope. 
      HEALTH MINISTER looks at the amount.

                                      HEALTH MINISTER
                    Oh, extremely generous.  My wife

                    'Course.  Now, I wonder if you can
                    do me un favorito.

                                      HEALTH MINISTER
                    Anything.

                    There is a case of vaccine at the

                    they are safe.  The vaccine in

      FADE IN:


      The Maidstone mansion.  


      A limo, with tiny American flags, pulls up to the entrance. 

                                      TEDDY (v.o.)
                    Philip called Ambassador Korman, who
                    sent one of his drones to bail me
                    out.  All charges were dropped.

      DOORMAN opens door.  TEDDY, ALICIA and SIPE emerge.

                                    SIPE
                    What's next on your schedule?

                    One night.

                    Dawn's in a few hours.

                    During a crisis like this, do you
                    know how many people can die in a
                    few hours?

                                      TEDDY
                    But the vaccine --

                                      ALICIA
                    I no longer feel I will ever get the
                    vaccine.

                          (a dubious laugh)
                    Living in America, I learned Yanquis
                    are attention deficient.  You give
                    up when the going gets too tough.

                    That's not true.  At least not me. 
                    I'll deliver the vaccine tomorrow.

                    Goodbye Teddy, Sipe, have a safe
                    trip home.

      She heads to her jeep.  TEDDY turns to SIPE.

                    She doesn't believe me.

                    Maybe she knows the landscape a little
                    better than us.

      SIPE reacts: TEDDY has boomeranged back to business.  He
      never behaves the way she expects.  She goes. 

      TEDDY looks across the street, sees a homeless FAMILY -- a
      father, mother, three small children -- huddled together.

                                      TEDDY (v.o., cont.)
                      Everywhere, there was more heartache.

      He stares at his fancy hotel, then, crosses to the FATHER.

                    So, you do what you can do, right?

      TEDDY points to hotel, the MAN nods enthusiastically.

      CEURO Y CAICEDO, twenty-two, handsome and lethal, stands

                    I first saw your picture on the cover
                    of Generaci n XXI when I was fourteen
                    years old.  I wanted to be you more

                    My guess is -- given your line of
                    work -- you have, on occasion, had
                    items brought into this country
                      illegally.

                                      CUERO
                    For the sake of discussion, yes,

                    don't you understand?

      He hits TEDDY again, knocking him face down into the dirt. 
      DEA AGENT puts his foot on the back of TEDDY's neck.  A second
      AGENT holds up a brick of coke from the copter, while a THIRD
      hands COMMANDER Teddy's passport, which he opens, recognizes
      the name.  He signals TEDDY to rise and step forward.

                                    DEA COMMANDER
                    You have five seconds to explain
                    what's going on.

                    May I?

      DEA COMMANDER nods.  TEDDY takes out business card.

                                      TEDDY (cont.)
                    Call me.  That's my private number. 
                    By that, I mean, you only have to go
                    through one secretary. 

      DEA COMMANDER contemplates the situation, then hands TEDDY
      the backpack.  

                                    DEA COMMANDER
                    Next time you bum a ride, Mister
                    Rist, be a little more choosy.

                                      TEDDY
                    Call me Teddy... Commander, are you
                    headed toward Puerto Napo?

                                    DEA AGENT
                    Sorry, we're taking this scumball
                    back to Quito.

                                      TEDDY
                    How far is Puerto Napo from here?

                                    DEA COMMANDER
                      Fifty-three miles. 

                                      TEDDY
                    Geez.
                          (still negotiating)
                    How'bout if, while you're piloting
                    the Gulfstream -- ?

                                    DEA COMMANDER
                    Don't push your luck, sir.  

      Resigned, TEDDY reaches into backpack, takes out his SAT
      phone, turns on the GPS mode.  Full color map of area appears. 
      TEDDY slings the backpack over his shoulder, starts to walk
      off.  He hears the "Shaddup" DEA AGENT laughing, crosses to
      the AGENT, whose back is to him.


                                                                (CONTINUED)      "The Philanthropist"                                     50.

      DEA AGENT turns.  TEDDY swings and connects with the guy's
      jaw.  HEAR teeth cracking.  The AGENT drops, out for the
      count.  As TEDDY hoofs it down a desolate road,

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                            ACT FIVE

      FADE IN:


      The middle of nowhere.  TEDDY's been walking a long, long
      time.  There's a farmhouse, which he approaches, yells:

                                      TEDDY
                     Hola?

      He sees a 1965 Triumph Bonneville, beaten-to-shit, by the
      side of the house.  He crosses to the motorcycle, admiring
      the craftsmanship, wondering if it works.  HEAR a GUN cock. 
      TEDDY turns to see a NATIVE MAN, holding a rifle on him.

                                      TEDDY (cont.)
                    Man, this is not my day.
                          (puts up his hands)
                    Necesito agua.

      NATIVE MAN studies him, cautiously.

                                      TEDDY (cont.)
                    Voy a Puerto Napo con vacuna para 
                    los ni os.

      He indicates backpack.  NATIVE MAN slowly lowers gun.

                                      NATIVE MAN
                     Usted anda a Puerto Napo?

                                      TEDDY
                      Desgraciadamente, s .  Unless.
                          (points to Triumph)
                     Sirve, esto?  

      NATIVE MAN nods.

                                      TEDDY (cont.)
                     Me Los prestas?   

      NATIVE MAN nods. 

      CELL PHONE RINGS.  TEDDY digs it out of backpack.

                                      TEDDY (cont.)
                     Hola?

      INTERCUT WITH:


      OLIVIA, on phone.

                    Teddy, we need to talk --

                                      TEDDY
                    Not a good time.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Come home.  Immediately.

                                      TEDDY
                    You, the Queen of Giving, is telling
                    me to walk away?

                                      OLIVIA
                    I've learned one thing running the
                      foundation.  You can't save everyone.

                                      TEDDY
                    "If you only save one life, you still
                    have saved one life" --

                                      OLIVIA
                    Philip needs you here.

      The NATIVE MAN points to phone and then to his own chest.

                                      TEDDY
                    Give you this?  Gladly.

      TEDDY shuts cell, hanging up on OLIVIA.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Hello?

      TEDDY hands over cell, goes to motorcycle.  NATIVE MAN raises
      rifle, threatening.

                                      TEDDY
                    Oh, come on, dude.

                                      NATIVE MAN
                          (re: cell)
                    Esto no es suficiente.

                                      TEDDY
                     Qu  m s quieres? 

      NATIVE MAN points to Teddy's digital camera.

                                      TEDDY (cont.)
                    Not the camera.  Ninguna manera.

      TEDDY thinks for a beat, then indicates his watch.  NATIVE
      MAN shakes head no, shows TEDDY that he already has one. 
      NATIVE MAN stares up and down at TEDDY, then smiles.  He
      points to Teddy's La Sportiva hiking boots.

                    mano against DeWitt Burton.

      TEDDY starts to untie the laces.  As the PHONE RINGS in the
      NATIVE MAN's hand, delighting him,

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      SONG CONTINUES.  On a dirt path, TEDDY rides the Triumph --
      it's a great bike and the scenery is spectacular.  He's
      enjoying himself.

      CONTINUED:

      A REBEL, dressed in camouflage clothes, spies him, raises
      gun and FIRES repeatedly.  A BULLET hits the back tire of
      the Triumph.  The bike jerks upwards and, despite TEDDY's
      expert efforts, he drops the bike on the road.  As he falls,
      he tries to protect the backpack containing the precious
      vaccine.  He hits the ground hard. 

      He shakes off the road burn and gets up.  More GUNFIRE.  As
      TEDDY runs, shoeless, off the path, into unchartered parts
      of the rainforest, ducking the flying BULLETS, 

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      SONG CONTINUES.  TEDDY runs, he seems to have put some
      distance between him and the rebels.  He stops, breathes,
      checks his feet which are muddy and bleeding.  He sits on a
      mossy log, does not see a snake -- crawling nearby slowly on
      its belly -- until too late.  It snaps and bites his ankle. 
      Owww.  TEDDY curses, in pain, then stands and rubs the wound. 
      As the snake sneaks away,

                                                                          CUT BACK TO:


      SONG FADES.  TEDDY walking, slowly, sweating, the venom
      kicking in.  He starts to hallucinate, thinks he sees his
      dead SON (We don't).

                                      TEDDY
                    Bobby?  Don't run away, Bobby.  Come
                    to Daddy.  No, don't go. 

      He takes off after the phantom.

      He runs and runs -- it's almost as if his SON is leading him
      to safety, leading him to:


                                                                (CONTINUED)      "The Philanthropist"                                     57.

      A clearing.  TEDDY sees the village of Puerto Napo.  He stops,
      breathing deeply, sweating profusely.

      His legs give out.  As TEDDY collapses,
