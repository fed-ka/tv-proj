      Jess gets out of the cab, and a soccer ball rolls over to 
      her. She kicks it back to TWO BOYS playing...

                                  JESS (V.O.)
                    And she s like:  Oh my god, what s 
                    that sound? I better go downstairs 
                    in the dark while only wearing my 
                      underwear...  And you re like, 
                     What is your problem? Call the 
                    police!  

      The boys just stare. Her coat has fallen open. She doesn t 
      realize it- just smiles and waves. She runs up the steps of a 
      brownstone.



      Nick sits across from CAROLINE, his ex-girlfriend. 

                                  CAROLINE
                    Nick.

                                  NICK
                    Caroline. Just so you know- I am 
                    totally over you. 

                                  CAROLINE
                    Good. Does that mean you re going 
                    to stop prank calling me?

                                  NICK
                    What? That s crazy.

                                  CAROLINE
                          (cockney)
                     Ello Caroline- Oi still love you.
                          (then)
                    So what is this about? The party?

                                  NICK
                    No... But if you could get us in-

                                  CAROLINE
                    No.  

                                  NICK
                    Okay. Fine. I should probably...  
                          (this hurts to say)
                    Why did you dump me? 

                                  CAROLINE
                    Nick. Are you actually having a 
                    feeling that you re not making a 
                    joke about?

                                  NICK
                    Can you just- just tell me.                                                                                    26.


                                  CAROLINE
                    Because. When I met you, you wanted 
                    to change the world. And you were 
                    crazy and fun and trying to figure 
                    it out. And then your parents told 
                    you to go to law school. And you 
                    just gave up. You stopped caring 
                    about everything. Including me.   

                                  NICK
                          (after a beat)
                    Oh. That s it? That s not bad. I 
                    thought you were sleeping with 
                    someone else.

                                  CAROLINE
                    Nick. I m glad you called.

                                  NICK
                          (cockney)
                     Oim glad,  oney.

                                  CAROLINE
                          (smiling)
                    Fine. You re on the list. 

      Suddenly REVEAL Schmidt at the next table who had been hiding 
      behind a Village Voice. He stands up, pumping his fists.

                                  CAROLINE (CONT D)
                    Has he been there the whole time? 
                    Of course he has.

                                    SCHMIDT
                    Caroline. I ve missed hearing you 
                    guys have sex. It was like hearing 
                    dolphins playing with a ball. 



      Nick and Schmidt wear cool versions of Western gear waiting 
      in line to go to the party. Mandy (with a band-aid on her 
      face) and the girls from Schmidt s work walk by, laughing and 
      pointing at Coach, who wears his JORTS, NO SHIRT, AND A 
      FEATHER IN HIS BASEBALL HAT. 

                                  GIRL
                    Creepy Indian!

                                  COACH
                    Yeah!

      The girls high-five him.

                                  COACH (CONT D)
                    Can I tell you guys something? 

                                  NICK/SCHMIDT 
                    No/Please don t.

                                  COACH
                    My balls feel amazing. It s like 
                    the end of  Pretty Woman . It s 
                    like my balls are living the fairy 
                    tale.

                                    SCHMIDT
                    Take off the pants, Coach. You look 
                    like you just walked out of an 
                    Asian YouTube Video. 

                                  COACH
                    No. This is me, Schmidt. I m fat. I 
                    use calamine lotion for weird 
                    stuff. I wear jeggings. And when 
                    you make fun of me, it makes me 
                    feel bad. 

                                    SCHMIDT
                    Oh god, are we all talking about 
                    our feelings now? Because I m not.

      Suddenly, Benjamin, the intern walks up with his friend Peter- 
      Jess  Date. 

                                  BENJAMIN
                    Hey, guys. What s up?
                          (to Coach)
                    Are those spanx?

                                  COACH
                    Jorts.                                                                                    32.


                                  NICK
                    Wait, where s Jess?  

                                  PETER
                          (shrugs)
                    Not happening. She texted me seven 
                    times today.  

                                    SCHMIDT
                    What?

                                  PETER
                    Yeah. Like long ones. I just want 
                    to hook up. 

                                  NICK
                    Wait, so she s just waiting for you 
                    to show up? Did you call her?

                                  PETER
                    Uhhh. 

      Nick looks at Schmidt, pointedly.

                                    SCHMIDT
                    No. No. I m not going. Coach and I 
                    are staying- 

                                  COACH
                    I m going with Nick. 

                                    SCHMIDT
                    Fine-

                                  NICK
                    Fine.

      Nick ducks under the rope. Coach follows, and starts running 
      down the street. 

                                  COACH
                    Jess! We re coming, Jess!

      JUMP CUT:

      Coach and Nick are still running down the street.

                                  COACH (CONT D)
                          (high-pitched)
                    Why are we running?

                                  NICK
                    I have no idea.                                                                                    33.


      A yellow cab pulls up. Schmidt s in the back. 

                                    SCHMIDT
                    Get in. I don t want to talk about 
                    it. 

                                  COACH
                    Oh god, thank you. Thank you. 

      Nick nods at Schmidt as they all pile into the cab.
