The wind rustles the endless field of corn, blows over the
freshly mown meadow of soybeans, and magically sways a copse of
trees.
It's a Fall after-noon. A SUDDEN POUNDING OF GALLOPING HOOVES
breaks the peace and... A HORSE and RIDER burst between the rows
of corn into the meadow.
They are running for their lives.
CLOSE ON:
The rider is a bride -- a beautiful woman dressed in a
disheveled wedding gown, it's train tattered and flying like a
knight's banner out behind her. This is MAGGIE CARPENTER.
The horse is frothing and wild-eyed, like the bride, who turns
to look behind her in terror.
The horse's labored breathing
mingles with Maggie's panicked gasps.
We see a WEDDING BOUQUET fly into a ditch as the horse thunders
on.
Maggie clings to the reins.
She looks as though she is
running from the devil himself.
FADE TO BLACK
Establishing.
CUT TO:
IKE (V.O.)
Hey, Fisher, pick up.
I have some
column ideas I want to bounce off you.
Not there?
Okay.
Listen I'm thinking
of writing about those mind-numbing
informercials that are always on.
Ike walks out of his apartment building talking on cell phone.
IKE (cont'd)
What do you think?
Good idea, right?
Boring, down to death, pointless -- It
sucks.
Ike yells at a CONSTRUCTION WORKER.
IKE (cont'd)
If you guys are here any longer,
they're gonna make you sign a lease.
CONSTRUCTION WORKER
Your column should be so funny.
Ike turns and walks down the street, talking into cell phone.
IKE
Okay, I was also thinking I might write
about...
He spots a RICH LADY with tons of diamonds getting out of a
Limousine, talking to a CHAUFFEUR.
He goes up to her.
IKE (cont'd)
Excuse me.
I was thinking of doing an
article on limousines.
What would you
say to people who never had a chance to
drive in a limo?
They walk up to her DOORMAN.
LADY
I'm sorry, I don't know any people like
that.
Ike walks off.
They stare at him as he goes.
Ike's talking on the phone to his friend's machine again.
IKE
(into phone)
Fisher?
Come on -- I know you're
sitting there laughing at me.
Pick up.
I want to run an idea past you.
Ike continues walking now in the full panic of writer's block.
He pleads into his friend's answering machine as he walks.
IKE (cont'd)
(into phone)
I just could use someone to toss it
back and forth with for a few minutes,
get the juice flowing, help me.
I have
an hour and twenty-seven minutes and
fifty-two seconds.
Hello?
He walks away from the t-shirt table towards the bar.
The
Vendor calls out to him.
T-SHIRT VENDOR
Hey, Ike, when are you going to put me
in an article?
IKE
When your t-shirts stop shrinking.
Ike enters the bar.
The Woman drops the shirt she was holding
and walks off with her children.
The T-shirt Vendor goes back
to selling his shirts.
FISHER walks through the main office reading the paper.
FISHER
"But how can one blame me when every
time I step out my front door I meet
fresh proof that the female archetypes
are alive and well?
Te mother, the
virgin, the whore, the crone; they're
elbowing you in the subway, stealing
your cabs, and overwhelming you with
perfume in elevators."
WORKERS read the above article.
PEGGY and MRS. PRESSMAN exit the parlor and stroll down the
street. (lowers her paper and reads.)
PEGGY (cont'd)
"... And in Hale, Maryland where she
helps run the family hardware store."
(to the Women)
We have to go to Maggie.
Cindy, mind
the shop.
(exits salon;
continues reading)
"... She is known as Miss Maggie
Carpenter, AKA, the Runaway Bride."
MRS. PRESSMAN
Holy moly.
The older one, Mrs. Pressman, listens with a pained expression
as the younger one, Peggy, continues to read the column aloud.
Neither one can believe what they're reading.
PEGGY
(reads)
"What is unusual about Miss Carpenter
is that she likes to dress her men up
as grooms before she devours them.
She
has already disemboweled six in a row
by leaving them at the altar."... I
can't ready anymore.
MRS. PRESSMAN
(takes paper from
her, reads)
"And her ritual feast continues as she
prepares to make a sacrifice out of the
seventh fiance.
So all bets are on and
we hope that this boomerang bride isn't
honeymooning with Las Vegas odds makers
because many predict that this girl is
out of there before the race... before
the rice hits the ground"
(then)
Holy moly.
Peggy and Mrs. Pressman step into a hardware store.
As Maggie's VOICE-OVER continues to read her letter, we take in
a Manhattan busy day.
It is big, loud, and anonymous.
MAGGIE (V.O.; cont'd)
"Greeting from the sticks!
Perhaps you
believe that a rural education is
focused mainly on hog calling and
tractor maintenance rather than reading.
Why else would you print a piece of
fiction about me and call it fact?"
Te CAMERA FINDS Ike, striding across a busy street, dodging
taxies.
A WOMAN smacks him with a newspaper.
He passes a WOMAN
TRAFFIC OFFICER, then a hot dog stand.
He greets and passes a
FALAFEL VENDOR.
THE CAMERA PANS to a USA Today Truck.
MAGGIE (V.O.; cont'd)
"I suppose Mr. Graham was too busy
thinking us slanderous statements about
how I dump men for kicks to bother with
something silly like accuracy in
reporting.
Which is understandable,
because with a "man-eater" like me on
the loose, who has time to check facts?"
He passes regular GUYS who cheer him.
MAGGIE (V.O.; cont'd)
"Still, we cannibalistic queens can get
pretty cranky when we see things in
print that hurt our feelings, like that
we deliberately abandon fiances with
malice aforethought."
Ike rides sadly on the back of a forklift, gets off and walks
out.
ANGLE ON MAGGIE'S HOUSE:
A train goes by.
A modest clapboard house with a porch.
Two
entrances.
A PAPERBOY tosses a paper onto the lawn in front of
the house.
The front door opens and Maggie appears fresh out of
bed, wearing only a jacket and panties.
Heedless of being seen
this way, she scampers out to the sidewalk to pick up her
delivered paper:
USA Today.
She tears off the plastic bag and
rips into it, looking for her letter.
She finds it.
A smile on
her face, then she scampers back into the house.
We see Ike driving down the highway.
The car sputters a little
as he and Fisher continue their conversation in voice-over. (If
needed by the editor.)
FISHER (V.O.)
Don't say "spec" like it's a dirty word.
Nobody ever paid Shakespeare to write a
play!
Plato never got a book advance...
IKE (V.O.)
Oh yeah!
I happen to know from
reliable sources that Nietzche got
expenses and a rental car.
We hear Fisher laugh.
IKE (V.O.; cont'd)
I'm going to make this work, Fish.
I'm
going to do it!
Ike's car drives into Hale, passing a billboard reading,
"Welcome to Hale."
CUT TO:
Ike drives down picturesque Main Street.
He passes Hale
Hardware.
Sign says: "At Curl.
Be back soon."
A BARBERSHOP QUARTET is singing in front of the only hotel in
town.
Ike pulls up and goes inside.
Ike exits his hotel as the Barber Shop Quartet finishes singing
"Camptown Races."
He now walks down the charming main artery of the town, looking
exactly like what he is:
a cynical New York out of his element
on sunny Main Street, USA.
KIDS ride by on bikes, streaming
balloons behind them.
A balloon hits Ike on the face.
As he
crosses the street, he mutters into his tape recorder:
IKE
I think I'm in Maryberry.
Flags hang on all the storefronts and the place sparkles with
wholesome attitudes as PEOPLE greet each other familiarly.
Ike
comes to beauty parlor called "Curl Up and Dye".
The place is
doing business and crowded with WOMEN.
In front of beauty salon, Maggie follows Ike out.
MAGGIE
If you're looking for Elm Street, it's
that way.
She puts on her sunglasses.
IKE
Thank you.
He walks the other way.
MAGGIE
If you came down here in the pursuit of
happiness, you might as well go back.
Because you can't make me feel bad.
She stops walking and turns to Ike.
IKE
I'm not here to make you feel bad.
I'm
here for vindication.
In my heart...
MAGGIE
You have one?
Ike walks back to Maggie.
IKE
I feel I'm right about you.
You got me
fired, lady.
You destroyed my
reputation and you screwed up my hair.
You chew men up, spit them out and
loved it.
And I'm down here to satisfy
myself on that point.
PASSERSBY stare at Ike's hair and giggle.
MAGGIE
Did something happen to make you care
about reality?
IKE
Yes.
Conviction.
Conviction that I'm
onto the truth.
You're going to do the
same thing to "poor bastard number four"
that you did to the last three.
You're
going to run again.
And I'm not
leaving until you do.
MAGGIE
You're going to be very disappointed.
IKE
We'll see.
MAGGIE
I'd love to stay and chat, but I've got
to get back to work.
I still have my
job.
He stares at her for a beat, stung by her words.
MAGGIE
I have nothing to hide, Mr. Graham.
Talk to whoever you want.
You might
actually stumble upon a fact or two.
Maggie walks away.
Ike walks a few steps and stops at a KID on
a bike.
IKE
Hey, kid, I'll give you ten bucks for
your hat.
Kid agrees.
Ike puts the hat on and starts to cross the street.
An OLD WOMAN walks by and hits him with a newspaper.
Ike is
stunned.
Maggie pulls into the driveway in her truck.
She's in a fine
mood as she walks right in the house.
Establishing.
High angle wide shot of a bakery in Hale.
Ike
exits a neighboring shop and walks down the block.
He pauses in
front of the bakery to take a look at Maggie's truck.
As he
does, a middle-aged Black WOMAN walks by and whacks him with a
newspaper.
Ike is stunned as she walks off.
He turns to a MAN
sitting on a bench.
IKE
Did you see that?
CUT TO:
Various High School SPORTS TEAMS practice.
Maggie strides across
the football field, a scowl on her face.
A few HIGH SCHOOL
FOOTBALL PLAYERS job past Maggie, doing laps.
A boy, KENDALL,
calls out to her affectionately as she passes.
One of them,
DENNIS, slows his pace to run alongside Maggie.
DENNIS
(playful)
Maggie, don't marry Coach!
Marry me.
I love you.
MAGGIE
You're jail bait, Dennis.
Go away.
Run your laps.
Go. Go.
Dennis runs on as Maggie continues toward her goal: Bob and Ike,
standing together on the other side of the field.
ANGLE ON BOB AND IKE
They're both standing on the blocking sled.
Wave after wave of
VARSITY FOOTBALL PLAYERS ram into the sled and drive it across
the field with both Ike and Bob on top of it.
Ike is munching on
one of the cinnamon rolls as Bob pushes the KIDS.
BOB
Drive!
Drive!
From your hips, get low,
get low, get low.
Next!
Ike smiles broadly atop of the sled as he sees Maggie
approaching, looking mighty peeved.
He nudges Bob and points to
Maggie.
Bob lights up at the sight of her.
BOB (cont'd)
Good job, gentlemen... Special teams.
The football players move away from the sled.
Bob moves to
Maggie, leaves Ike alone.
BOB (cont'd)
(to Maggie)
Hey, honey!
Bob kisses and embraces Maggie.
She doesn't see Ike immediately,
then:
MAGGIE
(indicating Ike)
What is he up to now?
BOB
Ike just came by to check out the team.
IKE
And talk about you.
Ike grins and shows Maggie the notes in his pocket.
MAGGIE
Bob -- are you making friends with this
man?
BOB
I'm just bragging about how great you
are.
I'm the luckiest man alive.
Bob grabs Maggie around the waist and smooches her adoringly.
Maggie scowls at Ike.
He nods, all charm.
IKE
Well -- I've got to get moving -- lot
of work to do today!
I'll see you two
love-birds later.
Ike leaves.
Bob calls after him.
BOB
See you at the wedding.
IKE
You bet ya, Coach.
Maggie is aghast.
She stares at Bob.
Ike joins in behind a line
of peppy cheerleaders.
MAGGIE
At the wedding?
You invite him?
Bob,
don't you realize he's writing another
article about me?
BOB
Sure I do.
But the bet defense is a
good offense, right?
You're not going
to let your opponent throw you off
your game.
MAGGIE
You don't understand this guy.
BOB
Let him come to the wedding.
You're
not running, right?
Say it. "I'm
not..."
MAGGIE
(irritably)
I'm not running.
BOB
So if you're not running and Ike Graham
is there to see it, then any article he
writes has got to have a happy ending,
right?
All we're doing is turning
lemon into lemonade.
MAGGIE
I've got news for you.
No amount of
sugar and water is going to turn like
Graham into something you want to take
on a picnic.
Bob gives Maggie a big hug.
BOB
Where's that homemade sunshine?
Bob blows his whistle, then puts Maggie on the football sled.
BOB (cont'd)
I want you boys to take my princess on
the ride of her life... Honey, tell 'em
where you parked your car.
Maggie screams as the boys push her down the football field.
Maggie drives up to an old brick firehouse that is now an auto
garage.
The faded sign reads: "Gill's Garage".
As Maggie drives into town with Peggy, they see Ike on porch with
SHERIFF, POLICE CHIEF and MAIL
MAN, all playing instruments as
a blues band.
Ike is not bad on slide guitar.
They all like
Ike.
Maggie "CHUFFAS" with Peggy and moves on.
CLOSE ON:
The slow, loopy pitch of a softball.
A bat connects.
NEW ANGLE:
A big wholesome man, CORY, runs for first base.
He just beats
out the throw.
Bob, acting as umpire, yells, "Safe!"
Happy,
Cory turns to the stands and waves.
ANGLE ON:
Maggie and Peggy, cheering loudly.
Peggy tries to whoop harder
than Maggie, but that would be tough.
From firs base, Cory waves
back to them.
The two women sit back down and Maggie takes back
up with their conversation.
Maggie is still al steamed up.
MAGGIE
Okay, he's on base.
Can we talk about
my life now?
-- Ike's going to turn
that tattoo stuff into a big deal --
that I was never serious about Gill,
blah blah.
He's totally out to get me.
PEGGY
For what reason?
Some personal
satisfaction?
MAGGIE
That's what he says, but if he thinks
that I don't realize he's writing
another article, then he's an idiot.
PEGGY
It's probably because you got him fired.
MAGGIE
(sarcastic)
Ya think?
PEGGY
Not that he doesn't deserve to get
fired... Look!
Cory's going for
second!... Sneaky!
ANGLE ON:
Cory as he runs for second base and with a slide beats the throw
for the force out.
The women jump and cheer -- Maggie, again,
the most boisterous.
ANGLE ON:
Dennis recognizes Ike as he walks up.
Dennis tells Ike that he
is going to marry Maggie some day and shows Ike where Maggie is
sitting.
ANGLE ON:
Maggie spots Ike as they sit back down.
She groans.
MAGGIE
There he is.
Snoop Doggy-Dogg.
PEGGY
Where?
MAGGIE
Over there.
Ten o'clock.
He's talking
to our little Dennis.
Dennis will turn
into one of those "sources say" things.
PEGGY
He looks better with that stuff out of
his hair.
He's an attractive man.
Ike finds Maggie in the crowd and leaves Dennis.
MAGGIE
I'd say you've been in the sun too long.
You handle him, okay?
I could use five
minutes off from that creep.
Before Peggy can protest, Maggie climbs down off the bleachers
and goes and stands near the dugout near the rest of Cory's team.
PEGGY
Okay, that's fine.
I can do that.
Ike comes up to Peggy.
IKE
Hello, Peggy Phleming, "not the ice-skater".
Ike indicates the seat next to Peggy.
PEGGY
(protesting weakly)
That's Maggie's seat...
Ike sits down comfortably.
IKE
... And this is Maggie's beer.
He starts drinking it.
ON THE FIELD, Cory is getting ready to
steal third.
IKE (cont'd)
That your
husband out there?
Cory
Phleming, a local radio announcer.
PEGGY
Have you listened to his morning show,
"Wake up with ballplayer"?
IKE
Not yet.
I had a phlemless morning.
I
hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.
PEGGY
This game is pretty important to him.
He made all-stars in high school, you
know.
IKE
That must have made you proud.
Peggy takes a small sip off her soda.
PEGGY
He was going with Maggie back then.
(quickly)
He was never one of her... I mean, they
were never going to get... They just
dated for a while.
Cory dives in for third and makes it.
The crowd goes wild.
Peggy yells and jumps in.
PEGGY (cont'd)
Good job, honey!
But Maggie's whoop sails out above it all.
Cory waves.
But not
at Peggy.
He directs his delight at Maggie, who jumps up and
down by the dugout.
Ike looks between Cory, Maggie and finally, Peggy.
Peggy jerks
her waving hand back down to her side and sits down.
Ike
pretends not to have noticed.
The two watch as Maggie and Cory
smile at each other.
IKE
It's nice that they're still friends.
PEGGY
(looking at Maggie
and Cory)
Oh, sure.
That was a long time ago.
See, she's not a man-hater at all.
She's very supportive of men...
Next BATTER hits one to deep left field and it lands in the grave
yard.
Cory scores, greeted by Maggie.
Ike and Peggy watch as
Cory and Maggie belly-bump and high-five each other in
celebration of Cory's play.
No looks at Peggy.
Ike keeps an
empathetic silence, seeing that Peggy is truly hurt.
PEGGY (cont'd)
I'll be back in a second.
Suddenly, Peggy stands, pushes past him and runs down the steps.
Maggie looks up just in time to catch Peggy's exit.
Ike pulls
his tape recorder out of his pocket and starts speaking into it.
Maggie shoots Ike an accusing look, walks up to him in the
bleachers and sits next to him.
MAGGIE
You've been here for three minutes.
What did you do to her?
IKE
You can turn that finger around.
Ike does an on-the-button imitation of Maggie jumping excitedly
at Cory.
Now Maggie sees what he's getting at.
MAGGIE
(defensive)
You misinterpret everything.
We've all
been friends our whole lives.
But
that's the types of relationship you
wouldn't understand.
IKE
Obviously, I'm not the only one who
doesn't understand it.
The USS Maggie
leaves quite a wake... Excuse me.
Ike walks away.
Alone, Maggie tries to seem enthused.
MAGGIE
See, I cheer good.
What is he, a cheer
critic?
Sitting in front of Inn Hale Bar, we see the BARTENDER
pantomiming holding the reins of a wildly galloping horse.
We've
seen something like this before.
Maggie's wild ride away from
her last wedding.
Ike laughs with Bartender just as Maggie
drives by the bar and sees this.
MAGGIE
(to herself)
This guy never stops.
IKE (cont'd)
That's breaking and entering.
I'll call
the sheriff.
MAGGIE
You do that.
And remind him he's
bringing the wine to the luau.
Thanks.
She disappears around the ledge of the building and runs off.
Ike's neighbor, Harvey, sits reading near his window.
CUT TO:
Establishing.
It's early morning.
Mrs. Pressman hands Peggy a cup of coffee
to go.
Peggy walks to the beauty parlor, unlocks the front door
and goes in.
Maggie exits her house, gets on her bike and rides off towards
town.
Ike jogs alongside of Maggie on her bike.
Maggie parks her bike
and they go inside her door to the house.
Ike and Maggie drive in Maggie's truck.
They pull up in front of
a Bridal Shop.
A spectacular dress fills the small window.
It's beautiful,
romantic, sexy.
Maggie and Ike can be seen in the reflection.
MAGGIE
Even with everything that's happened
I've still never been married and I
still deserve a beautiful dress.
IKE
Agreed.
Maggie gives Ike a smile that lights up the sky.
They go inside.
Ike approaches the window of the bar.
There's a DRUNK MAN and a
DOG sitting outside.
Inside, we see two figures from the back,
arms around each other.
One is definitely Maggie.
The other is
definitely not Bob.
MAGGIE
(coaxing)
C'mon.
Let's go.
As Maggie helps the man get up,
we see that it's Walter, Maggie's
father -- dead drunk.
WALTER
(belligerently)
I haven't had any fun since you got
your driver's license...
They stumble and lurch, exiting the bar toward Maggie's car.
MAGGIE
I'm not exactly having fun, either...
Steady.
WALTER
(to Dog)
Good boy, Port Hole.
MAGGIE
His name is Skipper, Dad... Steady.
WALTER
I changed it.
(then to Drunk)
See you later, Mr. Travis.
(then to Maggie)
That guy has a problem... Maggie, you
can run everyone's life but your own.
Maggie's having trouble keeping him steady as she opens the car
door.
Ike is there in a flash to help her pull Walter into the
car.
WALTER (cont'd)
Good daughters let their fathers pass
out.
Walter passes out on the front seat.
MAGGIE
(without difficulty)
Ike... Please don't write anything
about this --
IKE
No.
Forget about it.
Don't even think
about it.
Maggie looks at him with real gratitude.
She swings the car
door shut.
MAGGIE
Watch your leg, Dad.
(then to Ike)
I'm so tired of this.
IKE
Why don't you let him sleep it off in
the trunk. I'll take you for a ride.
Then we'll come back for him.
(to Drunk on bench)
Keep an eye on him.
DRUNK MAN
I'm too loaded.
IKE
I was talking to the dog.
(turning to Maggie)
All right?
Maggie thinks about this for a moment.
She takes a deep breath.
MAGGIE
Okay... I'll just grab my jacket.
CUT TO:
Establishing of Ike's car driving.
Ike and Maggie stare forward.
Both seem in melancholy moods.
They're beginning to sense they're in trouble here.
Suddenly,
the car falters and jerks.
It shows to a stop on the shoulder of
the road.
The car backfires and smokes.
NIGHT
Ike and Maggie sit in the steaming car for a moment.
MAGGIE
Your filter's clogged.
This takes
unleaded.
IKE
Can you fix it?
MAGGIE
First I have to find some tools.
I
need a half and a nine-six-tenth.
IKE
(removing his glasses)
Of what?
MAGGIE
(in amazement)
Wrenches.
My dad's gonna love that one.
Maggie slams the food closed.
IKE
Kind of isolated.
MAGGIE
Yeah.
It's kind of nice.
An uncomfortable silent pause.
Ike breaks the moment.
IKE
There's one thing we New Yorkers know
how to do is hail a cab.
If there's no
cab, we walk.
Ike stares off down the road.
Maggie indicates a building in
the distance, then turns off the car lights.
MAGGIE
I can get some tools over there.... and
save the battery... There's one thing
we country girls know how to do is cut
across a field.
It's quicker.
Maggie points diagonally across the field to where a gas station
sign glows and the lights from the outer house twinkle.
He smiles and follows her into the field.
MAGGIE (cont'd)
Be careful of snakes.
IKE
Snakes?
Are you serious?
I don't like
snakes.
I've never even seen a snake.
He steps carefully into the field, then hops gingerly toward Maggie.
MOMENTS LATER
Maggie leads Ike through a cornfield.
MAGGIE
Do you think there's only one right
person for everybody?
Ike chooses his words carefully.
IKE
No.
But I think attraction is too
often mistaken for rightness.
Attraction is very misleading.
And if
it's mutual, it's well, terribly
distracting.
MAGGIE
Yes it is.
And it doesn't mean
anything.
Ike nods as they come to a wooden fence.
She puts her hand on
his shoulder.
Ike puts his hands around her waits to give her a
boost over the top.
We see the flicker of misunderstanding cross
Maggie's face at the initial contact.
Neither of them moves --
forward or back, but the electricity is obvious.
ANGLE ON:
Ike.
His conflicted feelings are apparent.
With
difficulty, Maggie straightens up and they both quickly remove
their hands.
MAGGIE (cont'd)
(lightly)
I suddenly forgot how to climb a fence.
They look at each other for a moment, then:
MAGGIE AND IKE
(breaking the
moment jokingly)
"Tools".
She climbs over the fence on her own and Ike follows.
They see
an old guy, LIONEL, whittling on a porch.
MAGGIE (cont'd)
Lionel, can I borrow some tools?
IKE
Yeah, we need a half and nine-
sixteenths.
LIONEL
Gonna bust out of another wedding?
IKE
You're sure well known around here.
Establishing shot.
Ike walks down a street toward Ellie and Fisher.
CUT TO:
We hear Hawaiian music.
We see a truck with GUESTS drive up and
HULA DANCERS through barn slats.
Ike runs after Maggie.
He grabs her arm and turns her to him.
IKE
I'm the only goddamn person in there
pulling for you.
MAGGIE
You humiliated me!
IKE
No, Maggie, I defended you.
Humiliating you is what everyone else
is doing.
It's the theme of this party.
MAGGIE
I had it under control.
Now they feel
sorry for me.
IKE
Well, they should.
Because they're
about to watch you hang yourself again.
Maggie has no response.
IKE (cont'd)
-- Tell me something, do you really
care about Mount Everest?
MAGGIE
It's fun!
It's high.
IKE
Or the sexual habits of locusts?
MAGGIE
That was very interesting research
George was doing!
IKE
What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary
tattoo?
MAGGIE
I already explained about that.
IKE
And where you ever really going to run
the leper colony in Molokai?
MAGGIE
(wincing)
Brian told you that?
IKE
Or maybe you just wanted to wear the
headdress.
MAGGIE
Every one of those times I was being
supportive.
Something you won't
understand.
IKE
Supportive?
You weren't being
supportive.
You were being scared.
Just like now.
You are the most lost
woman I have ever laid eyes on.
MAGGIE
Lost!
IKE
That's right.
You're so lost you don't
even know how you like your eggs.
MAGGIE
What!?
IKE
With the priest, you liked them
scrambled.
With the Dead Head, fried.
With the bug guy, poached.
Now it's
egg whites only, thank you very much.
MAGGIE
That's called changing your mind.
IKE
No, that's called not having a mind of
your own.
What are you doing, Maggie?
You really want to let that man drag
you up Annapuma on your honeymoon?
You
don't want to climb Annapuma.
MAGGIE
Yes I do!
IKE
No you don't.
You want a man who will
lead you down the beach with his head
over your eyes just so you can discover
the feel of the sand under your feet.
You want a guy who will take you into a
cave with a thousand candles just to
read you a poem.
You want a man to
wake you up at dawn because he's
burning to talk to you and he can't
wait another minute to find out what
you'll say.
Am I right?
He's laid her flat.
Maggie can't speak.
IKE (cont'd)
Am I right?
She fights back angry tears.
MAGGIE
Stop.
Stop it!
I'm getting married on
Sunday, and you're just trying to make
me run!
Why?
Because you're a cynical,
exploitative, mean-hearted creep who
wouldn't know real love if it bit him
in the armpit!
And all you do is tear
other people down and-and-and laugh at
them, and criticize what they do,
because you're too afraid to do
anything yourself!
I read your column.
You never wrote one about you.
I'm not
the only one who's lost and you know it!
Am I right?
Well?
Am I right?
ANGLE ON:
Bob comes outside.
BOB
Mag.
Help me out here.
Green Bay.
Right guard.
Both Maggie and Ike are breathing hard.
Bob comes up to Maggie
and gives Ike a very hard look as he puts his arm around his
fiancee.
BOB (cont'd)
You know... Blocked Bart Starr, crewcut
... Are you okay?
Maggie adjusts her face as best she can.
MAGGIE
Yes.
BOB
Let me take you back inside, okay?
She lets him lead her away.
MAGGIE
Jerry Kramer.
Ike looks at her drooped shoulder and he shakes his head and
walks to his car.
Peggy and Cindy arrive for the rehearsal.
They leave Cindy's
dog in Peggy's car and walk to the church.
CINDY
Tell me, why does Maggie need another
wedding rehearsal and two days before
the wedding?
She's already done this.
PEGGY
Bob is making her visualize the
ceremony.
CUT TO:
Bob is halfway down the walk.
Maggie appears at the church door
and calls after him.
MAGGIE
Bob, I'm sorry!
(half to herself)
At least I backed out before the
wedding.
That's progress!
He keeps marching.
Now Peggy appears next to Maggie.
Maggie
calls again.
MAGGIE (cont'd)
Some woman is going to make you a lot
happier than I ever could...
The words are barely out of her mouth when Cindy comes out the
door, racing after Bob at a full sprint.
MAGGIE (cont'd)
See?
PEGGY
Well, Maggie -- in the words of Mrs.
Pressman: "Holy moly".
Call me later.
Peggy goes to her car.
Cindy joins her as Bob speeds off in his
car.
Now Ike takes Peggy's place next to Maggie.
Maggie turns
to face Ike.
They are both beet red, stammering and unable to
look at each other, trying to act normal.
MAGGIE
Okay.
So... what, uh... What just
happened?
Just now?
Jus then?
In
there?
IKE
I don't know.
I, uh -- I frankly don't
even want to talk about it.
MAGGIE
Me, either.
Ike GRABS Maggie and BOOM -- they are all over each other,
kissing frantically, tongues, hands, hair, elbow, you name it.
Blathering fools.
IKE
(blathering)
I love you.
I love you.
MAGGIE
(blathering)
I love you, too.
They come up for air.
IKE
Wait.
We have to talk.
We have to do
some talking now.
Pull up a railing.
Maggie sits on the railing, then Ike backs up and sits on the
opposite railing.
IKE (cont'd)
You have to go down an aisle and say "I
do".
You have to get married.
MAGGIE
To who?
Are you asking me?
IKE
Me?
Ike backs up to opposite railing and sits facing Maggie.
MAGGIE
Yes, you!
IKE
(thinks)
Well, you do have the dress.
MAGGIE
And the church.
IKE
And the wedding date.
There's the two
of us.
(beat)
So, you think... maybe... You have to
go down the aisle with somebody you
love and who love you back.
MAGGIE
I'm okay with that.
IKE
So am I.
MAGGIE
So, we'll...
They both nod and sit there smiling, sort of. The organist, Ted,
closes the church door.
TED
Good night.
Ike pulls his tape recorder out of his pocket and quietly speaks
into it.
IKE
I'm getting married.
WIDE SHOT:
They smile at each other and remain sitting.
Then, silence.
CUT TO:
Ike drives up and parks in front of the hotel as he talks on his
cell phone.
INTERCUT WITH:
Ike and Maggie fishing.
Maggie and Ike horseback riding.
They sit on their horses
amongst trees, "nuzzling".
Ike reads as he pushes Maggie in a
tire swing.
It is a media circus including FOUR REPORTERS, Midday with
Meredith and the T-shirt Vendor.
Plus three other people the
reporters are interviewing, a GERMAN LADY, BUTCH KENAN, a
farmer and Grandma Julia.
Reporter DINA NAPOLI walks down the
church steps.
DINA NAPOLI (OF WBAL)
Wedding bells are ringing for the
fourth time today in Hale, Maryland.
Maggie Carpenter, "Always a Bride --
Never a Bridesmaid", will be attempting
to complete her fourth wedding ceremony.
We'll come back on the air when the
results are in.
Back to you, Jessica.
Meredith, the low-end public access TV reporter, films himself
pointing a cheap video camera himself.
MEREDITH
The turnout for this morning's wedding
is usually reserved for royalty or
Hollywood stars, but Maggie Carpenter
is Hale, Maryland's special star and
the citizens of Hale are out in full
force today.
The NY T-shirt Vendor pitches his wares.
T-SHIRT VENDOR
I got "Bye-bye Birdie".
"What part of
'I do' don't you understand?"... Get
your "Runaway Bride" T-shirts here...
Reporter JULIE MURPHY stands near Grandma Julia and Mrs.
Pressman.
JULIE MURPHY (Channel 6)
The bride's been here for almost an
hour, but being around in the beginning
was never her problem.
We'll be here,
showing you the full wedding ceremony,
we hope.
Reporter JACKI and TIFFANY stand at the edge of the CROWD
reporting.
JACKI/REPORTER #3 (WBOC TV16)
Will she or won't she?
That is on the
minds of these several hundreds folks,
who are standing here this morning.
Not to mention on the mind of Groom
Number #4, ex-USA Today columnist, Ike
Graham, who is missing in action.
INSERT window of church.
Peggy peers out the window at the
carnival scene.
Cindy sits with Maggie as she leans forward,
doubled over on a child's chair.
Peggy moves from the window to
sit with them.
MAGGIE
(moves to window)
He's not coming.
Watch.
He's not
coming.
PEGGY
No, no.
I saw eight geese flying in a
"V".
MAGGIE
You and your lucky geese.
You always
see geese.
PEGGY
Not eight...
CINDY
And in a "V".
MAGGIE
Eight is good... "V" could be Victory.
They ad lib various words starting with the letter "V".
Maggie
is nervous.
CINDY
Rub your ears.
PEGGY
Yes, rubbing your ears is very soothing.
Cory does that to me when I
hyperventilate.
Maggie rubs her ears.
CINDY
We do it to our dog.
MAGGIE
It's hurting.
CINDY
We'll rub.
After they rub Maggie's ears a bit:
PEGGY
He's here!
He's here!
They all squeeze and peer out window.
They scream in excitement.
Cindy rushes to Maggie's wedding dress.
CINDY
I'll get the dress.
MAGGIE
He's here!... He's here!
PEGGY
Now's the time for calm... If you don't
calm down, you won't get your dress on...
(reassuringly)
He's the one... He's the one.
Peggy moves to help Cindy with the dress.
Maggie stands alone at
the window a moment.
She picks up a toy horse.
MAGGIE
This is not a good sign.
Maggie goes over to Peggy and Cindy, and starts to get into her
bridal gown.
They continue to ad lib words standing with the
letter "V".
CINDY
We have to hurry.
The Sunday School
kids will be here soon.
CUT TO:
Ike stops the car where it is and jumps out, slamming the door in
anger.
The REPORTERS swarm around him as he gets out of the car.
They continue to pound him with questions as he walks to church
steps.
An OLDER LADY smacks him on the shoulder with a
newspaper.
He turns in astonishment and continues up the
steps.
He charges up the stairs and grabs Lee.
IKE
Shoot ours so she has one with an
ending.
Mrs. Pressman stands, shooting Ike with her video camera.
IKE (cont'd)
(pleading)
Mrs. Pressman, please.
MRS. PRESSMAN
It's okay.
There's no microphone.
You're no fun.
IKE
No, I'm not.
Ike retreats into the church.
Lee comes up to him again with his
video camera:
CHUFFA about Scorsese.
Maggie flies toward a FedEx truck at next house just leaving.
ANOTHER ANGLE:
She gathers her dress and jumps in as Ike yells from window,
then, quickly climbs out onto the lawn as the truck starts to
pull away.
IKE
Maggie!
Maggie looks back once, tearful and regretful, and disappears
inside the truck.
The truck races off.
The PHOTOGRAPHERS turn their cameras on Ike, en masse.
He is
enveloped by a barrage of bright lights.
Ellie and Fisher, who have also stepped outside on chapel front
steps, are looking around as Ike turns around the corner and
past the church.
ELLIE
Look, he's running after her.
FISHER
Look, he's in pretty good shape.
ELLIE
Poor Ike.
They look after the FedEx truck and watch Ike chasing the truck
down the road away from the church.
IKE
(running; yells)
Maggie!
ELLIE
Where do you think she's going?
FISHER
Wherever it is, she'll be there by ten-
thirty tomorrow.
Cindy, Cory, Peggy and Meredith also rush out of the church and
comment on Maggie's runaway.
Further down the road, Ike still
chases the truck, yelling:
IKE
Maggie!
As the truck rounds the bend in the road and disappears, Ike
stops and stares alone after the disappearing truck.
A swarm of
REPORTERS catch up to him, flashing pictures and asking
questions.
Another camera flashes and we cut to:
A NEWSPAPER PHOTO
Of Ike's stunned face on the cover of the USA Today.
The caption
reads: "Hit and Run:
Runaway Bride Strikes again".
And we see
headlines in other papers.
"MAGGIE'S MAD DASH"
"HARDWARE HONEY GOES NUTS AND BOLTS"
"JOURNALIST WRITTEN OFF"
"BRIDE TAKES HIKE...NOT IKE"
"BRIDE TAKE RIDE"
"MAGGIE SAYS I DON'T"
NEWSPAPER MONTAGE:
Various newspaper WORKERS also read Jay's column in the USA
Today entitled "Maggie Mad Dash" and "Hardware Honey Goes Nuts
and Bolts" in another newspaper.
FADE IN
It's a night like any other in Hale -- the regular order of
things has been restored on its quaint streets.
Quartet sings
in front of the hotel.
LEE AND CORY CHUFFA:
About where Peggy
is.
Establishing shot.
Two MEN try to fix the engine of a taxi
outside the restaurant.
CUT TO:
Eke walks by the T-shirt Vendor, goes into a subway station.
Ike crosses a busy street where a MAN is being arrested.
Ike is
passing the upscale "Millennium Hardware Store".
He glances at
the window, looks away, stops and looks again.
The window
display is made up of an assortment of Maggie's lamps.
Logo
"MAG" is on them.
He smiles and walks on.
Ike stares out at water as he walks.
Ike walks along sidewalk, crosses street, enters his building.
The balcony overlooks Central Park.
The twinkling lights of the
city stretch out across the beautiful night.
Ike looks out at
the view with his back to Maggie as she speaks.
MAGGIE
I understand why you bring up the truck.
Let me explain something.
The fact is,
you've seen me at my worst, most
embarrassing, deviously plotting,
potentially but not certifiably,
psychotic state.
And if you liked me
then, I mean, now... I can't imagine...
(crosses to him)
Benedict.
Ike has no response.
MAGGIE (cont'd)
I love eggs Benedict.
I hate all the
other kinds.
She hesitates.
MAGGIE (cont'd)
... I hate big weddings with everybody
staring.
I would like to get married
on a weekday while everybody is at work.
If I ride off into the sunset, I want
my own horse.
IKE
Should I be writing this down?
She returns to the balcony and hands him the box.
IKE (cont'd)
What's this?
MAGGIE
These are for you.
He opens it.
It's her running shoes.
IKE
Used?
MAGGIE
They're mine.
I'm turning in my
running shoes to you.
IKE
This is getting serious.
Now she is glowing at him, shining with the full force of her.
MAGGIE
And one more thing.
I know it's hard
to believe there could be more.
Um...
Maggie glances around and spots a DECK CHAIR, which she turns so
it is facing the city lights.
Then she softly says:
MAGGIE (cont'd)
If you could have a seat, please.
Ike sits.
Maggie takes the box from him and puts it aide.
And
then she gets down on one knee.
IKE
(laughing)
Oh my God.
No.
Maggie smiles up at him.
Ike tips his head back and covers his
eyes with his hand.
MAGGIE
No, no -- don't hide your face, this
only happens once in a lifetime.
It's
definitely a first to me, and you're
not going to want to miss it.
He smiles as he looks at Maggie.
MAGGIE (cont'd)
I love you, Homer Eisenhower Graham.
Will you marry me?
Ike swallows, overwhelmed, overjoyed, and scared shitless.
IKE
Maggie, I gotta think about this a
little bit.
Maggie hops cheerfully back to her feet.
MAGGIE
(cheerful)
Good.
She gets off her knees and stands.
MAGGIE (cont'd)
I was hoping you'd say that.
IKE
(laughing)
You were not.
MAGGIE
I was, because if you said "yes" right
away, I wouldn't get to say this next
part.
And I've been practicing it.
(pulling up a chair
and sitting)
Ready?
IKE
I'm listening.
MAGGIE
(tenderly)
"I guarantee that we'll have tough
times.
I guarantee
that at some point
one or both oof us will want to get out.
But I also guarantee that if I don't
ask you to be mine, I'll regret it for
the rest of my life. Because I know in
my heart -- you're the only one for me".
Ike takes her hands affectionately.
IKE
Pretty good speech, Maggie.
MAGGIE
I borrowed it from this guy I know.
So?
Ike looks into Maggie's shining face and pauses.
He gets up and
motions with his hand for her to stay seated.
He goes inside and
turns on some music.
The cat is sitting by the radio.
He
returns to the balcony and takes Maggie's hand.
IKE
Dance with me.
They start to dance a slow dance.
DISSOLVE TO:
We see a hill and on top of it is a Pastor marrying Maggie and
Ike, in beautiful wedding attire.
We see Maggie walk down a
leaf-lined aisle to a waiting Ike.
They kiss as we hear the vows
and hear them each say "I do".
They kiss a twirling, whirling
kiss, a circular kiss.
We hear the applause of about twenty
people.
Slowly, we see the twenty people come over the crest of
the hill.
They are all Maggie's family and friends, plus the
old grooms.
They are all paired in twos, like a love Noah's ark.
We see others get the news.
ANOTHER ANGLE:
Maggie and Ike finally break the kiss.
Ike takes her hand and
walks her to two horses.
Ike and Maggie, on the two horses, ride
off happily in their wedding clothes.
As the group cheers,
Maggie throws bouquet.
We see it float in the air.
FADE TO BLACK.
