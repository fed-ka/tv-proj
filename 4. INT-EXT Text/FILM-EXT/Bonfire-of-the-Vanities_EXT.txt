Oh, yes, Sherman, do explain it.
MR. McCOY
Yes. Your mother and I really

A bond is a way of lending
people
money.
Let's say you want
to
build a road or a hospital
and you
need a lot of money. Well,
you
issue a bond...
CAMPBELL
Do you build roads?
SHERMAN
No, I don't actually build them...
MR. McCOY
I think you're in over your head.
More laughter.
JUDY
Here. Let me try. Darling, Daddy
doesn't build roads or hospitals
or anything, really. Daddy just
handles the bonds for the people
who raise the money.
CAMPBELL
That's what he said. Bonds.
JUDY
Yes. See, just imagine that a
bond is a slice of cake. Now you
didn't bake that cake, but every

that cake, a little bit comes off,
little crumbs fall off. And you're

He passes somebody else's cake

But you have to imagine a lot of
crumbs. And a great golden cake.
And a lot of golden crumbs. And
you have to imagine Daddy running
around picking up every little
golden crumb he can get his hands

SHERMAN
Well, you can call them crumbs

That's the best I can do.

stop, Sherman? Sherman! This way!
This way! How's your wife taking

A microphone is shoved into Sherman's face.

Don't make any statements! Don't

I'll be upstairs when they

Okay.
Try it again.
Sherman walks back through the gate.
The ALARM SOUNDS

GOLDBERG
What the fuck? Wait a minute.
Come here. Bend over.
Sherman looks terrified.
GOLDBERG
I ain't going to touch you. Just
bend over at the waist and back
through the gate. Real slow.
Sherman bends over at a ninety-degree angle and, holding
up his trousers, shuffles backwards through the gate.
GOLDBERG
Slow. Slow. Slow. A little
farther, little farther. Little
farther. Little farther...
As Sherman's head goes through the gate, the ALARM
SOUNDS. Goldberg jumps up and down and claps his hands
with delight.
GOLDBERG
Hey, Martin.
Come here.
Look

Martin approaches.

Okay, Sherman. Do that again.

He is drunk.
PETER (V.O.)
It was too much for me. All of it.
Sherman McCoy had been swept away

to him. And as the day progressed,
I began to appreciate the power, the

unleashed by my little story.

Sherman would never tell you that.
PETER
I was hoping you might tell me
exactly what happened that night.
MARIA
Look, Mr.... Mr....

They pound on the gates as the courtroom guards try to

SHERMAN
Are you alright?
JUDGE
I'm alright.
Damn hooligans.
He walks up to the iron gates. The faces of the demon-
strators are pressed against it. The Judge shakes a
tired fist at them. Then he turns to Sherman.
JUDGE
And you. You, too. You go home
now. And be decent. You hear me?
SHERMAN
I hear you, Your Honor.
The Judge shakes his fist at Sherman, too. Then he opens
the fist and offers his hand to Sherman. Sherman takes
