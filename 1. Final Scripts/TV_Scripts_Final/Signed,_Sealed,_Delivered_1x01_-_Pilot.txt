                                          ACT ONE

1EXT. DENVER - PRESENT DAY (2013)- DAY

      We see the sights of Denver - the mountains, the skyline,
      the lake in Washington Park...

2EXT. DENVER SUBURB - DAY

      We DRIVE down a pleasant local shopping area, passing
      boutiques, a U.S. Mail truck is parked nearby.  A MAIL CARRIER
      steps out to deliver a box to a florist shop.  WE PASS the
      truck and continue down the street, stopping at a Starbuck's. 
      In front of the Starbuck's, on the corner, stands one of the
      last remaining U.S. Mailboxes in the area.

3EXT. STARBUCK'S - DAY

      Along the window, facing towards the street, is a ROW OF
        TWENTY-SOMETHINGS sitting at a long counter staring - not
      out the window - but at their laptops and iPads.

      THE CAMERA PUSHES IN THROUGH THE WINDOW

      We HEAR a MALE VOICE.

                                    MALE VOICE (V.O.)
                    Look at them. Guzzling their pumpkin-
                    flavored coffee, tapping away on
                    their laptops...

4INT. STARBUCK'S - DAY

      The CAMERA PANS the Twenty-Somethings along the counter.

                                    MALE VOICE (V.O.)
                      ...Cruising Craigslist for a job
                    that will pay them to sit on their
                    fat modems in some other place and
                    tap on someone else's computer to
                    earn money for more pumpkin flavored
                    coffee.  It's the Great Circle of
                    Life reduced to a laptop. 

      ANGLE ON: A PAIR OF WOMEN'S HOT BLACK HIGH HEEL SLINGS

      One TOE taps impatiently.  In front and behind, other pairs
      of shoes wait in line to give their orders at the front
      counter. 

      A bored BARISTA calls out an order.                                                                                         2.

                                      STARBUCKS EMPLOYEE (O.S.)
                    Vente vanilla mocha macchiato with
                    a double shot of mocha.

      ANGLE ON: THE "DELIVERY" COUNTER

      A CUSTOMER steps forward to retrieve his coffee.

                                    MALE VOICE (V.O.)
                    You have to ask yourself why anyone
                    would choose these bleak occupations
                    over...

      ANGLE ON THE LINE OF SHOES, THE HEELS AND PAIR OF MEN'S
      LOAFERS AHEAD OF THEM IN LINE.

      PANNING UP we meet OLIVER O'TOOLE, 40's, good-looking in an
      intense sort of way, intelligent, unorthodox but kind. 
      Dressed in slacks and jacket, Oliver appraises the jean and
      T-shirt set that sips coffee at tables around him.

                                      OLIVER (V.O.)
                    ...a calling. 

      Behind Oliver, we discover the owner of the high heels is
      SHANE, a confident, carelessly beautiful woman in her early
      thirties, wearing sunglasses and a cool leather jacket. She
      searches for something on her Smart Phone.

                                      BARISTA
                    Next!

      Oliver steps up to order.

                                      OLIVER
                    I'd like a cup of coffee.

                                      BARISTA
                    Tall?  Grande?  Venti?

                                      OLIVER
                    I'm sorry, I'm not following...

                                      BARISTA
                          (sighs)
                    Small, medium, or large?

                                      OLIVER
                    Medium.  Medium coffee.

                                      BARISTA
                    Right.  Which coffee?

                                      OLIVER
                    What do you recommend?                                                                                        3.

                                      BARISTA
                      Everything's on the wall.  It's up
                    to you.

                                      OLIVER
                    This is my first visit.  Frankly,
                      I wouldn't be here at all if my
                    coffee machine hadn't been illegally
                      appropriated after an unfortunate
                    war of words with my superior. 
                    Well, I wouldn't call her my
                    superior, let's say supervisor, a
                    woman utterly lacking in....

        A frustrated Shane interrupts.

                                      SHANE
                    Excuse me, can I just give him my
                    order while you're reminisci...?

                                      OLIVER
                      ....Excuse me?

                                      SHANE
                    ....I'll even pay for your coffee
                    if you'll just let me go ahead of
                    you.

      Oliver turns to see Shane behind him.

                                      OLIVER
                    Be my guest.

                                      SHANE
                    I'm sorry. I'm just late and it's
                    my first day at my new job.

                                      OLIVER
                    At least you're employed...

                                      SHANE
                          (to Barista)
                    Grande skinny vanilla latte.

                                      OLIVER
                      ...instead of sitting over there
                    staring into cyberspace.

                                      SHANE
                          (still ordering)
                    And he'll have a venti blonde
                      Americano.

                                      OLIVER
                    What's that?                                                                                        4.

                                      SHANE
                    Black coffee.  Most of those guys
                    actually ARE employed.  They're
                    just working from home.
                      Theoretically.

                                      OLIVER
                    And someone pays them? 
                      Theoretically?

                                      BARISTA
                    Grande skinny vanilla latte and a 
                    Venti Americano.

                                      SHANE
                          (grabs her coffee)
                    Gotta go.
                          (she drops a ten on
                          the counter)
                    Keep the change.

      She rushes off.  Oliver watches her leave.  

5EXT. STREET - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

      Oliver strolls down the street carrying his cup of coffee.
      He walks like a man who enjoys being alive, appreciating the
      things around him: the blue sky, the flowers in the planters
      on the sidewalk, the mailbox ahead on the corner.

                                      OLIVER (V.O.)
                    There it is, the last bastion of
                    civility in a world of megabytes
                    and downloads, a beacon of hope to
                    those who still put their faith in
                    the power of a piece of paper and
                      a forty-six cent stamp.

      A woman walks up to the mailbox.  Oliver gallantly holds the
      shoot open for her.  She smiles and drops her letter inside
      and walks off.  He looks at the mailbox fondly as he sips
      his coffee.

                                      OLIVER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    Behind every envelope stand
                    thousands of dedicated heroes who
                    still fight the good fight through
                    rain and snow and fiscal cliffs to
                    deliver every note, every card,
                    every letter.  And I am one of
                    them, the few, the proud, the
                    postal. I work for you, whoever
                    you are.  Or, whoever...you were.                                                                                        5.

      ANGLE ON THE MAILBOX

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

6EXT. DUPLEX APARTMENT - DAY

      CLOSE ON two small hanging mailboxes marked with an A or B  
      between a blue door and a brown door. 

      ANGLE ON THE STREET

      A taxicab pulls up to the curb in front of the brick duplex 
      in the middle class neighborhood.

      ANGLE ON PASSENGER SEAT

      KELLY, a beautiful young woman in her mid-twenties, looks at
      the blue door and smiles sadly.

      KELLY'S POV

      The house number above the blue door: 1020.

      Kelly writes the address on a STAMPED PINK ENVELOPE.

                                      KELLY
                    Okay, thanks.  Just one more stop
                    now before the station, please.

7EXT. DENVER STREET CORNER - DAY

      The impatient taxi DRIVER HONKS from the taxicab. 

                                      DRIVER
                    Lady, are you coming or not?

      Kelly stands in front of a mailbox on a street corner.  She
      holds the pink envelope in one hand and the open slot with
      the other hand, debating whether or not to mail the letter. 
      She puts it in, takes it out, thinks it over.

                                      DRIVER (CONT'D)
                    Decide already!

                                      KELLY
                    I'm sorry, I just...

                                      DRIVER
                    "When in doubt, don't."  My mother
                    always said that and she was no
                    dummy.

      That seems to make some sense to Kelly.  She stuffs the letter
      in her pocket, walks back to the cab and gets in.  They drive
      off.                                                                                         6.

8EXT. UNION STATION - DAY - MINUTES LATER

      The taxi pulls up to the curb.  Our Taxi Driver, now somewhat
      kinder and gentler, gets out and retrieves Kelly's luggage
      as she exits the taxi.  He gives her a genuine, sympathetic
      smile.

                                      DRIVER
                    Here you go, kid. 

                                      KELLY
                    Thanks.

      She starts to pay him.  The Driver stops her.

                                      DRIVER
                    No.  You keep it.

                                      KELLY
                    But...

                                      DRIVER
                    Honest.  I hear a lot of stories
                    come outta that backseat, but yours
                    is a doozie. 

                                      KELLY
                    I haven't told anybody.  I can't
                    believe I told you.

                                      DRIVER
                    Hey, comes with the territory. 
                    I'm kinda like a therapist with
                    six cylinders!

      She laughs and reaches for her luggage.

                                      DRIVER (CONT'D)
                    Don't worry, honey. You're doing
                    the right thing. And mail that
                    letter.  Life is short.

      Something he says resonates with her.  She smiles as if
      recalling a memory.

                                      KELLY
                    I know.
                          (hands him the envelope)
                    I'm so late.  Could you....?

                                      DRIVER
                    No problem.  All part of the
                    service. Take care of yourself,
                    kid.                                                                                         7.

      She smiles and walks into the station.  The Taxi Driver turns
      back to the taxi about to close the trunk.

                                    MALE TRAVELER (O.S.)
                    Taxi!  Hey!

      He stops and turns to see an arriving COUPLE approach with
      luggage.

                                    MALE TRAVELER (CONT'D)
                    We're going to the Drake.

                                      DRIVER
                    Get in.  I've got that.

      He reaches for the luggage, dropping the envelope into the
      side pocket of his jacket.  Except he misses and, unbeknownst
      to him, the PINK ENVELOPE falls onto the pavement.

      The driver drops the bags in the back, slams the trunk, gets
      in the car and drives away, revealing a kiosk where two
      election posters are plastered, one to re-elect Barack Obama
      and one for Mitt Romney.   We realize we are in 2012. The
      CAMERA PANS BACK to THE PINK ENVELOPE.  It lies on the
      pavement.

      Seconds later, the WHEELS of a car drive over it and then we
      see the FEET of a MOTHER and a LITTLE BOY walk past it.  The
      Boy turns around and we WIDEN to see him pick up the damaged
      envelope.

                                      MOTHER
                    What are you doing?  Hurry up!

                                      LITTLE BOY
                    Somebody dropped this. 

                                      MOTHER
                    Give it to me. We'll mail it when
                    we get to Aunt Dody's.

      She takes it and slips it into her purse.

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

9EXT. RANCH HOUSE - DAY - THAT AFTERNOON

      A taxi with a Texas license plate pulls up in front of a
      ranchhouse where AUNT DODY and her TWO PRE-SCHOOL AGED
      CHILDREN and a BARKING PUPPY are waiting to greet the Mother
      and Little Boy from Denver as they emerge from the taxi. 

                                    DODY
                    Welcome to Texas!                                                                                        8.

      The Mother puts down her purse to embrace Dody, the puppy
      barks & children scream excitedly.  They ad lib greetings.

                                      MOTHER
                    Finally!  What a trip!

      The smallest child, a LITTLE GIRL all dressed in pink, toddles
      up to the purse on the ground and, unnoticed by anyone,
      retrieves the PINK ENVELOPE.

                                      LITTLE GIRL
                    Pink!  Pink!

      She runs around the lawn and up to the porch.

10INT. RANCH HOUSE BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      The Little Girl enters her pink-decorated bedroom holding
      the PINK ENVELOPE.  She opens the lid of a toy box filled
      with toys and dolls.

      POV - from Toy Box interior.

                                      LITTLE GIRL
                    Pink!

      She SHUTS THE LID.

      WE ARE IN BLACK.

      CHYRON: "ELEVEN MONTHS LATER"

11INT. RANCH HOUSE BEDROOM - ELEVEN MONTHS LATER

      We HEAR the urgent sniffing and whining of a DOG. The lid
      opens up and peering at us is Aunt Dody and Ranger, the NOW-
      FULL-GROWN DOG.

                                    AUNT DODY
                    What's in there, Ranger?  Hmmm? 
                    What do you smell in there?

      Aunt Dody pulls out a dripping chocolate fudge bar.  Aunt
      Dody groans.

                                    AUNT DODY (CONT'D)
                    Ewww.  What are we going to do
                    with that girl, Rang...

      She stops, seeing something else in the box.  She pulls out
      the PINK ENVELOPE, covered in melted chocolate.

                                    AUNT DODY (CONT'D)
                     What on earth....?                                                                                        9.

      She tries to wipe the chocolate off, but only manages to
      smear it worse. She sighs.

12EXT. RANCH HOUSE - DAY - LATER

      We see Aunt Dody at the sidewalk drive carrying the PINK
      ENVELOPE, but the name and address are incomprehensibly
      smudged.  She inserts it into the mailbox and lifts the
      "outgoing" flag.

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

13INT. U.S. MAIL REGIONAL FACILITY - DENVER - PRESENT DAY

      The PINK ENVELOPE makes its way down a conveyor belt.

      We WIDEN to see we are in a huge, noisy warehouse of a room. 
      Dozens of MAIL WORKERS sort letters and packages, bags of
      letters are dumped into boxes and sorted onto conveyor belts. 
      We SEE the damaged PINK ENVELOPE, but this time it is re-
      directed to another conveyor.  And another.  And into a
      machine that stamps its envelopes with the words:

      "DEAD LETTER"

      The PINK ENVELOPE falls into a mail bin on rollers and it is
      immediately covered by hundreds of other dead letters that
      are dumped on top of it by an unseen MAIL WORKER.

      The CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal an employee, NORMAN, (mid-
      thirties, intelligent but a fountain of only occasionally
      helpful information). Norman dumps more letters on top and
      pushes the bin past Oliver, who is sipping his Starbuck's
      coffee below a government-issued portrait of Barack Obama. 
      Norman pushes the bin through a door that slams shut after
      him.  The sign on the door reads:

      "DEAD LETTER TERMINAL"

      Somewhere behind that door, the PINK ENVELOPE with Kelly's
      letter lies hopelessly...dead.

      ANGLE ON: OLIVER

      He stands in the busy room with calm authority, the only one
      who refuses to wear a uniform. In his mind, he is a god in
      the pantheon of mail delivery. Oliver reads an OSHA flier on
      the employee bulletin board with disdain.

                                      OLIVER
                    "There is no job so important that
                    we can't do it safely."
                                      (MORE)                                                                                      10.

                                      OLIVER (CONT'D)
                          (to no one in
                            particular)
                    Patently false.  "Safety First" is
                    the battle cry of the meek.

      Oliver turns a passive eye to the parade of envelopes, boxes,
      and cards that stream towards his office.  Something catches
      his eye and his entire demeanor changes.  He urgently hits a
      switch, bringing everything to a halt as he grabs a slightly-
      mangled color postcard of the Eiffel Tower.  Watching Oliver
      from a distance is RITA, a fortyish female with glasses who
      never learned to apply make-up with colors found in nature. 
      Norman re-enters the floor and Rita exchanges a meaningful
      glance with him, indicating the reason for the hold-up on
      the line.

      They watch expectantly as Oliver stares a moment at the photo,
      then slowly turns it over.  He reads what is written on the
      other side and, as he has done so many times before, realizes
      it is not what he is looking for.  He returns it sadly to
      the conveyor belt, hits a switch, and resumes supervision of
      his kingdom.  Norman and Rita pretend they have seen nothing. 
      Oliver carries on.

      ANGLE ON:

      ANOTHER AREA OF THE FLOOR

      A large, overworked, no-nonsense supervisor ANDREA (60's)
      reads a file as a frustrated Shane argues with her as they
      walk towards Andrea's office.  Shane is the same beautiful
      woman we met earlier.  She argues with the attitude of a
      21st century career woman whose computer skills are surpassed
      only by her belief in the power of the social network to
      solve the problems of the world.

                                      SHANE
                    I told you, this is a mistake. 
                    I'm supposed to be assigned to
                    Direct Line Operations as a
                    technical systems consultant.

                                      ANDREA
                    Says here you're on DLO.

                                      SHANE
                    Direct Line Operations.  That's
                    what Washington is now calling
                      computer-managed delivery services.

                                      ANDREA
                    Well, DLO is what we're still
                    calling the Dead Letter Office.                                                                                      11.

      Shane follows Andrea into her glass cubicle office marked
      SUPERVISOR.

14INT. ANDREA'S OFFICE - DAY

                                      SHANE
                    Look, all you have to do is call
                    the PG's office in Washington and...

                                      ANDREA
                    Good idea.  I'll call the Postmaster
                    General right after I return that
                    call from the Secretary of Defense. 

                                      SHANE
                    This is ridiculous.  I don't belong
                    here.

                                      ANDREA
                    Oh, and....I do?
                          (thinks, then smiles
                            evilly)
                    I think I know what to do.  Have a
                    seat.

15INT. MAIN SORTING FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

      ANGLE ON OLIVER

      Andrea approaches him and hands him Shane's file.

                                      ANDREA
                    Oliver.  I want you to train this
                    girl.  She's a computer something
                    from Washington.

                                      OLIVER
                    No. 

                                      ANDREA
                    We need updated computer support
                    in your department.

                                      OLIVER
                      Absolutely not.

      Oliver enters through a door marked "DLO - No Unauthorized
      Personnel."  Andrea follows him back into his office. 

16INT. DLO (DEAD LETTER INNER SANCTUM) - CONTINUOUS

      Oliver, trailed by Andrea enter the DEAD LETTER OFFICE, a
      cramped, messy room with rubber stamps and stacks of books
      and bulletin boards with clippings, a tiny, ancient
        refrigerator from which Oliver extracts a bottle of chocolate                                                                                      12.

      Yoo-Hoo. There are bins and bins of dead letters.  Andrea
      steps over boxes labelled "Mid-Atlantic" "No Zip" "Bad
        Handwriting" etc.

                                      ANDREA
                    This isn't a request, your Lordship. 
                    And trust me, you will be sorry if
                    you can't get with the program
                    this time.

      Oliver opens the Yoo-Hoo soda bottle and pours it into a
      wine glass and savors it.

                                      OLIVER
                    Say what you will, I cannot teach
                    what cannot be taught to a brain
                    that has been programmed to reject
                    the subtleties of my craft.

                                      ANDREA
                    I will fire you.

                                      OLIVER
                    I have a Government Service Pay
                    Level higher than you can count. 
                    I am untouchable.

                                      ANDREA
                    I will take away your refrigerator.

                                      OLIVER
                    You will return my Mr. Coffee.

                                      ANDREA
                    Done.

                                      OLIVER
                    Send her in.

17INT. INNER SANCTUM - DAY - MINUTES LATER

      Oliver sits at his desk.   Norman stands nearby.  In the
      b.g., Rita sorts letters with a strange, balletic abandon. 
      There is a KNOCK on the door.  Oliver nods and Norman opens
      it to reveal Shane standing there.  They recognize each other.

                                      OLIVER
                    It's you!

                                      SHANE
                    It's Venti Americano.  Incredible.

                                      NORMAN
                    You know each other?                                                                                      13.

                                      OLIVER
                    No.  Just, theoretically.

                                      SHANE
                    I'm Shane McInerney.

      Oliver stares at her as if he doesn't understand.

                                      SHANE (CONT'D)
                    Shane.  Shane.

                                      OLIVER
                          (reading file)
                    I can't work with someone named
                    Shane.  Norman, tell her why.

                                      NORMAN
                      Because...
                          (guessing)
                    Because at some point, you, Shane,
                    will walk away and Oliver will
                    need you to return...?

                                      OLIVER
                    Very good, go on...

                                      NORMAN
                    And Oliver will be forced to say...

                                    RITA
                          (dramatically)
                    "Shane!  Come back, Shane!"

                                      OLIVER
                    At which point you will turn and
                    look at me with much the same
                    vacancy with which you stare at me
                    now, utterly unaware of the
                      unfortunate cinematic reference. 
                      Therefore, I shall call
                      you...Sheryl.

      Shane looks around this asylum and chooses discretion.

                                      SHANE
                      Okay....Look, I'm only here
                      temporarily.

                                      OLIVER
                    And how wise you are to recognize
                    such a great truth so early in
                    life.

                                      SHANE
                    I mean, there's been a mistake.                                                                                      14.

                                      OLIVER
                          (perusing the file)
                    A merry mix-up, perhaps.  But a
                    mistake?  We shall see.  Welcome
                    to the Inner Sanctum.
                          (hands file to Rita)
                    Rita, file this in a safe place.

      Rita takes it, scans it quickly page by page and tosses it
      onto a huge stack of unfiled papers.  Shane stares.

                                      OLIVER (CONT'D)
                      Photographic memory.  Total recall
                    is a plus in this business. 

18INT. MAIN POSTAL FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER

      Oliver is giving Shane a tour of his kingdom.  Norman follows.

                                      OLIVER
                    Every letter that passes through
                    the United States Postal System
                      symbolizes an act of faith.  Faith
                    that it will arrive at its
                      destination on time and in good
                      condition.  Faith that what was
                    written by the writER will remain
                    private until read by the...
                          (he waits for Shane)
                    By the...

                                      SHANE
                    Write-ee?

                                      OLIVER
                    This is a sacred covenant that, if
                    broken, signals what, Norman?

                                      NORMAN
                          (recites)
                    "The breakdown of civilization and
                    the beginning of anarchy."

                                      OLIVER
                    This is why we attempt to ascertain
                    the correct address using clues on
                    the OUTSIDE of the envelope until
                    we have NO OTHER CHOICE.  And when
                    that moment comes, we open the
                    letter reverently and respectfully,
                    much the way a medical student
                    performs a first autopsy...

      Oliver produces from a pocket an elegant letter-opener.                                                                                      15.

                                      SHANE
                    My God...

                                      OLIVER
                    And we read only as far as we must,
                    gathering and gleaning clues as to
                    the correct destination.  It's a
                      high-calling, Sheryl.

                                      SHANE
                    Shane.  Shane McInerney.

                                      OLIVER
                    A grave responsibility, Ms.
                      McInerney.  One that cannot be
                      dispatched merely by uploading and
                      downloading and...
                            (distastefully)
                      ..."Googling."

      Andrea approaches carrying a clipboard.

                                      ANDREA
                      McInerney!  Guess what!  There IS
                    something in the system called
                    Direct Line Operations.

                                      SHANE
                    I know.

                                      ANDREA
                    But it's not here, it's downtown.

                                      SHANE
                    Great. I'm on my way.

                                      ANDREA
                    Not so fast, missy.  You gotta
                    apply for reassignment and continue
                    working at your current level during
                    the six week waiting period before
                    you're approved for transfer.

                                      SHANE
                    Transfer. Is this a joke?  Six
                    weeks with these...these...

                                      ANDREA
                    Sign here.

      Shane sighs and takes a pen from Andrea.  She reads the paper.

                                      SHANE
                    Reason for transfer?                                                                                      16.

                                      ANDREA
                    Paper allergy.  Always works.

      Shane sighs, signs the document, and hands it back to Andrea.

                                      ANDREA (CONT'D)
                          (smiles evilly again)
                    Go with God.

      Shane wants to die.  Andrea waddles away.

                                      OLIVER
                    Hard to believe she was once Miss
                    Special Delivery of 1967.  Come
                    along.

      He opens the door to the DLO Inner Sanctum and Shane sighs
      and abandons all hope as she enters.

                                      OLIVER (CONT'D)
                    I'm sorry to say, you won't be
                    working from home.

19INT. INNER SANCTUM - CONTINUOUS

      Rita is still there, sorting with that graceful yet super-
      human skill.

                                      SHANE
                    I guess as long as I'm here, you
                    might as well show me your hard
                    drive.

                                      OLIVER
                    There's no need to be vulgar.

      Shane opens her laptop.  It is a small, sleek, amazing
      machine.

                                      NORMAN
                    Wow.  I've never seen one like
                    that before.

                                      SHANE
                    State of the art.  Configured to
                    my specifications.  You are looking
                    at a piece of classified hardware
                    with a 9750 processer, 1200 MBs of
                    RAM and a 72 GB hard drive with
                    NVIDIA graphics and a resolution
                    of 2200 by 1200 pixels.
                          (they stare at her)
                    Let's just say I have the capability
                    of a small army in the Caribbean.                                                                                      17.

      Rita rolls the large bin of letters over to Oliver.

                                      OLIVER
                    Ah. Let's get to the real work,
                    shall we?  Now, I believe that
                    there are no coincidences, Ms.
                      McInerney.  Everything happens for
                    a reason.

                                      SHANE
                    You really believe that?

                                      OLIVER
                    Well, take today, for example. 
                    Out of all the coffeeshops in all
                    the towns in all the world...

                                      SHANE
                    ...you walked into mine.

                                      OLIVER
                    Yes!  Just as everything in the
                    Dead Letter Office was originally
                    intended for another place, and
                    yet, for some Providential reason,
                    they have been misdirected. 
                      Temporarily, of course.  Not
                      unlike...you.

      Oliver taps the bulletin board of clippings behind Shane.

      ECU: three newspaper clippings from other cities have been
      carefully cut out and preserved.  "60 Year-Old Letter Arrives
      Just In Time" "Lost Letter Reunites Brothers"  "Dead Letter
      Solves Mystery of Childhood Sweethearts." Shane turns back
      and looks at Oliver with new interest.

                                      SHANE
                    You did that?

                                      OLIVER
                    No.  But it is a standard to which
                    we aspire.  Someday, we, too, shall
                    join the pantheon of postal
                      excellence.  Now:

      Oliver stares at the pile of letters, as if waiting for one
      to jump out at him.  Rita stops her work to watch this ritual. 
      Norman watches intently, crossing himself.  Shane is
      completely bewildered.  Finally, Oliver inhales, exhales,
      and solemnly reaches into the pile and pulls out...a Hallmark
      greeting card envelope hopelessly mangled.                                                                                      18.

                                      OLIVER (CONT'D)
                          (reading address)
                    First name intact.  Thomas P-E-R-
                      something.  Card has been ripped
                    by...
                          (smells it)
                    Canine.  Seattle postmark.  Looks
                    like a greeting card, tentative
                      handwriting, no return, Billie
                    Holiday commemorative...Not
                    birthday, not sympathy...I'm
                    guessing "thinking of you." Alright,
                    we're going in.

      Oliver is focused and serious as a surgeon.  He takes his
      letter opener from his pocket and carefully opens the envelope
      and removes the card.  He reads and smiles triumphantly.

                                      OLIVER (CONT'D)
                    "Let's catch up"!  Signed, "Pete". 
                    And Pete has written: "Saw this,
                    thought of you.  Dropped by 'Curios'
                      yesterday, but you were on a break
                    so..."
                          (he puts it down)
                    Norman...

                                      NORMAN
                    I'm on it.

      Norman is already pulling out the Seattle area yellow pages.

                                      SHANE
                          (re: yellow pages)
                    You do know, of course, we are in
                    the twenty-first century, right?

                                      OLIVER
                          (to Norman)
                    Look under "antique stores."
                    Possibly "gift shops"
                          (to Shane)
                    Computers do not share Norman's
                    innate ability to think outside
                    the box.  I would even suggest
                    that Norman is, in fact, unaware
                    of the box.

                                      NORMAN
                          (reading)
                    Curios Antiques!  Proprietor Thomas
                    Perkins!  P-E-R!

                                      SHANE
                      Impressive.                                                                                      19.

                                      OLIVER
                    Child's play.

      Shane picks up the card and starts to read.  Oliver snatches
      it out of his hands.

                                      OLIVER (CONT'D)
                      Unh-unh-unh!  We never, ever, ever
                    read past the point of necessity. 
                    Rita!

      He hands it to Rita, who drops it in a special post office
      forwarding envelope, seals it efficiently and drops it in
      the Outgoing Box with a flourish.

                                      SHANE
                    That's it?  Shoot, with the right
                    software, I could double your
                      efficiency in...

                                      OLIVER
                      Efficiency.  What an ugly word. 
                    There is something more at work
                    here, Sheryl.  In the beginning
                    was the word, and the word has its
                    own time and place.  In short, we
                    do not find the letters that must
                    be found today.  They find us.

      He repeats the letter-retrieval ritual.

                                      SHANE
                    But...

                                      NORMAN
                    Shhh!  It's happening!

      Oliver pulls out the PINK ENVELOPE WE SAW AT THE BEGINNING.

                                      SHANE
                    Maybe I should just find something
                    else to do while you guys...

      But Oliver's not listening.  He's staring at the envelope. 
      Norman senses a big one and waves Shane off.

                                      OLIVER
                          (with quiet intensity)
                    Norman, get out your pencil.

      INSERT: We see the smudged envelope is addressed to: Charlie
      At The Bl... 102..(damaged), Den(damaged).  The CAMERA notes
      the 2013 postmark.                                                                                      20.

                                      OLIVER (CONT'D)
                    Addressed simply to Charlie. 
                    Postmark is six weeks ago but bears
                      a forty-five cent Bicycle
                      Commemorative from 2012.  Return
                    reads simply "Kelly of Washington
                    Park."  Writer doesn't expect a
                    reply.

                                      NORMAN
                    But it's postmarked from Texas.

                                    RITA
                    There's no Washington Park in Texas. 
                    It's gotta mean Washington Park
                    here in Denver.  People ride
                    bicycles there all the time. 

                                      OLIVER
                      A sentimental stamp choice, then?
                          (feels something inside
                          the envelope)
                    And she has enclosed
                        something...something small and
                      round...Norman, a consult, please?

      He hands the envelope to Norman, who carefully touches,
      sniffs, and analyzes the envelope.

                                      NORMAN
                      Handwriting indicates a female in
                    her twenties. Generally confident
                    but recently troubled, indicated
                    by bold figures tempered by
                    tentative strokes.

                    Good quality, hand-cut linen,
                    Sherwood Stationery circa 1960.
                      Untraditional dye, most likely a
                    special color blend. This sort of
                    stuff was made to order back then
                    for the rich. The really rich.

       Shane opens her laptop and powers up.

                                      SHANE
                    Okay, I can run a list of the

                    too young...

                    is stationery she kept from her
                      grandmother's desk.  Then again,
                    it may have come from an old box
                    of stationery she bought at an
                    antique store. Too many variables
                    have left us no choice...

      Oliver slides his letter opener across the top and retrieves
      Kelly's letter.

                                      SHANE (CONT'D)
                    Or, we could just do that.

                      "September 27, 2012, Dear
                      Charlie..."  This letter is almost
                    a year old.  It just never made it
                    into the system.

                                      SHANE

                      A floater!  We've got a floater!

      He's very excited.  He pulls up a chair to listen.  Oliver
      notes the attached item.  It is a flat gold blazer button
      taped to the letter. 

                                      OLIVER
                          (begins reading)
                    "Dear Charlie.  I wanted to be
                    sure you got your button back. 
                    And I wanted to explain about last
                    night."

      Oliver sighs.                                                                                      22.

                                      OLIVER (CONT'D)
                    Oh, dear.  Another "I can explain
                      everything" apologetic replete
                    with the return of an article of
                    clothing.
                          (to Shane)
                    Letters like this are usually
                      accompanied by liberal references
                    to Jello shots and tequila.  Well,
                    here we go.

      Oliver reads quickly.  He's heard this all before.

                                      OLIVER (CONT'D)
                    "Dear Charlie, I wanted to be sure
                    you got your button back.  And I
                    wanted to explain about last night. 

      Oliver stops.  This letter is different.

                                      OLIVER (CONT'D)
                    Good heavens.

      Oliver reaches over to his wine glass.  It is empty.  He
      does the unthinkable and takes a steadying swig straight
      from the soda bottle. Rita stops everything and freezes.
      Shane forgets her laptop and sits on a nearby table to listen. 
      Norman's eyes widen.

                                      OLIVER (CONT'D)
                          (reads on)
                    "Walking away and leaving you
                    standing there in the park was the
                    hardest thing I've ever done. 
                    Except to tell you what I'm going
                    to say next. I had to leave because
                      I couldn't let you watch me
                    die....."
                          (a beat)
                    Norman, I think this is going to
                    require another Yoo-Hoo.

      Norman fetches Oliver another Yoo-Hoo as Oliver finishes off
      the one he currently has.  Everyone else sits in rapt
      attention waiting to hear the rest of the letter.  Oliver
      knocks back another Yoo-Hoo in a few gulps.  As they watch:

                                      SHANE
                          (whispers to Rita)
                    What is that stuff?

                    I once met the President of the
                    Yoo-Hoo Company on a bus trip to
                    Mexico.

      Shane processes that. Oliver is sufficiently hydrated.

                                      OLIVER
                    Now, where were we?

21BEGIN FLASHBACK:

22EXT. DENVER STREET - DAY - 2012

      We are outside a very tall office building.

                                      KELLY (V.O.)
                    "I'm really sick, Charlie, and for
                    the longest time, all I've been
                    thinking about is just trying to
                    stay alive."


      Walking into the building at a rapid pace is CHARLIE, a good-
      looking twenty-something loaded up with a large donut box                                                                                      24.

      and a carrier full of coffee.  He is in his shirt sleeves, a
      tie, and business slacks.  He enters the building. 

      The CAMERA PANS UP to the third floor and we see a beautiful
      young woman, KELLY, standing at the window looking out,
      pensive and conflicted.  She carries a professional camera
      and she takes a photo through the window of something down
      on the sidewalk.

23INT. OFFICE BUILDING - THIRD FLOOR - DAY - SAME TIME

      Kelly exits a door from an office we do not see.  Preoccupied,
      she presses the button for the elevator without checking to
      see if she's pressed UP or DOWN.  She slips her camera into
      her backpack.

      We HEAR a DING, the doors open and she steps in and stands
      next to Charlie and OTHER BUSINESS TYPES who are inside.

                                      KELLY (V.O.)
                    "And then yesterday, I stepped
                    into that elevator and there you
                    were and you made me remember the
                      difference between staying alive
                    and being alive....

24INT.  ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

      Charlie smiles.  Kelly hits the LOBBY button.

                                      CHARLIE
                          (whispers)
                    Sorry, we're going up.  Looks like
                    all the way.

                                      KELLY
                          (shrugs sadly)
                    Oh, well. Doesn't really matter.

                                      CHARLIE
                    Nice ride, though.  You get to
                    stop at all the best floors.

      She smiles.  There is instant chemistry. The elevator stops
      and the doors open to reveal an impatient, self-important
        thirty-something CAMERON.

                                      CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                          (sotto to Kelly)
                    Well, not all the best floors.

      Cameron strides in, forcing Kelly and Charlie and Others to
      the back.  Charlie juggles his coffee and donuts.                                                                                      25.

                                      CAMERON
                    Charlie, that you back there?

                                      CHARLIE
                    Morning, Mr. Cameron.

                                      CAMERON
                    You get my cinnamon cruller?

                                      CHARLIE
                    Yessir.

                                      CAMERON
                    And the Colombian supremo, not
                    that junk from Ecuador you got
                      yesterday?

      The elevator stops and lets out a few more riders who give
      Charlie a sympathetic look as they depart.  Cameron presses
      the CLOSE DOORS button relentlessly until the doors close
      and they continue up.

                                      CAMERON (CONT'D)
                    You'll never make it in mergers
                    and acquisitions if you can't even
                    take a decent coffee order, pal.

                                      CHARLIE
                      Colombian.  Got it.

      The elevator slows to the tenth floor and opens. 

                                      CAMERON
                    It better be up on the seventeenth
                    floor by the time I get there. 
                    And don't screw up like you usually
                    do. 

      Another withering comment that makes Charlie cringe.  Kelly
      watches with distaste.  Cameron steps out and holds the door
      for one last zinger.

                                      CAMERON (CONT'D)
                    I'm meeting that new VP gal today
                    and I hear she likes her donuts. 
                    God, I bet she's a pig.

                                      KELLY
                    Actually, I like bagels.  But I
                    can buy them for myself, right,
                    Charlie?

      She presses the Close Door button on a stunned and gulping
      Cameron.  Kelly waves good-bye as the elevator doors close.                                                                                      26.

                                      KELLY (CONT'D)
                      Oink-oink.

      The doors close before Cameron can respond.

                                      CHARLIE
                    You're the new vice-president?

                                      KELLY
                          (laughs)
                    No.  Do I look like a vice-
                      president?

      Charlie laughs.

                                      CHARLIE
                    No, you look beau...well, you were
                    great.

                                      KELLY
                    I hope I don't get you in trouble. 
                    I just couldn't resist.  You
                    actually work for that jerk?

                                      CHARLIE
                    Him and three more just like him.

                                      KELLY
                    Sorry to hear that. 

                                      CHARLIE
                    Well, there's something to learn
                    from everybody, even if it's what
                    not to do.

                                      KELLY
                    That's a great attitude. 

                                      CHARLIE
                          (shrugs)
                    What doesn't kill me makes me
                    stronger, right?  That and donuts,
                    of course. You want one? 

                                      KELLY
                    Thanks, but I actually DO prefer
                    bagels.  I'm supposed to stay off
                    sugar while I'm...

      She stops herself.  Fortunately, the elevator opens at
      Charlie's floor.

                                      CHARLIE
                      Seventeen.  That's me.
                                      (MORE)                                                                                      27.

                                      CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                    Hey, thanks again.  Best laugh
                    I've had all week.  Maybe all month. 
                      Maybe...all year.

      He sighs and steps out in front of a huge corporate door
      with the impressive title "MILLER, MILLER, MILLER AND
      SCHWARTZ".  Kelly instinctively stops the door.

                                      KELLY
                    Hey, Charlie? 

      Charlie is more than happy to come back.

                                      KELLY (CONT'D)
                    You deserve better. Life is short,
                    you know.

      Charlie gives her a look. 

                                      CHARLIE
                    I know, but the days are really
                    long sometimes.

      The doors begin to close.

                                      CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                    Hey!  What's your name?

                                      KELLY
                    Kelly!

      Just as the doors close a BUSINESSWOMAN catches the door and
      steps in and presses the 45th floor button.  Kelly smiles
      but the woman is too busy on her iPhone to notice.

25INT. OFFICE BUILDING - 45TH FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER

      The doors open, the Woman walks out without a word, still
      texting on her phone.  Kelly pushes the LOBBY button and
      waits for the doors to close.

26INT. ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER

      Kelly waits patiently and watches the numbers on the panel
      descend as she approaches the floor where Charlie got off -
      the seventeenth floor.  She is surprised when it stops and
      the doors open to reveal Charlie, his tie now loosened,
      wearing a blazer with gold buttons, and a backpack slung
      over his shoulder.

                                      CHARLIE
                    Hey!  Kelly!

      He jumps inside with a new look of vitality on his face.                                                                                      28.

                                      KELLY
                    Hi!  Going down?

                                      CHARLIE
                    All the way.  I just quit.

      Kelly reacts.

27EXT. BUILDING - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

      They exit together.  Charlie throws his hands up in the air
      as if just released from prison.

                                      CHARLIE
                    Free at last, free at last!

                                      KELLY
                    Was it really that bad?

                                      CHARLIE
                    It was so bad that I told myself
                    this morning if a beautiful girl
                    doesn't walk into this elevator
                    today and rescue me, I'm riding
                    all the way up to the top floor
                    and jumping off.  Donuts, coffee,
                    and all.

      Kelly deflects the compliment.

                                      KELLY
                    Columbian coffee, I hope!

                                      CHARLIE
                    "Yessir!"

                                      KELLY
                    Well, congratulations.  I hope you
                    find another job that you like.

                                      CHARLIE
                    That's tomorrow. But today, I'm
                    taking you out for a bagel.

                                      KELLY
                    Oh, I don't know...

                                      CHARLIE
                    You gotta go to work, right?

                                      KELLY
                    No, but...                                                                                      29.

                                      CHARLIE
                    Then come on!  You just saved a
                    man's life.  In some cultures that
                    makes me responsible for you.

                                      KELLY
                    Actually I think it's the other
                    way around.

                                      CHARLIE
                    Even better!  How can you say "no"
                    now?

                                      KELLY
                    But I didn't save your life.  It
                      takes...it takes a lot more than
                    that to save a life.

                                      CHARLIE
                    Are you kidding?  If it weren't
                    for you, I'd be up there right now
                    passing out crullers to Miller,
                    Miller, Miller & Schwartz.  Well,
                    not Schwartz.  He's glucose
                      intolerant.

      END FLASHBACK

28INT. INNER SANCTUM - DAY - PRESENT (2013)

      Shane, Norman, and Rita are listening raptly.

                                      OLIVER
                          (reading)
                    "The truth is, Charlie.  I don't
                    know who saved whose life that
                    day.  You may have saved mine. I
                    won't know for awhile.  But I'll
                    always cherish the day you quit
                    Miller, Miller, Miller & Schwartz
                    and..."

      Oliver abruptly stops reading and closes the letter.

                                      OLIVER (CONT'D)
                    Well, there we go.

                                      SHANE
                    Whaddya doing?  Keep going.

                                      OLIVER
                    No need.  Miller, Miller, Miller &
                    Schwartz.  Rita?                                                                                       30.

                    We send their Human Relations office
                    a Form 407B requesting the names
                    of terminations on September 26,
                    2012, with first name Charles or
                    Charlie. 

                                      SHANE
                          (ignoring him)
                    What about Kelly?  What's she dying
                    of?  Is she going to live?

                                      OLIVER
                    To read any further than necessary
                    would violate the prime directive.

                                      SHANE
                    You gotta be kidding.

                                      NORMAN
                    He's not kidding.

                                    RITA
                    We don't kid.  We're not kidders.

                                      SHANE
                    What a hypocrite.

                                      OLIVER
                    I beg your pardon?

                                      SHANE
                    You know darn well it'll take weeks
                    before some drone in HR pulls a
                    bunch of old employment records to
                    help out the U.S. Post Office. 
                      Meanwhile, Charlie is out there
                    somewhere wondering why the girl
                    of his dreams blew him off when
                    they were so obviously falling in
                    love.

                                      OLIVER
                    There's nothing in here that
                    indicates they were in love.                                                                                      31.

                                      SHANE
                      Everything in that letter so far
                    indicates they were in love.  Or
                    getting there. Right, Rita?

      Rita swallows nervously.

                                    RITA
                    I've never actually been in...
                          (she glances at Norman)
                    Well, I mean, not when the OTHER
                    person was...in it.  At the same
                    time.

      Norman is oblivious. 

                                      NORMAN
                    I read a book once on chemical
                    changes in baboons suggesting that
                    apes experience a certain emotional
                      connection similar to human love.

      Shane stares at him.

                                      SHANE
                    Thank you. Maybe you could bring
                    that in tomorrow.
                          (to Oliver, her best
                          con job)
                    Look, if there's a chance that
                    reading one more line could give
                    us a truly solid chance to redirect
                    that letter to poor Charlie, then
                    don't we owe it to him?  And to
                    Kelly.
                          (to Oliver)
                    I mean "of all the elevators in
                    all the towns in all the world..."

      Her reference to Oliver's quotation resonates with him. 
      They lock eyes and he stares at her a moment.  Then:

                                      OLIVER
                      "We?""Us?" Why, Ms. McInerney,
                    could it be that you've already
                    taken our little enterprise into
                    your heart?  That's very touching.
                    But the answer is no. 

      Oliver slides the letter into a pigeon-hole marked "PENDING"
      and turns away to other business.  Shane waits a moment, and
      then surreptitiously SLIPS THE PINK ENVELOPE INTO HER ATTACHE
      CASE.

                                      END OF ACT TWO                                                                                      32.

29INT. BAR - "THE MAILBOX" - THAT NIGHT - PRESENT (2013)

      A tiny hole-in-the-wall joint where postal workers hang out. 
      Oliver and Shane ENTER and walk to the bar.  Nearby, Rita
      sways precariously over a jukebox, feeding it quarters.

                                      SHANE
                          (to Oliver)
                    I've heard of cop bars and gay
                    bars and Mafia bars.  Never been
                    to a postal bar.

                                      OLIVER
                    Everyone needs a place to decompress
                    with their peers.  Actually, these
                    people are not my peers, but they
                    are clearly yours and I thought
                    you might enjoy it here.

                                      SHANE
                    You're a charmer.

                                    RITA
                          (calling over)
                    Hey!  You spell McInerney with an
                    M-C, right? 

                                      SHANE
                    Uh, yeah. 

                                    RITA
                      Exxxcellent!  I've got a surprise
                    for youuuuuu!

      Shane and Oliver sit at the bar.  The BARTENDER approaches.

                                      OLIVER
                    Rita is a connoisseur of the
                      carefully-crafted daiquiri.
                          (to bartender)
                    Barkeep, a gin rickey, hold the
                    rickey.

                                      SHANE
                    I'd like a Yoo-Hoo on the rocks
                    with a side car.

      The Bartender stares at her.  Oliver amused.

                                      SHANE (CONT'D)
                    Sorry, just a little postal humor. 
                    Gibson, up, very dry, please.                                                                                      33.

      A busty thirty-something ELEANOR with her postal uniform on
      but her shirt open too far approaches, her eye on Oliver.

                                      ELEANOR
                    Hello, Oliver.  Haven't seen you
                    around for awhile.

                                      OLIVER
                    Eleanor.  How are things in
                      Passports?

                                      ELEANOR
                    Oh, you know.  Everybody wants to
                    get there tomorrow.

                                      OLIVER
                    Ah. 

      Oliver doesn't pursue the conversation.  Eleanor's eyes travel
      to Shane but Oliver doesn't introduce her.  Finally:

                                      ELEANOR
                    You're that new girl from Washington
                    DC, huh?

                                      OLIVER
                    The "girls" are over in the corner
                    spilling beer on the billiard table. 
                    This lady and I have business to
                    attend to.  I'm sure you understand.

      Dismissed, Eleanor moves on.  Shane is surprised and looks
      at Oliver with a new interest. 

                                      SHANE
                          (teasing)
                    And I thought you didn't like me!

      Oliver stares at her.  Then, quite seriously:

                                      OLIVER
                    I haven't decided yet.

                                      SHANE
                    Then why did you invite me here?

      Before he can answer, Norman enters and joins them.

                                      NORMAN
                    Miller, Miller, Miller, & Schwartz
                    were sued for fraud and went out
                    of business six months ago.

                                      OLIVER
                    So much for our only lead.                                                                                      34.

                                      SHANE
                    Yeah.  And it only took eight hours.

                                      OLIVER
                    Do I detect irony?

      Oliver and Shane begin a banter that is not just professional
      tension but perhaps a hint of a sexual tension to come.

                                      SHANE
                    If I'd had that letter, I could've
                    found this Charlie guy in thirty
                    seconds.

                                      OLIVER
                    This is not a race we run, Ms.
                      McInerney.  It is a journey.

                                      SHANE
                    It's a job! You deliver one letter
                    and the next day a hundred take
                    its place.  It's a losing battle,
                    an exercise in futility.  It may
                    even be a good excuse to upgrade
                    my search engine capacity.  But
                    it's not some woo-woo spiritual
                    journey.

                                      OLIVER
                    There are more things in heaven
                    and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt
                    of in your philosophy.

                                      NORMAN
                    It's not Horatio, it's Sheryl,
                    right?

                                      SHANE
                    It's Shane!

                                      OLIVER
                    It's Shakespeare, my little
                    peasants.  Now, you may lack a
                    sense of destiny, but you have one
                    character trait that, if carefully
                      cultivated, could be helpful.  And
                    that is something I like to
                      call....curiosity.  You wanted to
                    know why we're here?

      He reaches into the outside pocket of Shane's attache case,
      removes the PINK ENVELOPE, and places it on the counter. 
      Shane is mortified.                                                                                      35.

                                      SHANE
                    I can explain.  Actually, I can't. 
                    But I haven't read it yet, so
                      technically...

                                      NORMAN
                          (scandalized)
                      Unauthorized removal!  Regulation
                    #PR34D!  That's a gross violation.

                                      OLIVER
                    Yes, it is.  But in this case, a
                      convenient one. 

      He removes the letter from the envelope.

                                      SHANE
                    I thought you never broke the rules.

                                      OLIVER
                    Well, apparently we have you to do
                    that for us.  I, however, must on
                    occasion bend the law in order to
                    fulfill the spirit of the law. 
                    Nuts?

      He offers her some from a bowl.

                                      OLIVER (CONT'D)
                    Norman.  Go retrieve Rita.  She
                    wouldn't want to miss this.

      Norman leaves and walks over to the jukebox.  Shane speaks
      to Oliver with sincerity and quietly.

                                      SHANE
                    Thank you.

                                      OLIVER
                    For what?

                                      SHANE
                    For outing me here instead of back
                    at the office in front of Andrea. 
                    I could have been...

                                      OLIVER
                      Terminated.  Yes.  Well, I try to
                    do as little in front of Andrea as
                    possible.

      Oliver takes his drink and begins walking towards a corner
      booth.  Shane follows. Norman joins them with Rita.                                                                                      36.

                                      OLIVER (CONT'D)
                    Welcome, Rita. 

      They sit in the booth.

                                      OLIVER (CONT'D)
                    Now, where were we?

                                    RITA
                          (recites)
                    "I'll always cherish the memory of
                    that day when you...."

                                      OLIVER
                    "Miller, Miller..." Here we are:
                    "...when we met and tried so hard
                    not to fall in love...."

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

30BEGIN FLASHBACK - 2012

31INT. GAYLORD BAGEL FACTORY - DAY

      Charlie and Kelly stand at a cafe table, assembling their
      bagels and lox.

                                      CHARLIE
                    There's an art to the perfect bagel
                    and lox combo.

                                      KELLY
                    I don't think I can eat raw salmon.

                                      CHARLIE
                    Think of it as sushi with bread. 
                    And onions, tomatoes, and cream
                    cheese, all the major food groups. 
                    You eat one of these, you're good
                    for the day.

                                      KELLY
                          (points)
                    And these?

                                      CHARLIE
                    Ah!  Capers! The key to the whole
                      enterprise.  The "secret sauce" of
                    bagels and lox.

                                      KELLY
                    They look like....fish eggs.                                                                                      37.

                                      CHARLIE
                    Nope.  Capers are flower buds. 
                    Little salty flower things that
                    add just the perfect balance to
                    the cream cheese.

      Kelly tries to put some one, but they roll off.

                                      KELLY
                    Uh-oh.

                                      CHARLIE
                          (building as he goes)
                    The secret is you sort of glue the
                    capers into the cheese so they
                    don't roll off.  THEN the salmon,
                    the onion, and the tomato and.... 

      He holds it out, she takes it and awkwardly takes a bite,
      getting some cream cheese on her nose.

                                      CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                    Hmm?

      Kelly nods, sort of surprised that she likes it.

                                      KELLY
                    Mmmm! 

                                      CHARLIE
                    You've got some....right
                      there...um..

      He wipes the cream cheese off her nose.

                                      CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                    Great nose, by the way.  People
                    tell you that a lot, right?  Your
                      boyfriend, probably....

      Kelly doesn't say anything.

                                      CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                    Forget that.  Too much information
                    for a first date.  This is a date,
                    right?  Sort of?

                                      KELLY
                          (hesitates, a beat,
                            then:)
                    I have a proposition.

                                      CHARLIE
                    Yes.  Whatever it is....yes.                                                                                      38.

32EXT. GAYLORD'S BAGEL FACTORY - A FEW MINUTES LATER

      They are finishing off their bagels, tossing the paper into
      a nearby trash.  Charlie is reviewing their agreement.

                                      CHARLIE
                    So, no last names.

                                      KELLY
                    Right.

                                      CHARLIE
                    No phone numbers, no addresses, no
                    "I was born here and I went to
                    school there, my boyfriend is a
                    jerk, my girlfriend married my
                      dentist...." No histories.

                                      KELLY
                    We spend one day together, say
                    whatever we want to say with no
                    fear, no judgment, because we won't
                    see each other again. 

                                      CHARLIE
                    See, that's the part I'm having
                    trouble with.

                                      KELLY
                    Think about it.  One day when you
                    don't have to worry if what you do
                    or say will affect tomorrow.  No
                    phone numbers, no texting, no
                    tweeting, no googling tomorrow. 
                    Just living right now, today.

                                      CHARLIE
                    Is this part of your "life is short
                      philosophy?"  Are you writing a
                    book and I'm one of your
                      unsuspecting subjects?  "Chapter
                    14 - Charlie Quits His Job...."

                                      KELLY
                      Philosophy, yes.  Book, no.   Are
                    you in or out?

33INT. BAR - "THE MAILBOX" - NIGHT - PRESENT (2013)

      The four are still sitting in the booth.  Oliver stops
      reading.  Shane types on her laptop.  Rita and Norman are
      listening.                                                                                      39.

                                      OLIVER
                          (ignoring them)
                    No texts, no emails, no tweets.  A
                    girl after my own heart.
                          (reading)
                    "I know I gave you a pretty crazy
                    reason for..."

                                      SHANE
                    Wait!  I've got an idea.  It's
                    sort of wild, but...

                                      OLIVER
                    Oh, happy day.

                                      SHANE
                    In the letter, they spend the day
                    together.  They go to a park, right?

                                      OLIVER
                          (re: envelope)
                    "Kelly, from Washington Park."

                                      SHANE
                    I've got a proposition.

                                      OLIVER
                    No.  Whatever it is, no.

                                    RITA
                    I think it's a great idea.

                                      NORMAN
                    How do you know what it is? 

      She whispers to Norman.

                                    RITA
                    Because I'm a woman.

                                      SHANE
                    We're looking for clues in a love
                    letter.  But maybe not all the
                    clues are going to be on the paper.
                    Let's go to the park. 

                                    RITA
                          (winks at Norman)
                    Yeah. Why read about something
                    when you can..experience it.

                                      NORMAN
                    Some of us could use a walk and a
                    little fresh air.                                                                                      40.

                                      SHANE
                    Come on, Oliver, are you in or you
                    out?

      In the b.g., Eleanor shoots a corner pocket shot and the
      corner erupts with loud screams of victory. It's not pretty.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

34EXT. WASHINGTON PARK - NIGHT - FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER

      Oliver, Shane, Norman, and Rita stand in the park, near the
      bicycle racks.  Rita has gotten a bit of a second wind.

                                    RITA
                      Washington Park, two lakes, three
                      playgrounds, six tennis courts,
                    four miles of bike paths, and ducks. 
                    Lots of ducks.

                                      SHANE
                    Now, isn't this better?  Now we
                    know what Kelly's talking about.

                                      OLIVER
                    May I continue now?

                                      SHANE
                    Read on, MacDuff. 
                          (amused)

      Oliver ignores the dig and continues.

                                      OLIVER
                          (reading)
                    "I know I gave you a pretty crazy
                    reason for only spending one day
                    together, Charlie...."

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

      BEGIN FLASHBACK - 2012

35EXT.  WASHINGTON PARK - DAY - HALF AN HOUR LATER

      Kelly and Charlie are in a beautiful park renting bikes from
      a machine.  Kelly wears her backpack and straddles a bike,
      ready to ride.  Joggers run by, people walk dogs, play
      Frisbee, etc. Kelly is taking pictures of everything.

                                      KELLY (V.O.)
                    "The truth is, I only had one day
                    to spend....                                                                                      41.

      Charlie swipes his credit card to release a second bike and
      puts the card in his wallet and his wallet in his back pocket. 
      He gets on the bike, she puts her camera in her backpack and
      they push off.

                                      KELLY (CONT'D)
                    But spending it with you made all
                    the difference."

      BEGIN MONTAGE

36EXT. PARK - MOMENTS LATER

      Kelly and Charlie ride along the bike path, past gardens, a
      playground, a fountain.  Kelly takes photos, wobbles on her
      bikes, Charlie steadies it as she shoots.

37EXT. PARK - CONTINUOUS

      They have stopped by the lake, where ducks have gathered. 
      Kelly takes a few photos as Charlie pulls something out of
      his backpack, starts tearing it apart, and tossing it to the
      ravenous ducks.

                                      CHARLIE
                      Lunchtime, guys.
                          (hands some to Kelly)
                    Here.

                                      KELLY
                    What's this?

                                      CHARLIE
                    Cameron's cinnamon cruller.  I was
                    going to eat it as a last act of
                    defiance, but now I like the thought
                    of feeding it to wild ducks, one
                    tiny piece at a time.

      Kelly laughs.

                                      KELLY
                    I'm glad to see you're not bitter.

                                      CHARLIE
                    You know, I'm not, actually.  Just
                    think, that poor guy's still back
                    there, merging and acquiring and
                      I'm....well, I'm here with you.

      They share a quiet look.  A good time to kiss, but Kelly
      breaks the spell and tosses another crumb to the ducks. 
      Charlie sees something in the distance.                                                                                      42.

                                      CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                    C'mon.  I want to show you
                      something.

38EXT. PARK BRIDGE OVER A DITCH - MOMENTS LATER

      Charlie and Kelly are standing on a bridge that spans a ditch. 

                                      CHARLIE
                    When I was in sixth grade, I walked
                    to school and I crossed this bridge
                    every day.

                                      KELLY
                    Careful.  No historical details.

                                      CHARLIE
                    I know, I know.  But see this ditch? 
                    All the other kids jumped the ditch
                    on the way to school.  They'd take
                    a running start and fly right across
                    and land over there.

                                      KELLY
                    But you took the bridge.

                                      CHARLIE
                    I tried to jump at first.  I'd run
                    right up to the edge but something
                    always made me put on the brakes
                    at the last second.  God, it was
                      embarrassing.  They'd all be
                    standing on the other side yelling
                    "Jump, Charlie.  You can do it!"

                                      KELLY
                    But...?

                                      CHARLIE
                    But I never did.  After awhile,
                    they stopped expecting me to even
                    try and then it was too late to
                    change their minds.

      Kelly is quiet.  Something he has said has resonated deeply.

                                      KELLY
                    Maybe some things are just too
                    late to fix.

      Charlie senses he's hit a nerve and breaks the mood.

                                      CHARLIE
                    Shoot, what do I know? It's never
                    too late.                                                                                      43.

                                      KELLY
                          (smiles)
                    Oh yeah?  Then jump the ditch.

                                      CHARLIE
                    What?

                                      KELLY
                    Jump! Do it today.  What are you
                    waiting for?

                                      CHARLIE
                    No way.

                                      KELLY
                          (laughing)
                    Ditch your pride.

                                      CHARLIE
                    "Ditch."  Very clever.  Okay, go
                    over there and wait.  But over to
                    the side.  Don't distract me.

                                      KELLY
                          (amused)
                    Right.

                                      CHARLIE
                    And no cameras!

                                      KELLY
                    You may want a record of this
                    someday.

                                      CHARLIE
                    Someday?  Aha!  Now if there's a
                    chance we have a "someday," THAT'S
                    worth jumping for. 

      Kelly smiles and walks down the bridge and positions herself
      to the side, near a tree.  Charlie walks a good distance
      away to give himself some running room.

                                      CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                          (to himself)
                    Okay.  I can do this.

      ANGLE ON KELLY

      She slips her camera out and stands partially covered from
      view, clicking photos.

      CAMERA POV - A SERIES OF SHUTTER CLICKS                                                                                      44.

      We see Charlie, a good distance away, turn around and prepare
      himself.  He stretches.  He takes a breath.  He starts to
      run back towards the ditch.

      He makes it!  Click, Click, Click.

                                      CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                    Yes!

      Charlie does a victory dance and runs around a little.
      Suddenly something - some ONE - runs out from a stand of
      trees, smacks into him and knocks him down.

      Kelly stops shooting and looks across. 

      KELLY'S POV - CHARLIE AND A JOGGER

      It all happens very quickly.  Charlie and the jogger are
      both on the ground.  Charlie stands and helps the jogger up. 
      Charlie seems very good-natured, laughing, dusting off the
      jogger, clearly apologizing, patting the guy on the back and
      sending him on his way.  Kelly takes a couple more pictures
      of the encounter, and we see on her face a new sense of
        appreciation for Charlie.

      Charlie walks back towards her, over the bridge. 

                                      KELLY
                    Ouch!  Are you okay?

                                      CHARLIE
                    Yeah.  Pride goeth before a fall,
                    I guess.

                                      KELLY
                    You lost a button.

                                      CHARLIE
                    A small sacrifice for making the
                    jump of a lifetime. 

                                      KELLY
                    You were awfully nice to that guy,
                      considering he knocked you down.

                                      CHARLIE
                    Well, why not?  Life is short.

      Kelly looks at him and he grins. 

                                      KELLY (V.O.)
                    I think that was the moment I
                    realized how much I wanted to live.
                                      (MORE)                                                                                      45.

                                      KELLY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    How much I needed to believe in a
                    "someday" with you in it.  Maybe
                    that's how it feels to fall in
                    love, Charlie. When you can't wait
                    for tomorrow.

      They retrieve their bikes and walk them for awhile. Charlie
      gets on his bike.  Kelly does, too, and follows him.

39EXT. PARK LAKE - DAY - LATER

      They are riding their bikes along the lake and Kelly slows
      down, running out of energy.  She works hard to hide it.

                                      CHARLIE
                          (calling back)
                    There's a great fountain up here
                    at the top.

                                      KELLY
                    Charlie, wait!

      Charlie stops and rides back to her.  Kelly parks her bike
      and sits on a nearby park bench.

                                      KELLY (CONT'D)
                    It's so pretty here. I just want
                    to take a couple of pictures.

                                      CHARLIE
                    Go for it.

      Charlie notices a newspaper left by someone on the bench. 
      He picks it up and starts folding it into a boat.

                                      CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                    So, are you a professional
                      photographer?
                          (she gives him a look)
                    Ok, how about this:...why do you
                    like to take pictures?

                                      KELLY
                    Lemme see...well, I know in some
                    cultures people think taking a
                      photograph of something is like
                    stealing a piece of its soul.  But
                    for me, taking a picture of
                    something or someone is a way to 
                    ....I don't know...honor a soul. 
                    It's my way of saying "here you
                    are, duck, here you are, sky, here
                    you are, Charlie, and before you
                                      (MORE)                                                                                      46.

                                      KELLY (CONT'D)
                    float away, I want to stop time
                    for just a moment to really see
                    you.

      Charlie doesn't look up.  He just stares at the newspaper
      boat he holds in his hand.

                                      KELLY (CONT'D)
                    What?  What are you thinking?

                                      CHARLIE
                    I'm reading this little article
                    here on the side about Rodger Piper,
                    age 61, a baker who won the lottery
                    last week.  And I bet everybody
                    thinks he's the luckiest guy in
                    the world.  And yesterday, I would
                    have thought so, too.  But today,
                    I think the luckiest guy in the
                      world...is me.

      He sets the boat adrift. Kelly takes a photo of the boat. 
      Charlie turns and looks at her and smiles.  She smiles back
      and takes a photo of him.  Click.

40EXT. SAME LAKE - PRESENT DAY - 2013

      Kelly's POV of Charlie is now Shane's POV of Oliver, who
      stands in the same place, gazing at a lake without a paper
      boat. 

      ANGLE ON SHANE

      She holds her hands up to frame what she sees.

                    On the other side of this lake
                    there is an exact replica of Martha
                      Washington's garden at Mount Vernon,
                    Virginia.  I'm a direct descendant
                    of George Washington's accountant.

                                      OLIVER
                    I don't see the purpose in
                      continuing this field trip,
                      particularly without a permission
                    slip from your mother, Norman.                                                                                      47.

                    Just a little longer, Oliver. 
                    Please. Just read a little more. 
                    There's got to be something in
                    that letter that can help us if we
                    put ourselves in Kelly and Charlie's
                    place. 

      Oliver sighs and mutters as he finds his place.

                                      OLIVER
                    I will not jump over a ditch.

                                      SHANE
                    Fine. 

                                      OLIVER
                    Tomorrow, everything goes back to
                    normal.

                                      SHANE
                    If that's what you consider normal.

                                      OLIVER

                    "I wanted to tell you everything
                    right then, Charlie....

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

41BEGIN FLASHBACK 

42EXT.  PARK LAKE - 2012

      As the boat floats off, we hear Kelly's voice continue:

                                      KELLY (V.O.)
                    "...But I didn't want to break the
                    spell.  I've always been good at
                    putting off the hard stuff..."

      Kelly sits beside Charlie as they watch the boat float away.

                                      KELLY (CONT'D)
                    I feel like we ought to do
                      something.  Something to commemorate
                    this day.  Something that makes a
                      difference.

                                      CHARLIE
                    We could get married.

                                      KELLY
                    Tempting.  But I don't marry on
                    the first date.                                                                                      48.

                                      CHARLIE
                    Good point.  Let's see....

      He sees something in the distance.  It's a Red Cross
      Bloodmobile set up near a playground.

                                      CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                    Got it! You saved my life today. 
                    Let's save some more!

      A shadow comes across Kelly's face.

                                      KELLY
                    You want to give blood?

                                      CHARLIE
                    Yeah!  It's life-affirming, you
                    get to lie down, they give you
                    cookies, and it's free!

                                      KELLY
                    I don't give blood
                      really...anymore...

                                      CHARLIE
                    C'mon.  They do it once a year
                    here in the park and it makes you
                    feel great.

                                      KELLY
                    You won't jump a ditch but needles
                    are no problem?

                                      CHARLIE
                    I know. Go figure.  I used to do
                    it all the time in college.  I
                    think I've even got my old donor
                    card here in my...

      He reaches into his back pocket, but realizes it's not there.

                                      KELLY
                    What's the matter?

                                      CHARLIE
                    My wallet. I think I've...oh, man...

      He realizes it's missing.

43EXT. NEAR THE PARK BRIDGE - DAY - MINUTES LATER

      They are walking their bikes slowly, retracing their steps,
      looking for his wallet.                                                                                      49.

                                      KELLY
                    I can't believe you lost your wallet
                    and your job on the same day.
                          (leans down to pick
                            something up)
                    Found your button though.

                                      CHARLIE
                    To be accurate, I quit my job, I
                    did lose the wallet, but I found
                    the girl of my dreams.  I think it
                    all balances out.  Except for the
                    part where I wake up tomorrow and
                    realize I lost the girl.

                                      KELLY
                    Charlie, I'm sorry.  It just...it
                    just has to be this way.

      She takes his hand and puts the button in it.

                                      KELLY (CONT'D)
                    Promise me you'll go home tonight
                    and you'll sew this button back on
                    your blazer and find yourself the
                    job of your dreams and meet somebody
                    wonderful and have lots of babies
                    and grandchildren and make dozens
                    of paper boats for them every time
                    you take them for walks in the
                    park and when you set them sailing,
                    you'll think of me.

      Charlie looks at the button and gives it back to her.

                                      CHARLIE
                    Or, you could come by tomorrow and
                    sew the button on yourself.

                                      KELLY
                          (laughs)
                    Are you telling me you can't sew?

                                      CHARLIE
                    I don't think I can do anything
                    without you now, Kelly.

      They almost kiss.  Kelly hesitates.  Charlie smiles.

                                      CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                    One more thing.  Just one more.

      He takes her hand and walks her to the nearby swingset.                                                                                      50.

                                      CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                    If you sit in this one right here...

      She does.

                                      CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                    And you swing really high....

      He pushes her again and again...

                                      CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                    And you look over the top of the
                    trees right over there, you see a
                    brick duplex with a blue door and
                    a brown door?

                                      KELLY
                    No...yes!  A blue door and a
                    chimney?

                                      CHARLIE
                    Right.

      She swings back to him and he stops her.

                                      CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                    That's where I live.  The blue
                    door.

                                      KELLY
                    You're breaking the rule.

                                      CHARLIE
                    You're breaking my heart.  Come
                    on, tell me that I'm going to open
                    my door tomorrow morning and you'll
                    be sitting on the steps.

                                      KELLY
                    Charlie, please, I have to...

      He pushes her higher.  We FOLLOW KELLY up into the air.  As
      the swing comes back down, it's now:

      END FLASHBACK

44EXT. PARK SWINGS - DAY - PRESENT TIME - 2013

      SHANE IN THE SWING IS CAUGHT BY OLIVER

      It's a surprisingly intimate moment.  They speak awkwardly.

                                      SHANE
                    ...stop.                                                                                      51.

                                      OLIVER
                    Did you see it?

                                      SHANE
                    Did I...?

                                      OLIVER
                    The blue door.

                                      SHANE
                    Oh, right.  Yes.  That must be
                    Charlie's place.  But, maybe we
                    should read just a little further. 
                    You know, just to be sure.

                                      OLIVER
                          (flustered)
                    Right.  Just to confirm.  Let's
                    see..."I can't forget the kiss on
                    the swings..."

                                      NORMAN
                    They kissed?  Right here?

                                      OLIVER
                      Apparently so, Norman.  Now..."I
                    can't forget..." Etcetera, etcetera. 
                    Here we are: "...and even though I
                    promised I'd come back, I knew I
                    couldn't. I keep imagining you
                    there on the steps by the blue
                    door, waiting for me.  And I'm
                    sorry I wasn't there. 

                                      NORMAN
                    How could she?  She promised.

                                      OLIVER
                    "...BUT I can explain. With all my
                    talk about courage, you were the
                    one who took all the big leaps
                    yesterday and now it's my turn. 
                    So today I'm going to do what I
                    have to do to get myself well.  If
                    it works, and if you still feel
                    the same way about me, let's meet
                    a year from today and we'll go on
                    a second date.  But if I'm not
                    there waiting for you at the bridge
                    at six o'clock, you'll know it's
                    only because the jump I had to
                    make was just too far.  Whatever
                    happens, Charlie, sew this button
                    on and go out into the world.
                                      (MORE)                                                                                      52.

                                      OLIVER (CONT'D)
                    I know I made the rules, and I'm
                    not going to break them now. But
                    the best way to find me if you
                    really need me someday is to just
                    remember this: life is short, but
                    it's beautiful.  Love, Kelly...

      Oliver finishes and the others are quiet.  Finally:

                                      SHANE
                    Oh, man.  What's today?

                                    RITA
                    The twenty-third.  Oh, wow. 

                                      SHANE
                    And Charlie has no idea they're
                    supposed to meet in four days.

                                      OLIVER
                    Assuming she took the leap...and
                    made it to the other side.

      Oliver takes the button out of his pocket and stares at it.

                                      END OF ACT THREE                                                                                      53.

                                            ACT FOUR

45EXT. CHARLIE'S DUPLEX - NIGHT - LATER

      The four of them stare at the blue door.

                                    RITA
                    I don't see another house on this
                    block with a blue door and a brown
                    door and a chimney.

                                      SHANE
                    So, who's going to knock?

                                      OLIVER
                    There is no knocking.  We don't
                    knock. 

                                      NORMAN
                    We go back to the office and follow
                    procedure before we get in trouble. 

                                      SHANE
                    Trouble?  You think Andrea is
                    cruising the park?  Come on, we're
                    standing right HERE!  Let's just...

      She snatches the letter from Oliver.  He snatches it back.

                                      OLIVER
                    And I thought you'd welcome the
                      opportunity to show us what that
                    fancy laptop of yours can do...

      He walks off.  She sighs and they all follow.

46EXT. U.S. MAIL REGIONAL FACILITY - DENVER - NIGHT - LATER

      A few mail trucks move in and out of the back receiving areas.

47INT. INNER SANCTUM - NIGHT - SAME TIME

      Shane types on her laptop as the others watch.  She navigates
      the street views from her screen.

                                      SHANE
                    Here's the street...Here's the
                    blue door.  There's the address
                    and the last known occupant is....

      She pulls a piece of paper off a printer as it prints out.

                                      SHANE (CONT'D)
                    Charles - Charlie - Riggs.                                                                                      54.

      Norman crosses himself and copies the address onto a form.

                                      SHANE (CONT'D)
                    I guess we can't write "good luck"
                    on the back, huh?

      Oliver is not amused.  Norman affixes the form to the back
      of the letter and hands it to Oliver.

                                      OLIVER
                    We re-address it and re-package it
                    with a form explaining why opening
                    the letter was necessary.

                                      SHANE
                    You're actually going to mail this?

                                      OLIVER
                    We've pushed the limits of protocol
                    enough already.

                                      SHANE
                    But they've only got four days!

                                      OLIVER
                    Are you questioning the efficiency
                    of this facility?

                                      SHANE
                    Well, if the envelope fits.... 
                    Besides, don't you want to know
                    how it all turns out?  Don't you
                    want to put it in his hands to
                    make sure they get together?  What
                    if the letter ends up in huge pile
                    of other mail he doesn't read until
                    Saturday?  What if it gets stuck
                    inside a Land's End catalogue? 
                    What if by some incomprehensible
                    twist of fate it takes the U.S.Post
                    Office more than four days to
                    deliver a simple letter?
                          (getting emotional)
                    And then Kelly shows up and she
                    waits and waits and waits but he
                    never comes and she's just left
                    standing there on that bridge
                    wondering how could he just leave
                    her there when she said she loves
                    him so much...?

      Oliver realizes this is personal to Shane. He speaks gently.                                                                                      55.

                                      OLIVER
                    We are the United States Post
                    Office.  We cannot play God.

                                      SHANE
                    We do that already.  What if you'd
                    pulled out a green envelope this
                    morning instead of this pink one? 
                    It's all a crapshoot anyway.

                                      OLIVER
                    When you have been in this business
                    as long as I have, Ms. McInerney,
                    you will discover that it is a
                    Hand greater than mine that pulls
                    out a dead letter and revives it.

                                      SHANE
                    Great.  So it's a spiritual
                      crapshoot.

      Norman hands the letter to Rita who ceremoniously stamps the
      letter with a large rubber stamp.  They preside over this
      procedure with the solemnity of a funeral.  Finally, Oliver
      slips the PINK ENVELOPE into its new post office sleeve. 
      They follow him out of the Inner Sanctum.

                                      OLIVER
                    We may never know the whole truth
                    about a letter or what happens to
                    it once it leaves us, but we are
                      responsible for what little truth
                    we can glean from it and to give
                    it every chance to find its intended
                    reader...

48INT. U.S. MAIL REGIONAL FACILITY - NIGHT

      It is quiet, with a skeleton CREW working in the b.g. Oliver
      stops in front of the SORTING MACHINE.

                                      OLIVER
                    And tomorrow the truth will be
                    delivered to Mr. Riggs, a year
                    late...Or right on time.

      He tosses the PINK ENVELOPE into the great, moving maw of
      sorters and rollers and it disappears into its future.

                                      OLIVER (CONT'D)
                    But it's not up to us anymore.

      Shane is clearly disappointed.

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:                                                                                      56.

49EXT. ESTABLISHING POST OFFICE - DAY - THE NEXT DAY

50INT. INNER SANCTUM - SAME TIME

      Norman works industriously, Rita strangely sorts as usual.
      Shane gazes at the wall of sorting baskets, trying to figure
      something out.  The CAMERA PANS across the baskets, each of
      which are labelled CANADA, EUROPE, SOUTH AMERICA, AFRICA,
      MIDDLE EAST, ASIA, ANTARCTICA, AUSTRALIA and finally and
      incongruously: PARIS.  Shane frowns.

                                      SHANE
                    Norman.  Why does Paris get its
                    own basket?

      Norman freezes.

                                      SHANE (CONT'D)
                    Norman?

                                      NORMAN
                    Any correspondence from Paris must
                    be separated and given to Oliver.

                                      SHANE
                    Why?

                                    RITA
                    Nobody knows.  But every time a
                    dead letter comes through with a
                    Parisian postmark, you'd think
                    he'd found gold, until...

                                      SHANE
                    Until?

                                    RITA
                    Until he gets that tragic look on
                    his face that says..."No, this
                    isn't it."  Whatever "it" is.

                                      NORMAN
                    I think it's a lottery ticket he
                    mailed to himself.

                                    RITA
                    From Paris?  Nah, it's something
                    else.  Something...deep.

                                      SHANE
                    Is Oliver...married? 

      Before Rita can answer, the door opens and Andrea enters
      carrying a mailbag.  They immediately drop the subject.                                                                                      57.

                                      ANDREA
                    Norman, where's Oliver?

                                      NORMAN
                    On the floor.

                                      ANDREA
                    I was just on the floor.  He's not
                    there.

                                      NORMAN
                    Maybe he's on the floor...somewhere
                    else?

                                      ANDREA
                    Listen, you little pipsqueak.  The
                    time's they are a'changin' and
                    you'd better decide who you work
                    for around here.

                                      NORMAN
                          (thinks hard)
                    The United States Government?

                                      ANDREA
                          (disgusted)
                    I got a new bag from Kansas City
                    DLO.  Get 'em processed before the
                    decade's over, will ya?
                          (to Shane)
                    By the way, that transfer you put
                    in for?  Gonna take ten weeks.

      She drops the bag and exits. 

                                      NORMAN
                    Ten weeks?!  That's enough time to
                      re-organize the Graceland bins!

      Shane is frustrated.  She starts to pack up her laptop.

                                      SHANE
                    I can't believe this.  

                                    RITA
                          (to cheer Shane up)
                    Hey, guess what!  Remember what I
                    told you last night?  About a
                    surprise?

                                      SHANE
                    The last twenty four hours have
                    been nothing but surprises.  But
                    go on.                                                                                      58.

                                    RITA
                    Well, I KNEW I'd seen your name
                    before.  On a letter.  A dead letter
                    entered the system fourteen months
                    ago, postmarked April 28, that's
                    two days before your birthday.

                                      SHANE
                    How do you know that?

                                    RITA
                    I read your file, remember? So
                    it's probably a birthday card. 

                                      SHANE
                    Where is it?

                                    RITA
                    I mailed it to you.

                                      SHANE
                    You what?  I work here.  You
                    could've just handed it to me.

      Oliver enters.

                                      OLIVER
                    Standard procedure, Ms. McInerney.

                                      SHANE
                      Procedure?!  That's my birthday
                    card from...who was it from?

                                    RITA
                    Return address obscured.

                                      SHANE
                    Then where did you mail it?

                                    RITA
                    To here.  Care of Dead Letters.

                                      SHANE
                    You people are crazy.

                                      OLIVER
                    A popular theory.  Coffee?

                                      SHANE
                    Your coffee is swill and this job
                    is a dead-end.                                                                                      59.

                                      OLIVER
                    The coffee, I grant you, could
                    improve.  But I take exception to
                    your disparagement of this office.

                                      SHANE
                    Ooohh!  I disparaged the U.S. Postal
                    System!  Shocker!  Wake up!  Nobody
                    writes letters anymore.  You'll be
                    out of a job in three years.  I,
                    however, am escaping right now.

      She grabs her laptop and exits.  Rita and Norman are stunned. 
      Oliver looks at them and sighs.

51EXT. STREET - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

      Shane is marching down the street.  She is suddenly aware
      that a car is slowly following her.  She stops and looks.

      ANGLE ON OLIVER

      He is at the wheel of a vintage Astin Martin.  He stops. 
      She keeps walking. He rolls down the window.

                                      OLIVER
                    Can I offer you a ride to your
                    next career?

                                      SHANE
                    No. 

                                      OLIVER
                    A moment of your time, then.

                                      SHANE
                    Nobody drives an Astin Martin except
                    James Bond.

                                      OLIVER
                    I will take that as a compliment. 

                                      SHANE
                    You're not changing my mind, Oliver. 
                    The US Post Office is a dinosaur,
                    there's no future for me there and
                    I should have stayed in DC and
                    taken that Digital Analysis job at
                    the IRS.

      He stops the car, leaves it running in the street, and walks
      over to her.  She stops and groans.                                                                                      60.

                                      OLIVER
                    Maybe you're right; electronic
                    thought has taken over the world. 
                    We can e-mail and text faster than
                    we can think.  People are hired
                    and fired and destroyed
                      electronically every minute. 
                      Abbreviated words fly about
                      cyberspace like confetti.  Even as
                    we speak some future captain of
                    industry is texting BTW OMG TTFN. 
                    That is our future.  But a year
                    ago, maybe five, or perhaps thirty
                    years ago, someone wrote a letter
                    with real words and more than two
                    seconds of thought behind them. 
                    And we are living in THEIR future. 
                    Think about it, Ms. McInerney. 
                    There are thousands and thousands
                    of letters back there, each one a
                    voice from the past, waiting to be
                    heard.  And it will take a lifetime
                    to accomplish that.  But it will
                    be worth it.  And if you disagree,
                    then why are you so upset that you
                    don't have a birthday card you 
                    didn't even know existed five
                    minutes ago?

      She stares at him. 

                                      OLIVER (CONT'D)
                    There's something special about
                    you, Ms. McInerney.  I've seen it
                    before. An instinct.  A certain
                      compassion for the lost soul behind
                    the lost letter.  It's what made
                    you steal Kelly's letter to Charlie.

      Shane hesitates.  He's right, but he's hit a nerve.

                                      SHANE
                    I don't care about Kelly and I
                    couldn't care less about her and
                    her letter.  I quit.  

      She walks off, leaving him on the sidewalk.

                                      OLIVER
                    Shane!  Come back, Shane!
                          (realizing.  He said
                          it)
                    ....Oh, dear.                                                                                      61.

52EXT. PARK SWINGS - DAY - LATER

      Shane is sitting on the swings, deep in thought.  She pushes
      off and tries to get high enough to see Charlie's house over
      the trees.  She can't.  She gives up, stands, and walks off
      in the direction of Charlie's place. 

53EXT. CHARLIE'S DUPLEX - MINUTES LATER

      Shane walks around the corner and looks at the house with
      the blue and brown doors and then realizes that parked across
      the street is Oliver's car.  He stands outside, leaning
      against it, waiting for her with two cups of Starbuck's in
      his hand.  She sighs and walks over.

                                      SHANE
                    Really?

                                      OLIVER
                    I allowed fifteen minutes to walk
                    to the park, factored in another
                    ten for aimless wandering, which
                    allowed me twenty five minutes to
                    order your skinny vanilla latte
                    and deliver it still hot by the
                    time you showed up.

                                      SHANE
                    And you think I'm that predictable.

                                      OLIVER
                    I think you're that invested in
                    your work.  And an employee with
                    that much commitment cannot be
                    allowed to self-terminate.  Or
                    drink sub-standard swill, for that
                    matter.

      He hands her a cup.  She leans against the car.

                                      SHANE
                    Thanks.

                                      OLIVER
                    My pleasure. Shouldn't be long,
                    now. Mailman is right around the
                    corner.

                                      SHANE
                    Kind of exciting.  I mean, in five
                    minutes he could be opening up
                    that letter and realizing he has a
                    date on Friday with the love of
                    his life.                                                                                      62.

                                      OLIVER
                    Or, perhaps he has since met a
                    waitress from Hooters and is
                    expecting twins and taken up work
                    as a grouter of bathroom tile.

                                      SHANE
                    No chance.  Not him.  Not Charlie.

      Oliver nods in the direction of an approaching MAILMAN.

      ANGLE ON MAILMAN

      He walks up the steps.  He places some mail in Box A by the
      brown door, then turns to the blue door, hesitates, then
      finally places the pink envelope in Box B and walks away.

      ANGLE ON SHANE AND OLIVER

                                      SHANE (CONT'D)
                            (mesmerized)
                    There it is.

                                      OLIVER
                    Once again, civilization prevails.

      He opens the car door, preparing to drive off.

                                      SHANE
                    Wait!  We have to see him get...

      She stops as a busty RED-HAIRED 40ish WOMAN in a tight skirt
      and heels steps out from the brown door to retrieve her mail. 
      She notices the pink envelope and grabs that, too, and re-
      enters her house.

                                      SHANE (CONT'D)
                    What is she doing?

      Alarmed, Shane takes off across the street to the duplex.

                                      OLIVER
                    Miss McIn...erney...

      It's took late.  Shane is walking up the steps and knocking
      on the brown door.

      THE BROWN FRONT DOOR

      The door opens and the Red-Haired Woman answers.

                                      WOMAN
                    Hi.                                                                                      63.

                                      SHANE
                    Hello.  I...um...I'm from the United
                    States Postal Service.  I am a
                    systems consultant for direct line
                      operations.
                          (she flashes her ID)
                    I'm conducting a...mail
                      investigation.

                                      WOMAN
                    You wanna investigate my mail.

                                      SHANE
                    I'm investigating the unauthorized
                      co-mingling of correspondence
                    between shared postal destinations.

                                      WOMAN
                    I don't get it.

                                      SHANE
                    You just removed an envelope from
                    that mailbox.

                                      WOMAN
                    So?  You don't have to make a
                    federal case out of it.

                                      SHANE
                    Actually, mail theft is a federal
                    case, ma'am.

                                      WOMAN
                    I wasn't stealing it.  I was sending
                    it back.  The guy's been gone for
                    months and I don't think he's coming
                    back.

      She hands the letter to Shane.  Shane looks at and blanches.

                                      SHANE
                    I'm going to have to confiscate
                    this. 

                                      WOMAN
                      Confiscate away, honey. 

      The Woman goes back inside and Shane walks numbly back to
      Oliver's car. 

                                      OLIVER
                    What are you doing with that letter. 
                    You can't just...                                                                                      64.

                                      SHANE
                    Read it.

      Oliver takes the letter and reads the words that the Red-
      Haired Woman scrawled across the front:

      INSERT ENVELOPE:

      "IN JAIL. RETURN TO SENDER."

      Oliver sighs deeply and looks at Shane.  She is devastated.

54INT. INNER SANCTUM - DAY - A FEW MINUTES LATER

      Shane is setting up her laptop.

                                      NORMAN
                    What do you mean he's in jail?

                                      SHANE
                    I mean his neighbor wrote return
                    to sender on the envelope, which
                    would have put a letter with no
                    return address back into the system.

                                      NORMAN
                    You intercepted the letter at the
                    point of delivery?

                                      SHANE
                    Yep.

                                      NORMAN
                          (crosses himself)
                      Regulation 4D1278! Dear God in
                    Heaven.  And you allowed this?

                                      OLIVER
                    Well, twenty-five minutes earlier
                    she had tendered her resignation,
                    so technically she had yet to be
                      reinstated as a government servant.

                                      SHANE
                    I mean it's sheer luck I was there
                    at just the right time to intercept
                    it.

                                      OLIVER
                    Luck is the religion of the lazy.

      Rita enters carrying a card and eating a sandwich.                                                                                      65.

                                    RITA
                    Guess what? I found it.  Stopped
                    it just in time. Your card.

      She presents Shane with her overdue birthday card.  Shane
      stares at the handwriting and the postmark.  They watch. 

                                      NORMAN
                    From your dad, right?  Parents
                    write out full names and the
                      handwriting is male, late forties,
                    early fifties. 

      Shane stares at it, then puts it in her purse unopened.

                                      NORMAN (CONT'D)
                    Aren't you going to open it?

                                      SHANE
                    Later, maybe.  I gotta find Charlie

                    Charlie.  I knew there was something
                    fishy about that guy.

                    What?

                                    RITA
                    I think I read something about...
                    Oh, no...

                                      SHANE
                    What?

                                    RITA
                    The baker.  The guy who won the
                    lottery last year?  He was murdered
                    by a guy named Charlie Riggs.

55INT. INNER SANCTUM DLO - CONTINUOUS

      Rita's announcement has brought everything to a halt.

                                      SHANE
                    What are you talking about?

                                    RITA
                    I read an article about the baker
                    in Park Hill who was going to give
                    all his lottery money to the
                    orphanage up in Loreto Heights
                    where he grew up. They said he was
                    a great guy, a real self-made man
                    and he always gave cookies to the
                    kids on Fridays after school, but
                    then Charlie...

                                      SHANE
                    Not Charlie...

                                    RITA
                      ...Somebody, some guy held up his
                    bakery and the baker got shot
                    and.....  

      They are silent.

                                      SHANE
                    What else?

                                    RITA
                    That's all I ever read.  It was
                    just too sad.  I didn't want to
                    read any more.

      Shane turns back to her laptop. 

                                      SHANE
                    Well, I don't believe it.  It
                    couldn't be our Charlie.

                                      OLIVER
                    He is not "our Charlie."  And if
                    it's true, then perhaps Kelly made
                    the right decision to walk away
                    that day.

                                      SHANE
                    I can't believe you said that.                                                                                      67.

                    I know how much you wanted to see
                    those two find happ...

                                      SHANE
                    Okay, here it is:
                          (reads)
                    "Denver police officers arrested

                      Washington Park duplex two hours
                    after the shooting." 

                                    RITA
                    Oh, no. It is our Charlie.

      ANGLE ON SHANE'S LAPTOP

      We SEE a mug shot of a very sad Charlie.

                                      NORMAN
                    He's not bad-looking.

                                      OLIVER
                    Well, there it is.

      Shane types some more and pulls up a television news clip.

      ANGLE ON SHANE'S LAPTOP

      BEGIN VIDEO

      We see a local newsperson interviewing a detective.

                                      NEWSPERSON
                      "Detective Arthur Kimsey of the
                    Denver Police Department said it
                    was the shortest murder
                      investigation in his twelve years
                    on the force."

      We SEE the DETECTIVE on screen with chryon underneath.                                                                                      68.

                                      DETECTIVE
                    "We just went to his house and
                    waited for him to come home!"

      We SEE police escorting a handcuffed Charlie along a prep
      walk.

                                      NEWPSERSON
                      "According to Detective Kimsey,
                    Riggs was easily apprehended because
                    the alleged gunman not only matched
                    the description of the shooter by
                    several witnesses, but in his haste
                    to escape the scene, he dropped
                    his wallet and identification,
                    leaving them behind...."

      END VIDEO

      Shane stops the video and shakes sighs deeply.

                                      NORMAN
                    Kelly never mentioned anything in
                    the letter about him being clumsy.

                                      OLIVER
                    Or homicidal.

                                      SHANE
                    Hush! 
                          (typing again)
                    When was this?

                                    RITA
                    About a year ago.  This month, I
                    think....
                          (realizing)
                      Oh....wow!

                                      SHANE
                          (reads, thrilled)
                    Oliver!  It happened a year ago on
                    the twenty-sixth.

                                      OLIVER
                          (it dawns on him)
                    Aha!  Oh, me of little faith!

                                      NORMAN
                    What's going on?

                                      SHANE
                    Norman!  Don't you see?  It couldn't
                    have been Charlie!
                                      (MORE)                                                                                      69.

                                      SHANE (CONT'D)
                    He was with Kelly that day!  All
                    day!  And remember?  He lost his
                    wallet!  Whoever found his wallet
                    was probably the same guy who shot
                    the baker.

                                    RITA
                    He's taller than I imagined.

                                      NORMAN
                    I was in a jail once.  I was
                    visiting my cousin.  He was doing
                    ten days in Quartzite, Arizona for
                      cow-tipping.

      Shane is typing again, searching for something.

                                      SHANE
                    Stop talking, Norman.  And I mean
                    that from the bottom of my heart.
                          (she sees something)
                    Oh, no....

      Shane sits back as Oliver reads a headline she's pulled up.

                                      OLIVER
                    "Riggs Faces Life in Lottery Winner
                      Shooting."  He goes to trial next
                    week. 

                                      SHANE
                    What are we going to do? 

                                      OLIVER
                    We're going to re-address the letter
                    and send it to Charlie care of the
                    County Jail.

                                      SHANE
                    That's it?  But he needs our help.

                                      OLIVER
                    Clearly, he needs someone's help. 
                    His lawyer, for example.  The U.S.
                    Postal System, however, is not in
                    the business of defending murderers.

                                    RITA
                    He's not a murderer.

                                      SHANE
                    And if we know that, we have to do
                    something about it.                                                                                      70.

                                      OLIVER
                    The truth is, we know nothing beyond
                    what is in this letter.  In fact,
                    we most likely know far less. 
                    Perhaps it's time to put that
                    healthy sense of curiosity back to
                    good use into your paying job before
                    it gets us all arrested.

      Shane points to what she's done on the laptop.

                                      SHANE
                    Voila!

      They look and suddenly they are looking at an unpleasantly
      vivid picture of JERRY POPOVICH, 30ish, fat, and wearing an
      obnoxious cowboy hat.

                                      OLIVER
                    What is this?

                                      SHANE
                    This is Jerry Popovich, Charlie's
                    public defender.  And this is his
                    Facebook page.

      Oliver looks at it. Rita starts passing out Yoo-Hoo bottles
      as they settle in to watch.

                    Look at that.  In the last twelve
                    months, Popovich has only spent
                    fourteen hours on Charlie's case.

                    pursuit of justice.

                                      NORMAN
                    I could have told you that.  Did
                    you see the cowboy hat he's wearing? 
                    It's a low grade blend of felt and

                                      OLIVER
                    That's an unfair snapshot of a man
                    under considerable pressure.  Enough
                      regulations have been "reconfigured"
                    today.  I suggest we let Charlie's
                    chips fall where they may.

                                      SHANE
                    Who's playing God now?  Look, the
                    other day you said that we need to
                    be responsible for what little
                    truth we have.  And the truth is,
                    Charlie Riggs is innocent.

                                      OLIVER
                    Possibly.

                                      SHANE
                    We can prove it.

                                      OLIVER
                    Possibly.                                                                                      72.

                                      SHANE
                    Possibly, probably. It's our moral
                      obligation to at least try. 

                                      OLIVER
                    What are you proposing?

                                      SHANE
                    If we send the letter to Charlie,
                    all he can do is hand it over to
                    Jerry the idiot lawyer who's gonna
                    lose it or spill ketchup on it. 
                    But if we deliver the letter in
                    person, maybe there's something
                    Charlie can tell us that we can do
                    to help.  He needs this letter,
                    Oliver, he needs to keep that date
                    with Kelly, and he needs help. I
                    know, it's risky, but sometimes
                    you just have to take the leap. 

                                      OLIVER
                    It's a compelling proposition....

                                      SHANE
                    Think about it.  My computer skills,
                    Rita's memory, your talents as a
                    postal detective, and Norman's...
                    expertise in handwriting and special
                      materials. We're talking the Delta
                    Force here, Oliver.

        A breathless Norman smiles proudly. 

                                      NORMAN
                    Like secret agents?

                                      SHANE
                          (winks to Oliver)
                    We even have James Bond's car.

                                      NORMAN
                    I applied to the CIA once.

                                    RITA
                    No kidding? Me too!  But they
                    wouldn't let me in.  I memorized
                    all the license plates in the
                    parking lot, though.

                                      NORMAN
                    We'd have to have a name.  All the
                    good secret agent teams have names.                                                                                       73.

                                      OLIVER
                      Hmmm...There's the problem of
                    Andrea, of course.  She'll want to
                    know what we're up to.

                                      SHANE
                    We're fact-gathering to ensure the
                    delivery of letters that require
                    very special handling. 

                                      OLIVER
                    She could take away my refrigerator.

                                    RITA
                    He really hates that.

                                      SHANE
                    We'll be flying under the radar.
                    Think of it as a covert division
                    of postal intelligence.

                                      OLIVER
                    Postal intelligence...We certainly
                    are that already, I suppose.

                                      NORMAN
                    But we still need a name.  Like
                    the Mission Impossible Force.  Or
                    the Avengers.  Or The Incredibles.

                                      OLIVER
                    Alright, Norman.  How about...The
                    Post... The Postables. Would that
                    make you happy?

                                      NORMAN
                            (envisioning it all)
                    "The Postables.  A License To
                    Deliver!"  I love it!

                                      SHANE
                    Then it's official.
                          (lifts her Yoo-hoo)
                    To...The Postables!

      They raise their Yoo-Hoos to their future.

                    The Postables.

56INT. GENERAL MAIL ROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

      Andrea walks through the mail room in her usual bad mood.

57INT. INNER SANCTUM - DAY - SAME TIME

      Oliver is going over a checklist as Shane is packing up her
      laptop. Norman is peeking through a crack in the door out to
      the main floor.

                                      OLIVER
                    Alright, final checks.  Laptop.

                                      SHANE
                    Check.

                                      OLIVER
                      Trenchcoat.  Check.

                                      NORMAN
                    Here she comes!

      They take their places as the door opens. Andrea barrels in.

      ANDREA'S POV

      It appears that no one is in the room except Rita.

                                      ANDREA
                    Where's Oliver?

                                    RITA
                    Good morning, Andrea.

      Andrea notices a shuffling behind some bags.  She kicks them. 

                                      ANDREA
                    Norman!

      He stands up, terrified.

                                      ANDREA (CONT'D)
                    What in the name of Paul Revere
                    are you doing?

                                      NORMAN
                    Sorting.  Forwarding.  The usual.

      Oliver and Shane tiptoe out from behind the door and out of
      the office, unseen by Andrea.                                                                                       75.

                                      ANDREA
                    Tell Oliver I want to see him in
                    my office pronto.

                                    RITA
                    Pronto may be difficult.

                                      ANDREA
                    What are you talking about?

                                    RITA
                    Oliver went home.  He got hold of
                    a bad piece of fish last night.

                                      ANDREA
                    Then send that other one.

                                    RITA
                    That could be a problem.  Same
                    dinner.  Same fish.

                                      ANDREA
                    I want one of them at that meeting. 
                    And nobody goes home sick unless I
                    send them home sick.

      She stomps out.   

                                    RITA
                    You can breathe now, Norman.

58EXT.  COUNTY JAIL - DAY - LATER

      Oliver and Shane get out of the Astin Martin.  Oliver wears
      a tie, a jacket, and his trenchcoat.  He carries his
      briefcase.  Shane carries her own briefcase.

59INT. COUNTY JAIL VISITATION LOBBY - DAY - CONTINUOUS

      Shane and Oliver enter.  They walk to the WATCH COMMANDER at
      the desk.

                                      SHANE
                    We have an attorney client
                      consultation with prisoner Charles
                    Riggs.

                                      WATCH COMMANDER
                    I.D. 

      Oliver and Shane provide their I.D.  They watch nervously as
      the Commander checks his computer.  He frowns.                                                                                      76.

                                      WATCH COMMANDER (CONT'D)
                    I don't see your names on today's
                    list.

                                      OLIVER
                    What list is that?

                                      WATCH COMMANDER
                    Client Counsel Appointment Roster.

      Shane pulls out her computer and starts typing furiously.

                                      SHANE
                    The Client Counsel Appointment
                    Roster?  I swear I put our names
                    on that yesterday.

                                      WATCH COMMANDER
                    You would've had to do it last
                    Thursday.

                                      SHANE
                    Yes, Thursday.  I put our names on
                      there...Thursday.  For today.

                                      OLIVER

                            time)
                    Thursday.  That was a lovely day,
                    wasn't it?  Virtually cloudless. 

                                      SHANE
                    Do you mind checking again?

      WATCH COMMANDER

      He presses a few more buttons.

                                      WATCH COMMANDER
                    Okay.  There you are.  But I don't
                    show you as attorney-of-record.

                                      OLIVER
                    You are referring, of course, to
                    Jerry Popovich.  A fine fellow,
                    I've always been pleased with his
                    work.  Sadly, however, he inhaled
                    one too many Mile High roast beef
                      sandwiches last week and has been
                    put on administrative leave until
                    his stomach returns to its original
                      dimensions.                                                                                      77.

                                      WATCH COMMANDER
                          (chuckles)
                    Yeah, Jerry does like his subs. 

      He hands them two badges.

60INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - JAIL - MINUTES LATER

      Oliver and Shane nervously await Charlie's arrival.  Shane
      sets up her laptop as if ready to take notes. 

      The door opens and Charlie enters in handcuffs, accompanied
      by a GUARD who sits him on a chair and leaves the room but
      watches from a window.  Charlie stares at them.

                                      SHANE
                    Hi, Charlie.

                                      CHARLIE
                    Do I know you?

                                      OLIVER
                    No, Charlie, you do not know us. 
                    But we are here to help you. 

                                      CHARLIE
                          (relieved)
                    Finally.  You're from The Colorado
                    Legal Aid Association, right?

                                      OLIVER
                    Actually, we're from the Post
                    Office.

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

61INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM - JAIL - MINUTES LATER

                                      CHARLIE
                          (reads)
                    "Whatever happens, Charlie, sew
                    this button on and go out into the
                    world.  I know I made the rules,
                    and I'm not going to break them
                    here. But the best way to find me
                    if you really need me someday is
                    to just remember this: life is
                    short, but it's beautiful.  Love,
                    Kelly..."

      Charlie wipes tears from his face.

                                      CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                    I knew something was wrong.
                                      (MORE)                                                                                      78.

                                      CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                    She would've come forward and spoken
                    up for me if she could've.  But
                    she's sick, I guess, huh?

                                      OLIVER
                    It appears that way.

                                      CHARLIE
                    Nobody would believe me.  Not the
                    police, not the District Attorney,
                    not even my own lawyer. They all
                    thought I made her up.

                                      SHANE
                    Well, you've got proof now.

                                      CHARLIE
                    Only proof that she loved me.  I
                    can't prove anything else about
                    that day without her and the
                    pictures she took. 

                                      SHANE
                    Did she take any pictures of you?

                                      CHARLIE
                    I think so.

                                      OLIVER
                    All you need is one that places
                    you there.  Perhaps one of you
                    near the Bloodmobile that only
                    comes to the park...

                                      CHARLIE
                    Once a year!  That'd be perfect.

                                      SHANE
                    So, on Friday, you ask her!  Or, I
                    mean, I guess, somebody should...

                                      CHARLIE
                    Look, I know it's a lot to ask,
                    but...

                                      SHANE
                    Of course we'll go.  Friday, on
                    the bridge, we'll meet her and
                    we'll let you know as soon as we
                    get the pictures.

                                      CHARLIE
                    Just let me know that she's okay.                                                                                      79.

      Shane and Oliver are touched.  Charlie's a good guy.

                                      CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                    I wish I knew what was wrong with
                    her.

                                      OLIVER
                    We can make some discrete inquiries. 
                    Is there anything you can tell us
                    about her that wasn't in the letter?

                                      CHARLIE
                    Well, I remember thinking when she
                    got on the elevator that she had
                    these beautiful sad eyes. 

                                      SHANE
                          (gets an idea)
                    What floor was that?  When she got
                    on the elevator.

                                      CHARLIE
                    Um...it was...the fourth floor.

                                      SHANE
                    In the Colorado Bank Building?

      Shane starts to frantically type.

                                      CHARLIE
                    Yeah, why?

                                      SHANE
                    Here it is. "Western States Advanced
                    Research Systems, a state of the

                                      CHARLIE
                    Oh, my God.

                      participated in an experimental
                    treatment there last year.

                                      SHANE
                    I'm on it. 

                                      OLIVER
                    She's very thorough.

      CHARLIE AND OLIVER WAIT PATIENTLY                                                                                      80.

                                      SHANE
                    Medical records, always tough.

                                      CHARLIE
                    I tried to find her on the internet
                    here, too.  I tried every version
                    of "Kelly" I could think of.  I
                    tried Facebook and The Missed
                      Connections on Craigslist. 

                                      SHANE
                    Okay. I'm in.  September 26 last
                    year they finalized their control
                    list of forty patients with Stage
                    3B Hodgkins Lymphoma and started
                    trials the next day...But they
                    only use first names...Jack D. 
                    Jason M.  Karl W, Kelly!  Kelly S. 
                    Bingo. How old do you think Kelly
                    is?

                                      CHARLIE
                    Twenty two, twenty three maybe?

                                      SHANE
                          (reads)
                    Kelly S.  Date of birth....she's
                    twenty two.  We've got her. Now
                    let's see how she's doing....

      Shane types. Shakes her head.  Tries something else.

                                      CHARLIE
                    What's the matter?

                                      SHANE
                    They ran the actual trials in
                    Cheyenne and all the clinical
                    records were sent up there.  I can
                    only get the double-blind results
                    from August..Okay, here they...

      Shane just stares at them and finally sits back in her chair.

                                      CHARLIE
                    What?  How's she doing?

      Shane can't speak.  Oliver reads the words on the screen.

                                      OLIVER
                    "The 2012 clinical trial commencing

                                      CHARLIE
                      I don't..I..what does that mean?

                                      OLIVER
                    Charlie, I think it means she's
                    gone.

      Charlie stares sadly at the blazer button in his hand.

62INT. INNER SANCTUM - NIGHT - LATER

      Oliver, Shane, Rita, and Norman sit silently, grieving.

                                      NORMAN
                    What do we do now?

                                    RITA
                    We can still...

                                      OLIVER
                    No.  We tried, and it's over.

                                      SHANE
                    But we didn't try hard enough. 
                    The pictures have to be out there
                      somewhere.  If we could just...

                                      OLIVER
                    We did our best.  But the truth
                    is, we are only postal employees
                    and we need to get back to doing
                    what we know how to do and let
                    poor Charlie grieve for Kelly.

                                      SHANE
                    And fight for his life.

      Andrea enters.

                                      ANDREA
                    Gotten over the bad fish, I see.

                                      OLIVER
                    Oh, Andrea, yes.  We're feeling
                    much better, aren't we, Ms.
                      McInerney? 

                                      SHANE
                    Yeah. It's a miracle.

                                      OLIVER
                    Forgive me for not keeping you in
                    the loop, Andrea.                                                                                      82.

                                      ANDREA
                    Oh, yeah.  I really missed being
                    in your loop.  Too bad you weren't
                    in mine. You missed the meeting. 

                                      OLIVER
                    And I deeply regret that.  It won't
                    happen again.  

                                      ANDREA
                    You're darn right it won't happen
                    again 'cause there ain't gonna be
                    another department meeting again. 
                    Ever.

                                      OLIVER
                    I beg your pardon?

                                      ANDREA
                    That's right.  They're shutting
                    the place down. This lousy branch
                    has - what did they call it?  -
                    "lost its viability." 

                                      OLIVER
                    The Dead Letter Office is...dead?

                                      ANDREA
                    This time next month, you'll all
                    be selling stamps and sorting
                      catalogues in Byers or Pueblo maybe. 
                    Meeker, if you're lucky!
                          (to Shane)
                    You wanted a transfer?  Well, you're
                    gonna get one, missy.  How's THAT
                    for being in the loop?

      Andrea walks out and slams the door.  They all stand in shock.

                                      END OF ACT SIX                                                                                      83.

63INT. BAR - "THE MAILBOX" - THAT NIGHT 

      The gang sits together at the bar, silent and dejected.  

                                    RITA
                    This has been a very bad day.

                                      NORMAN
                    I thought we were a pretty good
                    team, holding down the fort.

                                    RITA
                          (taking a risk)
                    You wanna dance?

      Norman looks as if he's been invited to an electrocution.

                                      OLIVER
                    Dance with the lady, Norman. You
                    deserve a little diversion.

      Norman and Rita walk away.  Oliver watches them try to dance.

                                      SHANE
                    He has a terrible crush on her,
                    you know.

                                      OLIVER
                    That's very insightful of you,
                      considering she absolutely terrifies
                    him. 

                                      SHANE
                    Love is funny.

                                      OLIVER
                    Odd, perhaps.  But funny?  Rarely.

                                      SHANE
                    What about you, Oliver? Are you
                    married?

                                      OLIVER
                            (uncomfortably)
                    Ah!  Finally.  Our drinks.

      The Bartender delivers their drinks.  Oliver lifts his.

                                      OLIVER (CONT'D)
                      To...to...                                                                                      84.

                                      SHANE
                    To the Dead Letter Office - the

                    I made a pilgrimage to the National
                    Postal Museum two years ago.  It
                    was glorious.

                                      SHANE
                    Can't say I ever went.

                                      OLIVER
                    I got lost in it.

                                      SHANE
                    You went alone?

                                      OLIVER
                    No.  Sort of. I took my...wife.  A
                    lovely person whose interests
                    extended far beyond the written
                    word to, shall we say, the somewhat
                    decadent.  We were standing in
                    front of the Pony Express exhibit
                    and I turned around and she wasn't
                    there anymore.  I looked for her
                      everywhere.  I finally gave up and
                    went back to the Holiday Inn Express
                    and waited for her, but she never
                    came.  I was about to call the
                    police when I noticed the little
                    red light blinking on the phone. 
                    She'd left a message.  She said
                    she was tired of being married to
                      a government official and she
                    figured since she was in Washington
                    DC that put her closer to Paris
                    than she'd ever been in Denver, so
                    she was getting on a plane and
                    moving to France. 

                                      SHANE
                    I'm so sorry.  Did she come back?

                                      OLIVER
                    Not yet.  The last thing she said
                    in her message was "I'll send you
                    my forwarding address.  Au revoir."
                    Actually, she pronounced it "Or
                    rivorre."  I suppose her accent
                    has improved by now.                                                                                      85.

                                      SHANE
                    And that's why you check every
                    dead letter from Paris.

                                      OLIVER
                    I have to believe she mailed her
                    address to me and it just got lost
                    somehow.  I mean, she was always
                    something of a coquette, but she
                    never broke a promise to me.
                          (sadly)
                    Except one, of course.

                                      SHANE
                    Haven't you waited long enough? 

                                      OLIVER
                    I believe in keeping promises.  I
                    am, after all, a gentleman.

                                      SHANE
                    Yes, you certainly are.

      A long beat.  Then:

                                      SHANE (CONT'D)
                    Oliver?  Would you like to dance?

      She smiles gently.  He is touched.

      MUSIC IN: LA VIE EN ROSE -

      The heartbreaking voice of Edif Piaf serenades Shane and
      Oliver in French as they come together and dance slowly but,
      of course, discretely.  Norman and Rita dance in the b.g.

                                      OLIVER
                      Interesting choice.

                                      SHANE
                    Have you ever thought about just
                    going to Paris?

                                      OLIVER
                    Without an invitation?

                                      SHANE
                    Or, you could just tell me her
                    name, I could track her down in
                    ten seconds and you'd finally know.                                                                                      86.

                                      OLIVER
                    I suppose I would.

                                      SHANE
                    I bet that's it.  Maybe you eschew
                    the electronic age...

                                      OLIVER
                    Love that word.  Eschew.

      They dip.  There is a moment when they freeze and we can
      imagine with them what a kiss might be like.  But not tonight.

                                      SHANE
                    ....You reject it all because if
                    you knew how to Google and Skype
                    and scan and whatever, you wouldn't
                    have an excuse anymore for not
                    facing the truth. 

                                      OLIVER
                    Don't psychoanalyze the Section
                    Leader, please.  Besides, you're
                    one to talk.

                                      SHANE
                    What do you mean?

                                      OLIVER
                    Why haven't you opened that card
                    yet?

                                      SHANE
                    How do you know I haven't?

                                      OLIVER
                    Norman checks your purse every
                    day. You should open it. I'm
                    guessing birthday card with two
                    ten dollar bills in it from Dad.

                                      SHANE
                    You are good.  Yeah.  He always
                    sent me twenty dollars for my
                    birthday. 

                                      OLIVER
                    Sent.  Not... gave? 

                                      SHANE
                    He left us when I was ten.  He'd
                    always promised to come to my
                    birthday, but all I'd ever get was
                    a card and some money.                                                                                      87.

                                      OLIVER
                    So that's why getting Kelly and
                    Charlie to keep that date meant so
                    much to you.

                                      SHANE
                    Yeah.  Maybe so. I do know how it
                    feels to wait for somebody who
                    never comes.

                                      OLIVER
                    I'm sorry to hear that.  But if
                    the letter from your dad is an
                    olive branch, maybe he's sending
                    you a message. Life is too short
                    to lose the chance to...

                                      SHANE
                    Life is short!  Oliver, that's it! 
                    She was sending him a message!
                          (calls out)
                    Rita!  Norman!  Let's go!

      Shane walks off the dance floor and everyone follows.

64INT. INNER SANCTUM - NIGHT - LATER

      The four of them gather around Shane's computer as she types.

                                      SHANE
                    Okay, Rita, keep going.  

                                    RITA
                          (reciting)
                    "Charlie, sew this button on and
                    go out into the world.  I know I
                    made the rules, and I'm not going
                    to break them now."

      Shane nods.

                                    RITA (CONT'D)
                    "But the best way to find me if
                    you really need me someday is to
                    just remember this: life is short,
                    but it's beautiful.  Love, Kelly..."

                                      SHANE
                    There's a reason she never wanted
                    him to forget that.  It was her
                    way of breaking the rule.  It was
                    a way for him to find her.

                                      OLIVER
                    She was sending him a message.                                                                                      88.

                                      SHANE
                          (as she types)
                    Life is short, but it's beautiful.

      They stare in shock at the screen.  It is a blog called "Life
      Is Short But It's Beautiful."  And the background photo is a
      shot of Charlie in mid-air, leaping across the ditch.

                                      NORMAN
                          (reads aloud)
                    "Charlie, if you find this page,
                    you must have really wanted to
                    find me. And in case I don't make
                    it to the bridge, I wanted you to
                    have these pictures to remember
                    the last best day of my life. Love,

                                      SHANE
                    There's Charlie by the lake. There's
                    Charlie sailing the boat.

                    Where's Charlie and the Bloodmobile? 
                    They have to be in the same picture
                    to establish time and place.

                                      SHANE
                    We'll find it.

                    there he is landing on the other

                    No, that's the jogger who ran into
                    him.  Or is that Charlie?

                    It's the jogger. He just sort of
                    looks like Charlie.

                                    RITA
                    Sort of? He looks a lot like

                      Interesting.  Charlie was knocked

      Rita stands by the elevators, looking around.  She holds a
      bag.  She looks across nervously to Shane.

                                    RITA
                          (into phone)
                    Here he comes.

      ANGLE ON NORMAN AND JERRY POPOVICH

      Norman stands behind the large Jerry as they walk through
      security.  Norman follows Jerry to the elevators.  Rita steps
      up next to Jerry and presses the UP button.  The three of
      them wait for the elevator to open.  Some PEOPLE exit, but
      we see that Oliver is inside holding a folder.  He stays
      there as Jerry, Rita, and Norman enter.  Just as the doors
      close, A MAN attempts to catch the elevator, but Shane steps
      in front of him and flashes her Postal I.D. badge.

                                      SHANE
                    I'm sorry, sir.  This elevator has
                    been secured.  Please take the
                    elevator to your left.

      Shane steps inside and the doors close.

67INT.  ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

      Jerry presses a the button for his floor but just as the
      elevator begins to move, Shane presses the STOP button and
      they lurch to a halt.

                                      JERRY
                    Let me outta here.

                                      SHANE
                          (holds up bag)
                    I have a Double Double Mile High
                    Roast Beef special on sourdough
                    that says you wanna hear what we
                    have to say.

      Jerry hesitates.  Oliver pulls the photos from the folder.

                                      OLIVER
                    You are the public defender for
                    Charles Riggs and this is the
                    evidence that proves he is innocent. 
                    Photos taken in a park at the same
                    time the crime took place.  Note
                    the Bloodmobile - a once a year
                    afternoon event.  Please pay
                      particular attention to this photo
                    of a man who bears a remarkable
                      resemblance to Mr. Riggs.  Please
                    note his hand suspiciously near
                    Mr. Rigg's back pocket.  I submit
                    to you that he is stealing the
                    very wallet that the perpetrator
                    purposely dropped at the scene of
                    the crime to frame an innocent man
                    for the murder of the baker.

                                      JERRY
                    That's ridiculous.

                                      OLIVER
                    It does sound a bit far-fetched,
                    until I point out that the man
                    accosting Mr. Riggs and removing
                    his wallet is Eugene Moss, the
                    cousin and sole surviving relative
                    of the deceased.

                                    RITA
                    Look him up.  He's on the internet.

      Jerry stares at the photo.

                                      OLIVER
                    Follow the money, Mr. Popovich,
                    and I imagine you will find a murder
                    weapon and a man who has just
                    inherited the lottery millions
                    that his cousin had planned to
                    donate to an orphanage.                                                                                      92.

                                      JERRY
                    Well, I'll give this some thought.

                                      OLIVER
                    You will give this to the District
                    Attorney on the seventh floor right
                    now and get the charges against
                    Mr. Riggs dropped immediately.

                                      JERRY
                    Look pal, you can't tell me what
                    to do.

                                      SHANE
                          (reaches into bag)
                    Better hurry, Jerry.  This offer
                    ends when we get to the seventh
                    floor and I eat your Mile High sub
                    all by myself.

                                      JERRY
                    Is that a threat?

                                      OLIVER
                    No.  But this is.  Have you ever
                    seen what happens to Montana Steaks
                    when they've been delayed for
                      additional postage.

      Jerry sighs, presses the button and takes the sandwich.

                                      OLIVER (CONT'D)
                    Well done, sir.

68EXT. DENVER JAIL - THE NEXT DAY

      The Postables stand across the street by Oliver's car,
      watching the door to the jail.

                                    RITA
                    So, this it?  It's all over?

                                      OLIVER
                    Before you know it, we'll be back
                    at the DLO packing our proverbial
                    bags. Our days of rule-breaking
                    glory are over.

                                      SHANE
                    Not for me.

                                      OLIVER
                    No.
                                      (MORE)                                                                                      93.

                                      OLIVER (CONT'D)
                    I imagine you'll always be found
                    somewhere stepping across a line. 
                    But before it's all over, I'd like
                    to know why: Why are you such a
                      revolutionary, Shane McInerney?

                                      SHANE
                    Well, because you actually called
                    me by my correct name, I'm going
                    to tell you, Mr. O'Toole.

      Shane pulls out the still-unopened "birthday" card.

                                      SHANE (CONT'D)
                    I used to follow all the rules. 
                    Drove the speed limit, parked at
                    least five feet from the fire
                    hydrant, never tore the tags off
                      furniture.  So when the hospital
                    told me that visiting hours were
                    over one night, I said thank you,
                    I'll come back and see my dad
                    tomorrow.  But when tomorrow came,
                    I didn't have anyone to come back
                    to.  My dad had died overnight and
                    I never got to work things out
                    with him.

                                      NORMAN
                    Why were you fighting?

      Rita elbows him.

                                      SHANE
                    I'd said something horrible to
                    him.  He called and said he was
                    sick and wanted to spend my birthday
                    with me before he died.  And I
                    told him he'd been gone so long
                    that he was dead to me already.

                                    RITA
                    Ouch.

                                      NORMAN
                    But...he was your dad.  He knew he
                    hurt you.  He must have known you
                    didn't mean it.

                                      SHANE
                    He knew that I did.
                                      (MORE)                                                                                      94.

                                      SHANE (CONT'D)
                    So, maybe this is a birthday card
                    with twenty dollars and a bunch of
                      forgiveness in it.  But if it
                    isn't...I don't think I could bear
                    it.

      No one knows what to say.  Oliver looks up in time to see
      Charlie walk out of jail. 

      ANGLE ON CHARLIE

      He is walking out of the jail, putting on his blazer, wearing
      the same clothes he was arrested in a year ago.  Charlie is
      instantly surrounded by a number of reporters and news
      cameras, eager to interview the innocent man.

                                      REPORTER#1
                    Mr. Riggs!  Mr. Riggs!  How does
                    it feel to be exonerated?

                                      REPORTER#2
                    Who found the evidence?

                                      REPORTER #1
                    What's the first thing you're going
                    to do?

      Charlie takes a deep breath and looks across the street. He 
      sees our gang waiting for him by Oliver's car.  He smiles. 

69EXT.  WASHINGTON PARK - DAY - MINUTES LATER

      The car pulls up and they get out near the bridge.

                                      CHARLIE
                    I know it doesn't matter now, but
                    I just figured, it's Friday and
                    one of us should be here, you know?

                                      OLIVER
                    Of course. Best wishes, Charlie.

                                    RITA
                    I brought you a bagel and lox.

                                      NORMAN
                    And cream cheese.  And capers.

                                      CHARLIE
                          (moved)
                    Thanks.  Thanks for everything.                                                                                      95.

                                    RITA
                    Come on, Norman, let's feed the
                    ducks.

      Norman shrugs and they walk off. 

                                      CHARLIE
                          (a beat)
                    Why did you all do this?

                                      OLIVER
                    We each have our reasons. A daughter
                    waiting for a father.  A husband's
                    wife who left him to see Paris and
                    never returned.  A loyal government
                    worker and a young woman with a
                    mind like a Wikipedia committed to
                    their work and, perhaps someday,
                    to each other.  We are simple people
                    with a simple faith in the goodness
                    of the average American letter-
                    writer.  We do this for these, and
                    for so many more reasons.  But
                    more than that, we did it for Kelly.

                                      CHARLIE
                    U.S. Postal Service, huh?

                                      OLIVER
                    An obscure division.

                                      CHARLIE
                    Well, thank you.

                                      OLIVER
                    Our pleasure, Mr. Riggs.  We were
                    just doing our job.  Oh, one more
                    thing...

      Oliver reaches into his pocket.  He hands Charlie the button. 
      Charlie takes it and nods.

                                      SHANE
                          (hands him something
                            else)
                    And, here.  Just a little something
                    to remember us by. It's...a sewing
                    kit.

      Charlie smiles and nods. He turns and walks towards the
      bridge.  Oliver and Shane walk towards Norman and Rita.

                                      NORMAN
                    It's hard to believe this was our
                    last assignment together.                                                                                      96.

                                      SHANE
                    Norman, this was our first
                      assignment together.

                                      NORMAN
                    Yeah.  I'm gonna miss us.

      Rita smiles and tentatively puts her arm through Norman's. 
      A WOMAN ON A BIKE rides past them.  Shane glances up, then
      realizes something.  She stops and turns around.

                                      SHANE
                    Oh, my God....

      ANGLE ON THE BRIDGE

      Charlie leans over the bridge and stares sadly at the ditch. 
      He sighs.  He opens the sewing kit, pulls out a needle and
      prepares to sew on the button in his hand.

                                      KELLY (O.S.)
                    Charlie?

      He turns and is stunned to see Kelly standing by a bike.

                                      CHARLIE
                      What...what are you doing here?

                                      KELLY
                    Well, we had a date, right?

                                      CHARLIE
                    Yeah, but...I mean, I tried to
                    find you, I did find you, at the
                    research center... but... you're...
                    alive.  My God, you're alive!

                                      KELLY
                    I'm fine!  You found me in Boston?

                                      CHARLIE
                    Boston?  No, here in Denver.  The
                    place on the fourth floor.  But
                    they said nobody survived the
                    trials.

                                      KELLY
                    Really?  Wow.  I never finished
                    the trials.  I only signed up
                    because it was free and I was too
                    afraid to go back home and ask my
                    parents for help.                                                                                      97.

                                      CHARLIE
                    I can't imagine you being afraid
                    of anything.

                                      KELLY
                          (smiles)
                    You don't know my parents.  But
                    that day, when you quit and then
                    you jumped the ditch, I realized I
                    had to do some scary things, too. 
                    So I dropped out of the program,
                    and went home to Boston and I made
                    up with my parents and they got me
                    the greatest doctor in the world
                    and here I am.

                                      CHARLIE
                    You were in Boston all this time? 
                    So, you don't know...

                                      KELLY
                    Know what?

                                      CHARLIE
                          (smiles)
                    Doesn't matter.  You ready for our
                    second date?

                                      KELLY
                    I'm here, aren't I?  But look at
                    that! You still haven't sewn that
                    button on!

                                      CHARLIE
                    I was waiting for you.

      He holds out the button.  She reaches for it.  He takes her
      hand and pulls her to him and they kiss as if it's been
      forever.

      ANGLE ON OLIVER, SHANE, RITA, & NORMAN

                                      NORMAN
                    That's Kelly, right?

                                      OLIVER
                    Yes, Norman, I believe it is.

                                    RITA
                          (weeping)
                    I knew it.  I just couldn't believe
                    she was really gone...                                                                                      98.

                                      NORMAN
                    But I don't understand.  She's
                    supposed to be...

                                      OLIVER
                    You can't believe everything you
                    read on the internet.

                                      SHANE
                    That's right.  "There are more
                    things in heaven and earth, Norman,
                    than are dreamt of in your
                      philosophy."

                                      OLIVER AND SHANE
                      Shakespeare.

      They share a private smile as the gang walks to the car.

                                      OLIVER (V.O.)
                    I have seen it all, dead letters
                    by the thousands, each one a tiny
                    paper vessel laden with good news
                    or ill, profit or loss, love or
                    pain...

      WE SEE CHARLIE & KELLY BY THE LAKE.  CHARLIE SETS ANOTHER
      PAPER BOAT INTO THE LAKE AS KELLY SEWS ON THE BUTTON.

                                      OLIVER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    ...Tossed about on the rough seas
                    of government protocol, a ship
                    searching for its harbor.  Each
                    one bearing the power to change
                    something and yet, each one a
                    destiny postponed...until it comes
                    to us.

70INT. U.S. MAIL REGIONAL FACILITY - ONE WEEK LATER

      Oliver walks confidently across the mail floor.  He nods to
      a seething Andrea.  He walks toward the Inner Sanctum door.

                                      OLIVER (V.O.)
                    Aunt Tilly's missing will, the
                    missing registration form of the
                    class reunion, the odd ransom note,
                    the first letter from college, the
                    last letter from Iraq.

71INT. INNER SANCTUM - DAY - CONTINUOUS

      CLOSE ON: Another load of DEAD LETTERS being dumped into a
      bin.  The gang has clearly worked out a terrific system
      together.                                                                                      99.

      Rita is pulling out letters variously addressed "Barack Obama,
      USA" "The Jerks at the IRS" etc. Norman alternately crosses
      himself and stamps them.  He passes them to Shane, who works
      the laptop and forwards them.

                                      NORMAN
                    Santa, the Pope... here's one for
                    you.

      Norman tosses a blue card to her.  Shane scans it efficiently.

                                      SHANE
                    No city.  Just a zip.  145 Albino
                    Treets?  Should be Albion Street.

                                      NORMAN
                      Obviously.

                                      SHANE
                          (with newfound
                            authority)
                    Sender is clearly dyslexic.  Apply
                    that same disturbed pattern sequence
                    to your ZIP, reverse the first and
                    fifth numerals, and you have... 
                    90208 not 80209.  Los Angeles!

      Oliver enters. He walks purposefully to his desk and opens
      his attache case, removing a brown lunch bag and a bottle of
      Yoo-Hoo, which he places carefully in his beloved
      refrigerator.

                                      NORMAN
                    'Morning, Oliver.

      He walks to the time clock and finds his card on the wall.

                                      OLIVER
                    Ladies and gentlemen, it is an
                    excellent day.

      He punctuates this with a decisive CLICK of his card in the
      time clock.  He returns the card to its slot.

                                      OLIVER (CONT'D)
                    There is little that lifts a man's
                    spirits more than the knowledge
                    that he has meaningful work.

                                      NORMAN
                    Mickey Mouse...George Clooney...
                    Her Royal Majesty Queen Sofia of
                    Spain - toss that into Europe,
                    will you?                                                                                    100.

      Shane takes it and tosses it into a bin.  Oliver retrieves a
      newspaper from his attache and cuts out a story from it.

      Oliver pins his news clipping to his bulletin board.

      THE CLIPPING:  The headline reads: "POST OFFICE SOLVES MURDER
      OF BAKER, REUNITES COUPLE"

      Oliver straightens it, sniffs, clears his throat, to call
      attention to the clipping.  Shane and Norman stop and read
      the headline.  Oliver points to a paragraph farther down.

                                    RITA
                          (reading)
                    "District Attorney Edwards hailed
                    the local post office branch at
                    Alameda and Downing for 'superlative
                    service and a highly efficient
                    dead letter division.' The branch
                    was originally slated for closure
                    but will now be expanded to receive
                    all misdirected letters from the
                    Western and Mid-States region."

      The door opens and Andrea enters, carrying a paper.

                                      ANDREA
                      McInerney.  I guess you rate now.
                    That transfer you asked for came
                    through early and you report to
                    Direct Line Operations at the
                    Terminal Annex in two hours.  If
                    you still want it.

      Shane slowly takes the paper and stares at it.

                                      SHANE
                    Thanks.  I think...I think I need
                    a cup of coffee.  Good coffee.

      She exits.  The three remaining Postables turn to each other,
      devastated.  Andrea's evil smile returns.

72INT. STARBUCK'S - DAY - LATER

      The Barista calls out an order.

                                      BARISTA (O.S.)
                    Grande chai tea with foam.

      ANGLE ON THE LINE OF SHOES WAITING TO ORDER AT THE COUNTER
      AND SHANE'S FAMILIAR BLACK SLINGS.

      PANNING UP we see Shane.  She stands in line, still holding
      Andrea's transfer notice in her hand.                                                                                    101.

      After a moment, she remembers something and reaches into her
      purse and trades the paper for the still-unopened greeting
      card.

      She takes a deep breath and opens it up.  It is a birthday
      card.  As she reads, she is visibly relieved and moved.  And
      yes, there are two tens.

73INT. INNER SANCTUM - DAY - A FEW MINUTES LATER

                                      NORMAN
                    Maybe we could go find her.

                                      OLIVER
                    Not on your tintype, Norman.

                                    RITA
                    But Shane is out there somewhere,
                    deciding where to go.

                                      OLIVER
                    Yes, she is.  And who can understand
                    that better than we who believe
                    that everything lost must find its
                    way home in its own good time.

      They fall silent and tend to their work.  A pall has fallen
      over the room.  Then, the door opens and Shane enters,
      carrying four cups of Starbuck's coffee.

                                      SHANE
                    Come and get'em while they're hot! 
                    I got three skinny vanilla
                      lattes...and one Venti Americano. 
                    We've got a lot of mail to get
                    through today.

                                      OLIVER
                    That was very kind of you.

                                      SHANE
                    Hey.  I found an extra twenty.

      They happily turn back to their work.

                                      OLIVER (V.O.)
                    Yes, the thoughtfully-composed,
                      well-considered, addressed, stamped,
                      professionally postmarked, and
                      personally delivered letter is
                    still the gold-standard of human
                      intercourse.  God is in His universe
                    and all is right with the world.

                                            THE END
