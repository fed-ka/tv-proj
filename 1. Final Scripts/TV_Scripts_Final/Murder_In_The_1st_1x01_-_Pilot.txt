                                November 30th, 2012                                          ACT ONE

      FADE IN:


      EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - AERIAL - HIGH NOON

      THE CITY is laid out before us. Chinatown. Fisherman s 
        Wharf. Russian Hill. The ocean lurks low, in the gaps.

        REVEAL POV of ERICH BLOUNT (28), a tech genius and the 
      CEO of APPLICON. He s on top of a SKYSCRAPER, at the 
        rooftop s edge, staring down -- 48 stories to pavement.

        Blount is boyish in his RAY BANS, his Italian SNEAKERS 
      and designer T-SHIRT, almost sweet looking. But there s 
      an anger lurking underneath, and a complex vulnerability. 

                                        MAN S VOICE (O.S.)
                      What do you think?

                                        BLOUNT
                      Freaky.

                                        MAN S VOICE (O.S.)
                      Good freaky?

                                        BLOUNT
                      Yeah. Freaky is good.

        Reveal IVAN WEXLER (40) standing behind him, holding a 
        HANDHELD. He s bearded, heavy set, dressed in all black -- 
        Blount s brilliant CTO and head of R&D. Ivan watches 
        Blount as he studies the city below like a painter.

                                        BLOUNT (CONT D)
                      The bay should be darker. This is San 
                      Fran, not the Caribbean.

      Ivan eyes his handheld, then speaks to JOHN, off screen.

                                        IVAN
                      John, color correct the water. Try value 
                    at 3+. Chroma at L2. Hue at P1.

        A beat, then THE OCEAN AND BAY FADES TO DARKER BLUE. It s 
        a subtle shift, disorienting. An optical illusion.

                                        BLOUNT
                      Better. Let s see the birds.

        A FLOCK OF BIRDS appears, racing towards us. 

                                        BLOUNT (CONT D)
                      Lower their floor to five feet. More 
                      mustard. Right at us.

      Ivan presses on his HANDHELD and suddenly THE BIRDS DROP 
        LOWER, jumping across the sky like a computer glitch--                                                                                         2.


        --WE RE IN A 3-D VIRTUAL WORLD, A HOLOGRAM; a perfect 
        recreation of reality. If it weren t for their 
        adjustments, you would never know the difference.

        Blount stares out at his creation, content. 

                                        IVAN
                      You look like Abraham, staring down from 
                      the mountaintop.

                                        BLOUNT
                      Good. That s exactly what we re selling.-- 

        Blount steps forward, OFF THE ROOF, INTO THE SKY -- BUT 
      HE DOESN T FALL. He just stands there floating. 

                                        BLOUNT (CONT D)
                      --In my world, you get to play God.
                              (beat; turning back)
                      Good work, Ivan. See you on the plane.

      Ivan smiles, compliments are rare. Then he nods to 
        Blount,  presses  on  his  handheld,  and  SUDDENLY--     

      --THE SAN FRANCISCO HOLOGRAM MELTS AWAY, THE WORLD 
        LITERALLY DISSOLVING OFF THE SCREEN, LEAVING ONLY ERICH--


      EXT. SANTA FE DESERT - REALITY - DAWN

        --BLOUNT STANDING ALONE IN THE DESERT. 

      He pulls off his sensory devices: micro EAR BUDS; a 
        NEURAL IMPULSE PATCH on the nape of his neck; specialized 
      RAY BANS. His dark eyes flicker with genius and doubt. 

      He walks to a WHITE SUV that s parked on the shoulder. 
      The DRIVER opens the passenger door and shouts out. 

                                        SALTER
                      Let s go! You re late!

      This is JIMMY SALTER (56), a tough former cop with a 
        boxer s nose and Blount s head of security. 

        Blount gets in and slams the door. Salter fishtails onto 
      the road, past a sign that READS: LEAVING SANTA FE.  

      [MOS] as we pre-lap a girl s voice from the next scene.

                                        LOUISE (O.S.)
                      Mom.

                                                                              CUT TO:                                                                                        3.


      INT. HILDY S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING

      HILDY MULLIGAN (29), asleep in her bed, slowly opens her 
      eyes to discover her daughter LOUISE (6) standing next to 
      her, holding a phone. She speaks sleepily.

                                        HILDY
                      Who is it?

                                        LOUISE
                      It s dad. He said to wake you up.

      Hildy slowly sits up and takes the phone from Louise. She 
      looks at her CLOCK: 7:00 AM. She overslept.

                                        HILDY
                    Go get dressed, babe. Bobby s mom will be 
                      here any minute. 

      Hildy waits for Louise to leave, then pushes her dirty 
        blonde hair out of her face and moves to the window. 
      She s wearing a Ramones t-shirt, lace boyshorts -- she s 
        self-assured and sexy without knowing it, or caring.

                                        HILDY (INTO PHONE) (CONT D)
                      One of the rules of divorce is that you 
                    no longer get to wake me up.
                              (listening)
                      Mike. Stop. Lawyers? Are you threatening 
                      me? 
                              (listening, then exhales)
                      I get paid on Friday. I ll cut a check on 
                      Saturday. That s the best I can do. 

      She clicks off, dumps the phone on her bed. A beat, then 
      A CAR HORN BLASTS, outside. 

                                        HILDY (CONT D)
                      That s your ride! Put on your jacket!

      Hildy pulls on a SHIRT and PANTS and we follow her out 
      into the KITCHEN. Louise is looking in the FRIDGE: empty. 

                                        LOUISE
                      We re out of food.

                                        HILDY
                      I like your outfit.

                                        LOUISE
                      How was your date last night?

                                        HILDY
                      A disaster.

        Louise smiles and turns to her mom. She s mature for her 
      age and their rapport is more friendly than parent-child. 

                                        LOUISE
                      What happened?                                                                                        4.


                                        HILDY
                      Men always seem better on paper.
                      I ll get groceries after work.

                                        LOUISE
                      What about lunch?

                                        HILDY
                      You ll have to buy it at the cafeteria.

        Louise makes a disgusting face.

                                        HILDY (CONT D)
                      Relax. You ll survive. Take five bucks 
                      from my purse.

        Louise finds Hildy s purse and looks inside, accidentally 
        discovering HILDY S SIG SAUER P239. She takes it out and 
        turns, extending it to Hildy, trying to be helpful.

                                        HILDY (CONT D)
                      LOUISE! NO!

      HILDY RIPS THE GUN OUT OF HER HAND. Louise wells up. 
      Hildy grabs her in a hug, heart thumping, overwhelmed.

      INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - SF GENERAL - EARLY MORNING

      CLOSE ON A MAN S HANDS, as they carefully assemble a 
      MODEL SAILBOAT, snapping pieces into place.

      TERRY SEAGRAVE (43) works at a desk cluttered with tiny 
      MODEL PARTS. He s rugged, built like a welterweight. 
        There s mileage on his face. His eyes have seen things. 
      But right now he s focused like a scientist on his boat.

      His wife EMILY (38), watches him from the hospital bed. 
      She s in grave physical condition, dying of cancer, but 
        currently smiling sideways as she eyes his contraption. 

                                        EMILY
                      Any chance that thing ever sails?

      Emily has a dry, sarcastic sense of humor -- it s her 
        defense mechanism, and her survival technique. Terry 
      turns to her and smiles. He didn t know she was awake.

                                        TERRY
                        Superstructure s intact. Deck beams are 
                      giving me trouble. I d say we re two 
                      nights away from a proper christening.
                              (beat)
                      How d you sleep?                                                                                        5.


                                        EMILY
                      The machines keep me up. The blinds don t 
                      close. There s no circulation in here. 
                              (beat, deadpan)
                      I slept great.

      Terry moves to her side and puts his hand against her 
      face, smiling. His eyes saying, you are beautiful.

                                        EMILY (CONT D)
                      I ve been having these vivid dreams, 
                      where I find myself reliving memories.
                              (beat)
                      It s probably the drugs. 

      Terry shrugs, then moves to the closet and puts on a 
      fresh shirt. He lives in this room these days. 

                                        EMILY (CONT D)
                      Remember the Redwoods up by Mendocino? 
                      That little State Park we went to?

                                        TERRY
                      Montgomery Woods.

                                        EMILY
                              (smiling)
                      You got naked in the Hot Springs with all 
                      those hippie pot-heads.

                                        TERRY
                      When in Rome.

      Emily cracks up at the memory, laughing.

                                        EMILY
                      You thought there was a snake in the 
                      water, remember? You went tearing out of 
                      there, sprinted all the way to the 
                      parking lot! God, that was funny. You 
                      looked so ridiculous!

      Terry forces a smile -- not that amused. Emily closes her 
      eyes, suddenly drained. There s some distance between 
      them, emotionally. Neither of them knows how this works.

        DOCTOR SHRAKE (50) pokes his head in from the hallway. He 
      sees Emily asleep, then indicates Terry outside.

                                        DR. SHRAKE
                      Got a minute?

                                                                              CUT TO:


      INT. CORRIDOR - HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER

      TERRY is outside Emily s room talking to their 
        oncologist, DR. SHRAKE. A tough, stark conversation.                                                                                        6.


                                        TERRY
                      What about Hopkins, the experimental 
                      injections? Let s do that.

                                        DOCTOR SHRAKE
                    We crossed that bridge two months ago. 
                      It s no longer an option.

                                        TERRY
                      She s a fighter, Doc. We re not going to 
                      give up. 

        Shrake exhales, determined to force Terry into reality.

                                        DOCTOR SHRAKE
                      She has stage-4 pancreatic cancer, Terry, 
                      and it has spread to her liver and lungs. 
                      The yellowing of her skin and eyes? It s 
                      jaundice, a by-product of the 
                        accumulation of bile acids throughout her 
                      body. She can t eat. Her weight loss 
                      alone is unsustainable. 
                              (beat)
                      She s dying, Terry, and she knows it. 
                      She s already lived longer than we ever 
                      thought she would. But whatever 
                      treatments we do now will just postpone 
                      the inevitable. If she s putting on a 
                      brave face, she s doing it for you. 

      Terry leans against the wall, fighting back emotions. 

                                        DOCTOR SHRAKE (CONT D)
                      Take her home for hospice. Let her last 
                      days be about her, not about you. 

        Shrake pats him on the arm, then walks away. 

        A devastating beat as reality lands hard, like a shot to 
      the gut. The CELL PHONE clipped to Terry s belt BUZZES, 
      but he doesn t react; locked into a thousand-yard stare.

      INT. TENEMENT BUILDING - TENDERLOIN - MORNING

      HILDY stares at a DEAD MAN in a tie-dye tee-shirt sitting 
      on a couch in a pool of his own blood. His name is KEVIN 
        NEYERS (50). There s a BULLET HOLE in his forehead. 

      YOUNG UNIFORM is next to her, holding a tray of coffees, 
      eager to please. She doesn t look at him.

                                        HILDY
                      Not necessary. I m awake.                                                                                        7.


      The room is a drug den, dilapidated, with aluminum foil 
      on the windows. UNIFORM COPS and EMT TECHS swarm around, 
        bagging EVIDENCE, snapping PHOTOS, DUSTING for prints. 

                                        SLUM LORD (O.S.)
                      I don t hear nothin ! 

                                        TERRY
                      That s a .44 Caliber hole in his head--

      Hildy turns and eyes TERRY, partially visible in the 
        HALLWAY. He has the SLUM LORD (40s, Chinese, broken 
        English) cornered, and is up in his face.

                                        TERRY (CONT D)
                      --You would ve heard that bullet.

                                        SLUM LORD
                      This is Tenderloin. Chinese New Year.
                      Boom boom boom! Explosions all time. 

      Terry shakes his head, then lets the SLUM LORD down and 
      moves to Hildy. They look at the body, comparing notes. 

                                        HILDY
                        Hollow-point. Splatter marks and narrow 
                      stippling burns put the shooter at point 
                      blank. 

                                        TERRY
                              (eyeing the blood on the wall)
                      The blood s still congealing. 

                                        HILDY
                      Dry patterns put T.O.D. at around 2 AM.

      Hildy moves to a small FRIDGE and looks inside.

                                        HILDY (CONT D)
                      He s got more groceries than I do. And 
                      enough fentanyl to kill an elephant.

      She takes out a ZIP-LOCK OF MEDICAL LOLLIPOPS, shows it. 
      Then she indicates the drug paraphernalia on the coffee 
      table in front of NEYERS: spoons, needles, a full baggie. 

                                        HILDY (CONT D)
                      Nearly a grand of product left behind.

                                        TERRY
                      Guess that rules out his dealer.

                                        HILDY
                      It s all laid out for us. Neat. 

      Terry looks at her, she s seeing something he s not.

                                        TERRY
                    Go ahead.                                                                                        8.


      Hildy pulls on gloves then picks up a used syringe.

                                        HILDY
                      This was jabbed into his leg, right 
                      there. See the mark? 
                              (beat, indicating)
                      The heroin was scattered around. There s 
                      blood on the needle, but the pump tube is 
                      clean. The syringe wasn t actually used. 

                                        TERRY
                      You re saying it s a decoy?

                                        HILDY
                      Just another dead junkie. 

                                        TERRY
                      Smart.

      They nod at the EMT TECHS indicating that it s safe to 
      move the body, then move towards the window. 

                                        TERRY (CONT D)

                      Mediocre. But no accident.

        A uniformed cop, CAPUZZO (26), intercepts them.

                                        CAPUZZO
                      You should hear this. The neighbor across 
                      the street.

      Hildy and Terry nod, following Capuzzo out the front 
      door. [MOS] as behind, NEYERS is zipped into a BODY BAG.

      EXT. PORCH - CRIME SCENE - MOMENTS LATER

        A tough city block deep in the TENDERLOIN. UNIFORMS and 
      EMT TECH S move around the scene. Neighbors casually 
      watch from sidewalks and windows. Hildy and Terry are now 
        mid-interview with SUE DURHAM (40s, butch, mixed-race).                                                                                        9.

                      --Saw them sneak in, then come running 
                      right back out down the street like they

                      more than two, three minutes tops.

                    We seen dem boys  round before. They rip 
                      copper from abandoned buildings, tenement 
                      houses, powerlines. Sell it to metal 
                      recyclers for a couple bucks a pound.

                                        HILDY
                    Do you know their names? Ages?

                      Any idea where we could track them down?

                                        SUE DURHAM
                      Try Boeddeker Park. That s the 
                        neighborhood hang.

                                        HILDY
                      Thanks.

      Sue nods, then heads back inside her home. Terry and 
      Hildy move back towards the scene. The BODY BAG is on a 
        stretcher, being loaded into an AMBULANCE. 

      An EMT TECH intercepts them, handing Terry an iPAD.

                                        EMT TECH 
                    We found it under the body.

      Terry nods thanks. EMT Tech walks away. Hildy watches as 
      Terry awkwardly flips the iPAD around in his hands.

                                        HILDY
                    Do you know how to use it?

                                        TERRY
                    Of course.

      He s lying. Hildy reaches over, presses the POWER BUTTON.

                                        HILDY
                      Don t hurt yourself.

      Terry shoots her a sideways smile: fuck off.

      ANGLE ON iPAD -- an  APPLICON  APPLICATION flickers to 
      life, the company s RED LOGO filling the screen. [MOS]                                                                                        10.

      INT. GULFSTREAM 550 - DAY

      We re in the spacious cabin of Blount s private jet. His 
        corporate brain-trust is on board, scattered around the 
      cabin in plush leather chairs. Blount s younger than 
        everyone, but comfortably in charge. He holds up an iPAD.

                                        BLOUNT
                      --But the experience is limited by the 
                      delivery system. The future will be 
                      dominated by the first company able to 
                      eliminate the device.

        Seated across is board member SUSAN LIPTON (50, elegant). 

                                        LIPTON
                      How will that work, Erich?

                      allowing them to travel inside our 
                      virtual worlds.

      The board members look at Blount. Blank stares. Blount 
      eyes the hourglass figure of his stewardess CINDY (29) as 
      she pours wine for board member PIERRE LECOURT (40).

                                        LECOURT
                      I don t understand, Erich. Are we opening 
                      a theme park?

                                        BLOUNT
                      That s funny.

        Lipton eyes IVAN WEXLER, seated behind Erich.

                                        LIPTON
                    Is there a prototype, Ivan?                                                                                        11.

                      How much?

                                        BLOUNT
                      Fifty million.

                                        LIPTON
                      Can it wait until after the IPO?

                                        BLOUNT
                      This is the tech business. It s a race.

                                        LECOURT
                      Once we go public, you ll have plenty of 
                      money for R&D.

                                        BLOUNT
                      Then what are we waiting for?

        Blount looks at TINA MISHKIN (33), an attractive, sharply 
        dressed, Ivy League investment banker.

                                        TINA MISHKIN
                      After the Facebook debacle, it behooves 
                    us to do this roll out by the books.

                                        BLOUNT
                              (teasing)
                      Did you just say behoove?

      Next to Tina is DAVID HERTZBERG (40), Blount s slick, 
        powerful attorney. He s wearing a $5000.00 suit.

                                        HERTZBERG
                      She s saying we need to square away the 
                      Jeremy Leonard lawsuit. I agree.

                                        TINA MISHKIN
                      A legal challenge to the IP of your most 
                      profitable product is a major red flag. 
                      Investors are emotional. Herd mentalities 
                      are impossible to turn around. If public 
                      opinion moves against you, it could sink 
                      any potential IPO.

        There s something romantic in the way Erich looks at her.

                                        BLOUNT
                      You ve got a little food on your jacket, 
                      Tina. Right...there.

        Blount reaches over and wipes a crumb off of Tina s 
        breast. Tina can t help but smile, caught off guard. 
      Cindy shoots her a disapproving look, then exits to the 
        galley. A beat. Blount stands and looks at his team.                                                                                        12.

                      The Leonard lawsuit is a sideshow. My job 
                    is to keep this company focused on

        Blount exits to the rear galley. Everyone goes back to 
      work, chastised. Lipton eyes Tina, then shakes her head.

                                                                              CUT TO:

                      Probably. But you know you love it.

      She reaches for his belt, opening it. He grabs her and 
      rips open her blouse. They start kissing, as we...

      FADE IN:


      EXT. 850 BRYANT STREET - DAY ONE - AFTERNOON

        Terry, holding the I-PAD, walks with Hildy towards 850 
        BRYANT STREET, a stone monolith that houses every element 
      of the city s justice system. POLICE CRUISERS, AMBULANCES 
      and CITY VEHICLES fly around the edges. 

                                                                              CUT TO:


      INT. MAIN LOBBY - 850 BRYANT STREET - CONTINUOUS

      CITY STAFFERS and UNIFORMED COPS move in all directions, 
      in and out of open office DOORS. Terry and Hildy enter 
        through the main corridor, past the famous PLAQUE TO 
        FALLEN OFFICERS, towards the ELEVATORS, getting on.

                                                                              CUT TO:


      INT. ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER

      Terry and Hildy are suddenly alone. Terry eyes the iPAD, 
      then hands it to Hildy.

                                        TERRY
                      Take a look at this e-mail. The last 
                      message he sent.

      Hildy looks at the I-PAD, READS:  SENT MESSAGES  

              TO: ERICH BLOUNT
              FROM: KEVIN NEYERS
              Erich, my boy.
              Help an old man out. 
              $50,000 by dawn, or I ll go public.
              Last chance.
              KN

      Hildy looks at Terry, caught off guard. The doors OPEN.

                                        TERRY (CONT D)
                      Who the hell is Erich Blount?

                                        HILDY
                      You re kidding, right?

                                                                              CUT TO:


      EXT. 4TH FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

      Hildy and Terry exit the elevator, walking towards a door 
        labeled  ROOM 455-HOMICIDE.  Hildy speaks low.                                                                                        14.


                                        HILDY
                      This case just got more interesting.

                                                                              CUT TO:


      INT. ROOM 455 - HOMICIDE - MOMENTS LATER

        A tight, narrow room twenty years behind the times. 12 
        CUBICLES. COMPUTERS. FILE BOXES stacked to the ceiling. 

      Terry and Hildy are mid-debrief with Lieutenant JIM KOTO 
      (35), Japanese American, all business, with movie-star 
      looks and a Stanford degree.   Behind Koto are INSPECTORS 
      DAVID MOLK (45), fat, smart, but lazy; and his tall 
        partner HENRY NAVARRO (35), ambitious but not bright.

                                        TERRY
                      Erich Blount. One of these Silicon Valley 
                      brats.

      Hildy eyes Terry, sideways -- he s suddenly an expert.

                                        KOTO
                      The CEO of Applicon. I know who he is.

                                        HILDY
                      The victim sent him a threatening e-mail 
                      the night before he was killed. 

                                        TERRY
                    We found it on this. 

      Terry hands Koto the I-PAD. He turns it on.

                                        MOLK
                      Junkie with an iPad, and we re still 
                      using PalmPilots.

                                        TERRY
                      It s a threat. It implies an existing 
                        relationship.

                                        KOTO
                      It s pretty vague. 

                                        HILDY
                      I agree. We have no idea if that s even 
                      Blount s e-mail address. And there s no 
                      evidence that he ever replied. 

                                        KOTO
                    Is there an obvious connection between 
                      Blount and the victim?

                                        HILDY
                      No.

                                        TERRY
                      But we re just getting started.                                                                                        15.


                                        KOTO
                      Let me see the body.

      Hildy hands KOTO a folder of blurry photos from the crime 
        scene. He flips to a gruesome shot of KEVIN NEYERS.

                                        HILDY
                      Kevin Neyers. Age 50.

                                        TERRY
                      Twenty arrests on his record. Half a 
                      dozen convictions. Possession. 
                        Distribution. B&Es. A couple assaults.

                                        HILDY
                      Not exactly a boy scout.

      KOTO holds up a photo of the FENTANYL POPS.

                                        TERRY
                      Fentanyl Lollipops, used for Stage 4 
                      cancer patients. Street value around a G.

                                        KOTO
                      That should narrow down the dealers.

                                        HILDY
                      A neighbor said she saw two boys enter 
                      and exit the building around T.O.D.. 
                      Copper thieves. She d seen them before. 

                                        KOTO
                      Find  em.

                                        TERRY
                      And we ll try to track down this Blount 
                      character and see if he got this e-mail.

                                        KOTO
                      Last I heard, Jimmy Salter was running 
                      Applicon security.

                              (smiles)
                      Salter? He was my first boss.

                                        KOTO
                      Reach out to his office, but use 
                      discretion, Seagrave. Blount s got sway 
                    in this building. 

                                        NAVARRO
                              (conspiratorial)

                                        TERRY
                      I ll be my usual charming self.

                                        KOTO
                      Just let Mulligan do the talking.                                                                                        16.


      Terry eyes Hildy, smiling. Molk and Navarro move back to 
      their desks. Koto looks at Terry, speaks quietly.

                                        KOTO (CONT D)
                      How re things?

      Terry just shrugs. Koto pats him on the shoulder, then 
      walks away. Hildy looks at Terry kindly, they share eyes. 
      They both know that  things  are not good.

                                                                              CUT TO:


      EXT. STREET - FINANCIAL DISTRICT - AFTERNOON

      Terry and Hildy walk down a busy sidewalk, through a mob 
      of DOWNTOWN PROFESSIONALS. 

                                        TERRY
                      They re moving her home for hospice.

                                        HILDY
                      Shouldn t you be there?

                                        TERRY
                      You would think. But Emily shot that 
                      down, said I d just get in the way. She 
                      insists I keep working. 

      Terry shrugs, at a loss. Confused. A beat.

                                        TERRY (CONT D)
                      I have no idea what I m doing, Hildy. 
                      There s no manual for this.

                                        HILDY
                      Just keep listening to Emily. She s a 
                      strong woman. She knows what she needs, 
                      and what you need. 

      They reach an intersection and stop for the light. They 
      stare across at 101 CALIFORNIA STREET, the modern 
        skyscraper that houses APPLICON. 

        HILDY s phone BUZZES. She looks at it--

      PHONE TEXT READS:  YOU HAVE FOUR NEW MATCHES  

        A Dating App. Hildy tries to hide it from Terry, but he 
      sees it and smiles, eager to rib.

                                        TERRY
                      Cupid calls?

                                        HILDY
                      Don t start.

                                        TERRY
                      It s sad to see you pimp yourself out on 
                      the Internet. You re a decent catch.                                                                                        17.


                                        HILDY
                      It s 2013. This is how the world works.

                                        TERRY
                      Let me see.

        A beat. Hildy exhales, then hands him her phone.

                                        HILDY
                      You enter your preferences. It comes back 
                      with possible matches.

      The light changes. Terry studies her phone as they cross.

                                        TERRY
                      Attractive, athletic build, graduate 
                      degree, high income bracket.

                                        HILDY
                              (grabbing the phone)
                      That s enough.

                                        TERRY
                              (teasing)
                      Firm buttocks.

                                        HILDY
                      Hilarious.

                                        TERRY
                      Any luck?

                                        HILDY
                      Nope.

                                        TERRY
                      Can I make a friendly suggestion?

                                        HILDY
                      Nope.

                                        TERRY
                      Try lowering your standards.

      They walk past the terraced gardens, towards APPLICON S 
      main entrance. Hildy pushes through the doors, then turns 
      back to Terry and smiles.

                                        HILDY
                      Maybe Erich Blount is single?

      Off on Terry, not amused. Touch .

                                                                              CUT TO:


      INT. PROGRAMMER S BULLPEN - APPLICON OFFICES - DAY

      High above, ERICH BLOUNT walks onto a floor of COMPUTER 
        PROGRAMMERS -- Applicon s nerve center.                                                                                         18.


        Everyone looks barely out of high school, dressed 
        casually, listening to music on headphones, hacking away. 
      One by one they notice Blount and stop working.

                                        BLOUNT
                      It s gametime. Who wants a promotion?

        A beat. Everyone gathers around, nervous and excited. 
        Blount s not just the boss, but a rock star to them.

                      I need a new senior programmer. You ll be

                    So the game is simple. One of our 
                      corporate partners has been using a bug 
                    in one of our Apps to collect UDIDs--
                      unique device identifiers--zip codes, 
                      phone numbers, user preferences...a 
                      pretty sophisticated violation of

        Excitement in the room.

      INT. LOBBY - 101 CALIFORNIA CENTER - MOMENTS LATER

      Terry and Hildy wait at the MAIN DESK in the bustling, 
        marble lobby. SUITS and PROGRAMMERS swarm to and fro. 
        SALTER approaches them. Terry smiles at his old buddy.

                                        TERRY
                      Captain Salter!

                                        SALTER 
                              (shaking hands)
                      It s just Jimmy now, Terry. Miss 
                      Mulligan.

                                        HILDY
                      Nice to meet you. I ve heard good things. 

                                        SALTER
                      You ve got two minutes. Make it snappy.

      They follow him towards the ELEVATOR BANK.

                                                                              CUT TO:


      INT. PROGRAMMER S BULLPEN - APPLICON OFFICES - SAME

        Blount walks through the programmers, admiring the chaos 
      that he has created, as BAY-BELL DATA pours over screens. 

                                        TONIA
                      Got it!

      An attractive young female programmer, TONIA (20) with 
      funky blue hair, pushes back from her desk. Blount moves 
      to her, studies her screen. 

      ANGLE AT THE EXIT -- Salter, Terry and Hildy appear and 
      stand at the edge of the room, quietly watching.

      Then a LOUD RING. It s Blount s CELL. He looks at it, 
        caught off guard. Concern on his face. He answers, 
        putting it on speaker phone.

                                        BLOUNT (INTO PHONE)
                      This is Erich.

                                        SHEPARD (O.S.)
                              (phone filter)
                      Blount! What the hell?!

                                        BLOUNT (INTO PHONE)
                      Who s this?

                                        SHEPARD (O.S.)
                      Bob Shepard!

        SHEPARD S voice is ferocious, you can feel his anger 
        spilling out of the phone. Panic ripples across the room. 
      Terry and Hildy share eyes. Blount feigns surprise.                                                                                        20.


                                        BLOUNT (INTO PHONE)
                      What s wrong, Bob?

                                        SHEPARD (O.S.)
                    My network s being hacked. Two million 
                      customers are about to lose phone 
                      service. It s a goddamn meltdown. 

                                        BLOUNT (INTO PHONE)
                              (beat, downplaying)
                      It s gotta be China.

                                        SHEPARD (O.S.)
                      Bullshit, it s you! Your entire 
                      programming department is attacking my 
                      main frame! I ve got all the IPs right 
                      here! I m calling the FBI!

        Blount looks around at his team. Terror on their faces, 
      as they all push back from their machines.

                                        BLOUNT (INTO PHONE)
                      Slow down, Bob. Let s figure this out.

                                        SHEPARD (O.S.)
                      Who the hell s Tonia Kravitz?

      All eyes swing to TONIA. She s nervous, sweating. 

                                        BLOUNT (INTO PHONE)
                      She s new. Entry level. 

                                        SHEPARD (O.S.)
                      Let me talk to her.

        Blount indicates her over, hands her the phone. She 
        swallows hard, totally in shock.

                                        TONIA (INTO PHONE)
                      Hello. This is Tonia.

        A beat. Then a sweet new tone by Shepard.

                                        SHEPARD (O.S.)
                      Congratulations Tonia. Well done. You 
                      just got promoted.

        Everyone computes, then GROANS. LAUGHTER. They ve been 
      had. Blount eyes Tonia, as she exhales.

                                        BLOUNT
                      Nice work. That was fun.

      He turns and sees Salter standing with Terry and Hildy. 
        Salter nods, indicating him over.

                                                                              CUT TO:                                                                                        21.


      INT. ALCOVE - APPLICON OFFICES - MOMENTS LATER

        A small alcove on the other side of the elevators.  
        BLOUNT studies a photo of KEVIN NEYERS. Salter stands by 
      the door. HILDY and TERRY stare out the WINDOWS -- the 
      same CITY perspective as in the opening hologram. 

        Blount looks at Hildy. They hold eyes for a brief second  
      -- a flash of chemistry, which Terry catches. Blount 
      hands Terry the photo of Neyers.

                                        BLOUNT
                      It s hard to say. I meet a lot of people. 
                      Why? Who is he?

                                        HILDY
                      Kevin Neyers. He was killed last night in 
                      the Tenderloin.

                                        TERRY
                      Shot in the head. Point blank.

        A beat, as Blount processes, blown back.

                                        HILDY
                    We found an iPad in his apartment. The 
                      last e-mail he sent was two nights ago. 
                    It was to you.

      Terry hands Blount a printout, which he reads.

      ANGLE ON PRINTOUT, E-MAIL MESSAGE READS: 

              TO: ERICH BLOUNT
              FROM: KEVIN NEYERS
              Erich, my boy.
              Help an old man out. 
              $50,000 by dawn, or I ll go public.
              Last chance.
              KN

        Blount studies it.

                                        TERRY
                    Do you remember getting that e-mail?

                                        BLOUNT
                      No. But I m way behind on e-mails. We had 
                      a corporate retreat in Santa Fe. I ve 
                      been out of town all week. 

      Terry and Hildy look at Salter. He nods, confirming. 

                                        HILDY
                    Do you have any idea who this guy is, or 
                      what he s referencing when he says he ll 
                    go public?                                                                                        22.


                                        BLOUNT
                              (shakes his head)
                      I get three thousand e-mails a day. 

                                        TERRY
                    Do they all involve blackmail?

                                        BLOUNT
                      Most ask for money. Some send business 
                      proposals, others issue vague threats. It 
                      comes with the territory. We log them 
                      all. Jimmy can show you.

                                        HILDY
                      Any idea how he tracked down your 
                      address?

                                        BLOUNT
                      Erich at Applicon dot com. It s public, 
                    on our web site. I try to stay 
                      accessible. 

                                        TERRY
                      Man of the people.

      Hildy and Salter shoot Terry eyes: behave.

                                        SALTER
                      Okay, I think we re done. 

        Blount smiles at Hildy, who smiles back. There s a subtle 
        chemistry between them. Then Blount abruptly walks off. 

        Salter guides Terry and Hildy back to the elevators. 
      Hildy hands Salter her business card.

                                        HILDY
                    If he remembers anything, have him give 
                    me a call. That s my cell.

                                                                              CUT TO:


      INT. UNMARKED CRUISER - LATE AFTERNOON

      Hildy drives through the city, back towards the 
        Tenderloin. Remnants from the LUNAR PARADE line the 
        streets. Terry stares out the window, thinking.

                                        TERRY
                      That stunt with his programmers? He s a 
                      pretty good liar.

                                        HILDY
                    As far as the e-mail goes, I thought he 
                      was credible.

                                        TERRY
                    He was smooth.                                                                                        23.


                                        HILDY
                    He was in Santa Fe. 
                              (beat)
                      Why? You think he knows more?

                                        TERRY
                      Guys like him always know more.

                                        HILDY
                      Well I thought he was charming.

      Terry shoots her suspicious eyes. She smiles, teasing. 

                                        TERRY
                      Let s just go find our copper thieves. 

                                                                              CUT TO:


      EXT. BOEDDEKER PARK - SAN FRANCISCO - MAGIC HOUR

      Hildy and Terry walk into a Tenderloin park. Terry is on 
      the phone, dealing with his wife s move. 

                                        TERRY (INTO PHONE)
                      How many watts? I have no idea. Look, 
                      just set her up in the rear den. There 
                      should be two or three outlets on the 
                      wall. I ll be back within the hour.

      He hangs up. He s angry. The pressure is getting to him. 

                                        HILDY
                    Go home. I can handle this.

      He looks around. The park is full of addicts, drunks, and 
      local street kids playing basketball.

                                        TERRY
                      No. But let s make this quick.

      They approach the court where B-HOP (12) twists past his 
        defender, down the lane, as FRANKLIN (13) feeds him the 
      ball for a reverse lay up. Hildy grabs a RUCKSACK on the 
      edge of the court. Franklin and B-Hop see her, rush over.

                                        B-HOP
                      YO! PUT THAT DOWN!

                                        TERRY
                              (flashing his badge)
                      B-Hop? Franklin? We need to talk.

      Hildy joins them, holding the rucksack. She opens it and 
      dumps its contents -- FULL OF COPPER and SCRAP METAL. 

                                        HILDY
                      You two are in serious trouble.                                                                                         24.

                      We ve got you on video.

      The boys swallow hard, terrified. Franklin makes a break 
      for it, SPRINTING. But Terry lunges after him, grabbing 
      him by the neck and pulling him to the ground. 

      Hildy keeps her eye on B-HOP, but he s not going 
        anywhere, frozen, tongue-tied, in shock. His pants are 
        wetting from the inside. Franklin shoots him eyes.

                                        FRANKLIN
                      B-Hop! What are you doin , man?

                                        TERRY
                      Pissing his pants. 

                                        HILDY
                      You re scared because you know something 
                      about that murder.

                                        B-HOP
                    We didn t kill nobody.

                                        TERRY
                      Maybe. But you know who did.

        A beat as the boys hesitate, looking at each other.

                                        HILDY
                      Obstruction of justice on a first degree 
                      murder. Your prints at the scene. Not to 
                      mention the copper. Destruction of city 
                      property. Grand theft. 

                                        TERRY
                      Plenty to get you two tried as adults.

                                        FRANKLIN
                    We didn t see nothing. 

                                        B-HOP
                              (cracking)
                      Tell  em Franklin.

        Franklin is stone-faced. He s not talking. Terry looks at 
        Hildy. His eyes say, play along.                                                                                        25.


                                        TERRY
                      Suit yourself.

      Terry takes out his cuffs and grabs B-Hop by the ear, 
      hard. Hildy takes Franklin by the arm.

                                        TERRY (CONT D)
                      You have the right to remain silent...

                                        FRANKLIN
                      Whoa! Whoa!

                                        HILDY
                      Anything you say, can and will...

                                        B-HOP
                      Okay! Maybe we saw someone in there.

                                        FRANKLIN
                              (to B-HOP)
                      Cabron! You gonna get us killed.

                                        HILDY
                      What d he look like?

                                        B-HOP
                      Like one of those white bikers. 

      Hildy and Terry share eyes and let up some. Bingo. 
        Franklin exhales, the cat s out of the bag.

                                        FRANKLIN
                      Hells Angel. But homeless. Smelled like 
                      piss.

                                        B-HOP
                      He s a dealer. Crazy. Always packing.

                                        FRANKLIN
                      He s gonna kill us when he hears we 
                      ratted him out.

                                        HILDY
                      What s his name?

                                        B-HOP
                      Blue Big Bird.

                                        HILDY
                      Blue what?

                                        FRANKLIN
                      That s what we call him. 

                                        B-HOP
                    He has Big Bird inked on his neck. But 
                      it s blue.

      Hildy and Terry hold eyes. They ve got a lead. They 
        release the two boys, who brush off.                                                                                        26.


                                        B-HOP (CONT D)
                      Yo, do I need a lawyer?

                                        TERRY
                    Go on. Beat it.

      They look at them, then grab their RUCKSACK and jog away. 
      Hildy smiles, pleased with their progress.

                                        HILDY
                      Blue Big Bird.

        Terry s phone buzzes. He looks at the screen: EMILY

                                        TERRY
                      I gotta get home.

                                                                              CUT TO:


      EXT. OUTER RICHMOND - NIGHT

        HEADLIGHTS pierce through the fog that shrouds a flat, 
        middle-class neighborhood. We track an UNMARKED CRUISER 
      as it passes, then pulls into a driveway and parks.


      INT. TERRY S HOME - MOMENTS LATER

      Terry opens the FRONT DOOR, turns on a LIGHT. A beat, 
      then a short, attractive Dominican woman, NURSE JOSEFINA 
      (35), appears from the hallway.

                                        NURSE JOSEFINA
                    Hi Mister Seagrave, I m Josefina.

                                        TERRY
                      The nurse?

                                        NURSE JOSEFINA
                      Yes. Doctor Shrake sent me over.

      Terry just stares at her. He s not ready for this.


      INT. DEN - TERRY S HOME - MOMENTS LATER

      EMILY is lying a hospital bed, which has been situated by 
      the window overlooking the city. She s sweating, staring 
      out. Terry quietly enters, stopping and staring at her. A 
      beat. She knows he is there, but doesn t look.

                                        EMILY
                      I m not suddenly contagious.

      She turns and smiles, but none of this is funny to Terry. 

                                        TERRY
                      I met Josefina.                                                                                        27.


                                        EMILY
                    My new best friend.

                                        TERRY
                      She seems nice.

                                        EMILY
                      She s helping me die. She better be nice.

      Terry exhales, biting his tongue. He eyes a PICTURE FRAME 
      on the mantle above her bed--

      ANGLE ON PHOTO: A younger Terry standing between Emily 
      and Hildy, arm in arm at a picnic. A simpler time.

                                        TERRY
                      Your sister called me. I told her to come 
                      over in the morning.

                                        EMILY
                      Great. If cancer doesn t kill me, her 
                      stories will.

        A beat. Terry s had enough.

                                        TERRY
                      You gotta stop saying things like that, 
                      Emily.

                                        EMILY
                      Saying what?

                                        TERRY
                      Making jokes.

      She turns and looks out the window, biting her tongue.

                                        TERRY (CONT D)
                      Look. I m going to take a couple days off 
                      from work. I should be here with you.

                                        EMILY
                              (cold and firm)
                      We ve discussed this. You d go crazy. 
                      Keep living, Terry. Go to work.

      Off on Terry, exhaling. He has no idea how this works.

                                                                            FADE OUT:

                                            ACT 3

      FADE IN:


      EXT. 850 BRYANT STREET - MORNING - DAY TWO

      Sun glints off the windows of 850 Bryant Street.

                                                                              CUT TO:


      INT. ROOM 455 - HOMICIDE - SAME

      HILDY is working on her computer. KOTO is looking over 
      her shoulder. NAVARRO is at his desk. They all do their 
      best to ignore Terry, who is in a foul mood, struggling 
      to close a stuffed, broken drawer in his desk. 

      He rattles it around, forcing it. Angry. Then he finally 
      just rips the drawer out, SLAMMING IT ON THE FLOOR. It 
      makes a loud sound, like a GUN SHOT. 

        Everyone stares at Terry like he s lost his mind. A beat. 
      Terry leaves. Then Koto looks at Hildy.

                                                                              CUT TO:


      INT. HALLWAY - 850 BRYANT STREET - CONTINUOUS

        Terry, fuming, crosses the hall and slams into the men s 
      room, nearly breaking the door.

                                                                              CUT TO:


      INT. MEN S ROOM - 850 BRYANT STREET - MOMENTS LATER

        Terry, at the sink, splashes water on his face, then 
      dries himself with a paper towel. He stares into the 
        mirror, angry, but trying to gather himself.

      The door opens and Hildy enters. She looks to make sure 
      they are alone, then moves next to Terry. A long beat. 
      She doesn t know what to say.

                                        TERRY
                      Don t tiptoe around me. 

                                        HILDY
                      Look, you re going through a lot. 
                      Everyone understands.

                                        TERRY
                      What do they understand? Because I don t 
                      understand any of it! 

                                        HILDY
                    So bag it and go home. Go be with Emily.                                                                                        29.


        A tough beat. He shakes his head, then turns to Hildy, 
        lowering his guard, desperation in his eyes.

                                        TERRY
                      I can t just sit there and watch her die. 

                                                                              CUT TO:


      INT. ROOM 455 - HOMICIDE - MOMENTS LATER

      Hildy and Terry return from the bathroom. Terry is 
        composed now, all business. They gather around Hildy s 
        computer again, with Koto and Navarro looking on.

      ANGLE ON HILDY S COMPUTER: Flickering with faces, as she 
        searches the criminal database for BIG BIRD TATTOOS.

                                        KOTO
                      How many Big Bird Tattoos?

                                        HILDY
                      Fifteen.

                                        NAVARRO
                      And who said PBS is on the ropes?

                                        HILDY
                      The problem is, none of them are blue.

                                        TERRY
                      Maybe we ve got the wrong character.

                                        KOTO
                      What else do we have?

                                        TERRY
                      Not much. Neyers doesn t seem to have any 
                      living relatives. His body s still 
                      unclaimed at the morgue.

                                        HILDY
                    We looked back through his record. He had 
                      a regular accomplice early on.

                                        TERRY
                        A girlfriend.

                                        KOTO
                    Is she worth talking to?

                                        HILDY
                      She s dead. Oakland P.D. found her in an 
                      alley 25 years ago. Coroner said it was a 
                      routine O.D.. No foul play.

                                        TERRY
                      But Neyers and this girl got in a lot of 
                      trouble together.                                                                                         30.


                                        HILDY
                      Her parents are still around. James and 
                      Betty Harbach. We ve got an address for 
                      them in Oakland. At the moment, other 
                      than Blue Big Bird, that s all we ve got.

                                        TERRY

                      Blount claims he didn t get the e-mail. 
                    He was in Santa Fe.

        A beat. MOLK enters from the break room, full of vigor.

      EXT. BAY BRIDGE - DAY

      The UNMARKED CRUISER moves east, across the BAY BRIDGE.

                                                                              CUT TO:


      EXT. HARBACH S HOME - OAKLAND - CONTINUOUS

        A poor neighborhood in East Oakland. Hildy and Terry get 
      out of their cruiser. They move to the porch of a 
        dilapidated single family home with bars on the windows 
      and doors. Tough young men watch from the street corners.                                                                                        31.


      Terry watches the street, while Hildy knocks several 
        times. The door finally opens, answered by a grouchy 
      JAMES HARBACH (80) in sweatpants with electrocuted hair. 
      He looks Terry and Hildy over. They flash their badges.

                                        TERRY
                      Mr. Harbach? Inspector Seagrave, my 
                      partner Inspector Mulligan.

                                        HILDY
                    We just need a minute of your time.

      INT. HARBACH S HOME - OAKLAND - MOMENTS LATER

      James Harbach triple locks the door. The house was last 
        decorated in the 1970s. A variety of old exercise 
        equipment. Oakland A s memorabilia. Golf on the TV. 

      Terry and Hildy are greeted warmly by BETTY HARBACH (70), 
        dressed like June Cleaver.

                                        BETTY HARBACH
                      Would you like some tea? 

                                        JAMES HARBACH
                      Make this quick. I m watching golf.

                                        BETTY HARBACH
                      I don t drink black teas, I m allergic to 
                      tannins. But I do have green, camomile, 
                      and pomegranate.

                                        JAMES HARBACH
                      Who died?

                                        HILDY
                      Green tea would be nice.

                                        TERRY
                      Your daughter, Sarah Harbach--

                                        JAMES HARBACH
                      She died 25 years ago. You re late.

                                        TERRY
                      --She had a friend named Kevin Neyers. 

                                        HILDY
                    He was murdered two nights ago. We found 
                      his body in the Tenderloin.

      An awkward beat, as James and Betty barely flinch. Betty 
      moves to the kitchenette, puts a pot on the stove.

                                        JAMES HARBACH
                      Well if you find out who killed him, give 
                      them our congratulations.                                                                                         32.


                                        HILDY
                      I know it s been a long time, but do you 
                      know of any enemies he might ve had? 

                                        JAMES HARBACH
                      Sure. Here s a list of them.

      James picks up a WHITE PAGES off the floor and tosses it 
      to Terry. He catches the book and eyes Hildy.

                                        BETTY HARBACH
                    He killed our daughter. You understand.

                                        HILDY
                      I thought she died from an overdose.

                                        BETTY HARBACH
                    He fed her those drugs. It s how he 
                      controlled her.

                                        JAMES HARBACH
                    He was an addict. A pimp. He turned our 
                      daughter out, knocked her up, and then 
                      left her to die.

                                        TERRY
                      When was the last time you saw him?

      Betty and James hold a look.

                                        JAMES HARBACH
                    It had been 25 years.

                                        BETTY HARBACH
                      And then about 6 months ago he showed up.

                                        JAMES HARBACH
                    He tried to squeeze some money out of us. 
                      I told him to get lost or I d call the 
                      cops. 

      Terry takes out a piece of paper and hands it to James. 

                                        TERRY
                      That s the last message Kevin Neyers 
                      sent, the night before he was killed.
                              (James studies it.)
                    Do you know the man he sent it to? 

      Betty moves to James and looks at the e-mail. Shock reads 
      on both of their faces, as they look at Hildy and Terry. 

                                        JAMES HARBACH
                      Erich Blount.

      EXT. ALLEY - EAST OAKLAND - MOMENTS LATER

      JAMES and BETTY HARBACH slowly walk and talk with HILDY 
      and TERRY, down an alley, towards MLK. They are wearing 
        winter coats. James is eager to show them something.

                                        BETTY HARBACH
                      When Sarah got pregnant, she came to us 
                      for advice. We knew it was Kevin s. 

                                        JAMES HARBACH
                    We told her to get rid of it. 

                                        BETTY HARBACH
                      But Sarah wanted to keep it. She moved 
                      back here to the East Bay and started 
                      going to the 12-step meetings. They meet 
                    in the basement of that church.

      Betty indicates a CHURCH, visible at the corner.

                                        JAMES HARBACH
                      She was good for a while. We had our 
                      daughter back. She gave birth to a boy. A 
                      beautiful boy. We were grandparents. 

                                        BETTY HARBACH
                      But the pressure got to her and she fell 
                      back into things with Kevin. Back into 
                      the drugs. 

                                        JAMES HARBACH
                      Course he didn t want that baby, couldn t 
                      even look at it for fear that it might 
                      shock him out of his drug-addled haze.

      They reach MLK BLVD, near the CHILDREN S HOSPITAL.

                                        BETTY HARBACH
                      Once he had Sarah nice and strung out, he 
                      snuck out with our baby grandson and 
                      dumped him right over there, in the 
                      hospital parking lot. Left him in a box, 
                      like a stray cat.

                                        JAMES HARBACH
                      The world s better off with Kevin dead.

      They turn and move down another alley, which moves under 
      the elevated 580 FREEWAY. Cars whiz overhead.

                                        JAMES HARBACH (CONT D)
                      They found Sarah s body right over there, 
                      under this overpass.

                                        BETTY HARBACH
                    We tried to find our grandson, but by 
                      then it was too late. He was sucked into 
                      the system. We couldn t find him no 
                      matter how hard we tried.                                                                                        34.


      Terry and Hildy share eyes, moved by the story.

                                        BETTY HARBACH (CONT D)
                    We lost our daughter and our grandson, 
                      our only family, right here, by our home, 
                    in the space of three city blocks.

                                        TERRY
                      You ever think about moving?

                                        JAMES HARBACH
                      Nah, the pain from losing a loved one, it 
                      ain t something you can run from. It s 
                      internal. It sticks with you forever.

      Terry is taken aback, as thoughts of Emily suddenly take 
      hold. Hildy notices.

                                                                              CUT TO:


      INT. COFFEE SHOP - MOMENTS LATER

      Hildy and a subdued Terry finish their interview with the 
        Harbach s over coffee at an old fashioned diner.

                                        BETTY HARBACH
                    It was Erich Blount who figured out that 
                    he was our grandson. I have no idea how. 
                      But he had put it together. 

                                        JAMES HARBACH
                    He has money, Betty. You could find Jimmy 
                      Hoffa with his money. 

                                        HILDY
                    So Erich came and saw you first, before 
                      Kevin?

                                        BETTY HARBACH
                    He knocked on our door about a year ago. 
                      I knew he was our grandson the moment I 
                      laid eyes on him. He has Jimmy s nose.

                                        JAMES HARBACH
                    We had him in, talked to him for hours. 
                    He had a lot of questions. We told him 
                      everything, as best we could. Then he was 
                      gone. Just like that. Didn t leave us a 
                      penny. An address. Nothing. We haven t 
                      seen him since.

                                        BETTY HARBACH
                    Oh I don t blame him James. He doesn t 
                      owe us anything.

                                        JAMES HARBACH
                              (bitter)
                      A little charity wouldn t have killed 
                      him.                                                                                        35.


        A beat. Terry signals for the check.

                                        BETTY HARBACH
                      Can I ask...are you two married?

      Hildy almost drops her coffee. Terry freezes.

                                        BETTY HARBACH (CONT D)
                      Because I see you talking with your eyes 
                      the way us married couples do.

                                        HILDY
                      We re just partners. 

                                        TERRY
                      It s sort of the same thing. 

                                        JAMES HARBACH
                      But without the sex. Ha!

      Hildy looks away, embarrassed.

                                                                              CUT TO:


      INT. UNMARKED CRUISER - AFTERNOON

      Hildy drives Terry across the crowded BAY BRIDGE. They 
      are back at work, debating the investigation.

                                        HILDY
                    So let s assume Neyers was Blount s 
                      biological father and he was asking for 
                      hush money, to keep the family secret. If 
                      Blount really cared, why wouldn t he just 
                      pay the guy off and be done with it? 

                                        TERRY
                       cause then you re never done with it. 
                      The question is why did Blount lie to us.

                                        HILDY
                      We re cops. Everybody lies to us.

                                        TERRY
                    Or maybe he was involved.

                                        HILDY
                    Or maybe he just didn t want us digging 
                      into his past.

                                        TERRY
                      Too late for that, I guess.

                                        HILDY
                      Blount s interesting. There s no doubt 
                      about it. But his involvement in Neyers  
                      death is nothing more than a theory. He 
                      was in Santa Fe. We have zero evidence. 
                    We don t have a case. 
                                        (MORE)                                                                                        36.

                                        HILDY (CONT'D)
                      Now Blue Big Bird, that s a case. We ve 
                      got two witnesses placing him at the 
                      scene. 

                                        TERRY
                      Except we don t know that Blue Big Bird 
                      actually exists.

                                        HILDY
                      Molk and Navarro will find him. 

                                        TERRY
                              (shoots her eyes: please)
                      Let s have one more conversation with 
                      Blount.

      Terry DIALS A PHONE NUMBER, puts it on speakerphone.

                                        SALTER (O.S.)
                      Salter.

                                        TERRY
                      Jimmy, it s Terry Seagrave. Listen, I 
                      need to speak to your boss again. 

                                        SALTER (O.S.)
                      He s on his way to SFO. He s got a 
                      meeting in LA. 

                                        TERRY
                      When is he back?

                                        SALTER (O.S.)
                      Listen, Terry. His lawyer s David 
                      Hertzberg. You know him?

                                        TERRY
                      Pitbull. Sure.

                                        SALTER (O.S.)
                    He ripped my head off for letting you 
                      speak to Blount without him. I m on thin 
                      ice. From now on you gotta work through 
                      Hertzberg. Call his office. Set it up.

      Terry clicks off, shares a look with Hildy. He looks out 
      the front window. They are just off the BAY BRIDGE on the 
      101. Hildy puts on her blinker to exit downtown.

                                        TERRY
                      Don t exit. Stay on the 101.

      Hildy looks out the window at the SIGNS ABOVE THE 
        FREEWAY, INDICATING THE AIRPORT, then at Terry.

                                                                            FADE OUT:

      FADE IN:


      EXT. SFO TARMAC - PRIVATE JET TERMINAL - DAY - DAY TWO

      THE APPLICON G-500 is on the TARMAC, being gassed up and 
        loaded with a few bags. TERRY and HILDY exit the hangar 
      and cross the tarmac towards the plane s open door.

                                                                              CUT TO:


      INT. GULFSTREAM 550 - MOMENTS LATER

      Terry and Hildy enter the main cabin, looking around in 
      awe. CINDY eyes them from the rear galley, where she 
        unloads bottles of wine and sparkling water.

                                        CINDY
                      Can I help you?

                                        HILDY
                      We re looking for Erich Blount. 

      BILL WILKERSON (40), Blount s all-American Pilot, exits 
      from the cockpit, holding his flight log.

                                        TERRY
                      Are you the pilot?

                                        WILKERSON
                      That s right. Bill Wilkerson.

      They flash their BADGES.

                                        TERRY
                    We were told to meet Mr. Blount here. 
                      He s helping us with an investigation.

        Wilkerson eyes them up and down.

                                        WILKERSON
                      He ll be here any minute. Have a seat.

      Terry and Hildy sit in the plush leather seats. They 
      share eyes. The plane is spectacular and intimidating. 
      Terry smiles at Wilkerson, on edge.

                                        TERRY
                    Do you mind if I take a look at your 
                      flight log? 

        Wilkerson looks at him, caught off guard. He hands the 
        FLIGHT LOG to Terry. He flips through it.                                                                                        38.


                                        TERRY (CONT D)
                      You flew into Santa Fe on Monday. It says 
                      here you were parked there until you flew 
                      back on Thursday?

                                        WILKERSON
                      That s right. We were there for The 
                      Applicon Board meeting.

                                        TERRY
                    So Mr. Blount was with you?

                                        WILKERSON
                      Yes. It s his company. And his plane. 
                      What s this about?

                                        HILDY
                    Is there any chance Blount left Santa Fe 
                      during that period?

                                        WILKERSON
                      Not that I know of. We went jogging every 
                      morning. He had meetings all day with the 
                      board. Dinners and drinks at night. He 
                      was the center of attention all week. I 
                      doubt he had a moment to himself.

        HERTZBERG and BLOUNT enter the plane from the TARMAC, 
        surprised to find Hildy and Terry. An awkward beat.

                                        HERTZBERG
                      What s this?

      Cindy hides in the galley. Wilkerson hesitates. Blount 
        pushes past Hertzberg, recognizing Terry and Hildy.

                                        BLOUNT
                      Inspectors Mulligan and Seagrave. SFPD. 

                                        TERRY
                    We just have a couple of questions, Mr. 
                      Blount.

                                        HERTZBERG
                              (firm, to Hildy and Terry)
                      I m his attorney. We re late. Call my 
                      office. We ll set a meeting. 

                                        TERRY
                              (undeterred, to Blount)
                      It ll just take a minute. But we can have 
                      you come down to 850 Bryant Street if you 
                      prefer. 

        Hertzberg and Blount hold eyes. A blatant threat.

                                        BLOUNT
                      I ve got exactly one minute.                                                                                        39.


      Hildy takes out the photo of KEVIN NEYERS, and the E-MAIL 
      print out and hands them both to BLOUNT.

                                        HILDY
                      You sure you don t recognize this man?

                                        BLOUNT
                      I told you I meet a lot of people.

                                        TERRY
                      Which really isn t an answer. 

        A beat, as Blount studies Terry s face, dead serious. 
        Blount makes up his mind, and opens up.

                                        BLOUNT
                      Okay, yes, I ve seen him. His name is 
                      Kevin Neyers. Chances are he s my 
                      biological father. I m adopted. I was 
                      curious. Jimmy Salter and I did some 
                      research. We narrowed it down to this 
                      guy. I went to meet him a couple of 
                      months ago, I thought it might have some 
                      meaning, maybe answer some existential 
                      questions. But you saw how Neyers lives. 
                      He s a junkie. Worthless. I felt bad for 
                      him. But I didn t feel any sort of 
                      biological kinship. I was disappointed, 
                      but I was also relieved. I realized that 
                      I wasn t missing anything. I am who I am. 
                      I was raised by loving, adoptive parents. 
                      I lucked out. Kevin Neyers was my sperm 
                      donor, nothing more. So I gave him some 
                      money and said goodbye. But I guess he 
                      figured out who I was, found my e-mail 
                      address and started asking for money. 

                                        HILDY
                    He threatened you with going public.

                                        BLOUNT
                    To announce to the world that he was my 
                      father? Do you think anybody cares?

                                        TERRY
                      Maybe you care.

                                        BLOUNT
                      No, I don t. If anything, it s kind of 
                      funny. I mean, my dad was a junkie, a 
                      pimp and a two-bit con; and my mother was 
                    an addict and a whore. And here I am, on 
                    my private jet. Only in America, right? 

                                        TERRY
                      Why didn t you tell us this before?

                                        BLOUNT
                      You didn t ask.                                                                                        40.


                                        TERRY
                      Well then, I d hate to make that mistake 
                      twice. 
                              (beat, firm)
                      Mr. Blount, did you kill Kevin Neyers? 

                                        HERTZBERG
                              (reeling, furious)
                      That s enough! Don t answer that question 
                      Erich. 

                                        BLOUNT
                      Relax, David. I didn t kill Kevin Neyers. 
                      That s ridiculous, and they know it. 

        Blount looks at Terry and smiles -- back off.

                                        BLOUNT (CONT D)
                      Now if you ll excuse me, I have $400 
                      million on a table in Century City. 
                      Someone s trying to take it from me. I 
                      need to go get it back.

      Hildy and Terry hold a look. They re done.

                                                                              CUT TO:

        Blount stares out the window, lost in his head. His mood 
      is foul, as he looks out at BEVERLY HILLS.

      INT. LAW OFFICE - CENTURY CITY - AFTERNOON

        A bland conference room. BLOUNT and HERTZBERG are mid-
        negotiations, sitting across from JEREMY LEONARD (29), 
        over-dressed in Brioni, and HANK HOWEY (51), his lawyer. 
      The WEST HOLLYWOOD HILLS are visible out the windows.

                      The contract was signed based on 
                      misleading assumptions. It was for my 
                      services, not my proprietary IP.

                                        BLOUNT
                      I bought your company. It included your 
                      services, and your proprietary IP.

                                        BLOUNT (CONT'D)
                      It s right there in the signed contract. 
                      Have you read it?

                                        LEONARD
                      You misled me. You never used my 
                      services.

                                        BLOUNT
                      They weren t necessary. You should be 
                      happy. I paid you to do nothing.

                                        LEONARD
                      You defrauded me, Erich! All you ever 
                      wanted was my tree game app. You turned 
                    my software into 400 million dollars of 
                      revenue! I m entitled to a big chunk of 
                      that upside! 

                                        BLOUNT
                              (holds up his middle finger)
                      You re entitled to this.

        Hertzberg shoots Blount eyes, saying let me do this.

                                        HERTZBERG
                      How much is it going to take, gentlemen?

                                        HOWEY
                      200 million seems more than fair.

                                        HERTZBERG
                      2 million. Cash. Or we ll take it to 
                      court and win.

                                        LEONARD
                      That s insulting! That s nothing!

                                        BLOUNT
                      Actually, it s exactly 2 million dollars 
                      more than nothing. More than you deserve.

                                        LEONARD
                    Do you really want a messy trial, Erich? 
                      Just as you re ramping up for an IPO? 

                                        BLOUNT
                      Are you threatening me? 

                                        LEONARD
                      You claim you re this tech genius, this 
                      modern Edison! Wait until the world 
                      learns that you re a fraud!

      All eyes on Erich, full of rage. He leans across the 
      table and gets in Leonard s face. He could kill him.

                                        BLOUNT
                      You get nothing, you ungrateful prick. 
                      Without me, you are nothing. Worthless. 
                                        (MORE)                                                                                        42.

                                        BLOUNT (CONT'D)
                      I could find a thousand Indian 
                      programmers who could do what you did 
                      with that app. You re a gold digger, 
                      Leonard, and you happened upon a diamond. 
                      But you weren t even smart enough to 
                      recognize it. You should thank me for the 
                      pants you re wearing. Everything you have 
                      you owe to me. 
                              (beat, ferocious)
                      When I m done with you, with all the 
                      lawyer fees, you ll have nothing, which 
                    is exactly what you deserve. This is war. 

        Blount slams out of the room. Leonard is shell shocked. 
        Hertzberg stands and smiles, an ice-cold professional.

                                        HERTZBERG
                      Gentleman, see you in court.

                                                                              CUT TO:


      INT. GULFSTREAM 550 - MAIN CABIN - FLYING - DAY

        BLOUNT is in a foul mood, staring out the window as they 
      fly up the coast. HERTZBERG is seated across, eyeing him.

                                        HERTZBERG
                      How about a glass of wine?

      No reaction. Hertzberg motions to CINDY in the back. 

                                        BLOUNT
                      I want you to destroy him, David. I don t 
                      care how much it costs.

                                        HERTZBERG
                      I m happy to take your money, but you re 
                      making a mistake. Offer Leonard ten, 
                      he ll settle for twelve point five. 
                      That s chump change compared to the price 
                    of a trial. 

                                        BLOUNT
                    He gets nothing. Just do your job. 
                              (beat)
                    Or maybe I ll find a new lawyer.

        Hertzberg doesn t react, calling his bluff. 

                                        HERTZBERG
                      Maybe you should.

        Blount shoots him eyes, then an angry smile. Cindy 
        approaches and pours Erich a glass of wine. 

      Then the plane hits a sudden BUMP of turbulence and she 
        SPILLS THE WINE all over Blount s designer t-shirt. He 
      jumps out of his seat and pushes her back, enraged.                                                                                        43.


                                        BLOUNT
                      Idiot! 

                                        CINDY
                              (trembling)
                      I m so sorry. 

                                        BLOUNT
                      This t-shirt s worth more than you are! 
                      $400 bucks!

        Erich s wipes his shirt, seething, staring at poor Cindy, 
      venom in his eyes. She s stammering, frozen to the spot.

                                        CINDY
                      I ll get a...club soda.

                                        BLOUNT
                      Don t bother. 
                              (beat)
                      Your job is to make my life easier. But 
                      you don t do that, Cindy, which makes you 
                      useless.

        Blount pulls off his shirt and THROWS IT AT HER FACE. She 
        catches it, fumbling, tearing up. Overwhelmed. 

        Blount moves to a cabinet and opens it, full of clothes. 
      Then he realizes that Cindy is still standing there, 
        frozen. He shoots her condescending eyes.

                                        BLOUNT (CONT D)
                              (low, ice-cold)
                      You re fired. Get out of my face.

      Cindy rushes back into the galley, breaking down. 

        A beat. Then Blount exhales, shaking his head. He finds a 
      fresh t-shirt in the cabinet and pulls it on. Then he 
      sits back down and flips on the TV. 

      ANGLE ON TV: The Kardashians. Sexy and stupid.

        Hertzberg looks at Blount, all business.

                                        HERTZBERG
                      Feel better?

                                        BLOUNT
                              (thinking, then:)
                      Yeah. I do.

                                        HERTZBERG
                      Are you sleeping with her?

                                        BLOUNT
                              (smiles)
                      Not anymore.                                                                                        44.


                                        HERTZBERG
                      Well you can t fire her. With the lawsuit 
                      and everything that s going on...she 
                      knows too much. She could bury you. 

                                        BLOUNT
                      She s a flight attendant. She s nothing. 
                      And she can't talk anyway. She signed a 
                        non-disclosure agreement.

                                        HERTZBERG
                    So what? Hell hath no fury like a lover 
                      scorned.
                              (beat)
                      Look, Erich, at some point you need to 
                      realize that it is far better to have 
                      your enemies inside your tent pissing 
                      out, than outside your tent pissing in.

        Blount stares at the TV -- his emotions have vanished, 
        replaced by a cool pragmatism.

                                        BLOUNT
                      I ll take care of it.

                                                                              CUT TO:


      INT. BATHROOM - G550 - CONTINUOUS

      Cindy is reeling in the bathroom, wiping away tears. She 
        reaches into her pocket, pulls out a tin of ALTOIDS. 
        Inside is a vial of COCAINE and pink STRAW. She taps out 
        a line of blow on the glass wash basin -- a total pro.

      CLOSE ON HER HEAD, as she lowers it, snorting--

                                                                      MATCH CUT TO:


      INT. BATHROOM - CINDY S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

        --CINDY PULLS HER HEAD UP, and we re now in her 
        apartment. She s out of uniform, in her robe, doing drugs 
      and drinking wine. The doorbell rings. She stores the 
      coke in a drawer, then moves out into the living area-- 


      INT. LIVING ROOM - CINDY S TOWNHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

        A generic, mid-80s, two-story TOWNHOUSE, decorated with a 
        woman s touch. Cindy passes the staircase to the second 
      floor as the bell RINGS again. She opens the front door.

      Her estranged husband MARCO (34, Hispanic) is outside. He 
      looks harmless in his chinos and eyeglasses. But the 
      edges of tattoos are visible at his collar and cuffs.

                                        CINDY
                      What are you doing here, Marco?                                                                                        45.


                                        MARCO
                      I ve left you a bunch of messages. You 
                      won t return my calls.

                                        CINDY
                      Right. Get a clue.

                                        MARCO
                      Why you gotta be that way?

                                        CINDY
                      Because I don t want to see you. We re 
                      getting a divorce. That s how this works.

      Marco stares at her, takes a long look.

                                        MARCO
                      You re off.

                                        CINDY
                      I m what?

                                        MARCO
                      You re high. I can see it in your eyes.

                                        CINDY
                      You just can t handle the fact that we re 
                      done. Good bye, Marco.

                                        MARCO
                      When did you relapse?

      She starts to shut the door but Marco blocks it with his 
      foot. He s tough and not to be fucked with. He tries to 
      push past her, inside. But she blocks him, pushing him 
        wildly. He grabs her. She scratches at him, yelling.

                                        CINDY
                      Leave me alone!

      Marco pulls her inside and throws her to the ground. 
      She s reeling, scared. Marco looks around, in her purse, 
      on the shelf...then in the bathroom, opening the drawer 
      and finding the cocaine. He shows it to her.

                                        MARCO
                      What s this?!

                                        CINDY
                      I can use if I want. I can do what I 
                      want. I can sleep with whoever I want!

      Marco SLAPS HER, HARD right across the face, knocking her 
      down. He stares at her. He could kill her. But he leaves. 

      Cindy cries, in a heap on the floor.

                                                                            FADE OUT:

      INT. LOUISE S BEDROOM - HILDY S APARTMENT - DAY THREE

      Hildy is sitting on Louise s bed, tucking her shirt into 
      her jeans, then kissing her on the forehead.

                                        HILDY
                      Off to school, sweet Lou Lou.

                                        LOUISE
                      Mom, can I ask you a question?

                                        HILDY
                    Of course, babe. What is it? 

                                        LOUISE
                      What happens if you get shot at work?
                      Will I have to live with Dad?

                                        HILDY
                    No one s going to shoot me, Louise. 

                                        LOUISE
                      Then why do you have to carry a gun?

                                        HILDY
                      Because I m a cop. We all carry guns. 
                      That s why the bad guys don t shoot us.

                                        LOUISE
                              (beat; furrows her brow)
                      I don t like being divorced.

                                        HILDY
                      Trust me, it wasn t my original plan.
                      But when life gives us lemons...

                                        LOUISE
                      ...we make lemonade.

      Hildy looks at Louise lovingly. A car honks.

                                        HILDY
                      There s your ride.

                                                                              CUT TO:


      INT. LIVING ROOM - HILDY S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

      The front door is open, as Louise hugs her mom, then 
      exits with her backpack.

                                        HILDY
                      Have a great day, sweetie.                                                                                        47.


                                        LOUISE
                      I will! Bye! 

      She disappears down the stairs. Hildy closes the door.

      She exhales, then picks up a few of Louise s TOYS on the 
        floor. The TV is on low, playing THE GREAT MUPPET CAPER. 
      She moves to turn it off, but then one of the characters 
        catches her eye.

      ANGLE ON TV: As a giant, grumpy BLUE BIRD speaks.

                                        SAM THE EAGLE (ON TV)
                       At times like these, I am proud to be an 
                      American."

        A flicker in Hildy s eyes. Lightbulb.

                                        HILDY
                      Blue Big Bird!

      She opens up her LAPTOP, logs into the SFPD CRIMINAL 
        DATABASE and types in three search terms.

        TATTOO - NECK - SAM THE EAGLE

        A beat, then a MUG SHOT and PROFILE of a man named CHRIS 
        WALTON (38), flashes on screen. A perfect match. A long 
      list of convictions. She dials TERRY, smiling.

                                        HILDY (CONT D)
                              (into Phone)
                      I found our man.

                                                                              CUT TO:


      EXT. VA HOMELESS CLINIC - DOWNTOWN - DAY

        A crowd of HOMELESS VETS mull around outside a VA CLINIC 
      on 3rd and Harrison, beneath a modern apartment complex. 
      They are smoking, talking, lined up for service.

      TWO UNMARKED CRUISERS idle across the busy street.

                                                                              CUT TO:


      INT. UNMARKED CRUISER - DAY

      On the onboard COMPUTER SCREEN is an image of CHRIS 
        WALTON. Hildy and Terry scan the scene outside.

                                        TERRY
                      Looks like Christmas.

                                        HILDY
                      Free Methadone & Suboxone.                                                                                         48.


      Terry looks to the side where a smaller group of addicts 
        huddle in an alleyway, transacting business. 

                                        TERRY
                      That s our boy.

      She nods, then she looks in the rearview MIRROR -- Molk 
      and Navarro are in the cruiser behind.

                                                                              CUT TO:


      EXT. STREET/ALLEY - VA HOMELESS CLINIC - CONTINUOUS

        WALTON S POV -- Business done, he exits the alley, 
        nervously looking around, head on a swivel. The BLUE 
      EAGLE TATTOO is clearly visible on his neck.

      ANGLE ACROSS -- TERRY AND HILDY exit their car, guns out. 
      Molk and Navarro are right behind them. They cross the 
        street from their cruiser, towards the alley. Molk and 
        Navarro flank from both sides. 

        Walton, sensing their presence, suddenly bolts.

                                        HILDY
                      Police! Freeze!

        WALTON SPRINTS, dodging pedestrians then suddenly 
        pivoting into an alley. Terry and Hildy give chase. Molk 
      and Navarro get tangled up in terrified pedestrians, 
        scattering at the sight of guns. 

      CLOSE ON HILDY -- She s angry, fearless, and ready to 
      take this guy down. She chases Walton, sprinting down the 
        alley, dodging homeless men and debris. 

      CLOSE ON WALTON ahead as he turns down another alley -- 
        looking back as Hildy follows, about 15 yards behind.

      ANGLE ON TERRY behind Hildy. He sees them turn the 
        corner, but stays straight, sprinting down the first 
      alley to flank them ahead.

      ANGLE ON HILDY right behind WALTON now. He sees her and 
      busts through an ALLEY DOOR, AND INTO--

                                                                              CUT TO:


      INT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

      --A KITCHEN, full of CHINESE COOKS. Walton jumps around 
      the startled workers, towards the other side. He grabs a 
      pot of NOODLES, spilling it on the floor. Countermeasure.

      Hildy is through the door, right on his tail. She slips 
      on the steaming pile of noodles, CRASHING HARD TO THE 
        GROUND. Pain, as Walton escapes out the door, ahead.                                                                                         49.


      Hildy grabs the counter top, pulling herself back up to 
      her feet, then weaving through the COOKS, out the door.

                                                                              CUT TO:


      EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

        WALTON runs, flailing. Hildy pushes hard, her sidearm 
      out, sprinting after him, closing in. No sign of Terry. 
      But Hildy s surprisingly fast with an athletic gait.

        WALTON looks over his shoulder and sees that she is 
        making progress. He pushes, picking up speed. 

      They spill down a HILL, towards a FOUNTAIN. Walton again 
      LOOKS BACK, BUT THEN HE S ATTACKED FROM THE SIDE-- 

      TERRY TACKLES WALTON INTO THE FOUNTAIN.

      Hildy watches as they flail underwater. 

      Terry loses his grip. 

        Walton has the upper hand and REACHES BACK TO STRIKE--

      BUT HILDY FLIPS WALTON OVER, snapping his arm and 
        wrestling him to submission.

      She dunks his head in the water while Terry snaps 
        HANDCUFFS around his wrists. 

                                        HILDY
                      You re under arrest.

                                        WALTON
                      For what?

      Terry reaches into Walton s pockets and pulls out a zip-
      lock full of FENTANYL POPS. He shows them to Hildy.

                                        HILDY
                      For being an asshole.

      By the time Molk and Navarro show up, gasping for air, 
      it s all over.

                                                                              CUT TO:


      INT. HALLWAY - JAIL - 850 BRYANT STREET - DAY

      Hildy and Terry huddle with Koto as ASSISTANT DA LOPEZ 
      (34, Hispanic) approaches, clearly annoyed and pressed 
      for time. Hildy hands Lopez the FILE on Chris Walton. 

                                        HILDY
                      How much room do I have with this guy?                                                                                        50.

                      No. No family. No friends.

                      sentence, eligible for parole in 15. I ll 
                      use the federal statutes on mental vets 
                    as a mitigating factor.

      INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - 850 BRYANT STREET - DAY

        WALTON is handcuffed, seated at a table, wearing a dry 
      set of jail-house REDS, staring at a VIDEO CAMERA in the 
      upper corner of the room. HILDY and TERRY enter. Hildy 
      sits across from Walton, as Terry takes off his cuffs.

                                        HILDY
                      Talk to us about Kevin Neyers.

                                        WALTON
                      Who s Kevin Neyers?

                                        HILDY
                      The guy you killed two nights ago.

        A beat. Walton shoots her eyes and smiles.

                                        WALTON
                      Sounds like I need a lawyer.

                                        HILDY
                      Okay. That s your right. 
                              (beat)
                      But you understand that once you lawyer 
                      up, any chance of a deal goes out the 
                      window. 

                                        WALTON
                      I don t need a deal. I didn t kill 
                      nobody.

                                        TERRY
                      You know a man named Erich Blount?

                                        WALTON
                      No.                                                                                        51.


                                        TERRY
                      Were you hired by Erich Blount to kill 
                      Kevin Neyers?

                                        WALTON
                      Only ones ever paid me to kill a man was 
                      the United States Army.

      Hildy eyes Terry, she doesn t want to go down this road.

                                        HILDY
                      Let s go back to the night you killed 
                      Kevin Neyers. Why d you leave the 
                      fentanyl in his fridge?

                                        WALTON
                       cause you got the wrong man, understand? 
                      I didn t kill him. Now I want my lawyer.

      Terry leans against the wall behind Walton. Hildy looks 
      down at her notes, eyeing his rap sheet.

                                        HILDY

                      The list goes on.

                      We ve got your prints at the scene, and 
                      the Fentanyl Pops we found on your person

                        prescription of the batch we found in 
                      Neyers  apartment. Even if you didn t 
                      kill him, the jury s going to take one 
                      look at your ugly mug, and all those 
                      tattoos and scars, they re going to have 
                      a cup of coffee and a donut in the jury 
                      room, then they re going to send you to

                      What kind of a deal are we talking  bout?

      She pushes a pen and pad across the table.                                                                                        52.

                      state prison. I want federal, one of 
                      these cushy FCI s I keep hearing about.

                                        HILDY
                    Do I look like Travelocity? Would you 
                      like a rental car during your stay? 

                                        WALTON
                      FCI Herlong, up in the Sierras. Put me 
                      there at 20 and 15, and I ll confess.

                                        HILDY
                              (indicating the pad)
                      Write it out and you ve got a deal.

        Walton looks at her, then picks up the pen and starts 
        writing. Hildy stands to leave.

                                        WALTON
                              (beat, shit-eating grin)
                      One more thing. Since I m gonna be locked 
                    up for a while. Let me smell you, sweet 
                      thing. Come close.

        Terry, behind him, SMACKS WALTON IN THE HEAD, then yanks 
      his chair backwards, spilling him onto the floor. Hildy s 
        frozen in the doorway, as Terry KICKS HIM in the ribs.  

                                                                              CUT TO:


      INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

      As Terry slams out of the Interrogation Room, followed by 
        a seething Hildy. She gets right up in his face.

                                        HILDY
                      What the hell was that all about? It was 
                      over! He was writing the confession!

                                        TERRY
                    He needed to learn some manners. I took 
                      him to charm school.

                                        HILDY
                              (fierce and angry)
                    Oh and what are you, Prince Charming 
                      coming to rescue your poor little 
                      helpless female partner?                                                                                         53.


                                        TERRY
                    He deserved what he got. I was just 
                      trying to help.

                                        HILDY
                    If I needed your help, I would ve said 
                      so. 

      Terry leans against the wall, surprised by her response.

                                        HILDY (CONT D)
                      Look, I understand what you re going 
                      through, but that was over the line. What 
                    if he doesn t sign that confession? What 
                      happens then?

                                        TERRY
                      He ll sign. He s got no choice.

                                        HILDY
                              (firm, an order)
                    Go home. Be with your wife. Deal with 
                      your anger. I don t want to see you again 
                      until you re under control.

      Hildy walks away as Terry reels, frozen to the spot.

                                                                              CUT TO:


      EXT. OUTER RICHMOND - TERRY S HOME - NIGHT

      RAIN spills out of grey storm clouds, leaden by 
        moonlight. HEADLIGHTS approach us. Terry s CRUISER slowly 
        passes, parking in the driveway of his modest home. 

      He turns off the engine but doesn t get out. We watch 
        through the window as he sits, lost in his thoughts. 

                                                                              CUT TO:


      INT. DEN - TERRY S HOME - NIGHT

      EMILY stares out the window at the sheets of RAIN. TERRY 
        quietly enters. JOSEFINA is in the corner, folding 
        hospital sheets. She smiles at Terry, then leaves. 

      Terry stares at his wife. She s beautiful, illuminated by 
      the soft glow of CITY LIGHTS out the window. She can t 
      bring herself to look at him. An everlasting beat.

                                        EMILY
                    We had a good time, Digger.

      Terry smiles, his heart quietly breaking.

                                        TERRY
                      You haven t called me that in years.                                                                                        54.


      She turns and smiles, then motions him over. He gets into 
      the bed next to her, puts his arm around her. She rests 
      her head on his shoulder. They stare out, into the city. 

                                        EMILY
                      I was just thinking about your 30th 
                      birthday.

                      There was that one we kept riding over 
                      and over again.

                                        TERRY
                      The Inferno.

                                        EMILY
                              (she smiles; a good memory)
                      You were scared.

                                        TERRY
                              (feigns defensive)
                      You were the scared one. 
                              (beat; then smiles, admitting)
                    It was pretty high.

                                        EMILY
                      I d never seen you scared before. Until 
                      then, you were just this rock. Strong. 
                      Fearless. But the Inferno broke you down.

                                        TERRY
                    It was embarrassing. I was worried you 
                      were going to dump me right there. 

                                        EMILY
                      No, baby. That was the exact moment when 
                      I realized I loved you. That I would 
                      always love you.

        A long, raw beat. They share vulnerable, loving eyes. 
      Then Terry speaks quietly, tinged with desperation.

                                        TERRY
                      I m scared, Em.

                                        EMILY
                      I know. 
                              (beat)

      Terry looks at her, then out the window, welling up.

                                        EMILY (CONT D)
                      I m so sorry to be leaving you, Digger. 
                      Promise me that you ll keep on living. 
                      Live for the both of us. Cherish every 
                      sunrise, every cup of coffee. Keep 
                      laughing. Fall in love.                                                                                         55.


                                        TERRY
                      I ll never love anyone the way that I 
                      love you.

                                        EMILY
                    So love them differently. But don t stop 
                      loving. Don t look back. I ll be right 
                      there, making wise-cracks by your side.

      He looks at her, studying her face, her eyes, desperate 
      to remember this moment. Knowing it could be their last.

                                        TERRY
                      I m going to miss you, Em. Every minute 
                    of every day.

      Tears well for both of them, as we

      EXT. AIRPORT - MORNING - DAY FOUR

      STAN SHAW (35), Blount s uptight Mormon co-pilot, crosses 
      the tarmac towards the APPLICON JET. The plane is 
        attached to a FUEL TRUCK and being loaded with CATERING.

                                                                              CUT TO:


      INT. COCKPIT - GULFSTREAM 550

        Wilkerson presses buttons, loading in his next flight. 
      Shaw sticks his head in. He s worried.

                                        SHAW
                      I tried her home, her cell. Sent her a 
                      text. She s MIA. You sure she doesn t 
                      still think she s fired?

                                        WILKERSON
                      No, I talked to her last night. She said 
                      Erich apologized. She promised me she d 
                    be here. 

                                        SHAW
                      I ve got a weird feeling.

      They share a troubled look. Wilkerson looks at his watch.

                                        WILKERSON
                      We ve got a couple hours. I ll go to her 
                      house. Can you finish this up?

                                        SHAW
                    Of course.

        Wilkerson pushes out of the pilots seat, exiting.

                                                                              CUT TO:                                                                                        56.


      INT. DEN - TERRY S HOME - MORNING

      Emily is asleep. Her sister KAREN (45) is sitting by her 
      side, reading a book. Terry enters, showered and dressed, 
        holding his phone. He looks at Karen, uncertain.

                                        KAREN
                      It ll be fine, Terry. Go to work. 

                                        TERRY
                      You ll call me.

                                        KAREN
                      I promise.

                                                                              CUT TO:


      EXT. CINDY S TOWNHOUSE - MORNING - LATER

        WILKERSON and CINDY S LANDLADY (60) walk down the 
        sidewalk towards Cindy s Condo.

                                        WILKERSON
                      I knocked several times. Her car s in the 
                      driveway. She s been with me for three 
                      years and never once been late for work.

      They move up the driveway, past Cindy s RED JETTA to her 
      door. Concerned looks on their faces. Landlady knocks.

                                        LANDLADY
                      Cindy! 
                              (beat)
                    We should call the police.

                                        WILKERSON
                      It ll take them an hour to get here. Open 
                      the door.

      She knocks again. Then exhales and takes out her KEYS.

                                                                              CUT TO:


      INT. CINDY S TOWNHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

        LANDLADY and WILKERSON enter. The room is dark. The 
        shades are closed. Wilkerson turns on LIGHTS, revealing--

        CINDY, LIFELESS, NAKED, sprawled at the bottom of her 
      steep STAIRCASE. It looks like she took a brutal fall.

                                        LANDLADY
                      Dear Lord!

        Wilkerson rushes to Cindy, turning her head. Her eyes are 
      open, her neck broken. Terror on his face, and certainty. 
        Landlady leans against the wall, dizzy. Wilkerson sees a 
      PILL BOTTLE and scattered PILLS near Cindy s body.                                                                                         57.


                                        WILKERSON
                      Damnit, Cindy!

        Wilkerson turns and eyes the Landlady. She s frozen.

                                        WILKERSON (CONT D)
                      Call the police!

        A beat. Then she rushes, flailing, looking for a phone, 
      then heading outside.

        LANDLADY POV AS SHE OPENS THE DOOR -- BLINDING SUN FROM 
        OUTSIDE, WHICH WE HOLD, THEN-- 

                                                            SEAMLESS TIME CUT TO:


        INT./EXT. CINDY S TOWNHOUSE - CRIME SCENE - DAY - LATER

        --MATCH ON THE SUN, THEN PAN DOWN TO REVEAL-- 

        A GIANT CRIME SCENE. LANDLADY S POV now belongs to HILDY. 
      She s standing in the same spot, staring out the door. 
        UNIFORM COPS and EMT TECHS swarm the property. The street 
      is lined with CRUISERS, FIRE TRUCKS, and AMBULANCES. 

      Hildy turns back into the Townhouse. UNIFORMS work the 
      room, snapping photos, dusting for prints, collecting 
        evidence. Terry is by the body with an EMT TECH (40). 

                                        EMT TECH
                      Best guess is, it was an accident.

                                        TERRY
                      Couldn t she have been pushed?

                                        EMT TECH
                    If she d been pushed, she would have gone 
                      down the stairs head first. But she 
                      slipped backwards at the top, cracked the 
                      back of her head. 
                              (indicating)
                      You can see the indentation on her skull. 
                      And there s a blood mark on the top 
                      stair. That probably knocked her out. 
                      Then she tumbled down the staircase like 
                      a rag doll, hit her leg on the rail 
                      there, which caused that contusion and 
                      twisted her around. She landed on her 
                      neck. We can t confirm cause-of-death 
                      until the autopsy and toxicology report. 
                      They ll verify her injuries, and see how 
                      many pills she took. But the lady 
                      obviously fell down the stairs. 

      Terry and Hildy walk towards the front door. There s 
        tension between them, still lingering from Terry s 
        outburst with Walton.                                                                                        58.


                                        TERRY
                      Did Walton sign off on the confession?

                                        HILDY
                      Yes.

                                        TERRY
                      Are we okay?

                                        HILDY
                      You tell me.

      They stare out at the crime scene. On the front lawn, a 
        visibly shaken WILKERSON is giving his statement to a 
        UNIFORM COP.

                                        WILKERSON
                      She d never been late before. We knew 
                      something was wrong.

      Terry grabs a FRAMED PHOTO from the ENTRY TABLE next to 
      the door. He looks at it, then hands it to HILDY.

      ANGLE ON THE PHOTO: CINDY and ERICH BLOUNT, arms around 
      each other like lovers, standing in front of his jet.

                                        HILDY
                      Two deaths. 

                                        TERRY
                      One common denominator.

                                        HILDY
                        Coincidence?

                                        TERRY
                    No such thing.

                                        HILDY
                      What about Walton?

                                        TERRY
                      Guess we need to circle back.

      They share eyes, then stare back out at the wild scene.

                                        HILDY
                      Dust off your top hat. This is going to 
                    be a circus.

      Terry smiles. Then his cell phone BUZZES. He takes it out 
      and stares at the screen. His face is suddenly white, 
        drained of blood.

                                        TERRY
                      Emily.

      He stands there, frozen to the spot. Hildy pushes him.                                                                                        59.


                                        HILDY
                      Go!

      Terry snaps to and races out the door, to his car.

                                                                              CUT TO:


      INT. DEN - TERRY S HOME - LATER

      Terry stares at Emily, by her bedside. Emily s sister and 
        Josefina are behind him. The sister indicates them out of 
      the room, leaving Terry alone to say goodbye.

        A beat. He wipes away a tear. He looks at her face, her 
      eyes are closed. He puts his hand to her cheek, lovingly. 
      But it s different now. Just her body. She is gone.

      He reaches down, finding her hand, sliding off her 
        wedding ring. He stares at it in his hand, grasps it 
        tightly. He kisses her on the forehead, then stares out.

                                        TERRY
                      I m not saying goodbye. 

      He looks upward, as a tear streams down his face.

                                        TERRY (CONT D)
                      Don t you dare leave me.

      He wipes away the tear, then puts his head down, resting 
      it on her body, breaking down.

                                                                              CUT TO:


      INT. TERRY S HOME - NIGHT

      Terry sits in front of the TV. It s on, but he s not 
        watching it -- a thousand-yard stare.

      Emily is gone. The family, the nurses, the hospital bed, 
      it s all gone.

      He stands up and moves to the table and stares at TWO 
      BOXES full of his belongings from the hospital. 

      He takes out his model SAIL BOAT and carefully places it 
      on the DINING TABLE, centering it, then straightening the 
      thin wooden mast. He looks at his boat, sadness in his 
      eyes, then RAGE-- 

      HE SMASHES THE BOAT WITH HIS FISTS, over and over, 
        breaking it into a million little pieces. He sinks to his 
        knees, drained of emotion. 

        A long beat. The DOOR BELL rings, but he doesn t move.

                                        HILDY (O.S.)
                      It s me. I got your message. Open up.                                                                                        60.


      He slowly stands, then opens the door. Hildy is standing 
      on the front porch with a pizza and six-pack of beer. 
      He s too vulnerable to look her in the eyes.

                                        HILDY (CONT D)
                      Sausage, mushrooms and onions. 

      Terry indicates her inside. She puts the pizza and beer 
      on the kitchen table, pushing aside the scraps of wood 
      that used to be his MODEL BOAT. She takes off her jacket.

      They stand and look at each other. She moves to him, puts 
      her arm around him. Hugs him. He hesitates at first, then 
      lets her, taking refuge in her embrace. 

                                        TERRY
                      She was this beautiful light, this 
                      flower. 
                              (beat)
                      She was so much better than me.

      He looks at Hildy, then lets her go. She moves to the 
      table and cracks open two beers, handing one to him.

                                        HILDY
                    To Emily.

        A beat. Terry nods, then looks up and smiles. Silently 
        saying his farewell. They clink bottles and drink, moving 
      to the window, staring out. 

      RED AND BLUE LIGHTS dance across the horizon. The SFPD.

                                        TERRY
                      This job. What we do. I give it 
                      everything. 

                                        HILDY
                      You give it too much.

                                        TERRY
                      No. It s my chance, my one chance. To 
                      live right. To do good. 
                              (beat)
                      But no matter how hard we try, the world 
                      isn t just.  cause if it were, I d be 
                      dead, and she d get to live.

        A beat. Then he looks at Hildy and smiles, grateful.

                                        TERRY (CONT D)
                      You ve kept me going through this, Hildy, 
                      kept me on the rails.

      She smiles, then holds up her beer bottle.

                                        HILDY
                      Partners.                                                                                        61.


        A beat. He smiles, then clinks her bottle with his. They 
      stare out at the city together. Humbled. Alive.

                                                                            FADE OUT.

                                        THE END
