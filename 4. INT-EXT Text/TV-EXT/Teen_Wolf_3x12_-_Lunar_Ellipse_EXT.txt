      Blinking, Scott finds himself shivering in a cold rain in the 
      woods. He turns, gazing around in confusion at his new 
      surroundings. 

      Out of the corner of his eye, he spots a FIGURE moving 
      through the drizzling rain--A YOUNG MAN in a red hoodie 
      searching for something with the light of his phone s 
      display.

      Starting forward to get a better look, Scott blinks in 
        recognition. The young man is him.

      Standing in the drizzling rain, Scott watches, stunned, as 
      the memory of what happened flashes back to him with every 
      blink of his eyes.

      Pulling back in shock at the discovery of Laura Hale s 
      severed body, tumbling back down a ravine--

      Crushing the wet leaves underfoot, Scott starts toward his 
      younger self, almost as if he s trying to save him. He hears 
      himself SCREAM as he s brutally attacked and bitten by a 
      werewolf.

      But Present Scott stops short, finding himself standing in *
      front of the stump of the great tree. Mere yards from where 
      he was bitten. 

      Scott whirls back as--


      Stiles blinks under the drops of rain. Peering into the thick 
      of the woods, he sees FLASHLIGHT BEAMS and hears dogs 
      BARKING. Out of the shadows, TWO BOYS hurry toward him. 

      Stiles pulls behind a tree, listening to the familiar voices.

                                  SCOTT (O.S.)
                    Are we seriously doing this?

                                  STILES (O.S.)
                    You re the one always bitching that 
                    nothing ever happens in this town.

                    Besides, it s our last night of 
                    summer freedom.

      He peers out to see Scott and himself a year and a half 
      younger striding through the moonlit woods.

                                  SCOTT
                    I was trying to get a good night s 
                    sleep for practice tomorrow.

                                  STILES
                    Right, because sitting on the bench 
                    is such a grueling effort.

      Seeing the FLASHLIGHTS in the distance, Stiles races ahead, 
      trying to catch up while leaving Scott behind.

                                  SCOTT
                    Stiles! Stiles, wait!

      Stiles spins around and a dog BARKS, sending him slipping to 
      the ground.

                                  STILINSKI
                    Hold on, hold on!

      Sheriff Stilinski comes through the rain to berate the 
      younger Stiles.

                                  STILINSKI (CONT D)
                    This little delinquent belongs to 
                    me.

      Rain pressing down on him, Present Stiles backs away, 
      hurrying off when he stumbles into something rising out of 
      the darkness in front of him.

      The immense tree stump at the center of the Nemeton. 
      Realization dawning on him, Stiles turns, the world spinning 
      around him as--


      The SUV skids to a stop at the side of the road in the 
      pouring rain. Allison jumps out and quickly discovers PRINTS 
      in the mud leading into the woods.

                                  VICTORIA (O.S.)
                    Allison! Allison, wait--

      But she s already moving, hurrying into the thickening woods. 
      She slows, peering about in the shadows, eyes drawn to the 
      ground where she discovers something strange...

      Scott s INHALER.

      She carefully picks it up as Victoria steps in behind her.                    TEEN WOLF "Episode 312"BLUE5/6/135.

                                  VICTORIA (CONT D)
                    All right, that s enough. Back to 
                    the car.

      Before Allison can protest, they hear a HOWL in the distance.

      Unnerved by the sound, Victoria takes the inhaler from 
      Allison and tosses it.

      Flying past trees and out into a grove, the inhaler lands 
      right near the stump of the great tree. And right at the feet 
      of Present Allison.


      Outside his loft, Derek gets into the car with Cora by his 
      side. Peter looks in from Cora s window.

                                  PETER
                    Don t call until you re at least a 
                    hundred miles from here.

      Derek pauses at the wheel, however, unsure of his decision.

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    Go.

      Finally, Derek shifts into gear and pulls away.


      Headlights cutting through the darkness, Scott s motocross 
      bike and Allison s car soar into the entrance of the Beacon 
      Hills Preserve. Allison and Isaac get out to meet Scott as he 
      pulls his helmet off.

                                    ALLISON
                    Are you okay?

                                  SCOTT
                    I didn t know what to say to him. I 
                    couldn t come up with anything. But 
                    what you did--that was awesome.

                                    ALLISON
                    It was the best I could think of.

      Isaac looks at his phone.

                                  ISAAC
                    I haven t gotten an answer from 
                    Stiles? You guys?

                          (shaking his head)
                    I don t get it.

                                  ISAAC
                    We can t wait for him.

      Looking down at his phone with worry, Scott nods. A SOUND 
      catches his attention. He looks to Isaac who hears it as 
      well.                    TEEN WOLF "Episode 312"BLUE5/6/1320.

                    Was that Lydia?

      Before Scott can respond, both he and Isaac sense a presence. *
      They turn to see Deucalion standing just outside the shadows.

                                  DEUCALION
                    Cutting it a little close, aren t 
                    we, Scott?

                                  SCOTT
                    We got a little delayed. Where are 
                    the others?

                                  DEUCALION
                    Occupying themselves with other 
                    pursuits. Even an Alpha pack has to 
                    be democratic.

                                  SCOTT
                    Just you and me against her?

                                  DEUCALION
                    I think you ll be surprised what a 
                    good team we make.

      Scott turns to Isaac and Allison.

                                  SCOTT
                    Get Stiles and get to the root 
                    cellar. We ll keep Jennifer away 
                    long enough for you to get them out 
                    of there.

                                  ISAAC
                    How are you going to do that?

                                  SCOTT
                    I ve got a plan.
                          (off their looks)
                    Really.


      Hurrying through the woods, Isaac pauses behind Allison as 
      she slows to a stop.

                                  ISAAC
                    Are we going the right direction?

                                    ALLISON
                    I know we re near it. You think you 
                    can pick up a scent?

                                  ISAAC
                    I m trying.

      Turning about, Allison sees nothing but nondescript forest 
      all around her. She starts forward, but Isaac grabs her.

                                  ISAAC (CONT D)
                    I hear something.

      She holds still as he cocks his head, focusing on a familiar 
      rhythmic pulse.

                                  ISAAC (CONT D)
                    It s an Emitter. One of your Dad s.

                                    ALLISON
                    Are you sure?

                                  ISAAC
                    It has to be.

      Taking her hand, Isaac pulls her forward, both of them 
      charging into the thick of the woods in pursuit of the 
      pulsing sound.


      Under the howl of the rising storm, Allison and Isaac arrive 
      in a clearing at the center of which lies the stump of the 
      great tree.

      As Allison moves closer. Isaac s eyes flash YELLOW for a 
      brief moment, searching the woods.

      Hurrying ahead, they don't notice the dust swirling across 
      the ground. At first, it s merely wind pushing the dirt 
      across the arid landscape. But then the strong breeze turns *
      to powerful gusts, dust and dirt pluming into the air.

      Thunder RUMBLES above. A storm brewing.


      With the wind gaining intensity above, something truly 
      ominous occurs within the Nemeton. A section of the ground 
      around the stump CAVES IN, collapsing like a sinkhole.

      The storm builds outside the entrance to the root cellar, 
      wind whipping through the woods with ever-rising intensity.


      Through the open door, TWO SILHOUETTES look in on the same 
      distillery where Derek Hale once fell in love with a girl 
      named Paige. 

      Scott notices Deucalion s hesitation, the visible tightening 
      of his jaw.

                                  DEUCALION
                    You said you had a plan?

      Nodding, Scott takes out his phone.

                    On the first day of class, Jennifer 
                    sent all of us a message. It was

                    Heart of Darkness. I ve got a 
                    message of my own to send her.


      A VIDEO begins streaming on a phone. Shaky. An image walking 
      into the darkened interior of the distillery.

                                  SCOTT (V.O.)
                    You see this symbol?

      Scott turns the phone to Deucalion and himself.*

                                  SCOTT (V.O.)
                    You talk about balance. About 
                    saving people. We know what you 
                    really want. And now you know where 
                    to find us.

      The video ends. Derek by her side, Jennifer lowers her phone, 
      barely able to conceal her rage.


      Outside the doors of the distillery, Deucalion turns to face 
      Scott and Derek.

                                  DEREK
                    My mother told me you were a man of

      leaving Deucalion with his eyes restored in the very same *
      place they were once lost.

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


      Barely alive, a battered Jennifer crawls to the stump of the 
      great tree. Her fingers reach desperately toward its massive 
      roots.

                    Please... you saved me once...

      But just as her bloodied hand reaches for the stump, another 
      hand grasps hers and pulls her back. She looks up in anger at *
      a face she seems to expect.

                                  JENNIFER (CONT D)
                    Of course, it s you. Everyone else 
                    suffers, but somehow you come out
