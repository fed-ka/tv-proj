      MacLeod comes straight at the camera, his kendo stick
      slashing fast and furious.

      He's working out, and working up a serious sweat.  He turns
      to start back the other way when he hears a door.

      JOE DAWSON

      An uncertain smile on his face.

      MacLeod stiffens.  He's not happy to see him.  This is an
      awkward and troubled reunion for both of them.

                                            DAWSON
                              (awkward)
                        I just got back in town.

                        Paris turned out okay.  We're making
                        some changes, Mac.  I think the
                          Watchers are finally moving into the
                          twenty-first century.

                                            MACLEOD
                        You shouldn't be here.

                                            DAWSON
                        There's something else we have to
                        talk about.

                                            MACLEOD
                        No.  No, we don't.

                                            DAWSON
                        I think we do.

                        Joe.  Just turn around and go.

                        How many times do we have to be
                        taught?

      Dawson is not backing down.

                        What the hell do you want me to do?
                        I hear stuff and I can't ignore it.
                              (beat)
                        It's Richie.  A few days after...
                        after you left for Paris, he took
                        off too.  Disappeared.

      MacLeod wavers.


      Dawson is working the bar, facing MacLeod.  Richie is there
      too.  MacLeod is silent a BEAT.  He looks at Dawson.

                                            MACLEOD
                        What do you know about Dark
                          Quickenings?

      Dawson gives him a look.

                                            DAWSON
                        Come on, MacLeod.  You're reaching.

                                            RICHIE
                          Reaching what?
                            (off their silence)
                          Somebody mind filling me in?

      There's an uncomfortable beat.


      MacLeod's eyes gleam with a dangerous light -- he's smiling. 
      He pulls his sword.  Richie backs off.

                        Come on, Mac... What are you doing?

      MacLeod flicks his sword casually.  Richie dodges back,
      winces -- looks down at his chest.

      CLOSE - RICHIE'S CHEST

      there's a line of BLOOD across a slash in his shirt.  Richie
      pulls his bloodied hand away in disbelief.

                                            MACLEOD
                        You're a smart boy.  What do you
                        think I'm doing?

      MacLeod moves purposefully forward.  Richie scrambles back,
      yanking his own sword free.  He tries to fend MacLeod off,
      fighting with every ounce of skill he has.

                                            RICHIE
                          Whatever happened, we can fix it.
                        Don't do this...
                              (beat)
                        I'm your friend, dammit!

                                            MACLEOD
                        Sorry, wrong number.

      He lunges, wounds Richie in the shoulder.  Richie drops
      his sword and goes to his knees.  He tries to reach his
      sword with his other hand -- MacLeod kicks it away.

      Richie is defenseless.  He locks eyes with MacLeod.  Anger,
      pain, betrayal.

                                            RICHIE
                        If you're gonna kill me, I want to
                        know why!  The teacher kills the
                        pupil?  There can only be one?  Why!

      A BEAT of hesitation on MacLeod's part, an inner battle,
      something in there trying to stop him -- then it passes.

                                            MACLEOD
                        That's as good a reason as any.

      He raises his sword to take Richie's head.

      Richie winces, waits for the killing blow.

      MacLeod in the backswing, putting all his force into the
      blow -- there's a GUNSHOT -- and MacLeod staggers back,
      mortally wounded.  He looks up --

      DAWSON

      Stands there, the smoking gun in his hand.

      MacLeod snarls, tries to take a step towards Dawson, raise
      his sword but death strikes first.  He crashes to the floor.



      The place is empty except for Richie and Joe.

                                            RICHIE

      Richie still can't believe it.

      A local watering hole.  It's run by DELILA herself, a body
      builder.  Sex appeal with muscles, with a cigarette and a
      grin.

      WYATT EARP'S WILD WEST ELECTRONIC SHOOTING GALLERY

      Is blinking and popping as a guy gets beat to the draw by
      an electronic bad guy.

      RICHIE

      Radiating morose, at the end of the bar, nursing a beer. 

      OVER THE BAR

      A stained old sign announces: "BEAT DELILA, WIN A BEER"

      Below it, an off-duty UPS Driver, a middleweight, has an
      elbow on the bar, arm locked with Delila's, struggling to
      push it to the bar.

      Delila's arm is straining, too, but she's acting casual.

                                            DELILA
                        C'mon, Benny, why do you even bother?

      Richie, with a dismissive glance at the contest, mutters:

                                            RICHIE
                        Can't be for the beer.  They should
                        be giving it away.

      DELILA

      Annoyed, takes it out on the Driver, slamming his arm to
      the bar with unnecessary vigor.

      She turns on Richie, irritated.

                                            DELILA
                        Maybe the critic wants to try me?

                                            RICHIE
                            (re the beer)
                        For this?  No thanks.

      Delila reacts, then controls it.  She's a pro at taking
      shit from surly drunks.

                                            DELILA
                        You don't like it, go someplace else.

      Richie puts his arm up on the bar, shooting a look at the
      Driver as he addresses Delila.

      They lock arms.  Richie's strong, he's been working out,
      this isn't an easy one -- but Delila's a pro at this, her
      arm is locked, unyielding.  Richie strains, seems to be
      gaining the advantage, then --

      THE BUZZ

      Hits him.

      DELILA

      Takes advantage of his distraction to make the extra push
      and bend his arm back.  Victory.

      Richie's pissed.

      CARTER WELLAN

      Waltzes in like he owns the place.

                        That's Delila to you, Bud.

                        Delila?
                            (he likes that)
                        In that case I'll have a beer and a
                          haircut.

      He follows the BUZZ straight to Richie.

                                            WELLAN
                        I'm buying.

                            (on edge)
                        I don't need a haircut.

                                            WELLAN
                        How about a sense of humor?

      Richie stands and faces him.  Hard and suspicious and now,
      in a bad mood.

                                            RICHIE
                        How about you shut your mouth before
                        I do it for you?

                        I'm scared.
                              (turns his back on
                              Richie; to Delila)
                        Aren't you scared?

                                            DELILA
                        Petrified.

      Richie grabs Wellan's arm, turning him back.

                                            WELLAN
                        Do I know you?  Or you just go around
                        looking for trouble?

                                            RICHIE
                        Richie Ryan, and I'm looking for
                        you.

                                            WELLAN
                        The only head I came in here for was
                        on a beer, but if you want to take
                        it outside...

      Richie pushes in closer.

                                            RICHIE
                              (cold)
                        I want to take it outside.

      He gestures to the door.  Wellan turns and walks out. 
      Richie follows.



      Immortal HARESH CLAY pulls up to Delila's and heads inside. 
      This is an updated Clay, sporting a close-cropped fade,
      gold-hoop in one ear.  Still with the manner and bearing
      of a king.

                        Yeah, he was here.  Until some guy
                        picked a fight with him.

      This is dojo limbo.  Dark.  Unfurnished.  Spooky. 

      RICHIE

      Is working out in the dim light.

      THE DOOR

      Flies open and MacLeod storms in, pissed to find Richie
      there.

                                            MACLEOD
                        What the hell you think you're doing
                        here?

                                            RICHIE
                        What?

                                            MACLEOD
                        What the hell you think you're doing
                        here?

                                            RICHIE
                        I just needed a place to --

                                            MACLEOD
                        What the hell you think you're doing
                        here?

                                            RICHIE
                          I needed a place to --

                                            MACLEOD
                        You needed a place!

                                            RICHIE
                        To work out.  What's the matter with
                        you?

                                            MACLEOD
                        You want a work-out... work this
                        out.

      MacLeod draws his sword.

                                            RICHIE
                        Mac, what are you doing!?

      MACLEOD

      swings.

      RICHIE

      Jumps out of the way, saved by his reflexes.  MacLeod offers
      no quarter.

      RICHIE

      Scrambles for his sword.  He slips and falls. 

      MACLEOD

      Comes after him, kicks his legs out from under him. 

      RICHIE

      On his hands and knees crawls, skittering across the floor. 

      MACLEOD

      comes after him.

      RICHIE

      Reaches for his sword.  It's just out of reach but

      MACLEOD

      Is there first.  He raises the blade in a mighty swing.

      RICHIE

      Screams.



      ON THE SCREAM

      Richie bolts awake from the dream, in his room.  His head's
      intact but he's pretty freaked out.  Sweating, breathing
      hard, and a little disoriented.  He begins to calm down
      and barely gets a chance to catch his breath when he gets
      a BUZZ.

      He grabs his sword and heads outside to discover:



      Richie is back in his room, brooding.

      He gets the BUZZ just before he hears the knock on the
      door.

                                            RICHIE
                        There's nothing to say, MacLeod. 
                        Just leave me alone.

      SUDDENLY A SWORD

      Comes crashing through the door, splitting it.

      RICHIE

      Jumps up to defend himself.

      A HEAVY FOOT

      Kicks the door and the two halves burst open and fall away.

      HARESH CLAY

      Comes charging in, radiating fury.

                                            RICHIE
                        Who the hell are you?

                                            CLAY
                        For you, I'm the Angel of Death.

      Richie can't get to his sword on the far side of the room. 
      Clay comes at him swinging.  With a tremendous kick, Richie
      sends the big armchair tumbling toward Clay.

      CLAY

      Keeps coming.

      RICHIE

      Gets his hands on his sword but even before he can lift it
      away from the wall

      CLAY'S SWORD

      Swipes down across Richie's blade -- and BREAKS IT IN HALF.

      RICHIE

      With nowhere to go, he turns and dives through the window.

      Clay goes to the window to see --

      CLAY'S POV

      Richie jumps onto his bike and takes off.



      From behind, MacLeod is hunched over and then he raises an
      arm and BAM, pounds something.

      CAMERA COMES AROUND to REVEAL MacLeod brooding, lost in
      the repair of an old shield.  Once again he raises the
      small mallet and BAM, brings it down precisely, working
      out a little more of the dent.

                                            DAWSON (O.S.)
                        Mac?

      MacLeod's not happy it's Dawson.  He doesn't turn to look
      at him.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Why are you here?

                                            DAWSON
                        It's important.  Richie's in more
                        trouble than I thought.

                                            MACLEOD
                        I've seen Richie.  He can take care
                        of himself.

                                            DAWSON
                              (railing)
                        With what?

      Dawson produces RICHIE'S BROKEN SWORD from under his coat
      and in a fury slams it down on the counter --

                                            DAWSON
                        With this!?

      MacLeod reacts.  He picks up the sword, looks at the broken
      blade.

                                            MACLEOD
                              (reluctant to even
                              ask)
                        Who.

      As we push in on the sword and --

      On Richie's broken sword.

      PULL BACK to see MacLeod examining it.

                                            DAWSON
                        You still want me to stay out of it?
                              (beat)
                        I'm trying to help a friend, MacLeod.

      MacLeod is more pained over the loss of Dawson than he
      lets on.

                                            MACLEOD
                        You're not his friend, Dawson.

      MacLeod grabs Dawson's left wrist and exposes the Watcher
      tattoo.

                                            MACLEOD
                        This is who you are.

      Dawson pulls his arm away.

                                            DAWSON
                        I know who I am.  I've been a Watcher
                        over twenty-five years.  It's as
                        much a part of me as your clan MacLeod
                        is to you.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Then for once, keep your vow.
                        Don't interfere.

      Dawson swallows this.

                          business.

      MacLeod turns to face him.  He hates doing this but he
      doesn't see another way:

                                            MACLEOD
                        We're done, Joe.  We've got to be.

                        But watch someone else.



      It's three o'clock in the morning.  The club is closed but
      Dawson is in there cleaning up.  The door opens and Richie
      slips in.

                                            DAWSON

                        So I've been told.

      This is very embarrassing for Richie, but he takes a breath,
      overcomes his pride and says what he has to.

                        I need another couple of grand for a

                        Hey, Joe, how long you known me? 
                        I'm good for it.

      Richie's out on a limb here and doesn't like it.

                        Joe, this is me, Richie.

                        You saved my life!  You shot MacLeod --
                        that's not getting involved?

                        It was a mistake.

                        Saving my life was a mistake!?

                          I didn't think about what I was doing,
                        I just did it, I pulled the trigger.

      Dawson needs a moment to let that memory pass.

                                            DAWSON
                        Richie, as a friend, I want to help.
                              (displays the tattoo)
                        ... but as a Watcher, I can't.

      He looks at Richie, torn, pleading for understanding.

                                            RICHIE
                        That's real convenient, Joe.  Real
                        damn convenient.
                              (beat)
                        The hell with you.

      Furious, Richie storms out.  Dawson stays behind, not
      feeling at all good about himself.



      Richie moves through the place quickly, heading straight
      for the swords.

      The first glance is disappointing.  There are plenty of
      swords around, but they're not what he's looking for. 
      Then he sees --

      ANGLE CABINET

      In which there are four glorious swords.

      This is what Richie's looking for.  Any one of these will
      do, but the cabinet is locked.

      Richie starts picking the lock when he gets the BUZZ.

                                            RICHIE
                        Come on...  Come on.

      He starts to panic.  His fingers fumble with the lock.

      He tries to take a breath to calm down.  No dice.  And no
      time left to fuss with locks.

      RICHIE

      Smashes the cabinet open, setting off the ALARM.

      He reaches in for the most striking of the four swords. 
      It's bolted to the wall!

      He tugs at it but it doesn't budge.  The ALARM is wailing
      and the Immortal is getting closer.

      RICHIE

      Struggles with the sword.  No way it's coming free.  And
      it's too late.

      HARESH CLAY

      Steps into the room.

                                            CLAY
                        I knew you'd show up here eventually.

      CLAY

      Draws his sword and comes straight for Richie.

                        little lessons, the tendency is to
                        learn them too late.

                                            RICHIE

      Attacks with a wide open roundhouse swipe.  Too bold by

      Ducks the blow and rolls behind a display case.

      Raises his sword and brings it down hard on the display

      The sword CLANGS, the steel display case SPARKS, and the
      glass shatters and the knives scatter.

      RICHIE

      Bolts for the back door.



      The place looks pretty much like it did before.  A few
      customers, and Delila behind the bar wiping down the
      counter.

      The doors open, Richie strides in and heads straight for
      her.

                                            RICHIE

      She turns away.  Richie grabs her arm.  She flexes.

                        See that guy at the end of the bar? 
                        He's a cop and a real good friend of

                        he's gonna bust your ass.  What is

      He turns on his heels and heads for the door.  As he moves
      away from the bar

      Dawson is opening up.  He reaches the door, just as it
      opens -- MacLeod stands there.  Dawson is surprised to see
      him.  Neither one of them is very comfortable about it.

                                            DAWSON

                        And there's nothing you can do to
                        stop him.

                        Where's Clay?

      There's a pause.  Is Dawson going to throw his speech back
      in his face, tell him he can't get involved?  But after a
      beat -- Dawson hands him a slip of paper.

                                            DAWSON
                        Got it from a bartender.  Sort of a
                          professional courtesy.

      MacLeod starts back out.  He only gets a step or two before
      he stops and turns back.

                                            DAWSON
                        What do you think it is?

                                            MACLEOD
                              (stunned)
                        You're out of the Watchers.

                                            DAWSON
                        Maybe it's too late... or maybe it's
                        about time.  Like Mrs. Wischnoff
                        back home used to say --
                              (Yiddish)
                        Meit ein tuchas can Meir nisht danzen
                        a tsvai hossannas.

                                            MACLEOD
                              (translating)
                        With one ass, a man can't dance at
                        two weddings.

      Dawson nods, acknowledging the quote.

                                            DAWSON
                        You were right.  I couldn't be both
                        your Watcher and your friend.

      MacLeod nods.  He knows what it must have taken to do this,
      and he's touched.

                                            MACLEOD
                        I'm sorry.

                                            DAWSON
                        For what?  For making me choose?
                              (beat)
                        When I joined the Watchers it was
                        the most important thing in my life. 
                          Learning about Immortals, keeping
                        the Chronicles -- it seemed like
                          something that had to be done.
                              (beat)
                        Now it can be done by somebody else.

      MacLeod is thoughtful -- a little troubled.

      Dawson looks at him a long moment.  He watches him go.

                                            DAWSON

                                            ACT FOUR

      FADE IN:



      The elevator is empty when MacLeod comes across the hotel
      lobby and steps inside.

      He hits a button on the panel, the doors close and the
      elevator starts moving.

      Almost immediately, MacLeod gets a BUZZ.  Trapped, he draws
      his sword.



      THE ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN_

      and MacLeod explodes out swinging his sword defensively.

      No sign of Clay.

      Still getting the BUZZ he starts down the hall.

      ANGLE - A SWORD BLADE

      at the ready in an unknown hand.  Moving toward MacLeod.

      ANGLE MACLEOD

      Also ready.

      MACLEOD

      Raises his weapon for a head cut and pulls back just in
      time when

      RICHIE

      Turns the corner.  It's a close call, charged with recent
      bad memories.  There is an anxious beat.  Haven't we been
      here before?

                                              MACLEOD/RICHIE
                        What are you doing here!?

      Each waits for the other.

                                            RICHIE
                        How'd you get here?

                        Does it matter?

                                            RICHIE
                        It does if you're after Clay.

                                            MACLEOD
                        What do you want me to do, Richie? 
                        Stand aside and say go ahead, you
                        take him?

                        That's what you're asking me to do,
                        isn't it?

                                            MACLEOD
                        You'll lose.

                        Maybe not.
                            (off MacLeod's look)
                        Look, if there's one thing I've got
                        figured out, it's that I could die. 
                        Any time.  And I can't do anything
                        to change that.
                              (beat)
                        I got myself into this and I'm not
                        running from it.  Whatever happens --
                        I just do what I can do.  That's
                        all.

                                            MACLEOD
                        That's all any of us do.

      There's a moment of connection, there.  And then

      A HOTEL GUEST

      Steps out of his room to discover MacLeod and Richie with
      their swords drawn.

                                            GUEST
                            (very casual)
                        More of you with swords?

      MacLeod and Richie turn to him.

                                            GUEST
                            (re the swords)
                        What are all you guys, Shriners or
                        something?

                                            MACLEOD
                          Shriners ... yeah.

                        Me too.

                                            GUEST
                        So how come you're not at the funeral
                        with the other guy?

      MacLeod and Richie share a glance.  Bingo.

                                            MACLEOD

                        You're gonna be late.

      Richie and MacLeod exchange looks.

      Richie is sitting at the bar.  Richie's different, less of
      a chip on his shoulder, more at ease with himself.

                                            RICHIE
                        Mac said you quit the Watchers.  I
                        didn't believe it.

      Dawson rolls up his left sleeve and displays the healing
      scars.  Richie reaches for the wound.

                                            DAWSON
                              (immediately)
                        Don't touch it!

                                            RICHIE
                        Hurts?

                                            DAWSON
                              (beat)
                        The wrist isn't so bad.  The rest...
                        I left a lot of good friends.

      He shrugs.

      MacLeod enters in the background, listening.

                                            RICHIE
                        I can't say I'm sorry.  I know the
                          Watchers was your life, but secret
                          rituals, guys in black coats and
                        dark glasses?  It never really seemed
                        like your style, Joe.

      Dawson rolls down the sleeve, conceding.

                                            DAWSON
                        It was never meant to be like that.

      MacLeod has been listening, thinking.  He speaks up.

                        have fought and Watchers have
                          observed.  One day, there will only
