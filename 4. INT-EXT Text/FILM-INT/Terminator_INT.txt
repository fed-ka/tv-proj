Reese finds himself among the display racks of a discount
department store.
A searchlight stabs in the front
window as he dashes into the maze of aisles.
Three cops enter behind him through the shattered door.
FAST PANAGLIDE WITH REESE, as he crab-runs low among the
moving shadows where flashlights quarter the darkness.
He
bolts the open space behind a display window.
Sees the
outside searchlight sweep toward him.
Freezes.
ANGLE - REESE, his feral face frozen among the smooth-
featured, smiling mannequins.
As the light passes, Reese
silently moves on.
ANGLE - COP, passing the end of a long aisle B.G. while in
the F.G. a hand ENTERS FRAME, removing a knit shirt from a
hanger.
Reese slips the shirt on quietly and does a fast
crab-walk across the aisles to melt into the other racks
and shadows, CAMERA MOVING LOW with him.

With a shocking GROWL the police dog hurtles out of the
shadows, LEAPING RIGHT AT CAMERA.
ANGLE - REESE AND DOG, a dark blur with teeth, extremely
Doberman, flies toward Reese.
He spins.
Catches it by
the throat in mid-air. Arcs it to the floor with unflinching
precision.
C.U. - DOBERMAN, suddenly on its back and held by the throat,
THE DOG YELPS and stares at Reese, who leans very close.
Inches from its eyes he fixes it with a gaze of uncompromis-
ing dominance.
Some ancient communication seems to pass
between the two.
Reese releases the animal and turns his back on it, selecting
a long overcoat from a rack.
The dog backs away from him,
stiff-legged and confused.

TRACKING WITH REESE as he rounds a corner on the run, still
shrugging into his long coat.
Running smack at him is another cop, gun aimed.
Without slowing, Reese leaps toward him, twisting in mid-air
like a cat.
The cop FIRES. Misses.
Goes down under Reese's
tackle and they slide together on the polished floor.
Before they even come to rest Reese snatches the cop's gun,
aiming it at the other's face two-handed.
REESE
What day is it?
The date...
COP
Thursday...uh...May twelfth.
REESE
(viciously)
What year?
A SHOT whines off the metal side of an escalator behind
Reese's head.
He vaults the escalator rail, leaving the
amazed cop lying on the floor.
Reese bounds up the frozen steps, pocketing the .38 Police
Special in his coat.
Cops dash through the maze of aisles, converging at the
escalators.

WHIP PANNING WITH REESE, as he hurtles between displays.

SARAH
Mission control to Chuck,

BREEN
(without looking

You're late.
Sarah is undaunted.
SARAH
Aren't I worth waiting for?
BREEN
Not really.
Do you think you
can get here on time if I put
you on the floor as a waitress?
SARAH
(grinning)
I don't know.
I kinda had
my heart set on being a
cashier the rest of my life.
BREEN
The pay's the same but you'll
make more in tips.
SARAH
Thanks, Chuck.
I need the
money.
Can I still work the
hours around my classes?
Breen turns to punch up a display on the restaurant's
small accounting computer.
Sarah looks over his shoulder
as he modifies the week's schedule.
BREEN
Mmm.
Same schedule's okay.
SARAH
Alright!
BREEN
(gravely)
Can you handle it?
SARAH
It's not brain surgery,
Chuck.
Breen hands her an apron ceremoniously.

Sarah transformed into a "Bob's Girl".
Her hair is in a bun.
White blouse.
Short flared skirt and apron with a bow.
She resembles a suburbanized peasant maid looking for a
goat to milk.
Sarah confronts her reflection in the mirror, pondering
its absurdity.
She pinches her sheeks.
Smiles vacuously.

.225 ACP.
TERMINATOR (V.O.)
...the Remington 1100 Autoloader...
WIDE as the CLERK, who looks like a sick lizard, pallid
and paunchy, takes the rifle from a wall rack.
He lays it
beside the arsenal of perfectly legal anti-human artillery
already on the glass counter.
Terminator scans expressionlessly for additional selec-
tions.
CLERK
Anything else?
TERMINATOR
A phased plasma pulse-laser in
the forty watt range...
CLERK
(annoyed)
Just what you see, pal.
He indicates the display case and wall racks with a
minimal gesture.
TERMINATOR
The Uzi 9 millimeter.
CLERK
(setting
it out)
You know your weapons, buddy.
Terminator examines each in turn, working the actions with
curt, precise movements.
CLERK
(continuing)
Any one of them's ideal for
home defense. Which'll it be?
TERMINATOR
All.
The clerk digs deep and finds a scrap of a smile.
CLERK
Maybe I'll close early.
Cash or charge?
Instead of replying, Terminator takes a box of shotgun shells
from a stack on the display case.
CLERK
Sorry, I can't sell the ammo
with the guns.
You'll have
to---Hey!
Terminator has calmly begun feeding the shells into the
shotgun.
CLERK
(continuing)
You can't to that...
TERMINATOR
(evenly)
Wrong.
He raises the barrel and pulls the trigger.
The gun THUNDERS.

Sarah is bustling about, trying to service the start of
the dinner rush.
In waitress parlance, she's 'in it'.
She runs the gauntlet between tables, precariously balancing
two full dinner plates on one arm and hand-carrying a
third.
A customer tugs on her apron for attention and she
barely averts contributing the chili size to his wardrobe.
CUSTOMER
Honey, can I get that coffee
now?
SARAH
Yes sir, just a second.
She reaches her table after near collisions with a Mexican
busboy and two teenage girls doing cheerleading routines
in lock-step.
SARAH
Who gets the Burly Burger?
CUSTOMER TWO
I ordered Barbecue Beef.
CUSTOMER THREE
Does mine come with fires?
CUSTOMER FOUR
He's got the Barbecue Beef,
I've got a Chili-Beef Deluxe.
SARAH
Okay, who gets the Burly Beef?
CUSTOMER AT NEXT TABLE
Miss, we're ready to order.
In the process of setting down all the plates Sarah knocks
over someone's water glass.
SARAH
(mopping fran-
tically)
Oh, sorry.
That's not real
leather, is it?
As she cleans up the spill, a kid at the next booth reaches
over and dumps a scoop of ice cream into the top pouch of
Sarah's apron
She stares down at the mess melting over her hard-earned
and sags with defeat.
NANCY, a plump, gum-chewing waitress,
stops beside her to whisper.

ELECTRODE PADS exercise her doughy

She calls out distractedly:
WRONG SARAH CONNOR
What is it, Mom?
She jumps as the door BANGS open.
And stares in dumb
amazement as the good-looking, intense-eyed man in the
strange clothes raises a pistol.
And aims it at her face.
It all seems less real than "GENERAL HOSPITAL" in that
half-second before he FIRES.

shoulder.
He starts down the stairs.
The mother stands paralyzed, unable to breathe.
He reaches the main floor and walks toward her.
She edges into a corner, eyes wide.
He reaches out.
And wipes his hands clean on her apron.
Terminator walks out, without expression, leaving the
woman to sag to the floor in a faint.

He is crouched in
an underground service tunnel below a busy street.
Shadows
of people walking across a grating in the sidewalk above

SARAH
You must have a girlfriend.
MR. MILLER
That's none of your business.

WAITRESS
Hey, Sarah.
This is weird.
They huddle around the set, intent on a newscast in progress.
TV ANCHORWOMAN
...and a police spokesman at
the scene refused to speculate
on a motive for the execution-
style slaying of the Encino
housewife.
He did however say
that an accurate description of
the suspect has been compiled
from several witnesses.
Once
again, Sarah Connor, thirty-five,
mother of two, brutally shot to
death in her home this afternoon.

leads the class energetically.
Ginger, Sarah's roommate,
is a party-stopper.
Red-haired, athletic, sensuous.
She's
pretty enough when still, but stunning in motion.
And she's

Ginger yells commands and cheerfully dives into contortions
to the BEAT of a MOTOWN FAVORITE.
MARCO, a handsome, well-defined guy wearing a tight STAFF
T-shirt, strolls up for a drink at the water fountain next
to Sarah.
MARCO
Hi. I've seen you around.
You're cute.
Cute I remember.
SARAH
I'm Sarah.
Ginger's roommate.
MARCO
Yeah, right.

Now, didn't

The group collapses ensemble.
A chorus of groans.
GINGER
Let's think positive or next

Ginger walks over to Sarah as the class disperses.
Marco
is leaning on the wall next to Sarah, who is enjoying the
attention.
SARAH
...yeah, really?
Say some-
thing in Italian.
Before Marco can reply, Ginger pulls the front of his gym
shorts out and peers down.
She shakes her head.

The CRASH and SQUEAL of metal against

In F.G., two Conan-esque arms thrust upward, glistening.
Ginger's boyfriend, MATT McCALLISTER, the assistant manager
of the club, strains out his last reps, bench-pressing
enormous weight on the Nautilus machine.
Despite his imposing appearance, Matt is one of the warmest
people you'd ever want to meet.
His face is contorted, muscles knotted for the last push.
He heaves it up with a guttural cry.
Lowering his weights with a CLANG, Matt lies panting, arms
dangling at his side, eyes closed.
A pair of female legs appear.
GINGER (V.O.)
What's this? Sleep therapy?
Matt opens his eyes.
GINGER

Hello, sweetheart.

GINGER

Come here, wimp.
She leans down as he sits up and they meet in a kiss that's
bad for the other guys' discipline.
Sarah waits until they break the clinch to speak.
SARAH
Hi, Matt.
Matt look backwards over the bench, and replies, upside-down.
MATT
(grinning broadly)
Heeey!
It's my favorite
Sarah.
Hi, babe.
Ginger pulls the pin on Mat's weights and re-inserts it
beneath the entire stack, the maximum weight.

Alright, warm-ups are over.

Reese flips the page of COSMOPOLITAN.
He look at the glossy photos, the glossy women.

Svelte and seamless.
The ads fascinate him too: Caribbean vacations and blended

In the center of the living room floor is the body of a
young woman, crumpled face down in a small lake of blood.
Two bags of groceries lie split open on the floor in front

gum and pops it in his mouth.

Got a cigarette?

CLOSE ON PHONE, connected to the answering machine.
The
outgoing message trigger after the second ring.
GINGER'S VOICE
(machine V.O.)
Hi there.
(long pause)
Ha ha ha, fooled you. You're
talking to a machine, but don't
by shy, it's okay.
Machines need
love too, so talk to it and Ginger,
that's me, or Sarah will get back
to you.
Wait for the beep.
As the message plays, CAMERA DOLLIES OFF the phone machine
and down the corridor of the dark apartment.
As the bedroom
door draws near, Ginger's recorded voice fades and is super-
ceded by CRIES and MOANS.

FULL SHOT, framed against the streetlit curtains, Ginger and
Matt from a beautiful tableau of lovemaking in silhouette.
Their perfect bodies glisten with backlight as they strain
in passion.
CLOSER - TIGHT TWO, revealing that Ginger is wearing her
earphones.
Matt, without breaking rhythm, reaches out to
the night table and thumbs the volume higher.
Ginger cries out louder, apparently enjoying his sure touch
on her volume control.
CUT TO:

Traxler hangs up the phone.
TRAXLER
Same shit.
VUKOVICH
I can hear it now, it's gonna
be the goddamned 'Phone Book
Killer'.
TRAXLER
I hate the press cases.
Especially the weird press
cases.
Where you going?
VUKOVICH
(heading for
the door)
To make a statement. I'm gonna
give them the name.
Maybe the
jackals can help us out for
once.
He looks at his watch, then straightens his tie.
VUKOVICH
(continuing)
If they can get this on the
tube by eleven, she may just
call us.
(pause)
How do I look?
TRAXLER
Like shit, boss.
Vukovich goes out and the Minicam light hits him as the
door closes.
CUT TO:
67

TIGHT ON A TV SCREEN, a news cast in progress.
ANCHORMAN (V.O.)
...police had no further comment
on the apparent similarity between
the shooting death of an Encino
woman earlier today...
CUT WIDE to show Sarah watching the TV which is suspended
over the bar.
The place is a crowded, post-movie hangout,
raucous with laughter and videogames.
The newscast
continues, ignored by all except Sarah.
ANCHORMAN (V.O.)
(continuing)
...and this almost identical
killing two hours ago of a
Venice resident with virtually
the same name.
Sarah Ann Connor,
a 24 year old legal secretary, was
pronounced dead at the scene in
her beachfront apartment...
A customer gestures for the bartender's attention.
CUSTOMER
Hey, can we change this and
catch the ball scores.
BARTENDER
(reaching for the
knob)
Sure.
Sarah leaps half over the bar, startling everyone.
SARAH
(shouting)
Leave it where it is!
ANCHORMAN (V.O.)
...no other connections between
the two victims has been estab-
lished.
(pause)
On a lighter note, these was
cause for celebration at the
L.A. Zoo today, as...
Sarah leaves her half-finished pizza and beer, getting up
in a daze.
Followed by puzzles glances, she makes her way
through the crowd.
CUT TO:
68
68
In the crowded hallway by the restrooms, Sarah goes to the
single payphone and seizes the directory.
She flips rapidly
through it, then stops, looking down.
She sees that her name is next on the list.
The book slips out of her fingers.
Sarah turns and scans the crowd.
She's getting looks, covert and otherwise, like any unaccom-
panied girl on a Friday night.
But is that all they mean?
Sarah back into the women's restroom.
CUT TO:
69
69
Sarah stumbles numbly to the sink.
She splashes her face with cold water.
In the mirror
her terrified reflection looks back.
Why me?
She hears a loud clatter and spins around.
It's just a drunken woman fumbling with a toilet stall door.
Sarah edges back out into the corridor.
CUT TO:
70
70
Sarah walks stiffly to the pay phone.
It's OUT OF ORDER.
CUT TO:
71
72
ANGLE THROUGH WINDOW, SARAH F.G., as Reese approaches.
Her knuckles clench white as he reaches the entrance and
walks by, unhurriedly, without a glance inside.
She turns and scan the gloomy interior, which reveals itself
to be less than savory.
Pool tables and upper-middle lowlife
in submarine depths of smoky haze.
Sarah draws stares, menacing in their own right, as she
weaves between the pool tables to the back of the bar.
her hands are trembling as she drops a dime in the pay
phone and dials.
VOICE (V.O./RECORDED)
You have reached the Los Angeles
Police Department Emergency Number.
All lines are busy.
If you need
a police car sent out to you, please
stay on the line...
Sarah holds the receiver pressed to her ear, glancing
around, fear feeding on frustration.
CUT TO:
73
74
PANAGLIDE WITH GINGER as she ties her terry-cloth robe and,
leaving Matt in a dead sleep, pads through the dark apartment.
Down the hall, past the phone with Traxler's message.
Through the dark living room.
She has her Walkman in the pocket of her robe and bops to
herself in the silent gloom as she enters the kitchen.
When she opens the refrigerator to remove snack fixings, the
light briefly illuminates the kitchen and in that moment,
SOMETHING MOVES in the F.G.
TIGHT ON GINGER, MOVING WITH HER as she backs toward the
counter with her arms full of snack stuff.
A SUDDEN CRASH.
A flurry of motion behind her.
She spins, dropping half her load.
Ginger fumbles for the lightswitch.
Revealing Pugsley, sitting there blinking innocently among
overturned spice bottles on the counter-top.
GINGER
Shoo.
Go on.
I'll make a
belt out of you.
Pugsley disappears into a large fern by the window and Ginger
sets about her task, slathering crunchy peanut butter on
stalks of celery.
CUT TO:
75
75
MEDIUM ON MATT, as rustling curtains play patterns of street-
light over his sleeping face.
The sound of a faint breeze.
In the B.G. is the balcony, empty.
The sliding door is open.
TIGHT ON MATT, as his eyes open at the sound of a quiet,
repeated CLICKING.
UP ANGLE - PAST MATT, as the five-inch blade of an industrial
razor-knife reaches full extension in Terminator's hand,
right above him.
It slashes viciously downward.
Matt rolls and the pillow is SLIT OPEN where his throat had
been.
MATT
Whoah!
Terminator catches him by the hair and slashed down again.
Matt grabs the wrist in both hands.
The enormous muscles of his arms, which seem capable of bench
pressing a Chrysler, strain and knot against the pressure of
the killer's single arm...
And still the blade moves closer to his throat.
With a final heave Matt deflects the down-pressure sideways
and the blade snaps with a CLINK against the headboard.
HANDHELD WITH MATT as he rolls off the bed, spins and slams
his fists together into Terminator's temple.
He picks up a
brass deco lamp and brings it down with piledriver force.
Unperturbed, Terminator knocks the lamp away and hurls Matt
over the bed.
CUT TO:
76
77
Oblivious to the noise, Ginger croons in rock-and-roll
ecstasy, singing to a celery stalk as if it were a micro-
phone.
CUT TO:
78
78
Matt heaves himself up, powerful body gleaming with sweat
and hurls himself upon the intruder.
The titans CRASH INTO A DRESSER, reducing it to kindling.
Then into the closet door, EXPLODING THE FULL-LENGTH MIRROR.
Terminator places one hand on either side of Matt's barrel
chest.
SINKS HIS FINGERS INTO THE FLESH.
An inhuman grip.
Matt is raised off the floor, contorted with agony, above
the other's head.
CUT TO:
79
79
DOLLY PRECEDING GINGER as she returns from the kitchen with
a plate full of celery stalks and a glass of milk.
CAMERA
passes the closed bedroom door and STOPS, as Ginger pauses
to set the plate on top of the glass, freeing one hand to
open the door.
AN EXPLOSION OF SPLINTERS in close F.G. as a shape smashes
through the door right in front of her...Matt's body
propelled halfway through the door by enormous force.
Ginger shrieks and leaps back, flinging milk and all into
the air.
The door begins to open the pressure of Matt's body
creates resistance.
Ginger SCREAMS and back away.
The door is wrenched open and Terminator steps through with
the massive .45 drawn.
HANDHELD WITH GINGER, the walls blur by as she runs.
TIGHT ON TERMINATOR as the pistol RISES INTO FRAME, aligning
with his eyes.
BOOM!
LOW FAST DOLLY WITH GINGER as the bullet punches into her
shoulder, pitching her on her face outside the bathroom door.
LOW WIDE ANGLE as she crawls forward, gasping, drowning.
The implacable figure looms behind her.
Her expression is agony and reeling, nauseating terror.
And incomprehension: Why am I suddenly dying?
Her eyes roll, showing the whites, like a horse tethered in
a burning stable.
CUT TO:
80
80
Ginger scrabbles pathetically for a grip on the tile floor
as she pulls herself into the bathroom.
She clutches the rim of the toilet.
LOW ANGLE PAST HER, ON TERMINATOR, as he stands behind her.
PAN UP, off her.
He takes aim.
And empties the clip.
He calmly reloads.
CUT TO:
81
81
CLOSE ON PHONE MACHINE, as the telephone rings loudly in the
ensuing silence.
Terminator spins, drawing an instantaneous bead on the source
of the sound, but doesn't fire.
GINGER'S VOICE
(recorded)
Hi there.
(pause)
Ha ha ha, fooled you.
You're
talking to a machine...
C.U. - TERMINATOR, motionless, listening.
GINGER'S VOICE
(recorded, continuing)
...but don't be shy, it's okay.
Machines need love too...
Terminator turns abruptly back to Ginger's body.
He turns
it over, assuring himself that she is dead.
GINGER'S VOICE
(continuing, recorded)
...so talk to it and Ginger, that's
me, or Sarah will get back to you.
Wait for the beep.
There is a loud tone and the incoming call is heard.
SARAH'S VOICE
(on machine)
Ginger, this is Sarah...
Terminator's head snaps back and he freezes, listening.
He rises slowly as Sarah's voice continues.
TIGHT ON HIS UNBLINKING EYES.
SARAH'S VOICE
(on machine, contin-
uing)
...I'm in this sleazy bar called
Stoker's on Pico but I'm too
scared to leave.
I'm really
scared, kiddo...
CUT TO:
82
82
Sarah cups the telephone's mouthpiece with her hand and
glances around frequently.
SARAH
(continuing, into
phone)
...I think somebody's after me
and I sure hope you play this
soon 'cause I need you and Matt
to come pick me up.
The police
keep transferring me around, but
I'm going to try them again.
CUT TO:
83
83
SARAH
(continuing, B.G.)
The number here is 468-9175.
Call me, kiddo.
I need you.
It's Stoker's on Pico. Bye.
Terminator is rapidly and methodically rifling the contents
of Sarah's small desk.
SIREN'S WAIL, approaching.
He picks up a small card.
E.C.U. - CARD. It is Sarah's college I.D. card, complete with
color photo of her.
MACRO ON PICTURE.
E.C.U. - TERMINATOR'S EYES as he tosses the card down,
after a fraction of a second's scan.
Picks up something else.
TIGHT ON SARAH'S ADDRESS BOOK, Terminator pockets this and
slips out the balcony door.
Climbing over the railing, he
is gone.
CUT TO:
84
84
Sarah is huddled, back to the wall, beside the phone.
SARAH
(on phone, upset)
...look, Lieutenant...uh,
Vukovich, don't put me on
hold and don't transfer me
to another department...
CUT TO:
85
85
VUKOVICH
(on phone)
I won't.
Now just relax.
Where are you?
(pause)
Yeah, I know it...on Pico.
Are you alright?
CUT TO:
86
86
SARAH
(on phone)
Yes, but I don't want to
leave.
I think this guy's
following me.
CUT TO:
87
87
VUKOVICH
(on phone)
Alright, Ms. Connor.
Listen
carefully.
You're in a public
place, you'll be safe 'til we
get there.
Stay visible.
Don't go outside or in the
restroom.
I'll be there in
a few minutes.
He hangs up and grabs his coat, motioning to Traxler.
VUKOVICH
Let's roll.
CUT TO:
88
88
Sarah takes a seat at a booth near the bar, and picks up
a dog-eared menu, but can't concentrate on it.
She looks
at her watch and glances around.
CUT TO:
89
90
Vukovich draws his Colt Python .357 Magnum and check the
load.
Traxler is driving.
VUKOVICH
Let's see how this guy likes
playing hard-ball.
CUT TO:
91
91
The waitress set a cup of coffee in front of Sarah.
WAITRESS
Anything else?
Sarah shakes her head "No" and contemplates her trembling
hands.
She half-turns, catching a glimpse of herself in
the mirror behind the bar.
TIGHT ON SARAH, reflected in the mirror.
In the F.G. a
man at the bar looks up from his beer, straight into her eyes.
It is Reese.
He gazes at her coolly for a moment, then glances away.
C.U. - SARAH, feeling trapped, frantic.
ANGLE ON FRONT DOOR as it opens and a figure stands silhou-
etted briefly against a streetlight.
Reese turns, his eyes flickering to the mirror, the figure.
C.U. - REESE as he mechanically raises his beer.
His knuckles
are white.
He slowly undoes the top button of his overcoat.
There is a glint of metal in the shadows within.
Reese turns slowly on his barstool as the figure brushes past
him, out-of-focus F.G.
Sarah looks up.
E.C.U. - REESE'S HAND sliding slowly along polished steel,
a caress.
His finger slips through the triggerguard of the
riot gun.
MEDIUM ON SARAH, as the man stops in front of her in close F.G.
He sits slowly in the booth opposite her.
The angle is OVER
HIS SHOULDER.
SARAH
(uncertainly)
Lieutenant Vukovich?
REVERSE ANGLE - It is not Lt. Vukovich.
Terminator sits motionless for a BEAT.
Blue eyes so pure and deep.
The eyes of a saint, perhaps.
The .45 is out and cocked and AIMED DIRECTLY AT CAMERA, almost
in one motion.
The bore seems enormous.
BACK ON SARAH, over the gun barrel, her eyes go wide.
We hold
a BEAT, like a frozen slice of nightmare.
MEDIUM ON REESE as he whips the riot-gun to a hip-firing posi-
tion, his overcoat falling back with a snap.
HE FIRES.
ON TERMINATOR, as the shotgun blast hits his arm and he FIRES,
simultaneously.
Sarah screams as the .45 round blows stuffing
out of the booth seat inches from her face.
Her hair is
singed by burning gunpowder.
An involuntary cry is punched
out of her by the double concussions.
Reese is stroking up another shell as Terminator half-rises
from booth.
OVER REESE'S SHOULDER, as he fires, cocks the slide, fires
again, advancing on Sarah's booth.
Terminator is blown backward over the center divider,
crashing through the glasses and pitchers of beer on the
table opposite, and onto the floor.
Sarah is screaming, scrunched down in the booth.
Terminator is lying on his back at the feet of a table-
full of drunk patrons.
He has two rifled 12 gauge slugs in his chest and one
in the arm.
The bar customers are frozen in the weird tableau, cowering,
gaping.
Sarah stops screaming.
Reese stand motionless, gun aimed.
In the sudden silence, the sound of him cocking the shotgun
is abnormally loud.
ON TERMINATOR, very still.
Then he smoothly rolls to a crouch and slips the UZI machine
pistol from beneath his overcoat, where it has been hang-
ing on a shoulder strap.
He doesn't seem too impaired as he swings around to fire.
Reese rolls like a cat and comes up firing.
A burst from the UZI rakes the bar where he stood.
An orgy of shattering glass.
Total pandemonium.
SEVERAL ANGLES
as patrons of the bar run, scream or dive
for cover, depending upon their level of intelligence.
Reese slides through the glass to Sarah's booth and seizes
her wrists.
ON TERMINATOR, kneeling amid the chaos, raising the UZI
one-handed.
Reese tugs viciously on Sarah's arm and she sprawls across
the booth seat a moment before the divider and seat cushion
erupt with hits from the UZI.
ANGLE ON A RUNNING PATRON as a burst of 9mm fire catches
him in the chest.
He pitches into Sarah's booth, pinning
her.
Reese fires, ducks, fires again.
Tables crash over.
A window is blown out.
A table candle rolls into a pool of high-proof alcohol
behind the bar.
It ignites with a WHOOSH.
Reese feed two shells into the riot-gun.
TIGHT ON TERMINATOR, an island of slow, precise movement
amid the confusion.
He drops a spent clip.
Reaches for
another with his bloody hand.
MOVING WITH REESE as he vaults the row of booths and starts
firing.
At point blank range he unloads the shotgun into
Terminator's belly.
CUT TO:
92
92
Terminator crashes backwards through two tables and a plate
glass window into the street.
CUT TO:
93
93
The roaring fire behind the bar is spreading very quickly.
The air is thick with smoke.
Reese tosses the UZI, for which he has no ammo, into the
fire.
He hauls the dead man off Sarah and reaches for her.
TIGHT ON SARAH, shrinking away from Reese, hysterical.
When he grabs her wrist she struggles, eyes wide.
C.U. - REESE, very intense.
REESE
Come with me if you want
to live.
She looks where he is pointing.
CUT TO:
94
95
C.U. - SARAH, feeling a lightning blot of terror greater
than she could ever imagine as the cold gaze fixes on her.
SARAH
(awed whisper)
Oh my God...
CUT TO:
96
96
PANAGLIDE PRECEDING TERMINATOR as he clambers back through
the window and starts through the burning bar.
CUT TO:
97
97
PANAGLIDE MOVING IN ON REESE AND SARAH as he runs, drag-
ging her with him, toward the back.
REVERSE ON TERMINATOR, DOLLYING as he crashed through the
wreckage in the swirling smoke, hurling burning tables out
of his way.
CUT TO:
98
98
PANAGLIDE FOLLOWING REESE AND SARAH, running headlong
through the cluttered kitchen, then down a narrow back
hallway.
Sarah stumbles and Reese brutally pulls her to
her feet without slowing.
He hits a closed door, which crashes open.
Hauls Sarah through, into another corridor.
Slams and blot-latches it.
An instant later an impact from the far side tears the
latch-screws half out of the wall.
They run on.
CUT TO:
99
99
Terminator takes a step back from the closed door and
slams into it again.
It starts to give way.
behind him the flames engulf a CAN OF CLEANING SOLVENT.
CUT TO:
100
100
Reese and Sarah pelt down the narrow corridor, fling open
the outside door and spin out into the alley.
TIGHT ON DOOR at far end.
It splinters open and Terminator
sprints down the corridor.
CUT TO:
101
101
The cleaning solvent EXPLODES.
CUT TO:
102
102
DOLLYING AHEAD OF TERMINATOR, very fast, as he runs full-
throttle.
Behind him a fireball of superheated gas hurtles
down the narrow hallway.
He clears the outer door an
instant before the tongue of flame roars out into the alley.
CUT TO:
103
108
Reese jams reverse and nail the throttle.
The car backs down the alley.
Terminator draws back his fist.
Punches into the windshield.
Inside, Sarah is sprayed with glass as the killer's fist
shoots through.
The lacerated fingers grope for her.
WIDE as the car shoots backwards out of the alley onto the
street, narrowly missing an arriving LAPD CRUISER.
Sarah plasters herself tightly into the seat as the
fingers grasp her blouse and pull.
Reese cranks the wheel hard.
CUT TO:
109
112
Sarah is in a daze.
Paralyzed.
Face bloodless.
She is shivering silently, uncontrollably.
Her eyes are wide, and it seems likely that she doesn't
quite comprehend the roaring blur outside her window.
REESE
(calmly)
Hold on.
CUT TO:
113
114
Reese drives with total, nerveless absorption.
His eyes
flick to the mirror, to the road, over his shoulder, back
...and the world spins outside.
With occasional glances to Sarah, he speaks to her in a
clipped, military voice.
REESE
Are you injured?
Are you
shot?
No response.
He reaches over and runs his hands over her arms, legs,
chest.
Sarah flinches.
She feels the BLIND PANIC BOILING UP WITHIN HER.
She pushes his hand away and opens the door.
Reese slams her back in the seat and slaps her.
Hard.
REESE
(continuing)
Do exactly what I say.
Exactly.
Don't move un-
less I say.
Don't make a
sound unless I say.
Do
you understand?
As he speaks he is locking the door and fastening Sarah's
seatbelt over her, cinching it very tightly, like you would
for a child.
She doesn't answer.
REESE
(continuing/
shouting)
Do you understand?
SARAH
(a whisper)
Yes.
Don't hurt me.
REESE
I'm here to help you.
Reese,
Sergeant/Tech-Com, DN38416...
Sarah stares numbly at his outstretched hand.
With zero
strength she automatically returns his handshake.
REESE
(continuing)
Assigned to protect you.
You've been targetted for
termination.
CUT TO:
115
116
Sarah is slumped way down in the seat, turned away from the
window, trying not to see the landscape reeling outside.
SARAH
(hoarse whisper)
This is a mistake.
I haven't
done anything.
REESE
No. But you will.
It's
very important that you
live.
Sarah closes her eyes, as if to shut it all out.
SARAH
I can't believe this is happen-
ing.
How could than man get up
after you...
Reese's tone is equal parts hatred and respect as he replies.
REESE
Not a man.
A Terminator.
Cyber Dynamics Model 101.
CUT TO:
117
117
Terminator drives expressionlessly, monitoring the babble
from Central Dispatch.
He hears his number.
DISPATCHER (V.O.)
(filtered)
...Suspect vehicle sighted on
Motor at Pico, southbound.
Units Two-Zero-Six and Five-
Seven, attempt intercept.
Unit One-Four-Three, come in.
Terminator picks up the mike.
He speaks in a
simulation of the young cop's southern twang.
TERMINATOR
This is One-Four-Three.
West-
bound on Olympic, approaching
Overland.
CUT TO:
118
120
SARAH
A machine?
You mean, like
a robot?
REESE
Not a robot.
Cyborg.
Cybernetic Organism.
They have to yell over the roar of air through the broken
windshield.
SARAH
But...he was bleeding.
At that moment a blinding light sears down on them from
above.
Reese looks over his left shoulder and sees a
CHP cruiser coming alongside.
REESE
Just a second.
Keep your
head down.
CUT TO:
121
122
The sedan roars across the street without slowing
and vanishes down a tree-lined side street.
CUT TO:
123
124
The sedan skids around a corner, F.G., as the searchlight
filters in shafts through the trees further down the street,
sweeping futility back and forth.
CUT TO:
125
126
Reese is ultra-alert, craning to look up, back, forward.
REESE
Good cover.
(pause)
Alright.
Listen.
The Terminator's an infil-
tration unit.
Part man, part
machine.
Underneath, it's a
hyperalloy combat chassis,
mircoprocessor-controlled,
fully
armored. Very tough...
He pauses as they slide around another corner.
CUT TO:
127
128
REESE
(continuing)
But outside, it's living
human tissue.
Flesh, skin,
hair...blood.
Grown for the
cyborgs.
SARAH
Look, Reese, I know you want
to help, but...
REESE
(cutting her off)
Pay attention.
The 600
series had rubber skin.
We spotted them easy.
But
these are new.
They look
human.
Sweat, bad breath,
everything.
Very hard to
spot.
I had to wait 'til
he moved on you before I
could zero him.
SARAH
Hey, I'm not stupid, y'know.
They can't build anything like
that yet.
REESE
No.
Not yet.
Not for about
forty years.
Reese is driving sedately for a low profile, but his eyes
rove constantly, searching for a place to ditch the car.
Sarah's eyes are alert as well, and her tone becomes a bit
too cool.
SARAH
So, it's from the future, is
that right?
REESE
One possible future.
Four your
point of view.
I don't know the
tech stuff.
SARAH
And you're from the future too?
REESE
Right.
They come to a red light and Reese stops.
SARAH
(patronizingly)
Right...
Like a shot she unlatches the seatbelt, pulls the door lock
and has the door half open before Reese can react.
He catches
her arm and hauls her struggling back into the car.
Sarah sinks her teeth into his hand with all her strength.
His grip doesn't slacken.
Slowly, without releasing her, he reaches across with his
other hand and shuts the door.
His face shows no reaction.
Sarah draws back and stares at the blood running down his
arm from the bite, that at his grim, scarred face.
The
light turns green and Reese drives on.
Sarah tastes blood and wipes her mouth.
REESE
(coldly)
Cyborgs don't feel pain.
I
do.
Don't...do that...again.
He wipes his hand on his pants.
SARAH
(weakly, plead-
ing)
Just let me go.
REESE
(slow, but intense)
Listen.
Understand.
That
Terminator is out there.
It
can't be reasoned with, it can't
be bargained with...it doesn't
feel pity of remorse or fear...
and it absolutely will not stop.
Ever.
Until you are dead.
Sarah slump in utter resignation.
SARAH
(quietly)
Can you stop it?
Reese doesn't look at her.
REESE
Maybe.
With these weapons...
I don't know.
CUT TO:
129
130
ANGLE THROUGH WINDSHIELD, ON TERMINATOR, as he searches.
Streetlights flare across rhythmically.
CUT TO:
131
133
TIGHT ON TERMINATOR, through the windshield of the black-
and-white.
DISPATCHER (V.O.)

Suspect vehicle located at
parking lot, Cedar and Glen-
haven...
FULL SHOT as Terminator's cruiser slews in a radical turn
and roars off in the opposite direction.
CUT TO:
134
134
Reese uses the butt of the shotgun to smash loose the
ignition assembly.
He begins working on the wires.
A
police cruiser appears, moving slowly between the rows of
cars.
Reese grabs Sarah and pulls her down to huddle below dash
level.
A moment later a spotlight flashes across the seats
above them.
They hear the helicopter circling closer.
SARAH
Reese...why me?
Why does
it want me?
They are lying very close, a forced intimacy.
Reese's voice
is an urgent whisper, almost in her ear.
A cruiser passes
so close they can hear its radio clearly.
REESE
There's so much...
SARAH
Tell me.
Just start at the
beginning.
Reese musters his thoughts.
And starts.
REESE
There was a war.
A few years
from now.
Nuclear war.
The
whole thing.
All this--
His gesture includes the car, the city, the world.
REESE
(continuing)
--everythingis gone.
Just
gone.
There were survivors.
Here.
There.
Nobody knew who
started it.
(pause)
It was the machines.
SARAH
I don't understand...
REESE
Defense network computer. New.
Powerful.
Hooked into everything.
Trusted to run it all.
They say it
got smart...a new order of intelli-
gence.
Then it saw all people as
a threat, not just the ones on the
other side.
Decided out fate in a
microsecond...extermination.
Reese pauses, and when he continues it's less like a military
briefing, quieter.
REESE
(continuing)
Didn't see the war.
I was born
after, in the ruins.
Grew up
there.
Starving.
Hiding from
the H-K's.
SARAH
The what?
REESE
Hunter Killers.
Patrol machines.
Build in automated factories.
Most of us were rounded up, put in
camps...for orderly disposal.
He pushes up the sleeve of his jacket and shows
her a ten digit number etches on the skin of his forearm.
Beneath the numbers is a pattern of lines like the auto-
matic-pricing marks on product packages.
REESE
(continuing)
Burned in by laser scan.
(pause)
Some of us were kept alive...
to work.
Loading bodies.
The
disposal units ran night and day.
We were that close to going out
forever...
The helicopter moves overhead.
Its searchlight illum-
inates the car interior, moves on.
Before the rotor
sound fads, Reese starts the car.
CUT TO:
135
136
Reese is holding onto Sarah's shoulder tightly.
REESE
(continuing)
...but there was one man...who
taught us to fight.
To storm
the wire of the camps.
To
smash those metal mother-
fuckers into junk.
He turned
it around...he brought us back
from the brink.
(pause)
His name is Connor.
John Connor...
your son, Sarah.
Your unborn son.
Sarah stared at him.
CUT TO:

Reese's head jerks up, looking in the mirror.

The rear window explodes and Reese ducks, then cranks
the wheel.

144
Reese is feeding his last two shells into the riot gun.
REESE
(yelling)
Steer!
Holding the gun is both hands he leans out the window,
still keeping the throttle mashed down.
Sarah grabs the wheel, fighting to control the car.

Sarah, huddles in a blanket, is siting on a bench opposite
Vukovich's desk.
Motionless.
Her eyes are fixed on the
middle distance.
She's been crying.
Now she's emptied out.
The door opens.
At the sound of the latch Sarah jerks as if struck, and cringes
involuntarily.
Vukovich enters with Traxler and DR. PETER
SILBERMAN, a criminal psychologist.
Silberman is smooth
of skin and manner, young, ambitious and...fat.
He is
enthusiastic about the workings of the human psyche, as
emotionally involved as someone pulling the wings off a fly.
Vukovich sits beside Sarah and hands her a cup of coffee.
He puts a paternal arm around her shoulders.
VUKOVICH
Here, drink some of this...
SARAH
(voice flat,
desperate)
Lieutenant, are you sure it's
them?
Maybe I should see the
...bodies.
VUKOVICH
They've already been identi-
fied.
There's no doubt.
Sarah
begins to cry again, slowly and very quickly.
SARAH
(to herself)
Of, God...Ginger...kiddo,
I'm so sorry.
Vukovich takes the coffee cup from her as her arms sag and
it starts to spill.
VUKOVICH
(gently)
Sarah.
(pause)
Sarah, this is Dr. Silber-
man.
I'd like you to tell
him everything Reese said
to you.
Do you feel up to it?
SARAH
(almost in-
audible)
I guess so.
(to Silberman)
You're a doctor?
SILBERMAN
A criminal psychologist.
SARAH
Is Reese crazy?
SILBERMAN
That's what we're going to
find out.

The room costs five dollars a night and that's steep, but
the FIRE ESCAPE outside the window adds an element of
strategic value.
A silhouette slips in through the window and click on the
single BARE LIGHT BULB.
It's Terminator, and he's a mess.
A bloody scarecrow with bullet wounds in stomach, chest,
shoulder and right wrist.
MEDIUM ON TERMINATOR as he sits at a ratty folding table
under the light.
His eyebrows are singed off.
Hair a charred stubble.
Left eyes glistening with imbedded glass shards.
Before him on the table is an array of SMALL TOOLS.
He removes the charred remains of his jacket and props.
one elbow on the table.
ANGLE PAST HIS NON-FUNCTIONAL RIGHT ARM, F.G., as he exam-
ines it.
He picks up an X-ACTO KNIFE and cuts deeply into
the skin of his forearm.
His expression is one of mild concentration.
E.C.U. - FOREARM, as he pulls back a large flap of skin to
reveal a complex trunk of SHEATHED CABLES AND HYDRAULICS.
They slide as he moves his fingers.
RESUME MEDIUM, as Terminator uses a rag to wipe away the
blood.
With small screwdrivers he begins to patiently dis-
assemble the damaged mechanism around the 12-guage hit.
CUT TO:

The room is small, furnished with only a table and two chairs.
Reese, his arms handcuffed behind him, sits opposite Dr.
Silberman.
Behind Silberman is a large mirror.
A DETECTIVE
leans against the wall.
SILBERMAN
So.
You're a soldier.
Fighting for whom?
REESE
With the One Thirty Second
under Perry, from '21 to '27--
SILBERMAN
(interrupting)
The year 2027?
CUT TO:
154
154
Vukovich and Traxler are seated in the dark room, watching
Reese, B.G., through the two-way mirror.
Just behind the
glass is a VIDEO CAMERA ON A TRIPOD, aimed at Reese, and
a CART holding a SMALL MONITOR and VIDEOCASSETTE RECORDER.
REESE
(through speaker)
That's right.
TRAXLER
(quietly, to
Vukovich)
This is fucking great.
CUT TO:
155
155
REESE
Then I was assigned Recon/
Security, last two years,
under John Connor.
SILBERMAN
And who was the enemy?
REESE
SKYNET.
A computer defense system
built for SAC-NORAD by Cyber
Dynamics.
A modified Series
4800.
SILBERMAN
(gravely)
I see.
And this...computer,
thinks it can win by killing
the mother of its enemy, kill-
ing him, in effect, before he
is even conceived?
A sort of
retroactive abortion?
REESE
Yes.
CUT TO:
156
156
Traxler snorts and grins.
TRAXLER
(to Vukovich)
That Silberman just crack me up.
(pause)
He had this guy in here last week
who set his Afghan on fire.
Screwed it first, then set it on--
VUKOVICH
(leaning forward)
Shut up.
CUT TO:
157
REESE
...it had no choice.
The defensive grid was
smashed. We'd taken the
mainframes...
We'd won.
Taking out
Connor then would make no
difference.
Skynet had to
wipe out his entire exist-
ence.
We captured the lab
complex.
Found the...what-
ever it was called...the
time-displacement equipment.
The Terminator had already
gone through.
They sent two
of us to intercept, then
zeroed the whole place.
Sumner didn't make it.
SILBERMAN
Then how are you supposed to
get back?
REESE
Can't.
Nobody goes home.
Nobody else comes through.
It's just him and me.
CUT TO:
158
E.C.U. - TERMINATOR, in profile, showing his lacerated eye.
He is close to a mirror, practically touching it, staring
intently.
MACRO - X-ACTO KNIFE lying on the dresser.
Terminator's
fingers lift it.
CAMERA TILTS TO FOLLOW as it rises to
his face, holds TIGHT ON left eye.
With a smooth motion the knife point enters the eyeball
and cuts away the ruins sclera and cornea, as well as part
of the damaged eyelids.
He wipes with a rag to clear the electronic eye's vision.
Revealing the faintly glowing lens mechanism, suspended in
a chrome socket by tiny servos.
The eye whirs quietly as it tracks.
SEQUENCE OF SHOTS, showing various repairs.
Terminator's right hand, its wrist SUTURED crudely, holds
a needle and sewing thread and starts to work on abdominal
wound out of frame below.
He slips a glove over the damaged hand.
A motoring cap over the blistered scalp.
A fresh shirt to hide his body wounds.
This is followed by a new overcoat.
C.U. - TERMINATOR, contemplating his reflection in the
mirror.
With the hat pulled down, the collar pulled up,
and favoring his right profile he looks unhurt...though
a bit gaunt and pale.
A turn of his head brings the balefully glowing left eye
in its metal socket into view.
He slips on a pair of tight, wrap-around sunglasses.
FULL SHOT as he goes to the bed and flips up the stained
mattress.
He picks up the Remington 12 gauge, the AR-180
and the .38 off the springs and leaves by the fire escape.

TIGHT ON VIDEO MONITOR showing Reese in the Interrogation
Room.
REESE
(recorded)
...It's just him and me.
CUT WIDE revealing Sarah, Silberman, Vukovich and Traxler
watching a monitor sitting amid incredible paperwork clutter
on a desk top.
SILBERMAN
(recorded)
Why didn't you bring any
weapons?
Something more
advanced.
Don't you have
ray guns?
Traxler, standing in the back, grins and nudges Silberman,
who nods appreciatively.
TIGHT ON REESE'S RECORDED IMAGE - He glares at Silberman.
ON SARAH, as Silberman's voice is heard.
SILBERMAN
(recorded)
Show me a piece of future
technology.
REESE
(recorded/con-
trolling his
hostility)
You go naked.
Something about
the field generated by a living
organism.
Nothing dead will go.
SILBERMAN
(recorded)
Why?
REESE
(recorded)
I didn't build the fucking
thing.
SILBERMAN
(recorded)
Okay.
Okay.
But this...
(consults his
notes)
cyborg...if it's metal...
REESE
(recorded)
Surrounded by living tissue.
SILBERMAN
(recorded)
Of course.
The real Silberman put the tape on "PAUSE".
SILBERMAN
(excited)
This is great stuff.
I could
make a career out of this guy.
You see how clever this part
is...how it doesn't require a
shred of proof.
Most paranoid
delusions are intricate...but
this is brilliant.
He starts the tape again.
SILBERMAN
(recorded)
Why were the other two women
killed?
REESE
(recorded)
Most official records were
lost in the war.
The computer
knew almost nothing about
Connor's mother.
Her name.
Where she lived, just the city.
No scanner pictures.
The
Terminator was just being
systematic.
C.U. - REESE, ON SCREEN, as he goes on.
REESE
(recorded, con-
tinuing)
You've heard enough.
Decide.
Are you going to release me?
SILBERMAN
(recorded)
I'm afraid that's not up
to me.
REESE
(recorded/voice
rising)
Then why am I talking to you?
Get out.
ON SARAH, DOLLYING SLOWLY IN TO C.U. as we hear Reese
begin to shout.
SILBERMAN
(recorded)
I can help you...
REESE
Who is in authority here?
C.U. REESE, ON SCREEN, as he looks straight at the camera.
REESE
(recorded)
You still don't get it.
He'll find her.
That's
what he does.
All he does...
MEDIUM ON VUKOVICH, gesturing to Silberman, who is near the
machine, to kill it.
REESE
(recorded, con-
tinuing)
You can't stop him. He'll
wade through you...
C.U. - REESE, ON SCREEN, rising partway out of his chair,
yelling.
REESE
(recorded, continuing)
...reach down her throat, and
pull her fucking heart out...
The screen goes black.
Vukovich has cut off the tape.
SILBERMAN
(glancing around)
Sorry.
C.U. - SARAH staring at the empty screen.
SARAH
(turning)
So Reese is crazy.
SILBERMAN
In technical terminology,
he's a loon.
SARAH
But...
Vukovich hands her something that looks like umpire's
padding.
VUKOVICH
Sarah, this is body armor.
Out TAC guys wear it.
It'll
stop a 12 gauge round.
This
other individual must've had
one under his coat.
Sarah want to believe him.
God help her if he's wrong.
SARAH
But what about him punching
through the windshield?
TRAXLER
(shrugs)
Probably on PCP, broke every
bone in his hand and won't feel
it for hours.
There was this
guy once that...
Vukovich cuts him off with a gesture and sits beside Sarah
on the bench.
VUKOVICH
Why don't you just stretch out
here and get some sleep.
It'll
take your mom a good hour to get
here from Redlands.
SARAH
I can't sleep.
VUKOVICH
Go ahead.
You're safe.
There're
thirty cops in this building.
SARAH
Okay.
She lays her head on a wadded up blanket as everyone
leaves the office.
CUT TO:

Vukovich pauses outside the door, lost in thought.
Traxler
studies him for a second.
TRAXLER

wacko.
Vukovich glances up.
VUKOVICH
(quietly)
He'd better be.

Silberman can be seen through a glass partition next to
the bullet-proof glass booth enclosing the NIGHT DESK
SERGEANT'S counter.
The Sergeant hits a button and there
is a loud BULL-CLACK.
The electric bolt on the security
door opens and Silberman steps out.
As he exits the station, he passes Terminator just coming in
the front door.
He glances at the pale apparition in cap
and dark wrap-arounds, but goes on.
Terminator approaches the Desk Sergeant who barely glances
up when he speaks.
TERMINATOR
I'm a friend of Sarah Connor.
I was told she is here.
Can
I see her, please?
SERGEANT
You can't see here.
She's
making a statement.
TERMINATOR
Where is she?
SERGEANT
(laconically)
Look.
It's gonna be a while.
You wanna wait.
There's a
bench.
Terminator steps back, scanning the booth, the electric
door, the rooms beyond.
TERMINATOR
I'll come back.
He turns and walks out through the front doors.
ANGLE PAST DESK SERGEANT, F.G. - ON FRONT DOORS, the officer
is absorbed in paperwork, not watching as a pair of lights
get BRIGHTER outside the doors.
RAPIDLY.
He glances up
at the last second as the glare falls fully on him.
CRASH!
Several cops and late night loiterers scatter as a car
smashes into the foyer.
It blasts through the sergeant's
booth, crushing him in the wreckage.

Through the hole in the splintered wall we see Terminator
leap out of the car.
He vaults the hood and smashes through the debris of the
wall.
Leaps to the corridor floor in a shower of plaster fragments.
He brandishes the AR-180 like a pistol in one hand, the
.38 in the other.
The shotgun dangles at his side on a shoulder sling.
LOW ANGLE DOLLY, preceding him as he starts down the
corridor.
ANGLE ON LOUNGE DOORWAY as TWO COPS run into the hall,
one carrying a cup of coffee.
Terminator fires a burst from the assault rifle.
ANGLE ON COPS - They are flung backward in a spray of
coffee and plaster.

Terminator steps over the bodies of the two cops without
breaking stride.

Tries it.
Locked.
Kicks it in.
A DESK COP, drawing his gun, sprints for cover.

In computer-enhanced vision we see the cop dash around a

There is a target cross-

cop and he is flung OUT OF FRAME.

Shots are echoing in the hallway as Vukovich whips open

Terminator rips the cover off the station's main electrical
panel.
He pulls loose the hose-like 440 volt
incoming line and feeds it directly into the lighting

Getting closer.
SLOW DOLLY IN ON SARAH begins, ending in TIGHT C.U. as the
sounds get louder.
More SHOTS.
Smoke begins to seep under the door.
DETAIL - DOORKNOB rattling as it is tried from outside.
E.C.U. - SARAH stifling a cry.
She flinches as if slapped

Reese bends toward him.
Vukovich holds out his custom Colt Python .357.

his shoulder.
B.G. a BLUE VOLKSWAGEN RABBIT is roaring
away across the parking lot.
TIGHT ON TERMINATOR aiming carefully.
He pulls the trigger.
It clicks...empty.

ANGLE LOOKING OUT from the mouth of an enclosed concrete
storm drain that passes under the road.
Reese, followed
by Sarah, trudges down the slope and ducks inside.
The floor is wet but he doesn't seem to mind.
They both hunker down with their backs to the concrete,
facing each other.
They look beaten, grimy, exhausted.
She huddles under the blanket, waif-like.
REESE
You cold?
SARAH
Freezing.
REESE
Come here.
She sits beside him and they wrap their arms around each
other with the blanket covering both of them.
SARAH
Reese...you got a first name?
REESE
Kyle.
SARAH
Kyle, what's it like when you
go through time?
REESE
White light.
Pain.
Like
being ripped inside out...
slowly.
Like being born,
maybe.
Sarah scowls and draws her hand out from under his jacket.
SARAH
You're wet.
Oh my god.
In the beam of the flashlight her hand is glistening
with blood.
REESE
I caught one, back there.
SARAH
(incredulous)
Caught one?
You mean you
got shot?
Reese shrugs.
REESE
It's not bad.
Sarah sits up and turns toward him.
SARAH
We gotta get you to a doctor.
REESE
It's okay.
Forget it.
SARAH
Forget it?
Are you crazy?
Let me see it.
Sarah opens his jacket and the flashlight beam shows his
shirt bloodsoaked at the shoulder.
SARAH
(continuing)
Jeez.
You idiot.
Take
this off.
She cradles the flashlight between her knees and opens
the first aid kit as he removes his jacket.
REESE
(looking at the
wound)
See.
Missed everything.
Passed through the meat.
Sarah starts swabbing the flesh wound.
SARAH
This is gonna make me puke.
Talk about something.
REESE
What?
SARAH
Just talk.
Tell me about
my son.
Is he tall?
She places a gauze pad in place and starts to wrap it.
REESE
About my height.
He
has your--
(winces)
...damn...he has your
eyes.
Sarah glances at his face for a second and then goes back
to work.
SARAH
What's he like?
REESE
(thoughtful)
You trust him.
He's got that
strength.
You'd die in a
second for John.
SARAH
Well, at least I know what
to name him.
I don't suppose
you'd know who the father is?
So I don't tell him to get
lost when I meet him.
REESE
John never said much about
him.
He dies.
Even before
the war...
SARAH
(interrupting)
Stop!
I don't want to know.
Hold still.
So...it was John
that ordered you here?
REESE
I volunteered.
SARAH
You volunteered?
REESE
It was an honor.
A chance
to meet the legend.
Sarah
Connor.
Who taught her son
to fight...organize, prepare.
From when he was a kid.
When
you were in hiding, before
the war.
She stops taping.
She seems lost, her bravado dissipated.
SARAH
You talk about things I haven't
done yet in the past tense.
It's
making me crazy.
I can't think.
(pause)
Are you sure you've got the
right person?
Reese appraises her coldly.
REESE
I'm sure.
SARAH
Come on, me? The mother
of the future?
Am I tough?
Organized?
I can't even balance
my checkbook.
I cry when I see
a cat that's been run over...
and I don't even like cats.
She pulls the bandage tight with a knot.
REESE
Ow!
No, it's okay.
It's
better tight.
SARAH
And anyway, what do I know
about guerrilla warfare?
REESE
You'll learn.
SARAH
(angry)
Look, Reese, I didn't ask for
this honor and I don't want it.
Any of it.
REESE
John gave me a message for
you.
Made me memorize it.
'Sarah"...this is the message...
'Sarah, thank you.
For your
courage through the dark years.
I can't help you with what you
must soon face, except to tell
you that the future is not set...
there is no such thing as Fate,
but what we make for ourselves
by our own will.
You must be
stronger than you imagine you
can be.
You must survive, or I
will never exist.'
That's all.
Sarah stares at him as the enormity of it all becomes real
to her.
Reese moves his arm, testing the bandage.
REESE
(continuing)
Good field-dressing.
SARAH
(brightening)
You like it?
It's my first.
He rebuttons his shirt and they return to the warmth-
conserving embrace.
Sarah gazes out the entrance, into
the night.
REESE
Sleep.
It'll be light soon.
SARAH
(closing her
eyes)
Okay.
Talk some more.
REESE
About what?
SARAH
(murmuring)
About where you're from.
Kyle watches the helicopter circling far in the distance.
REESE
Alright.
(pause)
You stay down by day, but at
night you can move around.
The H-K's use infra-red so you
still have to watch out.
But they're not too bright.
John taught us ways to dust them
them.
That's when the infiltra-
tors started to appear.
The
Terminators were the newest,
the worst...
During his monologue we have PANNED into the darkness outside
and to the helicopter, which flies OUT OF FRAME, leaving
black.
A ROTOR ROAR fades up.
CUT IN BLACK TO:

Reese is among a SQUAD OF MEN in black fatigues, carrying
equipment and energy rifles, who enter a debris-littered
tunnel.
PANAGLIDE WITH THEM as they trot through a labyrinth of
tunnels, pass several guard-posts.
Reese has a GERMAN
SHEPHERD on a short leash.
CUT TO:

The platoon enters a cavernous chamber, an old parking
structure, in which a large group is gathering.
As the entrance, ARMED SENTRIES with dogs are passing in
new arrivals: men wearing mismatched uniforms or rags and
carrying all types of weapons from lasers to shotguns.
Weapons are left at the sentry post.
FOLLOWING REESE as he patrols the perimeter.
He walks along a row of CARS, models from the eighties and
nineties, now stripped, rusty and modified to carry weapons.
There are conventional military vehicles as well.
He passes several family groups.
Gaunt kids are huddles around an old TV SET.
Its glow bathes them.
REVERSE ANGLE reveals that the set has been gutted and a
small cookfire crackles inside the shell.
Nearby a kid has a LARGE RAT cornered and is whacking it
with a stick.
Reese pauses at the end of the row of vehicles and unsnaps
a pocket in his tunic, removing a small paper rectangle,
a worn photograph.
C.U. - REESE, gazing down.
His head snaps around at the
sudden sound of BARKING.
ANGLE ON SENTRY POST as the dogs go crazy.
SENTRY
(shouting)
Terminator!
An innocuous, RAG-DRESSED MAN flips back his poncho to
reveal a powerful PLASMA-RIFLE.
He opens FIRE, running
forward.
ENERGY BOLTS rip into the crowd.
MOVING WITH REESE, running toward the Terminator.
RAPID CUTS:
POWERBOLTS EXPLODE among the fleeing people.
Beams sear the darkness.
A running CHILD is BURST by a plasma hit.
ANGLE ON REESE running.
He levels his energy-rifle and
starts firing.
A powerbolt grazes his cheek, EXPLODING
a support column behind him.
Part of the ROOF COLLAPSES
as Reese tumbles.
Everything is lit as if by lightning.
C.U. - REESE, semi-conscious.
Burned.
Bleeding.
Impressions implode on him: running feet, flashes, energy
beams raking the ground leaving molten worm-tracks, scream-
ing, a burning dog howling.
DETAIL - The picture Reese has been looking at has fallen,
forgotten.
It catches fire and starts to curl.
Before
the image vanishes we see that it is a picture of Sarah.
Reese looks up.
A figure looms above, a silhouette in the smoky, hellish
glare.
THE TERMINATOR.
Its
eyes glow red.
A brilliant EXPLOSION WHITES OUT THE SCREEN.
CUT TO:
187
187
C.U. - SARAH, brightly lit by daylight.
Asleep.
She grimaces
and groans.
In the distance a dog is barking.
Reese, still holding her, lightly lifts her hair from her
face.
An uncharacteristically tender gesture.
He gently
caresses her cheek with the backs of his fingers.
When
she awakens suddenly he snaps his hand away.
Sarah looks around, momentarily disoriented.
Looks up at
Reese.
SARAH
I was dreaming about dogs.
Reese extricates himself from her and steps out of the
culvert.
REESE
We used them to spot Terminators.
Sarah groans as she straightens her legs.
SARAH
Your world...it's pretty
terrifying.
CUT TO:

Terminator sits in his room with the blinds drawn tight.
Murky.
Claustrophobic.
With knife-slits of hot sunlight.
MEDIUM ON TERMINATOR
sitting on the edge of the bed.
His appearance isn't improving.
A patch of SCALP is blown away, revealing CHROME underneath.
A flap of skin dangles from his cheek, which exposes some
of the DRIVE CABLES which move the lips.
He is scanning Sarah's address book, turning a page every
two seconds.
C.U. - TERMINATOR
his eyes tracking rapidly.
His skin is waxy, WHITE, BRUISED,
GANGRENOUS in places.
He ignores the FEW FLIES crawling
on his face.

Reese pulls a crumpled wad of bills from his jeans and shows
it to Sarah.
REESE
Is this enough?
SARAH
Yes.
And I don't want to
know where you got it.
She turns to the desk clerk, a female version of the pawn-
shop lizard.
SARAH
(to clerk)
We need a room...with a
kitchen.
CUT TO:
202
Kyle and Sarah enter the spartan room.
SARAH
I'm dying for a shower.
You
could use one too.
And we'd
better check that bandage.
REESE
Later.
I'm going out for
materiel.
Keep this.
He hands her the .38 he took off the detective.
She takes it without thinking as he leaves then realizes
that she has A LOADED GUN IN HER HAND, without the slightest
idea of how to use it.
She lays it gently on the dresser.
As an afterthought, she turns it with one finger so that it
is pointing the other way.
Sarah moves the curtain slightly and looks outside.
CUT TO:
203
204
Sarah is on the phone, her hair still wet from a shower.
She sits on the bed with a towel wrapped around her.
SARAH
...No, Mom, I can't tell you
where I am.
I was told not
to say.
SARAH'S MOM (V.O.)
(filtered)
But honey, I need to know where
I can reach you or I'll be
worried sick.
It turns out I
can't stay up here...the
electricity's off...and I don't
know just where I'll be.
Sarah hesitates, then:
SARAH
Okay, here's the number.
Are
you ready?
SARAH'S MOM (V.O.)
(filtered)
Go ahead.
CUT TO:

SLOW PAN around the room as the conversation between Sarah

SARAH (V.O.)

It's 408-972-1439.
Room 14.
SARAH'S MOM (V.O.)
(filtered)
I got it.
The PAN continues, revealing an overturned chair.
SARAH (V.O.)
(filtered)
Okay, I've gotta go.
I'm
sorry I can't tell you very
much now, Mom.
I love you.
The PAN comes to a table.
Smashed plates.
Spilled coffee.
A spatter of blood.
A phone.
It follows the phone cord
onto Terminator in CLOSE-UP as he continues in a perfect
simulation of her mother's voice...
TERMINATOR (MOTHER'S VOICE)
I love you too, sweetheart.

TIGHT ON SEVERAL GROCERY BAGS
covering the counter beside the hot-plate in the tiny
apartment.
Reese's hands split one open and its contents spill out.
FULL SHOT
Sarah looks through Reese's haul.
SARAH
Let's see.
Corn syrup.
Ammonia.
Moth balls...
Mmm.
What's for dinner?
REESE
(preoccupied)
Plastique.
There are also boxes of shotgun shells, road flares, tape,
scissors, pans, a strainer and many other odd utensils,
substances, chemicals.
SARAH
What's that?
REESE
Nitroglycerin, basically.
Bit more stable.
I learned
howto make it when I was a
kid.
Sarah looks a bit stricken as she contemplates the evening
ahead.
CUT TO:
209
210
A heartwarming domestic scene.
Sarah and Kyle have pulled the dresser out to use as a
worktable.
Pans, packages and bottles clutter the kitchen,
B.G.
On the table between them are eight ten-inch lengths
of PLUMBER'S PIPE, threaded each end.
Kyle is showing
Sarah how to tamp the HIGH-EXPLOSIVE PUTTY into the pipe
bombs and seal them shut.
REESE
Make sure there's none on the
threads, like this.
Now screw
the end-cap on...very gently.
SARAH
You must have had a fun child-
hood.
REESE
That's good.
Now, seven more
like that while I make fuses.
SARAH
I was thinking, there's so
much I've got to show you
when we get through this.
It's mind boggling, the pos-
sibilities...Disneyland, the
beach, movies...matinees with
popcorn and foot-long hot dogs...
REESE
Hot dogs?
SARAH
I want to buy you a hot dog so
bad,Kyle...all the things you've
never seen and done.
You're here,
but wherever you go, and whatever
you touch, you bring the war with
you.
REESE
My whole life has been combat.
SARAH
I want it to be over for you.
REESE
Not possible.
SARAH
I want it to be over for me too.
I feel like I slipped over some
invisible line, that I'm in your
world now.
Everything's the same,
but I see it differently.
It's like, there's you and me,
and him...but nobody else can
understand or help or even touch
us.
Reese looks up and finally catches her gaze.
He reaches
out for her hand and it seems he may be taking it to
comfort her.
But he turns her wrist to read her watch.
REESE
We'll head out at 0200.
That gives you four hours
to sleep if you want.
I'll
finish.
CUT TO:

ANGLE ON TABLE - The bombs are neatly ranked, finished.
A nylon satchel lies nearby.
The mess is cleaned up.
WIDE SHOT reveals Reese sitting in silent vigil at the
window.
The room is dark, lit only by a streetlight
outside.
Sarah is asleep on the bed.
Reese sits cross-legged, shirtless, his body held rigid.
The image of discipline.
The .357 is held loosely in one
hand on his lap.
There is a fresh bandage on his shoulder.
Sarah wakes up and goes to him in the darkness.
He looks
at her for a moment as she sits beside him, then back outside.
SARAH
He'll find us, won't he?
REESE
Probably.
Sarah, if I get
zeroed...
SARAH
Don't say that.
REESE
If I do, you have to get away,
disappear without a trace.
Different country, different
name, everything.
In case they
send another one.
SARAH
It'll never be over, will it?
Look at me, I'm shaking.
Some legend, huh?
You must
be pretty disappointed.
REESE
No.
I'm not.
Several beats before Sarah speaks again.
Her eyes seem
luminous in the dark.
SARAH
(softly)
Kyle, the women in your
time...what were they like?
REESE
Good fighters.
SARAH
That's not what I meant.
Was there someone special?
REESE
Someone?
SARAH
A girl.
You know.
REESE
(mechanically)
No.
(pause)
Never.
He looks away, outside the window
SARAH
(softly)
I'm sorry.
Sarah studies him for a moment.
She's sitting slightly behind him and she puts her hands
on his shoulders and back, tracing the lines of his scars
with her fingertips.
SARAH
So much pain.
REESE
Pain can be controlled.
You disconnect it.
SARAH
And so you feel nothing.
REESE
It's better that way.
SARAH
(with great
sympathy)
Oh, Kyle.
Reese takes a long, slow breath before he answers, and when
he does his voice has a new quality, an unfamiliar tenderness.
REESE
John Connor gave me a picture
of you once.
I never knew
why.
It was very old. Torn.
Faded.
You were young, like
you are now.
You weren't
smiling...just a little sad...
I always wondered what you
were thinking at that second.
He closes his eyes, reaches toward her.
His fingertips
trace the contour of her nose, chin, cheeks.
REESE
(continuing)
I memorized every line, every
curve...
He opens his eyes, looking right at hers.
REESE
(continuing)
Sarah, I came across time
for you.
I love you.
I always have.
Sarah is quietly overwhelmed.
Reese looks away.
REESE
(continuing)
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't
have said...
SARAH
Kyle...
She leans forward and kisses him.
His face is frozen.
A mask.
She continues, tenderly.
He begins to respond.
The dam breaks and he holds her in a tight, trembling
embrace, clinging to her like life itself.
Kyle picks her up and carries her to the bed.
She kisses his neck and chest, tracing his scars with
her lips.
He unbuttons her blouse very slowly.
Sarah guides his powerful hands over her.
A SEQUENCE OF CUTS.
DETAILS.
IMPRESSIONS.
Sarah, a very close angle, as she grimaces in divine agony.
Reese, his face rapt.
His hand, clutching the pillow as if to kill it.
It is explosive, torrential.
A confluence of fate and will.
CUT TO:
212

TIGHT ON SARAH AND REESE in each other's arms.
Lying
across his chest, she surveys his face as his eyes close
drowsily.
SARAH
I bet you're ticklish.
REESE
(uncompre-
hending)
Ticklish?
Sarah's hand moves OUT OF FRAME.
After a moment Reese
looks down, puzzled.
REESE
What are you doing?
SARAH
(continuing
doggedly)
You'll beg for mercy in
a second.
Reese seems unperturbed.
Finally he begins to squirm.
REESE
I don't think I like this.
SARAH
You're not supposed to.
Now Reese is becoming desperate.
A grimace spreads across
his face.
It becomes a grin.
Then he's laughing, trying
to escape but she won't let him, and they collapse, laughing
together.
Sarah gazes at his grin, a glimpse of the Reese that might
have been, in another life.
A moment later the grin vanishes at the sound of dogs barking
outside.
Reese is off the bed in an instant, crouched tense, eyes
alert.
Feral as ever.
REESE
(whispering)
Listen to the dogs.

PAN OFF the lunging dog to the row

HANDHELD as we approach the doors.
It is WIDE ANGLE and the barrel of the AR-180 is visible at
the bottom of FRAME.
The nearest vehicle parked in front is a LARGE PICKUP TRUCK
WITH TWO DIRT BIKES lashed in the bed, seen prominently as
we pass.
The POV approaches a door.
Number 14.
The door is KICKED OPEN.
Moving inside.
The assault rifle sprays the room, exploding the indistinct
forms on the bed.
Staccato glare.
Approaching the bed.
Nothing there put the shredded remain of sheets and pillows.
The POV shifts to the BACK DOOR, which is ajar, and moves
toward it.
Through the door.
Revealing an EMPTY YARD.

Reese is under the dash, playing with the wires.
Sarah lies on the seat, clutching the nylon satchel, which
bulges with the explosive charges.
She has dressed hastily
and is barefoot.
REESE
Light it now.
Sarah has been holding a BIC LIGHTER near the tip of a fuse.
She thumbs the flame on.
The fuse catches as Reese twists
the wires and the engine starts to turn over.

Terminator spins at the sound of the truck engine catching.
FAST PANAGLIDE WITH HIM as he runs the
length of the suite, stops outside the front door.
Whips the AR to his shoulder.
The truck is BACKING WILDLY across the lot B.G.
Terminator turns, looking into CAMERA as a SIZZLING SOUND
becomes audible.
DETAIL - PIPE CHARGE, lying just inside the door, in the
shadows.
The fuse is burning.
WIDE SHOT - On doorway, from the parking lot, as Terminator
takes two leaping strides forward and the CHARGE EXPLODES.
The front of the building is BLOWN TO KINDLING.
Terminator is flung forward by the blast.

Reese slides the truck into an ON-RAMP and guns in onto the

The truck tops out at 110 and he holds it.
They flicker rapidly through pools of light and shadow.
ANGLE OVER REESE'S SHOULDER as they hurtle forward.

Sarah and Kyle run down a corridor.
Through a door, which they close and lock.

Kyle slides the bolts on the metal firedoor.
Behind them

Silence.
CRASH!
The Terminator hits the door from the far side.
Hinges SQUEAL.
Kyle goes to a LARGE BREAKER PANEL and opens it.
Starts
throwing switches.
Behind them, machines START UP ONE BY ONE.
SARAH
(panting)
What are you doing?
REESE
(weakly)
Cover...our footsteps...
He sags, sliding down the wall.
She pulls him up.
Half-carries him into the maze of machines.
The dark gallery is filled with WHIRRING, CLANKING SHAPES,
SHATTERING CONVEYER BELTS and improbable mechanisms lashing
mindlessly.
Reese slips to the floor and Sarah is no longer able to
support him.
REESE
(faintly)
Leave me here.
Sarah crouches beside him.
Grabs his shirt front.
Yells over the machines.
SARAH
I'm not leaving you anywhere
you jerk.
Haven't you figured
it out?
Kyle, John is our
son.
Reese's eyes refocus.
SARAH
(continuing)
There isn't going to be
anybody else...I don't want
anybody else.
Listen to
me!
She pauses, then resumes in a commanding, military shout.
SARAH
(continuing)
Move!
Reese! Let's go.
Move you ass!
She drags him to his feet and he staggers on.
Hinges SHATTER and the firedoor is hurled inward.
The Terminator scans the darkness.
ANGLE - PANNING WITH SARAH AND KYLE as they move through
the machines.
The cyborg steps forward, scanning methodically.
Sarah and Kyle move in a crouch through the treacherous
tangle of pipes and machinery.
Kyle picks up a length of
pipe to use as a weapon.
As they climb out onto a cat-
walk between the two huge mechanisms, Sarah clambers over
an innocuous CONTROL PANEL.
Her knee inadvertently hits a RED PUSH BUTTON.
With a ROAR the stamping-plate of a HYDRAULIC PRESS slams
down an inch from her hand.
Startled, she tumbles to the catwalk.
The Terminator's eyes swivel as he hears the single non-
rhythmic sound.
Kyle and Sarah run to the end of the catwalk, but find the
door there locked.
SARAH
Come on!
They double back to escape the cul-de-sac.
The Terminator
steps in front of them, cutting them off.
REESE
(shouting)
Run!
He pushes Sarah roughly and she stumbles away.
Kyle raises the pipe with his good arm as the Terminator
advances.
REESE
(over his
shoulder)
Run, damn it!
She hesitates, backing away.
The cyborg swings at Reese
STEEL CLANGS ON STEEL.
Kyle strikes and parries but is sledgehammered back.
ANGLE ON CATWALK as Kyle lands in a heap, smashed against
a stanchion of the railing which prevented him falling to
the factory floor twenty feet below.
Sarah turns and runs.
LOW ANGLE PAST REESE, F.G., as the cyborg approaches him.
E.C.U. - A FUSE BURNING.
C.U. - KYLE'S FACE streaked with blood, pressed to the
floor as a metal foot CLANGS DOWN, F.G.
His eyes snap open.
Sarah falls, gets up, runs on.
The Terminator draws back for a death blow.
And Kyle rolls with the last of his strength, raising
the pipe bomb he has been cradling.
He jams it between two
hydraulic cylinders just beneath the cyborg's armored
rib-
cage.
Then rolls off the catwalk.
Terminator has an instant
to react, reaching for the bomb, before it EXPLODES.
Sarah is pitched forward by the blast and slides on the
floor.
Slams up against one wall.
A withering spray of shrapnel strafes the walls around her.
Pieces of scrap metal clatter throughout the factory, rain-
ing down.
C.U. - SARAH, very still.
She winces and opens her eyes.
Slowly looks up.
POV - SARAH, as the smoke clears.
The Terminator is GONE.
Unrecognizable clumps of BURNING DEBRIS lie scattered about.
Looking down through the grating floor she sees Kyle's
body.
LOW ANGLE ON KYLE F.G., Sarah on catwalk above.
Kyle's eyes
are half-open.
Still.
His face peaceful.
ANGLE ON ONE OF THE FIRES climbing some plastic tubing and
triggering a SPRINKLER HEAD.
It begins to rain.
C.U. - SARAH sitting up as the water runs over her.
She looks down.
Protruding from her right thigh is a TWISTED
PIECE OF METAL.
Shrapnel.
Part of the cyborg.
She pulls
it out, grimacing.
Her leg is broken.
It is a long time before she can gather the will to move.
SARAH'S POV - She sees a WALL PHONE several yards away,
beyond the debris from the explosion.
She starts to crawl toward it.
She passes A LARGE CLUMP OF DEBRIS, F.G.
ANGLE ON DEBRIS (FX) as it rolls over suddenly!
Now recognizable as the TERMINATOR'S HEAD AND ARMS, with
half of the scattered torso trailing wires and twisted
metal.
IT LUNGES FOR HER!
Sarah wants to scream this time, from the depths of her
soul, but there is no scream, only a dry shivering sob.
The Terminator drags itself SCRAPING over the floor, steel
fingers clutching.
Sarah is shaking and whimpering as she scrabbles away,
crawling in agony.
ANGLE ON CONVEYOR BELT as Sarah flops from the catwalk
onto the MOVING STRIP.
She is carried into the intricate
lattice of equipment.
Sarah rolls off weakly before going
under a set of sorting rollers.
ANGLE THROUGH MACHINERY - ON THE TERMINATOR (FX) as it crawls
after her, dragging its body.
It tracks her unerringly,
EYES GLOWING.
Sarah moves deeper into the DARK, CLASHING JUNGLE of machinery.
Around her is a rain-drenched tangle of CABLES, PIPES and
unforgiving mechanisms of steel.
The Terminator clambers through after her.
C.U. - SARAH - Water pours into her eyes as she catches
sight of something.
A familiar CONTROL BOX.
She drags herself toward it.
C.U. - THE TERMINATOR (FX) - It spots her wedged in a tiny
crawl space.
No way out.
It crawls the last few feet,EYES RED IN THE DARK.
Hypnotized, Sarah watches the Terminator REACHING TOWARD HER.
She is jammed in a corner.
Sarah's hand claws around to the front of the control panel,
seeking the RED BUTTON.
E.C.U. - HER WET FINGERTIPS FEEL THE BUTTON.
ANGLE ON THE TERMINATOR (FX), his steel hand reaching out.
E.C.U. - SARAH, her face inexplicably calm, eyes steady in
that infinite instant.
She clenches her teeth to keep
from screaming as she WAITS.
The Terminator's hand reaches for her throat to crush
the life out of her and end its long mission.
SARAH
(voice icy)
You're...terminated...fucker!
E.C.U. - BUTTON, as her bloody finger stabs it down.
FULL SHOT, showing how the cyborg has been led into the
MAW OF THE HYDRAULIC PRESS.
THE STAMPING PLATE THUNDERS DOWN!
Tons of mechanical pressure flatten the Terminator's head
and body like tin-foil.
The PRESS SCREAMS, jamming solid.
Lightning snaps out in one brief blaze, leaping to surround-
ing machinery, arcing to Sarah's wristwatch.
All the
Terminator's energy is released in one second.
ANGLE on the narrow gap between the upper and lower plates:
a pinpoint of red light DWINDLES AND GOES OUT.
TIGHT ON SARAH, shivering uncontrollably.
The steel fingers
are frozen an inch from her throat.
She can only stare as
water runs over her.

CLOSE ON the side rail of an ambulance gurney SNAPPING UP
into position.
Sarah's eyes are closed and she is moved
OUT OF FRAME.
WIDE SHOT, showing the gurney being rolled by TWO ATTENDANTS
past the site of the last explosion.
SEVERAL POLICE OFFICERS are picking through the debris.
PANNING WITH THE GURNEY as it is wheeled out, holding on
TWO FACTORY EMPLOYEES, F.G.
One, the PLANT MANAGER, bends to examine a piece of the
cyborg lying at the base of the hydraulic press.
A COP, B.G., notices this.
COP
Look, I told you not to
touch anything until we're
done.
You got that?
MANAGER
Sure thing, officer.
He stands and palms a small object to HIS ASSISTANT.
They
step around the corner.
ASSISTANT
What is it?
MANAGER
Microcomputer chassis.
But
I've never seen stuff like
this anywhere.
ASSISTANT
Weird.
Jap stuff, maybe?
MANAGER
Keep it out of sight and
get it down to R and D
Monday, first thing.
ASSISTANT
Good idea.
CUT TO:

MACRO ON CASSETTE RECORDER, the center capstans of a
tape turning.
SARAH (V.O.)
...and the hardest thing is
deciding what I should tell
you and what not to.
Well,
anyway, I've got a while yet
before you're old enough to
understand the tapes.
They're
more for me at this point...
to help get it all straight.
COVER SHOT reveals Sarah as the wheel of a dusty landrover
parked at the pump island of a tiny gas station.
All of
its signs are in hand-lettered Spanish.
Beyond lies an
expanse of scrub desert.
The sky scowls with an impending
storm.
Sarah speaks quietly into a hand microphone as a dark-
complected attendant laconically fills her tank.
She
cradles the cassette recorder in her lap, in the lee of
her SWOLLEN BELLY.
She looks to be about SIX MONTHS ALONG.
Under her down vest she wears a leather shoulder holster
and the butt of a .357 REVOLVER presses against her
breast.
She tugs the vest closed as the attendant glances
her way.
A German Shepherd sits in the back among taped
boxes and suitcases.
SARAH
(continuing)
Should I tell you about your
father?
That's a tough one.
Will it change your decision
to send him here...knowing?
But if you don't send Kyle,
you could never be.
God,
you can go crazy thinking
about all this...I suppose
I'll tell you...I owe him that.
And maybe it'll be enough if
you know that in the few hours
we had together we loved a
lifetime's worth...
CLICK.
WHIR.
Sarah jumps at a sound nearby, breaking
her reverie.
A small MEXICAN BOY has snapped her picture
with a beat-up Polaroid camera.
He holds it out to her,
speaking rapid Spanish.
ATTENDANT
He says you are very beautiful,
Senora, and he is ashamed to ask
five American dollars for this
picture, but if he does not,
his father will beat him.
SARAH
That's a pretty good hustle,
kid.
Four.
Quatro.
The boy takes her four dollars and she watches the
snapshot develop.
It is a good photograph of her,
the wind lightly ruffling her hair, expression thought-
ful, slightly sad.
We recognize it as the one Reese carried in 2029.
She slips it into her short pocket.
ATTENDANT
Mil trescientos...fifteen dollars
American.
As she pays him, distant thunder rolls.
The boy yells something in Spanish as he runs off.
SARAH
What did he say?
ATTENDANT
(accented)
There is a storm coming in.
Sarah gazes at the thunderheads building up out over the
desert.
Heat lightning pulses in their depths.
SARAH
(quietly)
I know.
CAMERA CRANES UP as she pulls away, driving across the
flat desert on a ribbon of highway.
A brilliant flash
crescendos from horizon to horizon out at the rim of the
world.
