      DETECTIVE SERGEANT FENTON RUSSELL snaps back a white sheet 
      to reveal a man s face.  We don t see who it is.  We do see 
      that there is a second BODY on an adjacent trolley.  

      Russell looks up at GEORGE, a big man, powerful and 
      grizzled like an old lion.  George can t help himself.  He 
      lets out a pitiful groan.

                                  MALE VOICE #1 (O.C.)
                    You re secured.  How may we help?

                                  MALE VOICE #2 (O.C.)
                    It seems to be a virus.



      Sirens and flashing blue lights behind them.  Mark, in the 
      front seat, in obvious distress.  Hillman in the back, 
      getting panicky.

                                    HILLMAN
                    Move!  Come on, move!

      The police car behind is gaining on them.



      An attractive woman in her late thirties is buying 
      cigarettes.  She pays and leaves. Her name is JENNIFER 
      MOSCATI.  She has a baguette in her hand.

      A CAPTION:

      PARIS, 1989                                                                                  3.



      TWO MEN are about to sit down to a meal.  GEOFFREY BRADDICK 
      (54), who owns the house.  Braddick is wealthy and 
      successful, and everything he does is done on his terms.

      He directs BEN LANDER (32) impatiently and gruffly.  Lander 
      has the look of a soldier on leave - muscular, lean, 
      cleancut.

      The door bell rings.

      Braddick freezes.  He looks to Lander.  



      She is sitting opposite

      HARRY

      Behind his desk.  He s early 40s, handsome in a dangerous 
      way.  Good with people.  But here he s on the back foot.

                                    FRANCES
                    What are you doing?  You re 
                    throwing this away?

                                  HARRY
                    I don t know what to say.  I m 
                    sorry.                                                                                  4.


                                    FRANCES
                    Sorry?  I don t believe this.  I 
                    don t believe you.  When did you 
                    decide this?

                                  HARRY
                    Frances--

                                    FRANCES
                    When?!  When!

                                  HARRY
                    I don t know.  It wasn t like an 
                    instant thing.

      Fuel to the fire.

                                    FRANCES
                    So this has been going on in your 
                    head all this time?  When we were 
                    out having dinner?  When we were in 
                    bed?  

                                  HARRY
                    I ve got back to back appointments--

      Frances is on her feet in a second.

                                    FRANCES
                      Appointments?  You re talking about 
                      appointments?!  This is my life, 
                    Harry!

      Harry was really hoping it wouldn t come to this.



      It s a down-at-heel north London solicitors  office.  Cheap 
      furniture, cheap reproductions on the walls. 

      Harry s PA is MATT (20s), North London lad, little formal 
      education but sharp.  

      A young woman enters.  She is GINA, self-possessed, 
      attractive.  She is expensively dressed, classic business 
      suit, perfectly groomed.

                                  GINA 
                          (slight accent)
                    I m Gina Hawkes.  I have an 
                    eleven o clock appointment with 
                    Mr Venn.

      Matt checks Harry s diary.  There s a scream from Harry s 
      office.                                                                                     5.


                                    FRANCES (O.C.)
                          (not entirely audible)
                    You can t do this to me!  

                                  MATT 
                    Mr Venn s 10.30 is running a 
                    little over.  

      Gina throws him a look.

                                    FRANCES (O.C.)
                    I m not going to let you ruin my 
                    life!

                                  MATT
                    Why don t I see if I can find you 
                    another appointment?

                                  GINA
                    I ll wait.

      She finds herself a seat and unfolds a newspaper.  The 
      front page story is headlined:

      WORSLEY VOWS TO KEEP COALITION TALKS ALIVE

        Accompanying the story is a photo of BRIAN WORSLEY, the 
      prime minister (Harrow, Cambridge, married to a viscount s 
      daughter).  Worsley is blandly handsome, but he looks 
      careworn and older than his 43 years.  

      We see in the report that it s DAY 11 of the crisis - eleven 
      days since the coalition government collapsed, eleven days 
      with a caretaker administration with Worsley at its head.

      Matt picks up the phone and punches some buttons.



      The telephone rings in Harry s office.  Harry makes to pick 
      it up.

                                    FRANCES
                    Don t answer that!

      Harry ignores her and is about to lift the receiver.  Frances 
      slams her hand down on top of Harry s.

                                  HARRY
                          (firm)
                    Let go.

      We see the steeliness in Harry.  Frances sees it too.  The 
      phone stops ringing.  She takes her hand away.  

      Beat...

      She looks at him seductively.                                                                                  6.


                                    FRANCES
                    Are you really going to give this 
                    up?  

      She unbuttons the top button of her shirt.  She s not wearing 
      a bra.

                                  HARRY
                    Frances, you don t have to do that.

                                    FRANCES
                    Are you?

      She undoes the next button.

                                  HARRY
                    You ll catch cold.



      Matt replaces the phone.  

                                  MATT
                    Do you think he ll pull it off?
                          (indicating the paper)
                    Worsley?  The coalition?

                                  GINA
                    I really don t know.

                                  MATT
                    Not that I vote.  Whoever you 
                    vote for, the government always 
                    gets in.  Except now you vote and 
                    you don t even get a government.  
                    So what s the point?  

      Gina smiles thinly and goes back to the newspaper.

                                  MATT (CONT D)
                    Are you sure you don t want to make 
                    another appointment?

                                  GINA
                    It s essential I see Mr Venn as 
                    soon as possible.

                                  HARRY (O.C.)
                    No!

                                    FRANCES (O.C.)
                    You hate women.  That s it, isn t 
                    it?  Why don t you just admit it! 
                    You re a woman hater!                                                                                    7.


                                  GINA
                    I don t suppose he ll be long 
                    now.


      OMITTED1414



      The connecting door bursts open and Frances storms in, 
        melodramatic and tragic.  She s in such a state that she s 
      oblivious to the fact her breasts are visible.

      She looks at Gina: not Harry s usual kind of client.  Harry 
      emerges behind her looking stressed and weary.  

                                    FRANCES
                          (to Gina)
                    I don t know what he s promised 
                    you, but trust me - he won t 
                    deliver.

      She turns to Harry, throws him last contemptuous look and 
      exits, pulling her clothes together.

                                  MATT
                    This is Ms Hawkes, your 11 
                    o clock.  

                                  GINA 
                          (dryly)
                    I won t offer to shake your hand.

                                  HARRY 
                    Would you like to come into my 
                    office?  

      Gina regards the open door.

                                  GINA 
                    Why don t we go out?



      Harry brings a coffee to the formica table.  Cheap.

                                  HARRY
                    I should warn you.  The coffee s 
                    terrible.                                                                                  8.


                                  GINA 
                          (takes a sip)
                    I ve drunk worse.

                                  HARRY
                    You re a brave woman.  What can I 
                    do for you?

                                  GINA 
                    I have a client.  He s on a 
                    murder charge.

                                  HARRY 
                    You re a lawyer?

      She hands over a card.


      ECU - GINA HAWKES S CARD

      Gina Hawkes
      Hodgkins Truss Wilson
      0858 777777
      Email: Hawkesasst@HTW.com

                                  HARRY (CONT'D)
                      Interesting case?

                                  GINA 
                    It has a couple of unusual 
                    features, the first being that my 
                    client appears to be innocent.  

                                  HARRY
                    You mean, really innocent?

                                  GINA 
                    As in he didn t do it.

                                  HARRY
                    That is unusual.

                                  GINA 
                    As I said.

                                  HARRY
                          (taps her card)
                    I ve been in practice for fifteen 
                    years, Gina ...  do you mind if I 
                    call you Gina?

                                  GINA 
                    You just did.

                                  HARRY
                    And I know every solicitor in 
                    London.  So how come I ve never 
                    heard of Hodgkins Truss Wilson 
                    and I ve never heard of you?                                                                                  9.


                                  GINA
                    We re a specialist firm.

                                  HARRY
                    What do you specialize in, 
                    exactly?

                                  GINA
                    Right now in getting my client 
                    off a murder he didn t commit.

                                  HARRY
                    If he didn t do it and he s got 
                    your expensive brain behind him 
                    I m sure in no time at all your 
                    client will be basking on the 
                    beach of whatever Caribbean 
                    island he has his offshore 
                    account with.

                                  GINA
                    His name s Steven Quirke.

      Beat ...  Harry taking this in.

                                  HARRY 
                    Stevie Quirke?  Little Stevie?  
                    What s this all about?

                                  GINA 
                    I told you--

                                  HARRY 
                    I don t get it.  An expensive 
                    lawyer acting for an over-the-
                    hill career criminal like Stevie 
                    Quirke?  How did that happen?

                                  GINA 
                    In the usual way - Mr Quirke 
                    called my office.  He told me he 
                    was innocent and I believe him.

                                  HARRY
                    Well, it s true that Mr Quirke 
                    has been acquitted a number of 
                    times.  But innocent?  That would 
                    be a first.

                                  GINA 
                    It s early days but I m thinking of 
                    sending the brief to Nigel 
                    Fountain.
                          (off Harry s look)
                    You don t approve of my choice of 
                    counsel?                                                                                10.


                                  HARRY
                    Shouldn t that be Sir Nigel 
                    Fountain?  I approve very much.  
                    I m just wondering where all the 
                    money s coming from.  Nigel 
                    Fountain doesn t work for free 
                    and, no offence, but you don t 
                    strike me as the bleeding heart 
                    type either.  My question stands: 
                    what s this all about?

                                  GINA 
                    Mr Quirke s innocence is not the 
                    only unusual feature.  He also 
                    turned himself in.

                                  HARRY
                    Stevie?  A walk-in?

                                  GINA 
                    Three days ago.

                                  HARRY
                    So Stevie turned himself in and 
                    confessed but... he s innocent?

                                  GINA 
                    I was getting to that.

                                  HARRY
                    Could you get to it a little 
                    faster, Gina, because I m getting 
                    confused.

                                  GINA 
                    My client did turn himself in and 
                    he did confess.  But.  When I 
                    went to take instructions, he 
                    insisted he d made the whole 
                    thing up.

                                  HARRY
                          (laughs)
                    I m sure he did.

                                  GINA 
                    He confessed because he s 
                      terrified.  So terrified, in 
                    fact, that he d rather be in 
                    prison.  

                                  HARRY
                    What s he terrified of?

                                  GINA 
                    He won t tell me.  He wants you 
                    to help him.                                                                                11.


                                  HARRY
                    How?

                                  GINA
                    He wants you to find someone for 
                    him.

                                  HARRY
                    Look.  You re a smart woman.  I 
                    know you re smart because you re 
                    not drinking the coffee.  But I m 
                    just a high street solicitor.  
                    Me, myself and I.  What you need 
                    is an enquiry agent.  I can 
                    recommend one.

                                  GINA
                    The man Mr Quirke wants you to 
                    find is Joseph Francis Collins.
                          (off Harry s look)
                    You know him, I believe.

                                  HARRY 
                    Stevie Quirke and Joe Collins?  
                    You re building a case on them?  
                    You don t need an enquiry agent, 
                    Gina, you need a magician.  I m 
                    sorry to hear about Stevie.  He s 
                    stupid but not all bad and I d be 
                    sorry to see him sent down even 
                    for something he did do.  But I m 
                    not your man for this.  

                                  GINA 
                      I disagree.  You have the special 
                    kind of contacts my client needs.

      She gives him a look, implying she knows something about 
      him.  Harry doesn t like the look.

                                  HARRY
                    What are you after?  What are you 
                    really after?

                                  GINA 
                    I am a lawyer doing my best to 
                    get justice for my client.

                                  HARRY
                    You know what gives you away, 
                    Gina?  No lawyer uses the word 
                    justice when they re talking 
                    about their client.  Whatever 
                    game you ve got going here, I m 
                    not playing with you.

      Harry makes to get up...                                                                                12.


                                  GINA 
                          (cool)
                    Mr Quirke anticipated your 
                    reaction.  Accordingly, he 
                      instructed me to tell you that he 
                    has information, which he is 
                    willing to pass on to you.

                                  HARRY 
                      Information about what?

                                  GINA
                    Your brother Mark. 

      Harry stares at her.  

                                  HARRY
                    What did he tell you exactly?   
                    About Mark?  His exact words.

                                  GINA
                    Exactly what I ve told you.  I m 
                    following my client s 
                      instructions.  You have my card.
                          (politely)
                    Thank you for the coffee.

      She leaves.  Harry sits there.  Thinking.

                                                                      FLASHBACK:


      E/I. BRADDICK S HOUSE - EVENING 19891818

      Ben Lander opens the door.  Mark smashes a fist into his 
      face.  Lander staggers back and falls.



      Harry still sitting there.  He picks up Gina s card and 
      looks at it.  He takes out his mobile.



      Matt picks up.

                                  MATT
                    Venn and Co.


      CROSSCUT:

                                  HARRY
                    Matt, I want you to find out 
                      everything you can about a firm 
                    called Hodgkins Truss Wilson.                                                                                  13.


                                  MATT
                    Where are they?  London?

                                  HARRY
                    No address on the card.  


      CLOSE ON - MATT S COMPUTER

      He navigates away from a page on prime minister Brian 
      Worsley s coalition talks and Googles Hodgkins Truss 
      Wilson.

                                  MATT 
                    They re not showing up on Google.

                                  HARRY
                    What about Gina Hawkes?

                                  MATT
                    Nothing.

                                  HARRY
                    Nothing?

                                  MATT
                    Uh-uh.

                                  HARRY
                    There s a number 0858 777777.  
                    Call it and find out. 

                                  MATT
                    Okay.  By the way, Frank Hanna 
                    just called.  He wants you there 
                    for when the jury comes back.

                                  HARRY
                    How long have they been out?

                                  MATT
                    An hour.

                                  HARRY
                    We threw enough sand in their 
                    eyes, they ll be out all day.  

      We hear a GROAN O.C.

                                                                          CUT TO:



      Watched closely and unsympathetically by Russell, George 
      looks down at the body, distraught.  It s--

      MARK, George s son.                                                                                14.


      Dead.

                                  GEORGE
                    Mark.

      George hangs his head, struggling not to let grief 
      overwhelm him.



      Harry drains the coffee and exits.



      A PRISON OFFICER leads the way.  Harry follows.  The place 
      is sterile and cold.  Disembodied voices echo weirdly.  

      CCTV cameras turn to follow them.



      Harry comes in and looks around.


      HIS POV - THE ROOM:

      SEVERAL PRISONERS sit at tables with RELATIVES and FRIENDS, 
      talking quietly.

      Harry s gaze settles on a small man of about sixty sitting 
      half-hidden in a corner.  This is STEVE QUIRKE, shaky and 
      desperate.

      Quirke smiles ingratiatingly up at Harry.

                                  HARRY
                          (without preamble)
                    What s this shit about my 
                    brother?

                                  QUIRKE
                          (aggrieved)
                    Is that how you say hello, Harry? 
                    After all these years?

                                  HARRY
                    I want to know about this crap 
                    you ve been handing out.  What are 
                    you selling here, Stevie?  Are you 
                    going to tell me who killed Mark?  
                    Is that it?

                                  QUIRKE
                    You help me, I give you what you 
                    want.                                                                                 15.


      Beat...  Harry regards him carefully.

                                  HARRY
                    You walk in.  You confess.  Because 
                    you re scared?  Then... what?  You 
                    decide you re not so scared after 
                    all?  You want out?  What?

                                  QUIRKE
                          (with emotion)
                    I m offering a deal here!  Help 
                    me, you get what I know.  That s 
                    all I got to deal with, Harry.  
                    You understand?

      Harry looks at him for a moment.

                                  HARRY
                    How did you find Gina Hawkes?

                                  QUIRKE
                    What do you mean?

                                  HARRY
                    Stevie, I couldn t find Gina 
                    Hawkes and people might say I m 
                    somewhat better placed than you.  

                                  QUIRKE
                    Someone gave me her number.

                                  HARRY
                    Who?

                                  QUIRKE
                    I don t remember.  

      Harry s look says: I don t believe you.

                                  HARRY
                    And she agrees to act for you why?

                                  QUIRKE
                          (evasive)
                    You ain t got the hump, have you?  
                    That I didn t go to you?  You re 
                    an old pal, Harry.  Let me shake 
                    your hand, just for the warm feel 
                    of it.

      He reaches over and takes Harry s hand, pulling him towards 
      him.

                                  QUIRKE (CONT D)
                    I heard things wasn t going too 
                    good for you.

                                  HARRY
                    They ve been worse.                                                                                16.


                                  QUIRKE
                    Yeah, I know that s true.

      Harry releases his hand.  His voice is cold again.

                                  HARRY
                    Mark.  Tell me now or I m out the 
                    door.

      He stands and starts for the door.

                                  QUIRKE
                    You re all I got left, Harry. You 
                    turn your back, I m dead.

                                  HARRY
                    If you know who killed Mark, tell 
                    me now.

      Beat...  Quirke leans forward.

                                  QUIRKE
                    You ll never guess who I bumped 
                    into.
                          (off Harry s look)
                    Paul Hillman.

      Harry staring hard at Quirke.  Harry slowly returns to his 
      seat.  

                                  QUIRKE (CONT D)
                    Straight up.

                                                                      FLASHBACK:



      Staring back at the flashing blue lights behind them.

                                    HILLMAN
                    Shit.  There s two of them now.

                                  MARK
                    Relax, Hillman, will you?  We re 
                    going to be okay.

                                  DRIVER
                    There s one in front.

      Hillman swivels round to see a POLICE CAR coming right at 
      them on the narrow road.  He grips the back of the seat in 
      front of him.

                                    HILLMAN
                    We re going to hit them!  Stop!                                                                                17.


                                  MARK
                          (calmly to the driver)
                    You can do it, kid.  Focus.

      The police car accelerates.  They re going to collide.

                                                                        BACK TO:



                                  QUIRKE
                    I saw him and I recognized him -  
                    Paul Hillman.  
                          (off Harry s look)
                    I saw what I saw, Harry.

                                  HARRY
                    There s just one problem here. 

                                                                      FLASHBACK:



      Russell snaps back the sheet to reveal the face of the 
      SECOND BODY--


      PAUL HILLMAN

      Dead. 

                                    RUSSELL
                    Do you recognize this man?

                                  GEORGE
                    Paul Hillman.

                                                                        BACK TO:



                                  HARRY
                    Paul Hillman s dead.  He s been 
                    dead for twenty years.  My dad 
                    ID d his body, same time he ID d 
                    Mark s.

                                  QUIRKE
                    I saw him.

                                  HARRY
                    When?                                                                                18.


                                  QUIRKE
                    Few days ago, just before I come in 
                    here.  Harry, if Hillman s alive, 
                    what does that say about Mark?

      A red mist descends over Harry; this is as much as he can 
      take.  He grabs Quirke by the throat.

                                  HARRY
                    What the hell are you playing at?

                                  QUIRKE
                    Harry--
                          (as Harry squeezes)
                    Harry, please--

      Harry releases him.  Quirke fights to get his breath back.

                                  QUIRKE (CONT'D)
                    I seen him, Harry, and he s 
                    breathing like you and me.

                                  HARRY
                    The dead don t come back.

      Harry struggles to keep himself under control.

                                  QUIRKE
                    I saw him.

                                  HARRY
                    Okay.  Where?

      Beat...

                                  QUIRKE
                    I don t really remember.  

                                  HARRY
                    You saw a dead man and you don t 
                    remember where?

                                  QUIRKE
                    The tube.

                                  HARRY
                    Where on the tube?  What station, 
                    what line?

                                  QUIRKE
                    I saw him.  I swear on my child s 
                    life.

      Harry studies him.

                                  HARRY
                    Why do you need me to find Joe 
                    Collins?  How can Joe help you?                                                                                19.


                                  QUIRKE
                    He s got something that can get 
                    me out of this.

                                  HARRY
                    What?  Tell me, Stevie or I m out 
                    of here.  What?

                                  QUIRKE
                    A laptop.
                          (cutting off Harry s 
                            next question)
                    I m not saying anything more.  
                    That s it.  I can t.

      Beat...

                                  HARRY
                    You wouldn t be setting me up, 
                    would you, Stevie?

                                  QUIRKE
                    Set you up for what?

                                  HARRY
                    Something that happened.  Long 
                    time ago.  Something where 
                    there s no statute of 
                      limitations.

                                  QUIRKE
                    If you don t find Joe for me, I m 
                    dead.

                                  HARRY
                    Relax, Stevie.  They abolished 
                    the death penalty years ago.

      Harry looks at Quirke.

                                  HARRY (CONT D)
                    You ve got my number.  Call me when 
                    you decide you want to tell me what 
                    the fuck s going on.

      Harry gets up and walks away.

                                  QUIRKE
                    Harry!  Harry!

      Harry ignores him.



      Matt is on the phone.  TWO CLIENTS sit impatiently.  
      They ve been there for a while.                                                                                20.


                                  MATT
                    Frank Hanna called.  Three times.  
                    He wants to know why you re not 
                    answering your mobile and why 
                    you re not there.

      He glances at the waiting clients.

                                  MATT (CONT D)
                    Mr Peters is here and Mrs Crawford.  
                    What should I tell them?


      CROSSCUT:



      Harry tries to put the key in the ignition.  He can t.  His 
      hand is trembling.

                                                                      FLASHBACK:



      Brick walls, low lighting, high barred window.

      THREE MEN in the cell.  Two are cops - one of them Fenton 
      Russell.  The third man is the prisoner.  

      The prisoner, who face we don t see, is thrown across the 
      cell and slammed into the wall.

      THE PRISONER S POV--

                                    RUSSELL
                    Braddick is dead.  Two policemen 
                    are dead.  

      The other cop punches the prisoner in the kidney.  The 
      prisoner collapses and is pulled back up again.

                                    RUSSELL (CONT D)
                    Maybe you weren t driving.  Maybe 
                    you had the gun.  Maybe you were 
                    the shooter.

      Another punch.

                                    RUSSELL (CONT'D)
                    You were driving or you had the 
                    gun?  Your choice.

                                                                        BACK TO:



      Harry hits some buttons on his mobile.

                                  HARRY 
                    It s me.



      HARRY and LAUREN lie in bed.  Post coital.  It was good.

                                  LAUREN
                    Don t get ideas - this is not going 
                    to happen again.

      Lauren gets out of bed and starts to get dressed.  Harry 
      stares out the window, pensive.

                                  HARRY
                    What was Russell doing at Belmarsh?

                                  LAUREN
                    He s a cop.  Cops are like 
                      solicitors - they go to prisons 
                    from time to time.

                                  HARRY
                    The same day, the same time I 
                    happen to be there?

                                  LAUREN
                    Harry, it s a coincidence.  
                      Unpleasant, but just a coincidence.

                                  HARRY
                    Lauren, the man I went to see told 
                    me he saw Paul Hillman, alive.

      Lauren turns to him.

                                  LAUREN
                    What?  Who?  Who said that?

                                  HARRY
                    An old face - Stevie Quirke.  He 
                    was insistent.  He saw Paul 
                    Hillman.  A few days ago.                                                                                24.


                                  LAUREN
                          (concerned, sympathetic)
                    Harry.  Hillman s dead and gone.  
                    Someone s messing with your head.

                                  HARRY
                    Why?

                                  LAUREN
                    I don t know why.  But leave it 
                    alone.  Harry, listen to me.  
                    Listen.  Hillman is dead.  That 
                    whole thing is gone.  Over.  The 
                    time has long passed for you to 
                    move on.

      Harry takes this in.

                                  LAUREN (CONT D)
                    Come on.  Michael s going to be 
                    home soon and I don t want him 
                    finding you here.

                                  HARRY
                    You always say I should see more of 
                    Michael.

                                  LAUREN
                    I don t want your son, who is 
                    already dealing with a lot of 
                    issues, to find you here like this.  
                    We re divorced.  It ll confuse him.

                                  HARRY
                    Confuse him?  What about me?

                                  LAUREN
                    Come on.

      He stays where he is.  He watches her getting dressed.

                                  HARRY
                    So are you seeing anyone?

                                  LAUREN
                    Yes.

                                  HARRY
                    Serious?

                                  LAUREN
                    I don t know yet.

                                  HARRY
                    Where did you meet him?                                                                                25.


                                  LAUREN
                    Internet dating.
                          (off his look)
                    Don t look like that.  That s the 
                    way it s done now.

                                  HARRY
                    I broke up with Frances today. 

                                  LAUREN
                    Again?

                                  HARRY
                    For good this time.

                                  LAUREN
                    Too bad.  She seemed like a nice 
                    girl.  I don t know what she was 
                    doing with you.

                                  HARRY
                    What were you doing with me?

                                  LAUREN
                    I m not as nice as her.  Come on, 
                    Harry.  Michael s going to be home 
                    soon.  Up!

      She exits.  Harry s mobile rings.

                                  GINA
                    It s Gina Hawkes, Mr Venn.

                                  HARRY
                    Harry.

                                  GINA
                    You called.

                                  HARRY
                    I got in to see your client.  I d 
                    like to talk to you more about his 
                    case.

                                  GINA 
                    I could see you for twenty minutes 
                    at 10 o clock.                                                                                  26.


                                  HARRY
                    Twenty minutes?

                                  GINA
                    I have a meeting at ten thirty.

                                  HARRY
                    You do meetings at night?

                                  GINA
                    When they re important.

                                  HARRY
                    I ll be there at ten.  Where are 
                    you?

      He reaches over for a pen and slip of paper.



      Lauren is opening a glass of wine and getting supper ready 
      for herself and Michael.  A small kitchen television set 
      plays in the corner.

                    ...The protestors were not one 
                      homogenous body.  Different groups 
                    with different agendas surged off 
                    in all directions, some clearly 
                    intent on violence.  Shops in Pall 
                    Mall and Picadilly were attacked 
                    and set alight.  In Whitehall, 
                    police vans were smashed up and 
                      overturned by a mob of students and 
                      anarchists said to number up to 
                    5,000.

                    At the same time, the main body of 
                      protestors coming along the 
                      Embankment were driven back by 
                    police using water cannons and CS 
                    gas.  There were further violent 
                    clashes between police and 
                      protestors in the City of London, 
                    with at least eighty arrests.  
                    There have been allegations from 
                    the march organizers that police 
                      over-reacted and claims that as 
                    many as 180 people needed hospital 
                    treatment as a result of the 
                    clashes.

      FOOTAGE OF BRIAN WORSLEY, THE PRIME MINISTER...

                    Prime Minister Brian Worsley also 
                    praised the police and condemned 
                    the violence.  And in what many 
                    political commentators are 
                      interpreting as a thinly veiled 
                    reference to his chief critic, 
                    former cabinet minister Alexander 
                      Wentworth, the prime minister went 
                    on to say that  those who have been 
                    trying to whip up an atmosphere of 
                    hysteria and panic must bear 
                      responsibility for the chaos and 
                    disorder on our streets.     
                    However, Mr Wentworth tonight 
                    dismissed the prime minister s 
                    statement with a stinging rebuke of 
                    his own. 

      FOOTAGE OF ALEXANDER WENTWORTH comes on the screen: 
      impressive, authoritative, handsome in a well-groomed, rich-
      man way.

                                  CLIP OF WENTWORTH
                    Let s not kid ourselves.  The 
                    reason the police are out there 
                    having to deal with this level of 
                    disorder is because Brian Worsley 
                    is bankrupt.  With the recent 
                      revelations about his financial 
                    affairs, we now know he is morally 
                    bankrupt.  He is now also 
                      politically bankrupt.  His 
                    coalition has fallen apart.  He 
                    simply has no idea what to do.  
                    This is not a man to lead us out of 
                    the gravest crisis we have faced 
                    since the Battle of Britain.  

      Lauren hears Harry on the stairs.

                                  LAUREN
                    Have you seen this?

      She indicates the television pictures.                                                                                28.


                                  LAUREN (CONT D)
                    This feels different, doesn t it?

                                  HARRY
                    What s different about it? 

                                  LAUREN
                    We don t have a government for 
                    one thing.

                                  HARRY
                    Have you noticed?  I haven t 
                    noticed.

      He goes to her.

                                  HARRY (CONT D)
                    It was good to see you.

      He goes to kiss her.  Lauren is very clear that s it no more 
      than a peck on the cheek.

                                  LAUREN
                    See you.

      Harry turns to go.  

      He s at the front door when MICHAEL comes in.  Harry looks 
      him up and down.

                                  HARRY
                    Hello, son.

                                    MICHAEL
                    What are you doing here?

                                  HARRY
                    Nice way to say hello to your old 
                    man.

      Michael goes to the kitchen.

      Harry has to decide: Leave or follow this up.  He goes into 
      the kitchen where Michael is at the fridge.

                                  HARRY (CONT D)
                    Listen, whatever else has happened 
                    between your mother and me, I am 
                    still your father.

      Lauren shoots him a look: This is not the best approach.

                                  HARRY (CONT D)
                    Michael?

      Michael drinks from a carton of orange juice, screws the top 
      back on and replaces it in the fridge.                                                                                29.


                                  HARRY (CONT D)
                    Michael?  Did you hear me?

      Michael ignores him and goes upstairs.

                                  HARRY (CONT D)
                    Did you see that?

                                  LAUREN
                    I see it every day.

                                  HARRY
                    Lauren, he needs to show some 
                    respect.

                                  LAUREN
                    You need to spend time with him.

      Harry turns to go.

                                  HARRY
                    Internet dating?
                          (serious?)

                                  LAUREN
                    Goodbye, Harry.

      He exits.




      Modern furnishing, low lights.  Harry sits at a table 
      nursing a drink and looking through the evening paper. 

      The headline reads:

      WENTWORTH CALLS ON PM TO GO AS UNREST GROWS

      Harry checks his watch: 10:40.  He s on the point of 
      leaving. 

      Gina Hawkes materializes and glides into the seat opposite.  
      She looks gorgeous, made up and dressed for a classy night 
      out.

                                  HARRY
                    You always dress like that for 
                    work meetings?

                                  GINA
                    I didn t say it was a work 
                    meeting.

                                  HARRY
                    Do you want a drink?                                                                                30.


                                  GINA 
                    An old fashioned.

      Harry is impressed.

                                  HARRY
                          (to the waiter)
                    An old fashioned and another 
                    vodka.

                                  GINA 
                    You went to see Mr Quirke?

                                  HARRY
                    Do you do a lot of crime, Gina?

                                  GINA 
                    Not as much as you, I believe.

      Harry doesn t know how to take this: Is she hinting at 
      something more?

                                  HARRY
                    What I mean is: your client, Mr 
                    Quirke, hasn t got a hope in 
                    hell. I thought you d like to 
                    know that.  That s my advice - 
                    you can have it for free.

                                  GINA 
                          (smiles)
                    I deal in lost hopes, Mr. Venn.

                                  HARRY
                    Harry.

      She smiles politely.

                                  HARRY (CONT D)
                    What kind of a criminal lawyer 
                    are you, Gina.  In fact, are you 
                    any kind of criminal lawyer at 
                    all?  Where did you do your 
                    articles?  When did you qualify?

                                  GINA
                          (calmly)
                    You came here to talk about the 
                    case.

                                  HARRY 
                    You re more interesting. 

                                  GINA 
                    I can assure you I am not.

                                  HARRY
                    What is that accent?                                                                                31.


                                  GINA
                    Possibly a bit of Dutch, possibly a 
                    bit of French.  I had a peripatetic 
                      childhood.

      The waiter comes up, smiles professionally and sets out the 
      drinks.  He leaves the bill and departs.

                                  HARRY
                    Who are you, Gina Hawkes?

      She looks at him coldly.

                                  GINA 
                    My client asked me to contact you 
                    in order to locate a witness he 
                    believes is crucial to his case.  
                    I carried out his instructions, 
                    as I was obliged to.  This does 
                    not give you the right to be 
                      insulting.

                                  HARRY 
                    Name me one lawyer anywhere in 
                    London, anywhere in the country, 
                    you ve had dealings with.

                                  GINA 
                    Isn t Sir Nigel Fountain good 
                    enough for you?

                                  HARRY
                    Apart from this case.  Just one.

                                  GINA 
                    If you ll excuse me.

      She swallows her drink and gathers her things.

                                  GINA (CONT'D)
                    One thing I should have 
                      mentioned.  If you find Joe 
                    Collins, there will be a fee, 
                      naturally.

                                  HARRY 
                      Naturally.  What if I don t find 
                    him?

                                  GINA 
                    Oh, I think you re the kind of 
                    man who finds what he looks for.

                                  HARRY
                    Flattery is wasted on me, Gina.  
                    What kind of fee?

                                  GINA 
                    Shall we say... twenty thousand.                                                                                32.


                                  HARRY
                          (nods)
                    That s worth finding him.  But 
                    why is it worth twenty thousand 
                    to you?

                                  GINA 
                          (starts to stand)
                    Thank you for the drink, Mr Venn.

                                  HARRY
                    Harry.

      He reaches out and takes her wrist, stopping her.  He looks 
      down at her hand.  The sexual tension is palpable.

                                  HARRY (CONT'D)
                          (softly)
                    You re wearing the wrong nail 
                    polish.

                                  GINA 
                    I like it.

                                  HARRY
                    It doesn t suit you.

                                  GINA
                    What would you suggest?

                                  HARRY
                    Forget about this meeting you say 
                    you re going to.  Have another 
                    drink.

                                  GINA 
                    You re smart.  Don t be too 
                    smart.  Harry.

      She smiles at him and slips her hand from his grip.

      He watches her go, admiring the view, then tosses his 
      credit card on the platter.  The waiter comes over with the 
      machine.

                                  HARRY 
                          (to the waiter)
                    The woman I was with?

                                  WAITER
                    Yes, sir.

                                  HARRY
                    You haven t by any chance seen 
                    her before?

                                  WAITER
                    She s a guest.                                                                                33.


                                  HARRY
                    She s staying here?

                                  WAITER
                    Yes, sir.


      SCENE IS CONTINUOUS3838

                                  HARRY 
                    I d like to leave a message for 
                    her.

                                  WAITER
                      Certainly, sir.

      He hands Harry a pad and pen.  Harry scribbles a note, puts 
      it in a hotel envelope and hands it over.

                                  HARRY 
                    It s urgent.

                                  WAITER
                    I ll make sure Ms Hawkes gets it 
                    right away.

      The waiter beckons over a BELLBOY.



      Harry and the bellboy are alone in the lift.  Harry smiles 
      at him.  The man stifles a yawn before smiling politely 
      back.  

                                  HARRY
                    You need to get to bed.

                                    BELLBOY
                          (Eastern European)
                    No chance.

                                  HARRY
                    Long hours?

                                    BELLBOY
                    Very long.

                                  HARRY
                    Yeah, but I bet they pay you a 
                    fortune.

      He smiles.  The bellboy laughs bitterly.

                                    BELLBOY
                    Ha!  You English.  Make funny 
                    jokes that are not funny.

      The door opens onto the 3rd floor landing.                                                                                34.



      Harry follows the bellboy to 327.  The bellboy slips the 
      letter under the door.

                                  HARRY
                    You know what?  This is not a 
                    joke.  I d like to boost your 
                    pay.

      The bellboy looks around.

                                    BELLBOY
                    I would like you to do it too.

                                  HARRY
                    What would it cost me to get five 
                    minutes in that room?

      The bellboy looks like he might be interested.

                                  HARRY (CONT'D)
                    I m not going to take anything.   
                    I m not going to do anything.  
                    Just a quick look.  No one will 
                    know.   Five minutes.  

                                    BELLBOY
                    Five hundred.

                                  HARRY
                    Why don t we split the difference 
                    and say thirty quid?



      Harry picks up the letter and pockets it.  He goes to a 
      laptop.  It asks for a password.  He types Gina, then gina, 
      then ginahawkes.  No go, as he expected.

      There s some paperwork on the desk: Depositions from R v. 
      Quirke.  Copies of statements of police witnesses, 
      forensics reports, phone records, etc.  All in order.  
      Harry scribbles down some details.

      Then he finds TWO FOLDERS...

      FOLDER 1 IS MARKED  MOSCATI 

      It contains a photograph of Jennifer Moscati with a man.  
      They look like lovers.  

      There are documents, some of them legal, others downloaded 
      newspaper reports.  They re in French.  It s a long time 
      since Harry read anything in French.  He concentrates...

                                                                      FLASHBACK:                                                                                35.



      Harry turns over a page.

                                                                      FLASHBACK:



      Harry stares at Mezwar Tanzir s photograph

                                                                      FLASHBACK:



      FOLDER 2 IS MARKED  BRADDICK                                                                                 36.


      Harry s heart thumps in his chest.  His hands tremble as he 
      opens the file.  He sees a photograph of--


      POLICE MUGSHOT OF THE YOUNG HARRY


      PHOTO OF HARRY TAKEN WITH A LONG LENS OUTSIDE HIS OFFICE, 
      PRESENT DAY


      PHOTOCOPY OF ORIGINAL ARTICLE FROM LOCAL NEWSPAPER WITH PHOTO 
      OF YOUNG HARRY AND HEADLINE:  BRADDICK MURDERS: POLICE 
      QUESTION LOCAL YOUTH 

                                                                      FLASHBACK:



      Mark turns to the driver.  We see the young Harry for the 
      first time.

                                  MARK
                    You okay?

                                  HARRY
                    What happened back there?  You said 
                    no one was going to get hurt.

      Hillman and Mark exchange a look: Obviously this was the line 
      they gave to Harry.

                                  MARK
                    It s what Styles wanted.

                                  HARRY
                    Who?

      Hillman is unhappy the name has been mentioned.

                                    HILLMAN
                    Never mind.  Just do your job.

                                                                        BACK TO:



      Harry goes through the file.  He finds a photo of--


      MARK

      Smiling.  Not a care in the world.  Taken shortly before his 
      death.  Harry can t stop looking at it.  Moved.                                                                                  37.


                                  HARRY
                    Mark.

      There are also photographs of Braddick, Lander and Hillman, 
      with names and brief biographical details.  

      There is also a photograph of a special forces type with the 
      name underneath - JASON STYLES.  

      [NOTE: The photos are all from the period around 1989, 
      including that of Styles]

                                  HARRY (CONT D)
                    Styles?

      Harry stares at the photo for a long time.  Mesmerized.  
      Transfixed.

                                  HARRY (CONT D)
                    Jason Styles.
                          (beat...)
                    Who are you, Gina Hawkes?

      There s a soft knock at the door.  Harry freezes.  Someone 
      comes in.

                                    BELLBOY
                    You have more than five minutes.

                                  HARRY
                    One more minute.

                                    BELLBOY
                    I cannot take the chance.

                                  HARRY
                          (offering him a bill)
                    Here s twenty more.

                                    BELLBOY
                    Make fast.

      Harry goes to the wardrobe.  He goes through the pockets of 
      her coats and jackets.  Nothing of interest.



      Face creams, moisturizers, toothpaste...  and a packet of 
      pills.  Harry picks it up and scrutinizes it.

                                  HARRY
                      Zopiclone.  So you don t sleep 
                    too well, Gina?

      Harry turns the packet round to read the back.

                                  HARRY (CONT'D)
                    Harley Street.  Naturally.                                                                                38.


      The dispensing doctor s name.  Harry makes a note of it and 
      replaces the packet.

                                    BELLBOY
                          (coming in)
                    You have to go.  Now!



      Harry is unpacking the R v. Collins box in Matt s cramped 
      livingroom.  Matt returns with two cans of Red Stripe.  

                                  MATT
                    I ve got some blow, if you want 
                    it.

                                  HARRY
                    Later.  Maybe.

      Harry divides the papers.  Matt turns on the iPod dock.  
      Some awful sound comes out, which Matt dances to.

                                  MATT
                          (dancing)
                    Harry... ?

                                  HARRY
                    Yeah?

                                  MATT 
                    What are we looking for?

                                  HARRY
                    Anything that can help us find Mr 
                    Joseph Francis Collins.  

      Harry starts leafing through the file...


      MONTAGE:


      PAGES OF DEPOSITIONS AND WITNESS STATEMENTS...


      MUGSHOTS...


      PHOTOGRAPHS OF EXHIBITS...  


      CUSTODY LOGS...


      MATT CHOPPING SOME COKE...


      HARRY LOOKING OVER, TRYING TO IGNORE THE COKE...                                                                                39.


      HARRY POPPING A CAN OF BEER...


      READING A DEPOSITION...


      HARRY FINDING A NAME...


      DEAN STUBBS...  HARRY RINGS IT...


      HE LOOKS OVER AT THE COKE... 


      CAN T RESIST.



      Harry opens his eyes.  He s sitting on the floor, back 
      against a chair.  He looks around at the detritus.  

      He gets wearily to his feet, passes Matt and MATT S 
      GIRLFRIEND sprawled out in bed and goes into the kitchen.

      Harry stretches and yawns and gets a glass of water.  He 
      feels bad - beer and coke.  

      He turns on the radio...

                                  RADIO NEWSREADER
                    News outlets of the RDD Media 
                    Group have today published claims 
                    that the prime minister Brian 
                    Worsley set up two secret 
                    offshore bank accounts with 
                    assets totalling nine million 
                    pounds...

      Harry looks at his phone: Three missed calls from Lauren.  
      Harry hits some numbers on his mobile.

                                  HARRY
                          (into the phone)
                    I thought you said it wasn t going 
                    to happen again.

                                  LAUREN (PHONE)
                    Michael s been arrested.



      Lauren looks drawn and tense.  She looks Harry over, 
      registering his condition.                                                                                40.


                                  LAUREN
                    Oh Harry...  Look at you.

                                  HARRY
                    Michael s the one who s been 
                    arrested.

                                  LAUREN
                    The police are going to think the 
                    apple doesn t fall too far from the 
                    tree.  

                                  HARRY
                    What happened?

                                  LAUREN
                    After you left Michael went out for 
                    a drive.  Unfortunately, the car 
                    didn t belong to him.

                                  HARRY
                    Could be worse.

                                  LAUREN
                      Joyriding?  It s not great.  

                                  HARRY
                    Has he been charged?

                                  LAUREN
                    Yes.  They ve given him bail.  He 
                    should be out soon.

      They sit.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      LATER

      A door opens and Michael is shown through by a POLICE 
      SERGEANT who has a sheaf of forms.  Harry and Lauren get to 
      their feet.  Michael looks shaken.  Lauren puts a hand to his 
      face - a mixture of relief, disappointment and anger in her 
      face.

                                  LAUREN
                    How are you?

      Michael shrugs.  The police sergeant looks over to Lauren and 
      indicates the paperwork.  

                                  LAUREN (CONT D)
                    I ll be back in a minute.

      She follows the police sergeant into an anteroom, leaving 
      Harry alone with Michael.                                                                                41.


                                  HARRY
                    Don t worry - worse case you ll get 
                    five years.
                          (off Michael s look)
                    Kidding.  You ll get a rap over the 
                    knuckles.  

      Michael looks glum.

                                  HARRY (CONT D)
                    Why did you do it?

      Beat...  Michael looks at him.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Who are you?

                                  HARRY
                    Your father.

                                    MICHAEL
                    No.  No, my father left.

      Lauren comes up.

                                  LAUREN
                    What were you thinking?

                                    MICHAEL
                    Sorry.

                                  LAUREN
                    Go get in the car.

      He goes.

                                  LAUREN (CONT D)
                    Thanks for coming.  You should go 
                    home and shower.  And change your 
                    clothes.  

      Lauren turns to go.

                                  HARRY
                    Lauren.

      She stops.

                                  HARRY (CONT D)
                    Thanks for telling me.  About 
                    Michael.

      She smiles and goes.


      OMITTED5454                                                                                42.



      Harry enters.  The phones are ringing.

                                  HARRY
                    Matt?  Matt?

      No one in.  Harry is not pleased.  Harry ignores the 
      ringing phones and goes to the safe.  He spins the dial, 
      opens it and removes an envelope.  Matt walks in.  In 
      better shape than Harry.

                                  HARRY (CONT'D)
                    You re late.

                                  MATT
                    Yeah, I had a heavy night.

      Matt hits the phone messages and goes to put on the kettle.

                                    FRANCES (MESSAGE)
                    Harry, it s Frances, I hope you 
                    listen to this because I m 
                    genuinely trying to help you.  
                    I m trying to help you become a 
                    better person.

                                  MATT
                    This should be interesting.

                                  HARRY
                    Turn it off.

                                    FRANCES
                    You need to take a long hard look 
                    at yourself, Harry, and you need 
                    to apologize to me for the way 
                    you ve treated me...

                                  HARRY
                    Turn it off!

                                    FRANCES
                      ...because until you apologize, you 
                    won t be able to grow as a human 
                    being.                                                                                43.


                                  HARRY
                          (warningly)
                    Matt--

      Harry leans over and presses a button to stop the message. 

                                  HARRY (CONT D)
                    Call the clerk at Barter Court 
                    Chambers. See if you can get me 
                    ten minutes with the head of 
                    chambers, Nigel Fountain.

                                  MATT 
                    What do I tell him?

                                  HARRY
                    Say it s to do with the Quirke 
                    case.

                                  MATT
                    You know you ve got that hearing 
                    at Highbury?   

                                  HARRY
                    Remind me?

                                  MATT
                    That woman they arrested for 
                    taking the photograph of the bus?

      On the way to the door...

                                  HARRY 
                    Call Lisa Merrick, see if she can 
                    get down to cover for me.

                                  MATT
                    You re gonna get struck off, 
                    Harry, you re not careful.

                                  HARRY
                    Thank you for your concern.

                                  MATT
                    The concern is about me and my 
                    job.

      As Harry exits...

                                  MATT (CONT'D)
                    And don t forget Frank Hanna.



      A real old sweaty boxing gym.  Not a friendly place to those 
      who don t belong here.  HEAVY GUYS stare at Harry. He smiles 
      as he approaches a boxer - GERRY.                                                                                44.


                                  HARRY
                    Is Dean in?

                                  GERRY
                    Dean who?

                                  HARRY
                    Dean Stubbs.

                                  GERRY
                    Never heard of no Dean Stubbs.

                                  HARRY 
                    Mind if I look around?  I ve been 
                    thinking of joining a gym.

      Gerry checks Harry out.

                                  GERRY
                    You should.

      Harry pokes around.  One guy is doing chin-ups, another is 
      spotting his friend on the bench. 

      DEAN STUBBS is using a punch bag.  He is dark-haired, lean 
      and dangerous looking, and he s giving the bag a real 
      hammering.

                                  HARRY 
                    I m looking for a friend of a 
                    friend of mine.

      Dean keeps punching.

                                  HARRY (CONT'D)
                    My friend s called Joe Collins.

      Dean keeps punching.

                                  HARRY (CONT'D)
                    Joe has a friend who comes in 
                    here.  

                                  DEAN
                    What s his name?

                                  HARRY
                    He s a boxer - Dean.  Dean 
                    Stubbs.  You re Dean, aren t you?  

      Dean looks at Harry.  

                                  HARRY (CONT'D)
                    We met before.  When Joe was on 
                    trial.  Snaresbrook?                                                                                45.


      Dean swings a vicious left.  Harry turns away, which is why 
      Dean s fist connects only to the back of Harry s head.  All 
      the same Harry goes down and out.

                                                                      FLASHBACK:



      Harry comes to, like out of a nightmare.  His head hurts.  
      He is lying on slatted wooden benches.  A NAKED MAN walks 
      past with a towel.                                                                                46.


      Harry sits up and has to lie down again.  His head is 
      swimming.  

      He looks around.  It s a changing room.  A couple of men 
      are drying themselves off, getting dressed.  The naked man 
      gets into one of the three shower cubicles.

      Harry s mouth fills with vomit.  He just about makes it to 
      a bin.



      Harry lurches up to Gerry and hands over his card.

                                  HARRY
                    Give this to Dean next time he 
                    comes in.  Tell him to call me, 
                    day or night.

                                  GERRY
                    You want some water?

      He hands over a bottle.

                                  HARRY
                    He sucker punched me.

                                  GERRY
                    Don t come back.

                                  HARRY
                    Tell him no hard feelings.



      Head back, eyes closed, suffering.  His mobile rings.

                                  HARRY
                          (into the mobile)
                    Yeah?

                                  FRANK HANNA
                    Know how many times I ve called 
                    you?

                                  HARRY
                    Frank, how s it going?

                                  FRANK HANNA
                    You re the lawyer, you tell me.

                                  HARRY
                    I m on my way.                                                                                47.


                                  FRANK HANNA
                    Get here lively, H.  The judge 
                    has already told the jury he ll 
                    accept a majority.

      Harry ends the call, puts the car in gear and pulls away.



      Harry hurries through the corridors.  The USHERS and 
      FLUNKIES know him.  He hurries into...



      ...just in time to see...


      FRANK HANNA 

      (40s), slow-moving, fast-thinking with a long history of 
      criminal violence, shaking hands with his QC and JUNIOR 
      COUNSEL.

                                  FRANK HANNA
                    Thought for a bit there you 
                    weren t gonna show, H.

                                  HARRY
                    I got you a result, didn t I?

                                  FRANK HANNA
                    I m an innocent man.  If you 
                    can t get an innocent man off, 
                    what are you good for?  

                                  HARRY
                    The innocent ones are the 
                    hardest, believe me.  

                                  FRANK HANNA
                    You don t look too good, H.



      Harry and Hanna are alone together.

                                  HARRY
                    I met a woman yesterday.

                                  FRANK HANNA
                    Nice?

                                  HARRY
                      Beautiful.  Intelligent.  Looks 
                    like she has money.                                                                                48.


                                  FRANK HANNA
                    You should be a very happy man.

                                  HARRY
                    On paper.  Trouble is I think she s 
                    trying to set me up.

                                  FRANK HANNA
                    For what?

                                  HARRY
                          (low)
                    The thing that happened that night 
                    with Mark and Hillman.

                                  FRANK HANNA
                    The Braddick thing?
                          (off Harry s look)
                    Holy shit.

      Hanna looks round to make sure they re not being overheard.  
      This is very serious.

                                  FRANK HANNA (CONT D)
                    What do you mean set you up?  How?  
                    What are you talking about?

                                  HARRY
                    This woman got me to go see Stevie 
                    Quirke.  

                                  FRANK HANNA
                    Stevie?  What s he got to do with 
                    Braddick?

                                  HARRY
                    He said he saw Paul Hillman.

                                  FRANK HANNA
                    Stevie saw Paul Hillman?  What the 
                    fuck is this?

                                  HARRY
                    Yeah. Exactly.

                                  HARRY (CONT D)
                    I want to ask you a favour.  It 
                    might not be completely legal.  In 
                    fact, it s totally illegal.

                                  FRANK HANNA
                    Harry.

                                  HARRY
                    Yeah?

                                  FRANK HANNA
                    Hillman s dead.                                                                                49.


                                  HARRY
                    I know.

                                  FRANK HANNA
                    Mark s dead.

                                  HARRY
                    I know.

                                  FRANK HANNA
                    You want my advice?

                                  HARRY
                    No.



      Harry sits on an operating table, legs over the side.  DR 
      STURGESS, 60s, Scottish, is examining his head where he was 
      punched. 

                                  DR STURGESS
                    Is your vision at all affected?

                                  HARRY
                    No, it s fine.

                                  DR STURGESS
                    Headache?

                                  HARRY
                    Yes.

                                  DR STURGESS
                    How often do you take cocaine?

                                  HARRY
                    Excuse me?
                          (off Sturgess s look)
                    I had a little last night.

                                  DR STURGESS
                    Is it a regular thing?

                                  HARRY
                    No.



      Hanna makes his way up the stairs into the corridor and 
      checks a couple of doors.  Behind one door, he finds another 
      set of stairs going down.                                                                                50.



                                  DR STURGESS
                    We ve taken an X-ray but I m 
                    going to recommend you have an 
                    MRI.

                                  HARRY
                    I don t think it s that bad.

                                  DR STURGESS
                    Just to be on the safe side.

      Dr Sturgess goes to his desk and taps at his computer.

                                  HARRY
                    You were recommended by a friend 
                    of mine.  Gina Hawkes?

                                  DR STURGESS
                    I m making an appointment for 
                    you.

                                  HARRY
                    She says the Zopiclone is really 
                    helping her with the insomnia.  

                                  DR STURGESS
                    But there ll probably be a bit of 
                    a wait.  Let me find out.

                                  HARRY
                    Beautiful woman, isn t she?

      Sturgess stops what he s doing. Stands and goes to a tray 
      on which are instruments. He begins filling a hypodermic 
      needle.

                                  STURGESS
                    You ll need a tetanus shot.

                                  HARRY
                    It wasn t that bad, Doc.  No 
                    blood--

                                  STURGESS
                    Roll up your sleeve, please.

      He comes towards Harry, needle poised.  Harry hesitates.  
      There is something about the doctor now that has become 
      menacing. 

                                  STURGESS (CONT'D)
                          (a command)
                    Roll up your sleeve.

      The doctor comes closer, ready to give Harry the injection. 

      Harry slips off the table.                                                                                51.


                                  HARRY
                            (chattering)
                    Some other time.  Thanks, anyway. 
                    Not enough doctors on the ball 
                    these days.  I ll come back.

      He goes out.



      Harry quickly pays the RECEPTIONIST and rejoins Frank 
      Hanna, who has been waiting.

                                  HARRY 
                    What do you think?

                                  FRANK HANNA
                    Doable.



      They walk to Harry s car, past a CCTV camera.

                                  FRANK HANNA
                    But doable for what?  What do you 
                    want?

                                  HARRY
                    I don t know who Gina Hawkes is.  
                    And I can t find out - she doesn t 
                    show up anywhere.  But if she s on 
                    the doctor s books, there ll be 
                    medical records.  There ll be an 
                    address, there ll be something.  
                    That s what I want.  

                                  FRANK HANNA
                    Okay.

                                  HARRY
                    They ll be computerized.

                                  FRANK HANNA
                    I got a guy.

                                  HARRY
                    Call me when it s done.

                                  FRANK HANNA
                    You ll answer this time?

                                  HARRY
                    Here.

      He hands over some money.                                                                                52.


                                  HARRY (CONT'D)
                    Expenses.

      As he gets into the car...

                                  FRANK HANNA
                    H.  Back when I was working, some 
                    mornings I d be driving to the 
                    job and I d look out and see all 
                    these people doing ordinary 
                    things.  Waiting at a bus-stop, 
                    buying a newspaper, buying a 
                    sandwich, and I d look at them 
                    and think why am I putting myself 
                    through this?  They re all 
                    relaxed, happy, probably.  Me?  
                    I m on my way to pull a robbery 
                    and the blood is beating in my 
                    veins, my head feels light, I m 
                    feeling sick...  One time I 
                    turned to Wendell, remember 
                    Wendell?  I turned to Wendell and 
                    I said, You know we could stop.  
                    We could go to a caff, have a 
                    coffee, read the paper, go home.  
                    We don t have to do this.  You 
                      understand what I m telling you?

                                  HARRY
                    What did Wendell say?

                                  FRANK HANNA
                    Long as you understand, because 
                    actions have consequences - that s 
                    just the law of nature. 

                                  HARRY
                    I need to know who killed Mark.  
                    And why.

                                  FRANK HANNA
                    Even if it puts you in jail for 
                    twenty years?

      Nothing from Harry.



      ELSPETH VERNEY, late 30s, slim, glamorous, confident, 
      blonde and beautiful, sits at a table with JAMES MORPETH, 
      an aspiring Cassius, small, compact and acute.  

      A WAITER appears with a bottle of wine which he shows to 
      Morpeth.

                                  WAITER
                    Sir.  The Valpolicella, 05.                                                                                53.


      Morpeth nods and the waiter pours a bit in his glass.  He 
      takes a sip, rolls it around in his mouth, then nods.  The 
      waiter starts filling their glasses.

                                  VERNEY
                    I didn t know anyone still drank 
                      Valpolicella.  It s always been 
                    more or less plonk.

                                    MORPETH
                    They ve improved it.  Very 
                    drinkable now. 
                          (raises his glass)
                    Cheers.

                                  VERNEY
                    Cheers.

      They drink.  

                                  VERNEY (CONT D)
                    You re right.  Very tasty.

                                    MORPETH
                    Here he is.  Alex!  The man of 
                    the hour.

      ALEXANDER WENTWORTH approaches.  Young, polished, absurdly 
      confident, takes himself and his destiny very seriously.

                                  WENTWORTH
                    Sorry I m late. The protestors 
                    again. It s impossible to get 
                    through central London.

      He kisses Elspeth on both cheeks and sits.

                                    MORPETH
                    Who d have thought that rioting 
                    in London would get to become 
                      practically a daily occurrence.

      Wentworth sits.  Morpeth offers wine, which Wentworth 
      refuses with a motion of his hand.

                                  VERNEY
                    You were magnificent on the Today 
                      Programme, Alex.

                                    MORPETH
                    Yes, congratulations.  I thought 
                    you were terrific.  They re always 
                    horribly snide but I thought by the 
                    end you d won them over. 

                                  WENTWORTH
                    Thank you, James.                                                                                  54.


                                  VERNEY
                    It s because you re principled.  
                    You have integrity.

                                    MORPETH
                    Something Worsley could do with.

                                  VERNEY
                    I think it s too late for that, 
                    don t you.
                          (she sees something)
                    Speak of the devil.

      They turn to see--


      BRIAN WORSLEY

      The prime minister.  He look exhausted, stressed and 
      defensive.  He is accompanied by AIDES and MINDERS.

                                  VERNEY (CONT D)
                    You d think forming a government 
                    would be more important than 
                    having lunch.

      Worsley stops by their table.  Beat...  Frosty.

                                    WORSLEY
                      Alexander.

                                  WENTWORTH
                    Brian.

                                    WORSLEY
                    Hello, Elspeth.  

                                  VERNEY
                    Hello, Brian.  You know James 
                    Morpeth?

      Worsley nods neutrally: Morpeth is not his favourite person.

                                    WORSLEY
                    You ve known me since Cambridge, 
                    Elspeth - do you honestly think I 
                    would take bribes?

                                  VERNEY
                    If you d like to give us your side 
                    of the story, I d be more than 
                    happy to arrange an interview.

                                    WORSLEY
                    I ve already said I know nothing 
                    about these so-called offshore 
                    accounts.  Enjoy your lunch.                                                                                55.


      Worsley exits.  Back to business...  Verney fishes out a 
      file and passes it across to Wentworth, who opens and scans 
      it.  

                                  WENTWORTH
                    What s this?

                                  VERNEY
                    The dirt to put Worsley in his 
                    political grave.

      They glance over to see Worsley exit.

                                    MORPETH
                    Brain Worsley is a dead man 
                    walking.
