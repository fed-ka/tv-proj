               TITLE: MIR SPACE STATION


               The boys stand at the busstop.

               They say nothing, just stare forward and blink.

               Kyle sighs softly.

               Cartman sniffles. Then --

               SMACK!! The MIR Space Station drops from the sky and crushes 
               Kenny, killing him instantly.

                                     STAN
                         OH MY GOD! They killed Kenny!

                                     KYLE
                         You bastards!!

                                     CARTMAN
                         What the hell is that thing?

                                     KYLE
                         It looks like a UFO!

                                     CARTMAN
                         There's no such thing as UFOs!

               Just then an ambulance pulls up. Two paramedics get out.

               The boys watch as the paramedics place Kenny's crushed body 
               into a plastic body bag.

                                     PARAMEDIC
                         Let's get him to the Morgue.

               They throw Kenny's body in the back, jump in the car and 
               drive away. The boys stand there for several seconds, 
               blinking. Then the school bus pulls up and they shuffle on.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Hey, wait 'till you guys see my 
                         Halloween costume tomorrow! It kicks 
                         ass!

                                     KYLE
                         Dude, it can't be cooler than mine!

                                     STAN
                         Hey, man, we gotta get home and get 
                         our costumes ready!


               Clouds pass in front of the moon behind a creepy building 
               ominously nestled between two large hills and surrounded by 
               a huge graveyard.

               A large black bird swoops down and perches on a large sign 
               which reads: "SOUTH PARK Mortuary". The bird lets out a shrill 
               cry. Then it lets out a poop.


               The Mortician and his Assistant stand by the back door, 
               smoking cigarettes.

                                     MORTICIAN
                         So then the necrophiliac says, if 
                         this ain't a cadaver, then I...

               Kenny leaps onto the Mortician and clamps onto his head like 
               a velociraptor. A short melee ensues as Kenny claws and bites 
               both men and runs away.

                                     ASSISTANT
                              (holding his head)
                         God damn, that little turd bit me!

                                     MORTICIAN
                              (clutching his arm)
                         Me too!


               As CREEPY MUSIC plays, Kenny's zombie silhouette walks down 
               South Park avenue -- clouds drift in front of a bright, half 
               moon.

                                   COMMERCIAL BREAK #1


               Kyle stands alone at the busstop, but we don't recognize 
               him. He is wearing a strange, furry mask.

               Stan walks up dressed as Raggedy Andy.

                                     KYLE
                         Ha ha! You look like a pansy!

                                     STAN
                         Shut up, Kyle!

                                     KYLE
                         What are you supposed to be?

                                     STAN
                         I'm Raggedy Andy.

                                     KYLE
                              (Laughing)
                         Why the hell did you dress up like 
                         Raggedy Andy, dude?!

                                     STAN
                         Wendy's going as Raggedy Anne. And 
                         she said this way we'd win the costume 
                         contest for sure.

                                     KYLE
                         No way, dude. I'm gonna win the 
                         costume contest with this sweet 
                         Chewbacca costume!

                                     STAN
                         Wendy said that first prize is two 
                         tons of candy!

                                     KYLE
                         Wow, Cool!

               Just then Cartman walks up dressed as Hitler.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Hey dudes.

                                     KYLE
                         Cartman... What kind of costume is 
                         that?

                                     CARTMAN
                         It's Adolph Hitler costume. SIEG 
                         HIEL!! SIEG HIEL!!!

                                     STAN
                         Where'd you get that?

                                     CARTMAN
                         My mom made it. Isn't it Cool?

                                     KYLE
                         NO IT'S NOT COOL!

                                     CARTMAN
                         What are you supposed to be, Stan? 
                         Howdy Doody?

                                     STAN
                         No, I'm Raggedy Andy, fat ass!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Oh. Wow, you look pretty cool.

               Long pause... Then Cartman and Kyle laugh loudly.

                                     KYLE
                         Sissy

                                     STAN
                         I'll kick your ass, Kyle!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Oh look out! Holly Hobby is all pissed 
                         off!!

               Kenny walks up. One of his ribs juts out. Dark circles ring 
               his eyes. He looks like a Zombie.

                                     KYLE
                         Hey look, Kenny's not dead.

               Kenny slouches a little more.

                                     STAN
                         You forgot to wear a costume Kenny.

                                     KYLE
                         Yea, what's the matter? Couldn't 
                         your family afford a costume for 
                         you?

                                     STAN
                         Yeah, why is your family so poor, 
                         Kenny.

               Kenny remains silent.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Kenny's family is so poor, that 
                         yesterday they had to put their 
                         cardboard box up for a second 
                         mortgage.

               The boys laugh and wait for a smart ass comeback from Kenny, 
               but Kenny just stands there.

                                     CARTMAN
                              (Agitated)
                         I said your family had to put a 
                         cardboard box up for a second 
                         mortgage!! Kenny!!!

               No response.

                                     CARTMAN
                         I'm talking to you, Kenny! Achtung!! 
                         Poor piece of crap.

               The school bus pulls up.

                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         Come on, we're running late!

                                     STAN
                         Ah, we're ALWAYS running late you 
                         ugly skank.

                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         WHAT DID YOU SAY?

                                     STAN
                         I said I can't wait to own a fishing 
                         tank.

                                     MS. CRABTREE
                         Oh... neither can I.


               Ms. Cartman decorates the exterior of the house with Halloween 
               paraphernalia. It is already covered with plastic pumpkins, 
               skeletons, witches, vampires, graphic scenes from car crashes 
               and photos of mutilated bodies.

               She hums happily as she hangs a photo of President Nixon.

                                     MS. CARTMAN
                         Oh, I'm gonna decorate the house for 
                         Halloween, With scary ghosts and 
                         bats and creepy crawly things.

               Just then the Mortician and his Assistant walk by, looking 
               completely Zombified.

                                     MS. CARTMAN
                         Hello there! Happy Halloween!

                                     MORTICIAN
                         Must... eat... brains... brains...

               Another Townsperson walks past them and bumps into the 
               Mortician.

               The Mortician and his Assistant immediately rip into the 
               Townsperson and gnaw on his head. The Townsperson SCREAMS 
               like a banshee.

               Ms. Cartman continues to decorate, singing to herself happily.

                                     MS. CARTMAN
                              (Singing)
                         It's the most wonderful time of the 
                         year...


               The Mortican Zombie and his Assistant Zombie-walk down the 
               street.

               They come across a pair of Joggers.

                                     JOGGER #1
                         Ooh, looks like they got a touch of 
                         that pink eye that's going around...

               The Zombies attack the joggers. The Joggers SCREAM 
               horrifically.


               Chef walk up to his house with a bag of groceries under his 
               arm. He pulls out his keys, when suddenly --

               BAM!! A townsperson, JOHNSON, throws himself against the 
               door. He is a Zombie.

                                     JOHNSON
                         ARRGGHH!!!

                         AGH!!

               Chef drops his groceries.

                                     CHEF
                         Damn, Johnson, what the hell's gotten 
                         into you?

                                     JOHNSON
                         Piiinnnkkk... eyyeee...

               Johnson lunges at Chef. Chef dodges and unlocks the front 
               door.

                                     CHEF
                         Get the hell out of here, Johnson! I 
                         don't want no God damn pink eye!

               Chef goes inside and slams the door shut.


               Stan and Cartman stand on the sidewalk, ready to trick or 
               treat.

                                     CARTMAN

                         Yeah, granola pisses me off!

               Kenny approaches, looking completely Zombified.

                                     STAN & KYLE
                         Hey Kenny.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Whew! You stink, Kenny!

               The boys consider him for a moment.

                                     KYLE
                         You STILL didn't get a costume, Kenny?

               Kenny doesn't respond.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Too bad drinking scotch isn't a paying 
                         job or else Kenny's dad would be a 
                         millionaire!

               Kenny doesn't respond.

                                     CARTMAN
                         I said YOUR DAD WOULD BE A 
                         MILLIONAIRE!! KENNY!!! Kenny your 
                         family is poor!! Kenny your family's 
                         poor!!!

               No response.

                                     CARTMAN
                              (To Stan)
                         I don't like Kenny anymore. He just 
                         doesn't communicate.

               The boys start to walk away. Just then, Wendy shows up.

                                     WENDY
                         Hi guys.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Hi Wendy.

                                     STAN
                              (Sarcastic)
                         How's your barrel full of candy, 
                         Wendy?

                                     WENDY
                         Oh, I didn't want all that sweet 
                         stuff. I gave it away to hungry 
                         children in Narobi.

                                     CARTMAN
                         YOU WHAT?! ARE YOU INSANE?!

                                     WENDY
                         Let's go trick or treats!

                                     STAN
                         I don't think so, Wendy. I think 
                         you've had enough candy for one day!

                                     WENDY
                         Stan, I'm awful sorry you got dressed 
                         up like Raggedy Andy. Please don't 
                         be mad.

                                     CARTMAN
                         How can he be mad with such pretty 
                         hair and rosy cheeks?

                                     STAN
                         Trick or treat with yourself, Wendy!

                                     WENDY
                         But Stan.

                                     STAN
                         No buts Wendy, I wish you were dead!

               The boys walk away. Wendy looks sad. She stands there alone, 
               when suddenly a shadow looms over her. Wendy turns around 
               and screams.

                                     WENDY
                         AAAGGHHH!!!!


               The boys stand on the front porch. The door opens revealing 
               an older lady.

                                     BOYS
                         Trick or Treat!

               Kenny's other arm falls off.

                                     LADY
                         Oh, how cute!

               The lady takes a handful of candy and starts to put it in 
               Cartman's bag --

               Suddenly, Kenny lashes out and bites the woman's arm almost 
               in half.

                                     LADY
                         AAIIIEEE!!

                                     STAN
                         Dude, Kenny!

               Blood spews everywhere.

                                     LADY
                         OH MY GOD!

               She slams the door shut. From inside we hear hear muffled 
               screams.

                                     LADY (O.S.)
                         CALL 911! CALL 911!! CALL 911! CALL 
                         911!!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Oh nice going, Kenny! She was about 
                         to give us the candy!

                                     STAN
                         Yeah! She had Sweetie Pops!

               Cartman slaps him in the head.

                                     CARTMAN
                         You owe me a Sweetie Pop, asshole!


               The front door opens revealing an obese man.

                                     BOYS
                         Trick or Treat!

               The man holds out some candy.

                                     MAN
                         Hope you kids like chocolate peanut 
                         butter cream puffies --

               Kenny JUMPS onto the man's back and SLASHES at his face.

               The man tries unsuccessfully to pull him off.

                                     MAN
                         AAGH! GET IT OFF!! GET IT OFF ME!!!

               Kenny rides the man as he spins around and COLLAPSES.

               The boys look on with blank expressions.

               Kenny bites into the man's skull and digs into his brains.

                                     CARTMAN
                              (pissed)
                         Dammit! We'll never get any candy if 
                         Kenny keeps eating people!

                                     STAN
                         Yeah! That's it, Kenny! You can't 
                         trick or treat with us anymore!

               The boys leave Kenny eating the man's brains.


               The boys walk down the street. Behind them, several zombies 
               tear down a house, we HEAR screaming coming from inside.


               Kyle rings the doorbell. The door opens to reveal a huge man 
               in a KKK robe. Behind him stand several other Klansmen.

               The Klansmen look down at Cartman in his KKK costume.

                                     KIDS
                         Trick or Treat.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Hey... They're all dressed up like 
                         ghosts too!

               The Klansman throws something into Cartman's pumpkin pail 
               and slams the door.

               Cartman pulls it out and looks at it.

                                     CARTMAN
                         ONE Tootie bar?! You cheap bastards!


               The boys stand at the front door of Chef's house. Stan rings 
               the doorbell.

               ANGLE ON: The boys, as the door opens.

                                     BOYS
                         Trick or --

               The boys SCREAM as they see:

               Chef burst out at them, wielding two chainsaws.

                                     CHEF
                         GET OFF MY PROPERTY YOU BRAIN EATIN' 
                         ZOMBIE BASTARDS!!

                                     BOYS
                         AHHH! CHEF!! NO!!!!

               Chef realizes that the boys look normal.

                                     CHEF
                         Oh, sorry children, I thought you 
                         were one of them!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Can we have candy now, please?

               Chef frowns when he sees Cartman.

                                     CHEF
                         Dammit boy, what the hell are you 
                         doing dressed up like that?

                                     CARTMAN
                         I'm TRYING to trick or treat God 
                         Dammit!!

                                     CHEF
                         Remind me to whup your ass good next 
                         time I see you. Now get in here before 
                         those Zombies get you!


               Chef, clutching the duffel bag, leads the children up the 
               path to the Mortuary.

                                     STAN
                         I don't know about this, Chef.

                                     KYLE
                         Yeah. I'm scared.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Remember candy. Focus on the candy.


               The boys gulp nervously, look at each other, then SCREAM and 
               run away from the Zombies, who give chase.

                                     STAN

               The boys stop at a little payphone. Stan hands Kyle the 
               bottle.

                                     STAN

               Stan and Cartman grab their weapons and head towards the 
               zombies.

               Kyle dials the number and An AUTOMATED VOICE comes on.

                         and gets away with it.

               An EPIC battles rages. Stan and Cartman stand together as 
               the Zombies come at them.

               Cartman cuts off both arms and the head of a Zombie.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Yeah cool!

               Stan cuts off the heads of two Zombies in one fell swoop.

                                     STAN

               We see a MONTAGE of Zombies getting beheaded from all 
               different angles. The chainsaws WHIR hellishly as Cartman 
               and Stan are sprayed with purple blood and bits of gore.

               Cartman slams his chainsaw into the gut of a Zombie and lifts 
               him up off the ground, the chainsaw WHIRRING.

               Stan finishes decapitating another Zombie, then turns to 
               see:

               Zombie Wendy!

                         I know, but... but

                                     CARTMAN
                         Come on, Stan! Remember how she dissed 
                         you at the costume contest!

                                     STAN
                         Hey yeah...

               Wendy slowly advances on Stan.


               Kyle looks out and sees Stan and Cartman killing Zombies 
               left and right.

                                     KYLE
                         Uh... okay. Then what?


               Zombie Wendy continues to advance on Stan.

                                     STAN
                         Wendy! I know we had a fight, and I 
                         did wish that you were dead, but I 
                         didn't mean it!

               Zombie Wendy pauses for a moment, but then continues towards 
               Stan.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Kill her, Stan!!


                                     KYLE
                         Original Zombie? Well, how the hell 
                         do we know who the original Zombie 
                         is?

                                     OPERATOR
                         We realize you have a choice in 
                         Worchestershire sauces. We are 
                         delighted that...

               Kyle hangs up the phone.

                                     KYLE
                         Wait a minute... That thing landed 
                         on Kenny... And they took HIM to the 
                         mortuary...


                                     STAN
                         I... I can't!

               Everyone stops and watches as Kyle runs up with his mule 
               chainsaw. He approaches Kenny and SLAMS the chainsaw down on 
               top of his head.

               He pushes down until the chainsaw gets caught in Kenny's 
               neck. GRUNTING, Chef pushes harder, until the saw goes clear 
               down to Kenny's feet, cutting him in half.

               Immediately Wendy turns back to normal and collapses into 
               Stan's arms.

                                     KYLE
                         Oh my god I killed Kenny! You 
                         bastard!!

                                     WENDY
                              (groggy)
                         Oh. What happened... Stan?

                                     STAN
                         Don't worry, babe. Everything's gonna 
                         be okay.

                                     KYLE
                         It's working! They're turning back 
                         to normal!

               SFX: CHEESY MAGIC-WAND SOUND as the many Zombie corpses all 
               over the place lose their Zombie features and turn into 
               regular corpses.

                                     CHEF
                         You did it, children!

               Everyone cheers.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Okay let's go trick or treating now 
                         come on!

                                     WENDY
                         I'm sorry I dissed you at school 
                         like that, Stan. I guess I just wasn't 
                         very considerate of your feelings.

                                     STAN
                         That's okay, Wendy. I'm sorry I wished 
                         you were dead.

               They smile, gazing into each other's eyes.

                                     WENDY
                         Maybe we could... Actually kiss 
                         tonight Stan...

               They lean forward and are about to kiss when Stan VOMITS on 
               Wendy.

                                     WENDY
                         Eww! Gross Stan, Sick!! Barf is gross.

               Wendy steps through the rotting corpses to run away.

                                   COMMERCIAL BREAK #3


               Stan, Kyle and Cartman, in normal clothes, are standing in 
               front of a tombstone.

                                     STAN
                         Oh, man... I can't believe he's 
                         gone...

               The small grave reads 'Kenny McCormick' and then 'Sleep well, 
               little child, the Lord holds thee now'.

                                     KYLE
                         Yeah... He was too young to be taken 
                         from us!!

                                     STAN
                         Dude, you're the one who cut him in 
                         half with a chainsaw.

               Cartman pulls out a small Kleenex and wipes his eyes.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Let us remember the good times... 
                         Kenny would have wanted it that way.

               Cartman chokes himself up saying this. He really starts to 
               weep. Kyle puts his arm around him.

               All the boys appear to be sobbing. But then, suddenly, Cartman 
               pops out of it.

                                     STAN
                         You know I've really learned something 
                         today... Halloween isn't about 
                         costumes or candy... It's about being 
                         good to one another and giving and 
                         loving.

                                     KYLE
                         No, dude, that's Christmas.

                                     STAN
                         Oh... Then what's Halloween about?

                                     KYLE
                         Costumes and candy.

                                     STAN
                         Oh.

                                     CARTMAN
                              (Suddenly fine)
                         Well, let's get home and start eating 
                         candy.

               The boys smile and start to walk away.

                                     KYLE
                         We can eat it at Cartman's house and 
                         see more naughty pictures of his 
                         mom!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Knock it off, you guys!! She said 
                         she was young and she needed the 
                         money!!

                                     STAN
                              (Off-screen)
                         Cartman! The pictures were taken 
                         like last month!!

                                     CARTMAN
                              (Off-screen)
                         Screw you guys!!

               The boys fully exit frame, and we are left alone in the 
               graveyard.

               The camera TILTS DOWN to Kenny's grave...

               Suddenly a brown gloved hand BURSTS through the ground!!!

               As Horrific MUSIC plays, Kenny slowly pulls himself out of 
               his grave!!!

               Finally, the music reaches a CRESCENDO as Kenny stands above 
               his grave and gives out a muted cry!!

               PULL BACK

               Just then, a large statue from the grave next-door falls on 
               top of Kenny, killing him instantly.

               Music ends, all is silent...

               After a few seconds, a small plane crashes on top of that... 
               As if that were necessary.

                                         THE END
