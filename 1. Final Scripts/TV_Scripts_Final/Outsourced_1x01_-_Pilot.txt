FADE IN:

EXT.  KANSAS CITY - MORNING

We look over the modest skyline of downtown Kansas City.

CUT TO:

INT.  MID AMERICA NOVELTIES - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

The elevator opens and TODD DONOVAN, a young, all-
American guy, exits and starts down the hallway with a 
bounce in his step.  He grins as he passes the familiar 
sign on the wall proclaiming:  Mid America Novelties. 

CUT TO:

INT. MID AMERICA NOVELTIES - CALL CENTER - MOMENTS LATER

TODD enters and is shocked to see the call center is 
empty and partially vandalized.  The only person in the 
office is his boss, JERRY, who is happily working, even 
humming to himself.  He spots Todd and stands.

JERRY THE BOSS
Todd!  You re back!  How was the 
management training?

TODD
Where is everyone?  What happened?

JERRY THE BOSS
Oh, we did a little right-sizing.  
Costs were through the roof.  
Pensions.  Health care.  We had to 
make some cuts, but now we re the 
right size to move ahead.

TODD

JERRY THE BOSS
Exactly.  Yesterday we outsourced 
the call center to India.

TODD
India?

JERRY THE BOSS
This is a great move for us, Todd. 
Things are really looking up for 
the company. 2.

A brick, thrown from outside, flies through the window, 
lands, and rolls towards them.  Todd sees a note is 
attached so he picks up the brick to read the note.

TODD
(reading)
Bastard--   You

JERRY THE BOSS
(chuckling)
me. for that s Oh,

Jerry takes the brick and tosses it onto a pile of other 
bricks which have previously been thrown into the office.

TODD
Jerry, I was supposed to run the 
call center.

JERRY THE BOSS
I know--

TODD
I went through training 
specifically to run the call 
center.

JERRY THE BOSS
I know, I know, but listen, you re 
our best salesman.  We re not 
gonna lose you.  We still want you 
to run the call center.  In India.

Jerry gives him two thumbs up.

TODD
You want me to go to India?

JERRY THE BOSS
They don t get our culture.  We 
need an American in charge.

TODD
But I ve never been out of the 
country before.

JERRY THE BOSS
This is a killer opportunity for 
you, Todd.  They told me, if you 
get this right--

Another brick flies in the room and lands closer to them.

TODD
Should we step back a little?3.

JERRY THE BOSS
Good idea.

They step back and continue.

JERRY THE BOSS (CONT D)
They said, if you get this right, 
they ll bump you up to senior 
management.  Todd Donovan, Vice 
President of Sales.  Huh?  How 
does that sound?

TODD
Vice president...  Someday these 
bricks will be for me.

JERRY THE BOSS
spirit! the That s

TODD
But I ve spent my whole life in 
Kansas City.  I d be leaving 
everything behind.

JERRY THE BOSS
You re twenty-five.  What s your 
life?  Some drinking buddies?  An 
 X-Box  in a shared apartment?  A 
girlfriend you only see on the 
weekends?

TODD
Hey, I got a lot more going on 
than that.
(thinks about his 
life, then)
I guess I could take the  X-Box  
with me.

JERRY THE BOSS
There you go!

TODD
I mean, this is the time of my 
life when I should be up for 
adventure.

JERRY THE BOSS
Exactly!

TODD
Things happen for a reason, right?

JERRY THE BOSS
Yes they do!4.

TODD
My Dad always said, when a door 
closes, God opens a window.

JERRY THE BOSS
And this window opens onto sunny 
India!

Jerry, in a lame attempt at Bollywood style dancing, 
twists his arms as if he were putting in light bulbs.

JEREMY
(singing)
 BING BING BING BING BING BING. 

TODD
You know what?  I m in--

JERRY THE BOSS
Excellent.

TODD
--Assuming we agree on terms.

JERRY THE BOSS
Excuse me?

TODD
If I do this for the company, I 
need a written contract that 
spells out my promotion, my 
salary, everything I get when I 
come back.

JERRY THE BOSS
Todd, you know I can t do that.  
You re gonna have to trust the 
company s word on this.

Todd looks around at all the empty desks.

TODD
Yeah, that s not gonna happen.  I 
need it in writing.

Todd picks up a piece of paper and holds it out to Jerry.  
it. take won t He

JERRY THE BOSS
Sorry.  It s against policy.  My 
hands are tied.

TODD
Are you sure you can t do this for 
me?  
(MORE)5.

TODD (CONT'D)
Because I m guessing if I don t go 
to India, they ll need someone 
else to go.  And the only person 
with experience running a call 
center is you. 

Jerry tries to keep a blank expression.  Todd stares back 
at him.  Finally, Jerry gives in, grabs the paper, and 
sits down to write out Todd s contract.

JERRY THE BOSS
Looks like that management 
training helped you grow a pair.

TODD
It was great.  We spent a whole 
day on standoffs.  The trick is to 
make the other guy feel good about 
giving in.  But I don t have to do 
that with you.  You re doing such 
an amazing job without my help. 
(over his shoulder)
So, corner office, company car, 
stock options...
(then, feigning awe)
Is that your natural penmanship?  
beautiful. It s

JERRY THE BOSS
Thank you.

TODD
Executive assistant, expense 
account...

As Jerry writes, we:

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  INDIA - CITY STREET - DUSK

Todd is riding in an auto-rickshaw taxi with RAJIIV, the 
assistant manager.  They both have mango-lassis, but 
  traffic. go and stop the of because them drink can t
Todd is going over how he wants the office to run.

TODD
...It s also really important how 
we deal with setbacks.  This is 
the way I see it: all obstacles 
are opportunities in disguise.

RAJIIV
Then you have come to the right 
place.  This is the land of 
opportunities.6.

Rajiiv gestures out to the overwhelming chaos that is the 
Indian street.  Todd, not sure if Rajiiv is being ironic, 
glances outside.  The taxi abruptly stops and BEGGARS 
approach.  Todd turns and sees a SADHU (an old man 
wearing only a loin cloth) just outside the window, 
extending his hand to Todd.

TODD
(turning away)
Okay, thanks for that visual.
(then)
You know, I d give him money if he 
promised to buy a robe.

RAJIIV
Actually, he is a Sadhu.

TODD
A what?

RAJIIV
A Sadhu, a self-professed holy 
man.  They give up all material 
possessions and wander the earth 
living on the handouts of 
strangers.  Do you have Sadhus in 
America?

TODD
Yeah.  We call them homeless.

The taxi lurches forward again.

RAJIIV
Oh, before we arrive, I took the 
liberty of having name tags made.

 CALL AMERICA  MID labeled tags name two out takes Rajiiv
CENTER.   Printed below is their name and title.  

TODD
Look at that.   TODD DONOVAN: 
MANAGER.   Thank you, Rajiiv.  
Thank you very much.

RAJIIV
My pleasure, sir.

Todd notices that Rajiiv s tag reads  RAJIIV GIDWANI: 
MANAGER. 

TODD
Yours says manager too.7.

RAJIIV
(laughing)
You are most perceptive.  I can 
see that I will not be pulling the 
wool over your eyes, unless you 
are very cold and ask me to.

TODD
Why does yours say manager too?

RAJIIV
I am simply planning ahead.  You 
see, after you return to America, 
I will become the manager of the 
call center.  I thought to myself, 
why print a name-tag which says 
 Assistant Manager  when it is 
only a matter of time before you 
triumph here and make a glorious 
homecoming.

TODD
You got it all planned out, huh?

RAJIIV
Indeed, I do.  When I become 
manager, my salary will increase 
enough so that I will be able to 
move out of my parents  house and 
finally marry Vimi.

TODD
Wait.  You still live with your 
parents?

RAJIIV
This is not America.  We do not 
all have deluxe apartments in the 
sky.

TODD
No way.  You get  The Jeffersons  
over here? 
(half singing)
 WELL WE RE MOVING ON UP, TO THE 
SKY.  TO A DELUXE APARTMENT...
(with less commitment 
 look Rajiiv s to due
of confusion)
...in the sky-aye-aye.   Never 
mind.

RAJIIV
Things are different here.  
Children live with their parents 
until they marry.  
(MORE)8.

RAJIIV (CONT'D)
And I cannot marry Vimi until I am 
a manager.  Her family is most 
prestigious.

TODD
Let me get this straight; you 
can t move out of your parents  
house or get married until I get 
promoted back to America?

RAJIIV
It seems our fates are tied, sir.  
Your triumphs are my triumphs.  
Your victories are my victories.
(then)
We need a victory!

Rajiiv meant this to be inspirational, but it came off as 
desperation.  Rajiiv and Todd look away and try to sip 
their lassi drinks.  The taxi abruptly comes to a stop 
again and beggars approach.  Todd turns to see a Sadhu 
just outside the window holding out his hand.

TODD
Is that the same guy?

RAJIIV
Sir, it would be offensive to 
imply that all Indians looked 
alike simply because we-- 
(realizing)
Oh no, that s the same guy.  He s 
fast.

CUT TO:

INT.  CALL CENTER/BULLPEN - LATER THAT EVENING

The WORKERS are chatting amongst themselves in English.  
MANMEET, a young, sweet guy (and would-be Lothario) is 
 by approached he s when cubicles the through crossing
GUPTA, a heavyset man with sad, needy eyes.  Gupta s the 
kind of guy you avoid at a party. 

GUPTA
Did you read the paper?

MANMEET
No.

Manmeet tries to walk away, but Gupta pursues.

GUPTA
There was a fascinating article 
about humming birds.  They re not 
as nice as they seem.9.

Manmeet, trailed by Gupta, crosses by ASHA and MIDORI and 
we stay with them.  Asha is a smart, confident and 
striking woman.  Midori, on the other hand, is a 
wallflower who suffers from extreme shyness.  We catch 
them mid-conversation as Asha tries to calm Midori while 
they flip through a Mid-America novelty catalogue.

ASHA
...I wouldn t worry about it.  The 
products may be different, but the 
work is the same.

Midori is embarrassed to reveal:

MIDORI
But I ve never worked at a call 
center before.

ASHA
Oh, okay.  Well, sit next to me.  
I ll show you how it s done.  
You ll be fine.  You d be 
surprised, Americans are not that 
different from us.

Asha flips the page and they see the novelties for sale 
include an American flag Snuggie, a wallet made from 
 between is slot coin the where  fanny-bank  a and bacon,
the buttocks.  Asha and Midori look up at each other.

ASHA (CONT D)
Maybe they re a little different.

Todd and Rajiiv enter.  Rajiiv claps at the workers and 
shouts.

RAJIIV
Come now!  You are paid to work, 
not to sit around doing chit-chat!
(suddenly polite)
It is my great pleasure to 
introduce Mr. Todd Donovan.

hair bound up in a turban) named AJEET quickly stands.

of paper)

to memorize this, so here goes...

Todd glances at the paper, then speaks in mangled Hindi.

TODD (CONT D)
(IN SUBTITLES)
Welcome office success donkey 
today!

No one knows what to say.  Rajiiv starts to applaud and 
scowls at the workers until they join in applauding. 

TODD (CONT D)
Oh no, not necessary.  Thanks.
(aside to Rajiiv)
That wasn t really an applause 
moment.

RAJIIV
You underestimate your charisma.  
Such a light within you.

Todd steps forward and greets the employees one by one 
until he comes to Midori, who is so shy she avoids his 
eye as she shakes his hand.

TODD
Hello.  You are...?

MIDORI
(almost inaudible)
Midori.

TODD
Excuse me?

MIDORI

She works the phones?  Really?

Todd comes to Manmeet who extends his hand.

MANMEET
Hello, I am Manmeet.

TODD
Man-meat?

MANMEET
Yes, Manmeet.

TODD
You re name is Man-meat?  Wow.  
That doesn t leave a lot of room 
for a crazy nickname.  What do the 
ladies call you?  Steve.
(chuckles, then off 
his blank look)
See  cause normally your name 
would be Steve, and then Manmeet--  
Okay, we ll talk later.

Todd steps away and reaches Asha.

ASHA
Asha. I m Hello,

TODD
Nice to meet you, Asha.  That s a 
pretty name.

ASHA
Thank you.  It means  hope. 

TODD
Really?  In that case, I  Asha  to

ASHA
Yes, I understand.

Asha smiles but looks away, a little uncomfortable with

everyone is watching.  He calls out: 

TODD
Okay, I will meet the rest of you 
throughout the day.  Now, the 
phones are switching over later 
tonight.  We ve been down for two 
days so there s going to be a lot 
of pent up demand for novelties.  
I want everyone ready.  I don t 
know what religion you are, but 
this is your new bible.

Todd holds up the catalogue, the cover of which features 
an array of novelties from a beer drinking helmet (with 
the beer cans mounted on the side,) to a battery powered 
leg. your humps which Dog   Dirty called animal stuffed

I ll let you know when.

The employees take a copy of the catalogue to study it.

RAJIIV
Now, if I may, I would like to 
show you to our offices in the 
executive suite.  Please follow 
me.

Rajiiv leads Todd up three steps and stops.

Out of respect for your seniority, 
I have given you the cubicle with

Rajiiv gestures to a nearby window.  At the moment, there 
is a giant cow outside looking in the window.

TODD
You ve got to be kidding me.

RAJIIV
Sir?

TODD
There s a cow outside the window.

RAJIIV
Yes, the cow is considered sacred.  
It can go where it pleases.

TODD
Really?  Well, maybe that s a good 
thing.  We won t have to go far 
for creamer.

Todd laughs and mimes reaching out the window to milk the 
cow directly into a coffee mug.  Rajiiv does not laugh.

RAJIIV
Please do not touch the cow.

TODD
Of course not.

RAJIIV
I know this must be difficult for 
Americans to understand, since you 
eat hamburgers morning, noon, and 
night--

TODD
Not really true.

RAJIIV

TODD
Seems exaggerated.

RAJIIV

--But for Hindus, a cow is not a 
source of meat.

RAJIIV (CONT'D)
It is sacred because of the milk 
it gives, the prosperity it 
represents.  Muslims and Jews do 
not eat pigs, we do not eat cows.  
Is it so crazy--

TODD
Rajiiv, Rajiiv, I get it.  It s a 
holy thing.  The cow is not a 
source of meat.  I totally get it.  
It s your country.  I m gonna

TODD (CONT D)
So, what time is lunch?

CUT TO:

EXT.  COMMISSARY - NIGHT

A large commissary is filled with CALL CENTER EMPLOYEES 
sitting at several tables.  Todd, with a tray, is making 
his way down the food line.  Following him on the other 
side of the counter is an Indian LUNCH-MAN.  As Todd eyes 
a particular food, the Lunch-Man dips in his ladle.  When 
Todd changes his mind and moves on, the Lunch-Man removes 
the ladle and moves on as well.

TODD
(mumbling to himself)
Don t know what that is.
(then)
Don t know what that is.
(then)
A little scared of that.
(up to the Lunch-Man)
Soupy.  Everything s soupy.
 Lunch-Man s the (off
blank expression)
Okay.  You know what?  I m gonna 
be in India a while.  I don t know 
what s what but I gotta learn 
somehow, right?  So, just give me 
some of...that.

Todd points at a tray of soupy food and the Lunch-Man 
starts to ladle it onto Todd s plate.

LUNCH-MAN
(in Hindi)
Mirchi ka salan.15.

TODD
Oh yeah, of course.  My Mom used 
to make the best mirchi ka sa-
lamalama-dingdong.

Todd chuckles.  The Lunch-man just stares back at him.  
Todd steps away to find a seat.  As he walks among the 
tables, Todd faces the high school cafeteria dilemma of 
where to sit.  He comes upon a table of his employees.  
(They are chatting in English except for Midori, who 
studies the catalogue as she eats.)  There is an empty 
seat among them.  Their conversation stops and they look 
at Todd, neither inviting him nor shunning him, just

TODD
So?

CHARLIE

TODD

his sandwich.

CHARLIE

grape jelly.  And check this out:

Cheetos, Dill pickles, a Hostess 
cupcake, and my back-up sandwich, 
Honey-Glazed ham and good old 
American cheese.  As far as I m 
concerned, you re not a world 
power until you have a cheese 
named after your country.17.

TODD
So, the superpowers are us, the 
Swiss, and...?

CHARLIE
I m not into politics, okay?

TODD
Okay.  Where did you buy all this 
stuff?

CHARLIE
I have it shipped from home.  If 
I m gonna be sentenced to this 
sweat-box of a country, I ll be 
damned if I m eating their Mickey-
Mouse food.

They eat for a beat.  Todd glances over at his employees.

TODD
Hey, can I ask something about my 
workers?

CHARLIE
Shoot.

TODD
My budget isn t that big, but 
still, my guys don t exactly seem 
like the cream of the crop.

Charlie looks over Todd s employees.

CHARLIE
Yeah, they probably don t know 
squat about America.  Probably 
never been outside the city.  
Looks like you got the  B  team, 
my friend.

TODD
How can you tell?

CHARLIE
Because that s the  A  team over 
there.

Charlie indicates a group of sharply dressed Indians 
sitting down to lunch.

(CONT D) CHARLIE
Those guys work for Intell s call 
center.  They ve all been to 
America.  They ve even studied all 
our different accents.18.

TODD
No way.

An  A  team Indian crosses by to purchase a drink.

CHARLIE
Hey, you.

INDIAN TEAM  A 
(with his usual 
Indian accent)
Yes, what is it?

CHARLIE
Tell me something.  Do you know 
what grits are?

INDIAN TEAM  A 
(in a perfect 
southern accent)
Well, grits is just ground up 
corn.  I tell you what, my Momma 
used to make the best grits.

CHARLIE
Alright.

southern accent)
I d be settin  on the porch with 
my hound dog  Freedom --

CHARLIE
Alright, enough.

It s creepy, isn t it?  Like 
they re pod people or something.

TONYA, an athletic, statuesque blonde, enters.  Todd 
 commissary the down moves she as watch but help can t

(CONT D) CHARLIE
Yeah, that s Tonya.  She runs the 
Quantas call center.  That s some

TODD
She s...

CHARLIE
I m with you on that, my friend.  
They got that accent and they re 
all so big and outdoorsy; God I 
love Australian women!19.

Tonya turns to find a place to sit.  She notices Todd 
staring at her and he turns away.

TODD

CHARLIE
Don t waste your time, man.  I ve 
seen her here for eight months and

TODD

TONYA
Sorry, that s Aussie for out in 
the middle of nowhere.  I think 
you Yanks say out in the sticks.

TODD
I like woop woop better.  It s fun 
to say.  Woop woop.

TONYA
Right.  Cheers.

Tonya smiles and walks away to sit with her workers.  
Charlie has watched this exchange and is speechless and 
dying inside.  When Todd turns back from watching Tonya 
walk away, he notices Asha looking at him.  Evidently, 
she watched Todd and Tonya speaking.  But before Todd can 
get a read on Asha s expression, she looks away.

CUT TO:20.

INT.  CALL CENTER HALLWAY/OFFICE - LATER

Todd is heading back to the call center bullpen when he 
passes an open office and sees Ajeet (aka The Big Sikh) 
with his feet up on the desk, eating pakoras and watching 
TV.  Ajeet, about to pop a pakora in his mouth, sees Todd 
out of the corner of his eye and covertly nudges the door 
with his foot.  Todd has just enough time to register how 
nice this office is compared to his cubicle before the 
door shuts.  

CUT TO:

INT.  CALL CENTER/BULLPEN - MOMENTS LATER

Todd cuts through the bullpen on his way to his office.  
 a opening she s as just cubicle her in Asha passes He
wrapped present which turns out to be a picture of a man 
in a suit.  Todd stops to say hello, surprising Asha.

TODD
Hey, what you got there?

ASHA
My fiance sent me a picture of 
himself.

TODD
Oh, your fiance.  What s his name?

ASHA
(momentarily drawing 
a blank)
...uh.

TODD
Don t tell me Indian names are 
hard for you too?

Todd laughs, and Asha recovers.

ASHA
Pradeep.  His name is Pradeep 
Puri.  I couldn t think for a 
second.

TODD
Where d you guys meet?

ASHA

TODD
Really?  Then how...  We re gonna 
be starting so...21.

ASHA
Of course.

Todd crosses away.  Asha puts the picture on her desk and 
considers her fiance.  Then she grabs the picture again, 
puts it in her desk drawer, and closes the drawer.

CUT TO:

INT.  CALL CENTER/KITCHEN-BREAK ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Todd enters and sees Manmeet getting a cup of tea.  Todd 
nods hello.  He opens the pantry and is checking out the 
snacks when he hears:

MANMEET
(under his breath)
Oh no, please don t come in here.

 the entering Gupta sees and gaze Manmeet s follows Todd
bullpen, looking around for someone to talk to.

TODD
What s the matter with him?

MANMEET
He won t stop talking.  Believe 
me, you don t want to get stuck 
with Gupta.

TODD
Yeah, we had a guy like that back 
in my old office.  Ed Millner.  
He d never shut up.  If you got 
stuck with him in the break room, 
forget it.  You couldn t shake 
him.

Todd and Manmeet look up to see that Gupta is approaching 
the kitchen.  In a matter of seconds, he will round the 
corner and see them.  Manmeet turns to Todd.

MANMEET
So how did you handle it?

CUT TO:

MOMENTS LATER:

Gupta rounds the corner and enters the kitchen.  No one 
is there.  Gupta looks around, surprised.  He could have

need to explain:22.

TODD
Back home, we had a bigger pantry.

Manmeet nods that he understands.  They watch Gupta 
through the crack between the doors.  Unfortunately for 
them, Gupta lingers, sipping his tea, just waiting for 
someone to talk to.  Now they can t leave because it 
would be obvious they were hiding in the pantry.  After a 
beat, Manmeet turns to Todd:

MANMEET
Do you know any redheads?

TODD
Excuse me?

MANMEET
I m looking for a wife.  I like 
redheads.  And blondes.  Dark hair 
too.

TODD
So, all women?

MANMEET
(sheepishly 
conceding)
Yes, all of them.

TODD
Well, actually, my ex-girlfriend 
was kind of a redhead--

MANMEET
Ex-girlfriend?  Did she say  no? 

TODD
Not usually.  Wait, say  no  to 
what?

MANMEET
When you asked her to marry you?

TODD
Oh, I didn t ask her to marry me.  
We were just dating.

MANMEET
Dating until you get married, yes?

TODD
No, you see, Manmeet -- gotta get 
used to saying that -- things are 
different in America.  You date 
someone for a while before you 
decide if you want to get married.  
(MORE)23.

TODD (CONT'D)
And some people aren t looking to 
get married anyway.  It s called 
serial monogamy.  You date a 
woman, if it doesn t work out, you 
date another woman, and then 
another woman, and so on.
 Manmeet s (off
incredulity)
Okay, I realize that sounds kind 
of meaningless--

MANMEET
(joyously)
It sounds wonderful.

Todd can t help but smile at Manmeet s glee.  Then, 
through the crack between the doors, they see Midori

GUPTA
Did you read the paper today?

MIDORI
No.

Midori turns and exits, but it s too late.  Gupta 
follows, talking over her shoulder as he follows her.

GUPTA
They discovered a vegetarian 
spider, first one in nature.  I 
believe it was in Costa Rica... 

Todd and Manmeet emerge from the pantry and watch Gupta 
trailing Midori through the office.

TODD
May God have mercy on her soul.

Manmeet nods.

INT.  CALL CENTER/BULLPEN - MINUTES LATER

Todd and Rajiiv enter carrying a box of novelties.  (In 
the background, Gupta is still talking to Midori who is 
miserable.)

TODD
Okay, everyone--

Rajiiv interrupts by clapping at the employees.24.

RAJIIV
Stop what you re doing!  It s time 
to work!
(politely, to Todd)
You have the floor.

TODD
Time for a little pop quiz.  
You ve had all morning to study 
the catalogue, now let s see how 
good you are at  add-ons. 
(off their looks)
You know what  add-ons  are, 
right?  Someone calls to buy a 
product, and you suggest another 
related product for them to buy as 
an  add-on. 
(then)
Okay, let s say someone orders a 
finger. #1   we re

Todd takes a giant foam hand from the box which extends 
one finger as if to say,  we re #1. 

TODD (CONT D)
Now, what would you suggest as an 
 add-on? 
(off their silence)
I ll give you a hint.  Notice the 
finger is green and gold, huh?  
Green Bay Packer s colors.
(then)
Oh come on.
(pulling a cheese 
head from the box)
A cheese head!  This is basic.

RAJIIV
What is a cheese head?

TODD
You put this on when you root for 
the Packers.

Todd puts on the cheese head.  The employees just stare 
at him.

TODD (CONT D)
Are any of you taking this job 
seriously?

Asha inadvertently chuckles at this sight but quickly 
covers her mouth and turns away.  Todd takes off the hat.25.

TODD (CONT D)
Guys, we have to be ready.  The 
phones have switched over.  We re 
live.  There are 300 million 
Americans who could be calling in 
for a novelty any minute now.

Todd gestures to the silent phones.

TODD (CONT D)
...You never know when someone s 
gonna need a novelty.

ASHA
Sir?

TODD
Todd.

ASHA
Todd.  I think the problem we re 
having is that even if we memorize 
the catalogue, what we are 
memorizing makes no sense to us.

TODD
What do you mean, it doesn t make 
sense?

ASHA
(off the catalogue)
Well, for example, here is this 
mistletoe novelty.  Even if I 
memorize the order number, that 
won t help me because I don t know 
what a mistletoe is.

TODD
Okay.  Mistletoe is something you 
put up at a Christmas party--

MANMEET
What is a Christmas party?

TODD
What s a Christmas party?  Really?  
Oh, man.  Okay, a Christmas party 
is a party to celebrate the birth 
of Jesus, who was the son of God.

RAJIIV
Which God?26.

TODD
Which God?  The God, the real one.
(noticing a reaction 
and moving on)
Anyway, mistletoe is like a shrub 
and you hang it in a door way and 
wait till a hot woman comes along.  
I m talking a woman who s out of 
your league, she d never even talk 
to you, but you surprise her by 
standing next to her under the 
mistletoe, and it s awkward, but 
she has to kiss you.  By law.

Confused, Asha holds up the catalogue and indicates the 
product that prompted her original question.

ASHA
Then what is this?

Todd leans in.  INSERT CLOSE UP of a mistletoe belt-
buckle, a novelty belt buckle with a small mistletoe 
branch extending from the top of the buckle.

TODD
That s...that s actually pretty 
clever.  You re supposed to kiss 
under the mistletoe.  So, if you 
wore that, someone would have to 
kiss you...down there.

ASHA
This is how you celebrate the 
birthday of the son of God?

TODD
See, the thing is, Americans can 
be holy, and have fun at the same 
time.  Next question.

MANMEET
Why do Americans need these 
things?

TODD
don t. We

ASHA
Then what is the purpose?

TODD
The purpose?  There is no purpose.  
There doesn t have to be a purpose 
in America.  You can do what you 
want.  That s what s so great 
about my country.  
(MORE)27.

TODD (CONT'D)
You have the freedom to pursue 
your dream, whatever it is.  You 
can be president, or a scientist, 
or you can invent novelties 
like...

Todd reaches in the box and pulls out a novelty, but he 
instantly regrets his choice.  The novelty is a small 
model of a woman s torso in a red dress.

MANMEET
What is that?

TODD
(committing to it)
This is exactly what I m talking 
about.  Maybe no one needs this, 
but in America, no one can stop 
you from making it.  This is the 
definition of freedom.  This is 
 jingle jugs. 

Todd presses a button on the back.  As the torso plays 
 Jingle Bells,  the breasts swing in different

a headset to hear the caller and fumbles to turn off the 
 jingle jugs. 

MANMEET
Thank you for calling Mid America 
Novelty.  How can I help you?

AMERICAN CALLER (V.O.)
Yeah, I want that mug on page six.

MANMEET
Of course.  Can I please have the 
order number?

Manmeet looks to Todd who nods,  So far, so good. 

AMERICAN CALLER (V.O.)
Uh, let s see.  It s uh...256-KPR.

MANMEET
That s 256,  K  as in Krishna,  P  
and in Punjabi,  R  as in 
Ramayana.

Todd grimaces.

AMERICAN CALLER (V.O.)
Rama-what?  Where am I calling?  
Is this India?28.

MANMEET
...No.

AMERICAN CALLER (V.O.)
Am I calling freakin  India to 
order a mug that says  America s 
#1?! 

MANMEET
(off a cheat-sheet)
No, we are in Detroit, city of 
motors and black people.

The Caller hangs up.  Todd, frustrated, turns to Rajiiv.

TODD
Are you sure these are the best 
workers you could find?

RAJIIV
Sir, are you suggesting I hired 
lesser employees to make you look 
bad?

TODD
No, of course not.  Why would you 
do that?  As you said, our fates 
our tied.  If I can t make this 
office work, they ll get rid of 
me.
(realizing, eyeing 
Rajiiv suspiciously)
In which case, they ll need a new 
manager.

RAJIIV
Perhaps they ll try a local.

TODD
Rajiiv, I thought you were on my 
side.  I thought  My success is 
your success. 

RAJIIV
It is.  But also, your failure is 
my success.  Either way, I m 
rooting for you.

Rajiiv steps away.  As Todd looks out and considers his 
employees, we...

Midori nods that she understands.  Just then, through the 
crack between the doors, they see Asha enter the kitchen.  
She spots Gupta and grimaces to herself.  Gupta perks up.  

GUPTA
Asha, did--

ASHA
(crossing to the 
pantry)
Yes, Gupta I read the paper.  But 
I m getting a migraine so I m 
sorry but I need absolute quiet.  
Perhaps we can talk later.

GUPTA
(sotto)
Oh, okay.  Perhaps later.

Asha opens the pantry door and sees Todd, Manmeet, and 
Midori.  30.

(The pantry door opens out so Gupta is unable to see past 
the door into the pantry.)  Todd shakes his head as if to 
say,  please don t give us up.    Asha considers them, 
then shuts the door.

ASHA
Actually, Gupta, I m feeling 
better, why don t we chat at my 
desk.

GUPTA
Really?!

Asha leads Gupta out, back into the bullpen.

ASHA
Yes.  Did you read that story 
about the tiger who attacked the 
farmers?
(loud enough for 
Todd/Manmeet/Midori 
to hear)
One farmer threw herself at the 
tiger, sacrificing herself so that 
her three co-workers could live.  
They really owed her after that.

GUPTA
(as they exit)
I missed that one.  Did you read 
about the inchworms that are both 
male and female?

ASHA
No.

Please tell me about it.

Asha exits with Gupta.  Another EMPLOYEE enters to make a

explanation, pass her and exit.

Rajiiv gestures to Midori who, at that moment, is trying 
on a novelty baseball cap with a built in mullet wig.

(CONT D) RAJIIV

the others into working harder.

TODD
I don t want to fire someone just 
to make a point.

RAJIIV

She is a lower caste.

MANMEET
It is a farting garden gnome.32.

Okay, here s the deal.  Asha was 
right.  Even if you guys memorize

they are bears, who, when they 
come to town, it is very bad news 
indeed.

head in frustration)
...Because they are bears.
(turning to the 
others for support)
Who wants a bear in your village?

TODD
It was a movie about a baseball 
team with a bunch of losers--

ASHA
Are we the losers in this story?

TODD
Yes, well, no, because my point 
is, everyone thought they were 
losers, until they proved people 
wrong.

ASHA
Who are we proving wrong?

TODD
Just people.
(sneaking a glance at 
Rajiiv)
So by the end of the month, I want 
everyone selling ten add-ons a 
day.  By the end of this week, 
five a day.  And by the end of 
today, I want everyone, and I mean 
everyone, to sell one add-on.

Midori looks around, nervous.35.

RAJIIV
Or what?

TODD
There is no  Or What,  because I 
believe you re gonna do it. 
Look, this is my first time as a 
manager.  Some guys might be 
scared to tell you that, but I m 
not because I believe in myself.  
Sales is about confidence.  Do you 
believe in yourself?

MANMEET

Todd walks the floor with a headset and a switcher that

Todd is pacing the floor.  At the moment, no one is on a 
call, all the employees are waiting.  Then a phone rings.

TODD

answer)
Wait, who hasn t sold an add-on 
yet?

All the employees turn to look at Midori.  She almost 
wilts under the scrutiny.  Todd gestures at the ringing 
phone until Midori answers it.

MIDORI

CALLER (V.O.)
Yeah, my roommate s getting on my 
nerves.  I wanna freak him out.  

MIDORI

catalogue)
In that case, could I also 
interest you in our fake vomit on 
page 23, lower left hand of the

CALLER (V.O.)
This vomit, does it look real?

MIDORI
Well, it makes me sick to look at 
it.

CALLER (V.O.)
Yeah, alright, I ll get the vomit 
too.

TODD

headset, to the

Okay, that s everyone.

The others (except for Rajiiv) applaud for Midori and she 
beams shyly...until she hears the caller in her ear:

CALLER (V.O.)
Why are people clapping?

TODD
(sotto to Midori)
Get the credit card info.

MIDORI
Oh.

As Midori rejoins the call to get the credit card 
information, Todd sidles up to Rajiiv for an aside.

TODD
You were hoping I would succeed or 
fail, but there s one outcome you 
didn t anticipate: my modest but 
slowly improving just okay-ness.
