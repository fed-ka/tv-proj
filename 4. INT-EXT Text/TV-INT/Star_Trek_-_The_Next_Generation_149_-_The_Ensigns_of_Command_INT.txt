     CREWMEMBERS. A VULCAN and ONE WOMAN are seated, 
     holding their instruments -- a violin and a viola. 
     O'BRIEN tunes his cello. DATA ENTERS carrying a 
     violin. He checks at the door, startled to see the 
     captain. Picard beckons, and Data crosses to him. 
 
         DATA 
       Captain, Doctor, I am honored by 
       your presence, but may I suggest 
       you attend the second concert. 
 
         BEVERLY 
       Why, Data? 
 
         DATA 
       Ensign Ortiz will perform the 
       violin part. My rendition will 
       be less enjoyable. 
 
         PICARD 
       Oh? 
 
         DATA 
       While I am quite proficient 
       Technically, according to my 
       fellow performers, I lack soul. 
 
         BEVERLY 
       Data, telling us why you're going 
       to fail before you make the 
       attempt is never wise. 
 
         DATA 
       But is not honesty always the

       Indeed? 
 
         PICARD 
       Knowing your limitations is one 
       thing. Advertising them to a crew 
       can damage your ability to lead. 
 
         DATA 
       Because you lose their respect?

       No, because you may begin to

       yourself.

     the other performers.

       Federation creatures, there are 
       humans on the fifth planet of Tau

         RIKER 
       To the Sheliak, humans are a lower

       the intruders. 
 
     Beverly is taken aback. Riker's dead serious.

         GOSHEVEN (O.S.)

     Gosheven fills the doorway. He ENTERS and looks 
     around the room.

       I'm disappointed. I thought we 
       had settled this.

       Since when is talk trouble? 
 
     Gosheven ignores her -- looking only at Data. 
 
         GOSHEVEN 
       It's over. Don't you get it? 
       You had your say, and you lost. 
 
         DATA 
       I appear to be reversing that 
       defeat. 
 
         GOSHEVEN 
       No, you're not -- you're just 
       stubborn. 
        (getting closer) 
       Well, let me tell you something... 
 
     Gosheven touches Data with an electronic prod -- BLUE 
     SPARKS dance over Data. Data's whole body stiffens 
     -- then goes limp and falls. 
 
         GOSHEVEN 
        (completes his thought) 
       ... so am I. 
 
         ARD'RIAN 
       Damn you, Gosheven -- 
 
     Ard'rian rushes to Data's aid. 
 
         HARITATH 
       You killed him? 
 
         GOSHEVEN 
       I've killed no one. 
        (to Ard'rian) 
       I've merely shut down a machine. 
 
     Ard'rian looks daggers at Gosheven, who turns his 
     attention to the gathering. 
 
         GOSHEVEN (cont'd) 
       That's it, everyone. Time to 
       go home. 
 
     The momentum has changed. A few sheepish glances as 
     one or two of the group head for the door.

     Picard and Troi MATERIALIZE. What surrounds them bears 
     little resemblance to a ship. Darkness hangs like bats 
     in the corners. What little light there is filters 
     through swirling mist. As they look down the effect is 
     as if they are walking on black ice, and tiny lights, 
     like flickering eyes twinkle beneath the floor's 
     surface. 
 
         SHELIAK 
       Advance and speak. 
 
     Troi and Picard exchange glances for they can see no 
     sign of the creature they are speaking with. They step 
     forward, and are pinned in a bright light. 
 
         PICARD 
       Director, we will comply with your 
       request to remove the colony on 
       Tau Cygna Five, but we need time. 
 
         SHELIAK 
       The given time has elapsed. We 
       carry the membership and we will

     Picard and Troi APPEAR. Riker, Worf, and the

     Ard'rian worriedly inspects the unmoving Data with an 
     electronic scanner. Data twitches, "reboots," comes 
     back to life, and sits up. Ard'rian SIGHS, relieved. 
 
         ARD'RIAN 
       I was afraid your neural pathways 
       were scrambled beyond repair. 
 
         DATA 
       I am equipped with diagnostic 
       circuits and can correct many 
       malfunctions. 
 
     Data moves his head, arms, and legs, testing his 
     responses. 
 
         ARD'RIAN 
       I'm not surprised at Gosheven's 
       behavior. But Kentor and the 
       others... they said they were 
       on our side. 
        (bitter) 
       I guess words don't mean very 
       much. 
 
     Data mulls this over carefully. 
 
         DATA 
       Perhaps that has been part of our 
       difficulty. Words are all we have 
       been using. 
        (thinking) 
       Humans seem to take much stronger 
       notice of actions. 
 
     Data makes a decision, gets to his feet. 
 
         DATA (cont'd) 
       I require a phaser. 
 
         ARD'RIAN 
       What's a phaser? 
 
         DATA 
       A type of weapon. Unfortunately 
       it will not function in the 
       presence of hyperonic radiation.

       I will have to be innovative. 
 
             CUT TO: 
 
 
     Data has opened up a phaser and is adapting it. His 
     forearm is opened, revealing his arm's inner workings; 
     Data is "cannibalizing" his arm for parts to modify the 
     phaser. Ard'rian looks on in fascination. 
 
         DATA 
       Hyperonic radiation randomizes 
       phaser beams. But I believe I 
       can improvise a servocircuit which 
       will compensate by continuously 
       recollimating the output. 
 
         ARD'RIAN 
       You're using your own neural 
       subprocessors to build a smarter 
       phaser. 
 
         DATA 
       Essentially correct. 
 
     Ard'rian's impressed. Data completes his work. 
 
         DATA (cont'd) 
       Get word to Gosheven. Tell him 
       I am coming to the pumping 
       station. Tell him I am going 
       to destroy the aqueduct. 
 
     Ard'rian is gaping like a carp over this, doesn't know 
     what to say. Finally manages:

             STAR TREK: "Ensigns of Command" REV. 7/14/89 - ACT FIVE      56. 
 
 
     Picard is listening to a recording of Data's string 
     quartet concert in Ten Forward. DOOR CHIME. 
 
         PICARD 
       Come. 
 
     Data ENTERS. 
 
         PICARD (cont'd) 
       Welcome home, Mister Data. Well 
       done. 
 
         DATA 
       Thank you, sir. 
 
         PICARD 
       The good doctor was kind enough 
       to provide me with a recording 
       of your concert. Your 
       performance shows a good deal 
       of feeling. 
 
         DATA 
       As I have lately had to remind 
       others, I have no feelings. 
 
         PICARD 
       That's hard to believe; your 
       playing is quite beautiful. 
 
         DATA 
       Strictly speaking, it is not 
       "my" playing. It is a precise 
       imitation of the techniques of 
       Jascha Heifetz and Trenka Bron-Ken.

         PICARD 
       And is there nothing of Data in 
       what I'm hearing? 
 
     Data ponders this. 
 
         PICARD (cont'd) 
       You chose the violinists. 
       Heifetz and Bron-Ken had 
       radically different styles, but 
       you combined them -- successfully. 
 
         DATA 
       I suppose I have learned to be 
       innovative... when necessary, sir. 
 
     Picard nods. He's made his point. 
 
         PICARD 
       Mister Data... I look forward to 
       your next concert. 
 
     On Data's thoughtful expression, we:
