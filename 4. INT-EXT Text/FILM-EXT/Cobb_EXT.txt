Stump gets out, blows on his hands. It's cold, and a
man comes out, the gas station owner, JONAH, 55. The
man services the car throughout the conversation.
STUMP
Fill it up and replace the
wiper blades.
JONAH
You got it.
STUMP
Colder than a witch's tit, eh?
JONAH
It's just starting. We got three-

Actually, I'm going to meet Ty Cobb.
JONAH
Cobb?! He stopped here for gas
once, I asked him for an autograph
for my boy and he told me to shove
it where the sun don't shine.
STUMP
I hear he's got a way with kids...
Stump heads to a pay phone as the attendant replaces the
wiper blades. Stump's breath hangs heavy in the air.
It's cold. Freezing. He drops a set of coins in the
call box. He blows on his hands and pulls up his collar
-- he wasn't prepared for the weather to be this cold.
He comes to life when he hears a voice on the other
end -- a voice we never hear.
STUMP
Hey, baby, it's me...
(beat)
Al... your husband...
(beat)
I'm up in the woods somewhere on
assignment...
(beat)
Listen, sweetheart, listen --
nobody can love you the way I
love you and I want you to take
me back. I made a mistake.
(listens)
Okay, lots of mistakes. I know
I'm not worthy.
We hear a CLICK.

Stump's car passes a sign that tells all:
DONNER PASS.
STUMP (V.O.)
I confess I was looking forward
to seeing Cobb and being near
his brilliance. My own life
seemed on hold, somehow. Everyday
churning out the same old articles,
drinking at 4 in the afternoon
with the same old guys, the same
old excuses for not writing a
novel, the same old confused
marriages that we all needed
and were trying to get out of
at the same time... Cobb was a
god whose brilliance, however
difficult, could rub off on
me. His problems were different
than mine...

ANGLE ON STUMP'S CAR

which pulls off the road and heads up a small mountain
road among snow-covered pines.
A row of mailboxes catches Stump's attention, and he
pulls over to review the names with a flashlight. He
lights his way across the names of a dozen boxes --
nothing, until:
The last box, enormously oversized, bears the name "COBB."
CLOSE ON STUMP
He smiles.
Perfect.

His car heads up a mountain road a final hundred yards,
comes around a bend in the trees and there it is --

Stump parks and approaches somewhat warily.
The sound of BREAKING GLASS and SHOUTING voices.
Stump hurries to the door to escape the rain and finds
refuge under the eave. The noise is frightening from
that close. He stands unsurely -- does he knock?
When --
The door is thrown open -- a black man, WILLIE, 40, with
a suitcase stands wildly upset, screaming back into the
house.
WILLIE
Fuck you, Mr. Cobb, I have too much
dignity to spend another moment
with you. I hope you die before
the sun comes up and may you rot
in hell!
The man whirls and is shocked to see Stump standing
there with his own suitcase.
WILLIE
Who are you?
STUMP
I'm a writer.
WILLIE
You mean he actually found somebody
to take the job?
Willie bursts out into crazed laughter, as if the world
of Cobb was finally too absurd. Cobb and a writer? In
this weather? In any weather? And the man walks through
the rain, laughing, heading on foot down off the mountain
as Stump just stares.
Stump turns and steps into the open doorway.

Snow flurries greet Stump as he heads outside, and
darkness is falling. He takes a deep breath.
STUMP (V.O.)
I couldn't be around the man for
long without needing a break, which
his painkillers gracefully
provided.
(beat)
My sanity would soon depend upon
a frequent breath of fresh air, a
walk in the woods -- any escape
from what one sportswriter had
called 'Cobb's brooding soul that
bubbled with violence.'
Stump lights a pipe as he walks up a trail, away from the
lodge, toward a ridge, all covered with snow. The
flurries of snow are getting thicker now.
STUMP (V.O.)
I knew most of the Cobb stories --
first man elected to the Hall of
Fame, ahead of the incomparable
Babe Ruth. Statistics that haven't
been approached in three-quarters
of a century.
Stump stops at the ridge and looks down at the partially
frozen Lake Tahoe in the lingering light.
STUMP (V.O.)
But I'd known boxing champions and
football players -- they were
gentle souls outside the arena.

How much of Cobb was an act, a
lifetime of theatrical intimidation
to preserve his own legend?

Legends grow in time. Tough guys

Stump continues walking down a crest of snow, through
a stand of snow-covered pines. The light is dark,
purple, eerie, and Stump is lost in thought, until,
suddenly, he sees:
A trail of blood in the snow. He follows it down a
slope, past a tree, growing deeper, thicker. And there
it is --
The buck lies dead in the snow in a pool of blood.
Stump stops in fear, then approaches, leans down
and examines --
STUMP
My God...
The buck's head has a hole blasted behind the ear.
Stump rises quickly to his feet and looks around.
The woods are silent. Snow falls from a branch. And...
He hurries back through the woods up the ridge, momen-
tarily lost as the snow swirls, he finally spots the
lodge.

Cobb leans on his HORN -- HONK, HONK, HONK.

Cobb's car passes Stump's car down the steep grade.
Insane, impossible, suicidal -- not another car on the

Cobb!
Stump plows his way on foot down the embankment, fighting
bad footing and snowdrifts, until --
He arrives at the car -- Surely nobody could survive
this. With difficulty, he makes his way to the back door
of the huge car and wrestles it open.
Stump sticks the top half of his body into the car.
STUMP
Cobb?
Cobb lies upside down, ass in the air, his face buried
under the dash of the car. There's blood on his face.
COBB
It's about fucking time you

Cobb struggles to right himself, twisting and turning
free.

COBB
Of course there's blood! I just
put my head through the windshield
of a car, what the hell ya think,
ya big fucking jerk.
STUMP
Shut up!
COBB
Ty Cobb can't die like this!
They'll bury me and nobody'll
know who it is!
STUMP
I said shut up.
Stump drags Cobb awkwardly through the snowbank back up
to the highway. When they get to the edge of the high-
way, Cobb stops to stare at the tire tracks leaving the
road.
COBB
Look't that! No guard rail! I'm
suing the State Highway Commission,
I'm suing the Governor, I'm suing
every God damn body!
(outraged)
I coulda been killed!
STUMP
God damn it, shut up and get in

COBB
Your call.
STUMP
You miserable son of a bitch. You
coward, you pathetic, frightened,
desperate old man -- you can't do
anything without that gun and
frankly it doesn't impress me to
keep flashing it because I know
you're not gonna shoot me 'cause
you need me worse than I need you.
What, you're gonna kill me?
Cobb smiles. He loves it when someone stands up to him.
He thrives on confrontation.
COBB
I've killed a man.
STUMP
Fine, then put me outta my fuckin'
misery. I'm freezing.
Cobb hands the gun to Stump.
COBB
Here ya go, Stumpy. I like a man

He pulls the WHISTLE and screams at the young boy standing

His face filled with excitement as the space between him

Closer and closer the engine comes -- 50 yards, 25 yards,

Young Ty Cobb leaps to safety, flying in front of the
engine, out over the water till he splashes, mere milli-
seconds before he would have been crushed to death.
Young Cobb surfaces in the river and waves his arms in
triumph. His pals shriek with delight and embrace him at
his courage.

my life not counting the first
time I saw a woman naked...

A man on the balcony porch moves toward the window from

A gambling den. Money on the bench. Two men is suits are

Cobb, early 20's, selects his bat, talks to the gambler.

steal third, steal home...

Cobb heads to the plate, passing his dejected teammate
who has just struck out.

Go to hell.
Cobb laughs -- He seems to feed on these exchanges, and
he stands in at the plate, addressing the UMPIRE.
COBB
Hey, Cyclops, you're missing a
good game.
UMPIRE
Shut up, Cobb.
As Cobb digs in, he reaches into his back pocket and
drops something on home plate, in front of the CATCHER.
COBB

The Catcher holds up a pair of women's panties.
COBB
Your old lady left 'em in my car
last night -- I thought you could
give 'em back to her.

He flips his thumb, a sign for the pitcher to deck Cobb.
CATCHER
You're going down, Cobb.
COBB
Let's go.
The pitcher delivers a fastball right at Cobb's head --

Then Cobb shouts at the shortstop, a large German-American
athlete, the great HONUS WAGNER.
COBB
Hey, Wagner! I'd shade me a
little up the middle if I was
you!
Wagner doesn't budge, comfortable in his position, not
drawn into Cobb's taunts. Stoic, implacable -- far from
Cobb.
COBB
(to catcher)
You try to take my head off then
you throw a sinker away, in and
out, same old shit -- sinker
away...
CLOSE ON COBB
His chatter stops, his focus is intense and sudden. He
holds the bat strangely, with a split grip, a left-
handed batter, he dangles the bat almost parallel to the
ground. For all his fierceness, there's a delicacy in
the way he holds the bat. A baton, a paintbrush, a magic
wand...
NEW ANGLE
Here comes the pitch -- sinker away -- and Cobb unleashes
a swing that is at once quick and powerful. He drives the
ball to left, the opposite way --
Wagner lunges to his right -- But the ball skips into
left.
Cobb streaks to first and rounds the base viciously, daring
to stretch it into a double but slamming on the brakes and
returning to first when the throw rifles into second.
Cobb shouts defiantly at the pitcher.
COBB
You God damn coward! You shoulda
thrown at me again! You shoulda
hit me in the fucking head!

The pitcher stretches, looks and delivers -- and Cobb
breaks for second. The pitch is wide. The Catcher fires.
Wagner takes the throw as Cobb arrives in a spikes-up
slide.
And Wagner swipes a brutal tag in Cobb's face -- his giant
ham of a hand in the tiny glove clutching the ball lashes
across Cobb's mouth. Blood gushes. The ball pops free.
Wagner seems unbothered by the fact that Cobb is safe at
second -- he has bloodied Cobb's face. Cobb seems unboth-
ered by the fact that his face is a bloody mess -- he has
stolen second. Both men seem satisfied.
BACK IN DUGOUT
More money is wagered.
PITCHER
Stretches and delivers -- Cobb takes off for third.
The
throw is high -- he slides in safely.
IN STANDS
Bets are doubled. The stands are full of wagering. The

third. The Catcher gives a signal to the pitcher.
PITCHER
nods, winds up, and as he does --
Here comes Cobb with a recklessness beyond reason. And
as the pitch arrives in the Catcher's hands, the Catcher
digs in to take on Cobb --
Cobb slides spikes high, flying above the earth, his back
leg slashing his spikes like knives. It is a slide of
utter defiance and violence, a slide intended to harm.
A vicious collision between Cobb and the catcher -- blood
and dust. The ball rolls free. Safe.
Cobb and the catcher immediately start punching and in
seconds, a brawl breaks out, both benches clearing. As
the police rush out to break up the brawl...
COBB (V.O.)

COBB (V.O.)
Do you know what it's like to be
booed like that?
Cobb in right with the cops -- the crowd on its feet,

moan of hatred.

He fucking hates everybody. Don't

STUMP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
(beat)
I was reluctant to view the great
Ty Cobb as a pathetic character,
lost in the past, paranoia, and
the shallow defense of 'his own
breeding'...
We hear SOUNDS of the TYPEWRITER BANGING away as...
We DRIFT OUT the window -- Leaving Stump to write all
night, at first viewing through the window, then moving
until we have a view of --

We hear the incessant BANGING OF the TYPEWRITER GRADUALLY
FADE AWAY...

My father told my mother he was
going out of town for the weekend
on business. But he didn't go.
He came back 'cause he thought she
was being unfaithful...

The father climbing up the trellis onto the balcony.
COBB (V.O.)
My
father thought he would catch
the
man who was trying to steal
his
wife from him... catch him
in
the act...

FATHER (B&W;)

pulls a gun as he nears the window.

A SHOTGUN BLAST takes out Cobb's father's stomach
and he reels back onto the balcony. He rolls to his
elbows and looks up.
COBB (V.O.)
My mother killed my father...
shot him in the belly...

And then blew his head clean
off...

Stump's car passes under the arch, heading out of town,
and we go to voice over:
STUMP (V.O.)
Actually the testimonial dinner at
the Hall of Fame was still weeks
away, but it was the only thing
that got him calmed down enough to
get us out of town without getting
thrown in jail -- or getting
somebody killed.
DISSOLVE TO:

The car takes Stump and Cobb eastward.
STUMP (V.O.)
And as we headed across country,
Cobb as usual was oblivious to the
chaos he'd left in his wake. In
fact he was buoyed with new
enthusiasm at the prospects of
seeing his cronies once again...
96
97
Game in progress -- Detroit vs. New York.
Cobb at the plate -- a pitch at his head knocks him down.
Immediately, both benches clear in a major brawl.
COBB (V.O.)
Whenever we got into a fight with
the New Yorkers, 24 of our guys
would fight 24 of their guys and
me and Ruth would take on each
other!
As the benches clear -- Cobb races not at the pitcher but
straight to right field where The Babe is charging in
like a rhino straight for Cobb. Somewhere near second
base the two giants collide in a thunderous smash,
falling to the ground in a brawl, as 48 players slug it
out in the b.g.

Cobb charges outside -- FIRING his PISTOL into the air.
The manager and a security guard hurry over. Followed
quickly by Stump, who's now an expert at this.
STUMP (V.O.)
He shot up his share of motels
for all the usual reasons --
guests were too noisy, he
couldn't get any sleep, it didn't
matter -- he was always boiling
over...

The car is parked by the side of the
highway. Cobb
stands with the tape recorder next to
an endless plain of
flat desert or rolling farmland. The
hood is up on the
car, steam spills from the radiator.
And Cobb is dictat-

COBB

... by the age of 25 I was a
millionaire, by the age of 30 a
multi-millionaire, by the age of

A crowd of locals has gathered and is cheering as the
great old warriors of baseball get out of one limo after
another and pass a phalanx of security guards, television
cameras, and photogaphers. A P.A. ANNOUNCER presents
each one.
P.A. ANNOUNCER
The great left-handed pitcher
from the New York Giants, who
struck out five men in a row in
the 19-- All-Star game -- Carl
Hubbell.
Lanky Carl Hubbell, 50's, waves to the crowd and cameras
as he enters to applause from the locals gathered.
P.A. ANNOUNCER
The great third baseman from the
Chicago Cubs, Harold Joseph 'Pie'
Traynor...
Pie Traynor, 60's, struggles to the entrance using a
cane.
P.A. ANNOUNCER
Paul and Lloyd Waner, the Waner
brothers -- Big Poison and Little
Poison -- from the Pittsburgh
Pirates...
The Waner Brothers, 60's, jauntily wave and enter.
P.A. ANNOUNCER
Fifty-eight home runs in a
season -- Mr. Double-X -- the
great Jimmy Foxx!
The barrel-chested Jimmy Foxx, 60, gets out and waves.
P.A. ANNOUNCER
And ladies and gentlemen, the
highest lifetime batting
average of all time, first man
elected to the Hall of Fame,
retired with over 90 batting
records, the one and only Georgia
Peach, Ty Cobb!
Cobb gets out, followed by Stump. Cobb walks into the
building, past the cameras, utterly erect and upright,
stretching his full six feet one inch. The applause is
the most enthusiastic yet.

CLOSE ON COBB'S FACE
His concentration is intense, his focus is mesmerizing,
full of pride and rage. He makes it to the door.
COBB
Your hand, Stumpy, your hand!
Stump slips his hand to Cobb's lower back just as they
arrive at the door, and the two men enter together.
COBB
Thank you, my friend...
And Cobb is met by the Hall of Fame director, CHARLES,
50, who shakes his hand and shows him in.
CHARLES
Hello, Mr. Cobb, good to see you
again.
And they head inside.
CUT TO:

Charles, the Hall director, opens the door for Cobb and
Stump. He clearly has been summoned in the middle of the
night.
STUMP
I appreciate your coming.
CHARLES
For Mr. Cobb, no problem.
Cobb is silent.
He and Stump enter.

The limo moves slowly and ominously through the
town.
Old folks, black and white, sitting on chairs and
benches in front of the stores, under awnings, stare
at the strange sight of a limo cruising slowly.
STUMP (V.O.)
It wasn't exactly the 'grand re-
entrance to a home town' that he
talked about...
CLOSE ON TWO OLD BLACK MEN
sitting under an awning. They point and discuss among
themselves who this could be.

Stump knocks at the door -- the door opens -- a woman in
her 60s appears. It is FLORENCE COBB XXXXX.
STUMP
Good day, ma'am. I'm looking for
Florence Cobb --------.

141
FLORENCE
That's me.
STUMP
I have your brother in the car.
FLORENCE
Tyrus?
STUMP
Yes.
And he'd like to see you.
COBB'S POV FROM CAR - STUMP AND SOMEBODY
He can't quite see who it is from his angle.
BACK TO SCENE
FLORENCE
I don't wish to see him.
STUMP
It's been a long time, he said.
He's not well.
FLORENCE
I have nothing to say to him, and
wish to hear nothing he has to say
to me.
STUMP
I know there's been problems, but
the family is very important to
him.
FLORENCE
Young man, the family he talks
about never existed.
STUMP
He loved his father.
FLORENCE
If his father, if my father, was
such a great man, why did Tyrus
turn out to be so evil?
Stump hesitates.
He doesn't have a ready answer.
STUMP
He's dying.
He just wants to see
you.

FLORENCE
No.
And she politely closes the door in Stump's face. Stump
turns, sees that the limo is at such a distance that Cobb
couldn't possibly have seen, or heard, her. He returns
to the limo.
CUT TO:

143
Stump walks away from the car and from Cobb.
Some wind
blows, and the threat of rain.
STUMP
I wish you'd die!
COBB
I will, Stumpy, I will...
Cobb is out of the car on his cane -- following Stump.
STUMP
And go to hell!
A line of lightning signals a storm in the distance.
COBB
Oh, I'll do that, too.
(beat)
And look how convenient you've
made it.
They look up -- The entrance to the Royston Cemetery.
A
casually-maintained slope of several acres up a hill.
STUMP
That was your sister alright, and
she didn't want anything to do
with you either!
COBB
I forgive her.
Stump walks into the cemetery to escape Cobb, who follows
nonetheless with a cool resolution. Stump laughs at
Cobb's comment.
(CONTINUED)

STUMP
You forgive her?! That's rich!
COBB
(following along)
Forgiveness is crucial to human
maturity and religious growth.
STUMP
Religious growth?!
COBB
We all need to forgive more, Al...
you oughta try it. You're too
angry. You're all pent up.
STUMP
I'm angry?
Through the cemetery they keep walking, up a long hill
full of tombstones and shrines and sprays of dead and
dying flowers and gaudy plastic bouquets. Cobb following
steadily along with his cane, several paces behind Stump.
THUNDER shakes the ground.
And more lightning.
COBB
Are you angry because I discovered
you were a whore? Is that it,
Alimony?
STUMP
I'm angry?!
COBB
Is it the divorce?
You gotta let
go of it...
STUMP
I love her!
I don't want a
divorce!
COBB
Sure ya do. You're just so used
to accommodating people that you
don't know what you want anymore.
I accommodate nobody.
Stump whirls near the top of the hill to face Cobb who
continues making his way along, slowly and surely.
STUMP
But you have no friends!

COBB
Do you? Who are they?! Those
drunken hacks you hang out with
who all think they're gonna write
the great American novel but all
they're gonna ever do is bitch and
moan and write lousy leads about
high school football games? How
about the brunette in the
courtyard? Is she your friend?
I heard she fucks everybody -- she
must be everybody's friend!
A mausoleum looms behind Stump, bigger than anything in
the cemetery, classical, outsized, monumental, even
elegant. One simple word is above the door, carved in
granite: COBB.
COBB
I'm glad we're here -- I was gonna
bring you here anyway sooner or
later --
Stump turns to see the mausoleum, and the word COBB.
STUMP
Which Cobb of Georgia is that?
Several beats as the men take it all in.
Finally:
COBB
(with pride)
That is me.
And rain suddenly falls from the skies, threatening to
soak the two men.
Cobb heads for the mausoleum -- Stump follows.

A teenage boy re-paints the faded sign that reads "Home

I gave a few bucks to a local kid
to re-paint the sign, and
disappeared for a while to finish
the manuscripts...

And wait for Cobb to die...

And while I waited, Ernest
Hemingway blew his brains out,
Getty bought Honolulu Oil Company,

And on July 17, 1961... Ty Cobb
died quietly in his sleep. I
don't believe it was quiet, nothing
he did was quiet, but that's what
the newspaper writer said who wrote
the lead and we all know that
writers never lie...
PAN OVER ACROSS the sign -- to the adjacent cemetery
as --
A hearse enters the cemetery grounds followed by three
cars. A very humble ceremony.

Drawn from Emmanuel's veins...'

flood,
Lose all their guilty stains...'
STUMP (V.O.)
... but it was the grimmest damn
funeral service I'd ever seen.
Stump stands in the distance, at the back of the cemetery,
watching the simple, empty service.
STUMP (V.O.)
He left all his money to his
family, though no members of it
managed to attend the funeral, and
with the rest he founded a hospital
in his own name and an educational
trust fund for poor Georgia
children.

fact he didn't want made public.
POV SHOT - SCHOOL BUS
pulls in and unloads -- Dozens of Little Leaguers in
uniform join in the service.
STUMP (V.O.)
Somebody rounded up some Little
Leaguers, probably so the press
photographers would have some
sob sister photos... the sort
Cobb hated... except the press
didn't bother coming.
(beat)
I'll give him this -- the family
was under one roof again.
BACK TO SCENE
Stump turns and slips quietly out of the cemetery.

And Stump enters for the first time in nearly a year.
BILL

Stump enters comfortably, happy to see his cronies at
last. Frank and the others come over from the bar,
quickly gathering around Stump.
FRANK
Stranger!
Another round on me!
Stump settles in at the table.
CRONIES
Long time no see, etc...

Good to see you guys... how's

REYNALDO
Tell us the truth, man, was he

BILL
Or was he just one of the guys?
Stump looks at the faces of his buddies, eagerly
awaiting his judgement as if it is final wisdom.
He
stirs his drink.
STUMP
The truth?
CRONIES
Ohyeah, the absolute truth, no
bullshit, give it to us
straight, etc...
STUMP
The truth?
Stump takes a drink and looks his friends in the eye.
STUMP
A prince and a great man has
fallen.
Murmurs of deep satisfaction from the Cronies.
Affirmation.
CRONIES
Yes, awright, we knew it...
etc...
BILL
Helluva guy, eh?
STUMP
A helluva guy, a great man, a
misunderstood artist, a fierce
competitor but a sweet man at
heart... a gentle soul...

Some kids play baseball with a taped-up ball, patched

truth in a closet...
PAN OVER TO the Royston Cemetery in b.g.
MAUSOLEUM
Nearby, two holes in the earth have been opened up and
the caskets of Cobb's mother and father are being moved
into the mausoleum.
STUMP (V.O.)
Cobb and his father and mother
were together at last...
(beat)
The man had some deep, unexpressed
sorrow that I could never know.
I embraced him and I hated him...

And I knew I would never write a
novel, unless you considered 'Cobb'

not.

Stump walks from the dugout to the field. He stares up
at the magnificent old structure, the overhanging right
field facade, the great upper deck, almost a century of
baseball has been played there. Cobb's palace.
STUMP (V.O.)
My friends were thrilled to hear
that the Georgia Peach was a
helluva guy -- it excused their own
failures -- if Cobb was okay, then
by God, they were okay...
(beat)
But finally I didn't lie for
them, or the children of America,
or somesuch hogwash -- finally I
lied for myself.

I needed Cobb to be somebody he was

It is my weakness.
