CLOSE ON the glowing dials of the RADIO.  It s tuned to 
STATIC.  Now and then faint BIG BAND MUSIC ghosts up through 
the noise, signal from some far-off station.

WE DRIFT over clutter in the passenger seat: a mess of 
PAPERS, a pewter FLASK, a pair of READING GLASSES with a LENS 
popped out.

A HAND reaches in, searching for the flask.  It belongs to 
our driver, FRANK WINTER, 42.  Loose gabardine tie, two-day 
beard.  The rumpled handsomeness of a man too consumed by 
work to look in mirrors.

Frank glances down, notices the broken reading glasses.

He ignores the flask, picks up the lens, absently considers 
it... then cocks his head.  Focused on the glass disc in his 
hand, SEEING SOMETHING.  A chain reaction.  An epiphany.  
Whatever it is, it hits him like a hammer.

Dazed, Frank looks up to find --

HEADLIGHTS BEARING DOWN ON HIM.  He s drifted into the wrong 
lane.  He tugs the wheel, the sedan LURCHING as a PATROL CAR 
hurtles past in the opposite direction, inches from disaster.

The patrol car pulls a U-turn, cherry lights blazing.



GLEN BABBIT (50s), a pragmatic barnacle of a man, trails the 
Deputy through a sleepy backwater station.

BABBIT
What s he charged with?

DEPUTY
Driving while intoxicated, 
resisting arrest, disturbing the 
peace --3.


BABBIT
In the middle of the fucking desert?  
Who d he disturb, a yucca tree?

An OFFICER pipes up from his desk.

OFFICER
And possession of a counterfeit 
license.

BABBIT
We ve got to go.  Those are his 
things?

DEPUTY
He s not going anywhere.

Babbit gives him a weary look.  Picks up a telephone.

BABBIT
You don t want me to make this call.

DEPUTY
Is it long distance?

BABBIT
(dialing)
Don t worry, it s gonna be quick.
(into phone)
It s number Thirty Three.  Is he 
in?

Babbit offers the phone.  The Deputy takes it... 

...and hangs it up on its cradle.

Babbit winces.  The Deputy sits.

DEPUTY
Now.  Why don t you start by 
telling me where you all came from.

Across the room, a TELEPHONE rings.  A wizened SECRETARY 
answers, calls out to the Deputy.

SECRETARY
Deputy Ross.  It s Henry Stimson.

DEPUTY
Who the hell s Henry Stimson?

OFFICER
Sir -- he s the Secretary of War.4.


The Deputy blanches.  Babbit gathers Frank s things, walks to 
the cell where Frank is sitting on a cot, holding a nub of 
CHALK.  Babbit passes Frank s hat through the bars.

FRANK
Morning Glen.

BABBIT
We re gonna be late for work.

FRANK
I ve been working all night.

For the first time, Babbit registers the cell wall behind 
Frank.  It s crammed floor to ceiling with chalked EQUATIONS.



Row after row of new-minted SERVICEMEN and WACs (Women s Army 
Corps) slouch in their seats.  They ve been driving all 
night, headed off to fight, maybe to die.

In back, we find a freckled Midwestern kid (21), too keyed up 
to sleep, holding a comic book: Captain America slugging 
Hitler in the jaw.  This is the furthest he s been from Des 
Moines, and it shows.  We ll call him IOWA.

IOWA 
My granddad fought the Spaniards 
in Cuba, my old man fought the 
Krauts at the Marne.  You could say 
shooting Europeans is a family 
tradition.

His sleepy-eyed seat-mate ignores him. 

IOWA (CONT D)
Lock and load, ducks in a barrel. 

VOICE FROM FRONT OF BUS 
Shut up already!

Unfazed, Iowa offers his seat-mate a stick of gum. 

IOWA 
I hope they got Juicy Fruit in 
France.  Think we ll get a few days 
in Manhattan before we ship out?  I 
always wanted to eat at an automat. 

A RECRUIT pops over the seat-back in front of them. 5.


RECRUIT 
Hey shitbird --
(raps on the window)
You see the sun coming up?  We re 
driving west.  Wherever they re 
taking us, it ain t Manhattan.



Packed to the gills with LUGGAGE.  Unhappily driving is 
CHARLIE BELL.  Untested wunderkind.  Jew from St. Louis with 
a 180 IQ and a $13 suit.  At 26, he is the smartest person he 
has ever met, though not for long.  Charlie s got a road map 
spread across the wheel.  Lost, but won t admit it.

His wife, ABBY -- 25, pretty, pampered -- thumbs through an 
issue of MOVIE STORY magazine with BETTY GRABLE on the cover.  
Five-year-old twins JOEY and JUDY are asleep in the back.

CHARLIE
It s a misprint.  You believe that?  
There s supposed to be a bridge.  
I m writing a letter to Rand 
McNally.

ABBY
Tell him you dragged your wife two 
thousand miles to live like an 
Apache in the desert.

The road winds through a badland of scrub-oak and rock.  Not 
a telephone pole as far as the eye can see.

CHARLIE
They said it d be just like 
Cambridge.   Harvard with sand. 

ABBY
Daddy s offer still stands.
(off Charlie)
It s a good job, Charles.

CHARLIE
It s a sales job.6.


ABBY
God forbid.  You d think a PhD was 
a vow of poverty.  You know 
business is a science.

CHARLIE
Recruiter said I could be the next 
Enrico Fermi.
(off her blank look)
He s the Betty Grable of physics.

ABBY
And no one ever heard of him.

CHARLIE
You think anybody d heard of 
Galileo in 1640?

ABBY
I bet Galileo knew how to read a 
road map.

She returns to her magazine.  The twins stir in the backseat.

JOEY
I gotta go pee.

Charlie digs around the floor for an empty SODA BOTTLE.  He s 
passing it to his son, and rounding a switchback, when --

ABBY
Charlie!

He JAMS the breaks, FISHTAILS, nearly PLOWING into a BUICK at 
a dead stop just ahead.

Charlie clenches the wheel, pulse racing.  Only gradually 
registers the strangeness of the scene.

A RIVER OF CARS stretches before them, bumper-to-bumper,  
chrome glinting in the brutal sun.  At the roadside, men are 
changing the tire of a SCHOOL BUS.  It s full of NATIVE 
AMERICANS: stone-faced women and girls in traditional Pueblo 
garb.  Eerie.

The DRIVER leans against the bus door, smoking.  Leathery, 
50s.  Thousand-yard stare.  Charlie cranes out the window.

CHARLIE
Circus in town?  Where s everybody 
going?

DRIVER
P.O. Box 1663.7.


CHARLIE
(checks map)
But what s the place called?

DRIVER
It isn t.  No names, no street 
signs.  Welcome to nowhere.

Weirder by the minute.  Traffic picks up, cresting a rise.

ABBY
...Charlie?

Looming up before them, a

CITY ON A HILL

Like a mirage in the sun-blasted desert: a TOWERING VOLCANIC 
MESA fenced off by miles of RAZOR WIRE, crowned with pre-fab 
BUILDINGS.  Uncanny as a white-picket suburb on the moon.

The road snakes up to a GATE policed by SOLDIERS.  MACHINE 
GUNS bristling from a WATCHTOWER.  ARMED GUARDS searching 
cars.  Charlie whitens.

ABBY (CONT D)
That doesn t look like Cambridge.



A hive of symphonic activity.  Frank and Babbit cross a vast 
floor of YOUNG MEN working at field desks, past chugging 
machinery and chalkboards scrawled with Byzantine math.

BABBIT
See, you don t talk to the girls in 
the Steno pool.  General s planning 
to reorganize the Tech Area, soup 
to nuts.  All I m saying is 
ingratiate yourself, make an 
impression.

Frank shoots Babbit a dismissive look.

BABBIT (CONT D)
You think it s beneath you?  Akley 
does it.

FRANK
There s an endorsement.

BABBIT
The man chaired experimental 
physics at Chicago.

FRANK
Experimental physics is ninety 
percent plumbing.

They arrive at a conference room.  It s hazy with pipe smoke.

FRANK (CONT D)
Besides.  Cuddle up with the army, 
who knows what you ll catch.9.


Through the doorway, we pick out a half-dozen SCIENTISTS 
raptly inspecting something O.S.  No starched white lab 
coats, no sci-fi cliche.  They look like tweed-and-
Brilliantine college professors -- and most of them are.

Frank and Babbit file in.  And now we glimpse it.  Projected 
on a screen:

A large-scale BLUEPRINT of a BOMB.

Not any bomb -- the iconic shape of the world s first atomic 
weapon.  Leveler of cities.  The original doomsday machine.

SCIENTIST
And nineteen and twenty makes a 
quorum.  Gentlemen, say hello to 
the Thin Man.

Stenciled on the door is the name of the facility.  A name so 
carefully guarded we will never hear it spoken aloud:

LOS ALAMOS.

The door swings shut, cutting off our view, as we --

SMASH CUT TO:


MAIN TITLES

Over the Blind Boys of Alabama's  Jesus Hits Like the Atom 
Bomb,  we see archive footage of ATOMIC TEST SHOTS: Aztec, 
Baker, Greenhouse, Wigwam.  Bright-colored flowers of 
destruction.

We see nuclear families in fallout shelters, smiling kids in 
anti-radiation suits.  Bikinis, atomic cocktails.  Charred 
mannequins at Nevada Proving Ground.  The Ford Nucleon, Three 
Mile Island.  American fear and hope.  Missiles in Cuba, 
reactors in Tehran, Shock and Awe.  All fallout from the 
Manhattan Project.

END TITLE SEQUENCE.



Lights dimmed.  Frank is packed in with maybe thirty seated 
scientists, palpably restless, as an officious INTELLIGENCE 
OFFICER holds court.

INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
...that discretion is a question of 
life and death.  
(MORE)10.

INTELLIGENCE OFFICER (CONT'D)
And yet, we have daily reports of 
scientists discussing technical 
matters outside the Tech Area.  So 
as of this morning, the following 
codes are to be strictly observed 
by all personnel...

An overhead projector hums to life, throwing a glossary of 
CODE WORDS onto the screen behind him.

INTELLIGENCE OFFICER (CONT D)
 Igloo  for isotope,  Urchin  for 
uranium, and so forth.  That s for 
teletype messages and oral 
conversation, no exceptions.

Groans from the gallery.  An MP distributes mimeos.

INTELLIGENCE OFFICER (CONT D)
If that s a hardship, there are 
160,000 troops headed for Normandy 
who would gladly take your place.  
Colonel?

The floor is ceded to COLONEL ALDEN COX, 46, senior officer 
on the Hill, lord of the realm.  Built like a refrigerator, 
and as warm as one.

COX
Yesterday, we received word that 
the Clinton Reactor is up and 
running.
(a ripple of surprise)
If projections hold, the first 
samples of Product will arrive in a 
month.  We can expect to see more 
of the General and more of our 
friends from D.C.  Therefore you 
can expect new security strictures.

At Cox s nod, a complex ORG CHART comes up on the projector.

COX (CONT D)
Which brings us to organizational 
hygiene.  Effective today, we are 
cleaning house.  Some of your 
groups will merge.  Some will be 
discontinued.

It takes Frank all of two seconds to absorb the chart.  
Babbit catches his eye, both men understanding that their 
group has been killed.11.


COX (CONT D)
For those of you in Ordnance and 
Engineering ...

But Frank is already gathering his things and walking out.  
Heads swivel, Colonel Cox breaking off to watch him go.



Frank moves at a determined clip, Babbit hustling after.

BABBIT
You know, the thing about colonels -- 
they like to dismiss you.
(catching up)
This isn t Princeton and you re not 
tenured.

FRANK
It s not West Point either.  He 
just pulled the plug on a year of 
work.  You want me to thank him?

They reach a blonde SECRETARY stationed outside an imposing 
office.

SECRETARY
He s on the telephone.

Frank blows past.  She stands, alarmed.

SECRETARY (CONT D)
Dr. Oppenheimer s talking to 
Washington.

It s enough to stop Frank short.  He thinks, turns to Babbit.

FRANK
Where re my guys?



CLOSE ON NEWSPAPER HEADLINES.  Nazi bombs raking London.  
Rumors of a U.S. ground invasion.  Jews rounded up in 
Cherkassy and Lviv.

LIAO (O.S.)
Just once I d like a goddamn sports 
page.

The papers are posted above a bank of urinals, where three 
junior scientists stand elbow-to-elbow: Frank s group.12.


SID LIAO, 27, is half-Chinese, all-American and wry.  LOUIS 
 FRITZ  FEDOWITZ, 32, over-mothered, has forty pounds of 
padding and a nervous cough.  PAUL CROSLEY, 29, is polished, 
privileged and baldly ambitious.  The world is his clubhouse.

The door bursts open and baby-faced JIM MEEKS (23) enters, 
flush with gossip, a SPECIMEN CUP in his hand.

MEEKS
They re in there right now.  All 
the group heads.

Meeks commandeers a urinal.

CROSLEY
If a career falls in the desert and 
there s no one there to hear it, 
does it make a sound?

FRITZ
I can t go if you re talking.

LIAO
They can t cut our budget.  We re 
producing results.

CROSLEY
We re squandering our youth.
(zips)
You know how old Heisenberg was 
when he cracked the uncertainty 
principle?  Twenty-six.

LIAO
So?

Crosley deposits a full specimen cup on the sink counter.  
One by one the guys wrap up and wash their hands.

CROSLEY
So he was a late-bloomer.  Darwin 
was twenty-one when the Beagle 
sailed.  By the time Einstein was 
twenty-six, he d rewritten half of 
physics.

MEEKS
You re only what, twenty-nine?

CROSLEY
That s middle age in science.  It s 
like dog years.  Turn thirty with 
no publications, they take you out 
behind the barn.13.


The scientists push through the door to --



Where a dour MEDIC collects their samples.

LIAO
Down the hatch.

The medic frowns at Fritz s cup.  It s empty.

FRITZ
I ll just, uh -- stop back later.



A fluorescent bulb sputters.  The junior scientists descend 
to a dank basement warren.  Home sweet home.

CROSLEY
Look.  I respect Frank as much as 
you do, but we re holding our dicks 
here.  Reed Akley s got six hundred 
guys on Thin Man.  We ve got six 
working on implosion, and one of 
them s a Chinaman.

Up ahead, two SOLDIERS back out of an office marked  I-GROUP  
with an unwieldy MASS SPECTROMETER on a dolly.

MEEKS
Hey!  That s I-Group s equipment.

The soldiers push past them.  Roman Legion in khaki and crew 
cuts.

SOLDIER
Not anymore.



LANCEFIELD, an immaculate WASP in his 30s, leads Charlie 
across the bustling floor.  Night and day from I-Group s drab 
basement.  Charlie s dazzled, kid in a candy shop.

LANCEFIELD
We ve got Triple-A priority, and a 
blank check from the president.  
(MORE)14.

LANCEFIELD (CONT'D)
They may be rationing tires in 
Topeka, but around here, you put in 
for a Cadillac, you ll have the 
keys on your desk by sunup.

Around the room, young scientists stop what they re doing to 
watch Charlie pass.  He notices, self-conscious.

LANCEFIELD (CONT D)
They all read your paper.  Passed 
it around like a Tijuana bible.

Before he can process, Charlie spots a balding man in an 
office and nearly trips.

CHARLIE
Is that --

LANCEFIELD
Fermi.  You know Einstein was here 
last month.
(off Charlie s amazement)
You re looking at the best equipped 
lab in the country.  We ve got 
three cyclotrons, a dozen IBM 
multipliers...and the finest 
computers money can buy.

They come to a room marked  COMPUTERS.   Lancefield opens the 
door revealing --



The  computers  of 1944: 12 YOUNG WOMEN crunching numbers.  
They re knockouts, a harem with bulky Marchant calculators.

LANCEFIELD
Ladies, this is the youngest buck 
who ever won the Forbes Prize.  Say 
hello to Charlie.

COMPUTERS
Hi, Charlie!

The Computers smile coquettishly.

LANCEFIELD
(lewd wink)
No lying down on the job, girls.

Charlie blushes.  Through the looking glass to a world where 
scientists have groupies.  And the tour picks up along --15.



Down the hall a fluorescent light flickers in the stairwell 
to the basement.

CHARLIE
What s down there?

LANCEFIELD
I-Group?  Siberia.  Where PhD s go 
to die.

With a sly smile, Lancefield ushers Charlie into --



Where a dozen other NEWCOMERS sit filling out paperwork. 

LANCEFIELD
We ll need you to answer some 
questions.  Everybody on the 
project s gotta have security 
clearance.

CHARLIE
What is the project?  They still 
haven t told me.

LANCEFIELD
I ll leave that to Dr. Akley.  
First, though, we ll need your 
commitment.

CHARLIE
But I don t know what I m 
committing to.

LANCEFIELD
Charlie, this is Shangri La.  
Average age is twenty-five.  We ve 
got the highest combined IQ of any 
town in America and more Jews than 
Babylon.  You ll be wined and dined 
by the U.S. Army till Hitler and 
the Japs say uncle.

CHARLIE
How long will that be?

Lancefield hands Charlie a CLIPBOARD and a PEN.

LANCEFIELD
Well, that all depends on us.16.


Off Charlie, holding his Faustian contract, utterly seduced.



A BLACKBOARD full of MULTIVARIABLE EQUATIONS.  Frank is 
furiously ERASING it.

Babbit, Liao, Meeks, Fritz, Crosley and HELEN PRICE (27, a 
tomboyish beauty) look on in silence.  The junior scientists 
are a little scared of him.

FRANK
The math here is simple.  Only one 
variable matters.

What s left on the board is a single letter: T.  Frank 
circles it, turning to the group.

FRANK (CONT D)
Time.
(a beat)
It ll take fourteen months to 
produce enough plutonium for 
Akley s bomb.  Our bomb s more 
efficient.  Smaller critical mass 
means less plutonium means a 
shorter lead time.

He holds up his page of notes from last night.

FRANK (CONT D)
Add explosive lenses, we can shave 
a week off Akley s schedule, maybe 
more.

HELEN
But... We ve been reassigned.

FRANK
Oppenheimer leaves for D.C. 
tomorrow.  That gives us a day to 
change his mind.

Crosley eyes the others, incredulous.

BABBIT
We re coloring outside the lines 
here.  The work will be secret, and 
if you re caught there may be 
trouble.17.


CROSLEY
So... we commit mutiny on the off 
chance we can save the army one 
week.

FRANK
Somewhere in Germany, there s a 
town just like this one, full of 
scientists hungrier than you.  If 
they beat us to the punch, 
everything you love will disappear.  
The week we save could be the week 
that makes the difference.
(down to business)
We need numbers.  Exactly how much 
time is on the table.  They can t 
ignore hard data.

ON THE GROUP, hesitant.

FRITZ
Frank, we can t --

BABBIT
That s the spirit.

HELEN
We can t run the numbers because 
the Army Corps took our files.  
Boxed them up this morning.

A beat, Frank momentarily thrown.

FRANK
Well let s find them.



Two MPs comb the room, dismantling the Winters  private world 
as if field-stripping a rifle.  Meanwhile --



MPs scour other lives.  In PROPULSIVE CUTS: 

-- Two MPs in a parked sedan watch a WIFE leave her house.  
When she s safely out of sight, they get out of the car.

-- MPs riffling the pages of books and periodicals: SPECIAL & 
GENERAL RELATIVITY, LOST HORIZON.

-- HANDS raiding medicine cabinets and refrigerators.

-- An MP examining a chunk of AMBER with an INSECT trapped 
inside, gingerly, as if it might be radioactive, while --



Contents of Frank s side table spread out on the bed.  Pocket 
watch, cufflinks, passport.  An MP shuffling papers when --

KA-THUNKK of the front door downstairs.  MP freezes.  His 
partner ducks out of the closet.  Their eyes lock: Fuck.



Liza s arms are full of flowers.  She finds a vase, turns on 
the faucet.  There s a ferocious CLANKING of pipes, no water.  
Another day in paradise.



PUSHING LIZA as she approaches the bedroom, on a collision 
course with the MPs... then at the last moment banks into --



Where she spins both taps on the sink, plumbing roulette: not 
even a trickle.  Perfect.  She turns on her heels.19.



Liza sweeps into the bedroom, hits the light, and...

The room is pristine, everything in its right place.  Liza 
opens the closet -- NO MPs.  As she pulls out a fresh shirt, 
we hear the muffled CLICK of the front door.  She stops, 
listens a beat.  Then shrugs it off.



College living.  Avalanche of books, milk stagnating in 
cereal bowls.  A pair of corn-fed MPs sift the chaos.

One of them is searching a cheap wooden desk.  The bottom 
drawer STICKS.  He frowns, works it loose, turns the drawer 
over, revealing a fat MANILA ENVELOPE taped to the underside.

Stamped on the envelope:  TOP SECRET.   Pay dirt.

MP
Olly olly oxen free.

PRELAP: A CAR DOOR SLAMS



Furnished like a mid-grade motel.  Abby follows VOICES to the 
kitchen where three Stepford-esque WIVES look right at home.

FAY
We re not snooping!

MAY
We re the welcome wagon!  I m May, 
this is Fay, that s Mary Ellen.

The wives (30s, allergic to silence) offer BAKED GOODS.20.


MARY-ELLEN
Who says fences make good 
neighbors.  Good neighbors make 
brown Betty.

There s a sudden CRASH of cymbals: a jazz LP from next door.  
The wives seem to enjoy Abby s alarm.

FAY
Thin walls...



The two MPs eyeball Fritz across a cold steel table.  He s 
terrified, trying not to show it.  MP 1 jots notes.

FRITZ
It s Fedowitz.  But my friends call 
me Fritz.  I m not German or 
anything -- it s  cause I m bad 
with machines.

Not a flicker of a smile from the MPs.

MP 2
And you re a chemist?

Reverse to find we re:



Same room, same inquisitors -- but now it s MEEKS in the hot 
seat.  We ll CUT rapid-fire between separate interviews.23.


MEEKS
(genial)
Quantum electrodynamics, with a 
subspecialty in probability 
amplitudes.  But my passion is 
mesotron theory.
(dead air)
You can just put  physics. 



Liao squares off against the MPs, arms folded.  Smart-ass 
sophomore in the principal s office.

LIAO
I m a Sagittarius.  How  bout you 
fellas?

MP 2
You share a residence with Louis 
Fedowitz and James Meeks?

LIAO
A residence?  Yeah it s a regular 
country estate.  What re you, Mutt 
and Jeff?



Meeks rambles on, cheerfully oblivious to any threat.

MEEKS
Fritz and Liao have wives back 
home,  but out here they live like 
Neanderthals.  Me, I like to keep a 
tight ship.  I m an Eagle Scout.



Fritz is starting to sweat.

FRITZ
If this is about the cereal bowls 
from the mess hall, I swear I was 
gonna return  em.

MP 1
You familiar with the Espionage 
Act?24.


MP 2
Whoever, lawfully or unlawfully 
having access to, or being 
entrusted with any document, code 
book, photograph --

FRITZ
Whoa, whoa -- espionage?

MP 1 slides the MANILA ENVELOPE across the table.



Meeks opens the envelope: a sheaf of X-RAY IMPLOSION STUDIES.

MP 2
Here s a hint.  We found them in 
your room.

MEEKS
What were you doing in my room?
(only just realizing)
You think I took these?



MP 1
We know it was you.

Liao stares at the x-rays fanned out like a bad poker hand.

MP 2
No more wisecracks?  You hear the 
one about the Chink in the electric 
chair?

MP 1
Your old man taught at Peking 
University.  Is he a Communist?  
Are you?

MP 2
Let s talk about your affiliation 
with the East Bay Teachers  Union.

But before he can answer, the door blows open:

FRANK
We re done here.

The MPs stand.  Unclear who wields the power here.25.


MP 1
Dr. Winter --

FRANK
Are you fighting the Nazis or 
cribbing their playbook?

MP 2
There s a protocol.  G-2 has 
credible intelligence --

FRANK
What I ve seen from G-2 is an 
impressive lack of intelligence, 
credible or otherwise.  They 
haven t even told you what you re 
doing here, have they?

Frank gestures at the implosion X-rays.

FRANK (CONT D)
You have any idea what you re 
looking at?

MP 1
We re not here to debate science, 
doctor --

FRANK
It s not science.  It s the 
property of the government of the 
United States of America.

MP 1
I m sorry?

FRANK
Our work is so classified congress 
and the vice president don t know 
we exist.  Far as they re concerned 
the Manhattan Project is a leaky 
tunnel on the IRT -- and you re 
gonna stand there, Sergeant 1st 
Class with your J-3 security 
clearance, and talk to me about 
protocol?  You could be court-
martialed just for holding that 
envelope.

The MPs stand, speechless, outgunned.  MP 1 drops the manila 
envelope.26.


FRANK (CONT D)
(to Liao)
Get up.



Frank and Liao walk briskly, neither looking at the other.

FRANK
What were you thinking?

Liao turns in surprise: how d Frank know it was him?

LIAO
The X-ray studies... you said it 
was my best work.
(ashamed)
I thought after we all go home, 
there might be patents.

Frank nods.  Simply:

FRANK
Don t do it again.

They round a corner, nearly clotheslining Helen.

HELEN
There you are.
(to Liao)
Are you all right?

FRANK
He s fine.

HELEN
I tracked down the files -- we have 
a problem.



Helen leads Frank, Liao, Fritz, Meeks and Crosley into a vast 
unlit storeroom.  Fumbles for the lights.

HELEN
They re in here somewhere.  Trouble 
is the boxes aren t labeled.

Fluorescent panels blink on revealing THOUSANDS of anonymous 
STORAGE CRATES in a space that could house a 747.  The junior 
scientists take stock, overwhelmed.27.


FRITZ
We re looking for a needle in the 
Singer Sewing factory.

CROSLEY
You know what happens if they catch 
us in here?  I ll end up teaching 
math at some high school in 
Decatur.

FRANK
If they kill our group and the 
project fails, you ll end up 
teaching German.

FRITZ
Say it takes five minutes to check 
each crate --

LIAO
Optimistically.

FRITZ
Times a couple thousand crates, 
divided by six --

But Frank has noticed something in a crate in the corner.

FRANK
Half our files came over from the 
Berkeley Rad Lab.

MEEKS
(a beat, not following)
Yeah...

FRANK
That means they re hot.  Swimming 
in beta radiation.

Frank pulls a boxy GEIGER COUNTER out of the crate, switches 
it on.  The machine sputters and clicks ominously.

FRANK (CONT D)
So... Go fish.



We re looking at a large PROPAGANDA POSTER.  A drowning 
sailor points in accusation:  SOMEONE TALKED! 

Charlie stares at the sailor with vague unease.28.


AKLEY S SECRETARY
He s ready for you.

Charlie straightens his tie and pushes into --



An oak-and-leather bastion, twice the size of Frank s office.  
REED AKLEY, fifty-something Boston Brahmin in a club tie and 
horn rims, holds Charlie s PHYSICAL REVIEW paper.

CHARLIE
Dr. Akley.

AKLEY
 A New Approach to Quantum 
Cosmology.   I wish I d written it.

Charlie tries to conceal his pleasure as they shake hands.  
Akley gestures to an unopened bottle of PREMIUM WHISKEY.

AKLEY (CONT D)
Can I tempt you?

CHARLIE
I haven t seen real bourbon since 
Pearl Harbor.

AKLEY
Friends in high places.  Call it 
your signing bonus.

Akley uncorks the bottle and pours two drinks.

AKLEY (CONT D)
So, Charlie Bell.  Tell me why 
you re here.

CHARLIE
Sir?

AKLEY
You drove two thousand miles.  
Uprooted your family to a glorified 
sand trap in a state with more 
cattle than people.  What do you 
want?

CHARLIE
I don t know.29.


AKLEY
Yes you do.  You want to be great.  
Same as every lab-tech and test 
tube washer in this building.
(hands drink to Charlie)
But they don t have what you have.

For the first time, Charlie notices a blackboard full of 
MATH.  He stares, rapt, assembling its pieces like a puzzle.

AKLEY (CONT D)
We re waging a war of ideas, 
Charlie.  It ll be fought on 
battlefields and beaches, but make 
no mistake -- the peace will be won 
with brains, not brawn.

CLOSE ON CHARLIE, eyes darting across the blackboard.

AKLEY (CONT D)
Forget about codebreaking.  Forget 
meteorology, optics --

But Charlie s stopped listening.  Like he s seen a ghost:

CHARLIE
(realizing)
You re building an atomic bomb.

Akley looks from Charlie to the board, taken aback.

AKLEY
We prefer to call it a gadget.
(smiles, impressed)
Most of the new boys, I walk them 
through the math and they still 
don t see it.

CHARLIE
They said I d be working in a radar 
lab.

AKLEY
Sorry for the smoke and mirrors.  
We can t exactly advertise.
(silence)
Dean Everett at Harvard says you re 
the quickest study he s ever seen.  
He also says you re a patriot.  

CHARLIE
A bomb like that... A gadget, I 
mean... The burn radius would be 
two miles wide.  It s -- too big...30.


AKLEY
You can grow old and die writing 
white papers on field quantization.  
A hundred people will read your 
work and ten will understand it.  
Or you can join my group and watch 
the apple fall with Newton.

Charlie looks dazed.  Akley sips his whiskey and smiles.

AKLEY (CONT D)
God bless Kentucky.

Off Charlie, caught between his ambition and his soul.



Frank pulls to the curb on a leafy suburban street, unclips 
his SECURITY BADGE, locks it in the glove box.  He sits a 
moment, an actor getting out of character.  Or into one.

LIZA (PRE-LAP)
How was your day?



Liza searches Frank s face.  A dining table and an ocean of 
silence between them.

His eyes reveal nothing.  He s a good liar.

FRANK
Fine.

They re at dinner with their daughter, CALLIE (15, whip-
smart, and dying of boredom).  An awkward formality prevails.

Frank forks a bite of casserole and nearly spits it out.

LIZA
Water s out.  I had to use tonic.

CALLIE
I think it s delicious.

LIZA
No.

CALLIE
No what?

Liza rolls her eyes, seeing through Callie s flattery.

LIZA
No you can t spend the summer with 
your cousins in New York.32.


CALLIE
But New York is the center of the 
world!

LIZA
Yes it is.  The world of cigarettes 
and premarital sex.

At the end of the table Frank is in his own universe.

LIZA (CONT D)
They d better work out the plumbing 
by tomorrow.
(off Frank s blank look)
The mixer?  Half the Hill s going 
to be here, and you know how they 
drink.

CALLIE
(back up on the horse)
Aunt Nora says it s fine.  I d have 
my own room and everything.  Five 
blocks from the Metropolitan 
Museum.

FRANK
The Colonel would never let you go.

Callie blinks at his finality, stung.

CALLIE
Why are we here in the first place?

Callie stands abruptly, her plate CRASHING to the floor.

CALLIE (CONT D)
Everything s a secret!  It s 
Kafkaesque!

She storms upstairs.  Frank and Liza watch her go.  He turns 
to her, trying at levity.

FRANK
At least she s reading.

Liza sits in silence as he picks at his casserole.  Outside 
looking in.



Muffled plinking of a piano from the next apartment.  Abby is 
on the sofa in her peignoir, nerves raw.  At the sound of the 
front door she bolts upright.33.


ABBY
Thank God.  I was going to call the 
police, but there s no telephone in 
this place.

Charlie enters, dead drunk, and plants his  signing bonus  on 
the table.  The whiskey bottle is half-empty.

Abby picks up the bottle as he weaves to the bathroom and 
pisses with the door open.

ABBY (CONT D)
This is daddy s brand.  You can t 
get it anymore.

CHARLIE
Can if your work s got triple-A 
priority.

ABBY
Are you drunk?  What happened?  
Charlie, talk to me.

He stares at his wife, stricken: wishing he could tell her, 
knowing he can t.  And like that, the POWER CUTS OUT.

Pitch black.  Charlie moves to the window, tripping on a lamp.

ABBY (CONT D)
Charlie?

CHARLIE
It s the whole block.

Charlie looks out at the darkness as Abby retreats to the sofa.  
He seems to have aged ten years in one day.

CHARLIE (CONT D)
You know how many people live in 
Berlin?  4,332,000.

Abby shakes her head, baffled.  Moves on.

ABBY
I wrote a letter to my father.  I 
said you d think about his offer.

CHARLIE
Jesus, Abby.

ABBY
Ed Vogler is daddy s best salesman, 
and he used to be a chemist.34.


CHARLIE
He ran a pharmacy.  It s different.  
This is what I am.

ABBY
You re a loving father to our 
children.  And my handsome husband.

CHARLIE
What else?

He sits next to Abby, opens her peignoir.  

ABBY
Charlie!

The creak of the sofa springs is tremendous.  She playfully 
fends him off, finger to her lips.

CHARLIE
The twins are probably out cold.

ABBY
It s not the twins I m worried 
about.

She looks pointedly at the wall.  Muffled VOICES and PIANO 
MUSIC drift from next door.

CHARLIE
Give  em something to put in our 
FBI file.

Springs groan as he climbs on top of her.  Abby laughs.



Frank enters to find Liza engrossed in a book, FLOWERS OF THE 
AMERICAN WEST.  Nearby, in a bud vase, is the YELLOW 
CHRYSANTHEMUM she cut this morning.

LIZA
I give up.
(off Frank)
The flower.  It s supposed to be 
violet.

Frank frowns, curious: an effect of radiation?  He quickly 
covers.

FRANK
So it s a hybrid.35.


Liza shakes her head, flipping pages, obsessed.

LIZA
Must be something in the soil...

FRANK
Sometimes a flower is just a 
flower.

Liza sees that he s holding his COAT.  Doesn t say a word.  

FRANK (CONT D)
Don t wait up.
(off Liza)
When it s over we ll go anywhere 
you want.  Find a desert island, 
play Adam and Eve.

He kisses her cheek.  Sad little smile from Liza.

LIZA
This is a desert island.



Technical documents spread across the desk.  Frank switches 
on a crystal radio receiver, a Glenn Miller waltz filling the 
room.  He works the dial, tuning in...STATIC.

White noise washes from the speakers as Frank slips on 
reading glasses.  We see pages of numbers: Kilotons, burn 
radii.  The calculus of mass destruction.36.



CLOSE ON the dial of a Geiger counter, needle flickering.  

The junior scientists, all wielding counters, sweep the room 
for I-Group s missing files -- except Crosley, busy rooting 
through storage crates.

LIAO
So what s the over-under under on 
Frank s explosive lenses?

FRITZ
I got a buck says we save  em ten 
days.

MEEKS
You honestly think we re gonna 
outflank Reed Akley and a staff of 
six hundred by ten days.

FRITZ
Honestly?  I think we re gonna beat 
 em by twenty.  But I m spineless, 
so my money s on ten.

CROSLEY
Well my money s on Akley.

Fritz watches Crosley pulling RATIONED GOODS from a crate.

FRITZ
Is that Belgian chocolate?

CROSLEY
I told you, it s like Fort Knox in 
here.

Liao eyes the growing pile of loot at Crosley s feet.

LIAO
The hell do you want with ladies  
nylons?

Crosley looks at him like he s an idiot.

CROSLEY
They re rationed.

MEEKS
So?37.


CROSLEY
Girls love  em, girls can t get 
 em.  I spread the wealth, they 
spread their --

SKKKKREEEEEKKKKK!  Meeks s Geiger counter SCREAMS: Jackpot.

HELEN
Thank god.  What time is it?



Arms full of FILES, Helen and Meeks plead their case as the 
Computers fix their makeup and head for the door.

COMPUTER 1
No dice, we re punched out for the 
night.

HELEN
We need the calculations by 
tomorrow.  We ll never finish on 
our own.

COMPUTER 2
(tough luck)
They re showing Yankee Doodle Dandy 
at the mess hall.

The computers brush past them.

HELEN
We can pay you.

She signals to Crosley in the doorway.  He glares at her, 
peevish.  Finally caves, unfurling a pair of STOCKINGS.

Off the computers, won over by black-market nylons.



Parked outside the house.  He unclips his security badge, 
locks it in the glove box.



Frank wearily doffs his coat.  Follows O.S. MUSIC to

THE LIVING ROOM38.


Mills Brothers   You Always Hurt the One You Love  crackling 
on the phonograph.  With surprise, Frank notes a light on, 
Liza s hand visible on the armrest of her reading chair.  
Asleep?  He comes up from behind, reaches out to wake her --

But it s not Liza in the chair.  It s a MANNEQUIN.  Vacant 
blue eyes, cherry smile.  Disturbed, he turns, discovering  --

ANGLE -- the DINING ROOM

AN INFERNO.  Flames hurtling up the walls, swallowing a 
family of HAPPY MANNEQUINS at the table.  It s uncannily 
SILENT.  The dummies sit placidly as their water glasses boil 
over, as the wallpaper blackens and curls, and --



Frank wakes at his desk.  Room awash in FM static.  Helen s 
in the doorway with a cup of coffee.  She knocks.

HELEN
We should finish by morning if 
Crosley can keep his hands off the 
Computers.

She sets the coffee on the desk.  Frank gathers himself.

FRANK
The lenses ought to be hexagons.  
It ll save a few days.  Give it to 
the Computers, I ll write it up. 

Helen nods.  Then lingers a moment too long, looking at Frank 
amid a sea of technical diagrams.  An awkward energy.

FRANK (CONT D)
Anything else?

She shakes her head and leaves.  Frank begins to TYPE.



Liza wakes alone.  She looks at the empty space beside her,  
Frank s side of the bed untouched.



Liza pads in to find the bouquets she cut yesterday dead and 
wizened in their waterless vases.



Brutally hungover, Charlie tails Lancefield down a busy hall 
on his first day of work.  Lancefield hands him a thick a red-
bound document: THE THIN MAN PRIMER. 

LANCEFIELD
That s your bible, learn it chapter 
and verse.  Oh, and keep this in 
your pocket.

He slips what looks like a metal PEN in Charlie s shirt pocket.

CHARLIE
What is it?

LANCEFIELD
A dosimeter.  Radiation, purely pro 
forma.  They take your security 
papers?

CHARLIE
And a blood test, and a cup of 
urine.  I thought they were going 
to ask me for my firstborn.

LANCEFIELD
Give  em time.

Then drops Charlie at at --40.



Where a half-dozen Brylcreemed NEOPHYTES sit hunched around a 
table like an Ivy-League study group.

LANCEFIELD
Bone up gentlemen.  It ll all be 
covered on the test.

A YOUNG SCIENTIST eyeballs Charlie as he finds a seat and 
cracks the primer.  After a beat.

YOUNG SCIENTIST
Hey, you re the guy, right?
(turns to neighbor)
He s the guy.
(off Charlie s confusion)
 A New Approach to Quantum 
Cosmology. 

They all stare.  Charlie s a minor celebrity here -- admired, 
resented.  Sweating out whisky.  Another NEWBIE pipes up.

NEWBIE
You believe this place?

YOUNG SCIENTIST
Hope the Brits have good umbrellas.  
It s gonna be raining Fr uleins in 
Picadilly Square.

The room cracks up.  Charlie looks like he s going to puke.



Equipment looted, shelves bare.  Frank enters, finding Liao 
alone at the window.

LIAO
All that barbed wire.  Is it 
supposed to keep spies out or the 
rest of us in?

FRANK
You need to keep it together.

Liao turns, all bravado gone. 42.


LIAO
They re gonna draft me.  They re 
gonna send me to the war.

FRANK
If they knew who took the X-rays, 
they d have done it already.

Liao pulls out a PHOTO, hands it to Frank.

LIAO
I ve got a kid back in Oakland, a 
daughter.  Four months old, I ve 
never even held her.  This place... 
I can t hack it.  You gotta get me 
transferred.

Frank considers the PHOTO: a pretty Chinese girl with a baby.

FRANK
You remember Young s Experiment?  
Shine a beam of light through two 
slits, what do you get?

LIAO
...A diffraction pattern.

FRANK
Which means that light is a wave.  
But light s also a particle.  
Everything we know tells us that it 
can t be both -- it s impossible --  
but there it is.
(firm)
I don t care what you are outside 
this building -- a husband, a 
father.  You leave it behind when 
you walk in the door.

BABBIT (O.S.)
Frank.

Babbit s in the doorway looking grim.

BABBIT (CONT D)
Paul Crosley just walked into the 
Colonel s office.



The computers have finished their calculations.  Meeks holds 
the final page, blinking at the math as if it s written in 
Cyrillic.43.


MEEKS
It can t be right.  Did you remember 
to double-check --

COMPUTER
It s right.

Meeks stares at the paper in confusion.

Then spins on his heels and TAKES OFF.  Sound DROPPING AWAY 
as he sprints down the hall with the page of calculations, 
jostling scientists and soldiers.



Vast and full of maps.  A wide observation window surveys the 
tech area.  Crosley nervously faces the Colonel across a 
leather-top desk.

CROSLEY
I know who took them.  But if I 
tell you... Well no one likes a 
snitch.  Maybe you could get me a 
spot in Akley s group?

Before Cox can answer, Frank BULLDOZES into the room.

FRANK
Crosley, get back to work.

COX
Keep your seat.
(to Frank)
Mr. Crosley came to me as a 
concerned citizen.  One of your 
boys stole classified files.  I d 
like a name.

FRANK
So you can ship him to Guadalcanal?

COX
For every action, an opposite 
reaction.

FRANK
Equal and opposite.

Crosley would chew his own arm off to get out of here.44.


COX
When I took this post, they told me 
ten of you wonderboys would end the 
war in half a year.  That was 1942, 
back when I still had hair.  Now 
Hitler s got rockets and I ve got a 
standing Wednesday breakfast with 
the ladies of the garden committee.

CROSLEY
(obsequious)
The wives always look forward to 
those breakfasts.

FRANK
You packed six thousand people into 
a camp zoned for six hundred.  
We re cut off from the world, 
locked in a barbed-wire dust bowl, 
no visitors, no telephones --

COX
This is not a pleasure cruise.

FRANK
It s the Titanic.  You ve got the 
fastest-growing city in America 
sitting on the biggest secret in 
history.  Believe me when I tell 
you, you don t want to start a 
witch hunt.

COX
(to Crosley)
Get out.

Relieved, Crosley hotfoots out the door.  Cox regards Frank 
coolly.

COX (CONT D)
There s a leak in this lab.  Someone 
has been smuggling technical 
schematics off the Hill.  

Frank processes, speechless.

COX (CONT D)
Our enemy crawled out of a cave on 
the other side of the earth and 
attacked us on our own soil, and 
they ll do it again.  We will not 
hand them the tools.45.


Cox opens a file on his desk.  Three security head shots: 
FRITZ, MEEKS, LIAO.

COX (CONT D)
It s one-in-three odds.  You can t 
help your man.  But you can help 
yourself.

FRANK
He s not a spy.

COX
That s not for you to decide.

The Colonel offers Frank a cigarette.  Frank waves it off.

COX (CONT D)
You persist in seeing me as an 
obstacle.  You ll find I m more 
useful as a friend.  I know we ve 
shut down your group.

The implicit offer hangs in the air.

FRANK
You think I d horse-trade a member 
of my team?

COX
Iactura paucorum serva multos.  We 
sacrifice the few to save the many.

From O.S., the sounds of a scuffle as --

SOLDIER (O.S.)
Hey -- you can t --

THWACK!  Meeks just SLAPPED the page of calculations against 
the tempered-glass observation window.

ON THE PAPER.  At the bottom, red-circled: 12.

Frank holds Meek s wide-eyed gaze through the glass.  No 
longer aware of the Colonel.  Aware of nothing but the number 
on the page.  Opening the door.

FRANK
Twelve days.

MEEKS
(shakes his head)
Twelve weeks.46.



Frank crosses the floor at an urgent clip.  Meeks hands him a 
sheaf of papers.

MEEKS
Just the one set.
(off Frank)
Fritz -- Phi Beta Kappa and he 
can t work a copier.

Oppenheimer s Secretary looks up from a deluge of paperwork 
as they approach.  The office behind her is empty.

SECRETARY
He s already down in the car.  
You ll have to wait and see him 
when he s back from D.C.

FRANK
I ll ride out with him.
(cutting off her protest)
There s room.



On the sleekly upholstered backseat, a PORK PIE HAT.

Beside it, in a tweed suit and a cloud of cigarette smoke, is 
OPPENHEIMER.  Part Prometheus, part Oz.  He s 40 but could be 
100.  A gaunt Buddha with unearthly ice-blue eyes and nicotine-
stained fingers.  A genius s genius, revered and feared.

Frank sits opposite, back to two SOLDIERS in the front seat.  
He cranes, surprised, as the limo forks off the main road.

FRANK
I thought we were going to the 
airport.

OPPENHEIMER
Lamy train depot.  The General s 
seen fit to ground me.  Too 
dangerous to fly -- isn t that 
right, Tommy?

Up front, the soldiers are stone.47.


OPPENHEIMER (CONT D)
Very touching, their concern for my 
health.

He stubs out his Chesterfield, immediately lighting a fresh 
one.  Picks up Frank s implosion brief and scans the pages.  

Frank watches, expectant.  Oppenheimer s eyes flick from the 
brief to Frank then back again.  Surprised?  Impressed?

FRANK
It s all been road-tested and 
triple-checked.

Oppenheimer lingers on the final page.  Power in his silence.  
Then turns to the primordial landscape outside.

OPPENHEIMER
This country, the Valles Caldera. 
We call it a desert, but it s a 
crematorium.  The mesas, all of it  
-- fallout from a volcano that 
exploded a million and a half years 
ago.  Someday it ll detonate again, 
and everything you see will be 
buried.  Just a question of time.
(smokes)
There are forces beyond our 
control.  And the United States 
Army is one of them.

He regards Frank -- unblinking, inscrutable.

OPPENHEIMER (CONT D)
We re building Akley s bomb.  
They ve briefed the OSRD.  OSRD 
briefed the S-1 Committee and S-1 
briefed the president.  The ship 
has sailed.

ON FRANK, reeling.

FRANK
Well turn it around.
(re papers)
This war chews up seventeen 
American servicemen every hour.  I 
just handed you 40,000 lives.

OPPENHEIMER
Do you know the Bhagavad Gita?  
 Man is made by his belief.  As he 
believes, so he is.   The army 
believes in the Thin Man.48.


FRANK
I don t care about the army.

OPPENHEIMER
And that s your mistake.
(to driver)
Tommy?

The limo judders to a stop at the roadside.  Oppenheimer 
opens the car door.  Frank looks at him, disoriented, then 
reluctantly disembarks to --



A ROW OF ANONYMOUS NUMBERS.

Before Charlie, a landslide of technical documents.

As the other neophytes flip pages and gossip, he sits, brow 
knit, reading and rereading the same paragraph.  A splinter 
of doubt, an itch he can t scratch.

NEWBIE
You hear the Implosion Group s 
throwing a mixer tonight?

YOUNG SCIENTIST
I hear the Implosion Group s 
imploding.49.


 Charlie looks up at his new colleagues.

CHARLIE
You notice anything about the math 
in section nine?

NEOPHYTE
If it had tits, I d marry it.

Charlie studies the page.  Grabs his things and hurries out.



Charlie catches Akley filing into an office with a pack of 
INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS.

CHARLIE
Dr. Akley --

AKLEY
Not just now, Charlie.

CHARLIE
I think we may have a problem.

Akley smiles indulgently for the benefit of the officers.  
Guides Charlie to a private corner.

CHARLIE (CONT D)
Back at Harvard, I ran a study --

AKLEY
(not listening)
Did you finish the Primer?

CHARLIE
I didn t have to --

Akley s smile has flatlined.  A man who can turn off his old-
boy charm like a light switch.

AKLEY
Do you know what I used to tell my 
students?  If you re behind in the 
reading, don t call out in class.  
In this lab, we have a chain of 
command.  If you re confused, you 
talk to your group leader.

He starts back toward the officers.50.


CHARLIE
Is it true there s a group that s 
working on implosion?  Wouldn t 
that be more efficient?

Akley turns, regards Charlie coldly.

AKLEY
Let me ask you something.  Did you 
study axial chemistry at Harvard?
(silence)
What about the Clark Effect?  
Variation Theory?

Charlie has never heard of them.

AKLEY (CONT D)
Because they ve all been disproved.  
Those are Frank Winter s 
contributions -- stillborn ideas.  
He s a carnival barker.  But you re 
not...are you?

Shut down, Charlie watches Akley rejoin the officers.



Looking lost, Frank descends to his office.  Babbit s coming 
down the hall with a cardboard box of personal effects.  One 
look at Frank s face tells Babbit that hope is gone.

FRANK
Where are you going?

BABBIT
Chicago.  Colonel s shipping me 
offsite.

FRANK
(stunned)
The rest of the group?

BABBIT
Scattered to the wind.
(rueful smile)
You made an impression.



Frank walks in heavily, looks at his desk buried in files and 
books, the accumulated paperwork of the implosion group.  
Cups of coffee.  Radio receiver.51.


In one motion, he sweeps all of it onto the floor.



Charlie pauses at the door, looking in.  Frank is at the desk 
with a drink and the red-bound THIN MAN PRIMER cracked in 
front of him.  Eyes glued to the page:

FRANK
What?

CHARLIE
Frank Winter?  Charlie Bell.

He enters, extends his hand.  Frank doesn t look up.

CHARLIE (CONT D)
I was hoping I could... I think I d 
like to join your group.

Frank s a glacier.  Charlie notices the wreckage on the floor 
and falters a little.  Maybe he s made a mistake.

CHARLIE (CONT D)
(selling himself)
I wrote a paper --

FRANK
 A New Approach to Quantum 
Cosmology.   Your approach isn t 
new.  It s Pablum.

CHARLIE
The judges of the Forbes Prize 
didn t think so.

FRANK
They wouldn t.

He finally looks up, takes in Charlie s disappointment.52.


FRANK (CONT D)
You can t join my group because it 
doesn t exist.  You ll do fine.  
You re Akley s golden boy, right?

Charlie hesitates.  A flash of instinct.  He takes Frank s 
copy of the Primer, flips to section nine, hands it back.

CHARLIE
Akley s calculations are wrong.  
Reactor-bred plutonium contains PU-
240.

Now, for the first time, he s got Frank s attention.

CHARLIE (CONT D)
I ran a study in grad school, 
isotope modeling in transuranic 
metals.  Dean said I couldn t 
publish till after the war.  Now I 
know why.
(beat)
It s eighteen percent.

And it s okay if this flies right past us -- it should.  
Frank s look tells us it s fucking important.

FRANK
You remember a percentage from a 
study you ran, what -- a year ago?

CHARLIE
Almost three.

Who is this kid?

CHARLIE (CONT D)
I like numbers, they stick in my 
head.
(off Frank s doubt)
Four days ago I stopped for lunch 
at a hamburger shack outside 
Toledo, Ohio.  I can tell you the 
mile marker on Route 24.  I can 
tell you the license plate of the 
Studebaker parked out front, half 
the prices on the menu.

Frank looks from the Primer to Charlie.

FRANK
Eighteen percent.  You re sure.53.


CHARLIE
(nods)
It means their schedule s off.  
It s gonna set them back months.

Frank is already up from the desk, heading for the door.

FRANK
That s not what it means.



Frank stands in the middle of the buzzing hive, at a 
crossroads.  WORKERS weaving so as not to bowl him over.

He looks across the room at --

ANGLE - OPPENHEIMER S OFFICE

Abandoned, lights out.  Oppenheimer s secretary pecking away 
at some memo.

RESUME - FRANK

Decision in his face.  Frank turns, moving in the other 
direction, moving inexorably.



Cox looks up from a telex, sees Frank in the doorway.  No 
love lost between these men.  Frank enters the office, dark-
eyed.  Shuts the door behind him.

FRANK
I want your word you won t send him 
to the front.



Charlie enters, passes through the kitchen.  There s a 
NEWSPAPER on the counter.  Bombs in Vienna, Nazis in Hungary.

More newspaper spread on the floor.  It s covered with HAIR.

Charlie stares, follows the sound of VOICES to the --

LIVING ROOM

-- where Joey and Judy sprawl, glued to a Buck Rogers serial 
on the radio, both their HEADS freshly SHAVED.



Abby, full throttle, filling her suitcase.  Charlie enters.

CHARLIE
What the hell did you do?

ABBY
They re reading our mail.

CHARLIE
What?

ABBY
(still packing)
The children have head lice and -- 
they re reading our mail!

CHARLIE
They re five years old.  They can 
barely write their names.

ABBY
That s not what I --

She snatches up a LETTER, waves it in his face.55.


ABBY (CONT D)
I mailed this yesterday.  A private 
letter, from me to my father.  They 
made notes in the margins --

CHARLIE
Who did?

ABBY
-- like a teacher correcting a 
test.  I don t know who -- spies!  
The army!

CHARLIE
Abigail --

ABBY
This place -- they re all crazy!  
We can t stay here, I won t --

CHARLIE
-- you re hysterical --

ABBY
I m not allowed to tell him where 
we live, Charles!  I m not allowed 
to tell him that our house is 
painted green!  My own father!

CHARLIE
It s going to take some adjustment, 
that s all.

She s still flying, filling the bag, opening a drawer.

ABBY
We can go home, back to Brookline.  
Stay with my parents till we ve 
sorted things out.

Charlie SLAMS the drawer SHUT.

CHARLIE
We re not going anywhere.  Listen 
to me.  This is our home.  I made a 
commitment, it s done.  We re here 
till the end of the war.

All air sucked out of the room.  She sits on the bed, 
reeling.  Finally looks up at him and pales.

His nose is bleeding.  He touches it, looks at his hand, 
trembling a little.56.


CHARLIE (CONT D)
It s the altitude.
(then)
Put a dress on.  We re going to a 
mixer.

ABBY
Where?

CHARLIE
Siberia.

Charlie leaves her in the room, shattered, 2500 miles from 
the only life she knows.



Liza s putting on lipstick.  She looks up when Frank stalks in.

LIZA
You nearly missed your own party.

FRANK
Call it off.

LIZA
What?

FRANK
Cancel the party.

LIZA
It s ten of eight.  We haven t got 
a telephone.

Frank full of a roiling darkness, hating what he s done.

FRANK
Nobody s in the mood for canapes.  
You re gonna have to learn to trust 
me.

Liza watches him yank off his tie.  A floodgate opened.

LIZA
You waltz in and out of this house 
like a tenant.  I turn around, 
you re gone.  I wake up in the 
night, you re gone.  Even when 
you re here, you re someplace else.  
You want to talk about trust?57.


FRANK
Everything I m doing I m doing for --

LIZA
(over)
Yourself.  Your career.

FRANK
I m protecting our family.

LIZA
From what?

Silence.  The weight of secrets bearing down.

LIZA (CONT D)
You re all alone and you don t even 
see it.

A long fraught moment.  Then -- the DOORBELL.



Teeming with SCIENTISTS, bubbly WIVES, the odd ARMY OFFICER,  
all well-lubricated, and the party s just begun.  Sprung from 
the lab they re like sailors on shore leave.

Charlie and Abby edge through the scrum.  Abby spots Fay, 
May, and Mary-Ellen and shrinks as Charlie scans the room.

CHARLIE
I ll be right back.

ABBY
Where are you going?

CHARLIE
To find out where I stand.

He leaves Abby in a sea of strange faces.

ANGLE ON: Crosley, Meeks, Fritz and Helen drinking in a corner, 
holding slips of paper: their new assignments.

CROSLEY
Ten months.  I m finally used to 
the desert air, they ship me to 
Hanford to study  effects of 
radiation on salmon reproduction.   
Fish sex.58.


FRITZ
Beats the Chickasaw Ordnance Works.  
They re sending my ass to Tennessee.

MEEKS
Holy shit -- Liao.

They re stunned to see Sid Liao walking in wearing crisp army 
KHAKIS, a drafted man.

MEEKS (CONT D)
Hey!  Sid!

Liao looks at them, hollow-eyed.  Then looks away.  Cold air.

HELEN
(to Crosley)
What did you do?

CROSLEY
Nothing!

ON FRANK, emptying a RUM BOTTLE into the punch bowl, a three-
foot lab REAGENT JAR.  He s distracted, watching his daughter 
flirt with a spit-shined G-2 OFFICER (40s) across the room.

Charlie fords the crowd, arriving at Frank s side.

CHARLIE
Dr. Winter --

Eyes locked on Callie, Frank hands Charlie the rum bottle.

FRANK
Excuse me.

Snubbed, Charlie sets the bottle down.

We follow Frank across the room to Callie and the Officer.  
He plucks a wine glass out of her tipsy hand.

CALLIE
Mister Norris was just telling me 
he grew up in New York City.

FRANK
Lieutenant Norris.

OFFICER
It was Scarsdale actually.

CALLIE
We re not prisoners here, are we?  
Because my father says --59.


FRANK
Callie was just heading up to bed.

CALLIE
It s eight thirty!

He takes her arm, steers her out of the room.  The Officer 
eyes them as they leave.



Frank, returning to the fray, comes face to face with...

FRANK
Liao.

Liao looks awkward in his starched uniform.  They re alone.

LIAO
Looks like I got that transfer 
after all.  Oh-six-hundred hours.

Liao tries for a smile, but his life is caving in.

LIAO (CONT D)
Maybe if you talked to the 
Colonel... Maybe he d listen...

FRANK
I m sorry.  Keep your head down, 
you ll be all right.

LIAO
It was Crosley wasn t it?

 Frank looks at him, pained.

FRANK
Let s get you a drink.

Liao hoists his full glass, downs it.  Turns to rejoin the 
party.



Frank gathers himself, avoiding his eyes in the mirror.  He 
turns on the faucet: CLANKING, then WATER.  But it s RUST-
RED.  He stands there, filthy water roaring in the sink.60.



Smokier, louder, one drink away from chaos.  Liao s at the 
bar, staring daggers at Crosley.  He drains his drink, 
refills it, jostling a young CORPORAL.

CORPORAL
Hey.  How  bout a salute?

Liao raises his middle finger, cocks it to his brow.

ACROSS THE ROOM Abby s struggling to be social, talking with 
a HOUSEWIFE (28, sorority poise).

HOUSEWIFE
I hear you all had fun last night.

An insinuating smile.  Abby swallows her mortification.

HOUSEWIFE (CONT D)
Your husband must be important to 
rate a place on Snob Hollow.
(off Abby s blank look)
The four-plexes by the golf course.  
That s what they call them.

ABBY
(trying)
It s really not a bad apartment, 
except for the thin walls.

HOUSEWIFE
I know.  It used to be ours.
(tight smile)
Sooner or later Reed Akley will 
find a new lap dog and you ll be 
out on your asses like we were.

She smokes, smiles, moves on.  Abby drowning, until --

LIZA
Don t take it personally.

Liza appears at her side like a lifeline.

LIZA (CONT D)
Most of these women, if you gave 
them a Formica kitchen and a 
husband with tenure, they d die 
happy.

ABBY
I think I ought to sit down.61.


LIZA
It s the altitude.  Takes an hour 
to boil an egg but one drink and 
you re higher than Lindbergh.  I ll 
get us two more.

AT THE BAR, Liao has Crosley cornered.  Tempers redlining.

CROSLEY
I told you, I didn t say a goddamn 
word.

Crosley tries to extract himself, but Liao s got him by the 
arm.  They trade shoves, the young Corporal intervening.

CORPORAL
Hey --

The Corporal seizes Liao s shoulder -- Liao takes a wild 
swing at him -- Corporal lands a jab to Liao s chin, and --

CRASH!  Liao collides with the bar, booze and glass raining 
down.  He sprawls amid the wreckage.

The party at a sudden grinding halt, staring as the Corporal 
tries to help him up.

LIAO
Get your fucking hands off me.

Terrible silence as he clambers to his feet.

LIAO(CONT D)
All you good people... You ve got 
your heads in the sand.

The crowd looking on, ashen-faced.  Some looking away.

LIAO (CONT D)
What the hell s the matter with 
you?  You send your kids to school 
right next to it.  You lie to your 
wives about it --

The Corporal and another soldier haul Liao out of the party.  
Somebody puts on a dance record.  Talk and laughter pave over 
the silence.

ON ABBY, shaken, Charlie at her side.  What the fuck just 
happened?  Before either can speak, they re joined by:

FRANK
(to Charlie)
Be out front in two minutes.62.



Crosley, Fritz, Meeks, Helen and Babbit follow Frank down the 
dim hall.  The junior scientists are worked up.  Charlie tags 
along, odd man out.

MEEKS
Liao s right.  He s right.

CROSLEY
Liao s blotto.  And an ass.
(re Charlie)
What s with Little Lord Fauntleroy?

FRITZ
I ll tell you what Liao is: fucked.  
Royally.  So are the rest of us. 

BABBIT
That s enough.

They arrive at the Implosion Office.  Frank unlocks the door.

FRITZ
I get drafted, I m a dead man.

HELEN
You d never see combat.

FRITZ
I m talking about my wife.

CHA-CHUKK as the office lights shudder on.  The junior 
scientists stare in silence as Frank ushers them into --



Completely transformed since the last time we saw it.  Files 
and books neatly ranged on shelves.  Equipment restored.  Two 
new state-of-the-art IBM MULTIPLIERS.  The junior scientists 
amazed by the spoils of Frank s horse trade.

MEEKS
Whoa...63.


FRANK
Do your work, nobody else gets 
drafted.  And no one gets 
transferred.

HELEN
What is all this?

FRANK
Our group s been reinstated.

They look at him, unsure what it means or how to feel.

CROSLEY
You want to go down with the 
implosion ship, god bless.  I ll 
take the lifeboat.

He eyes the others.  Fuck it.

CROSLEY (CONT D)
Our group is a punchline.  How am I 
the only one that knows that?

FRITZ
Frank, we ve got families.

CROSLEY
And careers.  Sooner or later, the 
war s gonna end.  Akley s guys, 
they can publish.

FRANK
You ll publish anyplace you want.

CROSLEY
I appreciate the vote of 
confidence, but --

FRANK
I m confident because I know 
something you don t.  Akley s bomb 
won t work.  Not with factory 
plutonium.

CROSLEY
What?

FRITZ
Akley ran the numbers.

FRANK
For pure PU-239.64.


CROSLEY
You re splitting hairs.

FRANK
No, we re splitting atoms.  PU-239 
is the most unstable substance on 
the planet.  Four years ago, the 
entire world s supply fit in a 
cigar box at Berkeley, and the army 
thinks they can churn it out like 
instant coffee.
(spelling it out)
Reactor-bred plutonium runs dirty.  
It s full of PU-240, which has a 
spontaneous fission rate --

MEEKS
(holy shit)
-- forty thousand times too high.

CHARLIE
(realizing)
It ll pre-detonate.

Frank nods to Charlie.

FRANK
In a month, we ll get samples from 
the Clinton reactor and everyone 
else will see it too.  Thin Man is 
dead.

CROSLEY
Jesus Christ.

Frank looks around the room.  Asking for their faith.

FRANK
This isn t a thought experiment.  
It s not a theory.  The outcome of 
the war is going to be decided by 
seven people, and they re standing 
in this room.

The faces of the junior scientists as they try to grapple 
with this burden.  Charlie stands apart, staring at a huge 
BLUEPRINT of the implosion bomb pinned to the wall.

At the top of the blueprint is the bomb s code name: FAT MAN.65.



Frank draws curtains over the blackboards.  The group has 
left.  He turns to go, finds Charlie waiting in the hall.

CHARLIE
What about the next war?  What 
happens when Stalin s got one, and 
China, and the Shah of Iran?

He searches Frank s face for reassurance. 

CHARLIE (CONT D)
Do you know the story of the Golem?  
A Rabbi wanted to protect the Jews 
of Prague, so he built an automaton 
out of mud and he brought it to 
life.  First the Golem killed the 
enemies of the Jews... Then it 
turned on the Jews themselves.  
See, he couldn t control it.  He d 
built Frankenstein s monster.

A beat, the two men alone in the basement.

FRANK
You re going to have doubts.  Don t 
bring them in here.

CHARLIE
Is that advice or an order?

Frank smiles, extends his hand.

FRANK
Welcome to Manhattan.

They shake.  Not yet friends, barely colleagues.  Two men who 
will reinvent the world.  As Charlie makes his way out, Frank 
turns to hit the lights, his eye falling on a PHOTO on a desk.

SID LIAO S WIFE AND BABY DAUGHTER.

He picks it up.  A long beat.  Frank doubting everything.  
Silencing the doubt.



Charlie stands in darkness in the threshold of his children s 
bedroom.  Twins tucked safely in their beds.  An oasis of 
peace in an unimaginably dangerous world.

He moves to the living room, sits.  Akley s KENTUCKY BOURBON 
open on the table.   All at once --

LIGHTS are blazing, and the room is full of MUSIC.  Charlie 
blinks, disoriented.  End of another blackout.  The voice on 
the RADIO is BING CROSBY s, and the song is the most popular 
record in the country,  DON T FENCE ME IN.   The music rises 
as we move to --



BING CROSBY
Let me ride through the wide open 
country that I love / Don t fence 
me in

CLOSE ON a .45 pistol.  It s on the car seat next to Liao.  
He steers toward the MAIN GATE.  CARS queuing up to the exit.67.


From Liao s POV through the rain-slick windshield we see a GI 
approach the window of a FORD at the front of the line.  He 
studies the driver s PASS.  Then nods, and his partner raises 
the gate.  The Ford disappears into the night.

Down goes the gate.  The line of cars pulls forward.  Thirty 
yards from freedom.  Liao tests the accelerator, jaw set.  
Fear fighting with resolve.



BING CROSBY
Let me be by myself in the evenin  
breeze / And listen to the murmur 
of the cottonwood trees

Spartan as a monk s cell.  Helen enters, locks the door behind 
her, and opens her handbag, revealing a BOX OF NYLONS.

She lifts the lid, folds back tissue paper.  Nestled within, 
like treasure, are three coveted pairs of stockings.  She 
removes the nylons and sets them aside indifferently.

There s something else in the box: a sheet of FOLDED PAPER.  
She spreads it out on the bed.  It s a TECHNICAL SCHEMATIC of 
the IMPLOSION BOMB.



BING CROSBY
Send me off forever, but I ask you 
please / Don t fence me in

Lashing rain.  Liao second in line.  The GI at the window of 
the lead car nods to his partner.  Up goes the gate.

This is Liao s moment.  He hits the gas.  But before he can 
tail the lead car off the Hill, the gate slams down.

GI
Whoa, buddy.  This ain t the Indy 
500.  You gotta show me your pass.
(seeing Liao)
No tickee no washee.

Liao stares ahead through the windshield, gun in his hand, 
hand in his lap.  His hand is shaking.

In Liao s POV, we watch taillights recede and wink out on the 
far side of the gate.  So close to freedom he can taste it.68.


LIAO
(low)
Open the gate.

The GI looks at his partner, hunkered against the weather, 
sensing something wrong.

GI
Step out of the car, will ya?

LIAO
Open the gate.

The GI leans in, sees the gun leveled at his chest.

GI
The fuck are you --

BLAMMM!  The passenger window explodes!

ANGLE ON the second GI, gun outstretched.

It s our freckled Iowan newcomer.  We ll come to know him as 
PRIVATE COLE DUNLAVEY.  Only child of elderly parents, writer 
of science fiction stories, huge hearted.  For now, he s just 
a scared kid a long way from home.  He drops the gun.

COLE
What d I do?

GI opens the car door and Liao half-slumps out onto the wet 
road.  Right side of his head is gone, a mess of red.



BING CROSBY
I want to ride on the ridge where 
the west commences / And gaze at 
the moon till I lose my senses

Parked outside the house.  Frank kills the engine.  He sits 
there, rain drumming the windshield, man in a confessional.  

Still wearing his security badge, he opens the door.



Frank stands amid the wreckage of the party.  It looks like a 
bomb has gone off.  He takes the stairs two by two. 69.



Pitch dark.  Frank enters, turns on a lamp.  Liza sits up in 
bed, disoriented, blinking.  She looks at her husband with 
his security badge, disheveled by rain, haunted.

FRANK
There s something I need to tell 
you.

ON FRANK.  Needing more than anything to talk, to be told 
he s done the right thing.  A beat: seconds.  Years.  Then --

A KLAXON BLARES.  Panicked, discordant.

They both turn to the windows.
