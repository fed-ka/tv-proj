In a gritty industrial area near the Bowery, ten year old KIPPER,
one of the children from the underground, Is rummaging through
boxes of discarded mechanical parts behind a toy factory. He finds
several spare rollerskate wheels, pockets them, and continues
searching until he finds    a skateboard. With the skateboard under
his arm, he hurries off.

2 ANGLE - VACANT LOT 2


As Kipper emerges from the alley he sees a BOY about his
age dashing across a large vacant lot. In the distance we
SEE two MEN pursuing him. The boy looks terror stricken.
He races around a corner.

Kipper follows him. He finds the boy hiding beneath a. parked car,
his face scraped and bruised...

                                        KIPPER
                      (to the Boy)
              They re gonna find you. Come
              on.. !

                            BOY
                      (out of breath)
              Get away!

                                        KIPPER
              Follow me... Hurry!

The Boy scrambles out from under the car. FOLLOW as he and
Kipper rush into another alley. They slip behind a. dumpster
and find a small metal door opening down to a coal chute.
They crawl down the chute.

THE TWO PURSUERS

The men pound around the corner, look around    they move down the
alley. They start checking the dumpsters.

                                      MAN #1
              He s here, somewhere...                                                                                2.

menacing but Cathy doesn t seem frightened.

leads to Catherine, connecting them and keeping them apart.

                      Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,
                Haply I think on thee   and then my state,
                Like to the lark at break of day arising
                From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven s gate;
              For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings
                That then I scorn to change my state with kings...
