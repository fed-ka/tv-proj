he's carrying a piece.
Towne stalls a beat, then self-consciously goes to
Burnett's waistband where he feels a --
TOWNE
Gun!
Both hobby cops instantly withdraw, their own pieces
drawn and leveled on Burnett and Lowrey.

LOWREY
Whoah. You better watch it,
fellahs!
(very slowly)
You know, it would be very bad
if you shot and killed two
helpless pimps and a call girl...
But it would be even worse if you
shot two policemen and their
witness on a stakeout.
Looks pass between the hobby cops.
LOWREY
(slowly turns)
Now I'm reaching slowly for my
shield... very slowly... here it
comes... just about got it...
(reveals his badge)
Ooh, look at that. It's a
detective's shield! All gold and
shiny. A smart fellah wouldn't
fuck with somebody who had one of
these in his pocket. So... Let's
see. I guess that makes us
policemen. And you...
BURNETT
Not.
He shows his shield. Both hobby cops lower their guns,
unsure about what's next. Burnett moves in.
BURNETT
Now, some rent-a-cops have
licenses to carry weapons,
where
others do not. Which might
you
be? You wouldn't happen to
have
those permits handy, would
you?
From the looks on the hobby cops' faces, Julie can see
that they don't.
JULIE
Guess we know the answer to that
one.

De Souza and Towne lay face down and cuffed on the
pavement while the CAMERA LIFTS BACK TO the car.
BURNETT
I bet you miss your wife, kids...
I bet you miss them a whole lot.
LOWREY
I don't worry. They're in good
hands.

212
Sanchez and Ruiz are on protective duty in front of
Burnett's house.
SANCHEZ
Are you kidding, man? Desi was
the brains behind the whole
operation. That's why they
called their company Desilu.
Desi was first. Lucy second.
Get it? Desi-Lu?

FROM STAKEOUT CAR - DAWN
Elliot shutting the door to his little red Civic,
jangling keys as he's hurrying up the walk to the front
door. He looks like he hasn't slept or showered in days.
95.
215
216
Elliot exits the house in a hurry. Hair wet from a
shower and fresh change of clothes. He fumbles with the
keys to his Civic, gets in and drives.
217
218
Tailing scene as Lowrey and Burnett tail Elliot through
morning traffic.
219
219
Lowrey and Burnett's unmarked sedan stops about two
hundred yards from the freighter.
220
220
MORNING
Elliot's out of the car in a flash and crawling aboard
the ship. But as he disappears, Casper appears with his
own pair of binoculars.
221
233
Fouchet shoves Julie into a waiting car. All three bad
guys pile in and the CAR PEELS RUBBER just as Lowrey
makes the doorway. Lowrey doesn't stop. He doesn't
even wait for traffic. In nothing but his underwear,
he appears from the building, turns the corner out the
door, launches into traffic like a shot, spinning off
bumpers, chasing Fouchet's car on foot.
A234
A234
Fouchet's car slides into the intersection and stalled
traffic. To the right: a footbridge. The car swings a
hard right.
234
234
Where a male nurse pushing an old man in a wheelchair are
in the way. SLAM! The nurse tumbles up and into
Fouchet's windshield.

WHEELCHAIR
Empty and spinning.
235
235
Metal pylons imbedded in concrete.
FOUCHET
Out of the car!
The doors fly open and all three are out in the middle
of the stalled traffic, Julie being drug along with
them. The gang cuts down an alley.
236
236
Turns the corner, running up over car roofs and hoods.
He lowers his gun and tries to draw a bead on Fouchet
and the gang. They've got Julie and now they're running.
237
237
Appears behind Lowrey. Lowrey waves him in another
direction. Burnett hauls one way. Lowrey the other.
238
239
Exiting the beauty salon and stumbling through a
crowded cafe runs Fouchet and the gang, mauling their
way through tables and patrons. Lowrey, only moments
behind, pushing his way through the same path.
103.
240
240
Fouchet stops right in the middle. Picks the first
car that's headed for him. Levels a GUN on a taxi cab
and FIRES two quick rounds -- BAM BAM!! The driver of
the car instantly slumps. Ferguson's seen this before.
He's around to the driver's side of the car, pulling the
dead man out and leaving him on the street. Casper and
Fouchet shove Julie inside and they're off again.
241
241
But here comes Burnett. Crossing traffic. He's got no
gun. So he jumps aboard Fouchet's car just as it gets
into gear. The WHEELS SPIN. The CAR LURCHES ahead.
242
INSIDE CAB
242
Ferguson aims his pistol upward. He's about to fire
into the roof when Julie shoves him. GUNSHOTS RING
out sideways.
243
243
BULLETS RIP to either side of Burnett. Then Fouchet
stomps on the brake and Burnett tumbles forward and
onto the pavement.
CLOSE ON BURNETT
He rolls, makes it to one knee.
But his other leg
gives way.
FOUCHET
He sees his chance and GUNS the ENGINE. The cab barrels
at Burnett, who's stuck in the middle of the boulevard,
about to become instant roadkill.
Then --
244
244
From out of nowhere, here comes Lowrey. Dashing out
across the boulevard and snatching his partner from the
deadly grille of the cab.

TAXI CAB
hauls on by. Leaving Burnett and Lowrey in a heap of
their own, both trying to catch their breath.
LOWREY
Don't ever say I wasn't there for
you.
245
245
TAC teams and uniform cops swarm around their cars.
All waiting as Burnett and Lowrey arrive in their
unmarked car. Howard approaches.
HOWARD
It's about fuckin' time.
BURNETT
We lost the girl.
HOWARD
But you found the dope, right?
So let's go get it back.
A bicycle BELL RINGS. Heads turn. And here comes a
BOY on his bike, serpentining his way through the maze
of cars and cops until he gets to Lowrey, Burnett, and
Howard.
BOY
Which one of you's Lowrey?
I got
somethin' for him.
LOWREY
At least I'm me again.
(hand out)
I'm Lowrey.
From his back pocket, the boy extracts a cellular flip
PHONE. He hands it to Lowrey. He presses the power
button and, almost instantly, it RINGS.
LOWREY
(presses send)
Yeah.
This is Lowrey.
246
247
He jolts at the sound of GUNFIRE.
248
249
He's in a vice.
Duty or the girl.
Then --
LOWREY
You twisted motherfucker...
(then...)
Jojo, you sonofabitch. When I get
my hands on you, I swear, I'm gonna
kill you.
(hangs up)
The snitch who tipped us to the
dope lab? Turns out to be a
bogus address.
BURNETT
Bogus address?
HOWARD
How's this? I'll kill the little
prick for you. That's cuz you're
already dead.
(waves at the
troops)
Okay, you guys. Put 'em back in
the lockers.

En masse, all the cops act as if the wind had been
knocked from their sails.

253
Fouchet is supervising the loading of the dope onto three
canvas-backed, military-styled trucks when his CELLULAR
PHONE RINGS. He answers.
FOUCHET
Yes?
254
255
A Florida Power van.
Inside...
256
257
He's surprised to hear from Francine.
FOUCHET
Yes, Francine... What is it?
FRANCINE
Miami P.D.'s called in the D.E.A.
task force. They know the deal's
going down in just two hours. So
they've deployed agents to every
point of entry, airports, marinas,
etc...
FOUCHET
Is that all?
FRANCINE
Yes.
FOUCHET
I'm very pleased, Francine.
You're the best pet I've ever
had.
He hangs up.
258
259
Three trucks making their way through Miami.
260
263
The van cuts across traffic, barely making the ramp which
swirls up onto the bridge.
264

The dope convoy rolls OVER the CAMERA.

As the convoy makes a right turn off the highway onto an
old tar and gravel track.
266
ORANGE CITY

AIRFIELD
The trucks roll toward an old airport which consists of a
small, pilot's terminal and four or so hangars spread out
over the ten acre site.
111.
267
267
Two henchmen for the buyer open the yawning doors of this
massive, five-story hangar to reveal a C-123 cargo
aircraft. The convoy of trucks enters.
268
268
The surveillance van is parked at the side of the road.
269
270
PANNING LEFT AND RIGHT ACROSS the landscape of tall reeds
and distant buildings. Finally he STALLS ON a garbage
truck and its four-man crew rolling dumpsters.
271
272
Rounding the corner from Hangar 3 -- here comes the
garbage truck. CLOSER INSPECTION REVEALS Ruiz and
Sanchez at the helm with both Lowrey and Burnett hanging
from the sides. All of them wear dirty white jumpsuits
and protective masks.
273
273
The two Buyer's henchmen stiffen at the sight of the
oncoming truck. Their hands slip inside their coats to
MP5-Ks slung under their armpits. But --
274
274
It veers and swings over toward two nearby dumpsters.
With Sanchez keeping a wary eye on the two bad guys and
Ruiz to operate the hydraulics, Burnett and Lowrey drop
from the truck and do their best working-for-the-city
amble over to the dumpster. Business as usual. They
wheel it over and position it in front of the two lifting
forks where the garbage appears to be expertly lifted and
dumped into the truck.
CLOSE ON DUMPSTER
As it lowers, the gearing seems to get hung up. The
hydraulics' arms won't work, leaving the dumpster stuck
in the air.
RUIZ AND SANCHEZ
Begin speaking Spanish, one blaming the other for this
fiasco. Angry words. Finally, Ruiz has had enough.
He
tosses down his gloves and hat and begins stomping off
as
if he's just quit his stinking job. He's headed right
for
the henchmen, his mouth moving and spewing and moving
and
spewing. The henchmen look to each other, not knowing
what to think. Ready for anything when --
CLICK CLICK -- GUNS COCKING.
Both Burnett and Lowrey are right behind the henchmen with
guns at the base of their necks.

Mouths shut, feet moving.
Now,

As it lifts once again to the air, this time dumping the
two henchmen into the truck.

Henchmen ready to kill.
Then --
284
FROM EMPTY DUMPSTER
284
Pop up Burnett and Lowrey. MP5-Ks in hand. They BLAZE
the cargo doors and CUT DOWN the rest of the Buyer's
henchmen.
CASPER AND FERGUSON
charge.
GUNS BLASTING.
BULLETS
RIP across the dumpster, moving up into the truck cab.
Ruiz and Sanchez dive and roll to either side.
Meanwhile, the sparks ignite the spilled fuel.
LOWREY
Move it or lose it!
Burnett and Lowrey climb from the dumpster and run.
Casper and Ferguson have a clear shot. They level and
aim, but...
KUH-WHOOM!
The FUEL TANK on the aircraft EXPLODES. The truck drivers
dive for cover. Charging for the open hole in the wall.

As he looks back on the conflagration.
BURNETT
Sanchez and Ruiz...
Then --
FOUCHET WITH JULIE
He yanks her back up onto her feet, wild-eyed.
He's
still got the gun on her.
LOWREY
(hands up for all
the cops to see)
Don't shoot!!! Hold your fire!!!
FOUCHET
Twisting Julie for all to see.
The cops' rifle sights,
all glinting in the sun.
FOUCHET
I'll kill the girl!!!

She finds her feet and runs to Lowrey. Right into his
arms. He holds her tight, but she winces from a nasty
cut on her shoulder.
JULIE
Ow.
This shit really hurts.
LOWREY
Stick around. I'll give you a
bullet to bite.
Finally --
SANCHEZ AND RUIZ
They appear.
Alive and well. Big grins, helping Burnett
to his feet.
Brushing him off.

He gathers them all

BURNETT
Daddy's home!
Behind Burnett appear Lowrey and Julie, arm in arm.
The kids run to...
BURNETT KIDS
Uncle Mike, Uncle Mike.
Then...
BURNETT
Baby!
Theresa framed in the front doorway, looking smashing in
the outfit Lowrey picked out for her. Burnett ambles up
the walk into her arms. They hug and kiss, Theresa
tossing a wink Lowrey's way.
LOWREY
Manana, partner. Peace. Okay,
kids. Pile in. And watch the
leather and windows this time?
JULIE
You got a real way with kids,
Lowrey.
LOWREY
You see anybody complaining?
BURNETT
Hey.
Where are the kids goin'?
THERESA
Didn't you know? We got us a new
babysitter.
She kisses him.
