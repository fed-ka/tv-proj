JOHN MADDEN and PAT SUMMERALL are calling the
game in shirtsleeves.
SUMMERALL
That play, my friends,
sums up the Redskins'
running game all day
long. Now Washington
calls their last time
out.
Madden leans over to do his diagram that
shows up on your TV screen. We STAY ON him
as he draws and explains.
MADDEN
Hey, the Dolphins do
this as good as
anybody. See, in a
four, three, two, two,
you got the guards...
boom!... Plugging up
the middle, then the
corners... boom and
boom!
Are free to
box...
leaving the
middle
linebacker to
cut off
the trap
here...
boom!
SUMMERALL
Third and twenty-two,
but forget the first
down with eight seconds
showing and the Skins
down by a touchdown.
MADDEN
Could be the last play.
SUMMERALL
Could be the last play
of the season if the
players go out.
The room's blinds are pulled tightly against
the bright sunlight. Only the blue light of
a TV illuminates anything.
Suddenly, we hear an old man in the bed give
out with a loud piercing wail.
The door to the room bangs open and an
English male nurse named AUGUSTINE RIPLEY,
dressed in white, comes running in. He's
carrying a syringe in each hand, poised at
the ready.
He runs to the bed of
the still wailing
EDWARD FRANCIS O'NEIL
(75). O'Neil is hooked
up to an oxygen tank,
watching the just
completed Redskin game
with the sound off.
AUGUSTINE
Did they win or lose?!
O'Neil continues to wail.
AUGUSTINE
That has the distinct
tonal quality of a
loss.
He puts one needle down and jabs O'Neil with
the other one.
He murmurs to the old man as he injects him.
AUGUSTINE
Nice medicine for a
loss. Keeps us calm.
Makes us not so sad.
Keeps us on an even
keel. Gives us some
perspective, doesn't
it? And we'll save the
winning medicine for
next Sunday, won't we?
He finishes.
O'NEIL
If you keep talking to
me like I'm a five-
year-old, I'm going to
hurt you.
AUGUSTINE
Sounds exciting.
He reaches for the phone and hits the speed
dial.
AUGUSTINE
We'll want to talk to
coach now, won't we?
He hands the phone to O'Neil.
O'NEIL
(on the phone)
What the fuck was
that?!
INTERCUT WITH:
Coach Tildon sitting in his office. We can
hear players getting dressed, listening to
MUSIC and getting SHOWERS outside his open
door.
TILDON
(on the phone)
I think he slipped.
O'NEIL
Bullshit he slipped!
He could have scored!
Anybody could have
scored! I got one foot
in the god damn grave
and I could have
scored!
TILDON
Mister O'Neil, let's
face facts: The
players are going out.
It's gonna happen. And
nobody wants to get
hurt on the last play
before a strike that
could go on for the
rest of the season.
O'NEIL
You god damn wimp!
You're fired! Get out!
Get out! Get out!
O'Neil throws the phone down. Augustine
picks it up and then cranks up the oxygen a
notch.
O'Neil takes big gulps of the rich air.
AUGUSTINE
Better? It always
makes you feel better
when you fire someone,
we know it does, don't
we? Yes...
O'NEIL
Get me Jimmy McGinty.
Get him here. Tonight.
O'Neil sucks hard on the oxygen.
CUT TO:
A REPORTER is interviewing WILSON JONES, the
huge defensive end for the Redskins. Wilson
wears an enormous diamond earring.
Wilson is dressing at his locker.
WILSON
Hey, man, I do what my
union says.
REPORTER
But you're already one
of the highest paid
players in the game.
The fans just don't see
the point of a player
like you striking.
WILSON
Let me tell you
something: I'm a big
man, you see?
Wilson holds his arms out.
Yes, he's
gigantic.
WILSON
There are some days
when I am so beat up,
that I cannot dress my
own big ass. I asked
management for a valet
or some shit to help me
dress and they said no
way. So, fuck 'em!
PLAYER (O.S.)
Shut up everybody, here
it is...
Somebody turns UP a TV in the locker room.
ON TV
A handsome ex-player named Jerome Lindell
steps up to a podium at a press conference.
He's wearing a two thousand dollar suit.
On the TV he is identified with a super:
"JEROME LINDELL -- President -- National
Football League Players' Association."
LINDELL (V.O.)
I have just left a
meeting with
representatives of the
owners and I am sad to
say that they have
refused the players'
final demands which
center around a rise in
the current salary cap.
(MORE)
LINDELL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Therefore, I am
recommending that all
N.F.L. players walk out
and not play until our
demands are met. I
want the players to
walk out tall, to walk
out righteous, to walk
out in the knowledge
that we do this as a
team. We shall
overcome the fat cats.
I send peace to my
union brothers.
The entire locker room is silent for a beat.
And then everyone starts getting dressed
again, maybe a little slower than before.
ON WILSON JONES
WILSON
Shit, I'm goin' to
Vegas.
CUT TO:
As he sleeps peacefully.
The only sound is
the HISS of his OXYGEN.
Then we hear ICE CUBES SLOSHING in a glass.
O'Neil opens his eyes and sees:
JIMMY McGINTY, a handsome devil in his late
sixties, wearing golf clothes and sipping the
last dregs of a Scotch rocks.
McGINTY
You look like shit.
O'NEIL
I'm dying, Jimmy.
McGINTY
You been dying for
twenty years.
O'Neil motions to the glass. Jimmy pours
three fingers from a Glenlivet bottle and
hands it to him.
McGINTY
That poof of a nurse of
yours is gonna kick my
ass if he catches you
drinking.
O'Neil removes his oxygen to sip his whiskey.
He smiles as it goes down.
O'NEIL
Gimme a butt.
McGINTY
I quit.
O'NEIL
No.
McGinty nods.
O'NEIL
You pussy. I want you
to come back as head
coach. I fired that
asshole Tilden today.
McGINTY
I'm retired. And
besides, you don't have
a team. They all flew
home in their jets to
their castles.
O'NEIL
We're gonna finish the
season anyway. All of
us owners decided.
We're gonna use
replacement players.
McGINTY
You're a bunch of
greedy bastards, aren't
you?
O'NEIL
Us, greedy?! What
about the god damn
players?! I got the
highest payroll in the
N.F.L. and they still
want more!
McGINTY
That's because you've
been bottle-feeding
straight cash to these
big babies for years.
O'Neil sips his whiskey and calms down.
O'NEIL
No team owner in their
right mind is gonna
give back those T.V.
revenues.
(MORE)
O'NEIL (CONT'D)
All we promised Fox was
twenty-two guys with a
pulse every Sunday.
But think about it,
Jimmy. We got a great
opportunity here! We
got a chance to put a
team on the field that
plays the game just for
the love of it. Like
we used to play it.
McGINTY
We also used to play
without face guards.
O'NEIL
Jimmy, I'm really
dying. The doctor says
I'll be gone by
Superbowl Sunday. Help
me bring a winner back
to D.C. You did it for
me once before. You
can do it again.
McGINTY
Listen: I golf once a
week with the President
of the United States.
I walk my grandkids to
school every day. I
got a
young wife who
will
fuck me any time I
want,
which frankly,
isn't
too often, but
it's
comforting to know
it's
there. I don't
need
it.
O'NEIL
Come on. Wouldn't it
be fun? A bunch of
poor nobodies who play
to win instead of a
bunch of bitchy
millionaires? You can
put it together, Jimmy.
Player's love you.
They always have.
McGinty pours more Scotch and looks into the
glass.
O'NEIL
Tell me you're gonna do
it.
McGINTY
Shut up, I'm thinking.
(pause)
Okay. Here's the deal:
you let me recruit who
I want, with no
interference?
O'NEIL
Absolutely.
McGINTY
I'm talking anybody I
want. No exceptions.
And no interference
with my coaching,
either, like you used
to.
O'NEIL
Sure, Jimmy, sure.
McGINTY
And one more thing: no
more Notre Dame
stories. You start
telling me Notre Dame
stories and I pull your
plug personally.
I
swear to God.
O'Neil smiles.
O'NEIL
Deal.
CUT TO:
McGinty is sitting behind the empty desk as
his two main coaches give him a presentation.
They are offensive coordinator LEO
PILACHOWSKI and defensive coordinator
CHRISTOPHER BANES.
PILACHOWSKI
... Six phone lines
with internet access on
two: One for defense
and one for offense.
BANES
We thought we would
skip special teams for
the moment.
PILACHOWSKI
Except for a kicker.
We definitely need a
kicker. A place kicker
over a punter.
BANES
The thinking being that
if we lose the toss, we
have to be able to at
least kick off.
Both coaches laugh nervously.
McGinty
doesn't say anything.
PILACHOWSKI
Okay. Here's the list
of every player cut
this past season. What
we would like to do
is...
McGINTY
(interrupting)
Those people?
(pointing to
list)
Most of them were cut
because they were
shitty.
McGinty takes out a piece of paper of his own
with a bunch of names on it.
McGINTY
We're going to go
another way here. I've
done some scouting
since I retired. On an
ad hoc basis, of
course. And what I
have here is a list of
people I've kept an eye
on. They've all played
football somewhere, but
only a few in the pros.
And they've all got
something... unique to
bring to the game.
We're gonna take these
people and try to put
together a winning
team. And if nothing
else, they should be
fun to watch.
McGinty looks up when he senses someone
standing in the doorway. It's REESE EVANS,
the veteran Redskin we saw standing on the
sidelines with the clean uniform.
EVANS
You won't need a
center.
McGINTY
How you doin', Reese?
EVANS
Bored and ready to
retire. I'm just
looking for one more
hit. One more really
good hit.
McGINTY
What about the strike?
EVANS
Hell, I'm rich. I got
no complaint with
Mister O'Neil. I just
want a chance to play
one last time.
(MORE)
EVANS (CONT'D)
Shit, I'd rather go out
with a broken leg than
sitting on the bench.
McGinty nods to Pilachowski. The coach takes
a marker and fills in "Evans" in the center
circle.
McGINTY
Welcome to the new
Washington Redskins.
(to his coaches)
Let's find Reese
somebody to play with.
CUT TO:
A bunch of BIKER types are cooking up a vat
of speed. These guys are big, and
badasslooking.
After a beat, one of the Bikers looks up at
the door.
BIKER
Did you hear something?
The other biker shakes his head, no.
The one who asked the question walks over to
the door and listens for a beat. Nothing.
He turns to go back and suddenly the door
disintegrates in front of a charging man
wearing a "police" windbreaker.
This is DANIEL
BATEMAN, a big,
young,
psychotic cop,
who immediately
runs over the
poor Biker who
was listening at
the door,
kicking the guy
in the head as
he goes by.
Bateman dives on two more Bikers, and
viciously head-butts one of them.
He stuffs the other's head into the meth
mixture, pulls him out and clubs him with a
big police blackjack, three quick times:
Rap! Rap! Rap!
The guy goes down like lead.
Bateman looks around and spots a big BIKER
cowering in a corner. The Biker is
terrified.
Bateman takes two stops toward the guy when
suddenly three more COPS wearing windbreakers
run in, out of breath.
They look around at the unconscious Bikers.
COP #1
Jesus, Bateman! Why
don't you ever wait for
us?!
BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! Someone's BEEPER is
going off. The three cops look at theirs.
Nothing.
The cowering Biker looks at his.
BIKER #2
Not me.
Bateman pulls his beeper, studies it and
looks puzzled.
BATEMAN
What area code is 703?
COP #1
Washington, D.C.
CUT TO:
A loaf of Wonder Bread is spinning through
the air in SLOW MOTION. It comes AT us,
twisting and turning.
ON CLIFFORD FRANKLIN
He's tall, maybe 22, and positioned behind
the cash register. He's wearing a Washington
Redskins sweatshirt.
Clifford's hands are up as he waits to catch
the bread which was tossed by his MANAGER at
the back of the store.
The loaf hits Clifford's hands and then
bounces out. It lands on the counter in
front of a TEN-YEAR-OLD smart-ass KID.
KID
Nice hands.
CLIFFORD
(not amused)
What else?
KID
A pack of Marlboro
Reds, a pint of Martel
Cognac and a box of
Trojans, extra long.
Clifford grabs the Kid's two one-dollar
bills, and makes change for the bread.
CLIFFORD
Get out of here. I'm
telling your mother you
were talking like that.
The Kid leaves.
The Manager yells from the back of the store
as he holds up a portable phone.
MANAGER
Hey, Clifford, somebody
on the phone wants you
to play football next
weekend.
CLIFFORD
Tell 'em I gotta work
Saturday. And I'm
watching the Redskins
on Sunday. Ain't
nothing stopping me
from watching the
Redskins on Sunday.
(mumbling)
No way that's gonna be
happening, me not
watching the Redskins
on Sunday.
MANAGER
(into phone)
He's gotta work.
(pause)
They said they'll pay
you.
CLIFFORD
Pay me?
How much?
MANAGER
(on phone)
How much?
(pause)
Ten thousand five
hundred dollars!
CLIFFORD
(stunned)
Ray, who the fuck is on
the phone?!
MANAGER
(pause)
It's the Washington
Redskins!
Clifford collapses.
CUT TO:
We hear deafening APPLAUSE as we hold on
ANDRE and JAMAL WILLIAMS, two huge
bodyguards, dressed in identical black suits.
Suddenly,
the artist formerly known as Prince
comes off
stage, grabs a towel from an
assistant
and starts walking with Jamal in
front and
Andre in the rear.
As they walk, a CELL PHONE RINGS. Andre
pulls it from his pocket and answers it,
quietly.
Jamal runs interference with the techies and
groupies backstage.
JAMAL
(to someone)
Get out of the way!
(to someone
else)
Don't look at him! He
don't like being looked
at, god damn it! No
eye contact!
As they walk, Andre is still talking on the
phone.
Finally, they get to the backstage door and
stop. The rock star prepares to run the
gauntlet of adoring fans behind his trusty
bodyguards.
But his bodyguards are conversing quietly but
urgently with each other.
One of the assistants throws open the door.
A big mob waits outside.
The anointed one turns to his bodyguards to
lead the way, but... they're gone!
The mob surges. The artist formerly known as
Prince screams as he's trampled to death by
his fans.
CUT TO:
Shane is sitting in the first seat with Reese
Evans (center).
We MOVE BEHIND them and see, among others,
Daniel Bateman (psychotic cop), Clifford
Franklin (can't catch a loaf of bread), Jamal
and Andre Williams (ex-bodyguards), Lou
Pacifico (kicker and bookmaker), and Roland
Lamont (ex-high school coach).
BANG! EGGS start HITTING the bus WINDOWS.
We can hear the regular players chanting:
PLAYERS
Scabskins! Scabskins!
Scabskins!
ON CLIFFORD FRANKLIN
He's very excited as he looks out the window
at the striking players. Roland Lamont sits
next to him.
CLIFFORD
Oh God, there's Eddie
Martel! And Wilson
Jones! I love Wilson
Jones! Yo, Wilson!
Yo, player!
ON WILSON
His big face looms right outside the bus
window. He looks pissed off and scary.
ON LOU PACIFICO
He leans across his seat to Shane.
LOU
Hey, Lou Pacifico.
Shane shakes his hand.
SHANE
Shane Falco.
LOU
I know. I lost a ton a
money on that Sugar
Bowl disaster of yours.
Wow. Did you get your
butt kicked or what?
ON JAMAL
He's looking out the window when an eeg
splats against it. He turns to his brother
Andre:
JAMAL
You know I don't take
that shit.
Jamal reaches into his jacket and starts to
pull out a nine-millimeter pistol.
Andre stops him.
ANDRE
Be cool.
A nondescript van pulls up and a muscled,
deadly-looking guy in handcuffs and jail
issue clothes gets out. This is bearded
safety EARL (he-ain't-no-girl) WILKINSON.
A Maryland state trooper unlocks the cuffs.
Earl looks... hungry.
SID, an oldtimer equipment man folds towels.
Behind him, we can see helmets, pads, etc.
McGinty walks up dragging Shane who is fully
dressed in a uniform, including helmet.
McGINTY
(to Sid)
What is this?
McGinty points to the intricate face guard on
Shane's helmet.
It's an exaggerated version of a lineman's
cage with so much metal criss-crossing that
you can hardly see Shane's face.
McGINTY
He's a quarterback!
How is he supposed to
see?
SID
He told me he was a
linebacker!
SHANE
I can see.
McGinty holds up three fingers.
McGINTY
How many fingers?
SHANE
Two.
No, wait.
Three.
CUT TO:
Andre and Jamal are just about dressed.
Andre helps Jamal on with his jacket.
Jamal
then helps Andre on with his.
ON SHANE
He's stripped down sitting on a bench.
Reporters are trying to interview him.
Microphones are in his face and video cameras
jockey for position.
SHANE
... just glad to be
back playing. That's
all I've really got to
say.
REPORTER
But where have you
been? What have you
been doing to make a
living?
SHANE
Well... I've been
involved lately in
the... aquatic
business...
ON MICKEY LEE AND ROLAND LAMONT
Mickey is watching Roland unbuckle his big
complicated knee brace. (NOTE: There should
be something slightly medieval about this
brace.)
MICKEY
You only played one
game?!
ROLAND
Actually, less than two
minutes. I was a
rookie third round pick
in '93. We were
playing Atlanta in the
home opener. Near the
end of the first
quarter, they sent me
in, I took a screen
pass over the middle
and got hit by both
linebackers.
Simultaneously. One a
side. My knee turned
into wet toilet paper.
End of career.
MICKEY
Can you play on it now?
Roland takes out a wrench and starts
unscrewing a bolt on his brace.
ROLAND
I've been teaching high
school football for
five years. It's not a
bad life. I'm good at
it. There are some
days when I actually
love it. But for one
more shot at this?
Shit. I'd give it all
up. This time, they're
gonna have to take me
out in a box.
ON EARL WILKINSON (CRIMINAL)
He's standing naked in front of his locker
staring with anticipation at a garment bag.
Slowly, he unzips the bag revealing a
beautiful new suit. He touches the lapels
reverently.
ON CLIFFORD FRANKLIN
He's sitting in front of a locker, holding
his football, with a shit-assed-eating grin.
Someone walks by.
CLIFFORD
I got Wilson Boone's
locker, man. Do you
believe that shit?
He drops his ball and quickly picks it up
again. He looks around to make sure Coach
didn't see him.
DISSOLVE TO:
Shane, dressed in pads and pants, opens the
door and walks in. During the opening and
closing of the door we hear:
ASSISTANT COACH (O.S.)
... so if anyone does
have any firearms, we
need to turn those in
as soon as possible, no
questions asked...
Shane stands in front of the urinal and goes
through the painstaking process of locating
his dick.
First he wrestles open his football pants and
then has to deal with the cup, etc.
Next to him, at another urinal, is WALTER
COCHRAN, a big, serious bornagain tackle.
As he pisses, Walter has his Bible propped
open behind the flush handle so he won't miss
a minute of scripture.
WALTER
Praise the Lord, Shane.
SHANE
Yeah.
Sure.
WALTER
Walt Cochran.
Offensive tackle.
Shane nods.
Walter pees for a beat.
WALTER
Shane, will you witness
with me?
SHANE
Will I what?
WALTER
Will you witness with
me? For this upcoming
practice.
SHANE
Now?
By now Shane is pissing too.
WALTER
Praise the Lord for
giving us a way to
eliminate, Shane. Why
not talk to Him in the
midst of performing his
gift?
Walter takes his hand off his whizzing member
and holds it out to Shane.
Shane looks at Walter's hand for a long time,
but finally, he removes his own guiding hand
and clasps Walter's hand tentatively.
REVERSE ANGLE
They continue pissing as they hold hands.
WALTER
Heavenly Father, thank
you for allowing us to
pee the poisons from
our systems. Please
help us in today's
practice to be strong
and...
CUT TO:
A barbecue is in progress for the new
Washington Redskins at the beautiful home of
Coach McGinty.
The huge back yard features a pool and a
catered buffet/barbecue.
Andre and Jamal are loading down their
plates.
Mickey Lee is gnawing on a two-foot slab of
ribs.
Lou Pacifico has a little three card monty
going at a picnic table.
Coach
McGinty is holding up a beautiful baby
girl
to the admiring players. He kisses the
baby
and then hands the child to his gorgeous
young
wife.
Augustine is pushing Mister
O'Neil in a
wheelchair. They pass the
outside bar and
O'Neil suddenly lunges for
a bottle of
tequila. Augustine has to
rip it out of his
hands.
Coach Banes and Earl Wilkinson (criminal) are
talking to a distinguished-looking big man in
his fifties. This is a D.C. CIRCUIT COURT
JUDGE.
BANES
Where did you play,
Judge? Wait. Do I
call you judge?
JUDGE
Your Honor, or Judge is
fine. I played at
Harvard. But I played
in the days when you
went both ways.
Offense and defense.
When players were
really tough.
(to Wilkinson)
And where did you play
college ball... I'm
sorry, what was your
name again?
Wilkinson is smiling but he looks dangerous.
WILKINSON
Smith. Ray Smith. I
played at a junior
college nobody ever
heard of. What
position did you play
on defense, Judge?
JUDGE
Middle linebacker.
WILKINSON
Yeah, big fellow like
you, that's what I
would have guessed.
JUDGE
It was a different game
in those days. Raw.
Powerful. No tricks,
like today.
WILKINSON
You know, maybe you can
show me some of your
technique, Your Honor.
Maybe you can show me
some of that toughness.
JUDGE
I'd be glad to!
There's an evil glint in Wilkinson's eye.
Shane is standing alone in a large hallway
looking at an enormous trophy case stuffed
with the spoils of football.
ANNABELLE
(O.S.)
You would think he's
done enough.
Shane turns and sees her.
She's as fetching
as ever.
ANNABELLE
McGinty, I mean.
SHANE
I was kind of thinking
the same thing.
ANNABELLE
My theory is he came
out of retirement to
see if he could win
with losers.
(pause)
Oh, shit. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean...
SHANE
(interrupting)
Hey, it's okay. I've
been called worse.
ANNABELLE
Like
after that Sugar
Bowl
game? I guess you
could
survive anything
after
that.
Shane has to actually smile at this.
SHANE
Sometimes I feel like
everybody in the world
saw that game. Like I
could go to India and
some little guy would
run up to me and say,
'Boy, did you suck in
the '92 Sugar Bowl.'
Annabelle laughs.
SHANE
So, how come you're
such a fan?
ANNABELLE
My dad. He's a huge
Redskin fan. For
years. He's in his
twenty-ninth year at
the Senate Office
Building. As a guard,
not a senator. The
only thing that keeps
him going he says, is
me and the Redskins.
That's where I get it.
My fan-ness.
(suddenly)
Are you scared?
Shane is totally taken off guard by this
woman.
SHANE
Scared? Well... yes.
Absolutely.
ANNABELLE
It's okay. Anybody
would be. But you're
good. And you'll do
good.
SHANE
Well, thank you. Look,
I gotta study the play
book tonight. So...
I'll see you.
ANNABELLE
Break a leg tomorrow.
SHANE
What?!
ANNABELLE
It's
from the theater.
For
opening night. You
say
the worst thing
that
can happen. And
it won't.
Break a leg.
Shane waves uncertainly and walks away.
The Judge (now with his jacket off) and
Wilkinson are lined up across from each other
in a three-point stance in something called a
man maker drill.
The entire team forms two lanes on either
side of them, as they face off.
The idea is to knock the other guy down and
get by him.
JUDGE
Alright, this is how we
used to stop a running
back.
WILKINSON
I can't wait.
Someone says hut! And Wilkinson slams into
the Republican 16th Circuit Court Judge and
knocks him head over heels.
The Judge lands on his back, wham!
He's out
cold.
Wilkinson slaps hands with Andre and Jamal.
WILKINSON
Oooh... got me a judge!
Man, that felt good!
CUT TO:
It's very quiet. Shane sits in pads and no
jersey, methodically squeezing a football.
Reese Evans, his center, stops by.
EVANS
You okay?
Shane nods and gives a nauseous-looking
smile.
EVANS
Remember to nod your
head on the snap.
SHANE
(out of it)
Nod my head?
EVANS
For
when Murray's in.
The
deaf kid. Hello?
He
needs to look at you
on
the snap.
Shane nods that he understands but he goes
back to staring at a wall.
Andre and Jamal sit facing each other. Andre
throws a vicious forearm at Jamal's head but
Jamal catches it. They both nod in approval.
Lou Pacifico smokes and stares.
Bateman is leaning against a wall, fully
dressed, helmet on. He's staring into space
and smiling to himself. He looks terrifying.
Earl Wilkinson (the criminal) is polishing a
beautiful pair of new alligator shoes.
Clifford Franklin looks at himself in the
mirror as he ceremoniously puts on his
helmet.
Walter Cochran is reading his Bible in front
of his locker, which features a picture of
Jesus and a cross.
Mickey Lee (ex-sumo) is sitting in front of a
bowl of hard boiled eggs. He's methodically
popping them into his mouth. He eats four as
we watch.
Coach Pilachowski comes up to Lee and watches
him eat.
PILACHOWSKI
What are you, crazy?
Nobody eats right
before a game.
LEE
I always ate before a
big match. I need the
bulk.
Like a hole in the head he needs the bulk.
Coach McGinty comes strolling through the
locker room, the picture of calm.
He walks by defensive end/tight end Brian
Murray and signs to him to have a good game.
Murray signs back, "Thanks, Coach."
Cochran spots McGinty and puts down his
Bible.
COCHRAN
Coach McGinty, I'd like
to lead the team in the
pregame prayer.
McGINTY
No. No praying.
That's the problem with
professional sports
today: too much god
damn praying. Five
hundred dollar fine to
the first man I hear
praying.
McGinty turns and bums an egg from Mickey and
walks to the middle of the locker room.
He eats the egg as he turns slowly and takes
in his players.
McGINTY
A lot of people are
waiting for you to fall
on your asses today.
And guess what? You're
going to. But I don't
give a shit if you look
funny out there. Or if
you miss a block, or
drop a pass, or trip
over your own dick.
This is professional.
And the difference
between professional
and amateur, between
playing for the
Washington Redskins and
Michigan State is
simply... money. You
are being paid to win.
Not just to play. Not
just to learn how to be
good sports. Not for
the alumni. You are
being paid to win. I
don't care how the fuck
you do it. But I'm
demanding it. Because
those guys whose place
you're taking have
forgotten that simple
fact. So, go win it.
He walks away.
The players get up and start
moving.
CUT TO:
Shane is looking out at the field through the
blow-up helmet. He looks scared.
Suddenly, a CANNON goes off with a stomach-
resounding BOOM! Shane jumps.
ANNOUNCER
(V.O.)
Ladies and gentlemen,
your Washington
Redskins!
IN STANDS
A sparse crowd is in attendance, mostly
diehard fans like Todd, Rod and Bob, who are
decked out in burgundy and gold. They look
drunk already as they cheer like mad.
ANNOUNCER
(V.O.)
Here's the starting
defense today...
Bateman is first in line.
He looks like a
racehorse on cocaine.
ANNOUNCER
(V.O.)
At middle linebacker,
number 56, Daniel
Bateman!
Bateman takes off at a dead run out of the
tunnel and into the helmet.
ON HIS FOOT
It hits a wire stretched across the ground
inside the helmet.
ON BATEMAN
He trips big-time into the side of the
helmet. He bounces (it's inflated,
remember?) to the other side, bounces again
and is shot out of the front of it like a
cannon ball.
ON CHEERLEADERS
Bateman bounces out of the helmet and takes
out the first six cheerleaders.
Girls fly left and right.
One girl is
knocked out of her shoes.
ON MADDEN AND SUMMERALL
Madden covers his face.
Summerall looks
pained.
SUMMERALL
Oh, my...
IN STANDS
Even the hardcore Todd, Rob and Bob can
hardly look at the carnage.
OUTSIDE STANDS
A contingent of strike players like Eddie
Martel and Wilson Jones huddle in the parking
lot. They are laughing their asses off as
they watch on a personal TV.
ON FIELD
Cheerleaders are down and screaming in pain.
Annabelle is running from girl to girl, doing
triage.
ON BATEMAN
He's sheepishly standing to one side as
trainers come out to assist.
Jamal and Shane are examining the trip wire.
Obviously, they were sabotaged.
JAMAL
Bastards.
ANNOUNCER
(V.O.)
And now... uh, the rest
of the Washington
Redskins.
The rest of the team walks unceremoniously
out of the helmet and onto the field.
CUT TO:
A guy sitting at the bar turns his head
quickly to the televised game when he hears
Pacifico's name.
This is the same mafioso type who saw Lou
kick the ball that knocked the godfather's
hat off. Remember?
Everyone is lying on the floor.
Shane has ice bags on his head, shoulder,
elbow and both knees.
Pacifico is getting smelling salts from a
trainer as Bateman hovers nearby waiting to
apologize.
Mickey Lee is chewing ice.
Cochran is reading his Bible.
McGinty walks in and bends down to Shane.
McGINTY
(quietly)
You got to look for
Murray over the middle.
You got to trust me on
this: he's a big,
tough kid with good
hands.
SHANE
We can't put three
plays together without
a penalty, a fumble of
a fight.
McGINTY
You still got a whole
half left. You're a
thoroughbred out there
running against a bunch
a nags. You can pick
these fuckers apart.
Shane smiles through his pain.
SHANE
You're good. You're
really good.
CUT TO:
Madden uses his pen on the screen to try to
explain a play. There are already lines
everywhere.
MADDEN (V.O.)
... began with a
Redskin end around, but
Cochran, the pulling
tackle ran into Falco's
pitchout ... see?
(MORE)
MADDEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Right here, it bounced
off his helmet. Then
it was kicked by Landon
and then Hayes touched
it, I think, and then
Green got a hand on it,
and then Bellinski
recovered it and then
he lost it, and finally
the ball took a crazy
bounce right back into
Falco's hands, look at
his face here. He's as
surprised as anybody!
Falco then ran it back
to just about the
original line of
scrimmage, executed the
same play -- an end
around to Murray -- and
the Skins score.
Welcome to Strike
Football!
ON PACIFICO
Boom!
He boots the extra point.
Scoreboard:
Patriots 17, Redskins 10.
DISSOLVE TO:
It's packed with players, friends and
assorted groupies.
Pacifico is smoking and talking non-stop to a
group who hang on his every word.
Andre is already passed out at a booth.
Jamal supports one side of Andre so he
doesn't fall over.
Murray is signing to several fans who sign
back.
Clifford Franklin signs autographs.
Earl Wilkinson, dressed to the nines, is
dancing close and slow with a gorgeous woman.
Shane is at the bar and he's not in good
shape. He's got cuts and bruises visible and
every time he moves he grimaces. The
martinis are starting to help, however.
He's talking to a stunning WOMAN IN RED.
SHANE
... ultimately, it's a
pain thing, you know?
I mean, it's Darwinian,
the survival of the
numbest. Whoever can
take the pain most,
gets the largest
contract. It's sick.
He finishes his martini and throws the olive
over his shoulder.
WOMAN
IN RED
Exactly. Let me buy
you another.
She signals to the bartender.
WOMAN IN RED
I don't know how you do
it. I hate pain. Pain
is a no no as far as
I'm concerned.
Shane gets his new drink, takes a sip and
visibly slumps at the bar.
SHANE
(slurring)
I'm glad that you are
concerned.
WOMAN
IN RED
Hey, are you
alright?
I'll take you
up to
your room, if
you like.
Shane looks at her closely.
SHANE
I would like.
CUT TO::
Shane weaves down the hallway with the Woman
In Red.
They stop at a door.
SHANE
Here's home.
Shane fumbles for a key.
Another stunning-looking woman suddenly
appears from down the hall. This is the
WOMAN IN BLUE.
WOMAN IN RED
A friend of mine is
going to join us, okay?
WOMAN IN BLUE
Hi.
Ready to party?
She checks the hallway, takes the key from
Shane and sticks it in the lock.
SHANE
(looking at both
women)
Oooooh. Bookends.
WOMAN IN BLUE
And you're the book,
baby.
Suddenly, Annabelle Farrell appears in the
hallway.
ANNABELLE
(to the girls)
Go away. Both of you.
WOMAN IN RED
Fuck off!
Crack! Annabelle punches her in the nose
with a straight right hand. The girl bounces
off the wall.
SHANE
(to Annabelle)
These are my guests.
WOMAN IN RED
(now bleeding)
You crazy bitch!
Both girls take off.
SHANE
Why did you do that?
Annabelle opens the door.
ANNABELLE
You were about to be
rolled.
SHANE
(as he enters)
That's what I was
hoping.
Annabelle is pulling the bed down as Shane
falls into a chair.
ANNABELLE
They work the bar
downstairs looking for
drunk Redskins.
Shane looks embarrassed.
SHANE
I guess they found one.
ANNABELLE
Don't feel so bad.
It's a rookie mistake.
She turns and sees that he's already passed
out.
She looks at him not unkindly. Then she
unbuckles his belt and starts pulling his
pants off.
DISSOLVE TO:
as he opens his eyes.
He rolls over and screams in pain.
ON ANNABELLE
She's wearing nothing but a Redskins' T-
shirt. She quickly bends over him.
ANNABELLE
Here.
Take this.
SHANE
(groaning)
What is it?
ANNABELLE
It's for the pain.
Take it. It's only a
little bit illegal.
Shane takes it and swigs a glass of water.
SHANE
Oh, God. I've got to
go to the bathroom.
It's far away, isn't
it?
ANNABELLE
I'll help. We'll just
take our time.
She helps him get out of bed.
When he
stands, he screams again.
ANNABELLE
Kidneys.
SHANE
Oh, man. My hair
hurts.
ANNABELLE
You took a hell of a
beating. The martinis
didn't help, either.
She walks him to the bathroom like an old
man. He shuffles in and closes the door.
ANNABELLE
Don't be afraid if
you've got blood in
your urine. That's
normal.
SHANE (O.S.)
Did you undress me?
ANNABELLE
Yes.
SHANE (O.S.)
And you... slept here
with me?
ANNABELLE
Yes.
SHANE (O.S.)
Did we... ?
ANNABELLE
Are you kidding? You
were catatonic.
He appears again at the door.
SHANE
No blood.
ANNABELLE
Good.
Back to bed.
He leans on her as she walks him back.
He gets into bed with a moan.
SHANE
May I ask you a
personal question?
She nods.
SHANE
Do you do this for all
Redskin quarterbacks?
ANNABELLE
Of course not.
SHANE
Then why me?
Annabelle takes her time answering.
ANNABELLE
I don't know. I guess
I can't resist a man
who can take a hit.
SHANE
I can't take a hit!
Annabelle cradles his head.
ANNABELLE
Shhh. It's all in your
head. Now, get some
sleep.
CUT TO:
Annabelle walks up to Shane's door with a
stack of newspapers. She enters.
The bathroom door is closed.
Annabelle talks
to him anyway.
ANNABELLE
You're the golden boy
in the press this
morning.
She reads a headline.
ANNABELLE
'Falco scores big.'
(to herself)
Well... not really.
(still reading)
Hey, a lot of the
regular players are
starting to cross the
picket line.
SHANE (O.S.)
Redskins?
ANNABELLE
It doesn't say.
Shane comes out of the bathroom dressed and
ready to go. He's still moving slowly and in
great pain.
ANNABELLE
Where are you going?
SHANE
McGinty called a dinner
meeting with the whole
team.
Shane tries to put on his coat, but he's so
sore he can't. Annabelle helps him.
SHANE
Thank you. Thanks
for... everything.
You
saved my life.
ANNABELLE
No. Probably just your
wallet and your watch.
SHANE
And that pill, that
sure worked.
ANNABELLE
You're basic double D
Vicodin. But be
careful: It's habit-
forming. The best
stuff always is.
There's another awkward silence.
SHANE
Well...
ANNABELLE
Ice both knees and that
shoulder before bed.
CUT TO:
The Scabskins are all being served dinner in
a private room.
Mickey Lee is served a steak the size of a
briefcase. Andre and Jamal get lobsters big
enough to be pets.
Ed O'Neil is being fed pureed asparagus by
Augustine. When Augustine drops the napkin
and bends over, O'Neil whispers urgently to
Cochran who is enjoying a steak:
O'NEIL
I'll give you 50
thousand dollars for a
bite of that steak!
McGinty taps his glass at the head of the
table and stands.
McGINTY
Alright, listen up:
There have been a lot
of rumors about the
regular players
crossing the picket
lines. They are not
rumors. Many union
players have now seen
the error of their ways
and are coming back in
droves. Apparently,
they have been struck
with the realization
that it is a blessing
to be playing
professional football.
There is dead silence in the room.
Everybody
thinks it's over.
McGINTY
But they had their
chance. Now it's your
turn. Mister O'Neil
and I have agreed to
ban all striking
players and to continue
to go with you guys.
There's a beat and then everyone breaks into
cheers.
Suddenly, the door flies open and a REPORTER
and a cameraman step in and start filming.
The Reporter shoves a microphone at McGinty.
REPORTER
Coach, what will be
your strategy against
New York this Sunday?
Out in the restaurant, patrons see the
players and a few break into "Hail to the
Redskins."
Suddenly, the whole restaurant starts
singing.
Shane looks embarrassed.
Pacifico stands up on his seat, and conducts
the singing.
Andre and Jamal hold their lobsters in the
air and make them dance to the song.
CUT TO:
We're ON a TELEVISION showing Pacifico
conducting and the entire restaurant singing.
Eddie Martel (Redskin quarterback) is
watching the scene at home on the late local
news.
NEWSPERSON
(V.O.)
... The Palm patrons
showed an impromptu
appreciation tonight
for the new Washington
Redskins. They may be
unknowns and far from
superstars, but it sure
looks like they have
charmed the fans.
Martel looks very angry.
CUT TO:
Shane answers his door.
Annabelle is
standing there.
SHANE
Hi.
Come in.
ANNABELLE
No.
She gives him a bottle of pills.
ANNABELLE
We don't travel with
the team. So, here's
Tylenol with codeine,
regular Vicodins, the
magic bullet one that I
gave you before, and a
couple of Darvons if
you actually break
something. Pop 'em in
the ambulance.
SHANE
Wow.
Thanks.
ANNABELLE
I'll be watching on TV.
The Giants got back
three of their four
defensive linemen.
Plus their middle
linebacker.
SHANE
Yeah.
I know.
ANNABELLE
What can I say? Go
from the shotgun and
scramble your ass off.
Shane smiles at her.
She suddenly grabs him and they kiss big-
time.
Then she breaks and walks quickly away.
Shane doesn't know what to make of this.
CUT TO:
They're back in their booth calling the game.
MADDEN
That's all-pro Hank
Morris's third sack,
his second here in the
fourth quarter and the
sixth of the day for
the Giants. Falco is
gonna be sore tonight.
SUMMERALL
If he can stay alive
that long. Ten-three
New York in what has
turned out to be an
incredible defensive
duel.
Shane knocks. After a beat, the door opens
and Annabelle is standing there rubbing her
eyes. She's wearing a cut-off Redskin
jersey.
ANNABELLE
Are you hurt?
SHANE
No.
Not really.
ANNABELLE
You're getting used to
being slapped around.
That's a good sign.
SHANE
I...
Nothing comes out.
ANNABELLE
Would you like to come
in and make love?
SHANE
Yes. No. I'm here
because ... I don't
want to be alone.
ANNABELLE
Most
of the world feels
that
way. You don't
have
to be embarrassed
about
it.
SHANE
But to tell you the
truth... I'm kind of
scared of you.
Annabelle takes that in and thinks about it.
ANNABELLE
I won't hurt you.
She takes his hand and leads him inside.
CUT TO:
Annabelle is giving Shane a slow, sensuous,
full-body massage. It's lucky for us he's on
his stomach.
Shane does a lot of moaning as Annabelle's
fingers work their magic.
She gets to a place on his shoulder that's
especially tender. He moans even louder.
ANNABELLE
That shoulder is going
to need special
handling.
Annabelle pulls her jersey off and gently
presses her breasts into Shane's back.
Shane puts a pillow over his head to drown
out the ecstasy.
After a beat, he pulls the pillow away.
SHANE
You know what hurts
worse than my shoulder?
ANNABELLE
I can't imagine.
SHANE
Their defensive end
punched me in the
mouth.
Annabelle starts laughing.
SHANE
Seriously. It's
killing me.
Annabelle is laughing hard now as Shane rolls
over.
DISSOLVE TO:
Shane and Annabelle are in a close, after-sex
kind of cuddle thing.
Shane is unburdening himself.
SHANE
... after that game,
after being beaten that
badly in front of the
whole country, after
humiliating myself, my
team, my school, my
family, I mean -- did
you know that I set two
Sugar Bowl records?! I
was sacked eleven
times! I threw six
interceptions!
ANNABELLE
Okay.
Calm down.
SHANE
Anyway, after that, I
could never seem to
adjust in the pros. I
was too scared. I lost
my balls.
We see Annabelle's hand move slightly under
the covers.
ANNABELLE
Well, they're back.
SHANE
You know what I mean.
My nerve. I lost the
edge you need to play
this game.
ANNABELLE
I don't believe that.
I don't think it just
goes away. It was only
one bad day, Shane.
Everybody has those.
SHANE
No. Somehow, I
convinced myself that I
couldn't ever win the
big game. I got so
down, that I was afraid
to be playing when a
game was on the line.
I was afraid to screw
up. That's the sure
sign of a loser. From
there, it wasn't very
far to thinking that
I'll never win, that I
didn't deserve to win
at anything. Including
love.
ANNABELLE
You're wrong. You're
winning now. You're
winning me.
They kiss real good.
CUT TO:
He's doing his sports segment from the
studio.
ANCHOR
Any idea how
Wilkinson's identity
was discovered and who
leaked it to the media?
REPORTER
No, Bob, but rumor has
it that the National
Football League
Player's Association
had something to do
with it.
ANCHOR
Thanks, Hank.
(TO CAMERA)
In other N.F.L. news,
almost sixty percent of
the regular players
have now crossed the
picket lines and more
are crossing every day.
The strike, now in its
second week, is
expected to go out with
a fizzle. Most experts
think that the Monday
night Dallas/Washington
game will be the last
with replacement
players. But even that
game will feature at
least 75 percent of the
regular Cowboys. Coach
James McGinty will try
to make it a perfect
three and O with a team
made up totally of
replacement players.
Well... and one felon.
(pause)
That we know of.
CUT TO:
McGinty stares out the window at the
reporters as Augustine feeds O'Neil soup.
McGINTY
Stop worrying. The
N.F.L. doesn't care if
he played under an
assumed name.
Everything was legal.
He was let out on a
work release program.
He'll be kept under
house arrest but he'll
still be able to play.
O'NEIL
Where are we gonna keep
him?
McGINTY
In the stadium. We'll
fix up something
comfortable for him and
he'll get his exercise
by kicking the shit out
of N.F.L. receivers.
O'NEIL
How did you pull that
off?
McGINTY
How else? With your
money.
O'NEIL
(to Augustine)
Take this cow piss out
of here.
AUGUSTINE
You used to love
asparagus soup. They
say that when the taste
buds go, you're at the
beginning of the end.
Augustine leaves with the tray.
McGINTY
I want to keep Falco
after the strike ends.
As Martel's back-up.
O'NEIL
Let's keep 'em all.
The hell with the
regulars.
McGINTY
You've got to take the
union players back once
the strike ends. It's
part of the collective
bargaining agreement.
O'NEIL
The hell I do! I'm
dying! Let 'em sue me.
McGINTY
They'll do worse than
that. They'll close
down the stadium.
O'NEIL
God damn 'em! Then you
got to beat Dallas.
The whole country will
be watching. All those
millionaires down there
deserve to have their
noses rubbed in it.
McGINTY
Ed, let's be honest:
beating Dallas is gonna
be a hell of a trick.
O'NEIL
You can pull it
off.
You proved that
winning
doesn't have to
look
pretty. These
boys are
hungry for it,
Jimmy.
(MORE)
O'NEIL (CONT'D)
There's nothin' more
dangerous in all of
sports than a hungry
team. I remember back
in '47, we were playing
Nebraska in the mud...
McGINTY
(interrupting)
Ed, I'm begging you --
no Notre Dame stories.
O'NEIL
Okay, Jimmy, okay. But
you beat Dallas for me,
and then I'll go gently
into that night.
CUT TO:
We're ON
Mickey Lee, who is wearing his
Redskin
game jersey with no pads. He's
stuffed
into a Cadillac Brougham, a big-ass
version
of the Caddy.
He's talking directly TO US.
LEE
You'll score, too, with
a Cadillac from Coleman
Cadillac. It's a big
car for a big man.
Mickey is very wooden as a spokesperson.
He
tries again.
LEE
(same thing)
You'll score, too, with
a Cadillac from
Coleman's Cadillac.
It's a big car for a
big man.
DIRECTOR (O.S.)
That's good, Mickey,
that's real good.
Let's try it again.
Mickey looks game.
MONTAGE
A)
Shane walks down the hall to his room.
He
enters.
He walks in and closes the door.
When he turns around, Eddie Martel, ex-
Washington Redskin quarterback, is sitting on
Shane's bed.
Two defensive linemen-types stand by the
window.
SHANE
What's this?
MARTEL
This is a visit.
SHANE
A visit. Who let you
in?
MARTEL
I used to nail one of
the housekeepers.
SHANE
Lucky girl.
MARTEL
(pointing to the
linemen)
You know who these guys
are, don't you?
SHANE
Dallas Cowboys.
Howdy.
MARTEL
You'll be seeing a lot
of these guys tomorrow.
SHANE
What do you want?
MARTEL
Who, me? Not much.
But these boys wanted a
little head start on
you.
There's a beat and then Shane suddenly bolts
for the door. But the two linemen grab and
hold him.
SHANE
I'm flattered that you
actually think we have
a chance to win.
MARTEL
It can be a game of
luck. And under no
circumstances can we
allow a scab team to go
three and O.
Especially against the
Dallas Cowboys. It's
just not good for the
game.
SHANE
Is the union behind
this 'visit'?
MARTEL
I can't really say,
Shane. By the way,
have you ever tried
throwing a football
with bruised ribs?
He kicks Shane viciously in the side.
Shane
screams.
MARTEL
The pain makes it damn
near impossible.
The linemen drops Shane on the floor.
MARTEL
And one other thing: I
want you to stay away
from Annabelle.
Shane is gasping on the floor.
MARTEL
The sad fact is she
won't give me the time
of day. But you can't
have everything I want.
I can't let that
happen. So, you gotta
stop seeing her. Just
on principle.
Martel viciously kicks Shane again.
Shane
screams.
MARTEL
Let me hear you say it.
Shane is trying to get his breath.
MARTEL
Come on. You can do
it.
SHANE
(barely visible)
I won't go out with her
anymore.
MARTEL
Good.
(to the linemen)
Gentlemen?
(to Shane)
Hey, have a great game!
They move toward the door.
CUT TO:
The familiar "MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL THEME
SONG" is just ending. AL MICHAELS does his
on camera intro.
AL
Good evening from the
Big O here in
Washington D.C. where
the mighty Dallas
Cowboys take on the
Cinderella Washington
'Scabskins' as they
have come to be known.
Hi, I'm Al Michaels and
we are witnesses to a
unique matchup tonight
as Shane Falco and a
contingent of strike
players go up against
the entire regular
squad of the Dallas
Cowboys. Yes, you
heard right: every
Cowboy has now crossed
the picket line, some
as late as this
afternoon, and they
will all play tonight.
Can a rag tag group of
hasbeens and castoffs
stand up to what was
once called America's
team? And what about
the strike itself? It
has been so ineffective
that many predict it
will be over before
this game ends. Stay
tuned as Boomer and Dan
join me for strike
ball, D.C. style.
Everyone is just about dressed in their
uniforms and ready to go.
Lou Pacifico enters in street clothes and
starts undressing quickly. He looks worried.
Shane watches Lou for a beat. We see Shane
shift his upper body and grimace.
McGinty enters and pulls Shane aside.
McGINTY
Congratulations. It's
official. You're
staying on after the
strike.
Shane smiles in spite of the pain.
McGINTY
It's probably better
that you not say
anything to the rest of
the guys until after
the game. Okay?
SHANE
Whatever you say,
Coach.
McGinty walks into the middle of the locker
room and goes into pre-game speech mode.
McGINTY
Alright, listen up.
The strike is just
about history. By
tomorrow, you will no
longer be Redskins.
It's important that you
leave here, however,
with the knowledge that
you have made a
difference in your own
life, in the owner's
life -- or what's left
of it -- and especially
the fans'. You have
proven to a skeptical
America that sports is
not about contracts, or
agents or shoe deals.
Sports is about rising
to the occasion. We
have one more
opportunity tonight to
do that, one more
chance to show what
heart is all about.
The Dallas Cowboys are
waiting out there to
kill you. I expect
nothing less than for
you to win even in your
death throes. We have
a powerful weapon on
our side tonight:
there is no tomorrow
for most of you. And
that makes you very
dangerous people. Use
it.
CUT TO:
The boys are doing their half-time stand up.
AL
That's the end of the
first half and not
surprisingly, it was
all Dallas. The
Cowboys had over two
hundred yards
offensively versus
Washington's frankly
pathetic thirty-eight
yards. That's total
offense. Falco got
close to scoring on the
last play of the half
but he appeared to have
slipped. By the way,
running back Roland
Lamont was hurt on that
play and word is he's
on his way to the
hospital.
DAN
Al, the battle is being
fought and won in the
trenches. You can't
expect a bunch of pick-
up players to stand up
to a professional pass
rush like the Cowboys.
BOOMER
There's still a whole
half left, Dan. And
remember, Falco is
proving to be a second-
half quarterback.
DAN
You got to be kidding.
BOOMER
Those big, fat boys in
the trenches get awful
tired. You ought to
know that, Dan.
No laughter.
AL
Okay, let's join Chris
Berman with our half-
time show. Chris?
After a beat we hear:
DIRECTOR (V.O.)
Clear!
AL
What's wrong with you
guys?!
BOOMER
He started it.
DAN
I did not! You called
me fat!
BOOMER
I did not! But you
are!
Dan reaches across Al and grabs Boomer by the
throat.
AL
Stop it!
The three of them start wrestling in the
booth.
CUT TO:
Everyone is nursing a bruise or some sort of
wound. Shane is nowhere to be seen.
McGinty walks into the middle of the locker
room.
McGINTY
Alright, listen up:
The strike is
officially over.
They're announcing it
on TV right now. So
this is it, gentlemen.
We have one half left
to keep from being
totally humiliated.
You are better than the
present score. You
have nothing but your
own self-respect riding
on this game. It's up
to you. Here's your
swan song, people. How
are you gonna sing it?
And with that he walks out.
Everybody looks
beaten and depressed.
Everyone is quiet.
Shane walks in.
SID, the equipment manager, sees him and
yells.
SID
Hey, Shane, I just
heard.
Congratulations!
He smacks Shane on his bad side and Shane
grimaces.
WILKINSON
Congratulations on
what?
SID
Shane is staying on.
He's gonna be Martel's
backup.
Everyone stares at Shane for a beat.
ANDRE
Is that true?
SHANE
Yes, Andre. It's true.
Nobody says anything for a beat.
FRANKLIN
I got to tell you,
Shane, you played the
first half like you
were staying. Like you
already had a contract.
Shane looks around the room at this beaten
bunch. No one makes eye contact with him.
SHANE
You're right, Clifford.
And I'm sorry. But now
I want to go out there
and either beat these
bastards or die trying.
I never wanted to beat
anybody so bad in my
life.
Everybody lets this sink in.
Earl Wilkinson finally speaks up.
EARL
I don't know what yawl
are doin' tomorrow, but
my ass is goin' back to
jail. But if I gotta
go, I want to go back a
winner.
EVANS
Hell, I'm retiring. I
have thirty minutes of
football left in my
whole career. I'm
homicidal!
BATEMAN
Me, too, Reese!
EARL
Let's get it on!
Everybody turns to Shane.
SHANE
Gentlemen, our problem
is the Cowboys aren't
afraid of us. But they
should be!
LAMONT
Damn straight!
Everybody whoops!
SHANE
We've got one chance on
offense to make our
stand -- the first play
of the half.
JAMAL
One touchdown ain't
gonna help, Shane.
SHANE
No.
But one nasty-ass
play
might. We just
gotta
be brave. And
trust
each other.
Shane happens to glance at Pacifico.
Pacifico won't meet his eye.
Shane turns to Sid.
SHANE
Help me with this.
Sid helps Shane strip his jersey off.
Everyone reacts to the bruises on Shane's
side.
SHANE
Somebody has to tape me
up.
