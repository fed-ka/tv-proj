Bird's-eye view. We circle lazily above the forest.
Through a break in the trees, we catch an occasional glimpse
of a prostrate form on the ground. As the circling camera
gets closer we see that the form is a human body.
CUT TO:
EXTREME CLOSE-UP OF LILA TALKING TO THE CAMERA
LILA
I'm not sorry.
A bead of sweat trickles down her cheek. Then: a blinding
flash of light obliterates her face.
CUT TO:
EXTREME CLOSE-UP OF PUFF TALKING TO THE CAMERA
PUFF
I am sorry.
A tear wells in Puff's eye and runs down his face. Another
blinding flash of light.
CUT TO:
EXTREME CLOSE-UP OF NATHAN TALKING TO THE CAMERA
NATHAN
I don't even know what sorry means
anymore.
As Nathan speaks, a trickle of blood drips down his face
from his out-of-frame forehead. Another blinding flash of
light.
CUT TO:
It's a frenetic hand-held shot as Lila is pulled from a police
car and dragged into the precinct house. Cameras flash.
Reporters shout questions. Lila attempts to shield her face
from view, but she is handcuffed and can only manage to hunch
her shoulders.
CUT TO:
It's got that faded, "memory" look. Twelve year old Lila
hurries home from school, books clutched to her chest.
Other kids walk along the street in pairs or groups, laughing
and chatting. Lila walks alone, a worried scowl on her face.
LILA (V.O.)
Something terrible happened when I
was twelve.
CUT TO:
This has a faded, "memory" look also. A naked, bearded, dirty
middle-aged man and a naked, dirty ten year old Puff walk
along like apes, crouched over and dragging their knuckles.
PUFF (V.O.)
My father escaped from a New Jersey
mental institution in 1963.
CUT TO:
It's raining and deserted. Puff's father, in pajamas, comes
tearing around the corner. He runs crazily towards the camera,
waving his arms, puffing out his cheeks.
PUFF (V.O.)
He had been committed the previous
year after applying one too many
times at our local zoo for the job
of "apprentice ape."
Puff's father passes a newspaper vending machine, stops,
goes back and examines the headline. It reads: President
Kennedy Assassinated. Puff's father looks heavenward and
clutches at his temples in despair.
PUFF (V.O.)
My father saw what the human race
had come to while he was... in
captivity. He felt something had to
be done to create a better world.
CUT TO:
Puff's father climbs out a second story window with a small
bundle in his arms. He runs off into the night.
PUFF (V.O.)
He stole little me from my mother,
his ex-wife, and raised me, with
love and tenderness and respect, as
an ape like himself.
CUT TO:
An adult Puff and his now older father sit on the forest
floor and pick bugs off each other and eat them.
PUFF (V.O.)
Until quite recently I believed myself
to be an ape, although I didn't know
specifically what type. Apes don't
think in terms of type.
DISSOLVE TO:
Faded colors. Ten year old Nathan in a bow tie and shortpanted
suit walks along with his uptight, British parents.
They arrive at the ape pen. Nathan is excited. He jumps up
and down. The apes jump up and down also.
NATHAN AS A BOY
Monkeys! Look, mama, monkeys!
MOTHER
(clamping down on his
shoulder)
Nathan, those are not monkeys. Those
are apes. Mountain Gorillas to be
precise.
There is a commotion off screen. Two uniformed attendants
drag Puff's father, straitjacketed and kicking and screaming
like an ape, past Nathan and his parents.
PUFF'S FATHER
I am not a human being! I am an
animal!
Nathan, his father, and the other zoo patrons look on
curiously, a little frightened. Nathan's mother chooses to
ignore it.
MOTHER
And furthermore... Tell him, Harold.
FATHER
(distracted)
Uh...
(then by rote)
We must never act like apes, son.
For you see, The ape is our closest
biological relative -- specifically
the pygmy chimp.
(holds up the same
illustration of a
pygmy chimp that
Puff showed the
congressional
committee)
A single chromosome separates us.
But you know what truly separates us
from the apes, what makes us better
than apes?
NATHAN AS A BOY
No, papa. What?
FATHER
Culture. Civilization. Refinement.
If we do not have these as humans,
then we might as well be living in
pens and throwing our feces about,
masturbating in public...
(beat, a reverie)
...sniffing red swollen female rump...
MOTHER
Enough, Harold.
CUT TO:
A bunch of naked women dance and chat around a campfire.
Lila is there, pretty hairy. So are many of the other women.
LILA (V.O.)
I tried being a lesbian separatist.
LESBIANS
(chanting)
A woman without a man / Is like a
fish without a bicycle.
LILA (V.O.)
But I guess I just wasn't attracted
to women, even hostile, man-hating,
hairy ones who wore sensible shoes.
CUT TO:
Lila walks home. She's wrapped in winter clothing, but we
can still see a bit of her white beard. It's snowing. The
street is deserted. She spots a lighted window, she peers
in. It's a warm family scene. Large group of chatting,
laughing people. Fire in the fireplace. Big turkey on the
table.
LILA (V.O.)
They say the holidays are difficult
for a lot of people.
Lila looks down the street and sees dozens of lonely-looking
people peering forlornly in warmly lit windows. Some on
ladders to peer in second-floor windows. Lila sighs.
CUT TO:
We see a tent in a clearing. A smoking campfire. There is a
rustling inside the tent. Lila steps out naked. She is covered
with fur. She pours a cup of coffee, and stands, comfortable
in her skin, watching the world around her.
Squirrels jump from tree to tree, birds look down at her.
She smiles.
LILA (V.O.)
Birds and squirrels and rocks and
trees didn't seem to judge my hair.
I felt at peace when there were no
humans around. I figured out a way
to spend as much time as possible
with no people around. I became a
nature writer.
Lila picks up a pad and pen from a rock, sits on the rock
and writes.
CUT TO:
There is a violent, violent storm. The hair drier drone has
turned into the explosive noise of rain beating down in sheets
and wind howling at fifty miles an hour. Branches crack.
Lila's tent blows over, revealing her huddled there with a
sleeping bag wrapped around her like a blanket.
LILA
I knew it was coming when in late
afternoon, a thunderhead drifted
over, sneaking in like kids through
the back door of a movie theater,
forced casual. It turned the sky a
queer shade of green. A green that
said "watch out, baby, this is gonna
hurt like hell." I could've
hightailed, but that would be
cheating. Part of the Nature
experience is recognizing its mastery
over you, your smallness in the face
of it.
Lightning hits a tree nearby. It falls with a smack
practically on top of Lila. She screams, then defiantly
stands, throwing off the sleeping bag. The wind and rain
whip her hair around her head. She laughs with amazing gusto
and raise her arms like a runner winning a marathon.
LILA
As Nietzsche said, what does not
kill me makes me stronger, and that
goes double if you're a woman.
CUT TO:
We see many copies of a book entitled "Wind in my Hair" by
Lila Jute.
LILA (V.O.)
I became a successful nature writer.
CUT TO:
A big display of the book "Fuck Humanity" by Lila Jute. A
long line of women with beautifully coiffured hair snakes
out of the store.
LILA
...and I became a recluse. I had a
menagerie of animals at my house.
They loved me because I was me. They
loved me on the days I shaved. They
loved me on the days I didn't. For a
while this was enough.
DISSOLVE TO:
Puff's POV: Through some brush we watch Nathan and Lila
hiking. We hear Puff's loud heavy breathing and, in the
distance, the relentless gibberish chatter of Nathan and
Lila. Puff moves. Lila glances over.
CUT TO:
Puff's POV: We see a naked Lila looking in our general
direction, but not seeing us. The sun dapples her body.
She moves closer and closer.
PUFF (V.O.)
It was an ape as I had never seen
before. Like me, yet different in
certain essential details. And all
at once I felt a heat pass through
me. My heart raced. Gentlemen, I
wanted to touch her, to caress her,
to be one with her. I had urges and
desires I could not explain. I felt
overwhelmed by the power this strange
creature had over me, and so I did
what any animal would do when it
comes across an animal of superior
strength...
CUT TO:
A naked, very hairy Lila sits by herself on the cliff and
watches the sunset. There's a chill in the air and she shivers
and hugs herself.
LILA
Oh God, I have no one. Nothing. You
give me this beautiful gift, this
glorious sunset. But with no one to
say "isn't that a beautiful sunset"
to, it becomes meaningless, just
another stupid sunset. They happen
everyday. So what?
DISSOLVE TO:
Lila is hovering over the unconscious Puff. Nathan's voice
comes back into focus. He is still speechifying.
NATHAN
...what is it that makes us human,
if not the knowledge that we are
indeed human? Think of this poor
soul's education as the greatest
gift we could bestow upon...
LILA
All right.
NATHAN
Great. Grab his feet. We'll throw
him in the trunk.
CUT TO:
Nathan, carrying a brief case, is walking to his car.
Gabrielle hurries to catch up to him. Her high heels click
on the pavement.
GABRIELLE
Dr. Bronfman! Dr. Bronfman!
Nathan turns.
NATHAN
Oh, Hi, Gabrielle.
GABRIELLE
(out of breath)
Hi. I just wanted to tell you that I
very much enjoy working with you.
(blushes)
Now I'm embarrassed that I say this.
They walk along.
NATHAN
No. Don't be. I really enjoy hearing
that. You're a terrific assistant.
GABRIELLE
Merci. I... Do you... would you like
to go get a cup of coffee, perhaps?
NATHAN
Well, I don't know. I'm actually on
my way to...
GABRIELLE
Now I am truly embarrassed. Forgive
me. I should not have asked such a
stupid question. I know you are a
very important man and...
NATHAN
No. Don't be silly. It's just...
GABRIELLE
I am a foolish little thing. I am
pink in my face, no? It is only that
I have been so lonely lately and...
I am ashamed. I'll see you tomorrow,
okay? Unless... Am I fired now?
Gabrielle pouts. Nathan is charmed.
CUT TO:
Nathan and Gabrielle sit on a blanket on this otherwise empty
beach. There is a light breeze. Gabrielle has one of her
breasts exposed and is nursing an infant. Nathan looks at
the baby's face. It is angelic. He looks up and smiles at
Gabrielle. She smiles back. They kiss.
DISSOLVE TO:
Lila, Nathan, and Puff walk along. Puff is astounded by
everything he sees. He looks with wonderment at the tall
buildings, the cars, the many different types of people. He
looks like an idiot.
CUT TO:
We hear banging and rustling and arranging coming from inside
the apartment.
NATHAN
Well, I think...
GABRIELLE (O.S.)
You think too much. I need a man who
doesn't think so much but acts more
than he thinks... is what I need!
NATHAN
What?
GABRIELLE
You heard me! You make me sick when
you pretend to not understand what I
am saying to you! Go away from here!
NATHAN
(turning away)
Well, look, I'm sorry to have bothered
you.
He starts to head down the hall.
GABRIELLE (O.S.)
(beat, then screaming)
All right, already! Come in if you
must! The door's open, you son of a
bitch!
Nathan heads back to the apartment, tries the knob. The door's
open. He enters.
CUT TO:
Puff exits the bookstore, walks down the street checking out
the tawdry hookers. He chooses one. She leads him into a
dark alley.
CUT TO:
MONTAGE
6) Lila in a Tai Chi class.
7) Lila doing jumping jacks.
8) Lila reading The Art of War.
9) Lila doing stomach crunches.
10) Lila doing chin ups.
11) Lila swimming laps.
12) Lila getting more electrolysis.
CUT TO:
Puff walks along checking out the prostitutes. He signals to
one with a nonchalant jerk of his head.
CUT TO:
MONTAGE
13) Lila doing one-handed push-ups.
14) Lila rolling on the ground with a rifle.
15) Lila, in boxing gloves, punching a bag.
16) Lila reading the Kama Sutra.
17) Lila getting electrolysis.
CUT TO:
Puff is sitting in the car. The electronic collar is back
around his neck. Lila holds the black control box, and the
Lucite case with the two mice in it. She stands outside the
car with Frank and Rose.
ROSE
I'm going to miss you.
LILA
Oh, Rosie.
ROSE
And I'm going to miss the lifestyle
having you as a client has afforded
me.
LILA
Shut up, you.
Lila laughs and hugs her.
ROSE
I like you so much, with or without
hair.
(confidentially)
But don't spread that around. Bad
for business.
LILA
I'm really glad you two found each
other.
Frank and Rose put their arms around each other. Frank is
exactly crotch-high to Rose.
MIDGET
We're soul mates.
ROSE
Souls have nothing to do with it,
babe.
LILA
I'll be in touch.
ROSE
No you won't. But it's okay. You
have stuff you gotta do.
Lila tears up. So does Rose. They just stand there for a
moment, then:
LILA
(choked)
Gotta go.
Lila hurries around the car, gets in, and drives off. Rose
and Frank embrace. Frank nestles. Rose sighs contentedly.
CUT TO:
Lila's car drives along. Puff looks nervously out the window.
CUT TO:
Lila puts the case on the ground and unlatches it. The mice
looks confused at first. Then the male mouse pushes the door
open and holds it for the female mouse, who exits. The male
mouse follows her, and closes the door behind him. He turns
to Lila, nods, then extends his arm for the female mouse to
hold on to. She does, and they walk off together on their
hind legs into the woods. Lila sighs, and turns to Puff.
LILA
Out.
Puff gets out casually, then makes a mad dash for the road.
Lila calmly presses the button on her black box. Puff spasms
and falls to the ground.
LILA
Bad.
Puff stays on the ground, breathing hard.
LILA
Get up.
Puff does.
LILA
Take off your clothes.
Puff does. So does Lila. She is covered with hair, except
for her face. But whereas Puff is now white and soft-looking,
Lila is tan and taut and muscular. This is a reversal of the
way both of them were when they first met.
Puff seems taken with her body.
LILA
We're going back to nature, you and
I. I'm going to retrain you. I'm
going to make you free again if I
have to kill you doing it.
PUFF
But I like being human now.
Lila shocks Puff. He falls to the ground.
LILA
You what?
PUFF
I want to be the way I was before.
LILA
(sweet)
Good. I'll show you how, apey.
DISSOLVE TO:
Puff and Lila have built makeshift shelter out of leaves and
twigs. They are sitting around a campfire, naked and dirty,
roasting a couple of skinned squirrels on sticks. The black
box rests in Lila's lap. Puff looks at the roasting squirrel,
is repulsed.
PUFF
Nice night.
LILA
Talking is to be kept to a minimum.
Eventually, when we are ready, there
will be none. Language was invented
so that people could lie to each
other and to themselves. There is no
other reason.
Puff begins to disagree. Lila's hand hovers over the button.
He stops himself.
PUFF
(confused)
I agree?
Lila shocks Puff.
LILA
You lose. Any answer is the wrong
answer.
DISSOLVE TO:
Lila and Puff are naked and collecting mushrooms and berries.
Time has passed. Both Lila and Puff are dirtier and hairier.
Puff still wears his collar. Lila bends over to pick a
mushroom. Puff looks at her from behind.
PUFF
Boy, you look so good from this ang...
Lila turns, puts her finger to her lips in a gentle "no
talking" reminder, then shocks the hell out of Puff. He spasms
and falls on top of her, knocking her to the ground.
He regains his composure, finds himself on top of Lila.
They look at each other for a moment. Then they kiss. It's a
violent kiss. They grope each other. This is primal sex now.
In the dirt. Sweaty. Loud grunting. Lila even presses the
shock button at the right moment. Puff seems to like it in
this context.
CUT TO:
Nathan gets out of the car and runs into the woods. We follow.
NATHAN
(yelling)
Aha!
He looks around there is no one there. He sighs and walks
back to his car, pulls out a map and marks an area with a
red X.
CUT TO:
Lila and puff are having sex again next to a campfire. Now
Lila is wearing the collar, and Puff is giving her well timed
shocks. They giggle and kiss after they finish. Puff sits
up. He holds his stomach and grunts hungrily. Lila grunts
back. She stands and retrieves a sack of berries.
Puff and Lila greedily, gluttonously stuff their faces.
Lila takes some berries and smashes them against Puff's face.
She laughs heartily. He looks annoyed for a second, but then
grabs a handful and squishes them against Lila's face. Pretty
soon they are having a berry war and are covered in purple
stains. They hug each other, out of breath and laughing.
DISSOLVE TO:
Lila and Puff lie naked in a tree, lazily soaking up the
midday sun. There is a rustling in the bushes. They both
look up, alert but calm. Nathan, immaculate in his safari
suit, appears in the clearing. He holds a gun.
NATHAN
Aha! Finally. I've covered almost
the entire seaboard and parts of
eastern Ohio.
LILA
Ugnh.
PUFF
Ugnh.
NATHAN
Oh please, is that as articulate as
you can be after all the time I spent
teaching you? We've discussed
Wittgenstein, for Christ's sake. Not
that you ever had anything very
original or challenging to say on
the subject.
PUFF
Unn.
NATHAN
Down from the tree. Both of you.
Keep your hands where I can see them.
Don't want you pulling any weapons
out of your fur.
Nathan laughs heartily, haughtily, at his joke as Lila and
Puff climb down from the tree.
NATHAN
Look at you two. You both disgust
me.
LILA
Oook. Oook.
NATHAN
Shut up!
(to Puff)
I gave you... life. I created you in
my image, Puff. I took you from this
primordial ooze and brought you into
the world of culture and art and
manners. And this is how you repay
me? By heading back to the ooze first
chance you get? I should leave you
here with Lila the ape woman. It
would serve you right, you ungrateful
piece of crap. But I'm not going to.
You're too valuable to me. Totally
selfish of me. You serve my purpose.
But if you had any smarts you would
realize that I serve your purpose as
well. Life is so much more delightful
when lived in a silk suit.
LILA
Ooka.
NATHAN
Don't worry, Lila. You can stay. I
don't have any interest in you
anymore.
(to Puff)
C'mon, monkey boy.
Puff looks at Lila. Lila shrugs helplessly. Puff reaches out
to touch her hand.
NATHAN
Now!
Puff looks at Lila again. She jerks her head in the direction
of Nathan. Puff sighs and moves to Nathan.
Nathan prods Puff, and they head off through the trees.
Suddenly Puff elbows Nathan. Nathan grunts, doubles over.
Puff turns, lunges, and the two wrestle on the ground.
Puff pries the gun from Nathan's hand, and jumps up. Nathan
stands also, backing away. Puff has the gun trained on Nathan.
Lila runs to Puff, stands behind him.
NATHAN
Puff, put the gun down.
PUFF
Ounpoo. Ungh.
NATHAN
Let's be reasonable human beings
here. We're all reasonable human
beings, aren't we?
PUFF
(jumping up and down
like a chimp)
Unka unka unka unka unka.
NATHAN
Look, why don't you and Lila stay
here and have your natural life.
I'll just go on my way. You'll never
see me again.
PUFF
(to Lila, guiltily)
I have to talk. Is that okay?
Lila nods.
PUFF
(to Nathan)
You did create me in your image,
Nathan. Before you I was a simple,
happy, complete being, in harmony
with the world around me. After you
I became duplicitous, cynical, angry,
anal, totally out of touch with my
surroundings. In a word, Nathan, I
became you. Lila has reintroduced me
to myself. And, incidentally, what
I'm about to do, kill you, is
something that would never have
occurred to me to do as a creature
of the Earth. Before when I killed,
it was for food or in self-defense.
Now I will kill for revenge. Revenge
is an abstract concept, Nathan. And
I learned abstract thinking from
you.
NATHAN
No.
LILA
Puff, don't.
Puff shoots. A crow screams. The fluttering of wings. The
bullet hits Nathan in the head. He falls.
CUT TO:
Lila runs to Nathan. She kneels beside him.
LILA
He's dead.
PUFF
(calmly)
We bury the body. We disappear into
the woods. Nobody knows.
LILA
(beat, then quietly)
No. This is the end of the road.
There's a dead human being here. For
all of his faults, he was a human
being, and certainly a victim of his
culture as much as anybody.
PUFF
Forget him, Lila. We'll disappear.
We'll never talk about it again.
We'll never talk again period. I
love you.
LILA
Puff, what happened to you is as
much my fault as Nathan's. Maybe
more so, because I knew it was wrong
and I went along with it anyway. I'm
taking responsibility for the murder.
I want you to go back to your old
life.
PUFF
I won't let you do that. I shot the
bastard. And I'm glad.
LILA
No. Go back to the woods. This is a
sacrifice I need to make. In my world
we have something called penance.
It's another abstraction, but I had
the concept drummed into my head
during my years in the convent. It
doesn't exist for you, and it
shouldn't. See, I could never be
free again anyway, so I might as
well be in jail.
PUFF
(beat)
Then I'll live for both of us, Lila.
I'll be the most free, truest animal
in the whole forest. For both of us.
LILA
(tearing up)
That's what I'm counting on.
PUFF
(an idea)
But first I'll live among them, just
long enough to testify before congress
about the waywardness of humankind.
LILA
(shrugs)
Okay. If you think it will help.
CUT TO:
Puff walks along, a man on a mission. As he walks he sheds
articles of clothing. He is followed by reporters and
cameramen and celebrity hounds. Soon he is naked.
CUT TO:
Puff walks along, naked. People cheer from porches.
CUT TO:
Puff walks along. He is still followed by reporters. Cows
watch the parade.
CUT TO:
Puff walks along a dirt road. He is about to disappear into
the forest. An older woman rushes out from the crowd.
OLDER WOMAN
Wait!
PUFF
(turning)
Yes?
OLDER WOMAN
I saw you on C-Span. I've been looking
for you for thirty years. Then there
you were, such a beautiful, beautiful
grown man.
The older woman starts to cry.
PUFF
Mother?
OLDER WOMAN
Yes... Derek.
Puff holds out his hand for her to shake. Flashbulbs flash.
PUFF
(formally)
It's a pleasure to meet you, mother.
But I'm an ape like dad was...
(checks watch)
And I have to go back into the woods
now... forever.
OLDER WOMAN
(resigned)
Yes, I suppose so. I suppose I knew
that was going to be what you would
say. It's good to see you again
though.
PUFF
Yes.
OLDER WOMAN
I'm in the book, if you ever want to
drop me a line or something.
PUFF
I'm an ape, mom. I'm an ape. And
apes don't drop lines.
His mother weeps. Puff gently rests his hand on her shoulder
for a moment, then he turns and waves to the reporters. The
crowd bursts into applause. Flashbulbs flash. Puff jogs into
the woods. There is a collective sigh, and then everyone
turns and heads back in the direction from which they came.
We hold on the woods for a moment. A car pulls up. Puff
hurries out of the woods and jumps in the passenger side of
the car.
CUT TO:
The car makes a screeching u-turn. It disappears in the
direction of the city. When the dust clears, we see the two
white mice standing there on the side of the road, shivering
and emaciated. The male holds out his the thumb and the female
holds a tiny little sign which reads: New York.
There is a look of hopelessness in their beady black eyes.
FADE OUT.
