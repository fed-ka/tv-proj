WEST is bathing with the beatiful SALOON GIRL.
WEST
That's right, sugar, and you
should feel free to treat him
just bad.
She moves in and kisses him, long and hard. West hears
the CLATTER of the APPROACHING WAGONS. He stops the
kiss and peeks out the knothole.

WEST
(to himself)
General McGrath's boys. I thought
y'all was never gonna show up.
SALOON GIRL
Mister West, you wouldn't be here
workin' tonight, now would you?
WEST
No, no. 'Course not. Not tonight.
Would you be working if you were up
here with you?
SALOON GIRL
Good.
They start kissing again. He surreptitiously peeks out
the knothole, while continuing his kiss.

This two-story, Victorian building across town is a
"gentlemen's sporting house" in name only. Drunken
roughnecks and ex-Confederate soldiers goose and maul
the rouged-up tarts.
AT BAR - WOMAN
shrinks back from the moronic ribaldry. The Toulouse
Lautrec lighting only accentuates her garish hair and
makeup, identifying her as a SOILED DOVE. A whore -- not
to put too fine a point on it. She's trying not to make
eye contact with two men seated at a table across the
parlor.
SOILED DOVE'S POV - GEN. McGRATH AND HUDSON
HUDSON is a fearsome-looking Indian in a well-tailored
suit. Long black braids descend incongruously from under
a homburg hat. As for his companion...
McGRATH is a mountain of drunken pus. Six foot, sweating
like a Devonshire hog with his tattered, undersized
Confederate dress jacket buttoned all the way to the top.
His ear has been hacked off and replaced by what looks to
be a miniature leather Victrola horn. McGrath smiles at
our Soiled Dove and makes a little kissing gesture.

ANGLE ON SOILED DOVE
Eyes widened in revulsion. What evil abides in this
Godforsaken place? Now a drunkenly EYE-CROSSED REB
licks Dora's ear, then whispers something in it.
Something unspeakably vile, by Dora's expression.
DORA
I'm sorry. That won't be
possible. I have... tonsillitis.

West is unaware that she's watching him, not watching
her.
SALOON GIRL
(admonishing)
Jim!
WEST
Ah, this hole is a safety issue.
I'm thinking, what if it starts to
rain and the water level goes up.
It could suck you right up. I'm
protecting you. (variations)
Saloon Girl frustrated, has grabbed West's boxer shorts
(with little horses on them) and plugs the hole with
them.
SALOON GIRL
Problem solved.
WEST
Belle, you don't just ram a man's
underbritches into a knothole.
You wanna plug the hole, you ram
your own britches in there.
West is at a loss.
She moves in for another kiss.

West hears the CREAK.
He breaks the kiss.
SALOON GIRL
Oh, Jim.
WEST
(serious)
Much as I'd like to take credit
for that you might need to hand
me my gun...
The tower starts to topple.
WEST
... Hand me my gun.
It CRASHES...
CUT TO:

General McGrath checks a pocket watch, looks up
impatiently at the Indian, Hudson. His eyes drift
upwards... to the balcony where...
ANGLE ON UPSTAIRS BALCONY - TWO MORE EX-REBS
have come up back stairs lugging a heavy steamer trunk.
McGRATH
I'm still waiting on my guns and
ammo, but I see my men have
brought your merchandise.
McGrath subtly gestures with his eyes to the balcony for
Hudson to confirm. Hudson nods.
McGRATH
I had expected to be delivering it
personally to Mr...
Hudson quickly cuts him off before he can say the name.
The Indian speaks in a very precise King's English.
HUDSON
My employer, here in a brothel?
(a small ironic
smile)
That would be quite... redundant.
13

HUDSON
You'll meet him when the time --
and place -- are appropriate.
Now...
(stands)
... shall we go upstairs to check
the 'merchandise'?

McGRATH
Frankly, Mr. Hudson, I wasn't
planning to walk those oaken
stairs with you. Direct me to the
poot, sir. Something young and
creamy. A gamer that takes to the
crop and spur.
McGrath looks to the singer (Rita), who beats a hasty
retreat from him after her song. So, once again, McGrath
lays his rheumy eyes on...
ANGLE ON SOILED DOVE
She's oblivious, more intrigued by the ex-Rebs on the
balcony with the trunk. As she starts for the stairs...
a man's hand grabs her. It's the Eye-Crossed Reb again.
EYE-CROSSED REB
You drive a hard bargain, lady.
All right, fifty cents to take
them big juicy lips and...
DORA
Still not interested.
She tries to pull away.
But the Reb won't let go.
EYE-CROSSED REB
But you gotta be interested.
You're a whore.
Suddenly the coquettishness in the eyes becomes rage.
The falsetto becomes a baritone growl.
DORA
(baritone)
That doesn't mean a girl can't
have high standards.
Just as the Reb registers the odd new voice... wham!
Her
corsage springs out and whacks him right in the jaw.
The
Reb's eyes roll back... and he slumps to the ground.
Whooa, hoss... the Soiled Dove is a man! He's ARTEMUS
GORDON and his true profession will be revealed to us
shortly. But now, as he/she stashes the unconscious Reb
behind the bar, straightens bosom and wig...

West is trying to get dressed.

As he pulls on one leg of his pants, a guard lunges at
him with a knife. West hops up on one leg, smacks the
guy with a mule kick.
Now he puts his arm through his shirt sleeve. When the
hand emerges out of the cuff, it's balled in a fist --
which coldcocks the other guard.
WEST
Could I have a little privacy
here?
As if in response, the water tower, still hovering above,
now crashes to the floor -- obliterating his opponents.
WEST
Thank you.
He calmly looks up in time to catch the falling, naked,
screaming Saloon Girl in his arms.
WEST
You'll have to excuse me,
darlin'... but my evidence is
getting away.
West gallantly puts her down, jumps up, grabs the
overhead block and tackle system and slides through the
warehouse. As the HORSE TEAM, which has spooked,
THUNDERS past...
CLOSEUP - WEST
sails onto the runaway wagon. As he pulls himself into
the back, he gives the shivering Saloon Girl a tip of his
hat -- now on his head.
WEST
Sorry about there not being any
towels.

General McGrath
leers down a line-up of Fat-Can's girls.
Just as he gets
to the beautiful singer, who looks sick
at the thought,
suddenly Gordon intrudes. He/she blocks
out the singer,
poses coquettishly -- sucking a
lollypop.
McGRATH
What's your name, missy?

GORDON/DORA
(demurely; back to
his falsetto)
Dora. Would you like to go
upstairs?
McGRATH
Oh, indeedy I would.
Gordon/Dora starts to go as the Eye-Crossed Reb wakes up.
He grabs him/her, very pissed.
EYE-CROSSED REB
Hey, c'mere!
Who the hell are you
anyway?!
McGRATH
She's... mine!
Blam! McGrath emphasizes his claim by gut-shooting the
Reb. The shot makes Dora/Gordon jump and the room go
quiet. As the Reb crumples, McGrath turns back to
Gordon/Dora, oddly inspired.
McGRATH
I feel like... a ditty!
GORDON/DORA
A ditty? But General...
(trying to be
coquettish again)
... my talents really lay
elsewhere.
McGRATH
Nothing stokes the fire in my
loins like a ditty.
McGrath hauls him/her over to the piano player.
McGRATH
You've got some pretty fair lungs
on ya, girl, now use 'em!
He punctuates with a slap to Gordon/Dora's rump.
The
other singer (Rita) watches too.

Gordon/Dora is sweating. Reluctantly, he/she whispers
something to the piano player. He clears his throat and
begins singing.

Gordon/Dora singing. He/she struggles through the song
in a very tough room.
GORDON/DORA
'And tell them I tried...
And tell them I cried...'
Just when it looks like the stone-faced rowdies might rip
him/her apart, McGrath starts tapping a mud-caked toe.
Encouraged, Gordon/Dora belts out the next verses OVER...
20
22
McGrath is clapping with the crowd of misfits who are now
singing along with Gordon/Dora. He/she's won over the room.
GORDON/CROWD
(rousing finish)
And tell them I tried just the
same...!
He/she curtsies to rousing applause. McGrath beams like
a man with the fire in his loins roaring. He grabs his
little songbird and up the stairs they go.
Out the WINDOWS, we see West tracking them.
Simul-
taneously going up outside steps.

leads the sweating, leering General down the hall.
He/she quickly opens and closes boudoir doors --
ostensibly to find a free room for their assignation.
The real agenda is to find the mysterious trunk.
ANGLE ON DOORWAY #1
Quick peek. He/she registers a mild reaction of shock.
Closes that door and moves on to...
ANGLE ON DOORWAY #2
Quick peek. The two rebs sitting on the trunk. At their
feet is a wriggling burlap sack. The "merchandise" is alive.
Gordon/Dora giggles like a schoolgirl.
GORDON/DORA
Well, that's a new one.
McGrath slams the door, drags Gordon/Dora roughly...
24
24
Our soiled dove has her back to the door as if steeling
herself for the task at hand. McGrath beckons her over
to the bed.
McGRATH
Don't let the ear scare you.
I
lost it at Chickamauga.
Gordon/Dora squints at the jerry-rigged ear.

GORDON/DORA
Oh really. One can hardly
notice...
(fiddles with her
belt buckle)
Would you mind...? I... I...
can't seem to release the clasp of
my belt.
Say no more. McGrath is on her like a flash, fidgeting
with it. But it pops open, revealing a spiraling screen
courtesy of Dr. Mesmer. His eyes lock onto it.
McGRATH
Wha... what's this?
GORDON/DORA
It's a deep, deep pool. Maybe
your old swimmin' hole. Getting
sleepy, General?
McGRATH
(ga-ga)
Yes, I'm sleepy.
McGrath sits on the floor.
Gordon smiles... this is
gonna be easy.
GORDON
(normal voice)
Good. You're going to be my
little doggy. And when I say
'speak,' you tell me everything I
want to know. Understood?
McGRATH
(barks)
Woof!
GORDON
All right, little doggy. Sit up.
(as he does)
Now tell me who's in the sack next
door. Is it the scientist, Dr.
Escobar? Speak!
McGRATH
Woof!
Woof!
GORDON
Speak words, dumb doggy! Tell me
the name of the man you kidnapped
him for...

But McGrath doesn't answer. Gordon's Mesmer spiral slows
to a stop. McGrath is coming out of the trance. McGrath
starts to growl, rip at his/her petticoats.
GORDON
Watch the swirling spiral!
Lie
down, bad dog!
As Gordon notices that his contraption's failed...

McGrath reach for his boot knife. Just as the deranged
general's about to plunge it into Gordon/Dora...
... the WINDOW EXPLODES. Jim West comes tumbling into
the room, kicks the knife out of McGrath's hand in one
smooth move. West rolls to his feet, fixes a gallant
smile on Gordon/Dora.
WEST
Didn't mean to startle you, ma'am.
Looked like you could use some
help.
It takes Gordon a moment to recover. He stares at this
black Samaritan, obviously having no clue who he is.
GORDON
(clears throat to
recover falsetto)
Looks can be deceivin'... dark
stranger. I am perfectly fine.
West quickly pats McGrath down, removes a revolver and
his bag of gold coins.
WEST
I can see that, darlin'. Woman of
your caliber probably gets top
dollar, too. So here you go.
(flips her McGrath's
coin bag)
You can run along. I'll take care
of McGrath.
As West sticks the barrel of his gun in McGrath's
gramophone ear, Gordon's eyes pop.
(CONTINUED)

GORDON/DORA
No!
I need him!
WEST
C'mon, lady. You got the money.
Have a little dignity.
Gordon jerks West's gun hand away from McGrath's head
just as the dog-soldier comes around. McGrath suddenly
lunges at him.
McGRATH
(bellows ferociously)
West...!!!
He drives his full weight into Jim's back, pushing him out
into...
27
27
McGrath's rebel yell brings help from all directions.
DOORS BANG open all along the hallway. Not just
McGrath's men, but Hudson and his crew. A melee will
ensue.
West pushes the monster off of him, rolls as a BULLET
SPLINTERS the WOOD where he just was. The SHOT STARTS...
ANGLE - STAMPEDE OF SEMI-CLAD WHORES
all screaming hysterically and heading for the exits.
The beautiful young singer, who'd been coming up the
stairs alone, is now swept back down them.
Gordon, still in character, pushes his way upstream to the
room where the scientist is held.
28
28
Hudson, his back turned, barking orders at his henchmen.
HUDSON
Get Escobar out of here!
The henchmen heft the wriggling sack, when:
GORDON (O.S.)
Leave him right there.

Hudson whirls to see the gruff-talking Gordon/Dora holding
the perfume bottle on him like it's a Colt 45. Now Gordon
shakes one of the heavy bracelets off his wrist, CLICKS a
LOCK, snapping it open. He's accessorized with custom
handcuffs.
GORDON
Let's go, Hudson... hands!
Hudson gives a sick little smile, reaches for his gun
when... WSSSSHT!
Gordon sprays him in the eyes with the second bulb of the
atomizer. (The first Mace!) Hudson howls in pain, drops
the gun, rubs his eyes madly with both hands.
GORDON
Thank... you.
Gordon starts to snap the cuffs on the perfectly
presented wrists when...

FAT-CAN'S - UPSTAIRS HALL - WEST - NIGHT

brawling a dozen attackers. West spots McGrath trying to
escape down the stairs. He uncorks a lethal kick, sending
a thug flying through the doorway and into the back of
Gordon.
Gordon staggers, drops the perfume/mace BOTTLE which
SHATTERS. Hudson recovers his vision enough to send a
fist into Gordon's mascaraed face, pile-driving him back
into the hall. While Hudson and his men make their
escape down the back stairs with the scientist sack...
CLOSE - WEST AND GORDON
West is blocked from chasing McGrath, Gordon from going
after Hudson. West tries to push her aside.
WEST
U.S. Army... Now get outta my
way, lady!
GORDON
(the baritone
growl)
I'm no lady! I'm a U.S. Marshal!
You get out of my way!
Gordon whip off his wig, reaches inside it for something.
West blinks at the weirdness, reflexively draws his Colt.
As Gordon withdraws not a gun, but a badge, from his
wig...

West and Gordon, oblivious to the impending disaster...
WEST
So now what...?

The answer is provided as the NITRO WAGON hits
downstairs.
KABOOOOOOM!!!
THEME MUSIC UP... as we roll...
32
MAIN TITLES

The titles are the familiar animated freeze frames from
the TV show. In the two corners are our heroes -- Upper
left shows West with his gun levelled toward... upper
right -- Gordon with his wig in one hand and his badge in
the other, pointed across toward West.
The cowboy/agent in the middle square fights and defeats
the various bad guys. Then as he exits, QUICK ZOOM ON
main title: "THE WILD WILD WEST."
PAN DOWN TO a sketch of a train caboose as TITLES END...
33
34
West limps past black floor scrubbers. They stop working
to marvel at this handsome black man dressed in custom
cowboy duds walking in there like he owns the place.
But not everybody's so impressed. As West heads toward
the Oval Office, four self-important house detectives
block his way.
HOUSE DETECTIVE
Whoa there, 'pardner.'
(as West stops)
Winning the war may have got you
forty acres and a mule, but you
can't just traipse into the
President's office. Now gimme
that gun.

He nods at the six gun on West's hip. West coolly flexes
his hand above it, like he's about to draw...
WEST
This gun?
Then like lightning, with his other hand, he whips out a
sawed-off shotgun hidden by his jacket. He pokes the
12-gauge barrels up against Pinkerton's surprised crotch.
WEST
Or this one?
A voice stops the situation from escalating further.
PRESIDENT GRANT (O.S.)
Gentlemen!
The detective's head swivels around to see...
ANGLE - OVAL OFFICE DOOR - PRESIDENT GRANT
stands in the doorway.
PRESIDENT GRANT
Don't make Captain West any later
for his appointment than he
already is!
The detectives back away from the hair-trigger cowboy as
fast as they can. West reholsters the gun and
continues...
35

President Grant goes over to his desk, lights a cigar.
Backlit in the haze, the portly bearded figure lives up
to the myth.
PRESIDENT GRANT
Been a lot of death threats lately
... Cabinet made me hire some damn
detectives.
(by way of apology)
Drink, cigar?
WEST
Thank you, sir.
West limps across the room to the bar, pours himself a
glass of whiskey, takes a cigar out of the humidor.

Now West's blood is up.
WEST
Sir, I had him right in my hands

PRESIDENT GRANT
(cuts him off)
Artemus Gordon.
WEST
You... know him?
PRESIDENT GRANT
Of course I know him, he's the
best marshal I've got! He's a
genius.
(off West's
incredulous look)
Gordon has proven himself time and
again as a very cunning operator
with a rapacious intellect.
Nothing will stop him from
completing a mission for his
President... except the impulsive
actions of a headstrong cowboy!
West just looks at him soberly. Draws his gun and
places it against the President's head. Grant's eyes
widen.
WEST
Who are you?
PRESIDENT GRANT
I am the President of the United
States!
West points the GUN to the ceiling and pulls the trigger.
BLAM!!! As Grant jumps a foot and plaster rains down...
WEST

PRESIDENT GRANT - DAY
(the real one) stands in the doorway, hands on hips,
surrounded by his house detectives -- their guns drawn.
West nudges the fake Grant in the fake belly with his gun
barrel -- go ahead. Sheepishly, Gordon starts peeling
off his primitive, but effective, facial prosthetics.
GORDON
Sir, in perilous times like these,
I was simply illustrating how
someone impersonating you could
actually walk right into the very
bowels of the White House...
Just as Gordon makes his intestinal allusion, West takes
a ceremonial bayonet off Grant's desk and pokes a hole in
the inflated bladder that was his fake paunch. The AIR
HISSES out, finishes deflating with a flatulent R-R-RIP.
(Hey, the first whoopee cushion?)
Gordon scowls at him.
PRESIDENT GRANT
You're clever, Gordon. One day
it'll get you killed.
West smirks as Grant looks up at the bullet hole in the
ceiling, then fixes West with a disapproving eye.
PRESIDENT GRANT
... And you, West -- not every
situation calls for your patented
approach of shoot first, shoot
later, shoot again -- then when
they're all dead, try to ask a
question or two.

Working together will be good for
both of you.

The place is a buzzing intelligence operations center --
state-of-the-art for the 1860's. Maps of the U.S. and
the world are on the wall. Various staff and military
people work CLACKING TELEGRAPHS, PRINTING MACHINES that
GRIND out reports, etc.
Grant stops at a display of daguerreotype photos, all
depicting distinguished bewhiskered men.
PRESIDENT GRANT
Ten of our country's best
scientists... all kidnapped in the
last year. By General McGrath, it
now seems.
(turns to them)
The fact is, gentlemen, you've
both been working on the same
case all along. Why did it take
you so long to realize it?
WEST
Well, sir, one of us was still
trying to figure out if he was a
man or a woman.
The detectives snicker over that one.
Grant's had
enough.
PRESIDENT GRANT

bickering! One week, if we're to

PRESIDENT GRANT

Wait!
Suddenly dozens of deadly-looking spiders swarm out from
inside the cake. Gordon jerks his hand back.
WEST
It's McGrath, sir. The South is
rising again. I'm gonna stop it.
GORDON
Sir, West's obsession aside,
McGrath may be a vicious killer,
but a mastermind he is not. So
whom do we seek? After consulting
with Intelligence...
WEST
(cuts him off)
McGrath's headed for New Orleans.
The longer we stand here talkin',
the farther away he gets. I don't
need 'Intelligence' to tell me
that.
GORDON
Ah, so that would mean you rely on
... Stupidity?
Grant's had enough.
PRESIDENT GRANT
Gentlemen! I'm leaving today for
Utah where the transcontinental

(snaps off a salute)
You have a week. Dismissed!
They both return Grant's salute as the President stomps
off. His AIDE now approaches.
AIDE
The President has put a private
train at your disposal. Engine
number five, track six.
(holds out a
wrapped box)
Mr. Gordon, the item you
requested.
Gordon takes the box, hurries to catch up with West.
38

The car is like a classy Victorian men's club. Bar
stocked with crystal decanters, a pool table, decorative
pistols on the wall, books, etc. Gordon, seated in a
club chair, looks over as West falls from the ceiling
into a seat. He's hot, dusty and very pissed off. He
glowers at Gordon murderously.
GORDON
(calmly)
Thanks for dropping in.
WEST
Forget the bikes, the beards, the
fake boobies. Put down the
needlepoint and let's settle
this like men!
He takes off jacket, starts rolling up his sleeves.
Gordon remains remarkably cool, continues sewing.
GORDON
As a matter of clarification, this
isn't needlepoint. This is.
He shows him some real needlepoint.

GORDON
Right now, I'm putting the final
touches on a new invention of my
creation. I call it... The
Impermeable. It's a vest that,
when worn under the clothing, can
stop any modern bullet fired even
at close range.
West draws his gun, aims it at Gordon's stomach and cocks
the trigger.
WEST
Really?
Gordon quickly pulls the vest away from his stomach.
GORDON
But it hasn't been really
tested empirically yet.
WEST
Get up!
West takes off his guns and puts them on the table.
GORDON
(yawn, yawn)
Guns. I find them so primitive
and unnecessary... if one has done
one's proper planning.
WEST
Yeah?
How do you feel about a
fist?
Gordon puts down The Impermeable, stands with a weary
sigh.
GORDON
I must tell you, Mr. West, I've
always felt that allowing a
situation to degenerate into
physical violence is a failure on
my part.
WEST
Well then, 'Mr.' Gordon, you
failed.
Whap! West unleashes a lightning punch that drives
Gordon across the train car. He dabs at his bloody lip.

GORDON
I'm sorry, Mr. West, you brought

Then to West's utter amazement, Gordon puts his hands
together as if praying while at the same time, crooking
his right leg stork-like. Is this some kind of martial
art? Then, he bends at the waist, and like a ballet
dancer, extends his leg out to the wall and flips a
switch.
It immediately triggers a leather hammer to swing down
from the ceiling. It whacks West on the side of the
head, and sends him spinning back onto the pool table.
ANGLE ON POOL TABLE - WEST
shakes it off and is about to attack again. Gordon
calmly pokes a hidden button. Suddenly the pool table
revolves. West is gone.
GORDON
I love this train!

Gordon pours a fine Bordeaux, speaks loudly toward floor.
GORDON

Gordon has just settled into the club chair, puts his wine

Egressor...
Suddenly SHACKLES SNAP out of the arms of the chair,
pinning Gordon's wrists. Before he knows what hit him,
the floor opens and the club chair disappears.

Coleman's a scowling, grizzled old man in a coal-stained
suit. He's got a fire in his eye, brown spittle in the
corner of his mouth where a cigarette butt lives
permanently, and a large copper pot in his hand.
COLEMAN
Knock each other about all ya
please, but harm my train and
I'll douse ya like dogs.
He threatens them with the pot of steaming liquid.
Now,
for the first time, Gordon really looks troubled.

Well then, let's get on about our

Now, where to?
WEST
New Orleans.
GORDON
Shall we let Professor Morton
decide?
WEST
Who?
47
47
A severed human head is in a vise.
GORDON
Meet Professor Thaddeus Morton,
expert in the field of metallurgy
... discovered in a field of
alfalfa. Kidnapped from M.I.T.
six months ago.
West looks from the head to the open box.
WEST
That's a man's head!
Gordon holds up a strange, circular metallic object.
GORDON
... And this magnetic collar was
around it when his body was
discovered. Haven't figured that
one out yet...
But West is still staring in disbelief at the head.
WEST
That's a man's head.
Gordon starts fiddling with a lantern positioned behind
the head.

According to the Retinal Terminus
Theory... a dying person's last
conscious image is burned into the
back of the eyeball like a
photograph.
Perhaps there's a
clue there...
Excited, Gordon turns on the lantern attached to the back
of his head. Beams of light are coming through his
eyeballs, creating a blurry color image on the wall.
GORDON
Morton's last image!
WEST
That's a man's head!
West turns his head sideways to try to view the inverted
image projected on the wall. Gordon realizes the
problem.
GORDON
Ah. The refraction of the lenses
causes the image to appear upside
down. We simply...
He turns Morton's head in the vise.
It's right side up,
but still blurry.
ANGLE ON WALL - FUZZY IMAGE
appears. It's a man who has a tiny Victrola horn for an
ear. He's holding a bloody metal boomerang.
WEST
It's McGrath.
I was right all
along.
Gordon sees something in McGrath's pocket.
GORDON
He seems to have something in his
pocket... too fuzzy to read,
though...
Gordon drums his fingers on his great frontal lobe,
stymied.
GORDON
Mortification of the aqueous humor
seems to have led to the loss

West takes the bifocals out of the box, casually puts them
on Morton's nose. West now gestures to the wall.
CLOSE - IMAGE ON WALL
The white blur in the man's pocket is now focused. We
can see that it's the top of a piece of paper. He reads
the writing on it.
WEST
'Friends of the South! Come to

Gordon has his wardrobe open. Selected from his vast
array of costumes and disguises is a full livery outfit.
GORDON
How about this? You could come
as my man servant.
WEST
(slave voice)
Oh yes, Massa Gordon, dats what
I'll do. And I'll jus' smile
and do as I's tole so those

West straps on his holster.
GORDON
Okay, if you insist on carrying a
firearm, I have something I think
you'll find intriguing...
Gordon displays a belt with a silver buckle. He taps the
buckle... a Derringer pops out. West stares, impressed.
GORDON
And it would go nicely with this...
Gordon takes out a sequined dress, holds the Derringer up
against it.
WEST
Jim West does not wear a dress.
GORDON
Then what's your plan?
WEST
How 'bout this: I'll go as a
government agent who's gonna
kill McGrath.
GORDON
An armed, Negro cowboy costume,
how creative. In a room full of
white Southerners, you oughtta
fit right in. You might even win
first prize!
West starts to walk away.
Gordon grabs him.
GORDON
Listen to me. The art of disguise
is what's going to get us into
that party, thus allowing us to
find these kidnapped scientists
before they're forced to create
something that will destroy this
great country.

you go as a riverboat captain and
I'll be a saloon girl.
WEST
Let me tell you a little something
about beloved 'art of disguise'...
That night at Fat-Can's, I knew you
weren't a woman.
GORDON
But I was propositioned by three
men.
WEST
Gordon, you looked nasty. Your
breasts were all hard and stiff,
and were sticking straight out
like two rusty cannons on a
sunken ship.
Gordon grabs his fake breasts off the rack.
He puts
them on.
GORDON
These are a work of art.
Scientifically and aesthetically
perfect.
WEST
They look like shit.
GORDON
Touch them.
WEST
I don't wanna touch 'em.

I knew it. Well, I'll have no
part of it!
Coleman shakes his head and walks off.

West is thwapping Gordon's breasts.
WEST
There, Gordon, you happy?
I'm touching your breasts.
GORDON
Not so rough.
The buckwheat'll
come out.
WEST
Buckwheat?
That's your problem.
West takes one of the cow udders out of Gordon's bodice
and dumps the buckwheat onto the ground.
GORDON
What are you doing?
West goes over to a wash basin, picks up a water pitcher
and fills the cow bladder. West squeezes the cow bladder
shut and holds it up to his chest.
WEST
Now, squeeze this. This is what a
breast should feel like.

COLEMAN

Federal officers, bah!
Coleman walks off, shaking his head.
BACK TO SCENE
Suddenly, Gordon shoots the cuffs off his jacket. Out of
one sleeve comes a pen. Out the other, a small pad of
paper. They are both connected to a spring-loaded metal
gizmo up his sleeve. West reacts, drawing his pistol up
into Gordon's face.
GORDON
I was just going to jot down a
thought.
WEST
You know something, that's a good
place to put a gun.
GORDON
But then, where would I keep my
notepad.
WEST
You know, Artemus, I think you

West lets himself in. Then just as he's about to part
the heavy drapes... he hears women's voices approaching.
WOMAN (O.S.)
(in a Spanish
accent)
Hey... get your hands off me!
Now Miss Lippenreider, Amazonia and Munitia (bewigged and
wearing costumes) wrangle a beautiful and defiant Latina
into the room. When she turns we recognize she's the
singer from Fat-Can's. Rita is in her early 20s, wearing
a 19th-Century camisole so scanty, it makes it hard to
concentrate on what she's saying.
RITA
Put me in the dungeon with all
those smelly, dirty bearded men
... but I am not goin' in there.
AMAZONIA
You applied for the position.
RITA
Yeah, a standing up position.
I'm
an entertainer, not a...
Amazonia grabs her by the throat, choking the word off.
MISS LIPPENREIDER
Do not be selfish and stupid. He
always spoils his new girl.
RITA
Yeah. Well gimme a simple diamond
bracelet instead of that...
POV - THROUGH DOOR - INTO BEDROOM
A ramp leads to a large bed. A leather and steel
prosthesis is hanging from pulleys attached to the
ceiling.
MUNITIA
It is not so bad... once the metal
warms up.

into...

West hears the PARTY DIN coming from down below.
He
goes to the balcony.
WEST'S POV - OVER STAIR LANDING - DOWNSTAIRS
The scene below is hallucinogenically surreal. A Babel
of foreign languages is the first thing that strikes us.
Avant garde MUSIC is coming from two 10x10 quartet boxes
on either side of the room to create stereo.
SULTRY WOMAN (O.S.)
An authentic cowboy outfit...
complete with six-guns!
West turns to see who busted him. Coming his way is a
ravishing Chinese girl dressed up as a DRAGON LADY.
DRAGON LADY
What a terribly clever costume,
Mr...?
WEST
... West.
Jim West.
DRAGON LADY
Well... West meets East. Mae Lee
East.
(holds out
delicate hand)
Are you here alone, Mr. West?
WEST
Actually I'm, uh trying to
surprise an old friend -- General
McGrath. Seen him around
anywhere?
MISS EAST (DRAGON LADY)
I don't believe that name was on
our guest list. And I would know.
I'm Dr. Loveless's personal
assistant.
The name means something to West.

Dr. Arliss Loveless...? One of

We FOLLOW them as she takes his arm and leads him down
the stairs, into the party.

West surveys the crowd.
MISS EAST
See anybody that looks familiar?
West scans the room.
Stops.
WEST
Matter of fact, I do.
WEST'S POV - WOMAN WITH BIG HAIR
She's got the mole, too.
Gordon has apparently encored
his Soiled Dove get-up.
Miss East sees who he's looking at. She makes a pouty
face as there's a flourish from the STEREO QUARTET.
MISS EAST
I'm... jealous.
(blows a little
kiss at him)
Meet me later... in the foyer.
West watches as she joins...

LOVELESS' WOMEN - NIGHT
Miss East leads them in a sober rendition of "The Battle

Of the coming of the Lord...'

From behind the doors we hear the WHIR of an ELEVATOR.
It stops with a CLUNK. Suddenly...
NEW ANGLE - DOORWAY
bursts open and Abraham Lincoln in a mini-float appears.
It's decked out like Lincoln's box at Ford's theater. On
its own power, it moves past the laughing party-goers in
the foyer. Now the women throw grapes on the floor.
DISTAFF CORPS
(singing)
'He has trampled down the vintage
Where the grapes of wrath are
stored!'
WEST'S POV - ANGLE ON WHEELS OF WHEELCHAIR
are what's trampling down the vintage. West takes in the
whole man. Very curious. Then suddenly... KABOOM!
ANGLE ON ABE'S HEAD
It explodes like a pinata. Up from the hole in his neck
peeps... DR. ARLISS LOVELESS.
LOVELESS
(impishly)
Don't you just hate that song?
The Southern crowd gasps at Loveless's dramatic appearance.
LOVELESS
Why, y'all look like you've seen a
ghost! It's me, dear friends,
alive and kicking! Well, alive,
anyway...
As he giggles, the distaff corps surround him and remove
the Lincoln paraphernalia. Then step aside, revealing...
NEW ANGLE - DR. LOVELESS
is half a man. Literally. Cut off at the waist and
mounted on a wheelchair platform that is powered by an
engine, he is a man bereft of tuchus, kishkes and
everything else in that vicinity that makes life
interesting.

LOVELESS
(chuckles)
We may've lost the war, but heaven
knows... we haven't lost our sense
of humor!
Dr. Loveless looks down at himself, smoothes half of his
Fritz Lang Metropolis-style suit. His face turns dark as
he surveys the crowd.
LOVELESS
Not even when we've lost a lung...
a spleen... a bladder... two
legs... thirty-five feet of small
intestine and our ability to
reproduce...
(like a preacher)
All in the name of the South...
(then quietly)
... do we lose our sense of humor.
You can hear a pin drop.
Loveless turns to the foreign
dignitaries.
LOVELESS
I owe a deep debt of gratitude to
my friends across the sea for
their comfort and... succor.
He suddenly seems distracted by the comely beauties that
surround him. Then abruptly, manically...
LOVELESS
So...! Mi casa es su casa! Ma
maison est a vous! Let the party
begin!!!
Loveless signals to the quartets to resume playing. Miss
East leans down and whispers in his ear. Loveless looks
in West's direction.
Now Loveless wheels over to West. West isn't hiding.
He's cocky in the face of rolling danger.
LOVELESS
Mr. West, how nice of you to join
us tonight... and add color to
these monochromatic proceedings.
West keeps a lid on his temper.
Two can play at this
game.

WEST
Well, when a man comes back from
the dead, it's an occasion to
stand and be counted.
Loveless smiles slightly.
LOVELESS
Miss East informs me that you were
expecting to meet General McGrath
here. I knew him years ago... but
haven't seen him in a coon's age.
WEST
I bet a man like yourself would
find it difficult to keep in touch
with even half the people you
know.
Danger flickers in Loveless's eyes.
He looks to Miss
East.
LOVELESS
Perhaps the lovely Miss East will
keep you from being a slave to
your disappointment.
WEST
Well, you know beautiful women...
they encourage you one second, cut
the legs out from under you the
next.
Loveless's face drops. He is no longer amused. Miss
East winks at West, then accompanies Loveless in the
direction of the study where...
57
57
General McGrath waits impatiently. He takes two
champagnes off a passing tray, guzzles them, then
wipes his mouth on Dolly Madison's bustle. As his
eyes sweep the room...
ANGLE - WEST
He ducks behind a mountain man carrying the French
tricolor. When Loveless and General McGrath disappear
into the study and close the door, West eases after
them. He pauses as he passes the "Soiled Dove," leans
into her big bouffant. He regards a stained-glass window
patterned with a spider over her shoulder.
(CONTINUED)

57

57
WEST
Hey, honey... I see a big ole
spider up on the wall. Hope it
doesn't drop down your pretty
dress.
As the Soiled Dove jumps a little, West continues over to
the study door. Now the Soiled Dove turns, and we see
the scared/confused expression. Maybe it's because she
is not Artemus.
ANGLE - GORDON - ACROSS ROOM
He's the mountain man in the fringe jacket. And right
now he's shaking his head as he watches West resort to a
decidedly low-tech surveillance method of Loveless's
study.
GORDON
Peeking through the keyhole...?
So 18th Century.
58
58
KEYHOLE - NIGHT
McGrath paces in front of Loveless's desk.
McGRATH
Dr. Loveless, my men are ready to
go to war with no weapons to
fight. Ever since the nitro and
the guns were destroyed at Fat-
Can's, lice and demoralization
have set in!
LOVELESS
Your men will have their weapons
tonight. And my promise that they
will be part of the greatest
military victory of this century!
McGrath's face relaxes into a pyorrheic grin.
McGRATH
Oh, you're a pip, sir! I'd follow
you into the maw of Cerberus
himself!
Loveless takes pencil in hand and draws a map on the
desk.
(CONTINUED)

LOVELESS
And so you shall.

Have your men here at... 10
o'clock tonight.
Loveless wheels his chair toward the door with McGrath
behind him folding up the map...
59
59
ducks out of the way as Loveless and McGrath emerge from
the study. As they disappear into the throng of well-
wishers, West takes a thin lock-pick out of his hat band.
It takes him a moment or two, but the LOCK finally
CLICKS. Then West slips inside, apparently undetected --
except by an unimpressed Gordon.
60
60
moves quickly to the desk past walls filled with oil
portraits of various Loveless relatives. The one behind
the desk is in the style of Gainsborough. A Loveless
uncle is standing on a windswept grouse moor, two English
setters by his side, a Holland and Holland double held in
the crook of his arm.
West turns his attention to the desk blotter. There's a
faint imprint where Loveless drew the map. West takes
his penknife and a pencil -- grates some graphite into
the depressions. He's just about to do a rubbing on a
piece of paper when... someone swipes it out of his hand.
ANGLE ON MISS EAST
Hands on hips, she gives him a "naughty, naughty" look.
MISS EAST
I said to meet me in the foyer.
WEST
Oh, the foy-aay. Sorry, I've
never been much good at French.
But instead of scolding him further, Miss East plants an
over-heated kiss on him. Tongues are involved. As they
break, she gives a little nod of approval.
MISS EAST
Au contraire...

She pushes him down into Dr. Loveless's chair.
MISS EAST
So let's see, Mr. West... are you
a dangerous spy of some sort? Or
just a handsome cowboy who likes
to... poke around.
WEST
Um... that second one.
She starts to undo the buttons of his trousers. But
West has a job to do. Well, maybe he can do two jobs at
once...
61
61
NIGHT
is being the perfect party guest, moving through the
crowd chit-chatting with this person and that (in
French, Spanish, German) when he sees something of
interest.
Munitia and Lippenreider come out of an upstairs bedroom,
lock it behind them. Hmmm. What's in there? As he
starts upstairs, Amazonia appears, blocking his way.
GORDON
Howdy there... big sturdy gal.
Yer dance card full?
Amazonia stares at him, then spiels off a couple lines
in a foreign language that makes Gordon's eyes widen.
He understands what she said and it's not flattering.
Gordon moves off in a shock.
62
62
are locked in a passionate embrace. West manages to
position her nearly-naked rear end over the graphite
powder. Very carefully, he stands, pushing her buttocks
onto the desk and then rolling her off. The imprint on
her left cheek is perfect. But unfortunately, it's
backwards!
CLOSE - WEST
Damn. He lets Miss East concentrate on what she's doing,
which from the SOUNDS O.S., doesn't appear to be a
demonstration of the correct way to butter corn.

West spies a mirror on the other side of the room and
raises her ass up into position so he can see the
corrected reflection.
ANGLE ON MIRROR - MAP
COMES INTO VIEW. It clearly shows the meeting place to
be Malheureux Point, northeast of New Orleans. But the
mirror reflects something else of interest...
63
63
The painting behind him has come to life. The Loveless
in the painting swings a real shotgun around and is
pointing it at the back of West's head.
CLOSE - WEST
suddenly contorts his upper torso just as an EXPLOSION
rips the back of the chair where his head would have
been.
He draws and SHOOTS the would-be assassin, who falls out
of the painting, dead. West turns to see...
ANGLE ON MISS EAST
A surprised look on her face. A hole in her forehead.
He lowers her head gently to the ground, regards her
map-imprinted rear end.
WEST
Thanks for helpin' me get to the
bottom of this case.

NIGHT
eases in, stops at what he sees. And it sure ain't
scientists. Beside the bed, locked in an iron disco-like
cage, is Rita, still wearing her scanty outfit. Gordon
squints at her, gives a charming smile.
GORDON
I feel as if we know each other
from someplace...?
RITA
Try again, buster...!

RITA
(dryly)
Really?
To Rita's amazement, Gordon opens his jacket and
unbuttons his vest to reveal... a complete miniature tool
shop. Quickly he pulls out a thin cable and attaches it
to a tiny wheel on the spur of one of his boots.
RITA
I'm Rita. I was hired here as an
entertainer. Not that I'm
complaining, but what are you
doin' in here?
GORDON
(looking up miles
of leg)
Looking for some missing
scientists... not that I'm
complaining.
Gordon unsnaps the sole of his shoe. It becomes a pedal
that operates the wheels' rotation. Now he removes a bit
and handle from his vest and attaches the cable. Starts
to pump his foot. It's a foot-powered drill.
GORDON
I'm a special U.S. Marshal on
assignment from the President.
RITA

If you're so special, how come

Too late. The 'dungeon' is

But Rita isn't listening to the food review. Her mind's
racing. Finally, the LOCK CLICKS and the cage door
swings open. Gordon takes the distressed damsel in his
arms, lifts her out.
RITA
(suddenly a coquettish
smile)
Thank you... Artemus, was it?
GORDON
One doesn't forget a smile like
that. Now where in the world was

Empire Room... the Bijou Cafe

A reb battalion waits in a foggy meadow that slopes down
to marsh. Beyond that is the Gulf of Mexico. We
recognize one of the REBS from the cathouse. He opens
his pocket watch.
REB #1
They oughta be here by now.
REB #2
Maybe we're in the wrong place.
REB #1
(rechecks map)
No, we're supposed to wait 'xactly
on this here spot.
Suddenly they hear a CLANKING and SCREECHING coming from
the marsh. They ready their arms and get in defensive
positions. What they can't see through the fog is...
ANGLE - MARSH - ARMORED TANK
amphibiously sludges up through the mud and reeds,
passing by the dumbstruck soldiers as it heads to the
center of the field. The contraption has a large cannon
and Gatling guns bristling from several ports. The Rebs
cheer their new weapon.
THE WILD WILD WEST - Rev. 7/1/98

71
Now a MORTAR appears through the turret and FIRES a
ROCKET that EXPLODES over the Reb soldiers, illuminating
the field. As soldiers shield their eyes from the
blinding light...
ANGLE - AERIAL SHOT - LOOKING DOWN ON FIELD
Unbeknownst to the Rebs, Loveless has mowed and stained
the field with concentric lines to give it a giant dart
board appearance.
Suddenly the TANK TURRET OPENS FIRE on them. Once over
their initial shock, the Rebs FIRE BACK with their
Springfield RIFLES. But the BULLETS PING off the tank's
impenetrable skin like goober peas.
72
73
A black waits ominously on the tracks. It's less a
traditional train car than a riveted, armored, turreted fortress
on wheels. Also, it currently lacks an engine.
Loveless, over his shoulder to the foreign contingent...

He looks dotingly at the TANK, which CLATTERS up from the
battlefield on its treads... then drives onto the tracks.
Wheels drop down out of the chassis, the treads retract
up, and the TANK BACKS INTO the rest of the TRAIN.
CLANK. It's a neat modular fit. Black death on rails.
The foreigners watch with awe as...

wheels up onto the tank/train. He drops the
expansiveness, fixes them with a viper's eye.
LOVELESS
If you don't want to miss the
ride, have the last payment of

The dead men are all in the #9 or #10 ring.

West slowly dismounts, transfixed by the slaughter on the
pre-fab battlefield. There's something hauntingly familiar
about all this for him -- the mangled bodies, the tread marks...
But we'll find out about that later.

victims. The pace of his search quickens when he isn't
finding what he's looking for -- General McGrath.

passes the mangled corpses.
GORDON
It came up out of the lake...

positioned, laid down a 360-degree
pattern of cannon fire... then
disappeared in moments.
(puts a foot on a body,
scratches his chin)
My God, what kind of weapon is it?
Rita can't handle Gordon's clinical posturing.
RITA
Excuse me, I think I'm going to be
sick.
As she walks quickly away, West comes over, a haunted
look on his face.
WEST
It just rolls on and on. Makes a
screeching sound -- like a wounded
animal. Got a 'cabin' on top with
a cannon... swivels 'round like an
eagle's head.
GORDON
You saw it?
WEST
Heard about it. Thought it was
crazy survivors' stories.
GORDON
What survivors? There aren't any
here.
WEST
New Liberty, Illinois -- the free
slave town just over the border.
Just one week before the War ended
in '65. I was in the 9th Cavalry
that discovered it. Old men,
women, children... they used them
for target practice...

Gordon is sympathetic to his obvious pain -- just shuts
up. West's grim reverie is interrupted by MOANING coming
from the shoreline. They all follow the sound to find...

General McGrath, washed up on the shore. West looks down
at him. Now Rita, still looking green around the gills,
rejoins the party.
WEST
That's when I vowed to follow
McGrath to the end of the earth.
As grey as four-day-old mullet, McGrath manages a smile
for his relentless pursuer.
McGRATH
(barely audible)
What's the matter, West? Thought
you'd be happy to find me... like
this.
WEST
I was hoping to kill you myself.
RITA
That's a nice way to talk to
people.
McGRATH
You'll have to live with it... As
I've lived with the blame for New
Liberty.
McGrath fades out.
West grabs him and shakes him.
WEST
What do you mean?
McGRATH
(opens eyes)
It was Loveless... his plan. He
operated the killing machine
there. Smarter now... left it to
others here.
With the meaning of it all sinking in, West grabs McGrath
by the collar and pulls him toward him.

Where is he?
Where did he go?!

Well, I know that.
West turns to her... well?
RITA

West and Gordon burst in, surprising Coleman, who's got
his feet up, perusing the Playboy of the day -- a mail
order catalogue.

On the way to Utah where our

oughta be worryin' about that
little coincidence!
As the ENGINE ROARS to life...

GORDON
We wouldn't have known where
Loveless was going if it wasn't
for her. Seems a bit ungracious.
Possibly perilous.
WEST
Look, all that would happen would
be she'd get in our way and I'd
probably wind up gettin' in the
saddle with her.
GORDON
Funny that you say that. Because
I thought she was more interested
in me.

WEST
Good luck on that one.
GORDON

Ha, ha, ha... You know, I can't
imagine what Loveless -- a man
without any reproductive organs
could possibly want with Rita.
Suddenly there's a WHOOSH and Rita falls through the
ceiling and plops in the chair just like West did
earlier. He instinctively pulls his gun. Puts it
away as Gordon muses about her anatomy.
GORDON (O.S.)
(not realizing she's
there)
Not that Rita doesn't have a
figure that would inspire a
Botticelli... or a Raphael.
Rita raises an eyebrow, looks to the galley as Gordon
comes out with a platter of food. He still doesn't
see her there.
GORDON
... especially her breasts. Did
you notice the way one of them...
(cups his hands)
Both of them actually... to say
nothing of her buttocks...
Gordon turns and looks into the car. Finally sees her.
Changes gears without missing a beat.
GORDON

ministers at Loveless's party...

Gordon gestures for West to join him at the pool table.
Rita immediately goes for the food.

RITA
Well, I heard you talking about
why all those foreign guys were
at Loveless's party...? You
want me to tell you?

By all means.
She uses the time to get another bite into her mouth.

They were mad about something,
you know? Something about a
real bad deal in Louisiana on
purpose.
GORDON
The Louisiana Purchase?
RITA
And Queen somebody-somebody of
France got swindled.
GORDON
Queen Isabella of Spain.
West rolls his eyes.
WEST
Gordon, this is crazy. She

West picks up the speaker horn and calls Coleman.

Coleman, stop the train! Miss
Escobar's getting off.
COLEMAN (V.O.)

West looks out the window. Nothing but sagebrush and
animal skulls out there. Rita comes up close to Jim,
fire in her big, brown eyes.
RITA
Please, Jim. My father's the only
family I've got. What am I
supposed to do? Sit home and wait
for news he's been killed? Or go
do something! What would you do,
Jim?!
That gets the man of action where he lives.
WEST
Look, I got nothing against you,
Rita. It's just that... What's
going to happen when we catch up
to Loveless... with you on the
train?
She grabs West's hand.
RITA
I know you'd never let him take me
back. I've seen you shoot.
West kinda melts a little. This girl does have her
charms. Gordon, a little jealous, puffs his chest out.
GORDON
I assure you, Rita, an attack by
Loveless would be an exercise in
futility.
(stands for tour)
... Allow me to demonstrate how my
design suggestions have made the
Wanderer impervious to attack.
West draws his guns, twirls them and reholsters.

GORDON
An attacker would find the
lighting inside extremely...
unflattering.
Finally he moves to the billiard table, while Rita nods
... and keeps eating.
GORDON
And if, by some inconceivable
fluke, they did manage to gain
entrance...
(rolls billiard ball

An innocent billiard ball this
way.

presses the number)
But depress the number... a
sleeping gas bomb. Effective in
under three seconds.
Gordon unclicks it, triumphantly rolls it into a pocket.
GORDON
So rest assured, Rita... you are
completely safe within these
walls.
West snorts at his obvious play for Rita's attentions.
WEST
I don't know about you, ma'am, but
I know I'll be sleeping a whole
lot better tonight...

West and Gordon have bunked down on opposite couches,

WEST
Loveless kidnapped two chemists,
that means there's gonna be
explosives. He's got a metallurgist,
so there's gonna be heavy armor.
And he's got Rita's father, who --
according to you -- is the world's
foremost specialist in hydraulics.
Which means, whatever it is... it's
gonna move.
West sits up.
WEST
So what, is he building that's

As they scramble for boots, weapons, Rita comes out of her
room.
RITA

Gordon ushers her to the back.
GORDON
Stay back here, take cover!
Meanwhile, West pulls on his boot. When he stands on it,
a three-inch STILETTO SNAPS out of the toe.

Then perhaps you could explain

As West looks out the back too... KA-BOOM!! A SHELL
EXPLODES just to the right of them. Now ANOTHER
EXPLOSION to the left of them. The Wanderer rocks
precariously from wheel to wheel, throwing a screaming

West is gone as the pool table flips over. As Rita
covers her mouth in amazement...

Gordon and Rita are looking out the back when they see

wall.
As metal barbs flick out, locking the tip in, and the
steel chain it's attached to draws tight...

Loveless has only a moment to gloat over his marksmanship
before the compartment begins filling with smoke.
Choking clouds that send Loveless et al into coughing
fits.
LOVELESS
Close the fire door!
Just in time, Amazonia swings it shut as the unvented
BOILER EXPLODES, sending a FIREBALL ripping through the
back of the train, destroying it. Up ahead...

Gordon and Rita are thrown across the car, along with
everything else inside, as Loveless's train's sudden
stop... jerks them with it. The SCREECH of STEEL WHEELS
SCRAPING on IRON RAILS is sickening. They clutch onto
one another... as the Wanderer skids to a stop.
As they pick themselves up, Gordon looks to Rita who's
shaken up and scared. Now FOOTSTEPS coming up the
stairs.
RITA
I won't let Loveless take me
again! I'd rather be dead!
GORDON
(recalling West's
words)
That's not a good one to wish for.
To defend herself, Rita grabs one of the sleeping-gas
pool balls rolling around on the ground. Gordon leads
her into the stateroom to lock her in, but she grabs his
hand.
RITA
Please, Artemus, don't leave me

Rita closes the door behind him and locks it.

MUNITIA

Shut up and listen to a real

Finally Loveless taps Colorado, Kansas, Utah and Nevada
-- now labelled as "Loveless Land." Smiles impishly.
LOVELESS
And a tiny piece for me to retire
on.
There's appreciative laughter.
175
175
stumbles in and looks around discouraged.
The place has been ransacked. The gun cabinets are
empty, the Gatling lamp removed. All that's left is
Gordon's Nitro-cycle and his wardrobe full of dresses.
West tries every secret hiding place. Nothing. Finally
he finds Gordon's belt buckle/derringer. He opens the
breech. Only one dinky bullet. He throws down the belt
in disgust.

sits behind a desk that has been brought to center stage.
Loveless unrolls a document, signs his half of it.
LOVELESS
My partner nations insist that we
make this as legal as possible.
Personally, I like the symmetry of
it. After all wasn't it you who
made us sign a surrender at
Appomattox?
Loveless snaps his fingers. Amazonia drags Grant out of
his seat and sticks a pen in his manacled hands.
PRESIDENT GRANT
Never will I sign that paper,
never will the United States ever
surrender!

LOVELESS
Well, sir, we're at loggerheads
then, aren't we? And I suppose
the threat of death to someone
with your valorous war record,
would mean nothing.
Grant sets his jaw intractably.
He's right about that.
LOVELESS
... so, if you still refuse to
sign this surrender... we'll start
by shooting your man, Gordon.
Loveless whirls, nods to Amazonia who drags the President
back to his seat, pulls Gordon out of his. Rita can't
help her outburst.
RITA
Artemus!
Artemus smiles at her, extremely brave under the
circumstances. He whispers to Rita and the President.
GORDON
(tugs at his vest)
Don't worry, I'm wearing the
Impermeable.
Rita turns to Grant. What the hell is that? Gordon has
no time to explain as Amazonia hauls him up on the stage.
As Munitia aims her rifle... Gordon holds up a finger.
GORDON
If I may have one request... it's
that she aim at my heart... which
has loved this great country so
much!
LOVELESS
(considers for a moment)
Shoot him in the head.
GORDON
Great.
Munitia cocks her rifle, then just as Loveless holds his
hands up for the signal to fire... the lights dim...
97.

177
A candle-powered spotlight swings across the stage and
illuminates... a deep-throated, bluesy black CHANTEUSE
who starts singing the popular cathouse song, "Hangtown
Gals."
CHANTEUSE
(singing)
'Ohhh... Hangtown gals are plump
and rosy...'
Loveless wheels his chair around to take a gander and
forgets Gordon's execution instantly. And why not?
She's young and beautiful in a RuPaul sort of way. About
six feet tall, wearing the blue sequined number Gordon
had in his dressing room.
Accessorized with black mesh stockings, big feather boa,
silver-buckled belt, lots of frilly petticoats for those
can-can moves.
CHANTEUSE
(singing)
'Hair in ringlets, mighty cozy...'
She winds her finger around her ringlets and sticks out
her derriere to the crowd. They stare, mouths agape at
this piece of ass worthy of Othello.
CLOSE - LOVELESS
Intrigued.
Well, maybe more than intrigued.
LOVELESS
A new girl!
What a nice surprise!
He motions to hold up Gordon's execution, rolls to her.
CHANTEUSE
'Painted cheeks and frilly
corsets.'
(bends over showing
her undergarment)
Touch them...'
Loveless hears this as an invitation, reaches out with
his hand and whap! She slaps him right in the face.
CHANTEUSE
'... And they'll sting like
hornets!'
(CONTINUED)
98.
177

There's a hush in the crowd. Loveless, a red handprint
on his face, is a little nonplussed. Amazonia moves in
threateningly, but Loveless stops her, starts to laugh.
LOVELESS
(making her name up
on the spot)
Ebonia! Why are you so cruel to
me?
Ebonia has escaped a head-cutting neck bracelet. But she
probably shouldn't be teasing a man who's having "ghost
aches" in certain amputated places.
ANGLE - GORDON
waiting to be executed.
Something's not quite kosher
about her for Gordon.
GORDON
(musing to himself)
I have a dress like that.
ANGLE - CHANTEUSE
Now with the crowd singing along, she pulls out all the
stops. Her gestures and dance moves become more
exaggerated, she's in the thrall of her audience.
CHANTEUSE
(singing)
'Hangtown gals are lovely
creatures
Think they'll marry Mormon
preachers.'
She sashays over to the French dignitary, pulls his
monocle out of his eye and blows hot breath on it,
steaming it up. As she pops it back on his face...
CHANTEUSE
(singing)
'Heads thrown back to show their
features...'
Now she puts her cheek next to Rita as if matching their
relative beauty while picking the pocket of Lippenreider.
Rita pushes her away disgustedly but not before Ebonia
hands Coleman the keys to the cuffs. Coleman looks from
the keys to Ebonia. He just caught on.

COLEMAN
Go, Ebonia, go.
Then Ebonia prances on stage to Gordon, cuddles up to
him. Gordon looks at the big beautiful black woman with
a mixture of amusement and relief. Of course, it's his
"I'd rather be dead" partner, Jim West.
WEST
(singing)
Ha... Ha... Hangtown girls...
GORDON
Not to sound ungrateful, but you're
a little over the top.
WEST
(sings)
Ha... Ha... Ha...
West/Ebonia wraps the feather boa around Gordon's neck --
hiding the derringer in the palm of his hand. Gordon looks
worried. What's he going to do with a gun? As he tucks
it up his sleeve...
GORDON
Let me warn you about that
dress...
WEST
Gotta go. Big finish...
(belts it out)
'Ha, ha, ha! Hangtown gals!!!'
An immediate standing ovation. The diversion allows
Coleman to unlock both Grant's and Rita's shackles.
Grant looks at the keys.
PRESIDENT GRANT
Where'd those come from...?
COLEMAN
(nods to Ebonia)
Captain West.
Their eyes practically pop out of their heads.

Wait a minute. What the hell
is this?
He stops, but his tassels are still spinning on their
own.
178
178
Immediately two FLAME THROWERS EXPLODE from his cone-like
bosoms.
Maybe he should've listened about the dress. He turns to
Gordon questioningly, and inadvertently incinerates one of
Loveless's goons. He howls in pain, runs panicked...
right into Rita.
RITA
Serves you right for staring at
them.
As she relieves the charred goon of his keys... Loveless
turns to the rest of his goons.
LOVELESS
Kill him!
(off their confused
looks, points)
Him! Him! The girl!
Finally getting it, they rush Ebonia. Even his 4th of
July breasts aren't a match for them. Desperate, West
reaches way down in his undergarments to retrieve one of
Gordon's billiard balls. He depresses the number and
rolls it at the guards.
GORDON
Was that the eight ball?
WEST
Mmm-hmm.
Gordon grabs West and Rita, pulls them behind the bar.

Rita jumps up and makes her way through the smoke to a
bearded SCIENTIST.
WEST/GORDON
Rita!
She unlocks his neck collar, turns to them and smiles.
RITA
(disappearing into
the chaos)
Meet me after the show!
Both West and Gordon look after her with yearning as
three goons charge them. Coleman, amazed at their
torpor, quickly grabs a RIFLE from the incinerated goon
and OPENS FIRE. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!
Three goons drop. Gordon and West exchange looks.
Not bad for an emphysemic old engineer.
COLEMAN
Special Marshal... President
thought you needed some lookin'
after.
Speaking of the President... he's grabbed a dead goon's
RIFLE, and is LAYING DOWN a pretty good field of FIRE
himself. Suddenly, he gets a tap on the shoulder from
behind. It's Amazonia. Whap, she sends a right to his
chin knocking him out. She throws him over her shoulder
and carries him away.

DUSK
As fire engulfs the place, Loveless has no choice but to
retreat... for now. Surrounded by a cadre of his women,
who carry the unconscious President Grant, Loveless heads
through a round STEEL VAULT DOOR. As Amazonia swings the
door closed, the foreign dignitaries BANG on the door
begging for admittance.

West plunges down into the metal chamber. Oiled pistons,
thrusting. Steam, billowing. Struggles to his feet.
There, out of the shadows, steps...
KNIFE GUY
He's a mess... no hands, just brass collars where they
used to be. They lock eyes.
WEST
So, I guess you're the one who's
gonna give me my whoopin'.
They square off. A beat. Then, a long steely blade
shoots out from where his left hand used to be.

WEST
Pfft.

West reveals the less impressive four inch stiletto in
his boot. Knife Guy responds by producing another
blade from his other cuff.
WEST
But you've got two of those.
(beat)
Okay, lemme talk to Gordon, I'll
see if he can...
No time for talk. Knife Guy does a bad-ass series of
moves. The blades criss-crossing one another at blinding
speed. West, unimpressed, retorts with a lame shake of
his stiletto and boot.
And the fight begins...
Knife Guy attacks! West narrowly escapes each thrust of
the knife, and attempts a kick to the groin... but comes
up short -- The stiletto collides with one of the blades
and snaps like a carrot. His only weapon... gone.
WEST
Damn.
West rolls onto the railing to avoid the attack. Sparks
fly as the Knife Guy tries to slice and dice West but
misses each time, hitting the metal railing instead.
West rolls to the floor, sucking air. Knife Guy lands
a kick to West's ribs. And to make matters worse...
WRENCH GUY
just showed up. He swings his wrench at West's head.
West ducks but gets kicked in the back. He sails across
the room, lands flat on his back. Now...
SHOVEL GUY
makes an appearance. He hammers his shovel at West's
groin, over and over. (West is in a crab position and
backs up to avoid this.) West finally gets a kick in
-- it does a moderate amount of damage.
Wrench Guy appears and swings his huge wrench at West's
head. West escapes it, barely...
Knife Guy thrusts a side-kick at West's chest, but West
catches his foot, holds on for dear life.

Wrench Guy is inbound, with wrench in hand. He swings
on West, but West blocks it with Knife Guy's leg... OUCH!
West punches both of them. Wrench Guy tumbles OUT OF
FRAME.
West stands. Looking for a way out, but... no luck...
Shovel Guy attacks. West ducks and the shovel connects
squarely with Knife Guy's blades. West crouches and
throws two simultaneous punches, each connecting with a
set of jewels.
West stands, follows it up with a right cross and left
hook and these two jokers wind up OUT OF FRAME.
Now... the Wrench Guy is on his feet and he's pissed!
He attacks West, lands a solid kick to the chest and
West flies backward toward a...
HANGING CHAIN
which he grabs. He scales the gears, gets a solid grip,
then swings, a huge arc across the room, gaining momentum,
and kicks Shovel Guy and Wrench Guy at the same time! Off
their feet they go, slamming onto the metal floor.
West lands. Knife Guy attacks. West uses the chain to
block the blades which are flying at him, left and right.
Sparks fly. West manages to wrap the chain around one of
the knives, locks it down, and heaves it into the gears...
the blade snaps.
WEST
No more Mister Knife guy!
West drops a stiff right-cross on the chin of the Knife
Guy... wobbles his legs a bit. But before West can follow
up...
ANOTHER BLADE SHOOTS OUT
to replace the broken one.
It stops about a half-an-inch
from West's nose.
A struggle ensues, but West manages to wrap the chain
around Knife Guy's neck and string him up.
West throws a kick to his back... Knife Guy, hanging by
his neck, flies through the belly... (the chain is on a
track)... and out of the mouth of the beast, down into
the abyss, chain and all.
Shovel Guy springs to his feet and swings on West. West
grabs the shovel and they struggle for possession...

Wrench Guy comes out of nowhere and wants a piece of the
action. But West uses the shovel to deflect the swing-
ing wrench... sparks fly.
West gains sole possession of the shovel and mule-kicks
Shovel Guy OUT OF FRAME. West spins just in time to
land a crippling blow to Wrench Guy's back.
Shovel Guy grabs the shovel. He and West tug-o'-war again.
West ducks under the shovel and moves back-to-front with
him. West elbows him in the ribs. He responds by putting
West in a choke hold. West swings the shovel wildly but
hits his target -- shovel Guy's head!
West steps back, gets his footing and, for good measure,
whacks him in the back.
Wrench Guy attacks. West defends himself with the shovel
and lands a stiff kick to his stomach. Wrench Guy goes
down...
West turns, hits Shovel Guy in the chest with the shovel
and he goes down...
Wrench Guy sneaks up on West from behind and swings at
his head. West, on instinct, lifts the shovel and blocks
the deadly blow at the last second.
West has now found his rhythm...
He swings and shovel and connects with... first, the
foot, then the chin, and last but not least, the head --
BOINK! West drops the shovel and, World Wrestling
Federation style, picks him up and hurls him into the
space between the gears. We won't see him anymore!
West pivots and WHACK!... Shovel Guy plants a neat
little roundhouse kick squarely on West's jaw. West
backs up and catches another in the stomach. Then...
Shovel Guy really shows what he's made of...
He does a series of jump-kicks, round-houses and fan-
kicks into the air. All perfectly timed, all deadly.
SHOVEL GUY
I learned that from a Chinaman.
West, without missing a beat, steps on the shovel, which
flips into his hand and -- WHACK! -- lands a clean one
right on the top of Shovel Guy's melon.
WEST
I just made that up.

West casts the shovel out into the abyss.
WEST

Is that all you got for me,
Loveless?!
West, exhausted, turns and sees...
METAL HEAD
all seven feet of him. The top of his head is a metal
plate. Extending downward, encircling his eyes. West
soaks him in, sighs.
WEST
Uh, I just threw my shovel out.
So this really isn't fair. If
you don't mind, I'd like to...
West, at lightning speed, throws a sucker-punch/spin-
ning back-fist to Metal Head's jaw... PING! That one
really hurt... West's hand, that is. Metal Head isn't
fazed a bit. West throws another shot, this time to
the gut... PING! Then a kick to the groin... PING!!!
WEST
(incredulous)
Noooo.
Metal Head has had enough. He effortlessly picks West
up by his lapels and flings him across the room. West
tumbles, and lands right next to...
WRENCH
He picks it up and starts swinging! A shot to the body
... PING! Then another... PING! Then another... PINGGGG!
Metal Head lurches forward, absorbing each blow with not
so much as a twitch of the eye. West furries... PING!
PING! PING! PING!... nothing! He goes for the head...
PINNNNNNGGGG!... nothing! West is out of time. He's been
backed up as far as he can go. His heels are dangling
over the mouth of the beast, a thousand feet above the
rocky cliff.

West slowly gets up. Loveless is about to roll over
him. He jumps up in the air, grabs onto an overhead
strut, reverses and shoves the wheelchair off the ramp
jamming the wheels.
A smile comes to West's face as he watches Loveless's
frustrated attempts at going forward and backward.
WEST
When you get right down to it,
Loveless, you just can't beat
a good pair of legs.
LOVELESS
(thin smile)
You're obviously not a poker
player, Mr. West...
Loveless presses a button, the sound of MECHANICAL GEARS
ENGAGING. Suddenly four metal legs appear from underneath
the wheelchair, raising his body to a height of six foot ten.
LOVELESS
Two pair always beats a pair.
West stares up at him slack-jawed. Loveless rolls up his
sleeves, steps away from the wheelchair ready to fight.
LOVELESS
Now... Was it someone particularly
close to you who perished in that
military action?
West responds with a roundhouse kick to the chin that
makes Loveless spin around on the platform of his chair.

Mr. West, a man of primitive
vigours uncomplicated by
intellect. And on the other,
there's Mr. Gordon. A man of
ideas, but unlike myself, lacks
the passion to kill for them.
He'd like to be able to act his
way out of it. And for some
reason when he's actin', someone
always seems to get killed.
Loveless puts more pressure on West's head, he groans.
Gordon aims.
WEST
(gasps)
Shoot him, Gordon...!
LOVELESS
I'm right about you, aren't I,
Gordon? And that's why I'm

Then I'm going to kill you.
POP! The SHOT startles Loveless, West and even Gordon.
But when Loveless realizes that he's not hit, he laughs.
LOVELESS
After all that, you missed.
GORDON
Not exactly.
He gestures down Loveless's legs to a punctured metal
tube that's spraying a stream of hydraulic fluid all over
the deck -- rendering the foot on West's head, powerless.
West gets out from under, rubs his neck to regain
circulation.

Charging him. They smash into him, driving him to the
rail. As they pummel him, trying to throw him over,
Gordon realizes this is no time for passivity. He
retaliates with a series of chops and kicks that would
make West proud. Over the rail, goes Lippenreider. In
that split-second before she drops, Gordon mouths
"bye-bye."
Before he can savor the moment further, Amazonia clubs
him from behind. Gordon whirls and hits her so hard it
surprises them both. Over the railing she goes! As
Amazonia hovers there, President Grant gives her the
kick in the pants she needs to go sailing.

WEST
For almost four long years I've

Whimpering pathetically, he uncouples his body from the

Please, West... show a little mercy
to a poor defenseless cripple...
WEST
(imitating his accent)
Now, now, Doctor... let's not cloud
this otherwise sunny day with that
poor-ol'-me-cripple-talk. Just
buck up and say to yourself, 'I am
indefatigably hard-pumpin' and
steely!'
Loveless gets to his wheelchair and collapses in it.
LOVELESS
After I kill ya, I swear I'm gonna
boil you down to axle grease!
WEST
Now that's the ol' doctor I know!
But the smile fades from West's face when he sees Loveless's
shotgun armrests pop out leveled at his waist.
West has nowhere to go but up as he leaps to grab the
I-beam over his head just as Loveless pulls the triggers
on both BARRELS... BOOM! BOOM!
The SHOTS almost blow the heels off West's boots. They
PUNCTURE a PIPE behind him. Steam spews out. This is
going to have an effect on something.
210
212
The sudden stopping jerks Loveless' wheelchair free.
Despite his frantic efforts, he's rolling toward the
opposite railing. When the wheelchair hits a pool of
hydraulic fluid on the deck, it spins him around 180
degrees.
West jumps up, grabs a girder. The wheelchair spins
under West's legs and then -- CLANK -- it slams into
the railing and wedges there.
213
214
The jolt shoots West off the girder. He free-falls
through the belly and out into the open air. Thinking
quickly, he grabs onto the back of Loveless' wheel-
chair. His arms nearly torn from their sockets. His
weight causes the wheelchair to shift, now leaving it
hanging on by a thread. West reaches out, grabs the
wheel of the chair and hangs there.
LOVELESS
Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle.
How did we arrive in this dark
situation?
WEST
I don't know.
Guess I'm stumped!
LOVELESS
And I'm so cotton-pickin' afraid
of heights. They just give me the
spooks!
WEST
Ah, don't be afraid, Loveless.
With this being the last leg of
our journey and all, you should
soak in the view, you're really
missing something.

Loveless and his evil plot a fading memory.
Grant turns to West and Gordon.
PRESIDENT GRANT
Gentlemen, I now strongly believe
the United States is going to be
truly united. Not because of this
railroad... but because of you.

Grant scans the crowd, every race seems present at this
momentous event. He reaches into his pocket, takes out
two silver shields.
PRESIDENT GRANT
I've signed into law the creation
of an agency whose sole duty is to
protect the President and the
country from lunatics like
Loveless.
(pins badges on
their vests)
Welcome to the Secret Service,
Agents No. 1 and No. 2.

The President shakes both their hands.
Gordon resists
looking down.
GORDON
Uh, just out of curiosity, sir...
who's Agent No. 1?
Grant just shakes his head, some things never change.
PRESIDENT GRANT
I don't think that matters very
much, do you? Gordon? Besides,
you'll have plenty of time to
discuss it on your new assignment.
(hands them piece
of paper)
See you back in Washington.
He snaps off a salute, starts to go as they read it.
Gordon looks up, very troubled.
GORDON
But, sir... what about our train?
PRESIDENT GRANT
(over shoulder)
Well, I'm taking it of course.
Hell, you let Loveless blow up
mine.
As they look at one another in dismay...
RITA (O.S.)
Jim... Arte...?
They turn to see Rita approaching them from a crowd of
scientists. She's looking extraordinarily fetching
in a print dress and parasol.
West and Gordon sit up like dogs.
WEST
Rita!
You look great.
GORDON
Ravishing, a vision.
She hugs West, she hugs Gordon.
Who's it gonna be?
RITA
I just wanted to thank you for
everything you've done for me...
before I went back home to Texas.
(CONTINUED)
117.

WEST
Texas? Why're you going back
there? Why don't you come with me
back to Washington?
GORDON
Or better still, come with me to
Washington. I could introduce you
to people I still know in the
theater...
WEST
She's not really an entertainer,
remember?
RITA
(intercedes)
I can't go with either of you.
She looks from one crestfallen suitor to the other.
RITA
It's not that you both don't have
your attributes.
(to Gordon)
You're so sophisticated and such a
wonderful cook.
(to West)
Jim, you're good with a gun... and
have great legs.
(to both)
And you're both so brave. But...
I'm afraid I haven't been
completely honest with you.
WEST AND GORDON
Uh-oh...
RITA
Professor Escobar's not my father.
He's my husband.
She gestures to a handsome goateed Latino waiting for
her. Shaved and cleaned up, he's not the old man we
thought.
WEST
Rita... why didn't you just tell
us that in the first place?
(CONTINUED)
118.

RITA
Well, I was going to... but would
you have really brought me along
if I said I was married?
Honestly.
Neither West nor Gordon knows what to say.
RITA
I didn't think so.
She turns and starts to walk away.
Stops and smiles.
RITA
At least you still have each
other.
As West and Gordon look at one another...
