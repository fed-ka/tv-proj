      head and arms punched out holes, walking down the street
      with Teenage Virginia.  A man jumps out of the bushes in a
      scary mask and a trench coat.  Three-year-old Jimmy turns*
      and runs in the opposite direction.

                    It started when I was three, and I
                    had a really great costume as 
                    "Kitchen Garbage Bag Man."  But then
                    my Halloween was ruined by some jerk
                    that lives in our neighborhood.

      Suddenly two teenage boys run by.  One of them grabs Maw

      Virginia starts to walk towards Maw Maw who has gotten up*

      Maw Maw and Virginia are on the porch.  Maw Maw rings the

                    She's the kid.

      Virginia circles her finger around her ear to indicate that
      Maw Maw is crazy.  She then motions for Robin to give Maw
      Maw the candy.

                                      ROBIN
                    No candy for people over fourteen. 
                    It's trick-or-treating not
                    panhandling.

      Robin slams the door in their face.  Maw Maw turns to
