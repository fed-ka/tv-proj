  11INT. HOTEL - WEDDING #1 ROOM - DAY

            A wedding is in progress.  Rows of well-dressed GUESTS.

          The attractive BRIDE and GROOM are holding hands, gazing
          into each other's eyes as REVEREND PURDY officiates.  The
          FLOWER GIRL moves to stand between the bride and groom. 
          They each take one of her hands.  A family.  SARAH, in a 
          tasteful bridesmaid dress, stands to the right of the
          bride.  Her eyes find --

          JOHNNY in the audience.  She smiles at him, he smiles
          back, but we can see his heart isn't in it.  In fact,
          Johnny looks downright uncomfortable -- a stark contrast
          to the beaming faces around him, including BRUCE's. 

                                        REVEREND PURDY
                        ...Into this holy estate these
                        two persons present come now to
                        be joined.

                                        BRIANNA (FLOWER GIRL)
                                (piping up)
                        Three.

                                        REVEREND PURDY
                        Excuse me?

                                        MARIA (BRIDE)
                                (gently correcting)
                        Three persons.

          PUSH IN on Johnny, his discomfort growing.

                                        REVEREND PURDY
                        Of course, dear girl, forgive me. 
                        Into this holy estate these three
                        persons present come now to be
                        joined.  If any one can show just
                        cause, why they may not lawfully
                        be joined together, let him speak
                        now, or forever hold his peace.

          The bride and groom smile.  Hell, the whole audience smiles
          at this quaint and unnecessary tradition.  Clearly no one
          could possibly oppose the marriage of such a lovely --

                                        JOHNNY
                                (jumping to his feet)
                          I object.

          The bride and groom, Reverend Purdy, Sarah, Bruce and
            literally every eye in the place turns to look at Johnny...

                                                                          SMASH CUT TO:


  22INT. MARIA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Johnny is roused from a VISION to find his hand is being
          vigorously pumped by the groom (ALEC).

                                        ALEC
                        -- we're so glad you could come. 
                        I know Sarah was disappointed
                        Walt had to work this weekend,
                        and it's great of you to fill in
                        as her escort.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (trying to shake off
                                his vision)
                        No problem.  I... love weddings.

          Johnny looks around.  There's the bride, MARIA, talking
          to Sarah.  We're at the rehearsal luncheon at Maria's
          house.  About twenty people in casually upscale clothes. 
          The meal is over and the champagne is flowing.  Alec claps
          Johnny on the shoulder as he moves off.

                                        ALEC
                        Anyway, glad you could be here
                        for the big event.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Oh yeah.  Me too.  Wouldn't wanna
                        miss it.

          Off Johnny, wondering what the hell to do now --

                                                                              FADE OUT.

  33INT. MARIA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS

          We're MOVING WITH JOHNNY through the room.  He passes  
          Bruce.

                                        BRUCE
                        Hey, man.  You look tense.  And I
                        may not be the psychic here, but
                        I know why.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You do?

                                        BRUCE
                        It's because there are some
                          beautiful single women here and
                        you were stupid enough to come as
                          a married woman's date.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah, that's it.

                                        BRUCE
                        I've known Alec and Maria since
                        we all worked at the hospital
                          together.  Let me introduce you
                        to some of her lady friends...

          Johnny moves over to Sarah and takes her arm, easing her
          away from a SMALL GROUP of bridesmaids.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I need to talk to you.

                                        SARAH
                        Okay, but I just want to introduce
                        you --

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's important.

          Sarah knows that tone.  She smiles apologetically at the
          other women and follows Johnny.  The bridesmaids all give
          each other looks.  What's going on there?  One in
          particular, PAM, is particularly interested.


  44INT. MARIA'S HOUSE - FOYER - MOMENTS LATER

          Johnny and Sarah have found a bit of privacy.

    4CONTINUED:4

          In the living room, the BEST MAN is making a toast which
          we will overhear but not really register.  Right now our
          focus is on Johnny.

                                        BEST MAN (O.C.)
                        When Alec asked me to be his best
                        man, I was honored.

                                        BEST MAN (O.C.) (CONT'D)
                        I couldn't think of a place I'd
                        rather be than standing up for
                        him on the day his new life begins
                        with the woman he loves...

                                        SARAH
                        Why would you be stopping the
                          wedding?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't know.  But I was pretty
                          vehement about it.

                                        SARAH
                        That's crazy. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Tell me about it. 

          Sarah sighs, letting it sink in.  This is bad.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The bride's your friend.  Any
                        idea why she shouldn't marry this
                        guy?

                                        SARAH
                        No.  Alec is great.  They're
                        perfect for each other.
                                (then)
                        Poor Maria.  She's been through
                        such a hard time the last few
                          years...  We were all so happy
                        when she and Alec fell in love.


          ANGLE ON ALEC & MARIA - INT. MARIA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

            listening to the Best Man's toast.  Alec holds the flower
          girl, his daughter BRIANNA, in his arms.

                                        BEST MAN
                        Most of us in this room know the
                          struggles and challenges that
                        have led up to this momentous
                          occasion.  Maria and I went to
                        med school together, which is
                        also where I had the privilege of
                        knowing Alec and Maria's dear
                        friend, Bryan Hampton, who is
                        truly the one who brought these
                        two special people together.

                        Bryan is very much missed, but I
                        know he's here in spirit, watching
                        some of us make fools out of
                          ourselves while trying to make an
                          appropriate toast.  So let me
                        just quit now while I'm behind
                        and say: Alec, Brianna, you could
                        not have picked a better woman to
                          complete your family. 
                                (raising his glass)
                        To -- not just the perfect couple --
                        but the perfect threesome.

                                        SARAH
                        Johnny, you're talking about
                          breaking up a family.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey, I don't like this any better
                        than you do.

          Sarah looks at him, sympathetic.

                                        SARAH
                        I know.  Maybe you could find out
                        more about what's going on.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Or maybe I could just go home
                        right now and forget about it.

                          Technically, I'm just a stand-in. 
                          I wasn't even supposed to be here.

          She might as well have asked him to strip naked and do
          the chicken dance.

          Sarah moves off as Johnny takes a deep breath and steps
          into the fray.   Bruce comes up to him.

          BRIDE -- whom we cannot see -- as she walks down the aisle. 
            A BRIDESMAID whispers within earshot of best man Johnny.

                        going to marry.

          Bruce whips around.

                          Great... personality?  Was she
                        beautiful?  Did she have a sense

                        I couldn't see her face.

          Bruce shoots him an incredulous look.

                        That is the most sorry ass vision
                        you've ever had.

                        Now I have to treat every woman
                        here like she might be "the one."

                        Then you don't have to marry her. 
                          Although many married couples
                          overlook that.

          JOHNNY reluctantly moves towards her, sees her set down
          her wine glass.  As she reaches for an hors d'oeuvre,
          JOHNNY sees his opportunity, quickly sweeps in, picks up
          her wine glass, triggering --


77A VISION - INT. HOTEL LOBBY - THE NEXT NIGHT

          We hear WEDDING BAND music as a tipsy Bruce, in a tux,
          bow tie askew, comes tumbling out of a door marked
            BALLROOM, a pretty but drunk and slightly disheveled
          BRIDESMAID tugging at his arm. 

                                        BRIDESMAID

                        You promised to Macarena with me.

          She dances closer, presses her hips against his
            suggestively.

                                        BRUCE
                        Things were getting a little too
                        hot in there.  I need a second to
                        cool off.

          The Bridesmaid laughs, takes Bruce's face in her hands,
          plants a wet one right on his mouth.  Bruce, caught off
          guard, resists for a beat, then starts to give in.  Just
          as it heats up, he feels a tap on his shoulder, turns and
          BAM!  He gets punched in the face by an ANGRY HUSBAND,
          wedding band gleaming as his fist strikes Bruce's jaw.
          Bruce goes down hard, then looks up from the floor.

                        you were stalking Maria?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Brianna showed me a drawing she
                        made of her, Maria and Alec.  The 
                        perfect family.  Only when I
                        touched it, I had a not so perfect
                        vision of me in the bushes outside
                        their house, watching Maria.

                                        SARAH
                          Watching her?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I had a weird vibe.  Kind of 
                        bitter.  Hostile.

          Before Sarah can respond, they're interrupted by overly-
          interested Pam, New York accent.

                                        PAM
                        Don't mean to break up this tete-
                        a-tete, just wanted to introduce
                        myself.  You must be Sarah's
                          husband, Walt.  I'm Pam Tanowitz.

                                        JOHNNY
                        No, I'm --

                        Sarah showed me a picture of your
                        little boy, J.J.  He's the cutest
                        thing, and now I see why.  He
                        looks just like his daddy.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Thank you, but I'm not Walt.  I'm
                        Johnny Smith.

                                        PAM
                        Johnny Smith?  Didn't Sarah used
                        to bring you 'round in college?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah, but you never talked to me.

                        Right.

                        Because I'm already married.  To

          Pam gives Sarah a look.

                                        SARAH
                        Not that -- I mean, I wasn't
                        married to Walt when J.J. was
                        conceived.  I was engaged.

                                        JOHNNY
                        To me.

                        you.

          Pam gives them a smile and eases away, surely off to find
          someone she can tell about this fascinating bit of gossip. 
          Sarah and Johnny watch her go.

                                        JOHNNY
                        New Yorkers are so judgmental.

                          Whatever.  I hate her anyway.

                        You don't need an escort anymore.

                        after all, so I'm kind of a third
                        wheel.  Think I'll head home.

                        But this is fantastic!  Pam's
                        date had to jet off to Tokyo and

1313A VISION - INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

          Festive dinner with Maria, Alec, Walt and Sarah.  They
          clink glasses.

                                        WALT
                        Happy Anniversary.

          Sarah takes out a GIFT, slides it over to them.

                                        SARAH
                        Little something to mark the
                          occasion.

          Maria opens it up.  It's a LEATHER PHOTO ALBUM.

                                        MARIA
                        Oh, you guys... It's beautiful. 
                        Thank you --

          But her face suddenly falls as she looks up to see an
          angry, drunken, JOHNNY appear at their table.

                        Just go.

                        You're all so happy.

          He takes a step closer.  Walt stands, moves towards him.

                                        WALT
                        You heard them.  You're not

                          quietly, okay?

          Walt starts to usher Johnny out, but Johnny shoulders him
          off, moves back to the table, stands threateningly in
          front of Alec, Maria and Sarah.

                                        JOHNNY

          ON SARAH, at a loss, eyes locked on Johnny.  Then her
          gaze travels to Maria, and we realize that Johnny was
          talking to her.  As Johnny takes a step closer,

          Walt lunges for him, and Johnny sees a FLASH of his
          REFLECTION in the window of the restaurant.  As he looks
          down, suddenly realizes he only has ONE ARM...

          Johnny looks at her, at his hand -- intact -- tries to
          shake off his vision.  He's not going anywhere.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'd love to.

          She starts to back away, smiling.

                        Pam will be so happy.

          Walt and Sarah move in, know that look in Johnny's eye.

                        You... at least I thought I was. 
                        But it was Maria.

                        Why would you be angry at Maria?

                        I have no idea.  But get this, I
                        only have one arm.

          As they look at him, perplexed, Johnny's eye is caught by
          something, a FRAMED PHOTO on Maria's mantel: Maria in the
          middle of two men, their arms around each other.  Alec on
          one side, and another MAN, smiling into the camera whom
          Maria beams at, eyes full of love, her head resting on
          his shoulder.  Johnny  stares at the PHOTO, remembers
            something --

                                        JOHNNY
                        Wait.

          As Walt lunges for Johnny, Johnny catches his own
          REFLECTION in the window of the restaurant -- only this
          time it's not just a flash: this time we see it more
          clearly, and the REFLECTION isn't of Johnny, it's the GUY
          IN THE PHOTO.

          Sarah and Walt exchange a look.

                                        SARAH
                        That's Bryan Hampton.  Maria was
                        engaged to him. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's him.  He's the one who's
                          stalking Maria and Alec, not me. 
                        But it's weird, it doesn't usually

  1515EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

          Walt and Johnny follow Sarah as she leads them to Bryan's
          gravesite, filling them in on what she knows.

                                        SARAH
                        Maria, Alec and Bryan were all
                          friends, doctors at the hospital
                        here.  When that terrible
                        earthquake hit Uzbekistan in 2001,
                        they volunteered to help Doctors
                        for Peace.

                                        WALT
                                (nods)
                          I didn't really know them back
                        then, but what I heard was it was
                          supposed to be a two-week trip
                        just to do triage.  Only it turned
                        out to be in a very dangerous
                        region.  The village where they
                        were posted was attacked by rebels. 
                        Maria and Alec survived.

                                        SARAH
                        Bryan didn't.

                                        WALT
                        He was murdered by the rebels.

                                        SARAH
                        Maria was devastated... and about
                        a year later, Alec's wife died
                          suddenly.  Breast cancer.  They
                        gave each other comfort... which
                        eventually turned into love.

                                        WALT
                                (re: grave)
                        This is it...

                                        SARAH
                        It was a small funeral.  All they
                        had to bury were a few personal
                          effects.

          ON GRAVE MARKER, name and date etched in marble: Bryan
          Taylor Hampton, 1970 - 2001. 

          FRESH FLOWERS have been placed at the grave.  Johnny leans
          down to touch them, triggering:          DEAD ZONE: SPEAK NOW - ACT TWO - 3/30/04 - YELLOW     19.

1717A VISION - INT./EXT. UZBEKISTAN - OIL REFINERY

          Johnny watches as Maria, Alec and Bryan are operating on
          a CHILD in a semi-destroyed building.  Suddenly they hear
          shouts and then shooting as through a break in the wall
          they see battered Toyota pickup trucks full of GUERILLA
          SOLDIERS roll into the village.


  1818EXT. UZBEKISTAN - OIL REFINERY - DAY

          Maria, Alec and Bryan are dragged out of the building by
          the guerrillas.

                                        MARIA
                        No!  No!  We are doctors!  Here
                        to help!

          Maria and Alec are dragged off in one direction, another
          guerilla jabs a gun into Bryan's back and motions him to
          go in the opposite direction.

                                        MARIA
                                (voice shaking)
                        Bry...

          Bryan turns and yells over his shoulder.

                                        BRYAN
                        Alec, get her out of here!

          The Guerrilla kicks Bryan, drags him into a burned out
          structure.

                                        MARIA
                        No, Bryan!  Bryan!

          We hear SHOTS.  Johnny flinches.

                                        MARIA
                          Noooooo!

                        his personal effects?

          Sarah nods 'yes.'  Johnny puts his hand on the ground in
          front of the grave marker where Bryan's effects are buried,

  2121INT. UZBEKISTAN - MAKESHIFT HOSPITAL - PRESENT DAY

          A bombed out structure with minimal medical equipment.

          Johnny watches as Bryan, now heavily bearded and quite
          weary, is working like a dog, patching up a REBEL SOLDIER,
          a second REBEL standing guard by Bryan's side with a gun. 
          Bryan stops, drops his suturing tool, winces in pain,
          clutches his right arm, blood soaking through his dirty,
          tattered shirt.

                                        BRYAN
                                (in Russian)
                        I need medicine for my arm.
                                (in English)
                        I can't keep operating without
                        it.

          Bryan grabs a clean rag, tries to tie a tourniquet around
          his wounded arm.

                                        REBEL
                                (in English)
                        No more supplies.  Namangan is
                          surrounded.  Keep working.  Save
                        him or you die.

          The Rebel pokes an exhausted Bryan, who goes back to his
            suturing.

                        That's just it, Sarah.  He wasn't
                        killed that day.  The rebels faked
                        his death.  My vision was in the

                        rebels, forced to patch up their
                          wounded.  He's hurt... his right
                        arm -- looks like a nasty wound.

                        In your vision of the future, he
                        was missing an arm.

          Johnny, Walt and Sarah exchange a look.

                        We gotta get him out.  Now.  One
                        of the rebels said they were
                          surrounded.  Some place called
                        Nam... Nam... Namangan.  That's

                        Peace who can help.

          Walt's off.  Johnny, pumped, starts after him.

                        To tell Maria that the love of
                        her life is alive.  When's the
                        last time one of my visions gave

  2323INT. MARIA'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

            Rehearsal dinner's over -- the bridal party moving to the
          hotel room to prep for tomorrow.  A few people are saying
          goodbye, helping Maria clean up.  Maria's wrapping little
          bags of rice and tying them with ribbon as Sarah, followed
          by Johnny, walks in.

                                        SARAH
                        Maria, you can't marry Alec.

          Heads turn.  Maria looks at her.  So does Johnny.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I would've broken the news a little
                        more delicately --

                        Night before your wedding, the
                        groom leaves you alone to do all
                        the work.  That's not supposed to
                        happen 'til after you say "I do."

          Everyone laughs, and continue to exit, ad-libbing off

                                (smiles)
                        Alec wanted to help, but somebody
                        had to drive Aunt Esther home. 
                        She loves to talk about her
                          irritable bowel syndrome.  Trust
                        me, I got the better deal.
                                (then noticing)
                          ...uh-oh, almost out of ribbon.

          Sarah, looking for an excuse to leave Maria alone with
          Johnny volunteers...

                                        SARAH
                        I'll get it.

                                        MARIA
                        Thanks, it's somewhere in all
                        that mess on the bed.

                                        SARAH
                        Tomorrow's your big day. 
                                (pointed, at Johnny)
                        I don't want anything to spoil
                        it.

          Sarah exits to the bedroom.  Johnny, seeing they're alone,
          sensing his opportunity, sits down with Maria to help.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Here let me give you a hand with
                        those.

                                        MARIA
                        Thank you... there's so much to
                        do.

          Johnny uses the last of the ribbon to tie up the little
          bags of rice.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I hope you don't think I'm being
                        too forward.  Sarah told me that
                        you went through a tough time a
                        few years back...

          Maria nods.  It's still difficult for her to talk about.

                        That must have been hard for you.

                                        MARIA
                        It was.  It took a long time to
                        accept.  Even now sometimes I
                        feel guilty, being this happy
                        when he's gone... His name was
                        Bryan.  You probably don't know
                        this, but he knew you.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Me?

                                        MARIA
                        At Eastern Maine.  That's where
                        he did his residency.  You were a
                        patient on his neurology rounds.

          Johnny's weirded out by this -- but it also makes sense. 
          Maybe explains his connection to Bryan.

                                        MARIA
                        I was a surgical resident.  I
                        used to see Sarah there every day
                          visiting you. 

          Maria puts the last of the rice bags down, turns to Johnny.

                                        MARIA
                        Now she's married to Walt.

                                        JOHNNY
                        And you're about to marry Alec.

                                        MARIA
                          Strange, the turns life takes...

          Johnny takes another little bag of rice from Maria,
          triggering --

                        Maria, Bryan's alive.

          On Maria's SHOCK, SPEED UP INTO --


2626A VISION - INT. MARIA'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - NIGHT

            Vision-Johnny follows Maria as she rushes in to see one-
          armed Bryan, lying face down on the bed, an EMPTY PILL
          BOTTLE beside him.  She runs to him, turns him over,
          quickly checks his pulse.  Nothing. 

                                        MARIA
                          Nooooooo!

          Maria, shaking, looks over, sees a LETTER on the
          nightstand.  She picks it up, scans Bryan's handwritten
          words, one sentence jumping out at her:

                        "You should never have waited for
                        me..."

          She drops the letter.  ON JOHNNY, reacting to the terrible
          scene before him --

          Johnny looks at Maria, rattled, covering.

                                        JOHNNY
                        No, life doesn't always work out
                        the way you think it will.


  2828INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - LATER

          Johnny's filled Sarah in as they head out.

                                        SARAH
                                (relieved, covering)
                        So you didn't tell her.

          Johnny shakes his head.

                                        JOHNNY
                        How could I?  I saw that if I do,
                        she's going to call off the wedding
                        and wait for Bryan.  But she's
                        going to end up with a guy who's
                        too messed up to be with her, and
                        it's going to ruin her life. 

                                        SARAH
                        Maria's already gone through so
                        much... So has Alec.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I keep thinking about the vision
                        I had of Bryan stalking them.  It
                        was an anniversary celebration. 
                        You gave Maria and Alec a leather
                        photo album.

                                        SARAH
                        Must've been their third
                          anniversary.  Leather's what you
                        give to mark it.  Your vision was
                        of the future, and Bryan headed
                        down a very dark path.

          They hold a look, each thinking the same thing:

                        Unless we can change it.


  2929EXT. HOTEL (CHEAT) - NEXT MORNING

          Johnny, Walt, Sarah.

                                        WALT
                        My contact at Doctors for Peace
                        says the State Department's looking
                        into it.  They've had some dealings
                        with the Uzbeki rebel faction in
                        the area where you saw Bryan.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe if we get Bryan home sooner,
                        he won't be so damaged.  Maybe
                        Maria should wait for him.

                                        SARAH
                        She hasn't seen him in three years. 
                        We can't predict how she's going
                        to feel...

                                        JOHNNY
                        So we're agreed?  Until we know
                        more, this stays between the three
                        of us.  Last thing we need is a
                        leak to the wedding rumor mill.

          As if on cue, Pam swans in --

                                        PAM
                        There's my escort.  I am so looking
                        forward to our getting better
                          acquainted, Johnny Smith.
                                  (suggestive)
                          I already know you make adorable
                          children.

          Sarah suppresses the urge to gag.  Pam winks at Johnny
          and waltzes off.  Walt's cells rings.  He picks it up.

                                        WALT
                        Bannerman.

                        But we gave you a location.  Did
                        you tell them he needs urgent
                        medical attention --
                                  (frustrated)
                        You do that.

          He hangs up, looks at Sarah and Johnny.

                                        WALT
                        Until they have more information,
                        the State Department won't approve
                        any action.

                                        JOHNNY
                        We don't have that luxury.

                                        WALT
                        The guy I talked to gave it to me
                          straight.  Even if they find him
                        it could take months to get Bryan
                        out.

                                        JOHNNY
                        And we know what that'll do to
                        Bryan if it does.  I'm not gonna
                        let that happen.


  3030INT. HOTEL - LOBBY - MORNING

          Johnny's waiting for Purdy to finish up a call to the
          Uzbekistan Ambassador.

                                        PURDY
                                (into phone)
                          I understand... please thank the
                        Ambassador for me.  Yes.  Yes. 
                        Thank you.

          He hangs up.

                                        PURDY
                        It wasn't easy, but the ambassador
                        has been apprised of the situation. 
                        With the information you provided,
                        he'll do everything he can to
                        confirm Bryan's whereabouts. 
                        That area is controlled by warlords
                        and bandits.  If they move too
                        soon, it could jeopardize Bryan's
                        life.

                          I understand that.

          Awkward beat.

                                        PURDY
                        Look, Johnny, I realize how time-
                          sensitive the situation is, and
                        I'm pushing as hard as I can. 
                        When the State Department gets
                          confirmation, they'll assemble a
                        rescue team.

                                        JOHNNY
                        How soon do you think that'll be?

                        If you mean will we know something
                        conclusive before the wedding...
                        I doubt it.

                                        JOHNNY
                        How can you stand there and marry
                        them, knowing what you do?

                        life isn't going to bring Bryan
                        home any more quickly.

                        But Maria has the right to know
                        he's alive.

                        And what about Alec?  He's suffered
                        so much already.  Losing his wife
                        to breast cancer, leaving him
                        with a young daughter to raise
                        alone.  That child needs a mother. 
                        Maria has been the answer to their
                          prayers.  Have you thought about
                        the impact this will have on them?

                        look at that couple, you see two
                        other people you don't believe
                        were meant to be together.

                        years: Sarah and Walt.  Don't you
                        see, Johnny?  The first vision
                        you had, the one that set this
                        whole thing in motion -- seeing
                          yourself object -- fulfilled a

                        love story turn out the way yours
                        and Sarah's didn't.

                        Let's just get Bryan home.  Then
                        we'll all have a chance to see
                        how this story turns out.  For

  3131INT. HOTEL - BRIDAL SUITE - DAY

          Sarah approaches Maria, who looks very bridal in a white
          silk robe, hair done up, looking out the window,
            thoughtfully toying with her NECKLACE, her wedding dress
          hanging up in the b.g. behind her.  Sarah doesn't want to
          disturb her, but something tells her this is the time to
          bring up the subject of Bryan, since chances are he isn't
          far from Maria's mind.

                                        SARAH
                        You look beautiful.

          Maria turns, sighs with relief at seeing her friend.

                                        MARIA
                          Thanks... All this wedding
                          nonsense... Alec and I wanted to
                        elope, just run off and get married
                        under an oak tree somewhere.  But
                        my mom insisted...  She kept
                        saying, you only get married once.

          Maria smiles wanly, clearly thinking about her first
          engagement.

                                        SARAH
                        In a couple of hours the wedding
                        will be over, and you and Alec
                        can just concentrate on being
                        husband and wife.

          Maria nods again, but her eyes fill with tears, belying
          her confidence.

                                        MARIA
                        Sorry.  I'm a little emotional.

                                        SARAH
                          Weddings bring up a lot of stuff. 
                        The past.

          Maria nods.  Sarah's hit a nerve.

                                        SARAH
                        Maria, you know my situation. 
                        How Walt and I met.

                        At the hospital, when you were
                          visiting Johnny.

                                        SARAH
                        His doctors told me Johnny would
                        never wake up.  I was pregnant
                        with J.J. and so scared...  I
                        felt like my life was over.

          Maria nods, empathizing.

                                        SARAH
                        But Walt was there for me when I
                        really needed someone.  I fell in
                        love with him.  And I married
                        him.

                                        MARIA
                        And it was the right thing to do. 
                        You're happy, Sarah, aren't you?

                                        SARAH
                        Yes, of course I am.

          Sarah looks away.  Confession time.

                                        SARAH
                        But sometimes, I wish I had waited
                          a little longer.  Maybe for me,
                        it all happened too fast.
                                (then)
                        When Johnny did wake up, I felt
                        like I'd never really dealt with
                        any of it.

          Maria nods.  Understands what Sarah is trying to say. 
          Only --

                                        MARIA
                        But Bryan isn't coming back.  I
                        know that.  I've accepted it. 
                        And I love Alec.  So much...

                                        SARAH
                        But you still love Bryan, too.

                                        MARIA
                        He'll always be my first love. 
                        Look...

          She shows Sarah the locket.  Opens it to reveal --

                        Bryan gave me this, the night we
                        got engaged.  I wear it all the
                        time.  It helps me feel closer to
                        him.

                        was coming back...

                        Made me appreciate what I had
                        that was right in front of me.

                        That's my wish for you. 

          They hug.  Off Sarah, more unsure than ever about what to

  3232INT. HOTEL - SARAH'S DRESSING ROOM - AFTERNOON

          Sarah's in the middle of getting dressed for the wedding. 
          Johnny has interrupted her.

                        No matter what Purdy says, she
                          deserves to know the love of her
                        life is still out there, Sarah.

                        Look, I know Bryan and Maria were
                          engaged, they were planning to
                        have a life together --

                        Full of big plans, hopes and dreams
                        they never got the chance to live.

                                        SARAH
                        But right now Maria is in love
                        with Alec.  She's a mother to his
                          daughter.  They bought a house. 
                        Johnny, they want children of
                        their own --

                        And what, Bryan being alive might
                        mess up their suburban plans?
                                (off Sarah looking
                                  stung)
                        Maria told me something the other
                          night... she said Bryan knew me,
                        when I was in the coma.

          Sarah nods, uncomfortable -- she knows this, didn't want
          to talk about it.

                        And you think that's why you feel
                        such a connection with him?

                        I don't know... maybe that's why
                        I had the visions.  He's not here
                        to speak for himself --

                        So you have to speak for him?  No
                        one can do that.  We have no way
                        of knowing what Maria or Alec
                        will do with this information...
                        or even what Bryan would want.

          Johnny starts to speak, she stops him.

                        I'm just saying, we don't have to
                        tell them before the ceremony. 
                        We could let them get married --

          They hold a look.  Then Sarah's gaze wanders to the window,
          thinking back to another time.

                                        SARAH
                        You know, when J.J. was a newborn
                        he had horrible colic.  Do you
                        have any idea what that is?

                        Kid screams a lot.  No reason.

                        Walt was up nights, walking the
                        floor, trying to soothe him.  He
                        used to do this thing -- called
                        the window washer.  It was the
                        only thing that worked.  For twenty
                          minutes, then it would start again. 
                        The screaming wore me out, but
                        Walt never flinched.  When J.J.
                        was two, his doctor thought he
                        might have some hearing loss...

                        someone could have told you I was
                        going to wake up, you would have
                        wanted them to keep it to
                          themselves?

                                        SARAH
                        This isn't about me.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The hell it isn't.  You keep saying
                        you know how she feels, what she's
                        going through.

                                        SARAH
                        I do!

                                        JOHNNY
                        Then answer the question.  If
                        someone had come up to you at
                        your wedding and told you
                        positively I would wake up in six
                        years, what would you have done?

                                        SARAH
                                (upset)
                        Johnny --

                                        JOHNNY
                        Just answer it, Sarah: would you
                        have waited for me?

                                        SARAH
                        How can you ask me that?

          She storms out.  Johnny turns to see WALT, standing in
          the doorway.  An awkward beat, then --

                                        WALT
                        Well, no one asked me, but if I
                        were Alec?  I'd sure as hell want
                        to know everything.

  3333INT. HOTEL - BANQUET ROOM - BAR (WEDDING #1) - AFTERNOON

          It's the cocktail hour before the wedding, GUESTS are in
          black tie, and Johnny, also in a tux, uneasy off his
            conversation with Sarah, sidles up to the bar, eats peanuts
            distractedly.  Bruce joins him.

                                        BRUCE
                        Got a live one for you.  Met this
                        very cool chick in the elevator --
                        Nicole.  Bomb-dot-com.

          A DROP-DEAD GORGEOUS woman, NICOLE, in a turquoise halter
          dress, sits across from them at the bar.

                                        BRUCE
                        Speak of the devil...

          Johnny turns to look.

                                        JOHNNY
                        In a blue dress.

                                        BRUCE
                        Johnny be good.  Look, man, I
                        know this wedding's stressing you
                        out --

                                        JOHNNY
                        You have no idea.

                                        BRUCE
                        Well, I'd like to hear more about
                        it, but right now, Miss May Be
                        Right could be over there hooking
                        up with Mr. Wrong.  You told me
                        my wife was here, so go find out
                        for me.  Is she the one? 

          Johnny moves closer to NICOLE who's talking to a GROOMSMAN. 
          She reaches into the bowl of nuts on the bar.  As soon as
          she pulls her hand out, Johnny reaches his in, touches a
          PEANUT, triggering --

          JOHNNY watches as Bruce and Nicole kiss, sitting on the
          edge of the bed.  Bruce whispers something in her ear, a
          private joke of some kind, and she gets a case of the
          giggles, laughing -- it's easy and fun between them --
          and as the laughter dies down, she gazes into his eyes,
          and he gazes back.  They're in love.

          JOHNNY watches Bruce, who's down on one knee, with an

                        it be?  Do I lose an eye?  I mean,
                        look at her, John.  She is so...
                        worth it.  I could wear a patch --
                        for her.

          Johnny shoots him a look.

                                        BRUCE
                        All right.  But see what I'm
                        saying?  The system works, man. 
                        You're saving me all kinds of
                          trouble.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Let me ask you something, Bruce. 
                        You think I'm still... you think
                        I'm over Sarah?

                                        BRUCE
                          I warned you, weddings bring up 
                        stuff we'd rather let lie.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Is that a yes or no?

                                        BRUCE
                        If you're not over her, you oughtta
                        be.  That story's getting old,
                        man.  Sarah was your girl once,
                        but she chose another guy.  Twice. 
                        You need to move on.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's the thing.  I have.

                                        BRUCE
                        You mean Rebecca?  Man she doesn't
                        even live in the same state. 

          They hold a look.

                                        BRUCE
                        Let's face it.  Your love life's
                        like the I-95 in rush hour.  Stuck
                        in one place.  You say you're
                        over Sarah?  Prove it.

          Johnny, ear to his phone, turns to see Sarah standing in

          up.

                                        SARAH
                        This is the locket that Bryan
                        gave to Maria when they got
                          engaged.

                        Sounds like a girl who's not quite

                        Did a little cat burgling, huh?

                        do.

          Johnny nods, makes sense.  He holds out his hand for the
            necklace.


          CLOSE ON THE LOCKET

4343A VISION - INT. COMA WARD - 1996

            A distraught Sarah, nine months pregnant, is at Johnny's
          bedside, holding his hand as he lays in a coma.

                                        SARAH
                          Whenever I felt like this... lost,
                        you were always there.  You were
                        the one I went to to help me figure
                        it  out.  I need you to tell me
                        what to do, Johnny.  I want to
                        believe there's still a chance
                        for us.  But I don't know how
                        much longer to wait... Our baby's
                        coming, and I'm so scared.  I
                        don't want him to grow up without
                          a father...
                                (crying)
                        He's a good man.  He loves me,
                        and I know he'll love our son. 
                        I'm not strong enough to do this. 
                        I came here to ask you to make
                        the decision for us.  I need you
                        to let me go, Johnny...

          She turns to see Bryan, in a white lab coat, standing in
          the doorway.

                                        BRYAN
                        He already has, Sarah.

          He moves forward gingerly not wanting to interrupt this
          intimate moment, picks up Johnny's chart.

                                        BRYAN
                        I've followed Johnny's prognosis
                        ever since he was brought in.  As
                        doctors we're trained to heal,

                                        BRYAN (CONT'D)
                        But everything we know about
                        medical science tells us this is
                        as good as it's gonna get.  As
                        painful as that is, I think it's
                        time you accepted it, too. 
                          Johnny's never going to wake up.

          ON JOHNNY, behind them, HIS EYES BLINK, but Bryan and
          Sarah don't see it.

          Reveal Vision-Johnny in the room, shocked to see himself
          blink.  He wants to shout to Sarah and Bryan "hey, look!" 
          But he can't.

                                        BRYAN
                        You asked Johnny to let you go. 
                        You have to let him go, now.  You
                        deserve a chance for a happier
                        life.  So does your baby.  Johnny
                        would want that for both of you.

          Sarah stands, leans over Johnny and kisses him gently on
          the lips.  ON Vision-Johnny, leaning in close, watching
          her kiss his comatose body, wanting desperately to kiss
          her back, wanting to feel what that's like, just one more
          time.

          ON Sarah, tears streaming down her face.  She lets go of
          Johnny's limp hand, turns and rushes out.  Bryan moves to
          Johnny, looks down at him, eyes full of sympathy.

                                        BRYAN
                        I feel for you, friend.  You don't
                        deserve this.  Nobody does.

          On Vision-Johnny's reaction, --


  4444RESUME - INT. HOTEL BANQUET ROOM - BAR (WEDDING #1) -
            AFTERNOON

          Johnny closes his fist around the locket, looks at Sarah's
            expectant face.

                                        SARAH
                        Did you see Bryan?

          Johnny's clearly rattled by this vision of them from the
          past.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Bryan was there, at the hospital. 
                        With you... and me.

                                        SARAH
                        What do you mean?

                                        JOHNNY
                        The day you made your decision... 

          It hits Sarah hard.  The hardest decision she ever made. 
          The day she feels most guilty about.

          From O.S. a HARPIST begins to play Bach as Alec's best
          man steps forward.

                                        BEST MAN
                        Ladies and gentlemen, please take
                        your seats.

          As the guests all file into the hotel BANQUET ROOM, ON
          Johnny and Sarah exchanging a long look.

          Music plays as Maria stands in her gown, holding Brianna's
          hand, ready to walk down the aisle.  Sarah comes up behind
          her and quickly fastens the locket around her neck.

                                        SARAH
                          Something old...

          Maria, grateful, kisses Sarah's cheek.


  4646INT. HOTEL - WEDDING #1 ROOM - AFTERNOON

          The wedding is in progress.  Playing out the same way it
          did before, only this time Johnny, Walt and Sarah all
          look nervous and unhappy, instead of just Johnny.

                                        PURDY
                        ...Into this holy estate these
                        two persons present come now to
                        be joined.

                                        BRIANNA
                                (piping up)
                        Three.

                                        PURDY
                        Excuse me?

                                        MARIA
                                (gently correcting)
                        Three persons.

                                        PURDY
                        Of course, dear girl, forgive me. 
                        Into this holy estate these three
                        persons present come now to be
                        joined.  If any one can show just
                        cause, why they may not lawfully
                        be joined together, let him speak
                        now, or forever hold his peace.

          Once again, Alec and Maria smile.  Purdy looks to Johnny. 
          Walt looks to Johnny -- Well?  Johnny looks to Sarah,
          unsure.  Johnny and Sarah's eyes meet.  Three decades of
          history between them.  All the mistakes and the wrong
          turns. 


          JOHNNY'S FINGERS

          dance on his cane top, ready to take hold and vault him
          to his feet, as Reverend Purdy turns to Alec.

                                        PURDY
                        Alec, do you take --

                                        SARAH
                          I object.

          She couldn't have said it more quietly, or with less
          conviction, but even so EVERYONE turns to look at Sarah. 
          Johnny and Walt react.  So does Purdy.

                                        PURDY
                        Pardon me?

                                        SARAH
                                (wishing she were
                                dead)
                        I said, I object.
                                  (whispered, to Maria)
                        I need to talk to you.

                                        MARIA
                        This is kind of a bad time, Sarah. 
                        Maybe it could wait?

                                        SARAH
                                (shakes her head)
                        It's about Bryan.  He's alive.

          Off this quiet bombshell, we go to --          DEAD ZONE: SPEAK NOW - ACT THREE - 3/25/04 - PINK     45.


  4747INT. HOTEL - ANTEROOM (WEDDING #1) - LATER

          A small room off the BANQUET ROOM.  Gathered together
          here are Johnny, Sarah, Walt, Maria and Alec.  Johnny has
            explained everything and we're in the middle of the
          fallout.

                                        MARIA
                        How long have you known?

                                        SARAH
                        Since last night.

                                        MARIA
                        And you couldn't find a better
                        time to tell me than in the middle
                        of the wedding? 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Believe me, we talked about when
                        and how we should tell you.  We've
                        argued about it for the last twenty-
                        four hours. 

                                        SARAH
                        Maria, ten years ago, I was in
                        your place.  I was in love with
                        two men.  And I believed one of
                        them was gone forever.
                              (a look to Johnny)
                        But he wasn't.  And the more I
                        thought about it, the more I
                        knew...  I would have wanted to
                        know the truth.

                                        ALEC
                        The government told us he was
                        dead --

                                        WALT
                        They were wrong.  He's been a
                          hostage.

                                        MARIA
                        Oh my god... Bryan...

                                        ALEC
                        Is he hurt?

                                        JOHNNY
                        He's going to get the medical
                          attention he needs.  As soon as
                        he's rescued.

                        The State Department's looking
                        into it, trying to pinpoint his
                          location. 

                                        ALEC
                        You don't even know if it's true?

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's true.  I saw him.  Bryan's
                        alive.

                                        WALT
                        Alec, I've worked with Johnny on
                        a lot of cases.  I've never known
                        him to be wrong.

                                        ALEC
                                (sarcasm)
                        Well then, what are we waiting
                        for?  Pop open the champagne!

                        They don't even know where he is -- 

                                        MARIA
                        But --

                                        ALEC
                        Honey, we can't get our hopes up. 

                                        MARIA
                        I know, but...
                                  (realizing)
                        What are we supposed to do now? 
                        Do we wait, do we go through with
                        the wedding...?

          The question of the hour.  Johnny, Sarah and Walt all
          share a look.  Then --

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's up to you.

          Before Maria can answer there's a KNOCK AT THE DOOR, and
          Purdy enters with Brianna.  Brianna immediately runs to
          her father's arms.  He picks her up.

                        right.

                        I know this is a lot to take in,

                        why we're here today?

          Johnny, Walt and Sarah all exchange looks.  Here's the
          terrible situation they wanted to avoid, playing out in
          front of them.

                                (then)
                        Alec?

          Alec sets Brianna down and moves to Maria. 

                                        ALEC
                        I love you, and I want to marry
                        you.  Today.  Right now.
                                (then)
                        But I'll understand if you want
                        to wait.

                        What about Bryan...?

                                        ALEC
                        We'll bring him home. 
                                (looks away)
                        And you'll have some big decisions
                        to make.

          Maria fingers her locket.  Alec notices.

                        I'm not gonna lie, it'd break my
                        heart if we weren't together.

                                        ALEC (CONT'D)
                        But whatever you decide, I'll
                        support you.

          Maria touches his face, so in love with this wonderful
          man.  Brianna tugs on Maria's gown.

                                        BRIANNA
                        I don't wanna wait.  I wanna get
                          married.

          Brianna begins to cry.  Alec picks her up to comfort her.

                                        ALEC
                        It's okay, baby.

          Maria looks at Alec and Brianna, the pain they're both
          in.

                                        MARIA
                        We're getting married.  Today.

                                        SARAH
                        Maria, are you sure?

                                        MARIA
                        I'm sure.  I can't stand this. 
                        It's too much.
                                (to Alec)
                        And I love you.  That won't change.

                                (to Purdy)
                        You heard her.

                        Let's try this again.


  4848INT. HOTEL - WEDDING #1 ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

          Everyone is gathered, but this time no one is smiling. 
          It's a far more somber affair than before.  Brianna looks
          around, confused at the change in mood. 

                                        PURDY
                        Dearly beloved, we are gathered
                          together here in the sight of
                        God, and in the face of this
                          company, to join together this
                        Man and this Woman in holy
                        Matrimony.

          The guests fidget in their seats.

          The bridesmaids and groomsmen shift on their feet,
            uncomfortable.  Sarah looks to Walt in the audience.

                                        PURDY
                        Which is an honorable estate, and
                          therefore is not by any to be
                        entered into unadvisedly or
                          lightly; but reverently,
                          discreetly, advisedly, soberly,
                        and in the fear of God.


          AT THE VESTIBULE

          Johnny stands, listening to the proceedings but out of
          the bride and groom's line of sight.  He has his coat on,
          ready to go.

                                        PURDY
                        Into this holy estate these two
                        persons present come now to be
                        joined.

          Maria and Alec's eyes meet.  This isn't the way they should
          do this.  Both of them know it.

                                        PURDY
                        If any one can show just cause,
                        why they may not lawfully be joined
                          together, let him speak now, or
                        forever hold his peace.

          A long moment.  Longer than it should be.  And then -

                                        ALEC
                        Maria, I don't think --

                                        MARIA
                        Alec, please don't --

                                        ALEC
                        I'm sorry.  We both know this
                        isn't right.

          Alec takes Brianna's hand.

                                        BRIANNA
                                (says what the adults
                                are afraid to say)
                        Now what?

          Maria looks from Brianna to Alec, then turns and RUNS
          DOWN THE AISLE and out of the room.

          Passes Johnny, not even seeing him, and she's out the
          front door and gone as the guests just watch in
            stupefaction.  Walt and Sarah appear next to Johnny and... 
          Off their three faces, emotions mixed --

    4949INT./EXT. MARIA'S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR/LIVING ROOM - LATER

          There's a knock at the door.  Maria, still in her wedding
          dress, opens it to find --

          JOHNNY

          She's angry, distraught.

                                        MARIA
                        What the hell you were thinking? 
                        Do you have any idea what you've
                        done?  Turning our lives upside
                        down like this? 

          He follows Maria into the house, sees she's hauled out a
          box of Bryan's things.  Newspaper articles, some clothes,
          letter announcing his death.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What's this?

                                        MARIA
                        All I had left of Bryan.

          Johnny's phone rings.  He picks it up.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (into phone)
                        Hello?  Yes, I'm with her now.

                        As soon as I hang up.  Thanks,
                        Gene.

          He flips his phone shut, looks at Maria.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Reverend Purdy just got a call
                        from the State Department. 
                          There've been rumors about an
                          American doctor working for the
                        rebels against his will.  Until
                        now, the government thought they
                        were just that.  Rumors.  They're
                        sending in a rescue team as we
                        speak.

          Johnny moves to the box, takes out a letter from the State
            Department...

          Clipped to the letter is Bryan's burned and blood-stained
          I.D. placard, like you hand around your neck for "Doctors
          for Peace," which triggers --


5050A VISION: EXT. UZBEKISTAN - POWER PLANT - DAY

          Johnny watches as Bryan, on the ground, in worn and blood-
          stained medical scrubs, runs from the GUERRILLAS.  He is
          surrounded by U.S. SOLDIERS, guns drawn, who create a
          shield around him.  The REBELS scatter as the SOLDIERS
          shoot in their direction, pulling Bryan towards a waiting
          Humvee.  Just as they're about to board, there's a scuffle,
          A REBEL comes straight at them, gun held high, takes aim
          at Bryan.  As the Rebel's about to shoot, he's knocked
          back by the force of the Rescuers' bullets taking him
          out.

          The soldiers jump into the moving vehicle, reach for Bryan. 
          One of them grabs his right hand.  But his arm's badly
          wounded, and the searing pain makes him let go.  Still
          under fire, they start to drive off, Bryan's in danger of
          being left behind when suddenly he reaches out his other
          hand, his good arm, and --

            A soldier grabs it, pulling him to safety.  As Bryan falls
          into the Humvee, REVEAL Johnny sitting on the seat next
          to him.

                                                                                BACK TO:

          The reality of it finally hits Maria.  She sinks to the
          couch, overwhelmed.

                                        MARIA
                        I can't even imagine...
                                (to Johnny)
                        You were right.  I just wouldn't
                        let myself believe it could be
                        true.  My god... Bryan's alive.

                        And like Alec said, now you've
                        got some big decisions to make.

                        I wish I knew what to do.  No

                        hurting someone I love.
                                (to Johnny)

                        It doesn't work like that.

          He sits down beside her.

                          Besides, you've already made your
                          decision.  Even though you may
                        not realize it yet.  Your future
                        is out there, waiting for you.

          Maria holds out her hand, engagement ring prominent.

                                        MARIA
                        Then tell me what you see.  Please.

          Johnny starts to take her hand, then hesitates, thinks
          better of it.

                                        MARIA
                        I need you to tell me... what I
                        should do.

                        You don't need me to tell you,
                        Maria.  Just follow your heart.

          Off Johnny, knowing how he hopes this will end.


  5353INT. CHURCH (WEDDING #2) - DAY (FORMERLY EXT. HOTEL)

          Maria, in a more simple wedding dress than before, and
          Bryan, looking more like his old self -- clean-shaven and
            healthier -- in a nice suit, stand next to each other,
          GUESTS assembled.  After a long shared look, Bryan walks
          her forward to where Purdy stands.  Then he --

          Brianna between them, beaming.  Walt, Sarah, Bruce --
          they're all there.  Not a dry eye in the house.  Bryan
          crosses in, stands next to Johnny, who acknowledges him
          with a sympathetic nod.

                          traditional vows, would like to
                        speak from her heart.

                        Alec, we've traveled many miles --
                          together, and separately -- to
                        get here.  The road's had many
                        twists and turns, sometimes it
                        even felt like d j  vu ...

          They and the audience smile.

                        But here we are, standing side by
                        side.  I'm ready to start our
                        life together, as a wife...

                        ...and a mother.  And although
                        it's taken a long time to get
                        here, it was worth the journey,
                        because I'm finally exactly where
                        I want to be.  At home.

          On Maria and Alec -- this is their happily ever after.

                                                                    TIME DISSOLVE TO:          DEAD ZONE: SPEAK NOW - ACT FOUR - 3/25/04 - PINK      54.

  5555INT. RESTAURANT - WEDDING #2 RECEPTION - NIGHT

          CLOSE ON the wedding BOUQUET flying through the air.  It
          sails right over the heads of the BRIDESMAIDS and SINGLE
          FEMALE GUESTS and conks a surprised Bruce on the head. 
          He looks at Johnny, eyebrows raised.  The WEDDING BAND
          plays a romantic slow dance and Bryan -- the other fifth
          wheel -- finds Johnny.

                                        JOHNNY
                        God I hate this song.

                                        BRYAN
                        Me, too.  Although it could be
                        worse.  I had "You Light Up My
                        Life" stuck in my head for three
                        years.

                                        JOHNNY
                        If that had been stuck in my head
                        for the whole six years of my
                        coma --

          They both shudder.  As a WAITER passes by with a tray
          full of champagne, Bryan grabs two glasses.

                                        BRYAN
                        Drink?

          He hands a flute to Johnny, triggering --


  5656VISION - INT. RESTAURANT - WEDDING #2 RECEPTION - NIGHT -
          HOURS LATER

          The wedding's long over and just a few straggling guests
          mill around in the b.g. as a comically drunk Johnny and
          Bryan, ties undone, suits rumpled, sit knocking back shots,
          bottle of Scotch on the bar between them, trading war
          stories.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (slurring)
                        Lemme tell you something about
                        life --

                                        BRYAN
                                (angry drunk)
                        No, dude, let me tell you
                        somethin'!





                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: SPEAK NOW - ACT FOUR - 3/25/04 - PINK      55.

          He slams down his shot glass.  As it shatters --

                                                                                BACK TO:


  5757RESUME INT. RESTAURANT - WEDDING #2 RECEPTION - PRESENT

          Johnny puts the glass back on a passing WAITER'S tray.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe not.

          As a PRETTY BRIDESMAID pulls Bryan onto the dance floor,
          Bruce moves in.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe you'll find her at this
                          wedding.

                                        BRUCE
                        Noooo.  I'm thinking you went and
                        changed the future -- meaning
                        mine, too.  Starting to think I'm
                        never gonna meet her --

          He halts, mid-sentence, struck by a WOMAN whose back is
          to us.  He stares at her a beat, there's something
            different in his eye this time.  Johnny sighs, moves
          towards her. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        This one's a freebie.

          Bruce stops him.

                                        BRUCE
                        Don't touch her.

          As Bruce moves past Johnny to meet the woman he thinks
          just may be "the one."  Johnny looking after them,
          wistfully, Sarah joins him, hands over a champagne glass.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (toasting)
                        To Maria and Alec.

                                        SARAH
                        Who are meant to be.

          They share a smile, clink glasses, sip.  And then --

                          JOHNNYSARAH
                    (overlapping)(overlapping)
                Sarah...Johnny...

                                        SARAH (CONT'D)
                                (beat)
                        You first.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I've been thinking... I didn't
                        wake up the same person I was
                        before the coma.  Who knows how
                        our life would turn out if...
                                (stops, then)
                        Fate... won't allow me to be the
                        kind of husband I'd like to be,
                        the kind of father J.J. needs,
                        the kind of man you both deserve. 
                        I have this gift... I didn't ask
                        for it, but it's changed me.  My
                        life isn't my own.  It belongs to
                        lots of people, not just the ones
                        I love.

          They hold a look.

                                        SARAH
                        You know, you never got an answer
                        to your question.
                                (off his look)
                        If someone had come up to me at
                        my wedding and told me that you'd
                        wake up in six years, what would
                        I have done...?

                                        JOHNNY
                                (letting her off the
                                hook)
                        You don't owe me answer.

          Johnny moves off.  ON SARAH, watching him go.

                                        SARAH
                        I would have waited for you.

          She turns and crosses up behind Walt, whispers in his
          ear.

                                        SARAH
                        May I have this dance?

          WALT turns, smiles, takes her in his arms, they kiss.

          ON SARAH, looking into his eyes, knowing she's made the
          right choice.

          ON JOHNNY as he glances up to see Walt waltzing Sarah
          onto the dance floor, the two of them laughing, looking
          so right together.  A beat.  Then --


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: SPEAK NOW - ACT FOUR - 3/17/04 - WHITE     57.


    57CONTINUED: (2)57

          Johnny pulls out his cell phone, dials.  Smiles when he
          hears the voice pick up on the other end.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey, Rebecca.  It's good to hear
                        your voice... Yeah,  I've been
                          thinking about you, too.

          Off Johnny, getting on with the business of living --

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                        END OF ACT FOUR
