  INT. WRITERS  ROOM/LIZ S OFFICE - MORNING

  LIZ enters with shopping bags.  Many of the WRITERS look  
  under the weather.  There s a flu going around.

                                LIZ
                        (brightly)
                  Good morning!  How is everyone?

                                FRANK
                  I caught that flu.  I have a fever, 
                my feet are swollen and I feel like 
                my intestines are going to explode.

                                LIZ

                St. Bartleby s?  Isn t that the 
                  most politically unstable island in 
                the Bahamas?

                                LIZ

                  What is it about that place?  Last 
                  year you came back so relaxed 
                  and... pleasant.

                                LIZ
                  I have the perfect resort, Pete.

                  grid, and showing bare feet is 
                  tolerated but not expected.

  Liz is lost in dreamy thought.

                                                                  FLASHBACK TO:30 ROCK 308: "TBD"                                    2.

  EXT. BAHAMAS RESORT - LAST YEAR

    Perfect Caribbean backdrop.  Island music plays.  Liz lounges 
    holding a blue drink in one hand and a butterscotch dipped 
  soft ice cream in the other.  She wears a long robe and her 
  feet are covered with matching hospital booties.

                                                                  CUT BACK TO:

  Jack and Elisa are having an intimate moment on the couch.  
  Jack leans in for a kiss but is interrupted by the ominous

                The early part of a relationship is

                Now my friend at the CDC could only

                  hard, like it or not, you re elite

                  jury duty, early warnings for 
                  natural disasters.  Come on, you

                Hey I m no better than you, Frank.  
                  Sure I work harder, I bathe 
                  regularly, and I didn t put vodka 
                in Sue s orange juice even though 
                we all know she s an alcoholic.

                She deserved it.  Not drinking is 
                so gay.

  Liz enters her office.  Cerie follows her in.

  He sneezes on it.  Liz starts to run.  Sick people  
    everywhere.  She grabs a prop gun to avoid touching them.  
  Liz sees healthy guys in the sound booth and runs to them but 
  they lock her out.  She pounds on the door.

                Of course.  Oh, Lemon, not that 
                  you d care, but a few hours after 
                you get a shot you end up with a 
                  very distinctive bruise in the 
                  shape of a bulls-eye.

  They exit, leaving Mr. Templeton behind.  Jack emerges and 
    tiptoes out.  He stops and casts an affectionate glance at 
  the old man.  Suddenly Mr. Templeton s eyes open.  He starts.

                No.  Sir.  My name is Jack.  I m 
                  just a man dating your nurse and I 
                  took advantage of your condition to 
                be with her.  You see, I ruined my 
                  last relationship because we didn t 
                  make time to be together and I was 
                so afraid of reliving that pain 
                  that I behaved terribly.  And I m 
                  sorry.

  It s a stylized, saintly moment: she smiles maternally, 
    Kenneth smiles back, everyone is moved, Grizz is glowing.  An 
    angelic light from above shines down on her (a GAFFER adjusts 
    a light to see better).  Kenneth reaches out a clammy hand 
  and touches his angel s face.  Make-up comes off on his hand 
    revealing... the bulls-eye bruise.  Everyone gasps.

  Liz reacts,  of course,  and stands.  A passing waiter hands 
  her an ice cream.  She moves to shove it in Banyani s face, 
  then thinks better of it, takes a huge messy bite and strides 
  off proudly, displaying odd tankoort bows and straps.
