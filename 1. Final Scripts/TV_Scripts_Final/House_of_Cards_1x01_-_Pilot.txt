      EXT. UNDERWOOD RESIDENCE - NIGHT

      SLOWLY PULL IN on the front door of a fashionable DC 
      townhouse.  

      Off-screen, we hear the SOUND OF SCREECHING TIRES followed by 
      a LOUD COLLISION.  A CAR ALARM blares. 

      After a moment, the door to the townhouse opens and A MAN 
      emerges, curious to see what the commotion is outside. 

      As the Man comes into the light we see he s dressed in a 
      crisp TUXEDO with the collar unfastened, no tie.  This is 
      FRANCIS UNDERWOOD - Richard III, Iago and Hannibal Lecter all 
      rolled into one.  He has intelligent eyes, mischievous lips 
      and a deep baritone dripping with Southern charm.

      Francis glances down the street.  He see a CAR backing up 
      then PEELING AWAY from the parked car that it just hit.  It 
      disappears around the block.

      As Francis heads purposefully toward the scene of the 
      accident, we begin to hear a DOG WHIMPERING IN PAIN.  Francis 
      looks down at the ground.  Francis  security detail guy STEVE 
      (40s) appears beside him. 

                                    FRANCIS
                    Did you get a good look?

                                  STEVE
                    Blue Toyota Camry.  First two 
                    letters of the plate.

      Francis and Steve gaze down at the suffering animal.

                                    FRANCIS
                    The Warton s dog.  

                                  STEVE
                    Looks like a broken back.

                                    FRANCIS
                    It s not gonna make it.
                          (to Steve)
                    Go next door and see if they re 
                    home. 

      Steve heads towards the neighbors  townhouse.

      Francis kneels down beside the dog.  It s in awful shape.  He 
      tenderly strokes the dog s head.  

                                    FRANCIS (CONT D)
                    Shhhh.  It s okay...                                                                                      2.


      Francis looks up at us.  The sound of CAR ALARM FADES.

                                    FRANCIS (CONT D)
                          (to the camera)
                    There are two kinds of pain.  Good 
                    pain - the sort of pain that 
                      motivates, that makes you strong.  
                    Then there s bad pain - useless 
                    pain, the sort of pain that s only 
                      suffering.  I welcome the former.  
                    I have no patience for the latter.

      With cool-headed deliberateness, Francis calmly places a hand 
      around the dog s neck and begins to put it out of its misery.  

                                    FRANCIS (CONT D)
                          (to the camera)
                    Moments like this require someone 
                    like me.  Someone who will act.  
                    Who will do what no one else has 
                    the courage to do.  The unpleasant 
                    thing.  The necessary thing.

      The Dog s muffled whimpers cease. Francis looks down.

                                    FRANCIS (CONT D)
                          (to the dog)
                    There.  No more pain.

      He lets go. The sound of the CAR ALARM RISES again.

      Francis stands as Steve approaches. The shook-up neighbors, 
      JACK and BARBARA WARTON, follow several yards behind.   

                                    FRANCIS (CONT D)
                          (aside, to Steve)
                    We need to leave in ten minutes.

                                  STEVE
                    Car s ready.

      Francis turns his attention to the couple. He gently 
      approaches them with endless sympathy in his eyes. 

                                    FRANCIS
                    It was a hit and run.

                                  JACK
                          (to his wife)
                    He must ve jumped over the gate 
                    again...

      Barbara wells up.  Francis lays a hand on her shoulder.                                                                                      3.


                                    FRANCIS
                    I m so sorry.  I ll have Steve file 
                    a report.  We ll track them down. 


      INT. UNDERWOOD RESIDENCE - BATHROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER

      Francis stands at his sink, methodically washing his hands.   


      INT. UNDERWOOD RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER 

      CLOSE ON FRANCIS  HANDS zipping up the back of a woman s 
      elegant evening gown. 

      We PULL BACK to see that the gown belongs to Francis  wife - 
      CLAIRE UNDERWOOD.  She s the epitome of elegance and poise. 

                                    FRANCIS
                          (taking her in)
                    Stunning.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (straightening his tie)
                    You too.

      Francis looks composed, dignified.  If we hadn t known, we 
      never would have guessed what he was up to just moments 
      before.  He offers his arm to Claire.

                                    FRANCIS
                    Ready?


      INT.  GRAND BALLROOM - SECONDS UNTIL MIDNIGHT

      A loud, raucous count-down.  DC's Democratic Party elite are 
      watching the Times Square ball drop on massive monitors. 

      Three! Two! One!  Noisemakers.  Applause.  People kiss and 
      hug. The sound fades as one face in the crowd, Francis, turns 
      to the camera.

      We PAN to the stage to reveal a beaming GARRETT WALKER (late 
      40s), the apotheosis of leadership.  He s flanked by his 
      family - wife PATRICIA and two teenage sons.  They lead the 
      crowd in  Auld Lang Syne. 

                                    FRANCIS (V.O.)
                      President-Elect Garrett Walker.  I 
                    might not like him, I might not 
                    believe in him, but it doesn t 
                    matter...                                                                                      4.


      The camera finds Francis in the adoring crowd.

                                    FRANCIS
                          (staring up at Walker)
                    Anyone who can get 70 million 
                    Americans to vote for him deserves 
                    my respect.
                          (to the camera)
                    I helped get him elected.  After 
                      twenty-five years in Congress I can 
                    tell which way the wind is blowing.

      We CUT TO to Walker s soon-to-be V.P. JIM MATTHEWS (early 
      60s) and his large gaggle of a family.

                                    FRANCIS (V.O.)
                    Jim Matthews - his Vice President.  
                    Former Governor of Pennsylvania.  
                    He did his duty delivering the 
                    Keystone State.  Now they ll put 
                    him pasture. He has four years of 
                    obscurity and impotence ahead of 
                    him. 

      CUT TO Walker s recently appointed Chief of Staff LINDA 
      VASQUEZ.  She s in the back of the ballroom, being prepped 
      with make-up for a TV stand-up interview.  

                                    FRANCIS (V.O.)
                    Linda Vasquez - Walker s Chief of 
                    Staff.  I like her even less than 
                    Walker, but she s the gate keeper 
                    to the White House.  If you don t 
                    want to be left standing out in the 
                    cold, you can t ignore the person 
                    holding the keys. 

      The lights from the TV cam flip on, bathing her face in a 
      bright glow.  She instantly flashes a toothy smile.

      We CUT BACK TO Francis standing in the crowd, his arm around 
      Claire s waist.  She s singing along with the crowd.

                                    FRANCIS
                    As for me - I m the House Majority 
                    Whip. In other words - I get things 
                    done. When it comes to legislation 
                    I make the magic happen.  I 
                    transform the impossible into the 
                    probable.

      We ZOOM IN SLOWLY on Francis.                                                                                      5.


                                    FRANCIS (CONT D)
                    But it s time to move up a rung.  
                    I ve paid my dues.  I ve backed the 
                    right man.  And now that he s won 
                    I ll get my just reward.  Give and 
                    take, give and take, and so the 
                    world spins.  

      TIGHT on Francis  face, filling the frame.

                                    FRANCIS (CONT D)
                    Welcome to Washington.


      TITLE AND CREDITS

      Iconic shots of D.C. - the Capitol, the Washington Monument, 
      Lincoln Memorial, Reflecting Pool, etc.  But we see them from 
      odd angles, cast in dark shadows or beneath moody skies.  The 
      feeling should be ominous. 

      We shift to interiors - dark hallways and restaurant booths 
      where slow-motion, silhouetted figures conspire with one 
      another.  

      Interlaced with all of this are recurring shots of dextrous 
      hands expertly shuffling a deck of cards and dealing them 
      out.  The FINAL IMAGE should be of the dealer unveiling his 
      hand to the camera: not four, but FIVE one-eyed jacks.


      INT.  FRANCIS S CAR - NIGHT

      Francis and Claire ride in the back the SUV.  Steve drives.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (she runs her hand through 
                          his hair)
                    You should get a hair cut.

                                    FRANCIS
                    You think?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Just a little trim maybe.  What 
                    suit are you going to wear?

                                    FRANCIS
                    For the meeting, or for the -

                                  CLAIRE
                    For the announcement.                                                                                      6.


                                    FRANCIS
                    My navy blue one, with the pin 
                    stripes.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Good.  You look handsome in that 
                    suit. 

      She leans into him, slips her hand between his thighs.  She 
      starts to kiss his neck.

                                    FRANCIS
                          (in a whisper)
                    We re only five minutes from the 
                    house.

                                  CLARIE
                    You re going to make me wait?

                                    FRANCIS
                          (with a sly smile)
                    Patience is a virtue.

                                  CLAIRE
                    I m not feeling very virtuous 
                    tonight.

      He smiles, leans in and kisses her.


      INT.  WASHINGTON HERALD - NEWSROOM - MORNING

      A bustling bull-pen of writers, editors and assistants.  
      Mounted TVs blare with 24 hour news channels.  The steady 
      clacking of keyboards wafts from a sea of cubicles.  

      ZOE BARNES (mid 20s) - a strong and hungry young reporter - 
      weaves through the cubicles toward a corner office.  

      Inside LUCAS GOODWIN (mid to late 30s) - the Deputy Editor - 
      is talking to BOB HAMMERSCHMIDT (early 50s) - the paper s 
      grizzled Editor-in-Chief.  

      Zoe waits by the open door and listens in.

                                    HAMMERSCHMIDT
                    ...Only a nine vote majority in the 
                    House.  Every bill that hits the 
                    floor will be a cock-fight.

                                  LUCAS
                    Yeah it ll be ugly.                                                                                      7.


                                    HAMMERSCHMIDT
                    Any guess what s on the legislative 
                    agenda?

                                  LUCAS
                    No idea.  All my regular sources 
                    won t say a word.

                                    HAMMERSCHMIDT
                    Keep digging.  

      Hammerschmidt gives him a slap on the back and exits, 
      brushing past Zoe, whom he barely notices.

                                  ZOE
                    Morning Mr. Hammerschmidt.

      He tries to place a name to the face.

                                  ZOE (CONT D)
                    Zoe Barnes.

                                  HAMMERSHMIDT
                    Metro.

                                  ZOE
                    That s right.

                                    HAMMERSCHMIDT
                    Keep up the good work.

      He s gone. Zoe leans against the doorway a tad provocatively.

                                  ZOE
                    Did it take him over a year to 
                    remember your name?

                                  LUCAS
                    What can I do for you Zoe?

                                  ZOE
                    I m sick of the City Council.

                                  LUCAS
                    I know you are.  You tell me 
                    everyday.

                                  ZOE
                    Move me online.  

                                  LUCAS

                    feed?  Be my guest.                                                                                        8.

                    No. My own blog. Five hundred 
                    words. First person.  Subjective.

      INT.  RUSSO S OFFICE - MORNING

      CHRISTINA MALONE (late 20s) - sexy and headstrong - ushers a 
      humorless looking LOBBYIST into Rep. Peter Russo s office.  
      Christina is Russo s Executive Assistant. Russo is smart and 
      amiable, but a bit of rascal. 

                                  CHRISTINA
                    Mr. Chapman, from Horizon Trust...

                                  RUSSO
                    Henry.  Great to see you.  Thanks 
                    Christina.

    She leaves, closing the door behind her.  The two men sit.

                                  RUSSO (CONT D)
                    How long are you in town for?  
                    Staying for the Inauguration?  I 
                    can hook you up if you - 

                                  CHAPMAN
                    I m not interested in parties.  I m 
                    interested in the zoning laws you 
                    promised to get changed in your 
                    district.  We ve got 12 million 
                    sitting in escrow for an empty lot 
                    we can t build on.

                                  RUSSO
                    Yes, I know.  And believe me, I m 
                    on it.  But you gotta understand, 
                    that s a local municipal issue.  I 
                    can t just pick up the phone and -

                                  CHAPMAN
                    You can t?  That s not what you led 
                    us to believe when you begged for 
                    fifty grand in donations.                                                                                    10.


                                  RUSSO
                          (realizes what he s up 
                            against)
                    Right.  Well...

      The phone rings.  Russo looks sympathetically to Chapman.

                                  RUSSO (CONT D)
                    One sec.
                          (picks up the phone)
                    Christina I told you - no calls.  
                    Not while I m meeting with Mr. 
                    Chapman.
                          (pause)
                    The President-Elect?  

      Chapman s eyes widen.

                                  RUSSO (CONT D)
                    Put him through Christina.
                          (short beat)
                    Mr. President-Elect...Thank you, we 
                    were pleased to win by double 
                        digits...Absolutely, anything you 
                    need...

      CUT TO Christina at her desk outside the office.  She s 
      whispering into a receiver.

                                  CHRISTINA
                    I need you to put that long, wet, 
                    talented tongue of yours between my 
                    thighs and make me squeal like 
                    Monica Lewinsky.

      CUT BACK TO Russo on his phone. Laughs boisterously. 

                                  RUSSO
                    Me too, me too...Okay, thanks again 
                    Mr. President-Elect.  

      And he hangs up.  Chapman is impressed.

                                  RUSSO (CONT D)
                    I m sorry - what were we 
                      discussing?


      INT.  BLAIR HOUSE - OFFICE - DAY

      As the Aide lets Francis into the office, we see that it s 
      Vasquez, not Walker, who is behind the desk.  Francis 
      registers a whiff of surprise.                                                                                      11.


                                    VASQUEZ
                    Thanks for coming Frank.
                          (gestures at a chair)
                    Please...

                                    FRANCIS
                          (as he sits)
                    Will the President-Elect be joining 
                    us?

                                    VASQUEZ
                    No.  He told me to apologize on his 
                    behalf. I ll brief him though.

      Francis has no other choice but to roll with the punches. He 
      hands Vasquez a manila folder.

                                    FRANCIS
                    This is a memo I drafted on the 
                    Middle East policy we ve been 
                      developing.  I think we need a more 
                    direct way to frame our approach.  
                    We ll steal from Reagan - trickle-
                    down diplomacy.  If we tackle -

                                    VASQUEZ
                    Frank - I m going to stop you right 
                    there.
                          (half beat)
                    We re not nominating you for 
                    Secretary of State.

      A huge blow.  Francis stares at Vasquez in stunned silence.

                                    VASQUEZ (CONT D)
                    I m sorry, I know he made you a 
                    promise, but circumstances have 
                    changed.

                                    FRANCIS
                    The nature of promises, Linda, is 
                    that they remain immune to changing 
                      circumstances.

                                    VASQUEZ
                    Garrett has thought long and hard 
                    about this, and he s decided we 
                    need you to stay in Congress.

                                    FRANCIS
                    I built the campaign s foreign 
                    policy platform from the ground up.

                                    FRANCIS (CONT'D)
                    I briefed him, I prepped him for 
                    debates. And the deal we agreed 
                    upon was -

                                    VASQUEZ
                    I m sorry Frank.  If it had been up 
                    to me I would ve handled this  
                      differently.  I wouldn t have 
                    waited this long to tell you.

                                    FRANCIS
                    So you knew this was what you were 
                    going to do.

                                    VASQUEZ
                    It s been an evolving discussion.

                                    FRANCIS
                          (slowly)
                    An evolving discussion...

                                    VASQUEZ
                    Frank...

                                    FRANCIS
                    I got fourteen conservative 
                    Democrats in key states to endorse 
                    him.  I was personally responsible 
                    for raising over six million 
                    dollars in contributions to the 
                    campaign, seven million for House 
                    races to keep hold of our majority 
                    in -

                                    VASQUEZ
                    You re right.  We wouldn t have won 
                    without your help.  But now we have 
                    to lead, and that means making 
                    tough choices.  
                          (half beat, now she has 
                          the initiative)
                    Our first order of business is 
                    Education Reform. A complete 
                    federal overhaul.  We want you in 
                    the House, doing what you do best - 
                    counting votes and delivering 
                      legislation.

                                    FRANCIS
                    I ve paid my dues Linda.  I deserve 
                    this.                                                                                    13.


                                    VASQUEZ
                    There are lots of deserving people 
                    Frank.  We can t nominate them all.  

                                    FRANCIS
                    I d like to speak with Walker 
                      personally.

                                    VASQUEZ
                    The decision is made.

      The two stare each other down like gunslingers.

                                    VASQUEZ (CONT D)
                    We need you Frank.  Desperately.  
                    Just not in the cabinet. I m asking 
                    for your help here.  Are you going 
                    to stand beside us?

      It takes every ounce of will to swallow his pride.

                                    FRANCIS
                    Yes.  I will.

                                    VASQUEZ
                    I m very glad to hear that.

                                    FRANCIS
                    May I ask - if not me, then who?

                    Michael Kern.

      He says the following with a smile, but underneath the table 
      we can see Francis cracking his knuckles with rage.

                                    FRANCIS
                    Michael Kern...That s an excellent 
                    choice.

                                CLEAN WATER FOR AMERICA

      We TRACK an older woman (50s) - EVELYN - carrying a folder 
      past side offices to CLAIRE S OFFICE.  She knocks on the 
      door, which is slightly ajar.                                                                                    14.

      INT.  CWA OFFICES - CLAIRE S OFFICE - DAY

      Claire is behind her desk. Evelyn sits across from her.  

                                  EVELYN
                    Maybe we should do this in steps.  
                    A couple people at first - see how 
                    that goes, then if we decide --

                                  CLAIRE
                    This isn t about operational 
                      efficiency, Eveyln. This is about 
                    freeing up money.  It s a new year.  
                    It s time to clean house a little.  
                    Spring cleaning, right?

                                  EVELYN
                    It s not spring - it s January.

      Claire just stares at her.  That was a stupid thing to say.

                    I just want to make sure we don t 
                    cripple our ability to function 
                    properly in the process.

                                  CLAIRE
                    I hear you, but if I thought that 
                    was going to be an issue, I 
                    wouldn t be asking for this list in 
                    the first place.

                                  EVELYN
                          (shifts in her chair)
                    Okay...

      Claire feels the needs to address Evelyn s discomfort.  She 
      leans forward, sympathetically.

                                  CLAIRE
                    We went over this before the 
                    holidays.

                                  EVELYN
                    I know...

                                  CLAIRE
                    You didn t mention anything then.                                                                                    15.


                                  EVELYN
                    I know...

                                  CLAIRE
                    We want CWA to maximize it s 
                      potential, don t we?

                                  EVELYN
                    Of course.

                                  CLAIRE
                    So can we agree it s time to 
                      reorganize?  To raise the bar?

                                  EVELYN
                    Yes.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Good.  Put a proposal together.

      Evelyn stands and exits, closing the door behind her.  Claire 
      glances at her watch.  Picks up her phone.  Dials.  Waits.  
      No answer.  Leaves a message.

                                  CLAIRE (CONT D)
                          (into the phone)
                    It s me.  I feel like an idiot 
                    leaving messages like this.  Call 
                    me back.

      She hangs up.  We linger on her for a moment.  An expression 
      of frustration and concern.


      INT. WASHINGTON HERALD - NEWSROOM - NIGHT

      JANINE SKORSKY (late 30s) - hard-edged and ruthless - is 
      punching away at her computer.  Zoe leans over her cubicle 
      partition, lingers for a moment.  

                                  JANINE
                          (not looking up)
                    What is it Zoe?

                                  ZOE
                    I know you re going to have your 
                    hands full at the White House, with 
                    the new administration and 
                      everything, so if you need somebody 
                    to do research, punch out 
                      background - 

                                  JANINE
                    I think I ll be fine.                                                                                    16.


                                  ZOE
                    But if things get hectic, if you 
                    need any help or -

                                  JANINE
                    So you can blog about rubbing 
                    shoulders with the big boys?

                                  ZOE
                    Lucas told you.

                                  JANINE
                    No offense, Zoe, but I don t have 
                    time to ween you off your training 
                    wheels.

      Wham - a slap in the face.  Zoe eats it.

                                  ZOE
                    Okay.  Just thought I d ask.

    She walks off, humiliated, fuming.


      INT.  UNDERWOOD RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

      TIGHT on Claire sitting alone, stock still, face grim.  

    We hear the front door open. In the background we see Francis 
      enter the room. He looks weary, spent.

    He comes into the foreground, sits down across from her.  
      Shame in his eyes.  Disappointment in hers.

                                  FRANCIS
                    Claire --

                                  CLAIRE
                    You didn t call me.

                                  FRANCIS
                    I was --

                                  CLAIRE
                          (harder this time)
                    You didn t call me, Francis.

      Before Francis can defend himself she s on her feet, all the 
      pent-up energy from waiting bursting forth.  She s furious.

                                  CLAIRE (CONT D)
                    When you didn t call me right after 
                      I wondered.  When I called and you 
                    didn t call back I knew. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    17.

                                  CLAIRE (CONT D)
                    You don t not call me.  Not when 
                    it s this big.

                                  FRANCIS
                    You re right.

                                  CLAIRE
                    When have we ever avoided each 
                    other? 

                                    FRANCIS
                    I wanted to figure out a solution 
                    first.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Did you?

                                    FRANCIS
                    No.

      A long beat.

                                  CLAIRE
                    So they lied to your face.

                                    FRANCIS
                    For months.

                                  CLAIRE
                    And you didn t see it coming?

                                    FRANCIS
                    It was always a possibility.  My 
                    mistake wasn t in failing to 
                    consider this scenario; it was in 
                      miscalculating the risk.  I thought 
                    it was almost impossible.

                                  CLAIRE
                    You re usually good at sussing out 
                    liars.

                                    FRANCIS
                    I am.  But this time...
                          (shakes his head)
                    Hubris.  Ambition.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Those aren t bad things.

                                    FRANCIS
                    They are when they blind you.                                                                                    18.


                                  CLAIRE
                    Aren t you angry?

                                    FRANCIS
                    Of course I am.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Then where s your anger?

                                    FRANCIS
                    You want to me lash out at Walker?  
                    At Vasquez?  You want me to go to 
                    the press and make mess of 
                    something I can t change?  

                                  CLAIRE
                    I want more than what I m seeing.

                                    FRANCIS
                    How kind of you.

                                  CLAIRE
                    I m not doling out sympathy.

                                    FRANCIS
                    I didn t ask for it.

                                  CLAIRE
                    You re better than this, Francis.

                                    FRANCIS
                          (genuinely)
                    I m sorry, Claire.

                                  CLAIRE
                    No. That I won t accept.

                                    FRANCIS
                    What?

                                  CLAIRE
                      Apologies.     

      Claire looks hard at him. A typical wife might smother him 
      with sympathy, but not Claire.  She knows that s the worst 
      thing she could do for a man like Francis.  

                                  CLAIRE (CONT D)
                    My husband doesn t apologize, even 
                    to me. 

      Claire walks out of the room toward the stairs.  We follow 
      her.                                                                                      19.


      As she ascend the stairs we hear a CRASH in the living room, 
      something SHATTERING.  She pauses without turning, just a 
      fraction of a moment, then continues up the stairs.

      BACK ON Francis in the living room.  Rage in his eyes. We see 
      an overturned coffee table.  Shards from a broken vase on the 
      floor.  He rights the table.  Bends down, picks up the larger 
      shards and places them on top.

      He walks over to the side window.  There s a pack of 
      cigarettes and a lighter neatly placed on the sill.  He 
      raises the window.  Opens the pack. It s nearly full.  He 
      pulls out one of the cigarettes. Perches himself on the sill.

      He turns to us, cooled down by now.

                                    FRANCIS
                          (to the camera)
                    My wife and I don t smoke.  Once a 
                    week maybe.  Together at this 
                    window.  It s our time to escape. 
                    To be ourselves.

      Lights the cigarette. Takes a long drag. 

                                    FRANCIS (CONT D)
                          (looks out the window)
                    But I m alone now.  
                          (back to us)
                    She s left me this way.  To myself.  
                    To my thoughts.  It s not a 
                      punishment; it s a challenge.  

      He looks back out the window.  Takes another drag.


      INT.  UNDERWOOD RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - DAWN

      Claire is in bed as morning light seeps in through the 
      window.  The bed is empty beside her.  Her eyes are open.  
      She stares at the ceiling. The alarm beeps.  She reaches 
      over, turns it off.  


      INT.  UNDERWOOD RESIDENCE - STAIRS - MORNING

      Claire descends the stairs in her bathrobe, freshly showered.  
      When she gets to the bottom of the stairs she sees Francis 
      sitting beside the window just as he was when she left him 
      the night before.  He doesn t turn to her.  She pauses for a 
      moment, taking in the tableau, then walks to the kitchen 
      without a word.                                                                                    20.


      INT.  UNDERWOOD RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - MORNING

      TIGHT on two cups in an espresso machine filling with 
      steaming coffee.  


      INT.  UNDERWOOD RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - MORNING

      CLOSE ON Francis, taking a cigarette out of the pack.  It s 
      nearly empty now.  He lights it.  Inhales.  Claire enters 
      with the espressos.  Sits down beside him, places one of the 
      cups at his side.  A moment.  He turns to her.

                                    FRANCIS
                    Did you sleep?

                                  CLAIRE
                    No.

      Claire waits for more.  Francis takes a drag.

                                    FRANCIS
                    I know what I have to do.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Of course you do.

                                    FRANCIS
                    We ll have a lot of nights like 
                    this.  

                                  CLAIRE
                    That doesn t worry me.

                                    FRANCIS
                    I m not sure how yet.

                                  CLAIRE
                    But you will.

      Francis hands her the cigarette.  Picks up the espresso and 
      downs it with one gulp.  

                                  FRANCIS
                    I should get to work.

                                  CLAIRE
                    I laid a suit out for you upstairs.  
                    The navy blue one.

    He gives her a kiss on the forehead.  Heads for the stairs. 
    We FOLLOW HIM as he ascends.  He turns to us.                                                                                    21.


                                    FRANCIS
                          (to the camera)
                    I love that woman.  I love her more 
                    than sharks love the smell of 
                    blood.


      INT.  UNDERWOOD S OFFICE - KAUFBERGER S OFFICE - DAY

      TIGHT on screen.  MICHAEL KERN (50s) - clean-cut and handsome 
      - is speaking at a lectern, flanked by Walker and Vasquez.  
      The ticker-tape reads: KERN NOMINATED FOR SEC. OF STATE.

      CUT TO DOUG STAMPER (early 40s) - Francis s well-connected, 
      amoral and loyal Chief-of-Staff - with NANCY KAUFBERGER (50s) 
      - Francis s Exec. Assistant.  They re watching the news on a 
      flat screen in Nancy s Office.

                                  NANCY
                    He s had work done.  A chin tuck.  
                    Probably botox. He definitely dyes 
                    his hair.
                          (after a beat)
                    Maybe the GOP won t confirm him.

                                    STAMPER
                    Oh no, they ll confirm him.  Walker 
                    is riding high.  It s not worth the 
                    political capital.  They ll save 
                    the big guns for legislative 
                    battles.

                                  NANCY
                    Hey Doug...

      He looks up to see Francis striding in from the main door.  
      Stamper grabs a folder.  The boss is here.  It s work time.  
      Stamper and Nancy head out to intercept him. 

                                    STAMPER
                          (opening the folder)
                    At 9:30 you re sitting down with -

                                    FRANCIS
                          (in stride)
                    Cancel everything.  Stamper, you re 
                    with me.

      Stamper tosses a glance to Nancy.  She s on it.  Francis 
      makes for his office.  Stamper follows.                                                                                    22.


      INT.  FRANCIS S (INNER) OFFICE - DAY

      Francis and Stamper behind closed doors. Stamper is trying to 
      process it all.

                                    STAMPER
                    How do we get there...?

                                    FRANCIS
                    We ll seize opportunities.  We ll  
                    make opportunities.  React. 
                    Respond. This is a time for broad 
                    strokes.

                                    STAMPER
                    I just don t understand how re 
                    we re going to -

                                    FRANCIS
                    For now we keep focused on what s 
                    right in front of us.

                                    STAMPER
                    Kern.

                                    FRANCIS
                    Yes.  And the Education Bill. 

                                    STAMPER
                    Who s drafting it?

                                    FRANCIS
                    Vasquez hasn t told me yet.  But 
                    I m guessing it ll be Harry Blythe. 

                                    STAMPER
                    He ll need to be handled.

                                    FRANCIS
                    Which is exactly why she wants me 
                    here instead of the State 
                      Department. 

                                    STAMPER
                    I can start digging on Kern.

                                    FRANCIS
                    Get me names first.  Let s have 
                    somebody to give them once Kern is 
                    gone.  And we should have a front 
                    man for that.  In case we need to 
                    distance ourselves.                                                                                     23.


                                    STAMPER
                    Who do you want?

                                    FRANCIS
                    A lost child.  Somebody we can save 
                    from himself. 

                                    STAMPER
                    I ll keep my ear to the ground.

                                    FRANCIS
                    Okay, I m going to get a bite to 
                    eat.  I haven t eaten in two days.


      INT. CAPITOL MESS HALL - LATER

      Francis waits at the checkout. Junk food heaped on his tray. 

      We hear some commotion.  Entering the mess hall is Michael 
      Kern followed by a couple of AIDES.  People are 
      congratulating him.  He s smiling like a pig in shit.

      Francis makes eye contact with Kern.  Smiles.  Gives him a 
      big thumbs up.  Kern nods with appreciation.  Gets 
      intercepted by another well-wisher.  

      Francis picks up his tray and turns to us, the smile on his 
      face instantly gone.

                                    FRANCIS
                          (to the camera)
                    A wink, a nod, a little warmth and 
                    grace - and with that one wraps 
                    oneself in a cloak of civility.  
                    Kern s not the sharpest knife in 
                    the rack, but he s not dull either.  
                    He knows I was up for the 
                      nomination.  He knows I must be 
                    jealous.  But he doesn t need to 
                    know the danger he s in.  Let him 
                    bask in the limelight for now. I ll 
                    sharpen my blade in the dark. He ll 
                    still be smiling when I slit his 
                    throat.


      INT.  EPISCOPAL CHURCH - MORNING

      The service is chock full of DC s political heavyweights, 
      including Francis and Claire seated near the back.  A 
      MINISTER is in the midst of delivering a sermon.                                                                                    24.


                                  MINISTER
                          (reads from scripture)
                     And whosoever shall exalt himself 
                    shall be abased; and he that shall 
                    humble himself shall be exalted.  
                    Matthew 23:12.
                          (looks up)
                    I d like to speak today on the 
                    subject of Humility. A lot of you 
                    just won re-election. If you 
                    hadn t, you wouldn t be sitting 
                    here.

        A smattering of chuckles among the congregation.  CLOSE on 
      Francis as the minister continues.

                                  MINISTER (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    Of course you should be enjoy your 
                    success, and be grateful for it.  
                    But never let your gratitude sour 
                    into pride. You ll have many 
                      challenges ahead over the next 
                    couple of years.  And a person s 
                    character is not determined by how 
                    he or she enjoys victory, but 
                    rather how he or she endures 
                    defeat... 


      EXT.  EPISCOPAL CHURCH - LATER

      We re following Francis and Claire as everyone files out.

                                  FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                    Claire...

      They re approached by another power couple: the longtime 
      Senator CHARLES HOLBURN and his socialite wife FELICITY, both 
        immaculately groomed, styled and outfitted. 

                                  CLAIRE
                    Hello Felicity.

      Holburn gravitates toward Claire, Holburn toward Francis.

                                    HOLBURN
                    Frank.

                                    FRANCIS
                          (shaking his head)
                    Morning Charles.

      We track Claire and Felicity, a few paces ahead of the men.                                                                                    25.


                                  FELICITY
                          (to Claire, 
                              sympathetically)
                    How are you?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Terrific. 

                                    FELCITY
                    I m sorry about the...you know.
                          (nods back toward Francis)

                                  CLAIRE
                    Oh, you mean the...

                                    FELCITY
                    Just awful.  Charles and I were so 
                    upset when we heard.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (smiling)
                    It s nothing.  Really.  Between you 
                    and me, I think Francis is 
                    relieved.  He feels much more at 
                    home in Congress.

      We JUMP OVER to Francis and Holburn.

                                    HOLBURN
                      I would ve bet a million dollars 
                    Walker was going to choose you.

                                    FRANCIS
                          (laughs it off)
                    Good thing you have a million 
                    dollars to spare.

                                    HOLBURN
                    But Kern - come on.  That s a real 
                    insult, isn t it?  He s got half 
                    the experience you do, and less 
                    than half the brain.  

                                    FRANCIS
                    He must ve had his reasons.  

                                    HOLBURN
                    This is bad for business.  We 
                    needed a strong-man in the State 
                      Department, not a straw man.

                                    FRANCIS
                    We ll make do.                                                                                    26.


                                    HOLBURN
                    You re a bigger man than me.  I d 
                    be pissed as hell.  

      Francis and Claire catch each other s eyes.  They appreciate 
      the sympathy of the Holburns, but they abhor sympathy as a 
      concept.  It feels humiliating.


      INT.  RUSSO S BEDROOM - NIGHT

      A cluttered high-rise apartment.  Russo and his secretary 
      Christina are having wild, wall-pounding sex.  

      As soon as Russo climaxes with a primal yawp, he rolls over 
      and pours himself a drink from the night stand.  Takes a sip.  
      He hands her the glass.  Grabs the bottle for himself.  Takes 
      a swig.  Regards the bottle.

                                  RUSSO
                    This is nice, where d you get it?

                                  CHRISTINA
                    The Speaker s holiday party.  I 
                    snuck into the V.I.P. room and 
                    stole it.

                                  RUSSO
                     92.  Wow.  Twenty years old.

                                  CHRISTINA
                    Seems about right for you.

                                  RUSSO
                    Funny.

                                  CHRISTINA
                          (starts to dress)
                    I m almost thirty.  That s ancient 
                    in your book.

                                  RUSSO
                    I don t discriminate when it comes 
                    to age.

                                  CHRISTINA
                    When s the last time you hired a 
                    forty year old assistant?

                                  RUSSO
                    That doesn t mean I haven t, or 
                    that I wouldn t.                                                                                    27.


                                  CHRISTINA
                    As long as they re good in bed.

                                  RUSSO
                    Oh come on.

                                  CHRISTINA
                    You do have a reputation, Peter.

                                  RUSSO
                    For being a good lover?

                                  CHRISTINA
                    For fucking the help.

                                  RUSSO
                    Where s this coming from?  

                                  CHRISTINA
                    You re not just gonna get your 
                    kicks, then toss me aside for some 
                    slut straight out of college?

                                  RUSSO
                    I can t.  You d sue me for sexual 
                      harassment.

                                  CHRISTINA
                    I m serious.

                                  RUSSO
                    So we re having that conversation 
                    now?

                                  CHRISTINA
                    It s been six months.  This isn t 
                    just a little office fling anymore.

                                  RUSSO
                    You want me to say the three magic 
                    words, don t you?  One of which 
                    starts with an L.  Okay, I ll say 
                    them.

      Christina turns to him longingly.  He takes her hand.

                                  RUSSO (CONT D)
                    Lick my balls.

    She slaps him playfully.  He wrestles her to the bed.  
      They re both laughing.  Now he s sincere.                                                                                    28.


                                  RUSSO (CONT D)
                    I love you.  I do.  I love you 
                      Christina.

      She smiles, rolls on top, kisses him.

                                  CHRISTINA
                    I love you too.

      A beat.

                                  RUSSO
                    So will you lick my balls now?

      She pushes him down for round two.


      INT. KENNEDY CENTER - LOBBY - NIGHT

      A full lobby. OPERA-GOERS dressed to the hilt.  A decidedly 
      middle-aged crowd.  Gray haired men, matronly women.  

      We ZERO in on Francis and Claire. People seem to be parting 
      subtly around them - a wide berth. Francis got snubbed for 
      the nomination and everyone knows it.

      And OLDER MAN and his wife pass by.  The Older Man gives 
      Francis a little double-pat on the shoulder - a consolation.  
      As Francis turns the Older Man and his wife have already 
      moved on.  The Older Man gives Francis a slight piteous nod.

      From Francis  POV we see the Older Man whisper into his 
      wife s ear.  She looks back at Francis and Claire.  Francis  
      gaze shifts to small GROUPING of couples, all stealing 
      glances his way and speaking in hushed tones to one another.  
      The gossip is palpable.

                                    FRANCIS
                    I need some air.

      Claire picks up immediately on his discomfort.

                                  CLAIRE
                    I ll see you at the seats.

      She disappears through the doors to the auditorium as we 
      follow Francis toward the door.


      EXT. KENNEDY CENTER - NIGHT.

      Franics stands outside, scrolling through his blackberry, 
      more to look like he s busy than because he is.                                                                                    29.


      A cab pulls up. Zoe emerges. She s in a strapless black dress 
      that hugs every curve. It isn t very fancy, but it sure gets 
      the job done.  

      It s cold.  She s not dressed for the weather.  Her 
      headlights are FULLY ON.  She turns to her date, BRIAN, early 
      30s - a typical Capitol Hill climber.  He s getting out of 
      the cab behind her.  

                                  ZOE
                    Gimme your jacket.

      He pulls off his jacket and hands it to her.  She drapes it 
      over the front of her dress and starts hurrying to main 
      doors.  She s not going to be late for this.

      As she climbs the steps Francis notices her - more out of 
      instinct than interest.  He glances at her ass ever so 
      briefly as she passes.  And it s an exceptional ass.  We can 
      tell from the form-fitting fabric that she s wearing a thong.

      Once Zoe has passed, Francis turns to his attention back to 
      the blackberry.


      INT. KENNEDY CENTER - OPERA - NIGHT.

      Francis slips into the booth and takes his seat next to 
      Claire. She doesn t even look at him, but she reaches out and 
      takes his hand. 

      The SOUND of an orchestra tuning. The LIGHTS begin to fade. 
      PUSH INTO Francis  face as the first subtle strands of MUSIC 
      begin to play and we CUT TO:


      INT. UNDERWOOD RESIDENCE - BASEMENT - NIGHT.

      Still TIGHT on Francis  face, the MUSIC carrying us into the 
      scene, we PULL BACK to reveal that he s wearing a headset 
      with a microphone. It s dim. Blue light flickers in his eyes.

      As we PULL BACK MORE we see that he s slumped in a chair, 
      still in his tuxedo (sans tie) with an Xbox controller in his 
      hands.  His thumbs and fingers deftly fly back and forth, but 
      the rest of his body is totally motionless - the calm and 
      focus of a true gamer.

        A silhouette enters the frame.  It s Claire.  She places her 
      hand gently on Francis s shoulder.  He pulls the headset off. 
      The MUSIC cuts out abruptly. From the headphones, we HEAR the 
      distant, tinny SOUND of other online gamers.                                                                                      30.


      Things like a 12 year-old kid taunting:  Imma cap your ass 
      muthafucka  and some redneck retorting:  Suck it dickless   
      The lowest of low culture, if you can even call it culture.

                                    FRANCIS
                    Going to bed?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Are you coming?

                                    FRANCIS
                    I ll be there in a bit.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Don t stay up all night.

      Claire leans down and kisses him on the forehead. Leaves.  
      Francis puts his headset back on. The online TAUNTS and 
        EXCLAMATIONS resume, full-force.  

      CUT TO the flat-screen TV.  It s Grand Theft Auto - a 
      complete bloodbath.  Francis  avatar starts blowing people 
      away.  Death. Carnage. Glorious vulgarity. 


      INT. CAB - NIGHT.

      The cab pulls up in front of Zoe s apartment. Zoe and Brian 
      are in the back seat.  Zoe s got Brian s jacket draped over 
      her.  She hands it to Brian.

                                  ZOE
                    Thanks so much.  I ll call you.

      She gives him a platonic peck on the cheek.  Opens the door.

                                  BRIAN
                    Wait...

      She turns back.

                                  BRIAN (CONT D)
                    I thought you had a good time.

                                  ZOE
                    I did.  I ve never been to the 
                    opera before.  I loved it.

                                  BRIAN
                    So...can I come up?

      She just looks at him patiently.                                                                                    31.


                                  BRIAN (CONT D)
                    I guess that s a no.

                                  ZOE
                    You re really sweet, Brian.  I m 
                    sorry if I gave you the wrong idea.  

      He looks dejected.  She s not going to let this turn into a 
      conversation.  

                                  ZOE (CONT D)
                    Thanks again for inviting me.  It 
                    was wonderful. 
                          (squeezes his hand)
                    Have a good night.  

      And she s out of the cab. She throws one last glance back at 
      Brian, a pity glance.  Then she s off. Quick, clean, 
      relatively painless. 


      INT. ZOE S APARTMENT - NIGHT.

      The sound of keys, the bolt unlocking.  The door opens and 
      Zoe enters.  Tosses her purse on the bed (just a mattress on 
      the floor, no bed frame) and slips off her heels.

      Goes to the fridge. It s pretty empty - just yogurt, some old 
      take-out containers, an empty Britta.  She grabs a yogurt.  
      Fishes a power bar out of a drawer.  Heads over to her 
      computer - a laptop amidst of a sea of papers and notes.  Her 
      desk is just a plywood board perched on cinder blocks.

      She dips the power bar directly into the yogurt (no spoon) as 
      the computer screen jumps to life.  Her fingers fly over the 
      keyboard.  New window.  Email.  Password.  Inbox.  Mostly 
      work stuff.  But there s a new message at the very top:

      FROM: Photogangsta@WashingtonHerald.com SUBJECT: Frank 
      Underwood ASS-WHIPPED.

      She clicks on the message.  A photo fills the screen: Francis 
      checking out Zoe s ass when she passed him on the steps of 
      the Kennedy Center. 

      There s text beneath the photo: If you want em to take you 
      seriously, maybe wear more than G-string?

      Command N.  New window.  Keys punched at lightning speed.  
      Google Search.   Frank Underwood.   Wikipedia comes up.  
      Click.  The words  House Majority Whip  stick out.  Zoe 
      considers this for a moment.  Clicks back to the other 
      screen.  Looks at the photo.  Hits reply.  Types quickly:                                                                                    32.


      He looks pretty serious to me.

      Send. Boom. Done.  


      INT.  UNDERWOOD S (INNER) OFFICE - MORNING

      Underwood is working at his desk.  Stamper knocks and peeks 
      his head in the door. 

                                    STAMPER
                    She s here.

                                    FRANCIS
                    Show her in.

      Stamper disappears.  Francis turns to the camera.

                                    FRANCIS (CONT D)
                    Quite rare for a President s Chief-
                    of-Staff to climb up the Hill. A 
                    gesture of respect, no doubt - 
                    which I appreciate, even if it 
                    comes at a cost.  Let s see if I 
                    was right about Harold Blythe.    

      He cranes his head to see her approaching down the hall.

                                    FRANCIS (CONT D)
                    Here she comes - my lesser but 
                    necessary half.

      Vasquez enters carrying a folder.  Francis stands.

                                    FRANCIS (CONT D)
                    Good morning Linda.  I appreciate 
                    you making the trip over.  

                                    VASQUEZ
                    Of course.  My pleasure.

                                    FRANCIS
                    I assume we re discussing 
                      Education?

                                    VASQUEZ
                    First things first...

      She places the folder on his desk and opens it.  

                                    VASQUEZ (CONT D)
                    The seating chart for the 
                      Inauguration.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    33.

                                    VASQUEZ (CONT D)
                          (points)
                    Do these work for you and Claire?

                                  FRANCIS
                    Wow.

                                  VASQUEZ
                    Which comes with a complimentary 
                    set of tickets to the Red and White 
                    Ball.

                                  FRANCIS
                    Claire will be over the moon.

                                  VASQUEZ
                    Good, I m glad. 
                          (closes the folder)
                    So - Education. We have Harry 
                    Blythe drafting the legislation. 

      Francis tosses us a quick glance.  His guess was correct.

                                  VASQUEZ (CONT D)
                    You can imagine the bind that puts 
                    us in.

                                  FRANCIS
                    The bill s going to be too be two 
                    steps to the left of Karl Marx. 

                                  VASQUEZ
                      Education s been his baby for 
                    twenty years.  We have to let him 
                    take the lead.

                                  FRANCIS
                    It ll be hard to drum up much 
                      confidence.

                                  VASQUEZ
                    Which is why I m here.

                                  FRANCIS
                    You want me to advise him.  Bring 
                    him toward the middle.

                                  VASQUEZ
                          (relieved he gets it)
                    We need to this bill to pass 
                    smoothly.

                                  FRANCIS
                    Consider it done, Linda.                                                                                    34.


                                    VASQUEZ
                    I know it s a lot to put on your 
                    plate...

                                    FRANCIS
                    You ve got 100 days before the 
                    honeymoon is over.  Anything you 
                    want to put on my plate, feel free.


      INT.  UNDERWOOD S (OUTER) OFFICE - FRONT DOOR - DAY

      Francis opens the door for Vasquez.  As she s leaving --

                                    VASQUEZ
                    Keep me posted?

                                    FRANCIS
                    Let me talk to Blythe.  I ll check 
                    in with you later this week.

                                    VASQUEZ
                    Terrific.

      Vasquez leaves.  Francis watches her go.  He speaks to us --  

                                    FRANCIS
                    She s wary.  I can see it in her 
                    eyes. 
                          (and now to the camera)
                    Walker s political capital rises or 
                    falls with the success of this 
                    Bill.  And I need to be at the 
                    center of it. 

      He closes the door, walks back toward his inner office.

                                    FRANCIS (CONT D)
                    Vasquez might not trust me as far 
                    as she can throw me.  But she 
                    doesn t have to.  If I prove myself 
                      indispensable, she can t afford to 
                    throw me very far.  

      He pops his head into Nancy Kaufberger s office.

                                    FRANCIS (CONT D)
                    Nancy, set up a call with Harold 
                    Blythe.

      Continues toward his office.                                                                                    35.


                                    FRANCIS (CONT D)
                          (calls out)
                    Doug?

      Stamper pops out from his.

                                    FRANCIS (CONT D)
                    You have a list for me?

                                    STAMPER
                    Just finished.

                                    FRANCIS
                    My office.


      INT.  FRANCIS S OFFICE - AFTERNOON

      Francis and Stamper are having a brainstorming session.

                                    STAMPER
                    Ferguson?

                                    FRANCIS

                    He s married with two kids.

                                    STAMPER
                    What about Catherine Durant?

      A beat.  Francis leans back in his chair.                                                                                    36.

      INT.  CWA OFFICE - CLAIRE S OFFICE - DAY

      Claire at her desk.  Evelyn sits across from her. Claire 
      peruses a document.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Can we do any better?

                                  EVELYN
                    Not without totally crippling our 
                    day to day.  And we might have to 
                    pull out of some of our impact 
                    studies.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (hands back the document)
                    Okay, we ll go with this.

                                  EVELYN
                    We re losing some very good people.
                    Folks who have been with us from 
                    the beginning...

                                  CLAIRE
                    This is a charity, but not for our 
                      employees. I can t keep people on 
                    just because they ve been with us a 
                    long time.

                                  EVELYN
                    Do you mind if I ask what we re 
                    going to use the money for?

                                  CLAIRE
                    An organization I want to bring in - 
                    World Water Initiative.  They ve 
                    done nice work overseas - Big 
                    projects. Very little budget.  

                                  EVELYN
                    Do we need to bring in a new 
                      organization?  If you want to 
                    expand overseas can t we just -

                                  CLAIRE
                    Evelyn - you re the office manager.       

                                  EVELYN
                    I know.                                                                                    37.


                                  CLAIRE
                    And you re an excellent one.  But I 
                    need you trust that I know what I m 
                    doing here.

                                  EVELYN
                    I do.  I think.

                                  CLAIRE
                    You have friends - I understand.  
                    People you ve spent years working 
                    with.  It s hard to see them go.

      Evelyn nods.

                                  CLAIRE (CONT D)
                    Should I bring somebody else in 
                    handle this?

                                  EVELYN
                    No.  I m good.  I can do it.

      Evelyn offers a resigned smile.


      EXT.  UNDERWOOD RESIDENCE - FRONT DOOR

      TIGHT on a finger pushing the door bell.  A moment later the

      She holds out her phone.  We can t see what s on it, but 
      Francis can.  He smiles.                                                                                    38.

                    You re a fan of the opera.

                                  ZOE
                    More for the people watching than 
                    the music.  Same as you.

      Francis is impressed by her brassiness. 

                                    FRANCIS 
                          (opens the door wider)
                    Come in, Ms. Barnes.


      INT.  UNDERWOOD RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER

      Francis pours drinks from the liquor cabinet.  Hands one to 
      Zoe, then sits across from her.  Zoe takes a sip.

                                  ZOE
                    It s strong.

                                    FRANCIS
                    You like it weak?

                                  ZOE
                    No - the stronger the better.

      She unwraps her scarf, revealing some impressive cleavage 
      Francis takes a quick glance, then finds her eyes again.

                                  ZOE (CONT D)
                    There s no harm in looking.  

                                    FRANCIS
                    That s a cheap ploy, Ms. Barnes.

                                  ZOE
                    Cheap but effective.

                                    FRANCIS
                    If your goal is to distract me - 
                    which you haven t.

                                  ZOE
                    I don t want you distracted.  I

                                    FRANCIS

                    I read somewhere that JFK never

                                    FRANCIS

                                  ZOE
                    My cell phone s on the back.  
                    Personal, not work.

      Francis pockets the card without looking at it.

                                    FRANCIS
                          (to Steve)
                    Did you put Ms. Barnes in the 
                    visitors leger?

                                  STEVE
                    Not yet.

                                    FRANCIS
                    Don t.
                          (to Zoe)
                    Needless to say...

                                  ZOE
                    Needless.  I get it.

      Francis smiles.  She smiles back. His desire to make her 
      visit  disappear  is a good sign.  He opens the door for her. 
      Claire is coming up the steps.  

                                  CLAIRE
                      Oh...hello...

                                    FRANCIS
                    Claire, this is Ms. Zoe Barnes, 
                    from the Washington Herald.

                                  ZOE
                    Very nice to meet you Mrs. 
                      Underwood.

      They shake hands.  Claire offers a polite smile.

                                    FRANCIS
                          (to Zoe)
                    Drive safe.  There s lots of ice on 
                    the road.

                                  ZOE
                    I will.  Goodnight.  And thank you.

      Francis and Claire watch Zoe walk off.

                                  CLAIRE
                      A reporter?

                                    FRANCIS
                    A hungry reporter.                                                                                    43.


                                  CLAIRE
                    Aren t they all?


      EXT.  MICHIGAN AVENUE - LATE AT NIGHT

      A BMW slows to a halt by the curb with a POLICE CAR slowing 
      to a stop behind it, lights flashing.

      CUT TO: A POLICE OFFICER ambles up to the stopped BMW and 
      aims a flashlight at the driver. It s Russo. He looks wasted. 

                                  POLICE OFFICER
                    License and registration.

                                  RUSSO
                    The glove compartment sweetheart.

      We see that there s a CALL-GIRL in the passenger seat.  She 
      gets the registration out of the glove compartment while 
      Russo pulls out his license and hands it to the cop.

                                  RUSSO (CONT D)
                    Here you go. 

                                  POLICE OFFICER
                    This isn t your license.  It s a 
                    Starbucks card.

                                  RUSSO
                      Oh...sorry about that.

                                  POLICE OFFICER
                    Sir - have you been drinking?

                                  RUSSO
                    No, I don t drink coffee at this 
                    hour.

                                  POLICE OFFICER
                          (not amused)
                    I m going to need you to step out 
                    of the car.

                                  RUSSO
                    If I was speeding just write me a 
                    ticket and I ll -

                                  POLICE OFFICER
                    Sir, out of the car.  Right now.                                                                                    44.


                                  RUSSO
                    Alright listen, I don t want to 
                    sound like a prick, but I m a 
                    member of Congress...

                                  POLICE OFFICER
                    I don t care if you re the King of 
                    China.

                                  RUSSO
                    China doesn t have a King.  It s a 
                    communist oligwock - ola - 
                    communist oligarchy.  Man, that s 
                    hard to say.

      The cop opens the door.

                                  POLICE OFFICER
                    Let s go.  Out.
                          (to the Call-Girl)
                    You too.


      INT.  UNDERWOOD RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - LATER

      The phone rings.  Francis groggily answers it.  

                                    FRANCIS
                    Hello...?

      Listens for a second.  Sits up, suddenly alert.

                                    FRANCIS (CONT D)
                    Good - let s think this through for 
                      a second...


      INT.  DINER - 4 AM

      The door swings open, jangling a bell.  In walks D.C. Police 
        Commissioner BARNEY HULL - a square-jawed career law 
      enforcer.  He glances around, doesn t see who he s looking 
      for.  Takes a seat in one of the booths.  

      A figure slowly spins around on one of the stools at the 
      counters and faces Hull.  It s Stamper.  

                                    STAMPER
                    Mind if I join you?

      Hull looks at him, perplexed.  Stamper gets off the booth and 
      slides into the booth across from Hull.                                                                                    45.


                                    STAMPER (CONT D)
                    Doug Stamper - the Congressman s 
                      Chief-of-Staff.

                                  HULL
                    I thought I was meeting someone 
                    else...

                                    STAMPER
                    No.  You re meeting me.

                                  HULL
                    What the fuck is going on?  It s 
                    the four in the goddamn morning and 
                    I ve got a City Council meeting 
                    in... 
                          (glances at his watch)
                    Less than five hours.

                                    STAMPER
                          (leans in close)
                    You ve been Police Commissioner for 
                    what - almost a decade now?

                                  HULL
                    We here to talk about my resume?

                                    STAMPER
                    Mayor of D.C. would look good on 
                    that resume, wouldn t it?

      Hull sits up straighter.  He s listening now.

                                    STAMPER (CONT D)
                    We know you ve been angling to run 
                    for some time.  Experience is your 
                    strong suit.  Endorsements and fund-
                    raising aren t.  But we can help 
                    with that.


      INT.  POLICE STATION - HOLDING CELL - MORNING

      Russo is sitting on a bench, head in hands.  We hear 
      footsteps.  He looks up.  A COP enters, unlocks the door, 
      opens it.  

                                  COP
                    You re free to go.

      Russo stands.  He s puzzled, but he s not about to ask 
      questions.  He exits the holding cell.                                                                                    46.


      INT.  CHRISTINA S CAR - LATE MORNING

      Christina is driving, Russo s riding shotgun.  

                                  RUSSO
                    It was just a few drinks.

                                  CHRISTINA
                    It was enough to get pulled over.

                                  RUSSO
                    But I was in control.  I wasn t 
                    drunk drunk.

                                  CHRISTINA
                    Were you alone?

                                  RUSSO
                    Yes.

                                  CHRISTINA
                    Say it to my face.

                                  RUSSO
                    Watch the road.

                                  CHRISTINA
                    Say it to my face!

                                  RUSSO
                    Yes - I was alone!

                                  CHRISTINA
                    You can t keep doing this Peter.  
                    It s gonna catch up with you.


      INT.  UNDERWOOD RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - MORNING

      Claire picks up two fresh cups of coffee from the espresso 
      machine.  Meanwhile Francis finishes slicing an apple, places 
      half the slices on one plate, half on another.  They meet at 
      the kitchen table - Claire with the coffee, Francis with the 
      apple.  Sit down.  Their morning routine.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Do you think we can arrange two 
                    more at our table for the Red and 
                    White Ball?

                                    FRANCIS
                    For whom?                                                                                    47.


                                  CLAIRE
                    The Holburns.

                                    FRANCIS
                    Why on earth would we want them 
                    there?

                                  CLAIRE
                    I m going to need her money for the 
                    CWA at some point.  

                                    FRANCIS
                    The expansion?

                                  CLAIRE
                    The staff cuts will only get us 
                    halfway there.  We ll need to fund 
                    new projects.

                                    FRANCIS
                    I ll talk to Vasquez.

      A beat.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (checking in)
                    How re we doing?

                                    FRANCIS
                    Good. 

                                  CLAIRE
                    Just good?

                                    FRANCIS
                    Progress.  Irons in the fire.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (smiles)
                    I like irons.  But I love fire. 

      He downs his espresso.  Stands.  Gives her a peck on the 
      forehead.  And he s out the door.  


      INT.  BLYTHE S OFFICE - DAY

      Francis holds up a document as HAROLD BLYTHE looks on.  

                                    FRANCIS
                          (holding up the document)
                    This is the only hard copy?                                                                                    48.


                                  BLYTHE
                    Yes. 

      Francis goes over to the shredder, starts feeding in pages.

                                  BLYTHE (CONT D)
                    What are you...

      Francis has put too many pages in.  The shredder jams.  He 
      yanks out the half devoured sheets and tosses them in the 
      waste basket with the rest of the 600 page document.

                                    FRANCIS
                    The bill is garbage, Harry, and you 
                    know it.  You ve wasted your time 
                    and mine.  I m not happy.

                                  BLYTHE
                    I m sorry Frank...

                                    FRANCIS
                    I don t want apologies, I want a 
                    passable bill. Tax increases?  The 
                    ban on vouchers? A Federal 
                    Oversight Commission?  How am I 
                    supposed to work with that?  You 
                    have to help me help you.    

                                  BLYTHE
                    I ll rewrite it.

                                    FRANCIS
                    By the inauguration.

                                  BLYTHE
                    If you want something from scratch 
                    that s going to be -

                                    FRANCIS
                    You have less than a week.  

                                  BLYTHE
                    That was years worth of work.

                                    FRANCIS
                    Then get me a short-form draft.  
                    Get me something I can put your 
                    name on.  We can flesh out the long-
                    form later.

      Francis points to the waste basket.                                                                                     49.


                                    FRANCIS (CONT D)
                    That version is dead. Erase every 
                    copy on every computer. 

      Blythe nods.  

                                    FRANCIS (CONT D)
                          (as he goes)
                    Call me if you need anything.

      And Francis is out the door.  We follow him.  He turns to us.

                                    FRANCIS (CONT D)
                          (to the camera)
                    Busy work for poor old Blythe.  
                      Eventually I ll have to re-write 
                    the bill myself.  Not because I 
                    care what s in it.  I only care 
                    about where it gets me.  And if it 
                    gets me rubbing shoulders with 
                    Walker again, it s served its 
                    purpose.  But to do that I need a 
                    bill I can pass.  Ideology is for 
                    standing still on a soapbox.  I 
                    never stand still.  I want 
                    momentum.


      INT.  HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

      TIGHT on the door.  A knock.  A moment later the door opens, 
      revealing the CALL-GIRL we saw with Russo the night before.  
      She s wearing a long overcoat and heels. CUT TO to Stamper.

                                    STAMPER
                    Come on in.

      The Call-Girl takes a look around the room, impressed.  She 
      unzips her overcoat.  Let s it fall to the ground.  She s 
      only wearing panties underneath.

      Stamper pulls an enormous wad out of his jacket pocket.  
      Tosses it to her.  She starts to flip through the wad.

                                    STAMPER (CONT D)
                    Ten thousand dollars.  What will 
                    that get me?

      She eyes him, a little frightened.

                                  CALL-GIRL
                    I mean I m kinky, but I don t know 
                    if I m the girl you re looking for.                                                                                    50.


                                    STAMPER
                    Oh you re definitely the girl I m 
                    looking for.

                                  CALL-GIRL
                          (stands)
                    This doesn t feel right...

                                    STAMPER
                    All I want for that money is your 
                    silence.  

                                  CALL-GIRL
                    My silence...?

                                    STAMPER
                    The guy you were with last night, 
                    the one who was arrested.  Do you 
                    know who he was?

                                  CALL-GIRL
                    You mean the Congressman?

                                    STAMPER
                    There was no Congressman.  There 
                    was no arrest.  None of it exists.  
                    All that exists is the money you re 
                    holding.  You understand?

                                  CALL-GIRL
                    Yeah.

                                    STAMPER
                    Good.  

      Stamper pulls out some more money from his jacket.  Folds it.

                                    STAMPER (CONT D)
                    Open your mouth.

      She does, he gently slides the bills between her teeth.

                                    STAMPER (CONT D)
                    Here s four hundred more.  This 
                    last bit is for me.

      He takes off his jacket and starts to unbutton his shirt.


      INT.  FRANCIS S (INNER) OFFICE - LATE MORNING

      Francis sits across from CATHERINE DURANT (early 50s), 
      another conservative Democrat from the South.                                                                                    51.


                                  DURANT
                    Secretary of State?

                                    FRANCIS
                    That s right.

                                  DURANT
                          (puzzled)
                    Walker just nominated Kern.

                                    FRANCIS
                    It s a long road to confirmation.

                                  DURANT
                    Kern is a boy scout.

                                    FRANCIS
                    No one s a boy scout.  Not even boy 
                    scouts.

      Durant is intrigued by Francis s tone.  She presses.

                                  DURANT
                    What do you have?

                                    FRANCIS
                      Absolutely nothing.

                                  DURANT
                    So what are we talking about here?

                                    FRANCIS
                    I m just asking a simple question - 
                    does the job interest you?

                                  DURANT
                    Wouldn t you want it for yourself?  

                                    FRANCIS
                    I turned it down.  

                                  DURANT
                    Really?  I heard that Walker passed 
                    you over.

                                    FRANCIS
                    I ve let that story ride so he 
                    could save face. I haven t spent 
                    twenty years in Congress to toss it 
                    aside for a four-year cabinet post.     

                                  DURANT
                    So why do you want Kern gone?                                                                                    52.


                                    FRANCIS
                    I want him gone because he s a 
                    pretty face with an empty skull.  
                    The Foreign Relations Committee 
                    needs a Secretary I can work with. 
                    Somebody brilliant.  Somebody 
                    tough.  Somebody who isn t afraid 
                    to stand up to Walker when he s 
                    wrong. We need you Catherine.  

                                  DURANT
                          (slight beat)
                    Let s assume I m interested...

                                    FRANCIS
                    I don t want to assume - I want to 
                    know.


      INT.  RAYBURN BLDG PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

      A Black SUV rounds a corner on the bottom floor of the 
      garage, pulls into an empty spot.  We can see that Steve is 
      driving.  The back door opens.  Stamper gets out.  He heads 
      toward a set of dumpsters in the far corner.  Looks around.  
      Sees no one.  Opens the lid to one of the dumpsters.  


      INT.  NEWSROOM - DAY

      ZOE is seated at her desk, looking miserable - trapped, under-
        appreciated, creativity stifled.  She s got her land line 
      phone to one ear and is taking notes she clearly doesn t give 
      a rat s ass about.

                                  ZOE
                      Uh-huh...uh-huh...

      Her cell phone vibrates.  She glances at it.   Unknown 
      Number.   

                                  ZOE (CONT D)
                          (into the land line)
                    Hold on.

      She answers the cell phone.

                                  ZOE (CONT D)
                    Zoe Barnes.

      After a beat she stiffens, suddenly alert.                                                                                    53.


                                  ZOE (CONT D)
                    Yes, anywhere you want.
                          (listens)
                    On my way.

      She ends the call.  

                                  ZOE (CONT D)
                          (into the land line)
                    I ll call you back.

      She hastily grabs her purse and coat, heads for the elevator.


      INT.  NATIONAL GALLERY - DAY

      Francis and Zoe sit side by side on a bench in front of a 
      Thomas Eakins painting.  It depicts two rowers in a skull. 

                                    FRANCIS
                    Do the math, Ms. Barnes.

                                  ZOE
                    He needs a bill...

                                    FRANCIS
                    Sponsored by?

                                  ZOE
                    Somebody with legitimacy...   

      Zoe thinks for a moment, then shakes her head.

                                  ZOE (CONT D)
                    But the person with the most 
                      experience...

                                    FRANCIS
                          (finishing her thought)
                    Harold Blythe.

                                  ZOE
                    ...is an old school tax and spend 
                    Democrat.  Walker ran as a 
                    moderate.  He s almost Republican.

                                    FRANCIS
                    Exactly, which is why he needs me.

                                  ZOE
                    To steer the bill to the center.                                                                                    54.


                                    FRANCIS
                    You were right about why Walker 
                    kept me in Congress.

                                  ZOE
                    Do you think Blythe would talk to 
                    me?

                                    FRANCIS
                    Be smarter than that.  He can t 
                    speak to the press about this.

                                  ZOE
                    Maybe somebody in his office, if I 
                    butter them up.  All I need is a 
                    few crumbs.

      Francis flips open a brief case.  Pulls out a bulky manila 
      envelop and places it in Zoe s lap.  

                                    FRANCIS
                    How about a five-course dinner?

      She peeks inside the envelope.

                                  ZOE
                    Is this what I think it is?

      Francis points to the painting.

                                    FRANCIS
                    I just love this painting, don t 
                    you?  

      Zoe looks up.  TIGHT on the two rowers in the painting.  Then 
      BACK TO the pair on the bench.  Francis turns to Zoe.

                                    FRANCIS (CONT D)
                    We re in the same boat now, Zoe.  
                    Take care not to tip it over.  If 
                    you do, I can only save one of us 
                    from drowning.


      INT.  ZOE S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

      Zoe in her cramped, hopelessly messy apartment.  She s 
      flipping through Blythe s original draft.  Making notes.  
      Utterly focused.  She has something no one else on the planet 
      has.  Her cell phone rings.  She presses ignore without even 
      looking at the number.  A moment later it rings again.  She 
      presses ignore.  Nothing is going to distract her.                                                                                    55.


      INT.  BLAIR HOUSE - VASQUEZ S OFFICE - DAY

      Francis and Vasquez across a desk from one another.  

                                    VASQUEZ
                    We need a passable bill.

                                    FRANCIS
                    And you ll have one. 

                                    VASQUEZ
                    Before the inauguration.

                                    FRANCIS
                    I didn t choose Harold Blythe.  You 
                    did.  And that s fine. I had to 
                    send him back to the starting 
                    gates, but I can work with him.  
                    You don t have to micro-manage 
                    this, Linda.

                                    VASQUEZ
                    The President-Elect is concerned.  

                                    FRANCIS
                    He shouldn t be.  And you shouldn t 
                    either. You re asking me to work a 
                    miracle. I understand that. And I m 
                    telling you - I ll work the 
                    miracle.

                                    VASQUEZ
                    Alright, Frank...

                                    FRANCIS
                    I have a favor to ask, though.
                    Can you fit two more guests at our 
                    table? For the Red and White Ball?

                                    VASQUEZ
                    Of course. I can make that happen.

      Francis shuts the door as Russo takes a seat.

                                    FRANCIS
                    Drink?

                                  RUSSO
                      Sure...what do you got?                                                                                    56.


                                    FRANCIS
                    Whiskey.  Bush Mills.

                                  RUSSO
                    If you re offering.  

      As Francis pours him a drink.  

                                    FRANCIS
                    How are things in the city of 
                    brotherly love?

                                  RUSSO
                    We re getting by.  

                                    FRANCIS
                    Good, good.

      Francis hands him the drink.

                                    FRANCIS (CONT D)
                    So it seems you ve been a 
                        bit...irresponsible.

                                  RUSSO
                    What...?

                                    FRANCIS
                    Don t play dumb with me Peter.  
                    Save it for the House Ethics 
                      Committee.

      Russo freezes - a deer caught in headlights.

                                    FRANCIS (CONT D)
                    Drink up, you could use some 
                    courage right now.

                                  RUSSO
                    You re not having any?

                                    FRANCIS
                    It s a bit early in the day for me.

      Russo sets his drink down.

                                  RUSSO
                    Is this about last night?

      Francis simply stares at him. A stare which says  yes. 

                                  RUSSO (CONT D)
                    How do you know about that?                                                                                    57.


                                    FRANCIS
                    Because it s my job to know.

                                  RUSSO
                    Look - they let me off.  There s no 
                    charges.  It s all taken care of.

                                  FRANCIS
                    Honestly Peter, do you really think 
                    these things take care of 
                      themselves?

      Russo suddenly realizes Francis was behind his release.

                                  RUSSO
                    It was just that once, Frank.  I 
                    swear to God.

                                  FRANCIS
                    Then you must hold God in very low 
                    esteem, because we both know that s 
                    a lie.  Drunk driving, prostitutes, 
                    cocaine - you ve got quite a long 
                    list of hobbies.  I m surprised you 
                    can find the time to represent your 
                      constituents.  What I should really 
                    have done is hang you out to dry.  
                    But then you d be of no use to me, 
                    would you?

                                  RUSSO
                    What is it that you want?

                                  FRANCIS
                    Your absolute, unquestioning 
                    loyalty.

                                  RUSSO
                          (after a beat)
                    Anything.  You name it, Frank.

                                  FRANCIS
                    Not now - but soon.  There will be 
                    no shortage of things you ll be 
                    able to do for me.

                                  ZOE
                    Wrong question.  The right question

      INT.  WASHINGTON HERALD - HAMMERSCHMIDT S OFFICE - AFTERNOON

      Hammerschmidt, Zoe and Lucas - serious shit going down.

                                    HAMMERSCHMIDT
                          (to Lucas)
                    Get legal on this - make sure we re 
                    not breaking any laws.  And I want 
                      a litigation assessment.
                          (to Zoe)
                    You won t tell me your source?

                                  ZOE
                    I can t do that.

                                    HAMMERSCHMIDT
                    Fine.  But if legal -

                                  ZOE
                      I understand.  How long do you 
                    think that will take?  We should 
                    get this online right away.

                                    HAMMERSCHMIDT
                    I m not just going to scan a 600 
                    page document and put it up before

                                  ZOE
                    I did that already.                                                                                    59.


                                    HAMMERSCHMIDT
                    You read the whole thing?

                                  ZOE
                    Cover to cover.  I ve got excerpts.  
                    Analysis.  Three thousand words 
                    ready for editing.  

      Hammerschmidt glances at Lucas.  They re impressed.

                                    HAMMERSCHMIDT
                          (to Lucas)

                    What s the angle, five words or 
                    less?

                                  ZOE
                    Far left of center.

                    Very.

                                    HAMMERSCHMIDT
                    Enough to put Walker on his heels?

                                  ZOE
                    Forget his heels.  This will put 
                    him on his ass.

      Janine enters.  She doesn t see Zoe in the corner.

                                    HAMMERSCHMIDT
                          (to Janine)
                    We ve got a draft of the 
                      administration s Education Bill.  
                    You re going to work with Zoe, do 
                      background copy. 

                                  JANINE
                          (incredulous)
                    Zoe Barnes?

                                    HAMMERSCHMIDT
                    That s right.  Whatever she needs.                                                                                    60.


      Hammerschmidt nods in Zoe s direction.  Janine sees Zoe for 
      the first time.

                                  JANINE
                          (as if it s disgusting)
                    Share a byline with her?

                                  HAMMERSCMIDT
                    No sharing. The byline is Zoe s.

                                  JANINE
                    But she s Metro.  I m your chief 
                    political correspondent...

                                    HAMMERSCHMIDT
                    Then you should ve brought in the 
                    story yourself.  
                          (to Lucas)
                    Zoe gets the byline.  Janine gets 
                    assisted credit.

                                  JANINE
                    Assisted?  Come on.  You can t -

                                    HAMMERSCHMIDT
                    Go.  We ve got 18 hours before 
                    tomorrow s print deadline.

      Janine glares at Zoe.

                                  ZOE
                          (to Janine, triumphant)
                    I ll see you at my desk.

    Zoe walks out.  Janine reluctantly follows.


      EXT.  THE MALL - MORNING

      A WIDE PAN of massive crowds gathered for the Inauguration 
      Ceremony on a crystal clear, January morning. 

                                  FRANCIS (V.O.)
                    Power is like real estate.  It s 
                    all about location, location, 
                    location.

    CUT TO the rostrum on the Capitol steps.  Walker has his hand 
      raised as CHIEF JUSTICE conducts the oath of office.  

                                  FRANCIS (V.O.)
                    The closer you are to the source, 
                    the higher your property value.                                                                                    61.


      We ZOOM IN on Francis and Claire sitting in the first row 
      behind the lectern.

                                    FRANCIS (V.O.)
                    A hundred years from now, when 
                    people watch this footage, who will 
                    they see smiling just at the edge 
                    of the frame?

      Francis gives a little wave to the camera.

                                  CHIEF JUSTICE
                    So help you God.

                                  WALKER
                    So help me God.


      EXT.  THE ROSTRUM - TEN MINUTES LATER

      TIGHT on Walker in the midst of his Inaugural Address.

                                  WALKER
                    ...Today is not simply about the 
                    next four years.  It s about the 
                    next four decades.  You ve placed 
                    your faith in me, and I, in turn, 
                    choose to place that faith in our 
                    children.  Our children are the key 
                    to this nation s future, and that s 
                    why the first order of business for 
                    this administration will be a 
                      comprehensive Education Reform Bill 
                    to properly fix, finance and 
                      strengthen our nation s schools.   

      Huge cheers from the audience.  QUICK CUT TO Francis, 
      clapping vigorously, staring right at us.


      INT.  RED AND WHITE BALL - NIGHT

      A huge reception hall decorated to the hilt. The mood is 
      festive.  Francis and Claire are seated next to Charles and 
      Felicity Holburn at the Vice-President s table.  

                                  FELICITY
                          (leaning into Claire)
                    It was so nice of you to make this 
                    possible.  When you called and -

                                  CLAIRE
                    Not another word.                                                                                     62.


      SHIFT TO Secretary of State nominee Michael Kern. 

                                  KERN
                    ... Your dog must be a genius,  the 
                    guy says.   Nah,  says the other 
                    guy,  He s pretty stupid.  Every 
                    time he s got a good hand he sniffs 
                    his ass.   

      Everyone at the table laughs at the punch line, Kern most of 
      all.  Francis forces a laugh.  Claire leans into Francis.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Go do your thing.  

      He squeezes her hand.  Gets up.

      CUT TO Blythe standing awkwardly alone eating a crab cake at 
      the hors d oeuvres table.  Francis approaches.

                                    FRANCIS
                    Maestro, I ve been looking all over 
                    for you.

      Blythe fumbles with the crab cake, accidently spilling it on 
      his lapel.

                                  BLYTHE
                    Shit.

      In an instant Francis has grabbed a napkin and begins dabbing 
      the stain.

                                  BLYTHE (CONT D)
                    Oh thanks...

                                    FRANCIS
                    Truly outstanding work on the new 
                    draft. You re going to make history 
                    with that bill Harry.  

                                  BLYTHE
                    Thanks for all your help Frank. 
                    Couldn t have done it without you.

      Out of the corner of his eye, Francis spots Catherine Durant 
      near the dance floor.

                                    FRANCIS
                      Catherine!
                          (to Blythe)
                    Excuse me Harry.

      And Francis glides over to Catherine.                                                                                    63.


                                    FRANCIS (CONT D)
                    Don t you look stunning.

                                  DURANT
                    We Southern girls clean up well 
                    when you get us out of the trailer 
                    park and into some Vera Wang.

                                    FRANCIS
                    And we Southern boys may be slow 
                    with our words, but we re fast on 
                    our feet.  

      He half bows, takes her hand and kisses it.

                                    FRANCIS (CONT D)
                    May I have the honor?

                                  DURANT
                    You most certainly may.

      He leads her onto the dance floor and they waltz beautifully.


      EXT.  PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE - EARLY MORNING

      The streets are empty.  Sanitation workers sweep up the 
      ticker tape from the previous day s celebration.  Police 
      crews load barricades into flatbed trucks.


      EXT.  FREDDY S BBQ JOINT - EARLY MORNING

      It s a bitterly cold, bright sunny day.  Francis arrives at 
      the restaurant with a newspaper tucked under his arm.  FREDDY 
      - the husky African American proprietor - sees him 
      approaching and opens the door for him.

                                  FREDDY
                    Mornin  Frank.

                                    FRANCIS
                    Morning Freddy.  How are you?

                                  FREDDY
                    Can t kick.  Come on in.

                                    FRANCIS
                    Actually, would you mind setting up 
                    a table for me outside?

                                  FREDDY
                    Outside?  It s freezing.                                                                                    64.


                                    FRANCIS
                    I ll be fine.  A little cold never 
                    hurt anyone.

      Freddy nods and heads inside.  Francis turns to the camera.

                                    FRANCIS (CONT D)
                    My one guilty pleasure is a good 
                    racks of ribs.  Even at 7:30 in the 
                    morning. I have the whole place to 
                    myself.  Freddy opens up just for 
                    me...

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Francis at a table, breath condensing in the cold air.

                                    FRANCIS (CONT D)
                    Where I grew up in South Carolina 
                    nobody had two pennies to rub 
                    together.  A rack of ribs was a 
                    luxury, like Christmas in July.  
                    I ve had a weakness for them ever 
                    since. 

      Freddy comes outside with a steaming plate of ribs.  Places 
      them before Francis.  Before digging in, Francis glances at 
      the newspaper he brought with him.

      Zoe s breaking story, detailing the contents of the leaked 
      Education Bill, occupies a huge swath of the front page.  The 
      headline reads:

                          EDUCATION BILL FAR LEFT OF CENTER

      We PAN DOWN to see Zoe s byline in bold above the article.

      QUICK MONTAGE

      -- Blythe in his office staring at the article on his 
      computer.  Complete horror.

      -- Vasquez in the back of an SUV scrolling through her 
      blackberry in even more horror.

      -- Zoe, Lucas and Hammerschmidt gathered around a computer 
      where a TECH GUY is monitoring a graph.

                                  TECH GUY
                    The web traffic is crazy.

      -- Janine watching Zoe, Hammer and Lucas from a distance, 
      eyes narrowed - jealous.                                                                                    65.


      -- A COP CAR with its lights flashing beside a dented BLUE 
      TOYOTA CAMRY - the same car that hit the dog in the opening 
      scene.  Two COPS cuffing the mangy 20 year-old CULPRIT.  


      EXT.  FREDDY S BBQ JOINT - MORNING

      Francis  plate is empty.  He wipes his hands and dabs his 
      mouth with a napkin.  Freddy starts to clear Francis s plate.

                                  FREDDY
                    You want seconds?

                                    FRANCIS
                    I better not.  

      Freddy starts off.  Scarcely a moment later...

                                    FRANCIS (CONT D)
                    Actually, yes.  I m feeling hungry 
                    today.

      Freddy goes inside. Francis stares right at us, piercingly.

                                    FRANCIS (CONT D)
                          (to the camera)
                    There are two kinds of pain, but 
                    only one kind of pleasure - total, 
                      unstoppable, undeniable victory.
                          (leans toward us)
                    The minister was wrong about 
                    defeat. I wasn t put on this planet 
                    to endure.  I was put on this 
                    planet to win.   

      He closes his eyes again and leans back.  Basks in the sun 
      and exhales a long, deep breath into the cold air. 

      The serenity is shattered by sudden, thumping ROCK MUSIC.

      Black out.

                                            THE END
