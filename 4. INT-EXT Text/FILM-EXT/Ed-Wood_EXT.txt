Lightning CRACKS.
We drift down past the dark clouds... through the torrential
rain... and end up...
OPTICAL:
We've landed in Hollywood, 1952.
We're outside a teeny, grungy
playhouse.
The cracked marquee proclaims "'THE CASUAL
COMPANY,' WRITTEN AND DIRECTED BY EDWARD D. WOOD, JR."
Pacing nervously in the rain is ED WOOD, 30, our hero.
Larger-than-life charismatic, confident, Errol Flynn-style
handsome, Ed is a human magnet.
He's a classically flawed
optimist: Sweet and well-intentioned, yet doomed by his demons
within.
The doors open, and Ed's pal JOHN "BUNNY" BRECKINRIDGE, 45,
hurries out.
Bunny is a wealthy, theatrical fop wearing a
string of pearls.
[PAGE 2 MISSING]
Suddenly the rest of the cast runs up, frantically upset.
In a
flowing white dress is DOLORES FULLER, 23, a sharp, hungry-
for-a-career ingenue.
She's near tears.
DOLORES
Eddie, my dove just flew out the
window!
CREW MEMBER
She goes on in two minutes! What
are we gonna do??
They all look to Ed, awaiting a response.
He thinks a second,
then excitedly CLAPS his hands.
ED
Dolores, give me your shoes.
DOLORES
What?
ED
The ghost can be barefoot.
Give
me your shoes!
She hands Ed her white shoes.
He snatches one, grabs a pair of
scissors, and starts CUTTING up the shoe.
Everyone is baffled.
He keeps cutting the shoe... and it slowly takes on the shape
of a dove!
Ed then grabs some pipe cleaners, works them into a shape, and
sprints into the dressing room.
He takes some green eye shadow
and excitedly smears it on the pipe cleaners.
Ed then hurries
back out, jams the green pipe cleaners into the cut-up shoe...
and it looks like a dove with an olive branch in its mouth!
The cast is flabbergasted.
CREW MEMBER
Wow.
BACK ONSTAGE
The soldiers suddenly look up.
ACTOR #1
Hey, I think I see something!
Dolores floats down onto the stage, holding out the dove.
DOLORES
I offer you mortals the bird of
peace, so that you may change your
ways and end all this destruction.
CUT TO:
Ed strolls across the busy movie lot, lugging the palm.
He
passes a soundstage and notices the stage door open a crack.
Ed glances around, then puts down the palm and hurries in.
Ed continues across the lot, carrying his palm tree.
An OLD
CRUSTY MAN sticks his head out an office window.
OLD CRUSTY MAN
Hey, Eddie!
Come in here.
I got
some great new stuff to show you.
Ed puts down the plant again and runs in.
Ed finally carries the tree into the Laemmle Building.
Ed shuffles down the street, his head hanging low.
A
restaurant door opens, and an EISENHOWER ERA NUCLEAR FAMILY
exits.
Whitebread Dad, Mom, Son, and Daughter stride out in
their starched clean clothes.
They march obliviously past Ed.
He watches them go, then
continues.
Ed reaches a building, "HOLLYWOOD MORTUARY," and
glances in the window.
A pause, then he does a doubletake.
THROUGH THE WINDOW
The showroom is filled with sample coffins.
Lying inside one
is BELA LUGOSI.
ANGLE - ED
He is flabbergasted.
Bela hurries along.
Ed chases after him.
ED
Why were you buying a coffin?
BELA
Because I'm planning on dying soon.
ED
(concerned)
Really?
BELA
Yes.
I'm embarking on another bus-
andtruck tour of "Dracula." Twelve
cities in ten days, if that's
conceivable.
Bela pulls out a large smelly cigar and lights it.
ED
You know, I saw you perform
"Dracula."
In Poughkeepsie, in 1938.
BELA
Eh, that was a terrible production.
Renfield was a drunk!
ED
I thought it was great.
You were
much scarier in real life than you
were in the movie.
BELA
Thank you.
ED
I waited to get your autograph, but
you never came outside.
BELA
I apologize.
When I play Dracula,
I put myself into a trance.
It takes
me much time to re-emerge.
A CITY BUS approaches.
BELA
Oh, there's my bus.
(he checks his pockets)
Shit, where's my transfer?!
ED
Don't you bave a car?
BELA
I refuse to drive in this country.
Too many madmen.
The bus pulls up, and the doors open.
Ed is worried he's about
to lose his new friend.
He gets an idea...
CUT TO:
Ed drives past pumping oil wells and into a seedy neighborhood.
They reach a tiny, well-manicured house.
Ed and Bela get out.
BELA
(bitter)
They don't want the classic horror
films anymore.
Today, it's all giant
bugs, giant spiders, giant
grasshoppers -- who would believe
such nonsense!
ED
The old ones were much spookier.
They had castles, full moons...
BELA
They were mythic.
They had a poetry
to them.
(he lowers his voice)
And you know what else?
The women
prefer the traditional monsters.
ED
The women?
BELA
The pure horror, it both repels and
attracts them.
Because in their
collective unconsciousness, they have
the agony of childbirth.
The blood.
The blood is horror.
ED
I never thought of that.
BELA
Take my word for it.
You want to
"score" with a young lady, you take
her to see "Dracula."
Bela's eyes twinkle.
He reaches his front door and unlocks it.
INSIDE... it's awful.
Squalid, dark, with skulls and strange
voodoo objects scattered about.
Up front hangs a large
photograph of shockingly young Bela, handsome and regal.
Ed is stunned by this dismal place, but doesn't say anything.
Within, DOGS start BARKING crazily.
BELA
Ugh, what a mess.
(beat)
My wife of twenty years left me last
month.
I'm not much of a
housekeeper.
The dogs BARK louder.
BELA
Shh!
I'm coming!
I will feed you!
ED
Well... I guess I should go.
Perhaps
we could get together again?
BELA
(he shakes his hand)
Certainly.
But now the children
of the night are calling me.
Bela smiles and steps inside.
The door closes.
CUT TO:
It's Halloween night.
CHILDREN in trick-or-treating costumes
parade up and down the streets.
Through Bela's window, we see
him and Ed watching TELEVISION -- a small fuzzy screen in a
huge console.
Ed and Bela run toward us, Bela's cape flapping in the wind.
Ed takes a swig from Bela's flask.
They're a bit tipsy.
ED
Are you sure this is okay?
BELA
Don't worry.
I do it every
Halloween.
The moonlight shines down on a rickety old cemetery.
The wind
blows hauntingly, and tombstones gleam in the blackness.
Ed and Bela reach the locked gates.
They glance at each other,
then start to climb over.
Ed helps Bela.
They jump down, and
Ed peers nervously.
ED
Now what?
Bela looks like a child on Christmas morning.
He takes another
swig, then starts running giddily.
He disappears into the cemetery.
BELA
I am DRACULA!
Bela darts happily through the graves.
His cape flies behind him.
BELA
I am the BAT!!
Ed's eyes light up.
He starts chasing after Bela.
Bela's heart is racing.
He zig-zags past ancient crypts.
Gargoyles peer down.
The wind howls through the skeletal
trees, silhouetted against the cloudy sky.
Ed runs through the shadows, trying to catch up.
Bela flaps his cape up and down.
We almost think he's going to
fly.
Ed races up, then quietly stops.
He eagerly watches Bela,
practically expecting him to turn into a bat.
It's a magical,
crazed moment.
BELA
I am DRACUlA!
I will LIVE FOREVER!!!
Bela laughs, then lies down on the grass.
WIDE
Ed slowly walks over and lies next to Bela.
They're happy,
eyes alert, on top of the world.
Ed peers in wonder at his new friend.
CUT TO:
We are on location for Ed's first film!
A SMALL CREW of a
dozen unpacks the camera and reflectors from their cars.
Ed's
voice rises above the hubbub.
ED (O.S.)
Excuse me, could I have everyone's
attention?!
Could you gather around?
I've got something to say.
The crew members put down their things and gather in a circle.
In the middle, we reveal Ed, in complete drag.
Dress, nylons,
pumps, lovely blonde wig... he's quite a sight.
Like an eager
Scoutmaster, he addresses his troops.
ED
Everybody, we're about to embark on
quite a journey.
Four days of hard
work... but when it's over, we'll
have a picture that'll entertain,
enlighten, and maybe even move
millions of people.
A COUPLE GRIPS glance at each other.
ED
Now the only way we're gonna achieve
all this is if we stay on schedule.
Day one -- TODAY -- we'll start easy.
We have eighteen silent scenes that
can be shot quickly: Cars parking,
Patrick's suicide, me strolling as
a man, me strolling as a woman, etc.
(beat)
After lunch, we'll bring in the
Inspector and the Doctor.
The Doctor
is very important to the plot, so we
might have to spend time on retakes.
But it's worth it.
Scene totals for
the first day is thirty-four.
(he catches a breath)
Day Two, we'll be a little busier --
Veteran CAMERAMAN BILL, an old guy with thick glasses, speaks.
CAMERAMAN BILL
Excuse me Eddie, I don't mean to
interrupt... but I'm gettin' a little
worried about those clouds.
He points up.
Everybody looks at the sky.
The clouds are
gray.
Ed nods in agreement.
ED
Good thinkin'.
We'll talk about Days
Three and Four later.
Now let's get
that first shot off!
It's Scene 17,
Glenda looking in the window.
THE CREW
disperses.
Ed quickly runs in his heels over to the burly
make-up man, HARRY.
ED
Okay, do I need any touch-up?
MAKE-UP MAN HARRY
I'm telling ya, eyelashes are the way
to go.
ED
(irritated)
Harry, we've discussed this a million
times.
I don't want to look like a
girl.
I want to look like myself.
MAKE-UP MAN MARRY
(disgruntled)
Fine.
Then you look beautiful.
Harry humorlessly powders Ed's nose.
Ed turns away and
suddenly SHOUTS into a giant megaphone.
ED
PLACES, EVERYONE!
ROLL CAMERA!
CAMERAMAN BILL
(nonchalant)
Rolling.
WIDE
Ed chucks the megaphone and runs crazily past the camera and
behind a building.
ED'S VOICE
And -- ACTION!
A pause, and then Ed, in character as Glenda, calm and
dignified, steps out and walks down the sidewalk.
Ed stops at a store window.
He's totally in shadow.
A grip grimaces.
He TURNS ON a light
Ed lights up.
He looks in the window, admires a dress on
display, then silently walks out of frame.
A beat.
Ed SCREAMS.
ED
And, CUT!
PRINT IT!
LET'S MOVE ON!
CAMERAMAN BILL
Don't you want a second take, for
protection?
ED
(exhilarated)
What's to protect?
It was perfect!
Suddenly a police car turns the corner.
CREW MEMBER
Cops!
ED
We don't have a permit.
RUN!
Everyone grabs equipment and takes off.
WIPE TO:
Dolores studies her script, as the crew lights a flimsy kitchen
set.
Ed strolls past, nonchalantly removing a ladies' wig and
earrings.
She stares in disbelief.
DOLORES
How can you just walk around like
that, in front of all these people?
ED
Hon', nobody's bothered but you.
(he gestures)
Look around -- they couldn't care
less.
DOLORES
Ed, this isn't the real world!
You've surrounded yourself with
WEIRDOS!
ED
Say it a little louder.
I don't
think Bela heard you in his trailer.
Dolores quiets down.
She feels bad.
ED
Dolores.
I need your help...
WIPE TO:
FILMING IN PROGRESS - LATER
A scene is being shot, on camera.
Ed (as Glen) and Dolores (as
Barbara) stare into each other's eyes.
He's dressed normal,
and she wears a fuzzy angora sweater.
ED (as GLEN)
"My mind's in a muddle.
I thought
I could stop wearing these things.
I tried, honestly I tried..."
DOLORES (as BARBARA)
(tentative)
"Glen, I don't fully understand this.
But maybe together -- we can work it
out."
She stands up, dramatically takes off her angora sweater, and
gives it to Ed.
He holds it meaningfully, then smiles proudly.
ED
Music swells... and CUT and PRINT IT!
Ed and Dolores hug.
CUT TO:
We're outside a cute little Spanish bungalow house.
Ed and
Dolores are moving in.
They lug furniture from a rented truck.
ED
From today on, our lives are
different!
We'll be swimming laps
in the same pool Jean Harlow did.
DOLORES
I don't know.
It's so much money...
ED
Who cares?!
We're on a ROLL!
These
are the moments in life you're
supposed to grab.
DOLORES
But Ed, we're not even married.
And
you don't have a job.
ED
But you do!
And anyway, I've got
tons of new scripts.
And now that
I have a track record, studios are
bound to hire me!
She just stares.
Ed shrugs, semi-reassuringly.
ED
Look on the bright side.
If we miss
the rent, what's the worst they can
do?
DOLORES
Toss us out on our ass.
ED
Exactly.
We're outside the imposing gates of MGM.
The lion logo is
overhead.
Ed drives up in his dirty Nash Rambler convertible.
He wears his nicest suit.
Ed peers nervously at the GUARD.
ED
Excuse me, I'm here to see Mr.
Feldman.
The Guard stares suspiciously at Ed.
His filthy car is leaking
oil.
GUARD
What's your name?
ED
Edward D. Wood, Junior.
The man frowns.
He looks through his files -- then finds a
parking slip with Ed's name.
He is surprised.
GUARD
Oh.
Eh, he's in the Executive
Building.
You can park in the
reserved section.
Ed smiles.
Ed zooms up and chipperly jumps from his car.
He buys a "Los
Angeles Herald-Express," eagerly opens it to the entertainment
pages... and then gets a confused look.
Ed quickly starts
rifling through the pages -- something is wrong.
Ed angrily shouts into the phone.
ED
Georgie, what happened?!
I thought
"Glen Or Glenda" was opening next
week!
Where's the ads?
An OLD-FASHIONED SPLIT SCREEN of Georgie on the phone appears.
GEORGIE
(pissed-off)
"Where's the ads"?!
The ads are in
Alabama, Indiana, and Missouri!
You
schmuck, it ain't gonna play L.A.!
ED
Why not??
GEORGIE
Because I can't sell it to save my
life!
You made a goddamn feathered
fish.
Is it an art film, a horror
show, a hygiene flick?
Nobody knows!
I'm beggin' people to book it.
ED
(insulted)
Maybe it needs special handling.
GEORGIE
Screw you, Wood!
I even sunk more
money into different titles:
"Transvestite" "He Or She?" "I Led
Two Lives"... It DOESN'T MATTER!
Nobody wants to see the piece of
shit.
ED
You can't talk that way about my
movie.
GEORGIE
"Your movie"?!
I wish it was your
movie!
I wish I hadn't blown every
dime I ever made into this stinkbomb.
If I ever see you again, I'll kill
you!!!
Georgie SLAMS down the phone.
His split screen WIPES off,
leaving Ed standing alone.
Ed stares at the phone, then quietly hangs it up.
CUT TO:
A tiny miniature European car pulls up.
Tor Johnson is
squeezed inside -- ludicrously oversized for this vehicle.
Tor
carefully wedges himself out and enters the bar.
The wind is blowing.
Ed's Nash roars up, and he jumps out, a
coat over his pajamas.
He runs up and POUNDS on Bela's door.
ED
Bela?!
Ed tries the door. It's unlocked.
Ed stands outside MGM, talking into a phone at the guard gate.
ED (on phone)
Mr. Feldman!
I haven't been able to
get through, so I just showed up.
Yeah, out front!
So, are we gonna
be working together?
(his face slowly falls)
Really?
Worst film you ever saw...?
(beat)
Well, my next one will be better.
(beat)
Hello?
Ed stands at a busy intersection.
He YELLS into a phone.
ED
Yes, that's right.
The Bela Lugosi.
He's still alive.
(beat)
Huh?
Is he available Friday night?
Gee, I suppose so... Why?
cut TO:
We're outside the legendary hat-shaped restaurant.
A large
Eldorado pulls up, and a CONSERVATIVE MAN and his PLUMP WIFE
step out and approach the DOORMAN.
CONSERVATIVE MAN
Excuse me.
We're here for the Wood
party.
DOORMAN
Ah, that would be in the Venetian
Room, sir.
The couple raise their eyebrows.
They're impressed.
Ed and his buddies wave goodbye to the departing backers.
ED
Goodbye!
Goodbye!
BELA
(to Ed)
So how'd we do?
ED
(faking a big smile, but SOTTO
VOCE to Bela)
We didn't make a dime.
IN THE PARKING LOT
A VALET hands the car keys to the Conservative Backer.
VALET
That's twenty-five cents, sir.
The man glances at his Wife. She shrugs.
WIFE
I gave all my money to the
babysitter.
The man grimaces.
He checks his pockets, pulls out a handful
of PENNIES, and counts them out...
CUT TO:
Ed sits in a chaise lounge by the pool, studying papers and
drinking shots of whiskey.
He's in a woman's pantsuit and
fuzzy slippers.
Dolores marches out.
DOLORES
Ed, the landlord called again.
He
wants his money.
ED
Tell him "Bride" is in pre-
production.
DOLORES
Ed, the landlord doesn't care.
ED
That's the problem!
Nobody cares
about my movie!
I'm tryin' so hard,
I don't know what else to do!
DOLORES
Don't get angry at me.
Maybe you
just need a day job.
ED
(upset)
Dolores, don't you understand?
I'm
a director now!
I made "Glen Or
Glenda."
Directing is my day job.
DOLORES
(irate)
All I know is, ever since "Glen Or
Glenda," all you do is booze it up
and wear my clothes!
Suddenly Paul hesitantly steps through the back gate.
PAUL MARCO
Uh, yoo-hoo.
Excuse me!
Sorry to
interrupt, but I got some big news.
ED
(dour)
Yeah...?
PAUL MARCO
Well my cousin Fred met this dame
from back East.
She's from "old
money," and he thinks she's loaded.
And here's the kicker: She's very
interested in the picture business!
ANGLE - ED
He slowly smiles. It's like sun breaking through rain clouds.
CUT TO:
We're at a fancy outdoor brunch.
Ed is shaking hands with
pretty LORETTA KING, 25, a pale brunette in a classy dress.
LORETTA
Pleased to meet you.
I'm Loretta
King.
ED
I understand you just moved here?
LORETTA
Yes.
Hollywood is oh so exciting.
A WAITER walks over, with a water pitcher.
WAITER
Water, Ma'am?
LORETTA
(suddenly freaking out)
No!
No water!
NO LIQUIDS!
I'm
terribly allergic to them!
The waiter is bewildered.
He hurries away.
Ed leans in.
ED
So my associate Mr. Marco tells me
you may be interested in investing
in a motion picture.
LORETTA
Perhaps a small amount of money.
(she smiles)
How much do one of your motion
pictures cost?
ED
For this one, we need $60,000.
LORETTA
That's all??
That seems very
reasonable for an entire picture.
Ed perks up.
She's a live one!
Ed pulls a script from his briefcase and hands it to her.
ED
Perhaps you'd like to look at the
photoplay.
LORETTA
Oh my, this is very interesting.
(she skims the pages)
Say... do you think it would be
possible for me to maybe play one of
these parts?
ED
(very enthused)
Oh, of course!!
There's a couple
characters you'd be perfect for: The
secretary at the newspaper office,
or the file clerk!
LORETTA
Hmm.
Those sound kind of small.
(stopping at a page)
Oh, here's one that looks good: Janet
Lawton.
I'd sure like to play her.
Ed blanches.
ED
J-Janet Lawton???
LORETIA
Yes, Janet Layton is clearly the part
to play.
She's got some real meaty
scenes!
Can't you just see me in
that part??
CU - ED
He is aghast.
What a stomach-churning decision.
He stares at
Loretta, then slowly croaks a response.
ED
Uh... yeah...
(beat)
You'd be perfect.
CUT TO:
We HEAR dishes being violently thrown.
Dolores SCREAMS inside.
DOLORES (o.s.)
You bastard!
You two-timing,
dress-wearing son-of-a-BITCH!!
The large stage door SLAMS shut.
Ed's disoriented cast and crew stand in the street.
Bela, Tor,
and Loretta are still in costume.
Ed looks totally dazed.
He blinks in the bright sunlight.
CUT TO:
Ed and Dolores are being evicted.
Their belongings are
scattered in front.
They bitterly carry furniture out of the
house.
Ed stumbles and slurs his speech.
He is drunk.
ED
Goddamn landlord.
DOLORES
I told you this was gonna happen.
ED
Maybe if you'd come to the backers
party, I would've gotten the money.
DOLORES
That's moronic.
Why would a bit
player impress a backer?
ED
(he starts yelling)
Look, how many times can I say I'm
sorry?
I blew it!
I thought she was
rich.
DOLORES
That's a good reason to dump your
girlfriend.
ED
I didn't dump you!
Get it through
your skull -- I just recast the part!
Ed drops the furniture.
He flops onto the sidewalk.
DOLORES
You're a fuckin' mess.
ED
So WHAT??
Look, we gotta figure out
where we're gonna stay.
DOLORES
I'm going to my mother's.
ED
Does she have room for me?
Dolores shakes her head.
DOLORES
I think you should stay with one of
your friends.
CUT TO:
Ed and Bela stroll through a parking lot.
Ed is sobered up and
remorseful.
Bela wears a beret and smokes a huge cigar.
ED
Bela, I don't know what I'm doin'
anymore...
BELA
Stop worrying.
This is going to
raise your spirits.
They reach the strange entrance to an avant-garde, Eastern
based quasi-religious temple.
Bela puts out his cigar, and
they enter the oversized doors.
The five men climb over a fence.
They're breaking into
Republic Studios.
Paul is panicked.
PAUL MARCO
Ed, you said you were getting
permission.
ED
Uh, I couldn't reach the guy... he
was in meetings all day.
But this'll
be great, I promise!
Ed smiles at Conrad.
Conrad shrugs.
Tor struggles.
TOR
I'm no good at climbink.
Tor gives up, and simply BASHES through the locked gate.
Everyone is amazed.
Tor laughs.
TOR
I'm good at bashink!!
CRISWELL
Hey, keep it down.
My publicist will
throttle me if we get caught.
They all sneak across the shadowy lot.
Remnants of old scary
sets tower over them.
OUTSIDE A SOUNDSTAGE
They reach a stage door. Ed tries it -- but it's locked.
ED
Oh.
I thought they kept this open.
A pause.
Everyone looks at Tor.
He grins.
TOR
Lobo will fix!
Tor grabs the heavy door and easily SNAPS the lock.
The five men hurry across the lot, carrying the hubongous
octopus on their shoulders.
Suddenly, a FLASHLIGHT shines on them.
ANGRY VOICE
Hey!
What are you doing?!
The men jump with fear.
They break into a fast waddling run.
CRISWELL
Thank God Tor broke the fence.
The team runs through the busted gate and escapes.
The Cadillac SCREECHES away.
The octopus flops on top of the
five men.
WIPE TO:
The movie crew is setting up for a big night shoot.
Lights and
generators are sprawled across this isolated area.
Tony McCoy perches goofily on his own personalized chair.
He
runs lines by himself.
TONY
"Now Janet, I want you staying away
from the old Willows Place."
The octopus lays in a dried-up riverbed.
There's only about an
inch of water.
Ed yells at Conrad.
ED
You don't understand!
The octopus
is supposed to live in a lake!
CONRAD
This is kind of a stream--
ED
NO!
It has to be UNDERWATER!
Ed storms away.
Conrad scratches his head.
IN A DUSTY PARKING LOT
Bela sits inertly in the back of an open car.
He weakly hails
over Ed.
BELA
Eddie, I'm so tired... I don't know
if I can handle a night shoot...
ED
Nonsense!
You look great --
(suddenly he catches himself; he
speaks more sincerely)
Look, uh, why don't you lie down and
take a little nap?
We'll film around
you for a while.
ED
Thanks, buddy...
Ed smiles warmly, then walks off.
Bela stares after him, then absent-mindedly searches through
his pockets.
Finally, he finds what he's looking for -- a
rubber tube.
Bela looks to make sure no one's around, then
ties the tube around his upper arm...
AT THE SET - LATER
Crew members have dammed up the end of the river, and Bunny
fills it with a hose.
There is now a foot of water.
Ed stands at the shore, admiring it.
ED
Hey.
This is looking good!
(he turns to Paul)
Paul, where's the octopus motor?
PAUL MARCO
What octopus motor?
ED
You know, to make the legs move --
PAUL MARCO
(defensive)
Hey, don't blame me!
You didn't say
anything about no motor when I was
up on that ceiling!
Bela stumbles up, with a dazed smile.
BELA
Let's shoot this fucker!
Where do
I go?
ED
You'll be fighting with the octopus.
BELA
Out there?!
(he points at the water)
What happened to the stream?
ED
This'll look a lot better.
We have
to match the stock footage of the
octopus underwater.
BELA
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Bela rolls up his pants and wades out, into the water.
He
screams.
BELA
Goddamn, it's cold!
ED
Once you're in it, it warms up.
BELA
Fuck you!
You come out here.
(beat)
Hey, toss me that J.D.
A crew member throws Bela a bottle of Jack Daniels.
Bela pops the cap and chugs half the bottle in one swig.
He
licks his lips, then climbs onto the octopus.
BELA
Okay!
How do we turn this thing on?
ED
Bela, somebody misplaced the motor.
So when you wrestle the octopus,
shake the legs a bit, to make it look
like it's killing you.
Bela stares, deadpan.
BELA
Do you know I turned down
"Frankenstein"?
ED
Huh?
BELA
After I did "Dracula," the studio
offered me "Frankenstein"!
But I
turned it down, the part wasn't sexy
enough.
It was too degrading for a
big star like me.
The crew glances at Ed.
ED
Bela, I've got twenty-five scenes to
shoot tonight.
BELA
Don't let me slow you down.
ED
Alright!
Let's put it on film.
CAMERA!
SOUND!
Bela takes another swig of J.D., then throws it off-camera.
ED
ACTION!
Bela starts flailing around the octopus legs and SCREAMING in
horror.
This image is truly ridiculous.
Ed is pleased.
Some crew members nod: Pretty good.
ED
And CUT!
Everybody cheers.
Then suddenly the dam walls BURST.
WHOOSH!
The water rushes from the lake and floods the park
below.
WIPE TO:
Crew members straggle in for the final shoot.
Everybody looks
bleary-eyed from last night.
Ed stands cheerily at the
entrance, greeting them.
ED
C'mon!
Just one more day!
Just have
some coffee, you'll feel better!
Tony staggers up.
TONY
Mr. Wood, I only got one hour of
sleep.
ED
Yeah?
Well I got no sleep, and I
feel great!
Ed sees Bela slowly shuffling along. Ed runs over to him.
ED
Bela.
I just wanna thank you again
for last night.
BELA
(exhausted)
That's fine, Eddie.
All in the line
of duty.
ED
No.
Seriously.
I want you to know
how much I appreciate what you've
done for me.
A great man like you
shouldn't have to run around in
freezing water at four in the
morning.
BELA
Well, there aren't too many other
fellas I'd do it for...
ED
(he smiles, then pulls out a
script page)
I wrote something special for you.
I got to thinking about all the
sacrifices you've made... and so I
wrote you a new final speech.
Ed hands him the paper.
Bela starts reading it, as Ed watches
anxiously.
Bela is very touched.
BELA
(still reading)
Eddie, this is quite a scene.
ED
I know it's a lot to give you at the
last second.
Bela looks up.
BELA
These lines -- I'll have no problem
remembering.
WIPE TO:
Outside, Vampira and two GIRL FRIENDS walk up.
They peer at a
tin sign.
GIRLFRIEND #1
"McCoy Meat Packing"?
Are you sure
there's a party here?
VAMPIRA
(holding an INVITATION)
Yeah, I got this invitation.
It's
a "Bride Of The Atom" party, whatever
that means.
They open the large steel door, and INSIDE is the wild bash.
Dolores runs across the parking lot, in tears.
Ed catches up
with her.
ED
Dolores, wait!
DOLORES
Ed, it's over.
I need a normal life.
ED
(hurt)
Did you really mean those things you
said..?
Dolores stops.
DOLORES
I'm tired of living on the fringe.
ED
But you used to say --
DOLORES
Ed... I just stuck it out so you
could finish your movie.
(pause)
Now that it's done, so am I.
She turns and walks away.
Ed is crushed.
He stands
motionless, in his dress, in the dark.
CUT TO:
Ed drives his Nash though a tract Valley neighborhood and
reaches Tor's little house.
Ed gets out, still looking groggy.
He walks up the tulip-lined path and rings the DOORBELL.
Clanging SWEDISH CHIMES bong inside.
The door flies open, and Tor appears, beaming.
TOR
Edvard, you come!
Tor gives Ed a back-breaking hug.
Ed shuffles down the street, Mr. Lonely Guy, feeling sorry for
himself.
He glances in a coffee shop, and sees a sweet young woman
inside.
Her name is NORMA McCARTY.
She wears a bow in her
hair, Mary Jane shoes, and a fuzzy white angora sweater.
Ed's eyes widen.
We're at a desert roadside motel, the San Bernardino Arms.
A
"Vacancy" light flashes.
There's a loud woman's SCREAM.
Then the door slams open, and Norma runs hysterically out,
clutching her dress about her.
NORMA
Stay away from me!
You're perverted!
Ed runs out after her.
ED
Please, be compassionate.
I'm your
husband!
NORMA
No you're not!
This marriage was
never consummated.
I'm getting an
annulment!
CUT TO:
Ed drives sadly through the streets, alone.
His car still says
"Just Married," and the tin cans RATTLE behind him.
CUT TO:
Ed's car pulls up.
Ed stumbles out, yanks off the tin cans,
and throws them in someone's trash.
Ed despondently approaches Bela's.
Inside, a light glows, and
the dogs BARK.
Ed is relieved.
Bela's awake.
He BANGS on the door.
ED
Bela, let me in!
Bela, it's Eddie.
He keeps BANGING.
Finally the door opens -- and Bela stands
there, shakily waving a gun!
Bela is doped up, glassy-eyed,
and disturbingly haggard.
BELA
Why are you here??
ED
Shit!
Bela, what's with the gun?
BELA
Why aren't you on your honeymoon?
Where's Myrna?
ED
Norma.
She changed her mind.
She
doesn't wanna marry me.
(beat)
Can you put down the gun?
Bela weakly lowers the gun.
Ed's car pulls up at the South Metropolitan State Hospital.
It's a grim, unwelcoming edifice.
Ed helps weak Bela from the car.
They look at each other, then
Ed gingerly leads Bela in.
Bela slowly gets into Ed's car.
BELA
Eddie, I wanna make another picture.
When are we gonna make another
picture?
ED
Soon, Bela... Soon.
CUT TO:
Bela is dressed in his Sunday finest, standing in front of his
little house.
He wears a cloak and a wide-brimmed hat.
BELA
This is so exciting.
Another
production!
WE WIDEN.
Out on the lawn... is just Ed.
With the camera.
BELA
So Eddie, don't we need a sound crew?
ED
No, this is just the second unit.
We'll do the main footage later.
BELA
Oh.
So what is the scene about?
ED
(improvising)
Uh... you're a very important and
respected man.
You're leaving your
house... and you're in a hurry to a
big social event.
Bela nods.
He mulls this over.
BELA
Okay.
But what if I'm not in too big
a hurry?
What if I take a moment to
slow down and savor the beauty of
life?
To smell a flower?
ED
(he smiles)
That's great.
Let's do a take.
WIDE
Bela goes in the front door.
Ed gets behind the camera, then
turns it ON.
ED
Okay, roll camera!
Rolling.
Scene
One, Take One!
(pause)
And... ACTION!
There's a moment.
And then Bela slowly steps outside, calm,
dignified, walking with a cane.
He looks about -- and then
something catches his eye.
He leans down and picks a flower.
Bela smells the flower, then abruptly drops it.
He starts
crying.
A pause, and then he composes himself.
The old man
slowly shuffles out of frame.
Ed peers emotionally from behind the camera.
ED
And, cut...
BELA
Eddie, how was I?
ED
(quiet)
Perfect.
Bela is pleased.
BELA
Good.
(beat)
Now what about my close up?
CUT TO:
Ed's Nash convertible pulls up outside a neat little duplex in
a nice neighborhood.
Ed is dressed up for a date.
He checks
his hair nervously in the mirror, revealing an anxious
boyishness we've never seen before.
Ed carries a bouquet of flowers to the front door.
He rings
the bell.
Kathy opens the door.
She looks very pretty in a
full skirt with a crinolin.
KATHY
Oh, flowers!
I didn't know you were
so traditional.
ED
(a little embarrassed)
I just picked them up on the way
over...
KATHY
They're very nice.
(she smiles sweetly)
Let me get my coat.
Ed and Kathy are at a tattered traveling carnival.
Rattling
steel rides and flashing lights spin about them.
They stroll
through the crowds eating cotton candy.
Kathy wears one of
Ed's flowers on her dress.
KATHY
So have you always lived in L.A.?
ED
No.
I'm from back east.
You know,
All-American small town... everybody
knew everybody, I was a Boy Scout,
my dad worked for the post office...
KATHY
Sounds like you lived in Grovers
Corners.
Ed and Kathy's little car comes to a stop.
He gets very
serious.
ED
Kathy, I'm about to tell you
something I've never told any girl
on a first date.
But I think it's
important that you know.
(beat)
I like to wear women's clothes.
KATHY
Huh?
ED
I like to wear women's clothes:
Panties, brassieres, sweaters,
pumps... it's just something I do.
And I can't believe I'm telling you,
but I really like you, and I don't
want it getting in the way down the
road.
Kathy is amazed.
She contemplates all this.
KATHY
Does this mean you don't like sex
with girls?
ED
No! I love sex with girls.
KATHY
Oh.
Okay.
ED
(surprised)
Okay?
Kathy slyly grins.
KATHY
Okay.
Ed grins back.
A moment.
CUT TO:
Hundreds of KIDS and TEENAGERS enter a dilapidated second-run
theater.
A banner says "'Bride Of The Monster' World Premiere!
Celebrities In Person!"
An antique limousine HEARSE drives down a dingy street.
The hearse pulls up.
A FRANTIC USHER runs over.
FRANTIC USHER
Thank God, you're here!
They're
tearing the place apart!
The gang awkwardly steps out of the hearse.
Tor gets out and
blindly walks straight into a lamp post.
WHACK!
He yelps.
TOR
Ow.
Bela moves slowly, very feeble.
Vampira smooths out her slinky
black dress, then puts her arm around Bela to help him.
FRANTIC USHER
C'mon!
This way!
The gang frantically runs out, scared for their lives.
They look over.
Some JUVENILE DELINQUENTS are stripping the
hearse.
VAMPIRA
We're gonna die.
The theater doors CRASH open.
The angry mob pours out.
Ed spins wildly around... and sees a cab approaching.
ED
Stop!
KATHY
STOP!
Kathy runs frenziedly into the street and throws herself at the
cab.
It screeches to a halt.
Everybody sprints over and jumps in.
The cab ROARS away.
Bela and Ed stroll down the street, in high spirits.
Bela
smokes a big fat cigar.
BELA
Last night was quite a romp.
ED
Did you see that kid grab Vampira's
tits?
BELA
I envied him.
(he chuckles)
Hell, I envied you too, having a
girlfriend that would jump in front
of a car like that.
ED
Yeah, she's really somethin'.
BELA
I know none of my wives would've.
Ed laughs.
Bela puffs his cigar.
BELA
Eddie, I want to thank you.
These
last few days have been a good time.
ED
I just wish you coulda seen the
movie.
BELA
No problem.
I know it by heart...
Bela stops walking.
And in a BOOMING, THEATRICAL VOICE, he
suddenly launches into his impassioned, climactic speech from
"Bride Of The Monster."
BELA
"Home.
I have no home.
Hunted...
despised... living like an animal
-- the jungle is my home!
But I
will show the world that I can be
its master.
I shall perfect my own
race of people... a race of atomic
supermen that will conquer the
world!"
Ed is touched.
A few people around them APPLAUD.
Bela's face lights up, proud.
An awed MIDWESTERN TOURIST hands
him a pen and paper.
TOURIST
Mr. Lugosi, could I have your
autograph?
BELA
Certainly.
TOURIST
Boy, that was incredible.
You're
just as good an actor as you always
were.
Bela puffs out his chest majestically.
BELA
Better.
(beat)
I'm seventy-four, but I don't know
it.
If the brain is young, then the
spirit is still vigorous... like a
young man.
Bela turns and smiles wanly at Ed.
Ed smiles back.
CUT TO:
On a grassy hill, Bela is laid to rest.
The small crowd of
mourners stands silhouetted against the dark gray clouds.
The coffin is lowered into the ground.
Ed stands at the front,
silently watching.
AT A DISTANCE
A few TABLOID PHOTOGRAPHERS snap pictures.
PHOTOGRAPHER #1
Whose crazy idea was it to bury him
in the cape?
PHOTOGRAPHER #2
I heard it was in the will.
It was
how he wanted to be remembered.
CUT TO:
A new Studebaker pulls up.
A bumper sticker says "JESUS SAVES"
A man in a plain brown suit steps out.
This is J. EDWARD
REYNOLDS, 50, Ed's santironious southern Christian landlord.
Reynolds assertively bangs on Ed's front door.
REYNOLDS
Mr. Wood?!
ED (O.S.)
Hruphh...?
REYNOLDS
Mr. Wood, this is Mr. Reynolds, your
landlord.
Could you please open up?
The door opens a crack.
Bleary Ed peers out.
ED
Yeah...?
REYNOLDS
Mr. Wood, you have bounced your third
and final rent check.
ED
(he sloppily lies)
I'm real sorry.
My stockbroker must
have transferred the wrong account...
C'mon in, I'll write you another one.
The straight-laced, devout CONGREGATION is gathered around a
large SWIMMING POOL.
Reverend Lemon, Reynolds, and our misfits
stand in the shallow end, in their white robes.
Criswell whispers to Vampira.
CRISWELL
Why couldn't we do this in the
church?
VAMPIRA
Because "Brother Tor couldn't fit
in the sacred tub.
MONTAGE:
THE REVEREND BAPTIZES ED
REVEREND LEMON
...Do you accept the Lord Jesus
Christ as your savior?
ED
I do.
Reynolds DUNKS Ed in the water.
THE REVEREND BAPTIZES BUNNY
REVEREND LEMON
...Do you reject Satan and all his
works?
BUNNY
(hiding a smirk)
I do.
Reynolds DUNKS Bunny.
THE REVEREND BAPTIZES TOR
REVEREND LEMON
...Do you repent for all your sins?
TOR
I do.
Tor winks slyly at Criswell.
Reynolds DUNKS Tor.
But Tor slips from Reynolds' grasp and
sinks to the bottom of the pool.
REYNOLDS
Oh my God, I dropped him --
Tor lies on the bottom, staring lifeinsly.
CRISWELL
(mischievous)
I don't think he's coming up!
REVEREND LEMON
Lord no!
The man's drowning!
REYNOLDS
(scared)
What do we do?!
REVEREND LEMON
Help!
HELP!!!
The whole Congregation starts JUMPING IN.
Men and women in
their Sunday finest leap into the pool and start tugging on
Tor.
But nobody can budge the big whale.
REVEREND LEMON
(near tears)
Dear Jesus, please forgive us!
ON TOR
He suddenly rises, Poseidon-like, from the pool.
Tor spits out water, then lets out a hearty BELLY LAVGH.
TOR
Tor make good joke!
The Baptists aren't amused.
CUT TO:
The bus stops in a scary, run-down neighborhood.
Vampira
off and warily looks around.
VAMPIRA
This can't be the right address...
She nervously walks down a dingy alley.
Vampira gets to an
unmarked grimy door, gulps, then slowly opens it...
Ed frantically marches out of the building.
He's still in his
ladies' outfit.
Ed sees a cab and WHISTLES loudly.
The cab pulls over.
Ed jumps in.
ED
Take me to the nearest bar.
CUT TO:
A car zooms by.
Kathy drives, as Ed shoots handheld out the
back window.
SCENE IN THE SPACESHIP SET
Th Hammy Alien argues with the humans.
PILOT
"So what if we develop this solarnite
bomb?
We'd be even a stronger
nation."
HAMMY ALIEN
"Stronger?
You see!
You see!!
Your
stupid minds!
Stupid!
STUPID!"
PILOT
"That's all I'm taking from you."
He WHACKS the alien.
A brawl breaks out.
SCENE WITH CRISWELL
Criswell lectures behind a desk, with mysterious lighting
CRISWELL
"Perhaps on your way home, someone
will pass you in the dark, and you
will never know it.
For they will
be from outer space."
SCENE IN THE CEMETERY SET
The famous shot: Tor and Vampira walk in a trance through
foggy cemetery.
Off-stage, Ed stands with the crew.
He shouts gleefully.
ED
More fog!
More fog!!
(he beams)
And CUT!
PRINT IT!
IT'S A WRAP!
END MONTAGE.
CUT TO:
It's pouring rain.
Standing in the drench is Ed.
He's wearing
a tux, and fighting with his open convertible top.
The
Rambler is filled with water.
Kathy stands under an awning.
She wears a pretty gown.
ED
I can't get it to go up.
KATHY
Ed, you're gonna miss your own
premiere.
ED
(he gives up)
C'mon!
Let's just go.
Ed impulsively opens the car door.
Water pours out.
Kathy
scurries out and jumps in the wet car with him.
The rain is gushing down.
The marquee proclaims "WORLD
PREMIERE: PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE!"
People hurry in.
Ed and Kathy roar up in the open convertible,
totally soaked.
He jumps out, opens her door, and they run
inside.
The rain comes down in sheets.
The doors burst open, and Ed
and Kathy run out.
KATHY
Ed, I'm so happy for you.
ED
Let's get married.
KATHY
(startled)
Huh?!
ED
Right now.
Let's drive to Vegas!
KATHY
But it's pouring.
And the car top
is stuck!
ED
(he gives his killer grin)
So?
It's only a five-hour drive.
And it'll probably clear up, once we
hit the desert.
Heck, it'll probably
clear up once we drive around the
corner.
I promise.
Kathy stares in disbelief.
Then she smiles.
They kiss.
Ed and Kathy jump into the open convertible.
The engine
starts, and they drive away, disappearing into the pouring
rain.
A moment.
And then, we move up, up, into the black clouds.
Lightning
CRACKS across the sky.
OPTICAL:
We slowly PULL OUT from the sky, move through a window... and
we're back inside
