is arriving early.

MALCOLM emerges into the street. On the phone.
MALCOLM
He did not say "unforseeable'. You may
have heard him say it, but he did not say
that, and that is a fact.

Toby and Suzy walking to work together.
SUZY
Did you take the washing out of the
machine?
TOBY
No.
SUZY
What do you mean, no?
TOBY
No. I didn't take the washing out of the
machine.
SUZY
It's going to go really stale.
TOBY
It'll be fine.
SUZY
It's not fine. By the time...
TOBY
It is fine. I'll wear stale pants.
SUZY
I don't want to go out with some who
wears stale pants.
TOBY
Well, there we go. I could go commando,
but I don't think that's acceptable in
government.
SUZY
(Disgusted)
Please. So: got everything you need for
your first day in International
Development?

TOBY
Oh Yes. It's all here. My massive
intellect. And an apple for Simon Foster.
SUZY
Simon Fluster.
TOBY
Don't say that, I'm rebranding him.
SUZY
Well he was crap on the radio last night.
He sounded like a chicken with a wasp up
its arse.
TOBY
Well I'm going to sort that out. After a
week I'll have him sounding like a
chicken without a wasp up its arse.
SUZY
Have a good day, good luck honey.
TOBY
Have a good day at the Foreign Office.
Try not to annoy Russia.
SUZY
I'll give you a call later. Keep your
phone on. Bye.
TOBY
Yeah, alright.
SUZY
Oh and be careful - cars!
They walk off in separate directions.

Simon, Toby and Judy drive along Whitehall in their car.
An awkward silence.
Judy looks at Toby. She knows Simon's just off to be
meat.
TOBY
(off Judy's look)
Just, maybe, might be best not to get too
excited. It might be that their guys
muscle in and have the lion's share of
the talk time.
JUDY
Yeah. It might be like that.
SIMON
I think I can work a room, okay? I'm not
a room virgin.

27
The conversation is continuing between Simon Judy and
Toby as they exit the FO.
SIMON
Yeah. Jesus. I really really hope there's
not a war. It's going to be a nightmare.
It's bad enough having to cope with the
fucking Olympics.
They appear outside. There's a press pack of 10 or so
reporters and photographers there.
PRESS
Minister!/Simon!/Mr Foster!
Simon is taken aback.
SIMON
Fuck. Who let the dogs out? We don't need
this.
JUDY
Er, you wanted a chance to row back on
the war. Do you want to nail the line?
SIMON
What? No. No. I'll freestyle it.
The press are calling.
REPORTER 1
Is war unforeseeable Minister?
SIMON
Look,
(grappling now)
...loads of things that are actually very
likely are also unforeseeable. Y'know,
For the plane in the fog the mountain is
unforeseeable, but then it, is suddenly
very real and inevitable.
Toby and Judy look at one another. This isn't good.

The press pack are looking for more.
REPORTER
Sorry, are you saying that...?
SIMON
What I'm saying is that to - walk the
road of peace, sometimes you need to be
ready to climb the mountain of conflict.
Thank you!
The press are writing furiously, making calls already.
Simon tries to look confident. He and the team get into
their car.
28
38
But then they reach the end of security and find
themselves dumped into the same arrivals area as everyone
else. They walk through.
SIMON
There will be a car won't there?
TOBY
Oh God yeah, of course.

They walk slowly looking at the various cabbies and
chauffeurs holding signs.
SIMON
Did you book a car?
TOBY
Me? No. I mean, Judy will have got
someone to do it.
He calls on his phone.
TOBY (CONT'D)
Hi Judy? Yeah sorry if you're in bed, but
we're here and...
(looks through papers)
Just can't see the car? Wondered what the
car situation was?

TOBY
(to Simon)
Yeah. She's really embarrassed. Sounds
like a snarl up her end. I'll see what we
can do?
He's looking panicked - then.
TOBY (CONT'D)
Here we go.
There's a guy with a sign that says `England Government -
Simon Forester'
SIMON
`Simon Forester?'

They get out of the limo, take in the hotel facade. Not

TOBY
Hello I need a number for a taxi in
Washington DC. Straight through please.
He's on the street.
TOBY (CONT'D)
Hello. I need a cab, right now. From?
From where? From from
(sees the house number )
TOBY (CONT'D)
It's 40, 46, that's the number, and it's
a street. It's a nice street with houses
and cars and a - sidewalk and it's got
leaves and - hold on I'm walking, I'm
walking to a sign ...

Toby running.

JUDY power walking/jogging on the phone to MALCOLM.
MALCOLM
(OVV)
Where is the fucking war committee
meeting?
JUDY
Simon's going to the war committee I
thought you knew?
MALCOLM
(OVV)
I thought I was going to the war

It's on the 7th floor in room 712.
(Beat)
Oh Malcolm, do you like how I'm telling
you what's going on where you are?
MALCOLM
(OVV)
Well let me tell you what's going on
where you are sweet heart, a certain
vinegar faced maniplulative cowbag is
about to find that she's out of a fucking
job...
JUDY hangs up.

Malcolm is legging it down the street.

Malcolm running like a madman.
71

Malcolm, Toby, and Simon are heading towards their car.
They see the Washington Monument in the distance.
SIMON
It's beautiful.
TOBY
If you pull it out, America deflates.
MALCOLM
Don't mock that! The closest you'll come
to getting one of those is buying a
Toblerone.
(Looks at Blackberry)
Mark Hadley's dad's died.
SIMON
Oh no. Should we send Mark a card?
MALCOLM
Nah, I'll send him a ouija board so they
can keep in touch.

SIMON
So what are we getting back to? Apart
from a nice cup of tea and some knife
crime?
TOBY
Constituency surgery in Northampton.
SIMON
Great, meeting my constituents. It's like
being Simon Cowell, but without the
ability to say, `Fuck off, you're
mental.'

Simon and Judy on their way into the foreign office.
Malcolm has gone in ahead. Suzy chatting on the stairs
with Toby.
Simon draws Judy to one side.
SIMON
This is all getting...this is a really
stressful job, you know that?
JUDY
Oh come on, you're not a brain surgeon,
you're not a snooker player ...
SIMON
I don't want to back a war, Judy.

JUDY
(oh this is what it's about)
Oh. Right.
A beat.
SIMON
Look, drop some hints, put some nods and
winks out there, that I'm toying with
resignation. Yeah? See if the PM reacts.
See how it plays.
JUDY
Put out some winks?
SIMON
And nods.
JUDY
Big nods?
SIMON
No, no, just sort of...
(he does a small nod)
That sort of size nod.
Judy nods.
SIMON (CONT'D)
No, not that much.
JUDY
No, I was just nodding normally to say I
understood the need for a small nod.
SIMON
Oh. Good.
They head in.

Malcolm finishing listening to his voicemail, dialling
and running back into the building, pushing past a crowd
of smokers at the doorway.
MALCOLM
Okay Jamie, two jobs. One: find the Pwip
Pip leaker and kill them. That's one job.
Job one has two parts. Job two: stop Pwip
Pip coming out. Sow enough seeds of fear
and doubt that the fat arses at the BBC
dither till after the vote, okay? After
the vote Enola Gay is cleared for take-
off and everything is groovy.
I love
you.
