      MODEL-HOT GUESTS throng the poolside tables and cabanas.  
      CAMERA TRACKS an exquisite female form in a day-glo bikini 
      swimming under the water.  She breaks the surface and we see 

      IT S ABBY.

      She scans the crowd, clocks a slick 40-something in a linen 
      suit.  This is JAMES MACKAL.  He crosses to the bar.  Abby 
      slides on a kimono silk robe and grabs an oversized Diane Von 
      Furstenberg beach tote.  As she weaves her way to...


      Mackal lifts a pomegranate martini to his lips -- WHAM! 
      Abby s tote  accidentally  knocks him as she passes.  His 
      drink sloshes onto his linen suit.  She is mortified.                                                                                  3.


                                  ABBY
                    I m so sorry.  
                          (re: red stain)
                    I managed to kill your martini and 
                    mortally wound your jacket. 

                                  MACKAL
                    I don t think it s fatal.   

      Abby takes a glass of soda water, dips some napkins and 
      starts to dab the stain.  Mackal enjoys the attention. 

                                  MACKAL
                    I m impressed with your skills. 

                                  ABBY
                    Clothes and cocktails are my 
                      specialty.

      He s too busy flirting to notice Abby expertly pickpocket his 
      cell phone.  

      GO TIGHT:  She presses a wafer-thin, penny-sized bug onto the 
      back of the device. 

                                  ABBY
                    You re good to go. 

      She dumps the napkins onto the illuminated counter and 
      discreetly slips the cell phone back into Mackal s pocket.  

                                  MACKAL
                    Can I buy you a drink? 

                                  ABBY
                    I m such a klutz, I d probably 
                    spill it.  One fashion emergency is 
                    enough for tonight. 

      She turns away.  Her girly smile evaporates and is replaced 
      with steel-edged determination.  She pulls an earwig from her 
      robe and slots it into place.  

                                  ABBY
                          (into earwig)
                    Okay, Angels, time to fly. 

      SCREEN DIVIDES TO INCLUDE:


      GLORIA.

      She s wearing a tailored three-piece pinstripe suit with an 
      adorable matching cap and is hands down the sexiest chauffeur 
      you ve ever seen.  A stretch limo gleams behind her.  

                                  GLORIA
                    Walking off his G6 as we speak. 

      She steps forward to greet ROGER FISK as he descends the 
      steps of a Gulfstream.  He s 45, an unremarkable accountant 
      type.  She flashes a million-dollar smile.

                                  GLORIA
                    Welcome to Miami, Mr. Fisk.

      TRISCREEN ENDS as she escorts him to the limo... 


      Abby weaves through the crowd.  

                                  ABBY
                          (into earwig)
                    Bosley. 

      A jowly MIDDLE-AGED MAN in an ascot and blazer turns.  She 
      smiles politely, moves past but stops when she sees the real 
      deal sitting in a hot tub with TWO NORWEGIAN SUPERMODELS.

      JOHN BOSLEY 

      is 30, a perfect specimen of 21st-Century American manhood -- 
      a chiseled, whip-smart, tech-savvy, preppy charmer.  

                                  ABBY (V.O.)
                          (over earwig, annoyed)
                    Bosley, adult swim is over. 

      He looks over and catches Abby s disapproving glare.   

                                  BOSLEY
                    Sorry, ladies, duty calls.  
                          (Norwegian with subtitles)
                    Text me.

      Bosley climbs out, sees Abby head through a door marked 
       EMPLOYEES ONLY, SERVICE ROOF ACCESS , and crosses to...


      Neon reflections ricochet off the hood.      


      The limo SCREAM-PEELS across two lanes of traffic, sending 
      cars SKIDDING, and CAREENS into a deserted, multilevel 
      parking structure. 


      Abby zips up a black bodysuit, tightens the straps of a 
      climbing harness, then grabs a sleek crossbow and a coil of 
      cable from her tote.  


      Mackal waits at the bar.  Checks his watch, impatient, until 
      his cell phone CHIMES.  As he slides it to his ear, he 
      doesn t notice the bug attached to the back of the handset.

                                  FISK (V.O.)
                          (over phone)
                    It s Fisk.  The limo never showed.  
                    I m jumping in a cab.   

                                  MACKAL
                          (into phone)
                    I ll be here.  

      Mackal CLICKS off and speed-dials a number.

                                  MACKAL
                    Sit tight.  Buyer s rep is running 
                    late.    


        A REMOTE-CONTROLLED TOY HELICOPTER lifts off from between the 
      hotel s air conditioning units.  CAMERA FOLLOWS as it banks 
      down the side of the building.  


      The chopper zeroes in on room 2342.  It hovers 10 feet from 
      the window.  The curtains are drawn.    


                                  ABBY
                    Dropping in now. 

      Abby turns, raises her crossbow.  Fires straight at the LENS.  
      PHHHHHT!  A bolt with a cable attached embeds in the fire 
      escape door.  She clamps the cable to her harness, sprints 
      forward and basejumps off the building.  

      MULTISCREEN ENDS.                                                                               10.



      The sleepy storefronts are shuttered.  The Porsche sweeps 
      around the corner.  Its headlights momentarily illuminate 

      A HISPANIC WOMAN

      sitting in a sage Jeep parked in the shadows.  She s 28, with 
      intense eyes and the taut body of a Marine.  She ducks as the 
      Porsche pulls up in front of the florist,  SENOR FLOWER .                                                                               15.



      Kate stands by the Porsche, watching Gloria head up the 
      stairs to the apartment above the store.  She sees Gloria s 
      purse on the back seat.  She grabs it, crosses to the stairs 
      just as Gloria steps inside.

                                  KATE
                    Hey, G, you forgot your--

          KAAAAABOOOOOOOOOOOM!  A DEAFENING EXPLOSION rips through the 
      apartment.  A torrent of fire, glass and splintered wood 
      rains.  The concussive force of the blast launches Kate off 
      her feet.  Abby leaps out, frantic.

                                  ABBY
                    GLORIA!  GLORIA! 

      She races to help Kate, who is dazed but alive.  The women 
      stare at the apartment, angry flames lick the darkness.  No 
      way Gloria could have made it.  OFF their utter despair...

                                                                          FADE OUT.

                                            ACT TWO

      FADE IN:


      A Banyan tree stands guard in front of this Deco monolith.  


      A hip breakfast CROWD packs the  Il Cielo  restaurant, which 
      occupies the Art Deco gem s ground floor.  Abby and Kate 
      enter the Tiffany blue door on the side.   The Townsend 
      Agency  is engraved on a polished brass plaque on the front. 


      It s got a nosebleed view of Miami s skyline.  CAMERA CRANES 
      PAST the forest of boat masts TO FIND Abby and Kate.   

                                  KATE
                    Bosley said it s a houseboat.  Slip 
                    876.

                                  ABBY
                          (charging forward)
                    Come on, let s teach this chick the 
                    meaning of shock and awe. 

                                  KATE
                    Whoa, tiger, slow down.  There s a 
                    reason they don t let cops 
                      investigate a partner s death.

                                  ABBY
                    Before you play amateur shrink, you 
                    should know I ve dueled with the 
                    best Park Avenue has to offer.                                                                                23.


                                  KATE
                    You re too emotionally involved and 
                    so am I.  We play this one by the 
                    book because I don t plan on losing 
                    another friend.

      Abby nods.  Slip 876 is coming up.  It s a boxy houseboat in 
      need of some TLC.  They cautiously approach.  

                                  KATE
                    Take the front, I ll take the back. 

                                  ABBY
                    It s called the bow and stern. 

                                  KATE
                    Glad all those summers in the 
                    Hamptons finally paid off. 

      They share a smile, pull guns and stalk up the gangplank.  
      Once onboard, they split in different directions.   


      The trio charges out the door.  GUNFIRE SPLINTERS across the 
      deck.  Bullet casings PING!  Hanging baskets EXPLODE like 
      pinatas.  Desperate, the women dive off the stern.    


      LOOKING UP as Abby, Kate and Marisa plunge INTO VIEW.  
      BULLETS RAZOR the water, leaving twisting contrails.  The 
      chopper hovers overhead, backlit by the sun.  


      The helicopter hangs 15 feet above the water.  The Gunman 
      doesn t let up until his UZI FINALLY RUNS DRY.  He nods to 
      the PILOT, who banks sharply and powers towards the horizon.  


      The THROB of the chopper FADES.  Abby, Kate and Marisa break 
      the surface, gulping for air.  OFF their narrow escape...  

                                                                          FADE OUT.

                                          ACT THREE

      FADE IN:


      Abby and Kate pull themselves onto the dock, shaken and 
      stirred from their near-death ordeal.  Abby reaches down, 
      helps Marisa out of the water, then swings her against a 
      mooring post and angrily gets in her face.

                                  ABBY
                    Who were those shooters?

                                  MARISA
                    How the hell should I know!? 

                                  KATE
                    Easy, Abbs, let s do this back at 
                    the Agency. 

                                  ABBY
                    No, GI Jane starts filling in the 
                    blanks right now!  Like why she was 
                    in stalker-mode outside Gloria s 
                    apartment last night.
                          (off Marisa s surprise)
                    You were caught on tape fleeing the 
                    scene. 

                                  MARISA
                    And that makes me guilty?  

                                  KATE
                    Given your military background, it 
                    makes you an obvious suspect.

      Marisa wrestles free of Abby, starts down the dock. 

                                  MARISA
                    Gloria was like a sister to me, I m 
                    not playing this game.

                                  KATE
                    Fine.  Take your chances with the 
                    Miami PD.  They get a look at the 
                    shoulder ink, connect you to Gloria 
                    and you ll be in a cell pleading 
                    your case to a public defender. 

      Marisa stops, turns to face them.                                                                              26.


                                  MARISA
                    I got a text from Gloria.  Said it 
                    was urgent.  Asked me to come over.
                          (off Abby s look)
                    Check her phone records if you 
                    don t believe me.  

                                  KATE
                    Did she say what she wanted? 

                                  MARISA
                    Personal case she was working on.  
                    Wanted to show me something.  

      Abby and Kate absorb that revelation.  The sound of 
      approaching SIRENS cuts the moment.  Kate looks at Marisa. 

                                  KATE
                    Deal with them or come with us -- 
                    it s your call.   

      Marisa makes a silent decision and follows as the Angels 
      hustle towards the parking lot.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      The magnificent Spanish Revival estate features ornate 
        wrought-iron detailing and GURGLING fountains.  It s nestled 
      in an exotic oasis of green.  A BUTLER in a sharp Paul Smith 
      suit approaches.  He s 40 and keeps a safe distance.                                                                                30.


                                  BUTLER
                    Telephone call.  It s Mr. Bosley.  


      Bosley waits with a cell phone to his ear, staring out across 
      the glittering sea.  He s backlit by the dying sun. 

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    Sorry to keep you waiting, John.  

                                  BOSLEY
                    No problem, Charlie.  Hope you 
                    didn t get stung.

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    Not once.  Bees are beautiful to 
                    behold, only aggressive when 
                    pushed.  
                          (beat)
                    I assume my INS contact was 
                    helpful?

                                  BOSLEY
                    It s amazing how the head of the 
                    Service can cut through the red 
                    tape.  
                          (beat)
                    Marisa s records are sketchy, but 
                    her story checks out.  She arrived 
                    here with Gloria on amnesty visas 
                    when they were eight.  They lived 
                    with Gloria s uncle until he died.  

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    I never thought I d lose another 
                    angel. 

                                  BOSLEY
                    Blame me.  I m your eyes and ears.  
                    I should have been on top of it.

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    We did this dance once before... 
                    when Elizabeth was killed.  I 
                    wouldn t let you fall on your sword 
                    then either.                                                                                31.


      Bosley smiles sadly.

                                  BOSLEY
                    I ve been thinking about her a lot 
                    today.  

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    My daughter loved you very much.  
                    Never forget that.  But right now, 
                    I need you to stay focused.  We ve 
                    had two attacks in less than 24 
                    hours.  Violent.  Quick.  
                      Overwhelming.

                                  BOSLEY
                    Who do you think we re dealing 
                    with?

                                    CHARLIE (V.O.)
                    Someone with a secret who needs to 
                    protect it at all costs.  Trust me, 
                    John, they re going to regret the 
                    day they ever crossed my path. 
                          (beat)
                    Keep me posted.

      As Bosley hangs up, STAY WITH Charlie.  A mysterious figure, 
      sitting alone, waiting for day to slip into night. 


      A Crown Vic with TWO UNIFORMS is parked in front.  The 
      storefront is boarded up and the second-floor windows are 
      blown out and blackened.  Kate s SUV stops across the street. 


      OVERHEAD SHOT LOOKING DOWN as Abby assesses the narrow side 
      passage between Gloria s apartment and the building next to 
      it.  She hands Kate her backpack.  

                                  ABBY
                    Hold the Prada. 

      She sprints forward and in an incredible Parkour move 
        springboards off the ground, bounce-kicks between the 
      opposing walls until she vaults through the second-floor 
      window and into Gloria s apartment.  It s over in three 
      effortless seconds.  Marisa is speechless.   

                                  KATE
                    Abby put the  cat  in cat burglar. 

      Kate pulls a cable ladder from the backpack.  As she throws 
      one end up to Abby...


      Lightning flickers across the sky.  A storm is rolling in.  
      Abby, Kate and Marisa dart back to the SUV, still reeling 
      from their discovery.  Abby types a web address into her 
      iPhone while Kate turns to Marisa.

                                  KATE
                    How do you know about Pajaro?

                                  MARISA
                    Long story.  But I had no clue 
                    Gloria had tracked him down.                                                                                36.


                                  ABBY
                    Check this out.  It s a real-time 
                    feed from inside Club Cypher.  

      She holds up her phone.  It features random shots of the 
      interior of the club.    

                                  ABBY
                    There s Pajaro.  VIP table with a 
                      nuclear-hot blonde.

      Kate and Marisa study the image.  A STUNNING WOMAN in her 
      late 20s sits at PAJARO S side along with TWO BODYGUARDS.  
      For the record, her name is NADIA IVANOV. 

                                  KATE
                    I ll call Bos, we need to loop in 
                    Charlie.

      But as she pulls out her phone, Marisa reaches across and 
      yanks Kate s gun from its holster.  Abby turns in shock as 
      Marisa levels the weapon at them.  

                                  MARISA
                    Toss your gun in the storm drain.  
                          (off Abby s hesitation)
                    I know how to use this!  

      Abby reluctantly complies, looks at Kate.

                                  ABBY
                    Told you we shouldn t trust her. 

                                  KATE
                          (to Marisa)
                    This is insane.  Don t do this.

                                  MARISA
                    I m keeping a promise I made to 
                    Gloria a long time ago.  

      Marisa yanks the keys from Kate s hand.

                                  MARISA
                    She wanted me to kill Pajaro.  

      Marisa climbs into the SUV.  OFF Kate and Abby watching, 
      helpless, as she STARTS the ENGINE and ROARS into the night.   

                                                                          FADE OUT.

                                      END OF ACT THREE                                                                              37.


                                          ACT FOUR

      FADE IN:

      BEGIN MULTISCREEN: 


      Abby and Kate sprint down the street.  THUNDER booms.  

      Marisa PEELS around a corner, forged with determination.  

      The Angels weave through the CROWD waiting to get into a 
      garish Cuban bar.  Abby  brushes  past A MAN in a purple suit 
      and jacks his valet ticket.  Kate pulls out her phone. 


      The RX-7 skids to a stop behind Kate s SUV that is parked 
      next to a dumpster.  The Angels race out and are drenched in 
      seconds.  They find the SUV is empty.  Kate sees the ladder 
      of a fire escape has been pulled down.   

                                  KATE
                    She s on the roof!


      The neon sign tints the rain phosphorescent green.  Marisa 
      kneels, levels her gun at the entrance to the Club.

      MARISA S POV: A white Escalade stops curbside.  A CHAUFFEUR 
      steps out with a white umbrella and greets Pajaro and Nadia 
      as they exit with the Bodyguards.  

      Marisa s eyes narrow with military certainty.  She takes aim.  
      Rain PINGS off the barrel as her finger tenses on the 
      trigger.  But a millisecond before she fires,   

      A BOOT

      SLAM-KICKS the gun out of her hand.  BOOOM!  The deflected 
      bullet glances the neon marquee.  Marisa spins to find

      KATE AND ABBY.                                                                              39.


      She launches herself at the Angels.  Silhouetted against the 
      neon and the rain, the trio trades an awesome variety of 
      kicks and punches.  Finally spent, Marisa drops to her knees 
      and begins to cry.  Exhausted, Kate and Abby regard her, 
      unsure.  Then Kate steps forward and offers Marisa her hand.  

                                  KATE
                    Let s get out of the storm. 

      Marisa nods, grateful.  GO WIDE as Kate helps her up.  


      After closing.  Abby, Kate and Marisa are wrapped up, basking 
      in the glow of a fire pit.  Bosley approaches.   

                                  BOSLEY
                    His name s Nicholas Rodrigo.  The 
                    prints on that shot glass are his.  
                    He s a multimillionaire developer 
                    and one of the biggest 
                      philanthropists in the city.  

      He SLAPS down  Miami Magazine .  Rodrigo s on the cover, 
      standing in front of a cool Palm Island mega-mansion.  

                                  BOSLEY
                    His foundation builds orphanages in 
                    Central America.

      Marisa stares at Rodrigo s face, haunted by memories.   

                                  MARISA
                    Whatever that SOB s name is, he s a 
                    mass murderer.  

                                  KATE
                    Okay, no more secrets.  It s time 
                    to come clean.  

      Marisa touches the gold cross that hangs around her neck. 

                                  MARISA
                    Before Rodrigo was on magazine 
                    covers, he was the leader of a 
                    death squad in El Salvador.  They 
                    always wore masks and only attacked 
                    at night.  The locals called him 
                    Pajaro because he was like a bird 
                    that could never be caught.

                                  ABBY
                    If Rodrigo wore a mask, how can you 
                    be sure he s Pajaro?                                                                              40.


                                  MARISA
                    I guess I have an angel to thank 
                    for that. 

      She nervously reaches for the cross again.  GO TIGHT as it is 
      clenched by a child s hand.  REVEAL we have TRANSITIONED TO: 

        A SUPERSATURATED FLASHBACK.  

      The same necklace is worn by YOUNG MARISA.  YOUNG GLORIA is 
      at her side, clutching her butterfly box.  They re 8, in 
        nightdresses and bare feet.  They creep up the aisle of...   


      The leader (Pajaro) watches as his men round up the ORPHANS.  
      The girls are loaded into the trucks while the BOYS and NUNS 
      are lined up.  Pajaro nods and his men level their machine 
      guns at the cowering line of boys and women.  As they FIRE...


      Fingers of moonlight filter through the trees and illuminate 
      the girls as they run for their lives, never looking back.

      Young Marisa reaches for the cross that bounces against her 
      neck.  GO TIGHT as an adult hand grasps it.  REVEAL that the 
      FLASHBACK HAS ENDED and we have TRANSITIONED BACK TO:


      Marisa touches the golden keepsake.  

                                  MARISA
                    Gloria and I made a pact that if we 
                    saw Pajaro again, we d kill him.     

                                  KATE
                    My guess is she texted you the 
                    other night because she finally had 
                    the proof to make good on that 
                    promise.

                                  ABBY
                    Hold on!  The Gloria I knew would 
                    never murder anyone. 

                                  MARISA
                    That s why she didn t tell you, she 
                    knew you wouldn t approve. 

                                  KATE
                    Damn right we don t approve.                                                                               42.


                                  MARISA
                    You don t know what this bastard 
                    did with the girls he took.   

                                  KATE
                    Actually, we ve got a pretty good 
                    idea because he s still doing it -- 
                    he was behind a case we just broke 
                    with a 16-year-old runaway.  

                                  MARISA
                    Explains how Gloria got on his 
                    trail.  

                                  KATE
                    Rodrigo must have figured out who 
                    she was, tracked her and discovered 
                    you were still in the picture too. 

                                  BOSLEY
                    The hunter becomes the hunted. 

      Marisa nods, wrestling with the grim truth. 

                                  MARISA
                    He takes us out and his secret s 
                    safe.   

                                  KATE
                    Listen, we re going to get justice 
                    for Gloria and nail this guy -- but 
                    that doesn t involve blowing him 
                    away on Ocean Drive.   

                                  MARISA
                    I saw his face and freaked, okay?  
                    Won t happen again. 

                                  ABBY
                    You re right.  It won t.  We ve 
                    been on the wrong end of your gun 
                    twice.  It s not happening a third 
                    time.  You re benched. 

                                  MARISA
                            (frustrated)
                    Rodrigo s been giving law 
                      enforcement the middle finger for 
                    years.  How you gonna bust him?

                                  KATE
                    We don t exactly play by the rules 
                    either.                                                                                43.


                                  ABBY
                    Yeah -- we re Angels, not saints. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      A FIRE EATER in a white top hat and tails spits a fireball 
      right at the LENS.  CAMERA BURSTS through the sparks TO 
      REVEAL the fund-raiser in full swing.  The theme is 

      HEAVEN AND HELL.

      The GUESTS are dressed in white.  Dry ice wafts across the 
      grass like a cloud.  STILT WALKERS roam, throwing silver 
      confetti.  It s a glamorous exercise in excess.  

      ABBY, KATE AND MARISA

      emerge through a curtain of mist.  They re undercover as 
      servers and are carrying platters of hors d oeuvres.  Each is 
      dressed in the coolest, reddest, sexiest devil outfit.   

                                  KATE
                          (into earwig)
                    Bos, are you set?

      In a white Tom Ford suit, Bosley stands by the bar.  

                                  BOSLEY
                          (into earwig)
                    Truck s in position in the back by 
                    the bathrooms.  Once the spray hits 
                    Ivanov s stomach, she ll start 
                    cramping in 30 seconds.    

                                  KATE
                    Marisa, tell us when you ve got a 
                    20 on Rodrigo. 

      Marisa spots Rodrigo schmoozing in a special VIP area.  

                                  MARISA
                          (into earwig)
                    He s trading high-fives with LeBron 
                    James.  

                                  KATE
                    Good.  Stay on him.  Let us know if 
                    he moves. 

      Kate spots Ivanov.  She s standing in the shadow of a giant 
      ice angel, sipping a flute of Veuve Clicquot.  

                                  KATE
                    Abbs, you want to take the first 
                    shot at Ivanov?  She s by the ice 
                      sculpture.                                                                               47.


                                  ABBY
                    Can hardly tell the two apart. 

      Abby surreptitiously pulls a pump dispenser and sprays her 
      platter of blinis and caviar.  She approaches Ivanov. 

                                  ABBY
                    Blini?  

      Ivanov doesn t even make eye contact, waves her off. 

                                  ABBY
                    Caviar s the real deal, flown in 
                    from the Caspian Sea this morning.

      Ivanov sniffs the black eggs on a blini, scoffs... 

                                  IVANOV
                    More like a fish farm outside of 
                    Moscow.  Shoo. 

      Her accent is muted.  Shot down, Abby turns away. 

                                  ABBY
                          (into earwig)
                    Wow... if she were any colder, I d 
                    get frost bite.  

                                  FEMALE (O.S.)
                    Abby Sampson?

      She is startled by BRIDGET and PRISCELLA WENTWORTH.  They re 
      her age and radiate Upper Eastside Bitch. 

                                    BRIDGET
                    Bridget and Priscella?  

                                  PRISCELLA
                    Dalton Prep?  

      Abby squirms, clearly rattled by this unforeseen reunion.  

                                  ABBY
                    The Wentworth twins.  Sure.  Hi.  
                    It s been forever. 

                                  PRISCELLA 
                    Cute outfit.  Are you one of the 
                    servers?   

                                  ABBY
                    Yeah, recession s a bitch. 

      Bridget s facade of friendliness drops.                                                                               48.


                                    BRIDGET
                      Considering what your father did, 
                    I d call it payback.  Do you know 
                    how much money he screwed our uncle 
                    out of?

                                  ABBY
                    No idea.  I haven t spoken to my 
                    dad in years.   

      Priscella snaps a cell phone photo of Abby. 

                                  PRISCELLA
                    For my Facebook page.  I m sure all 
                    your old Dalton friends would love 
                    to know how you re doing.  

      Abby hides her humiliation with a forced smile.   

                                  ABBY
                    It s been a blast catching up.  I 
                    need to get back to work. 
                          (offering tray)
                    Blini?

      Both take one and head away.  Abby s shoulders sag, she dumps 
      the rest of the tray in the trash.  Marisa steps over.   

                                  MARISA
                    Nice friends.  You okay?

                                  ABBY
                    I will be in about 30 seconds.  

      They watch as Bridget and Priscella wince, hold their 
      stomachs, obviously cramping, and hurry to the bathrooms.    

                                  ABBY
                    At least we know the gut juice 
                    works. 

                                  MARISA
                    No wonder Gloria liked you.  She 
                    had a twisted sense of humor too.

      Abby offers Marisa a smile, takes one of the bite-sized 
      devil s food cakes from her tray and gobbles it in one.

      Kate is about to move in with her tray of empanadas when she 
      sees Ivanov spurn another SERVER.                                                                                49.

                          (into earwig, frustrated)
                    Food is definitely not the way to 
                    this chick s heart.  It s time for 
                    plan B. 

      CONTINUE MULTISCREEN:

                                  ABBY
                    As in Plan Bosley.

                                  BOSLEY
                    Whoa.  We never talked about Plan 
                    Bosley.

                                  ABBY
                    She didn t take the Beluga; we need 
                    to improvise with different bait.  

                                  KATE
                    We know her deal with Rodrigo s 
                    strictly business.  But Charlie s 
                    intel suggests she s got a healthy 
                    appetite for the opposite sex.  

      Bosley rolls his eyes. 

                                  ABBY
                    Come on, Bos, it ll be a challenge. 
                    Don t you always say there isn t a 
                    hard drive you can t hack into?


      Ivanov stands at the balustrade, looking down on the party.   

                                  BOSLEY
                    987.  That s the number of guests.  

      He steps to her side.  

                                  BOSLEY
                    58 servers.  29 bus boys.  16 
                    valets.  3 stilt walkers.  One very 
                    beautiful woman.

                    What are you; doctor, lawyer, 
                    internet billionaire? 

                                  BOSLEY
                    Starving grad student.  My buddy s 
                    one of the caterers.  I tagged 
                    along for the free food and to 
                    watch the rich and famous in their 
                    natural habitat. 

                                  IVANOV
                    What do you think of the wildlife 
                    so far?

                                  BOSLEY
                    It just got more interesting.  

                                  IVANOV
                          (seductive)
                    Let s take a walk. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Bosley and Ivanov SLAM into the FRAME.  Making out hot and 
      very heavy.  Her hands are all over him.    


      Marisa sees Rodrigo head out of the VIP pen.  

                                  MARISA
                          (into earwig)
                    Rodrigo s on the move.  Could be 
                    looking for Ivanov. 

      Kate reacts to the news with renewed urgency. 

                                  KATE
                          (into earwig)
                    Bos, time to put your party on 
                    wheels.  Get her to the catering 
                    truck.  I ll meet you there. 


      Bosley breaks off.  Brushes his hand down Ivanov s cheek. 

                                  BOSLEY
                    Why don t we find a place with a 
                    little more privacy?                                                                               51.


                                  IVANOV
                    The guesthouse is on the other side 
                    of the compound. 

                                  BOSLEY
                    My pal s catering truck is closer.  

                                  IVANOV
                    Down and dirty.  Is that your 
                    style?

                                  BOSLEY
                    Just a guy looking for a good time.

      Without warning, she suddenly grabs his crotch and squeezes 
      like a vice.  She leans in and viciously hisses...

                                  IVANOV
                    You ve got five seconds to tell me 
                    who you really are?

                                  BOSLEY
                          (groaning)
                    Look... um...

                                  IVANOV
                    Four.  Three.  Two. 

      WHHAAACK!  Ivanov releases her grip of Bosley s nuts and 
      sinks to the ground, unconscious, revealing Kate.  

                                  KATE
                    Nice job, Casanova. 

      Bosley winces, clearly in agony.  

                                  KATE
                    You can ice your jewels in the 
                    truck. 

      He helps her lift Ivanov.  They put her arms around their 
      shoulders, it looks like they re helping a drunk.  

                                  KATE
                          (into earwig)
                    Abby, Marisa -- we ve got Ivanov.  
                    Time to fly. 


      Still holding her tray of chocolate treats, Marisa turns to 
      exit but knocks straight into Rodrigo.  The mini-cakes 
      cascade down his spotless white suit.  The party stops and 
      all eyes turn.  Rodrigo looks at his ruined suit, grins.                                                                               52.


                                    RODRIGO
                    I knew the devil would get me 
                      eventually. 

      Everybody LAUGHS and gets back to it.  Marisa bows her head.    

                                    RODRIGO
                    It was my fault.  I ran into you.  

      She nods.  He lifts her chin with his finger.  

                                    RODRIGO
                    You okay?  I m not going to bite.

      She looks into his face, trying to contain her fury.  Without 
      a word, she finally heads away.  He watches her, his face 
      flickering with unease. 


      Marisa hustles around the side of the house.  But as she 
      passes the doors of Rodrigo s office, she sees something 
      hanging on the wall that stops her in her tracks.   

                                  MARISA
                          (into earwig)
                    Delayed.  Don t wait.  


      A gator grins on the sign of this abandoned tourist 
      attraction.  A minivan ambles up.  The GATE GUARD steps over 
      and finds Bosley and Kate, dressed like Ohio tourists.   

                                  BOSLEY
                    Hiya, we re a little lost.  

                                  GATE GUARD
                    This is private property.  Park s 
                    been closed for years.  

      Kate points to the sign, swats Bosley. 

                                  KATE
                    This is Gatorland!  We re looking 
                    for GatorWorld.  I told you it was 
                    a left off that highway.   

      As they talk, PAN DOWN TO REVEAL Abby clinging to the 
      undercarriage of the minivan.  She drops and rolls...

                                  BOSLEY
                    Don t start with me, Charlene. 

                                  KATE
                    Wasn t my idea to get up at the 
                      butt-crack of dawn and look at a 
                    bunch of stinking alligators. 

                                  GATE GUARD
                    Folks, you need to leave right now!

      Suddenly, he hears a WHISTLE.  He looks down and finds Abby 
      on the ground with a gun pointed straight at him.                                                                                57.


                                  ABBY
                    Actually, we re going to take a 
                    tour.  Piggly wiggles where I can 
                    see them. 


      The collection of rusty corrugated metal buildings and sad 
      concrete enclosures sits waterside.  A couple of airboats are 
      moored at the end of a dilapidated jetty and the helicopter 
      that attacked Marisa s boat bakes in the sun near    

      AN OLD SCHOOL BUS.

      It s been painted puke-green, and the park s reptilian mascot 
      is painted on its sides.  CRANE DOWN TO Abby, Kate and Bosley 
      peeking out a window. 


      The two Guards watching the caged teens turn as 

      THE MINIVAN 

      careens INTO VIEW, its windows down and RADIO ON FULL BLAST.  
      The vehicle passes the helicopter and SMASHES full force into 
      a concrete picnic table.  Its wheels spin uselessly.   

                                    RODRIGO (V.O.)
                          (over radio, in Spanish)
                    What the hell s going on? 

                                  CAGE GUARD #2
                          (into radio, in Spanish)
                    Checking it out now. 

      The Cage Guards cautiously approach with Uzis ready.  They 
      find the Gate Guard slumped in the driver s seat.  His hands 
      are zip-cuffed to the wheel and the gas pedal is anchored to 
      the floor.  When they pull his head up, the word 

      BOOM!

      stares back from the tape that gags the Gate Guard s mouth.  
      As the Cage Guards look at each other in horror... 


      The helicopter 15 feet behind the minivan EXPLODES.                                                                              59.


                  KABOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM! 

      The Cage Guards standing by the minivan are flyswatted 
      against the alligator shed, out for the count, as a fireball 
      and debris rocket sky-high.   

      BEGIN CLIMACTIC MULTISCREEN:


      Abby and Kate swing down from the tin roof of the wild cat 
      enclosure.  The grateful teens look on as Abby expertly 
      begins picking the cage s lock.    

      Bosley REVS the bus to life and ROARS forward. 

      Rodrigo freaks out, spins to his Bodyguard.

                                    RODRIGO
                          (re: Marisa, in Spanish)
                    Kill her! 

      He races out the door, brandishing an Uzi.  The Bodyguard 
      raises his Glock to kill Marisa when she jerks up her legs 
      and wraps his neck in a sleeper hold.  As they struggle...  

      Bosley pulls up to the wild cat cages and concertinas open 
      the door.  Kate hustles the liberated teens into the bus 
      while Abby takes off for the alligator shed.  

      Rodrigo races past the burning carcass of the helicopter 
      headed for his Escalade, but stops when he sees one of the 
      chopper s rotors embedded in the front of the vehicle.  

      Marisa vices the Bodyguard s neck but he breaks away and 
      swings up his gun.  Abby appears behind him, kicks the weapon 
      free, plucks it out of the air, then pistol whips him.  As he 
      drops, Marisa smiles with relief.  Abby shrugs, modestly. 

                                  ABBY 
                    Little trick I learned from a 
                    friend. 

      She helps Marisa down.

      Rodrigo races back, sees the last of the teens climbing into 
      the bus.  Furious, he OPENS FIRE!

      Kate, Bosley and the teens hit the deck as the bus is riddled 
      with DEAFENING lines of BULLETS.  When the onslaught finally 
      ends, Kate sees Rodrigo climb into a fan boat.  He takes off 
      just as Abby and Marisa head out of the alligator shed.                                                                               60.


                                  KATE
                    Bos, stay with the girls.  Call Ray 
                    at Miami PD.    

      She charges off to join Abby and Marisa.

      END MULTISCREEN.  


      EPIC HELICOPTER SHOT FINDS Abby, Kate and Marisa on an 
      airboat powering down a sun-burnished waterway, wind whipping 
      their hair.  The boat shoots around a bend. 

      RODRIGO S BOAT

      is up ahead.  Abby GUNS the ENGINE while Kate takes aim.    


      THWAACK!  A bullet hits the giant fan, causing it to SPUTTER, 
      smoke and stop.  Rodrigo sees the women speeding towards him.  
      He pulls a semiautomatic, OPENS FIRE as they approach.  With 
      fearless disregard for her life, 

      MARISA

      leaps across the water, roll-dives onto Rodrigo s deck and 
      kicks the weapon out of his hand.  She follows through with a 
      stinging right hook and sweeps up her gun as he reels back.  
      He dabs the blood that trickles from his cut lip, smirks.  

                                    RODRIGO
                    Go on.  Pull the trigger.  Get your 
                    revenge.  

      Abby and Kate jump onboard.  Marisa s finger tenses on the 
      trigger.  She s torn with emotion.  The Angels plead...

                                  KATE
                    I know you and Gloria made a pact.  
                    But this isn t the way to honor her 
                    memory.  

                                  ABBY
                    Don t give this bastard the easy 
                    way out.

      Tears sting Marisa s eyes.  It s the hardest choice she s 
      ever had to make.  She drills him with a look.  

                                  MARISA
                          (Spanish with subtitles)
                    A bird in a cage dies slowly.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                              61.

                                  MARISA (CONT'D)
                          (in English)
                    That s what you deserve, Pajaro.

      With swift certainty, she pivot-kicks him in the head.  He 
      flies back into the fan s metal cage and is knocked out.  
      Abby and Kate step to Marisa and the three women embrace.  
      CRANE UP and UP until only blue sky FILLS THE FRAME...  

      PAN DOWN TO:


      SUPER WIDE SHOT.  The sawtooth outline of downtown shimmers.  
      The vessel is a bullet-pocked ruin.  Marisa is sorting 
      through the debris when Bosley climbs aboard.   

                                  BOSLEY
                    Charlie told me he called you.  I 
                    came by to see if you ve considered 
                    his offer?

                                  MARISA
                    Not sure why he d want me.  

                                  BOSLEY
                    He keeps his criteria close to the 
                    vest.  But it s usually a mix of 
                    skill sets, life experience, and 
                    the fact that your employment 
                    options are limited. 

                                  MARISA
                    Is that how he got you?

                                  BOSLEY
                    I was staring at a 20-year sentence 
                    for tax fraud.  
                          (off her surprise)
                    I planted a virus in the IRS 
                      mainframe, it skimmed a penny off 
                      everybody s tax return.  It was my 
                    own personal stimulus package. 

      Marisa smiles, amused. 

                                  MARISA
                    I m not that desperate, and working 
                    for a voice on a phone isn t my 
                    style.  

                                  BOSLEY
                    First rule of the Townsend Agency -- 
                    zero face time with the boss.                                                                               62.


                                  MARISA
                    I d settle for Skype.   

                                  BOSLEY
                    Charlie s a very private person.  
                    But I promise he ll never order you 
                    to shoot a 14-year-old girl.

      The remark catches her off-guard. 

                                  MARISA
                    My military files are sealed. 

                                  BOSLEY
                    I ve got  mad hacking skills ,  
                    remember? 
                          (beat)
                    Court Martial Tribunal ruled that 
                    if you d fired when ordered, three 
                    soldiers in your squad would still 
                    be alive.  

      Marisa hesitates, bitter memories swirling.

                                  MARISA
                    I studied suicide bombers -- that 
                    girl didn t fit the profile.  With 
                    that one decision... my career was 
                    roadkill.     

                                  BOSLEY
                    Look at this as your second chance.  

      She s still skeptical. 

                                  BOSLEY
                    You know why Charlie calls the 
                    women who work for him Angels?
                          (off her shrug)
                    Because they show up when you least 
                    expect it but when you need them 
                    the most. 

      Bosley s cell phone suddenly RINGS.   

                                  BOSLEY
                          (re: cell)
                    It s Charlie.  Take my advice -- 
                    answer the call.

      He offers her the phone.  Marisa hesitates, then takes the 
      phone.  As she hits accept...

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                              63.



      HELICOPTER SHOT FINDS a  76 baby-blue Mercedes.  The top s 
      down and Abby, Kate and Marisa are dressed to party.  They re 
      rocking out to an insanely INFECTIOUS SONG -- new friends 
      ready for a new beginning.  One by one, the MULTISCREENS 
      SLIDE AWAY, leaving A SIMPLE BLACK FRAME and we... 

                                                                          FADE OUT.
