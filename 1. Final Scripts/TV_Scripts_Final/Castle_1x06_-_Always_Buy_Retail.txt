      A large red cloth... Red liquid sitting in a small glass 
      bowl... Tight on a flame atop a small white candle... The 
      candle is held in a MAN's hand... its wax has melted over it.

      PULL BACK to reveal his face partially illuminated by the 
      flickering candlelight... His open, sightless eyes tell us 
      he's dead.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. CASTLE'S LOFT, BEDROOM - MORNING22

      Two intertwined bodies roll around in bed. Bare limbs and 
      backs are exposed amidst the twisted sheets.

      Suddenly, they disappear over the edge of the bed. THUMP! A 
      beat. Heavy breathing. And then Castle s head pops up from 
      behind the bed.

                                  CASTLE
                    That was...

      And then a WOMAN s head pops up beside him. This is MEREDITH, 
      late-30s, beautiful, and out of breath.

                                  MEREDITH
                    Oh yeah. Top ten, at least.

                                  CASTLE
                    More like top twenty.

                                  MEREDITH
                    Not top ten?

      Castle shakes his head, and counts off.

                                  CASTLE
                    Paris. Kauai. Yankee Stadium.

                                  MEREDITH
                    That place in the Poconos.

                                  CASTLE
                    Mykonos. Coney Island. Staten 
                    Island.

                                  MEREDITH
                          (remembering)
                    Mmmmm. Staten Island. Oh, and the 
                    hot air balloon.      CASTLE Ep. 107 "Always Buy Retail" Full White Draft 1-14-09  2.


                                  CASTLE
                    The Westminster Dog Show?

                                  MEREDITH
                    That s only nine.

                                  CASTLE
                    And the night we made Alexis.

                                  MEREDITH
                    Yeah. That was a good night.

      Meredith smiles, leans in, and gives him a kiss.

                                  MEREDITH (CONT D)
                    We have had fun, haven t we? Makes 
                    you wonder why we ever got 
                    divorced.

                                  CASTLE
                    I know, right? I mean, other than 
                    the whole having an affair with 
                    your director, moving to Malibu, 
                    and serving me with divorce papers, 
                    we really had a chance.

                                  MEREDITH
                          (blurts out)
                    I m moving back.

                                  CASTLE
                    Back?

      She nods.

                                  CASTLE (CONT D)
                    To New York?

                                  MEREDITH
                    I miss it. I miss Alexis. I miss you.

                                  CASTLE
                    What about your career?

                                  MEREDITH
                    LA s changed. The juicy roles just 
                    aren t there for an actress of my 
                    caliber. I need a change. Like 
                    Broadway maybe. The legitimate 
                    stage.

                                  CASTLE
                    Whoa. Time-out. Move back? Have you 
                    really thought this through?      CASTLE Ep. 107 "Always Buy Retail" Full White Draft 1-14-09  3.


                                  MEREDITH
                    What s to think about? You, me, 
                    Alexis, all living in the same city. 
                    It s gonna be just like old times...

      She starts kissing her way down his body. He tenses up. And 
      the look in his eye is not lust. It s fear.

      CASTLE TITLE CARD

      INT. ABANDONED BUILDING, COURTYARD - DAY33

      ESPOSITO squats over the dead man from our opening montage. 
      The victim s on his back, laid out on a LARGE SQUARE OF RED 
      FLANNEL. The burned-down WHITE CANDLE is still clutched in 
      his left hand. A GLASS BOWL OF BLOOD is positioned by his 
      head. 

                                  ESPOSITO
                    Vic s an African-American male, 
                      early-20s. Multiple stab wounds. No 
                    ID. Body was discovered by a 
                    homeless guy.

      BECKETT looks down at the bruises on his body, as Castle and 
      RYAN stand behind her.

                                    BECKETT
                    He was beaten, maybe even 
                      tortured... 

                                  RYAN
                    Looks like some kinda ritualistic 
                    killing.

                                    BECKETT
                    What gave you that idea? The red 
                    flannel, the candle, or the bowl of 
                    blood?

      She looks at Castle. She notices he seems a little lost.

                                    BECKETT (CONT D)
                    Castle?

      He snaps out of it.

                                  CASTLE
                    What?

                                    BECKETT
                    You okay?      CASTLE Ep. 107 "Always Buy Retail" Full White Draft 1-14-09  4.


                                  CASTLE
                    I had sex with my ex-wife this 
                    morning. 

      The three of them all just look up at him. He continues as if 
      they wanted clarification... 

                                  CASTLE (CONT D)
                    My first ex-wife, Meredith. 
                    Alexis s mom. 

      ...which they didn t.

                                  CASTLE (CONT D)
                    She wants to move back to New York. 
                    Do you know what that means? It 
                    means a very special kind of hell. 
                    The hell of a deep-fried Twinkie.

                                  RYAN
                      A deep-fried Twinkie?

                                    BECKETT
                    Castle...

                                  CASTLE
                    That guilty pleasure that you know is 
                    bad for you, so you only do it once, 
                    maybe twice a year as a novelty. But 
                      a deep-fried Twinkie everyday? 

      He shudders.

                                    BECKETT
                    Castle!

                                  CASTLE
                    What?

                                    BECKETT
                    Crime scene. Dead body. A little 
                    respect.

                                  CASTLE
                    I don t think he can hear me.

                                    BECKETT
                    Okay, then. How about a little self-
                    respect?

                                  CASTLE
                    Fine.

      Castle glances over the scene.      CASTLE Ep. 107 "Always Buy Retail" Full White Draft 1-14-09  5.


                                  CASTLE (CONT D)
                    Check his mouth. There s probably a 
                    small pouch inside.

      Esposito gently opens the man s mouth with gloved hands. 
      Using a pen, he draws out a small WHITE FABRIC BUNDLE.

                                    BECKETT
                    How did you know?

      Castle kneels down, now engaged in the crime scene.

                                  CASTLE
                    Open it.

      Holding it gingerly in his palm, Esposito opens it to reveal 
      an ODD-LOOKING SILVER CHARM. There is a MYSTERIOUS SYMBOL 
      drawn in red ink on the fabric of the bundle itself.

                                  ESPOSITO
                    What does it mean?

                                  CASTLE
                    It s Vodun.

                                  ESPOSITO
                    Vodun? That some kind of Star Trek 
                    thing?

                                  RYAN
                    Dude, it s a religion. Practiced 
                    primarily in West Africa.
                          (off his look)
                    What? I read too.

                                  CASTLE
                    The blood in the bowl is most 
                    likely animal blood. Part of the 
                    ceremony. The pouch is an offering 
                    to the spirits. But I don t 
                    recognize the symbol.

                                  ESPOSITO
                    If you did, you d be a suspect. How 
                    do you know about all this?

                                  CASTLE
                    Research for my sixth Derrick Storm 
                    novel, Unholy Storm. Vodun s not 
                    just limited to West Africa. It s 
                    also practiced in the Haitian and 
                    Dominican communities right here in 
                    New York.      CASTLE Ep. 107 "Always Buy Retail" Full White Draft 1-14-09  6.


                                    BECKETT
                    Have CSU run the pouch, have the 
                    M.E. test the blood, and get his 
                    prints in the system and see if we 
                    can get an ID. 
                          (beat)
                    Castle... This ritual - I assume it 
                    was performed for a very specific 
                    purpose.

                                  ESPOSITO
                    Only if you re assuming the guy 
                    doing it was rational.

                                  CASTLE
                    No. She s right. It may not make 
                    sense to you or me, but if we find 
                    out why he did this, we might find 
                    the killer.

                                  ESPOSITO
                          ( duh )
                    Yeah, that s kinda how we do it.

                                    BECKETT
                    This research of yours? You still 
                    have it?

                                  CASTLE
                    As a matter of fact, I do.

      INT. CASTLE S LOFT, CASTLE S OFFICE - DAY44

      We PAN ACROSS Castle s extensive collection of books and 
        memorabilia. 

                                  CASTLE (O.S.)
                    The purpose of their rituals was to 
                    make contact with the spirits and 
                    the spirit world. To gain their 
                    favor through sacrifice.

      We PULL BACK to reveal:

      Castle is sitting at his desk, reading from a book. An 
      academic textbook on Vodun perhaps? Then...      CASTLE Ep. 107 "Always Buy Retail" Full White Draft 1-14-09  7.


                                  CASTLE (CONT D)
                    Storm was pretty sure he d 
                    sacrifice just about anything when 
                    he saw the amulet swaying 
                      rhythmically back and forth between 
                    the woman s bare, glistening 
                    breasts.

      We PULL BACK to reveal the cover of the book:

                                    BECKETT
                    Unholy Storm? You dragged me here so 
                    you could read from your own book? 

                                  CASTLE
                    There s a lot of good stuff in 
                    here, and some of it is factual.

      Beckett shakes her head.

                                  CASTLE (CONT D)
                    Where are you going?

                                    BECKETT
                    I have a murder to solve.

                                  CASTLE
                    That s what we re doing.

      She heads toward the door.

                                  CASTLE (CONT D)
                    C mon, I was kidding. I have 
                    another source.

                                    BECKETT
                    And you call your ex-wife the deep-
                    fried Twinkie.

                                  CASTLE
                    Trust me. As annoying and intrusive 
                    as you think I am, she s a million 
                    times worse.

                                    BECKETT
                    What about Alexis? Maybe she misses 
                    her mom. Maybe having her in town 
                    would be a good thing.

                                  CASTLE
                    Yeah, right. Once, when Alexis was 
                    nine, Meredith stopped by to take 
                    her to lunch.      CASTLE Ep. 107 "Always Buy Retail" Full White Draft 1-14-09  8.


                                    BECKETT
                    So?

                                  CASTLE
                    In Paris. Paris! And then she acted 
                    like there was nothing wrong with 
                    it. She s like Auntie Mame on meth.

      Beckett lands at the front door.

                                    BECKETT
                    If she s so bad, why d you sleep 
                    with her this morning?

                                  CASTLE
                    Here s the thing about crazy 
                    people. The sex is unbelievable.

                                    BECKETT
                    How shallow are you?

                                  CASTLE
                    Very.

                                    BECKETT
                    I don t have time for this.

      She opens the door. Standing there is MICHELLE - attractive, 
      early-30s, African-American - holding a food delivery bag with 
      a grin.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Someone order lunch?

                                  CASTLE
                          (to Beckett)
                      Detective, meet my other source.

                                                                      TIME CUT TO:

      INT. CASTLE S LOFT, KITCHEN - DAY55

      Castle and Beckett sit at the kitchen table with Michelle. 
      They re all eating from large bowls of stew. Michelle studies 
      a PHOTO of the symbol and charm from the crime scene.

                                  MICHELLE
                    The symbol is a  Vever,  a 
                      representation of the one who can 
                    open the crossroads to the spirit 
                    world.       CASTLE Ep. 107 "Always Buy Retail" Full White Draft 1-14-09  9.


                                  CASTLE
                          (to Beckett)
                    Michelle taught me everything I 
                    know about Vodun. 

                                  MICHELLE
                    Which obviously isn t much. That 
                    scene with the topless girl and the 
                    chicken blood? What was that?

                                  CASTLE
                    So I took a few liberties.

      Michelle looks back at the photo.

                                  MICHELLE
                    From the design, I d say you re not 
                    looking at Haitian, Jamaican, or 
                      Dominican. This is hardcore Nigerian.

                                    BECKETT
                    What about the charm?

                                  MICHELLE
                    The charm s an offering to a Vodun 
                    saint, or Loa, in this case Ogun. 
                    He s usually called upon to help 
                    find something that s been lost.

                                  CASTLE
                    So our killer s looking for 
                      something. 

                                  MICHELLE
                          (nods)
                    Something the victim once 
                      possessed.

                                    BECKETT
                    Maybe that s why he was tortured. 
                    Could the kind of ceremony indicate 
                    what the killer s looking for?

                                  MICHELLE
                      Unfortunately, no. 

                                    BECKETT
                    How do you know all this?

                                  MICHELLE
                    Because I practice.

                                    BECKETT
                    You practice Vodun?      CASTLE Ep. 107 "Always Buy Retail" Full White Draft 1-14-09  10.


                                  MICHELLE
                    I spent my junior year abroad in 
                    Nigeria. Fell in love with the 
                    religion and the cuisine.

                                  CASTLE
                    Michelle owns the best Nigerian 
                      restaurant in the city.

                                    BECKETT
                    Funny, I wouldn t have pegged you 
                    as the occult type.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Occult is in the eye of the beholder, 
                      Detective. As bizarre as Vodun might 
                    seem to you, I assure you, the 
                    beliefs of Western religions seem 
                    just as strange to outsiders.
                          (beat)
                    How do you like the Cow s Foot Stew?

                                    BECKETT
                    Cow s Foot? 
                          (to Castle)
                    You said it was beef.

                                  CASTLE
                      Technically, a cow is beef.

      She grimaces, then turns to Michelle.

                                    BECKETT
                    So the murder, was that part of the 
                    ceremony?

                                  MICHELLE
                    No. Vodun is a peaceful, deeply-
                    spiritual religion practiced by 
                    millions of people across the world 
                    everyday.

      Beckett shows her another picture of the crime scene.

                                    BECKETT
                    I doubt whoever did this was 
                    peaceful.

                                  MICHELLE
                    No. But there are extremists in 
                    every religion. Your killer may be 
                    Vodun, but that s not why this 
                    man s dead.

                                  MICHELLE (CONT'D)
                    He was killed because he had 
                    something your killer desperately 
                    wants. And he s not going to stop 
                    until he finds it.

      Beckett s phone rings...

      Ryan on the phone. UNIFORMED COPS and CSUs mill about. The 
      room s a wreck. Tables turned over, lamps broken, and a 
      CHANEL PURSE, its lining ripped out, lying on the floor. 

                                  RYAN
                    Yeah. It s Ryan. We got another one.

      INT. UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT - DAY77

      Castle and Beckett move past UNIFORMS at the door and into 
      the apartment s hallway. 

                                    BECKETT
                    Cow s Foot Stew?

                                  CASTLE
                    You liked it.

                                    BECKETT
                    That was before I knew what it was.

                                  CASTLE
                    If I d told you, would you have 
                    tried it?

                                    BECKETT
                    No.

                                  CASTLE
                    See? I did you a favor.

      As they enter the living room, we see it s been trashed. Ryan 
      and Esposito are with the victim.

                                  RYAN
                    Victim s name s Darcy Cho. Second 
                    year lawyer at a firm downtown. 

                                  ESPOSITO
                    Multiple stab wounds. Just like our 
                    last guy.

                                  RYAN
                    Neighbor saw her door open and called 
                    the super. This is what he found.

      Beckett looks at the victim on the red flannel cloth.

                                  CASTLE
                    The staging is exactly the same.

      Esposito nods to some PLAINCLOTHES across the room. 

                                  ESPOSITO
                    Yeah. When they saw what they had, 
                    the Westside boys gave us a call.      CASTLE Ep. 107 "Always Buy Retail" Full White Draft 1-14-09  13.


                                    BECKETT
                    Looks like she put up a fight. 
                    Defensive wounds on her forearms. 

                                  ESPOSITO
                    All the same paraphernalia as the 
                    other murder. 

      He holds up an evidence bag containing a pouch and charm.

                                  ESPOSITO (CONT D)
                    Found another charm in her mouth.

                                    BECKETT
                    Anything from CSU on the first 
                    scene?

                                  RYAN
                    Candle s basic paraffin, available 
                    at any bodega. Figure it s gonna be 
                    same with this one. Cloth is common 
                    red flannel. Glass bowl was made in 
                    China.

      Beckett looks at the bowl with the blood in it.

                                    BECKETT
                    And the blood?

                                  ESPOSITO
                    Chicken blood.

      Beckett picks up a shredded Chanel purse, lying on the floor 
      next to Darcy, with her pen.

                                    BECKETT
                    Must ve used it to defend herself.

      ALEXIS enters in uniform, carrying a large calculus book.

                                  ALEXIS
                    Mr. Simmons. You wanted to see me?

      Her headmaster, MR. SIMMONS - 50s, tweedy, academic - moves 
      to her and places a comforting hand on her shoulder.

                                  MR. SIMMONS
                    Alexis, I m afraid we have some bad 
                    news.

                                  ALEXIS
                    What? No. Is it my dad? Did he get 
                    shot?

      We PULL BACK to REVEAL:

      Meredith rises from a chair, delicately blotting away tears.

                                  MEREDITH
                    It s not your dad, sweetie. 

                                  ALEXIS
                          (confused)

                                  MEREDITH
                    It s your grandfather. He passed 
                    away this morning.

      Alexis shoots Meredith a confused look.

                                  ALEXIS
                          ( who? )
                      Grandfather?

      Meredith cuts her off.      CASTLE Ep. 107 "Always Buy Retail" Full White Draft 1-14-09  15.


                                  MEREDITH
                    I know, it s a lot to take in.

      Alexis sees where this is going.

                                  ALEXIS
                    Mom, I have a calculus test today.

                                  MR. SIMMONS 
                    Given the circumstances, I m sure 
                    Mr. Brown will let you make it up.

                                  MEREDITH
                    Thank you, Mr. Simmons, for your 
                      compassion in this trying time.
                          (to Alexis)
                    Let s go, honey. Lots to do.

      Meredith sweeps up Alexis and they exit...

      As Meredith hurries Alexis along, they talk in hushed tones. 

                                  ALEXIS
                    Mom, Grandpa died six years ago.

                                  MEREDITH
                    I know, but a death in the family? 
                    Always a great excuse to get out of 
                    school.

                                  ALEXIS
                    No. It s a creepy excuse. 

                                  MEREDITH
                    Come on. I need some Alexis time. 
                    Do you realize I ve been in town a 
                    whole week and we haven't even gone 
                    shopping?

                    Why bother learning math if you 
                    don't get to apply it in real-life

      Alexis gives in.

                    Fine. But promise we re not leaving

      INT. PRECINCT - WAITING AREA - DAY1111

      Ryan sits on the couch next to JILL BUTTON, late-20s.

                                  JILL
                    It doesn t make sense. Why would 
                    someone kill her?

                                  RYAN
                    Ms. Button. Your office manager 
                    said you and Darcy were close. 

                                  JILL
                    We joined the firm at the same 
                    time. Neither of us knew anyone in 
                    the city, so we just sort of became 
                    best friends.

      Ryan shows her the crime scene photo of the first victim.

                                  RYAN
                    Do you recognize this man? We think 
                    he and Darcy might be connected.

                                  JILL
                    No. I... What happened to him?

                                  RYAN
                    That s what we re trying to find 
                    out.

                                  JILL
                    Oh, God. Is this what happened to 
                    her? Who would do something like 
                    this?

      Off Ryan...      CASTLE Ep. 107 "Always Buy Retail" Full White Draft 1-14-09  17.


      INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY1212

      Ryan enters to find Castle and Beckett with CAPTAIN 
      MONTGOMERY. He nods back at Jill.

                                  RYAN
                    Jill Button, Darcy s BFF. She says 
                    she s pretty familiar with all of 
                    Darcy s friends and clients, but 
                    she s never seen the vic before. 
                    The firm does do some immigration 
                    though, but there s nothing to 
                    indicate any involvement in 
                    something like this.

                                    CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY
                    So our first victim gets killed in 
                    some religious ritual, then history 
                    repeats itself with this lawyer the 
                    very same day.

                                  CASTLE
                    I m sure there s a lawyer joke in 
                    there somewhere, I just can t think 
                    of it.

                                    CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY
                    And the killer tossed this woman s 
                      apartment, looking for what? Drugs? 
                    Money?

                                  RYAN
                    Far as we can tell, Darcy was clean.

      Esposito enters with a file.

                                  ESPOSITO
                    We got a match on the first 
                    victim s fingerprints. INS

      Esposito hands the file to Beckett.

                    Jamal Buonsi?

                    Nigerian national. Entered the U.S.

                    was enrolled at NYU as an exchange 
                    student. 

                                    BECKETT

                                  CASTLE
                    Looks like he decided to stay.

      Ryan eyes the photo of a dead Jamal.

                                  RYAN
                    Lucky him.

                                    CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY
                    Any word on his last known 
                      whereabouts?

                                  ESPOSITO
                    I tracked down the family Jamal 
                    lived with when he was in school. 
                    Last they saw him, he was in a cab 
                    on his way to Kennedy.

                                    BECKETT
                    I take it that s not the end of the 
                    story.

                                  ESPOSITO
                    No. Turns out, Jamal and their 13-
                    year-old son were pretty close. A 
                    couple months back, the folks 
                      discovered the two of them were 
                    still in touch.

      Esposito hands Beckett a piece of paper.

                                  ESPOSITO (CONT D)
                    Jamal s cell phone number. It s 
                    billed to an address on East 3rd.

                                  CASTLE
                    That s only a few blocks from where 
                    his body was found.

                                  RYAN
                    East 3rd is right near Darcy Cho s 
                    law firm.

                                    CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY
                          (to Ryan)
                    You said Darcy Cho s law firm did 
                    some immigration work?

                    You and Esposito take a ride down 
                    there and find out if this Jamal 
                    Buonsi was a client. Maybe that s 
                    the connection.

                                    BECKETT

      EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING, ROOFTOP COURTYARD - DAY1313

      Castle and Beckett emerge from a stairwell.

                                  CASTLE
                    Wasn t really expecting a doorman 
                    building. But a six flight walk-up?

                                    BECKETT
                    Should ve seen my first apartment. 
                    Three flights up, on an airshaft 
                    over a restaurant. Whole place 
                    smelled like chicken wings.

      Clothes dry on clotheslines. A LARGE PIGEON COOP holds a 
      number of cooing birds. Worn LAWN FURNITURE and a small 
      HIBACHI. Are the pigeons a hobby or dinner?

                                  CASTLE
                    They come here looking for a fresh 
                    start and this is what they get. 
                    Slum housing in Williamsburg.

                                    BECKETT
                    Still, for a lot of them, it s 
                    better than what they left.

      They reach the closed door. From inside we HEAR muffled 
      voices. MUSIC. They share a look.

                                  CASTLE
                    Looks like Jamal didn t live alone. 

      Beckett knocks. No answer. A beat. Then she knocks louder. We 
      hear people talking in a foreign tongue and then the music 
      lowers. A beat later, the DOOR OPENS, revealing a big AFRICAN 
      MAN in his 20s. TWO OTHER MEN of similar ethnicity are behind 
      him inside the apartment.      CASTLE Ep. 107 "Always Buy Retail" Full White Draft 1-14-09  20.


                                    AFRICAN MAN
                    Yes?

                                    BECKETT
                          (badges him)
                    Detective Beckett. NYPD. 

      The men start yelling to each other. The African Man tries to 
      slam the door on her, but Beckett shoves her foot in between 
      the door and the jamb. 

                                    BECKETT (CONT D)
                    Oh no, you don t.

      She shoulders the door open and bursts in...

      INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS1414

      ...drawing her gun.

                                    BECKETT
                    Hands. Show me your hands.

      They raise their hands. One of them, frightened, yells to 
      another something that sounds like  Immigration. 

                                    BECKETT (CONT D)
                    No. I m not Immigration! Everybody 
                    just relax!

      Beckett moves deeper inside. Twin beds fill the room and not 
      much else. Castle follows a beat later, at a safe distance. 

                                    AFRICAN MAN
                    If you re not from Immigration, 
                    then who are you?

                                    BECKETT
                    I m a homicide detective. 
                          (off their looks)
                    I m looking for information about 
                    Jamal Buonsi.

                    We don t know any Jamal.

                                    BECKETT
                    Then you wanna tell me why his cell 
                    phone was billed to this address?

      The men exchange more glances but remain silent.      CASTLE Ep. 107 "Always Buy Retail" Full White Draft 1-14-09  21.


                                    BECKETT (CONT D)
                    Did you want me to call Immigration 
                    or do you want to cooperate?

      That s when Castle spots a piece of red flannel cloth peeking 
      out from underneath one of the beds. He indicates toward it.

                                  CASTLE
                      Detective.

      Beckett sees it now, too.

                                    BECKETT
                    Whose bed is that?

      Again, silence. Beckett stares them down.

                                    BECKETT (CONT D)
                    I m not going to ask again.

      The African Man glances at one of the other two men - AZI, 
      20s. A tell. Beckett turns to Azi.

                                    BECKETT (CONT D)
                    That your bed?

      Azi nods. Castle examines the red cloth.

                                  CASTLE
                    The same red flannel...

      He pauses as he finds a bag.

                                    BECKETT
                    What is it?

      Castle dumps the bag out on the bed. PARAFFIN CANDLES spill 
      out, along with a GLASS BOWL.

                                      ACT THREE

      INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY1515

      Castle and Beckett sit across from Azi. On the table in front 
      of them is the piece of red flannel cloth and several candles.

                                    BECKETT
                    Red flannel cloth, candles... You 
                    know about these things, don t you? 
                    What they re used for?

                                  CASTLE
                    You were invoking the Loa, Ogun. 
                    Why? What re you looking for?

      Azi says nothing.

                                    BECKETT
                    We can link this red flannel to two 
                      murders... In this country, that 
                    puts you in a lot of trouble. 

                                  AZI
                    I ve done nothing wrong. 

                                    BECKETT
                    Two people are dead. One was a man 
                    you lived with.

      She shows him the photo of Jamal s crime scene.

                                    BECKETT (CONT D)
                    Look at the picture. That s the 
                    same red flannel, the same candle.

      Azi is clearly upset. Beckett shows him the photo of Darcy s 
      crime scene.

                                    BECKETT (CONT D)
                    And again here. Why d you kill her, 
                    Azi?

                                  AZI
                    I don t know this woman. I didn t 
                    kill anyone.

                                    BECKETT
                    So, you re saying it s just a 
                      coincidence all these things were 
                    found in your apartment. Under your 
                    bed.      CASTLE Ep. 107 "Always Buy Retail" Full White Draft 1-14-09  23.


                                  AZI
                    They weren t mine. They were for 
                    someone else.

                                    BECKETT
                    Who?

      Azi is silent.

                                    BECKETT (CONT D)
                    Do you want to go back to Nigeria? 
                    Because I can arrange that with one 
                    phone call.

      Azi meets Beckett s eye.

                                  AZI
                    So can he.

      Castle and Beckett exchange looks. Azi s scared of someone. 
      But as he looks back down at the photo of Jamal, Beckett sees 
      something else. Remorse.

                                    BECKETT
                    Jamal was your friend, wasn t he?

                                  AZI
                    Yes. 

                                    BECKETT
                    Don t you want us to catch who 
                    killed him? Don t you want justice? 

      A beat as Azi considers it. Then...

                                  AZI
                    His name is Charles. Charles Oni.

                                    BECKETT
                    Charles Oni?

                                  AZI
                      Immigrants know this man. He owns 
                    the apartments where we live. He 
                    owns the places where we work. 

                                  CASTLE
                    What about Jamal? Did he work for 
                    Oni, too?

                                  AZI
                    At his stall on Canal Street. But 
                    it was only temporary. Jamal was a 
                    hard worker. Educated.

                                  AZI (CONT'D)
                    He was going to save money, then 
                    apply for a visa. Become legal.

                                  CASTLE
                    And Oni had a problem with that?

                                  AZI
                    No. Yesterday, when Oni came 
                    looking for Jamal, he said Jamal 
                    had taken something. Jamal was not 
                    a thief. But Oni insisted. He knew 
                    my father was the priest of our 
                    village, so he made me show him how 
                    to invoke the spirits.

                                    BECKETT
                    What did Jamal take? 

                                  AZI
                    Oni didn t say.

                                    BECKETT
                    Why didn t you ask?

                                  AZI
                    Because I was scared. He would ve 
                    killed me. I m only telling you now 
                    because Jamal was my friend. He did 
                    not deserve to die like that. Oni 
                    was wrong.

      Beckett and Castle trade looks.

      INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - LATER1616

      Castle and Beckett at her desk. Beckett hangs up the phone.

                    doubt he s gonna use his real name. 

                                    BECKETT
                    Clearly not. The apartment s owned 
                    by a  Robert Burnett.  No listing

                                  CASTLE
                    That s perfect, because our

                    We still have no idea what our two 
                    victims had in common.

      Just then, we hear a commotion from the other end of the 
      bullpen. They look up to see...

      Meredith, loaded up with shopping bags, is trying to push her 
      way past a BULLPEN UNIFORM. Alexis is behind her, trying to 
      disappear in a shame spiral. 

                                  MEREDITH
                    No, I am not going to wait 
                      downstairs. Do you have any idea who 
                    pays your salary? Me and my taxes.

      Beckett shoots a look at Castle.

                                    BECKETT
                    Is that...?

                                  CASTLE
                    Yep.

      Meredith spots him and waves.

                                  MEREDITH
                    Richard! Over here!

      The Bullpen Uniform catches Beckett s eye. Beckett nods and 
      he lets them through. As Meredith hustles toward them with 
      her bags:

                    Anyway, since we were in the 
                      neighborhood and I have a dinner 
                    tonight, I thought I d drop Alexis 
                    here instead of schlepping all the 
                    way downtown.

                                  CASTLE

                    Just being thoughtful-

      Meredith has caught site of the murder board, specifically 
      the printout of the Chanel purse.

                    Canal Street?

                                    BECKETT
                    That s where they sell all the 
                      knockoffs, counterfeit electronics, 
                    watches, luggage...

                                  CASTLE
                    And handbags.

                                  RYAN
                    Darcy s office was right near 
                    Canal. If she was going to buy a 
                    designer knockoff...

                                    BECKETT
                    She would ve gone to a stall on 
                    Canal. 

                                  CASTLE
                    The one where Jamal worked.

                                    BECKETT
                    Oni s stall. That s what connects 
                    our two victims.
                          (to Esposito)
                    Get a sketch from Azi. Maybe one of 
                    the other vendors can ID his stall. 

      Castle and Beckett share a look. Meredith puts her arms 
      around Castle.

                                  MEREDITH
                    See? I always was your lucky charm. 
                    Just think of the things we ll do 
                    once I move back.

      As Meredith heads out, we stay with Castle and Alexis.

                                  CASTLE
                    You want to talk about it?

                                  ALEXIS
                    No. You?      CASTLE Ep. 107 "Always Buy Retail" Full White Draft 1-14-09  29.


                                  CASTLE
                    No.

                                  ALEXIS
                    If school calls, Grandpa died. 

      Castle nods, understanding. 

                                  CASTLE
                    Yeah, when your mom's around, he 
                    dies a lot.

      INT. CASTLE S LOFT, CASTLE S OFFICE - NIGHT1717

      Castle is at his desk, in his writing position. Behind him on 
      a CLOTHESLINE are freshly-printed pages of his novel, hanging 
      from clothespins. As he tears one down to re-read it, MARTHA 
      steams in.

                                  MARTHA
                          (re: the pages)
                    Why don t you get a corkboard like

                    Did you know Meredith kidnapped 
                    Alexis from school today?

                                  CASTLE
                    And we all paid a hefty ransom.

                                  MARTHA
                    It s outrageous.

                    Remember your touring production of

                                  MARTHA
                    That was different. I was working 
                    and trying to be a mother. I wasn t 
                    just waltzing into town and

                                  MARTHA
                    Have you considered what it's going 
                    to be like having Meredith back in 
                    New York? How it s going to affect 
                    you?

                                  CASTLE
                    You mean how it s going to affect 
                    you.

                    What am I supposed to do, Mother? 
                    It s not like I can ban her from 
                    New York.

                                  MARTHA
                    And this whole  theatre  thing. 
                    It s ridiculous. Did you know she 
                    hasn t landed a role in months?

      Castle looks up.

                                  MARTHA (CONT D)
                    That s right. I made some calls. 
                    Why do you think she s moving back? 
                    She can t get arrested in LA.

                    Wonder if she could get arrested in

                    Does she honestly think she s going

      EXT. CANAL STREET - MORNING1818

      Ryan and Esposito walk past busy stalls on Canal Street. 
        Everything s on sale. Tables are stacked with counterfeit 
      goods, including handbags. 

                                  ESPOSITO
                    All my years on the force, I never 
                      understood why we don t shut these 
                    guys down.

                                  RYAN
                    C mere. 

      Ryan grabs a purse and shows it to Esposito. 

                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                    See? This one s supposed to be a 
                    Louis Vuitton. But if you look 
                    close, instead of an  LV,  the 
                    initials say  EV. 

      Esposito studies the bag.

                                  ESPOSITO
                    That s pretty close.

                                  RYAN
                    But not exact. And that s what 
                    keeps these guys from getting 
                    busted. See, technically, it s not 
                    an imitation. It s an homage.

                                  ESPOSITO
                    An homage.

      Beckett and Castle arrive.

                                  CASTLE
                    You ladies picking out something 
                    pretty for yourselves?

      Esposito puts down the purse.

                                    BECKETT
                    You got the warrant?

                                  ESPOSITO
                    Yeah. Which one is it?

      Beckett indicates a shuttered stall nearby.

      TIME LAPSE       CASTLE Ep. 107 "Always Buy Retail" Full White Draft 1-14-09  32.


      CLOSE ON: BOLT CUTTERS 

      Esposito pops the lock on the shuttered stall. Beckett pulls 
      out her weapon and looks at her guys.

                                    BECKETT
                    Stay sharp. This guy s already 
                    killed twice. 

      Ryan lifts the metal garage door and we reveal...

      INT. STALL - CONTINUOUS1919

      The place has been trashed. Boxes torn open, bags tossed 
      around, display cabinets smashed, and papers strewn 
      everywhere. A number of Chanel bags have been ripped apart.

                                    BECKETT
                    The same Chanel. 

                                  CASTLE
                    Shredded.

      Esposito sees something on the floor. He pushes aside some 
      papers to reveal:

                                  ESPOSITO
                    Beckett?

      At the center, painted on the floor, is a large Vodun symbol. 
      Beckett examines it.

                                    BECKETT
                    This one s different. It s not the 
                    one we found in the victims  mouths.

                                  CASTLE
                    I ve seen this symbol before. It s 
                    the symbol for death. 

                                  RYAN
                    Why would a guy mark his own stall 
                    with a death symbol?

                                  CASTLE
                    He wouldn t. The symbol was meant 
                    for him. Charles Oni s been marked 
                    for death.

      EXT. CANAL STREET - DAY2020

      UNIFORMS and CSUs work through Oni s stall. Castle and 
      Beckett look at the shredded Chanel purses.

                                    BECKETT
                    The linings have been cut out.
                          (thinking it through)
                    All of this stuff is imported, right? 
                      A knockoff would be a perfect 
                    delivery system for a smuggler.

                                  RYAN
                    Yeah, but what re they smuggling?

                                    BECKETT
                    The only guy who can tell us has 
                    been marked for death.

      Esposito s eyes fall on the death symbol.

                                  ESPOSITO
                    If he is alive, he doesn t have 
                    much incentive to stick around.

                    the sketch and have them put Oni s

      She turns back to Castle, but he s gone. She looks around to 
      see that he s wandering away...

                    Castle?

      As Castle crosses into the street, he waves his hands. 
      Beckett follows, thrown by Castle s odd behavior.

                    Castle? What are you doing?

      Castle heads to a store across the way: O&H DISCOUNT

      waves again.

                    Look behind me. 

      He steps aside, revealing... ONI S STALL across the way.

                    If that camera s recording...

      A small storefront crammed with audio and visual equipment. 
      Beckett and Castle talk to the STORE MANAGER, 30s, as 
      forthcoming and friendly as a used car salesman. 

                                  STORE MANAGER
                    What can I say? People like to see 
                      themselves on television. I m 
                    telling you, you would not believe 
                    what people do in front of a camera.

                    I m sorry, but I can t show you the

                    I could get a warrant.

                                  STORE MANAGER
                    Wouldn t help. I sold it.

                                  STORE MANAGER
                    Some guy rolls in yesterday. Asked 
                    for that one specifically. I told 
                    him we got others, ones with boxes. 
                    But he wants the one in the window.

                                    BECKETT
                    What d he look like?

                                  STORE MANAGER
                    6 foot. Big. Black. Had an accent. 

      Beckett takes out the sketch of Oni.

                                    BECKETT
                    Was it him?

                                  STORE MANAGER
                    Him? No. He owns the stall across 
                    the street.

                                  CASTLE
                    You know him?

                                  STORE MANAGER
                    We say  hi.  But this guy...
                          (shakes his head)
                    He seemed heavy. I don t mean 
                      physically. Just something about him. 
                    Like he d seen things. Bad things.

                                  STORE MANAGER
                    He paid cash. Retail. At my 
                    prices... I mean, he never once 
                    tried to negotiate.

                                    BECKETT
                    Would you be willing to work with a 
                    police sketch artist?

                                  STORE MANAGER
                    Wouldn t a real picture be better?

                                    BECKETT
                    You said he took the camera and the 
                      recording.

                                  STORE MANAGER
                    Yeah, he did.
                          (off her look)
                    Lady, this is an electronics store. 
                    I got cameras all over this place.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. CANAL STREET - LATER2222

      CLOSE ON: A SURVEILLANCE PHOTO OF THE MYSTERY MAN

      He appears to be in his late 30s, with the eyes of a shark 
      and a scar on his face. He stands at the counter of the store 
      wearing a surplus Army jacket...

      Esposito looks at the photo. 

                                  ESPOSITO
                    Yeah. He looks like the kind of guy 
                    who d paint death symbols on your 
                    floor.

                                  CASTLE
                    Here s what I don t get... Why did 
                    he buy the camera?

                                  RYAN
                     Cause he had the same idea we did.

                                  CASTLE
                    We wanted the camera because we 
                    were looking for him...

                                    BECKETT
                    But who s he looking for? 

      Esposito s cell phone rings. He answers.      CASTLE Ep. 107 "Always Buy Retail" Full White Draft 1-14-09  37.


                                  ESPOSITO
                    Esposito. Yeah?
                          (beat)
                    Really? When? No. Absolutely. Bring 
                    him in.

      Esposito hangs up the phone.

                                  ESPOSITO (CONT D)
                    TSA just pulled Charles Oni from a 
                    security line at JFK off our

                                  RYAN
                    Good call, bro.

                                  CASTLE
                    Where was he going?

                                  ESPOSITO
                    Nigeria. Under the name Robert 
                    Burnett.

                                    BECKETT
                    So was Oni running because he 
                    killed, or because he was going to 
                    be killed?

                                  CASTLE
                    Or both.

      INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER2323

      Beckett interrogates ONI, who sits defiantly across from her.

                                  ONI
                    I don t know what you re talking 
                    about. I was going home to visit my 
                    family.

                                    BECKETT
                    Then why was the ticket only one-way?

                                  ONI
                    My mother is ill. I did not know 
                    when I d be returning.

      From the side of the table, Castle looks up from his notepad.

                                  CASTLE
                    Must be nice to be able to see your 
                    mother. It s something Jamal Buonsi 
                    will never get a chance to do.      CASTLE Ep. 107 "Always Buy Retail" Full White Draft 1-14-09  38.


      Beckett lays out Jamal s and Darcy s crime scene photos.

                                    BECKETT
                    We know you re involved in these 
                    murders. 
                          (off Oni)
                    Azi, the young man you intimidated 
                    into finding Jamal, is very eager 
                    to testify against you.

                                  CASTLE
                      Apparently, he takes his religious 
                    beliefs very seriously. Doesn t 
                    approve of using Vodun to kill 
                    people. 

                                  ONI
                    I didn t kill anyone.

                                    BECKETT
                    Then why were you looking for Jamal?

      Oni remains silent.

                                    BECKETT (CONT D)
                    What was in the purse?

      Oni looks up, surprised by the reference to the purse. 
      Beckett and Castle notice.

                                    BECKETT (CONT D)
                    What were you smuggling?

                                  ONI
                    I want a lawyer.

                                    BECKETT
                    Are you sure? Because if you get a 
                    lawyer, you ll be back on the 
                    street in an hour, only I ll make 
                    sure you can t leave town. And you 
                    want to leave town, don t you?

      Beckett slides the photograph of the man who bought the 
      camera at the electronics store across the table to Oni. We 
      see a flash of fear flicker in Oni s eyes.

                                    BECKETT (CONT D)
                    You scare a lot of people, Mr. Oni. 
                      Immigrants, illegals. Tell me, who 
                    scares you?      CASTLE Ep. 107 "Always Buy Retail" Full White Draft 1-14-09  39.


                                  ONI
                          (a bad lie)
                    I don t know this man.

                                  CASTLE
                    He knows you. In fact, he s marked 
                    you for death.

      Oni is shaken. Beckett applies the thumbscrews.

                                    BECKETT
                    Jamal worked for you and he s dead. 
                    Darcy Cho bought a purse from you 
                    and she s dead. Why?

                                  ONI
                    I won t talk without protection.

                                    BECKETT
                    I can t protect you if I don t know 
                    what from.

      Oni draws a deep breath before he spills.

                                  ONI
                    His name is Mukhtar Baylor. Very 
                    bad. Very dangerous. Former 
                    Nigerian secret police. They called 
                    him the Butcher of Benin.

                                    BECKETT
                    What s he doing in the U.S.?

                                  ONI
                    He trafficks. Drugs. Women. 
                    Whatever makes him money. He killed 
                    Jamal and the woman.

                                    BECKETT
                    Why? 

      Oni weighs his options.

                                  ONI
                    If I tell you, you will protect me?

      EXT. STREET, OUTSIDE DOWNTOWN WAREHOUSE - DAY2525

      Run-down. Nearby, a TAC-TEAM unloads from the van. Guns are 
      checked, vests are donned. Beckett opens her trunk, and as 
      she reaches for her bulletproof vest, she notices a bag.

                                    BECKETT
                    Where did that come from?

                      I thought, given everything that s 
                    happened, I should be prepared. 

      And out of the bag, he pulls his own BULLETPROOF VEST.

                    Special order. And look...

      He points to the back. Where her vest says POLICE in big,

                                    BECKETT
                    Stay. Here. Don t do anything.

      As Beckett moves to the TAC-Team, where the COP in charge is 
      studying the photograph of Baylor. Beckett gives them hand 
      signals and they deploy, Ryan and Esposito following.

      A moment later, a vested Castle follows.

      INT. DOWNTOWN WAREHOUSE - DAY2626

      Tense. The TAC-Team moves slowly through oil drums, machine 
      parts, and crates, making their way through the warehouse 
      using hand signals. Beckett, Ryan, and Esposito are on point.

      A beat after they pass camera, Castle arrives behind them. 
      Creeping along.

      The TAC-Team move silently, working their way to the back 
      offices. Tension is thick until...

      A loud, OBNOXIOUS MUSICAL RING TONE ECHOES through the room. 
      The TAC-Team turns and we reveal Castle, wincing. His cell 
      phone just received a TEXT MESSAGE. He mouths,  Sorry,  and 
      reads the text:  911!!!! - Call Home ASAP!!! Alexis.  
      Concerned, he turns and creeps out of the warehouse. The TAC-
      Team continues forward.

      EXT. DOWNTOWN WAREHOUSE FRONT - DAY2727

      Castle dials his cell. We hear a muffled,  Hello. 

                                  CASTLE
                    Alexis? What s wrong?

      INT. CASTLE'S LOFT - CONTINUOUS2828

      Meredith, all excitement, is standing in Castle s loft, 
      holding the Real Estate Section of the paper. 

                                  MEREDITH
                    Richard! Guess what?

                                  CASTLE 
                    Meredith?

                                  MEREDITH
                    I found a place! A perfect place! 
                    It s light. Spacious. And only a 
                    million six.

                                  CASTLE
                    The text said  Alexis.  It said it 
                    was an emergency.

                                  MEREDITH
                    Well, how else was I gonna get you 
                    to call me back?

      Castle checks his phone...

                                  CASTLE
                    But... Are you at the loft?

                                  MEREDITH
                    I was in the neighborhood and had 
                    to pee, so I had Eduardo let me in. 
                    So, I called the realtor, and 
                    here s the thing. I may need you to 
                    co-sign the loan.

      Castle pinches the bridge of his nose with his fingers and 
      shakes his head.

                                  CASTLE
                    Meredith, we re divorced. I m not 
                      co-signing the loan.

                                  MEREDITH
                    It s for Alexis, too. I mean, it s 
                    only a one bedroom, but you want 
                    her to be comfortable when she 
                    visits, right?

                                  CASTLE
                    Can we talk about this later? I m 
                    in the middle of capturing a very 
                    dangerous Nigerian drug lord...      CASTLE Ep. 107 "Always Buy Retail" Full White Draft 1-14-09  44.


                                  MEREDITH
                    Okay. Later, then. Hey, Richard?

                                  CASTLE
                    Yeah?

                                  MEREDITH
                    Thanks.

                                  CASTLE
                    For what?

                                  MEREDITH
                    Putting up with me. I know I ve 
                    been a handful, but once things 
                    settle down...

      Castle spots an SUV approaching. We recognize the driver...

                                  MEREDITH (CONT D)
                    ...I think it s gonna be great.

                                  CASTLE
                            (distracted)
                    Yeah. Great. 

                                  MEREDITH
                    Are you even listening to me? 
                    Richard? Richard?

      It s MUKHTA BAYLOR. 

      BAYLOR S POV - Castle on the sidewalk, wearing a bulletproof 
      vest just like the police, except he s not the police.

                                  CASTLE
                    Gotta go.

      Castle hangs up his phone.

                                  CASTLE (CONT D)
                    Hey! HEY!

      Castle runs toward Baylor. Baylor slams the gas and peels out 
      of there.

      EXT. DOWNTOWN WAREHOUSE - LATER2929

      Beckett, Esposito, and Ryan stare at Castle.

                                    BECKETT
                    What do you mean, you didn t get a 
                    license?

                                  ESPOSITO
                    What kind of a car was it?

                                  CASTLE
                    Big. An SUV, I think.

                                  ESPOSITO
                    You think...

                                  RYAN
                    How about the color?

      This one Castle knows.

                                  CASTLE
                    Black... Or was it dark blue.

      The three of them look at him. 

                                  CASTLE (CONT D)
                    Being a witness is harder than it 
                    looks. How do you guys ever get a 
                      conviction?

      Then, they all turn away and walk back into the warehouse.

                                  CASTLE (CONT D)
                    You know, I m usually great with 
                    the detail stuff. I was distracted.

      INT. DOWNTOWN WAREHOUSE OFFICE - DAY3030

      Beckett enters, followed by the others. The room is creepy. 
      Various symbols are on the walls. Bolts of red flannel, glass 
      bowls, jars filled with liquid. A collection of knives and 
      weapons.

                                  ESPOSITO
                    Weird.

                                  RYAN
                    Yeah. Really weird...

      Ryan s looking at the desk. It s covered with yoga brochures 
      and schedules. 

                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                    Vodun dude was a yoga nut.

      Opening one of the desk drawers, he finds a VIDEO CAMERA.

                                    BECKETT
                    The camera from the electronics

      INT. PRECINCT, TECH ROOM - DAY3131

      Castle, Beckett, Ryan, and Esposito sit in front of a TV 
      monitor, scrolling through the tape from the video camera.

      TIGHT ON: TV SCREEN

      PEOPLE pass by on the sidewalk in front of the electronics 
      store, some wave into the camera. In the BG, we see Jamal 
      working at Oni s stall across the street. (Note - the video 
      has a time stamp.)

                                  CASTLE
                    It s Jamal. 

      On the TV screen, we see a woman come up, greet Jamal...

                                    BECKETT
                    And Darcy Cho. 

      We watch as Jamal disappears into the back of the stall and 
      re-emerges with the CHANEL PURSE.       CASTLE Ep. 107 "Always Buy Retail" Full White Draft 1-14-09  47.


      Beckett scrolls forward. Until...

                                  CASTLE
                    Wait. Go back.

      She scrolls back to reveal...

      ON THE TV SCREEN: 

      A WOMAN, 30s, in workout clothes, has a YOGA MAT slung over 
      her shoulder and a CUP OF TAKE-OUT COFFEE in her hand. She 
      buys a Chanel bag from Jamal. 

                                  RYAN
                    Looks like someone else besides Darcy 
                    bought a Chanel bag from Jamal.

      Ryan freezes the image. Castle points.

                                  CASTLE
                    And she s carrying a yoga mat.

      Beckett picks up the stack of brochures they found at the 
      warehouse.

                                    BECKETT
                          (off the brochures)
                    Baylor s looking for her.

                                  RYAN
                    Eight million people in the city. 
                    He ll never find her.

                                  CASTLE
                    He s former secret police. He ll 
                    find her.

                                    BECKETT
                    Not if we find her first.
                          (off Ryan s look)
                    She s got coffee. From the Java Loft.

                                  ESPOSITO
                    So?

                                    BECKETT
                    So, we re looking for a yoga 
                    studio, near a Java Loft, somewhere 
                    off Canal Street.

                    Baylor s got a head start.      CASTLE Ep. 107 "Always Buy Retail" Full White Draft 1-14-09  48.


      Castle holds up his phone.

                                  CASTLE
                    But I have an awesome service plan 
                    now.

                                    BECKETT
                          (to Ryan and Esposito)
                    We ve got Yoga Girl. You see if 
                    anyone else bought that bag.

      INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY3232

      As Beckett and Castle quickly push through the precinct, 
      Castle s thumbs are working his phone.

                                  CASTLE
                    There are four Java Lofts within 
                    five blocks of Canal.

                                    BECKETT
                    Yoga studios?

                                  CASTLE
                    Time stamp on the video was 3:22. 
                    So we need a local studio with a 
                    class that ended around 3:00.

                                    BECKETT
                    Maybe the woman was on her way to a 
                    yoga class.

                                  CASTLE
                    Ever tried a half moon pose cranked 
                    up on caffeine? Totally throws off 
                    your chi. Trust me, she bought her 
                    coffee after class.

                                    BECKETT
                    A class ending around 3 p.m. would 
                    give her enough time to buy her 
                    coffee...

                                  CASTLE
                    But probably not finish it by the 
                    time she got to Canal Street. 

      As they hit the elevator, Castle taps the touchscreen a few 
      more times.

                                  CASTLE (CONT D)
                    Got it.

      Beckett and Castle race to the door. Beckett pounds on it.

      Diana. Beckett badges her.

                                    BECKETT
                    Detective Beckett. NYPD. Are you 
                    Diana Edwards?

                                  DIANA
                    Yeah.

                                    BECKETT
                    We need to talk to you.

      Beckett pushes in through the door. Castle follows.

      INT. DIANA EDWARDS'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS3535

      Beckett, Castle, and Diana stand in the living room. 

                                    BECKETT
                    Diana, we have video surveillance 
                    of you purchasing a Chanel purse on 
                    Canal Street two days ago.

                                  DIANA
                    Wow, I know you guys are cracking 
                    down on the knockoffs, but...

                                  CASTLE
                    Where s the bag?

                                  DIANA
                    Right here.

      Diana moves to the kitchen island, where we now see the bag. 
      She hands it to Beckett. Beckett dumps its contents... 

                                  DIANA (CONT D)
                    Hey! 

      ...and rips open the lining. She pulls out a PASSPORT and 
      holds it up for Castle to see.

                                  DIANA (CONT D)
                    What s going on?

                                  CASTLE
                    You re a very lucky lady.

                                  DIANA
                          (to Castle)
                    I don t understand... Am I in 
                    trouble?      CASTLE Ep. 107 "Always Buy Retail" Full White Draft 1-14-09  51.


                                  CASTLE
                    No. But from now on... always buy 
                    retail.

      Suddenly, there s a knock at the door.

                                  BAYLOR (O.S.)
                    NYPD. Open the door.

      Beckett and Castle look at one another.

                                    BECKETT
                    It s Baylor.
                          (to Diana)
                    Hide. Now!

      Diana runs into the bedroom.

                                    BECKETT (CONT D)
                    Castle! 

      She points to the bathroom. As Castle tucks behind the 
      bathroom door, Beckett slips the passport into her jacket s 
      breast pocket and draws her gun. Castle cracks the bathroom 
      door and peeks out to see her take position by the front 
      door. The knocking stops and...

      BAM! The door s kicked open revealing Baylor. But as he 
      enters the apartment... WHAM! Beckett slams a crushing elbow 
      to his chest, followed quickly by a backhanded fist to the 
      face. Baylor staggers, stunned. Blood explodes from his lip. 

      Beckett pivots and levels her weapon, but not in time. Baylor 
      grabs her gun hand and BAM! BAM! TWO ROUNDS EXPLODE into the 
      ceiling!

      Baylor grabs Beckett by the throat with his free hand and 
      drives her into a bookcase near the bathroom door. As she 
      smashes into it, all the contents crash down around her. Her 
      head SLAMS back into the case and Beckett loses hold of her 
      gun. She drops to the floor... unconscious.

      Baylor picks up her gun and, seeing the purse on the kitchen 
      island, he heads toward it.

      As he does, Castle slips out of the bathroom and grabs 
      Beckett. He pulls her back into the bathroom. 

      Baylor picks up the purse and sees that the lining has 
      already been ripped out. Pissed, Baylor turns in time to see 
      Castle slam the bathroom door shut.      CASTLE Ep. 107 "Always Buy Retail" Full White Draft 1-14-09  52.


      INT. DIANA EDWARDS S APARTMENT, BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS3636

      Beckett lies on the tile floor, eyes closed. Castle gently 
      shakes her.

                                  CASTLE
                    Beckett. Beckett! Wake up!

      There s no response. Beckett s still out cold. Castle looks 
      to the locked door. The knob is rattling. Baylor wants in.

      INT. DIANA EDWARDS S APARTMENT, BATHROOM - DAY3737

      Baylor pounds on the door. Castle looks around the bathroom, 
      searching for some way to defend himself. But there s 
      nothing. BAM! BAM! BAM! Shots splinter the bathroom door.

      Castle grabs the unconscious Beckett and hoists her in the 
      bathtub to protect her from gunfire. He reaches inside 
      Beckett s jacket s breast pocket...

                                  CASTLE
                    If you can hear me, I m not trying 
                    to touch your boobs. I swear.

      ...and removes Baylor s passport. He tucks the passport in 
      his pants pocket, then pulls the shower curtain closed, 
      concealing the tub and Beckett. 

      BAM! BAM! The doorknob shatters. Castle looks to the far end 
      of the bathroom. There s a second door. 

      INT. DIANA EDWARDS S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS3838

      Baylor kicks open the bathroom door...

      INT. DIANA EDWARDS S APARTMENT, BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS3939

      ...and storms in, gun drawn, to see Castle slipping out the 
      far door. He FIRES, his bullet shattering the doorframe.

      INT. DIANA EDWARDS S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS4040

      Castle, moving quickly through the bedroom. He sees Diana 
      cowering by the bed. He motions to her to:

                                  CASTLE
                          (whisper)
                    Get under the bed.

      Diana crawls underneath the bed. Castle races to the doorway. 
      Baylor appears behind him across the room. He FIRES again.

      INT. DIANA EDWARDS S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS4141

      Castle dives over a sofa and crawls behind the large, 
      concrete kitchen island. Hanging over the island is a rack of 
      pots and pans. 

                                  BAYLOR (O.S.)
                    Give me the passport!      CASTLE Ep. 107 "Always Buy Retail" Full White Draft 1-14-09  54.


                                  CASTLE
                    I don t know what you re talking 
                    about.

      Baylor moves to the center of the room so he can keep an eye 
      on the bathroom, bedroom, and Castle, while preventing anyone 
      escaping out the front door.

                                  BAYLOR
                    I have a gun. I will shoot you.

                                  CASTLE
                    I don t have it!

                                  BAYLOR
                    Then you die.

      He levels his gun and fires a shot that bounces off the 
      kitchen island.

                                  CASTLE
                    Okay. Fine. I have it.

      Baylor crosses to the island and begins circling. Castle, in 
      a crouch, tries to stay a step ahead of him.

                                  BAYLOR
                    Give it to me.

                                  CASTLE
                    No.

      Baylor fires another round that bounces off a hanging pot, 
      inches from Castle.

                                  BAYLOR
                    I ll kill you.

                                  CASTLE
                    I know.

      Baylor s getting exasperated chasing Castle.

                                  BAYLOR
                    Give it to me and I ll let you live.

                                  CASTLE
                    Really?  Cause you keep shooting at 
                    me.

      Castle moves to the other side of the island, keeping the 
      island s bulk between himself and Baylor.       CASTLE Ep. 107 "Always Buy Retail" Full White Draft 1-14-09  55.


                                  BAYLOR
                    Just give me what I want.

                                  CASTLE
                    Come on, pal. I ve written this scene 
                    like a hundred times. I give you what 
                    you want, I know how it ends. Badly. 
                    And by  badly  I mean me dead.

      It s a bit of a standoff until, from the bathroom, we hear a 
      soft moan... Baylor hears it too and it gives him an idea.

                                  BAYLOR
                    Tell me where it is or your 
                      girlfriend dies.

      Baylor, keeping his gun trained on Castle, walks backward 
      toward the bathroom.

                                  CASTLE
                    She s not my girlfriend. 

                                  BAYLOR
                    Are you sure?

      INT. DIANA EDWARDS S APARTMENT, BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS4242

      Baylor reaches the doorway and raises his gun.

                                  CASTLE 
                    Wait!

      But Baylor fires three rounds through the shower curtain, 
      into the bathtub. He whips the shower curtain open, but the 
      bathtub is empty! A GUN enters frame, the muzzle pressing 
      against the back of Baylor s head.

      It s Beckett. She s got a cut on her forehead, but the hand 
      holding her backup piece is steady.

                                    BECKETT 
                    Missed me.

                                                                      TIME CUT TO:

      INT. DIANA EDWARDS S APARTMENT - LATER4343

    A UNIFORM takes Diana Edwards s statement. CSUs collect 
      evidence. A PARAMEDIC finishes up with Beckett and moves off. 
      She holds an ice pack to the butterfly-taped cut on her head 
      as Castle approaches.

                    How you feeling?      CASTLE Ep. 107 "Always Buy Retail" Full White Draft 1-14-09  56.


                                    BECKETT
                    Don t remember much after hitting 
                    the bookcase.

                                  CASTLE
                    I was very heroic.

                                    BECKETT
                    Is that how I ended up in the 
                    bathtub?

                                  CASTLE
                          (grins)
                    You can read all about it in my 
                    next book.

                                    BECKETT
                          (serious)
                    Getting me to safety like that. You 
                    probably saved my life.

                                  CASTLE
                       Probably ? I totally saved your 
                    life. And you know what that means. 
                    You owe me.

                                    BECKETT
                    Owe you what?

      He nods as he moves closer to her, suggestively.

                                  CASTLE
                    Whatever I want. And you know what I 
                    want, don t you? You know what I d 
                    really like you to do.

      He leans in for what seems like a kiss, but he actually 
      whispers in her ear.

                                  CASTLE (CONT D)
                    Never, ever call me Pooh Bear.

      He turns and walks out of the apartment. Beckett looks after 
      him and smiles.

      INT. CASTLE'S LOFT, CASTLE S OFFICE - NIGHT4444

      Alexis enters to find Castle writing.

                                  ALEXIS
                    Dad?

                    Yeah, sweetie?      CASTLE Ep. 107 "Always Buy Retail" Full White Draft 1-14-09  57.


      He looks up as she takes a seat.

                                  ALEXIS
                      Hypothetically... is it okay to 
                    love someone but not want to have

                                  CASTLE

                                  ALEXIS
                    I love her. I do. 

                                  CASTLE
                    I know you do. And I m glad you do.

                                  ALEXIS
                    But, Dad...
                          (like it s a big 
                            confession)
                    She drives me crazy.

      Castle smiles.

                                  CASTLE
                    Yeah. That s what mothers do.

                                  ALEXIS
                    But if she lives here...

      From O.S., we hear the front door open.

                                  MEREDITH (O.S.)
                    Richard? Alexis?

      Castle and Alexis trade looks.

                                  CASTLE
                    Your secret s safe with me.

      Castle and Alexis head out.

      INT. CASTLE'S LOFT, FRONT HALL - CONTINUOUS4545

      Castle and Alexis, joined by Martha, find a very excited 
      Meredith, bubbling with news.

                                  MEREDITH
                    You will not believe what happened! 
                    I got a call from my agent. I ve 
                    been offered a huge role in a new 
                    indie film.      CASTLE Ep. 107 "Always Buy Retail" Full White Draft 1-14-09  58.


                                  ALEXIS
                    Wow. Mom, that s great.

                                  MEREDITH
                    It is. But, here s the bad news. 
                    I m going to have to put my plans 
                    to move back to New York on hold.

                                  MARTHA
                    How ever will we manage?

                                  CASTLE
                    Indie film? Sounds artsy. 

                                  MEREDITH
                    Totally. It s a part I can really 
                    sink my teeth into. Besides, it s 
                    not like Broadway s going anywhere. 
                    I can always do theatre when I m 
                    too old for High Def.

      Castle, gently but firmly, places a hand on Martha s arm, 
      before she kills her former daughter-in-law.

                                  ALEXIS
                    When do you have to be back in LA?

                                  MEREDITH
                    Tomorrow. I need to get back to my 
                    hotel and pack. But I wanted to 
                    tell you the good news.

      She moves to hug Alexis.

                    There s so much fun stuff we didn t 
                    get to do. But I ll be back soon, I 
                    promise.

      Alexis, much more relaxed knowing she can love Meredith from 
      a distance.

                                  ALEXIS
                    Can t wait.

      Meredith hugs Alexis again.

                                  MEREDITH
                    Be a good girl. And don t forget to 
                    shop.

                                  MEREDITH (CONT D)
                    Good-bye, Martha.

                                  MARTHA
                    Meredith.

      Finally, Meredith hugs Castle, gives him a kiss.

                                  MEREDITH
                    Next time... top ten.

      Castle opens the front door, Meredith sweeps out, and he 
      closes the door behind her. Castle turns to find Alexis and 
      Martha staring at him.

                                  ALEXIS
                    Okay, Dad, spill.

                                  CASTLE
                    What?

                                  ALEXIS
                    What did you do?

                                  CASTLE
                    Nothing. Oh, but my business 
                    manager had a great investment 
                      opportunity for me. A small, artsy 
                      independent feature. 

                                  MARTHA
                    That s my boy!

                                  CASTLE
                    Actually, she was perfect for the 
                    role. I m doing them the favor. I 
                    think.
                          (to Alexis)
                    Hope you don t mind.

                                  ALEXIS
                    Raising one parent s hard enough. I 
                    don t know what I d do if I had to 
                    raise two.

      Castle smiles. He loves this girl. As he pulls her into a 
      hug, we...

                                                                  FADE TO BLACK.
