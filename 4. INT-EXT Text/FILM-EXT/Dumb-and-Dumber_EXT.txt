A PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN is standing on the street corner waiting
for a bus. She's carrying books and looking very collegiate.
A black stretch LIMOUSINE with darkened windows drives past,
SLAMS ON ITS BRAKES, and backs up. The Young Woman stares at
her reflection in the windows, wondering what this is all
about.
Finally, the REAR PASSENGER WINDOW zips down, revealing LLOYD
CHRISTMAS, age 30. He's a pleasant-enough looking guy, if a
little shaggy. He's wearing a dark suit.
LLOYD
Excuse me, can you tell me how to
get to the medical school? I'm
supposed to be giving a lecture in
twenty minutes and my driver's a bit
lost.
YOUNG WOMAN
(heavy European accent)
Go straight aheads and makes a left
over za bridge.
Lloyd checks out her body.
LLOYD
I couldn't help noticing the accent.
You from Jersey?
YOUNG WOMAN
(unimpressed)
Austria.
LLOYD
Austria? You're kidding.
(mock-Australian accent)
Well, g'day, mate. What do you say
we get together later and throw a
few shrimp on the barbie.
The Young Woman turns her back to him and walks away.
LLOYD (CONT'D)
(to self)
Guess I won't be going Down Under
tonight...
He SIGHS and zips the window back up.
2.
This building is white with black spots on it, like a
DALMATION. Over the front door is an awning shaped like a
DOG'S SNOUT, whiskers included. A van pulls up outside.
The vehicle is decorated like a GIANT POODLE, with four legs
hanging off the sides, a tail in the rear, and a dog's snout
on the front grill. MUTT CUTS is written on the side of it.
HARRY DUNNE climbs out. He's in his early 30s and dressed in
a ridiculous BEAGLE COSTUME, including a CAP WITH FLOPPY
EARS. He goes to the rear of the van, opens it, and a swarm
of DOGS pile out.
HARRY
Okay, gang, single file. You know
the rules: No pushing, no humping,
and no sniffing heinies...
3.
The door to the shop opens and Harry's annoyed boss, MR.
PALMER, sticks his head out.
PALMER
Hey, why aren't those mutts on
leashes?
HARRY
The same reason you're not on a leash,
sir because it's demeaning and it
chafes like hell.
PALMER
Just get them in here now! They all
have to be bathed and clipped in an
hour.
Palmer disappears back inside. Harry CALLS to the dogs but
they pay no attention. He struggles to keep them from
wandering off. He grabs a couple of SMALL POOCHES and sits
them on a wall.
HARRY
You kids stay right here...
As he turns to round up the other, we discover that the wall
isn't a wall it's a flatbed truck. The truck drives away,
taking the two dogs with it.
HARRY (CONT'D)
(at truck)
Hey, wait a minute!
Harry chases after the vehicle.
CUT TO:
Lloyd Christmas pulls the limousine into a long, tree-lined
driveway. He gets out and looks up in awe at an IMPRESSIVE
STONE MANSION. He WHISTLES to himself, then walks to the
front oor and RINGS THE BELL.
The double-front doors of the mansion open and MARY SWANSON
appears. She's 25 and gorgeous. Lloyd's jaw drops open when
he lays eyes on her.
MARY
Hello.
(beat)
I'll be just a minute...
4.
As Mary steps back inside, Lloyd takes out a tiny can of
Binaca. He sprays his mouth, under his arms, his hair, behind
his ears...
CUT TO:
Lloyd is putting the last bags on a cart. He closes the trunk
and turns to Mary. She looks nervous and disconcerted as she
reaches into her purse. She pulls out a ten-dollar tip.
MARY
Here you go.
LLOYD
Keep it. It was my pleasure.
For the first time, Mary Swanson offers a slight smile. This
makes her more lovely than ever.
LLOYD (CONT'D)
Relax, Mary. Just get trashed and
pass out. You'll be there before you
know it.
MARY
Thanks Lloyd.
(beat)
And good luck with your worms.
7.
Then she PICKS UP HER BRIEFCASE and walks into the terminal,
followed by a PORTER pushing her bags. Lloyd watches her,
ENCHANTED, until she's out of sight.
Afterwards, he climbs back into the limo,
LOVESICK. For a
moment he doesn't even have the energy to
turn the key. He
just drops his head against the steering
wheel, DEVASTATED.
There's a TAP on the window. Lloyd looks
up to see a POLICE
OFFICER standing there.
POLICE OFFICER
Come on, move it, you're in a red
zone.
Lloyd starts the limo and pulls away.
CUT TO:
As Lloyd pulls his limo slowly away, he glances in the airport
window and SEES MARY
WALKING ALONG.
When she stops at the foot of the escalator, he stops, too.
She puts down the briefcase and checks her coat pocket for
her ticket. Lloyd's attention is distracted by a HONK. He
turns to see a car irectly behind him.
LLOYD
(to car's driver)
Drive around me, you pinhead!
When he turns back to watch Mary in the terminal he sees
that SHE'S GONE, and she's LEFT HER BRIEFCASE AT THE FOOT OF
THE STAIRS. Lloyd jumps to ATTENTION.
8.
He pulls the car into a HANDICAPPED SPOT and hops out. He
starts to run into the terminal, then notices the Police
Officer and suddenly goes into a spastic walk, limping and
dragging him leg behind him like a palsy victim.
Lloyd comes out with the briefcase, passing the two men, who
FOLLOW HIM AT A DISTANCE. He starts walking down the sidewalk
when suddenly he STOPS IN HIS TRACKS.
HIS POV - his limo is being towed away
under the supervision
of the Police Officer.
He takes off after it, but to no avail.
LLOYD
You can't do this! I'll lose my job!
As Lloyd watches the limo get towed out of site, he runs his
fingers through his hair.
CUT TO:
We see the Mutt Cuts van pull up and park at the curb. A
dejected Harry climbs out. At the same time, a taxi pulls up
and drops off Lloyd. (He's clutching Mary Swanson's
briefcase.) Both he and Harry climb the steps of the building.
They disappear inside without acknowledging each other.
9.
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET - a black Cadillac pulls up
and parks. Inside are the Armani suit and the Sportcoat.
They are J.P. SHAY and JOSEPH MENTALINO (aka JOE
MENTAL).
MENTAL
Who the hell do you figure this guy's
working for?
SHAY
I don't know, but we'd better find
out...
Mental takes some PILLS and starts CHOMPING them.
SHAY (CONT'D)
Your ulcer?
MENTAL
It ain't gonna kill me.
The poodle van pulls up to the curb in front of the building
and PARKS NEXT TO A FIRE HYDRANT. Lloyd and Harry climb out.
Lloyd takes a trash can and places it OVER THE
HYDRANT, COVERING IT COMPLETELY.
Lloyd comes out of the store with his arms full of groceries.
He stops at a newspaper machine, pulls out his WALLET and
removes a quarter.
He drops the quarter in the machine, opens it, and realizes
that he DOESN'T HAVE A FREE HAND to pick up the newspaper.
He puts his wallet inside the machine, picks up the newspaper,
and as he does so THE MACHINE SLAMS SHUT WITH HIS WALLET
STILL INSIDE.
Lloyd SIGHS, puts his grocery bags on the machine, and checks
his pockets. NO MORE CHANGE. Just then, an ELDERLY WOMAN
struggles by using a WALKER.
LLOYD
Excuse me, little old lady, do you
have change for a dollar?
ELDERLY WOMAN
Change? No, I'm sorry, I don't...
LLOYD
Well could you do me a favor and
guard this while I go break a dollar?
My wallet's locked in this machine.
15.
ELDERLY LADY
Of course, young man...
Lloyd runs back into the store. We HOLD ON THE STORE DOOR as
Lloyd EXITS a few seconds later with a handful of quarters.
Suddenly he stops in his tracks. The ELDERLY LADY, HER WALKER,
AND HIS GROCERIES ARE GONE. As he takes a closer look, he
sees that
SHE HAS TAKEN HIS WALLET ALSO.
CUT TO:
The Mutt Cutts van is going down the highway while Danny
Wilson's "Mary's Prayer" plays on the soundtrack. The van
drives past and we HOLD ON a sign that reads: "YOU ARE LEAVING
PROVIDENCE, RHODE ISLAND. COME BACK SOON." VARIOUS OTHER
AERIAL
SHOTS of the car travelling down the road while the song
continues to play.
At the bottom of the stairs leading up to the building is a
little blind boy, BILLY. He sits in a wheelchair playing
with a PARAKEET WHOSE HEAD IS SCOTCH-TAPED ON. He throws the
ead bird up, but it flops into his lap.
BILLY
Fly!
Joe Mental and J.P. Shay approach and climb the steps.
CUT TO:
CLOSE ON A NOTE - taped to Harry and Lloyd's apartment door.
It reads: TO ALL OUR
LOVED ONES - PACKED UP AND DROVE TO ASPEN - HAVE A NICE LIFE -
LLOYD AND HARRY.
PULLBACK to reveal Joe Mental and J.P. Shay.
MENTAL
Those bastards. They're rubbing it
right in our faces.
J.P. SHAY
Shit! Andre will have a goddamn
aneurysm if we don't get that
briefcase back.
MENTAL
Don't
worry, we'll get it back. And
I'll
tell you something else. They
ain't
gonna reach Aspen, either.
I'll
make sure of that.
Mental takes out more ANTACID PILLS and starts to chew on
them.
A pissed-off Shay and Mental EXIT the building. Mental pops
more antacid pills into his mouth as they descend the stairs.
Little Billy is still tossing the lifeless parakeet into the
air.
22.
BILLY
Come on, boy, fly!
Plop. Then Billy hears Shay and Mental on the steps and CALLS
OUT:
BILLY (CONT'D)
Excuse me, mister. Is there something
wrong with my bird?
Mental picks up the bird, studies it, then angrily and WINGS
IT DOWN THE STREET as hard as he can.
MENTAL
Don't worry, Ironside, he just flew
south for the winter.
CUT TO:
The Mutt Cutt van is sandwiched between mountainous tractor-
trailer trucks.
24.
J.P. Shay is at the gas pump filling the black Cadillac while
Joe Mental stretches his legs. A large truck pulls away,
REVEALING THE PREVIOUSLY HIDDEN MUTT CUTTS VAN. Mental smiles
at this, and we
CUT TO:
The front door BURSTS OPEN and a red-faced Sea Bass STORMS
OUT, followed by his buddies, the Cashier, and the Waitress.
SEA BASS
I'm gonna kill those sons-of-bitches!
CASHIER
Hurry and you'll catch 'em. They was
on their way to Rhode Island.
The Truckers jump in their rigs and RUMBLE AWAY
in the
OPPOSITE DIRECTION our boys are headed.
CUT TO:
The Mutt Cutts van breezes by.
As the Mutt Cutts van travels down the highway, it passes a
STATE TROOPER on a motorcycle hidden in the bushes. The
Trooper takes off after them.
The STATE TROOPER is walking up beside the stopped Mutt Cutts
van, staring at it with isapproval.
STATE TROOPER
License and registration, please.
Harry hands him the papers.
STATE TROOPER (CONT'D)
You know, you fellas were all over
the road back there.
HARRY
Yes, sir, we had a little... ifficulty
in the car.
STATE TROOPER
Uh-huh.
(beat)
Have you boys been doing a little
rinking maybe?
HARRY
No, sir.
32.
STATE TROOPER
Then what's that?
He points to the OPEN, FULL BEER BOTTLES hidden in the seat
between them.
HARRY
Oh, that's nothing, sir.
STATE TROOPER
Do you know it's against the law to
rive with an open alcohol container
in this state?
LLOYD
But, your honor, he's telling the
truth. It's not beer.
The officer smirks.
STATE TROOPER
Is that right?
The Trooper reaches in and picks up one of the bottles. He
inspects the beer label, then MOVES
THE BOTTLE TO HIS LIPS.
HARRY
Sir, I wouldn't TROOPER --You'd keep
your mouth shut if you knew what was
good for you.
LLOYD
(under breath)
YOU WOULD, TOO...
Harry shoots Lloyd a look as the Trooper begins GULPING down
the piss. He pauses uncertainly and a SICK LOOK COMES OVER
HIS FACE. He takes a DEEP BREATH. Then:
STATE TROOPER
(pained)
Get the hell out of here.
CUT TO:
The Mutt Cutts van is pulling back onto the highway while
the officer remains in the breakdown lane with his hands on
his knees.
CUT TO:
33.
The van is making steady progress through the dark night.
The Mutt Cutts van is parked outside this seedy establishment.
A neon sign blinks: GROUP
DISCOUNTS - HAVE YOUR NEXT AFFAIR HERE.
HARRY
(v.o.)
I don't know, Lloyd, I feel a little
sleazy staying here when we're not
even engaged.
LLOYD
(v.o.)
Hey, it's the only motel that charges
by the hour. We can't afford anything
else.
We see that the black Cadillac is
parked a few cars over
from the Mutt Cutts van with J.P.
Shay in the passenger seat.
PAN OVER to a payphone. Inside is
Joe Mental. Outside the
booth, an ANXIOUS MAN impatiently
paces back and forth as he
waits for the phone.
MENTAL
(into phone)
The boys are holed-up in a little
love nest for the night. I think
they're a couple of fucking weirdos.
ESTABLISHING SHOT of a luxurious mountainside home.
38.
The black Cadillac pulls over to the side of the road. Joe
Mental gets out of the car and props the hood open. He takes
out his gun, SLIDES IN A NEW CLIP, and puts it back in his
pocket.
MENTAL
(to Shay)
Lie down on the front seat. After
they pick me up I want you to follow
us.
Then he folds his arms and the two killers wait for the van
to come along.
CUT TO:
Joe Mental squints down the road, sees the Mutt Cutts van
approaching, and starts WAVING HIS HANDS to flag them down.
As an angry Mental watches them disappear down the road,
Shay sits up in the front seat.
SHAY
What happened?
MENTAL
These fuckers are really pissing me
off now.
CUT TO:
We hear The Zombie's 'Time of the Season' as the van flashes
by.
41.
The Mutt Cutt car is at the drive-through window.
MCDONALD'S EMPLOYEE
...That's two cheese burgers, two fries,
and two medium Cokes. Five seventy-
two.
Harry hands a ten-dollar-bill to the Employee, who returns a
handful of change.
HARRY
Thanks.
42.
Then, before he can
give them
the bag of food, the guys
absentmindedly DRIVE
OFF. As
they pull out of the parking
lot, the McDonald's
Employee
sticks his head out the window
and WAVES THE BAG OF
FOOD at
them.
MCDONALD'S EMPLOYEE
Hey!
But the guys are already around the corner.
The Mutt Cutt van is on the road again, cruising along.
A large neon road sign beside the caf shows a man's
exasperated face with FLAMES SHOOTING FROM HIS NOSE, MOUTH
AND EARS. The sign advertises: HOTTEST CHILI
46.
PEPPERS NORTH OF THE BORDER.
Mental is on the phone outside the front door TALKING to
Nicholas Andre.
INTERCUT CONVERSATION
MENTAL
It's Mental. I'm just sitting down
to a nice meal with our boys.
ANDRE
Good work. What did you find out so
far?
MENTAL
Nothing yet, but I'm gonna shake 'em
own for information at lunch.
(beat)
Then I'm gonna kill 'em for dessert.
ANDRE
Well eat fast, time's running out.
And whatever you do, don't let them get any closer. I don't
need them here running around Aspen.
Mental pulls a BLACK VIAL OF PILLS out of his jacket.
MENTAL
Relax, they ain't gonna be running
around anywhere after I dump a little
cyanide in their pops.
As the Mutt Cutts van flashes by on it's westward journey,
we
CUT TO:
A DOCTOR is covering up the body of Joe Mental as he TALKS
to DETECTIVE DALE. The etective is a no-nonsense type in his
mid-forties with a military-regulation crewcut.
51.
DOCTOR
...My official conclusion is that the
eceased expired from oxygen eprivation
caused by the presence of cyanide in
the bloodstream.
DT. DALE
You mean he was poisoned?
DOCTOR
Unquestionably. We found these by
the body.
He holds up the container of cyanide pills. Dt. Dale nods
and approaches another COP in the b.g.
COP
Waitress says he was with a couple
of younger guys. They're the ones
who called the ambulance then they
hit the road.
DT. DALE
Any idea where they were going?
COP
A witness at the next table thought
he heard them say they were driving
to France.
Dale frowns at this and the Cop shrugs.
COP (CONT'D)
We got a report they were seen heading
west on I-80 toward Colorado.
DT. DALE
Get a make on the vehicle?
The Cop consults his note pad.
COP
Yes, sir. They were driving an '84
poodle.
Dt. Dale does a double-take.
DT. DALE
An '84 what?
52.
COP
(straight-faced)
Well it might have been a wire-haired
terrier, Detective. They're very
similar in appearance.
The Detective looks confused, as we
CUT TO:
A frightened J.P. Shay is TALKING on the phone with Nicholas
Andre.
SHAY
You heard me, he's dead. The bastards
killed him.
The Mutt Cutts van cruises down the lonely interstate.
The Mutt Cutts van pulls up to a gas pump. In the background
are several tractor-trailer rigs and a caf. Harry climbs
out, thoroughly exhausted, walks around and opens the
passenger door.
Lloyd tumbles to the asphalt, STILL ASLEEP. Harry nudges him
with his foot.
HARRY
Come on, wake up. You pay, I'll pump.
Lloyd comes to and grudgingly pulls himself up to his feet.
Harry moves to the back of the poodle van. He has to LIFT
ONE OF THE CAR'S REAR LEGS to unscrew the gas cap. Then he
sticks the nozzle in and starts to fill her up.
55.
Lloyd comes around the
corner, dragging a BATHROOM KEY
ATTACHED BY A CHAIN TO
A CAR ENGINE toward the Men's Room.
When he gets it to the
door, he struggles to lift the engine
on it's side, finally
managing to slip the key into the lock.
Harry is yawning as he pumps the gas. Suddenly a Jeep Cherokee
pulls up and a long-legged, tanned, ATHLETIC BEAUTY climbs
out. This seems to wake Harry up.
The Athletic Beauty
smiles at Harry as she grabs a pump and
starts to fill her
jeep. Harry makes a feeble attempt to
brush his hair into
place, then CLEARS HIS THROAT and nods
to the skis on her
roof-rack.
HARRY
Skis, huh?
ATHLETIC BEAUTY
That's right.
HARRY
Great.
She continues to pump gas.
HARRY (CONT'D)
They yours?
ATHLETIC BEAUTY
Uh-huh..
HARRY
Both of 'em?
ATHLETIC BEAUTY
Um, yeah.
HARRY
(impressed)
Cool.
THE GAS FROM HARRY'S NOZZLE STARTS TO OVERFLOW, BUT HE DOESN'T
NOTICE. FROM HER POV IT LOOKS
like a BIG DOG IS PISSING ON HIS LEG.
ATHLETIC BEAUTY
Excuse me, you're spraying everywhere.
56.
Harry turns to see the gas GUSHING ALL OVER HIS SHOES. He
immediately removes the nozzle and replaces it on the pump
as she smiles to herself.
The Athletic Beauty is back in her Jeep now and Harry has
sidled up to the driver's side. He leans against her side-
view mirror.
57.
HARRY
(re: suitcases in
back seat)
That's a lot of luggage for a little
vacation.
ATHLETIC BEAUTY
Actually, I'm moving to Aspen. I've
got to get away from my boyfriend.
He's such a klutz. My astrologer told me I should avoid
accident-prone guys.
Just then, the side-view mirror Harry has been leaning on
SNAPS OFF THE CAR. HE CRACKS
HIS HEAD AGAINST THE WINDSHIELD, FALLS TO THE GROUND, THEN
QUICKLY LEAPS TO HIS FEET AS IF NOTHING HAPPENED.
HARRY
(holding out mirror)
Here, this is a little loose.
She throws the mirror into the back seat and takes out a
cigarette.
HARRY (CONT'D)
Allow me...
He pulls out a match and lights it with a debonair flourish.
The Athletic Beauty nods her thanks. Harry tosses the match
to the ground, and we hear an O.S. WHOOSH! Wisps of smokes
rise around him and we hear the LOW CRACKLE OF SOMETHING
BURNING. (Neither of them notice this.)
HARRY (CONT'D)
Look, um, maybe when I get to Aspen
we can meet up... you know, for hot
chocolate or something.
She looks him over and smiles.
ATHLETIC BEAUTY
Why not? You seem pretty harmless.
I'll give you my number. Just let me
find a pen.
As she starts to rummage through her purse, Harry SMELLS THE
SMOKE. He looks down and sees that his RIGHT SHOE IS ABLAZE!
He shakes it, then tries to put it out with the other shoe,
but to no avail. Meanwhile, the Athletic Beauty is still
searching for a pen.
58.
ATHLETIC BEAUTY (CONT'D)
I know I have one here somewhere...
Harry starts doing a soft-shoe dance to extinguish the flames.
This only helps to fan them.
HARRY
(urgently)
Look, why don't you just tell it to
me, I've got a good memory.
ATHLETIC BEAUTY
Are you sure you won't forget?
HARRY
(desperate)
Positive please hurry.
He begins hopping around violently.
ATHLETIC BEAUTY
Is something wrong?
Harry shakes his head no as he bites his lip to keep from
screaming.
ATHLETIC BEAUTY (CONT'D)
Okay, my number is 652-2553.
(beat)
Oh, wait a second, that's my old
number. It's so funny how your mind
god sakes, give me the damn number!
She's taken aback by this outburst.
ATHLETIC BEAUTY (CONT'D)
Look, man, if you're gonna get pushy
you can just forget it!
She throws the car into drive and PEELS AWAY.
ESTABLISHING SHOT of a mini mart.
Lloyd starts the engine and
pulls out of the parking lot to
the nearby freeway entrance.
As he enters the on-ramp, we
ZOOM IN on a sign that says:
ROUTE 80 - EAST. He's unwittingly
headed BACK IN THE DIRECTION
THEY JUST CAME FROM!
DISSOLVE TO:
The Mutt Cutts van is parked next to a couple rigs and Harry
is sitting beside it on the pavement, a BROKEN man.
LLOYD
I'm only human, Harry. Anybody can
make a mistake.
But Harry just sits there, practically catatonic.
LLOYD (CONT'D)
Come on, man, pull yourself together.
HARRY
You know, I got half a mind to just
jump on the bus to Europe and say
goodbye to your ugly mug forever.
LLOYD
(rolls his eyes)
You can't take a bus to Europe, dodo.
HARRY
Oh yeah? Why not?
LLOYD
You don't have a passport.
Harry lets out a defeated SIGH.
LLOYD (CONT'D)
Come on, stop being a baby about
this. Okay, so we back-tracked a
tad.
HARRY
A tad? Lloyd, you drove almost a
sixth of the way across the country
in the wrong direction. Now we don't
have enough money to get to Aspen,
we on't have enough money to get
home, we don't have enough to eat,
we don't have enough to sleep!
64.
LLOYD
Well it doesn't do any good having
you sitting there on your butt whining
about it. If we're gonna get out of
this hole, we're gonna have to dig
ourselves out.
Harry thinks about this.
HARRY
You know, you're absolutely right,
Lloyd.
He stands up, brushes off his pants, and starts to walk toward
the highway.
LLOYD
Where you going?
HARRY
Home. I'm walking home.
LLOYD
You can't be serious.
HARRY
(sarcastic)
Why not? We're probably only five
miles away.
Harry starts resolutely toward the road while Lloyd watches.
LLOYD
(CALLING OUT)
Thanks a lot, Mr. Perfect. Like you
never screwed up.
Harry suddenly STOPS IN HIS TRACKS and turns back to his
friend. He seems completely rained.
HARRY
Look, man... I'm sorry.
(beat)
I never should have let you talk me
into this in the first place. You've
got a good reason to goo a beautiful
girl's waiting for you. But let's
face it, Lloyd, there's nothing
waiting for me in Aspen.
(beat)
There's nothing waiting for me
anywhere.
65.
Lloyd just stands there, SPEECHLESS, as Harry turns and walks
away. Out of frustration, he BANGS the snout of the car,
causing it to BARK.
CUT TO:
Harry is walking down the highway, his thumb stuck out
unenthusiastically. A few cars WHIZ by, the cold wind whipping
at his clothes.
A station wagon blows by and throws a BAG
OF GARBAGE out the
window. It lands at Harry's feet. EXTREME
CLOSE-UP OF HARRY'S
FACE - a TEAR slowly rolls down his cheek
(like the Indian
in the commercial). PAN DOWN to the bag of
garbage. We see
it's a BAG OF ONIONS that's ripped open.
Suddenly a HEARSE pulls up and stops. It's an ominous-looking
vehicle and Harry hesitates. Then the passenger window rolls
down, revealing a contrite Lloyd at the wheel.
LLOYD
Got room for one more, if you still
want to go to Aspen.
Harry looks the hearse over.
HARRY
Where'd you find this baby?
LLOYD
Used car dealer. I
traded the van
for it. Plus I got
the guy to throw
in fifty bucks for
gas money.
(beat)
Come on, man, what
do you say? We
still partners?
HARRY SMILES AND WE
CUT TO:
An impatient Detective Dale is still staked-out at the
Colorado border with several other officers.
DT. DALE
It doesn't make sense. They should've
been here hours ago.
COP
Maybe they're smarter than we thought.
66.
DT. DALE
How smart can they be? They're riving
a goddamn dog!
Another COP rushes over holding his walkie-talkie.
COP #2
We just got a report that they were
spotted about two hours ago heading
east near Des Moines on I-80.
DT. DALE
(incredulous)
Des Moines?! Why that's five hundred
miles from here!
COP #1
Guess they got wind of our welcoming
party.
DT. DALE
We're wasting time. Let's mobilize.
Dt. Dale heads for his cruiser while the other Cops follow.
As the officers climb into their cars, we
CUT TO:
Harry and Lloyd are swerving through traffic in the hearse.
Ahead of them is a REAL FUNERAL PROCESSION. The lead car is
a CADILLAC.
While the couple ARGUES ON, Harry and Lloyd cut in front of
them. The Man and the Woman on't notice this an soon the
ENTIRE FUNERAL PROCESSION IS UNWITTINGLY
FOLLOWING THE WRONG HEARSE.
CUT TO:
Harry and Lloyd pull up to a large green dumpster behind the
market. The procession comes to a halt behind them. The guys
get out of the hearse and remove the coffin from the back.
Then they unceremoniously HEAVE THE COFFIN INTO THE DUMPSTER
AND WIPE THEIR HANDS
OFF.
ON THE LEAD CAR OF THE PROCESSION - The Woman's jaw is
practically on the floor.
WOMAN
You son-of-a-bitch! I want a ivorce!
CUT TO:
QUICK MONTAGE OF THE HEARSE WEAVING IT'S WAY THROUGH THE
SCENIC ROCKIES AS WE REPRISE 'MARY'S PRAYER' BY DANNY WILSON.
DISSOLVE TO:
The hearse drives past a sign that says ENTERING ASPEN,
COLORADO.
CUT TO:
The boys stroll down the sidewalk, looking in the windows,
studying the passersby, taking in the sights and sounds of
the ski town.
69.
LLOYD
Isn't this wonderful? What more could
a couple of single guys like us ask
for?
HARRY
How about food and shelter?
LLOYD
You're so materialistic.
(beat)
Why don't we get down to business
and eliver the briefcase to Mary.
Who knows, maybe she'll invite us in
for tea and a strumpet or two?
HARRY
Jolly good idea, chap. And where oes
the lovely young lady reside?
LLOYD
Um... good question.
Harry throws Lloyd a concerned look, but then notices a phone
booth next to them.
HARRY
Well what's her last name? We'll
look it up in the phone book.
LLOYD
Hmmmm... You know, I don't believe I
caught that either.
Harry's concern grows.
HARRY
What about the briefcase, Lloyd?
There must've been a name on it,
right?
LLOYD
(brightening)
Come to think of it, there is. It's
engraved right into the leather.
HARRY
What is it?
LLOYD
Samsonite
spelled just like it
sounds.
70.
Harry starts flipping through the phone book. Then abruptly
HE STOPS and puts the book down, a DEFEATED look on his face.
CUT TO:
Harry gets out and leans against the car with his arms
crossed. Lloyd comes from around the other side.
LLOYD
What are you worrying about now?
HARRY
I'm worried about how you're gonna
survive the pummeling I'm about to
give you.
LLOYD
Huh?
Suddenly Harry LUNGES at Lloyd, who takes off around the
other side of the car. Harry leaps across the hood, but Lloyd
manages to evade his grasp.
72.
LLOYD (CONT'D)
Harry, calm down! You're acting like
a wild animal!
HARRY
Get over here and take your medicine,
Lloyd!
LLOYD
Sorry, doc, I can't take medicine.
I'm a Christian Scientist!
Lloyd continues to outrun him around the car. Frustrated,
Harry opens the car and PULLS THE
BRIEFCASE OUT.
LLOYD (CONT'D)
What are you doing?
HARRY
Something I should've done a long
time ago. This stupid thing has been
the root of our problems all along.
Harry starts walking toward the bridge spanning a river.
LLOYD
Don't do anything foolish, Harry.
HARRY
Foolish? This is the most sensible
thing I've done in years. I'm gonna
toss this goddamn curse right into
that river.
Lloyd starts to follow after Harry.
LLOYD
You're making a big mistake, Harry!
I'll never forgive you for this!
Harry keeps marching toward the bridge, determined to dispose
of the briefcase.
LLOYD (CONT'D)
Harry, hold up! Things are gonna get
better, I promise! In fact, I think
I feel another piece of Beef Jerky in my left molar! It's
yours, Harry, all yours!
Harry stops in his tracks, intrigued.
73.
HARRY
You're bluffing.
LLOYD
No I'm not, man look.
Lloyd pulls his cheek back, revealing a molar. Harry squints
at it.
HARRY
That's a filling, you liar!
Just then, Lloyd makes a dash at Harry. Harry turns and runs,
but Lloyd TACKLES HIM as they reach the bridge. The briefcase
GOES FLYING, and the guys wrestle pitifully with one another
in the snow, rolling over and over.
Finally, Harry manages to get the upper hand. He climbs on
top and CLASPS HIS HANDS
AROUND LLOYD'S THROAT.
HARRY (CONT'D)
I used to have a life! A miserable
one, but a life, nonetheless!
Suddenly Lloyd's EYES LIGHT UP as he sees something O.S.
behind his friend.
LLOYD
(CHOKED VOICE)
Harry, look!
Harry turns and HIS EYES LIGHT UP, TOO. He lets go of Lloyd
as we see
THEIR POV - THE BRIEFCASE IS LYING BUSTED OPEN ON THE GROUND,
REVEALING STACKS AND
STACKS OF BIG, BEAUTIFUL HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS!
CUT TO:
Harry and Lloyd are hurrying down the sidewalk, clutching
the briefcase. The city is lit up with millions of tiny
lights, like a fantasy winter wonderland.
LLOYD
Okay, here's the plan: We borrow a
few bucks just a small loan from
the briefcase, and we check into a
cheap motel.
74.
HARRY
Sounds good.
LLOYD
And we'll keep track of the money we
spend with IOUs.
HARRY
We'll be meticulous
right down to
the last penny.
LLOYD
That way, whatever we borrow we can
pay back.
HARRY
Absolutely. We're good for it.
LLOYD
You know, as soon as we get jobs.
HARRY
It'll come right out of our first
paycheck.
CUT TO:
Helen Swanson is KNOCKING on her step-daughter's bedroom
door. She's holding a tray with a couple of mugs on it.
HELEN
Mary? You awake?
MARY
(o.s.)
COME IN...
The Guys pull up to the front of the hotel in the hearse.
Several HOTEL EMPLOYEES rush to help them. Harry and Lloyd
get out wearing OVERLY TRENDY SKI GARB, complete with fur
boots, NASA designed goggles, and splashy fluorescent colors
everywhere. The Employees all grab the shopping bags and
then line up as Lloyd TIPS THEM ALL handsomely.
Throngs of GUESTS in black-tie and elegant gowns are entering
the building. Suddenly the hearse pulls up with Harry and
Lloyd BUMPER SURFING BEHIND IT. Harry's wearing his blue
tuxedo. Lloyd's tux isn't any better it's pumpkin orange.
(THEY'VE GOT MATCHING TOP HATS AND CANES.) When the hearse
stops, the boys hand the driver Barnard a couple hundred
dollars.
LLOYD
Thanks for the lift, Barney.
A jubilant Lloyd is fixing his hair in the mirror. In the
b.g., Harry is putting on his new ski clothes including a
pair of thermal tights.
LLOYD
Mrs. Christmas... Mary Christmas... Mrs.
Mary Christmas. You
know, it has kind of a ring to it, oesn't it, Har?
HARRY
Sounds nice, Lloyd, but don't you
think you may be jumping the gun a
little? I mean, who knows, when you
get to know her, you may find out
she's not your type.
LLOYD
Impossible. I know my type
when I
see it. Now let me get this
straight,
she wants me to meet her at
the
Avalanche Bar and Grill on
Main
Street?
HARRY
That's what she said. Ten o'clock
sharp.
This is when Lloyd notices Harry's get-up.
93.
LLOYD
Time out. Where are going ressed
like that.
HARRY
I, uh, thought while you were making
your love connection I'd try my luck
on the slopes.
LLOYD
You mean you're gonna go out in public
dressed in tights?
HARRY
These aren't tights. They're
fashionable Euro-trash ski trousers.
LLOYD
But you can see the outline of your
who-who.
Harry looks down at his crotch.
HARRY
Really?
LLOYD
Turn sideways.
Harry turns his profile against the window.
LLOYD (CONT'D)
Actually, it's just a tiny little
lump. No one will ever notice.
HARRY
You're right. I can't go out dressed
like this.
CUT TO:
ESTABLISHING SHOT of the building.
Harry and Mary are at the front of the lift line. The couple
ahead of them get on a chair, and then they shuffle into
position. Harry crouches nervously, waiting for the chair.
The chair swings around, comes up behind them, and makes a
smooth pick up of Mary, that is. An embarrassed Harry is
STILL IN THE CROUCHING POSITION, having missed the ride.
Mary looks back at him, confused. Suddenly he pretends to be
stretching.
HARRY
(CALLING OUT)
You take the first run alone. I'm
gonna loosen up down here.
CUT TO:
Harry and Mary are now sitting together on a chair as it
rises higher and higher toward the imposing mountain top.
Harry holds onto the chair's frame nervously.
MARY
Beautiful day, huh, Harry?
95.
HARRY
Glorious.
Mary takes a DEEP BREATH.
MARY
God, it feels so good to get up here.
I haven't been outdoors much in the
last couple of weeks.
HARRY
Why not?
MARY
(evasive)
There's been... family problems. I
on't want to bore you with them.
HARRY
Thanks.
He looks mindlessly off in the distance. Then Harry notices
a PATCH OF FROST on the chair lift bar.
HARRY (CONT'D)
Oh, look... frost.
He licks it and his TONGUE IMMEDIATELY FUSES WITH THE FROZEN
METAL. He tugs a few times, but it won't budge.
MARY
Are you okay?
HARRY
(lisping)
Sure. I do this all the time...
CUT TO:
As Mary and Harry arrive at the top of the lift, Mary
disembarks but Harry stays on.
HARRY
(lisping)
See ya at the bottom...
Harry and the chair lift swing around and start heading down
the hill.
CUT TO:
96.
The chair lift comes back around with Harry still sitting on
it, stuck to the bar. Two LITTLE KIDS climb on with him.
HARRY
(lisping)
Hi.
(off their looks)
Say, kids, you wouldn't happen to
have a cup of warm water, would you?
The two kids just stare at him.
CUT TO:
Mary gracefully carves her way to the bottom of the hill and
stops with a snow-spraying flourish. She looks around the
outdoor patio for Harry. She spots something and does a DOUBLE-
TAKE.
97.
MARY'S POV - HARRY IS SITTING AT A TABLE, STILL ATTACHED TO
THE CHAIR LIFT (WHICH
has been removed from the cable). He's drinking a cup of
coffee and trying to act nonchalant, espite the gawking of
the other SKIERS. There's a MIME performing in the b.g.
BACK TO SCENE
MARY
My god. Harry, are you okay?
HARRY
(lisping)
I'm fine, I'm fine. It'll come off.
CUT TO:
CLOSE UP of Harry's head through a RIFLE SCOPE. REVERSE ANGLE
to reveal J.P. Shay a few hundred feet up the hill with a
high-powered rifle trained on Harry.
SHAY
You're luck just ran out, pal.
As his trigger finger TWITCHES with anticipation, we go
BACK TO SCENE
MARY
This is silly. Let me help you...
Mary gets up and stands behind Harry. He MOANS nervously.
She grabs his head in both hands and starts pulling it away
from the bar. We see HARRY'S TONGUE STRETCH RIDICULOUSLY...
FIVE INCHES... SIX... THEN EIGHT. Harry GROANS in pain. Suddenly,
his TONGUE COMES UNDONE and Harry and Mary fall backwards
out of the path of J.P. Shay's bullet as it WHIZZES BY. We
hear the Mime in the b.g. CRY OUT in pain:
MIME
GODDAMN IT! WHAT THE FUCK?!
The poor Mime holds his bleeding hand and retreats nervously
into the lodge as the CROWD BOOS him.
CUT TO:
The hearse pulls up to the house and stops.
The hearse parks on the street and Harry gets out. He's
walking up the steps to the house when we hear more GASEOUS
THUNDER from his stomach. Harry stops in his tracks, gets
his insides under control, and continues to the front porch,
where he RINGS the bell.
Mary answers the door, fiddling with her earrings.
MARY
Hi. Come on in.
A confused Mary is standing outside the bathroom door.
MARY
Shaving?
HARRY
(o.s.)
Yeah! I was running a little late.
Thought this would save time.
MARY
Okay. Well I'll be in the living
room whenever you're ready.
Mary's sitting patiently on the couch with her legs crossed.
She looks at her watch, then flips on the TV.
ON THE TUBE - the news is on. A WOMAN REPORTER is addressing
the CAMERA gravely:
REPORTER
We'll be back in a minute with the
story of the blind Indiana boy who
was duped into buying a dead parakeet.
We see Billy the blind boy from apartment 4-C sitting in
his wheelchair, holding up Petey the parakeet with its head
Scotch taped on its body.
BLIND BOY
...I thought he was real quiet...
104.
The Reporter shakes her head and they go to a commercial.
Mary SHIVERS at this and turns off the television. Suddenly
the DOORBELL RINGS. She gets up and opens the front door.
HER POV - a dapper Lloyd is standing there in his new Aspen-
chic clothes.
MARY
Yes...?
LLOYD
Hi.
(beat)
Don't you remember me?
MARY
Um... I'm not really...
LLOYD
South Bend. I drove you to the airport
last week.
MARY
(dawning on her)
Oh my god. Lloyd, right?
Lloyd is thrilled at this.
LLOYD
You remembered.
MARY
What are you doing in Aspen?
LLOYD
I brought you your briefcase You
left it at the airport so I picked
it up for you.
Mary's MOUTH DROPS OPEN.
MARY
You're the one who took my briefcase?
LLOYD
Yeah, it's back at my hotel room.
Come on, let's take a ride. I'll
give it to you.
Mary is torn between getting her briefcase and waiting for
Harry.
MARY
Wait right here.
105.
She goes to the bathroom door. Inside we hear the LOUD
CLANKING of metal against metal.
MARY (CONT'D)
Harry, what are you doing in there?
The Jaguar pulls up in front of the hotel. As Lloyd and Mary
get out, we PAN OVER to reveal that they were being followed
by Nicholas Andre and J.P. Shay in a Mercedes.
106.
There's a swarm of ONLOOKERS as Andre and J.P. Shay are
hustled into a police car and driven away. While Mary TALKS
to the police, Harry and Lloyd stare at her lovingly.
LLOYD
She's something, ain't she, Har?
HARRY
You were right, Lloyd. She was
efinitely worth the trip.
LLOYD
Guess we have to admit it, she was
too good for us.
Just then, a cruiser pulls up and Mary's husband jumps out.
MELVIN
Oh god, baby, I missed you!
Harry and Lloyd stare in wonder as MEL GIBSON climbs out of
the car. Mary and Mel embrace, then Mel turns to the guys.
117.
MELVIN (CONT'D)
I can't thank you enough, fellas. It
was so darn dank in that well, I
really thought it would be the death
of me.
Harry and Lloyd are too stunned to respond. They look at
each other, and we
DISSOLVE TO:
Lloyd and Harry come out of the elevator with their meager
luggage, but this time nobody rushes to their aid.
The guys EXIT the hotel and approach the Bell Captain,
Barnard.
HARRY
Hey, Barney...
BELL CAPTAIN
Yes, gentlemen?
LLOYD
Look, we just wanted to say that we
appreciate all you did for us during
our stay.
HARRY
And we're, um, sorry about the money
we gave you turning out to be phony.
BELL CAPTAIN
Don't worry about it, gentlemen. The
Swanson family has promised to
reimburse everyone.
This seems to please Lloyd and Harry. The hearse is delivered
to the front door.
LLOYD
Well, anyway, thanks again for
everything.
They turn to go, but Barnard CALLS TO THEM:
BARNARD
Where are you two headed?
118.
HARRY
I dunno. I'm sure we'll find a trailer
camp somewhere to call home.
BARNARD
Why not right here?
Harry and Lloyd look at each other, confused.
LLOYD
This joint is a little out of our
budget, Barney.
BARNARD
(smiling)
Oh, I think we might be able to find
you a free room somewhere -- after
all, like you once told me, we're
all from the same mold.
(winks)
You just don't have any dough right
now.
The guys are STUNNED by Barnard's generous offer.
HARRY
Are you on the level?
BARNARD
Absolutely. We'll just slide you
into one of the employee rooms...
The guys beam at this.
BARNARD (CONT'D)
...Provided, of course, you don't
mind working one or two afternoons a
week.
Harry and Lloyd lock eyes. Then:
LLOYD
You know what, Barney, I think we'll
take out chances down the road.
Barnard shakes his head as the two fools climb into their
hearse and drive off.
As the hearse drives down the road, we hear V.O.:
119.
HARRY
(v.o.)
Since we're finished elbow-rubbing,
what next, lloyd?
LLOYD
(v.o.)
I say we head due south and try a
little nose-rubbing with some of
them slinky eskimo babes.
HARRY
(v.o.)
Now you're talking my language. You
know I got a weakness for blondes.
As they head toward their next adventure, the CAMERA PULLS
UP, UP, UP...
