      EXT. FULL MOON - NIGHT (STOCK)

    An ominous full moon hangs in the night sky, portending only 
    one thing -- this episode s gonna have a monster in it.

      EXT. MOUNTAIN TRAIL - NIGHT

      Somewhere in the foliage, heavy guttural BREATHING is heard, 
    as two silhouetted figures (hunched shouldered, wild, out-of-
      control hair) appear in view.  As these creatures (monsters?) 
      begin GRUNTING, they come through a clearing, revealing only 
      a couple of STONERS (#1 and #2), giggling stupidly.

                                  STONER #1
                    Dude, don t make me laugh like that  
                    -- the glue almost came out my 
                    nose!  Whoa -- look at that moon!   

                                  STONER #2
                    Dude!

      Stoner #2 has looked up, but in the wrong direction.  Stoner 
    #1 nudges him towards the  real  moon, which causes Stoner #2 
    to do a double take.  They stare hypnotically for a while.

                                  STONER #1
                    Dude, what would you do if I turned 
                    into a werewolf right now, and tore 
                    your head off?

                                  STONER #2
                    How would you get home?

                                  STONER #1
                    I d take your car.

                                  STONER #2
                    Werewolves can t drive.

                                  STONER #1
                    I d only be half wolf.  The  were  
                    half would still know how to drive.

                                  STONER #2
                    A stick shift?!

      Stoner #1 nods, defeated. Suddenly, a non-human SHRIEK and a 
      human SCREAM, erupts o.s.  The stoners exchange nervous looks 
      before heading towards the noises.  Parting through some 
      shrubbery, they come upon a tableau of terror.        NIGHT STALKER   "THE M WORD"  PREP DRAFT   11/11/2005  2.



      A man (PARK RANGER) is being attacked by a ... well, we don t 
    get a good look at it, but the man-size creature looks 
      reptilian, resembling a horned lizard (including, obviously, 
      some occipital horns).  Its features also have a humanness to 
      them, in the manner of Jack Pierce s classic Universal make-
    up designs of yore.  In short -- it s a MONSTER! 

                                  STONER #1 & #2 
                    Dude!

    The Monster, belting out a hiss-like SHRIEK, releases its 
      victim, and darts straight towards the stoners, who dive for 
      safety.  After a moments pause, with neither one of them 
      hurt, they regard each other.

                                  STONER #2
                    Did that just happen?

      Stoner #1 gets up, and followed by his colleague, moves to 
    the blood-covered attack victim, kneeling down over him.

                                  STONER #1
                    Dude, are you okay?

                                  RANGER
                    Yeah, I think so. 

                                  STONER #2     
                    Dude, are you okay?

                                  RANGER
                    Yeah, I m all right.

                                  STONER #2
                    Dude, are you okay?

                                  STONER #1
                    Dude, he just said he s okay.

                                  STONER #2
                    No, not this dude -- thisdude. 

      Stoner #1 and the Ranger now look over and see that Stoner #2 
    is addressing another person lying nearby.

                                  STONER #1
                    Dude, I don t think that dude s 
                    okay.

      CAMERA MOVES TO REVEAL the exposed rib cage of this other, 
      LIFELESS VICTIM.  His upper torso appears ... devoured.

                                  ACT ONE

      EXT. MOUNTAIN TRAIL - DAY

      ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICERS mix with POLICE OFFICERS as the dead 
      body is lifted into an ambulance by EMTs.  A small crowd of 
      BYSTANDERS (HIKERS, MOUNTAIN BIKERS) looks on in concern.

    The Park Ranger, a ruggedly handsome man with a wide gap in 
    his front teeth, leans against his truck, still shaken from 
    his attack, but robust enough to answer questions from REED.

                                  RANGER
                    I was informing him the trails were 
                    closed after sundown, and started 
                    lecturing about how dangerous it 
                    was to be hiking up here alone at 
                    this time of the night, when ... 
                    wouldn t you know it? 

                                  REED
                    When did you first see the lion?

                                  RANGER
                    To be honest, I never did.  Cougars 
                    ambush their prey from behind -- I 
                    now know from experience.

                                  REED
                    What were you doing while the lion 
                    was attacking the hiker?

                                  RANGER
                    I m afraid I was unconscious.  I 
                    only came to later.  I just wish I 
                    could have done more to save him.

                                  REED
                    You were trying to warn him, and 
                    you risked your life to do it.  
                    That makes you a hero in my book.

                                  RANGER
                    I was just doing my job.  And I d 
                    be dead now, too, if it weren t for 
                    those kids.  They re the heroes.

                                                                            CUT TO:

                                  STONER #1
                    I don t think of us as heroes.  
                    We re more like anti-heroes.        NIGHT STALKER   "THE M WORD"  PREP DRAFT   11/11/2005  4.



                                  STONER #2
                    We don t have any actual powers.

      Standing in a different area of the crime scene, the stoners 
      answer questions from Reed.

                                  REED
                    What were you two doing up here so 
                    late at night?

                                  STONER #1 & #2
                    Uhm ... nothin .

                                  REED
                    Did either of you get a good look 
                    at the lion?

                                  STONER #1
                    We keep telling  em it wasn t a 
                    lion, but the cops are like,  Aw, 
                    shut up, ya hippies.   Yeah, they 
                    called us  hippies! 

                                  REED
                    If it wasn t a lion, what was it?

                                  STONER #1
                    Dude ... it was a monster!

    Out of thin air, notebook in hand, CARL KOLCHAK materializes.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Did somebody just say,  Monster? 

                                  STONER #2
                          (raising hand)
                    I did.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    What did this monster look like?

                                  STONER #1
                    It was huge and scaly, and had 
                    fangs dripping with blood, and 
                    claws, and it had three eyes!

                                  STONER #2
                    Dude, that thing only had one eye.

                                  STONER #1
                    I saw three.  Maybe when you looked 
                    at it, the other two were blinking.        NIGHT STALKER   "THE M WORD"  PREP DRAFT   11/11/2005  5.



                                  KOLCHAK
                    Did it have a tail?

                                  STONER #2
                    Did what have a tail?

                                  REED
                    Kolchak ... why?  Why must you 
                    always leap to the most 
                    preposterous angle?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Why call it preposterous before all 
                    the facts are in?  You don t even 
                    know if this thing has a tail.

                                  REED
                    A person was attacked in an area 
                    where mountain lions live.  Why 
                    drag a ridiculous monster into this 
                    very human tragedy?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    What makes it any less a tragedy if 
                    a monster was involved?  Besides, 
                    the witnesses say it was a monster.

                                  REED
                    You re going to take the word of 
                    these two?!  They don t even know 
                    we re talking about them right now.

      Reed pauses, letting the Stoners stare back as blankly as 
      cows, proving her point.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    That doesn t mean what they re 
                    describing doesn t actually exist.

                                  REED
                    Sure, but on what planet?

                                  STONER #1
                    You know, I m not sure about the 
                    tail, but it had some gnarly horns.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    This thing sounds reptilian.

    As Kolchak jots this down, Reed rolls her eyes and moves 
      away, crossing to the GRIEVING MOTHER, who is being supported 
    by a FAMILY MEMBER, as they stand by the ambulance.

                                  REED
                    Hi, I m Perri Reed of the Beacon.  
                    I m so sorry for your loss, and I 
                    know this is a difficult time, but 
                    could I get a few words about your 
                    son, or possibly a picture ....

    As Reed continues off with the Mother, CAMERA HOLDS on a 
      nondescript, middle aged man (GUY MANN) crossing through the 
      scene.  Wearing an unusually designed tie, as well as a light 
      blue-striped seersucker coat and white shoes (reminiscent of 
      a certain TV character of the 70 s), he holds his head in his 
      hands, obviously distraught.

                                  GUY
                    Why?  Why?  Why? Why?

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Kolchak, in mid-interview with an annoyed SHERIFF.

                                  SHERIFF
                    Kolchak, why must you always leap 
                    to the most preposterous angle?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    All I m asking is why aren t you 
                    taking their claims serious?

                                  SHERIFF
                    Those kids had enough airplane glue 
                    on  em to build the Spruce Goose. I 
                    cut them some slack, because they 
                    saved that ranger s life.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Why not at least have a sketch 
                    artist make a drawing of what 
                    they re describing?

                                  SHERIFF
                    Because it would just look like a 
                    heavy metal album cover!

      O.s., off in the brush, a COMMOTION is heard.  The Sheriff 
      hustles over, with Kolchak on his heels.        NIGHT STALKER   "THE M WORD"  PREP DRAFT   11/11/2005  7.



      EXT. MOUNTAIN TRAIL/LAIR - DAY

    Not a cave, but simply a secluded area, off the beaten path.  
    The lair is piled high with HUMAN REMAINS, most reduced to 
      SKELETONS, but some are naked and half-devoured.

      Animal Control and Police stare down at the scene in horror, 
    and as the Sheriff, Kolchak, and then Reed, join them, their

      INT. BEACON - WHITLEY S DESK - DAY

      A political cartoon depicting the evolutionary progress of 
      Man.  A fish crawls out of water, continues up through animal 
    and Neanderthal stages, reaching Modern Man, who is diving 
      back into the water, labeled,  Intelligent Design Pool .

      WIDER TO REVEAL

      Cartoon is being drawn by a cynical old coot named WHITLEY.  
      Kolchak approaches his drafting board.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Excuse me, Mr. Whitley?  I m sorry 
                    to bother you, but I was wondering 
                    if I might ask for a favor?

                                  WHITLEY
                    Would it involve me drawing? 

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Actually, it would.

                                  WHITLEY
                    Then forget it.  If there s 
                    anything I hate to do -- it s draw.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    But ... you do it for a living.

                                  WHITLEY
                    You call this living?  Who are you, 
                    anyway?  How d you get in here?

                    unknown creature --

      With a dramatic flourish, Whitley sweeps away his current 
      work, and eagerly grabs a fresh sheet of paper.  Kolchak 
      hands him his open notebook, which Whitley consults.

                                  WHITLEY
                    Say no more!  Just give me a couple 
                    minutes.  Hey, hold on -- does this

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Split the difference.  Give it two.

      INT. BEACON - ANN S DESK - DAY

      A nice, pleasant female reporter, ANN, types at her desk, as 
      Reed approaches, like one does with a colleague you ve met, 
    but rarely interact with.

                    about mountain lions.  I m working 
                    on the attack story.

    She jots down a name and number, and hands it to Reed.

                                  REED
                    Thanks, I appreciate it.

      Reed heads towards her desk, and Ann resumes typing for a 
      beat, before Kolchak appears.        NIGHT STALKER   "THE M WORD"  PREP DRAFT   11/11/2005  9.

                    animal would you say this most 
                    resembles?

      Kolchak hands her Whitley s drawing.  It s a fairly accurate 
      likeness of the Monster, but it s depicted as wearing a top 
    hat and monocle, and devouring several tiny picketers.

                                  ANN

                    lizard.  Most people call them 
                    horny toads.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Do they ever get to be man-size?

                    Uhm, no.  They re more like this.

    She holds out her hand, as if holding one in it.  She then 
      proceeds to shake her head to Kolchak s following questions:

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Do they attack humans?  Are they 
                    poisonous?  Are you sure they don t 
                    ever get to be man-size?  Okay ... 
                    well, thanks for your help.

      EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT

    The Monster rears its ugly head.  With a slightly seedy motel 
    in the b.g., the Monster -- seen from behind, and in 
      silhouette (its horns give it away) -- rises slowly from the 
      bottom of the frame.  A CLICKING NOISE emits o.s., and the 
      Monster whips its head in that direction.

    The clicking comes from the stiletto heels worn by BABYCAT, a 
      streetwalker walking the street in front of the motel.

      MONSTER S POV - BABYCAT

      From behind a parked car, watching as Babycat eyes passing 
      cars.  Stalkingly, the CAMERA creeps towards her, but stops, 
      darting behind another parked car, as a CUSTOMER pulls up to 
    the curb, and Babycat leans into his passenger window.

    We watch as Babycat flirts, for quite a while.  CAMERA TILTS 
      DOWN, revealing the Monster s clawed hand and scaly arm, 
      around which is a wristwatch (which it then shakes, 
      irritably.)  TILT BACK UP to see the car pull away, leaving 
      Babycat alone on the sidewalk.  As she turns her back, CAMERA 
      rushes towards her.  At the last second, Babycat turns 
      around.

    As her eyes widen in fear, she SCREAMS.  As she desperately 
      swings at the oncoming attacker, and her purse fills the 
      frame --

    An out-of-breath McManus appears in the doorway.

                    Kolchak, Animal Control just got 
                    another call about your monster!

      Kolchak springs out of his chair, but stops.  He looks back 
    at Vincenzo, with the eagerness of a teenager asking his dad 
    for the car keys.  A silent pause.  Vincenzo shoots a glance 
    at Reed, who remains stoic.  Vincenzo looks back at Kolchak, 
      before dropping his head into his hands. The instant he does, 
      Kolchak is out the door.  He reappears, addressing Reed:      NIGHT STALKER   "THE M WORD"  PREP DRAFT   11/11/2005  15.

      Behind some buildings that are under minor construction 
      (scaffolding, a port-a-potty, etc.), Kolchak and McManus 
      listen to a frustrated Animal Control Officer.  The Officer 
      gets in his truck, and drives off, leaving the journalist to 
      begin their own search of the area.

      EXT. BACK ALLEY - DAY (EARLY MORNING)

      McManus is walking down the original back alley.

                                  KOLCHAK (V.O.)
                    Your prey considers you prey, and 
                    thinks you re the evil menace.  On 
                    this murky battlefield ... 

      Annoyed, McManus looks over at Kolchak, who is revealed to be 
      dictating into his portable tape recorder.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    ... who stalks who, and for which

                    What?

                                  MCMANUS
                    You were doing that all night.  Are 
                    you going to do it all morning, 
                    too?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    It sometimes helps me get down my 
                    first drafts.

                                  MCMANUS
                    You mean your roughdrafts, right?  
                    That was just a very rough ... 
                    outline kind of thing, right?

      Shooting McManus a look, Kolchak clicks off his tape 
      recorder.  The two continue walking down the dark alley.

                                  MCMANUS (CONT D)
                    You know, you have to come up with 
                    a name for this thing.  You can t

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Why not?

                    That s Frankenstein!  It s taken.  
                    Besides, you need something that ll

                                  KOLCHAK
                    You think that s the reason?

                                  MCMANUS
                    How about ...  Lizardo ?  Only you 
                    spell it with a  y , to make it 
                    more exotic.  Or with three  z  s -- 
                    one for each eye.   Another bloody 
                    rampage by Liz-z-zardo!   That 
                    would sell some papers.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    I think I ll wait  til we catch it, 
                    then just ask it what its name is.

                                  MCMANUS
                    Wouldn t it be weird if it said 
                    it s name is  Lizardo?   That d be 
                    pretty creepy.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Not as creepy as this.

      McManus follows Kolchak s look down to the ground, where, 
      partially obscured by debris, is a naked, partially devoured 
      dead body.  Kolchak bends down to inspect it.

                                  KOLCHAK (CONT D)
                    It looks like it s found a new lair.  
                    At least, we know it s been here.  

    As McManus takes a picture, the flash illuminates the alley, 
      where a distant figure suddenly darts away.  Kolchak and 
      McManus take off in pursuit.  They reach the end of the 
      alley, but the figure is gone.

      Cautiously, they begin searching about, slowly breaking off, 
      spreading out in different directions.

    As McManus heads down a dark side alley, he flashes some 
      pictures, just to light his way.  A silhouetted figure slowly 
      rises behind him.  McManus continues on, unaware of the 
      entity encroaching from behind.

      Just before he is pounced upon, McManus turns around.  He 
      speed shoots his camera, causing a STROBE-LIGHT look at the 
      SHRIEKING Monster lunging at a SCREAMING McManus.

      KOLCHAK

      Immediately, runs towards the SCREAMING, racing down the side 
      alley, until suddenly freezing in his tracks.

      McManus lies on the ground, motionless, covered in blood.      NIGHT STALKER   "THE M WORD"  PREP DRAFT   11/11/2005  18.



      Kolchak kneels down beside him, touching his face.  McManus 
      slowly opens his eyes.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Are you all right?  What happened?

                    Lizardo.

    The sound of a DOOR SLAMMING emits from the outer alley.  
      Kolchak helps McManus up, and they resume their pursuit. 

    Out in the main alley, by the construction work, STRANGE 
      NOISES are heard coming from within the port-a-potty.

      Cautiously, the two approach the john.  Kolchak grabs a 
      nearby pallet, ripping out one of its wooden planks (it 
      retains a bent nail at the end of it), and wielding it as a 
      weapon, Kolchak reaches for the door, as McManus readies his 
      camera.  

      Kolchak yanks open the door, and rears back to use his board-
        with-a-nail-in-it club, as McManus speed shoots his camera.  

      Sitting in the port-a-potty, with his pants around his 
      ankles, reading a copy of TheBeacon, is a human man.  The 
    man glimpsed in Act One, Guy Mann.  

      Kolchak and McManus share looks of confused disappointment.

                    Uhm ... do you mind?

                    That picture might be illegal.

                    blood!  It might have shot some out 
                    its eyeballs. 

      Vincenzo stares at Kolchak.  A long, silent pause.  Slowly, 
      carefully, Vincenzo backs away.  He continues walking 
      backwards, eventually turning the office corner, and exits.  
      Kolchak resumes right where he left off.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Don t wash that shirt.  We need to

                    I want to go show this to that Park 
                    Ranger.  See if it triggers 
                    anything.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    That s not a bad idea.  Can you 
                    also show him the sketch.  That 
                    might trigger something, as well.

      Kolchak tries to hand her the monster sketch, but she just 
      looks at it, before looking straight back at Kolchak.

      INT. PARK RANGER S RESIDENCE - DAY

    In a plain, simple, all-American home, Reed, displaying the 
      photo of Guy, and Kolchak, displaying his sketch, sit across 
      from the slightly befuddled Park Ranger.

                                  RANGER
                    Why is it wearing -- ?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Ignore that.

                                  RANGER
                    Okay.  So ... you re asking me if I 
                    was attacked by a giant horny toad?

    The Ranger looks at Reed for help.  She holds up her photo.

                                  REED
                    Perhaps you ve seen this man 
                    before, on the trails?

                                  RANGER
                    It s not ringing any bells, but ... 
                    wait a second -- are you telling me 
                    this is the guy that killed all 
                    those people?  

                                  REED
                    He s merely a person of interest.

                                  RANGER
                    It s hard to believe someone who 
                    looks like this, could be such a 
                    monster. 

                                  REED
                    You know, if you re at all open to 
                    the idea, I d love to come back 
                    sometime, for a longer interview 
                    about what it s like to survive an 
                    attack by a serial killer, who s 
                    still on the loose.

                                  RANGER
                    Oh, sure, anytime.  It really has 
                    affected me in ways I --

                                  KOLCHAK
                    What did you do with your bloody

                    What bloody shirt?      NIGHT STALKER   "THE M WORD"  PREP DRAFT   11/11/2005  23.



                                  KOLCHAK
                    The night you were attacked.  Your 
                    shirt had blood all over.

                                  RANGER
                    I ... threw it away.  I didn t want 
                    any reminders of that awful night.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    The police didn t want it as 
                    evidence?

                                  RANGER
                    Evidence of what?  The blood was 
                    obviously from that poor hiker that 
                    was killed next to me.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Not necessarily.  That blood might 
                    have come out the monster s 
                    eyeball.  

    The Ranger stares at Kolchak like he s a crazy person.  
      Kolchak looks to Reed for help, but she s looking at him 
      exactly the same way.  After an awkward, crazy-filled pause --

                                  KOLCHAK
                    I ll wait outside.  Thanks for your 
                    time, sir.

      Kolchak gets up and leaves.

                                  REED
                    I m sorry for that.  He s ... 
                    really more of an intern.

      Kolchak sits in his car, jotting down some notes, as Reed 
      comes out of the house, and gets in the car.

                    about what it s like to be a 
                    reporter writing a puff piece about 
                    a serial killer survivor?

                    Aw, it s human interest.

                                  REED
                    So anything that would be of 
                    interest to a human being, you 
                    consider a puff piece?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    I just prefer stories with a bigger 
                    scope, that s all.

                                  REED
                    Bigger -- as in giant horny toads?

                    They re horned lizards.

                                  REED
                    You re just bitter because he 
                    didn t confirm your monster theory.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    I don t need him -- I got my 
                    confirmation right here.

      From below his seat, Kolchak holds up a blood shirt.

                                  REED
                    What is that?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    His bloody shirt.  I  borrowed  it 
                    from his trash can.

                                  REED
                    You went through his garbage?!  
                    That s tabloid journalism.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    It s only tabloid if you re digging 
                    up dirt on someone.  I dug up 
                    evidence.  If this blood matches 
                    the blood on McManus  shirt -- 
                    we ve got a monster on our hands!

      INT. KOLCHAK S CAR - NIGHT

      Kolchak, alone, cruises down the same back alleys and streets 
    as in the previous Act, listening to his police scanner.

                    providing cover for the inscrutable

      EXT. MOTEL - DAY

      Kolchak questions a couple of POLICE OFFICERS, who give the 
      appearance that this was a call of no consequence.  As they 
    get into their patrol car, Kolchak heads towards the office.

                    revealed to be a mere

      INT. MOTEL - MANAGER S OFFICE - DAY

    The more-than-slightly seedy motel manager is dipping a 
      washcloth into a bottle of rubbing alcohol.  Wincing, he dabs 
    the cloth on one of several minor cuts on his face, and then 
      takes a hit of the bottle, as Kolchak enters.

                    right before he conks me on the 
                    head with a chair. I only asked him 
                    to pay his bill.  That makes me a 
                    monster?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Of course not.

      EXT. MOTEL - DAY

      Kolchak heads back to his car, but notices the door of one of 
    the rooms is ajar.  He walks over, and peeks inside.

      INT. MOTEL -  ROOM - DAY

      Amongst general dishevelment, an upended chair lies next to a 
      shattered, full length mirror.  Kolchak enters, taking a 
      closer look around.  From the night table, he picks up a pill 
      bottle, prescribed to  Guy Mann  by a Dr. Rumanovitch.  He 
      pockets it, and notes a crumbled bag from  Monster Donut .

      Kolchak approaches the mirror.  After studying a shard, he 
      sticks his head through the frame, finding a crawl space 
      behind the wall.  As Kolchak steps  into  the mirror --

    The crawl space is tall enough to stand erect in, but is so 
      narrow that Kolchak must shuffle sideways to navigate it.  

      After shuffling down this claustrophobic corridor, Kolchak 
      arrives at another mirror.  This provides a direct view into 
      another motel room, where a half-naked Babycat is getting 
      dressed, while  her  CLIENT (TOM SANCHEZ) sleeps in bed. 

      Kolchak continues on, and reaches the end of the crawl space, 
      where he finds a door handle.  As he turns it --

    At the front desk, the Manager turns around, and is

                    Relax, sir.  I m a news reporter.  
                    This ain t news.  When people check

      INT. MOTEL - CRAWL SPACE - DAY (EARLY MORNING)

      Standing in the crawl space, the Manager looks through the 
      two-way mirror, watching Babycat and her client sleep.

                                  MANAGER (V.O.)
                    Early this morning, I was checking 
                    on ... the security of my guests.

      Sidestepping down the crawl space, the Manager comes to 
      another mirror.  He peers into a much darker room.  A 
      rustling occurs under the bed cover.  Suddenly, from the 
      bottom of the bed where the feet should be, an appendage 
      sticks out.  Could it be ... a claw?!        NIGHT STALKER   "THE M WORD"  PREP DRAFT   11/11/2005  28.



    The Manager squints, trying to make out the body, as it 
      crawls -- literally -- out of bed, and across the floor, to 
    the window.  The body reaches up, parting the blinds.  A beam 
    of morning sunlight bursts through, illuminating the 
      monstrous image of ... the Monster!

    The Manager SHRIEKS in horror, as the Monster SHRIEKS in 
      pain.  The Monster closes the blinds, and writhes across the 
      floor, towards the mirror, going out of view.  The Manager 
      cranes his neck, hoping to get another look at this thing.

      Suddenly, a claw SLAMS against the mirror.  It tries grabbing 
      hold, but slides down and off, out of view again.  A pause, 
    as the Manager stands motionless, frozen in fright.

      Suddenly, a human hand SLAMS against the mirror.  The hand 
      grabs a hold of the frame, supporting a human man, who, 
      wobbly, rises to his feet.  The man staggers back to the 
      window, and opens the blinds again.  The light revealing -- 
      GUY.  He appears to be in pain, but of the metaphysical sort.

                                  GUY
                    Why?  Why?!  Why?!?

    He shakes his fists at the heavens, knocks a few things over, 
      then, like an enraged animal, runs to the bathroom, going out 
    of the Manager s view. 

    The Manager anxiously awaits for Guy to re-appear.  He waits 
    for quite a while.  O.s., various INDISTINGUISHABLE NOISES, 
      along with some GRUNTS and GROANS, make the wait seem 
      interminable.   

    Guy re-appears, but his demeanor has completely transformed.  
      Fully dressed, with a cup of coffee in his hand, he crosses 
    to the door, opens it, brings in the complimentary copy of 
    the L.A. BEACON, sits down and starts reading.  

      Perplexed, the Manager watches this guest, who so recently 
      appeared to be some kind of monster, now sits sipping his 
      morning coffee like any normal person.  

      Suddenly, Guy re-erupts in psychotic fury.  He punches his 
      newspaper, and tosses his coffee across the room.  He upends 
    the table, and starts trashing his room.  Just as suddenly, 
    Guy freezes.  He s looking straight at the Manager.

    The Manager becomes unsettled, as Guy slowly stalks towards 
      him, with a look filled with pure hatred.

      REVERSE ANGLE reveals that Guy is staring at his own 
      reflection.  He touches his own face in revulsion.           NIGHT STALKER   "THE M WORD"  PREP DRAFT   11/11/2005  29.



                                  GUY
                    Why?

    He suddenly grabs the chair, and hurls it at the mirror.  The 
      Manager SCREAMS as the chair SMASHES through, and CRASHES 
      into him.  Guy stares in stunned surprise, as the bleeding, 
      semi-conscious Manager falls forward into the room.

                                  MANAGER
                    Monster!  Help me, he s a monster!

    As Guy dashes out of the room -- 

      INT. MANAGER S OFFICE - DAY

      Disturbed by simply recounting the incident, the Manager 
      downs another gulp of rubbing alcohol.  Kolchak shows him the 
      monster sketch, and the photo of Guy.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Is either one of these what you saw 
                    in that room?

    The Manager looks over both pictures.

                                  MANAGER
                    They are one and the same!

                                  ACT FOUR

      INT. FREE CLINIC - DAY

                                  KOLCHAK
                    I m a monster.  At night, when the 
                    moon comes out, I turn into ... a 
                      lizard-like monster that feeds on 
                    human flesh.

      Kolchak sits in an examination room that doesn t look 
      entirely hygienic, much like its physician, DR. RUMANOVITCH.  
      Elderly, perpetually sweaty, and with an Eastern European 
      accent, his role models were Sigmund Freud and Peter Lorre.

                                    RUMANOVITCH
                    Hmmm, it must be going around.  
                    Just the other day, I saw a patient 
                    suffering a similar affliction.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Really?  Who was this person?

                                    RUMANOVITCH
                    Some nut.  I m afraid I can t  
                    discuss my other patients.  You ll 
                    just have to wait for my book.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Dr. Rumanovitch, would it be 
                    possible for me to contact this 
                    person?  To ... start a support 
                    group --

                                    RUMANOVITCH
                    I don t believe in group therapy.  
                    You must confront your demons -- or 
                    in this case, your monsters -- 
                    alone.  With a therapist.  Which 
                    reminds me of what I told this 
                    other patient.
                          (pause)
                    It s an old fairy tale about a 
                    constable, whose village is being 
                    tormented by a dragon.  He tries to 
                    kill this creature, but nothing can 
                    stop it.  Finally, he visits a 
                    gypsy witch doctor, who tells him 
                    the only way to kill this monster 
                    is to take a lance of green glass, 
                    and stab it in its appendix.      NIGHT STALKER   "THE M WORD"  PREP DRAFT   11/11/2005  31.



                                  KOLCHAK
                    Why glass?  And why it s appendix?  

                                    RUMANOVITCH
                    These old myths, the monster must 
                    be destroyed by some form of 
                      penetration -- a wooden stake, a 
                    silver bullet.  Our ancestors were 
                    as concerned about male potency as 
                    we are.  Now, please, no further 
                      interruptions.  He makes this lance 
                    of green glass and confronts the 
                    monster, stabbing it in its 
                    appendix.  But as the monster 
                    starts to die, the constable 
                    realizes ... he s been looking at a 
                    mirror!  He was the monster all 
                    along, you see!
                          (pause)
                    As fairy tales go, it s imbecilic.  
                    But illustrates my point.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Which is?

                                    RUMANOVITCH
                    It is easier for us to believe in  
                    monsters, than believe monsters are 
                    in us.  Specifically, the 
                      cerebellum.

      Grabbing a model of the human brain, he removes the cerebral 
      cortex, only to reveal a pill bottle inside.  After 
      swallowing a couple pills, he points to the neuroanatomy.

                                    RUMANOVITCH (V.O.)
                    The cerebellum regulates our bodily 
                    functions, and is sometimes 
                    referred to as our reptilianbrain.  
                    You see where I m going with this.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Not really.

                                    RUMANOVITCH
                    Our reptilian brains still cause us 
                    to do things -- base, animalistic, 
                    things -- that our  higher  minds 
                    can t comprehend.  Thus, we create,  
                    like our myth-making forefathers, 
                    excuses for our own abhorrent 
                    behavior.

                                    RUMANOVITCH (cont'd)
                     Oh, no, it wasn t Iwho gave that 
                    little girl a lobotomy, it must 
                    have been some terrible monster!   
                    But there are no monsters out 
                    there.  There never have been.  
                    They ve always resided in here --
                          (taps his brain)
                    -- and possibly here --
                          (touches heart)
                    -- and maybe here.
                          (points to his appendix)

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Not everything can be reduced to 
                      psychology.

                                    RUMANOVITCH
                    That s what you think.
                          (after snide giggle)
                    You know, Mr. Vincenzo, you strike 
                    me as someone suffering from any 
                    number of delusions but this 
                    turning into a monster is not one 
                    of them.  Yes?

                                  KOLCHAK
                          (pause)
                    I m trying to find this other 
                    patient.  I figured you wouldn t 
                    give me access to his files, so --

                                    RUMANOVITCH
                    You posed as a fellow sufferer, 
                    hoping I d provide information on 
                    him, yes?  But I saw through the 
                      subterfuge!  
                          (after triumphant giggle)
                    Here s his file.

      Rumanovitch tosses a file to Kolchak, who is momentarily 
      taken aback by the gesture, but he quickly scans it.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    This is useless.  Hardly any 
                      information has been filled out.

                                    RUMANOVITCH
                    This is a free clinic.  Our 
                    clientele is not the most 
                      forthright.  Did you really think

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Can you at least offer a possible 
                    suggestion where I might find him?

                                    RUMANOVITCH
                    I recall he was obsessed with 
                    death, as these types usually are.  
                    He probably habituates places 
                    associated with death:  cemeteries, 
                    funeral parlors, the free clinic.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    You mean, here?  This free clinic?

                                    RUMANOVITCH
                    Did I say,  the free clinic?   Talk

      INT. MONSTER DONUT - DAY

    Guy takes a bite out of a cream-filled donut, while sitting 
    at a booth, piled high with various donuts.  He is being eyed 
    by Reed, who is at the counter, speaking on her cell phone.

                                  REED
                    Kolchak, I can t believe I m about 
                    to utter the following words, but:  
                    I ve found your lizard-man.  He s 
                    at the Monster Donut on Gower.

                                  KOLCHAK (O.S.)
                    Can you stall him  til I get there?

                                  REED
                    It looks like he ll be here a 
                    while, but I ll try my best.

      Reed closes her phone, and approaches Guy.

                                  REED
                    Excuse me, I m sorry to bother you, 
                    but I just had to tell you how much 
                    I love that tie.  

    Guy stares up at her in confusion.  He absentmindedly wipes 
    his mouth with his tie, then holds it out.

                                  GUY
                    You mean this thing?

      EXT. MONSTER DONUT - DAY

      Kolchak pulls into the parking lot, and seems to leap out of 
    the car before its even parked.  As he runs inside --

      INT. MONSTER DONUT - DAY

      Kolchak enters, only to find no one there, and the place 
      trashed.  Donuts, coffee, food trays, etc., litter the floor.  
      After Kolchak takes a moment to take this in, the DONUT CLERK 
      nervously pops his head up from behind the counter.  Then 
      Reed peeks out from below the booth s table.

                                  REED
                    Is he gone?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Is he gone?!  You were supposed to 
                    keep him here.  What happened?

                                  REED
                    I was having a polite conversation 
                    with him, when he suddenly threw a 
                    fit, and ran out of here.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Why?

                                  REED
                    That s what he kept screaming: 
                     Why?!  Why?! 

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Why didn t you follow him?  He s 
                    our story!

                                  REED
                    No, Carl, he s yourstory.  I just 
                    got a call from Vincenzo.  The 
                    police have announced a press 
                    conference -- the rumor is they ve 
                    arrested the murderer in this case.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    How could they have done that when 
                    the killer was just here?  And you 
                    let him slip through your fingers!

                                  REED
                    Carl, there s something you don t 
                    seem to understand.  I m a crime 
                    reporter, not a crime-fighter.  My 
                    job isn t to solve crimes, it s to 
                    write about them.      NIGHT STALKER   "THE M WORD"  PREP DRAFT   11/11/2005  35.



                                  KOLCHAK
                    Sounds to me like you re a crime-
                      stenographer.

                                  REED
                    I d be more insulted by that if it 
                    wasn t coming from someone chasing 
                    a horny toad man/monster, who just 
                    threw a tantrum in a donut shop.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Which way did he go?

    As Reed points off --

      EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

      CLOSE on a statue of St. George, slaying a dragon.  WIDER TO 
      REVEAL Guy, in abject depression, studying the figure, 
      amongst the statuary in a cemetery.

      Kolchak s Mustang pulls up on the cemetery roadway.  Kolchak 
      gets out, and, grabbing some flowers off a grave, heads 
      towards Guy, stopping a few headstones down from him.  

    Guy glances over at Kolchak, who puts down the flowers as if 
      visiting that grave.  Kolchak nods at him, but Guy simply 
      turns away.   After a pause, Guy SIGHS wearily.

                                  GUY 
                    Why?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    I m sorry?  Did you just say 
                    something to me? 

                                  GUY
                    No.  I just said,  Why? 

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Why?

                                  GUY
                    Because I don t understand.  We go 
                    through all the drudgery and 
                    heartbreak of life... just to end 
                    up here?  

                                  KOLCHAK
                    It doesn t seem to make much sense, 
                    does it?      NIGHT STALKER   "THE M WORD"  PREP DRAFT   11/11/2005  36.



                                  GUY
                    It doesn t make anysense.  Nothing 
                    will ever make sense to me again.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    I don t want to get too personal, 
                    mister, but ... you sound like 
                    someone who ... needs to get 
                    something off their chest.  If you 
                    need to talk to someone .... 

                                  GUY
                    I only found out a couple days ago  
                    ... we die.  I always knew to avoid 
                    death, I just didn t know you can t 
                    avoid it forever.  It bothered me a 
                    lot at first, but since then -- 
                    I ve really come to appreciate the 
                    phrase:   Rest in peace. 
                          (closes eyes dreamily)
                    Man, I can t wait.  Restinpeace.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Excuse me again, but ... you sound 
                    like ... well, you re not planning 
                    on ... doing anything rashare you?

                                  GUY
                    Rash?  No.  I m just going to kill 
                    you.  Are you ready?

    No, Kolchak was not ready for this response, nor is he ready 
      when Guy pulls a Heineken beer bottle out of his coat pocket, 
      SMASHES the end against a tombstone, and with the jagged 
      edge, lunges at Kolchak, who barely leaps out of the way.

      After a few feints, Guy charges at Kolchak, causing him to 
      tumble backwards over a tombstone.  Oddly, rather than 
      attacking while Kolchak is on the ground and vulnerable, Guy 
      tosses the broken bottle down near Kolchak.

      Kolchak gathers his senses, and seeing the broken bottle, he 
      grabs it, as he springs to his feet.  Guy now strangely 
      resumes his attack.

                                  GUY
                    I m gonna kill you!

    Guy clutches Kolchak around the throat.  Kolchak moves to 
      stab Guy, but suddenly stops.  Guy strangles him a bit more, 
      before trying to help Kolchak defend himself.  Grabbing 
      Kolchak s bottle-wielding hand, he pulls the bottle towards 
    his own lower abdomen.      NIGHT STALKER   "THE M WORD"  PREP DRAFT   11/11/2005  37.



                                  GUY
                    Defend yourself, you idiot!

      Just as it is about to pierce Guy, Kolchak manages to let go 
    of the bottle, which falls harmlessly to the ground.  Guy 
      stops chocking Kolchak, and crumbles to the ground, SOBBING.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    I know what your trying to do.  The 
                    green glass, the appendix.  But I 
                    won t do it.  I won t kill you.  I 
                    want to help you.

                                  GUY
                    You can only help me by killing me!  
                    Please -- put me out of my misery!

                                  KOLCHAK
                          (pause)
                    Okay.  I ll do it.  I ll kill you.

    Guy gets to his feet, and profusely shakes Kolchak s hand.

                                  GUY
                    Oh, thank you, thank you.  You re 
                    the only kind person I ve ever met.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    But before I kill you, you have to 
                    answer me something.

                                  GUY
                    What?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Why?

      This gives Guy pause.  Not sure if  he can explain it all, or 
    if he even wants to, he takes a deep breath.  Then, he 
      reaches into his inside coat pockets, and pulls out a couple 
      bottles of beer.  He hands one to Kolchak.

                                  GUY
                    This could take a while.

                                  ACT FIVE

      EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

      Sitting on a bench with Kolchak, Guy studies the monster 
      sketch, nodding in recognition.

                                  GUY
                    It s accurate. Corporations are 
                    really sticking it to the unions.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Ignore that.  Is this what you look 
                    like, when you transform into a ... 
                    horned lizard?

                                  GUY
                    Horned Lizard?  They re like this!
                          (holds out hand)
                    It s funny -- I don t know what I m 
                    called, or if I look like this.  
                    I ve never seen myself.  I guess 
                    I m a Giant Horned Lizard.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Well, how long have you been a ... 
                       were-lizard? 

                                  GUY
                    Only a couple of days.  I remember 
                    the night it began.  I was just 
                    minding my own business.  No, I 
                    wasn t even doing that much.  I was 
                    just ... simply ... alive.

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

      EXT. MOUNTAIN TRAIL - NIGHT

      Looking as carefree as Tom Sawyer, the Monster lies on the 
      ground, staring up at the stars,  with a grass stalk sticking 
    out of his mouth.  

      A RUSTLING NOISE, o.s., causes him to sit up like a prairie 
      dog.  He scurries into the top soil, practically vanishing, 
      just before two men (the teaser Victim and Park Ranger, whose 
      identity we don t want to emphasize) appear, grappling to the 
      death, and crashing to the ground next to the unseen Monster.

    The Monster watches with one eye that is not submerged under 
    the soil, as the Ranger starts killing the Victim.      NIGHT STALKER   "THE M WORD"  PREP DRAFT   11/11/2005  39.



                                  GUY (V.O.)
                      Instinctively, I knew not to move, 
                    but when the predator started  
                    devouring his prey ... I panicked.

    The Monster springs up from the ground, strikes a terrifying 
      attack pose, and belts out a SHRIEK.

      EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

    Guy is in the identical pose, now looking not-so-terrifying.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    And then you attacked him?

                                  GUY
                    No, I shot blood out my eyeball at 
                    him.  It s my defense mechanism.  I 
                    was trying to scare him off, but it 
                    just made him more rabid.

      EXT. MOUNTAIN TRAIL - NIGHT

    The Man (Ranger) bites the Monster s neck.  The Monster 
      SHRIEKS IN PAIN, and wriggles free.  It runs away, straight 
      towards the Stoners, who SCREAM and dive to the ground, 
      causing the Monster to SCREAM and run away in the opposite 
      direction.

                                  GUY (V.O.)
                    I managed to escape with my life, 
                    not knowing how much my life had 
                    changed, until the next morning.

      EXT. MOUNTAIN TRAIL - SECLUDED AREA - DAY

      Naked, Guy sleeps buried in the top soil.  He awakes.  
      Shielding his eyes from the sun, he notices his hand.  It s 
    now a human hand!  He stares at it with horror.  He checks 
    his other hand, then the rest of his body.  He touches the 
      bite mark on his neck.

                                  GUY (V.O.)
                    My transformation was not only 
                    physical, but mental.  I was now 
                    ... thinking, not merely reacting.  
                    Then I reacted.

    Guy starts pounding his fist into the ground, looking not 
      unlike Charlton Heston at the end of Planet of the Apes.

                                  GUY
                    Why?!  Why?!  Why?!  Why?!      NIGHT STALKER   "THE M WORD"  PREP DRAFT   11/11/2005  40.



                                  GUY (V.O.)
                    As my mind raced on, I became aware 
                    of my own thoughts, and suddenly I 
                    had my first epiphany of self-
                      consciousness:

    Guy suddenly stops pounding his fist, and sits bolt upright.

                                  GUY
                    I m naked.

      Looking about, he spots a backpack partially buried beneath 
    the brush.  He goes over, and finds clothes, wallet, and 
      watch inside.  As he begins dressing:

                                  GUY (V.O.)
                    Even though I d never worn such 
                    things, I somehow knew how to put 
                    them on.  And then, I became 
                      overwhelmed by an unnatural, 
                      irrational, psychotic desire.  I 
                    fought against it as best I could, 
                    but I had lost control over myself.  
                    Now, nothing could stop me.

    Guy is knotting his tie.  A crazed look comes over him.  He 
      clutches his head in pain, struggling to not give in, but the 
      crazed look overtakes him again, and as he tightens his 
      necktie, he breathes heavily, like a blood-lusting beast. 

                                  GUY (V.O.)
                    I was going to go and hunt down ... 
                    a job!

      EXT. MOUNTAIN TRAIL - DAY

      A reprise of ACT ONE, as a distraught Guy walks through the 
      crime scene, not noticed by both Reed and Kolchak.

                                  GUY
                    Why?  Why?  Why?

                                  GUY (V.O.)
                    Compelled by these unseen forces, I 
                    walked straight down into town.

      EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Wait.  Wait a second.  First of 
                    all, you re claiming a man attacked 
                    and bit you?      NIGHT STALKER   "THE M WORD"  PREP DRAFT   11/11/2005  41.



    Guy pulls back his shirt collar, revealing a strange scar, 
      much too small to be a human bite mark.

                                  GUY
                    It doesn t look like a bite mark, 
                    because I looked different when the 
                    rabid man bit me.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    But ... you re saying you were this 
                    monster to begin with, and then, 
                    after being bit, you turned into a 
                    man?  That doesn t make any sense!

                                  GUY
                    None of it makes sense.  I mean -- 
                    why a job?  I didn t even know what 
                    a job was, but I had to have one.

      CLOSE --  Help Wanted  sign in a storefront window.  A hand 
      grabs the sign, but then another hand grabs that hand, as if 
    to stop it.  WIDER TO REVEAL both hands belong to Guy, who

    own will.  The  human  part wins, and Guy, with sign in hand, 
      enters the Monster Donut Shop ( Home of the Godzilla Claw ).

      INT. MONSTER DONUT - DAY

      Wearing apron, hat, and phony smile, Guy serves a PATRON.

                                  GUY (V.O.)
                    And I found one right away.  By 
                    day s end, I was manager.

                                  GUY

                    You wouldn t be  b.s.-ing  me right 
                    now about all this, would you?

                                  GUY
                    Maybe.  I don t even understand 
                    half the things I m saying to you.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    That s ... disconcerting.

                                  GUY
                    Imagine it from my end.  Even worse 
                    is what I did after work.  I 
                    checked into a motel, and spent the 
                    rest of the day ... watching TV. 

      INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

      Guy, wearing only white briefs, eats donuts and drinks beer 
      while watching TV. (On the screen -- STOCK FOOTAGE of people 
      engaged in some stupid physical activity, like a tug-of-war.)  

                                  GUY (V.O.)
                    At first, I watched a reality show 
                    about people who had been on other 
                    reality shows, competing with each 
                    other to get on a new reality show.  
                    But then I found something less 
                      pornographic:

      INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

    Guy watches PORN.  Empty beer bottles are littered about.  He 
      gets up out of bed, and stumbles to the door.

      EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT

    Guy steps out of his room, and sees Babycat plying her trade 
    on the sidewalk.

                                  GUY (V.O.)
                      Eventually, I stepped out for some 
                    air, and that s when I saw her.  It 
                    was mate-for-life at first sight.

    In a love trance, Guy walks out towards Babycat.

                                  GUY (V.O.)
                    But as I went out to introduce 
                    myself, a change came over me.

    Guy stops, and looks down at his crotch.  As he pulls away 
    the elastic top of his briefs --      NIGHT STALKER   "THE M WORD"  PREP DRAFT   11/11/2005  43.



      GUY S POV - HIS OWN CROTCH

      Underneath his underwear, (besides being genital-less) his 
      skin has transformed into that of a lizard s.  The LIZARD 
      SKIN TRANSFORMATION spreads up his belly and down his thighs, 
    and his hands become claw-like.

    GUY

      Ecstatic as he transforms.

                                  GUY
                    All right!

      EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

                                  GUY
                    I turned back into myself, I guess 
                    because the sun had gone down, or 
                    the moon had come out.  I don t 
                    really get how that all works.  
                    Anyway, I was back to normal, but 
                    completely disoriented.  I tried to 
                    return to the safety of my roost.

      EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT

      From behind a parked car, the Monster, in white briefs, 
      dashes back towards the motel, in the direction of Babycat, 
    who turns, SCREAMS, then CONKS it on the head with her purse.  
    The Monster staggers towards its room.

      EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

                                  GUY
                    Why would she do that to me?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    She thought you were attacking her.  
                    Or rather, him.  She was a man.

                                  GUY
                    She had transformed into a man?!

                                  KOLCHAK
                    No, he s a transvestite.  A man who 
                    dresses like a woman.

                                  GUY
                    Why would a man do that?  That s 
                    the craziest thing I ve ever heard.

                    So, anyway, after I turned back 
                    into a Giant Horned Lizard, I fell 
                    asleep peacefully in my motel room.  
                    Until ... the next morning.

      INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY (EARLY MORNING)

      Sunlight streams through the blinds, onto a body in bed, 
      completely under the covers.  The ALARM CLOCK RINGS.  A 
      clawed monster hand pokes out of the blankets, and pounds on 
    the clock, but the alarm continues.  The claw retracts under 
    the covers.

    The body rolls over, tossing off the blankets to reveal an 
      entirely human Guy.  He shuts off the alarm, yawns, and sits 
    on the bed groggily, like any human starting his day.

                                  GUY (V.O.)
                    Inescapably, I fell into the 
                    routine of human existence, even 
                    though I understood none of it.

      INT. MOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - DAY - SERIES OF SHOTS 

    Guy shaves his face, howling in pain after each razor stoke.

                                  GUY (V.O.)
                    Why shave hair that was just going 
                    to grow back again?

    Guy applies roll-on deodorant under his arms, then continues 
    on, rolling it across his chest, down his belly, around his 
      back, up his neck, over the top of his head.

                                  GUY (V.O.)
                    Why cover your natural scent with 
                    some other manufactured scent?

    Guy sits on the toilet, unraveling some toilet paper.

                                  GUY (V.O.)
                    Why ... well, why bother?

      INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

      Sitting in a chair, now fully dressed, Guy reads the Beacon.

                                  GUY (V.O.)
                    Why read the morning paper?  To 
                    find out what happened to people I 
                    didn t know, doing things I didn t 
                    care about, in places I d never be?

      INT. MONSTER DONUT - DAY

    Guy is behind the counter, all smiles and friendliness, 
      filling an order for a ANOTHER PATRON.

                                  GUY (V.O.)
                    I went to work.  Having previously 
                    been obsessed with getting a job, 
                    now that I had one, all I could 
                    think about was quitting.  Finally, 
                    the conflict resolved itself.

                                  GUY 
                    That s it -- I quit!  Make your own 
                    damn coffee!

    Guy suddenly explodes in a furious rage, tossing several 
      trays of donuts, before ripping off his apron and hat (which 
    he punches), and climbs over the counter.

      INT. FREE CLINIC - DAY

    Guy sits listening to Dr. Rumanovitch, who is displaying his 
      brain model.

                                  GUY (V.O.)
                    I realized I needed help.  I sought 
                    medical attention, but all I got 
                    were useless meds, and ancient 
                    myths about Dragon-men and the 
                    Super-Ego.  It was all so 
                    humiliating, that I then became 
                    consumed by a feeling I had never 
                    before known -- revenge!  I wanted 
                    to kill the son of a bitch that did 
                    this to me!

    Guy suddenly tosses his chair across the room, then SCREAMS 
    at the heavens in a vengeful rage.  Rumanovitch pulls out a 
      hypo-needle, but Guy flees by leaping out the open window.  
      Rumanovitch shrugs, then injects himself with the sedative.  

      EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

                                  GUY
                    So I tracked down the guy who had 
                    bit me -- the man responsible for 
                    turning my life into a living hell.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    How did you find him?

    Guy taps his nose, and SNIFFS.  Kolchak looks incredulous.      NIGHT STALKER   "THE M WORD"  PREP DRAFT   11/11/2005  46.



                                  KOLCHAK (CONT D)
                    You tracked down someone in the 
                    city of Los Angeles by your sense 
                    of smell?

                                  GUY
                    Yeah, I can see how that would be 
                    the one part of my story that s 
                    hard to believe, but the proof is 
                    ...I found him.

      EXT. BACK ALLEY - NIGHT

      Crouching behind the port-a-potty, Guy spies on the killer 
      (Ranger), forcibly escorting ANOTHER VICTIM down an alley.

                                  GUY (V.O.)
                    When I laid eyes on him, I wanted 
                    to tear him apart, limb by limb. 

    Guy removes his jacket and shirt, spits in his fists, and 
      stalks towards the alley, ready to rumble.  But when he gets 
      there, his mouth falls open in shocked horror.  He covers his 
      mouth with one hand, while the other clutches his sensitive 
      stomach. 

                                  GUY (V.O.)
                    But before I could, he started 
                    doing the same to someone else.

      Down the dark alley, we see only a hint -- but it s enough -- 
    of the killer viciously attacking his victim.

                                  GUY (V.O.)
                    Never had I witnessed such 
                    brutality. In the wild, I ve seen 
                    some harsh things -- hell, I 
                    watched coyotes eat my mate -- but 
                    this was so ... unnecessary.  I was 
                    so transfixed, I didn t even notice 
                    when I transformed.

    The Monster, in the same exact position and posture that Guy 
    was in, continues watching the killer in horror.

                    After returning to normal, I lost 
                    my taste for vengeance.  I found

                    morning, some guys chased me into a

                    That was me.

                                  GUY
                    I thought I recognized you!  Isn t 
                    that funny?  Oh, god -- I squirted 
                    your friend with eyeball blood.  I 
                    was just trying to scare him away. 
                    Please apologize to him for me.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    He didn t take it personally.

                                  GUY
                    Good.  Well, after that, I didn t 
                    know what to do about my life, so 
                    ... I went back to my motel and 
                    watched porn all day.

                    You d think there d be a limit to 
                    how long a man can watch strangers 
                    fornicate, but you d be wrong.  
                      Mercifully, night finally fell.

      Watching porn in bed, Guy points the remote, and notices his 
      hand is transforming.  Zapping off the TV, he lays his head 
    on the pillow.  With a relieved smile on it, Guy s face 
      transforms into the Monster s.  Immediately, he begins 
      SNORING peacefully.

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

      INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY (EARLY MORNING)

      (Reprising Act Three) Guy is trashing his room.  He hurls the 
      chair at the mirror, causing the Manager to fall into the 
      room.  Guy dashes out.

                                  GUY (V.O.)
                      Unmercifully, morning rose again.    
                    I found a man was living behind my 
                    mirror.  Why?  I didn t bother to 
                    find out -- things were weird 
                    enough already.

                    Needing to clear my head, I went 
                    and got some donuts.  Maybe it was 
                    the cream talking, but I couldn t 
                    help but think:  what was the point 
                    of Life, if living it only made you 
                    want to be dead?  That s when I 
                    decided to end mine.  But as I 
                    contemplated how, and began 
                      considering the doctor s story 
                    about green glass and appendixes, a 
                    strange thing happened .... 

      Reed approaches Guy s booth.

                    take these donuts back to my place, 
                    and show me what these holes are 
                    for?

                    I know it s hard to believe by

                    She asked me a bunch of questions, 
                    then she told me donuts were bad 
                    for you.  Did you know that?  I got 
                    so upset. The one thing in this 
                      godforsaken life I like, and it 
                    turns out --

    Guy has pulled out a pack of cigarettes, and put one in his 
      mouth.  As he brings out a lighter, Kolchak shakes his head.

                                  GUY
                    Not cigarettes, too?  You got to be 
                    kidding me?  Why?!

    As Guy leaps up and furiously crushes his cigarettes, a 
      CLICKING NOISE emits from Kolchak s coat pocket.  A pause.

    Guy SMASHES the recorder against the bench, and bolts.  
      Kolchak makes a move to get up and follow, but hesitates, and 
      then merely watches as Guy dodges past headstones, scaring 
      other CEMETERY VISITORS, as he keeps yelling back:

                                  ACT SIX

      INT. BEACON - KOLCHAK S DESK - DAY

      Dejected, Kolchak shuffles through McManus  out-of-focus 
      pictures, like if he looked at them enough, the whole thing 
      would finally make sense.  Vincenzo approaches.

                                  VINCENZO
                    You missed the press conference 
                    today, Kolchak.  Lucky for me, Reed 
                    was there to cover your ass.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    What was the big announcement?

                                  VINCENZO
                    The victim found in the alley, and 
                    the ones on the mountain trail, 
                    were all killed by the same person.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    We already knew that!

                                  VINCENZO
                    But we didn t know that s what they 
                    were going to say.  That s why it s 
                    important to go to these things.  
                    Where were you?

                    Getting an exclusive no-holds-
                    barred interview with my monster.  
                    Don t worry, I m not writing it.  
                    It turned out to be this guy 
                    claiming he was a monster that 
                    turned into a man, not a man who 
                    turned into a monster.

                    Maybe I m stupid -- not for 
                    thinking this, but in asking it --  
                    what s the difference?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    I guess there isn t any, but ... 
                    and he did provide explanations for 
                    ... but it was all too ... well, 
                    not crazy, but ... silly.  I m 
                    sorry, Tony, I feel foolish.      NIGHT STALKER   "THE M WORD"  PREP DRAFT   11/11/2005  52.

                    Don t, Carl.  I knew this monster 
                    thing was just a phase you needed 
                    to get through. Now that you have, 
                    you can focus on this serial killer 
                    piece.  It s a big, juicy story a 
                    good reporter like you can really 
                    sink his teeth into.

      Kolchak s eyes suddenly widen.  He hurriedly flips through 
    the pictures, finding the one he s searching for -- an 
      extreme close-up of ... a bite mark?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    That s it!  I couldn t see it 
                    before, because I didn t know what 
                    I was looking at.  It s a bite 
                    mark!  You can even make out the 
                    space in the two front teeth.

                                  VINCENZO
                    Looks more like a butterfly to me.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    If he was telling the truth, he was 
                    bit by the Park Ranger!

                    The Park Ranger?  Reed is out on an 
                    interview with him right now.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Tony, call the cops!  Send them 
                    over there!

      Kolchak sprints towards the elevators.

                                  VINCENZO
                    Why?!

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Exactly!

      EXT. PARK RANGER S RESIDENCE - DAY

      Kolchak pulls up, stopping at full speed.  He leaps out, and 
      races into the house.      NIGHT STALKER   "THE M WORD"  PREP DRAFT   11/11/2005  53.



      INT. PARK RANGER S RESIDENCE - DAY

      Kolchak rushes in, but suddenly stops.  Before him is a 
      tableau of criminal arrest:  Several police officers have 
      their guns aimed at the Park Ranger, squirming face down on 
    the floor, as Reed restrains his arm behind his back, while 
      grinding her knee into his spine.  The Sheriff is cuffing 
      him.  McManus stands off to the side flashing pictures.

      Everyone freezes, and looks over at Kolchak.  He pauses, 
      before pointing at the Ranger.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    He s the killer.

      A beat, then everyone resumes their actions.  The Police lift 
    the Ranger off the floor, and start escorting him out.  As he 
      passes by Kolchak --

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Why d you do it?

                                  RANGER
                    Why?  Why not?

    As they remove him, Kolchak approaches Reed, who is jotting 
      down notes, and  kissing  the cuts on her knuckles.

                                  REED
                    It s like I was telling you all 
                    along, Kolchak -- it wasn t some 
                    weird monster that was killing and 
                    devouring these people, it was just 
                    a normal, human being.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    I had Tony call the cops when I 
                    figured out he was the killer.

                                  MCMANUS
                    Shecalled the cops.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    How d you figure out he did it?

                                  REED
                    We got the tests back from that 
                    shirt you stole.  The blood on it 
                    came from the victim found in the a 
                    alley, not the one on the trail.      NIGHT STALKER   "THE M WORD"  PREP DRAFT   11/11/2005  54.



                                  KOLCHAK
                    Well, that s not figuring it out -- 
                    that s hard evidence.  That s 
                      practically cheating.

                                  REED
                    I kept my appointed interview with 
                    him, and started pinning him down 
                    with some innocuous question.  Just 
                    before the police arrived, he 
                    figured out I was on to him, and he 
                    went after us.

                                  MCMANUS
                          (karate chopping)
                    You should have seen her, Kolchak.  
                    Biff!  Bang!  Pow!

                                  REED
                          (shrugs modestly)
                    A reporter can t be content just 
                    writing about crime.  Sometimes, 
                    you got to bust some heads.  

                                  MCMANUS
                    Hey, how d you figure out he was 
                    the killer?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    It only occurred to me after 
                    interviewing the monster.

                                  REED
                    You finally found him, huh?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Yeah, and wait  til you hear his 
                    story.  He was already a --

                                  REED
                    Save it, Kolchak.  I ve got an 
                    exclusive to write.  Besides, this 
                    stinks of human interest to me. 

    She struts out, and McManus, throwing more karate chops, 
      follows her, leaving Kolchak in the room alone.

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

      EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

    In the Mustang, Kolchak cruises around, on the lookout.      NIGHT STALKER   "THE M WORD"  PREP DRAFT   11/11/2005  55.



                                  KOLCHAK (V.O.)
                    Once in your grasp, even the most 
                    desired catch can escape, 
                      necessitating the pursuit again.

      INT. MONSTER DONUT - DAY

      Kolchak shows Guy s photo to the head-shaking Donut Clerk.

                                  KOLCHAK (V.O.)
                    But where to search, when all the 
                    places you ve previously spotted 
                    your prey prove fruitless?

      EXT. MOTEL PARKING LOT - NIGHT

      Kolchak shows Guy s photo to Babycat, who shakes her head 
      while trying to put her arm through Kolchak s.

      EXT. MOUNTAIN TRAIL - NIGHT

                                  KOLCHAK (V.O.)
                    You must start over.  From the very 
                    beginning --

    As Kolchak drives up the fire road, his headlights catch Guy 
      walking up the trail.  Kolchak gets out, and rushes up to 
      Guy, who is taking off his shoes and socks.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Hey, they caught the killer!

                                  GUY
                    What do I care?

                                  KOLCHAK
                    But you were right about it.  I 
                    doubted you, because ... well, some 
                    of what you said sounded absurd.

                                  GUY
                    Are you kidding?  It all sounded 
                    absurd!  Because everythingis 
                    absurd.  I mean, look at this 
                    thing!  

    Guy yanks the tie off his head, holding it up for display.  
      Dropping it to the ground, he shakes his wristwatch, and 
      struggles to get it off.      NIGHT STALKER   "THE M WORD"  PREP DRAFT   11/11/2005  56.



                                  GUY
                    Can you get this off me?  Like this 
                    isn t absurd -- living your days 
                    according to an arbitrary construct 
                    of time intervals?!

      Kolchak removes the watch, which Guy then tosses into the 
      darkness.  As Guy starts taking off his jacket --

                                  KOLCHAK
                    What ... what are you doing?

                                  GUY
                    This is when I d normally 
                    hibernate.  A whole season of 
                    resting in peace!  I m praying -- 
                    even though this whole  God  thing 
                    seems like the biggest absurdity -- 
                    that I stay asleep even if I 
                    transform.  You want this? 

    Guy offers his jacket to Kolchak, who takes it, ever-so-
      gingerly.  Guy rips off his shirt, and takes off his pants 
    and underwear (o.s.,  natch), then starts walking away.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    But ... I still have so many 
                    questions to ask you.

      Seen from the waist up, Guy keeps walking, nearing the edge 
    of the headlight beam, as he looks back at Kolchak.

                                  GUY
                    Answer them yourself.  You 
                    understand this as much as I do -- 
                    which is not at all.  Good night!

    Guy turns and walks on.  Just when we should see his naked 
      butt, we don t -- it is covered by a tail.  As the rest of 
      Guy s body begins to transform into the Monster, he 
      disappears into the darkness.

      Kolchak stands alone, holding his new jacket, staring off 
      into the shadows.

                                  KOLCHAK (V.O.)
                    Mysteries abound in our universe.  
                      Unfortunately, the only witnesses 
                    to this one were druggies, 
                    perverts, serial killers, and  
                      journalists.Who d believe any of 
                     em?

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:      NIGHT STALKER   "THE M WORD"  PREP DRAFT   11/11/2005  57.



      Kolchak sitting on the hood of his car, dictating into his 
      tape recorder, which is scotch taped back together.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Maybe no one would believe it 
                    anyway.  The very idea of a 
                    monster, in this day and age, 
                    living amongst us, is preposterous.  
                    But is it any more preposterous 
                    than the very idea of ... us?  The 
                    mystery of Life will always --

    The tape recorder starts CLICKING, and GEARS are heard 
      GRINDING.  Kolchak gives it a whack with his hand, causing 
    the batteries to fly out, and the whole machine falls to 
      pieces.  Kolchak sighs wearily.

                                  KOLCHAK
                    Why?

    As he looks up to the heavens for an answer, TILT UP, 
      revealing there are no answers up above, only the moon, still 
      hanging ominously in the night sky.

                                  THE END
