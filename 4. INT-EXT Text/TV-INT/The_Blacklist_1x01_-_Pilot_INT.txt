      The place is packed.  Smells like travel.  Among this dizzy 
      mob, one very composed American commands our attention.  He 
      approaches the window and opens his passport --

      -- Meet RAYMOND  RED  REDDINGTON (55).  Dignified.  Worldly.  
      He wears a perfectly tailored suit and carries himself with  
      a sense of purpose.  

                                    CUSTOMS AGENT
                    Where you been, sir?

                                  RED
                      Singapore.  Business.

                                    CUSTOMS AGENT
                    And where we headed?

                                  RED
                    Home.

      Red smiles.  His confidence is magnetic.  As the agent STAMPS 
      his passport, Mel Torme s driving  Comin  Home Baby  sends us 
      hurtling through:


      A winded STAFFER rushes into a packed boardroom.  Pulls aside 
      ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF COUNTERTERRORISM, HAROLD COOPER (52).  
      He s worn by life.  A natural cynic.  The Staffer whispers.

                                  COOPER
                            (thunderstruck)
                    How is that even possible?!


      A Sikorsky S-76 lands and delivers Cooper who is met by AGENT 
      DONALD RESSLER (42), square-jawed and seasoned.  This job is 
      his life.  They duck the rotors, shouting over the chopper --                                                                                      3.


                                    RESSLER
                    Ressler.  Washington Field office.  
                    I m the case agent on Reddington.

                                  COOPER
                    When did this happen?

                                    RESSLER
                    Under an hour ago.

                                  COOPER
                    We confirm it s actually him?

                                    RESSLER
                    It s him alright.  Prints match.  
                    Tattoos.  He even volunteered 
                      classified details about our 
                    Brussels mission in  08.

                                  COOPER
                    What happened in Brussels?

                                    RESSLER
                    Sir?  We tried to kill him, sir.  


      F.B.I. TECHs sit behind glowing control panels.  Monitors 
      cover the walls.  The screens depict various angles of Red 
      chained to the floor.  Cooper nears a monitor, captivated. 

                                  COOPER
                    Christ, it really is him.

      He turns to the glass and approaches Ressler.  They watch Red 
      like a fish in a jar.  Even in captivity, Red carries himself 
      with unquestionable presence.

                                    RESSLER
                    Came in with a briefcase containing 
                    every alias he s ever used.  Most 
                    of  em we ve never heard of. 

                                  COOPER
                    What s he want?

                                    RESSLER
                    Don t know.  Won t talk.  The guy s 
                      a goddamned stone.   

      Cooper watches Red, unsettled, as we hear -- 

                                    RESSLER (O.S.)
                    Raymond  Red  Reddington grew up 
                    the son of an army brat...                                                                                      4.



      Ressler briefs a packed room of agents, analysts and legal 
      staffers.  CLASSIFIED IMAGES fill giant monitors overhead.

                                    RESSLER 
                    ...he attended West Point.  Top of 
                    his class.  By thirty he was an 
                      intelligence officer in the Army.  
                    Made Captain.  Military Liaison 
                    Officer to the N.S.A.  

      It s a life in photos, the American Dream.

                                    RESSLER
                    Then, in 1990, Reddington s headed 
                    home to see his wife and daughter 
                    for Christmas.  He never arrived. 

      We see CRIME SCENE PHOTO of a snow covered hatchback on a 
      desolate mountain road.

                                    RESSLER 
                    His vehicle was discovered along a 
                    stretch of highway thirty-three in 
                    the Allegheny Mountains.  Christmas 
                    gifts for his wife and kid in the 
                    back of the car. 

      We see snapshots of SEARCH PARTIES and NEWSPAPER HEADLINES.   

                                    RESSLER
                    There were searches.  Candle light 
                    vigils.  No answers.  This guy up 
                    and disappeared from the face of 
                    the earth...

      The screens go dark, then reignite with a single surveillance 
      photo of a GHOSTLY IMAGE; a bearded shadow of a man.

                                    RESSLER
                    ...until four years later when U.S. 
                    military secrets started turning up 
                    in South Asia.  The leak was traced 
                    to Reddington.  Turns out he was 
                    trading military strategies with 
                    New Delhi; brokering arms deals for 
                    the North Koreans.  Four years 
                    after going AWOL, this decorated 
                    soldier re-emerges as an enigma. 

      We re struck with a barrage of CLASSIFIED PHOTOS.  Red in 
      secret meetings and exotic countries.  The birth of a legend.                                                                                        5.


                                    RESSLER
                    His military background would lead 
                    you to believe he s some sort of 
                    spy, but he s not.  This guy s an 
                    equal opportunity offender; a 
                       facilitator  of sorts who s built 
                    an enterprise brokering deals for 
                    fellow criminals.  We know he s 
                      orchestrated the assassinations of 
                    federal inmates, laundered money 
                    for the mob, and bought judges only 
                    to have them killed.  Last year, he 
                      personally negotiated a month long 
                      cease-fire between the la Familia 
                    drug cartel and the Calderon 
                      government.  He has no country.  No 
                    political agenda.  Best we can tell 
                      Reddington s only allegiance is to 
                    the highest bidder.  

                                  AGENT
                    They call him something.  In the 
                    papers.

                    The Concierge of Crime.

      We linger on an eerie photo of Red.  Eyes locked on us.


      Ressler and Cooper are little more than silhouettes looking 
      through the window, watching Red in his interrogation cell.  

                                  COOPER
                    Call Lab Services.  Have them fit

                                    RESSLER
                    You think he s going somewhere?

                                  COOPER
                    Not on my watch.   


      Red watches ARMED AGENTS escort a DOCTOR into his cell.  The 
      Doctor loads a small CHIP, the size of a grain of rice, into 
      a digital syringe.  Injects the device into Red s shoulder. 

      IN THE SECURITY NEST...

      A SCANNER lights up.  Beeps twice.                                                                                        6.


                                  TECH
                    He s on-line.

      As Red s cell is vacated, the agents discuss what s next.  
      Red rubs his shoulder.  Turns to a SECURITY CAMERA --

                                  RED
                          (on the monitor)
                    It appears someone with the 
                    authority to make decisions has 
                    arrived.  Good to see you again, 
                    Agent Cooper.

      -- the control room realizes Red is speaking to them through 
      the security monitors.  Cooper turns.  The room falls silent.

                                  RED
                    We need to move quickly and I know 
                    you have many questions, so let s 
                    begin with the most important one: 
                    why I m here.

      We INTERCUT between the agents and Red, who speaks through 
      the camera like some Orwellian tyrant.  Red stands. 

                                  RED
                    I m going to help you capture a 
                    criminal you don t know exists.  

                                    RESSLER
                    What s he talking about?

                                  COOPER
                    Turn it up.

                                  RED
                    Of course, you re familiar with his 
                    crimes.  Counterintelligence is 
                      monitoring his criminal enterprise 
                    through the Patriot Act, the Hague 
                    wants him for war crimes, CIA calls 
                    him the Serbian Ghost.
                          (flat)
                    I can tell you his real name is 
                    Ranko Zamani.  You want him.  I 
                    want him.  Let s say that for the 
                    moment our interests are aligned. 

      Cooper can t believe what he s hearing --

                                  COOPER
                    Feed this through to the Assistant 
                    A.G. of Counterterrorism.                                                                                      7.

                    Get Main Justice on the phone.

      With a few keystrokes, an ANALYST brings up the dossier of 
      RANKO ZAMANI.  Classified details unfold on the monitors.

                    Key player in the Yugoslav wars... 

      Zamani s a gaunt little man.  Haunting eyes.  He wears a rash 
      of CHEMICAL BURNS on his neck and jaw.  Red continues to fill 
      in details about Zamani as -- 

      -- an ANALYST beckons Cooper and shows him a classified file 
      on his monitor.  Cooper turns.  Walks directly into...

      RED S INTERROGATION CELL.

                                  RED
                    Agent Cooper, you re not trained in 
                      interrogation.

                                  COOPER
                    I don t know what you think is 
                    gonna happen here, but this --

                                  RED
                    I m giving you Zamani. 

                                  COOPER
                    Ranko Zamani died twelve years ago.  
                    He s a non-existent threat. 

                                  RED
                    And you believe that?

                                  COOPER
                    It s a fact.  Serbian courts had 
                    him declared dead in 2008.

                                  RED
                    Then a dead man just stepped off 
                    United 283 from Munich to Dulles.

      Cooper s expression goes flat as we SMASH CUT TO:

      Ressler storms into the room, voice booming.

                                    RESSLER
                    Okay, listen up, people.  The lab

      Agent Cooper sits down across from Red.  Every camera in the 
      nest is rolling.   

                                  COOPER
                    You have my attention.

                    Yes, you were wrong.  Certainly not 
                    the first time.  Now, I ll give you 
                    Zamani, but first --                                                                                      9.


                                  COOPER
                    No  but firsts .  You don t decide 
                    anything.  I m in charge.  All you 
                    do is talk.

                                  RED
                    Agent Cooper, you ve overestimated 
                    your authority.  I don t trust you.  
                    I don t even like you.  I said I ll 
                    help you find Zamani, and I will, 
                    but from this point forward there s 
                    one very important rule:
                          (fearless)
                    I only speak with Elizabeth Keen. 

      IN THE SECURITY NEST...

      The agents blink in confusion.  Glances are exchanged.  

                                    RESSLER
                    Who the hell is Elizabeth Keen?

      So we SMASH CUT TO:


      A golden retriever licks the face of a SLEEPING WOMAN.  She 
      pushes the dog away and squints at the blinking alarm clock.  
      Lays back down.  Suddenly JOLTS OUT OF BED as --

                                  WOMAN
                    Crap.  CRAP!!!

      -- her dazed HUSBAND sits up on his elbows.

                                    HUSBAND
                    Lizzy, what s going on?

                                  WOMAN
                    Power went out.  I M LATE. 

      A SERIES OF FAST CUTS ignite the day.  Shower on.  Toaster 
      loaded.  Steam is wiped from the bathroom mirror and we re 
      given our first good look at --

      -- ELIZABETH KEEN (36).  She s worked out.  The body of a 
      dancer.  Spirit of a fighter.  Shades of a rebellious gutter 
      punk past.  Liz brushes her teeth.

                                  LIZ
                          (mouth foaming)
                    I missed my bus, babe.  I m gonna 
                    need to take the car. 

      IN THE KITCHEN...                                                                                    10.


      Liz quickly fumbles through the fridge.  Her husband, Tom 
      (40), stumbles into view.  Tom s easy going.  The emotional 
      glue.  Not so good at mornings.  He hops into a leg of his 
      pants, heart racing, as -- 

                                  TOM
                    You can t take the car.  I need the 
                    car.  Field trip committee.   

                                  LIZ
                    We re out of milk.

                                  TOM
                    I can drive you. 

      Liz closes the refrigerator door to find Tom standing there 
      with TWO TOURISM BROCHURES, one in each hand.

                                  TOM
                    Air and Space or the National Zoo?

      Liz flicks the zoo brochure. 

                                  LIZ
                    Zoo s gender neutral.  
                          (then, realizing)
                    Is this pee?!  I m standing in pee.

                                  TOM
                    He s your dog too.

      IN THE BEDROOM...

      Liz yanks off her socks.  Checks the time.

                                  LIZ
                          (calling out / hurried)
                    I m gonna smell like a urinary 
                    tract infection on my first day.

                                  TOM (O.S.)
                    -- can t hear you.  Remember, we 
                    have the last adoption meeting 
                    today.  One-thirty. 

      IN THE KITCHEN...

      Tom scrapes the burnt char from a piece of toast and takes a 
      giant bite.  He hands the other half to Liz who buzzes past, 
      takes a bite, grabbing her purse as --

                                  TOM
                    You heard me, right?  One-thirty?                                                                                    11.


                                  LIZ
                      One-thirty.  Last meeting.  Make or 
                    break.  Don t worry about me, babe, 
                    I ll take the train from work and 
                    meet you there.

                                  TOM
                    I m in the car.

      As Tom disappears into the hall, Liz tosses the burnt toast 
      to the dog.  She opens the fridge.  Grabs an apple. 

                                  TOM (O.S.)
                    You got the keys?

                                  LIZ
                    In my pocket.  

                                  TOM (O.S.)
                    I got your coffee. 

      These two are good.  In locked-sync step. 

      OUTSIDE THEIR BROWNSTONE...

      Liz vaults down the steps, apple in her teeth.  She stops 
      when she sees Tom standing by their car watching her. 

                                  LIZ
                    What?

                                  TOM
                    You.

                                  LIZ
                    I forget something?

      Tom smiles, marveling.

                                  TOM
                    We both woke up seven minutes ago.  
                    My shirt s on backwards and my eyes 
                    can barely focus.  You re dressed, 
                    composed and as beautiful as you 
                    were the day we met.

                                  LIZ
                    I m forgetting something.

      Tom pulls LIZ S F.B.I. BADGE from behind his back.  Almost 
      forgot it.  As she pockets the badge we realize LIZ IS AN 
      F.B.I. AGENT.  She steps closer.  Looks into her Tom s eyes.                                                                                      12.


                                  LIZ
                    You know I m not going to let this 
                    job come between us and our family.  
                    We want a family, we re gonna have 
                    a family.  Today s the day.

                                  TOM
                    We can do this.

      He holds her eyes.

                                  TOM
                    I m proud of you, Lizzy.  You 
                    worked hard for this.  Nervous? 

                                  LIZ
                    No.  I m good.  I just don t want 
                    any more big surprises today. 

      Tom pulls Liz close and they KISS, but their embrace is 
      interrupted by a low, THUNDEROUS RUMBLE.  Leaves rustle.  The 
      rumbling SWELLS as they look overhead to see --

      -- a HELICOPTER rising over their brownstone.  POLICE CARS 
      emerge out of nowhere.  JUMP the curb.  Cordon off a large 
      area of the park across the street where the chopper lands.  
      Agent Ressler exits, running toward Liz.

                                    RESSLER
                    Agent Keen?

      He flashes his BADGE.  Liz blinks in disbelief.

                                    RESSLER
                    Donald Ressler.  Washington Field 
                    Office.  I need you to come with me 
                    right away.

      Liz holds out her finger, dangling the keys to Tom. 

                                  LIZ
                            (dumbstruck)
                    I don t think I ll need the car. 

                                                      CUT TO BLACK.

                     END OF TEASER                                                                                    13.


                             ACT ONE


      We drift over WASHINGTON.  Liz watches in total bewilderment 
      as the city floats under her feet.  Ressler hands her a set 
      of headphones which she puts on to hear --

                                    RESSLER
                    Raymond Reddington.

                                  LIZ
                    Excuse me?

                                    RESSLER
                    The fugitive.  Number Four.  How do 
                    you know each other?

      She adjusts the headphones, confused.

                                  LIZ
                    I m sorry, I woke up late.  Power 
                    went off.  I m a little... punchy. 

                                    RESSLER
                    When was your last contact?

                                  LIZ
                    With... Reddington?  

      Ressler squints.  Who else?

                                  LIZ
                    What?  No.  Why would you think -- 
                    the man s been at large since I was 
                    in a training bra.  We studied his 
                    profile at... 
                          (re: the ground below)
                    Is that the White House?  This is 
                      restricted airspace.

                                    RESSLER
                    You never met.

                                  LIZ
                    Of course, not.  Most psychologists 
                    could only dream of interviewing a 
                    guy like Reddington. 

                                    RESSLER
                    Well, congratulations.  Your dream 
                    is about to come true.

      Off Liz s disbelief we JUMP TO:                                                                                    14.



      Liz tries to match Ressler s stride as F.B.I. POLICE escort 
      them into the belly of the bureau. 

                                  LIZ
                    This must be some sort of mistake.  
                    I ve never even -- I m sorry, you 
                    said Reddington surrendered?  Why?

                                    RESSLER
                    We re working on that.

      She stops.  He turns.

                                  LIZ
                    You re telling me this guy s eluded 
                    the F.B.I. for over twenty-five 
                    years, and he s suddenly decided to 
                    give himself up to chat with me?

                                    RESSLER
                    Consider yourself flattered. 


      Liz sits in silence with THREE AGENTS.  Ressler and Cooper 
      enter.  They ve been talking.  Cooper sits across from Liz.  

                                  COOPER
                    Harold Cooper.  Assistant Director 
                    of Counterterrorism.

                                  LIZ
                    Yes, sir.  I know who you are, sir.

                                  COOPER
                    Wanna tell us what s gong on? 

      Nobody notices how Liz clutches her right hand into a fist; 
      nervously opening and closing the grip, running her fingers 
      against the skin of her palm.

                                  LIZ
                    I ve been vetted by the agency like 
                    everyone else.  Same background 
                    checks.  Psych profiles.  I m sure 
                    OPR s trolling my digital footprint 
                    right now, and I can tell you what 
                    they ll find.  Nothing.  I have no 
                    history with Reddington. 

      Cooper watches Liz.  Isn t convinced.                                                                                    15.


                                  COOPER
                    They tell me today s your first day 
                    as a profiler.

                                  LIZ
                    Yes.  Reassigned from New York.  
                    Graduated Quantico last month. 

                                  COOPER
                      Congratulations.  
                          (flat)
                    Profile yourself.  

                                  LIZ
                    Sir?

                                  COOPER
                    Who are you?  What does he see?  
                    Profile Elizabeth Keen.

                                  LIZ
                    Oh, uhm.  Well..
                          (uneasy)
                    I ve been with the Bureau for four 
                    years; head of the Mobile Emergency 
                    Psych Unit in New York.  Worked 
                    bank robberies, murder, extortion -- 

                                  COOPER
                    We ve read your resume.

      Liz looks trapped for a moment.  Uneasy silence.  Then 
      something clicks and it s as if another woman emerges --

                                  LIZ
                    My colleagues call me  sir .  They 
                    think I m a bitch.  Like most kids 
                    who raise themselves, I display 
                      narcissistic behavior.  I can be 
                      withdrawn.  Disconnected.

      -- she speaks with complete transparency. 

                                  LIZ
                    Despite, or perhaps because of my 
                    past, I have a deep yearning to 
                      understand the criminal mind.  I m 
                    board certified in forensic 
                      psychology, and yet I m under the 
                    delusion I can erase my childhood 
                    by having kids of my own.  All this 
                    manifests itself in the occasional, 
                      regrettable, fit of anger. 

      The agents are speechless.  Liz blinks.  Feels naked.                                                                                     16.


                                  COOPER
                    Do you find it odd Reddington  
                      surrendered himself the same day 
                    you started working as a profiler?

                                  LIZ
                    It suggests he was waiting for me. 

                                  COOPER
                    Why you specifically?

                                  LIZ
                    Because I m new.  He thinks I can 
                    be easily manipulated.  Obviously, 
                    the man doesn t know me very well. 

      There s a strength within this woman that s undeniable.


      Liz, Cooper and Ressler are escorted through a series of SCIF 
        checkpoints.  Through the most secure areas of the Bureau and 
      down into...   

      THE HIVE.

      They wind their way through a maze of monitors, techs, and 
      control boards.  This is mission control and the room from 
      which Red is carefully monitored. 

      The techs and support staff FALL SILENT as Liz moves through 
      their space.  We sense their collective respect; like Romans 
      watching a gladiator enter the Coliseum.

      Cooper and Liz stop before a steel door.

                                  COOPER
                    If you need anything, remember, 
                    we re right here.

      This doesn t give Liz comfort.  Suddenly, a chest-rattling 
      ALARM sounds.  Hydraulic locks disengage.  Liz steps into...

      A MASSIVE AUDITORIUM.

      State of the art.  Impenetrable.  At the center of this dark 
      room is a small, BULLETPROOF PRISON TUBE.  Red sits alone 
      under the hot lights.  He sees Liz and he rises.  Her heart 
      pounds as she steps inside...   

      RED S CONTAINMENT CELL.

                                  RED
                    Agent Keen.  What an honor.                                                                                    17.


      He extends his hand like a boy on a date.  Liz keeps her arms 
      folded and tries to project confidence.  Drags the only other 
      chair in the cell to Red s side of the table --

                                  LIZ
                    I heard you wanna talk.

      -- she sits.  Red is captivated.  We INTERCUT with the Hive 
      as everyone watches the monitors in silence.  

                                  LIZ 
                    Well?  

      Red can t take his eyes off of Liz. 

                                  LIZ
                    You re the one who surrendered.  
                    Made all the demands.  Asked me 
                    here.  I m here.

                                  RED
                    You got rid of your highlights.  
                    Much less Baltimore.  Do you get 
                    back home much?

      She tries not to look surprised by this.

                                  LIZ
                    Tell me about Zamani.

                                  RED
                    I haven t been home in years.

      Liz feigns a smile.  Takes a moment.  She needs to establish 
      she s the alpha dog here. 

                                  LIZ
                    Your wife, Ellen, you know she 
                    lights a candle every Christmas 
                    Eve.  Still mourns the day you 
                      disappeared even though she knows 
                    you re alive. 
                          (firm)
                    No way you d come back after twenty-
                    five years, face the life you left, 
                    everyone you betrayed, in order to 
                    settle some grudge.

                                  RED
                    Perhaps it s a sizable grudge.

                                  LIZ
                    Why involve me?  I m nobody.  First 
                    day.  Nothing special about me.                                                                                     18.


                                  RED
                    Oh, I think you re very special.  

      He says it in an weirdly erotic way.  Liz flicks a glance at 
      the agents behind the glass.  Her discomfort betrays her.

                                  RED
                    Within the hour, Ranko Zamani will 
                    abduct the daughter of U.S. General 
                    David Ryker.  His team will use an 
                    EM pulse bomb to create a diversion 
                    and grab the girl.  If you don t 
                    move quickly she will die.  That s 
                    what I know.  

                                  LIZ
                    And how do you know this?

                                  RED
                    Because I m the one who got Zamani 
                    into the country.

                                  LIZ
                    I should believe you?

                                  RED
                    Of course not.  I m a criminal.  
                    Criminals are liars.  Everything 
                    about me is a lie.
                          (then)
                    But if anyone can give me a second 
                    chance, it s you.  The two of us 
                    have overcome so much.

      Liz leans back.  Doesn t like this. 

                                  RED
                    I mean, look at you.  Abandoned by 
                    a father who was a career criminal.  
                    A mother who worked two jobs, 
                    despite her addiction, to keep you 
                    in school, out of juvenile court.  
                    You practically raised yourself.  
                    And yet here you are, about to make 
                    a name for yourself, about to catch 
                    Ranko Zamani.  
                          (deadpan)
                    I m gonna make you famous, Lizzy.

                                  LIZ
                    Don t call me Lizzy.

      She says it with force, but she s screaming inside.                                                                                     19.


                                  RED
                    We both know the past does not 
                    equal the future.  You ve learned 
                    from your experiences, they ve 
                    given you tremendous insight. 
                    That s why you re gonna believe me. 

      Off Red s lewd smile we SLAM CUT TO:

      THE HIVE - SECONDS LATER

      Liz BURSTS through the door.  Shoulders past Cooper and goes 
      directly to Ressler. 

                                  LIZ
                    What did you tell him?

                                    RESSLER
                    What?!  Nothing.

                                  LIZ
                    Then how did he know those things?  
                    Private things?  About my family?!

                                    RESSLER
                    Why didn t your father s criminal 
                    record show up in your background 
                    report?  You told us he --

      She turns to Cooper.

                                  LIZ
                    I think we should contact the SWAT 
                    commander at Quantico; roll a team 
                    to the girl s school.

                                    RESSLER
                    Nonsense.  He s bluffing.

                                  LIZ
                    He s establishing his value.

                                    RESSLER
                    I ve been the field agent on this 
                    guy for eight years, trust me --

                                  LIZ
                    -- and eight years got you what?  
                    You asked me here.  You asked my 
                    opinion.  So here it is: that girl 
                    is gonna be taken. 

      Cooper considers this.  Wheels turning.                                                                                       20.


                                  COOPER
                    Roll HRT to the school.  Call 
                    Bolling AFB Command, patch us 
                    through to General Ryker.


      Liz steps into a stall and closes the door.  Needs a minute 
      to gather herself.  She takes a few calming breaths before -- 

      BAMM... BAMM... BAMM...

      -- she SLAMS HER FIST into the wall of the stall repeatedly.  
      Raw unchecked energy.  Liz falls back.  Making that habitual 
      rolling fist; running her fingers against her palm until she 
      grabs her phone.  Dials her husband.

                                  TOM (O.S.)
                    Lizzy, hey, What s going on?  I ve 
                    been wanting to call, but --

                                  LIZ
                    I need to hear your voice.

                                  TOM (O.S.)
                    What s with the helicopter?

                                  LIZ
                    The helicopter was nothing.  I just 
                    had an interview with -- I can t 
                    even tell you.  Classified.  This 
                    entire day is classified.  I flew 
                    over the White House!

                                  TOM
                    Over the what?!

                                  LIZ
                    I m telling you, they gave me Level 
                    Four clearance.  Insane.  I just 
                      interviewed the number four... I 
                    met with the Assistant Director...

                                  TOM
                    Okay.  Breathe.  Just breathe. 

                                  LIZ
                    If you knew half the things --

                                  TOM
                    I can t.  Remember?  Classified.  
                    Those things, they don t matter 
                    because you re gonna be amazing.                                                                                    21.


                                  LIZ
                    Tell me I can do this.

                                  TOM
                    Lizzy, when have you ever failed?

      This lands with her.  Calms her.  

                                  LIZ
                    I don t deserve you.  I promise 
                    I ll make this up to you, let s 
                    take tonight and --

      WHAM!!!

      The stall door flies open and Liz finds herself standing face 
      to face with Ressler, chest heaving --

                                    RESSLER
                    What are you doing with that phone?  
                    We re on a SCIF floor.  You can t --

                                  LIZ
                          (to Tom)
                    Gotta go, babe. 

      -- she clicks the phone off.

                                    RESSLER
                    You put on a great show in there.  
                    Sounded real smart.  But you better 
                    pull yourself together because you 
                    just called in the calvary.  HRT.  
                    SWAT.  This is your show now.  Your 
                    neck on the line. 

      He yanks a strip of toilet paper.  Puts it in Liz s hand.  

                                    RESSLER
                    Wipe your nose.  We re all waiting.

                                                      CUT TO BLACK.

                    END OF ACT ONE                                                                                    22.


                              ACT TWO


      A MARINE in dress blues moves through the Defense Department 
      headquarters, past security, and into a room full of GENERALS 
      gathered around a table.  The men turn as --

      -- GENERAL DAVID RYKER stands.  Ryker (50 s) is a Four Star 
      General.  Distinguished.  Fierce.  The Marine salutes.

                                  MARINE
                    Sir.  We have a situation, Sir.  
                    It s about your daughter.


      SWAT teams storm the hallways as classrooms are evacuated.  
      Children everywhere.  Teachers direct kids into -- 

      THE PARKING LOT

      -- where AGENTS pile out of suburbans and into the SEA OF 
      CHILDREN.  Pandemonium.  A thousand little girls in plaid 
      skirts and sweaters.

                                    RESSLER
                    What the hell happened?

                                  POLICE COMMANDER
                    Campus security freaked, saw SWAT 
                    and activated the emergency plan.

                                    RESSLER
                    Where s the girl?

      Agents sort through the faces as Liz searches for -- 

                                  LIZ
                    Beth?!  I m looking for Beth Ryker!

      -- a teacher rushes BETH RYKER (8) toward Liz.  Beth is an 
      angel with two missing teeth.  Bright eyes.  Heart pounding.  

      Liz takes her hand.  Races toward the closest SUBURBAN.  She 
      can t find Ressler, but there s no time.  A SWAT AGENT lifts 
      the girl into the suburban and Liz dives in behind.  Motions 
      the driver. 


      Liz sits on a bench in a hallway.  A small bandage covering  
      a split in her brow.  She holds Beth s charm bracelet like a 
      rosary.  Stares ahead, unblinking, eyes locked on the silent 
      image of --

      -- General Ryker who can be seen through the glass wall of 
      Cooper s office.  Ryker is SCREAMING at Cooper and Ressler.  
        Eviscerating the agents.  Tears well in Liz s eyes as she 
      watches, heavy with guilt.  She knows she may have cost the 
      General s daughter her life.  

      Liz is watching this verbal brawl when her phone vibrates.  
      She looks down.  Six missed calls.  Realizing the time as --

                                  LIZ
                          (panicked)
                    Tom.  My God.  I meant to call. 

      -- we INTERCUT with Tom.  Pacing nervously.  Sneaking a call 
      in the hallway outside their ADOPTION AGENCY. 

                                  TOM
                    Are you close?  What s going on?  

                                  LIZ
                    I m stuck here. 

                                  TOM
                    Stuck?!  You re kidding, right?  
                      Everyone s waiting. 

                                  LIZ
                    I m the worst.  I m so sorry.  It s 
                    just, Tom, this crazy day --

      Ressler KNOCKS on the glass.  Waves Liz into the office for 
      her ass chewing.  She holds up a finger, asking the General 
      and the others wait, juggling Tom as -- 

                                  TOM
                          (soft / compassionate)
                    Lizzy, babe, if this is too much... 
                    we don t have to do this.  We can 
                    start a family next year -- I can 
                    tell these people right now.  But 
                    if we re gonna go through with this 
                    we gotta do it together.  I can t 
                    do it alone, Lizzy.  I need to know 
                    you re one-hundred percent.

      Liz looks at the waiting General.  Turns her back on him.  
      Her priorities suddenly slip into focus.                                                                                    27.


                                  LIZ
                    I m one hundred percent.

                                  TOM
                    You say that, but...

                                  LIZ
                    Tom.  Our family.  It s all that 
                    matters. 

      She s speaking from the heart.  He smiles.

                                  TOM
                    I believe you.  

                                  CASE AGENT (O.S.)
                    Mr. Keen?  Is your wife coming?

      Tom whips around.  Greets the CASE AGENT with a big, warm 
      smile and an extended hand as --

                                  TOM
                          (to Liz / tender)
                    Let me handle this.

                                  LIZ
                    Good luck, babe.  Love you.

      -- Liz hangs up.  Smiles to herself.  She loses herself in 
      the warmth of Tom when General Ryker comes storming out of 
      the office.  Moving down the hallway. 

                                  LIZ
                    Sir?

      The General turns to Liz.

                                  LIZ
                    I want to personally tell you how 
                    sorry I am for your daughter s --

                                    GENERAL RYKER
                          (seething)
                    You re not just out of a job.  I m 
                    gonna see to it the D.O.J. files 
                    charges.  Criminal negligence.  You 
                    better beg God my girl comes home 
                    alive because this thing s coming 
                    down on you, sweetheart.

      Ryker marches off down the hallway.

                                  LIZ
                          (calling out)
                    I m gonna get her back.                                                                                    28.


      As the General disappears, Liz plops down onto the bench.  
      Feeling helpless.  She looks at BETH S CHARM BRACELET and 
      clips it back around her wrist.  Considers the tiny animals.  
      She then opens her hand and we reveal --

      -- a BURN SCAR on the inside of Liz s palm.  It crawls up her 
      wrist and into her sleeve like a some twisted, blooming vine.  
      Liz makes a loose fist.  Runs her fingertips over the uneven 
      SCAR TISSUE; that habitual rolling motion.    

      We leave Liz there.  Wrestling with some distant memory.

                                                      CUT TO BLACK.

                           END OF ACT TWO                                                                                     29.


                             ACT THREE


      An Interrogator from the High-Value Interrogation Team sits 
      across from Red.  They ve been at this for hours.  

                                  INTERROGATOR
                    Is the girl dead?

      Red s silent.  Eyes locked on the Interrogator.

                                  INTERROGATOR
                    Is that why we haven t heard from 
                    the abductors?  No demands?  What 
                    other reason would there be?  
                          (inflamed)
                    It s been four hours.  You think 
                    we re gonna overlook the fact you 
                    turned yourself in the exact same 
                    day this thing went down?  

      IN THE HIVE...

      Cooper sees they re getting nowhere.  Knocks on the glass.  

                                  COOPER
                    Kill the cameras.  Everyone out.

      CUT TO:

      GENERAL RYKER.  Chest full of medals.  He sits down before 
      Red who is not intimidated whatsoever.

                                    GENERAL RYKER
                    The US Government doesn t negotiate 
                    with terrorists.  But I m not the 
                      government.  I m here as a father. 

      Red blinks at the General s medals as if they re meaningless. 

                                    GENERAL RYKER
                    Is this about immunity?  You want 
                    your crimes forgiven?  I m personal 
                    friends with the Attorney General.  
                    There are things you ve done that I 
                    can make people forget. 

      Silence.  The General EXPLODES.

                                    GENERAL RYKER
                    ANSWER ME!  This is a my baby s 
                    life we re talking about.  Your 
                    people haven t made one demand!                                                                                    30.


                                  RED
                    I already told you people how this 
                    works.  You wanna talk?  Go get 
                    Elizabeth Keen. 

      The General stares daggers.


      Liz does a walk of shame.  Past Cooper.  Past Ryker.  All 
      eyes are on Red s  chosen one  as she makes her way into...

      RED S HOLDING CHAMBER.

      Red extends his hand.  Liz keeps her arms folded.  He sees 
      Liz is wearing the CHARM BRACELET Beth gave her; the one with 
      the tiny plastic animals.

                                  RED
                    Nice bobble.  Reminds me of my 
                    daughter.  She loved jewelry --

                                  LIZ
                    Where s the girl?

                                  RED
                    -- you women and your jewelry.     

                                  LIZ
                    It s been four hours.

                                  RED
                    I told you Zamani would take her.   
                    Told you that s all I knew.  It s 
                    in your hands now.   

      He notices the way Liz is nervously opening and closing her 
      fist, running her fingers against the skin of her palm --

                                  RED
                    Why do you do that? 

      -- she places her hand in her lap.

                                  LIZ
                    I need your help with Zamani.

                                  RED
                    How about we trade.  You tell me, I 
                    tell you.  Tell me about that scar 
                    on your palm.  I ve noticed how you 
                    hide it.

      Liz swallows.  Reluctant.                                                                                     31.


                                  LIZ
                    There was a fire.  I was fourteen.

                                  RED
                    Someone tried to hurt you.

                                  LIZ
                    Not exactly.

                                  RED
                    But the scar, what does it remind 
                    you of?  When you touch it?  
                          (reaching out)
                    May I?  

      Liz reluctantly extends her hand.  Red takes her palm, runs 
      his fingertips over the scar tissue as if he might see into 
      her past.  It s uncomfortable.  Red s thumb follows the scar 
      up her arm, under her sleeve.  He looks into her eyes.

                                  RED
                    Is a child really what you want?

      Liz pulls away.  Stunned.

                                  LIZ
                    How on earth do you know --

                                  RED
                    I know it s exciting, that you ve 
                    waited, but a baby can t fix what 
                    happened in the past.

      She stands, indignant. 

                                  LIZ
                    How dare you.  You lost the 
                    privilege of speaking about 
                      parenthood when you abandoned your 
                    wife and daughter on Christmas Eve.  
                    Addy, right?  How old would she be 
                    now?  Thirty?  You don t know 
                    because you walked away, so keep 
                    the Fatherly advice to yourself. 

                                  RED
                    You won t find the girl until you 
                    learn to look at this differently. 

                                  LIZ
                    And how should I look at this?

                                  RED
                    Like a criminal.  It may come 
                    easier to you than you think.   
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    32.

                                  RED (cont'd)
                    Shall I show you?
 

      Liz and the other agents watch as Red walks the room eyeing 
      the MASSIVE WALL OF CLUES.  He moves with a sense of pride 
      and curiosity.  Takes in the details.    

                                  LIZ
                    So?

      Red steps back.  Considers the collage of PHOTOS and POLICE 
      REPORTS.  Silence.  Then with complete confidence -- 

                                  RED
                      Irrelevant.

      -- he TEARS DOWN A MUG SHOT.  Rips down a surveillance photo.

                                  RED
                    Waste of time.

                                    RESSLER
                    Hey, you can t just --

      Red continues down the wall, pulling down precious documents, 
      moving pieces.  The analysts watch in disbelief as Red weeds 
      out the unimportant.  He grabs a surveillance photo and rips 
      it in half; holds up the half with the image of a YOUNG SERB.

                                  RED
                    Miroslav.  He s more than a driver.  
                    They call him The Chemist.  Weapons 
                    expert.  Turned down MIT to work 
                    for al-Qaeda in South Africa.

      Red pins THE CHEMIST to the wall, then grabs a photo of a 
      GROUP OF MEN outside of bank --  

                                  RED
                    The German?  Reinhardt?  You re 
                    right that if money was involved he 
                    laundered it, but his Swiss account 
                    is a dead end.  He runs everything 
                    through a former IRS man named 
                    Kagel.  Works through the Caymans.  
                          (eyes scanning)
                    What about the girl?  What do you 
                    have on the girl and her father?

      An analyst works keyboard.  Images of BETH fill the screens.  
      Beth s school portrait.  Beth and her father, General Ryker.

                                  RED
                    What do you see, Lizzy?                                                                                    33.


      She blinks at Red.  Only Tom calls her Lizzy.  

                                  LIZ
                    Well, the timeline would suggest a 
                    singular event.  Something in DC.  
                    Not sure how the girl fits. 

                                  RED
                    What about the Chemist?

                                  LIZ
                      Important.  Well paid.  What he s 
                    planning is expensive, maybe some 
                    kind of attack.

                    You re thinking like a cop.  What 
                    does a criminal see?

                    Taking the general s daughter was

                    carries Nipah virus.  Dying makes 
                    him dangerous.  Nothing to lose.

                    unknown chemical agents.  Poisoned

                    Because he needs her.  Zamani lost

      Agents pour into the tiny motel near Reagan National.  They 
      throw  THE INNKEEPER  to the ground.  Hands behind his head.  
      Boots on his neck.  As the Innkeeper begs, we JUMP BACK TO:


      SWAT TEAMS burst down the door and the inhabitants scramble.  
      Some sort of lab.  The agents push through a door into a room 
      filled with elaborate BOMB MAKING SUPPLIES.  They pull a 
      FIGURE down from the fire escape.  Hands behind the head.   


      Liz returns home.  It s like entering another world.  Soft 
      music.  Candlelight.  In the entry, she finds a small PINK 
      WICKER ROCKING CHAIR stuffed with pink blankets, books and 
      bibs.  Mylar balloons proclaim,  IT S A GIRL!  -- 

                                  LIZ
                    Oh, my God.  Did they say yes?!

      -- in the arms of a stuffed animal Liz finds the ADOPTION 
      PAPERWORK.  Opens it.  Tears standing in her eyes.

                                  LIZ
                    It s OFFICIAL?  How did you -- I 
                    can t believe...

      Liz rounds the corner to find Tom, his back to her, seated at 
      a beautiful candlelight dinner.  There s Champagne.  Flowers. 
      Her shoulders drop as Liz sits down and looks to Tom to see --

                                  LIZ
                    We re gonna have a baby!

      -- TOM IS DUCT TAPED TO THE CHAIR.

      He s been BEATEN and TORTURED.  Zip-ties on his wrists.  Tape 
      over his mouth.  Pure fucking horror in his eyes.                                                                                     37.


      Liz s heart stops as a DARK FIGURE reaches past her breast, 
      into her jacket, and delicately removes her WEAPON.  He s a 
      colorless TWIG OF A MAN, chemical burns on his neck and jaw.  
      As he sits at the table between Liz and Tom we meet --

      -- RANKO ZAMANI.  An anemic little ghost.  Looks like he was 
      raised in a veal cage.  Zamani speaks with a thick SERBIAN 
      ACCENT.  His lungs rattle with each breath.

                                  ZAMANI
                    Tom and I already have met.  Been 
                    talking.  Trying to figure out how 
                    you knew I was in town. 

      Liz looks to Tom.  There s blood matted in his hair.  The 
      vessels of one eye have ruptured.

                                  ZAMANI
                    I tell him you took the General s 
                    daughter minutes before I was going 
                    to.  Forced me to re-think things, 
                    which I did quite well, I think.   

      Zamani serves himself a slice of fish --  

                                  ZAMANI
                    But then your people come for my 
                    Chemist friend.

      -- pours himself a glass of Champagne and takes a drink.

                                  ZAMANI
                    I was finished with the Chemist, so 
                    you save me a payment for services.  
                    For that, I thank you.  But it did 
                    make me wonder what else you know. 
                          (pointed)
                    What else do you know?

      Zamani takes a bite, chewing through heavy, hoarse breaths.

                                  ZAMANI
                    Over here.  I ask question.  What 
                    else do you know about my plan?

                                  LIZ
                    An attack... uhm, a bomb maybe.  
                    We re not sure, we don t know --

      Zamani stands.  Pours Liz a glass of Champagne.                                                                                      38.


                                  LIZ 
                    -- we only knew about the girl.  
                      Everything else... speculation.  
                          (through tears)
                    Tom, babe, it s gonna be okay --

      SPLOOSH -- Zamani buries his STEAK KNIFE in the meat of Tom s 
      thigh.  Tom let s out a MUFFLED SCREAM.  

                                  ZAMANI
                    What.  Else.  Do you know?

                      I swear... nothing...

      Zamani holds his chest.  Removes a POCKET-SIZED CONTAINER of 
      pills from his jacket and puts one on his tongue.  Chases it 
      with Champagne.  As he does, we see -- 

      -- a penny-sized TATTOO on the back of Zamani s hand.  It s 
      the SILHOUETTE OF A SUNBURST; jagged rays reaching out from 
      the center, violently whipping about.  

                                  ZAMANI
                    You are not as smart as Reddington 
                    says.  My friend, he was always so 
                    obsessed with you.  Not sure why.

                    What I have planned will make for 
                    many casualties.  Chemical agents, 
                    no?  What you call... biblical.  So 
                    now you have choice: stop me now 
                    and save many Americans... or save 
                    only one.  What do you choose?

      Zamani yanks the knife from Tom s thigh and PLUNGES IT INTO 
      TOM S ABDOMEN.  He turns the knife, DRAGS IT to his sternum.  
      Liz SCREAMS.  She LEAPS UP as -- 

      -- Zamani leaves.  Liz chases, but stutter-steps back to Tom.  
      Can t have both.  She runs to Tom.  Holds him.  Dials 911 as 
      Zamani vanishes.  Blood everywhere.  Phone ringing.

      transport Tom out of the ambulance as --

      WHAM!!!

      runs alongside Tom s gurney, covered in smeared blood.  Tom s 
      drifting in and out of consciousness.  Voices fading until... 


      POLICE interview Liz.  There s no sound.  All she can hear is 
      their surreal murmur, as if underwater.  Liz looks up to find 
      Ressler entering the ER.  He approaches, arms open, and Liz 
      collapses into him.

                    team.  I don t know you.  I didn t 
                    ask for any of --

                                  RED
                    This is bigger than us, Liz.  We re 
                    at the center of something that you 
                    can t possibly understand.  

                                  LIZ
                      Goddamnit, I want the truth!

                                  RED
                      Honestly?!  The truth?  The truth 
                    is Zamani did you a favor, Lizzy.

      Suddenly, Liz pulls THE PEN from her pocket -- 

      STABS RED IN THE NECK

      -- spins around and traps him in a military choke-hold.  

                                  LIZ
                    I told you not to call me Lizzy.

      She holds her thumb over the bloody PUNCTURE WOUND in Red s 
      neck.  His breathing quickens.  His eyes bulge.   

                                  LIZ (CONT D)
                    Now, you were in the army, so you 
                    know from training I just punched a 
                    hole in your carotid.  The artery 
                    will likely vasospasm; reduce its 
                    own flow.  Best chance, one minute 
                    before you pass out.  So here s how 
                    it works, asshole...
                          (fearless)
                    You tell me how I find Zamani and 
                    make this right, or I let you die 
                    right here.  Understand?

                                  RED
                    Yes, but...

      Red gasps for breath, clinging to life.

                                  RED
                    ...if you let me die, you ll never 
                    learn the truth about your husband.

                                  LIZ
                    You know nothing about my husband.                                                                                    42.


      Red allows a faint little smile.  Strangely, Liz is the one 
      who now looks trapped.  Wheels turning.  She has no choice 
      but to call -- 

                                  LIZ
                    GUARD, I NEED A MEDIC!

      Red falls to the floor.  Guards rush in as Liz collapses next 
      to Red trying to stop the bleeding.  She barks orders.  Blood 
      everywhere.  We jump from the chaotic frenzy to:


      Liz sits in a fog, doing another round of interviews with the 
      POLICE.  There s no sound.  Only a dull BUZZING SOUND.  Liz 
      watches the detectives comb through her life.  They collect 
      samples.  Take pictures.  But Liz can t take her eyes off of 
      Tom s DRIED-BLACK BLOOD in the carpet. 

      LATER...

      After the police are gone.  Liz is on her hands and knees 
      scrubbing the blood out of the carpet with a bucket and 
      brush.  As she does the BUZZING SOUND swells, mimicking her 
      rising frustration.  

      The harder she scrubs the more helpless Liz feels.  She is 
      completely powerless.  Finally, Liz THROWS the brush across 
      the room.  Bloody water splatters the wall as we CUT TO: 


      We follow Liz down a long, narrow hallway.  She flashes her 
      badge.  Moves past security.  Finds Ressler who is speaking 
      with another agent outside Red s room.  

                                    RESSLER
                    Can t go in.  He s with the Nurse.
                          (then)
                    You shouldn t even be here.

                                  LIZ
                    I know.  I was out of line before, 
                    but I can t just sit at home and 
                    wait while there s a chemical...

      Liz trails off as the MALE NURSE exits Red s room.  Pushes 
      his cart past.  She waits until the Nurse is out of earshot. 

                                  LIZ
                    This isn t just about me and Tom.  
                    That weapon is going to detonate.  
                    We still don t know where.  Red is 
                    willing to talk to me.  Please.  
                    Give me ten minutes. 

      Reluctant, Ressler nods.  Allows Liz past.  But as Liz steps 
      into RED S ROOM she sees the bed is EMPTY.  The window OPEN.  
      Her entire world seems to slow down and Liz realizes... 

      Red is GONE.                                                                                     44.


      Liz steps back into the hall.  Sees the MALE NURSE who just 
      left Red s room.  He steps into the elevator.  As he locks 
      eyes with Liz, we recognize the Nurse as Red s chauffeur from 
      the opening scene: THE MAN IN THE GREY FLANNEL SUIT.  Liz 
      steps toward him, dizzy with fear, but the elevator doors 
      close and we JUMP TO:


      Red cuts into his shoulder with a surgical scalpel.  He opens 
      the muscle with the tip of the blade.  Digs out the tiny RFID 
      microchip.  He uses the tip of the knife to hold the chip up 
      to the light.  Admires the device.  The sound of an oncoming 
      whistle tells us we re...


      Red shoulders his way through the Rotunda.  He s now wearing 
      a stolen topcoat and fedora.  He finds a table outside a busy 
      coffee shop and sits down next to a thin, HUNCHED FIGURE.  As 
      the man turns, we reveal it s Zamani.  The two men hug. 

                                  RED
                    It s good to see you, old friend.

                                                  CUT TO BLACK.

                         END OF ACT FOUR                                                                                    45.


                            ACT FIVE


      Zamani sits with Red, genuinely humbled. 

                                  ZAMANI
                    Face to face.  What an honor.

                                  RED
                    I felt it was important to handle 
                    these final details myself.   

      Red hands Zamani a PASSPORT and TRAVEL DOCUMENTS.

                                  RED
                    How did things go with Agent Keen?

                                  ZAMANI
                    Paid her a visit like you asked.

                                  RED
                    And Tom?  The Husband?

                                  ZAMANI
                    Like you asked.  Small price to pay 
                    for getting me out of the country.


      The hospital is in lock-down.  F.B.I. response teams are in 
      full force.  Ressler hangs up his phone, turns to Cooper.

                                    RESSLER
                    You do realize this is exactly what 
                    he wanted?!  To get here.  Where 
                      security s weak.  We played right 
                    into his hand.

                                  LIZ
                    Why escape?  He just surrendered?

                                    RESSLER
                    Who knows?!  This guy has a plan 
                    and he s played us at every turn. 

        A breathless TECH bursts into the room, chest heaving. 

                                  TECH
                    We were able to remotely reactivate 
                    the chip.  He s at Columbus Circle.

                                  COOPER
                    My God.  Union Station.                                                                                    46.


                                  LIZ
                    Wait.  No.  If Red pulled the chip 
                    he would have destroyed --

                                  COOPER
                    I need you to stay here.

                                  LIZ
                    Red is smarter than this. 

      The agents race out, leaving Liz, as we JUMP BACK TO:


      Red sits with Zamani, inspecting his eyes.

                                  RED
                    Word is you have big plans. 

      Zamani shrugs.

                                  RED
                    Tell me one thing: the General s 
                    daughter.  Why take such a risk?

                                  ZAMANI
                    This is about so much more than one 
                    girl; it s about the children.  All 
                    of them.  The ones who will grow up 
                    with my memory living inside them, 
                    as I ve lived with the memory your 
                    country gave me...

      Zamani holds his chest.  Shallow breaths.  He reaches into 
      his jacket and removes his pocket-sized CONTAINER OF PILLS.  
      As he takes one out.  Places it on his tongue.

                                  ZAMANI
                    I m giving their plague back to 
                    them.  Giving it to their children.  
                    In sixty years they ll be talking 
                    about this day, about my legacy.  

                                  RED
                    We should all be so fortunate.   

      Red stands as F.B.I. AGENTS STORM THE ROTUNDA --

      -- RESSLER leads the charge, pushing through the crowd.  In 
      his earpiece, he s guided by a TECH in a surveillance van, 
      but when he arrives at the table Red and Zamani are gone.

                                  TECH (O.S.)
                    Up ahead.  Fifty yards.                                                                                    47.


      Ressler moves toward Red.  Toward the trains.  Red quickly 
      opens his phone and dials as we INTERCUT with Liz inside --

      RED S HOSPITAL ROOM

      -- her CELL RINGS.  Liz answers. 

                                  RED (O.S.)
                    There s a wrinkle.  Zamani wants 
                    more than the General s daughter. 

                                  LIZ
                          (perplexed)
                    Red?!  Where are -- how did you...

      She steps away from the room.  Away from the police.  

                                  RED (O.S.)
                    He s after children.  

                                  LIZ
                    You son of a bitch, if you think 
                    I m not gonna hunt you down and --

                                  RED (O.S.)
                    We don t have time.  I need you to 
                    set aside your anger.  Listen to 
                    me.  I think between the two of us 
                    there may be an answer. 

      Liz bursts through the doors and steps --

      OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL.

      -- scans the parking lot.  Eyes searching.  Halfway expecting 
      to find Red watching her.  

                                  RED (O.S.)
                    I need you to tell me what Zamani 
                    said.  Think back.  What happened 
                    in your house?  What did you see?  

      Liz tries to remember, her world SPINNING.

                                  LIZ
                    He, uhm, he asked about the girl... 
                    and about the Chemist...

      IMAGES FLIP THROUGH LIZ S MEMORY.  We see FLASHES of the  
      confrontation.  Of Zamani torturing Tom --

                                  RED (O.S.)
                    What did you see?  At your house?

      -- the dizzy assault of MEMORIES take Liz to:                                                                                    48.




      We remember Zamani standing over Tom.  He opens his container 
      of pills and places one on his tongue.  As he does we see the 
      penny-sized TATTOO on the back of Zamani s hand -- 

                                  LIZ (O.S.)
                    There was a tattoo.

      -- it s the SILHOUETTE OF A SUNBURST; jagged rays reaching 
      out from the center, violently whipping about.  

                                  RED (O.S.)
                    Zamani s Serbian Orthodox.  He 
                    wouldn t tattoo himself.  Body 
                      modification is a desecration.  

                                  LIZ (O.S.)
                    I know what I saw.  This mark, I ve 
                    seen it before --  

                                  RED (O.S.)
                    It wasn t a tattoo.

      ON LIZ (PRESENT)

      As she wrestles with a memory.  Thinking back.

                                  RED (O.S.)
                    Where did you see it, Lizzy?


      Liz remembers her frantic morning.  Being late.  Tom holding 
      the TWO TOURISM BROCHURES for his field trip.

                                  TOM
                    Air and Space or the National Zoo?

      Liz flicks the zoo brochure.  We see the same SUNBURST IMAGE 
      in the brochure.  The logo for the Smithsonian National Zoo.

                                  LIZ (O.S.)
                    It wasn t a tattoo...
                          (realizing)
                    ...it was a stamp.

      BACK TO LIZ (PRESENT)

                                  LIZ
                    He s gonna bomb the National Zoo.                                                                                    49.



      Ressler shadows Red through the station.  But as the train 
      pulls away, Ressler sees the platform is empty.

                                    RESSLER
                    Where did he go?

                                  TECH (O.S.)
                    In front of you.  Twenty yards.

                                    RESSLER
                    There s nobody.

      Ressler sees the TUNNEL and jumps down onto THE TRACKS.


      Liz weaves through traffic.  Cell phone to her ear.

                                  LIZ
                          (on the phone)

      Liz hangs up.  Dials Ressler.  She s sent to voice mail.

                                  LIZ
                          (on the phone)
                    Ressler, call me.  The zoo.    
                    Zamani s gonna hit the zoo.


      Agents shove through the station.  Searching for the bomb.  
      Cooper grabs a little girl with a backpack and turns her 
      around.  It s not Beth.  He searches the crowd as --

      -- another agent sees a GIRL.  Whips her around.  Again, not 
      Beth.  It s a frantic search.  Backpacks.  Dark haired little 
      girls.  A needle in a haystack. 


        A flashlight beam dances in the dark as Ressler chases Red 
      INTO THE TUNNELS.  Something falls from Red s pocket before 
      Red slows down.  Slump shouldered.  Out of breath. 

                                    RESSLER
                    Hands in the air.                                                                                    51.


      Ressler trains his WEAPON on Red.  Picks up the small tin 
      canister Red dropped as THE LIGHT OF A TRAIN illuminates the 
      tunnel.  Reveals it s not Red he s been chasing but Zamani.  
      He clutches his chest.  Lungs failing.  

                                    RESSLER
                    GET OFF THE TRACK.

      Ressler steps closer.  The TRAIN is almost upon them. 

                                  ZAMANI
                    Tell the General his girl was an 
                       unfortunate civilian casualty .

      He opens his arms as --

      THE TRAIN EVISCERATES ZAMANI.

      Ressler ducks into the nearby alcove.  Inches from the train.  
      As it passes, he opens Zamani s medicine canister and dumps 
      the contents into his palm.  Among the pills he finds --

                                    RESSLER
                    Son of a bitch.

      -- the blood crusted RFID CHIP Red carved from his shoulder.


      A review is underway.  Red sits across from Liz, Cooper, 
      Ressler and a team of D.O.J. LIAISONS.  Tempers run hot.                                                                                     54.


                                  COOPER 
                    You gave away a biological weapon.

                                  RED
                    So the bomb is gone.  It didn t 
                    detonate.  The girl s safe.  Zamani 
                    is dead.  Frankly, I think all this 
                    worked out swimmingly.  

                                    RESSLER
                          (livid)
                    This was never about Zamani.  You 
                      surrendered and infiltrated the 
                    F.B.I. to get at our intelligence.  
                    To get that weapon.  

                                  RED
                    Agent Ressler, are you suggesting I 
                    would surrender myself and use your 
                    resources to hunt down Zamani and 
                    settle a score?  Steal a biological 
                    weapon?  That all of this is part 
                    of a some larger plot?
                          (flat)
                    I think it s more likely I tried to 
                    help in good faith, but had to 
                    finish the job on my own because 
                    you were too goddamned stupid.

      Ressler stands, livid.

                                  COOPER
                    I think we re finished.

                                  RED
                    This was fun.  Let s do it again.

      Cooper closes his notebook.  Meeting over.  But as the agents 
      begin to gather their things, Red remains seated.  

                                  RED
                    No, really.  Let s do it again.
                    You do understand, Zamani was only 
                    the first.

                                  COOPER
                    First what?

                                  RED
                    Name.  On the Blacklist.

      Cooper looks confused.  Throws Liz a glance.   

                                  COOPER
                    What s... the Blacklist?                                                                                    55.


                                  RED
                    It s why we re all here, of course.  
                    My wish list.  A list of names I ve 
                    been cultivating for over twenty-
                    five years; politicians, mobsters, 
                    hackers and spies.

                                    RESSLER
                    We have our own list.

                                  RED
                    Please, Agent Ressler, we all know 
                    your  Top Ten  is little more than 
                      a publicity campaign.  Junior high 
                    bullies at best.  I m talking about 
                    the criminals who matter.  The men 
                    I ve spent my life protecting -- 
                    ones you can t find because you 
                    don t know they exist.  Zamani was 
                    a small fish.  I m Ahab.  But if 
                    you want the whales on my list, you 
                    gotta play by my rules.

      Cooper sits, intrigued.  Liz lingers.

                                  RED
                    One: I never stay in the same 
                    location two nights in a row.  Two: 
                    I want security.  I ve already 
                    vetted a list of twenty-four Secret 
                    Service agents, pick two from my 
                    list.  Three: I want an RFID tag 
                    imbedded in my neck -- not that 
                    garbage from VeriChip you stuck in 
                    my arm, I want the DARPA tested, 
                    fully encrypted, 8-millimeter tag.  
                    Four: whatever I tell you falls 
                    under an immunity package that I 
                    negotiate myself.  And finally... 
                    most importantly... 
                          (flat)
                    I speak only with Elizabeth Keen.

      The room turns to Liz in the doorway, but she is gone.


      Cooper stands with Liz outside Tom s room.  

                                  COOPER
                    ...do you understand?  We have one 
                    of the most dangerous criminals in 
                    the history of this agency in our 
                      possession.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    56.

                                  COOPER (cont'd)
                    Imagine what he could provide -- 
                    the kind of access the F.B.I., 
                    C.I.A., N.S.A. could only dream of.  
                    Liz the deal s in place, but he ll 
                    only talk to you.

                                  LIZ
                    Then maybe you should have checked 
                    with me before you cut the deal.  

      Liz walks off.  Has a dying husband to tend too.


      Liz is on her hands and knees trying to scrub Tom s blood out 
      of the carpet.  She sits back.  Looks at the mess.  She wants 
      this hideous reminder out of her life for good so we CUT TO: 

      LATER...

      The furniture is shoved aside and Liz is ripping back the 
      carpet with a claw hammer.  Going mad.  She pulls back a 
      swath, but stops when she sees --

      -- a series of CUTS IN THE SUB-FLOOR.  Boards that have been 
      removed and replaced.  It s a HIDING PLACE.  She uses the 
      hammer to pry up the boards to reveal a LARGE DUFFLE BAG.

      AT THE KITCHEN TABLE...

      Liz sits in silence staring at the bag.  Heart in her throat.  
      She finally finds the courage to unzip the bag to discover --

      -- BUNDLES OF CASH.  Lots of them.  Several hundred thousand 
      dollars worth.  Liz sits thunderstruck.  She reaches into the 
      side pocket of the duffle bag where she finds --

      -- a BUL M-5 PISTOL.  She holds the gun in her fist.  A sick, 
      drunken feeling washes over Liz as she reaches back into the 
      pocket and removes a bundle of -- 

      -- PASSPORTS.  Twelve of them.  Each with a different name 
      and nationality.  Each one with a PHOTO OF HER HUSBAND TOM.  
      Liz trembles.  Red was right.  The man she has come to love 
      is an imposter.  That eerie, drunken feeling carries us to: 


      The tubes are gone, but Tom is still unconscious.  Liz sits 
      at his side.  Betrayed.  Considering the man she thought she 
      loved.

                                  TOM (O.S.)
                    Was I dreaming?                                                                                    57.


      Liz blinks up.  Sees Tom staring up at her.  She looks into 
      the gaze of this imposter, totally paralyzed.  

                                  LIZ
                    Dreaming about what?

                                  TOM
                    Are we really gonna have a baby?

      Everything Liz is holding inside begins to crumble.  The 
      tears come fast.  Her world spinning.  She fakes a smile and 
      clutches her right hand into a fist; nervously running her 
      fingers against the skin of her palm until we JUMP TO:


      ARMED SOLDIERS escort Liz through a series of security check 
      points.  Into a the bowels of an anonymous ship.  She carries 
      herself with a sense of purpose.  A fire in her belly.  Liz 
      is shown through a doorway and into...

      A PRISON CELL. 

      Red steps forward.  Out of the shadows.  That soft smile.

                                  RED
                    You ve discovered something about 
                    your beloved husband, haven t you 
                    Lizzy?

      She SNAPS back --

                                  LIZ
                    My name s Liz, not Lizzy.  To you 
                    I m Agent Keen.  Now, let me tell 
                    you how this is gonna work: I ask 
                    the questions.  You answer.  Screw 
                    with me and I walk.  Starting right 
                    now, there are no more games, no 
                    more secrets...  
                          (fearless)
                    I want the truth. 

                                  RED
                    I m here to help you find it. 

      She stares at Red.  Into the unknown.

                                  LIZ
                    Tell me about this Blacklist. 

                                                      CUT TO BLACK.

                                THE END
