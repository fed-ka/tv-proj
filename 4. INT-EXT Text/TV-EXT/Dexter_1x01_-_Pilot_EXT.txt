      PROUD PARENTS sit on the grass, opened picnic baskets in 
      front of them.                                                                                       2.


      Their eyes focused on two dozen BOYS (12-14) wearing snappy 
      looking ties and jackets, singing a beautiful rendition of 
       Bach Magnificat. 

      With a flourish, the tuxedoed CHOIR MASTER (40 s), handsome, 
        all-American looking, with a scrubbed clean face, guides the 
      boys to the stunning crescendo. 

      The CROWD stands, ERUPTS with applause. The boys smile. 

      The Choir Master turns, bows to the audience -- more 
      applause, then rises, blows kisses to his perky little WIFE   
      and their TWO young DAUGHTERS standing in the front row.

                                  DEXTER (V.O.)
                          (contained excitement)
                    There he is -- Mike Donovan. He is the 
                    one. 

      BACK TO SCENE

      The kids all walk off the stage, join their happy parents on 
      the lawn. The Choir Master joins his wife, bends down, gives 
      her a kiss, hugs his two sweet little girls. 

      Everyone starts packing up their picnic baskets --

                                                                            CUT TO:


      The Choir Master walks his wife and daughters to a Buick 
      sedan. Helps them get in, buckles up the kids -- waves as the 
      car drives off.

      He turns, walks up the street, passes the Civic, but the Man 
      sitting behind the wheel is no longer there. 

      NEW ANGLE

      The Choir Master comes closer, closer to a --

      FORD TAURUS STATION WAGON

      And STOPS right before us, so close we can almost touch him. 
      He fumbles in his pocket for his keys and after a beat, the 
      key finally enters the lock, the station wagon door opens and 
      as the Choir Master slides in behind the wheel, SUDDENLY --

      A MAN                                                                                      3.



      POPS UP from the back seat, quicker than a jack in the box, 
      and with incredible quickness WHIPS a fishing line around the 
      Choir Master s neck, pulls it very TIGHT.  

      THE CHOIR MASTER S EYES go wide and his face turns white.

      The MAN behind him turns toward the camera, and we finally 
      SEE --

      DEXTER S FACE (30 s), good looking with carefully constructed 
      features, eyes that are full of life. 

      FREEZE FRAME ON HIS FACE 

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) 
                    My name is Dexter -- Dexter Morgan and 
                    I m going to kill this man tonight. 

      BACK TO SCENE

      Dexter turns back to Donovan, leans in close to his ear, 
      whispers menacingly. 

                                  DEXTER (CONT D)
                    You re mine now, so do exactly as I 
                    say.

                                    DONOVAN
                            (struggling, barely audible)
                    What do you want..?

      And Dexter pulls the fishing line tighter, cuts into 
      Donovan s skin.

                                  DEXTER
                          (hard)
                    I want you to be quiet.
                          (beat)
                    Be good and maybe I ll let you live a 
                    little longer. Now drive.

      And Donovan pulls out of the spot.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      The station wagon driving down a dirt road flanked by 
      swampland. It doesn t look good. We can see it in Donovan s 
      eyes. 

                                  DEXTER 
                    Turn here.                                                                                       4.



      Donovan turns the wheel and the car rumbles toward -- 


      The car stops in front of a ramshackle home -- clearly hasn t 
      been lived in for years. To the side of the house is a small 
      yard where we see THREE MOUNDS of dirt piled high. 

      The car STOPS. Donovan stares at the mounds, then snaps his 
      eyes shut. Dexter releases the noose.

                                  DEXTER 
                    Get out.

      Donovan STUMBLES out of the car, falls to the ground, starts 
      to whimper.

                                  DEXTER (CONT D)
                          (sharp, demanding)
                    You have to listen and do what I say. 
                    You should know that. It s important. 

      After a beat, Donovan slowly gets up and the two of them 
      stare at each other. There s a weird understanding between 
      the two. Dexter smiles, says softly --

                                  DEXTER (CONT D)
                    In the house.

      Dexter whips the fishing line back around the Donovan s neck 
      and they both walk up to the front door and enter --


      Dexter stands behind the wheel of his little whaler, put-put-
      puttering past the early morning fishing boats -- a huge 
      smile on his face. 

      Dexter eyes a leather-skinned FISHERMEN standing on his 
      commercial fishing boat -- waves to him.

                                  DEXTER
                    Ahoy -- Ahoy there, Captain. Any big 
                    Marlin out there today?

      The fisherman smiles, waves back and Dexter smiles wide as he 
      navigates his boat out of the bay.

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Whatever made me the way I am left me 
                    hollow, empty inside. People fake a 
                    lot of human interactions -- but I 
                    fake it all and I fake it very well. 

      A couple of speed boats cross dangerously in front of him.

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    And that s my plight -- I care about 
                    people as much as I care about lawn 
                    furniture but I can t blame my foster 
                    parents for that. Harry and Doris 
                    Morgan did a wonderful job raising me. 
                    But they re both dead now. 
                          (beat)
                    I didn t kill them. 
                          (beat)
                    Honest. 

      And just then a testosterone injected CIGARETTE BOAT cuts 
      across his bow causing a large wave to SPLASH over Dexter s 
      deck and we --

                                                                      FLASHBACK TO:


      It s a beautiful, warm Sunday afternoon in the bucolic woods, 
      overlooking a small, lazy river.                                                                                        9.



      HARRY (50 s), Dexter s foster father -- a diamond in the 
      rough, tough exterior, but soft at heart -- pulls a flask out 
      of his pants pocket, slowly unscrews the top, downs a slug of 
      booze, then slips the flask back into his pants. 

      YOUNG DEXTER (12) watches his father very carefully, then 
      picks up a small bottle of milk, unscrews the top, takes a 
      sip, screws the top back on, then tries to slip it into his 
      pants -- just like his father, but it doesn t fit so he sets 
      it aside. 

      Harry stares into nothingness -- then turns to his adopted 
      son and says very softly, simply --

                                  HARRY
                    You re different, aren t you, Dexter?

      Dexter swallows hard, looks nervously at his dad.

                                  YOUNG DEXTER
                          (haltingly)
                    What do you mean, Pop?

                                  HARRY
                    The Billups say Buddy disappeared. 

      Little Dexter turns away. 

                                  HARRY (CONT D)
                          (softly)
                    I found the grave, son.

                                  YOUNG DEXTER
                          (defensive)
                    That dog was a noisy little creep, 
                    Pop. He was barking all night and Mom 
                    couldn t sleep and she s very, very 
                    sick and that lousy dog was yapping at 
                    every leaf that blew down the 
                    sidewalk.

      Harry looks at Dexter.

                                  HARRY
                    There were a lot of bones in there, 
                    Dexter and...not just Buddy s.

      Little Dexter fidgets.

                                  HARRY (CONT D)
                    How long have you been doing this, 
                    son?                                                                                    10.



      Dexter looks away then looks back into his father s eyes.

                                  YOUNG DEXTER
                    About a year and a half. 
                          (beat)
                    Pop...Are you mad?

      Harry stares at little Dexter, then slowly drapes his arm 
      around his son and pulls him close. And as they stare into 
      the river water, we re suddenly -- 

                                                                            BACK ON:

      DEXTER 

      And as his boat disappears into the morning fog, we see the 
      back of the Whaler and it s named the  SLICE OF LIFE. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Dexter walks into his apartment, closes the door behind him. 
      It appears more like a library than a home -- book shelves 
      are everywhere and all the books are categorized, 
        alphabetized and lined up perfectly. 

      Dexter walks past a stack of files, all labeled  MISSING 
      PERSONS: PROPERTY OF MIAMI P.D.,  heads to the air 
      conditioner stuck in the window -- turns it up even colder. 

      In the middle of the room is a large desk -- with a computer 
      and the book Gray s Anatomy on top. 

      Dexter whips out a set of keys, unlocks the bottom desk 
      drawer, pulls out a long rectangular wood box, sets it on his 
      desk, lifts off the lid and from his shirt pocket, pulls out 
      the slide of blood we saw him extract from Donovan. 

      Dexter stares at it for a beat, then -- 

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) 
                    At least the code of Harry, my 
                    wonderful father, is satisfied. 
                          (beat)
                    And so am I. 

      He files it amongst many other slides inside the box, slams 
      the drawer shut, locks it, then picks up a Miami Police 
      Department folder entitled:  JAWORSKI.                                                                                     11.



                                  DEXTER (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    He was a great cop here in Miami,  
                    taught me how to think like one, even 
                    though I m not. Taught me how to cover 
                    my tracks. 
                          (beat)
                    I m a very neat monster. 

      As he puts the folder down, he notices his answering machine 
      is BLINKING. Dexter eyes it, presses a button and we HEAR --

                                  DEBRA (O.S.)
                      Dexter...DEXTER, YOU THERE?! ANSWER 
                    THE FUCKEN PHONE. 

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:


      And we see DEBRA (20 s -- Dexter s outstanding-looking foster 
      sister) dressed as a classic cheap whore, her shapely body  
      shrink wrapped tight in a pink neon tube-top, mini-skirt, 
      fishnet stockings and high heels, talking urgently into her 
      cell phone.

                                  DEBRA
                      Okay...Dex, please, soon as you get in 
                    -- I m at a crime scene by this shit-
                    hole, the Mamacita Motel and I need 
                    you here right away...Okay, Dex? 
                    Please. Pretty fucken please with 
                    cheese on top. 

      She slaps her cell phone closed and we --

                                                                      CUT BACK TO:

      DEXTER

      Smiling.

                                  DEXTER (V.O.)
                    That s my marvelous foul-mouthed 
                    foster sister, Deborah. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      LATER

      Dexter takes a very hot shower, lathers up all over, scrubs 
      his face hard, then kneads the shampoo deep into his scalp 
      and enjoys the whole experience a great deal.                                                                                    12.



                                  DEXTER (V.O.)
                    She s the only person in the world who 
                    cares if I m alive or dead. She loves 
                    me. Why? I don t know. I m unlovable.  
                    I have no feelings about anything.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Dexter quickly gets dressed. Slips on a snappy looking 
      bowling shirt, khakis, all light and airy. He s good to go. 

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) 
                    ...But if I could have feelings at 
                    all, I d have them for Deb. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Dexter gets out of his air conditioned Civic, is momentarily 
      stunned by the brutally hot morning sun.

      He heads toward A CROWD OF polyester-wearing RETIREES, hand-
        me-down-wearing CUBANO refugees and bikini-wearing TOURISTS, 
      standing behind the yellow police tape cordoning off this 
      dingy low-life, hell-hole of a motel advertising hourly 
      rates. But right now, the rooms are empty and the parking lot 
      is full with COP CARS, AMBULANCES, and MEDICAL EXAMINER VANS. 

                                  DEXTER (V.O.)
                    There s something strange and 
                    disarming about looking at a homicide 
                    scene in the bright daylight of the 
                    Miami sun. It makes the most grotesque 
                    killings look antiseptic, staged -- 
                    like you re in a new and daring 
                    section of Disney World. Dahmer-Land. 

      Dexter scoots under the yellow tape when SUDDENLY a very 
          intimidating-looking UNIFORMED COP blocks his path.

                                  COP
                    You better be a cop.

      Dexter flashes his OFFICIAL MIAMI-DADE FORENSIC DEPT. I.D.

                                  DEXTER
                    No. Forensics.

      The Cop eyes the badge then waves him in. Dexter walks past 
      him, then SEES amongst all the other COPS hanging around --                                                                                    13.



      Debra still looking like a cheap whore, running up to him.

                                  DEXTER (CONT D)
                    Jeeze Deb, where the hell do you keep 
                    your gun?

                                  DEBRA
                          (catching her breath)
                    Cut the crap -- They found another 
                    hooker. At least, they think it s a 
                    hooker. 

                                  DEXTER
                    Why?

                                  DEBRA
                    Hard to tell from what s left. That s 
                    the third in the last five months. 

                                  DEXTER
                    Third?
                          (intrigued)
                    You mean there s...

                                  DEBRA
                    Hell yeah we got a serial killer, Bro -
                    - the other two were up in Broward 
                    County -- chopped up in bits and 
                    pieces too, and they say there s no 
                      connection. Any drooling moron could 
                    see these kills are connected. But 
                    that bitch... 

                                  DEXTER
                    What bitch?

                                  DEBRA
                    That bitch. That thin-hipped dope, 
                      Lieutenant Laguerta -- Look at her. 

      And Dexter turns and SEES --

      LT. MARIA LAGUERTA (30 s), the definitively thin-hipped, but 
      intensely sexy, Cuban born head of Miami-Dade homicide, 
      talking rapid fire to a clearly nervous Cuban PORTER. 

                                  DEBRA (CONT D)
                    She s the lead on the case. How the 
                    hell does that happen?                                                                                    14.



                                  DEXTER
                    She s a born politician -- kiss enough 
                    ass and you get the post. Maybe you 
                    should try it sometimes. 

                                  DEBRA
                    Blow me. She s convinced there s a 
                    witness and I want in on this case -- 
                    it s my beat but instead of using me, 
                    she s got some detectives I never met 
                      interviewing my whores who -- trust me 
                    -- are not going to talk to those 
                    dudes. What an idiot. Idiot. Idiot. 

      LaGuerta catches Dexter s eye and in the midst of her rapid 
      paced conversation with the Cuban Porter, smiles at Dexter, 
      then her eyes quickly scan the crowd, the crime scene. 

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) 
                    Uh oh...there s that frown and those 
                    darting eyes. Perhaps she s hoping a 
                    clue will leap out of nowhere and she 
                    can shoot it.

                                  DEBRA
                      Dex...DEX...Jesus, where the hell did 
                    you go?

      Dexter turns, smiles at Deb.

                                  DEXTER 
                    What are you going to do?

                                  DEBRA
                    I m going to get the hell out of this 
                    sex suit and get into the homicide 
                    division, that s what I want to do. 
                    But that ass kissing puta is gonna 
                    stick her bony ass in the way. Shit, 
                    why does she have to hate my goddamn 
                    guts?

                                  DEXTER
                    Cause you hate hers.

                                  DEBRA
                    Look, I don t need you to reiterate 
                    the fucken obvious. Okay? Now are you 
                    going to help me?

                                  DEXTER
                    I ll do anything for you, but...                                                                                    15.



                                  DEBRA
                          (cuts him off)
                    Don t be fucken dense on me now. You 
                    know what I need, Dex -- you have 
                    these things, these hunches -- you 
                    know with these types of murders. 

                                  DEXTER
                    Just sometimes, Deb...
                          (off her look)
                    All right, let me take a look and in 
                    the meantime, avoid LaGuerta and talk 
                    to Captain Mathews and ask him to put 
                    you on the case. But keep the sex suit 
                    on -- it ll help your cause.

                                  DEBRA
                          (shakes her head)
                    Why do I love you?

      And with that, she takes off. Dexter smiles. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Dexter walks down the alley and SEES -- 

      VINCE MASUKA (30 s), slight, half Japanese, half white, 
      sporting a slicked-back  Don Ho  haircut, meticulously 
      brushing for fingerprints around the exterior of a large 
      green dumpster while...

      ANGEL BATISTA (30 s), the corpulent, chain-smoking Miami-Dade 
      Medical Examiner, leans into the dumpster and very carefully 
      plucks out body parts which are all individually wrapped up 
      in white butcher s paper and neatly tied with twine. 

      Batista s last grab is clearly a foot and...Angel sets it 
      down amongst a lot of other body parts (legs, hands, 
      individual fingers...) on a blue plastic tarp, and like a 
      puzzle we re beginning to see the complete human figure laid 
      out. It s gruesome, but still, there s something...something 
      almost intriguingly artistic about it. 

      Masuka looks up, wipes the sweat off his brow, sees Dex and 
      smiles with a big fake smile. 

      FREEZE ON MASUKA S FACE

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) 
                      Something s wrong with this guy, 
                    Masuka. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    16.

                                  DEXTER (V.O.)  (CONT'D)
                    It s like he learned how to smile from 
                    those models in a Sears catalogue. 

      BACK TO SCENE

                                  DEXTER (CONT D)
                    Nice haircut, Masuka. 

                                  MASUKA
                          (too excited)
                    Saw your sister. Damn...looking hot.

                                  DEXTER
                    She should. It s hot as hell out here. 

                                  MASUKA
                          (shrugs)
                    So what brings you here?

                                  DEXTER
                    Came to see how the real experts 
                    operate. 

      Masuka flashes that fake smile again, then starts laughing -- 
      his whole body convulsing in great heaves and gasps, almost 
      sounds like he s drowning.

      Dexter stares at him in amazement, then --  

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    And that laugh. Do I perform CPR or 
                    the Heimlich? 

      Masuka finally stops laughing. 

                                  MASUKA
                      Seriously, why are you here?

                                  DEXTER
                          (rhetorically)
                    It s a crime scene.

                                  MASUKA
                    Yeah, but you do blood spatter.

                                  DEXTER
                    So?

                                  MASUKA
                    So, there s no blood here.

      Dexter stares at him, then suddenly feels light-headed, takes 
      a step back, something has happened. His world is clearly 
      rocked. Finally, he recoups, focuses back on Masuka.                                                                                     17.



                                  DEXTER
                    What was that? 

                                  MASUKA
                      Yeah...There s no blood in or on or 
                    near the body at all. It s the 
                    weirdest thing you ever saw.

      PUSHING INTO DEXTER S HORROR STRICKEN FACE

                                  DEXTER (V.O.)
                    No blood. No sticky, hot, messy, awful 
                    blood. NO BLOOD AT ALL.
                          (beat)
                    Why hadn t I thought of that? No 
                    blood. 
                          (and then his face relaxes)
                    What a gorgeous idea. 

      Dexter quickly spins around to Angel, then whips out a pair 
      of surgical gloves, snaps them on, leans down next to Angel 
      who s slowly unwrapping a hand with his scalpel. 

                                  DEXTER (CONT D)
                    How does he do it? How does the killer 
                    get rid of the blood?

                                  ANGEL
                    Hard to say. The body s in good shape 
                    and she was muy bonita. Had a big ass 
                    too. Her head s over there, take a 
                    look. 

      Dexter ignores that, leans in, inspects the exposed hand. 

                                  DEXTER 
                    This is unique. 

                                  MASUKA
                          (laughs)
                    No shit and no prints either. 

      Angel picks away until he finally reveals the tip of an ankle 
      with a small tattoo of a butterfly still on the skin. 

                                  DEXTER (V.O.)
                    This guy s good. Good as I could do. 
                    I ve never seen such clean, dry, neat 
                    looking dead flesh. Wonderful.

      Dexter looks at Angel.                                                                                    18.



                                  DEXTER (CONT D)
                    Very clean.

                                  ANGEL
                    Yeah, but he didn t finish - no 
                      terminado. 

                                  DEXTER
                    Looks pretty completo to me, Angel.

                                  ANGEL
                    No, look -- he cut the leg in four 
                    pieces, almost like using a ruler, but 
                    this leg is only in two pieces, and 
                    here.  Looks like he started to make a 
                    third cut but stopped. Possible, he 
                    got interrupted. 

                                  MASUKA
                          (laughing)
                    That s why LaGuerta is looking for a 
                    witness. Working on that motel Porter 
                    back there. God help him. 

      Dexter looks at them both.  

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) 
                    No blood. I can t think. 
                          (beat)
                    I have to get out of here. 

      Dexter rises -- takes one last look at all the marvelous 
      bloodless body parts laid out on the tarp, then without 
      saying anything, turns, walks away from Masuka and Angel.

                                  ANGEL
                    Dex, donde vas? Where you going?

      But Dexter keeps walking and heads out of the alley and 
      disappears behind a group of COPS standing by the squad cars. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Dexter keeps walking, passes LaGuerta who winks at him.

                                  DEXTER (V.O.)
                    I wish she d stop that. It s one of 
                    those mating rituals which I really 
                    don t understand.                                                                                     19.



      He suddenly finds himself crowded in by a group of REPORTERS, 
      pushing their microphones and cameras into the face of --

      CAPTAIN MATHEWS (50 s), slick and manicured, three hundred 
      dollar shoes, five hundred dollar suit, and a million dollar 
      ego.

                                  CAPT. MATHEWS
                    I have the utmost faith in this 
                      department and with Lt. LaGuerta 
                      leading... 

                                  REPORTER
                          (interrupting)
                    Captain Mathews...Captain -- we 
                      understand there were similar killings 
                    in Broward...are we talking about a 
                    serial killer?

                                  CAPT. MATHEWS
                    There s no evidence to suggest...

                                  REPORTER
                    Then it s the work of a lone 
                      psychopath?

                                  CAPT. MATHEWS
                    Listen, we live in Miami so I guess, 
                    the chances are good. 

      And as Dexter looks back at the crime scene, we hear --

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) 
                    That bloodless body -- This guy may 
                    have exceeded my own abilities. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Dexter pulls into the white picket-fenced parking lot, filled 
      with top of the line BMW s, Mercedes, finds a spot -- Dexter 
      has a clear, unobstructed view of the main entrance of the 
      Club and SEES --

      A steady stream of beautiful, tight bodied, bronzed skinned 
      MIDDLE AGED LADIES in their cute little tennis outfits 
      walking in and out of the club. 

      Dexter turns his head, then SEES --                                                                                     20.



      JAMIE JAWORSKI (30 s), a short, stocky, pleasant enough 
      looking man, whose large brown eyes might be a little too 
      close together, wearing a traditional janitorial outfit. A 
      small broom and shovel in his tattooed hand. 

      FREEZE ON JAWORSKI

                                  DEXTER (V.O.)
                    This guy likes hanging around the 
                    wives of the rich and famous. Works 
                    the country club circuit, cleaning 
                    lockers, painting picket fences.

      BACK TO SCENE

      Jaworski sweeps up a little dirt, some leaves, while eyeing 
      all the pretty ladies. 

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Six months ago, I think he fell in 
                    love with a pretty brunette, Mrs. Jane 
                    Saunders. 

      Dexter opens a Miami P.D. missing person s file, pulls out a 
      picture of Jane Saunders -- and she is a very beautiful 
      brunette. 

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    A sweet mother of two, married to 
                    Harry Saunders a successful banker. 
                    They all lived a pleasant life in an 
                    overgrown modern house, until she 
                      unfortunately disappeared.

                                                                          FLASH TO:


      The distraught, handcuffed HUSBAND is led out by COPS. His 
      two KIDS (10-12), surrounded by SOCIAL WORKERS, sob. Off to 
      the side we SEE --

      A younger looking LaGuerta proudly talking to the press. 

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) 
                    The cops arrested the husband for 
                    murder. They never convicted him, but 
                    all wasn t lost, because they still 
                    managed to destroy his life and leave 
                    his kids emotionally deficient 
                    forever. But I knew he was no killer. 

      BACK TO SCENE                                                                                    21.



      One of the LADIES drops her tennis bag, bends over and 
      Jaworski freezes, stares at that pantalooned bottom. 

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    My favorite janitor was a suspect for 
                    a while but the cops could never make 
                    anything stick. 

      After a beat, Jaworski, skulks away and disappears into a 
      shed off to the side. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Where he s immediately confronted by --

      SGT. DOAKES (30 s), a large, imposing BLACK MAN, whose cold 
      frosty eyes are framed by a face fixed with a permanent look 
      of hostility -- especially when he s around Dexter.

                                  SGT. DOAKES
                          (hard, impatient)
                    Where the hell you been?

                                  DEXTER
                    Crime scene?

      Doakes stares at him then looks around the office, eyes --

      The poster of Miami s,  Matador s Hockey Team,  taped to one 
      of the glass walls, but the other walls are plastered with 
      images of blood stained walls, floors, and carpets -- looks 
      almost like a  Jackson Pollack exhibit.                                                                                      25.



                                  SGT. DOAKES 
                    What about these? 

      Doakes shoves two oversized color photos of A COUPLE OF 
      BODIES, lying dead on the carpeted floor of a large hotel 
      room into Dexter s hands. 

                                  SGT. DOAKES (CONT D)
                          (hard)
                    The hotel coke-head murders? This 
                    dealer and the girl? 

      Dexter scans them -- eyes the blood spatter on the walls. 

                                  DEXTER
                    This hallmark-looking couple didn t 
                    die by the hands of a professional 
                    killer. Nope. This is child s play. 
                    Messy work -- all that blood on the 
                    walls -- looks like finger painting.

                                  SGT. DOAKES
                    You give me the fucking creeps, you 
                    know that Dexter?

                                  DEXTER 
                    Yeah, I know. Sorry about that.

                                  SGT. DOAKES
                          (takes a step in)
                    Fuck you.

                                  DEXTER
                    Okay...
                          (beat)
                    Is there something I can...

                                  SGT. DOAKES
                    Yeah. You can give me your fucking 
                    analysis on the blood spatter on these 
                    killings. You think I m here to invite 
                    you to my nephew s bris? 

                                  DEXTER
                    I didn t know you were Jewish.

                                  SGT. DOAKES
                    Shut the fuck up and just write your 
                    report already. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    26.

                                  SGT. DOAKES (CONT'D)
                    Don t even know why I need you -- so 
                    just grab a crayon, psycho and 
                    scribble this down: Rival dealer came 
                    in -- two scum-bags slashed to hell -- 
                    dealer stole the drugs. Wham, bam done 
                    and I don t give a shit what you say, 
                    cause that s what happened and that s 
                    who I m looking for -- We re looking 
                    for a motherfucking thief dealer. Got 
                    it? 

                                  DEXTER
                          (uncertain)
                      Okay...sure...I guess, but I need to 
                    get back...

                                  SGT. DOAKES 
                    Then get back there already, you 
                    fucking weirdo, I need it quick.

                                  DEXTER
                    I m on it, Sergeant. 

      And Doakes storms out of the office.

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    The only real question I have is why, 
                    in a building full of cops... 

                                                                          FLASH TO:

      A montage of different DETECTIVES interrogating a series of 
      tough, defiant PERPS.

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    ...all supposedly with a keen insight 
                    into the human soul, is Doakes the 
                    only one that gets the creeps from me? 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Dexter drives down a squalid residential street, surrounded 
      by low income housing, barbecue joints and crumbling Catholic 
      Churches. Gang-looking KIDS hang out in front of bodegas, 
      drinking, smoking -- their boom boxes blasting.                                                                                     29.



      Eating a juicy Cuban pork sandwich, Dexter pulls into a 
      parking spot, then puts the sandwich down. 

                                  DEXTER (V.O.)
                    The problem with eating and driving, 
                    which I love to do, is not being able 
                    to employ the ten-two hand position on 
                    the wheel. It s a matter of public 
                    safety. 

      He picks up the new  JAWORSKI  file Camillia gave him. 

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    But there s always a sacrifice. 

      Dexter scans a few pages of the Jaworski file. 

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) (CONT D) 
                    Looks like Jaworski s been busy...

      He turns his head, looks across the street and focuses on a 
      small shitty looking house with a rusty chain link fence 
      blocking the side alley running along the house. 

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) (CONT D)
                      ...recently picked up for a peeping 
                    tom episode and flashed a poor soccer 
                    mom. 
                          (beat)
                    Time to take a little tour.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Harry still has his arm draped over little Dexter s shoulders 
      -- looks down at his son.

                                  YOUNG DEXTER
                    Well...I kinda, you know feel 
                      something, like inside, watching me...

                                  HARRY
                    Do you hear voices?

                                  YOUNG DEXTER
                    No...it s not really a voice -- it s 
                        something...something different. 

      And little Dexter looks away.

                                  HARRY
                    And this something, it makes you -- 
                    kill things?

      After a beat, Dexter looks back at his father.                                                                                    31.



                                  YOUNG DEXTER
                    No, well...it doesn t really make me. 
                    It just makes it seem like a really 
                    good idea.

                                  HARRY
                    Have you ever wanted to kill something 
                    else? You know, something bigger than 
                    a dog?

                                  YOUNG DEXTER
                          (softly)
                    Yes.

                                  HARRY
                    Like a person?

                                  YOUNG DEXTER
                    Yeah, but nobody in particular...

                                  HARRY
                    Why didn t you?

      Dexter and Harry lock eyes for a beat, then --

                                  YOUNG DEXTER
                    I thought you wouldn t like it. You 
                    and mom. 

                                  HARRY
                    That s why you didn t?

                                  YOUNG DEXTER
                          (fumbling)
                    I, uh...I didn t want you mad at me -- 
                    you know, angry or disappointed. 
                          (beat)
                    Are you, Pop?

      And as Harry locks eyes with little Dexter, we --

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Dexter, looking showered and fresh and wearing another 
      snappy, new bowling shirt, carries a paper bag filled with 
      goodies, walks through the extraordinary parade of gorgeous 
      MEN and WOMEN. Rumba music BLASTING through restaurant 
      speakers follows him as he goes.                                                                                    32.



                                  DEXTER (V.O.)
                    Friday night. Date night in Miami. 
                    Every night is date night in Miami, 
                    and everyone s having sex, but breathe 
                    easy, Dex -- It s okay because for me, 
                    sex never enters into it. 

      Dexter walks past a good looking COUPLE sitting at a table at 
      an outdoor cafe, stops -- does a double take...

      And sure enough the GUY is sipping a Mojito, while the pretty 
      young GIRL, smoking a cigarette with one hand, slowly and 
      casually massages the guy s crotch with the other. 

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    I don t understand sex. It s not in my 
                    nature. I don t have anything against 
                    women, and I certainly have an 
                      appropriate sensibility about men, but 
                    when it comes to the actual act of 
                    sex, it just seems so undignified.

      More sexy, young hip WOMEN wearing micro short, tight dresses 
      saunter up and down the boulevard.

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    But I have to play the game and after 
                    years of trying to look normal, I have 
                      finally...

      Dexter turns off the boulevard and heads down --

      A RESIDENTIAL STREET

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) 
                      ...finally met the perfect date...


      He RINGS the bell. Ding-dong.

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) 
                    ...and that s because she is...in her 
                    own way...as damaged as me. Been 
                    seeing her for about a year now -- 
                    just after her ex-husband...

      And just then the door SWINGS open, Dexter smiles wide.


      Fidgeting, Dexter stands next to Rita, while waiting on a 
      very, very long line, full of the BEAUTIFUL and the HIP, 
      slowly snaking its way into the famous crab shack. 

                                  DEXTER (V.O.)
                    Needless to say, I have some unusual 
                    habits, yet all these socially 
                      acceptable people can t wait to pick 
                    up hammers and publicly smash their 
                    food to bits.  

                                                                          FLASH TO:

      A montage of hammer wielding DINERS maniacally smashing 
      defenseless crustaceans into bits and pieces. And as the 
      shells fly around the room like shrapnel from an exploding 
      car bomb, the diners greedily pick at the meat. 

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Normal people are so hostile. 

      BACK TO SCENE

      And Dexter smiles at Rita.

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    38.




      Dexter and Rita walk through the park packed with D.J. s, and 
      CONGA AND BONGO PLAYERS blasting Cubano, Caribbean and hip-
      hop crap. Blinding strobe and laser lights illuminate the 
      HUNDREDS of skimpily dressed WOMEN and MEN dancing and 
      drinking tequila under the intense midnight heat -- It s a 
        bacchanalian human flesh feast -- but curiously none of these 
      people seem to be aware of --

      THE CRIME SCENE

      Just yards away, at the edge of the park -- cordoned of with 
      yellow tape and crowded with a dozen POLICE CARS, AMBULANCES, 
      their red and blue lights twirling. Dexter s suddenly very 
      interested -- grabs Rita s hand tight, STOPS walking. 

                                  DEXTER
                    They might need me.

                                  RITA
                    Don t you have a pager?

                                  DEXTER
                    They don t always know they need me. 

      And with that, he fights his way through the sweltering 
      crowd, heads toward the crime scene and Rita calls out --

                                  RITA
                    DEX...

                                                                      CUT BACK TO:

      DEXTER

      Rushing past COPS, then SEES --

      Lt. LaGuerta talking to a few eager REPORTERS but Dexter 
      avoids eye contact, quickly maneuvers around some DETECTIVES 
      and COPS, then SEES --

      Angel Batista (the M.E.) in the same position we saw him at 
      the last crime scene -- bent over, examining wrapped body 
      parts (legs, toes, arms) which are once again all neatly laid 
      out on a blue vinyl tarp. Angel looks up -- he s grim, tense. 

                                  ANGEL
                    Son of a whore.

                                  DEXTER
                    Who?                                                                                    39.



                                  ANGEL 
                    I m talking about this hijo de puta -- 
                    this ass-hole killer, this maricon  
                    savage who makes us work on a Friday 
                    night.

                                  DEXTER
                    Only on Mondays through Thursday. 
                    That s what I always say. 

                                  ANGEL
                    Of course -- be reasonable. Who wants 
                    to work on a Friday night? So como ta? 
                    What are you doing here?

                                  DEXTER 
                    Was in the neighborhood...
                          (then eyes him)
                    Why? Same guy, same pattern?

                                  ANGEL
                    Bone dry. No blood again.

      And Dexter suddenly feels light headed again, paces, re-
      coups, then leans down next to Angel -- focuses. 

                                  ANGEL (CONT D)
                    Mira aqui -- there s a small 
                      difference in the cuts this time. 
                          (points to an exposed hand)
                    Very rough here. Almost emotional. 
                    Then here -- not so much, here and 
                    here and in-between.

                                  DEXTER
                    Muy bien.

                                  ANGEL
                    Yeah, nice, but look at this. 

      Angel nudges the severed hand aside, taps an exposed femur.

                                  ANGEL (CONT D)
                    Look -- all bone. The killer, flayed 
                    the skin completely off. Why would he 
                    do that? 

      Dexter takes a breath, looks at Angel. 

                                  DEXTER
                    He s experimenting. Trying to find the 
                    right way.                                                                                     40.



                                  ANGEL
                    Is he experimenting with the head too?

                                  DEXTER
                    What do you mean?

                                  ANGEL
                    I mean, la bestia took her fucking 
                    head. There isn t one around here and 
                    God knows what he s doing with it. 

      Dexter stares at Angel, gets up and slowly walks away deep in 
      thought.

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) 
                    He s certainly raising the bar. Damn, 
                    this guy is good. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      SAME

      The Civic stops. Dexter and Rita sit in silence, then --

                                  RITA
                    Will they catch him soon?

                                  DEXTER
                    Doubt it. The killer is an artist...

                                  RITA
                          (confused)
                    What do you mean?

      But now Dexter s in his own world and he says very softly...

                                  DEXTER
                    His technique...it s incredible. 

                                  RITA
                    What..? Dex, I can hardly hear what 
                    you re...

      But before she finishes, Dexter SUDDENLY leans over and 
      KISSES HER, long and hard on the mouth.

      She pushes him away -- a look of horror crosses her face. She 
      pats her dress down, frantically runs her hands through her 
      hair.                                                                                    41.



                                  RITA (CONT D)
                    I m sorry...I don t think I want to -- 
                    I mean, I m not ready for -- Damn it, 
                    Dexter. WHY!?

      She unbuckles her seat belt, jerks the door handle up, jumps 
      out of the car, SLAMS the door shut -- runs into her house. 

      BACK ON DEXTER

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) 
                    What have I done now? I m not even 
                      interested. And why can t I get that 
                    neat stack of body parts out of my 
                    head. 
                          (beat)
                    No blood. 
                          (beat)
                    Why did I kiss her?

      And as we push in tight to Dexter s face, we --

                                                                            CUT TO:


      And Dexter looks grim and angry -- sits at his desk, faces 
      his computer -- the large  Jaworski File  just inches from 
      his fingers and right next to that, is the same porn magazine 
      we saw in Jaworski s apartment. 

      Dexter pounds away on the keyboard and as the images on the 
      computer screen reflect off his face, his shoulders tighten, 
      and his eyes turn cold and black.

                                  DEXTER (V.O.)
                    That s it. He s definitely the one. 
                          (beat)
                     Scream and Cream.  The mother of all 
                    rape sites.

      PLAYING ON THE SCREEN

      Is a grainy video of the attractive, but the struggling, 
      desperate Jane Saunders is tied down to a stained mattress 
      lying on a filthy basement floor -- and humping away on top 
      of her is -- a short, stocky, masked man with the same 
      tattooed hands we saw on Jaworski.                                                                                    42.



      It s unseemly and nauseating, then it becomes pure evil as we 
      watch Jaworski climax, reach under the mattress, pull out a 
      knife, and as he raises it high in the air, we --

                                                                      CUT BACK TO:

      THE FURIOUS DEXTER

      Staring at the computer -- hatred all over his face.

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    ...Now it s just a matter of time 
                    before he becomes a drop of blood in 
                    my glass slide collection. 
                          (beat)
                    But I have to wait, because what I do 
                    requires infinite planning and I have 
                    to be careful and follow the code of 
                    Harry. 

      And as Dexter pushes back from his desk, we hear -- 

                                  YOUNG DEXTER (O.S.)
                    Is that why we took this trip, Pop? 

                                                                      FLASHBACK TO:


      The sun is going down and little Dexter is helping his father 
      build a campfire -- throws a couple of twigs into the pile. 

                                  YOUNG DEXTER
                    To talk about this?

      Harry gets on his knees, blows into the embers, the fire 
      ignites, then he stands, faces Dexter.

                                  HARRY 
                    I m getting old, son, and I think when 
                    you get older, people understand 
                    things differently. 
                          (sits next to Dexter)
                    See -- It s not a question of getting 
                    soft or seeing things in shades of 
                    grey instead of black and white. I 
                    really believe it s just a matter of 
                      understanding things differently -- 
                      Understanding things in a better way.

                                  YOUNG DEXTER
                    I think I understand.                                                                                     43.



      Beat.

                                  HARRY
                    Ten years ago, I would have had you 
                    committed -- but now I know better. 
                          (gently)
                    You re a good kid, Dexter.  

                                  YOUNG DEXTER
                          (sincere, distraught)
                    No Pop, I m bad. I m...

                                  HARRY
                          (cuts him off)
                      No...You re good...You are, Dex...I 
                    know it and you know it and I know it 
                      because...because otherwise you 
                    wouldn t care what me or your mom 
                    thought -- you d just do it. But we re 
                    not going to be here forever so we 
                    have to get you sorted out. 

      He stares into Dexter s eyes.

                                  YOUNG DEXTER
                    Pop, I m sorry.

                                  HARRY
                          (beat, then very gently)
                    Come here, son.

      Harry leans over, flicks the hair away from Dexter s face. 

                                  HARRY (CONT D)
                    What do you remember from before? You 
                    know, before we took you in?

      Beat. 

                                  YOUNG DEXTER
                    Nothing.

                                  HARRY
                    Good -- nobody should remember that, 
                    because what happened to you as a 
                    little boy shaped you. 

                                  YOUNG DEXTER
                    Will I ever remember?

                                  HARRY
                    I hope not. 
                          (beat)
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    44.

                                  HARRY (CONT'D)
                    What happened was too strong, it was 
                    too much. It got into you too early, 
                    son and it s going to stay there -- 
                    and listen to me carefully now -- it s 
                    going to make you want to kill and you 
                    won t be able to stop it. 

                                  YOUNG DEXTER
                          (sad)
                    So, I m going be like this forever? 

                                  HARRY
                    Yes, and nothing can change that -- 
                    but you can channel it. Control it. We 
                    can use it for good. 
                          (beat)
                    I going to teach you how to choose 
                    what and who you kill. Teach you how 
                    not to get caught. 
                          (beat)
                    This will be our secret. Just between 
                    you and me? No one else can ever know. 

                                  YOUNG DEXTER 
                    Are you sure?

                                  HARRY
                    I m absolutely sure and Dexter -- I 
                    want you to, because there are plenty 
                    of people who deserve it. 

                                  YOUNG DEXTER
                    So you re not mad at me?

                                  HARRY
                    No, son. I love you. 

      As Harry smiles at little Dexter, we HEAR --

                                  DEBRA (O.S.)
                    Don t bullshit me, Dex. Give me 
                    something before they shut me out. 

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:


      Dexter pours over blue prints that are clearly labeled 
      Baywater Condos.

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) 
                      Preparation is vital. No detail can be 
                      overlooked.

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:


      Dex walks into the crowded main lobby, then freezes at the 
      sight of --

      THE CHOIR MASTER S WIFE 

      Standing in front of the DESK SERGEANT, crying.

                                  WIFE
                    I don t understand...Do something, 
                    please. Put out an Amber alert, put 
                    his face on milk cartons -- JUST FIND 
                    MY HUSBAND!

                                  DESK SERGEANT
                          (patiently)
                    Ma am, I understand and we re trying -- 
                    the detectives are looking into 
                      everything and when we know... 

      As we pan off the Sergeant and his voice trails off, we 
      settle --

      ON DEXTER

      Eyeing the Wife. 

                                  DEXTER (V.O.)
                    I m pretty certain I made no mistakes. 

      Dexter turns, heads toward the briefing room, then feels a 
      hard poke into his shoulder and stops. He spins around and 
      stares into the face of --

                                  SGT. DOAKES
                    I saw you staring at that woman. What 
                    do you care about her? 

                                  DEXTER
                      I don t...I was just...

                                  SGT. DOAKES
                          (cuts him off)
                    You like when women cry? You like 
                    that? What s your thing, psycho?                                                                                     50.



                                  DEXTER 
                    Just heading to the briefing room.

                                  SGT. DOAKES
                          (hard)
                    You got no call to be in there, so 
                    flee. 

      But Dexter turns, keeps walking --

                                  SGT. DOAKES (CONT D)
                    Hey! I m...

      With Doakes right behind him, Dexter grabs the briefing room 
      door, pulls it open, and we SEE --

      Lt. LaGuerta standing right inside.

                                  SGT. DOAKES (CONT D)
                          (to LaGuerta)
                    This fucking guy doesn t belong. I m 
                    still waiting for his spatter report 
                    on the coke head murders. 
                          (back to Dexter)
                    Go do that. 

      LaGuerta shoots them both a look. Dexter retreats.

                                  DEXTER
                    It s okay. I don t want to make anyone 
                    unhappy.

      Dexter turns, but LaGuerta reaches out, grabs his hand.

                                  LAGUERTA
                    He can stay. 
                          (to Dexter)
                    I d love your input and we ll discuss 
                    your case after the meeting -- so how 
                    about we get started?

      And LaGuerta pulls him into --


      Dexter drives through the pouring rain, then turns onto a 
        construction site bordering the bay -- passes a damaged sign 
      that reads  Baywater Condominiums.  

      The land has been cleared of all trees and a series of half 
      built two-story condo s sit abandoned in their place. 

                                  DEXTER (V.O.)
                    Another huge development that was 
                    going to improve all of our lives by 
                    turning trees and animals into cement 
                    and old people from New Jersey. But 
                    this place ran out of money -- 
                    stalled, inert, lifeless. 

      Dexter stops his car behind a large pile of old brick and 
      timber. After a beat, he slips silently out of his car, walks 
      slowly toward a half-built condo.                                                                                    56.



                                  DEXTER (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    Jaworski s been coming here for 
                      weeks...likes to steal all the copper 
                    wire. Good money in that. 
                          (beat)
                    No security guards. That s good.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      SECOND STORY WINDOW P.O.V. 

      And through the sheets of rain we SEE --

      Jaworski pull up in his pickup, get out, a large wrench in 
      his hand. He steps through the puddles and heads into the 
      building.


      Dexter drives in the pouring rain down Biscayne Blvd --

                                  DEXTER (V.O.)
                    I feel a lot better now. Always do 
                      afterwards. One less amateur film 
                    maker polluting the internet. 

      Then out of the corner of his eye, he SEES --

      A REFRIGERATED TRUCK

      Barreling down a side street. Dexter s shocked -- whips his 
      head around. 

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    No...Can t be.

      But Dex makes a quick U-turn, almost fishtails, twisting and 
      turning then heads down that side street where we SEE --

      THE TRUCK

      Speeding down one block after another.

      DEXTER

      Nails the gas, but his Civic struggles to keep up. 

      THE TRUCK

      Now a few blocks away, makes a sharp right.

      DEXTER                                                                                    60.



      Follows, but the light up ahead turns red and as Dexter comes 
      to a stop, he watches --

      THE TRUCK

      Turn onto the causeway and disappear.

      DEXTER

      Waits impatiently for the light to turn. Red...red...red... 
      still red, then finally it turns green and Dexter floors it.  

      THE CIVIC

      Screeches forward, turns onto the causeway, races down the 
      highway, then SEES --

      THE TRUCK

      RACING BACK TOWARD DEXTER -- and it s getting closer, closer. 

      DEXTER 

      Turns white, then grips the wheel tighter and as he gets 
      closer to the oncoming truck, he sees --

      THE DRIVER S ARM 

      Pop out of the driver s side window and the Driver s hand is 
      holding something very large.

      THE TRUCK AND THE CAR

      Are getting closer...closer and right before they collide --

      THE TRUCK

      Swerves and the Driver throws --

      A SEVERED HEAD 

      Right into Dexter s windshield. The glass SHATTERS and...

      DEXTER S HORRIFIED

      SLAMS on the brakes and --

      THE HEAD

      Rolls off the hood, BOUNCES onto the wet causeway and starts 
      rolling and skipping, heading straight toward the edge of the 
      road and coming dangerously close to falling into the water 
      below.                                                                                      61.



      DEXTER

      Jumps out of the car, RACES after the rolling head, catches 
      up to it, bends down and GRABS IT --

      But the rain soaked, bloodless-head SLIPS through his fingers 
      and scoots away from him. Then with a burst of energy, Dexter 
      lunges -- TACKLES that head like a football and pulls it in 
      close and tight with his hands.

      He takes a couple of deep breaths, rises to his feet and...

      Standing alone in the middle of the empty road, and with the 
      rain still pouring down on him, Dexter lifts the head up, 
      looks into her eyes.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      The rain has stopped and Dexter sits on the hood of his car, 
      watching the PARAMEDICS gently roll the head off the 
      causeway, onto a stretcher, then lift the stretcher and carry 
      it into an ambulance. Dexter waves --

                                  DEXTER
                    Bye, bye.

      Dex looks across the street at --

      Sgt. Doakes and Debra leaning against an unmarked police car 
      and Debra smiles wide, gives him a thumbs up and just then --

      LaGuerta s car pulls up, headlights momentarily blinding 
      Dexter.

      He shields his eyes, then after a beat, he sees LaGuerta get 
      out of her car, and lock eyes with -- 

      Deb who smirks at her, then turns, nods to Doakes. They both 
      get into the unmarked car and take off. 

      LaGuerta shakes her head, SLAMS her door shut and walks 
      towards Dexter.

                                  LAGUERTA 
                    You okay?

      Lt. LaGuerta approaches. Dexter eyes her then says wryly.

                                  DEXTER 
                    What a way to get a head.                                                                                    62.



                                  LAGUERTA
                          (smiles)
                    Cute...

      LaGuerta looks around, then takes a step towards him. 

                                  LAGUERTA (CONT D)
                    So did you see the driver of the 
                    truck?

                                  DEXTER
                    Nope.

                                  LAGUERTA
                    You sure it was a refrigerated truck?
                          (off his nod)
                    But you didn t see the driver?

                                  DEXTER
                    Nope.

                                  LAGUERTA
                    And you re sure it was a refrigerated 
                    truck?

                                  DEXTER
                    No question. 

                                  LAGUERTA 
                    You seem pretty certain. 

      She steps in even closer.

                                  DEXTER
                    Certain is my middle name.

                                  LAGUERTA
                          (seductively)
                    I like a confident man.

      And she presses her tempting, elegant body against his body. 

                                  LAGUERTA (CONT D)
                    Nice job on the coke head murders. 
                    Doakes picked up the killer. It was 
                    her boyfriend. But Doakes still hates 
                    you. 

      Her hand drops down, starts massaging his thigh.

                                  LAGUERTA (CONT D)
                    How d you get so smart, Dexter?                                                                                     63.



      She runs her hands over his chest, then through his hair.

                                  LAGUERTA (CONT D)
                    And you always wear such nice clothes.

                                  DEXTER
                    Lt, I don t think...

      She presses harder against him, whispers seductively --

                                  LAGUERTA
                    Shhhh...

                                  DEXTER
                    No, Lt...not here.

                                  LAGUERTA
                    That s right, not here. My place.

      And as she leans in for the kiss, Dexter quickly turns his 
      face away, scoots to the side and...LaGuerta falls forward, 
      hitting the car hard. 

                                  DEXTER
                          (horrified)
                    Lt...I m so, so sorry.

      LaGuerta rights herself, whips around -- venom in her eyes.

                                  LAGUERTA 
                    You son-of-a-bitch.

                                  DEXTER
                      No...Lt...Please, listen...I just had 
                    a head thrown at me and I m feeling a 
                    little out of sorts and I m afraid I 
                    might disappoint you.

      They lock eyes. Dexter smiles wide and bright and LaGuerta 
      finally buys it -- smiles back.

                                  LAGUERTA
                    Okay, some other time...When you re 
                    less traumatized. 

      They lock eyes, Dexter nods, then ducks into his car and 
      drives off. 

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    64.




      Dexter stands in front of Rita s door, presses the bell. 
      Ding, dong, ding, dong. The door swings open and Dexter SEES 
      Rita bundled up in her robe. 

      After a beat --

                                  RITA
                          (nervously)
                    I sent the kids next door.

                                  DEXTER
                          (unsure)
                    Okay.

      Beat.

                                  RITA
                    Would you like to come in?

                                  DEXTER
                    Okay.

      And he steps --


      Dexter steps inside, closes the door. 

                                  DEXTER (V.O.)
                    Wow. Sex. How did that happen? But she 
                    seemed pleased so I guess I didn t 
                      disappoint her. 

      He looks around the room, all seems fine and he heads into --

      THE DARK KITCHEN

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    But that s because I don t care, and 
                    chances are if you don t care about 
                      something, you ll be better at it.

      He flips on the light --

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) (CONT D)
                      Performance anxiety must be a bitch. 

      And then he SEES -- 

      A BARBIE DOLL S HEAD

      Scotched taped and hanging by its hair on the refrigerator 
      door and Dexter FREEZES -- stares at the head. He s clearly 
      tense, unnerved. 

      Dexter slowly approaches the refrigerator, touches the Barbie 
      head and as it swings gently back and forth, he slowly opens 
      the freezer door and inside he finds --

      THE BARBIE DOLL BODY PARTS 

      Neatly stacked and tied together with little pink ribbons -- 
      just like the bloodless bodies, sans the little pink ribbons. 

      After a beat, Dexter s body relaxes --                                                                                     66.



                                  DEXTER (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    I suppose I should be upset, even feel 
                    violated, but I m not. 

      And then he notices -- 

      A SMALL VANITY MIRROR

      Stuck in one of Barbie s hands. He pulls the tiny mirror out 
      of the doll s hand, stares into it. And we see little 
      fragmented images of Dexter s face off the mirror. 

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    No...In fact, I think this is a 
                    friendly message -- Kind of like, 
                     Hey, want to play? 

      Dex puts the mirror down, closes the freezer door, and as he 
      looks down at the little Barbie head swinging on the 
        refrigerator door again, we --

      FREEZE ON DEXTER S SMILING FACE

                                  DEXTER (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    And yes, I want to play...I really, 
                    really do.

      And on that, we --

                                                                            FADE TO:
