      Cubicles divide a sedate office.  We re on the FIRST FLOOR, *
      looking through a huge PLATE GLASS WINDOW onto a PARKING LOT *
      outside.  Two pasty OFFICE WORKERS, AINSLEY and FRED, sit in *
      FRONT of the window, BACKS to it, in the midst of a full-on *
        white-collar American moan-and-groan.*

                                  AINSLEY*
                    No coffee.  Yeah.  So I drive to *
                      Starbuck s.   Cause I can t *
                    function.  I get out of the car.  *
                    Phone flies off my lap onto the *
                    asphalt.  Screen cracks.*

                                  FRED*
                    Oh, man.*

                                  AINSLEY*
                    I m staring at the crack.  Pissed *
                    as shit.   Cause I just got the new *
                    5S.  And a new plan.*

                                  FRED*
                    Take it back, tell them it came *
                    that way.  They might replace it.  *
                    If you find the right Genius.*

      In the parking lot BEHIND Ainsley and Fred, a woman silently *
      SPRINTS in HIGH HEELS toward her CAR, chased by a hungry *
      ZOMBIE.  Thus begins a marvelously intricate, chaotic, *
      gruesome ACTION SCENE kicking off the zombie apocalypse.*

      WE HAVE A FRONT ROW SEAT TO THE MADNESS OUTSIDE, BUT AINSLEY *
      AND FRED HAVE THEIR BACKS TO IT, OBLIVIOUS AS THEY BITCH.*

                                  AINSLEY*
                    And of course what do I notice - *
                    this isn t even part of the story - *
                    one of my apps is missing.  The *
                    icon.  From the home screen.  *
                    Somehow I deleted it.*

                                  FRED*
                      Butt-deleted.*                                                                                      2.


      The woman outside squirms into her car and slams the door.  *
      The zombie dives through the glass of the DRIVER S WINDOW.  *
      Its legs dangle out the window.*

                                  AINSLEY*
                      Butt-deleted.  Yeah.  Only I can t *
                    remember which one s gone,  cause *
                    it s gone.  And I won t figure it *
                    out-*

                                  FRED*
                          (nods)*
                    - til you need to use it.  I hate *
                    that.*

      The woman PEELS OUT of her space.  A truck speeds past, a *
      BUSINESSMAN ZOMBIE hanging off its back bumper.  The truck *
      SMACKS the LEGS of the first ZOMBIE, RIPPING it IN HALF.*

      The truck goes over a SPEED BUMP.  The businessman zombie *
      lets go, FACE-PLANTS, SKIDS across asphalt, notices the *
      disembodied legs of the first zombie, and starts to EAT them.*

                                  AINSLEY*
                    Fucking.  Hate!  So it gets better.  *
                    I order at Starbuck s.  And they *
                    ask my name.  No one ever hears my *
                    name right.  Ainsley.  No one ever *
                    gets that.  So I say Jill.  And he *
                    writes Jill on the cup.  Only now *
                    my coffee s ready.  They call out *
                    Jill.  I ve forgotten I m Jill!  *
                    Which wouldn t be a problem...*

                                  FRED*
                    Lemme guess...*

        A LANDSCAPER runs into frame with a JANITOR ZOMBIE on his *
      heels.  The landscaper is trying desperately to start a gas-*
      powered double-bladed HEDGE TRIMMER.*

                                  AINSLEY*
                          (nods)*
                    Another fucking Jill.  She walks *
                    off with my soy chai latte.  And I *
                    end up with her whole milk whatever-*
                    the-fuck.  But of course I don t *
                    realize it  til I m back in the *
                    car, and I m two thirds through the *
                    venti, thinking this tastes a *
                    little different.*

                                  FRED*
                    Wait, aren t you-?*                                                                                      3.


      The LANDSCAPER starts the HEDGE TRIMMER, turns, SWINGS, and *
        HALF-DECAPITATES the JANITOR ZOMBIE.*

                                  AINSLEY*
                          (nods)*
                    Lactose intolerant.  And now I ve *
                    finished a venti of cow s milk.  So *
                    I gotta pull into Walgreen s for *
                    some Lactaid so I don t get *
                    diarrhea.   Cause that s what dairy *
                    gives me.  Diarrhea.*

                                  FRED*
                    Oh my freaking God.  So-?!*

      The businessman zombie abandons its meal and runs after the *
      landscaper, who fails to extricate his hedge trimmer from the *
      janitor zombie s neck.  The businessman zombie TACKLES the *
      landscaper, who is IMPALED on the hedge trimmer.*

                                  AINSLEY*
                    Still haven t shit my pants.  *
                    Genius of Lactaid.  But day ain t *
                    over yet.  I know, I know.  Hash-*
                    tag,  First-world problems.   Some *
                    poor soul s actually suffering out *
                    there...*

      A MAN runs past the window ON FIRE, chased by a 400-POUND *
      FEMALE ZOMBIE.*

                                  FRED*
                    It s OK to get irritated.  You re *
                    used to the life you re used to.  *
                    You re allowed to get annoyed.  Ah, *
                    lunch...*

        TALLAHASSEE, 40 s, square-jawed, wearing khakis and a green *
      polo shirt,  WHICH SANDY?  embroidered onto the chest,  pulls *
      a SANDWICH CART up to the cubicles.  He s just as oblivious *
      as Ainsley and Fred to the chaos outside.*

      Tallahassee hands over 2 wrapped sandwiches, NAMES in MARKER.*

                                  TALLAHASSEE*
                     Fred.    Aisley?    Ashley?    Ass-*
                    ?  *

                                  AINSLEY*
                    It s mine.*

      The 400-pound zombie fails to catch the man on fire.  It *
      stops, catches its breath, and turns to look IN the WINDOW.*                                                                                      4.


                                  TALLAHASSEE*
                    Can I interest you in dessert?*

      Ainsley shakes her head, reaches across her desk, and holds *
      up a TWINKIE.*

                                  AINSLEY*
                    Already hit the vending machine. *
                          (to Fred)*
                    On the Lactaid, figured why not a *
                    Twinkie.*

                                  FRED*
                    Go, girl.*

      The 400-pound zombie catches sight of the Twinkie, TURNS, and *
      BEELINES for the PLATE GLASS WINDOW.*

                                  TALLAHASSEE*
                    Mm!  Can t remember the last time I *
                    had a Twinkie!*

                                  AINSLEY*
                    Shut the fuck up.  Pickles in the *
                      tuna-fish?!*

      Inspired by the tuna, the 400-pound zombie gets closer...*

                                  TALLAHASSEE*
                    You don t like pickles?*

                                  AINSLEY*
                    Pickles make everything else taste *
                    like pickles.  I specifically asked-*
                          (tosses sandwich down)*
                    Could this day possibly get any *
                    worse?!*

      On cue, the 400-pounder SMASHES through the WINDOW... and we *
      FREEZE FRAME.*

                                  COLUMBUS (V.O.)*
                    Call me crazy, she may be about to *
                    get an answer to that question.  *
                    You know what they say about zombie *
                    attacks.  You always remember your *
                    first time.  Any guesses who s *
                    gonna survive this one?  Choose *
                    fast!*

      The action STARTS again.  The 400-pounder takes AINSLEY DOWN.  *
      Then turns and BELLY-SPLASHES Fred.*                                                                                      5.


      Tallahassee recovers from the shock, thinks fast, *
        aggressively RAISES his SANDWICH CART ABOVE his HEAD, and *
      SMASHES it over the zombie s noggin.  The zombie FALLS STILL.*

                                  COLUMBUS (V.O.)*
                    Maybe you woulda chosen the *
                    sandwich guy if you knew where this *
                    scene took place.  Little state *
                    called Florida.*

      Tallahassee stands tall and spies the BUSINESSMAN ZOMBIE *
      approaching the broken window.*

                                  COLUMBUS (V.O.)*
                     Little town called... Tallahassee.*

      Tallahassee picks up a broken piece of the cart, brandishes *
      it like a weapon... and steps out the window to DO BATTLE.*

                                  COLUMBUS (V.O.)*
                      Welcome... to Zombieland.*

                    blew up an entire fireworks 
                    factory!  What could possibly be 
                    missing?

                                  COLUMBUS
                          (to Wichita, sotto voce)
                    Are we letting the  George 
                      Washington s birthday  thing go?

                                    WICHITA
                          (to Columbus, sotto voce)
                    Maybe he was born on June 17th.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    Answer me!  What was missing?!

                                  LITTLE ROCK
                    Can t you hear?

      Tallahassee strains to hear.  He s rewarded with NOTHING but *
      VAST, ENCOMPASSING SILENCE.  Columbus abruptly REALIZES:

                                  COLUMBUS (V.O.)
                    All of a sudden, I knew.  It wasn t 
                    what we could hear.  It was what we 
                    couldn t.

      Everyone gazes out over an empty STREET.  An empty CITY.                                                                                       8.


                                  COLUMBUS (V.O.)
                    The oohs and aahs of a crowd.  The 
                    laughter of friends.  The chatter 
                    of children...

                                  COLUMBUS
                    What good is fun?  If there s no 
                    one to share it with.

                                  LITTLE ROCK
                    People.



      WICHITA marches angrily up a CITY STREET, past some rotting 
      CORPSES, followed by COLUMBUS, TALLAHASSEE, and LITTLE ROCK.

                                  COLUMBUS
                    I m just saying, she s right.  
                    We ve been wandering around, just 
                    the 4 of us, for what, a month?  We 
                    need to think about our future.  
                      Humanity s future.  And there is no *
                    future without people.*

                                    WICHITA
                    Yeah, well, we ve got a saying.
                          (nudges Little Rock)
                    Tell him.  Go on.

                                  LITTLE ROCK
                          (very reluctant)
                    People suck.

                                    WICHITA
                    People.  Suck.  What s so great 
                    about people?  They re responsible 
                    for everything bad that s ever 
                    happened to anyone.

                                  COLUMBUS
                    That s not true!

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    He s right!  Shark attacks.

                                    WICHITA
                    Slavery.  And World War 2.  And...

                                  LITTLE ROCK
                      Head-lice.                                                                                      9.


                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    I once had head-lice.
                          (frowns)
                    Though I got it from a girlfriend.   
                    She was technically a person.*
                          (to Columbus and Little 
                            Rock)
                    Sorry.

                                  COLUMBUS
                    That s OK.  We prefer you on her 
                    side of the argument.
                          (to Wichita)
                    I know you re skeptical.  But you 
                    know the saying.   It takes a 
                    village! 

                                    WICHITA
                    And where are we finding this... 
                    village?

      Columbus has no answer.  But TALLAHASSEE raises an eyebrow.*



      WICHITA walks out of the ocean, slamming in a one-piece.

                                  COLUMBUS (V.O.)
                    ...a couple weeks ago.

      COLUMBUS is lying on a towel, reading a BOOK, which he subtly 
      puts away as she approaches.

                                  COLUMBUS (V.O.)
                    In the movies, a first kiss means 
                    happily ever after.  But in real 
                    life, a first kiss is only a first 
                    kiss.  The beginning of a 
                      relationship.  In this case, a 
                      relationship between two people who 
                    epically suck at relationships.  
                    The trouble started like this...

      Wichita sits down on her towel... SNATCHES the BOOK.  Stares:

                                    WICHITA
                     Rookie Dad:  Adventures in 
                      Fatherhood ?

                                  COLUMBUS
                    No, no!  It s not what you think!  
                    I don t want to be an actual 
                    father.  Not yet.  I m just trying *
                    to relate to Little Rock.*

                                    WICHITA
                    OK.  Um.  She s not your daughter.

                                  COLUMBUS
                    I guess more like sister-in-law.

                                    WICHITA
                    Nope.                                                                                      13.


                                  COLUMBUS
                      Girlfriend s sister?

                                    WICHITA
                    Hadn t discussed the G-word. 

                                  COLUMBUS
                    We are dating, right?

                                    WICHITA
                    Dating.  Right.

      She smiles to put him at ease.  But awfully NERVOUSLY.  He 
      takes her hand.  She doesn t entirely fight it.

                                  COLUMBUS
                    It occurs to me.  We know each *
                    other... but we don t really know *
                    each other.  Stuff like... what *
                    would be your favorite place to 
                      honeymoon?  Sorry!  Something 
                    lighter.  Who was your 1st grade 
                    teacher?  OK.  What s your favorite 
                    bottled water?
                          (off Wichita s stare)
                    Another time.



                                  COLUMBUS (V.O.)
                    And the trouble ended, not long 
                    after, like this...

      Our GUYS are camped out in an IKEA SHOWROOM, enjoying 
      different  rooms.   LITTLE ROCK swings in a hammock, scarfing *
      a plate of SWEDISH MEATBALLS.  COLUMBUS PLOPS down on a SOFA *
      next to WICHITA and hands her a PIECE of PAPER.  She reads:

                                    WICHITA
                    What are these?

                                  COLUMBUS
                    Clues.

                                    WICHITA
                          (reads)
                    My honey.  My sweetie.  Look for 
                    the  X  right under your feetie.
                          (beat, trying hard to act 
                            pleasantly surprised)
                      A scavenger... hunt?                                                                                    14.


      CUT TO a MONTAGE of WICHITA uncomfortably  hunting.   
      Flipping over pillows.  Kicking over trash-cans.  Columbus *
      watches.  At the end of the hunt, there s a FANCY ENVELOPE.  *
      Wichita pulls out the card and acts excited.*

                                  WICHITA*
                    A... poem!*
                          (scans)*
                    You rhymed  yearning  with... *
                       burning. *
                          (panicky)
                    That s incredibly nice.  I m so...
                          (goes to say  touched )
                    ...sorry.  Really, really sorry.

                                  COLUMBUS
                    Oh, man.  Are you..?

                                    WICHITA
                    Slowing this down.  Way down.

                                  COLUMBUS
                    But Krista...

                                    WICHITA
                          (winces)
                    Cool if we go back to Wichita?

                                  COLUMBUS
                    You re revoking my Krista *
                      privileges?!  Be honest.  Is there *
                    anyone else?*

      Wichita and Columbus look over at the anyone else:  
        TALLAHASSEE.  He s writhing around on a fake BEARSKIN RUG, 
      wrestling to get his JEANS on OVER his BOOTS.

                                  COLUMBUS (V.O.)
                    So you see, Wichita and I had *
                    already slowed it down.  Way down.  *
                    Maybe it was a good thing.  This *
                    family s plenty dysfunctional.*



                                  COLUMBUS (V.O.)*
                    Maybe that s why we need new, uh, *
                    blood...*

      Our HEROES stand downtown, BLINDED by the GLITTERY glass of 
      the L.A. LANDMARK.  Suddenly, TALLAHASSEE spies MOVEMENT.  
      It s the REFLECTION of a ZOMBIE running from behind!                                                                                    15.


      Tallahassee nonchalantly draws his WINCHESTER RANDALL, swings 
      it until it s upside-down, pointing BACKWARD over his 
      shoulder, and FIRES.  The zombie DROPS in a spray of BLOOD.*

      Alerted by the noise, a BEARDED MAN in WINDOW-WASHING GEAR 
      appears on the ROOF of the Ahmanson, where he s been taking 
      clothes off a makeshift CLOTHESLINE.  He waves excitedly.

                                  WINDOW WASHER
                    Morning!

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    Morning!  Could use some company!  
                    Join us?!

                                  WINDOW WASHER
                      Marvelous!

      The man disappears, then reappears with a SUITCASE and climbs 
      onto a WINDOW WASHING PLATFORM.  He uses the ROPE/PULLEY to 
      LOWER the platform - and himself - toward the street.

                                  COLUMBUS
                    It is marvelous.  Remember this 
                    day.  As the start of something 
                    truly special.

      Wichita ROLLS her EYES.  The man is passing a row of windows 
      when WITHOUT WARNING...

      ...a ZOMBIE SMASHES THROUGH the glass and TACKLES him.  The 
      pair SPLATS on the street.  Our heroes STARE, STUNNED.  *

                                  TALLAHASSEE*
                    Fuck.  Me.*

                                    WICHITA
                    I ll remember it alright.

                                  END OF ACT ONE                                                                                    16.


                                  ACT TWO



      COLUMBUS loads his GUN next to a GAS STATION BATHROOM.   *
      TALLAHASSEE exits the bathroom, waving the air with his hand.*

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    Talk about post-apocalypse.

                                  COLUMBUS (V.O.)
                    Funny thing, the post-apocalypse.  
                    Not funny - haha.  Funny - we just 
                    watched a man die, but we ve 
                    already moved on.  Bottom line, you 
                    can t let things get to you.  Rule 
                    #41:

        Superimposed on-screen:  a TITLE:  41.  Everybody Dies 
      Sometime.

      Tallahassee and Columbus walk back toward the YUKON, which is 
      PARKED 100 yards down the street.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    Y know, I do all my best thinking 
                    with my pants around my ankles.

                                  COLUMBUS
                    You don t say.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    And it just occurred to me.
                          (beat, we expect something 
                            important)
                    Why was every Steven Seagal movie 3 
                    words?
                          (imaginary marquee)

                    Death ...   Out for Justice ...  
                     Above the Law. 

                                  COLUMBUS
                     Hungry For Lunch. 
                          (beat)
                     Lather Rinse Repeat.

                     Keep Off Grass. 

      The two laugh as they keep it up:                                                                                    17.

                                  COLUMBUS
                          (beat, STOPS WALKING)
                     Crazy Stupid Love. 

      Tallahassee stops, follows Columbus s gaze to the YUKON, 50 
      yards ahead.  WICHITA is LYING on the HOOD, SUN-BATHING.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    A-ha!  I just figured it out!  Why *
                    you keep wearing that sad bunny *
                    face!*

                                  COLUMBUS
                    I thought you did your best 
                    thinking with your pants around 
                    your ankles.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    I was occupied with the Seagal *
                    thing.  The point is, you re upset *
                     cause you still wanna back up that *
                      ba-dunka-dunk.*

                                  COLUMBUS
                      Ba-what-a-what?

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    No one likes getting thrown out at *
                    home.  But be patient, sad bunny.  *
                    She likes you.  No idea why, but *
                    she does.  You ll get another at *
                    bat.  Wait and see.

                                  COLUMBUS
                    In the immortal words of Wichita.  
                    Whatever.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    I can t stand seeing you like this.  
                    Which is why I m gonna teach you 
                    something to do whenever you feel 
                    low.                                                                                    18.


                                  COLUMBUS
                    Here we go.

      The two start WALKING AGAIN.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    I want you to picture you ve been 
                    dead a long time.  And God comes to 
                    you.  And says, son.  I m gonna let 
                    you go back down to earth and live.  
                    For 5 minutes.  But only 5.

                                  COLUMBUS
                    Uh-huh?

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    Then picture those 5 minutes... are 
                    right.  Now.

      Tallahassee closes his eyes and feels the SUN and BREEZE on 
      his face.  Life is good.

                                  COLUMBUS (V.O.)
                    It s hard to take advice from a guy 
                    who asks for a price check at the 
                    99 cent store.  But he may be onto 
                      something.

      Columbus drinks in the sight of WICHITA.*



      A view THROUGH BINOCULARS of a LONG, TALL BRIDGE spanning a 
      CONCRETE CANAL.  Burned VEHICLES litter the bridge.  
      DETROIT s VOICE comes over car speakers:

                                    DETROIT (O.S.)
                    That should be her.  Better luck!

      The binocs  view falls on a CAMPSITE near the MIDDLE of the 
      bridge, complete with TENT and rolling HOT DOG CART.*

      We reverse angle to see TALLAHASSEE behind the WHEEL of the 
      YUKON, holding the binocs.  He lowers them.  Grins.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    Take two.



      Our HEROES walk down the bridge toward the tent.                                                                                    19.


                                    WICHITA
                    Girl Scout cookies!

      ZIP!  The tent door opens from the inside.  A GIANT (250 
      poundish) FRECKLED WOMAN with an UZI peeks out, SMILES.

                                  WOMAN
                    I m a sucker for Thank You Berry 
                    Munches.



      Our newly minted FIVESOME walks back down the bridge.*

                                  LITTLE ROCK
                          (ruh-GEEN-uh)
                    Regina?

                                  REGINA
                    Regina.  Like vagina.  With an R.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    For real?!  Vagina.*
                          (giggles)*

                                  WICHITA*
                      Over-under on how many times he *
                    says the word vagina?*

                                  COLUMBUS (V.O.)*
                    That counted as 1.  Those of you at *
                    home, feel free to play along!*

      A  1  is superimposed on-screen.*

                                  COLUMBUS*
                          (to Regina)*
                    We can t tell you how happy we are.

                                  REGINA
                    And about to get happier.  Taste my 
                      boysenberry pie.*

      Regina hands Columbus a PIE TIN.  Everyone PARTAKES. It s the *
      BEST THING they ve EVER PUT in their MOUTHS.  Within moments, *
      everyone has purple lips and teeth.*

                                    WICHITA
                    Omigod.  Omigod.

                                  COLUMBUS
                    Whoa.                                                                                    20.


                                  LITTLE ROCK
                    Shut up.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                          (happy little whimpering)
                    Never been a food worth eating that *
                    didn t make your teeth a different *
                    color.  Welcome to the family, *
                    Vagina with an R!

      Every time Tallahassee says  vagina,  he pronounces it a *
      little differently (hard  g,  french accent, etc.).  A  2  is *
        superimposed on-screen.*

      Regina walks slower than the rest, and with every step, gets 
      further BEHIND.  They fail to notice, continuing to TALK:

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    You re one of us now.  And 
                      membership has its privileges.  
                    Columbus here s got these rules for 
                    surviving Zombieland.  Kinda *
                    vagina, but absolutely foolproof.*
                          (the  2  rolls over, *
                            becoming a  3 )*
                    Then there s Little Rock.  She s a *
                    dead-eye with that rifle.  *

      The group walks toward camera in wide-shot.  Regina is nearly 
      20 feet behind...

      ...when a ZOMBIE SPRINTS into frame from right to left, 
      TACKLING her OVER the RAILING and OFF the BRIDGE.  No one 
      hears at first.  They keep right on WALKING.

                                  TALLAHASSEE*
                    And me?  My picture s up at the *
                    zombie post office.  Long as you re *
                    with us, we got your back.*

      Our heroes walk a couple more paces.  Then frown.  STOP.  And 
        tentatively, cringingly TURN AROUND.  Tallahassee slow-burns.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    Could use an anger lap.



      We look UP at our HEROES as they PEER OVER the side of the 
      bridge, APPALLED.  Everyone still has purple lips and teeth.*                                                                                    21.


                                    WICHITA
                    You can t help but think.  How 
                    quick it can all end.

      Tallahassee and Little Rock EXIT FRAME.  Wichita looks 
      Columbus in the eye:

                                    WICHITA
                    With... unfinished business.

                                  COLUMBUS
                          (hopes suddenly up)
                    Really?

                                    WICHITA
                          (nods)
                    What did you do with the pie?
                    Hey.  She took a number.  God 
                    called it.  There was nothing we 
                    could do.  Pie?

                                  COLUMBUS
                          (rolls his eyes)
                    Rule #19 for surviving Zombieland.

      Columbus opens his backpack and holds up a ZIPLOC BAG with 
      the remainder of the PIE inside.

                                  COLUMBUS

                    Thank you berry much.*



      Our HEROES are now parked by an UNFINISHED 10-story LUXURY 
      CONDO BUILDING overlooking the L.A. COUNTRY CLUB - floors in 
      place, but no exterior walls.  Tallahassee WAVES skyward.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    I m Tallahassee!  This is Columbus, 
                    Little Rock, and Wichita!

      A TALL, NERDY MAN WAVES back down from about 6 stories up.

                    No!  Stop.  We re coming to you!                                                                                    23.

                    thank you for using On-Star. 

      Our HEROES drive through an abandoned R.V. Park, headed for a 
      really big, cool MOTOR HOME.  TALLAHASSEE looks out of sorts.

                                  COLUMBUS
                    What s wrong?  This is supposed to 
                    be a very sweet old couple.

                                    WICHITA
                    And slow and weak.  Someone we can  
                    outrun when we get attacked.  Hey, 
                    it worked with the other 3.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    It s not that.  It s just... this 
                    is the first time I ve been to an 
                    R.V. Park since - since - fall of 
                     99.  Just outside Flagstaff.  Me 
                    and the little lady were getting 
                    our Grand Canyon on.  We stopped my 
                     Bago at the Oceanview R.V. Park...

                                  LITTLE ROCK
                       Oceanview? 

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    That s what I said!  So we pull in, 
                    and who parks next to us?  None 
                    other than Matthew McConaughey... 
                    in his I ve-got-a-bigger-wang-than-
                    you Airstream.

                                  LITTLE ROCK
                    The Matthew McConaughey?

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    We found one you recognize!

                                    WICHITA
                    Tell me he was shirtless.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    I m getting there.  So, dude wedges 
                    his R.V. next to mine.  Cheek to 
                    cheek, windows this close.  And 
                    proceeds to spend 9 consecutive 
                    hours... balls-to-the-floor naked.                                                                                    26.

                    That wouldn t have stopped 
                       Hollywood.   9 straight hours.  *
                    Fixing his satellite dish?  Naked.  
                    Making waffles?  Naked.  Late 
                    afternoon fucking Zumba?  Naked.  *
                    You imagine what that was like?

                                    WICHITA
                    I m gonna try.

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    Like you, my little lady was 
                    enjoying this.  Practically sliding 
                    off her seat.  So I man up.  Open 
                    the window.  And say:  Would it 
                    kill a guy to put on a stitch or 
                    two in front of another man s 
                    woman?

                                  COLUMBUS
                    And..?

                                    TALLAHASSEE
                    Dude hands me a hundred dollar 
                    bill, says,  you re welcome.   Next 
                    morning, Airstream s gone.  And 
                    there, on my driver s side window?  
                    An imprint of ass-cheeks.  What s 
                    worse, the so-called 
                      environmentalist s left 6 inches of 
                    sewage water under my front steps.  
                    Don t go barefoot around R.V. s.  I 
                    never forgave the son-of-a-bitch.



      We re OUTSIDE the R.V. for a quiet beat.  Suddenly... SMASH!  
      PEE-PAW flies THROUGH the FRONT WINDSHIELD onto the pavement.  
      A beat.  BUBBIE soars after him.  THUNK.

                                    TALLAHASSEE (O.S.)
                    Why me?!



                                  COLUMBUS (V.O.)
                    ...to Sean Kerrigan of Elberta, 
                    Michigan.

      An  Indiana Jones -esque THEME SONG kicks in as SEAN 
      KERRIGAN, a small-town hick, SHOVES against... ...one of 
      those big orange UNION 76 GAS STATION BALLS, poised at the 
      top of a HILL.  The ball ROLLS down, picking up speed, on the 
      HEELS of a ZOMBIE, like Indiana Jones in  Raiders.  

      Unlike Indiana, the ZOMBIE gets SQUASHED.  Right in our LAP.



      A reprise of  Free to Be You and Me.   The R.V. ZOOMS east.  *
      The camera travels from face to face of our HEROES, purple-*
        lipped-and-teethed, happily savoring PIE and sharing LAUGHS.*

                                  COLUMBUS (V.O.)
                      A semi-wise man once said:  Picture 
                    you ve been dead a long time.  And 
                    God comes to you.  And says, I m 
                    gonna let you go back down to earth 
                    and live.  For 5 minutes.  But only 
                    5.  Which 5 would you choose?  
                    Here s a hint.  Don t think about 
                    the where.  Or the when.  Think 
                    about the who.

      The R.V. heads toward the beckoning HORIZON.

                                  COLUMBUS (V.O.)
                    This land is your land.  This land *
                    is my land.  This land is *
                      Zombieland.  Oh, and go ahead and *
                    settle your bets, that was 5 *
                    vaginas.  Next time, we ll count *
                      fuck-bombs, so bring your *
                      calculators.   Til then, this is *
                    Columbus, Ohio, saying...goodnight.*
