      INT. CITY BUS - SAMEA2A2

      Someone watches the city pass.  Snippets of passerbys, three 
      story high cowboys boots, etc. aWOMAN s fingers tap 
      nervously.


      EXT. DOWNTOWN SAN ANTONIO - CONTINUOUSB2B2

      AHOT LATINAstepsoff the bus in front of the ALAMO.  She 
      quickly crosses toward Peacock Alley; men she passes 
      dislocate their necks trying to cop a glance.  And why not?  
      It s not everyday that 36-24-36 in a skin-tight floral dress 
      walks right on by past the Buckhornsaloon, Riverwalk, 
        courthouse...

      JASON BLUFORD, 35 and preppy, holds his WIFE-TO-BE S 
      perfectly manicured hand in his. A VIDEOGRAPHER records.

      INT. HAIR SALON - SAME33

      Foils, blow dryers and JenniRivera crooning through large 
      speakers. WOMEN of all shapes and ages are being coiffedto 
      perfection when, MOLLY PARKER, 37, blasts through the front 
      door. Dressed in jeans, an old band T-shirt and cowboy boots, 
      Molly is a classic, leggy beauty and also a red hot mess. She 
      shakes her head and several pieces of straw fall onto the 
      well shined tile floor. 

                                    MOLLY
                      I know.  I know...    KILLER WOMEN - SHAKESPEARE - GOLDENROD DRAFT - 3/142.


      REVERSE TO: REBECCA BECCA  PARKER. The 35 fiery Latinain a 
      black, silk jumpsuit glares at the straw and then at Molly.

                                    MOLLY (CONT D)
                    Ya want to kill me.

                                    BECCA
                      I rearranged my schedule to get you 
                    in here today. Like the idiot I am.

      Beccaspins around and speeds toward the washing basins. 
      Clearly this scenario has happened a million times. Molly 
      tosses her shirt to a passing STYLIST who hands her a smock 
      and keeps moving. Ne er a word exchanged.

                                    MOLLY
                    I m sorry.

      Beccaspins back to Molly.  

                                    BECCA
                      You re an hour late.  An HOUR!

                                    MOLLY
                    Big Boy took down a fence again and 
                    Billy and I had to rope him--

                                    BECCA
                    No. No. Don t bring your damned 
                      brother into this. He was a half 
                    hour late to our wedding.

      Beccastops at a sink.  Points.  Molly drops into the chair 
      as Beccapulls out Molly s ponytail holder.

                                    BECCA(CONT D)
                    Look at these ends.  Everything s 
                      broken.

                                    MOLLY
                    Ow.  Jesus.  You re hurting me.

                                    BECCA
                    Tell them to wash it twice.  Make 
                    sure the chupacabrasfall out.


      EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY44

      A foot in red heels kicks a can on a string tied to the back 
      of a ROLLS ROYCE. PAN UP TO the car s back window.  On it the 
      words  JUST MARRIED  are soaped. The Hot Latinamoves past 
      the wedding detritus and heads toward the church. Rather than 
      enter, she looks at the bell tower.      KILLER WOMEN - SHAKESPEARE - GOLDENROD DRAFT - 3/143.


      INT. CHURCH - SAME55

        Heatherslides a ring onto Jason s finger.

                                    MINISTER 
                    With this ring, I thee wed.

                    With this ring, I thee wed.

                                    MOLLY (PRELAP)
                    Don t go crazy with all those 
                      layers you loveto cut..


      INT. HAIR SALON - DAY66

      Snip. Beccacuts a layer. Molly reads e-mails on her phone.

                                    BECCA
                    Like you know anythingabout hair.  
                    What about a dress?

                                    MOLLY
                      I must have something black and 
                      boring. I married a Senator. 

                                    BECCA
                    No.  You don t.  At least not at 
                    the ranch. 

                                    MOLLY
                    You checked?

                                    BECCA
                    Of course.  The fundraiser is 
                      tomorrow night so what are you 
                    going to do, huh?

                                    MOLLY
                    I ll figure it out.

      Molly isn t listening.  She s engrossed in her mail.  

                                    BECCA
                      I left three dresses in your room.  
                    Make sure you take the two you 
                    don t like back to Neiman s. You 
                    hear me?

        Beccanudges Molly.  Molly still doesn t look up.

                                    MOLLY
                      I heard you.  Yes. Thank you.    KILLER WOMEN - SHAKESPEARE - GOLDENROD DRAFT - 3/143A.


      Beccapulls out a blow dryer and slides a business card on 
      the counter. CLOSE ON...thename and words: DIVORCE ATTORNEY.

                                    MOLLY (CONT D)
                      I already have a divorce attorney 
                    and you know thisfact. 

                                    BECCA
                    Yes. But it s been six months since 
                    you served Jake the papers and he 
                      hasn t signed. You need to get 
                      tough.  And this guy istough.

      OFF the blowdryer stork.

                                    BECCA (CONT D)
                    Now you can take your pretty dress 
                    and your ex husband to the 
                      cleaners.    KILLER WOMEN - SHAKESPEARE - GOLDENROD DRAFT - 3/144.


      EXT. CHURCH - SAME77

      DING. DING. DING.  The church bells chime the newly joined.  
      The Hot Latinacrosses herself then...whipsopen the door.


      INT. CHURCH - SAME88

      The bride and groom still face the Minister as do the guests.  
      A beat, they turn to see the Hot Latinaheaded quickly toward 
      them.  She raises the gun definitivelyas we see her face for 
      the first time.

                                    LATINA
                      Maldita.*

      BAM.  The Latinasuddenly shoots the bride.  People scream.  
      She fires again.  Point blank. Blood splatters across the 
      groom and nearby guests. Panicked, people push to get away as 
      the Latinasprints out the front door. OFF guests drawing 
      guns and pandemonium we SMASH CUT TO: 


      EXT. CHURCH - DAY99

      Several armed wedding guests fire at a beat up Camaroas it 
      speeds away.  CLOSE ON...redhigh heels left behind as 
      bullets blow out the car s rear window.


      INT. HAIR SALON - DAY1010

      Molly s WORK cell rings.  She snatches it off her belt and is 
      out the door in thesplit second Beccastepped away.  As 
      Beccacomes back to an empty chair where Molly was, we 
      REVERSE TO...thesalon front window. Patrons watch as Molly 
      leaps into a blacked out CHEVY TAHOE.  LED lights illuminate 
      the grill and deck and a siren wails as the Tahoe peels out.    KILLER WOMEN - SHAKESPEARE - GOLDENROD DRAFT - 3/145.





      INT. TAHOE- DAY1111

      Molly switches on a mobile police radio. A large, locked 
      computer is mounted on the SUVarmrest.  GPSgives a detailed 
      visual of the city and the route of the police pursuit.

                                    DISPATCH (O.S.)
                    SAPD advises silver, late model 
                      Camaro two door, partial Texas tag 
                      number BDRlast seen heading south 
                    on Stone Oak Parkway toward 410. 
                      Suspect is armed and dangerous.


      EXT. DOWNTOWN SAN ANTONIO STREETS - SAME1212

      Molly blasts past traffic.  She handles the truck expertly, 
      leans on the horn, careens around slow moving traffic as she 
      reaches behind the seat for a T-shirt and her ballistic vest.  
      Still steering with one hand, Molly changes out of the salon 
      smock, grabs a double rig gun belt and straps on a SIG239 as 
      she simultaneously retrieves a Bushmaster M-4assault rifle
      from a mount behind her head. 

                                    DISPATCH (O.S.)
                    Be on lookout for Hispanic female, 
                      approximately 5 4, 115 pounds 
                      wearing a bright patterned dress.  
                    Car headed north on I-35.  

      Molly slams on the brakes and spins the car around to head in 
      the opposite direction.  A trained tactical driver, she 
      avoids oncoming cars.


      EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY1313

      SAN ANTONIO POLICE DEPARTMENT (SAPD) squad cars are in hot 
      pursuit of the Camaro.  Ahead, TWO UNITS direct oncoming 
      traffic toward an OFF RAMP. Choppers support from the air.


      EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY1414

      Molly approaches the highway from a parallel country road.  
      She drives over a grassy embankment and enters...    KILLER WOMEN - SHAKESPEARE - GOLDENROD DRAFT - 3/146.


      EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY1515

      The Tahoe threads through traffic and clips the Camaro.  The 
      beat up car spins and hits the center divider before rolling 
      to a stop... 

                                    MOLLY
                    SHOW ME YOUR HANDS.  SHOW ME YOUR 
                      HANDS!

      The tension is palpable.  SAPD vehicles arrive on the scene, 
      flanking Molly from behind.  From inside the Camaro, no 
      movement and then... the door opens.  A leg hits the ground.  
      Tennis sneakers and jeans as... a 30 year old HISPANIC MAN 
      gets out of the car.  ANGLE ON Molly.  WTF?


                                    END OF TEASER    KILLER WOMEN - SHAKESPEARE - GOLDENROD DRAFT - 3/147.


                                        ACT ONE


      EXT. CHURCH PARKING LOT - MINUTES LATER1616

      Fifty SAN ANTONIO POLICE DEPARTMENT (SAPD) squad cars are 
      lined up; individual witnesses are being rushed into back 
      seats for transport to Police Headquarters. Fire trucks and 
      EMS vehicles block the entrance to the church.  Press vans 
      already have satellite feed.  

                                    REPORTER
                      Reports suggest a San Antonio 
                      Assistant District Attorney...

                                    REPORTER TWO (OVERLAPPING)
                    We re hearing a prosecutor has been 
                    shot.  Possibly killed.

      Molly, now in a cowboy hat with a double gun belt holstered
      around her waist, moves toward the crime scene perimeter.

                                    POLICE OFFICER
                      Ma am, you cannot come in here--

      Molly doesn t even slow down.  She simply moves aside her 
        windbreaker to reveal HER BADGE. The cop stutters...

                                    POLICE OFFICER (CONT D)
                    My apologies.  Ma am.  

      Molly smiles faintly as she blows past the perimeter and 
      heads for the church.  Two words printed on the back of her 
        windbreakerexplain the officer s reaction: TEXAS RANGER.  
      And for them, the world still parts.


      INT. CHURCH - CONTINUOUS1717

      A high tech investigation in process. A PANOSCANis set in 
      the aisle and rotates to record a 360 degree view of the 
      crime scene.  The bride s body lies face down. LIEUTENANT 
        ESTABANSALAZAR, 40 and fit, watches a wedding tape of the 
      shooting on a laptop as the shooter heads past frame.

                                    SALAZAR
                          (to SAPD officer)

                      Driver said she paid him a hundred 
                    bucks to drop her outside Chuy sin 
                    Arbor Vista. We got guys out there 
                      canvassing now.

      Photos of female Texas drivers flash on another screen.
      Salazar replays the shooting. CLOSE ON the Hot Latina.

                                    SALAZAR
                    She won t get far.  Not with that

                                    MOLLY
                      Lieutenant.

      Salazar turns.  Molly takes off her cowboy hat.

                                    SALAZAR
                      Ah-hah.  Cinco-PesoParker is here.  
                    Been quite a year for you, 
                      sweetheart. From State Trooper to 
                      TexasRanger. Congrats.

                                    MOLLY
                    Could be a spot open next year. 
                    Maybe two if I get shot or fired.

                                    SALAZAR
                    From what I hear, I m one 
                      chromosome out of contention.

      Dick.

                    So you gave him eight months of

3838INT. DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY - MORNING  

      Molly and Luis sit at a table in the center of a basic 
        bureaucratic room.  No frills.  Case files everywhere.  And a 
      mounted deer head with a CincoPeso hung around its neck.

      Molly grabs a peanut from a pile in the middle of the table.

                    What did Agent Winston tell youwas 
                    the reason for the meeting?

                                    MOLLY
                    Idiot hung up on me. But he knows

      INT. COUNTY JAIL - DAY3939

      Molly sits in a barren jailhouse interview room opposite 
      Martina Alvarez. A GUARD stands at the door: listening.  
      Molly slides a coffee across the table.

                      I forgot cream...but...Igot you

      Molly sets hand cream on the table, lip balm, toothpaste.
      Martina stares at the items with disdain.

                    Why are you here?  I have nothing

                    SAPD has charged you with 
                      premeditated murder.  And they have 
                      plenty of evidence to support their

                      I knew what I was doing when I

                    If you were angry and wanted 
                      revenge, why didn t you shoot him?

                    It s Jason.  You said Justin

      A massive bronze star rises above a modern, glass structure 
      in front of which a black SUVparks.  A beat before...the
      back door opens and a woman s foot in stilletoheels hits the 
      ground.  PAN UP the long legs to Molly. She wears a black 
      cocktail dress withher hair pulled back into an Audrey

                      I love this museum.  Dad used to 
                    take me here.

                                    LUIS
                    He was one hell of a Sheriff.

                                    MOLLY
                    Yes he was.

      OFF Molly and her bittersweet memories.    KILLER WOMEN - SHAKESPEARE - GOLDENROD DRAFT - 3/1428.


      INT. MUSEUM - NIGHT4141

      Luis and Molly enter the main gala area.  A sea of retired 
      Rangers: tall, MEN over six feet who are joined by their 
      wives. Other members of Texan elite society: politicians, 
      lobbyists, oil tycoons mingle with the esteemed lawmen.  
      Bonnie and Clyde s shot-up car sits in the center of the 
      room.  On the far wall, a projector flashes images of the 
      first Rangers with a VOwhich articulates: Steve Austin was 
      the first Texas Ranger in 1823.  Since then, the Rangers have 
      always made it their missive to stay one step ahead of 
      worldwide investigative techniques... Displays of guns, 
      spurs, badges and vests are mounted on the walls.  Molly 
      takes it all in.  With wonder. Until...

                      Lieutenant Zea.  

      Luis spins to find THE GOVERNOR.

                    haul.  Governor, this is...

      The Governor extends his hand to Molly.

                    Yes, sir.

      And the Governor is off just as WILY WHITMAN, 6 4 , 60 and 
      still daunting, approaches Luis.

                    Ya know some of the old timers were 
                      against adding women to the force.  
                    But I ll tell ya something...women
                    are a hell of a lot tougher than 
                    men.  They ll look you straight in

      Molly and Dan move through the doorway of a high end hotel

      under her dress.  She stares in his eyes.  Firm.

                                    MOLLY

                                  DAN
                      I would never do that.

      Dan s hand comes back from under her dress.  He sets Molly s 
      gun on a side table as she moves her hands around his back.  
      To his waist.  Close.

                                  DAN (CONT D)

                      I know.

        A reassuring smile.  Gentle and then...nomore talking. The 
      clothes come off and on the bed, Molly and Dan begin to make 
      love.


      INT. HOTEL BEDROOM - MORNING4343

      Molly lies next to Dan.  Outside the window, the early hours 
      of dawn in a booming metropolis.  Inside, silence.  Molly 
      studies Dan s face.  She can t help it.  Something has 
      changed between them.  Something of the heart.  Love?  Dan 
      seems to sense her gaze and wakes.  She covers an exposed 
      heart.    KILLER WOMEN - SHAKESPEARE - GOLDENROD DRAFT - 3/1430-31.

                    You betcha.  Otherwise we get shot.

      Dan faces her in bed.  Intimate.  He slides a lock of hair 
      out of her eyes.  Molly stiffens, he s too close.

                                    MOLLY
                    Why were you meeting with Heather

                    about after all?

                    No. I can separate my ambitions.

      Dan pulls away.  Okay.  Two can play that game.

                                    MOLLY
                      I don t think Martina Alvarezshot 
                    an ADA because she was sleeping 
                    with the groom.  And the fact you 
                    were meeting with the DA s office 
                    tells me your agency has an 
                      interest in this.  So what is it?

                                  DAN
                    Not your jurisdiction.  It s a case 
                    I ve been building for two years.  
                    I m not cross contaminating it with  
                    the Rangers.

      Dan gets out of bed and begins to dress.

                    Give me something to prove it.

      Molly stops.  A flash of anger crosses her face.

                                    MOLLY
                      Shutting me out is a big mistake.  
                    Maybe some day you ll figure that

      EXT. PARKING LOT - MORNING4444

      Molly changes from her evening gown into Ranger gear between 
      the two doors of the Tahoein the parking lot. INTERCUT TO 
      Luis at DPS.Inside the truck. An arsenal of Ranger gear.

                                    MOLLY
                      I think Alvarezis working for the 
                    Nuevo Laredo cartel.  

                                    LUIS
                    They hire hitmen. Not little girls.

                                    MOLLY
                    Not this time.  They chose Alvarez
                      because of her proximity to the 
                    groom and they knew they could sell 
                    this as a crime of passion.

      Molly opens the gun vault, inside, bullets and... clean 
      socks.

                                    LUIS
                    Why does Alvarezgo along with it?

                                    MOLLY
                      I don t know. They ve got something 
                    on her. Something that terrifies 
                    her.

                                    LUIS
                    More than the death penalty?

                                    MOLLY
                      I have no idea why she is so 
                      afraid, but she s served her 
                      purpose.  If we don t get 
                      protection on her. Now. She s dead.

      Molly leaps into the Tahoe.  Hair back, work gear on.

                    If you re wrong in this--

      Martina and other FEMALE INMATES shower in an open area. 
      Then, one by one, the other inmates exit.  A FEMALE GUARD, 
      the one who brought Martina to meet Molly, stands at the door

      Martina is alone.  Her back is to the door until she reaches

      Martina several times with the filed end of a toothbrush.  
      Martina struggles against the attack.  Pulls the women s 
      hair, scratches and screams. The lead attacker stabs Martina 
      once more in the arm.  Her eyes meet Martina s, a warning of

      Molly drives through a barrio just outside the city.  Small 
      shacks, tenement housing. Men on old porches. Watching.  
      Strangers are noticed here.  Especially white ones. 


      INT. SMALL APARTMENT - DAYB48B48

      Molly, large forensic crime kit in hand, enters a small, dark 
      room.  She flips the lights.  No electricity. Molly palms a 
      Sure Fire flashlight.  The small but intense beam illuminates 
      a mess.  Finger dust from SAPD is sprinkled around the 
      apartment.  The mattress is flipped over. Drawers left open.   
      Wearing latex gloves, Molly reads the SAPD report from a 
      clipboard.  The light beam moves throughout the apartment.  
      Nothing.  Nothing and then...ontop of the dresser, a Virgin 
      of Guadalupe candle next to...aworn, leather Bible that has 
      been dusted. Molly picks it up and there, deep inside, two 
      small pictures are concealed. CLOSE ON...ALatinaand a SMALL

      Molly enters the ICU room.  Martina s forehead has about 
      twenty stitches across it, about forty less than those in her 
        midsection.  She s awake, but groggy as Molly slides a chair 
      toward the bed.

      Martina s eyes begin to well with tears.

                      I can t prove it, but I suspect 
                    they were kidnapped by the cartel.

                      I don t know if I ever will because 
                    I m ashamed. I m ashamed I didn t 
                    have the strength to leave sooner.  
                    But I couldn t. I felt trapped. But 
                    I was wrong.

      Molly stands in the dark apartment.  She is dead still as the 
      blocks of her case begin to make sense. Like ghosts who 
      refuse to leave the past.  Suddenly, the door behind her 
      blasts open.  Molly spins around as TWO THUGS rush

      down Martina s cheek.  The thug grabs her from the bed and 
      throws Martina to the ground.

      Martina holds the pictures in her hands and remembers...

                                    MARTINA
                    They had been captured and the men 
                    said they would be killed if I 
                      didn t cooperate.

      The thug holds his cell in front of Martina.  On its screen a 
      video plays.  On the video, a little girl being dragged by 
      her hair.  The woman with her is kicked.  Both are slammed 
      against a wall where they are handcuffed to an rusted 
      radiator.  Though we can t hear her, the girl in the video 
      screams and reaches for the woman.

      The thug places a gun in front of Martina and a red dress.  
      He points the gun in his hand at her temple and is shouting.  
      Martina nods.  Pleads.  OFF the VIRGIN OF GUADALUPE...

                    They said if I got captured, I was 
                    to tell the police I was sleeping 
                    with that man.  If I did that, my 
                      mother and daughter would live. 
                    They took my phone and called the 
                    man, Jason.  Over and over and they 
                    hung up. I had no choice.  I never 
                      wanted any of this.  I came here so 
                      I could bring my family to America.

                    If I get your mother and daughter 
                      across the border safely, will you 
                      testify in federal court against

                                    MARTINA
                    Yes, but only when I see my family 
                    is safe.

                    No. No. He works for a trucking 
                      company.  They use him to 
                      authenticate the paperwork to 
                      transport about 40 million in 
                      contraband a year.  He s worth 
                      protecting and so they did.

                                    MOLLY
                    They staged it as a crime of 
                      passion and the police charged it 
                    that way.

      Billy exits, beer in hand. In the distance, Molly leans 
      against a fence. Big Boy grazes. 


      EXT. RANCH - DUSK7171

      Billy joins Molly.  He too leans against the fence.  A 
      posture he assumed many times while they were growing up.

                                    BILLY
                    I see your bags are packed.

                                    MOLLY
                    Jake moved out of the loft.  I 
                      should probably face the 
                      inevitable.

                                    BILLY
                    Okay.

      A beat.

                                    BILLY (CONT D)
                      Molls, I ll never come out and ask 
                    you what s really going on with 
                    Jake.  I know you well enough to 
                    know whatever it is, it s something 
                      you re not prepared to talk about.  
                    Not now.  Maybe not never.  

      Molly nods, but just barely.  

                                    BILLY (CONT D)
                    Don t use the pain inside as a 
                      weapon to hurt yourself.

                    Put it behind you anyway you need 
                    to, but put it behind you.  Holding 
                    onto that past is no good. 

      Neither sibling turns to the other.  That s the way they ve 
      always done it.  Billy taps the fence.

                                    BILLY (CONT D)
                      Alrightythen.  I gotta get 
                      daughter to talk to mother.  It s 
                    worse than the Gulf War in there.

                                    MOLLY
                    Maybe I should stick around for a 
                    few more days. I am trained in 
                      hostage negotiation.  And...

      Molly turns to Billy and smiles.

                                    MOLLY (CONT D)
                      I remember what it was like to be a 
                      teenage girl.  Sorta.


      INT. RANGER OFFICE - DAYA72A72

      LUIS stands in front of a flat screen TV.  On it, images 
      outside a large warehouse.  Several men are being led away in 
      handcuffs.  Crime tape billows in the wind.

                                    REPORTER
                    As of yet, federal agents have not 
                    made a formal statement regarding 
                    the arrests but initial reports 
                      suggest a Mexican cartel used the 
                      transport company to ship 
                      contraband...

      Molly enters the office.  Luis doesn t turn around.

                                    LUIS
                      Thought you weren t coming in 
                      today.

      Molly grabs a small case from under her desk.

                                    MOLLY
                      Forgot my trumpet.

                                    LUIS
                      I need you out on the road first 
                    thing in the morning.

      Luis turns.    KILLER WOMEN - SHAKESPEARE - GOLDENROD DRAFT - 3/1451.


                                    LUIS (CONT D)
                    We got a call from Fredericksburg. 
                      Sheriff needs help.  A bank was 
                    hit.  One point five million.

                                    MOLLY
                      Jesus.  By?

                    Five geisha.

                                    MOLLY
                      That s a joke. 

      Nope.

                                    MOLLY (CONT D)
                    I ll leave before dawn.

      Molly heads for the door.  She doesn t look back when...

                                    LUIS
                      I keep our relationship on a need 
                    to know basis.

      Luis locks on Molly.

                                    LUIS (CONT D)
                    But if I ever find out you crossed 
                    the border to free Alvarez s
                      family, I ll fire you. 

                                    MOLLY
                      I understand.

      INT. CLUB - NIGHT7373

      A lively dance hall on a Tuesday night.  Molly stands at the 
      bar waiting for a beer.  The jukebox plays.  She leans over 
      the counter to her friend the BARTENDER.

                                    MOLLY
                    Wait, wait, wait Jimmy, make it a 
                        margaritainstead. No salt...

      Dan moves silently beside her.  

                                  DAN
                      ...freshlime juice.

      Molly turns.  He s as fuckinghandsome as ever.  

                                    MOLLY
                    Wow.  This is unexpected.

                                  DAN
                    I m full of surprises.

                                    MOLLY
                    Yes, yes you are.

      Dan clinks his glass against hers.  

                                    MOLLY(CONT D)
                      Salud.

      Agroup of horn and percussion players walk out on stage. The 
      room goes wild.  Whoops all around.

                      That s my cue.  They gave me a 
                    solo.

                                  DAN
                    Don t mess it up.

        Beccawhoops; Billy picks up Luluand spins her around.  
      Hailee takes her mom s hand and spins her around.  Molly 
      enters the stage.  She watchesher family, the great vibein 
      the room.  Dan stands in the back and winks.  Mollylifts the 
      trumpet and BLOWS.  She s a master on the horn and the crowd 
      goes wild.  A faint smile as Dan s eyes lock on the one woman 
      who could capture his heart. A beat.     KILLER WOMEN - SHAKESPEARE - GOLDENROD DRAFT - 3/1453.


      Molly turns awayand when she turns back to where Dan was, he 
      is gone.  In his place, an iconic image: the famous Texas 
        LONESTARFLAG.
