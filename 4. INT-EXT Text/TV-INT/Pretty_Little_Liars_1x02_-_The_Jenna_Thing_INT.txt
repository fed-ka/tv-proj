      ANGLE ON - Hanna, who stands with MONA, but looks past her 
      friend to see Ezra, standing in the doorway of his classroom.  
      He watches Aria walk away.  The look on Ezra s face is one of 
      interest and adoration.  Hanna is intrigued.  

      Mona, who s in a perpetual scan-the-crowd mode, comments on

      FADE IN:


      Looking and feeling like four guilty little girls, the PLLs

                    And when you three woke up in the 
                    barn - Alison was gone but so was 
                    Spencer?

                                  WILDEN 
                    Yeah, I know.  It s almost exactly 
                    what you said last year.  Almost 
                    like it was rehearsed.

      Off of their looks WE CUT TO:


      The PLLs sit together at a table.  Their lunches are in front 
      of them, but no one is interested in eating.

                    It is when you re giving false

                    Oh, please. We lied about drinking.  
                    The truth that matters is we don t

                    to Ali that night.

                    We also know about someone who

                    We should have told the police the 
                    truth about Jenna s accident the

                    Telling the police now about what

      Jenna, standing alone, carrying her lunch tray.

                    too?

    A boy, who s not paying too much attention, bumps into Jenna.  
      She s vulnerable.  Lost.  Without a second thought, Aria 
      stands and approaches her.  The PLLs watch as -

      Aria approaches Jenna.

                    hospital after the accident.  

                                    SPENCER
                          (incredulous)
                    Alison did?

      Hanna nervously pops a tater tot into her mouth as the PLLs 
      share an extremely surprised look toward Jenna.

      Jenna is pleasant as pie.

                                  JENNA
                    So many people misunderstood her.  
                    But I knew exactly who Alison was.  

      What else does she know?  

                                    SPENCER
                    When did you get back, Jenna?  We 
                    heard you were in Philadelphia at a 
                    school for the visually impaired.

                                  JENNA
                    You can say blind, Spencer.  It s 
                    not a dirty word.

      The girls exchange remorseful looks -

                                  JENNA (CONT D)
                          (playfully)
                    So quiet. This used to be the fun 
                    table. What happened to you girls?

      We see the sorry look on Spencer s face as she remembers -

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:


      It s July 4th.  One year ago.  The PLLs and ALISON listen to 
      music and try on festive outfits for tonight s festivities.  
      Emily innocently looks on as Alison pulls on a skimpy, summer 
      top.  Alison catches Emily s gaze in the mirror and shoots 
      her a fun smile.  Hanna watches Alison as she models the top.  



                                                                              (CONTINUED)    PRETTY LITTLE LIARS  Ep. 102 "The Jenna Thing" Blue  4.12.10  25

      Is she studying her?  Alison whips around and glares!  Holy 
      shit she can be scary.  

      The PLLs all snap back.  Who is she pissed at and why?  

                                  ALISON
                    I see you!!!!!!

      Alison storms over to the window and throws it open.  She 
      looks outside at a tree -

                                  ALISON (CONT D)
                    Oh, my God. I can t believe it!

      The other girls run over.

                    Who was it, Ali?  What did you see?

                                  ALISON
                    He was in that tree, spying on us.  
                    I am so creeped out!

      Outside the window - the tree branches still shake.  

                                    SPENCER 
                    Who was it?

                    Yes, Aria.  He was right there!

      Alison shakes of the creeps like you shake off cooties.  

                                  ALISON (CONT D)
                    I m sure he saw us all naked.  

      Hanna cringes at the thought of it.  

                                  ARIA
                    We should tell someone.

                                  ALISON
                    We could.  But I ve got a better

      We see Spencer reflected in Jenna s dark sunglasses.  As WE 
      PULL back to reveal the PLLs are all still sitting at the 
      lunch table with Jenna, their cell phones and blackberry s 
      simultaneously sound.  

      Jenna picks up Spencer s phone which vibrates on the table - 

                                  JENNA
                    Aren t you going to get that?

      She hands the phone to Spencer.  The PLLs all look down at 
      the text they just received.  



                                                                              (CONTINUED)    PRETTY LITTLE LIARS  Ep. 102 "The Jenna Thing" Blue  4.12.10  28

      FADE IN:


      Ezra writes on the chalkboard, then turns to the class. 

                                  EZRA
                    Let s take our seats, people.  

      Emily, Spencer and Hanna huddle together near Spencer s desk.  

                                  EMILY
                    Where s Aria?  

      Hanna glances at Ezra.  

                                  HANNA
                    Maybe you should ask Fitz.  

      They give her a look.  What does she know that they don t 
      know?  The girls take their seats as the door opens.  
      Everyone turns to see - Mona.  She realizes everyone is 
      looking at her.  

                                  MONA
                    Am I late?    

                                  EZRA
                    It s Mona, right? 

                                  MONA
                    That s right, Mr. Fritz.  

      The class laughs.

                    What?

                    Take your seat, Mona, please.  

      She sits down and Hanna whispers to her.  

                                  HANNA
                    It s Fitz not Fritz.

                                  MONA
                    Oops. 

      They crack up as Fitz passes out worksheets.

                    If the mockingbird represents the 
                    idea of innocence - what characters 
                    in the book are innocent?  Take a 
                    minute to list your ideas.  

      As the class reviews their books and jots down their ideas, 
      Ezra writes on the blackboard.  He hears a chorus of WHISPERS 
      and turns to see - 

      Aria walk into the classroom.  She lays a document on his 
      desk and walks to her desk.  Ezra glances at the document: 
      It s her TRANSFER REQUEST FORM stamped DECLINED. 

      Hanna watches Aria as she sits down and pulls out her copy of 
      To Kill A Mockingbird.  

      When all heads are looking down, Aria finally allows herself 
      to look up at Ezra.  He is staring straight at her and they 
      share a private, aching look.  Hanna clocks their personal 
      moment.


      Hanna and Sean sit at the kitchen table and study.  Hanna 
      steals a look at him while he has his nose buried in a book.  
      She stands and walks to the refrigerator.  She comes back 
      with a soda and refills his glass.

                                  SEAN
                    Thanks. 

      She stands behind him and leans in to kiss his neck.  He 
      smiles, but keeps his focus on the text book.  She runs her 
      hand down his chest.  It s turning him on.

                                  SEAN (CONT D)
                    Hanna.

                    What?

      She slides her hand down his stomach, toward his - -     

                                  SEAN
                    It s too hard to stop if we go 
                    there.  

                                  HANNA
                    There s no one here but us, Sean.  
                    It s okay.

      She seductively kisses him on the neck.  He likes it.  Too 
      much.

                                  SEAN
                    Come on, Hanna.

      He pulls away from her.  Frustrated and feeling rejected, she 
      sits back down in her chair.  She tries to study, but can t 
        concentrate.  She looks back up at him. 

                                  HANNA
                    You do like me like that, right? 

                                  SEAN
                    Yes!

      This is hard for her to ask - she hesitates then -

                                  HANNA
                    Maybe you still think of me as just 
                    a friend. As that girl I used to be.   

      He leans in and kisses her.  It s a sexy kiss.  When he pulls 
      away -

                                  SEAN
                    Do you kiss your friends like that?

                                  HANNA
                    No.

      Hanna s smiling now.  She needed the validation.

                                  SEAN
                    I liked that girl you used to be.  
                    Just like I like the girl you are now.

                    Is this  waiting  really something 
                    you want or is it about your dad?  

      The front door opens and Ashley walks inside.  Ashley is in 
      the middle of a business call on her cell phone.   

                                  SEAN

      Ashley hangs up the phone and grabs a cold bottle of water 
      from the refrigerator -

                                  ASHLEY (CONT D)

                    Cute preacher humor.

      Ashley tosses Sean a friendly smile.  She likes this boy for 
      her daughter.  The moment is interrupted by the DOORBELL.  
      Ashley leaves the kitchen - 

                                  HANNA (CONT D)
                    She loves that you call her Mrs. 
                    Marin. 

      A beat later, Ashley walks back in and Hanna reads a look of 
      concern on her mother s face.  She understands when she sees 
      that Wilden is walking in behind her.

                    Look who stopped by for dinner.  

      Hanna is stunned to see this guy again.  Wilden holds a six 
      pack of beer and a to-go bag of food.

      Peter and Spencer sit at a table.  As they wait for Melissa

      Aria looks past Spencer to see Melissa and Wren arrive then 
      join Peter at their table.

      Maya sleeps soundly in Emily s bed.  Mere inches away from

      practically feel her heart beating in her chest.  Hoping to 
      create some distance between them, Emily turns on her side.  

    A moment later, Maya s hand rests on Emily s hip.  It is an 
      innocent move, but it s torture for Emily. In a bold and 
      sweet move, Emily rests her hand on Maya s hand.  It s a

      waking up, saunters into the kitchen.  She is astonished to

      For the love of God he stayed over!  Hanna steals another 
      look back at her mother, who would like to take the pan and 
      hit this ass over the head with it.

      Ashley turns to Wilden and offers an extremely placating 
      smile.

      Maya is not sure how to read Emily s mood.  She leaves the 
      car and heads into school.

      Shocking Ben, Emily leans over and plants a major kiss on 
      him.  It s a serious lip-lock.  He grabs her. It s passionate 
      and builds.  THUD. THUD. Someone POUNDS on the car window.  

      Emily pulls back from Ben.  A pack of HORNY GUYS are hanging

      The theater is almost empty.  Aria and Ella are sitting in 
      their seats, waiting for the show to start.  Ella spots Ezra, 
      obviously alone, walking down the aisle.   

                                  ELLA
                    Mr. Fitz --*

                    Come sit with us.  

      Oh, for God s sake.  Ezra tosses Aria a quick look of  well 
      here we are  then sits in the empty seat next to her.  The 
      lights go dark.  With Aria s hand on the armrest and Ezra s 
      on his leg, their fingers are only inches apart and they ache 
      to reach out to each other.  As the film begins we can feel 
      the sexual tension building between them. 


      Emily sits on her window seat and stares out at the quiet 
      night.  Pam passes by her doorway and reads the pensive look 
      on Emily s face.  She walks into the room and sits close to 
      her daughter. 

                                  PAM
                    Are you alright?

      Emily looks over to her mom.  Those three words were all she 
      needed to hear to have permission to lose it.  The tears roll 
      down her face.  Pam comforts Emily with a loving hug.  A hug 
      she so desperately needs.

      Emily tries to pull herself together.

      She stretches her sore neck and rubs her shoulder.  Wren, 
      carrying a basket of laundry, passes by the open door and

      Spencer walks across the room and pulls a text book from her 
      shelf.  

                                  WREN
                    I didn t grow up in a family like

                    pressure.  But I can imagine it 
                    could be unbearable at times.

                    You re not exactly a slouch, Mr. 
                    Oxford.  That drive came from 
                      somewhere.

      He walks over to her.  

                                  WREN
                    It came from me.  My life has been

                                    SPENCER
                    You re lucky. 

      She s so tired and he s so understanding.  She forces back a 
      well of emotion that comes extremely close to the surface.  

                                  WREN
                    I m sorry.  I m being intrusive.

                    No, you re being nice.  

      He notices her collection of architecture and design books.  
      He flips through one of the books and admires a page of Frank 
      Gehry designed chairs.  He moves closer to show her a 
      photograph -

                                  WREN
                    Gehry said that the  hat trick  
                    chair was inspired by an apple 
                    crate.  Remarkable.

      She looks at the page.  They re now almost touching.

                    I didn t realize you were into

      She can feel his breath as he slowly turns the page.  Then as 
      looks up at her -

      and Spencer locked in a salacious kiss.  Melissa stands 
      frozen, watching with steely eyes, until they move out of her 
      view.


      Still kissing, they move away from the open door.  Spencer 
      gets a hold of her emotions and pushes Wren back.

      He looks at her for a long beat, then leaves without saying a 
      word.  


      Wren walks out of Spencer s room and into the hall.  It s 
      empty.  Melissa is gone.

      Windshield wipers SWIPE the rain from the window to reveal 
      Aria, walking alone on the sidewalk.  


      Ezra slows his car and locks eyes with Aria.  He wants to

      Aria sits in the passenger seat as Ezra drives.  Neither says

      Aria, damp from the rain, walks into the house to find her

      jacket and walks into the room.  She sits across from him.

                    Look, Aria. I don t like to lie, 
                    but sometimes telling the truth 
                    does more harm than good. When we 
                    were in Europe, you found a way to 
                    let go of what happened.

                    Are you seeing her again?

                                  BYRON
                    She teaches at Hollis, so I do see 
                    her.  But not like that.  

                                  ARIA
                    Were you in love with her?

      Moment.

                                  BYRON
                    I had very strong feelings for 
                    Meredith, but my attraction to her 
                    was as much of a surprise to me as 
                    it was to her.  I had no intention 
                    of being unfaithful to your mother, 
                    and you re probably too young to 
                      understand this - but the truth is -
                    I gave into my emotions.    *

      Aria absorbs his words.  She s not too young to understand. 

      Ella and MIKE enter with take-out food.  *

                                  ELLA
                    Mr. Chung was very happy to see us.

                                  BYRON
                    By the look of all that food, I m 
                    sure he was.  

      Mike starts setting out the food.

                                  ELLA*
                          (to Aria)*
                    We got you Kung Pao.*

                                  BYRON*
                    Are you going out? *

      Aria thinks about it. Then offers up: *

                                  ARIA*
                    No, I ll stay home.*

                                  ELLA
                    I like the sound of that.  

      Aria and Byron exchange an understanding look, it feels like 
      they re making progress. 


      It s a warm and fuzzy family bonding moment as they dig into 
      their take-out meal.  




                                                                              (CONTINUED)    PRETTY LITTLE LIARS  Ep. 102 "The Jenna Thing" Blue  4.12.10  55

                    I m getting out of these wet 
                    clothes.  

      Aria walks toward the staircase.  She stops and looks back at 
      her family.  It s a picture-perfect Hallmark card moment as 
      they look and feel like the happy family Aria has always 
      cherished.  

      She smiles.  It s all good.  Aria s cell phone RINGS.  She 
      looks down at the text - the reality of  A  hits her.  It s 
      like she s pumping ice water into Aria s veins. 

      ANGLE ON PHONE: The text reads:  When students kiss teachers, 
      someone gets HURT. That s a promise I ll keep.  - A
