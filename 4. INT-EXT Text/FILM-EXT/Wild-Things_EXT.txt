A place of money and privilege.
White coral buildings surround
an open yard.
Tile roofs rise among banyan trees and banana
palms, shimmering before a blue blaze of sky.
Beyond the yard is the school's playing field and beyond that the
waters of Biscayne Bay, dappled in sunlight where the sloops of
the school's sailing class bob at their moorings.
For a moment all is quiet.
Then, faintly, the HUM of many
VOICES, rising and falling, LAUGHTER.
The CAMERA PANS to the open windows of a building somewhat larger
than the others.
The SOUNDS grow louder.
The kids change classes.
Sam, Ray and Gloria CROSS the grass.
The kids swarm past.
A pair of girls flash by.
CAROLE
Have a nice weekend, Mr. Lombardo.
SAM
Hey, Carole, you too.
And be good.
CAROLE
(beneath a pouty look)
I hate to be good.
The three adults ENTER an old wooden building.
Cheerleaders perform a sensual dance on the porch of a wooden
pagoda.
A rugby team runs drills on the grass, as out on the
bay, six tiny racing sloops tack toward the docks.
ANGLE ON DOCKS
As the sloops enter the narrow channel between the slips one
student from each boat jumps onto the dock where he or she sets
about tying off the boat.
Sam is on one of the boats.
Jimmy Leach is at the rudder.
SAM
(loud enough to be heard
by his class)
Okay, you guys.
Good work.
Now coil
those dock lines and I'll see you all on
Monday.
He watches his class clamber up the docks.
His eye falls upon
the pagoda, the dancing cheerleaders -- Kelly Van Ryan in
work-out tights -- bare arms reaching for the sky.
hosing down boats, stowing sails.
They look up as...
A HUGE POWER BOAT glides past.
The docks rock in its wake.
JIMMY
All right.
I could party on that.
Sam just laughs at him.
SAM
That's about all it's good for.
(beat)
That's the one to have.
He points to a beautiful triple-masted schooner headed out of the
bay, under sail.
SAM
The Windward Passage.
I crewed on that
one summer.
(beat)
Long time ago.
He pulls his eyes from the boat, sets about coiling a line.
JIMMY
You know, I want to thank you for
getting me into this class...
No way was
my old man going to spring for the
fees...
SAM
Hey, you're working for it.
(beneath a laugh)
Least you're supposed to be.
He tosses Jimmy the coiled line.
Jimmy's caught off-guard, but
catches it at the last second, then shares the laugh with Sam.
VOICE (O.S.)
Can I play too?
Or is it just for boys?
Sam and Jimmy turn to find Kelly Van Ryan at the far end of the
dock.
She's fresh from cheerleader practice, in a white blouse
knotted at the bottom to REVEAL a flat, tanned stomach; open at
the top to REVEAL the swelling of her breasts.
She favors Sam
with a coy smile.
KELLY
So who's washing your car this weekend,
Mr. Lombardo?
(off Sam's blank look)
The senior car wash, remember?
(beat)
Tamara's making a schedule.
She said
you bought a coupon but you're not on
anybody's list.
Sam smiles, remembering.
SAM
Well, you know.
Figured I'd buy a
Washing ticket, support the effort.
That old Jeep of mine's kind of a waste
of time, don't you think?
Sam places the coiled hose on top of a locker then starts up the
dock, Jimmy at his side.
Kelly falls in with then.
KELLY
Not at all.
How about if Nicole and I
do it?
We're working as a team.
Sam just looks at her.
She looks back -- big, pleading eyes.
SAM
Okay, try me on Sunday.
I'm going out
to the Everglades on Saturday.
You guys
can wash the mud off.
KELLY
Deal.
(beat)
You know, I just looked out front.
My
ride wasn't there.
You suppose you
could give me one?
Sam doesn't answer right away.
He looks toward the school.
KELLY (CONT'D)
You wouldn't want me to walk, would you?
I mean like, something bad might happen.
Sam hesitates, momentarily at a loss, then turns to Jimmy, who
seems to regard Kelly with something akin to physical pain.
SAM
What about you, Jimbo, you need a ride?
JIMMY
(still looking at Kelly)
What?
SAM
A ride.
You want one?
JIMMY
Yeah.
But I got my bike.
Sam's Jeep rolls out of the drive, Jimmy's bike in back, meaning
that Jimmy and Kelly are squeezed into the passenger seat, which
is fine with Jimmy.
Kelly's thigh is pressed against his.
His
arm pushes against her breast.
Kelly is not so happy.
As they near the school's entrance, they come upon a beat-to-shit
VW bug -- stalled at a stop sign.
A John Deere tractor mower sits nearby.
A groundsman -- a tall
black guy with a shaved head, waits at the wheel of the bug as...
Suzie Toller -- in black platform shoes, a T-shirt and cutoff
jeans, leans over the engine, fiddling with the car's linkage.
Sam pulls up next to the bug and stops.
SAM
We got room for one more, Suzie.
You
need a ride?
Kelly rolls her eyes as Suzie turns to look at them.
KELLY
Jesus.
Where'd she get those shoes?
Whores-4-Less?
Suzie's eyes go cold.
She signals the groundsman, who turns the
key.
The CAR SPLUTTERS to life.
Suzie flashes a smile, then
sticks out her tongue -- which has been pierced by a silver stud.
KELLY (CONT'D)
That's cute.
Suzie gives her the finger.
Sam makes eye contact with Suzie,
offers a sad smile, while putting the Jeep in gear.
KELLY (CONT'D)
(to Suzie)
I hope you swallow it.
Jimmy turns, waving to Suzie as the Jeep pulls away.
Magnificent old mansions occupy five-acre bay-front parcels amid
lush, tropical settings.
Sam's Jeep stops before a pair of gates with the words "VAN RYAN"
woven into their wrought-iron design.
Beyond the gates a long
drive leads toward a huge stone house.
Kelly jumps out, punches
in a code.
The gates swing open.
KELLY
Don't forget the car wash.
SAM
I won't.
SANDRA VAN RYAN, Kelly's mom, big, sexy, aggressive, a young 42
in a string bikini, comes out from the side of the house.
When
she sees the Jeep, she starts down the drive.
Kelly waves to Sam, then walks up the drive.
When she sees her
mother coming toward her, her face hardens.
SANDRA
Is that Sam Lombardo?
KELLY
(sarcastic)
Hi, Mon.
SANDRA
Sam!
Hi!
Sam has already hung a U.
Sandra comes through the gate and up to the Jeep.
Jimmy is checking her out.
All eyes.
SANDRA (CONT'D)
(to Sam; as if Jimmy
wasn't even there)
What?
You're going to drive off without
even saying hi?
SAM
Hi, Sandy.
SANDRA
Why don't you come in, have a drink?
SAM
Can't.
Got a passenger.
Sandra looks down her nose at Jimmy.
SANDRA
He can wait.
Sam glances past her, to Kelly, who stands languidly at the front
of the house, watching.
SAM
I can't, Sandy.
I've got to run.
SANDRA
I'll bet.
(then, softening)
Look, Sam.
Why don't you come by this
weekend.
We'll take the boat out...
SAM
(cutting her off)
Sorry, Sandy.
I've got plans.
SANDRA
What?
Running over alligators with that
silly swamp jalopy when you could be
sailing a real boat...
SAM
Swamp's where it's at, Sandy.
Gives you
a look into the muck we all crawled out
of.
You ought to try it some time.
Sandra gives him a hard stare, then marches off toward the house.
CLOSE ON KELLY
still at the door, a cold smile on her face.
FADE TO:
Neat little stucco houses -- some not so neat -- simmer in
tropical heat.
A BMW Z-3 Roadster stops at the head of the cul-de-sac.
Nicole
is driving.
Kelly sits beside her.
NICOLE
This is it?
Kelly looks at a pad of paper, nods.
KELLY
Four-thirty-seven.
They pass a couple of teenagers playing basketball in a driveway,
a guy mowing his yard.
NICOLE
Nice.
KELLY
What do you want, he's a teacher for
Christ's sake.
(beat)
It's here.
Pull over.
Nicole does, before one of the not-so-neat houses.
Sam's muddy
Jeep Wrangler is parked in the drive.
Behind that is a red
Mercedes convertible.
As Barbara goes to her car she sees the girls coming from behind
the garage.
She looks at Sam, standing in his doorway, watching
the girls.
When he sees Barbara looking at him, he shrugs, then
waves.
Kelly and Nicole, looking very much like the finalists in a wet
T-shirt derby, ring the bell.
Sam answers.
He looks them over.
A couple of houses down he can
see the guy with the mower, dumping grass into a can, watching
the girls, then turning to walk back to his house.
SAM
So, where you off to now?
KELLY
Aren't
you forgetting something?
(off Sam's look)
Your coupon.
We gotta have it.
SAM
Jeez, that thing... Can't you...
KELLY
(smiling)
Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo.
Nicole laughs.
SAM
All right.
I'll have to look for it.
KELLY
(as he starts to go)
Mr. Lombardo.
(as he stops)
We're running kind of late.
How about
if Nicole goes on to the Mansons?
You
could give me a ride when you find the
ticket.
Sam looks at her, as does Nicole.
SAM
Give me a minute.
He hurries from the room.
Kelly turns to Nicole, giving her the
eye, pointing toward the drive.
NICOLE
(mouthing the words)
Are you sure?
Kelly nods, a mischievous smile on her face.
A long, slow, Antonioni PAN -- time passes -- the cul-de-sac --
the sparkling lawns -- the kids with the basketball -- a jogger
passing by...
DISSOLVE TO:
The front door.
The door opens.
Kelly comes out, fast, slamming
the door behind her.
She walks down the drive.
There are tears on her face.
As she hits the street, she begins
to run.
The man with the mower is now seated on his parch, drinking beer.
He watches as the girl runs by.
The teenagers are still playing hoops.
They stop as Kelly jogs
past, sobbing.
They watch as she hits the end of the cul-de-sac
and DISAPPEARS around a corner.
Sam, perched in the pilot's seat of a beat-to-shit old air boat,
rips through the Florida swamp land.
He glides across channels of water, then turns into the tall
grass which whips at the hull of his boat.
Bits and pieces of
debris fly through the air.
Sam smiles, swinging the boat
through a series of wide, sliding turns.
Suddenly he spots something.
He throttles down gliding into a
shallow pool where... A HUGE ALLIGATOR, aware it has been found
out, whips about, stirring up mud, then scuttling OUT OF SIGHT
SAM
Sly old fucker.
How you got so big,
wasn't it?
Sam sits for a moment in the silence.
He pulls a pair of
binoculars from beneath his seat and looks through them.
ANGLE ON HORIZON
All we SEE is a shabby collection of whitewashed buildings
shimmering in the last long light of afternoon.
Sam watches for some time.
At last he lowers the binoculars,
revs up his engine and leaves.
ANGLE ON SAM'S BOAT
as it moves away, as SEEN from water level where...
The old gator has risen once more -- just the eyes -- a cold
primordial intelligence, gazing out, unblinking across the murky
waters of the swamp.
Sam's Wrangler pulls in next to Barbara's Mercedes.
The Jeep is
muddy once more.
So is Sam.
He gets out.
Kelly Van Ryan sits on the dock, looking back toward the huge
stone house, where...
A YELLOW LIGHT burns in one of the upstairs windows.
Kelly has a shotgun laid across her knees.
Slowly, she raises
the gun, pointing at the yellow window.
She holds it there for some time, then, softly, to herself...
KELLY
Bang...
Sunlight streams through open windows, mingling with loud sighs
of pleasure... Sandra Van Ryan on top of FRANKIE CONDO, a big,
buffed-out Cuban.
They're making love on the bed.
She throws
her head back -- an explosion of hair -- gasps -- an orgasm is
near, as...
A cordless PHONE RINGS on the night table.
They try to ignore
it.
No dice.
Sandra groans, finally pulling away.
SANDRA
Goddamnit!
(she answers)
Hello.
COMPUTER VOICE (V.O.)
Hello, this is the attendance office at
Blue Bay School.
Your son or daughter
is absent today, Monday...
SANDRA
Jesus H. Christ!
She hangs up hard.
Sits on the edge of the bed.
FRANKIE
What?
Sandra waves him off.
She pulls on a T-shirt, then grabs up the
phone once more, punching in a number.
The SHOTGUN BLASTS away.
Kelly pauses to reload.
She catches
sight of...
Sandra, approaching from the main house.
SANDRA
You seem to find guns therapeutic.
Maybe I oughta try it.
Kelly lets the gun's barrel drift over Sandra, then turns to walk
away.
She moves toward the guest house.
A used-brick cottage
tucked among the gnarled branches and roots of a huge banyan
tree.
Sandra follows.
SANDRA (CONT'D)
Let me guess, some boy didn't call and
screwed up the weekend.
So you're
taking the day off.
Kelly looks toward the main house, in time to see...
Frankie walk from the bedroom and dive into the pool.
KELLY
Which one of your "bodyguards" is that?
SANDRA
Whichever one I want.
Kelly turns away, starts for the guest house once more.
An old Spanish-style building sits before a neat square of grass.
SANDRA (V.O.)
My daughter does not get raped in Blue
Bay!
Ray takes notes, talks with neighbors, kids, lawn mower man.
Gloria talks with students -- Jimmy, Nicole, others.
The sky has begun to color.
Art Maddox stands on the grass at
the end of the channel separating the slips, watching as...
A lone sailboat tacks toward the school.
ANGLE ON BOAT - SAM & JIMMY
Sam drops his sail, leaving himself just enough momentum to
cruise expertly into the little channel then into the slip.
Art watches as Jimmy jumps from the boat, ties it off.
SAM
That's good, Jimbo.
I'll see you on
Monday.
Jimmy hesitates, he wants to say something.
Sam waves him off.
Jimmy gives Art a hard look and heads for the grass.
SAM (CONT'D)
(to Art, nodding after
Jimmy)
What's left of my sailing class.
Art studies the dock between his feet.
SAM (CONT'D)
Talk to me Artie.
ART
Kelly Van Ryan...
SAM
... is accusing me of rape.
Jimmy told
me.
Apparently I'm the last to know...
ART
Sam... I...
(a long beat)
Sandra Van Ryan's been on the horn with
every member of the school board all day
long.
She's pushing for suspension...
SAM
This is insane.
Art shakes his head.
ART
All I can tell you Sam, is hang in
there.
They clear you of this mess, you
get reinstated, with back pay...
SAM
That's great.
I'll just tell my
creditors I'm not a rapist.
No
problem... Shit.
(beat)
I can't believe the board's going to act
without even hearing my side of it.
ART
The Van Ryan family created Blue Bay.
They built the school... Sandra Van Ryan
calls up the board and says kiss my ass,
they say, left, right, or in the middle.
(beat)
You're gonna need some help on this one,
Sam.
You're gonna need a lawyer, and
he'd better be a good one.
Typical of its kind -- a Blockbuster Video, a 7-Eleven, half a
dozen small businesses, one of which, sandwiched between a donut
shop and the Mongolian Beef Bowl, bears the sign:
"KEN BOWDEN --
ATTORNEY AT LAW."
Trendy nouveau.
A valet parks Sam's Jeep.
Red neon identifies it as Jim's Recovery Room.
A handful of
trucks sit in a dirt parking lot, Sam's Jeep among them.
Sam walks outside.
He stands in the red glow of neon light,
looking toward the road... On the opposite side of which...
... sits a sorry little collection of whitewashed stucco
bungalows, identified by a green neon sign as the Glades Motel.
Beyond the motel are the Everglades, a great expanse of darkness.
Sam stares at the motel.
At last he gets in his Jeep.
As he
EXITS the lot, a second pair of headlights flashes on.
A deserted two-lane road cuts through the swamp.
Trees bearded
with moss appear as ghostly shapes in the lights of Sam's Jeep.
San drives -- a tired face.
Soft MUSIC on the RADIO.
Something APPEARS in the road, caught for a moment in the
headlights.
Sam swerves, whirls his head around, sees...
A GATOR sliding of the shoulder and into the murky water.
Sam lets out some air, relaxing a bit, then catches sight of
something else -- Headlights finding reflection in his rearview
mirror, coming fast.
Sam watches as the lights get closer.
He
looks back to the road -- an approaching curve...
Sam is into the curve when the lights catch him.
A black Range
Rover moves out to pass, then turns suddenly into Sam's lane,
cutting him off.
It happens quickly.
Sam swerves to avoid hitting the larger car,
but the road affords little margin for error.
The JEEP slides across a narrow shoulder, then plummets down a
steep embankment, CRASHING through cattails, rolling over to SLAM
BACK DOWN on its tires in a swampy gulch.
Sam slumps back from the steering wheel.
Somewhere over his head
he can see headlights shining into the trees.
He hears a CAR DOOR SLAM, the SOUNDS of someone scrambling down
the embankment.
Sam tries to get out of his seat harness.
Someone is
approaching, splashing through the muck.
Suddenly a hand reaches
through the broken driver's window, helping him.
MAN'S VOICE
Are you all right?
The hands get him loose.
Sam stumbles from the car.
SAM
Yeah, I'm okay.
He looks up to find -- Frankie Condo, looming over him.
FRANKIE
That's too bad.
He grabs Sam, pulling him OUT OF FRAME.
What we are left with is
the SOUND of FISTS THUDDING INTO FLESH -- then Sam, hitting the
hood of his Jeep, slumping down into the muck.
Frankie is breathing hard.
We HEAR him SLOGGING back up the
embankment.
We HEAR a DOOR SLAM, the RANGE ROVER driving away,
leaving only darkness, and the EERIE SOUNDS of the swamp.
Dazzling light.
Sam's smashed-up Jeep is parked before Ken
Bowden's office, next door to the Mongolian Beef Bowl.
Ray and Gloria drive through the Everglades, past marshlands
punctuated by thick stands of melaluca trees.
GLORIA
They say it was old man Van Ryan planted
the melalucas to dry up the swamp.
Ray nods.
GLORIA (CONT'D)
You can go up to one of those trees and
peel the bark.
You know what you get?
More bark.
And more bark.
There's no
core.
Tree's not good tar anything but
sucking up water.
And now they can't
get rid of them.
They've tried poisons.
Nothing works.
They don't die.
RAY
Yeah, well, Van Ryan got his.
I don't
imagine he gives a shit now.
Gloria just looks at him.
Ray stares into the dusty light of an
approaching sunset.
At last he slows, turning off the highway
and onto a narrow dirt road.
A sign pokes out from the tall grass -- "SMILIN' JACK'S FISH
CAMP."
The Taurus bounces along the washboard road.
GLORIA
You're sure we're not lost?
They are driving now at the edge of a canal.
RAY
You remember that little girl walked out
of our talk at Blue Bay?
GLORIA
The skinny brunette.
RAY
This is where she lives.
She wants to
talk.
(beat)
Beats the shit out of me why she would
call me at all.
I busted her once for
possession.
she wound up doing about
six months at Camp Nine.
GLORIA
You mean Camp Sixty-Nine.
Ray gives her a look.
Gloria shrugs.
GLORIA (CONT'D)
That's what they called it when I was in
Juvenile.
It's a pretty dismal place.
RAY
It's a shithole.
But she was dirty,
what was I gonna do?
They pass a sagging chain-link fence, entering a quarter-mile run
of shabby trailers and cheap shacks.
The squalor of the buildings is seat in contrast to the beauty of
the Glades where the waters have gone to the color of polished
brass beneath an immense, darkening sky.
Ray parks before a ramshackle building covered in vines and
peeling paint.
A sign reads:
"NIGHT CRAWLERS $1 A BUCKET."
The
jawbones of numerous gators hang beneath the eaves.
As they get out of the car, something catches Gloria's eye --
along the bank of the canal...
ANGLE ON BANK
where a tall man (WALTER) with long white hair and tattooed arms
kneels inside a pen, slapping a huge gator on its snout.
The
reptile lifts its upper body, hissing, opening its jaws.
Walter takes a stick from his hip pocket, passing it through the
gator's mouth.
The jaws snap shut, incredibly fast, with a
hollow snapping sound.
Gloria jumps instinctively, then watches, aghast, as Walter slaps
the creature once more.
This time moving round to the front of
the gator, sticking halt his arm inside its mouth.
VOICE (0.5.)
He's just showin' off for you now.
Gloria starts, then turns to find a woman (RUBY) has walked up
beside her.
The woman is in her sixties.
She's dressed in
polyester.
Her hair is piled on top of her head -- too dark to
be anything but a dye job.
A cigarette bobs from her lips.
Before Gloria can respond, Ray steps up behind than.
RAY
Evening Ruby.
(beat)
I see you still got Walter.
I was sort
of hoping something had eaten him by
now.
RUBY
(a long beat)
Can I help you with something?
Ray and the old lady look at each other.
RAY
Suzie called.
You know where we can
find her?
Ruby looks toward the store.
RUBY
You know the way.
She watches as the detectives CROSS the road, then calls to them
as they start up the steps.
RUBY (CONT'D)
You won't shoot her will you?
I don't
believe she's armed.
Gloria turns, surprised.
Ray gives the woman a long, cold stare,
then opens the door for Gloria.
Video crews surround a limo as Sandra and Kelly EMERGE.
CYNTHIA (V.0., CONT'D)
... with its tabloid appeal -- Sandra
Van Ryan -- jet-set real estate
heiress...
Tom Baxter and Barbara jostle up the steps.
CYNTHIA (V.0., CONT'D)
The powerful Blue Bay elite...
Suzie, in the company of Ruby and Walter, pushes past the video
crews.
CYNTHIA (V.0., CONT'D)
... the girl from the wrong side of the
tracks...
top down, speeds on a highway, banana palms on one side, the blue
Atlantic on the other.
Wind buffets Ken and Sam -- who has a dazed look.
KEN
(hyped)
Come on, let loose!
SAM
I was just thinking about where I'm
gonna stay.
I lost the house.
It's
like waking up from a goddamn nightmare.
KEN
You'll get over it. We've got a
knockdown, airtight, motherfucker of a
lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan.
SAM
Just like that?
KEN
Just like that?
These people ruined
your life, bro.
Ken pauses to thump the wheel with the butt of his hand.
KEN (CONT'D)
I told you they were going overboard and
they did... They'll settle.
Believe me.
They'll be begging to settle...
At which point Ken spots something up ahead.
His smile broadens.
He swerves into the other lane, tooting his horn, waving, as...
The T-bird draws even with a sleek black limo.
SAM
You don't think you're overdoing it?
He pulls off his neck brace, dangles it in front of Sam's face,
then tosses it out the window.
Sam cruises slowly across the water in his junked-out air boat.
He kills the engine, allowing the craft to glide to a stop.
He's close to where he found the big gator -- the same shabby
collection of whitewashed buildings we now RECOGNIZE as the
Glades Motel, shimmers in the distance.
Sam leans back, enjoying the silence.
He reaches into a cooler,
takes out a beer, opens it, takes a drink, then pulls something
else from the cooler --
-- a bundle of white butcher's paper.
Sam opens the paper, takes
out raw meat -- something disgusting to look at -- big red turkey
necks, maybe, which he tosses into the water.
ANGLE ON WATER
as the meat drifts down -- then, a sudden boiling, as -- quick as
the strike of a snake -- the huge gator EMERGES, jaws wide, to
snap up the morsel before slipping beneath the surface once mare.
DISSOLVE TO:
A hot morning in June.
Shadows angle across the campus.
Students line up at the old wooden pagoda, picking up caps and
gowns.
A few turn, surprised to see...
SAM LOMBARDO cross the parking lot, ENTERS a building.
Sam's Jeep is parked next to the T-bird and Jaguar.
Moonlit fog -- the vast swamp.
It's late.
A neon palm tree flashes across an empty lot as...
Sam's Jeep pulls in out of the night, parks before its bungalow.
Sam gets out, lifts his storage box of files from the rear.
Sam walks down the steps, gets into his Jeep, and drives away.
Across the street -- the white Taurus -- Ray and Gloria watch.
Sam comes out, rounds a corner and is gone.
Ray Duquette steps INTO FRAME, turns into the brokerage.
The
door swings shut behind him.
Only a few cars left -- one of them Suzie's old VW bug, at the
side of which Kelly and Suzie engage in heated conversation.
CLOSER - SUZIE
paces around Kelly.
SUZIE
You don't know Duquette.
I'm the one he
busted... He's a fucker, man... He'll
fuck us both over...
Kelly tries to take her by the arm.
Suzie jerks away.
SUZIE (CONT'D)
I'm not going back to that prison.
That's what it was... a fucking hell
hole...
Kelly looks around the lot.
She takes Suzie by the arm once
more, this time more firmly, pulling Suzie to her.
KELLY
Will you calm down.
Duquette's gonna
come to you just like he did to me.
You're gonna have to be ready for him.
SUZIE
Yeah, but he can't push you around like
he can me.
You've got family and
they've got clout.
With we it's
different... with me...
KELLY
(circling her with her
arm)
Yeah, I've got family and they've got
clout and now you have me.
Right?
And
Sam.
Believe me, Suzie, this dickhead's
not going to send you anywhere.
He's
gonna try and rattle your cage, and
that's it.
Stay strong and he can't do
shit.
SUZIE
(a long beat)
Man, I wanna smoke a joint.
PULL BACK to REVEAL -- in the distance -- the white Ford Taurus
at the side of the road leading to the school.
The car is pulled just far enough off the road to be mostly
hidden among pampas grass and oleander, but angled in such a way
as to afford a view of the two girls now hugging in the lot.
Suzie wanders along the canal, smoking a joint.
At her back a
few faint lights flicker here and there in the windows of
trailers.
She walks down to the little dock, sits on a rail,
takes another hit.
VOICE (0.S.)
'Evening, Suzie.
How was school today?
Suzie freezes, holds back her exhale, looking around...
A shadow stirs in one of the skiffs tied to the dock.
A man
stands, walks up the couple of wooden stairs.
The light from a
trailer across the road glances off steel-rimmed glasses as Ray
Duquette steps onto the dock.
Suzie gags on the smoke in her lungs, coughs.
She squeezes the
lit roach into her palm, then tosses it into the canal.
RAY
You ought to watch it with that shit,
Suzie.
You get busted again, you go
back in a two-tine loser.
SUZIE
You got something against cigarettes?
Ray just laughs at her.
RAY
Yeah, they're bad for your health.
(beat)
I'm tryin' to look out for you...
SUZIE
That's cop bullshit.
RAY
Well, you're half right.
Best thing you
could do for yourself right now would be
to talk to me.
SUZIE
About what?
RAY
Every triangle I've ever seen never
lasts.
Somebody's got to go.
SUZIE
Is this supposed to mean something to
me?
What triangle?
RAY
You, Kelly, Sam.
SUZIE
I don't have to listen to this.
And you
can't shove me around.
I have friends
now...
She catches herself, falters.
Ray laughs once more.
RAY
Is that what you think?
You have
friends?
Is that what they told you?
SUZIE
I don't mean who you're thinking.
I
have other friends...
RAY
Suzie, Suzie... This is me, Ray, you're
talking to.
We both know you don't have
shit, never have had shit, never will
have shit...
He takes a sheet of paper from his coat.
RAY (CONT'D)
Here, Suzie.
I want you :o look this
over.
Know what it is?
(as Suzie takes it)
Sam deposited his check, transferred the
funds to an offshore bank, a numbered
account.
Not even the cops can find out
whose names are on it.
Think one of
them's yours?
Suzie looks over the paper.
RAY (CONT'D)
He also put a down on some island
property, and a lease-to-buy on a
forty-foot sailboat.
You're into
sailing, aren't you, Suzie?
Suzie thrusts the paper back at Ray.
SUZIE
Get away from me.
RAY
Don't you see what this means?
You
really think Sam and Kelly are gonna
give you a third of the money?
You, the
pill-head with the rap sheet?
SUZIE
Shut up.
Ray smiles at her.
He moves up close.
RAY
You know, I don't think I ever told you
I was sorry about your little friend...
What was his name?
Suzie tries to back away.
She bumps against the rail.
Ray
reaches out, takes her hand in both of his.
RAY (CONT'D)
Come on, Suzie, help me out here.
You
know his name.
Suzie looks scared, in a way she hasn't before.
When she speaks
her voice is scarcely above a whisper.
SUZIE
Davy.
RAY
(nodding, a scary smile)
That's right.
That was his name.
The smile fades, as if he's thinking about something, still
holding her hand, rubbing it with his fingers.
RAY (CONT'D)
Sometimes I wonder if you're really as
dumb as you pretend to be.
He looks into Suzie's eyes, slowly opening her hand to REVEAL the
burn mark on her palm.
RAY (CONT'D)
But you know what?
I'd be keeping a
clear mind right now if I were you.
(beat)
I'd hate to see you come to a bad end.
Like Davy did.
He holds her hand a moment longer, then drops it.
He goes back
down he steps to the little skiff.
An outboard MOTOR STARTS in
the night.
parked behind some cottonwoods in a small launch area where the
highway crosses both the canal and the road to the fish camp.
The skiff has been shoved into the bed.
Ray sits at the wheel.
He removes his glasses, wipes his face with a handkerchief, then
starts at the uneven 50UNDS of a tired ENGINE, looks up to see...
HEADLIGHTS
Suzie's VW bouncing along the dirt road, turning onto the
highway.
RAY'S TRUCK - RAY
watching, then starting his truck and pulling out onto the
highway, following the tiny red lights of Suzie's bug.
SXT. VAN RYAN ESTATE - MAIN GATE - NIGHT
Suzie's VW idles.
She leans out the window, talks to the
intercom, the gate opens.
The VW ENTERS.
The gate closes.
Ray's pickup drives past.
He drives to a big lot where one of
the mansions has been torn down.
He drives up onto the dirt,
keeps going, right down to the water's edge where he pulls his
little skiff out of the back once more.
He walks back to the truck, pulls off his sport coat, hangs a
Hi-8 video camera over his shoulder and wades out into the calm
waters of the bay, pushing the skiff, then climbing in.
Suzie follows Kelly past the pool, which is all lit~up, and on
toward the jacuzzi.
The whole deck is tiled in black-and-white.
Kelly's in a bikini -- the killer body.
Suzie, the contrast --
pale, skinny, boyish, in a T-shirt and cutoff jeans.
They
argue -- we CANNOT HEAR.
Ray has arrived near the docks.
He has killed his engine,
maneuvering here with a single oar.
He ties the skiff off behind
the Jonathan, then climbs to the dock, moving around the guest
house and coming close to the pool.
He takes a position behind
the cabanas, readies his camera.
Kelly and Suzie continue their argument in front of the jacuzzi.
KELLY
I can't believe you called Sam.
What's
the matter with you?
SUZIE
I'm scared, that's what.
I'm scared
there's no one to trust.
KELLY
You can trust me.
A cordless PHONE RINGS on the patio chair.
Kelly and Suzie are
startled by it.
Kelly answers.
Kelly glances across the steamy water at Suzie.
KELLY
Yeah, right.
Can you at least talk to
her, on the phone?
NT. SAM'S BUNGALOW - SAME
Sam lies on his bed, waits for Suzie's voice on the line.
SUZIE (V.O.)
Sam...
SAM
Put Kelly on too.
The girls stand cheek-to-cheek, the phone between them.
KELLY
I'm here.
Ray tapes the scene.
The girls still hold the phone.
SUZIE
But I..
SAM (V.0.)
Shut up.
Don't fall apart.
The only
people who can blow this is us.
Remember?
KELLY
Right.
Suzie says nothing.
Kelly nudges her.
SUZIE
Yeah, right.
SAM (V.0.)
Good.
Just keep telling yourselves
that, the only people who can fuck this
up is us.
The line goes dead.
Kelly hangs up.
Suzie stares into the
jacuzzi.
SUZIE
You're gonna fuck me over, aren't you?
KELLY
Oh, for Christ's sake.
SUZIE
You are.
KELLY
Are you retarded, or just brain dead
from whiffin' fumes out there in the
swamp...
Suzie's face goes hard.
SUZIE
That's what I am to you, isn't it?
Swamp trash.
It's what I am to
everybody, just like my mom...
Kelly tries to put an arm around her.
Suzie slaps her -- a
mistake -- Kelly's bigger, faster.
She slaps the side of Suzie's
head, then grabs her legs, dumping her on the tile deck.
ON RAY
focusing the camera.
Suzie tries to kick Kelly.
Something changes in Kelly, a scary, calm rage.
KELLY
Stupid bitch.
She very methodically grabs Suzie's hair, dragging her into the
jacuzzi, holding her under the hot water.
Suzie thrashes, breaks free, gags, arches out of the water, the
wet T-shirt clinging to her small breasts.
Kelly is on her again, slaps her, puts her hands to Suzie's
throat -- violently sexual in her wet bikini.
Kelly slams Suzie back onto the black-and-white tile, gets on top
of her, knees between Suzie's legs, her hands on her throat.
Suzie's skinny shape writhes underneath Kelly on the gleaming
tile.
She gasps for air.
Kelly finally lets go, but remains on
her knees between Suzie's legs, breathing hard.
A moment.
Kelly
touches Suzie's face.
KELLY
Why do you make me hurt you?
It's like
you want it or something.
Suzie sobs, takes Kelly's hand.
KELLY (CONT'D)
God, you are scared, aren't you?
Suzie runs her lips over Kelly's fingers, then pushes her T-shirt
up, pushing Kelly's hand onto her breast.
KELLY (CONT'D)
And this is going to make you feel
better, make you trust me...
Suzie nods, tearing her T-shirt, getting both of Kelly's hands
onto her breasts, then pushing at Kelly's wrists, getting her to
pull at her nipples, hard... Kelly obliges...
Suzie cries out in pain.
Kelly's hands move down to pull off
Suzie's bottoms...
ON RAY
still at it with the video, his face impassive, watching.
As Kelly pulls Suzie back into the jacuzzi, as the girls' hands
slide round the curves of each other's hips, pulling themselves
to each other, as the layers of steam rise to envelope them...
CUT TO:
VIDEOTAPE
Kelly and Suzie making love in the jacuzzi.
PULL BACK to REVEAL --
Sam EXXTS a building, a large package of wrapped goods beneath
his arm.
He looks toward the parking lot where --
Barbara Baxter stands beside the red Mercedes.
She tips a valet
then starts toward the mall.
She sees San.
Their eyes meet.
A
moment of hesitation, as neither is quite sure what to say.
SAM
You look pretty.
BARBARA
Thanks.
Sam smiles.
She points to the stuff beneath his arm.
BARBARA (CONT'D)
Quite a shopping spree...
She's kidding, then seems to consider how Sam might take it.
BARBARA (CONT'D)
I didn't mean...
Sam laughs it off.
SAM
Hey, I've got it, I may as well spend
it, right?
I've always wanted to live
where I could dive for my dinner.
BARBARA
And where might that be?
SAM
I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.
BARBARA
I love Antigua.
(beat)
Maybe I'll come visit you.
SAM
I'd like that.
A moment, she touches his face.
Sam raises a hand to cover hers,
as...
... in b.g., a BLACK RANGE ROVER -- just the roof VISIBLE above
the tops of the other cars, cruises the lot.
The Atlantic rolls before a long stretch of empty sand as the
last red light drains from the sky.
The Range Rover comes down onto the sand, parks.
Kelly turns off the engine.
Suzie tokes on a joint, swills the
MD 20/20.
She gazes upon the sea, eyes at half-mast.
SUZIE
I thought we were goin' to a movie.
KELLY
I think we just need to get wasted.
Suzie shrugs, gets out.
Kelly gets out with her.
Suzie
staggers.
Kelly circles her with an arm, looks nervously around,
begins leading her down the beach.
SUZIE
I wanna live at the beach someday.
KELLY
Shit.
She stops walking.
Suzie takes a few more steps then turns to
look at her.
KELLY (CONT'D)
I left the keys.
I'll get 'em.
Suzie plops down on the sand, drinks from the bottle.
She
watches Kelly fading into the darkness, mumbles something beneath
her breath, then lies on her back.
SUZIE'S POV - THE NIGHT SKY
The SOUND of CRASHING WAVES.
She rolls to one side, looking down
the beach
Murky blackness.
She tries to focus, sits up.
SUZIE
Kelly?
She stands -- wobbly -- peers down the beach.
A shape EMERGES in the blackness, moving toward her.
SUZIE (CONT'D)
Kelly?
The shape gets closer and closer, until...
Sam Lombardo steps up to loom over Suzie.
She takes a step back.
Sam puts a hand on her shoulder.
He carries something in his
other hand -- hard to see on the dark beach.
SAM
Suzie, it's okay.
It's me.
Suzie steadies herself.
A face APPEARS behind Sam -- Kelly.
SAM (CONT'D)
I was worried about you, Suzie.
I
decided we should all get together, one
more time, before we split up.
SUZIE
Are you mad at me?
SAM
No, no.
Look, I probably should have
told you a little more, about the part I
intended to play.
(beat)
We'll go through it all again tonight.
Sam takes the bottle from Suzie, looks at it.
SAM (CONT'D)
This is a celebration Suzie, not a
suicide pact.
He lifts the object in his other hand -- a champagne battle.
SAM (CONT'D)
We'll chill out first, have a drink,
watch the stars.
Suzie nods.
SAM (CONT'D)
Kelly, there's a beach blanket in the
Jeep.
Could you get it for us?
Kelly nods, starts back, looks once over her shoulder as...
Sam leads Suzie toward a huge rock formation.
SAM (CONT'D)
Let me tell you about this boat I picked
out for us...
They move OUT OF SIGHT.
Kelly continues to walk, back along the
sand toward the cars.
INSERT - A SCREAM
A sickening hollow THWACK -- an arc of blood and two teeth fall
silently on dark stone.
Kelly begins to run, stumbling through the sand to Sam's Jeep,
where she pulls a big roll of clear plastic from behind the
seats.
She stuffs it under her arm, then runs back along the
beach.
As she runs, she can hear them -- more THWACKS, MOANS --
it seems like forever
Sam APPARS before her on the sand.
The champagne bottle swings
loosely at the end of one arm.
it looks shiny now, dripping with
Suzie's blood.
Kelly goes to him.
She looks at the bottle, then throws herself
against him -- a hard kiss.
SAM
I'm sorry, Kelly.
I'm sorry it had to
happen like this.
She was losing it...
KELLY
(breathless)
There was no way.
That cop would've
gotten her to tell him... everything.
She was weak and dumb...
She kisses him again, her hands moving over his body.
Sam takes
a step back, looks into Kelly's face -- the parted lips, sultry
eyes -- as if seeing her for the first time -- a long beat -- at
which point he turns, heaving the champagne bottle as far as he
can into the black waves.
Rear hatch open -- overhead light on.
Sam and Kelly drag Suzie's body -- wrapped in the plastic -- to
the rear hatch.
As they heft her inside, the light catches --
SUZIE'S FACE
A mask of blood.
Kelly turns away in disgust.
She goes to the passenger side
door, gets in.
Sam gets in behind the wheel.
For a moment the two of them just
sit there, in the darkness, with the SOUND of the SEA, and their
own BREATHING.
Sam looks at Kelly.
She is focused on the dark Atlantic.
SAM
Are you okay?
Kelly turns to him -- an anxious face.
KELLY
(a long beat)
My mom would kill me if she knew I took
the Rover.
Kelly waits by the Rover, swatting mosquitoes.
SLOSHING SOUNDS -- a shape approaches in the dark -- Sam in
waders, muddy, tired, carrying a shovel.
Almost empty of cars.
The Range Rover cruises past Suzie's VW,
circles, comes back.
Sam jumps out, pulls on latex gloves, gets
into the VW and backs it out.
Almost dawn.
A long parking lot fronts the terminal.
Suzie's VW
arrives, parks, Sam gets out.
He goes to the waiting Range
Rover, gets in and drives away.
A THIN STREAM OF MUDDY WATER
flows beneath the gate, down the drive, toward the street.
A HAND touches the water.
PULL BACK to REVEAL the hand as that of Ray Duquette.
Ray kneels, fingers wriggling in the water, then straightens,
looking toward the house where...
On the other side of the gate, Kelly, in a tube-top and tight
shorts, washes mud from the Range Rover.
She looks up, sees...
Ray, drying his hand on a handkerchief, walking up the drive,
arriving at the wrought-iron gates.
RAY
Been four-wheelin'?
Kelly freezes -- not so cool this time.
KELLY
Get off my property.
RAY
I'm not on your property!
He grabs the wrought-iron gate -- rattles it -- harder and
harder.
Kelly backs away, frightened.
Gloria and Ray stand in front of the ramshackle wooden building,
talking to Ruby.
Walter sits nearby, sharpening a knife.
RAY
You say she didn't come back last night.
RUBY
She's been sayin' she was going to go to
L.A.
But I don't know.
I mean all her
clothes are still here.
An' she's
missin' her graduation.
(a long beat)
She should graduate.
She's a smart
girl...
Ray nods.
He makes a note in his pad.
RAY
May have been she just partied too
much... But we'll look into it.
We find
something, you'll be the first to know.
Ray turns and walks to the car.
Gloria follows.
Caps and gowns -- kids and parents on the lawn -- taking photos.
Kelly poses with Sandra.
Tom Baxter aims the camera.
BAXTER
Smile.
Kelly and Sandra force miserable smiles.
CLICK.
BAXTER (CONT'D)
That's one for the scrapbook.
Baxter moves away, greets Nicole and her parents.
Kelly puts some room between her and Sandra.
KELLY
You didn't have to fly back -- from --
wherever, for me...
SANDRA
I'm here to congratulate my friends and
their children.
I'm leaving again
tonight.
KELLY
Don't bother.
I'm taking a trip.
SANDRA
Where, the mall?
KELLY
A friend of mine bought a boat.
Sandra shakes her head, walks off.
Kelly turns away, freezes, as she catches sight of --
Ray talking with Jimmy.
Ray and Jimmy walk along the sand, moving in the direction of the
big rocks.
Jimmy wears sagger shorts, a surfer T-shirt.
Ray
wears a suit.
He carries the coat over his shoulder.
JIMMY
It's those rocks, up there.
RAY
You and Suzie used to come out here
together?
JIMMY
Yeah, sometimes.
Lots of the kids hang
out here.
(beat)
You really think something bad happened
to Suzie?
RAY
(ignoring the question)
Lombardo ever come out here?
Jimmy looks at him, surprised, sees that Ray is serious.
Still,
the idea generates a laugh.
RAY (CONT'D)
I say something funny?
JIMMY
No.
But I mean... just the idea that
Mr. Lombardo would...
RAY
Way I hear it, he was pretty tight with
the kids, one of the guys...
JIMMY
Yeah, but...
He breaks off as Ray kneels over a big flat rock.
Ray brushes
away some sand, drapes the sport coat over his arm, taking
tweezers and latex gloves from the pockets.
Jimmy moves closer, curious, seeing what Ray sees.
CLOSE ON GLOVED HANDS
as tweezers pick up two teeth from a crevice in the stone.
Ray straightens, holding the teeth in the palm of his hand.
Jimmy stares at the teeth.
Ray takes a couple of bills from his pocket, hands them to Jimmy.
RAY
I'm going to be staying here, Jimmy.
You can catch a bus up there at the lot,
okay?
Jimmy looks a little sick, but he takes the money.
He starts
toward the lot.
Ray watches for a moment.
Then calls out to him.
RAY
People aren't always what they appear to
be, kid.
Remember it.
Jimmy looks at him, trying to make sense of what Ray is saying,
clearly disturbed by the implications.
But he asks no more
questions.
He turns, trudging alone back through the sand.
DISSOLVE TO:
THE TEETH go into a plastic bag.
PULL BACK TO REVEAL
Black-and-whites, county cars -- police tape across the site.
Ray, Gloria and Hunter watch as DAVE MERRITT, a forensic expert
bags the teeth.
He passes the bag to Ray, then bends to the
rocks where he begins to take a blood sample.
RAY
Lonbardo and Kelly killed her here.
Hunter and Gloria exchange a look.
GLORIA
Two kids could've gotten into a fight,
lost a couple of teeth.
RAY
Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.
GLORIA
Where's the body?
RAY
The swamp, most likely... Lombardo's a
swamp rat, knows the body will never be
found there.
But he's made a mistake.
He holds up the evidence bag containing the teeth.
GLORIA
Her grandmother said she'd been
threatening to run away.
And I found
the car at the Miami bus terminal.
RAY
You don't think Sam could've put it
there?
HUNTER
Dust it for prints.
My guess is, if
anybody murdered Suzie it was probably
that little sociopath Kelly Van Ryan.
Ray shakes his head; he turns to Dave, still working.
RAY
How soon can we get something?
DAVE
We can get blood type right away.
Dental records will take longer.
You
want DNA, that can take weeks.
Ray nods, looks out to sea.
RAY (CONT'D)
Poor dumb Suzie, she never had a chance.
GLORIA
We don't know that, Ray...
Ray turns to her -- an intense look.
RAY
Kelly's next, Gloria.
HUNTER
(ice cold)
Get off this Ray, now.
(beat)
If there is any evidence here, it's for
Homicide.
(turning to Dave)
You get an ID, you call me.
Dave nods.
Hunter stalks off toward his car.
Ray turns to
Gloria.
RAY
Will you do me one favor?
GLORIA
Ray, you heard him...
RAY
What if I'm right, Gloria?
What if I'm
right and Hunter's wrong?
(beat)
What do you do if you see a bad thing
coming?
Gloria looks toward the highway, trying to decide.
RAY (CONT'D)
Stick with me on this Gloria.
I need
you...
GLORIA
And if the teeth aren't Suzie's?
You'll
give this up?
RAY
If I'm wrong about those teeth -- it's a
promise.
Sam's Jeep -- a "FOR SALE" sign in the window -- sits in the lot.
Across the road -- Gloria sits in the white Taurus.
Ray sits in his truck, picks up his cellular, punches in a
number.
DAVE (V.O.)
(speaker)
Merritt, Forensics.
RAY
The teeth doin' any talkin'?
DAVE (V.0.)
Ray.
Stop calling.
I told you the
dental records will take time...
RAY
What about the blood?
DAVE (V.0.)
(a beat)
Could be hers.
Types match.
Could be a
lot of other people's too...
RAY
(cutting him off)
Second you get something on those teeth,
I want it
Ray hangs up without waiting for a reply.
He turns to the Van
Ryan house, an orange light slanting across its facade.
Gloria waits in her car.
She looks toward the motel.
Sam's Jeep is parked before one of the bungalows.
There is a
light on in the room.
We can SEE inside.
Gloria sighs, picks up a pair of binoculars and trains them on
the room.
ANGLE ON ROOM - GLORIA'S POV
Suitcases and boxes are stacked everywhere.
Sam, bare-chested,
in khaki slacks, moves about the room.
CLOSE ON GLORIA
watching Sam, as...
IN THE ROOM
The PHONE has begun to RING.
Sam looks at it until it stops,
then picks it up and dials a number.
Kelly answers.
KELLY (V.O.)
Hello?
SAM
Hello.
KELLY (V.O.)
God, I've been calling you.
INTERCUT - KELLY/SAM PHONE CONVERSATION
Kelly is in the guest house, pacing in front of the gun case.
KELLY
I'm really serious.
That cop, he keeps
watching me.
SAM
Duquette.
Forget him...
KELLY
I can't help it.
He gives me the
creeps... I mean why was Suzie so scared
of him?
She's not that way.
I think he
did something...
SAM
Yeah, he got her busted for
possession...
KELLY
I don't know... I think it was something
else... Suzie says the bust was
bullshit...
SAM
And you believe her?
KELLY
(a long beat -- a sigh)
I don't know.
(beat)
I want to see you...
SAM
Kelly... Relax.
Take one of your mom's
valium or something.
In another week
you get on the plane.
It's over.
We're
rich.
KELLY
But what if they find out... God, they'd
put you in the gas chamber...
Sam is about to respond, then looks out the window, sees...
ACROSS THE STREET, the white Taurus.
SAM
So if they're tapping your phone, we're
dead.
Stay in the guest house.
Skip
the graduation parties.
You'll never
see Duquette.
Okay?
I love you.
KELLY
(beat)
Okay.
I love you too.
Ray gets out of his car, presses the intercom.
SANDRA (V.O.)
(intercom)
Who is it?
RAY
(into intercom)
Detective Duquette, Ms. Van Ryan.
Let
me in.
Now.
Ray CROSSES the deck, Sandra at his heels.
RAY
Where is she?
SANDRA
Where she lives.
In the guest house.
Now will you tell me what this is about?
RAY
I'm placing your daughter under arrest.
SANDRA
You can't...
RAY
(turning, cutting her
off)
Suzie Toller is dead.
You don't want
Kelly to be next, then take my advice.
Stay out of my way.
Sandra stands near the jacuzzi, not exactly sure what to do,
watching as...
ANGLE ON GUEST HOUSE - SANDRA'S POV
Ray knocks at the French door.
It swings open.
He steps inside.
A long moment, then VOI?ES, the SOUND of things being knocked
about, BREAKING GLASS.
Sandra starts toward the house then stops at the SOUND of a
single GUNSHOT.
A SECOND GUNSHOT follows, then a THIRD.
The guest house door opens.
Ray stumbles out, his shoulder
bloody, a .357 in his hand.
FADE TO:
VIDEOTAPE - RAY'S STATEMENT
We SEE him from the waist up -- a white T-shirt, his shoulder
bandaged, his arm in a sling.
There are red scratch marks on his
face.
His eyes look blankly into the camera.
RAY
I fucked up.
I lost control of the
situation, the one thing they train you
for... God, what did I do?
HUNTER (0.S.)
Just tell us what happened.
RAY
I told Kelly Van Ryan she was under
arrest for conspiracy and murder.
I did
her rights.
INTERCUT --
Perfect crescent of sand.
A man in white shorts reclines in a
beach chair, beneath a gaily-colored umbrella, sipping a drink.
VIDEOTAPE - RAY
RAY
Kelly went crazy, started screaming.
I
grabbed her, put her on the floor.
Sam, in white shorts, looking good, watches a beautiful island
girl in a thong bikini frolic in the surf.
She seems to sense Sam watching, turns toward the beach.
Her
eyes meet Sam's.
She breaks into a beautiful smile.
VIDEOTAPE - RAY
HUNTER (O.S.)
She bit you?
RAY
Bit, scratched.
But I had her pinned.
She calmed down.
I was going to cuff
her... She said she thought she was
going to be sick.
She asked to use the
bathroom.
Sam and the island girl sit at an outdoor table.
The girl wears
a short, terry cloth robe, Sam the white shorts and a flowered
shirt.
They sip drinks.
Their eyes meet.
Their fingers touch.
VIDEOTAPE - RAY
RAY
I told her I was coming with her.
She
nodded, like she understood.
We stood
up together.
HUNTER (O.S.)
You didn't cuff her?
RAY
She looked shaky, but lucid.
I thought,
I would just go with her, stand at the
door...
(shaking his head)
I think I looked away.
A split second.
Then, bingo.
Just like that.
She puts
a knee into my groin.
(beat)
There was this coffee table between us
and the wall.
She got one foot on that
thing and launched herself at the gun
case.
Thing had a glass door.
I could
hear it breaking.
(beat)
I didn't go down, but she slowed me up,
just enough.
Before I could get to her,
she'd turned on me with this small
caliber handgun.
I yelled at her to put
it down.
She got off a shot.
I took it
in the shoulder.
I... I had no choice.
I returned fire.
Two rounds, I think.
In the chest.
Brilliant sun on turquoise water.
A few boats anchored in a
lagoon.
A quiet place.
Heading out -- a forty-foot sloop, Sam at the helm.
Gloria stands among a considerable number of mourners.
She is
just back from Sandra and Tom Baxter, who, in turn, are just back
from the open grave.
As Gloria watches, Sandra looks off to the side, where something
catches her eye.
Gloria sees her start, then follows her gaze.
ANGLE ON CEMETERY - GLORIA'S POV
On a rise some fifty yards from the Van Ryan plot, two people
stand near an old oak -- Ruby and Walter.
When Gloria looks back at Sandra, it seems to her as if the woman
has slumped against Tom Baxter, who now stares at the two people
on the rise as if, by doing so with sufficient intensity, he
might make them disappear.
Gloria turns to the grave site, her eye lingers on the open
grave, then moves to the huge marker which dominates the Van Ryan
family plot and, in fact, the entire scene.
ANGLE CN MARKER
The angel Gabriel, trumpet in hand, carved in relief upon a huge
obelisk of black marble.
Beneath the angel is a carved scroll
and upon it the words:
"I AM THE RESURRECTION AND THE LIFE," and below that:
"WILLIAM
TECUMSEH VAN RYAN.
MAY HE REST IN PEACE."
DISSOLVE TO:
Sam Lombardo walks along a moonlit lagoon, headed toward a lone
bungalow.
The bungalow is simple, picturesque -- whitewashed walls, a
thatched roof.
A patio opens onto the beach.
As Sam steps in off the sand, he sees something and stops short.
Wet spots lead toward the bungalow.
Sam listens.
Everything is quiet.
Sam and Ray work on the deck of Sam's sloop, stowing gear,
loading supplies.
The boat's mast shines in the sunlight before a brilliant sky.
Palms sway.
The men work in silence.
Gloria drives up in the white Taurus.
She parks before the
ramshackle old building and the gator pen.
Walter is in the pen.
Ruby stands just outside of it.
She looks
toward the road as Gloria gets out, then back to the pen.
Gloria comes down the bank to stand beside Ruby.
She's just in
time to see the huge old reptile raise itself, hissing, on its
front legs, jaws sprung wide.
The women watch as Walter sticks
his arm into the gator's mouth.
RUBY
Gator can't see what's in front of it
for shit.
They see out the sides.
(beat)
That one don't even know Walter's arm's
in his mouth.
GLORIA
What if something distracts it and it
snaps anyway?
RUBY
Then I guess Walter can kiss that arm of
his goodbye.
(loud enough for Walter
to hear)
He don't use it for no good deeds
anyway.
Walter looks at the ladies, picks up the stick and sweeps it
between the gaping jaws, which snap in its wake.
RUBY (CONT'D)
You come all the way out here to watch
Walter?
GLORIA
I was wondering if I could ask you a few
questions.
RUBY
About Suzie?
GLORIA
Actually, I was wondering if I might ask
you about Ray Duquette.
RUBY
(a long beat)
He used to come around here.
He had a
thing going with one of the girls over
at the Glades.
Ruby nods toward the motel, a bitter smile on her face.
RUBY (CONT'D)
Got sort of hung up on her, from what
hear.
GLORIA
She still work there?
RUBY
No.
Not after that night.
(a long beat)
I don't know what happened.
Maybe he
caught her with some john...
All I know is, the next morning the girl
was gone and there was a dead boy...
Indian kid named Davy.
Used to live
down the road there in a wrecked car.
Him and Suzie were at the Glades that
night.
(beat)
It was right after that, Ray got Suzie
busted and sent her away.
That's what
there is to say about Ray Duquette.
GLORIA
Was there ever any kind of
investigation...
Ruby cuts her off with a short laugh.
RUBY
Duquette always claimed the kid was
dusted, came after him with a knife.
But it was Jack's Fish Camp... This
could be the moon for all most people
care.
(a long beat)
Wasn't supposed to be like that though.
This place was supposed to be something
once.
There were going to be roads and
houses.
There was going to be a town.
They were going to call it Salt Creek.
From the surface of the sea -- the emerald island in the
distance.
The bow of the sloop comes INTO FRAME.
On board -- Sam stands in the cockpit, at the helm.
Ray lounges
on the deck.
The boat sails easily before the wind.
SAM
Ray... you see that winch by your head?
Take a couple of turns on it for me,
she's luffing.
Ray cranes his neck to look at the winch.
RAY
You mean this thing?
SAM
Yes, we call it a winch.
(pointing at pieces of
the rigging)
And these are shrouds, and these are
stays.
RAY
I thought this was supposed to be a
vacation.
Why didn't you buy a nice big
power boat?
SAM
Come on, man.
I'll make a sailor out of
you yet.
RAY
Yeah, or get me drowned.
Ray kneels.
He begins to tighten the winch.
Sam watches him for a moment, then reaches around behind his back
to unhook the short line which holds the boom.
The mainsail catches wind, swinging the boom in a wide arc,
directly at Ray.
Ray looks up, sees it coming just in time to catch it on his arm.
The blow is enough to send him sprawling through the lifelines,
where he just manages to grab one of the nylon cords.
Sam ducks as the boon continues to swing erratically above the
deck, watching as Ray hauls himself on board.
The boat no longer driven by the wind, bobs up and down on a
small ground swell.
The two men face each other.
SAM
Jesus, man... You okay?
RAY
That how you planned it?
You take cut
Suzie, get me to hang it on Kelly, then
dump me in the ocean...
SAM
Come off it, man... It was an accident.
Ray nods, then reaches down, pulls off the winch handle and
starts with it toward Sam.
Sam looks around.
He jerks open a storage compartment.
A
diver's weight belt tumbles out.
Sam grabs it, swings it over
his head in circles, letting the weight pick up momentum,
preparing to throw.
Ray crouches, still brandishing the winch handle.
The boom
sweeps the deck.
Sam throws the belt.
Ray grabs a shroud, dances out of the way, then steadies himself,
a mean grin spreading across his face.
There's no tine for Sam to look for anything else.
Ray moves quickly across the deck -- a menacing sight -- tall,
well-muscled, the handle gleaming in his hand.
Sam pulls himself out of the cockpit.
Ray jumps in.
But that's
as far as he gets.
WHOOSH -- A spear pierces Ray's thigh.
He screams, goes down,
the handle skittering across the deck.
Ray follows it with his eyes, reaching out, then freezing as he
sees something else.
He draws in his hand as if bitten.
RAY
You... You're...
He scuttles backward, pulling himself onto the deck, clutching at
his leg which squirts blood as if an artery has been severed.
But his eyes never leave the hatchway leading belowdecks.
RAY (CONT'D)
You're dead... for godsake...
The boat heels over.
The spear in Ray's thigh bangs against the
edge of the cockpit.
He grimaces in pain as...
Suzie Toller steps up from belowdecks.
She's wearing a bikini
and showing a nice tan.
She's carrying Sam's new spear gun, a
fresh spear at the ready.
SUZIE
Rumors of my demise have been greatly
exaggerated.
(to Sam)
Nice move.
Good thing I was here to
save your incompetent ass.
Sam secures the boom.
Ray stares at Suzie, his face twisted with
some combination of pain, rage and fear.
RAY
You... I should've killed you myself.
should never have left it up to him...
SUZIE
Shoulda, coulda, woulda...
(to Sam)
Get him in the water.
San starts for Ray.
RAY
Sam, for Christ's sake...
Sam's feet slide in the bloody smear.
He stops.
Ray clings to a safety line.
SAM
I can't.
WHOOSH -- A second spear penetrates Ray's shoulder.
He loses his
grip.
The boat heels over, dumping Ray into the water.
Suzie puts down her spear gun.
She goes to a storage locker,
takes out a bait bucket.
She steps up on the deck.
Ray is floating not far from the boat, the water going red around
him.
He calls out...
RAY
Sam, for godsake.
SUZIE
Hey, Ray.
Guess whose name is on the
numbered bank account besides yours and
Sam's?
She raises the bucket, heaves bloody chum into the water.
SUZIE (CONT'D)
I like these joint survivorship
accounts.
Something unfortunate happens
to one of the signatories, the others
don't have to worry.
Are you worrying,
Ray?
She heaves more chum -- a big red slurp across Ray's face.
Ray gasps, goes under, thrashing around in the red slick.
SUZIE (CONT'D)
Men, use 'em abuse 'em lose 'em.
INSERT - SHARKS
from underwater, in a frenzy, rip a human body into a bloody
cloud.
Suzie cones up from below with a champagne bottle and glasses,
already filled.
SUZIE
Feeling better?
Sam gazes out to sea.
SAM
That was about as grim as it gets.
SUZIE
The guy was history when he killed
Kelly.
You knew that.
SAM
But then you knew what he was like all
along... Maybe his killing Kelly was a
thing you had counted on...
SUZIE
But then it is better this way, don't
you think?
No loose ends.
Sam just looks at her.
SUZIE (CONT'D)
What?
SAM
That was the same thing Ray said.
Suzie smiles -- showing the big gap where her two front teeth
used to be.
SUZIE
Poor Ray.
(a beat)
Come on Sam, we did it.
We put the
screws to the Van Ryans.
We won.
She hands a glass to Sam, takes the other.
He puts it to his
lips, suddenly hesitates, thinks, sniffs the glass.
A moment.
Suzie shakes her head.
SUZIE (CONT'D)
Talk about paranoid.
Now are you gonna
teach me to sail this big old boat or
not?
Sam downs his drink.
SAM
Okay.
Grab that winch there.
Suzie gives him a pouty look.
SAM (CONT'D)
What's wrong?
SUZIE
Fuck the winch.
I wanna drive.
Sam sighs.
SAM
Okay.
Come here and take the helm.
I'll get the winch.
Suzie gives him her best, gap-toothed smile, then comes forward
to take the gleaming chrome wheel, as Sam scrambles up on deck,
kneeling where Ray had kneeled before him to set the jib.
Suzie watches -- a long beat, then, slowly reaches behind her,
unhooking the line which holds the boom...
ANGLE ON BOOM
sweeping the deck -- coming right at us, blotting out the sky.
Gloria sits on Suzie's bed, books spread out around her.
Ruby
stands beside her.
RUBY
You asked if Suzie knew about the Salt
Creek land deal?
Girl read every book
she could find on it, the Van Ryans too.
Ruby takes a photo album from among the books, opens it, tosses a
photograph on the bed.
It is one we have seen before.
ANGLE ON PHOTO
A stately old gentleman in a three-piece suit.
White hair, a
white handlebar mustache.
A derby on his knee, a walking stick
at his side.
He stares out at the world from a high-backed
wicker chair, flanked by potted palms and two small terriers.
Across the bottom of the picture is the name -- "WILLIAM TECUMSEH
VAN RYAN."
And beside that, in another hand -- "Dear old Dad."
RUBY
Wasn't enough Van Ryan had to destroy
the people who invested here.
He got to
be old, he and his rich cronies would
come down here, hunt and whore, act like
assholes.
One trip he showed up with
this young girl he'd picked up
somewhere, gotten her pregnant then
dumped her in the swamp.
(indicating the photo)
That came with her.
GLORIA
And the child...
RUBY
She had it, before she drank herself to
death.
Wasn't exactly a love child...
GLORIA
Suzie.
(beat)
Then you're not her grandmother...
RUBY
Raised her like she was, but no,
Walter's my only child.
(beat)
He was a good boy, till the army took
him.
Gloria looks once more at the old photograph.
GLORIA
So Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan were half-
sisters.
RUBY
And the other girl, Kelly.
Suzie's
niece.
Gloria stands, a little weary.
Ruby walks her from the room.
GLORIA
Thank you for talking to me, Ruby.
I am
sorry about Suzie, she...
They have gotten to the main room and Gloria stops short,
noticing for the first time that the beat-up old black-and-white
TV has been replaced by a high-tech, giant-screen television.
RUBY
You okay?
GLORIA
I'm fine.
Nice TV.
The old lady nods, walks her outside.
The dusty road, the little dock, the gator pen.
RUBY
There's an old saying from the
Everglades -- virtue may be missed but
sin can't hide.
(a long beat)
Folks pay in the end.
Gloria nods.
She is distracted by a movement in the gator pen.
CLOSE ON PEN
For a moment there is nothing more than a few ripples across the
surface of the pond which lies inside the pen, then, slowly, the
GATOR'S EYES -- cold, reptilian, unblinking, rising up to gaze
across the oily waters.
HARD CUT TO:
BLACK.
CREDITS...
for about ten seconds, enough to fool the audience, then...
INTERCUT - LIKE OUTTAKES...
... PIECES OF SCENES WE COULDN'T SEE, or SCENES WE DIDN'T SEE AT
ALL, in reverse chronological order.
A Jeep and a truck parked in the mud.
Sam and Ray meet under
heavy, moss-draped cypress.
Sam hands Ray a plastic bag -- the
teeth.
SAM
You know the place I'm talking about --
the big rocks?
BLACK -- MORE CREDITS -- then
SAM & SUZIE
behind the big rocks.
He's got vise-grip pliers jammed in her
mouth.
Suzie moans, for real.
He loosens his grip.
SUZIE
You've got the pressure too tight.
You'll crush the fucking evidence.
Sam takes a breath, prepares to try again.
Suzie pops a couple
of pills with gulps of wine.
Sam goes to it once more.
BLACK -- MORE CREDITS -- then
Suzie's VW is parked across the street, in the shadows of tall
trees.
She and Sam sit inside, watching as...
Ray Duquette EXITS a bungalow, a sport coat over his arm.
He
heads for Jim's Recovery Room.
In another moment, a young hooker
in a leather miniskirt walks out of the same bungalow.
SUZIE
Seems to like some of the same places
you do.
Funny you never met.
SAM
Yeah, real funny.
You're wrong about
this, I could get busted on the spot.
SUZIE
Trust me, the guy's dirty.
He'll like
it.
Especially the part about offing
me.
(beat)
Now get out of here.
Go make yourself a
new friend.
Gloria stands beneath the jawbones, looking toward the channel as
the shadows lengthen across the dirt road.
ANGLE ON CHANNEL
Walter hangs a "FOR SALE" sign on a small, shabby sloop.
Gloria CROSSES the road.
GLORIA
Selling your boat?
Walter shoots her a look.
WALTER
This was Suzie's boat.
Guess she won't
be needin' it.
GLORIA
I wouldn't have guessed Suzie was a
sailor.
Walter finishes with the sign.
WALTER
Old lady had her tested once.
They said
her IQ was way up there, round two
hundred or some such shit.
(beat)
That girl could do just about anything,
she put her mind to it.
Gloria has nothing to say.
She stares at the little sloop
bobbing in the muddy water of the swamp.
A head bobs among the groundswells.
CLOSE - SAM LOMBARDO
sucking wind through a smashed face, struggling to stay afloat,
as...
... in the distance, the sloop races toward a far horizon.
ANGLE ON SLOOP - HELICOPTER SHOT
Suzie, at the helm, looking good, face to the wind.
