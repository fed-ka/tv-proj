A rabbit hops across rough terrain.
Three trucks from Chemical Technologies carry barrels of
toxic waste. They pass a sign: PROSPERITY, NEVADA, POP
454.
The rabbit stops at the edge of the road. The first
truck speeds past. Then the second. The rabbit crosses
the highway in front of the third.
The truck slews crazily.
Missing the bunny by a whisker.
2.
The rim of a wheel tags the curb. One of those toxic
waste barrels falls out of the back and plunges to the
water below.
A biohazard warning label is legible as the barrel slips
beneath the surface. Glowing toxic waste seeps from a
gash in its side. Spreading through the pool like neon
ink.
The ditch is littered with garbage. The DRONE of
INSECTS. No visible traces of toxic waste. A butterfly
net sweeps through the air to capture an oversized
horsefly.
JOSHUA TAFT (70s), scrutinizes the bug. This old codger
is more comfortable studying bugs than socializing with
people.
JOSHUA
Hey, Mike.
Check this one out.
MIKE PALMER (12) steps over for a look.
Puberty hit hard
and fast for this bright, little nerd.
MIKE
He's huge!
JOSHUA
They've been like this all week.
Must be something extra tasty in
the water.
MIKE
Like what?
JOSHUA
Dead coyote. Snake maybe. Back
in the 'Nam we'd eat python with a
dash of habanero sauce. Mighty
satisfying.
(CONTINUED)
3.
CONTINUED:
MIKE
You ate snake?
JOSHUA
When you're thirty klicks out from
the nearest firebase. Humpin'
through the wake-up with your
finger on the trigger. Charlie
doesn't give you time to stop for
cutlet.
As Mike skims his own net over the water, he glimpses a
familiar barrel at the bottom of the pool. The brightly-
colored biohazard warning label is clearly visible.
Two bicycles are parked outside a cabin in the middle of
nowhere.
The entrance to a mine shaft protrudes from a hillside.
A pickup truck is parked nearby. The faded logo on the
door reads: McCORMICK AND SON MINING COMPANY,
PROSPERITY, NV.
A police car drives with a bicycle hanging out of the
trunk.
The ROAR of two off-road MOTORCYCLES tearing up the
desert.
BRET HALE (18) leads the way. A Kid Rock-punk with good
looks and FU attitude. Seated behind him is ASHLEY
PALMER (16). This milk-fed desert honey is a wannabe
Britney Spears. LARRY (17) is the wiseacre on the other
bike.
BRET
Hang on, babydoll!
(CONTINUED)
9.
CONTINUED:
They GUN their BIKES onto the highway. Slalom the yellow
lines. Wheelie for days. Ashley peeks over Bret's
shoulder at a police car coming at them in the opposite
lane.
ASHLEY
Oh shit.
The police car does an impressive bootlegger 180. Lights
ablaze. SIREN WAILING. The bikes pull over to the
shoulder.
The motorcycles stop with the cop car behind.
Sam's
voice barks over the PA.
SAM (V.O.)
Party's over, gentlemen.
Off the
bikes.
Sam exits the car and approaches.
The bikers dismount.
BRET
There is something very sexy about
an older woman in uniform.
LARRY
Her nine-millimeter gives me a
stiffy.
ASHLEY
Don't antagonize her, you guys.
SAM
I told you not to act like
kamikazes. Especially with Ashley
riding behind. That is
unacceptable, Bret.
(CONTINUED)
10.
CONTINUED:
BRET
I could always ride her from
behind.
Larry snickers.
Sam steels her rage.
SAM
You just bought yourself a
reckless.
Sam begins to write up the ticket.
ASHLEY
Can't you give 'em a break?
SAM
Get in the car, Ashley.
Now.
ASHLEY
But, Mom!
Sam shoots his daughter an intimidating glance.
BRET
No sweat, babydoll.
We'll hook up
later.
SAM
(threatening)
Over my dead body.
Sam hands Bret the ticket.
BRET
Larry, do we know anybody at City
Hall who can mark this go away?
(CONTINUED)
11.
CONTINUED:
LARRY
Your Dad is the Mayor.
BRET
Oh, yeah.
(to Sam)
He signs your paycheck.
SAM
The next time you put my
daughter's life in danger, I'll
show you exactly how little that
means to me.
Bret and Larry feel her resolve.
BRET
Relax, bee-otch. It's all good.
The punks remount their bikes.
SAM
I want both wheels on the ground.
The punks REV their BIKES and defiantly wheelie toward
town.
Chris's pickup approaches... The entire town is not much
bigger than a few football fields. The kind of place
where everybody has known each other since childhood.
Some buildings date back to the 1880's gold rush.
HARLAN (V.O.)
Isn't this just your latest get-
rich quick scheme?
At one end is the Prosperity Mall. A huge windowless
rectangle in the sand. Permanent signs tout the many
outlet stores inside: Victoria's Secret, Home and Garden
Supplies, Sport Chalet, etc. Hand-painted signs reveal:
"GOING OUT OF BUSINESS SALE. EVERYTHING MUST GO. FINAL
CLOSE OUT." On the roof of the mall is a very tall radio
antenna.
HARLAN (V.O.)
Your mall has more employees than
customers.
BEVERLY (40's) is tending to her garden as she listens to
a transistor radio.
HARLAN (V.O.)
And your ostrich ranch?
WADE (V.O.)
If the government subsidies hadn't
dried up, I'd still be rolling in
cash.
An airstream at the far end of town. Signs identify it
as: "FREEDOM RADIO." A brand new humvee is parked out
front.
Practically the entire town has gathered outside. Sam
drags Chris through the door. Wade and Harlan are close
behind.
CHRIS
Did you hear what he said?
SAM
I heard.
WADE
I want him locked up!
SAM
Let's all calm down.
Wade tries to take advantage of the assembled audience.
WADE
We have no economy! People are
barely scraping by! And now we've
been offered the deal of a
lifetime. You don't have the
right to stand in our way!
CHRIS
Those mines are full of gas. One
spark in the wrong place could
blow this entire valley sky high.
Do you really want to load that
gun with toxic waste?
WADE
Chem-Tech did seismic analysis,
vapor checks, groundwater reads,
soil sampling. They found
isolated methane pockets, but no
benzene or hydrogen sulfide.
(CONTINUED)
19.
CONTINUED:
CHRIS
How could they run tests? I
didn't give them permission to go
into the mines.
Wade retreats toward his shiny new Hummer.
CHRIS
I asked you a question, you greedy
son of a bitch!
WADE
I'm greedy?! You're the one
keeping us down so you can search
for gold!
Chris tries to go after Wade.
Sam holds him back.
SAM
Don't take another step.
Chris stares at her.
CHRIS
You're taking his side?
SAM
I'm trying to keep the peace.
WADE
You're crazy!
Just like your
father!
Wade drives off in his humvee.
The crowd begins to
disperse.
CHRIS
(sotto)
He wasn't crazy.
SAM
It's okay.
Chris heads off to his truck. Sam watches him go. Her
eyes drifting down his body. Ashley steps up beside her
mom.
ASHLEY
Maybe you're not gay after all.
SAM
What are you talking about?
(CONTINUED)
20.
CONTINUED:
ASHLEY
You can't take your eyes off his
butt.
SAM
Where did you learn that it's okay
to talk to me like this?
ASHLEY
Relax, Mom. He's hot for an old
guy. I can admit it. Why can't
you?
Sam watches Chris get into his truck. He gives her one
last look before pulling out. Sam smiles with her
daughter.
The sun rises.
The town slowly comes to life.
HARLAN (V.O.)
Good morning, Prosperity, Nevada.
It's another beautiful day on the
frontier.
Locals prepare their stores for business.
23.
SCREAMS and the sounds of BREAKING GLASS come from
within.
Ranch style.
Cop car in front.
Chris's pickup cruises
by.
Mike hops off his bike before it stops moving. Letting
it crash in the dirt. He enters the mall through glass
doors.
Beverly uncoils a hose, cranks a spigot. She sprays her
vegetable garden with water. After a beat, a solid
object is coughed up through the hose.
Beverly continues watering. Two more unidentified
objects are spewed from the hose. She reacts by cranking
the spigot on full. The water sprays harder. Then
inexplicably stops.
Beverly checks the spigot. She looks into the opening of
the hose. Puts it to her ear and listens. Sniffs. Now
she puts the end of the hose in her mouth and sucks
deeply, trying to siphon away the blockage.
Beverly removes the hose. A FAINT RUMBLING sound. She
puts it back in her mouth and sucks. A solid object
comes through the hose and into her mouth. Then another.
And another. A dozen things pump through the hose and
into her mouth.
Beverly yanks it out. Water spews from her mouth and out
of the hose. Apparently the blockage has cleared.
Beverly falls to her knees. Hunching forward. She
vomits forth a stomach full of water... and small
spiders. Mouth agape. Eyes wide in horror. She watches
them scurry into the garden. Beverly tries to scream...
but can only retch.
31.
Mike Palmer rides his bike through a puddle of water. He
sees Beverly throwing up in her vegetable garden. Mike
it thoroughly grossed out.
Mike rides his bike into Joshua's front yard.
He
dismounts before the BIKE stops. It CRASHES.
Mike heads
inside.
Mike comes out and notices hundreds of coin-sized
footprints. He follows these tracks to a cluster of
wooden barricades labeled: "McCORMICK AND SONS MINING
COMPANY." Mike peers toward a vertical mine shaft behind
the barriers.
(CONTINUED)
32.
CONTINUED:
MIKE
(into PDA)
Animal tracks. Definitely too big
to be spiders. Could be rats.
Mike slips past the barricades. Following the tracks to
the edge of the abyss. He can't see anything. It's too
dark.
Mike turns away and returns to the yard.
Never
realizing...
Several feet down the shaft. Hidden under a rock... the
shriveled and desiccated corpse of Joshua Taft. It hangs
from the side of the shaft in thick sticky webbing.
Grisly.
Suddenly the corpse is tugged loose and dragged deeper
into the shaft by some unseen creature.
Chris's pickup is parked outside another mine shaft.
Chris runs out the mouth of the tunnel. The rat stampede
is on his tail. He leaps into the back of his pickup.
The manic rodents continue off into the desert.
Chris looks back toward the gaping mouth of the tunnel.
CHRIS
What am I, the Pied Piper...
33.
Mike rides his bike. Floyd the barber stands out front
chatting with an elderly couple. They hold a dog's leash
in their hand.
FLOYD
I'm sorry.
I haven't seen him.
Mike rides on. He notices a guy taping a flyer to a lamp
post. Mike glances over. It's a sign for a missing dog.
Mike arrives at the local police station. Several cars
are parked out front. The door is ajar. Locals are
crowded inside. Mike lets his bike crash as he enters.
Prosperity is clearly visible just a mile away. The
police car drives down a long road lined with fences.
35.
Wade's new Hummer is in the driveway. A CATTLE DOG BARKS
as Wade leads Sam and Mike around the side of the house.
WADE
Came out to feed my birds this
morning.
SAM
Coyotes?
WADE
Hell no!
The trio steps to the fence.
Only three mangy ostriches
are there to greet them.
WADE
My flock had fifty birds! Where'd
they go, dammit! Who the hell
steals fifty birds that can't even
fly!?
SAM
All this happened last night?
WADE
I guess.
And we didn't hear a
thing.
Sam gestures toward the BARKING DOG.
SAM
What about him?
WADE
Not a peep.
Mike notices some ostrich feathers on the ground.
He
heads over for a closer look.
The DOG watches his progress.
BARKING excitedly.
Sam talks to Wade.
SAM
How's the ostrich business?
WADE
Not so good lately.
SAM
You've got that new Hummer. You
must be makin' enough to pay for
it.
(CONTINUED)
36.
CONTINUED:
WADE
(annoyed)
You like it? I'll take you for a
ride.
SAM
These birds are insured.
Right?
WADE
I didn't kill my birds, Sam.
Is
that what you think?
Mike looks back to see his mom confronting Wade.
WADE
(in the distance)
... reject... absolutely not...
Mike scrutinizes what appear to be more of those tracks
that he found at Joshua's. But this time they are
larger:
MIKE
(into PDA)
I've found more tracks.
Even
larger now.
Mike follows the trail toward another mine entrance.
This one is plugged with concrete. The tracks don't go
there. They stop at what appears to be a normal patch of
ground. Several ostrich feathers are scattered nearby.
Mike takes a closer
look. Something doesn't seem right.
An odd demarcation
in the soil. His fingers trace the
edge of a thin film
of material. It is a lid of sorts.
A sheath of sticky
webbing coated with dirt. Mike is
able to lift it.
Mike peers into a deep dark burrow three feet wide.
Mike squints into the burrow but can't see anything.
37.
Mike is oblivious as he peers into the dark.
The BARKING CATTLE DOG SNAPS its TETHER and charges Mike.
Sam and Wade see this and run after it.
Mike doesn't see the dog.
He's too busy looking in the
hole.
Mike senses something approaching in the darkness.
Suddenly he's grabbed from behind. Sam drags him away as
CLYDE the cattle dog continues BARKING.
WADE
(to Clyde)
Now you're on the job?! What the
hell were you doin' last night?!
SAM
Come on, Mike.
Let's hit it.
Sam leads her son toward the house.
Mike glances back.
Mike and Sam are in the cop car.
Wade is at Sam's
window.
WADE
I need to know what happened to my
birds!
(CONTINUED)
38.
CONTINUED:
SAM
If I find anything I'll let you
know.
(a beat)
So you can fill out that insurance
form.
Sam drives down the driveway. Wade takes off his hat and
wipes his brow. He watches Clyde run parallel to the
accelerating police car.
CLYDE runs
next to the car. Suddenly he disappears
underground
with a YELP. Only still frame on a DVD
player will
capture the trapdoor spider's lunge from a
camouflaged
den. The dog's empty collar rolls to a stop
in a cloud
of dust.
Bret twitches on the ground.
BRET
My balls? Ahh! My balls!
(looks down)
I pissed myself?! Damn, bee-otch!
(CONTINUED)
42.
CONTINUED:
Ashley watches from the truck.
ASHLEY
I told you to back off!
Ashley closes the door of the truck and rolls up the
windows.
Bret is dazed as he gets to his feet. Then his eyes
rack-focus to a nearby dune. A Rottweiler-sized jumping
spider stands atop it. Two large eyes surrounded by six
smaller orbs. Orange and black designs on its abdomen.
Wiry hair. Dagger-sized fangs. Bret can't quite believe
what he sees.
Ashley STARTS the TRUCK.
This snaps Bret back to
reality.
BRET
Ashley, wait!
ASHLEY
Screw you, Bret. I'm going home.
Bret sees the spider leisurely coming down off the dune.
He runs over to the door of the pickup and tries to open
it.
BRET
Please!
Open the door!
I'm
sorry!
ASHLEY
I can't believe my mom was right
about you. Do you know how
embarrassing that is?
Ashley starts to pull away.
Bret keeps banging on the
glass.
BRET
Open the door, baby!
I love you!
I want to marry you!
Have my
children! Please!
Ashley flips him the bird and BURNS RUBBER. As the truck
moves out of the way, Bret finds himself staring at
several more jumping spiders that are methodically
approaching. Bret sprints around to the other side of
the truck stop.
43.
Bret runs from behind the building.
Larry Witzer and a
bunch of other kids see him coming.
LARRY
Dude, did you piss in your pants?
RANDY
Ha-ha!
Bret pissed his pants!
All the kids start laughing and pointing at Bret.
None
of them see the approaching jumping spiders.
BRET
Get out of here! They're coming!
RANDY
The only one coming is you, dude.
Larry and Randy high-five. A jumping spider lands on
Randy's back, piercing him with its fangs, throwing him
to the ground. Randy screams. The kids have a front-row
seat as the spider's pincers mash their buddy into an
edible pulp.
Bret leaps onto his MOTORCYCLE and FIRES it UP. Several
more jumping spiders bound across the parking lot.
BRET
Ride!
The kids scramble, leaping onto their bikes. One rider
is picked off by a spider. The others kick up rooster
tails as they accelerate away. The spiders chase them
into the dunes.
A wasteland on the outskirts of town. The sandy waves
are "surfed" by the noisy MOTORCYCLES. The jumping
spiders keep after them, leaping a dozen feet in a single
bound.
A biker is ripped off a motorcycle.
The BIKE CRASHES.
Larry ends up with a jumper on his bike. Another biker
tries to kick it off, managing to knock the critter into
the motorcycle's spokes. The spider gets munched. But
then the courageous biker crashes and is set upon by a
hungry jumper.
Larry continues riding. But a spider lands on his back
and sinks fangs into his spine. Larry yells bloody
murder.
(CONTINUED)
44.
CONTINUED:
Bret sees Larry go down in a cloud of gore and sand.
Bret is the only human left. A jumper comes after him in
mid-air. Bret does an X-Games style rocket air, kicking
backward with booted legs. He knocks the spider away and
keeps on riding.
Three familiar trucks cruise down the highway.
This time
they are devoid of any toxic waste cargo.
The TRUCK jack-knifes into a line of telephone poles.
Knocking them over and rolling multiple times before
EXPLODING. Several jumping spiders are caught in the
blast. Bret Hale rides on with several more jumpers
behind.
Bret rides into a dead-end canyon with the spiders very
close behind. Bret steers for the mouth of a hillside
mine shaft.
INT HORIZONTAL MINE SHAFT - DAY
Bret speeds inside. He looks over his shoulder to check
for his pursuers, they're gone. Bret looks relieved. He
faces forward as... whack! A support beam knocks him
from his bike. The bike continues on into the tunnel
alone. From the sound of things it travels pretty far
before crashing.
Bret lies on the ground as dust settles onto his face.
He looks up at a support beam which begins to crack.
Bret moves clear just as the ceiling caves in, sealing
him in the mine.
Several locals put up more signs for missing pets.
Harlan is kibitzing with Travis. Pete and Emma console
each other over dessert. Wade sits alone at a table for
two. The attractive WAITRESS on roller-skates give him a
fresh beer.
WAITRESS
The phones went down for some
reason. Maybe that's why Bret
didn't call. Did you want to go
ahead and order?
WADE
Just give me the usual.
WAITRESS
One ostrich steak, comin' up.
Wade reacts glumly to the word "ostrich."
The museum burns. The volunteer fire department attacks
the conflagration. All the locals are there to help.
Sam's COP CAR SKIDS to a stop. Chris leaps out. Stares
at the fire for a beat. And then he charges toward the
inferno. Sam tackles him from behind. Pinning him to
the ground.
CHRIS
No!
Let me go! Gladys!
Let me
go!
The museum collapses.
Chris watches it burn to the
ground.
The fire is out. The once-proud building is now a
smoldering pile of rubble. Locals stand in small groups.
Chris wanders through the ruins as
firemen mop up. He
picks something out of the char.
The map of the mines.
Almost completely burned. Soaked
with water. He stares
at it for a heavy beat. All that
remains of his legacy.
Sam steps up.
SAM
Maybe she got out.
Sam puts a comforting hand on his shoulder.
CHRIS
(devastated)
She was cooking. The stove was
broken.
SAM
Why don't you come home with me?
We'll get you cleaned up.
Chris hesitates for a moment. And then he lets the map
fall. He walks out of the ruins with Sam.
(CONTINUED)
52.
CONTINUED:
Mike stands off to the side. He spots something near the
edge of the ruins. He goes over to pick it up. It's a
piece of arachnid exoskeleton. A spider's leg. Big.
Very big. Travis the fire chief warns him away.
TRAVIS
Get away from there, Mike!
Mike hurries clear with his prize. He puts it on the
ground, sketches the outline of a spider to fit the scale
of the leg.
MIKE
Holy God...
Mike looks around for his mom.
He sees her driving off
in the cop car with Chris.
MIKE
Mom!
Wait!
The sun hangs low in the sky.
Sam's cop car parks beside
Bret's monster truck.
Prosperity is bathed in sunset. The mine shaft entrances
are clearly visible. Like black holes of malevolent
promise.
Chris and Sam open the front door of the house.
Sam
looks one way. Chris the other.
No giant spiders lurking about. Chris and Sam continue
onto the lawn. Mike and Ashley watch from the safety of
the doorway. They listen to the comforting SOUNDS OF a
SUMMER NIGHT.
SAM
It's okay...
Mike and Ashley move out of the doorway.
Joining the
adults. They move toward the cop car.
The cop car cruises. The occupants peer out the windows.
Everything appears normal. Although no people are
visible.
Sam, Chris, and the kids move away from the cop car to
the door. They are at the far end of town. All appears
to be normal.
SAM (V.O.)
A pack of rabid coyotes is loose
in town.
Wolf spiders crawl across rooftops. Spitters scale
buildings Tarantulas lurk in the shadows. Jumpers
scuttle out of the mineshafts. Trapdoors prepare their
burrows.
Emma bursts out of the front door, screaming
hysterically. Hank is behind her with the SawzAll. A
wolf spider crawls after them from inside the house.
SAM (V.O.)
Arm yourselves with any weapons
you can find.
Hank raises the saw, overextending the power cable.
He
loses power. Drops the saw and runs for his life.
63.
A family piles into their mini-van. Oblivious to the
jumper hiding in the "way back." They close the door and
drive off.
Sam and the
others spill out of the trailer. They head
for the cop
car. As they get closer, a wolf spider
climbs onto
the car's roof and gnaws on the light bar.
Sam raises
her gun to blast it.
MIKE
Wait, Mom! The noise will attract
more of them!
CHRIS
Let's try for the mall.
Sam leads the others toward town.
Chris and Sam hang onto the panicked kids. Harlan brings
up the rear. The place is chaos. People are chased by
spiders. Dragged by spiders. Killed by spiders. Eaten
by spiders.
CHRIS
My truck's at the museum.
SAM
Your keys?
CHRIS
In my other pants.
MIKE
Look out!
The group flees a trio of goo-firing spitters.
Suddenly
a familiar mini-van races past.
HARLAN
Stop!
Take us with you!
Harlan tries to flag down the speeding ride but sees...
The van's occupants are locked in combat with a jumper.
The beast is inside their vehicle and tearing them to
pieces. The van crashes.
A group of orb weavers scurry across power lines. They
hit a transformer, shorting it out. The entire town is
suddenly plunged into darkness. Headlights. GUNFIRE.
Moonlight. Spotty illumination for the arachnids'
feeding frenzy.
65.
A dumpster. The lid rises slightly. Wade Hale peers out
from within. He lifts the lid higher, oblivious to the
wolf spider on top of it. The spider reaches down at
him.
WADE
No!
Please!
The spider is suddenly BLOWN AWAY by Sam and Chris.
Wade
climbs out of the dumpster.
WADE
Thank you!
Chris and Sam move on with the kids. Wade runs after
them. Mike looks at garbage-covered Wade.
MIKE
You stink.
WADE
(to Ashley)
Have you seen Bret?
ASHLEY
He was out at the dunes.
SAM
Go ahead.
I've got your butt.
CHRIS
What?
SAM
Your back!
I've got your back!
Chris gives Sam a funny look.
Maybe Gladys was right...
Sam leads her group down toward the mall. Other groups
of survivors do likewise. As they get closer to the mall
the groups coalesce into one large pack. We recognize
Deputy Pete. Fireman Travis. The roller-skating
waitress. Floyd. Leroy. Hank. Emma. And many other
locals.
Sam and Chris are at the front of the mob with their
kids.
(CONTINUED)
66.
CONTINUED:
Suddenly a trapdoor spider pops out of the ground. It
grabs Travis the fire chief, and pulls him under, quickly
replacing the roof of its den. TRAVIS SCREAMS
underground.
MIKE
Trapdoors!
They're all around us!
SAM
How can we spot them?
Mike consults his Cassiopeia.
MIKE
I didn't download that part!
ASHLEY
You dork!
The group wheels at the MUFFLED SOUNDS. They see
nothing. They hear another MUFFLED SCREAM, and the top
of the spider's den pops up. Travis drags himself out of
it.
TRAVIS
Help... me... please...
He is dragged back underground.
The group continues toward the mall entrance. Suddenly a
gun-toting hunter is grabbed by a trapdoor. He goes
cyclic, madly FIRING his GUN into the air as he's dragged
under.
More beasts rise out of their dens.
Reaching for the
humans.
CHRIS
Keep going!
Chris and the others flee toward the mall.
Some of them
SHOOT at the spiders as they run.
Leroy is grabbed by a trapdoor. Floyd tries to help but
the spider plunges its fangs into poor Leroy, dragging
him under.
The group clears the trapdoor minefield. But some of the
spiders have vacated their dens and are coming after
them.
67.
Chris and Sam and the kids lead just fifteen other
survivors to the glass doors. The doors are locked.
Wade pulls out a ring of fifty keys and fumbles with them
desperately.
ASHLEY
There's someone inside!
The group sees Norman the dope dealer janitor approaching
out of the gloom. He's staring at them all curiously.
NORMAN
We're closed.
Sam points her gun at him.
Norman raise his hands in
shock.
NORMAN
Wait! I have a prescription!
It's for my glaucoma!
SAM
Open this goddamn door!
NORMAN
Yes, ma'am.
Norman unlocks the door and lets the group in.
Chris and Harlan step onto the roof with their gear.
No
sign of any spiders.
(CONTINUED)
72.
CONTINUED:
Wade closes the door behind them and locks it.
Chris and
Harlan aren't happy to hear that LOCK TURN.
They sneak across the roof toward the base of the
antenna.
CHRIS
It looks clear.
Harlan starts climbing. Chris stands guard at the
bottom. Neither of them sees the horde of spiders
climbing up the side of the building toward the roof.
Harlan is high up on the antenna. He has a cell phone in
hand. It still indicates: "NO SERVICE." He keeps
climbing.
Chris sees spiders flood onto the roof.
(CONTINUED)
73.

CHRIS
We've got company!
He tries to COCK the SHOTGUN.
Ejecting a shell out the
side.
CHRIS
This always looks so easy on TV!
Chris gets it figured out just in time to BLAST an
attacking spider. He fades back toward the antenna.
SHOOTING.
Harlan checks the phone.
HARLAN
I've got a signal!
He dials 911.
Chris is surrounded by spiders.
He starts climbing up
the antenna.
CHRIS
They're coming!
Harlan is on the phone.
He hears...
OPERATOR (V.O.)
911 Emergency.
HARLAN
I'm calling from Prosperity
Nevada! We're being attacked by
giant spiders! The entire town

Chris yells up to him.
CHRIS
No!
Don't say that!
OPERATOR (V.O.)
This is Emergency Services. Not
dial-a-joke.

CLICK. The LINE GOES DEAD. Chris climbs up beside him.
He FIRES several BLASTS at the approaching spiders.
CHRIS
What happened?
HARLAN
They didn't believe me!
CHRIS
What a shock!
Try again!
The spiders are closing in as Harlan re-dials.

HARLAN
There was a massive explosion!
Everybody's dead!
OPERATOR (V.O.)
Sir, your number has been flagged
as a source of a crank call. I'm
afraid I must terminate this
conversation.
CLICK.
HARLAN
She hung up on me!
CHRIS
Climb!
Chris FIRES the SHOTGUN.
The spiders are closing in.
Harlan is at the top. Chris is a bit lower. The spiders
are still coming. Chris SHOOTS at them. His GUN RUNS
DRY. He flips it around and butt-strokes an approaching
arac.
A spider fires a web at Harlan.
Nails the poor guy.
And
drags him off the antenna.
Harlan falls off the antenna, back toward the spiders.
Chris reaches out and grabs him. Holding Harlan's hand.
CHRIS
I've got you!
Harlan makes eye-contact with Chris.
They're both about
to be killed unless...
HARLAN
Defend the human race!
CHRIS
No!
Harlan jerks away from Chris's hand. He cannonballs down
into the horde of spiders. Splattering several of the
beasts along with himself.
Chris throws the useless shotgun at an approaching arac
and climbs even higher. He pulls out his machete and
begins hacking at the guide-wires that hold the antenna
upright.
The spiders close in. Chris slices one wire. The
antenna quivers. Chris slices another wire. The antenna
shakes.
Chris dodges a spider's webline.
Several more come at
him.
CHRIS
You're going down!
Chris cuts the last wire and hikes out over the skylight.
The antenna keels over. Chris hangs tight as he drops
toward the glass.
Mike and Gladys gather at a generator just shy of the
tunnel exit. Mike tries to start the generator. It
won't catch.
MIKE
It needs gas!
GLADYS
There's a ranch!
Gladys heads over toward Wade's ranch.
Mike is at the generator as Sam and Ashley ride up on the
motorcycle.
MIKE
It needs gas!
Sam tips over the motorcycle, trying to get gas out of
the tank. It's clear this is not going to work.
ASHLEY
Hurry!
MIKE
He's coming!
ASHLEY
Hurry, Mom!
Sam has dumped some fuel into the generator.
She tries
to start it. It won't turn over.
Sam looks back to see Chris running toward her. Consuela
is on his heels. The glow of a fireball is right behind
them.
SAM
Come on!
Chris looks over his shoulder at Consuela and the flames.
SAM
Chris!
Chris makes it to Sam just ahead of the conflagration.
Sam and Chris dive out of the mine opening. A pillar of
flame shoots out behind them.
Ashley and Mike are
nearby. The town is visible just a mile away.
The spiders retreat from daylight. Scuttling back into
the buildings. Heading down into the mine shafts.
The EARTH BEGINS TO SHAKE VIOLENTLY.
ASHLEY
Earthquake!
CHRIS
No! It's a chain reaction! The
whole valley is going to blow!
MIKE
We'll never get out in time!
Gladys drives up in
Wade's humvee.
Cigar in mouth.
(CONTINUED)
94.
CONTINUED:
GLADYS
Let's get the fuck out of here!
The survivors pile into the truck as the town begins to
BLOW UP in the distance.
Chris is just about to climb aboard when... A webline
shoots out of the nearby mine shaft. Consuela lives!
The spider is charred and bloody. But she's primed for
revenge.
Chris is yanked off his feet and hauled toward her.
He
fumbles for his machete and hacks at the webline.
Cutting himself free just before getting impaled on
Consuela's fangs.
Consuela knocks away Chris's machete and lunges down at
him. Chris kicks her belly with both his feet. Consuela
begins to shudder. Jagged cracks appear in her charred
carapace. Chris kicks and tears at the failing armor.
He thinks he's harming the tarantula, but he's actually
helping it!
Mike and the others watch from the humvee.
MIKE
Oh no... she's molting!
Consuela's blistered shell cracks as she shrugs the
damaged skin away from her body. Chris is amazed to see
the spider has grown a full size larger and become
totally rejuvenated!
Consuela comes after Chris.
He defends himself with the
machete.
Shining steel makes contact with the dripping fangs.
Once again Consuela punts away the machete. She prepares
the death blow. It looks like curtains for Chris.
MIKE
Consuela!
No!
Bad!
Bad
Consuela!
The massive spider stops in shock.
Chris looks back to
see Mike has returned.
TARANTULA POV
The familiar multi-perspective spider vision.
The
tarantula seems to recognize Mike.
95.
BACK TO MIKE
He throws his Cassiopeia PDA at the spider's face...
Chris uses this moment of confusion to grab his machete
and drive it deep into the spider's unprotected
abdomen...
The tarantula screams.
Chris leaps up and runs, scooping up Mike.
They dive
into the back of the humvee.
Consuela tries to follow but is mortally wounded. She
collapses in the dust. The TOWN EXPLODES in the b.g.
The earth itself begins to collapse.
The humvee reaches open road. The survivors watch out
the back as Prosperity disappears into a massive
sinkhole.
The group sits in a long beat of abject shock. And then
Chris looks down to see his tight pants have finally
ripped.
CHRIS
I really need some pants that fit.
The group smiles.
Happy to be alive.
MIKE
Look out!
Everyone looks to the road ahead. A familiar bunny
rabbit hops across the highway. Gladys HONKS and swerves
to avoid it.
The bunny gets clear as the humvee drives away toward
safety.
(CONTINUED)
96.
CONTINUED:
The rabbit continues its trek for a moment, and then is
grabbed by a large trap-door spider.
FADE OUT.
THE END?
