                                    TOM JONES 
                                      Oh...Oooo! 
 
  TOM. Dressed to sweat. Checking his surroundings. 
 
                              TOM JONES (CONT D) 
                                Oh Baby! Yeah... 
 
  Two stern-looking SUITS stride towards him. 
 
                              TOM JONES (CONT D) 
                                    Ooo yeah... 
 
  Covertly TOM adjusts ear piece - Suits bearing down - 
 
                              TOM JONES (CONT'D) 
                                Listen to this - 
 
  Suits almost on top of TOM -- he reaches inside his 
  jacket and pulls out... 
 
  CLOSE ON: WALKMAN and... 
  Turns up volume... 
  Suits stride past... 
  ...TOM, looking determined, jogs along with music... 
 
                              TOM JONES (CONT'D) 
                      Spy on me baby you satellite! 
 
  And he s off - at a pace as we rise higher and higher - 
 
                              TOM JONES (CONT'D) 
                Infrared see me move through the night. 
 
  TOM runs off on - 
 
                          TOM JONES AND TOM QUINN 
            Ain t gonna fire! Shoot me right, I m gonna  
                          like the way you fight... 
 
 
  MUSIC CONTINUES OVER - 
 
  Busy street. TESSA one of many striding down crowded 
  pavement.

                                TOM JONES (V.O.) 
              Now you ve found the secret code I use.. 
 
  CLOSE ON: JOHNNY MARKS (45) Handsome. The crowd his 
  camouflage. TESSA his target. Follows her. 
 
                              TOM JONES (CONT'D) 
                  ...to wash away my lonely blues... 
 
  TESSA stops with the masses at crossing - She hasn t seen 
  JOHNNY MARKS, who is right behind her. Just a breath 
  away. 
 
 
  Small street, flanked by imposing Victorian architecture. 
  Majestic in it s architecture. Arrogant in it s location. 
  A white van cruises through this scene -- Parks up. 
 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 3 Page 3
 

  SAKAR (32), fear on his face a complete contradiction to 
  his huge muscular frame. By his side is CHALAK (19) wiry, 
  taut and filled with dangerous amounts of adrenaline. 
  In rear of van: LEYLA (28) Composed in her beauty and 
  totally focused in her intent. The leader. Prayer beads 
  in hand are gently caressed. 
 
  IN BG: (V/O) Sound of over one hundred Kurdish women, 
  warbling the battle cry... 
  SELAMET (22) and EBRU(23) identifiably sisters... 
  LEYLA nods to SELAMET and EBRU. 
  SELAMET and EBRU open duffel bag, containing AK47 s. 
  Rolls of black cloth lie lengthways down van. 
 
                                        LEYLA 
                                      (Kurdish) 
            Today we will remind the world that all we 
                              want is our home. 
 
                                        CHALAK 
                                      (Kurdish) 
            Today the Turkish government will release our 
            mother and father and all of our people, or 
                            we will kill theirs. 
 
  CHALAK grabs his AK47. LEYLA watches on with concern. 
 
 
  Tracking with TOM at speed -- Something on his mind. 
 
 
  TOM has remembered what he forgot. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                        Shit! 
 
  Whips mobile out. 
 
                                  TOM (CONT'D) 
                                    Shit! Shit! 
                              (Punches in digits) 
                                      Come on! 
 
 
  TOM on phone...

                                        TOM 
                Don t let your mother answer the door. 
 
 
  TOM. Fuck! 
 
                                        TOM 
                                    Why s that? 
 
 
  TOM searches the park for an answer... 
 
                                        TOM 
                                    Ellie, I... 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                                      (Realises)                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 3 Page 8
 

            Tom Jones. It was you who took my Tom Jones 
                                CD! Didn t you? 
 
                                    TOM    
                                        (Er?) 
                                        I... 
 
                                        ELLIE 
            I had Maisie pull her room apart looking for 
                                        that. 
 
                                        TOM 
                A peace offering for my deceitful ways. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
              They re beautiful, even though they re not 
              from Tom. How long will you be? Maisie has 
                spent the last two weeks choosing you a 
                        present, I ll have you know. 
 
                                        TOM 
          Too long. At this rate the Marathon will take 
                                  me four days. 
 
 
  LEYLA has not moved and her men are waiting for a sign. 
 
                                        CHALAK 
                                      (Kurdish) 
                                  Enough. We go. 
 
                                        LEYLA 
                                (Kurdish. Calmly) 
                                        Wait. 
 
                                        CHALAK 
                                      (Kurdish) 
                              We don t need them. 
 
                                        LEYLA 
                                      (Kurdish) 
                                      We wait! 
 
  CHALAK can hardly contain himself. 
 
 
  TESSA walks on, still unaware she is being watched. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 3 Page 9
 

  FOCUS IN ON: JOHNNY. Observing the love of his life. He 
  turns and walks off, just as TESSA turns around and sees 
  him. 
 
 
  Sisters are checking equipment - SAKAR still stressing - 
  CHALAK shakes his head at LEYLA. 
 
                                        CHALAK 
                            (Kurdish, freaking out) 
                      Nothing! We cannot wait anymore. 
 
 
  SONAY, 32, handsome and confident. 
 
                                        SONAY 
            You told me you like dance music, so I made 
          this for you. Mixed it myself. I think you ll 
                                      like it. 
 
                                        ZOE

                                        ZOE 
                                  Right. Great.

                    You know Emily? You look slightly 
                              Turkish...Yes. No. OK. 
                                  (Stops moving) 
                Emily, I should have told you this, but 
            Turkey is looking to host the next Olympics, 
                so as a travel agent and a promoter of 
                            Turkey, they called me.

            Ozan, the Ambassador, is a traditional man,

                                        SONAY 
                          I told him I was married. 
 
  ZOE pulls tight focus on SONAY. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                        No.

                                        ZOE 
                                  Absolutely not. 
 
                                        SONAY 
          For one hour, please Emily, I need this. If I 
          can get my company into the Olympic bid, well 
                          I ll owe you, big time... 
 
                                        ZOE 
              I don t know. I m not good at bullshitting 
                                      people. 
 
                                        SONAY 
                    But you told me you work in PR! 
 
  SONAY. All smiles. ZOE drops her eyes, a small smile. 
 
 
  CHALAK, SAKAR and LEYLA watch as SONAY and ZOE walk past. 
  Sisters load up bags and zip them shut...LEYLA grabs 
  handfuls of magazine clips...

  SONAY and ZOE stride up towards Embassy... 
 
                                        ZOE 
              I don t know about this. What if they catch

                                        SONAY 
            They won t! Don t worry. I started with just

            Newington. Now, I have over fifty offices in 
                        twenty cities around Europe. 
 
  ZOE takes in her surroundings, whilst listening - 
 
                                  SONAY (CONT'D) 
                  Youngest of five boys, parents still

              Afternoon Sir. May I see your invitations? 
 
 
  LEYLA spots JOHNNY walking around the corner. As he walks 
  past their van, he acknowledges LEYLA with a quick nod of 
  the head and a smile. 
 
                                        LEYLA 
                              (Kurdish, to CHALAK) 
                                See, he is here.

  JOHNNY carries on walking past, to - 
 
 
  SAM WALKER in driver s seat (35) Ex Military. The 
    discipline will stay with him for ever, taken back by 
  knock on window - immediately he shifts over into 
  passenger seat. In back of car is VICTOR (36) and LEVI 
  (31 both men clearly best to avoid   JOHNNY gets in. 
 
                                        SAM 
              What the -? You re late. They re about to 
                                      lose it. 
 
                                        JOHNNY 
                                        (Calm) 
            I had to see an old friend. (BEAT) Fifteen 
              years I ve been away. All I have is today 
 
                                        SAM 
            Well you know what? I don t owe these people 
            shit! You however, are holding a down payment 
                  which I intend to collect. Any more 
            deviations from the plan, let me know first, 
                                        OK? 
 
  JOHNNY, as cold as ever, quietly inspects SAM. 
 
                                        JOHNNY 
                                  Where is she? 
 
  SAM looks into rear of car and down at footwell - VICTOR 
  is holding a gun to - 
 
  CLOSE ON: TARA (22). Terrified. 
 
                                        SAM 
                    Did he give you the swift codes? 
 
  A beat. 
 
                                        JOHNNY 
              Of course he did. He loves his daughter. 
 
  SAM and his men roll down the edges of their black 
  woollen hats, to reveal the hats are balaclavas --

  TOM sprints up to a rusty bandstand. STAN THE MAN (33), 
  very latest sports gear - brand new trainers - attempts 
  to pump out a few press ups - 
 
                                        TOM 
                              What are you doing? 
 
  STAN looks up. 
 
                                        STAN 
                      Blending in my man. Blending in. 
 
  TOM can t help but smile. Relaxed. STAN is rubber 
  necking. 
 
                                        TOM 
                          What did you want, Stan? 
 
                                        STAN 
                          Heard something serious. 
 
                                        TOM 
                              Of course you did. 
                                  (TOM jogs off) 
 
  TOM is already a way off - STAN sprints after him. 
 
                                        STAN 
              Wait up! You re not bugged up, are you? I 
                      don t want this on record, OK? 
 
                                        TOM 
                Stan? It s Saturday. My family day. My 
            running day. It s just me, no one else. That 
                  tree over there, really is a tree! 
 
  TOM picks up the pace. 
 
                                        STAN 
                        Just making sure I m safe. 
 
                                        TOM 
                      You are. Just don t look up. 
 
  Satellite is tracking my position. 
 
                                        STAN 
                                        Egh? 
                                (Gets the joke) 
          One of the Haseem family told me four British 
            men approached him a few days ago. British                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 3 Page 16
 

            but not local boys, you know, they had tans. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                      (Sarcastic) 
                                    Did they? 
 
                                        STAN 
            Definitely ex military he reckoned. Looking 
          to purchase SD Hecklers and short stock AK s. 
                                  (The expert) 
                Could cause some serious close quarter 
                  carnage with that little lot my man. 
 
  TOM picks up the pace - STAN can hardly keep up. 
 
                                  STAN (CONT'D) 
              MOD should know about this sort of thing, 
                              don t you reckon? 
 
                                        TOM 
            Thank you Stan, but stick to informing the 
                              police. I m busy... 
 
  TOM picks up his pace - STAN struggling to keep up. 
 
                                        STAN 
            Hang on? What do I get? Come on! I could be 
                                  good for you! 
 
  Tom runs off - points to the sky - STAN can t keep up, 
  comes to a standstill - Slowly STAN looks up. 
 
 
  LEYLA can see JOHNNY in the car behind. 
 
                                        LEYLA 
                            (Kurdish. Calm. Proud.) 
            We are not alone. The blood of our ancestors 
              pumps through our hearts. A blood line we 
            must fight for, and if God wishes, die for. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 3 Page 17
 

  JOHNNY flashes his headlights - 
 
                                  LEYLA (CONT D) 
                        Today the world will listen. 
 
 
  CLOSE ON: PC STEVE. Catches glimpse of masked raider 
  appearing from behind car - 
 
                                      PC STEVE 
                              (Grabbing his radio) 
                                        Shit! 
 
  PC STEVE just manages to hit the panic button on his 
  radio before SAM rips it off of him, and hits him - 
 
  His head jars back - blood spurts from his nose - 
 
  SELAMET and EBRU carrying ladders; SAKAR and CHALAK 
  emerge with rolls of cloth on their shoulders. 
 
  The three dark destroyers (SAM and his men) head straight 
  through front door. 
  LEYLA and her team race up behind them. The whole thing 
  is done with clear and obvious practised ease. 
 
 
  TOM sucking as much oxygen into his lungs as possible. 
  His hands resting on his knees -- he s outside his house 
  about to go in, when mobile rings. Doesn t want to get 
  it. But does. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                  (Into phone) 
                                        Danny? 
 
 
  TOM on his mobile. His neighbours continue their normal 
  Saturday life - cleaning cars - coming back from the 
  shops - clipping their hedges. TOM covertly watches his 
  house - backs behind hedge watching - 
 
  CLOSE ON: MAISIE waiting in window - she hasn t seen TOM. 
 
                                  DANNY (V.O.) 
                                Tom? Zoe s in... 
 
                                        TOM 
                          I know. I put her there. 
 
  CLOSE ON: TOM. 
 
 
  TOM can see MAISIE. Watches from a safe vantage point. 
 
                                        TOM 
                      I need to talk to your mother. 
 
  ELLIE takes phone from MAISIE - concerned. 
 
                                  TOM (CONT'D) 
            I've been called back to the office. Problem 
              with one of our main relay circuits, it s 
          sort of my fault, so I need to go and fix it. 
 
                                  ELLIE (V.O.) 
                              (Looking at MAISIE) 
                                    Not today. 
 
  TOM watches his house, as a black Lexus (MI5) pulls up. 
  He starts to walk towards it... 
 
                                        TOM 
                            Systems have crashed. 
 
                                  ELLIE (V.O.) 
              It s your birthday, Matthew? I can't make 
              excuses for you. I did that for her father 
              and all we got was more lies and excuses. 
 
  TOM. Pow!! 
 
                      ELLIE (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D) 
              Fix whatever it is that's broken and come 
                                        home. 
 
  Line goes dead. 
 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 3 Page 32
 

  ...onto the balcony. 
 
  Down below - people are being evacuated from all 
  buildings in the street. 
  SO19 officers - one sits perched high up in a tree - all 
  pointing guns in their direction. 
  SAKAR freezes, but CHALAK sticks his arm up into the air. 
  He is clearly holding a detonation device. 
 
                                        CHALAK 
                              (in broken English) 
                              YOU SEE! YOU SEE! 
 
  He pulls SAKAR back into Embassy ... 
 
 
  OZAN strapped to his chair - explosives strapped to his 
  lap - sweat pouring down his forehead. He wants to move 
  but can t, and all around him - on the rooves - in the 
  street - SO19 officers, all pointing guns at him... DANNY 
  and his team run across from the roadblock and enter the 
  building next door to the Embassy. 
 
  Further down road, emergency vehicles all parked up. 
  Among them is an unidentifiable van - 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 3 Page 37
 

 
  SAM, VICTOR and LEVI come out of a door onto the roof of 
  the embassy. SAM leads, as they make their way across the 
  rooves. 
 
  There is a clear vantage point of the street below. SAM 
  finds a roof hatch further down the terrace, opens it. 
 
 
  OZAN strapped to his chair. He looks up and sees DANNY s 
  head pop out of the window of the next door balcony. 
  DANNY gives him a gesture that is meant to be reassuring 
  as we follow the detonator wire inside ... 
 
 
  HARRY presides over a panoramic view of London. ROGER 
  WELKS, by his side, panic rising to the surface. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                      You gave him the swift codes. 
 
                                        ROGER 
            They were going to kill her. What else could 
                                        I do? 
 
  In the background, TOM is escorted through an open-plan 
  glass fronted office by NICK and MIKE. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                      Given them the wrong numbers. 
 
                                        ROGER 
          They took her with them and said if I came to 
            you they d kill her. Now what are you going 
                                to do about it? 
 
  TOM joins the party. ROGER becomes even more agitated. 
 
                                        TOM 
                        What the hell is going on? 
 
                                        ROGER 
            I can t do this. If they find out I m here... 
            How could you let this happen? Jesus Christ, 
                          she just... She just... 
 
  ROGER is about to blubber. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                Right now this man is your only hope of 
                                seeing her alive. 
 
  ROGER takes a breath, finds TOM s questioning eyes. 
 
                                  HARRY (CONT D) 
                                      (to TOM) 
            Roger here manages a bank. A bank we use to 
              pay all of our agents, around the world. 
            Until today we thought only three people knew                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 3 Page 49
 

            where it was located, myself, Roger and the 
            director of five. Now one other knows, Johnny 
                                        Marks. 
 
                                        TOM 
                Johnny Marks - I thought he was dead. 
 
  On TOM as this sinks in. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                        Roger? 
 
                                        ROGER 
                                    (a wreck) 
                The MOD credits our bank. We credit the 
            accounts of agents working for five and SIS. 
            To protect the agent from any form of trace, 
            we use swift codes. They allow us access to 
            credit or debit the accounts of the MOD and 
              the agents accounts with protected ease. 
 
 
  On HARRY. 
 
                                        HARRY 
            He could trace the personal details of every 
            single undercover service agent MI5 and MI6 
            use. If the next world war comes down to who 
                knows what about whom, we ve just lost. 
 
                                        TOM 
                    And Johnny Marks has the codes. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 3 Page 50
 

                                        HARRY 
            He managed to find out the location of the 
            bank and he s got the swift codes. He saw an 
                opportunity with the Kurds, and now he s 
            taken it. If Johnny Marks accesses that bank, 
            he will pose one of the biggest threats to 
                  national security we have ever faced. 
 
                                        TOM 
            The three guns for hire are working for him? 
 
  TOM getting the picture. 
 
                                        ROGER 
                And my bank is five doors down from the 
                                Turkish Embassy. 
 
                                        TOM 
                        This whole thing s a cover. 
 
                                        HARRY 
              This is our business. No one else needs to 
              know. If Johnny Marks gets into the MOD s 
                accounts, he ll get the names of every 
              informant and spy this government has, and 
          with that goes years of intelligence down the 
              drain. Now that really would be a tragedy, 
            and one you and I will not walk away from. 
                  You get in there and you stop him. 
 
  EXT CLOSE ON: TOM. 
 
 
  TOM strides towards surveillance van. Police. S019. 
  Emergency vehicles of every kind pack the street. 
 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 3 Page 53
 

  SAS  POV : OZAN is looking worse for wear as we... 
 
 
  TOM briefs DANNY and his tech team - all huddled over 
  street map. 
 
                                        TOM 
                              Only one entrance. 
                                    (To DANNY) 
                The front door - but they ll have that 
            covered. If Marks  team are in the building, 
                the alarm systems will be down. They've 
            engineered this so we'd all be looking at the 
              Embassy, we can use this to our advantage. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                What about Zoe? 
 
  DANNY and his team head out... 
 
                                        TOM 
                COBRA have cleared the way for the SAS. 
              Hopefully Zoe will keep her head down when 
                                    they go in. 
                                        (beat) 
          This is a strictly need to know operation. We 
            don t want anyone to find out what that bank 
                        really does. Is that clear? 
 
  It is. 
 
 
  DANNY and his team stand on the staircase. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                                  (Into radio) 
                Charlie one this is Alpha team. We have 
            absolutely no way in. The roof s blocked and 
                    the street is out. I say we wait. 
 
                                    TOM (V.O.) 
              Wait? Alpha get your team in there, now. 
 
                                        DANNY 
                          What about the Embassy? 
 
 
  OZAN looking ever worse - pale and ill - Struggling to 
  breathe - Wants to move but can t... 
 
 
  TOM striding down middle of street - past - 
 
  COLIN with his laptop - and the cable guy linking into 
  street cable access box - 
 
  On TOM walks - 
 
  SO19 MEN pointing sniper rifles from behind walls - 
  hedges... 
 
  TOM can now see the Ambassador on the balcony as we... 
 
 
  TOM strides up to main door - 
 
  Door opens - TOM can make out CHALAK's feet behind door 
  and the butt of his AK47 in ZOE's back. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                  How you doing? 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                  Been better. 
 
                                        CHALAK 
                                  The medicine! 
 
  TOM's eyes look deep into ZOE s.... 
 
    (CONTINUOUS) 
 
  TOM hands over the inhaler to ZOE. 
  Phone ringing in background... 
 
  TOM looks deep into ZOE's eyes... 
 
 
  DANNY and his team rush through the building. They run 
  into the room where SAM and his men are. 
 
  VICTOR fires!! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! 
 
  Gunfire echoes down the street - 
 
    (CONTINUOUS) 
 
  Hearing gunfire, TOM grabs ZOE from doorway.... 
 
                                  LEYLA (V.O.) 
                                      (Shouts)                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 3 Page 66
 

                                      Chalak! 
 
  TOM pulls her round as CHALAK comes into doorway - fires 
  his gun into TOM's back - 
 
  Sniper picks out CHALAK - 
 
  Bullet rips into his forehead... His eyes wide with 
  surprise. 
 
 
  SAS run along the balcony, de-fuse OZAN, and storm into 
  the dining room through the windows. 
 
  LEYLA is stunned. As the SAS enter, she looks around to 
  her comrades, holds up her hands and closes her eyes. 
 
 
  TOM sucking in air. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                                  Shit! Oh Shit! 
 
  ZOE rips away TOM s flack jacket - Bullet has gone 
  through and torn into TOM s back - 
 
  Past them the Kurds are led away in handcuffs. 
 
  ZOE looks up long enough to catch LEYLA s eye. 
 
                                        LEYLA 
                What we have done today will never be 
                forgotten. My brother s name will not be 
            forgotten. What will you be remembered for? 
                    You don t exist, do you, Emily? 
 
  Then ZOE s attention returns to TOM. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 3 Page 67
 

 
  We re back in TOM s street. Only now there are no lights 
  on in TOM s house. 
  DANNY and ZOE sitting in front seats. Both totally spent. 
 
  ZOE checks ragged image in the mirror.. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                  Definitely more me. Wouldn't you say? 
 
                                        DANNY 
            I thought you looked stunning in that dress. 
 
  ZOE. Wow. 
 
  TOM, from the backseat, watches the warm light from his 
  house shining out. 
 
                                        ZOE 
                        What you going to tell her? 
 
                                        TOM 
            I don t know, but I wish I hadn t turned down 
            the painkiller. It might have taken the edge 
                      off of telling her the truth. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 3 Page 69
 

                                        DANNY 
                                      Steady. 
 
  TOM exits car. DANNY looks over at ZOE. Her hair s a 
  mess. TOM s blood on her dress and she still looks 
  stunning. 
 
  ZOE manages a smile as TOM limps off towards his house. 
 
 
  JOHNNY and HARRY in middle of the street. 
 
  Blues and twos surround them. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                              Outstanding effort. 
 
  HARRY holds out his hand. 
 
                                        JOHNNY 
            I m not done yet. You see, you created me. 
          You trained and manipulated me, just like the                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 3 Page 71
 

            west manipulates entire countries, and then 
            acts so shocked when they turn round and rip 
                        off the hand that fed them. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                                      (Bored) 
                              Who was in the car? 
 
                                        JOHNNY 
                                  My brother. 
                                      (Whispers) 
                    Your people killed the wrong man. 
 
                                        HARRY 
                I really don t know what you re talking 
                                        about. 
 
                                        JOHNNY 
            Three thousand agents  names and addresses. 
            All of them out there trying to affect the 
              course of world events. Why? Because this 
            tiny island can t stop trying to punch above 
                                it s own weight. 
 
                                        HARRY 
              Did you really believe you could get away 
                                    with this? 
 
                                        JOHNNY 
                I already have. I ve got a lot of money, 
            Harry, and all of it is yours. You know the 
                      part I m really going to miss? 
                                      (-BEAT-) 
            The part where you have to try and explain 
                        away fifteen million pounds. 
 
                                        HARRY 
          You and I both know you are not going to walk 
                                away from this. 
 
                                        JOHNNY 
              How much are three thousand agents  lives 
            worth to you? You willing to sacrifice all 
                those people, for just little old me. 
 
  HARRY's smug grin slides slowly off his face. 
 
                                JOHNNY (CONT'D) 
                        I walk. You get the names. 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 3 Page 72
 

                                        HARRY 
                            How can I trust you? 
 
                                        JOHNNY 
                  Because I have never broken my word. 
 
  HARRY smiles politely - then steps aside -- Johnny 
  strides past - HARRY grabs him. 
 
                                        HARRY 
            Neither have I. Know this. I always do my own 
                                    dirty work. 
 
  HARRY has just confessed to killing JOHNNY s brother. 
 
                                  HARRY (CONT'D) 
          If one of those names is ever revealed I will 
                    not make the same mistake again. 
 
  Johnny strides off...
