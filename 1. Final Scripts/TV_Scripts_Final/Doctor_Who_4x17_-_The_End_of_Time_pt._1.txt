11FX SHOT - PLANET EARTH

      FX: THE EARTH, suspended in space, in all its beauty.

      Over this, the NARRATOR.  An old, wise man.

                                      NARRATOR
                    It is said that in the final days
                    of Planet Earth, everyone had bad
                    dreams.

                                                                            MIX TO:

22EXT. SHOPPING STREET - NIGHT 1

      CAMERA craning down a huge, outdoor CHRISTMAS TREE...

                                      NARRATOR
                    To the west of the north of that
                    world, the Human Race did gather,
                    in celebration of a pagan rite, to
                    banish the cold and the dark.

      ...craning down to find a SALVATION ARMY BRASS BAND.  God
      Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen; the most mournful of carols.

                                                          Tale
      Moving round to find a few ONLOOKERS (SHOPPERS in b/g). 
      People, just dotted about, pausing.  A woman & gran.  Three
      teenagers.  A family, mum, dad and little daughter...

                                      NARRATOR (CONT'D)
                    Each and every one of those people
                    had dreamt of the terrible things
                    to come.  But they forgot, because
                    they must; they forgot their
                      nightmares, of fire and war and
                                  Writer's 
                    insanity.  They forgot...

      ...then finding WILFRED MOTT.

                  The 

      Wilf's troubled, uneasy, and on his CLOSE UP -

      INTERCUT, fast, violent - CU of a FACE, bleached, against
      black - manic laughter - a familiar face, it's -

      Wilf blinks.  Shakes it off.  Turns away... 

      CUT TO WIDER.  Wilf wandering along.  Lost in thought.

      And then he hears... 

      Evensong.  Beautiful, high chords.  He looks...

      A CHURCH.  In the middle of town.  (The Runaway Bride
      church.)  It's as though the music is drawing him in...

                                                                            CUT TO:

33INT. CHURCH - NIGHT 1

      WILDRED enters.  The vaulted space filled with Evensong.

      A CHOIR, at the altar, dressed in full surplices.

      Candles all around.  The pews are almost empty, just one
      or two PEOPLE, dotted about, in prayer.

      Wilf looks round.  Not sure what he's doing there.

      Then something catches his eye...

      To the side, a STAINED GLASS WINDOW.

      He walks closer.  Something in the image...

      At the bottom of the window, to the left: a BLUE BOX.  
      FX: image inlaid, a simple representation of the Tardis,
      stained-glass panels of light radiating from its lamp.

                                                          Tale
      The Evensong drifts into The Doctor's Theme, as Wilf walks
      closer.  Staring, entranced, then -

                                      WOMAN
                    They call it the Legend of the
                    Blue Box.

      He turns.  The WOMAN behind him.  She's 60, wise, kind.

                                    WILF
                                  Writer's 
                    Never been in here before.  I'm
                    not one for churches.  Too cold.

                                      WOMAN
                    This was the site of a convent,
                    back in the thirteen hundreds. 
                  The 
                    It's said a demon fell from the
                    sky.  Then a man appeared, a man
                    in a blue box.  They called him
                    the sainted physician.  He smote
                    the demon.  And then disappeared.

                                    WILF
                    Bit of a coincidence.

                                      WOMAN
                    In what way?

                          (looks back at window)
                    ...I've, just, heard stories like
                    that before, that's all.

                    It's said there's no such thing as
                      coincidence.  Who knows?  Perhaps
                    he's coming back.

                                    WILF
                    Ohh, that would make my Christmas -

      He turns back round -

      No one there.  The woman has gone; like she was never there.

      Wilf chilled.  He looks back at the stained-glass window.

      The choir's voices soaring now.

      CLOSER on the glass blue box...

      CLOSER on Wilf, CLOSER on the box, now INTERCUT WITH -

      The FACE - the insane, laughing face -

      The face of THE MASTER.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      FX: CLOSER, THE TARDIS MATERIALISES in an icy quarry. 
      Rain in the air, washing away some of the snow.

      THE DOCTOR pops his head out.  Big, deliberate grin.  He's
      in sunglasses, wearing a flowery Hawaiian lei & straw hat.

                    this?  Springtime on the Ood-Sphere? 
                    New life, fresh start, all of that.

      The Doctor strolls towards him.

                    So, where were we?  I was summoned,
                    wasn't I?  An Ood, in the snow,
                    calling to me, weeeeell, I didn't
                    exactly come straight here.  Had a
                    bit of fun, y'know?  Travelled
                    about.  Did this and that.  Got
                    into trouble, you know me.  It was

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    So.  Right.  Hello. 

                                      ELDER OOD
                    You will join, you will join, you
                    will join, you will join...

      As he repeats that, the Elder & Ood put their hind-brains
      in their laps; all join hands, the Ood either side of the
      Doctor joining hands with him (Ood hands, no more gloves).

      The Doctor cautious... but reaches out, takes their hands -

      CU the Doctor - shocked, fear!  INTERCUT WITH -

      THE MASTER'S FACE.  His giggling insanity -

      The Doctor lets go -

      The Elder Ood calmer, more focused now.

                    There is yet more.  Join us.

      Deep breath.  The Doctor takes hold of their hands again.

      The Doctor concentrates.  All of this with eyes open; he's
      staring to the distance, sharing these visions.

                    We see so much, but understand

                    The Master took the name of Saxon. 
                    He married a human, a woman called
                    Lucy.  And he corrupted her.  She
                    stood at his side while he conquered
                    the Earth.  I reversed everything
                    he'd done, so it never even

                      remembered.  And she killed him. 
                    I held him in my arms.  I burnt
                    his body.  The Master is dead.

                    Doctor.  The Master is part of a
                    greater design.  Because a shadow
                    is falling over creation; something
                    vast is stirring in the dark. 

      And the Doctor looks round the circle, horrified...

      All the Ood-eyes are now RED!

      Miss Trefusis goes to the shadows, picks up a CLAY BOWL. 
      Places it on the plinth.  At the same time, 4 Guards go to

      Another homeless man is approaching, quietly.  Thin,

                    Wilfred, did you tell them who I
                    am?!  You promised me -

                                    WILF
                    No, I just said you're a doctor,
                    that's all.  And might I say... 
                          (salutes)
                    It is an honour to meet you again,
                    sir.

      The Doctor can't help smiling, salutes back.  Then:

                                      MINNIE
                    Ooh, but you never said he was a

      She gives her mobile to Oliver -

                    Not bad, is he?  Me next!

      - and Minnie scuttles to the Doctor's side, all the old
      folk, except Wilf, gathering round him.  He's trapped!

      But then Wilf's hurrying into the cafe.  A bit secretive.

                                    WILF

      THE DOCTOR & WILF sit with a cuppa.  Only a couple of PEOPLE

      nervous.  Like he's waiting.  The Doctor studying him.

                    didn't we?  Those Atmos things. 
                    And those planets in the sky!  Me

                    No, but people have waited hundreds
                    of years to find me.  Then you
                    manage it in a couple of hours.

                                    WILF

                    But I keep on meeting you, Wilf. 
                    Over and over again.  Like
                      something's still connecting us.

                                    WILF
                    What's so important about me?

                                    THE DOCTOR

                    Well.  Me too, one day.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Don't you dare.

                                    WILF
                    I'll try not to.

                    But I was told.  He will knock
                    four times.  That was the prophecy. 
                    Knock four times, and then...

                                    WILF
                      I thought... when I last saw you,

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    I can still die.  If I'm killed
                    before regeneration, then I'm dead.
                          (pause)

                    am, dies.  Some new man goes
                      sauntering away, and...  I'm dead.

      Wilf now looking at him.  Then looking out of the window. 
      Then looking at him.  Then out of the window.

                    What?

      The Doctor looks out of the window.

      And there she is.  Just as Wilf planned.

      DONNA NOBLE.

      The Doctor stares.  So happy.  So sad.

      She's across the street, just parked, getting out of her
      car.  Looking at her watch, waiting for someone.  Good
      distance away, not seeing Wilf & the Doctor in the cafe.

                                    WILF
                    I'm sorry.  But I had to.  Ohh
                    Doctor, can't you make her better?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Stop it.

                                    WILF
                    But you're so clever!  Can't you
                    bring her memory back?  Just go to
                    her now, go on, just run across
                    the street, go up and say hello -

                    If she ever remembers me, then her
                    mind will burn, and she will die.

      Pause.

      Then a TRAFFIC WARDEN comes near Donna's car (on double
      yellows).  Donna barks at her, "Don't you touch my car!!" 
      and the traffic warden scurries away, scared.

      The Doctor & Wilf laugh.

                    She's not changed.

                                    WILF
                    And there he is...

      handsome man.  Laden down with food-shopping.  Quick kiss
      hello, then they make a great palaver out of dividing the
      shopping up, some in the boot, some on the back seat.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                      ...another wedding.  Hold on, she's
                    not gonna be called Noble-Temple?! 
                    Sounds like a tourist spot.

                                    WILF
                    No, it's Temple-Noble!

      An old, cardboard box.

      Opens it.  Fearful.

      Inside: an old SERVICE REVOLVER, World War II.

      Wilf trembling.  Holds it in his hand.  The weight of it.

                    verge of collapse, this could be
                    our last chance - not just for
                      capitalism, but for civilisation
                    itself.  The details of the plan
                    are a closely guarded secret. 
                    Indeed, it's being said that many
                    of the details are known only to
                    President Obama himself.  And so
                    we wait, both in hope, and in fear. 
                    Praying that this new Christmas
                    message will lead the Human race
                    out of darkness.  And into the
                    light.
