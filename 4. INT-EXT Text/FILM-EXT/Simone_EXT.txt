STUDIO LOT - DAY
The man performing this curious task is
writer/producer/director, VIKTOR TARANSKY, forties,
conservatively dressed in suit and tie.
He sits alone at an
empty craft service table outside a cavernous soundstage,
some distance from the rest of the film set -- a breeze blows
the table's paper cloth.
Viktor finishes sorting.
Finding no trash can to deposit the
rejected cherry candy, he scoops them into his pocket.
A young headset-clad P.A. hurriedly approaches.
He looks
ill.
P.A.
Mr. Taransky --
Viktor reads the young P.A.'s panicked expression.
VIKTOR
She's walking?... Don't tell me
she's walking.
(blood slowly draining
from his face)
She is not walking... She can't
walk.
TRAILER - DAY
NICOLA ANDERS, twenty-something, A-list actress, beautiful
face scowling, is supervising her ASSISTANT ferrying clothes
from a movie trailer to a limousine.
VIKTOR desperately
follows after Nicola.
VIKTOR
-- Nicola!
How was your massage?
NICOLA
You're in breach.
VIKTOR
-- Is this about the new pages? --
I made the changes you wanted,
you're in virtually every scene --
NICOLA
(wheeling on him)
It's not the size of the role,
Viktor.
(suddenly very cool)
Am I or am I not contractually
entitled to the biggest trailer on
the set?
VIKTOR
(regarding the enormous
silver fish behind them,
confused)
It's the biggest on earth!
I
swear!
It's a 50-foot Airstream --
they don't make them any longer
than that.
NICOLA
Taller, Viktor.
VIKTOR
Taller?
What?
Viktor looks up in horror.
The trailer next to Nicola's does
indeed appear to be fractionally taller.
NICOLA
(walking away)
You've insulted me for the last
time.
Viktor looks to the tires.
His face suddenly brightens.
VIKTOR
Nicola, it's just the tires --
they're over-inflated!
I can fix
it!
Viktor grasps the air nozzle on a tire and begins desperately
stabbing at it with a ballpoint pen.
Air hisses out.
VIKTOR
See, it's lower already.
Nicola ignores Viktor, marching towards her limo with her
PUBLICIST.
Abandoning the trailer, Viktor hurries after her.
VIKTOR
I beg you.
You can't do this to
me.
NICOLA
(looking back)
I had three other offers.
I only
signed on to this picture out of...
loyalty.
VIKTOR
Then show some.
They'll shut me
down!
NICOLA
(opening the car door)
It wasn't working anyhow.
The
scene with the thousand geese -- I
don't understand this film.
I
don't think anyone will understand
it.
I already put out a press
release -- citing "creative
differences".
Viktor stops, nods resignedly -- suddenly very calm.
VIKTOR
You know what, Nicola, you're
right.
(picking up her last piece
of luggage)
Here, let me help you with that.
(holding the door for her)
You ought to go.
The truth is I
don't deserve you.
This film
doesn't deserve you.
Frankly, it
deserves much, much better.
The
reason it's not working is because
you're not about the work.
Nicola is stunned.
VIKTOR
(to the limo driver)
To Hell, please.
The door slams and the limo roars away.
Viktor looks to the
still hissing trailer tire.
The CREW regards Viktor
apprehensively.
VIKTOR
(to the crew)
What are you looking at?
Get back
to work.
The crew is uncertain what work there is to do.
STUDIO LOT - DAY
ELAINE and VIKTOR talk in the shadow of an enormous
soundstage.
They speak more freely in each other's company.
ELAINE
God, Viktor.
Why do you always
have to make things so difficult
for yourself?
VIKTOR
Difficult.
I'm difficult.
He produces a handful of candy from his pocket.
VIKTOR
(referring to the candy)
-- Do you know what these are,
Elaine?
ELAINE
(talking a piece of candy
and eating it)
Hmm... Mike and Ike's.
VIKTOR
Not just any Mike & Ike's -- cherry
Mike & Ike's.
Do you know why I,
Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy
Award nominated director --
ELAINE
-- Viktor, that was Short Subject.
VIKTOR
-- overseeing the most cherished
movie project of my career, am
walking around with a pocketful of
cherry Mike & Ike's?
Elaine takes a seat in a nearby studio cart as Viktor paces.
ELAINE
-- I have a feeling you're going to
tell me.
VIKTOR
-- I'll tell you why.
It is
because Miss Nicola Anders,
supermodel with a SAG card God's
gift to cinema, has it written into
her contract that all cherry Mike &
Ike's be removed from her candy
dish along with strict instructions
that any room she walks into should
have seven packs of cigarettes
waiting for her three of them
opened, that there be a personal
jacuzzi within eighty paces of her
dressing room, and that any time
she travels, her nanny must fly
with her first class.
ELAINE
-- What's wrong with that?
VIKTOR
Elaine, she doesn't have any
children!
(grabbing her arm)
Don't you see?
We're being held
hostage by 12 men and 5 women who
someone somewhere has decreed are
the A-list.
ELAINE
The public decides who's on that
list.
VIKTOR
Please.
ELAINE
It's the truth.
Those 17
superstars are our insurance
policy.
We can't open -- can't
make a profit without them.
VIKTOR
We can hardly make a profit with
them.
Up-front salary, back-end
deal, perks, per diem, percentages
-- They're mocking us, Elaine.
We're at their mercy.
(staring wistful, into
space)
We always had movie stars but they
used to be our stars.
We used to
decide who would play what role.
We told them what to wear, what to
say, who to date.
When they were
under contract, we could change
their names if we wanted to -- more
than once!
ELAINE
(regarding him as if he's
insane)
You realize you're nostalgic for an
era you weren't even born in?
VIKTOR
(irritated at her
infuriating logic)
Well, I do remember why I started
out in this business -- you seem to
have forgotten -- working in New
York with Cassevetes -- we were
trying to do something important,
shine a light in that darkened
cinema --
ELAINE
(rolling her eyes)
-- It's called a projector.
VIKTOR
(ignoring her)
-- Illuminate hearts and minds with
a ray of truth.
ELAINE
Listen, Viktor, I have good
memories of those days too -- but
this isn't about that or you or me
or some high-minded ideal.
This is
business.
VIKTOR
Spare me.
ELAINE
(gesturing at the studio
lot)
-- Christ, Viktor, look around.
What do you think pays for all
this?
This is about investment and
return.
Those days in New York...
that's... it's over.
A pause.
Viktor reads Elaine's face.
VIKTOR
You're not renewing my contract.
ELAINE
How can I?
Your last three
pictures tanked.
The board is
giving me hell.
No bankable star
will work with you after this.
If
you just compromised... a little.
Viktor eats some of the candy in his hand as he takes in the
news.
VIKTOR
(rueful smile)
-- Well, it's not every day you're
fired by the mother of your own
child.
Elaine also eats some more candy -- a curiously intimate
moment between them.
ELAINE
(softening, a heart-to
heart)
I'm not taking away your daughter,
just your deal.
You and I both
know, after the divorce I kept you
on for old time's sake, so you
could still hold your head up in
front of Lainey.
I called what's
his name at Warner's.
He said he'd
take a meeting -- in July.
I've
fought for you Viktor...
(voice trails off)
You want to talk severance?
VIKTOR
(staring off into the
distance, face hardening)
You can have everything -- office,
car, assistants -- all I want is
the picture.
ELAINE
(confused)
The picture's dead.
VIKTOR
So there's no problem -- I can have
the rights, the negative too?
ELAINE
(believing she's getting
off lightly)
They're yours.
But how are you
going to finish it?
Without a star
there's no movie.
VIKTOR
I don't need a star.
All I need is
an actor -- I'll reshoot the part,
cut out Nicola and replace her with
a real actor.
A real leading lady.
ELAINE
Even if you find her, you know the
problem with unknowns, Viktor.
If
they're good, they get known.
And
then you're back to sorting their
candy... and worse.
(kissing him on the cheek
as she departs in her
studio golf cart)
I'm sorry, Viktor.
Viktor watches her depart down the canyon of stages, left
alone on the deserted lot.
STUDIO ENTRANCE - DUSK
Twenty NICOLA ANDERS' FACES jiggle into frame.
VIKTOR's face
appears amongst them.
They are cardboard figures, standing together in the trailer
of an electric cart.
A WORKMAN is collecting the promotional
standees from around the lot.
VIKTOR places his hands on the neck of a cardboard cut-out --
we sense he is about to rip her head off -- when a fourteen
year old girl, LAINEY, appears beside him, carrying a laptop
computer.
LAINEY
Hi, Dad.
VIKTOR
(slightly ashamed)
Hello, sweetheart.
Viktor, embarrassed by his childishness, steps aside for the
suspicious workman who carries the standee away.
Lainey smiles sweetly.
She hugs him.
LAINEY
I'm sorry Mom canned you.
VIKTOR
(shrugging)
It's really... not anything,
Lainey.
It's just --
LAINEY
Don't feel too bad.
(glancing to a standee)
Mom runs the place and they still
walk all over her.
You're better
off out of it.
VIKTOR
(regarding his daughter)
You look very grown up.
What are
you doing?
You meeting your mom
for dinner?
She glances towards the entrance where Lainey's mother,
ELAINE, and her dependable, uncomplicated businessman
boyfriend, KENT, wait beside Elaine's car.
LAINEY
(reluctant admission)
Kent got tickets to the ballet.
Viktor shakes the idea of Kent and Elaine from his head.
VIKTOR
(trying to convince
himself as much as
Lainey)
I'm going to finish the picture,
sweetheart.
It's important.
LAINEY
(not quite convinced)
I know you'll do it, Dad.
You're
Viktor Taransky.
Lainey kisses the forlorn Viktor goodbye.
She runs to her
mother and Kent.
VIKTOR
(to himself)
That's right.
I'm Viktor Taransky.
STUDIO BUILDING - SOME DISTANCE AWAY - DUSK
From a distance ELAINE and KENT regard the lonely figure of
VIKTOR.
KENT
You had no choice, Elaine.
He's a
liability.
ELAINE
(wistful look to Viktor)
He also happens to be the most
talented man I've ever known.
Elaine climbs in the car as Lainey approaches.
STUDIO BACKLOT - TRAM - DAY
CLOSE UP on a copy of "Variety".
The front page banner
headline: "ANDERS RIDES OUT OF 'SUNSET' -- Cites Creative
Differences"
The man reading the trade paper sits in the back of a tram on
a studio tour -- HANK ALENO.
He wears a pair of spectacles
with one lens blacked out, his head tilted on one side.
It
is an item buried on the inside pages that catches Hank's one
good eye.
TARANSKY CALLS A-LIST:
"OVER-PRICED, OVER-PAMPERED PRIMA DONNAS"
- Director's Future Now In Doubt -
The tram pauses.
The TOUR GUIDE keeps up a commentary.
TOUR GUIDE
-- On your left, the house where
Claris Commodore uttered those now
immortal words, "If that door
doesn't hold, stand behind me".
And coming up on your right --
When the tram departs, we discover that Hank has exited the
tram and is hiding in the facade of a New York subway
entrance.
The tag around his neck reads, "VISITOR -- Stay
With The Tour".
STUDIO GATE - NIGHT
VIKTOR wheels a stack of film cans on a dolly while holding
several framed black and white photographs of screen legends
under his arm.
HANK, hiding in the shadows of the soundstages, spies Viktor.
He hurries towards him as Viktor approaches his antiquated
Bentley.
HANK
-- Mr. Taransky, Mr. Taransky...
thank God.
I've been trying to see
you, calling -- Your assistant
wouldn't put me through.
I told
her it was a matter of life and
death.
I was afraid I wouldn't get
to you in time --
VIKTOR
(using his stack of film
cans as a barrier)
-- Please, get away from me.
HANK
I did it, Mr. Taransky.
I licked
skin.
I licked hair.
I licked
every part of her.
VIKTOR
(more disturbed, fearing
he is dealing with a
pervert)
You want me to call Security?
HANK
I have her, Mr. Taransky.
The
answer to your prayers.
(producing the "Variety"
article, conspiratorial)
The answer to this.
VIKTOR
(regarding the article)
I was misquoted.
HANK
I have your new leading lady...
(indicating the bulge in
his pocket)
... right here in my pants.
Viktor takes a step back, concerned once again about the
man's motives.
HANK
(trying to reassure)
It's me, Mr. Taransky.
Don't you
recognize me? -- The Future of
Film conference in San Jose.
Hank... Hank Aleno.
I was keynote
speaker.
You must remember my
speech... "Who Needs Humans?"
VIKTOR
(faint glimmer of
recognition)
That's right.
You were booed off
the stage.
That's got to be -- ?
HANK
-- Eight years ago.
In that whole
time, I never left my computer.
VIKTOR
(wary)
Good for you, Hank.
HANK
(referring to his covered
eye)
Good and bad.
They think that's
what caused this.
Me eye tumor.
Microwaves from the screen.
It's
the size of a grapefruit.
Heavy
too.
VIKTOR
(regarding the pathetic
figure with the tilted
head)
I'm sorry.
HANK
Don't be.
It was worth it.
Hank once again indicated the bulge in his pocket.
Viktor
now understands the significance of the gesture.
HANK
You have to see her.
VIKTOR
(loading cans into the
car)
I've seen them all before.
HANK
Not like this --
VIKTOR
(patronizing smile)
Come on, Hank.
A synthespian,
virtual actor -- ?
HANK
(irritated)
-- We call them "vactors".
VIKTOR
I need flesh and --
HANK
-- Flesh is weak.
VIKTOR
-- a living, breathing actor -- I
can't work with a fake.
Viktor loads his film cans into the car.
HANK
(pointing to Nicola in
Variety)
You already do.
But my actor won't
get old, fat, lazy or drunk --
won't throw tantrums, demand a body
double, script changes or a bigger
trailer.
(whispers, conspiratorial)
The Disney Corporation has been
using artificial actors for years.
VIKTOR
That's the point, Hank.
No matter
how good they are, they're still
Mickey Mouse.
Everyone's tried.
Everyone's failed.
It can't be
done.
HANK
It can -- with my new computer
code, you and me, we can do it
together.
VIKTOR
I don't know anything about
computers.
HANK
That's why you're so perfect.
You
have something I don't have.
VIKTOR
What's that?
HANK
An eye -- for performance.
You
know the truth when you see it.
I
know.
I've seen your movies.
I
love your movies.
VIKTOR
You do?
HANK
"Straw God" changed my life.
VIKTOR
You saw that?
HANK
I've seen every frame of your work.
You're the only filmmaker in
Hollywood with the artistic
integrity to realize my vision.
You and me, art and science... we
are the perfect marriage.
VIKTOR
Listen, Hank, it's been a rough
day.
(climbing into his car)
I'll call you about his next week.
HANK
(at the car window)
I won't be here next week.
The
tumor's inoperable.
I'll be dead.
VIKTOR
(winding down the window)
I'm already dead.
Viktor's car roars away.
He looks back at the forlorn Hank
in the rear view mirror.
HANK
Call me.
(looking at his watch)
This week!
A huge eye from a dismantled Nicola Anders billboard is
wheeled away behind him -- followed by a huge pair of lips.
BEACH - DAY
VIKTOR hurries along the beach.
When he turns, he discovers
the MAN IN THE SUIT following him.
As Viktor runs, the Suit
runs -- calling out to him.
MAN IN THE SUIT
Mr. Taransky, Mr. Taransky --
VIKTOR
(calling back)
I'm not him.
Viktor stumbles.
When he recovers, the Suit is on him.
MAN IN THE SUIT
Mr. Taransky, Sir, I represent the
estate of Mr. Hank Aleno.
(showing him Hank's
obituary in the L.A.
Times)
It was Mr. Aleno's last wish that
you have this.
The Suit hands Viktor a heavily-sealed envelope.
VIKTOR
What is it?
MAN IN THE SUIT
I have no idea, Sir.
He wanted you
to have it.
The Suit departs.
Viktor hesitates, then breaks the seal on
the package -- inside he finds a hard-drive.
The hard-drive
is labeled "SIMULATION ONE".
A TITLE APPEARS ON THE SCREEN:
SIX MONTHS LATER
CLOSE UP ON
a VACUUM CLEANER cleaning a tatty red carpet.
On the other end of the vacuum cleaner is VIKTOR.
The red
carpet leads to a rundown, downtown Los Angeles cinema -- the
venue for the premiere of "SUNRISE, SUNSET".
To save money
on posters, Viktor has altered the originals, "Starring
NICOLA ANDERS" crudely pasted over with "Introducing SIMONE".
RUNDOWN DOWNTOWN CINEMA - DUSK
VIKTOR regards the sad, little premiere.
No paparazzi, no
limos, no klieg lights.
Resorting to giving away tickets to
PASSERS-BY, Viktor approaches a HOMELESS MAN sleeping in
trash.
VIKTOR
Want to see a free movie?
HOMELESS MAN
(he thinks)
No.
A taxi pulls up.
Viktor's daughter, LAINEY, steps out.
LAINEY
(kissing him hello)
Hi, Dad.
VIKTOR
Hello, Lainey.
Viktor goes to pay for the taxi but doesn't have quite enough
cash.
Lainey pays herself.
VIKTOR
Your mother couldn't make it?
LAINEY
She's at the premiere of "A Cold
Day In Hell".
But I think she send
someone from Acquisitions.
VIKTOR
She still with Kent?
LAINEY
This week anyhow.
VIKTOR escorts Lainey down the empty red carpet, regarding
the pathetic premiere.
As they walk by, the bulb in Viktor's
sole spotlight expires.
VIKTOR
Not quite how I imagined it --
LAINEY
(looking on the bright
side)
-- You finished the film on your
own terms, that's what matters.
Did you really do all the post
yourself?
VIKTOR
There was no other way.
LAINEY
I missed you.
I wondered if you
were ever coming back.
VIKTOR
Me too.
LAINEY
(regarding the makeshift
poster, trying to lift
his spirits)
Well, I can't wait to meet
Simone... what's her last name?
VIKTOR
You know, I... don't know.
LAINEY
Is she here tonight?
VIKTOR
She can't watch herself.
They are interrupted by the THEATER OWNER.
THEATER OWNER
-- Hey, we have to start.
I've got
"Tough Love 2" playing at ten.
PIER - "SUNRISE, SUNSET" - MORNING
A foggy, empty pier.
A MAN is running through the mist,
shouting desperately.
HAL
Valarie!
VALARIE!
Finally, out of the fog -- a young woman in a black cape and
hood, her back to us.
The camera pushes in, music swells and
she turns.
SIMONE.
She is exquisitely, ethereally
beautiful.
Perfect.
STUDIO GATE - MORNING
Outside the studio entrance, a swarm of REPORTERS,
PHOTOGRAPHERS and FANS rush VIKTOR's limousine, hoping for a
glimpse of SIMONE.
MOB
Simone!
SIMONE!
I LOVE YOU!
I
Want to BE you!
Studio SECURITY GUARDS hold them back as the limo enters the
lot.
STUDIO - ENTRANCE - DAY
ELAINE and an entourage of EXECUTIVES greets VIKTOR's
limousine on the studio steps.
A STUDIO PHOTOGRAPHER has a camera at the ready.
A banner
reads, "Welcome SIMONE".
A YOUNG ASSISTANT wheels a cake.
VIKTOR steps out of the car.
ELAINE pushes past him, into
the limo.
ELAINE
Simone!... Simone?
The car is empty.
ELAINE
(re-emerging from the car)
Where is she?
VIKTOR
Good to see you too, Elaine.
ELAINE
(ignoring his sarcasm)
Why isn't she with you?
VIKTOR
Why?
Because she would never show
up at something like this.
She's
intensely private.
Elaine sighs, exasperated.
ELAINE
(dismissing her
colleagues)
Back to work, everyone.
She's not
here.
The reception committee disperses, murmurs of disappointment.
ELAINE
Viktor... I want to thank you for
convincing Simone to sign with the
studio.
VIKTOR
Don't thank me.
It was entirely
Simone's decision.
Do you have
Simone's check?
ELAINE
I don't have it on me.
Anyway, it
means a lot.
(quickly changing tack)
Have you read the reviews?
They're
love letters.
(reading from a newspaper)
Listen to this one.
"Simone has
the voice of a young Jane Fonda,
the body of Sophia Loren, the grace
of, well, Grace Kelley, and the
face of Audrey Hepburn combined
with an angel".
VIKTOR
(musing to himself)
Almost right.
ELAINE
I can't wait to meet her.
VIKTOR
I don't know if that's going to
happen.
ELAINE
(confused)
Why not?
VIKTOR
As I say, she's... something of a
recluse.
That's how she's able to
stay so pure -- by isolating
herself in her art.
ELAINE
(face falling)
Don't be ridiculous.
I arranged a
press conference.
VIKTOR
Out of the question.
A circus like
that?
ELAINE
Viktor, it's my studio.
VIKTOR
She's my actor.
There are other
studios, Elaine.
There's only one
Simone.
(leaving her on the steps)
Leave the press conference to me.
Viktor strides up the studio steps.
Elaine stares after her
ex-husband -- she finds herself smiling at his newfound
arrogance.
STUDIO - PRESS CONFERENCE - DAY
The studio soundstages as a backdrop, VIKTOR approaches a
podium and a forest of microphones, revelling in his recent
fame by association.
VIKTOR
(tapping the microphone)
Is this on?
REPORTER 1
Who are you?
VIKTOR
Taransky, Viktor.
T-a-r-a-n-s-k-y,
V-i-k-t-o-r.
REPORTER 1
Yeah, but -- who are you?
VIKTOR
(patronizing smile)
I am a two-time Academy Award
nominated director with over
eighteen films to my credit thus
far including my latest release,
"Sunrise, Sunset".
Who are you?
A REPORTER rolls her eyes at his pomposity.
VIKTOR
I will not be taking any questions.
However I do have a statement to
read on behalf of my leading lady,
Simone.
(reading from his
statement)
"To Whom It May Concern.
I'm
deeply grateful for the
extraordinary public response to
Mr. Taransky's film.
At this time
I will be conducting no interviews
or making publicity appearances
since I am really nothing without
the beautiful worlds and characters
Mr. Taransky creates for me.
I
politely request that the press
respect my privacy and let the work
speak for itself.
All questions
and inquiries should be directed to
Mr. Taransky to whom I entrust all
aspects of my career.
Yours very
truly, Simone".
The reporters all call out at once.
REPORTER 2
-- Viktor, Viktor, who's Simone
dating?
REPORTER 3
-- Viktor, where'd you find her?
REPORTER 4
-- Is Simone her real name?
REPORTER 5
-- What's she got to hide?
REPORTER 1
-- Is she the new Garbo?
REPORTER 2
-- Who's Garbo?
Viktor silences the reporters by theatrically raising his
hands.
VIKTOR
I thought I made it clear -- no
questions regarding Simone.
(bringing the press
conference to a hasty
conclusion)
Now, I would like to close by
announcing that Miss Simone begins
production today on her next film,
"Eternity Forever".
This project
has been near and dear to my heart
since I wrote it nine years ago.
(a tinge of bitterness,
then a smile)
I Thank you.
Viktor exits the podium.
A voice stops him in his tracks.
VOICE (O.S.)
Who do you think you're fooling,
Taransky?
Viktor turns.
The voice belongs to over-zealous, crusading,
truth-seeking investigative reporter, MAX SAYER, accompanied
by his assistant, MILTON.
VIKTOR
Do I know you?
MAX
Max Sayer -- National Echo.
VIKTOR
(regaining his composure,
a smirk)
Don't you have a real story to
write?
Why aren't you in Latin
America?
MAX
This is the story.
VIKTOR
I remember when the Echo had class
-- the paper that could bring down
governments.
MAX
Our leaders aren't presidents
anymore -- they're pop stars and
screen idols.
If Woodward and
Bernstein were alive today, they'd
be right here in Hollywood with me.
VIKTOR
They are alive, Sayer.
Milton confirms that Woodward and Bernstein are still living.
MAX
So they're probably here.
(hardly missing a beat)
You might be able to sell this
'disappearing act' to the rest of
the world, but I'm not buying it.
What's really behind this Simone
woman?
The public has a right to
know.
Why is she staying out of
sight?
And why the hell is she
with you?
I don't want you to take
this the wrong way, Viktor, but
you're not exactly Cecil B.
DeMille -- more run-of-the-mill.
VIKTOR
Maybe the reason she's with me is a
little thing called integrity,
Sayer.
Look it up.
Viktor walks away.
MAX
(calling after him)
Oh, I know all about integrity.
I
know even more about persistence.
Look that one up.
Max watches Viktor depart, with obvious suspicion.
SOUNDSTAGE - STUDIO LOT - DAY
A large satellite dish sits atop a soundstage.
"CLOSED SET" is the sign on the door -- a surveillance camera
panning the entrance.
A SECURITY GUARD, also keeping watch,
nods a greeting to VIKTOR as he pulls up in his studio golf
cart, script in hand.
SECURITY GUARD
No one came in or went out just
like you said, Mr. Taransky.
VIKTOR
Good.
SECURITY GUARD
Is Miss Simone coming today?
VIKTOR
She's already here.
She arrived
before you and she'll leave long
after you've gone.
(admonishing guard)
Remember, under no circumstances
are you or any other person to
enter the set without my express
permission.
SECURITY GUARD
What if it catches on fire?
VIKTOR
Let it burn.
Simone would rather
go up in flames than give up her
privacy.
Viktor enters his secret code into the keypad lock and enters
the soundstage.
STUDIO LOT - DAY
VIKTOR's face against the SKY.
As he walks, we reveal that
the sky is no more than a huge, painted backdrop on the
studio lot -- behind a parking lot.
Viktor hands his valet
ticket to a fawning VALET MANAGER.
VALET MANAGER
-- Just be a minute, Mr. Taransky.
We gave you a complimentary car
wash -- they're washing the engine
now.
Viktor joins other industry MOVERS and SHAKERS waiting for
their cars under an umbrella.
A young TALENT AGENT
approaches.
TALENT AGENT
Viktor!
Look, I'm sorry I didn't
call you back last year.
I was,
er... out of the country.
(strained moment)
But we should get together.
My
schedule's wide open.
VIKTOR
Sure, I'll... "call you".
The agent's face falls.
He gets in his car, disconsolate.
Suddenly, HAL SINCLAIR, rushes over and hugs Viktor.
HAL
Viktor, I'm so happy for us!
VIKTOR
Hello, Hal.
HAL
The film.
The chemistry.
No
reflections on Nicola but Simone
and I -- we were just so right
together.
VIKTOR
You never were together, Hal.
HAL
And still the connection was
undeniable.
(aside)
I haven't read "Eternity Forever"
but I know it's brilliant.
And I
know I would be perfect for Clive.
VIKTOR
(correcting him)
Clyde.
HAL
Yes, perfect.
(lowering his voice)
As a matter of fact, I ran into
Simone on the lot the other day.
VIKTOR
(genuinely startled)
Really?
She didn't mention it.
HAL
(quickly covering)
I'm sure she's meeting with a lot
of people right now.
(under his breath)
She is just as you described her,
Viktor... indescribable.
I
strongly sensed she thought I was
right for it.
Behind his back, Viktor surreptitiously presses a button on
his cell phone.
The phone rings.
Viktor feigns surprise and
answers.
VIKTOR
(answering the phone he
has just dialed, louder
than necessary)
Hello?... SIMONE!
How are you,
sweetheart?
A hush descends over the executives.
Hal is suddenly very
uncomfortable.
Even the VALETS strain to eavesdrop on the
conversation.
VIKTOR
(winking to Hal)
You'll never guess who I'm with...
you ran into him on the lot.
HAL
It was more in passing.
VIKTOR
You're so far off!
(finally chuckles)
Hal... Hal Sinclair... your co-
star.
Remember now?... No, I don't
think he's put on weight.
(a shrug of apology to the
appalled Hal)
Anyway, you think he's right for
"Eternity Forever"?... not the
right type?... a different
direction...
(covering phone, to Hal)
I'll try to talk her into it.
The other INDUSTRY PEOPLE make a note of the remark.
A
mortified Hal excuses himself with a pathetic wave, climbing
into his car.
VIKTOR
(into phone)
... Listen this is a bad place to
talk... what?... sweetheart, I know
you have charity work you want to
do, I know you want to give back --
but remember, your greatest gift is
your talent... we'll talk about it
at the beach house this weekend...
I'm looking forward to it too.
Viktor hangs up.
His car pulls up.
He tips extravagantly
and drives away.
The INDUSTRY PEOPLE get on their cell
phones.
STUDIO LOT - FACADE - DAY
Parked behind the sky facade is a curious CAR with shaded
windows.
VIKTOR'S MALIBU HOUSE - MORNING
Boats are moored just off the beach packed dangerously full
of telephoto lens-toting PHOTOGRAPHERS.
The next door houses
have LENSES protruding through the drapes of the windows.
VIKTOR strides onto the lawn of his property that backs onto
the beach, soaking up the attention -- unable to resist
waving extravagantly.
Suddenly, a PHOTOGRAPHER, losing his balance, drops from a
nearby rooftop.
The photographer limps towards the fence.
Viktor calmly follows, retrieving the photographer's camera
and ripping out the film with a flourish -- he is clearly
relishing the attention.
The photographer clambers over the fence where he joins
several dozen other SHUTTER-BUGS and VIDEORAZZI.
PHOTOGRAPHER 1
That wasn't her, Taransky.
ECHO PHOTOGRAPHER
Where is she?
You can't hide her
forever.
VIKTOR
(hurling the camera into
the mob)
You'll never find her.
Simone only
appears when I want her to appear.
MAX SAYER from "The NATIONAL ECHO" is at the head of the mob,
accompanied by assistant MILTON.
MAX
She sounds like a prisoner,
Taransky.
Are you holding her
hostage?
Are you some kind of
Svengali?
VIKTOR
(recognizing the reporter)
Who's the hostage, Sayer, her or
you?
You look kind of "captive"
yourself.
While you're spending
every waking hour obsessing over
Simone, guess what, I guarantee she
doesn't even know you exist.
Get
off my property or I'll call the
cops.
MAX
The cops?
The cops read my column
to know who to bust.
We're the
only watchdog the public has.
(looking around at the
photographers)
None of this is going away.
We'll
be here tomorrow and the day after
that.
Until you slip up.
And you
will.
You are looking at your
shadow.
(getting in his face)
Because all these elaborate
precautions with Simone -- every
instinct in my body tells me, it's
not natural.
VIKTOR
I'm just trying to help you, Sayer.
I don't want you to be
disappointed.
It gets cold out
here at night.
MAX
Nice try.
If we can't get to her
through you, maybe your family will
be more co-operative.
I can
guarantee you, Taransky, one way or
another, Miss Simone and I are
going to get acquainted.
VIKTOR
(turning away)
I'd like to see that, Sayer.
Invite me.
ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
VIKTOR'S car pulls up to Elaine's imposing mansion.
LAINEY
gives her father a kiss and departs.
ELAINE, in the garden,
overseeing a GARDENER pruning roses, approaches.
VIKTOR
(from the car)
Sorry I didn't get her back in
time.
ELAINE
No problem.
(she smiles)
Do you want to come in?
VIKTOR
(surprised -- pleasantly)
Why not?
ELAINE'S MANSION - GARDEN - DAY
ELAINE's demeanor softens.
She speaks to VIKTOR quietly,
sympathetically.
ELAINE
Listen, Viktor... I want to talk to
you now, not as Elaine, studio
head, but Elaine, ex-wife.
(correcting herself)
Second ex-wife.
You got lucky this
last time but you need to be
careful.
We both know you wouldn't
be making this overblown art film
of you hadn't convinced Simone to
be in it.
VIKTOR
Elaine, talking to you now, not as
Viktor, director, but Viktor, ex
husband... what the hell happened
to you?
ELAINE
(exasperated)
Experience, Viktor.
I've seen this
a hundred times -- young stars
destroying the very people who
discovered them.
I'm worried about
you, that's all.
This woman -- she
controls your destiny.
VIKTOR
Simone does not control my destiny.
ELAINE
Viktor, I have a feeling.
One of
my feelings.
There's something
about her I don't trust.
From her bedroom window on the mansion's second floor, LAINEY
smiles at the sight of her mother and father together.
VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
VIKTOR pulls up sharply in his studio golf cart outside the
nearby soundstage and hurriedly enters.
SOUNDSTAGE - DUSK
VIKTOR removes his own garbage from his soundstage.
A young
cleaning woman, VIVIAN, wheeling a janitor's cart,
tentatively approaches.
VIVIAN
Mr. Taransky...
VIKTOR
(referring to the stage)
No one goes in there.
VIVIAN
Oh, I know.
Vivian hesitantly hands Viktor a publicity photo of SIMONE.
VIVIAN
If it's not too much trouble.
Could you...?
VIKTOR
Of course...
VIVIAN
(hesitant about broaching
the subject)
This last year I was... going
through some things.
(shaking her head at the
memory)
Awful, awful... things.
But when I
saw Simone in "Sunrise"... what she
did... in the scene in the
fireworks factory...
(face lighting up)
... suddenly everything made sense.
My friends, family, doctors --
nobody could reach me -- but
Simone, she really... spoke to me.
Viktor is touched by the heartfelt testimony.
VIKTOR
She'll be happy to sign it.
HOTEL - REAR ENTRANCE - NIGHT
VIKTOR stands at the rear entrance of the hotel with a leggy
YOUNG WOMAN wearing a coat over her head.
A HOTEL DOORMAN
keeps back the growing horde of REPORTERS.
Viktor's limousine waits at the curb.
The coated woman
starts towards the car but Viktor holds her back.
VIKTOR
Not yet.
(scrutinizing the crowd)
Where's "Matinee"?
There they are.
Okay, I think everyone's here.
Now!
Viktor and the young woman run the gauntlet to the car,
providing a perfect albeit restricted photo-op for the
paparazzi.
PHOTOGRAPHER 1
Simone!
ECHO PHOTOGRAPHER
Over here, sweetheart!
PHOTOGRAPHER 3
Come one Simone, take it off, baby!
PHOTOGRAPHER 4
We got a job to do!
The car door slams shut as the pack descends.
MAX SAYER and
MILTON are amongst the frustrated reporters.
The limo
screeches away.
A POLICE MOTORCYCLIST prevents anyone
following.
The frustrated REPORTERS assess their efforts.
PHOTOGRAPHER 1
I think I got a piece of her ear.
ECHO PHOTOGRAPHER
I didn't get shit.
MILTON
(emerging from the pack,
to Max)
Ten feet from a living Goddess...
FUTURISTIC LANDSCAPE - "ETERNITY FOREVER" - DAY
The finished scene with SIMONE and HAL plays ON A SCREEN.
STUDIO LOT - NIGHT
VIKTOR escorts ELAINE and LAINEY to Elaine's car parked
outside the theater.
LAINEY
(as she gets into the car)
Good-night, Daddy.
VIKTOR
(kissing Lainey good-bye)
Night, Lainey.
Elaine and Viktor linger a moment outside the car.
VIKTOR
(drawing Elaine aside)
Elaine, I don't know if it's a good
idea for Lainey to come to the
screenings -- mature content and
all that.
Both look to Lainey.
From inside the car Lainey watches her
parents.
ELAINE
(impressed by his
responsible attitude)
Maybe you're right.
(gently teasing)
Twelve years after your daughter's
born you decide to become a father.
VIKTOR
Better late than never.
ELAINE
(softening)
I should fire you more often.
The
film's looking wonderful.
VIKTOR
You really think so?
ELAINE
Yes.
To be honest I never quite
saw this film before -- maybe it's
the way Simone is playing it -- but
what it's saying about the illusion
of permanence in everyday life, how
that's the only way we can love --
I think it's really going to mean
something.
VIKTOR
Thank you.
I'll tell Simone you
liked it.
ELAINE
I'd love to tell her myself.
(cajoling)
When are you going to let me meet
her?
VIKTOR
Soon.
Soon.
ELAINE
Everyone I know has met her,
Viktor.
VIKTOR
Everyone you know is lying.
ELAINE
(amused)
That's true.
They instinctively kiss, more affectionate than before.
However, their embrace is interrupted by a click of a camera
shutter from a nearby bush.
VIKTOR
Damnit!
The PHOTOGRAPHER has gone but so has the mood.
ELAINE
You know how you can stop that.
She has to get out more.
(climbing into the car)
See you at the premiere.
Elaine climbs into her car and drives away.
PREMIERE - DUSK
The premiere for "ETERNITY FOREVER" is everything VIKTOR had
hoped for "SUNRISE, SUNSET".
Red carpet, klieg lights
searching the sky, screaming FANS and PAPARAZZI.
A limousine pulls up, door opens and VIKTOR steps out.
The
crowd screams with excitement.
Viktor waves.
Am expectancy in the crowd -- people crane
their necks, waiting for someone else to step out of the open
car door... but nothing.
The door shuts.
A disappointed
murmer.
The limo drives off.
VIKTOR walks down the carpet to little fanfare.
PREMIERE REPORTER 1
(talking to camera)
-- What a night!
Anyone who's
anyone is here at the premiere of
"Eternity Forever," but waiting for
Simone to show may take even
longer.
We do have her director,
Viktor Taransky.
(ushering him over)
Viktor, Viktor, is Simone coming?
VIKTOR
(slightly irritated by the
focus on the star)
You know Simone.
Other reporters force their way into the interview.
PREMIERE REPORTER 2
I hope she does show up.
Some of
her fans got here at dawn.
We
don't want to disappoint them.
VIKTOR
(through a pained smile)
Well, I'm sure they're going to
love the movie.
I got the
inspiration --
However, the reporter's attention has strayed.
PREMIERE REPORTER 2
HARRY EPSON!
The CAMERAS pivot away from Viktor.
Screen idol, HARRY
EPSON, is walking up the carpet.
PREMIERE REPORTER 2
Harry!
Harry!
Can we have a
minute?
What brings you here
tonight?
HARRY
(waving to the fans)
I just came out to support my good
friend, Simone.
PREMIERE REPORTER 2
There's a rumor that you're more
than just "good friends"?
HARRY
(slightly irritated by the
invasion)
We've been seeing each other, sure,
but we'd rather keep our
relationship private.
PREMIERE REPORTER 2
(believing she has a
scoop)
Do I hear the sound of... wedding
bells?
HARRY
(suddenly losing it)
I can't believe you people!
No
wonder she never comes to these
things!
Harry angrily pushes the camera away and strides up the
carpet.
VIKTOR watches him go, flabbergasted.
PREMIERE PARTY - NIGHT
A packed, glitzy party.
VIKTOR enters without an escort.
Despite his recent rise to prominence he appears strangely
alone.
He observes ELAINE, champagne in hand, and the younger KENT,
schmoozing with a group of industry MOVERS and SHAKERS.
MOVER/SHAKER
Elaine!
The picture is a
revelation!
ELAINE
Thank you.
I mean, it was a team
effort --
Viktor cannot resist taking Elaine's photo with a small
pocket camera.
Elaine is unaware of the shot.
Viktor turns away -- just as Elaine turns to look at him.
Viktor picks up a drink from the bar.
A DRUNK WOMAN, perched
unsteadily on a nearby barstool, is knocking back Jack
Daniels.
She accidentally brushes one of her discarded
glasses off the bar.
Viktor catches it.
A HAND taps Viktor on the shoulder.
HAL stands there
accompanied by his "Eternity Forever" co-star, MAC.
HAL
Is she here?
VIKTOR
I'm fine, Hal.
How are you?
HAL
(oblivious to his sarcasm)
Somebody said she was here.
Mac spots the two glasses in Viktor's hands -- one glass
lipstick-smeared.
MAC
Oh my God, that's her glass!
(impulsively smelling
"Simone's" glass)
Jack Daniels, straight-up.
She is
my kind of woman.
HAL
(looking anxiously around
the room)
Viktor, where is she?
VIKTOR
She's around.
MAC
(dawning on him, glancing
to the far side of the
packed room)
Jesus, Hal... she's in the Ladies
Room.
HAL
You know I sometimes forget she has
bodily functions.
VIKTOR
(unable to resist)
I know what you mean.
HAL
(anxiously looking to the
restroom)
I have to talk to her about my
experimental film.
It's very...
experimental.
MAC
Is that her? -- By the fountain.
Far across the party, a WOMAN, with a Simone-type hairstyle,
her back to us, is standing at the edge of a fountain.
VIKTOR
(testy)
No.
In fact, between us, she
doesn't really exist.
HAL
(ignoring him, calling out
to the woman)
Simone!
MAC
SIMONE!
Several nearby GUESTS, including ELAINE, overhear.
They talk
over each other.
GUEST 1
-- Simone's here!
ELAINE
(slightly the worse for
drink)
-- When did she arrive?
Why didn't
someone tell me?
GUEST 2
-- Where is she?
MAC
-- She's by the fountain.
GUEST 3
-- Simone, over here!
GUEST 4
-- Simone!
The rumor races through the party like wild-fire.
The GUESTS
surge towards the fountain in a wave of mindless adoration.
The Simone lookalike herself spins around.
LOOKALIKE WOMAN
Simone!
She gets knocked into the fountain.
Several other GUESTS
also fall in the stampede.
Back at the bar, the BARMAN, autograph book in hand, deserts
his station.
Viktor is left alone with the drunk woman.
LOCAL TV NEWS
The limousines outside the hotel ballroom have been replaced
with ambulances.
PARAMEDICS tend to GUESTS, bloodied and
battered in the stampede caused by Simone's "appearance".
ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER
(into microphone)
-- Forget "Eternity Forever", the
big news tonight was the surprise
appearance of Simone.
Even these
seen-it-all superstars are
apparently not immune to Simone
fever and the resulting stampede
forced organizers to bring the
event to an early end.
I spoke
with some of the departing guests
about their encounter with
Hollywood's most reluctant
superstar.
CUTS of interviews with VARIOUS bruised GUESTS.
EXECUTIVE 3
-- I would say, even more beautiful
in person, you have to see her to
believe her.
MALE GUEST 1
-- I can't reveal what we spoke
about.
It was... personal.
Simone
and I go back a long way.
FEMALE GUEST 1
-- When she talks to you, for that
moment, you are the only other
human being in the room.
FEMALE GUEST 2
(dress torn)
-- I really don't know what the
fuss is about.
So over-rated.
She's done one film.
Talk to me
when she's had the kind of career
I've had.
MALE GUEST 2
-- I do expect her to be nominated,
yes.
We return to the live shot of the ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER.
ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER
Fortunately, Simone was not amongst
the injured and was spirited away
as mysteriously as she arrived.
ECHO OFFICES - DAY
Max Sayer's car is parked outside of the Echo Building.
STUDIO LOT - DAY
"MILLION DOLLAR REWARD FOR PHOTO OF SIMONE!" -- Is the
headline on the cover of The ECHO.
VIKTOR is reading the
magazine as he makes his way through the studio lot.
He looks up to see several studio carts parked outside his
soundstage.
A group of STUDIO EXECUTIVES, led by ELAINE, is
trying to break into the "CLOSED SET".
VIKTOR runs towards
the door, throwing himself between the door and the
executives.
VIKTOR
-- You can't go in there!
ELAINE
-- We have to talk to her, Viktor!
EXECUTIVE 1
-- We know she's in there!
Viktor glares at the SECURITY GUARD who shrugs weakly.
VIKTOR
(struggling to hold them
back)
-- Why?
What's all this about?
EXECUTIVE 2
(waving a spreadsheet)
-- We've got the tracking numbers
for "Eternity Forever".
EXECUTIVE 3
-- They're in the toilet.
ELAINE
-- She has to get out there and
sell the film.
VIKTOR
-- What do you want her to do, go
door-to-door -- ?
EXECUTIVE 1
-- Even Garbo would be on the talk
show circuit if she was alive
today.
VIKTOR
(irritated)
-- It's precisely because she
doesn't crave the limelight that
people love her.
I told you, she's
only about the work.
EXECUTIVE 3
-- This is over-shadowing the work!
EXECUTIVE 2
(waving the front page of
The Echo)
That's the problem.
She's more
famous for her no-shows than her
shows.
ELAINE
-- It's starting to look like she
doesn't support the film or you,
Viktor.
(trying to squeeze past
Viktor)
If you can't handle her, I will.
VIKTOR
(blocking her path)
Not now.
She's emotional.
Her
mother dies today.
Scene forty-two
of "Good For Nothing".
It's not a
good time.
Elaine and the executives are not convinced, they overpower
Viktor.
VIKTOR
No!
Please, don't go in there!
Too late.
Elaine and the suits force the lock and enter.
NEW MEXICO DESERT - MORNING
The ECHO newscar streaks through the bronze and purple
desert.
MAX and his assistant MILTON emerge from the car.
MAX
-- I've been here before! -- On my
honeymoon with my ex-wife.
MILTON
Is that why she left you?
Max holds a video print of SIMONE giving her FRANK BRAND
interview.
He compares her desert location to the one in
front of him.
MAX
(pointing out a Joshua
tree)
You see, that's the exact same tree
and in the distance, there's the...
(voice trailing away)
... mountain.
Sure enough, the Joshua tree is identical but the mountain is
now obscured by a ten-story Holiday Inn.
Max and Milton are mystified -- they look back at the photo.
MILTON
It's a hotel.
MAX
I don't understand.
MILTON
Could they have built that hotel
since yesterday?
Max shakes his head, deeply concerned.
MAX
Get in the car.
FASTFOOD RESTAURANT - DAY
The photograph of Simone is emblazoned on a fast food drink
cup -- a pyramid of cups promoting "ETERNITY FOREVER" Happy
Meals.
Beneath the plastic pyramid is a SIMONE action figure
in a convertible.
DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY
A banner in a window reads.
"In Stock: SIMONE'S EASY-WEAR
FASHION".
Mannequins model the clothes.
OCEAN - DAY
CLOSE UP on the name "SIMONE" painted on the stern of a
luxury yacht.
VIKTOR is at the helm, breathing in the clean air -- at last
a moment to savor his success.
Simone's hit single plays on
the yacht's stereo.
He looks at peace.
MARINA - DAY
A TOURIST has his arm around SIMONE, having his photograph
taken.
However, we discover that the Simone is only a
lifesize cardboard cutout used by a STREET VENDOR to sell
snapshots.
He also has cardboard cutouts of the POPE and
ELVIS.
MAX SAYER and MILTON walk by.
Tying up his boat, VIKTOR's mood is abruptly shattered by the
sight of Max and Milton walking down the pier towards him.
MAX
Nice boat, Taransky.
VIKTOR
It's a yacht.
MAX
I know what you're up to.
VIKTOR
(pushing past Max)
I don't have time for this, Sayer.
MAX
I think you do.
(holding up his video
print of Simone in the
desert)
I know it's a fake.
Viktor freezes.
MAX
Got your attention now?
Max compares the shot to one of the current desert location
with the Holiday Inn in front of the mountain.
MAX
(referring to the
photographs)
It's bogus.
You used an old
library shot for the background.
VIKTOR
(ashen)
The background is.
MAX
She was never in New Mexico.
She
never left the studio.
Viktor is relieved that Max is only accusing him of faking
the background.
MAX
(referring to a large
bundle of other shots
under his arm)
I've done my homework.
I've
studied her.
VIKTOR
-- I bet you have.
MAX
-- I've looked at every piece of
publicity she's ever done, the
video in the supermarket, there's
no evidence she's ever left the
studio.
(afterthought)
Oh, and for some reason this woman
leaves no paper trail.
But I have
"obtained" a copy of your bank
accounts.
I know you have power of
attorney but so far you haven't
transferred one single solitary
cent to her.
VIKTOR
I'm keeping it in trust.
MAX
I know that's what you'd like us to
believe.
But I got to tell you --
embezzlement is a serious matter.
Not to mention abduction.
VIKTOR
Abduction?
MAX
I don't buy the whole recluse scam.
How are you doing it?
What is it --
drugs?
Blackmail?
Mind-control?
All three?
What do you do -- keep
her locked in a box somewhere?
Viktor flinches at the remark.
VIKTOR
What is it exactly you want, Sayer?
MAX
I want to see her.
Unless you show
me Simone live and in person I show
these pictures to the authorities.
Viktor pauses, considering the threat.
VIKTOR
Alright, Sayer, you've got a deal.
MAX
Er,... good.
MILTON
That's good.
Viktor walks away leaving Max confused.
The breeze whips the photos of SIMONE out of Max's hands and
into the sea.
STADIUM - NIGHT
In the shadow of the enormous stadium sits a control
truck/tour bus, satellite dishes on the roof -- the lights
from the laser-show inside the arena play off the truck.
The
control truck shakes from the stomping of the crowd.
CROWD
... SI-MONE!
SI-MONE!
SI-MONE!...
The door to the truck is marked, "SIMONE - Splendid Isolation
Tour.
NO ENTRY".
VARIOUS LOCATIONS - NIGHT/DAY
A)
On a jumbotron in Tokyo SIMONE's concert plays LIVE.
B)
On a TV set on a West African beach, children dance to
SIMONE.
C)
On a computer in a Bombay taxi, the driver and his
passengers gyrate to SIMONE webcast.
STADIUM - EXIT - NIGHT
A bin contains dozens of confiscated cameras and binoculars.
FANS exit the stadium through a tunnel.
S-I-M-O-N-E is spelt out on the bare chests of six TEENAGE
BOYS.
Other FANS wear "SIMONE - Splendid Isolation Tour"
T-shirts and carry posters.
Several CONCERT GOERS speak to a
TV NEWS CREW.
FAN 1
-- I swear, she looked right at me.
FAN 2
-- She was, like, ethereal.
FAN 3
-- One moment she seemed to walk
right through her mike stand like
it wasn't even there.
CONTROL TRUCK - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
ELAINE and LAINEY stand at the foot of the trailer, a
SECURITY GUARD nearby.
VIKTOR
(face brightening)
My two favorite girls.
ELAINE
Lainey and I just wanted to
congratulate...
Regarding Viktor closely, Elaine's smile evaporates.
ELAINE
... Simone.
VIKTOR
She's lying down.
She's exhausted.
ELAINE
(suddenly cool)
I can imagine.
Viktor is confused by their reaction.
Elaine yanks Lainey
away.
ELAINE
Thank Simone for the tickets.
LAINEY
(calling back as she is
led away)
It was a great show, Dad...
Viktor waves disconcertedly.
VIKTOR
Where are you... going?
As he returns to the trailer, Viktor catches sight of his
lipstick-smeared mouth in the mirror on the inside of the
trailer door.
He slams the side of the trailer in
frustration.
VIKTOR'S MALIBU HOUSE - BEACH - DAY
VIKTOR, deep in thought, stands at the water's edge, staring
at the breaking waves.
LAINEY joins him.
VIKTOR
Hey, Lainey.
(gently teasing her)
How's your love life?
LAINEY
I do okay.
How about you?
VIKTOR
You know me -- married to my work.
LAINEY
I noticed.
An awkward silence.
LAINEY
Dad, you know I don't like to get
between you and mom but she's
feeling down right now.
She broke
up with Kent.
VIKTOR
(buoyed by the news)
Really?
Too bad.
LAINEY
She thinks you're with Simone.
VIKTOR
Lainey, you know Simone and I don't
have a real relationship.
LAINEY
I know but Mom doesn't.
Maybe if
it came from Simone, if Simone
spoke to Mom -- she could
straighten things out.
(shrug)
Dinner, maybe.
VIKTOR
Dinner?
Dinner's difficult.
A
phone call?
LAINEY
Too impersonal.
They have to meet
face-to-face.
VIKTOR
I'll see what I can do.
(a thought occurs)
You know, Lainey.
I don't believe
you've ever once asked to meet
Simone.
Don't you like her?
LAINEY
I love her but that doesn't mean I
need to meet her.
Viktor is confused.
LAINEY
Why?
So I can tell my friends at
school -- as if that validates my
life somehow.
What's Simone going
to say to a fourteen-year-old
anyhow?
She's going to be polite
because you're my father but we're
not suddenly going to become
friends -- we have nothing in
common.
It's not going to be real.
Anyhow, she gets more beautiful in
my head every day.
Why kill the
dream?
What do they say, "don't
get too close to your idols, they
always disappoint you".
Viktor gazes in wonder at his daughter, so much wiser than
her years.
VIKTOR
I love you, Lainey.
LAINEY
I love you too, daddy.
A car horn sounds outside the house.
LAINEY
That's Mom.
(kissing him on the
forehead)
See you.
She exits, leaving Viktor deep in thought.
LOS ANGELES FREEWAY - DAY
Milli Vanilli's "GIRL YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE" plays on a car
radio.
ELAINE, wearing a red power suit, drives home along
the freeway in bumper-to-bumper traffic.
Her car phone
rings.
She turns down the radio and picks up.
ELAINE
Hello?
SIMONE
Hello, is this Elaine?
ELAINE
Yes -- oh my, God.
Is that you,
Simone?!
I've been wanting to talk
to you.
SIMONE
Well, here I am.
(beat)
You look pretty today.
Red suits
you.
ELAINE
(looking around the
freeway)
Where are you?
SIMONE
Right beside you.
I borrowed
Viktor's car.
Elaine looks to the inside lane.
SIMONE, wearing sunglasses,
phone to her ear, drives alongside.
Simone waves, somewhat
mechanically.
Elaine waves back.
They keep driving as they
talk.
FREEWAY SHOULDER - LATER IN THE DAY
VIKTOR anxiously watches a HIGHWAY PATROLMAN writing up the
fender-bender.
However, the Patrolman is more interested in
the Simone mannequin.
PATROLMAN
You don't have to explain.
I know
what the press is like.
Lunatics.
Out of control.
(referring to the Simone
mannequin)
You do know I'm going to have to
take this?
VIKTOR'S MALIBU HOME - NIGHT
VIKTOR also spies an OLD WOMAN in a wheelchair sitting beside
the car, MILTON closeby.
Viktor stops at the gate and
reluctantly exits his car.
VIKTOR
What now, Sayer?
MAX
(smug smile, noticing
Viktor noticing the
woman)
Looks familiar, doesn't she?
No
one comes from nowhere, Taransky.
You turn over enough rocks...
The old woman appears drugged, stares into space.
MAX
I traced her to a nursing home.
A
young woman fitting Simone's
description dropped her off five
years ago.
VIKTOR
She looks a lot like you.
MAX
(undeterred)
She hasn't uttered a word that
whole time -- until she saw the big
show.
Max produces a shot of SIMONE at the Oscars and holds it in
front of the old lady.
OLD LADY
(pointing to Simone's
picture, catatonic)
My baby... My baby...
MAX
(putting his hand on his
heart)
Who would think that "Saint Simone"
would abandon her own mother?
I've
been looking into the family
history -- heartbreaking.
Most
likely a biography to run over four
issues... who knows, maybe there's
a Pulitzer in there somewhere.
Viktor produces his own driver's license and holds it in
front of the old lady.
OLD LADY
(pointing to Viktor's face
on the driver's license)
My baby... My baby...
Max hastily steps between Viktor and the Old Lady.
MAX
That doesn't prove a thing -- wait
until I get a court order for a
blood test.
VIKTOR
(sensing an opportunity)
That won't be necessary.
(pretending to be
resigned)
Sooner or later I knew you'd crack
this thing, Max.
You got me.
MAX
I do?
(recovering)
Sure I do.
(taking Viktor aside)
Can we speak off the record?
I'm a
fair man.
I'm willing to sit down
with her and tell her side of the
story.
VIKTOR
I wouldn't want you to compromise
your ethics.
MAX
No.
Thanks.
Absolutely.
Viktor regards the newshound with a look of pity.
VIKTOR
You love her, don't you, Max?
MAX
Don't you?
VIKTOR
(writes a check, hands it
to Max)
This should take care of Mother.
Viktor drives into his home.
Max, very confused, stares at
the old lady.
VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
VIKTOR escorts LAINEY, blindfolded, around the corner of his
soundstage.
He removes the blindfold.
From Lainey's point-
of-view we see the sportscar Simone drove in "ETERNITY
FOREVER" -- the car tied with a bow.
VIKTOR
Happy birthday, Lainey.
Do you
like it?
LAINEY
(taking in the car)
It's fantastic -- it's too much.
VIKTOR
It's the car she drove in "Eternity
Forever".
LAINEY
I know.
Thank her for me.
VIKTOR
(disappointed by her
reaction)
It's from both of us.
Of course
you'll have to drive it around the
lot until you get your permit --
Lainey averts her gaze.
LAINEY
-- I can't accept it.
I don't want
a car, Dad.
VIKTOR
(clearly hurt, not
understanding)
Why not?
I can get you something
else.
What do you want?
LAINEY
The old Viktor Taransky.
(finally blurting it out)
I liked you better before -- before
all this.
You were a loser, Dad,
but at least you had integrity.
I
can't stand to see you like this --
clinging to Simone's coattails --
it used to be about the work, and
now it's all about her.
And then
she's not even grateful enough to
thank you.
VIKTOR
No, that was me.
LAINEY
There you go again, blaming
yourself.
Can't you see what she's
done to you -- she's taking
advantage, mocking you.
You
deserve better than Simone.
(hasty exit)
I've got to go, Dad.
VIKTOR
Lainey...
Viktor watches Lainey depart towards the studio gates.
SWIMMING POOL - DAY (ON VIKTOR'S SCREEN)
Old home video of ELAINE.
She is in a garden by a swimming
pool, laughing, waving and sweetly flirting with the camera.
Elaine raises her skirt teasingly, winks, gestures the camera
operator towards her with a beckoning finger, finally blows a
kiss to the camera.
CEMETERY - DAY
An inscription on a headstone reads:
HANK ALENO
Remembered Virtually Forever
VIKTOR kneels at HANK's grave.
He places a bunch of flowers
there.
VIKTOR
(referring to the flowers)
They're plastic, Hank.
I know
that's the way you'd want it.
(glancing to a Simone
billboard outside the
cemetery wall)
She killed you, Hank.
Now she's
killing me.
She's a serial killer.
(ducking out of sight of
the billboard as if
Simone is watching him)
But I don't know how to stop her.
She's taken on a life of her own.
I can't just come clean -- make
some confession.
I've defrauded
millions -- they'd turn on me.
And
I can't put the genie back in the
bottle.
If she stopped working --
dropped out of sight, they'd never
let it rest.
I've tried to kill
her career but they like her even
more.
(more desperate)
What am I going to do, Hank?
A thought occurs to Viktor.
He slowly rises from behind
Hank's headstone, revealing a forest of headstones.
VIKTOR
Don't say another word, Hank.
You
are truly a genius.
SANTA MONICA BAY - DUSK
Viktor's yacht sits at anchor in the glassy waters of Santa
Monica Bay -- "SIMONE" written on the stern.
VIKTOR manhandles the trunk to the railing.
A mournful pause
-- then he heaves it over the side.
The trunk sinks like a
stone.
Heart heavy, Viktor stares into the inky depths.
STUDIO - ENTRANCE - DAY
A throng of REPORTERS and CAMERA CREWS.
A somber VIKTOR
enters and takes a seat in front of a forest of microphones.
VIKTOR
It is my sad and solemn duty to
announce the tragic passing of
Simone.
A gasp from the audience.
Then, an explosion of anguish.
CROWD
No!!
What happened?!
Oh.
God.
PRESS REPORTER 1
(stepping forward,
mustering the courage to
ask the question)
How did she die?
VIKTOR
A rare virus.
(pretending to compose
himself)
On her goodwill tour of the third
world.
PRESS REPORTER 2
Did she suffer?
VIKTOR
Mercifully, it was quick.
At the back of the room are MAX SAYER and MILTON.
They are
frozen in grief, a tear spills from Max's eye.
A MONTAGE OF SCENES:
A)
"SIMON GONE - FADE TO BLACK", reads the cover of Variety.
B)
The announcement of her death appears on local TV news
shows around the globe.
C)
A carpet of bouquets and notes of commiseration several
yards wide completely surrounds Viktor's property
including the driveway.
VIKTOR insensitively drives over
the bouquets to the horror of the MOURNERS, including MAX
SAYER and MILTON.
D)
In a remote Mongolian encampment MONGOL HORSEMEN crowd
around a television showing a live picture of Simone's
funeral.
E)
The HEARSE carrying Simone's "body" and the funeral
procession led solemnly by VIKTOR, proceeds through the
studio lot.
Distraught STUDIO STAFF toss flowers onto
the hearse.
F)
The same television picture is playing on a television
sitting on a stool in a WEST AFRICAN river.
LOCAL WOMEN
stop washing their clothes to watch.
GRAVESIDE - CEMETERY - DAY
We tilt up from Hank's headstone to an ornate mausoleum on an
island in a lake.
Simone's coffin is ferried across a bridge by PALLBEARERS
from the studio.
Numerous MOURNERS follow behind.
VIKTOR, ELAINE and a curiously dry-eyed LAINEY walk behind
the coffin.
VIKTOR
(to Elaine)
Can I see you later -- go away for
the weekend?
ELAINE
(horrified by the
suggestion)
How can you bring that up at a time
like this?
The coffin reaches the steps of the marble mausoleum.
A
PRIEST, RABBI, and a BUDDHIST MONK turn to Viktor.
He nods
and they start to carry the coffin towards the door.
However, the coffin is suddenly stopped by a POLICE OFFICER.
A SECOND POLICE OFFICER begins to jimmy open the lid.
The
coffin lid is pulled back.
Inside is a life-sized cardboard
standee of Simone from "ETERNITY FOREVER".
The MOURNERS gasp.
Everyone looks to Viktor.
MARINA PIER - NIGHT (ON TV SCREEN)
VIKTOR dragging his trunk from his car down the pier to his
yacht.
DETECTIVE
It's footage from the marina's
closed-circuit camera on the night
in question.
Altered, of course.
Is that really what you expect us
to believe, Mr. Taransky?
The Detective freezes the tape.
DETECTIVE
Can you tell us why you were
disposing of the body of a woman
who didn't exist?
VIKTOR
It wasn't her body.
It was her
body of work.
DETECTIVE
Why don't you just come clean,
Viktor?
Tell the truth.
You'll
feel better afterwards.
VIKTOR
I am telling the truth.
DETECTIVE
(coming close to him)
We all know what happened.
In a
fit of jealous rage you killed
Simone and dumped her body off a
boat she bought for you.
VIKTOR
No!!
I can prove it to you.
I'll
take you to her.
BOAT - SANTA MONICA BAY - DAY
VIKTOR sits handcuffed on a POLICE BOAT with the DETECTIVE
and his LAWYER.
DIVERS surface with the steamer trunk.
Viktor's face lights up.
The trunk is winched aboard.
However, as it lowers onto the
deck, we see the latch has broken and the lid is ajar.
All
eyes stare inside the trunk as the lid is lifted.
Apart from
a scrawny piece of kelp -- empty.
VIKTOR
(panicky, desperately
grabbing the divers)
Did you find anything else --
drivers, discs... disc-drives?
DIVER 1
Nothing.
(gazing to the water)
We couldn't stay down any longer.
All eyes follow the diver's gaze to several SHARK FINS in the
water.
CLOSE UP ON FRONT PAGE OF L.A. TIMES:
"SIMONE"S BODY FEARED EATEN BY SHARKS"
The newspaper is being read by Viktor's LAWYER, sitting
opposite Viktor in his cell.
VIKTOR is numb -- the
likelihood of conviction slowly dawning on him.
LAWYER
-- Plead guilty and throw yourself
on the mercy of the court.
It's
the best deal you're going to get.
VIKTOR
(incredulous)
I could get the death penalty.
LAWYER
You certainly will if you go to
trial -- a jury in this kind of
ugly mood.
You've killed an icon,
for God's sake.
VIKTOR
I didn't kill anyone, Bernard,
there was no one to kill!
LAWYER
(musing)
An insanity defence.
STUDIO LOT - DAY (ON TV SCREEN)
The brief clip shows the front page of the L.A. Times --
headlines: "HOLLYWOOD SUSPENDS FILMING IN MEMORY OF SIMONE"
and "D.A. Seeks Death Penalty for Taransky".
The reader lowers the newspaper to reveal herself -- SIMONE,
on the studio lot, looking more beautiful than ever.
She
winks to the camera.
VBC ANCHOR
... Simone reading today's edition
of the L.A. Times.
Who says, "The
only bad publicity is your
obituary"?
Details at the top of
the hour.
The TV is switched off.
Viktor stares at the screen, trying
to take it in.
VIKTOR
You're indestructible.
When he looks back to the Detective, he discovers him holding
the cell door open.
DETECTIVE
(shaking his head in pity)
I'll never get you Hollywood
people.
L.A. COUNTY JAIL - DAY
A throng of REPORTERS, PAPARAZZI and ONLOOKERS parts like a
sea for VIKTOR, released from custody.
One placard reads,
"ASK JESUS TO SAVE YOU NOW".
He is escorted to a waiting
limousine where he is met by ELAINE and LAINEY.
He hugs them
both.
