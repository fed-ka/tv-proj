It is a neat and tidy little room. Few posters or books.
CHARLIE is 15. He is innocent, hopeful, awkward, and likable
to everyone but his classmates. He sits at his desk, writing
a letter in pencil as he tapes the title song through the
radio on his cassette boom box.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
Dear Friend, I am writing to you because
she said you listen and understand and
didn't try to sleep with that person at
that party even though you could have.
Please don't try to figure out who she is
because then you might figure out who I
am, and I don't want you to do that. I
just need to know that people like you
exist. Like if you met me, you wouldn't
think I was the weird kid who spent time
in the hospital. And I wouldn't make you
nervous.

Charlie anxiously walks through the hallway of his suburban
split level house.
2.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
I hope it's okay for me to think that.
You see, I haven't really talked to
anyone outside of my family all summer.
Charlie moves to the living room where dad watches a football
game. Mom reads a page turner and sips her white wine.
Charlie waits for them to notice him. And waits. And waits.

Charlie sits at his desk, continuing his letter in pencil.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
But tomorrow is my first day of high
school ever, and I really need to turn
things around this year.
(hopeful)
So, I have a plan.
5
5
We see it in Charlie's mind. Slow motion and wondrous. The
kids clear out their lockers by throwing their old papers in
the air like a New York confetti parade.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
As I enter the school for the first time,
I will visualize what it will be like on
the last day of my senior year.
Charlie walks down the hall.
Triumphant.
Confident.
Happy.
CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Unfortunately, I counted, and that's...
SMASH CUT TO:
6

Reality. The bell rings, and we see the chaotic maze from
Charlie's POV. A SENIOR BULLY leads the ritual, making
dozens of freshmen hop down the hall.
SENIOR BULLY
Hop, freshman toads. Hop!
Move it, boys!
As seniors grab more victims, Charlie moves to the wall.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
... 1,385 days from now.
VARSITY FOOTBALL PLAYERS pass, wearing their letter jackets.
3.
LINEBACKER
Man, you got big.
NOSE TACKLE
Worked out all summer.
Rock hard, dude.
At the front of the pack is BRAD HAYS (17), the quarterback.
He's good looking, charismatic, and friendly. The big man on
campus. Nice guy, too.
BRAD HAYS
Would you guys get a room?
They laugh. Charlie turns to the trophy case to avoid them.
Trying to make himself as small as possible.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
(trying to be optimistic)
Just 1,385 days.

Charlie moves down the lunch line with his sister. CANDACE
KELMECKIS is 17 and a beautiful type A, straight A priss.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
In the meantime, I'd hoped that my sister
Candace and her boyfriend Derek would
have let me eat lunch with their earth
club.
CANDACE
Seniors only.
(barks to Derek)
What are you doing with a plastic spork?
Candace turns to her boyfriend, DEREK, 17. Derek is such a
pussy, the most masculine thing about him is his pony-tail.
DEREK
I don't want to bring back silverware--
CANDACE
Derek, you're Earth Club Treasurer.
Derek takes the silverware like a beaten dog. Charlie
watches them move into the intimidating cafeteria.

Charlie sits in the corner alone, observing everyone having a
great time with their friends. He sees a pretty girl with
blonde hair having the best first day. This is SUSAN, 14.
4.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
When my sister said no, I thought maybe
my old friend Susan would want to have
lunch with me.
Charlie catches her eye and waves, but she looks away.
CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
In middle school, Susan was very fun to
be around, but now she doesn't like to
say hi to me anymore.
Charlie turns his attention to the quarterback, Brad Hays.
CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
And then there's Brad Hays, who's the
quarterback of our team. Before my
brother went to play football for Penn
State, he and Brad played together. So,
I thought maybe he'd say hi to me. But
Brad's a senior, and I'm me, so... who am
I kidding?
Brad catches Charlie staring at him.
Awkward.

Charlie sits by himself, watching the freshmen boys laugh as
a senior paints a goatee on his face with a grease pencil.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
On the bright side, one senior decided to
make fun of the teacher instead of the
freshmen. He even drew on Mr. Callahan's
legendary goatee with a grease pencil.
Meet PATRICK (18), full of confidence, mischief, and so over
high school. He is the class clown, performing a perfect
imitation of the teacher, Mr. Callahan.
PATRICK
Boys, the prick punch is not a toy. I
learned that in 'Nam back in '68.
"Callahan," the sergeant said, "put down
that prick punch and go kill some gooks."
The laughter suddenly dies as the real MR. CALLAHAN (57)
walks up behind the oblivious Patrick.
PATRICK (CONT'D)
But you know what happened? That prick
punch killed my best friend in a Saigon
whorehouse.
5.
Patrick suddenly feels Mr. Callahan behind him.
Oops.
MR. CALLAHAN
I heard you were going to be in my class.
Are you proud being a senior taking
freshman shop, Patty-Cakes?
PATRICK
My name is Patrick. You call me Patrick
or you call me nothing.
MR. CALLAHAN
Okay... Nothing.
The class laughs. Except Charlie.
He watches Patrick take
the long walk back to his seat.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
I felt really bad for Patrick. He wasn't
saying the impersonation to be mean or
anything. He was just trying to make us
freshmen feel better.
MR. CALLAHAN
Everyone open your safety guides.
Nothing... why don't you read first?
Patrick opens the book.
PATRICK
Chapter 1. Surviving your fascist shop
teacher, who needs to put kids down to
feel big.
(to the class)
Oh, wow. This is useful guys. We should
read on.
Charlie smiles.
He loves him already.
10
10
The kids pass back paperback copies of To Kill A Mockingbird.
Charlie opens his Trapper Keeper, takes a pencil out of the
plastic pouch, and writes... "ENGLISH CLASS... DAY ONE."
CHARLIE (V.O.)
My last class of the day is advanced
English, and I'm excited to finally start
learning with the smartest kids in the
school...
A SMART ASS FRESHMAN girl with braces smiles at him.
6.
SMART ASS FRESHMAN
(whispers)
Nice Trapper Keeper, faggot.
The kids around him laugh. Charlie's ears turn red. At the
blackboard, the teacher writes his name... Mr. Anderson. But
you can call him BILL (27). Bill is an idealist.
BILL
Shhh. I'm Mr. Anderson. And thanks to
Teach for America, I'm going to be your
teacher for freshman English. This
semester, we're going to be learning
Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird.
Genius book. Now, who wants to get out
of the first pop quiz?
All hands go up.
Except Charlie's.
Bill paces the rows.
BILL (CONT'D)
I'm shocked. Alright. You can skip the
quiz if you tell me which author invented
the paperback book. Anyone?
As kids think, Bill confiscates contraband, removes hats.
BILL (CONT'D)
He's British. He also invented the
serial. In fact, at the end of chapter 3
of his first novel, he had a man hanging
off a cliff by his fingernails. Hence,
the term cliffhanger. Anybody?
FRESHMAN GIRL
Shakespeare.
BILL
That's a great guess, but no, Shakespeare
didn't write novels. Anybody else?
(off their silence)
The author was...
Bill is about to give the answer when he notices Charlie has
already written... Charles Dickens.
BILL (CONT'D)
... Charles Dickens. However, if you and
I had gone to a play in Shakespeare's
time, it would have cost 4 pennies. Can
you imagine that? We would have put
those pennies in a metal box, which the
ushers would lock in the office. And
that's where we get the term... anyone?
7.
KIDS (O.S.)
"Office Depot!" "Office Supplies!"
Charlie writes down Box Office, then looks up to find that
Bill is staring at him. Waiting for him to raise his hand.
BILL
I'll give you a free "A" on anything but
the final term paper if you get it right.
Charlie looks down.
He's not going to answer.
BILL (CONT'D)
Box office.
The kids groan. They should have known.
Charlie smiles to
himself. He's going to like this class.
11
11
The bell rings. The students chatter their way out of class.
The last to leave is Charlie.
BILL
You should learn to participate.
Charlie stops and turns to find Bill erasing the board.
BILL (CONT'D)
Why didn't you raise your hand?
(off Charlie's shrug)
They call you teacher's pet? Freak?
(off Charlie's nod)
I used to get spaz. I mean, come on,
spaz?
Charlie smiles.
Bill takes a moment.
Then...
BILL (CONT'D)
So, I heard you had a tough time last
year. But they say if you make one friend
on your first day, you're doing okay.
CHARLIE
Thank you, sir, but if my English teacher
is the only friend I make today, that
would be sort of depressing.
BILL
Yeah.
I could see that.
CHARLIE
Don't worry, Mr. Anderson.
I'm okay.
8.
Bill nods and watches Charlie exit.
He gets swallowed up by
the hallway as the bell rings.
12
12
Charlie looks through the thick office glass. He sees
Patrick use his charms on MRS. SMALL, (58) the Principal.
PATRICK
(to Mrs. Small)
I would happily not take shop...
Out of nowhere, the SENIOR BULLY grabs Charlie's book.
SENIOR BULLY
Hey, Freshman Toad.
The bully rips the cover. He throws it on the ground as his
friends laugh and disappear down the hall. Charlie walks up
and picks up his book.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
Well, I have 1,384 days to go. And just
so I say it to someone, high school is
even worse than middle school.
13
14
Charlie tapes his book cover back together. He looks up as
his dad comes home from a long day. Charlie's mom hugs him.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
If my Aunt Helen were still here, I could
talk to her. And I know she would
understand how I am both happy and sad,
and I'm still trying to figure out how
that could be. I just hope I make a
friend soon. Love always, Charlie.
15
15
Charlie stands in the kitchen, pouring his milk.
9.
MOTHER (O.S.)
Charlie, come on.
His family is seated around the table.
Candace's boyfriend,
Derek, is their special guest.
DEREK
Mmmm. This chicken paprikash is
delicious, Mrs. Kelmeckis.
Charlie's father rolls his eyes, then reads his sports page.
MOTHER
Thank you, Derek. It's Charlie's
favorite. He was a little nervous about
starting high school, so I made it.
FATHER
You feel a little silly being nervous
now, huh, champ?
CHARLIE
Yes, sir.
I sure do.
Charlie carries his milk back to the table.
He quickly sits,
hoping someone will change the subject.
FATHER
I told you. Just give 'em a smile and be
yourself. That's how you--
CANDACE
"--make friends in the real world."
FATHER
You're cruisin' for a bruisin'.
DEREK
Freshman year is tough, but you really
find yourself.
FATHER
(deep eye roll)
Thanks, Derek.
16
16
Charlie's father and mother watch a local sports show.
Charlie passes by them with ice cream on his way downstairs.
MOTHER
I think you could be a little nicer to
Derek.
10.
FATHER
I'm sorry.
The kid's a pussy.
I can't
stand him.
Charlie moves to the entry hall. He looks through the screen
door to the porch where Candace kisses Derek's cheek goodbye.
As Derek walks to his mom's Mercedes, Candace joins Charlie.
DEREK
(waving from car)
I hope you love the mix I made.
The
cover is hand-painted.
When he gets into his car, she hands Charlie the mix tape.
CANDACE
Charlie, do you want this?
CHARLIE
Are you sure?
CANDACE
He gives me one every week.
17
17
Charlie sits on his bed, reading To Kill a Mockingbird, the
cover taped back together. We see Derek's mix... Autumn
Leaves... rotate in his old tape recorder.
DEREK (V.O.)
Hey, Babe. This next one might be a
little sad, but it reminded me of your
eyes.
The first notes of The Smiths' "Asleep" begins.
As Morrissey
sings, Charlie keeps reading. And reading.
CUT TO:
18
18
The reading is done. Charlie proudly puts To Kill a
Mockingbird on his newly dubbed "Shelf of Fame."
19
19
The songs continues as we see glimpses of Charlie's day to
day life over the next few weeks. Charlie exits his English
class. FRESHMEN BULLIES wait for him, led by...
SMART ASS FRESHMAN
Did you already do the term paper on To
11.
Silence. They grab and drag him into the boy's room.
We
hear the toilet flush for the swirly.
20
20
Charlie looks at the new bottle of prescription Wellbutrin.
He puts a pill in his mouth and washes it down with RC cola.
21
21
Charlie watches his brother and the Penn State Nittany Lions
on TV. He looks over at his father, but his dad is too busy
building Charlie's clock for shop class to notice him.
22
22
Charlie carries his tray through the intimidating cafeteria.
Not giving up. Looking for somewhere to sit.
CUT TO:
23
23
Charlie sits by himself in the corner. He looks around the
cafeteria, wanting to break in. Not knowing how. After a
moment, he returns to his book. The song ends.
24
25
The Devils' faithful cheer as Brad Hays and his guys enter!
The place is packed. Patrick and Sam drink coffee while
Charlie eats his brownie. They're all excited.
SAM
Do you have a favorite band?
CHARLIE
I think The Smiths are my favorite.
SAM
Are you kidding!? I love The Smiths!
The best breakup band ever. What's your
favorite song?
CHARLIE
Asleep. It's from Louder Than Bombs. I
heard it on Pony Tail Derek's mix tape.
PATRICK
That works on so many levels.
CHARLIE
I could make a copy for you.
SAM
Thanks. What about Eide's?
You love
Eide's, right?
CHARLIE
(never heard of it)
Yeah. They're great.
PATRICK
Not a band, Charlie.
SAM
It's an old record store downtown.
15.
PATRICK
I used to be popular before Sam got me
some good music. So, watch out, Charlie.
She'll ruin your life forever.
CHARLIE
That's okay.
Brad Hays, the quarterback, passes with his posse.
Taunting.
NOSE TACKLE & LINEBACKER
Hey, Nothing. Hey, Nothing.
PATRICK
Let it go!
Jesus!
It's an old joke!
It's over!
Sam laughs.
She loves watching Patrick get riled up.
SAM
So, Charlie... what are you going to do
when you get out of here?
CHARLIE
My Aunt Helen said I should be a writer,
but I don't know what I'd write about.
SAM
You could write about us.
PATRICK
Yeah. Call it Slut and The Falcon.
Make
us solve crimes.
Sam laughs.
Charlie smiles.
CHARLIE
You guys look happy together. How long
have you been boyfriend and girlfriend?
(off their laughs)
What?
SAM
He's my step-brother. My mom finally
left my worthless dad and married his
nice dad 3 years ago.
PATRICK
But Sam's not bitter.
Make no mistake.
SAM
Absolutely. I'm not a bulimic.
I'm a
bulim-ist.
16.
They laugh at their inside joke.
Charlie has no idea what's
so funny.
CHARLIE
I'm sorry.
I don't know what that means.
PATRICK
She just really believes in bulimia.
SAM
(cracking up)
I love bulimia.
26
27
Charlie enters the house, excited to tell someone his news.
He runs up the stairs to find the living room empty. He
hears the TV playing downstairs in the basement.
28
28
As Charlie approaches, he hears muffled sounds of fighting.
DEREK (O.S.)
I'm sorry. I can't do anything about it.
Please talk to me.
17.
CANDACE (O.S.)
Maybe your mom and I should have a "drive
us to our hair appointment" contest.
Then, I could spend a Saturday with you.
Charlie looks through a slit in the open door to find...
DEREK
There's nothing I can do--
CANDACE
Do you always want to be a mama's boy?
DEREK
I am not a mama's boy--
CANDACE
Yes! You are! Every time I go to your
house--
DEREK
Shhh.
Shut u--
CANDACE
-- your mom says, "Don't go to Columbia
with Candace. Go to Pitt, Derek. Mommy
needs you to stay at home because she
can't drive herself." She's only 51.
DEREK
SHUT UP, CANDACE!
29
29
Charlie enters, wanting to stop the fight. Derek's neck is
red. Dangerous angry. Candace keeps digging.
CANDACE
And you just stand there like a little
bitch dog.
SNAP! Out of nowhere, Derek slaps her across the face. It's
not a movie slap. It's a real slap. Dead sound. And after
it, silence. Candace turns and sees Charlie. It sobers her
up. Charlie moves at Derek. Candace stops him.
CANDACE (CONT'D)
Charlie, just go. I can handle it.
Just
don't wake up mom and dad.
She pushes him out of the room and closes the door.
18.
30
30
Charlie sits at his desk. So disturbed. He hears a car
start outside. He moves to his window and looks down at
Derek and Candace near Derek's mother's Mercedes. Derek is
crying. Candace comforts. After a beat... they kiss.
Charlie stands frozen, a look creeping across his face.
MOTHER (V.O.)
Hey, look who's here...
FLASHBACK TO:
31
31
The door opens to reveal Charlie's mom and AUNT HELEN
entering the house. Aunt Helen carries a suitcase. The
children don't know where she's been or why she looks sad.
They just know they love her. Little Charlie stands at the
top of the stairs with his brother and sister in their Sunday
clothes. There are balloons. And streamers.
LITTLE CANDACE
Welcome home, Aunt Helen!
AUNT HELEN
Oh.
Look at you all, dressed so nice.
Aunt Helen smiles at Little Charlie on top of the stairs.
MATCH CUT TO:
32
32
Charlie stands at the top of the stairs as Candace enters the
house. She is startled when she sees Charlie. They whisper.
CHARLIE
What are you doing?
CANDACE
Look, I egged him on. You saw it. He's
never hit me before. I promise he'll
never hit me again.
She's about to go back downstairs when...
CHARLIE
Like Aunt Helen's boyfriends?
A silence passes between them.
Then...
19.
CANDACE
Charlie... this is Pony Tail Derek.
I
can handle him. Will you trust me?
Please, don't tell mom and dad.
With a desperately confident nod, Candace goes downstairs.
Charlie stands in the entry hall, troubled.
33
33
The Homecoming Dance is in full swing. God bless everyone.
Especially Charlie. He's alone at the wall, dressed in his
Sunday suit. To us, adorable. To himself, in living hell.
Charlie watches his sister, slow dancing with Derek. As
happy as she looks, Charlie still isn't sure if he did the
right thing by keeping quiet. The song ends to applause.
After a beat, Charlie turns away. That's when he sees Sam
and Patrick at the punch bowl. We hear the first notes of
"Come On, Eileen" by Dexy's Midnight Runners.
SAM
Oh, my God. They're playing good music.
PATRICK
Holy shit. They are!
They're playing
good music!
SAM
(total mischief)
Living room routine?
PATRICK
Living room routine!
Charlie watches Sam and Patrick run to the center of the
floor and show this stiff crowd what dancing is. It starts
slow. "So over it" hand moves. A little shoulder. And
then, the best of swing. 30 seconds of genius.
Charlie takes a breath. Then, he tries desperately not to
look like he's dancing toward them as he dances toward them.
He bobs his head like a dork. And once he gets close,
Patrick and Sam turn and find him.
SAM & PATRICK
Hey!
Without a pause, they grab his hands, and move together in a
circle. Their own island. After a moment, Sam moves around
Charlie like a maypole as the whole gym explodes into dance.
20.
34
35
21.
PATRICK
Charlie... this is a party.
The music blasts. Charlie's eyes are our guide. As they
walk through the crowd, you can smell it. Stale beer and
cigarette smoke. High school parties. The room is packed
*
with kids playing quarters. Others pouring vodka into a
watermelon.
PATRICK (CONT'D)
This is what fun looks like.
Patrick smiles when he spots two friends.
PATRICK (CONT'D)
You ready to meet some desperate women?
MARY ELIZABETH and ALICE (both 17) sit on the sofa together.
Mary Elizabeth is smart, a little overweight, and extremely
bossy. Alice will figure out that she's a lesbian in
college. Right now, she just likes movies and is Mary
Elizabeth's "beta female."
PATRICK (CONT'D)
Here, have a seat. Hey, ladies, meet
Charlie. Charlie, meet ladies.
They shake hands and say their hellos.
PATRICK (CONT'D)
This is Charlie's first party ever. So,
I expect nice, meaningful, heartfelt blow
jobs from both of you.
MARY ELIZABETH
Patrick, you're such a dick.
PATRICK
Where the hell did you go?
MARY ELIZABETH
The dance was a little boring, don't you
think?
PATRICK
You're so selfish. We looked everywhere
for you. You could have told someone.
MARY ELIZABETH
Cry me a river.
PATRICK
How is it that you got meaner since
22.
MARY ELIZABETH
Just lucky I guess.
PATRICK
I think you're doing something wrong.
MARY ELIZABETH
Or something very right.
Patrick and Mary Elizabeth laugh at their banter, just as Sam
calls out from the other side of the room.
SAM (O.S.)
Hey!
Look who's here!
The party turns, and Charlie sees Brad Hays, the quarterback,
enter with Sam and Bob. Patrick approaches them. Charlie
sits on the beat up couch next to the girls. He's shocked.
CHARLIE
Is that Brad Hays?
ALICE
Yeah.
He comes here sometimes.
CHARLIE
But he's a popular kid.
MARY ELIZABETH
(offended)
Then, what are we?
Charlie tries to think of something, but he can't.
The girls
turn, ignoring him. Bob approaches with a tray.
BOB
Charlie, you look like you could use a
brownie.
CHARLIE
Thank you. I was so hungry at the dance.
I was going to go to King's, but I didn't
really have any time. Thanks.
Bob smiles. Mary Elizabeth gives Alice a knowing glance.
Charlie bites into the brownie. The icing gushing between
his teeth. The image goes up into the smoke like an inhale
as he chews and chews and chews.
36
36
After a beat, the music changes, and the image exhales back
down to Charlie, who is now... baked out of his mind. The
23.
whole party surrounds him now, pissing themselves with
laughter as this shy kid talks and talks and talks.
CHARLIE
Have you guys felt this carpet?
This
carpet feels so darn good.
MARY ELIZABETH
(laughing)
Charlie, what do you think about high
school?
CHARLIE
High school? Bullshit. The cafeteria is
called the Nutrition Center. And people
wear their letter jackets even when it's
98 degrees out. And why do they give out
letters for marching band? That's not a
sport, and we all know it.
MARY ELIZABETH
This kid is crazy.
Charlie looks at Mary Elizabeth with her new wave haircut.
CHARLIE
And Mary Elizabeth, I think you're really
going to regret that haircut when you
look back at old photographs.
(off their laughter)
I'm really sorry. That sounded like a
compliment in my head.
MARY ELIZABETH
Oh, my God!
ALICE
Well, it's kind of true.
MARY ELIZABETH
Shut up!
Sam enters the room.
Takes quick stock.
Then...
SAM
Bob, did you get him stoned?
BOB
Come on, Sam. He likes it.
Just look at
him.
SAM
How do you feel, Charlie?
24.
CHARLIE
I just really want a milkshake.
The entire room explodes with laughter.
Charlie loves that
people find him so funny.
37
37
Sam takes the ice cream from the freezer to the blender.
Charlie watches her make the perfect vanilla milkshake.
CHARLIE
Sam, you have such pretty brown eyes, the
kind of pretty that deserves to make a
big deal about itself. You know what I
mean?
SAM
Okay, Charlie.
Let me make the milkshake.
CHARLIE
What a great word. Milkshake. It's like
when you say your name over and over
again in the mirror, and after awhile, it
sounds crazy.
SAM
I'm guessing you've never been high
before?
CHARLIE
Me? No. My best friend Michael. His
dad was a big drinker. So, he hated all
that stuff. Parties, too.
SAM
Well, where is Michael tonight?
CHARLIE
Oh, he shot himself last May.
Sam looks up.
Shocked silent.
Charlie is just stoned.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
I kind of wish he'd left a note.
You
know what I mean?
(off her sad nod)
Where's the bathroom?
SAM
It's up the stairs.
CHARLIE
25.
Charlie wanders off.
Sam watches him go.
38
38
Charlie leaves the bathroom and stops when he sees himself in
a large ornate mirror in the hallway.
CHARLIE
Charlie.
Charlie.
Weird.
Charlie wanders down the hallway, a little lost. He finds
the door to the master bedroom and opens it. He sees Patrick
and Brad Hays... kissing.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
Woah.
PATRICK
Charlie?
BRAD HAYS
(nervous)
Who is that kid?
PATRICK
Relax. Relax. He's a friend of mine.
Stay here.
Patrick closes the bedroom door and follows Charlie.
CHARLIE
I didn't see anything.
PATRICK
I know you saw something, but it's okay.
Patrick takes a quick peek to make sure no one is watching.
PATRICK (CONT'D)
Listen, Brad doesn't want anyone to
know... wait, are you baked?
CHARLIE
"Like a cake." That's what Bob said.
And how you can't have 3 on a match
because they would find us. And everyone
laughed, but I don't know what's funny.
PATRICK
Okay, Charlie, listen. I need you to
promise that you're not going to say
anything to anyone about me and Brad.
This has to be our little secret.
26.
CHARLIE
Our little secret.
Agreed.
PATRICK
Thank you.
We'll talk later.
CHARLIE
I look forward to that big talk.
Patrick laughs, goes back to the room, and closes the door.
39
39
The party has thinned. Sam watches Charlie drink his
milkshake obsessively with Alice and Mary Elizabeth.
CHARLIE
Isn't this the best milkshake, Alice?
It's even better than the first one.
Patrick walks downstairs.
Sam motions him over.
SAM
(barely audible whisper)
I need to talk to you. Charlie just told
me that his best friend shot himself. I
don't think he has any friends.
Patrick turns to look at Charlie. He feels so bad for the
kid. Patrick raises his plastic cup to the remaining crowd.
PATRICK
Everyone.
Raise your glasses to Charlie.
Charlie looks up.
A little paranoid.
Everyone is staring.
CHARLIE
What did I do?
PATRICK
You didn't do anything. We just want to
toast our new friend.
(off his look)
You see things. And you understand.
You're a wallflower.
Charlie dries his sweaty hands on his pants.
He looks around
the room at the nods and friendly faces.
PATRICK (CONT'D)
What is it? What's wrong?
CHARLIE
27.
PATRICK
Well, we didn't think there were any cool
people left to meet. So, everyone...
SAM & EVERYONE
To Charlie.
They all drink.
Sam approaches him.
A knowing smile.
SAM
Welcome to the island of misfit toys.
Charlie smiles, and the soundtrack comes rushing up loud.
SMASH CUT TO:
40
40
The truck speeds on Highway 376 toward the Fort Pitt Tunnel.
Patrick drives. Sam cranks the radio, blaring "The Tunnel
Song." The Star's anthem, "Your Ex-Lover is Dead" is our
prototype for tone.
SAM
My God.
What is this song!?
PATRICK
Right?
I have no idea.
SAM
(to Charlie)
Have you heard it before?
CHARLIE
Never.
SAM
(light bulb)
Wait! Let's go through the tunnel!
PATRICK
Sam, it's freezing.
SAM
Patrick, it's the perfect song!
PATRICK
No.
Mama Patrick says no.
SAM
Patrick, it's Sam. It's Sam talking to
you, I'm begging you to drive me--
28.
PATRICK
(laughing)
Alright! I concede!
Sam climbs through the window to the flat bed.
She grips the
flood lights to steady herself as she stands.
CHARLIE
What is she doing?
PATRICK
Don't worry. She does it all the time.
SAM
Turn it up!
PATRICK
You got it, your highness.
Patrick turns up the volume and drums on the steering wheel,
just as the truck flies into...
THE TUNNEL
We go behind the truck. Rising as Sam puts her arms in the
air. The image moves to Charlie's point of view, rising from
Sam's feet up her shivering legs. Past the band-aid on her
right knee. To Sam's face as she looks down. Into the
camera. Right at us. For we are now...
Charlie, looking up at Sam, so in love with this free-spirit.
So happy to have friends. Happy to be alive. Charlie gets
this look on his face. Patrick notices and smiles.
PATRICK (CONT'D)
What?
CHARLIE
I feel infinite.
The truck flies out of the Fort Pitt Tunnel onto the bridge.
Patrick and Charlie laugh as Sam raises her arms. Free and
young and alive on the greatest night of Charlie's life.
CUT TO:
41
41
We see Charlie proudly put a Smiths poster on his wall next
to photos of his new friends. He dances to his desk,
listening to Air Supply's "All Out of Love" on his Walkman.
29.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
Dear Friend, I'm sorry I haven't written
for awhile, but I've been trying hard not
to be a loser.
As the lyrics begin, Charlie unabashedly lip-synchs...
AIR SUPPLY
I'm lying alone with my head on the
phone, thinking of you 'til it hurts.
Charlie sits at his desk, writing and lip-synching.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
For example, I am trying to participate
by listening to Sam's collection of big
rock ballads and thinking about love.
Sam says they are kitschy and brilliant.
I completely agree.
42
42
As the students file out, Charlie hands his paper to Bill in
exchange for a beat up copy of The Great Gatsby.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
I am also studying extra books outside of
class. As it turns out, Mr. Anderson is
a writer. He even had a play put up in
New York once, which I think is very
impressive. He and his wife might go
back there after this year. I know this
is selfish, but I really hope he doesn't.
Charlie pauses in the doorway and turns back to look at Bill.
43
43
Charlie turns from the lunch line with The Great Gatsby on
his tray. He looks at the gang at their table. He sits with
them as they debate the design of this month's fanzine.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
My favorite time, though, is lunch because
I get to see Sam and Patrick. We spend
the time working on Mary Elizabeth's
fanzine about music and The Rocky Horror
Picture Show. It's called Punk Rocky.
Mary Elizabeth is really interesting
because she is a Buddhist and a punk, but
somehow she always acts like my father at
the end of a "long day."
30.
44
44
The xerox spits out copies of PUNK ROCKY! Halloween Issue!
Alice staples while Mary Elizabeth works her like a sled dog.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
Her best friend Alice loves vampires and
wants to go to film school. She also
steals jeans from the mall. I don't know
why because her family is rich, but I'm
trying not to be judgemental. Especially
since I know how they were all there for
Patrick last year. Patrick never likes
to be serious, so it took me awhile to
get what happened.
Sam and Alice laugh when Patrick begins stapling Mary
Elizabeth's fanzines to within an inch of their life.
[Note: The following sequence will come from Charlie's POV of
Patrick and Brad's activities over a weekend.]
45
46
Patrick whispers while the gang studies their SAT books.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
Then, Monday in school, Brad would say,
"Man, I was so wasted. I don't remember
a thing." This went on for 7 months.
47
47
Charlie sits with his family in itchy church clothes. He
turns to see Brad with his father and mother. Proper family.
Brad's dad gives him a pat on the back.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
When they finally did it, Brad said he
loved Patrick. Then, he started to cry.
31.
CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
saying his dad would kill him. And
saying he was going to hell.
48
48
We see Patrick and Brad walking in the library. They reach
the stacks, and just when it looks like they'll speak, they
simply... PASS EACH OTHER WITHOUT A WORD.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
Patrick was eventually able to help Brad
get sober. I asked Patrick if he felt
sad that he had to keep it a secret, and
he said no because at least now, Brad
doesn't have to get drunk to love him.
Brad sits down with his football pals. Patrick joins Charlie
and Sam at their table. Charlie looks over at Sam, studying
hard for her SAT's.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
I think that I understand because I
really like Sam. I asked my sister about
her, and she said that when Sam was a
freshman, the upper classmen used to get
her drunk at parties. I guess she had a
reputation. But I don't care. I'd hate
for her to judge me based on what I used
to be like.
49
49
We see Charlie making a mix tape on his boom box.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
So, I've been making her a mix tape so
she will know how I feel.
The two cassettes run. The song is just about to finish
when... the side runs out of tape and snaps off.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
Ah, shit!
50
51
... Rocky Horror Picture Show! The ROCKY EMCEE, dressed as
Riff Raff, whips the crowd into a frenzy.
32.
ROCKY EMCEE
CROWD
Gimme an R! Gimme an O!
R-O-C-K-Y!
Rocky!
Rocky!
Gimme a C! Gimme a K! Gimme
Rocky!
a Y! What's that spell!?
The crowd cheers!
Charlie claps from the front row.
52
52
The movie is in full swing. Charlie watches Sam as Janet in
the Floor Show. Sam mimics Susan Sarandon perfectly.
Especially the body. She winks at Charlie as "Fanfare/Don't
Dream It" begins and arriving regally as Frank 'n Furter in
full drag is... Patrick.
PATRICK
Whatever happened to Fae Wray? That
delicate, satin draped frame? As it clung
to her thigh, how I started to cry 'cause
I wanted to be dressed just the same.
Patrick is a rock star. He approaches Charlie. Putting his
ass in his face. Charlie is freaked out and laughing!
Especially when he sees Brad, alone in the back, smiling.
PATRICK (CONT'D)
Give yourself over to absolute pleasure.
Swim the warm waters of sins of the
flesh. Erotic nightmares beyond any
measure. And sensual daydreams to
treasure forever. Can't you just see it?
Woah oh oh!
Charlie stops laughing when the orgy begins between Patrick,
Mary Elizabeth (as Columbia), CRAIG (21), an art student with
a model's body (as Rocky)... and of course... Sam. Charlie
watches Sam until he can't take his lust (or guilt).
53
53
We hear the chorus of "Don't Dream It, Be It" as Charlie
watches all of the exciting cast members at the after-show
party. Charlie sees a photo of Sam's naked back on the wall
of Craig's loft. Very arty. Very black & white. Charlie's
lust (and guilt) are now at 11. Alice looks at the photo.
ALICE
It's gorgeous, Craig.
What did you use?
Craig is impressive to high school kids. He's a little
pretentious. But his art school life. His red wine. His
loft. Wow. Right now, he holds court in the wine line.
33.
CRAIG
Color film, but black and white paper for
the printing. My professor gave me an
"A," but for the wrong reasons. Most of
them are idiots. You'll see what I mean
when you get to college. How were your
SAT's by the way?
ALICE
(worried)
1150. I think I'll get into NYU.
CRAIG
Yeah, I hope so.
MARY ELIZABETH
(cruel to Alice)
1490. Harvard. Face!
54
54
Charlie sees Sam alone on the loft steps. She looks a little
down. He hands Sam a plastic cup and sits next to her.
CHARLIE
Hey.
Are you okay?
SAM
Yeah.
Yeah. But I got my SAT results
back.
Oops.
CHARLIE
You can take them again.
SAM
Yeah, it's just if I'm going to Penn
State main campus, I have to do much
better. I wish I would have studied
freshman year. I was a bit of a mess.
CHARLIE
I'll help you study for the next one.
SAM
Will you?
CHARLIE
Yeah, of course.
SAM
Thanks, Charlie.
Charlie summons his courage.
He hands her the mix tape.
34.
SAM (CONT'D)
What's this?
CHARLIE
Just a mix tape. No big deal. My
parents have a pretty good stereo. It's
all about that night in the tunnel. I
couldn't find that song we were listening
to, but I'm still searching for it, so--
SAM
It's okay. These are great.
You have
really good taste, Charlie.
CHARLIE
Really?
SAM
Yeah. Way better than me as a freshman.
I used to listen to the worst top 40.
CHARLIE
No.
SAM
Yeah, I did. But then I heard this old
song. Pearly Dew Drops Drop. And I
thought someday I would be at a party in
college or something. And I'd look up
and see this person across the room. And
from that moment, I'd know everything was
going to be okay. You know what I mean?
CHARLIE
(devastated in love)
Yeah.
55
55
The tape revolves in the stereo, playing a beautiful ballad.
Charlie watches Sam sway to his music like a serenade. Like
she is dancing with him. But she isn't. A wider angle
reveals that she is slow dancing with... Craig.
Charlie is 15 year old CRUSHED. No filter. Just feeling.
Patrick, Alice, and Mary Elizabeth watch Sam across the room.
ALICE
So, what do you think?
PATRICK
I don't know.
35.
ALICE
I hope it works out. Craig would be a
big step up from her last boyfriend.
MARY ELIZABETH
No, shit.
Who could forget Mr. Car Wash
Loser?
PATRICK
I just hope she stops playing dumb with
these guys. I keep telling her... don't
make yourself small. You can't save
anybody.
Craig dips a smiling Sam as the song ends. Sam goes into the
kitchen. Craig approaches Charlie. Turns off his mix tape.
CRAIG
Man, your mix is morbidly sad, kid. How
about something a little more upbeat?
Craig grabs a record from the pile and slaps it down.
CRAIG (CONT'D)
Sam tells me you want to be a writer.
CHARLIE
Yeah.
ALICE
Don't you write poetry, Craig?
CRAIG
No.
Poetry writes me.
You know?
Charlie sighs. Craig's upbeat song begins to play. He
dances over to Sam. Charlie's heart breaks as he watches Sam
hug on Craig.
56
56
In a mirror image, Candace hugs on Derek near the lockers.
Charlie closes his own locker and moves down the hall.
57
57
The bell rings.
Charlie sets down his On the Road paper.
BILL
Wow.
That was fast.
You want another
one?
36.
Charlie nods. Bill smiles and reaches into his desk. He
hands Charlie a copy of A Separate Piece. Charlie takes the
book and starts to walk out, but he turns back.
CHARLIE
Mr. Anderson... can I ask you something?
BILL
Yeah.
CHARLIE
Why do nice people choose the wrong
people to date?
BILL
Are we talking about anyone specific?
Charlie nods. Bill looks straight at him. Not preaching.
Coming from a history of personal experience and pain.
BILL (CONT'D)
We accept the love we think we deserve.
CHARLIE
Can we make them know they deserve more?
BILL
We can try.
Charlie smiles.
58
58
Charlie waits nervously at a booth. He sees Sam enter. He
fixes his hair, then pretends to read his SAT PREP BOOK.
SAM
Hey, Charlie.
CHARLIE
Hey, Sam. I didn't see you come in.
You
want to work on probabilities and
statistics?
Sam nods. They open their books, and a Christmas song
begins. In a quick passage of time, we see them study next
to Halloween decorations. Then, Thanksgiving. And finally,
Christmas decorations.
59
59
The song continues. Charlie's mom and sister hang the
Christmas ornaments as Charlie helps his dad find that "one
37.
CHARLIE
Hey, dad.
Can I have 30 dollars?
FATHER
(old joke)
20 dollars? What do you want 10 dollars
for?
CHARLIE
Sam is doing secret santa. It's her
favorite thing in the world. Please.
Charlie's father reaches into his pocket and hands Charlie a
bill. It's a fifty. Dad winks, in a great mood.
FATHER
Have fun.
CHARLIE
Thanks.
60
60
Lockers are opened by Charlie. Sam. Patrick. Wrapped gifts
are deposited. Mischief smiles. Lockers closed. Everyone
loves getting their presents except Charlie - who got socks.
61
61
Bill hands Charlie a well worn copy of The Catcher in the
Rye. He smiles.
BILL
Charlie... this was my favorite book
growing up. This is my copy, but I want
you to have it.
CHARLIE
Thanks.
BILL
Have a great Christmas break.
CHARLIE
You too, Mr. Anderson.
62
62
Mr. Callahan, the shop teacher, looks at a Sad Sack Girl's
clock. He takes a moment, and then...
MR. CALLAHAN
Terrible stain.
38.
He moves to Charlie's dad's amazing clock.
He hands Charlie
an A on a piece of paper.
MR. CALLAHAN (CONT'D)
That's pretty good, Charlie.
Mr. Callahan moves to Patrick's SHITTY WOODEN CLOCK. No
stain. No finish. Lop-sided. The ugliest clock you've ever
seen in your life.
MR. CALLAHAN (CONT'D)
You've got to be kidding me.
PATRICK
If you fail me, you get me next semester.
Mr. Callahan writes a grade and slaps it down.
63
64
We move to find Sam, holding her SAT score up to the group.
SAM
Hey, guys.
1210.
Everyone cheers.
Sam hugs Charlie.
65
65
Charlie carries Sam on his shoulders past the Christmas Tree.
Sam wears a Santa Hat like a hot elf.
SAM
No more applications!
No more SAT's!
Thank you, Charlie!
They pass Mary Elizabeth as she opens her final present.
39.
MARY ELIZABETH
Multiple pairs of blue jeans. Wow. This
is a really tough one, but I'm going to
have to guess... Alice.
Alice smiles. Bob nudges her. Guilty as charged.
Mary
Elizabeth pulls one last item out of the gift bag.
MARY ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
Wait, guys... a receipt! She actually
paid!
PATRICK
Impossible!
MARY ELIZABETH
I'm so touched.
Alice laughs. Patrick pours everyone brandy.
The kids look
ridiculous, but they don't feel ridiculous.
CHARLIE
Where's Craig?
SAM
He went home to Connecticut.
He'll be
back for New Year's Eve.
CHARLIE
I'm sorry we won't be seeing him tonight.
Sam nods, then turns. Charlie is delighted. No Craig.
The
kids settle in the living room in front of the fire.
SAM
Alright, big brother by 3 weeks.
Who's
your secret santa?
PATRICK
I'll tell you, Sam. This one's tough. I
have received a harmonica, a magnetic
poetry set, a book about Harvey Milk, and
a mix with the song "Asleep" on it...
twice.
Charlie starts snickering.
He can't help himself.
PATRICK (CONT'D)
I mean, I have no idea. This collection
of presents is so gay that I think I must
have given them to myself. But despite
that distinct possibility, I'm going to
have to go with... drum roll... Charlie.
40.
Charlie holds up his hands.
Yay!
They all cheer.
SAM
Alright, Charlie... it's your turn.
Charlie and Patrick switch places.
Charlie stands.
CHARLIE
Okay. Uh, I have received socks, pants,
a shirt, and a belt. I was ordered to
wear them all tonight. So, I'm guessing
my secret santa is Mary Elizabeth.
PATRICK
Huh.
Now, why do you say that?
CHARLIE
I don't know. She bosses people around
sometimes.
The gang cracks up.
Mary Elizabeth is pissed.
MARY ELIZABETH
What the hell is wrong with you?
CHARLIE
Sorry.
PATRICK
Well, you'll be surprised to know that
your secret santa is actually... me.
CHARLIE
You got me clothes?
Why?
PATRICK
Because all the great writers used to
wear great suits. Your last present is
on a towel rack in the bathroom. Delve
into our facilities. Emerge a star.
Charlie gives Sam a sack of presents.
CHARLIE
Can you hand these out while I'm gone?
MARY ELIZABETH
Wait a second. There's only secret santa
presents. There are rules, Charlie.
PATRICK
Mary Elizabeth, why are you trying to eat
Christmas? Hand them out, Sam.
41.
Sam gives out the presents. The group rips them open. Alice
looks at a book about Martin Scorsese with the inscription...
ALICE
"Alice, I know you'll get into NYU."
Alice turns to Mary Elizabeth who holds up a card with...
MARY ELIZABETH
40 dollars.
(reads card)
"To print Punk Rocky in color next time."
Bob blows soap bubbles into the air.
Stoned.
Mesmerized.
BOB
He knows me. He really knows me.
Sam looks at her present. An old 45 record of The Beatles
classic "Something" with a card. She reads the card. Holds
it to her chest. Very moved.
SAM
Come on out, Charlie.
They all chime in. "Let's go, young man!" "Charlie!
Charlie!" Charlie opens the door off camera, and we see his
entrance play off their faces. The reverse angle reveals...
Charlie dressed in his suit. Like the best of English mods
in the 60's. For those of you who know the book, this is the
cover. They all clap. It's magic.
PATRICK
Yeah!
What a display of man I have ever
seen!
Sam and Charlie look at each and smile.
66
66
The door opens.
Sam and Charlie walk into the dark room.
CHARLIE
Where are we going?
SAM
It's a surprise.
Sam flips the switch, bathing the room in light. Sam's room
is so cool. A shrine to music. A xerox that says "The
Beatings Will Continue Until Morale Improves." Virgin Mary
icons. Snow globes. Kitsch.
42.
CHARLIE
Is this your room?
It's so cool.
SAM
Thanks.
Sam points to a green box with a red ribbon on her desk.
CHARLIE
You got me a present?
SAM
With all that help on my Penn State
application? Of course I did. Open it.
Charlie lifts up the box to reveal an OLD MANUAL TYPEWRITER.
CHARLIE
I don't know what to say.
SAM
You don't have to say anything.
Sam goes over and types. "Write about us sometime." He
smiles and types back. "I will." They look at each other.
We can hear a lovely ballad playing downstairs.
SAM (CONT'D)
I'm sorry we can't be here for your
birthday.
CHARLIE
That's okay. I'm just sorry you have to
go back and visit your dad.
SAM
I'm in such a great mood, I don't think
even he could ruin it. I feel like I'm
finally doing good.
CHARLIE
You are.
SAM
Me? What about you? When I met you, you
were this scared freshman. And look at
you in that suit. You're like a sexy
English school boy. I saw Mary Elizabeth
checking you out.
CHARLIE
(innocent laugh)
No.
43.
SAM
Innocent. Worst kind of guys. Never see
you coming. And parents love you. That's
like... extra danger.
CHARLIE
Well, it hasn't worked so far.
SAM
Come on. You've never had a girlfriend?
Not even a 2nd grade valentine?
He shakes his head.
SAM (CONT'D)
Have you ever kissed a girl?
CHARLIE
No.
What about you?
SAM
Have I ever kissed a girl?
CHARLIE
(laughs)
No! Your first kiss...
Sam gets this strange look in her eyes.
A little haunted.
SAM
My first kiss? I was 11. His name was
Robert. He would come over to the house
all the time.
CHARLIE
Was he your first boyfriend?
SAM
He was my dad's boss.
Charlie goes silent.
SAM (CONT'D)
You know Charlie, I used to sleep with
guys who treated me like shit. And get
wasted all the time. But now... I feel
like I have a chance. I could even get
into a real college.
CHARLIE
It's true.
You can do it.
SAM
44.
CHARLIE
My Aunt... she had that same thing done
to her, too. And she turned her life
around.
SAM
She must have been great.
CHARLIE
She was my favorite person in the
world... until now.
Sam smiles.
She's very moved.
SAM
Charlie, I know that you know I like
Craig. But I want to forget that for a
minute. Okay? I just want to make sure
that the first person who kisses you
loves you. Okay?
Charlie nods. And with that, Sam leans over and kisses him.
It starts softly, then Sam wraps her thin arms around him.
Holding on for lonely life. When the song crescendos, and
they part, Charlie and Sam look at each other. Finally...
SAM (CONT'D)
I love you, Charlie.
CHARLIE
I love you, too.
67
69
The front door opens, revealing Charlie's dad.
FATHER
Hey!
Look who's here!
He moves out of the way, and standing there is Charlie's
older brother, CHRIS KELMECKIS (19). Chris is handsome,
charismatic, and an all around winner.
CHRIS
Come here, little sister.
CANDACE
Hey, Chris.
Big hug.
Chris smiles big and "son flirts" with his mom.
CHRIS
Ma, you look so thin!
MOTHER
10 pounds... Weight Watchers.
Big kiss.
When he lets go, he sees Charlie and smiles.
CHRIS
Charlie...
Chris and Charlie look at each other in silence. Then, hug.
As the family moves into the dining room to celebrate, Chris
gives him a quiet...
CHRIS (CONT'D)
Happy birthday.
70
70
46.
MOTHER
Make a wish, honey.
We move closer to Charlie as he makes his wish and blows out
his 16 candles.
MATCH CUT TO:
71
74
Charlie wanders through the quiet house. He turns the corner
where he finds Chris sitting at the table. He's lit by a
couple of candles and the blinking lights of the Christmas
Tree. He's surrounded by leftovers. Charlie sits.
CHARLIE
Hey.
Chris chews and swallows.
Famished.
They both whisper.
CHRIS
Hey. God, I missed mom's cooking.
You
have no idea how good you have it.
I'm
actually beginning to hate pizza.
Charlie smiles.
Grabs a Hershey Kiss cookie.
CHARLIE
How are you liking school?
CHRIS
Not bad.
I'm no brainiac like you or
Candace.
But I'm doing okay.
CHARLIE
Okay?
You're playing in a Bowl Game.
Chris laughs. Charlie smiles.
A moment passes.
Chris
changes his tone. Cautious.
CHRIS
How are you feeling, Charlie?
CHARLIE
Good.
CHRIS
You know what I mean.
Is it bad tonight?
CHARLIE
No.
CHRIS
No?
CHARLIE
I'm not picturing things anymore. And
when I do, I can just shut it off.
CHRIS
(relieved)
48.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
now. And maybe if it does get bad again,
you can just talk to them, yeah?
CHARLIE
Yeah. Especially Sam. I'm going to ask
her out at New Years. I think the time
is right now.
Chris smiles at his kid brother.
We hear the church organ.
75
75
The family moves down the line to receive Holy Communion at
Christmas Mass. Charlie's father, then mother, then sister,
take the sacrament. Charlie is next. The PRIEST makes the
motion of the cross with the communion wafer. He places it
in Charlie's hand. Charlie brings the sacrament to his mouth
with his fingers...
MATCH CUT TO:
76
76
We move in closer to Charlie's fingers in his mouth. When he
takes his hand out, we see... a tab of LSD. The church organ
is now a rock organ. And it's now... New Year's Eve.
Charlie closes his mouth. He looks down the hall of the
smoky room where Craig has his arm around Sam. Charlie turns
to Mary Elizabeth, who's also dosed.
CHARLIE
How long does this take to work?
77
78
Charlie wanders through the party, tripping out of his mind.
He sits down on the sofa. The world unbends as Charlie takes
off the glasses. Kids walk around the party, leaving ghosts
of themselves behind.
Charlie looks upstairs to find... Sam and Craig kissing.
Craig leads her to the bedroom.
Charlie looks back at the party as kids gather for the New
Years countdown. Patrick leads the charge.
PATRICK
10-9-8...
79
80
We are BACK TO PRESENT as Charlie takes a deep breath and
tries to remember that he's at a New Year's party.
PATRICK
7-6-5-4-3-2-1. Happy New Year!
50.
The crowd cheers, leaving ghosts of themselves.
Charlie gets
up from the sofa and walks out of Bob's house.
81
84
Aunt Helen drives past a tall snow drift. She looks down at
the 45 of The Beatles in the seat next to her. She smiles at
Charlie's birthday present. Then, she looks up as the
headlights of the semi truck smash the windows with a CRASH!
85
85
Charlie's mother opens the door, revealing a POLICEMAN. He
turns to Charlie in his party hat. 7 years old and confused.
86
87
The Emergency room is bustling on New Year's Day. Charlie
looks up as the POLICE, DOCTORS, and his PARENTS tower over
him. He is terrified and does what any kid would do. He
lies his ass off.
POLICEMAN
Did your older friends pressure you?
CHARLIE
No one pressured me into anything. I
would never do drugs, officer. Never.
POLICEMAN
Then, how did you happen to be passed out
on the ground at 6 in the morning?
51.
CHARLIE
Well, um... I was really tired, and uh...
I was feeling feverish. So, I went
outside for a walk, just to get some cold
air. And I started seeing things. So, I
passed out.
He waits to see if this worked.
And then, unexpectedly...
MOTHER
(worried)
You're seeing things again, Charlie?
CHARLIE
(oops)
Not, uh... Not really.

Charlie shakes off the cold, then takes off his overcoat to
reveal... he's wearing his suit from Secret Santa. All the
kids stare. Charlie realizes he made a terrible mistake.
CHARLIE
It was a Christmas present.
90
90
Charlie sits as Bill hands out the book for the semester...
The Great Gatsby. As the kids chatter, Bill gives Charlie
his own book to start the year... The Stranger.
CHARLIE
Did you have fun on your break?
BILL
More fun than you're going to have today,
Sinatra.
Bill pats his shoulder and moves on.
The Smart Ass Freshman
looks at Charlie and whispers.
SMART ASS FRESHMAN
Nice look, jag off.
91
92
Mary Elizabeth and the kids get ready for the floor show.
MARY ELIZABETH
Well what are we supposed to do?
We're
going on in 10 minutes!
The phone rings. Mary Elizabeth picks up. Charlie turns to
Brad, sitting next to him. Charlie is freaking out.
CHARLIE
But they said in health class--
BRAD HAYS
They say that about LSD to scare you.
CHARLIE
Are you sure?
BRAD HAYS
Charlie, you're fine, man.
Mary Elizabeth hangs up the phone, frustrated.
MARY ELIZABETH
Guys, we have an emergency. Craig flaked
out on us again. I need a Rocky. Brad?
BRAD HAYS
(scared)
No way. There are people out here.
The group is deflated. They all start thinking.
After a
beat, Mary Elizabeth looks at Charlie.
MARY ELIZABETH
Charlie... take off your clothes.
93
93
You know those dreams you have when you are standing in front
of 200 people in your underwear? Well, this is no dream.
We hear a heart beat as Charlie dances out of the Rocky gauze
and finds himself standing in tight gold underwear, looking
out at 200 people, cheering him on.
His friends can't stop smiling. Especially Mary Elizabeth,
who watches Charlie's little butt in the gold undies. She
53.
94
94
"Touch-A, Touch-A, Touch Me" is in full swing. Sam slinks
over to Charlie dressed in her white bra and slip.
SAM
(as Janet)
So if anything grows while you pose.
I'll oil you up and drop you down. And
that's just one small fraction of the
main attraction. You need a friendly
hand. And I need action!
Sam grabs Charlie's hands and rubs them all over her chest.
SAM (CONT'D)
Ah! Touch a touch a touch me! I wanna
be dirty! Thrill me. Chill me. Fulfill
me! Creature of the night!
The song continues. We see flashes of the night's
performance as Charlie goes from train wreck to triumph.
Charlie joins Sam in the kick line, and it feels like it's
just the two of them. On the final beat, Sam gasps...
SAM (CONT'D)
Creature of the night!
The song ends. The cast bows. Sam and Patrick push Charlie
in front for his own curtain call. Everyone cheers. It's
the night he'll never forget.
95
96
Ding dong. Charlie's mom opens the door for MARY ELIZABETH.
Charlie straightens out his church suit. So nervous.
MOTHER
You must be Mary Elizabeth.
It's so good
to meet you.
MARY ELIZABETH
You, too, Mrs. Kelmeckis.
FATHER
(shit eating grin)
Charlie tells me you're a Buddhist.
97
97
Charlie and Mary Elizabeth stand next to Candace and Derek.
FATHER
OK, a little closer together. That looks
nice. Buddhist, I need you to smile a
little bit more. There you go. Nice.
Cheese!
White flash.
The picture of 4 kids.
Smiling big.
55.
98
98
Charlie and Mary Elizabeth slow dance to an 80's love song.
Sweaty palms. Awkward. Hands on hips. Horror.
Charlie looks around the gym. He sees Alice dancing with her
date, an EFFEMINATE GOTH KID (17). We'll never meet him, but
he'll make us laugh once.
Charlie then watches Patrick dance with Sam. He follows
Patrick's gaze across the floor to Brad, who dances with a
SENIOR GIRL (18). Charlie sees the boys look at each other.
For one moment, it's like they're dancing together.
99
99
Mary Elizabeth is at the punch bowl with the gang. Charlie
sees Sam, standing by the wall, looking sad. He approaches.
CHARLIE
Are you having a good time?
SAM
Not really. How about you?
CHARLIE
I don't know. This is my first date, so
I don't know what to compare it to.
SAM
Don't worry. You're doing fine.
Charlie joins her at the wall.
Mary Elizabeth gives them a
quick, jealous look.
CHARLIE
I'm sorry Craig didn't come.
SAM
Yeah. He said he didn't want to go to
some stupid high school dance. Can't say
I blame him.
CHARLIE
I don't know. If you like it, he should
come.
SAM
Thanks, Charlie. Have a beautiful first
date. You deserve it.
CHARLIE
I'll try not to make you too jealous.
56.
He said it to cheer her up.
Sam forces a smile and leaves.
100

Mary Elizabeth approaches Charlie on the antique sofa. She
uncorks a bottle of wine. POP! She hands him the bottle.
MARY ELIZABETH
Mmmm.
Now, let it breathe.
Mary Elizabeth walks over to the vintage turntable. She
turns on the gas fireplace with a remote control. Roar!
CHARLIE
This is sure a nice house.
MARY ELIZABETH
Thanks.
Mary Elizabeth drops the needle on a vinyl LP. A Doo Wop
make-out classic begins to play. She dances over to Charlie.
MARY ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
Mmmm. Don't you just love old music?
(off his nod)
Good. Because I made you a mix of it.
I'd love to expose you to great things.
Like Billie Holiday and foreign films.
She pours the wine.
Charlie looks at the bottle.
CHARLIE
This merlot is really fancy.
MARY ELIZABETH
Yeah. My dad collects wine, but he
doesn't drink. That's weird, isn't it?
CHARLIE
I guess.
Where are your parents?
MARY ELIZABETH
Their club is hosting a cotillion or
something racist. They'll be gone all
night.
Mary Elizabeth drops her necklace with a thud.
Charlie looks
around. Heart beating.
CHARLIE
That's sure a nice fire.
57.
MARY ELIZABETH
Yeah. After I'm done being a lobbyist, I
want to move to a house like this in Cape
Cod. That sounds nice, doesn't it?
CHARLIE
Yeah.
She reaches out and touches his chest.
MARY ELIZABETH
Your heart is beating really fast.
CHARLIE
Is it?
MARY ELIZABETH
Here, feel.
She puts her hand on his.
Moves it to his chest.
MARY ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
Charlie?
CHARLIE
Uh-huh?
MARY ELIZABETH
Do you like me?
CHARLIE
Uh-huh.
MARY ELIZABETH
You know what I mean.
CHARLIE
I think so.
MARY ELIZABETH
Don't be nervous.
She slowly moves his hand to her dress strap. It falls off
her shoulder. She leans in for a red wine kiss. She guides
his hand over her bra. He feels her breast. Wow.
MATCH CUT TO:
101
101
For a quick moment, Charlie imagines he is kissing Sam.
Broken by...
58.
102
102
Mary Elizabeth moves his hand away. Charlie blinks, taking a
moment to realize Sam's not the one in the room. The song is
over. The needle turns at the end of the record.
MARY ELIZABETH
Charlie...
She gives him one last kiss.
Content, she lays down on his
lap. Peaceful.
MARY ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
I didn't know how it was going to go
tonight, but it was really nice, huh?
CHARLIE
Yeah.
MARY ELIZABETH
I can't believe it. You of all people.
I just can't believe you're my boyfriend.
We land on Charlie's face.
"What?"
And then, we hear the
GARAGE DOOR OPEN.
MARY ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
Oh, shit!
My parents!
The mad scramble for clothes begins.
CUT TO:
103
104
Sam, Patrick, and Alice are seated around the table. Mary
Elizabeth has her arms around Charlie. Smothering him.
MARY ELIZABETH
We're literally making out, and I'm in my
bra. Hello! And the front door opens.
It's my parents! I'm scrambling to get
my dress on. It was crazy. Right, babe?
Charlie nods, tortured.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
I probably should have been honest about
how I didn't want to go out with Mary
Elizabeth after Sadie's, but I really
didn't want to hurt her feelings.
105
107
Just like Sadie's except... the fire in the fireplace is out.
We move from the fireplace to Charlie, touching Mary
Elizabeth's breasts over her sweater.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
And I had to admit something really
upsetting. But I am tired of touching
her boobs. I thought maybe if she would
just let me pick the make-out music once
in awhile, we might have a chance.
Charlie looks at the Ani DiFranco Mix on the stereo.
Sighs.
108
108
The gang is there.
Walden rests on Charlie's lunch tray.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
And maybe if she didn't put down the
books that Mr. Anderson gives me.
MARY ELIZABETH
Walden? I read it in 7th grade.
I would
have called it "On Boring Pond."
109
109
Ring! Charlie grabs the cordless. He looks at Patrick's
clock. 3:13pm. His voice can no longer hide his quiet rage.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
Or if she would stop calling me the
minute I get home from school when I have
absolutely nothing to talk about other
than the bus ride home...
MARY ELIZABETH (V.O.)
That dairy just sits with you. It walks
with you.
Charlie calmly puts down the phone and leaves the room.
We
61.
110
110
Charlie is so miserable.
His mom is sympathetic.
MOTHER
She's on the phone right now? Charlie,
you have to break up with her.
CHARLIE
I can do that?
Charlie's father leans back from the sofa and his newspaper.
FATHER
For Christ's sake... I need to use the
phone!
111
111
He returns.
Mary Elizabeth is still talking on the cordless.
MARY ELIZABETH (V.O.)
I'll give you this book. It's really how
I became a vegan--
CHARLIE (V.O.)
I know I should have been honest, but I
was getting so mad, it was starting to
scare me.
He looks back at the clock.
3:23pm.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
Um... Mary Elizabeth. Can I talk to you--
MARY ELIZABETH (V.O.)
Charlie. Please, don't interrupt.
You
know I hate that.
Charlie goes to his quiet place.
Tick.
Tick.
Tick.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
I just wish I could have found another
way to break up. In hindsight, I
probably could not have picked a worse
way to be honest with Mary Elizabeth.
112
112
Truth or dare. The gang is seated in a circle, drinking from
plastic cups. Charlie sits between Mary Elizabeth and Sam.
BOB
62.
PATRICK
Who are you talking to?
BOB
I dare you to kiss Alice.
PATRICK
(licks his lips)
Get ready, breeder.
As Patrick approaches an apprehensive Alice...
CRAIG
Mary Elizabeth? Samantha told me that
you got into Harvard. Congratulations.
MARY ELIZABETH
Thank you.
(re: Charlie)
This one still hasn't gotten me flowers.
(to Charlie)
But I forgive you.
She kisses him. Charlie bites his cheeks.
Sam looks a
little depressed.
CRAIG
(to Sam)
Don't worry about Penn State.
You're
just wait-listed.
PATRICK
Excuse me, everyone, but you're missing
some hot "fag on goth" action.
Anticipation. Patrick is getting ready to plant the biggest
kiss on Alice when she jumps him. Everyone groans. Ew!
Laughter. Patrick looks for the next person. Charlie's
heart pounds. Don't pick me! Please!
PATRICK (CONT'D)
Okay. My turn. Um... let's think...
Charlie... truth or dare?
Silence.
Thinking.
Finally...
CHARLIE
Truth.
PATRICK
How is your first relationship going?
63.
CHARLIE
It's so bad that I keep fantasizing that
one of us is dying of cancer, so I don't
have to break up with her.
PATRICK
Charlie?
Truth or dare?
Charlie blinks.
It was all fantasy.
CHARLIE
Dare.
PATRICK
I dare you to kiss the prettiest girl in
the room on the lips. Notice I
charitably said girl and not person
because let's face it... I'd smoke all
you bitches.
Alice hits him. Laughter. Charlie thinks. He looks at Mary
Elizabeth, then turns to Sam. Before Sam can even react...
Charlie plants a kiss right on her lips. When he opens his
eyes, he looks around, and realizes the magnitude of his
mistake. Everyone stares. After a horrible silence...
PATRICK (CONT'D)
Now that's fucked up.
Without a word, Mary Elizabeth just stands, dignified, and
goes into the kitchen.
CHARLIE
Mary Elizabeth, I'm sorry.
I'm--
Alice follows Mary Elizabeth.
Sam is close behind.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
Sam?! Sam! I'm sorry. I didn't mean
anything by it. I'm sorry.
Sam turns and looks at him.
She doesn't even recognize him.
SAM
What the hell is wrong with you?
Charlie is devastated.
113
114
Charlie sits at his desk. It looks like he's barely slept.
He begins typing. The keys up close and loud. Clak.
CLOSE UP TYPING: "Dear friend, I have not seen my friends for
2 weeks now. I am starting to get bad again."
Charlie stares at the typewriter.
And remembers.
SMASH CUT TO:
115
115
Little Charlie pops his head around the corner from the
hallway. He looks at something we can't see yet.
BACK TO:
116
116
Present.
Knock.
Knock.
Charlie's mom opens the door.
MOTHER
We're going to be late for Easter Mass.
CHARLIE
I'll... I'll be there in a minute.
65.
Charlie forces a smile, then looks back at the typewriter.
And tries to shake off the memory.
SMASH CUT TO:
117
117
Little Charlie looks at Aunt Helen as she smokes her
cigarette and sobs.
BACK TO:
118
118
Charlie is lost. His family sits in the pews for Easter
Mass. Charlie watches the PRIEST recite the Lord's prayer.
PRIEST
Our Father who art in Heaven. Hallowed
be Thy name. Thy kingdom come--
MATCH CUT TO:
119
119
7 year old Charlie watches the PRIEST recite the Lord's
prayer. He looks at Aunt Helen's picture on the coffin.
PRIEST
Thy will be done on earth as it is in
Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread.
MATCH CUT TO:
120
120
16 year old Charlie looks haunted by the memory.
PRIEST
And forgive us our trespasses as we
forgive those who trespass against us--
The voices drift away and all Charlie can see is...
CUT TO:
121
121
7 year old Charlie takes Aunt Helen's hand to make her stop
crying.
CUT TO:
66.
122
122
16 year old Charlie blinks as the voices come back.
PRIEST
And lead us not into temptation.
But
deliver us from--
SMASH CUT TO:
123
123
Charlie on the phone.
His voice wavers a bit.
Desperate.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
Mary Elizabeth... I... uh... I've been
listening to the Billie Holiday CD every
night and--
MARY ELIZABETH (V.O.)
It's too late, Charlie.
CHARLIE
I know. I just feel really bad about
what I did. I just get so messed up
inside like I'm - not there or something.
MARY ELIZABETH (V.O.)
Tell it to someone who cares.
CHARLIE
I know. I'm sorry. I just.
We've all
become such good friends--
MARY ELIZABETH (V.O.)
Good friends? You mean the people I've
known since kindergarten that you've
known for 6 months? Those good friends?
CHARLIE
Oh. Yeah. I mean I don't want to do
anything to ruin our--
MARY ELIZABETH (V.O.)
It's ruined. Okay? So, stop calling
everyone. Stop embarrassing yourself.
CHARLIE
Okay.
I will. Goodbye, Mar--
Dial tone.
Charlie hangs up the phone.
67.
124
124
Charlie is terribly anxious.
He watches Bob groom some pot.
CHARLIE
Something's wrong with me--
BOB
Don't worry about it.
Hey... you hear
from Patrick?
CHARLIE
No.
He told me to stay away.
BOB
Oh... you don't know?
CHARLIE
(concerned)
Why? Why? What happened?
BOB
Brad's father caught them together.
125
125
As kids open lockers and move to morning period, Charlie
stares at Brad. He has a black eye and cuts on his face. He
look like he was beaten up badly. Students whisper gossip.
GOSSIP WHISPERS (O.S.)
"Some Lebo kids jumped him outside the
O." "It was some kids from North Hills."
"That's not what I heard."
Brad moves into the arms of CHARLOTTE (18), cheerleader cute.
As Brad kisses her, Charlie sees Patrick down the hall,
watching them. Patrick closes his locker. Hurting.
CHARLIE
Are you okay?
PATRICK
Not now, Charlie. I'm sorry.
Patrick storms off.
126
126
Charlie sits at his table, alone. He watches Patrick leave
the lunch line, passing a chorus of...
TWIN SENIOR GIRLS
68.
Patrick says nothing. He's too sad to fight the mob today.
He just moves to his table when the Nose Tackle sticks out
his leg. Patrick falls on his tray. The kids laugh.
NOSE TACKLE
Oops.
Sorry, Nothing.
Patrick smiles to himself, dusts off, and turns to Brad.
PATRICK
You going to do something?
BRAD HAYS
What are you talking about?
PATRICK
Your pet ape just tripped me.
Are you
going to say something?
BRAD HAYS
Why would I?
PATRICK
You know why.
It's too far.
Brad can feel people staring.
BRAD HAYS
This is pathetic, man.
Your fixation on
me.
Brad's friends laugh.
Patrick's eyes narrow.
PATRICK
Do you want your friends to know how you
got those bruises? Really?
BRAD HAYS
I got jumped in a parking lot.
PATRICK
Where? In Schenley Park? Do they know
about Schenley Park?
(to Brad's friends)
Do you guys know about Schenley Park?
Brad stands and gets right in Patrick's face.
BRAD HAYS
I don't know what kind of sick shit
you're trying to pull.
(real warning)
But you better walk away now... Nothing.
69.
PATRICK
Fine.
Say hi to your dad for me.
Patrick turns and leaves.
And then, as an afterthought...
BRAD HAYS
Whatever... faggot.
Brad's friends laugh.
Patrick stops and turns.
Last chance.
PATRICK
What did you call me?
BRAD HAYS
I called you a faggo--
Smack.
Before Brad can even finish, Patrick throws a vicious right
to the cheek. Brad tackles him. And the two start fighting.
The cafeteria erupts in NOISE.
PATRICK
Say that shit again!
Say that shit
again!
Brad's football buddies rise and peel Patrick off Brad.
Mary
Elizabeth and Sam jump up from their corner table.
MARY ELIZABETH
It's Patrick!
The cafeteria gets louder. The Nose Tackle holds Patrick up.
More Noise. The Linebacker hits Patrick in the face.
SAM
No!
No!
Sam rushes up and the Nose Tackle pushes her down. She lands
on her tail bone. Thud. Patrick gets hit a couple of times
in the face. The kids cheer the fight. It's getting louder
and louder with more and more noise. And then...
SMASH CUT TO:
Silence.
Charlie comes out from a blink. He calmly looks around. For
a moment, he doesn't understand where he is. He looks up.
All the kids are staring at him. Mary Elizabeth. Alice.
Brad. They are all quiet. Afraid of him. Charlie looks at
his hand, clenched in a fist. It is already covered with...
70.
Charlie's confused until he sees the Linebacker holding his
broken, bloody nose. He's looking at Charlie...
Terrified.
The image pans over. The Nose Tackle is on the ground.
Charlie stands over them. He is disconnected. It's an out
of body experience. He reaches out and helps Patrick to his
feet. Then, he calmly turns and stares right through Brad.
CHARLIE
(icy calm)
If you touch my friends again, I'll blind
you.
Brad is stunned.
So is everyone... except Sam.
127
127
Charlie sits in the waiting room of the principal's office.
He looks through the glass where Principal Small talks to
Brad. After a beat, she pats Brad's shoulder and opens the
door. Leaving Charlie and Brad alone in the waiting room.
Just as Brad is about to leave...
BRAD HAYS
Charlie?
CHARLIE
Yeah?
BRAD HAYS
Thanks for stopping them.
CHARLIE
Sure, Brad.
Brad doesn't look at him.
He just moves on.
128
129
Mary Elizabeth looks at us because she wants us to know...
MARY ELIZABETH
I'm dating Peter now.
She motions to PETER.
College.
Glasses.
Good looking-ish.
MARY ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
He's in college with Craig. He's
opinionated, and we have intellectual
debates. You were very sweet, but our
relationship was too one-sided. I know
this is hard for you.
CHARLIE
I'm just glad you're happy.
MARY ELIZABETH
Okay.
Mary Elizabeth joins Peter.
Charlie looks at his friends.
72.
that says, "They forget. I don't." After a beat, Patrick
comes downstairs. He looks sad with his bruises.
PATRICK
Hey Craig, Sam will be down soon.
MARY ELIZABETH
We're going to miss the movie.
CRAIG
Yeah, I'll go put some pep in her step.
As Craig moves upstairs, Patrick approaches Charlie.
PATRICK
Hey... you wanna get out of here?
CHARLIE
Sure, Patrick.
130
134
Patrick hands Sam an envelope.
Sam holds it.
Pins and
needles.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
Then, Sam got her letter from Penn State.
Sam opens the letter. She reads. Tears instantly well up in
her eyes. She leaves the room and walks down the hall.
Patrick picks up the letter.
PATRICK
(reading)
"We will require you to take our summer
session at the main campus immediately
following your high school graduation."
(off Charlie's look)
She got in, Charlie.
Charlie turns back to Sam.
She holds him with sweet relief
and redemption.
135
135
Charlie laughs with his friends in the cafeteria.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
After that all Patrick could talk about
76.
CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
did get into NYU Film School. Patrick is
going to the University of Washington
because he wants to be near the music in
Seattle.
136
136
Charlie and a group of students stand, looking up at the
wall, which is covered with...
CHARLIE (V.O.)
But he wasn't going to leave without
organizing the best senior prank ever.
... All The Shop Tools Painted Pink
The shop teacher, Mr. Callahan stares at the wall, furious.
As the students gawk, Charlie smiles to himself.
137
137
Sam and the girls chat excitedly.
Summer is almost here.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
Sam is going to leave right after
graduation. It all feels very exciting;
I just wish it were happening to me.
138
138
Charlie sits on his bed, finishing the letter.
CHARLIE
Especially because ever since I blacked
out in the cafeteria, it's been getting
worse. And I can't turn it off this
time.
Charlie puts down the letter.
139
139
The kids pass their copies of The Great Gatsby up to the
front, where Bill collects them for next year's freshmen.
The class is buzzing loud.
BILL
Guys, you want to pass your copies of
Gatsby up to the front please? And I
know it's the last day, but if we could
just keep it to a dull roar, I'd
appreciate it.
The class quiets down.
77.
BILL (CONT'D)
Thank you for such a great year. I had a
blast. I hope you did, too. And I hope
you have a great time this summer on your
vacations. Now, who here is going to be
reading for pleasure this summer?
Charlie looks to see if anyone is watching... then, decides
to raise his hand anyway. Bill is proud.
BILL (CONT'D)
Very good, Charlie. Who else?
Charlie looks at the Smart Ass Freshman who tormented him all
year. She sighs. Nothing left to say to him.
140
140
The last kids exit the classroom. Charlie walks down the
aisle and stands in front of Bill.
BILL
Last day.
CHARLIE
Yeah. So, uh, I know it's none of my
business, but have you decided... are you
going to New York?
BILL
Well, my wife and I like it here, and I
think I might be better at teaching than
writing.
Charlie is relieved.
Bill is staying.
BILL (CONT'D)
So, uh Charlie... I was thinking maybe I
could still give you books next year.
CHARLIE
Yeah.
Yeah.
BILL
I think you could write one of them one
day.
CHARLIE
(fragile belief)
Really?
BILL
I do.
78.
Charlie is quiet.
Then...
CHARLIE
You're the best teacher I ever had.
BILL
Thank you.
He gives Bill a shy sideways hug. The two men say nothing
else. Charlie waves and leaves. Bill smiles to himself.
141
141
Times Square has nothing on these seniors. Charlie watches
the gang on their last day of high school. When the clock
hits 10 seconds to 3pm, all the students chant...
SAM & COMPANY
10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2...
STUDENT (O.S.)
Oh, my God, get me the hell out of here!
ALL
1!
They all cheer and hug each other. Patrick loses his mind
with joy and charges down the hallway.
SMASH CUT TO:
142
143
Prom night. Charlie sees Candace posing for Dad's camera.
For a moment, we think Candace went to prom with Derek.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
I kept thinking about what school was
going to be like without them as they
79.
As mom and dad move out of the way, we realize Candace is
standing with her 3 best girlfriends. They look beautiful.
CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
My sister finally decided to break up
with Derek and go stag with her
girlfriends instead.
144
146
The grandfather clock reads 9:30pm. The room is festive
under streamers wishing Sam luck at Penn State. The kids
sign each other's yearbooks. Charlie sees Sam smile at old
photos. He misses her already.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
At her going away party, I wanted her to
know about that night we went through the
tunnel. And how for the first time, I
felt like I belonged somewhere.
CUT TO:
147
147
10:28pm. Charlie doesn't know where the time keeps going.
Sam opens goodbye presents from her friends.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
And tomorrow, she's leaving. So, I
wanted to give her a part of me.
Charlie watches Sam pick up his present. She carefully peels
the tape to reveal that Charlie gave her all of his books.
SAM
Are these all your books, Charlie?
He nods.
They lock eyes and do not speak.
81.
148
148
The pictures are down. The dressers empty. The suitcase is
open on the bed. Charlie watches Sam fold clothes and put
them in her suitcase. He has promised himself he will not
cry. Even when she packs away his Beatles 45 of "Something."
Instead, he looks at her and tries to remember every detail.
Her hair and brown eyes and sound of her voice.
SAM
Thanks for staying up with me.
CHARLIE
Sure. My brother said Penn State has a
restaurant called Ye Olde College Diner.
You have to get a grilled stickie on your
first night. It's a tradition.
SAM
That sounds like fun.
CHARLIE
Yeah. Pretty soon, you'll have a whole
new group of friends, and you won't even
think about this place anymore.
SAM
Yes, I will.
Sam moves some suitcases over to the pile in the room.
They
stand next to each other. Close.
SAM (CONT'D)
I had lunch with Craig today.
CHARLIE
Yeah?
SAM
He said he was sorry, and that I was
right to break up with him. But I'm
driving away, and I just felt so small.
Just asking myself why do I and everyone
I love pick people who treat us like
we're nothing?
CHARLIE
We accept the love we think we deserve.
He says it sober. Without judgement. Sam lets it sink in.
Charlie walks over to the bed to do more packing. Then, she
turns to him.
82.
SAM
Then, why didn't you ever ask me out?
Charlie didn't expect that.
He is silent.
Heart pounding.
CHARLIE
I, uh, I just didn't think you wanted
that.
SAM
Well, what did you want?
CHARLIE
I just want you to be happy.
SAM
Don't you get it, Charlie? I can't feel
that. It's really sweet and everything,
but you can't just sit there and put
everybody's lives ahead of yours and
think that counts as love. I don't want
to be somebody's crush. I want people to
like the real me.
CHARLIE
I know who you are, Sam.
Sam waits.
And Charlie finally speaks from the heart.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
I know I'm quiet, and I know I should
speak more, but if you knew the things
that were in my head most of the time,
you'd know what it really meant. How
much we are alike. And how we've been
through the same things. And you're not
small. You're beautiful.
He can't contain himself anymore. He moves to her and kisses
her. They stand. Move to the bed. Kissing. Charlie's
heart pounds. They sit on the bed. Still kissing.
We see her fingertips. Her hand on Charlie's knee. When she
touches him, Charlie pulls away from her. Shocked. Like
he's seen a ghost. It hits Charlie like freezing water.
SAM
What's wrong, Charlie?
CHARLIE
Oh, ah... nothing.
Charlie shakes off whatever was bothering him and continues
83.
149
150
QUICK FLASH... Charlie remembers kissing Sam the night
before. Her hand touches Charlie's knee.
BACK TO PRESENT:
151
152
QUICK FLASH... Charlie remembers pulling away from Sam.
Shocked. Like he's seen a ghost.
SAM
What's wrong, Charlie?
BACK TO PRESENT:
84.
153
154
QUICK FLASH... Charlie remembers the night with Sam. We see
her put her hand on his knee. The image moves up the arm.
To the shoulder. To the face. And we reveal, we are not in
Sam's bedroom. And it is not Sam touching Charlie. But...
Aunt Helen
AUNT HELEN
Don't wake your sister.
BACK TO REALITY:
155
159
QUICK FLASH. Little Candace is asleep on the floor.
Aunt
Helen sits next to Little Charlie on the sofa.
AUNT HELEN
Look, Charlie. She's fast asleep.
160
161
QUICK FLASH.
Aunt Helen points to Little Candace.
AUNT HELEN
Don't wake your sister.
162
162
BACK TO PRESENT.
Charlie enters his house.
SMASH CUT TO:
163
163
QUICK FLASH.
Aunt Helen gets hit by the semi-truck.
164
164
QUICK FLASH.
Little Charlie's mom opens the door to reveal a
policeman.
165
165
BACK TO PRESENT. Charlie is in the same entry hall in the
same house 8 years later. Banging his head against the wall.
"It's my fault. It's all my fault."
He passes the photo wall on the stairs. We see the images of
the family. Church. Communion. Baby pictures. Years of
history staring at us. Ghosts on the wall.
166
166
BACK TO PRESENT. Charlie sits at his desk. We see him from
behind. Perfectly still. Trying to keep himself calm.
CHARLIE
Stop crying.
86.
167
167
QUICK FLASH. Charlie thinks everyone is staring at him. His
sister and her friends. His brother and mother. Mary
Elizabeth and Alice. And worst of all... Sam and Patrick the
night they toasted him. A paranoid nightmare.
168
168
BACK TO PRESENT.
Charlie's falling to pieces.
The tears run
down his face.
CHARLIE
Stop crying.
169
169
QUICK FLASH. Derek hits Candace.
Patrick hits Brad.
The
cafeteria erupts into violence.
And Charlie remembers what he's blacked out.
We see him in the cafeteria. Terrifying. He thinks he sees
Aunt Helen as he breaks the Linebacker's nose. Hits another
in the throat. And pushes another. Charlie looks at his
hand, covered in blood. The whole school staring at him.
170
170
BACK TO PRESENT. Charlie holds his head. Trying to stuff
the pictures back in his brain. But he can't. They keep
coming and coming, faster and faster. Sam's hand, Little
Charlie on top of the stairs, the police telling him Aunt
Helen is dead.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
It'll be our little secret.
We go behind his head. The image moves closer and closer.
Until it feels like we are inside Charlie's mind.
SMASH CUT TO:
171
172
We begin in the house. It's silent. The hallway. The entry
hall. The empty bedroom. Charlie's typewriter on his desk.
88.
It's all so quiet. And then, we see Charlie walking down the
hallway. He turns the corner and enters the...
MATCH CUT TO:
173
173
Kitchen.
One room. Charlie doesn't know where he is
anymore.
The past and present have bled together.
QUICK FLASH. We see Little Charlie turn the corner into the
kitchen. BACK TO PRESENT as 16 year old Charlie stands in
the same kitchen, breathing shallow.
QUICK FLASH. 7 year old Charlie walks up to Aunt Helen
sitting at the kitchen table. BACK TO PRESENT as 16 year old
Charlie begins to have a full blown anxiety attack.
QUICK FLASH. 7 year old Charlie takes Aunt Helen's hand and
turns it over... to reveal her wrist scars.
BACK TO PRESENT as Charlie looks from the table to the
counter with the bread and the KNIVES. He stares at the
knives for a moment. Just as...
The Policemen break down the door.
SMASH CUT TO:
174
174
We see Charlie's reflection in the window. The door opens
slowly, and his psychiatrist, Dr. Burton, enters. She finds
him sitting in the corner. He has been crying.
DR. BURTON
Charlie?
I'm Dr. Burton.
CHARLIE
Where am I?
DR. BURTON
Mayview hospital.
This news hits Charlie hard.
He begins to panic.
CHARLIE
You have to let me go.
My dad can't
afford it.
DR. BURTON
Don't worry about that.
89.
CHARLIE
No. I saw them when I was little. And I
don't want to be a Mayview kid. Just
tell me how to stop it.
DR. BURTON
Stop what?
CHARLIE
Seeing it. All their lives. All the
time. Just... how do you stop seeing it?
DR. BURTON
Seeing what, Charlie?
Charlie breaks.
CHARLIE
There is so much pain.
And I don't know
how to not notice it.
DR. BURTON
What's hurting you?
CHARLIE
No! Not me. It's them. It's everyone.
It never stops. Do you understand?
Dr. Burton smiles, sympathetic. Charlie nods, relieved that
someone finally understands. Until...
DR. BURTON
What about your Aunt Helen?
Like cold water. What was tears is now confusion and soon to
be shame. Dr. Burton is gentle to him.
CHARLIE
What about her?
DR. BURTON
Can you see her?
CHARLIE
Yes, she had a terrible life.
But... I
mean, what am I...
DR. BURTON
You said some things about her in your
sleep.
CHARLIE
I don't care.
90.
DR. BURTON
If you want to get better, you have to--
Charlie looks at her, nodding her encouragement.
CHARLIE
She was... insane.
The minute he says one word of truth, he feels ashamed. He
stops talking. Dr. Burton does not press him. Not today.
DR. BURTON
Charlie, are you going to let me help you
here?
Charlie cries and nods.
CHARLIE
Okay.
DR. BURTON
Do you remember anything before you
blacked out?
CHARLIE
I, uh... I remember leaving Sam's house,
and walking home...
We move away from them as Charlie's voice trails off.
175
175
The sun creeps through the windows. We can hear birds
outside. The intercom is quiet. Charlie is alone. He looks
at Sam's typewriter. "Dear Friend" is already typed.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
I was in the hospital for awhile. I won't
go into detail about all of it. But I
will say there were some very bad days.
And some unexpected beautiful days.
Charlie picks up a get well card from Sam.
176
176
Dr. Burton walks Charlie's parents down the hallway.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
The worst day was the time my doctor told
my mom and dad what Aunt Helen did to me.
In the distance, we see Charlie's mom and dad stop.
Shocked.
91.
177
177
Charlie looks up and sees his mom and dad in the doorway.
MOTHER
Honey?
His mother comes to hold him.
MOTHER (CONT'D)
I'm so sorry.
For a second, we see the emotion his father hides behind the
sports page, before he chokes it down. He walks over to his
son and kisses his forehead.
178
178
Charlie, Chris, and Candace sit on the bed, playing cards.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
The best days were those when I could
have visitors. My brother and sister
always came for those until Chris had to
go to training camp. He's going to be
first string this year. And my sister
told me she met a nice guy at her summer
job.
179
179
Charlie leaves his room with his suitcase in hand.
His
mother waits in the hallway with Dr. Burton.
DR. BURTON
There he is. So, I'll see you Thursday
at 6, right?
Charlie nods and leaves the hospital with his mother.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
My doctor said we can't choose where we
can come from, but we can choose where we
go from there. I know it's not all the
answers, but it was enough to start
putting these pieces together.
Dr. Burton smiles, then turns back into the hospital.
180
180
The family sits at the dinner table.
92.
FATHER
God bless this food that we are about to
receive. We thank You for this bounty in
the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
After they say "Amen," the room falls silent. The family is
on pins and needles. No one touches their food. Until...
CHARLIE
How do you think the Penguins are going
to do this year, dad?
FATHER
God damn Penguins. I think they're
allergic to God damn defense.
CHARLIE
What do the players call a puck again?
FATHER
A biscuit.
CANDACE
Are you sure it's not a "God damn
biscuit?"
FATHER
You're cruisin' for a bruisin'.
As things return to normal, dad picks up his paper. Candace
talks about the books she'll need for college. Everyone
starts eating. And Charlie smiles, happy to just be home.
181
181
Ding dong.
The door opens to reveal Patrick, smiling.
PATRICK
Can Charlie come out and play?
Charlie's mother smiles. Charlie smiles, too. Especially
when he sees... Sam. Standing next to Patrick. Her hair a
little different. Her eyes alive and happy.
182
182
The gang of three sit at their booth. Sam and Patrick have
their coffee. Charlie has his brownie. Like always.
SAM
That first night, I had grilled stickies.
It was so good. You have to visit in the
Fall. We'll have some. Okay?
93.
CHARLIE
Definitely.
PATRICK
Sorry, Sam. Charlie has a breakdown
scheduled for October.
Charlie laughs.
Sam smiles.
After a beat...
SAM
Well, can I tell you something? I've
been away for two months. It's another
world. And it gets better.
(off Charlie's smile)
And my roommate Katie has the best taste
in music.
Sam puts a cassette tape down on the table.
SAM (CONT'D)
I found the tunnel song.
Charlie looks at Sam and Patrick, who smile.
SAM (CONT'D)
Let's drive.
183
184
The three friends are flying down the highway in Sam's truck.
The music blaring. The wind making their hair dance.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
Even if you didn't know what I was
talking about. Or know someone who's
gone through it. It made me not feel
alone.
With Sam's help, Charlie climbs through the little window
94.
185
186
... they enter the tunnel, and we realize just how fast
they're driving. The white tiles of the tunnel whiz by at
blinding speed. A perfect night. A perfect drive. Flying.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
I know these will all be stories someday.
And our pictures will become old
photographs. And we'll all become
somebody's mom or dad. But right now,
these moments are not stories.
Charlie turns to face forward. To the moment.
To Sam,
smiling at him from the front seat.
CHARLIE (V.O) (CONT'D)
This is happening. I am here. And I am
looking at her. And she is so beautiful.
Sam kisses Charlie. Then, she turns, and all three kids look
ahead to everything in front of them. Charlie begins to
stand in the back of the truck. Ready to leave the tunnel.
CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I can see it. This one moment when you
know you're not a sad story. You are
alive. And as you stand up and see the
lights on buildings and everything that
makes you wonder. And you are listening
to that song on that drive with the
people you love most in this world.
Charlie stands in the back of the truck.
The wind on his
face. He is free.
CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
And in this moment, I swear...
95.
We see the moment as Charlie sees it. The tunnel's exit
getting bigger and brighter with the lights of the city
behind it.
CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
... we are infinite.
The tunnel song blasts over the speakers as the truck flies
out of the tunnel. Sam and Patrick scream with excitement.
Charlie holds his arms in the air. The weight of the world
gone. If only for a moment. This one moment. We see the
city. A million lights like white stars in a glass dome. We
crane to the sky. We are in Heaven.
FADE OUT.
