      Alicia and Will walk away from the restaurant.  A second.  
      Then an aside to Will... 

                                  ALICIA
                    McKeon did it.  

      Will pauses, nods:

                                  WILL
                    If it had been under a hundred thou , I 
                    would ve said  no.   Over a hundred thou ...

                                  ALICIA
                    What about  well over? 

      Will looks at her.  Good point.


      A brownstone.  On a quiet tree-lined street.  Inside... 


      College campus.  Frat row.  An eternal party.  STUDENTS pass 
      Alicia who talks on her cell, walking behind Kalinda: 

                                  ALICIA
                    Look, I m getting home late.  Could 
                    you ask grandma to stay till ten?

      INTERCUT with...


      Alicia now stands with Kalinda on the party doorstep, waiting, 
      Alicia watching...

      ...the stripper inside.  The lone woman.  Forcing one of the 
      HUSKY FRAT BOYS to kneel, pulling out cuffs as the party goes 
      wild.  Alicia watches.  Not prudishly.  If anything there s a 
      slight smile on her face at the ludicrousness of this: the 
      ludicrousness of sex.  While... 

      ...Kalinda sees a FRAT BOY approaching, swaying, eyeing her.

                                  KALINDA
                    No.

    The only word needed.  The kid slinks off.  As Collin Grant 
      exits the party.  The driver.  Granite bodybuilder.  Shaved 
      head.  Thinks he s Secret Service.

                                  GRANT
                    Five minutes.  

                                  ALICIA
                    We understand you can corroborate 
                    Christy s story.  

                                  GRANT
                    Which was?

                                  ALICIA
                    She told you about the rape right 
                    after it happened.  

      Grant shakes his head at a frat boy trying to get in:

                    Well, look, I like Christy-- she s 
                    a good tipper-- but when she 
                    drinks, she doesn t know what the

      Alicia and Kalinda stare at him.  Uh-oh.  

                                  KALINDA
                    But you do?   

                                  GRANT
                    Hey, it s my job. Christy gave him a lap 
                    dance. He paid her; we went home; and no 
                    one said anything about any rape. I don t 
                    blame Christy for trying to get some extra 
                    cash out of McKeon, but, hey, she s lying.  

      Alicia and Kalinda just stare.  Oh shit.

      Alicia s face.  Distracted.  Thinking.  Where is she?  Bzzt--
      a minimum security gate opens, slides across her face.  Oh. 


    For a moment it looks like lovers strolling in a park.  
      Alicia and PETER.  Making the circuit of the prison yard. In 
      silence.  Not uncomfortable silence.   He looks good.  In 
      control.  Bill Clinton in prison.  Mid-conversation:

                                  ALICIA
                    So?  

                                  PETER FLORRICK
                    I don t know; do they wantto see me?  

      Alicia takes a second, and Peter guesses:

                                  PETER FLORRICK (CONT D)
                    Zach does, Grace doesn t?

                                  ALICIA
                    Well, she s hurt.  She thought you 
                    were everything.

      Peter nods, looks off, upset.  Alicia eyes him, moved.  
      Despite herself.  Another CONVICT nods to Peter passing.

                                  ALICIA (CONT'D)
                    So two months in, you seem well.  

                                  PETER FLORRICK
                    I am.  Some good guys in here.  
                    There s probably less backstabbing 
                    than in the State s Attorney office. 

      Alicia smiles, Peter too.  He eyes her.  

                                  PETER FLORRICK (CONT'D)
                    You look good, Alicia.

                                  ALICIA
                    Business attire.

                                  PETER FLORRICK
                    No, no, you look good.  Like it 
                    agrees with you.

      Alicia shrugs.  Lets the compliment rest there as they sit at 
      a table.  Peter lowers his voice, no guards nearby...

                    So here s the thing about Childs.  
                    Everything he does is a political 
                    calculation; everything he--

                                  ALICIA
                          (not unkind)
                    Peter, no.  We can t be doing this.

                                  PETER FLORRICK
                    Yes, we can. Illinois Court rule 
                    1.6(c).An attorney can use any--  

                                  ALICIA
                    No, no, I mean... I don t want to 
                    be used.   

                                  PETER FLORRICK
                    Look, I know you don t believe me, 
                    Alicia, but Childs set me up-- and 
                    if what I give you can help a rape 
                    victim, what s wrong with that?     

      Alicia stops, stares at him.

                                  ALICIA
                    How did you know she was a rape victim?  
                          (Peter pauses)
                    Peter?  I never told your mom.  

                                  PETER FLORRICK
                    Ryan told me.

                          (confused)
                    Your appellate lawyer?  

                                  PETER FLORRICK
                    Yeah.  He was the one who referred 
                    Christy to you.  What s wrong?

                                  ALICIA
                          (thinking this through)
                    I m hard pressed to think what s 
                    notwrong.  So... he what?

                                  PETER FLORRICK 
                      I mentioned to Ryan you were at Stern, 
                    Lockhart, and if he didn t have time 
                    for Christy s case, maybe you would.  
                    I thought you d want the work.  You re 
                    looking at me like I m crazy.

      Alicia closes her eyes.  Realizing:

                    Oh my god, you had sex with her.

                    You re using her first name, Peter.  
                    You re saying  Christy.   She s one

                    Alicia, stop it.  

    But Alicia stands, sickened.  Peter gets up too, chases.

                    Alicia.  Please!  When will you stop 
                    thinking I slept with everyone?!  
                    When will you forgive me?  

      He s genuine.  Real.  Hurt.  Okay, Alicia comes back to him.

                    You had sex with her, what, ten 
                    times?  Twenty times? 

                                  PETER FLORRICK
                    You don t really want to--

                    $60,000?  Did you pay her not to 
                    use condoms?  Was that extra?

                    The rape kit came back and it s not

                    Grant says you re lying.  McKeon

                    Well, you obviously had sex with 
                    someone.  Because it s not his

                    another client.  Maybe you re still

      Christy looks at her, eyes wet.  Quiet.
