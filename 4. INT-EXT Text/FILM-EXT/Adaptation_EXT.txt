Endless barren landscape. No sign of life. The atmosphere
is hazy, toxic-looking. Volcanoes erupt. Meteors bombard.
Lightning strikes, concussing murky pools of water. Silence.
A lonely two-lane highway cutting through swampland.
BRITISH NARRATOR
As natural selection works solely by and
for the good of each being, all corporeal
and mental endowments will tend to
progress towards perfection.
Suddenly, a beat-up white van barrels around a curve.
It's
followed closely by an old green Ford.

John Laroche is a tall guy, skinny as a
stick, pale-eyed, slouch-shouldered and
sharply handsome despite the fact that he
is missing all his front teeth.
In the window, lit by a single desk lamp, a woman types.
Hot, dirty, miserable. Laroche leads the Indians through
waist-high black water. He points out a turtle on a rock.

LAROCHE
Pseudemys floridana. Did you fellas know
you fellas believe the world rests on the
back of a turtle? Not you fellas
specifically. Although, maybe you fellas
specifically. That I can't speak to.
The Indians ignore him. They trudge. Laroche spots
something else, a dull green root wrapped around a tree. He
stops, circles the tree. His eyes widen in reverent awe.
LAROCHE (cont'd)
Polyrrhiza Lindenii.
A ghost.
The Indians come around. Laroche stares at a single
beautiful, glowing white flower hanging from the tree.
He
tenderly caresses the petals. Then, business-like:
LAROCHE (cont'd)
Cut it down, Russell.
Russell pulls out a hacksaw, begins sawing through the tree.
As Laroche supervises, Randy, Russell, and Vinson saw through
tree branches supporting lovely flowering orchids. They
unceremoniously stuff the flowers into bulging pillowcases.
Tony waits, sweaty and mosquito bitten.
The radio crackles.
RADIO VOICE
How's that Injun round-up going, Tony?
TONY
Fuck you, Barry, you fuckin'...
Rustling near the parked cars. Tony tenses. Laroche steps
from the swamp with the Indians, who haul the pillowcases.
TONY (cont'd)
We got poachers.

We got fuckin' poachers, Barry.

Tony jumps into the truck and turns it around.

Laroche loved orchids but I came to

fatality of getting them almost as much
as he loved the orchids themselves.
Tony steps out of his truck.
Laroche smiles warmly.
TONY
Morning. May I ask what you gentlemen
have in those pillowcases?
LAROCHE
Yes, sir, you absolutely may.

Laroche goes back to directing the Indians.
Tony's confused.
TONY
Okay, I'm asking then.
LAROCHE
Oh, Okay then! Let's see...
(peeking in bags)
Five kinds of bromeliad, one peperomia,
nine orchid varieties. About a hundred
and thirty plants all told, which my
colleagues have removed from the swamp.
TONY
You're aware that it's illegal to remove
plants or animals from state owned land?
LAROCHE
And don't forget these plants are all
endangered, sir. Every one of them.
TONY
Exactly. Well, that's exactly the issue.
This is a state preserve.
LAROCHE
Yes, sir, it is.
(afterthought)
Oh, and my colleagues are all Seminole
Indians. Did I mention that? You're
familiar, I'm sure, with the State of
Florida v. James E. Billie.
Tony nods, even though he has no idea.
LAROCHE (cont'd)
So you know that even though Seminole
Chief Billie killed a Florida panther,
one of, what, forty in the entire world?
Laroche looks to the Indians for confirmation.
They give it.
LAROCHE (cont'd)
The state couldn't successfully prosecute
him. Because he's an Indian and it's his
right. As repugnant as you or I as white
conservationists might find his actions.
TONY
But --

LAROCHE
Not to mention the failed attempts on
three separate occasions to prosecute

Laroche again looks to the Indians for confirmation.
RUSSELL
He's right. That's exactly what we use
them for. Chickee huts.

He thinks he hears the word "Fatso." The girls giggle.
Ranger, sheriff, and state police cars are parked near the
van and Ford. Lots of sweating, uniformed people. The
pillowcases have been emptied, the plants lie on black
plastic sheets. A guy sprinkles water on them. Laroche
enthusiastically helps Ranger Mike Owen catalogue the
flowers. The Indians lean against their car, bored and
smoking. Nirvana seeps tinnily out the car window.
LAROCHE

MIKE OWEN
I'm sorry, Encyclia what?
LAROCHE

Coch-le-ata. Tem-pen-sis.

Okay, let's see, twenty-two Epidendrum

Orlean exits the courthouse and watches Laroche in a huddle
with Lerner, Vinson, and Buster Baxley, vice-president of the
tribe's business operations. They're all smoking intently.
LAROCHE
They're gonna fucking crucify me.
BAXLEY
I'll go into the Fakahatchee with a
chainsaw. I swear to God.
LERNER
Buster, for crying out loud, I reminded
her the Indians used to own Fakahatchee.
Look, we'll deal with all this at trial.
Buster waves a dismissive hand at Lerner, walks away. Vinson
shrugs, stubs his cigarette, follows Buster. Lerner and
Laroche stand there a moment. Lerner walks off. Laroche
cracks his neck. A charmingly shy Orlean approaches.

ORLEAN
Right. So I was interested in doing a
piece about your situation down here.
Laroche scowls, smokes furiously, then, a test:
LAROCHE
Yeah? Put this in: I don't care what
goes on here. I'm right, and I'll take
this all the way to the Supreme Court.
That judge can screw herself.
Orlean scribbles on her pad. Laroche twists his head to see
that she's writing "Judge can screw herself."
LAROCHE (cont'd)
That for real would go in?
Orlean nods.
Laroche smiles his toothless smile at Orlean.

SENSUOUS FEMALE NARRATOR
The Orchidaceae is a large, ancient

Orlean nods, climbs in, and tries to rearrage some of the
junk on the front seat so she'll have a place to sit.

Sit on top of that. You won't hurt it.
She situates herself on the seat.
Laroche lurches off.
Old black and white footage, taken from up high, of two 19th

ORLEAN (V.O.)
Men from Florida dominated the orchid
hunting scene. Hunters in the
Fakahatchee hauled out thousands of
orchids in horse-drawn flatbed carts.
The camera swoops down, close to the men. As it does, the
image transforms. It turns to color, the men become
mannequins, the horse becomes papier-mache: it's a display.
A live man in modern work clothes is arranging actual orchids
in the cardboard cart.
Kaufman walks alone among the crowd of orchid enthusiasts,
past a Santa Barbara Orchid Society sign. He tries to study
the flowers. They are dull. He forces himself to look.
ORLEAN (V.O.)

sadness of the world.
He is sick with adoration for the women, who pay him no mind.
ORLEAN (V.O.) (cont'd)
Nothing in science can account for the
way some people feel about orchids.
Those love them, love them madly.
One by one the women turn to the men they're with: a whisper
in the ear, a shared look, an arm slipped through an arm.
Kaufman is alone in this sea of people and flowers.
Teenaged Laroche and his mother tromp through the swamp. He
carries a camera on a tripod. They spot a beautiful flower.
Laroche is in awe.
TEENAGED LAROCHE
Encyclia tempensis. The butterfly.
Laroche sets up the tripod, focuses on the flower.
His
mother almost cries at the flower's beauty.

"You will find something more in woods

Laroche shows the flower to Orlean.
LAROCHE
See that nectary all the way down there?
Darwin hypothesized a moth with a nose
twelve inches long to pollinate it.
Everyone thought he was a loon. Then,
sure enough, they found this moth with a
twelve inch proboscis -- proboscis means
nose, by the way -- and --
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
ORLEAN
I know what proboscis means.
LAROCHE
Every one of these flowers has a specific
relationship with the insect that
pollinates it. There's an orchid that
looks exactly like this particular
insect. So the bug humps the flower and
gets covered with its pollen. Thusly...
Laroche mimes humping.
ORLEAN
I get it.
LAROCHE
That's called pseudo-copulation. These
flowers are smart! You gotta fall in
love with them. Once you learn anything
about orchids, you'll devote your life to
learning everything about them.
Orlean looks around: people sniffing flowers, feeling petals,
staring deep into nectaries. People jabber passionately,
people buy plants, people carry boxes of purchased plants.
Orlean looks deeply into various flowers, at a dizzying array
of colors and shapes, but remains detached.
The seven year old girl swings sadly by herself. From high

The pioneer-adventurers in Florida had to

place might have hidden in it.
The scene turns into color. The men turn into mannequins.
The floor is covered with black cellophane representing swamp
water. The swamp turns to cardboard, with real orchids
hanging from the trees. A guy carrying some orchids walks on

It's a busy street full of discount cigarette stores.
Laroche and Orlean step from his van, head toward the store.

The sky is overcast. Mike Owen leads Kaufman through a cool
swamp, which is completely dry. The two men walk easily on

head to foot in unnecessary protective clothing, tries to be
interested in Owen's lecture.
MIKE OWEN
So the whole ecosystem is six thousand
years old. Five to six thousand years
old. About that. Five or six.
KAUFMAN
Okay.
MIKE OWEN
Now the Fakahatchee is the largest of all
the cyrpess strands, probably in the

strand bigger. It's about twenty miles

Why isn't it wet? Orlean wrote about
wading through black, corrosive water.
She said it was the scariest experience
of her life. And when I spoke to you on

MIKE OWEN
There's usually water. We've been going

you seen that movie, Medicine Man?
That's a good movie about protecting
nature. It shows there could be
something important in a rain forest we
don't even know about, like a cure for
cancer.
KAUFMAN
It's not even hot. I was expecting it to
be awful. Sun beating down, wading
through water, looking out for snakes,
wild hogs. I was thinking it would be
dramatic. Alligators. Something!

The alligators are over by the lakes.
The temperature's a blessing for us.
This time of year can get uncomfortably

Green anole. Florida's most common.
Kaufman looks down and sees a plain-looking little lizard
hanging on a tree. Mike Owen jots it down in his notebook.
MIKE OWEN (cont'd)
I try to keep a log of sightings.
Kaufman and Owen stand by Kaufman's car.
MIKE OWEN
What Laroche did was wrong. Those
flowers belong to all of us, all 250
million of us -- 250? I think it's up to
270 now -- And belonging to all of us
means they belong to none of us. Nobody
has a right to take them. Not me, not
you, not John Laroche, not...
Kaufman is desperate for something else.
He blurts:
KAUFMAN
Listen, um, Susan Orlean wrote about a
legendary creature called a Swamp Ape.
Have you ever heard stories or --
MIKE OWEN
(pissy)
Tourist garbage! I don't know why people
need to invent silly creatures to make
nature fascinating. Isn't nature amazing

KAUFMAN

Laroche pulls a new pack of cigarettes out of his pocket.
Orlean turns off the ignition and stares at the steering

Kaufman, sweaty and anxious, walks along. He arrives at the
New Yorker building and enters with steely determination.
Laroche and Orlean step off the levee into black water. They
sink to their knees. The ground is soft; it's a struggle to
pull their feet up to walk. Things slither past in the

opening the backpack and pulling out food. Finally, Laroche
speaks without looking up.
LAROCHE
We're not lost.
Laroche takes out a cigarette, lights it.
LAROCHE (cont'd)
I'm just turned around a little.
He looks up at her, sees her staring at him. He pokes around
on the ground for something, comes up with a straight twig.
LAROCHE (cont'd)
A sundial. I'll just set this up, wait a
few minutes, and we'll be able to tell
which way the sun is moving. We want to
be heading southeast.
Laroche sticks the twig into the ground, stares at it.
LAROCHE (cont'd)
This is no big deal. You should eat
something.
Orlean takes a cracker. This relaxes Laroche. He stretches
his legs, knocks over the twig. Without looking at Orlean,
he puts the twig back.
(CONTINUED)
83.
CONTINUED:
LAROCHE (cont'd)
So do you collect anything?
ORLEAN
(non-responsive)
Not really.
LAROCHE
Well, y'know it's not really about
collecting the thing, it's about --
ORLEAN
The sundial isn't working.
Laroche looks down at it.
LAROCHE
It is so working.
Orlean stares at the twig in the ground. She looks at
Laroche. Laroche smiles sheepishly at Orlean. Rage and
panic sweep across her face, her fists clench into balls.
Her eyes become wild, some dark fantasy plays out in her
brain. Laroche seems unaware.
LAROCHE (cont'd)
The thing about computers. The thing I
like is that I'm immersed in it but it's
not a living thing that's going to leave
or die or something. I prefer having the
minimum number of living things to worry
about in my life.
Orlean's anger softens.
She looks sadly at Laroche.
ORLEAN
So, John...
LAROCHE
Okay, fuck the sundial. We'll just go
straight and eventually we'll get there.
They rise.
LAROCHE (cont'd)
What I mean is we'll get somewhere. Out
of here. I mean, logically, we have to
get out as long as we walk straight.
Laroche points them in a direction and they walk.
84.
Kaufman wanders. He eyes other sad-looking, balding,
overweight men wandering the streets also.
KAUFMAN (V.O.)
I am fat. I can't write. I am
repulsive. I am old. I have
accomplished nothing. I am just one more
old, fat, bald man on the street.
Laroche leads the way. There's a sadness, a sense of defeat
and humiliation that he tries to conceal. Orlean is stony.
LAROCHE
I've done this a million times. Whenever
everything's killing me, I just say to
myself, screw it, and go straight ahead.
Laroche leads Orlean back into the brush.
Kaufman sees a white school building ahead, glowing in the
sun. He walks toward it.
Students exit onto the street in small groups. Kaufman
wanders by himself. His face is troubled. There is no sound.
88.
The daguerreotype Darwin, the Aristotle sculpture, the Hegel
engraving, and the Orlean book jacket photo are alive and in
the middle of brutal and bloody fist fight.
The last of the students are filing out. Kaufman waits,
leaning against the building. McKee emerges, carrying his
brown leather bag. A shaky, tired Kaufman approaches him.
KAUFMAN
Mr. McKee?
MCKEE
Yes?
KAUFMAN
I'm the guy you yelled at this morning.
(CONTINUED)
91.
CONTINUED:
MCKEE
(trying to recall)
I need more.
KAUFMAN
I was the one who thought things didn't
happen in life.
MCKEE
Oh, right, okay.
Nice to see you.
KAUFMAN
I need to talk.
MCKEE
I make it a rule not to give private
tutorials to my seminar students. It
wouldn't be fair to the others.
KAUFMAN
Mr. McKee, please. My even standing here
is very scary. I don't meet people well.
I'm self-conscious and timid. But what
you said this morning shook me to the
bone. What you said was bigger than my
screenwriting choices. It's about my
choices as a human being. Please.
McKee hesitates for a moment, then reaches out and puts his
arm around Kaufman.
MCKEE
I could use a drink, my friend.
Laroche and Orlean slog through the water with purpose,
looking only straight ahead. As they walk the sounds and
colors become subdued. Soon there is silence.
ORLEAN (V.O.)
We turned to the right and saw only more
cypress and palm and sawgrass
They turn left and see metal flashing in the sunlight.
ORLEAN (V.O.) (cont'd)
So we turned to the left, and there, far
down the diagonal of the levee, we could
see the gleam of a fender. We followed
it like a beacon all the way to the road.
Orlean and Laroche walk toward the car.
92.
Orlean talks on the phone.
Donald trails close behind her.
ORLEAN
So you'll pick me up?
Yeah, tomorrow.
Orlean stops to look in a shoe store window. Donald stops
and looks in the window also. Orlean doesn't notice him.
ORLEAN (cont'd)
Ten-twenty. TWA. Yes, of course I will.
Donald walks off.
Orlean waits with a suitcase outside the terminal. The beat-
up white van pulls up. Orlean gets in, the van speeds off.
Another car pulls away from the curb and follows it.
The van pulls into the driveway of a neat, middle-class
house. Kaufman and Donald drive by, in time to see Orlean
and Laroche emerge from the van. Orlean seems different now:
more exotic. She's wearing some kind of sexy sarong. Donald
drives up the street, parks, gets out of the car, and watches
as Laroche lugs Orlean's suitcase into the house.
DONALD
I'll get a closer look.
You wait here.
KAUFMAN
(momentously)
No, I want to go. I should go. I mean,
it should be me, right? I mean...
DONALD
Go for it, bro. You the man.
Kaufman gets out of the car. Donald gets in, peruses
Kaufman's script. Kaufman walks past the house, trying to
peer in windows. He sees nothing. He slinks around back.
(CONTINUED)
99.
CONTINUED:
In the yard, Kaufman finds a greenhouse.
It's filled with
row upon row of ghost orchids.
KAUFMAN
Holy...
There's movement in a window in the house.
Kaufman ducks.
LAROCHE (O.S.)
Darlin', I dunno what's come over you!
Kaufman crawls over to the house, lifts his face to the
window. Orlean and Laroche are laughing, kissing, groping,
and undressing each other. Kaufman is heartbroken but
transfixed. Suddenly Laroche locks eyes with Kaufman.
ORLEAN
Don't stop, Johnny.
Laroche jumps up and runs naked to the back door.
ORLEAN (CONT'D)
Johnny! Where are you going?
Kaufman makes a mad dash around the side of the house.
Laroche cuts him off, grabs him, drags him into the house.
Laroche leads Orlean through the swamp. He spots something
on a tree, circles it, and stands there, awestruck. Orlean
comes around and sees a beautiful ghost orchid hanging from
the tree.
LAROCHE
The jewel of the Fakahatchee.
Orlean looks at it, tries to feel some passion for it, can't.
(CONTINUED)
104.
CONTINUED:
ORLEAN
I still don't get it. I mean, there it
is. I can see it's pretty, but --
LAROCHE
You'll get it.
Laroche pulls a saw from his bag and cuts the branch.
Laroche parks. Kaufman parks behind him. Orlean gestures
with her gun for him to get out. As Kaufman comes around the
car, he sees Donald on the floor of the back seat. Laroche
emerges from his van with a flashlight and a rifle slung over
his shoulder. Orlean prods Kaufman to follow him. Kaufman
shakes and whimpers as they all step down into the thigh-high
water. They slog through silently. Laroche stops.
LAROCHE
This spot looks good.
(thinking aloud)
Now how do we do this? Hit him in the
head with a rock first? Keeping in mind
we can only hit him once and only with as
much force as would be created by him
slipping and falling onto the rock.
Laroche paces. Orlean finds a place to sit on a hammock.
She unwraps a small square of paper and snorts something out
of it. Kaufman shivers. Orlean's drugs kick in.
ORLEAN
Holy Jesus. Holy...
Hey, baby, hey...
Orlean trails off.
Laroche talks to the spaced out Orlean.
LAROCHE
Should we drown him, then hit him on the
head? Uh-uh. A body bleeds different if
the heart's stopped. These new forensic
guys are very smart. We really have to
know our corpses to stand a chance: rigor
mortis, lividity, putrefecation, ocular
changes.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
106.
CONTINUED:
LAROCHE (cont'd)
Maybe you think we hit him on the head
and force water into his lungs after he's
dead? No, darlin'. They'll know he
didn't drown. See, contrary to popular
belief, the lungs do not -- do not --
fill with water in a drowning. What
happens is, choking causes an irritation
of the mucous membranes. This creates a
shitload of mucus in the windpipe.
Efforts to breathe turn the mucus into a
sticky foam which may or may not mix with
vomit. It's the presence of this white
foam that indicates drowning. There's a
lot to be aware of, Susie. Shoeprints,
hair, microscopic fibers. Tire tracks.
They all tell a tale to today's forensic
scientists.
(to Kaufman)
What do you think? You're a writer. How
would you do it? What's a good way to
kill somebody?
KAUFMAN
I don't write this kind of bullshit.
LAROCHE
Don't get all huffy, I was simply --
Suddenly Laroche gets whacked in the back, flies forward into
the water. Orlean looks up, spaced.
She's confused by a
second Kaufman standing there with a bag of potting soil.
Donald grabs Kaufman and they run back toward the road.
Laroche pulls himself from the water.
LAROCHE (cont'd)
Fuck!
ORLEAN
(receptively)
Yeah, let's, baby.
She staggers moonily toward Laroche.
He pushes her away.
LAROCHE
Not now. We got to kill that guy. And
now I guess that other guy as well.
ORLEAN
(disappointed)
Ohhh.
107.
The sun is high. Fires smoulder. A tow-truck extricates one
of the crashed vehicles. State police cars, ambulances,
ranger trucks abound. Kaufman is wrapped in a blanket.
(CONTINUED)
115.
CONTINUED:
He is with a cop and pointing to the bodies spread on a black
plastic tarp.
KAUFMAN
That's Mike Owen. John Laroche. Susan
Orlean. I don't know what that is. I
think it might be a Swamp Ape. And
that's Donald, my twin brother. He saved
my life.
Kaufman cries a little.
The cop waits sympathetically, then:
POLICE OFFICER
You two really look alike.
KAUFMAN
(proudly)
Yeah. Yes, we do.

An enormous chunk of rock, dimly lit by faraway stars, floats
by. Silence.
