      Imagine the giant platform at the end of Close Encounters 
      mixed with the crowded anxiety of Ellis Island.  A throng of 
      SETTLERS mill in orderly fashion, dressed in comfortable 
      clothing suitable for a tropical climate.  Every adult 
      carries a large hiking-style BACKPACK. 

                                  NATIONAL ANCHOR (V.O.)
                    One thousand brave men and women, 
                    preparing to embark on the most 
                      incredible journey ever taken. 

      A thousand faces, a million emotions.                                                                                      2.

                    Some are specialists, chosen for 
                    their skills or knowledge.  Most 
                    are average citizens, chosen by a 
                    global lottery.  All carry with 
                    them the hope of humanity.  

      We focus on one of them: JIM SHANNON, 40, husband, father, 
      everyman.  Also killer, soldier, convict, but we ll get to 
      that later.  Right now, while everyone around him is hopping 
      with excitement, Jim is silent and intense, scanning for a 
      face he does not see. 

                                  ELIZABETH
                    Where is he?

      Jim s wife, ELIZABETH, the rock of her family, is quietly 
      cracking under pressure.  Jim continues to scan.

                                  JIM
                    He ll be here.  Go to the kids.

      Finally, Jim catches the eye of a TECHNICIAN in coveralls.  
      The Tech holds his look, then walks away, and Jim pushes 
      through the crowd to follow him, passing under a PLASMA 
      SCREEN showing the news coverage.

      walks in front of a giant display screen (a la the CNN set)

                    itself.  A fracture that may be

                    largest particle accelerator ever 
                      constructed, into a doorway that

                    our second chance.  We must not 
                    make the same mistakes.


      Away from the crowd, Jim catches up with the Technician near 
      the back wall of the cavernous space, behind some machinery. 

                                  JIM
                    You re late.

                    So was your bank transfer.  Hurry 
                    up.

      Technician opens a door to a service tunnel, where a LARGE 
      BACKPACK sits identical to the one Jim is wearing.

      Jim checks the new pack.  We don t see what s inside, and we 
      can t read his face.  The Tech watches him carefully.  Jim 
      stands and shrugs off his pack, hands it to the Technician.

      Jim hefts the new pack onto his back with some effort.  He 
      turns to the Technician, but the man is already walking away. 
      Jim walks back to the staging platform.

      He does not see the SECURITY GUARD who spots him leaving.

                                                                            CUT TO:

                    all the countries were smushed into

                    Well, technically it s not our 
                    past, right?  I mean we re stepping 
                    onto a parallel Earth, creating an 
                    alternate timeline.  But for some 
                    reason that s confusing to people 
                    so everyone just says  our past. 

      Her brother, JOSH SHANNON, 20, leans in front of her.

                                  JOSH

      Josh s smile drops when he sees Jim walk into frame.

                                  REPORTER
                    Ah, and this must be Dad...                                                                                       5.


      Jim looks at us, realizes the camera is there.

                                  JIM
                    Not now, sorry.

      Jim shoves the camera away, faces his kids.

                                  JIM (CONT D)
                    Where s your Mother?

                    Jim.

      Elizabeth pushes through to them.  Her face asks a question.  
      He answers by taking her hand, looks at Maddy and Josh.

                                  JIM
                    We re all here.

      Maddy looks nervous as hell.  Josh mutters under his breath.

                    Dad...

      Josh looks over Jim s shoulder.  Jim turns his head. 

      The Security Guard who saw Jim is watching him.  Jim looks 
      away, pretending their eyes didn t meet, but they did.

      A huge CLAXON blares.  The Reporter speaks faster.

                                  REPORTER (CONT D)
                    While the accelerator generates the 
                      gargantuan amount of power 
                    necessary to open the conduit for 
                    just three hour- 

      ZIP.  The image goes BLACK.


      The collider powering up 5,000 gigawatts, reminiscent of the 
      Death Star getting ready to fire.


      The portal itself is a six by four foot hole in the epicenter 
      of a gigantic MAGNET RING five stories high.  It looks like a 
      concentric Mayan Calendar of pure technology.  

      A double-wide catwalk leads straight up to the portal, a 
      pitch-black singularity that no light can penetrate.

                                    LOUDSPEAKER (V.O.)
                    Conduit Active.  Awaiting tightbeam 
                      synchronization. 

      The room thrums with power.  Everyone waits with baited 
      breath.  The entire room, silent, on pins and needles.  

                                  NATIONAL ANCHOR (V.O.)
                    And now they wait for a voice from 
                    the other side, from those who have 
                    gone before.  Reaching out across 
                    the divide on a unique frequency 
                    called tightbeam.  The phenomenon 
                    that has allowed us to coordinate 
                    our efforts, and hear about the new 
                    world, since the first man went 
                    through.                                                                                      7.


      A thin, crackly radio signal comes over the speaker, a voice 
      from the other side.

                                    GENERAL HYATT (V.O.)
                    This is Tango November One.  
                      Synchronization achieved.  We are 
                    ready to receive.

      CHEERS erupt from the platform.  On the Plasma Screens, a 
      still-photo of GENERAL HYATT, 50, African American, is 
      displayed to give people at least something to look at.

                                  NATIONAL ANCHOR (V.O.)
                    And that was the voice of General 
                    Irving Hyatt, commander at Fort 
                    Taylor, the immediate destination 
                    for this heroic voyage - the Tenth 
                      Pilgrimage to Terra Nova.

      THE SCREEN - shows an  Artist Rendering  of TAYLOR, a fort-
      town set in a lush green Eden.  Happy Families farm the land.  
        A protective WALL surrounds the enclave.

      The Settlers start to move through, one at a time in pre-
      selected order.  They cross the catwalk into the portal, 
      their bodies simply disappearing into darkness.  One guy 
      raises a VICTORY FIST as he moves through.

      The Shannon family moves closer to the portal, in line with 
      the others, but Jim is starting to sweat.  

      He looks over his shoulder to see the Security Guard staring 
      at him, then commenting into his walkie talkie.

      Jim stares at the portal, willing it closer.  Elizabeth 
      notices the security guard walking this way.

                                  PORTAL SECURITY
                    Sir?  You with the green pack.

      Jim makes eye contact with his family.

                                  JIM
                    Whatever happens, keep going.

      He leaves the line, walks straight toward the Guard, 
      pretending to be jittery.  

                                  JIM (CONT D)
                    I m not sure, I don t know, I m not 
                    sure I can do this.  There s no way 
                    back.  It s forever.                                                                                      8.


                                  PORTAL SECURITY
                    Alright, take it easy.  Breathe.

                                  JIM
                    I need to see a Wellbeing 
                      Operative.  I don t, I don t know.

                                  PORTAL SECURITY
                    Sir, keep calm, follow me.

      Jim follows the Guard away from the line, away from his 
      family who are shocked.  Maddy whispers.  

                                  MADDY
                    Mom, what s he doing?

      Josh, nervous, prods his sister on.


      Guard leads Jim up to a door that leads to a hallway.

                                  JIM
                    I know we had months to prepare...

                                  PORTAL SECURITY
                    It s okay, it happens.  I noticed 
                    something was wrong with you.

      And then Jim PULLS the Guard s GUN right out of his holster. 
      Guard spins to find his gun in his face.

                                  JIM
                    Turn around.

                                  PORTAL SECURITY
                    I have a family.

                                  JIM
                    I m not gonna shoot you.  Turn 
                    around!

      The Guard does, hands up.  Jim PISTOL WHIPS his neck, 
      striking the vagus nerve and knocking him out.  Jim closes 
      the door, stuffs the gun in his belt, folds his shirt over it 
      and begins to quickly walk back toward the portal.

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                    HEY!

      Jim doesn t turn to see who it is.  He just picks up speed.  
      Soon he is running as fast as he can, shouldering past people 
      in line and heading straight for the catwalk.                                                                                      9.


      Jim bears down and runs right into the singularity, one 
      handheld shot that brings us straight through darkness into 
      the blinding DAYLIGHT of


      CLOSE ON A LAPTOP - digital pic and file on JAMES SHANNON.  

      Frank Taylor studies the file, scrolling through the rest of 
      the family.  Clementine is not in there. 

      He looks up as the family is brought into his office.  Their 
      hearts almost stop as they see where Frank is sitting:

      REVEAL his  desk  is set inside the giant SKULL of a T-REX, 
      jaws open in a silent roar, the flesh polished off the bone.

                                  JOSH
                    Whoa...

                                  FRANK
                    You like her, huh?  She didn t like 
                    me, much.

      Frank approaches the family.  Josh offers his hand.

                                  JOSH
                    Commander Taylor, it s an honor.

      Frank glances at his laptop.

                                  FRANK
                    You must be Josh Shannon, age 20, 
                    five eleven, hundred eighty pounds.  
                          (to Jim)
                    Which makes you James Shannon.

                                  JIM
                    Yes, Sir.

                                  FRANK
                    Yes, Sir.
                          (he walks past the women)
                    Elizabeth Shannon.  Madison 
                      Shannon...

      Frank reaches Clementine and stops.  Looks back at Liz.

                                  ELIZABETH
                      Clementine.

                                  FRANK
                    Shannon.

                                  JIM
                    Let me explain.                                                                                    15.


                                  FRANK
                    Why?  You don t think I get it?  
                    Law caps families at two offspring, 
                    you broke the law.  Then you broke 
                    it again by smuggling her here.  
                    How d you swing that, by the way?

                                  JIM
                    We didn t expect our application to 
                    get through the lottery.  Clem was 
                    living with my sister when we found 
                    out it did.  On that day, my 
                    mission became clear.  I wasn t 
                    gonna leave my daughter behind.   

      Frank sizes Jim up, after hearing his own words back at him.

                                  FRANK
                    You re a man of action, aren t you 
                    James?  According to your file, 
                    you re a shift supervisor at the 
                    Protein Twist factory in Boulder...

                                  JIM
                    That s right.

                                  FRANK
                    And this isn t your first brush 
                    with the law.  Spent some time in 
                    prison, for manslaughter.  What was 
                    that about?

      That catches Jim up.  He doesn t like to talk about that in 
      front of his family.  Clem looks up at him.  She didn t know.

                                  JIM
                    That was twenty years ago.  A 
                    different guy.

      Frank holds up the GUN that Jim took from the Security Guard.

                                  FRANK
                    That right?
                          (off Jim s look)
                    It s okay, James.  We need men of 
                    action in Terra Nova.  But the 
                    right kind of action, understand?

                                  JIM
                    I m a father.  I m just trying to 
                    give my family a future, and there 
                    is no future back home.                                                                                    16.


                                  ELIZABETH
                    What would you have done?

                                  FRANK
                      I wouldn t have had the third kid.

      He stares hard at her, then softens for the family.

                                  FRANK (CONT D)
                    Look, I don t really care about 
                      population control laws that don t 
                    apply here.  But the people expect 
                    me to keep the peace, and a lot of 
                    them are gonna hate on you for 
                    bringing this one.

      Jim steps forward.  The Marines tense, but Frank stays them.

                                  JIM
                    You need to do justice, I get that.  
                    I just ask that you do it to me, 
                    and not my family. 

      Frank studies Jim.  Turns to the Marines.

                                  FRANK
                    Why don t you show Elizabeth and 
                    her children to their home.  I want 
                    a moment with James, here.

      Jim turns to his family as the Marines escort them out.

                                  JIM
                    It s okay.

      Jim faces Frank alone.  Frank walks to his laptop.

                                  FRANK
                    We receive a detailed file on each 
                    and every settler, in the months 
                    leading up to translation.  I study 
                    it, and make a list of people I 
                    think are going to be problems.  
                    Who might challenge what I m trying 
                    to achieve here.
                          (beat)
                    You were not on my list.

                                  JIM
                    And I don t intend to be.

                                  FRANK
                    I like you, James.  Tell you what 
                    I m gonna do, I m gonna help you.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    17.

                                  FRANK (CONT'D)
                    I m gonna put you on perimeter 
                    duty, it s the most important job 
                    we have here.  First line of 
                    defense against these sons of 
                    bitches, planting land-mines in the 
                    outer boundary.

      He gestures to the T-Rex skull.  Jim looks apprehensive.

                                  FRANK (CONT D)
                    Everyone will see you re out there  
                    for them, and proving your worth.

                                  JIM
                    Thank you.

                                  FRANK
                    No, Jim.  Thank you.  My best to 
                    your family.

      Off Jim, screwed...


      Liz pumps a solar-powered shower for Clementine, who cleans 
      up behind a blue curtain. Maddy and Josh are arguing.

                                  JOSH
                    Taylor s doing what he has to do.

                                  MADDY
                    You ve just got a crush on him.

                                  JOSH
                    Actually, I remember you having a 
                    crush on him.

                                  MADDY
                    I was twelve.  And he was like Neil 
                    Armstrong then, the whole world 
                    loved him.  Clearly before he went 
                    psycho dictator.                                                                                      18.


                                  CLEMENTINE
                          (from behind curtain)
                    Who s Neil Armstrong?

                                  ELIZABETH
                    He s an explorer, like Christopher 
                    Columbus.  He was the first man on 
                    the moon.

                                  MADDY
                    She knows Christopher Columbus but 
                    not Neil Armstrong?

                                  ELIZABETH
                     She  is your sister, and she is in 
                    fourth grade.

        Clementine s wet head pokes around the curtain.

                                  CLEMENTINE
                    Columbus day is a holiday.  There s 
                    no Armstrong day.

      On Jim, entering:

                                  JIM
                    Good news is there won t be a quiz 
                    on this for a hundred and fifty 
                    million years or so.

                                  MADDY
                    Dad!

      Maddy runs into his arms.  Liz stops pumping the shower, 
      hands a blanket around the curtain.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    Towel off.  Clothes are in there.

                                  JOSH
                    You okay?  

      Jim nods, looks to Liz.

                                  JIM
                    You guys okay?

                                  ELIZABETH
                    Someone had stolen our welcome kit 
                    by the time we got here.  No food.

                                  MADDY
                    Dad, admit to Josh that we re 
                    doomed.  As a race.                                                                                    19.


                                  JIM
                    What?

                                  JOSH
                    She thinks Taylor s the devil.

                                  MADDY
                    It s not just him, it s everyone 
                    going along with him.  Sixty 
                    million square miles of land, more 
                    than enough space to re-settle the 
                    world and he s got everyone locked 
                    down into this five square mile 
                    prison camp.

                                  JOSH
                    Did you not hear the part about the 
                    dinosaurs killing everyone?  The 
                    outer settlements are gone.

                                  MADDY
                    Why do you believe him?  He staged 
                    a coup, he s obviously lying to the 
                      government over the radio...

                                  JOSH
                    How do you know the government s 
                    not the one lying to everyone else?

                                  JIM
                    Alright enough.

                                  JOSH
                    If people knew the truth back home 
                    they d freak out.  The Government 
                    needs Terra Nova to work, it s our 
                    last hope.  The escape hatch.  The 
                    only thing preventing world war!

                                  JIM
                    I said enough.  It s not our 
                    problem.  We re here now, and we ve 
                    got enough trouble.  I ve got to 
                    report to the perimeter tomorrow.

      Elizabeth stands, feeling her stomach drop.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    What do you mean?

                                  JIM
                    It s gonna be okay, it s part of a 
                      clear-and-secure program, making 
                    room for new housing...                                                                                    20.


                                  ELIZABETH
                    You mean outside the walls?

                                  JIM
                    Until they extend the walls, yeah.  
                    It s okay, I gotta do it.
                          (Liz begins to tear up)
                    Liz, stop.  You ve got to do 
                      everything else.  Okay?

                                  ELIZABETH
                          (pulling herself together)
                    Okay.  Okay.

                                  JIM
                    First order of business is food.

      Clem steps out of the shower, re-dressed in same clothes.

                                  CLEMENTINE
                    Mom?

                                  ELIZABETH
                    Not now, honey.

                                  JIM
                    Which means all of you have to find 
                    work, or something to barter.

                                  CLEMENTINE
                    But, I have food.

      Everyone turns to see Clem take out five PROTEIN TWISTS from 
      her pocket, the synthetic food of the future.

                                  JOSH
                      Twisties...

                                  CLEMENTINE
                    I took them before we left.

      Josh and Maddy grab one.   Jim grabs Clementine and scoops 
      her up, peppering her cheek with kisses.  Clem cracks up, 
      giggling.  Elizabeth allows herself a long exhale, wiping 
      tears from her eyes.  

                                  JIM
                    Come outside, I want to show you 
                    guys something.


      Everyone is crowded inside places now, like this bar.  Anyone 
      new to Terra Nova is still shaken, but everyone s who been 
      living here is used to this kind of thing by now.

                                  BARTENDER (O.S.)
                    All clear!  All clear!

      Find Josh as he brings some waters to a table where Liz, 
      Maddy, and Clem are decompressing.

                                  JOSH
                    I think we re safe now.

                                  MADDY
                    Oh, great.                                                                                    33.

                    Aerial attacks are rare, honey, 
                    it s just bad timing.  The lookout 
                    shoulda seen that comin .

                                    CITIZEN TWO
                    Frank is gonna kick his ass.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    My husband s still out there, on 
                    the perimeter.

                                    CITIZEN ONE
                    Don t worry, they ll bring him back 
                    early.

                                  ELIZABETH
                          (to her kids)
                    Let s go wait for him at the gate.

                                  KIM (O.S.)
                    Josh!

      Josh turns to see Kim and Jessica waving him over to the bar, 
      where they are hanging out with some rough looking MEN in 
      painted kevlar.  They look like a gang.

                                  JOSH
                    I ll meet you guys there.  I gotta 
                    see some people about a job.

                                  CLEMENTINE
                    Be careful, Josh.  They look like 
                    bad guys.

                                  JOSH
                    Thanks, Clem.  I will.

                                  MADDY
                    And those girls look like skanks.

                                  JOSH
                    Knew that was coming.

      Josh tries to appear tough and cool as he crosses to the bar.  
      Kim and Sharon are flirting with four of the Raptors.  

                                    JESSICA
                    My heart always starts pounding 
                    after an attack.  Feel my heart.

      WOOD, a killer with spiked hair, happily obliges.  He nods to 
      Josh as he approaches.                                                                                    34.


                                  KIM
                    This is Josh.

                                  WOOD
                    Kim tells us you re looking to join 
                    Raptor Clan.

                                  JOSH
                    I've trained in hunting techniques 
                    for the last five months, logged 
                    over 300 hours in the simulator.  
                    That's more than anyone you'll meet 
                    in this new crop.  Everyone knows 
                    Raptor Clan is the best, I want to 
                    be with the best.

      Wood looks to HAYSBERT, the imposing leader of the Raptors, 
      who turns from his seat at the bar and looks Josh over.

                                  HAYSBERT
                    Your women seem shaken up.  Maybe 
                    you should be with them. 

                                  JOSH
                    They re not... they ll be okay.

      Haysbert turns back to the bar.  Wood offers a drink to Josh.

                                  WOOD
                    Here.  On the house.

      Josh downs the fuel-like moonshine, gags on it.  Wood and the 
      other Raptors laugh.  Wood claps him on the back.  

                                  WOOD (CONT D)
                    You re in luck, kid.  We re 
                      recruiting right now.  C mon.

      Wood exchanges a look with Haysbert, then leads Josh out the 
      back of the bar along with another Raptor.


      General Hyatt leans in to an old school military microphone, 
      connected to a state-of-the-art communications console.

                                    GENERAL HYATT

                    Earth is online.  Over.

      Reveal General Hyatt is reading off a script on a laptop.

                                    GENERAL HYATT
                    This is General Irving Hyatt of the 
                    Terra Nova advance command party, 
                    on behalf of United Earth 
                      Government.  It gives me great 
                    pleasure to report that the tenth 
                    wave of the repatriation program 
                    was a one hundred percent success.

      Reveal Frank Taylor standing over him, supervising.

                                    GENERAL HYATT (CONT D)
                    We look forward to the next wave in 
                    six months, God Willing.

                                  RADIO (V.O.)
                    We have a request for follow-up on 
                    the security breach.  Over.

      Hyatt looks up at Frank, who clicks the mute button.                                                                                    38.


                                  FRANK
                    Guy smuggled his damn kid through.  
                    The breach was on their end.
                          (points to laptop)
                    Ask them this.  

                                    GENERAL HYATT
                    The breach was contained.  A full 
                    report is forthcoming...

      Hyatt grips the microphone.  He is dying to give a full 
      report - that there s been a mutiny.  

      Frank, losing patience, pulls a gun and crosses to a door 
      guarded by a Marine.  He puts his hand on the doorknob.  
      Hyatt nods, defeated.  He leans into the mic.

                                    GENERAL HYATT (CONT D)
                    We have a query regarding the 
                    Uranium our science lab requested.
                          (reads off laptop)
                    It seems to be that less than half 
                    the required amount was sent.

      There s a pause on the line.  Then...

                                  RADIO (V.O.)
                    That s an affirmative.  We crunched 
                    the numbers on our end, and the 
                    amount received should be more than 
                      sufficient for the experiment 
                      described.

      Frank, frustrated, runs his finger across his throat.

                                    GENERAL HYATT
                    Copy that, Mother Earth, and God 
                    Bless.  Terra Nova out-

      Frank cuts the signal.  He stares at Hyatt for a long beat.  
      Then he motions to the Marine, who opens the door.  A four 
      year old boy, HENRY, runs across the room into General 
      Hyatt s arms.  Hyatt holds him tight, emotional.

                                    GENERAL HYATT (CONT D)
                    Hey, bud.  How s Mommy?  She okay?

      Henry nods.

                                  FRANK
                    Your Daddy did a good job, Henry.  
                    He s a good listener.                                                                                    39.


                                    GENERAL HYATT
                    What the hell do you want with 
                    Uranium, Frank?  What are you 
                    doing?

                                  FRANK
                    Play with your son, Irv.  You ve 
                    got ten minutes.

      Frank exits.

                                  MYRA (PRE-LAP)
                    CEO Cameron has suspected 
                      something s wrong for months now...


      Josh steps in to a trailer, led by Wood, the Hunter.  
        Immediately, Josh feels a chill - the trailer is refrigerated 
      like a big meat locker.  Three other HUNTERS in here.  

                                  WOOD
                    Okay, Josh, you want to be a 
                    Raptor, here s where you start.  
                    Meet your first prey of the night.

      Wood steps aside to reveal the CORPSE OF A DINOSAUR on a 
      metal table.  It is five feet long, greenish-grey, with a 
      Raptor-like look to it.  It is the first prehistoric reptile 
      Josh (or we) has seen up close, and he is transfixed.  

                                  JOSH
                      Coelurosaurus...

                                  WOOD
                    Think you can handle him?  

                                  JOSH
                    It s already dead.

      The Hunters laugh.  Wood grins. 

                                  WOOD
                    Hope so.  We bagged him in the 
                    outer boundary.  Bolt through the 
                    head.  Live ammo s for bitches.

      Wood pulls a large HUNTING KNIFE, hands it to Josh.

                                  JOSH
                    What do you want me to do?

                                  WOOD
                    What do you think?  Gut it.  Strip 
                    it.  You want to hunt the big game 
                    here, you better understand it from 
                    the inside out.  Brains go to Sci-
                    Lab, Liver to Med-Lab.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    45.

                                  WOOD (CONT'D)
                    Flank meat to the Butcher.  That 
                    too much for you, simulator-boy?

      Wood steps back with the Hunter who is now spared from this 
      duty.  They smile and kick back to watch Josh, who stands 
      over the dead dinosaur holding a hunting knife, stunned...


      Blood and viscera everywhere.  Josh is having a terrible time 
      trying to dissect the dinosaur, which is the point of the 
      hazing.  The Hunters are hardly paying attention to him 
      anymore, drinking and chatting off to the side.

      As Josh tries not to gag, we can hear Wood shooting the shit 
      in the background, standard Terra Nova gossip:

                                  RAPTOR
                    How much ammo came through in the 
                      re-supply?

                                  WOOD
                    I don t know.  Most of it went 
                    straight to Taylor s men, anyway.

      Josh throws up in a nearby BUCKET.  The Raptors applaud, pro 
      forma, like they have every time he s done this.

      Josh, frustrated, feeling like a dupe, heads back to the 
      Dino.  He lets the knife clatter on the table, about to give 
      up...

      And then he sees it.  

      A tiny GLIMMER.  Inside the meat of the dinosaur.  He picks 
      up the knife and prods.  What is that?

      The Hunters have gone back to their gossip.  They don t 
      notice.  Josh leans forward, working the knife.

                                  JOSH
                    What is that?

      Whatever it is, it s behind the heart.  Josh grabs it with 
      his fingers, pulls it out.  It s...

      A tiny golden CRUCIFIX.

      Josh holds the trinket up to the light, examining it, 
      thinking,  What the fuck?   

      We re thinking the same thing...


      Wood enters, followed by Haysbert, who he went to fetch.

                                  WOOD
                          (laughing)
                    You gotta see this, boss.

      Reveal Josh standing in front of the metal table.  Behind 
      him, the Coelurosaurus is a mess.  A disaster.  But Josh is 
      smiling, confident, even a little smug.

                                  WOOD (CONT D)
                    Say it again, kid.  What you said 
                    to me.

                                  JOSH
                     All done. 

      Wood and the other Raptors break up laughing.  Not Haysbert.

                                  HAYSBERT
                    You think this is the funny?  This 
                    is a game?

                                  JOSH
                    No, Sir.  I think it was a test.

                                  HAYSBERT
                    And you think you passed?

      Josh steps forward.

                                  JOSH
                    Let s just say, I found religion.  

      He holds up the tiny gold cross.  

      A silence falls over the room.

                                  HAYSBERT
                    Where did you get that?

                                  JOSH
                    Right where you put it for me to 
                    find.                                                                                    52.


      He points to the Dinosaur innards.

                                  JOSH (CONT D)
                    Right here.  Behind the heart.  I 
                    mean, there s no way this thing got 
                    digested and ended up there.  It 
                    had to be planted there, 
                      deliberately, by whoever killed 
                    this puppy.
                          (beat)
                    Namely you guys.

                                  HAYSBERT
                    May I see it?

      Josh hands him the gold cross.  Haysbert looks at it, then 
      looks at Wood.  Wood draws his COMBAT KNIFE, looks to Josh. 
      Haysbert shakes his head,  no. 

      Josh realizes they are silently debating whether to kill him 
      or not.  He realizes how trapped he is in here.  

      Haysbert steps close to him, holding the tiny cross up 
      between them.

                                  HAYSBERT (CONT D)
                    You never found this.  You never 
                    saw this.  Understand?

      Josh nods.

                                  HAYSBERT (CONT D)
                    So say it.

                                  JOSH
                    Never found it, never saw it.

      Haysbert smiles coldly, pockets the cross, pats Josh on the 
      shoulder.

                                  HAYSBERT
                    Welcome to the Raptors.

      Haysbert turns and leaves.  Wood and the other Hunters follow 
      him, some throwing glances to Josh.

      Josh stands alone in the trailer, bewildered and shaken.


      A BOUNTY of food; exotic fruit and vegetables, spills over 
      the sides of the low-set table in the Shannon s tent-house.  
      They sit on the floor (there are no chairs), eating.

      Jim has changed shirts.  As he figures out how to peel a 
      strange kiwi-like fruit, he notices Clementine staring at his 
      old shirt in a bucket of water, soaking out the bloodstains.  

      Jim glances from Clem to the others, realizes they are silent 
      because he still is.  He breaks the ice, casual and dry.

                                  JIM
                    I was really worried about you guys 
                    today.

      They stare at him.  He swallows a smile.  Liz throws a piece 
      of fruit at her husband.  Everyone laughs, relaxing a bit.

                                  MADDY
                          (gesturing to the food)
                    Can you believe the people here?  
                    Last night someone steals our 
                    welcome basket, neighbors won t 
                    look us in the eye.  Today it s 
                    like, Dad kills a dinosaur, and 
                    they back up the food truck.  
                      Hypocrites. 

                                  JOSH
                    How about the night before, when we 
                    were having dinner in a different 
                    geologic era?  Everything s 
                    changed, Maddy.  For everybody.  
                    We re the ones who have to adjust. 

      Jim is disturbed by the  hair  on his kiwi fruit.                                                                                    57.


                                  JIM
                    Easier for some things than others.
                          (to Clementine)
                    You got any more of those protein 
                    twists, honey? 

                                  CLEMENTINE
                    You ate  em all.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    Once I figure out how to cook this 
                    stuff, it ll be better.  I ll make 
                    a, you know,  stew. 

                                  JOSH
                    Even better, once I get out on a 
                    hunt, I ll bring us back some meat.

                                  MADDY
                    I thought we all agreed to go 
                      vegetarian here.  We don t know how 
                    human presence affects the food 
                    chain yet. 

                                  JOSH
                    Um, I do.  We re a the top of it.  
                    You don t wait for research to tell 
                    you that.  You just go out there 
                    and take the title.

                                  MADDY
                    Now you sound like Frank Taylor.

                                  JOSH
                    Survival of the fittest, sis.

                                  MADDY
                          (under her breath)
                    We ll see.

                                  JOSH
                    What s that supposed to mean?

                                  JIM
                    You re right, Josh.

      They both look at their Dad.  What?

                                  JIM (CONT D)
                      Everything has changed.  Doesn t 
                    mean we have to let it change us.  
                    The only people we can trust in 
                    this town, are sitting at this 
                    table right now.  Remember that.                                                                                     58.


      Liz senses an extra edge to Jim.  Something hidden.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    Jim, what really happened out there 
                    today?

                                  JIM
                    What Maddy said.  Bagged a 
                    dinosaur, bought us some dinner.

      Liz stares at him.  He grabs a cup, changes the mood.

                                  JIM (CONT D)
                    Let s make a toast.  What should we 
                    toast to? 

                                  JOSH
                    To survival of the fittest.

                                  MADDY
                    To getting it right this time.

                                  JIM
                    Clem?

                                  CLEMENTINE
                    To... whatever... comes next.  I 
                    don t know.

      Jim looks at Liz.  She nods, picks up her cup.

                                  ELIZABETH
                    To whatever comes next.

                                                                            CUT TO:
