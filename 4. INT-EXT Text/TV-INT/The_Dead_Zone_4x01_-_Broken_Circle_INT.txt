          THE SMILING FACE of a perfectly groomed 12-year-old boy --
          GREG STILLSON -- FILLS THE SCREEN.  Greg's grey-blue eyes
          have a devilish twinkle in them as they connect with:


          A PRETTY 14-YEAR-OLD GIRL

          rehearsing with an organist.  She catches the young
          Stillson looking at her and turns away playfully.


          WIDER ON GREG

            Revealing JAMES STILLSON (31) mopping his brow while a
          60ish MINISTER examines a fancy white illustrated BIBLE.

                                        MINISTER
                        I'm sorry Mister Stillson, times
                        are hard.  I can't get my
                          congregation to pick up the Bibles
                        we have.

          James goes to Plan B, producing a stack of index cards.

                                        30-ISH JAMES
                        We'll leave these cards in case
                        one of your parishioners --

          But Young Greg notices a small baseball field, through a
          window, outside the church; and red clay stuck to the

          shoes of the Minister.

                                        YOUNG GREG
                        You a baseball fan, Minister?

          James shoots his son an angry look:  What's he up to?

                                        MINISTER
                        Well, I guess I...

                                        YOUNG GREG
                        I used to play.  Lost interest. 
                        Game got stale.  My Daddy, he
                        bought me a new mitt for Christmas
                        and I couldn't wait to get out
                        and shag some flies.

          Greg takes the white Bible out of the minister's hands.

                                        YOUNG GREG (CONT'D)
                        Bibles are like that new mitt: 
                        they'll make your congregation
                        feel excited about comin' to
                        church.

          The Minister looks at Greg appraisingly, then at James.

                                        MINISTER
                        That's quite a story.

                                        30-ISH JAMES
                          I apologize --

                                        MINISTER
                        I hope you don't mind if I make
                        it my own for this Sunday's sermon? 
                        We'll take a dozen.  You don't
                        mind singles, do you?

                                        30-ISH JAMES
                                (slightly dumbfounded)
                        Singles'll be just fine.

          As he counts out the money into James' hand, Greg beams
          at the girl; he's been showing off.  The transaction
            complete, the Minister moves away.  Dad's proud grin is
          quickly replaced by an angry scowl as he yanks young Greg
          out the door...



          Now we're close on the face of the present-day GREG
            STILLSON, a faraway look in his eye.  JAKE TRUAX, one of
          his senior staff members sits across from him.

                                        STILLSON
                                  (refocusing)
                        New management.

                                        TRUAX
                          A senior consultant.  Best in the
                          business.  We bring him aboard,
                        he's gonna want to make changes.

          His eyes go to current-day JAMES STILLSON, who's across
          the room, finishing a phone call.  Greg looks conflicted.

                                        STILLSON
                        I'll think about it.

          Oblivious, his father hangs up and approaches with a grin.

                                        JAMES
                        Ready for some good news?

                                        STILLSON
                        Always.

                                        JAMES
                        Looks like your "pal" Johnny Smith
                        is about to have brain surgery. 
                        Maybe we'll be rid of that psycho
                        once and for all.

                                        STILLSON
                          "Psych-ic," not "psych-o."

          James doesn't like to be corrected in public.

                                        STILLSON
                                (to Truax)
                        We make that call to Justice?

                                        TRUAX
                        Johnny Smith gets out of the
                          hospital, he's gonna find himself
                        up to his neck in Federal Agents.

                                        STILLSON
                        If he gets out.

          And off Stillson, that same devilish twinkle in his eyes...

                                                                          TIME CUT TO:

          CLOSE ON JOHNNY as his eyes open.  He's in a hospital
          bed, his head heavily bandaged.  He tries to sit up but
          has difficulty moving.  Disoriented and scared, he sees --

          BRUCE AND A NURSE

          enter.  The nurse checks Johnny's vital signs.

                                        BRUCE
                        Hey.  How are you doing?  

                                        JOHNNY
                        What happened?  

                                        BRUCE
                        You don't even remember, do you?  

                                        JOHNNY
                        No.

                                        BRUCE
                        Excuse us.

          Bruce gestures to the nurse, who leaves.

                                        BRUCE
                        You must have blacked out after a
                        vision.  When I found you I thought
                        you were having another seizure,
                        so I took you to the E.R.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What... happened?  

                                        BRUCE
                        The doctors said you might slip
                        back into a coma.  Sarah consented
                        to the surgery.  That was two
                        days ago.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (piecing it together)
                        ...the operation... my visions?

                        We don't know.  It was an eleven
                        hour operation.  They said the
                        risk was too high.  Like you were
                          carrying a time bomb in your head.

                        Maybe we should check with the
                        doctor.

          Bruce opens the patient cubby next to the bed and extracts
          Johnny's cane.  He hands it to Johnny, who grips it.  No
          WHOOSH.  No visions.  Nothing.

          Walt and Sarah ENTER.

                                        WALT

          Johnny reaches out and touches Walt, then Sarah.

                        My visions.  They're gone...

                        You did the right thing.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Where's Rebecca?  

          Bruce, Sarah and Walt exchange glances.  No one wants to
          field this one.

                                        SARAH

          Johnny tries to sit up in bed but is stopped by a NURSE
          as we realize that the entire surgery has been a vision.

                        Excuse me.  You have a patient
                        named John Smith.  What room is
                        he in?

                        I'm sorry, we can't give out any
                          information --

          But Pendragon just takes a clipboard off the counter,

                        The son of a bitch is gone.

          And as he glares at Walt and exits...

          FADE IN:

            (FORMERLY SCENE 100) 

          Johnny, in the passenger seat, is just waking up.  When
          the car hits a bump he straightens himself up in the seat. 
          He's a bit freaked out --

                                        JOHNNY
                        Where are we?

                                        BRUCE
                        Just north of D.C.  How you
                          feeling?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Like a man who needs brain surgery.

                                        BRUCE
                        You know how dangerous this is,
                        right?  For all you know, you're
                        next vision could be your last.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What choice do I have?

                                        BRUCE
                        You had a vision that Stillson
                        was going to be killed by Rebecca --

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yes -- and in the same vision you
                        told me that she was killed doing
                        it.

          Bruce soaks that in.

                                        BRUCE
                        What if it's meant to be, Johnny?
                        Even you, in the future, believe
                        this needs to happen.  Are you
                        sure we're doing the right thing?
                        I can't believe I'm saying this,
                        but... it's one life Johnny... to
                        save how many?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I hope I never have to make that
                        choice.

          Johnny pulls out his cell phone, starts to dial.

                                        BRUCE
                        Who are you calling?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Rebecca.  See if I can stop this
                        before it begins.


  1111ECU - A FLATSCREEN SECURITY MONITOR

          An X-RAY image of a woman's PURSE glides into frame and
          stops dead center.  We see the outlines of a set of keys,
          a metal lipstick tube and a cell phone.  The phone begins
          to RING.



          A conveyor carries the purse out of an airport-style
          scanner.  REBECCA picks it up and takes out her phone. 
          She sees it's Johnny... and sends the call to voicemail. 


            FOOTAGE)(FORMERLY SCENE 101)

          Rebecca and Greg Stillson face each other across Stillson's
          desk.

                                        STILLSON
                        You know it's heartbreaking what
                          happened to Rachel.  I'm so glad
                        you decided to reconsider my offer.

          They react as James Stillson enters.  Greg would have
            preferred Dad stay out of this. 

                                        STILLSON
                          "Rachel's Law" will be a fitting
                        tribute to your sister.  And it
                        will keep her case front and center
                        over at the Justice Department.

                                        JAMES STILLSON
                        What made you change your mind... 
                        if you don't mind my asking?

                                        REBECCA
                        I lost faith in Johnny Smith.
                        One lie too many I suppose.  All
                        I want now is for her attacker to
                        be brought to justice.

                                        STILLSON
                        Even if it's Johnny Smith?

                                        REBECCA
                        Especially if it's him.  He used
                        her death to get close to me.

                                        STILLSON
                        It's hard to see something like
                        that when you're grieving.  You're
                        doing the right thing.  Having
                        you associated with the bill helps
                        people see that it's not an
                          abstraction, that crime affects
                        all of us.  There's a dinner
                          tomorrow night, I've been asked
                        to speak about the bill.
                        You want to be there when I
                          announce that it's called "Rachel's
                        Law?"

          Dad flashes Greg a look of disapproval.

                                        REBECCA
                        Yes, I'd like that.

                                        STILLSON
                        Great.  My assistant will make
                        all the arrangements.  I'll see
                        you tomorrow.

          Rebecca exits.  After the door closes, James crosses to
            Stillson.

                                        JAMES STILLSON
                        Don't make the same mistake you
                        made with her sister.

                                        STILLSON
                        And what mistake was that?  I'm
                        not a monk.  Besides, being
                        associated with her helps with my
                        female base.  Highlights my
                          "compassionate" side.

                        Listen to me, Greg:  you keep her
                        around, and people are never going
                        to forget about Rachel Caldwell.
                        This whole thing could blow up in
                        your face.

            Pendragon paces Walt as he makes his way to his office.

                        I need copies of the investigating
                          detective's notes, contact list,
                          evidence reports, witness

                          photographs.

                                        WALT
                        I can't give you that while our
                          investigation is on-going.

                                        PENDRAGON
                        The prime suspect is your close
                        friend.  I'm letting you choose
                        to give me the information rather
                        than face a federal subpoena.

          Walt's angry but bites his tongue.

          As Pendragon leaves, Roscoe enters with two big bundles
          of mail.  He dumps them on Walt's desk.

                        you, not him.  And now there's
                        people outside carrying signs.

            (FORMERLY SCENE 103)

          Walt enters carrying an armload of mail and unlocks the
          door to Purdy's cell.  The Reverend is sitting on a narrow
          bunk, reading a book and looking altogether peaceful.

                                        WALT
                        Hey, Reverend.  How you doing?

                          Excellently well.  I feel as good
                        as I have ever felt.  I've gained
                        a profound relief from making a
                        clean breast of things.  I had my

          Walt lays the bundle of letters on the bunk.  Purdy looks
          at it in surprise.

                        Yeah.  There's ten more bags just
                        like it outside.

          Walt eyes him, measuring.

                                        WALT
                        So whenever you're ready to tell
                        me why Sonny Elliman killed Mike
                          Kennedy, I'm ready to listen.

          Sarah enters with a gym bag full of clothes for Walt, who's
          already dressed in civvies.  He takes the bag from Sarah.

                                        WALT
                        Thanks.

          He hands her his badge.

                        Take me with you.  Nobody knows

                                        WALT
                        That's true, but it's too

                        He used a gas card in Baltimore. 
                        I think he's headed for Washington

          Walt finishes getting ready, moves toward the door.

                        happen to either one of you.

          With that he's gone.  Off Sarah's worried look.

          He touches the doorknob, then the lock -- one of those
          KEYLESS PUSHBUTTON affairs.  We hear a little WHOOSH,
          then he quickly punches in the correct combination.

                                        BRUCE
                        Remind me not to get one of those.

          Johnny gives him a tight smile as he opens the door.



          Johnny and Bruce take a few steps into the foyer.

          Pendragon, hurrying through Washington, talks to Stillson
          on the phone.

                                        PENDRAGON
                        Don't worry Congressman, if he's
                        on the move, he won't evade
                          detection for very long.

                        I'm telling you I know this guy. 
                        Smith is headed here, to D.C. --
                        he's obsessed.

                                        PENDRAGON
                        I'm already here in D.C. -- the
                        fact that he crossed state lines
                        will let us put him away

                        It's not so much me I'm worried
                        about, it's my staff.  He's already
                        killed one of them.

                                        PENDRAGON
                        If he comes anywhere near you or

                        way toward making my staffers
                        feel safer.

          Stillson hangs up.  Smiles at his Dad who's been listening
          the whole time.

          Johnny touching various objects.   

                                        BRUCE
                        What are you seeing?

          Johnny shakes his head... then reacts to the sound of a
          TOILET FLUSHING just up the hall.  SONNY ELLIMAN now
          crosses from a bathroom into a kitchen across the hall.

          Johnny moves closer, looks into the KITCHEN... where
            Elliman's unscrewing the mouthpiece of a wall-mounted
          phone as James Stillson watches impatiently.

                                        JAMES
                        We need to do this one, too?

                        They know I'm here.  The place is
                        bugged.

                        Come on.  We gotta get out of
                        here.

          Johnny walks to the end of the hall, which opens into a
          small office and dressing room.  

                                        JOHNNY
                        Not yet... not until we...

          Johnny's drawn to a small framed PHOTO on a dressing table:
            a picture of himself and Rebecca.  He picks it up...
            WHOOSH... then sees --


          REBECCA

          Sitting beside him at the dressing table, as she finishes
          loading her revolver, then puts it in her purse and shuts
          the dresser drawer.  Johnny instinctively reaches out to
          her, but as he does, the vision fades.

          He opens the same drawer and finds a PRESS RELEASE for
          the news conference.  It's scheduled for a downtown
          Courthouse at 3 pm.  As he eyes it...



          As Johnny and Bruce exit, closing the door, Johnny shows
          Bruce the press release.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's where she's going to do
                        it.  At this press conference
                        this afternoon.

                                        BRUCE
                        Three o'clock.  At least we've
                        got time.

          Johnny nods, not that that's much comfort.  Bruce hits
          the elevator button.  There's a window next to the
            elevator.  Suddenly...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Federal agents... on their way
                        up.

                        You have another vision?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah, but not the psychic kind.

          He nods out the window as Bruce looks --



          Bruce acts fast.

                                        BRUCE
                        Stairs!



          Greg is frantically tearing open dresser drawers and
          closets as James Stillson, now 36, reclines on the bed,
          hands behind his head, cowboy boots bobbing to the beat
          of a COUNTRY SONG playing on Greg's boombox, a SILVER HIP
          FLASK on a night table beside him.

                        Samsonites with wheels.  We might

                        it easier to lug around all this
                        crap.

          He tosses the flustered Greg a white Bible.

                                        21-YR-OLD GREG
                        She wouldn't walk out on me.

          James wiggles his boots --

          James swings his legs over the bed, stands.

                        All you need is money and the

                        You bastard!

          Greg runs at him, shoving him against the wall.  James
          spins Greg around, jamming him against the wall, his
          forearm crushing the boy's windpipe.  Greg rasps --

                                        30-ISH JAMES
                        Listen to me, boy.  You might not
                        be the brightest bulb in the box,
                        but you were meant for somethin'
                        better than this.  I feel it, and
                        I'm bettin' you feel it, too.

          Despite Greg's anger, his father's words resonate.  He
          sags against the wall, weeping.

                                        21-YR-OLD GREG
                        I loved her.

          He smooths Greg's tie, plucks a loose thread.

                                        30-ISH JAMES
                        She was a loose end, son.  We
                        can't have any loose ends.



          Parked across the street, Walt watches the men get in
          their respective cars.  A beat as he considers which car
          to follow... then his P.O.V. zooms in on Sonny Elliman,
          and he decides to follow an investigative hunch.  As he
          pulls out after the sedan...

                                                                            WHIP-PAN TO:

          runs out to where the angry Cabby still stands.  He barks
          into his lapel mic.

            A government sedan screeches up and Pendragon jumps in.



          Rebecca sits in the back, clutching her purse.  The car
          stops and Stillson opens the door, beaming.



          As he stares at Rebecca, holding her distant look as he
            maintains this charged electronic connection.

                        Visual contact with Smith. 
                          Directly East of the steps, next
                        to the news truck.
                                (to Stillson)
                          Congressman, we have to get you
                        inside, now.

          Agents hustle Stillson away.  Off Rebecca, still
          conflicted, realizing she's missed her chance...



          He's parked outside Rebecca's apartment building, watching
          as Sonny Elliman, carrying a briefcase, goes inside.



          Purdy sits on the edge of his bunk, eyes closed, hunched
          forward in an attitude of prayer.

                                        PURDY
                        "If we confess our sins, He is
                          faithful and just to forgive our
                        sins, and to cleanse us from all
                            unrighteousness.  If we say that
                        we have not sinned..."

                        "...we make Him a liar, and His
                        Word is not in us."

          Purdy looks up in surprise to see a middle-aged man (JANUS)
          in a slightly rumpled suit on the other side of the bars. 
          Though his appearance is nondescript, he has an easy
          confidence that comes from having one's hands on the levers
          of power.

                        either.

                        I can feel it from here.  And yet
                        how do I find you?  Huddled like
                        some friendless penitent, mumbling
                          scripture in the dark.

                        I betrayed my flock.  I've given
                        false witness in the death of a
                        close friend and now I must be
                          punished.

                        Why?  Because you stepped off the

                        That's God's job.  And His judgment
                        is forgiveness.

          He puts his hands through the bars, palms up... and Purdy
          grasps them.  From Purdy's POV, we see his attention
          briefly drawn to a distinctive RING that Janus is wearing.

                        Will you answer that call?

          And as Gene looks up at his mysterious visitor, basking
          in this affirmation of his own special destiny...

          Stillson and Rebecca enter the bustling reception, passing
          a roped-off press contingent (some of the same cast 
            reporters Johnny saw in his earlier vision) who shout
            questions at Stillson.

                          Congressman, was there a security

          and pedestrians form a FROZEN TABLEAU, from out of which
          steps a LONE FIGURE, hands shoved into the pockets of his

          FADE IN:


          Johnny watches Future Johnny approach his open window.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't have time for this.

                                        FUTURE JOHNNY
                        You want the answers to those big
                        questions, don't you?

          Future Johnny props a hand on the door frame as he peers
          in at Walt, still looking purposefully ahead.

                                        FUTURE JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                        Walt...  Good old Walt to the

                                        JOHNNY
                        I won't do what you're asking.

                                        FUTURE JOHNNY
                        That's the beauty of it.  You
                        don't have to do anything.  Just
                        let fate take its course.

                                        JOHNNY
                        This isn't about fate.  It's about
                        you manipulating me, using me to
                        turn Rebecca into a killer.

          In response, Future Johnny takes the silver cane top from
          his pocket and holds it out to Johnny like a challenge.

                                        FUTURE JOHNNY
                        Sounds like you've got all the
                        answers already.

          Johnny stares into his counterpart's milky eyes.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (off his silence)
                        You promised me the truth.

          But Future Johnny just shakes his head sadly.

                                        FUTURE JOHNNY
                        The truth.  I wouldn't know where
                        to start.

                        How about at the end?  Armageddon.
                        When does it happen?  How? 

                                        FUTURE JOHNNY
                        There's still time... if Rebecca
                        kills Stillson.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Why her?

                                        FUTURE JOHNNY
                        Because she's willing to make the
                        choice you couldn't.  

          And with that, a BRIGHT FLASH takes us back to -- 



          Johnny comes out of the vision with a start.

                                        JOHNNY
                        How much further?

                                        WALT
                        Almost there.



          Stillson sits on a couch with Rebecca, watching as she
          sips from a glass of scotch.  She glances at her purse on
          a counter.  She's still trying to work up her nerve.

                                        STILLSON
                        Feel better?
                                (when she nods)
                        That's a Glenfiddich single malt. 
                        I don't break it out for just
                        anyone.  But you're special...
                        like your sister.

          He leans forward... touches her cheek.

                                        STILLSON
                        Did Rachel tell you we were...
                        close?  You're even more beautiful
                        than she was.

          He starts to kiss her.  He's not just being smarmy; he
          feels a genuine attraction to her, and believes it's being
            reciprocated.  But Rebecca's a little flustered.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: TIPPING POINT 2 - ACT FOUR - 2/21/05 - YELLOW  41.

                        Wait... I need to use the...

          Stillson gets the idea, nods to the bathroom...  Rebecca
          gets up, camera moving with her as she grabs her purse
          off the counter --

                                        STILLSON
                        Don't take too long.

          She looks back at him then exits into the bathroom, closing
          the door behind her.



          She shuts the door, then opens her purse, takes out the
            revolver, checks the load again, then eyes herself in the
          mirror.  This is it.  She collects herself, then puts the
          gun back in the purse, leaving it unzipped.



          The post-rally reception has broken up, workers cleaning
          up the refuse.  Near the reception desk, not far from an
            elevator, James Stillson chews out a BODYGUARD.

                                        JAMES
                        I don't care what the Congressman
                        said, I want you outside his door.

          They're both distracted by a ruckus outside the hotel's
          front door.  We see WALT arguing with the DOORMAN,
            demanding to see Congressman Stillson.

                                        JAMES
                        Bannerman.  Get rid of him, then
                        get back upstairs.

          James watches him go, meanwhile taking out a silver HIP
          FLASK and unscrewing the top.


          NEW ANGLE

          from behind as Johnny uses the distraction Walt has created
          to sneak toward --



          The doors close.  Johnny doesn't know what floor Stillson's
          on, so he lightly touches a couple of buttons, getting
          WHOOSHES for visions we don't see.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: TIPPING POINT 2 - ACT FOUR - 2/23/05 - GREEN  42.


    78CONTINUED:78

          Then Johnny's fingers are drawn to the button for Floor
          12.  He lightly touches it...

          Bingo.  The doors open, and Stillson guides Rebecca out,
          nodding to a door across the hall.  Room 714.

                                        STILLSON
                        Ladies first.

          He turns to a BODYGUARD who starts to follow them out.

                                        STILLSON
                        Don't think I'll be needing your
                        help, if you get my drift.

          The Bodyguard nods, backs into the elevator as the doors
          close, ending the vision.

          Johnny's alone again.  He's about to push the button when
          suddenly the doors open again, revealing James Stillson
          in the lobby.  This time, it isn't a vision.

                                        JAMES
                        Smith!

          He reaches inside and grabs Johnny by the arm, triggering --



          Shocked even as he shoves James backwards out of the
            elevator.  A beat as the two men face each other.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It was you.  You killed Rachel.

          Surprise keeps James rooted in place as the elevator door
          closes between them.  He pounds the button but it's gone.



          Johnny absorbs the vision, trying to understand how he
          could have been so wrong.  As the elevator lights climb
          toward 12 --



          On the couch, Rebecca leans down to kiss Stillson...
          pushing him down on his back.  But as he looks into her
          eyes, he sees no warmth there.  Something about this is
          wrong, and his natural suspicion kicks in.

                                        STILLSON
                        This is nice.  Real nice.  But I
                        gotta wonder.  Why are you here?

                                        REBECCA
                        What do you mean?

          As meanwhile camera follows her hand as it drifts down
          toward her purse on the floor.

          Stillson doesn't notice, but he grips her other wrist,
          his voice cool, deliberate.

                                        STILLSON
                        I mean, why are you really here?

          In that moment, Rebecca's eyes flare, showing her true
            feelings.  Her anger.  Her hatred.  And now we see her
          fingers close around the grip of her gun...

          Suddenly Johnny CRASHES through the door.

                                        REBECCA
                        Johnny!

          Stillson bolts up --

                                        STILLSON
                        What the hell?



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: TIPPING POINT 2 - ACT FOUR - 2/25/05 - WHT-2  43A.

          But Johnny just grabs Rebecca by the wrist, taking her
          purse away as she protests.

                        Of course I didn't.

            Rebecca's stunned, as is Stillson.

                        when I touched him.

          Only here, in this moment, is Johnny certain of Stillson's
          ignorance.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You really didn't know, did you?

                                        STILLSON
                        Get out, before I have you both
                          arrested.

          Rebecca, stunned, is finally led out by Johnny.



          As Johnny pulls Rebecca inside, pulls out a red emergency
          stop button, then hits "Lobby."  Through the closing doors
          we glimpse James Stillson and the Bodyguard heading down
          the hall from another elevator.  Then the doors close and
          Johnny sags slightly against the wall.

                                        REBECCA
                        John.  I'm sorry... I just...

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's okay.  They can't hurt you
                          anymore.

          He pulls her close as she begins to cry, her desire for
          revenge finally giving way to simple grief.

          Johnny's own eyes close; this ordeal finally over.  Or at
          least it is for him...



          Greg pours himself a steadying drink as his father
            enters...

          Beat.

                        Daddy.  What really happened
                        between you and Rachel Caldwell?

          Greg just eyes him coldly as he sips his drink.  Finally,
          his father relents with an "aww, what the heck" shrug.

                                        JAMES
                        That bitch was trouble.  She should
                        have never had access to the
                          campaign.

                        Did you kill her?

          James considers the question, then...

                                        STILLSON
                        You did it.

                                        JAMES
                        Let it go.

                                        STILLSON
                        You killed her.

                        TO PROTECT YOU!

          The admission of guilt catches both of them off guard.

                                        JAMES (CONT'D)
                        She knew about the voting machines. 
                        She had us on film.  I cleaned up
                        the mess, just like I've always
                        done.  Like I did when you were
                        nothing but a snot nose kid.

          Greg looks at him, then starts to laugh...

                          pathetic old man.

          James SLAPS Greg hard across the face.  And as he does --


    8585FLASHBACK OF YOUNG GREG BEING SLAPPED BY HIS FATHER
          OUTSIDE THE CHURCH - 1978



          As he stands there stunned, then rubs his face.

                                        JAMES
                        Don't you talk to me like that.

                                        STILLSON
                        I was never good enough, was I? 
                        No matter how many Bibles I sold. 
                        You had to control everything. 
                        If I cared about something, it
                        had to be bad.  If I loved a girl,
                        she had to be a whore.

                                        JAMES
                        You always were your mother's
                        son.

          The comment catches Greg by surprise.  Then SLAP!  This
          time it's James who's stunned by a blow.

                                        STILLSON
                        Don't talk about her.

          James shakes off the blow realizing he's just hit a very
          deep emotional nerve.

                                        JAMES
                        I ever tell ya 'bout how we met? 
                        She was drunk...

          Another powerful SLAP backs James a step.

                                        STILLSON
                        I'm warnin' you.

                                        JAMES
                        She was sellin' herself to anybody
                        with a five dollar bill...

          Greg starts to slap him a third time, but James catches
          him by the wrist.  They hold each other's hard stare...

                                        JAMES (CONT'D)
                          I wasn't sure if I was even your
                        daddy until the blood test came
                        back.  Then I was stuck with ya.

          Greg considers his father's words, then in a fit of rage
          he lunges forward, pressing his forearm against his
          father's throat and pinning him against the wall.

                                        STILLSON
                        Shut up!  Shut your dirty mouth!

          Greg puts his weight behind his forearm as his father
            chokes...

                                        STILLSON (CONT'D)
                        All these years I've let you treat
                        me like an animal!  Like a goddamn
                        pet!

          Greg's face is inches from his father's, his internal
          rage fueling this brutal attack.

                                        JAMES
                        Greg... son...

                                        STILLSON
                        Don't call me that!  Don't ever
                        call me that again!

          After a few BEATS, James' face is red and he is no longer
          struggling, his eyes open, but any sign of life has been
          choked out of him.  A change comes over Greg's expression
          as he realizes what he's done and eases up on his grip.

                                        STILLSON (CONT'D)
                        Dad?

          James' lifeless body slides down the wall, Greg holding
          onto his shirt as it drops in a contorted heap on the
          floor.

                                        STILLSON (CONT'D)

                        Sweet Jesus.  What have I done?

          He steps back and slumps down on the edge of the bed.

                                        STILLSON (CONT'D)
                        What have I done?          DEAD ZONE: TIPPING POINT 2 - ACT FOUR - 2/21/05 - YELLOW  48.



          POV on elevator floor numbers lighting up in succession
          as they climb again toward 12.  Then the doors open, and
          our POV approaches the door to Greg's suite, which the
            Bodyguard opens for us.



          Several men are inside, including Stillson's top advisor,
          Jake Truax, who now turns and greets us at the door with
            a worried look.  Behind him, Greg sits on the bed exactly
          where we left him.

                                        TRUAX
                        He won't talk to anyone... won't
                        let us move the body.

          The other men step aside as Truax leads us to where
          Stillson sits on the bed.  Truax leans down to mutter in
          his ear...

                                        TRUAX (CONT'D)
                        Greg, this is the man I told you
                        about.

          Truax leaves us, and we step closer to Stillson...


          NEW ANGLE - CU ON GREG STILLSON

          his face tear-streaked, as a man's HAND enters frame -- a
          hand bearing a now FAMILIAR RING -- and grips his shoulder.

          And as Greg looks up, we reveal Purdy's mysterious visitor,
          who nods encouragingly.  Greg stands, his wracked eyes
            searching for a reason for hope and absolution.

          Greg, still dazed, looks at Janus, then around the room
          as he tries to reconstruct this mythical accident.

                                        STILLSON
                          I killed him...

                          I didn't mean...

          To everyone's surprise, Janus slaps him.  It catches
          Stillson by surprise, but it seems to help shake some of
          the cobwebs.  Janus is cold and calculated.

                        Say it.

          Greg hesitates, taking a moment to gaze at the faces of
          the men standing around him.  Except for Truax, he doesn't
            recognize anyone.  He realizes that this is truly a turning
          point in his life.  His chance to do the right thing and
          suffer the consequences, or the wrong thing and continue
          this dark journey towards an unspeakable, unimaginable
            conclusion... a BEAT, then...

          Janus reaches out and gently fixes Greg's rumpled shirt.

                          Nothing.

          Janus straightens Greg's collar in a creepily familiar
          fatherly gesture...

          Truax nods, as several men prepare to move the dead body
          of James Stillson.  Greg watches, his eyes growing cold
          and detached as Janus leans in and begins speaking to
