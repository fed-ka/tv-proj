      The FULL MOON looms omnipresent over the eerily quiet woods 
      of Beacon Hills. Far closer to the ground, another GLOWING 
      OBJECT flutters into view.

      A FIREFLY. 

      The tiny luminescent beetle is joined by a second and third, 
      soaring up and through the woods. All three, the unwitting 
      prey of two children, BILLY and BREANNE, chasing after them 
      with glass jars.

                                  BILLY
                    Got one!

      Screwing the lid on top of the jar, Billy turns to show his 
      sister.

                                    BREANNE
                    What are you doing, dumbass? You re 
                    supposed to put holes in the lid. 
                    Otherwise you kill them.

                                  BILLY
                    Do I have to let him go?

                                    BREANNE
                    Do you want him to die?

      Billy holds up the jar, peering in at the firefly to decide 
      its fate. Breanne, however, steps past him as she notices a 
      remarkable sight just ahead...

      HUNDREDS OF FIREFLIES, tiny lights blinking off and on in the 
      darkness. Uncapping her own jar, Breanne races forward. The 
      fireflies scatter, soaring up to the safety of higher 
      altitudes.

      Billy cautiously follows one into the thick of the woods. 

      The glowing beetle settles on a low branch, joining another 
      PAIR just near it. Billy creeps forward, holding out the jar 
      and its lid to catch the first when--        TEEN WOLF "FIREFLIES"EP#303BLUE1/15/132.

      It flutters away, leaving the other two behind. Coming 
      closer, Billy notices the other two are actually not 
      fireflies.

      They re the GLOWING EYES of a WEREWOLF. 

      Fangs bared, dirt-smeared and as feral and frightening as a 
      wild animal, Boyd rises from the shadows. 

      SEVERAL YARDS AWAY - With a jar full of captured fireflies, 
      Breanne spins at the sound of her brother s SCREAM.

                                    BREANNE (CONT D)
                    Billy?

      Alarmed, she runs toward his voice. But she doesn t need to 
      go far. Billy hurtles out of the darkness right for her.

                                  BILLY
                    Run--run!

      Terrified, he drags her with him, causing her to drop the 
      jar. She manages a glance back at SOMETHING CRASHING THROUGH 
      THE BRANCHES toward them.

      Panicked, they run for the only shelter they can find. A lone 
      STEEL TOOL SHED. They charge inside and--


      Breanne slides the flimsy metal door shut, fumbling with the 
      tiny lock while, behind her, Billy grabs at her shirt.

                                  BILLY
                    He s gonna  get in--he s gonna  get 
                    inside--

                                    BREANNE
                    Shut up--shut up.

      Breathless, she pulls him back and away from the door. They 
      hear FOOTSTEPS. Low, animal breaths.

      Breanne holds her hand over her brother s mouth, trying to 
      keep him quiet while listening to Boyd circle the shed.

      Their heads turn at CLAWS ticking against the metal walls. 
      They follow the sounds down to where MOONLIGHT spills in 
      through the rusted and bent space between the shed s side and 
      floor. 

      CLAWS slip in through the space, feeling about for a hold.        TEEN WOLF "FIREFLIES"EP#303BLUE1/15/133.

      Backing further away, Breanne and Billy watch helplessly as 
      the claws grasp around the wall and begin to pull at it.

      METAL TEARS as Boyd wrenches the wall up, separating the 
      entire exterior of the shed from its floor. With a furious 
      GROWL, he hurls the collapsing steel frame into the air, 
      exposing the two SCREAMING children.

      But just as Boyd takes a step forward to attack, SOMETHING 
      ROLLS RIGHT IN FRONT HIS FEET.

      Breanne s JAR. 

      Lid removed, the FIREFLIES soar out of the opening, bursting 
      up in a cloud around Boyd s head. Enraged, he waves his claws 
      at the flickering lights.

      When the fireflies finally scatter, Boyd focuses his yellow 
      eyes forward to see the two children--are gone.


      Carrying a shocked Breanne and Billy under each arm, Scott 
      gives a momentary but satisfied glance back to the darkness 
      behind them as he races through the woods. Fast as he can.


      Down a thin, twisting path, Derek kneels by a SHOE PRINT in 
      the dirt while talking to Scott on his cell.

                                  DEREK
                    You lost him?

                    I know. Which is why I think we 
                    should stick together.


      Phone to his ear, Scott glances nervously about the woods. 

                                  SCOTT
                    Trust me, he s too strong, too fast

                    Yeah. Just need to drop something 
                    off first...

      Hanging up, Scott looks down at Billy and Breanne, clutching 
      fearfully to his legs.

      But Derek stops short, dropping down to a kneeling position. 
      With an acrobatic flip, Scott lands right at his side to find 
      him examining TRACKS in the dirt.

                    Is that going to make it easier or

      The door to Lydia s car clicks open. She steps out with her 
      eyes on her phone as she thumbs a text message, walking 
      briskly across the empty parking lot.

      But she stops short. 

      Slowly peering up, she finds she s not at the store, but at 
      the BEACON HILLS PUBLIC POOL. Glancing about in confusion, 
      her breath tightens noticeably.

      And then she spots an OBJECT in the darkened pool. Something 
      floating there.

      Inching forward, Lydia tries to make out what it is. With 
      each step, it becomes clearer... A BODY floating in the 
      water.

                                  LYDIA
                          (a whisper)
                    Oh God...

      She starts toward it, but then indecision halts her. She 
      looks back to her car. Then to the body in the pool.         TEEN WOLF "FIREFLIES"EP#303BLUE1/15/136.

      Finally, she approaches the pool, moving down the side by the 
      LIFEGUARD CHAIR where she kneels at the edge.

                    Oh my God, are you dead? Please 
                    don t be dead.

      She reaches for the body, managing to grab hold of the leg, 
      pulling it toward the moonlight to reveal--

      It s a CPR MANNEQUIN.

                                  LYDIA (CONT D)
                    Are you kidding me?

      With an irritated breath, she sits up, wiping her wet hands 
      against each other.

                    Lydia, what the hell are you 
                    doing...

      She pauses, peering down at her wet hands. Wet with blood. 
      Gazing at a widening puddle of dark blood around her feet, 
      she follows the trail, slowly turning her head to look up.

      Perched in the LIFEGUARD CHAIR is the body of an eighteen 
      year-old BOY, wet blood still flowing down his clothes from a 
      horribly SLASHED THROAT.

                                        ACT TWO

      FADE IN:


      AN ELECTRIC CANDLE clicks on inside a tent. One-by-one, over 
      a dozen light up, an amber glow flickering around a young 
      woman named CAITLIN. She looks out the open tent flap.

                                    CAITLIN
                    You coming?

                                  EMILY (O.S.)
                    There s a snake out here the size 
                    of a train.

                                    CAITLIN
                    Kick it.

                                  EMILY (O.S.)
                    If I kick it, I swear it could 
                    swallow my foot and drag me back to 
                    Mordor.

                                    CAITLIN
                    Just step over it.

      Caitlin hears a shuffle of feet and then EMILY bursts through 
      the flap of the tent, scrambling inside. They both laugh as 
      she falls back into Caitlin s arms. Then Emily notices the 
      candles.

                                  EMILY
                    Nice touch.

      Caitlin threads her fingers through Emily s. Then slowly  
      lowers her lips to Emily s for a gentle kiss.

                                    CAITLIN
                    You re nervous.

                                  EMILY
                    You make me nervous.

                                    CAITLIN
                    Is that good or bad?

                                  EMILY
                    All good.

      She brushes Caitlin s hair from her cheek, a thumb against 
      her soft skin. Caitlin leans forward to kiss her again, but 
      Emily sits up.        TEEN WOLF "FIREFLIES"EP#303BLUE1/15/139.

                                  EMILY (CONT D)
                    Okay, that s a mood killer.

      She nods to the silhouette of a large BEETLE crawling up the 
      outside of the tent, a Pine Sawyer at almost two inches long.

      Caitlin thumps her hand against the beetle. The silhouette 
      disappears. But another beetle begins crawling up. Caitlin 
      thumps that one as well.

                                    CAITLIN
                    Okay?

                                  EMILY
                    Better.

      They kiss. More intense this time, bodies pressing closer. 
      Emily s nervousness subsides as she lets Caitlin kiss her 
      chin, her neck and--

      SHE SCREAMS.

      Caitlin lurches back in shock. Then glances up to see what 
      Emily s looking at. HUNDREDS of BEETLES crawling over the 
      tent, dark silhouettes pressing down on it.

      One BEETLE pushes in through a hole in the tent. Others pour 
      in after it, a dozen of them inside the tent.

                                  EMILY (CONT D)
                    Oh my God--I can t--I can t stay in 
                    here.

                                    CAITLIN
                      Wait--Emily, wait--

      Already yanking the zipper up on the tent flap, she crawls 
      out and--


      BEETLES tumble off the side of the tent into Emily s hair. 
      She slaps at them with her hands, spinning furiously in the 
      dark. 

      Staggering further from the tent she trips over a root, 
      tumbling into the dirt and leaves with a painful thud.

      She blinks, looking about in a daze, unable to see the tent 
      anywhere. But as her eyes focus, she sees something utterly 
      incredible...      TEEN WOLF "FIREFLIES"EP#303BLUE1/15/1310.

      CONTINUED:1313

      THOUSANDS OF BEETLES scurrying out of the shadows. Coming 
      right for her.

      Emily scrambles back in terror. But THE BEETLES cover her, 
      enveloping her body, literally drowning her in a sea of 
      shiny, black exoskeletons.

      Finally, their numbers dissipate and like a receding wave, 
      they vanish into the woods ahead. Except, strangely... Emily 
      is also gone.

      A voice calls out from the dark.

                                    CAITLIN
                    Emily?

      Stepping between the trees, Caitlin glances about, voice 
      becoming more tremulous as her calls turn to shouts.

                                    CAITLIN (CONT D)
                    Em, where are you? Emily? Emily!

      The CRACK of a BRANCH stops her cold. Head cocked to listen, 
      Caitlin doesn t notice the TWO YELLOW EYES blinking open 
      behind her.

                    Em?

      Behind her, the transformed Cora steps into the light. A 
        fearsome-looking werewolf, BLOOD SPATTERED across her cheek, 
      she slowly approaches her prey.

      As if sensing something behind her, Caitlin begins to turn 
      when--

      ISAAC YANKS Cora to the ground, knocking her clear off her 
      feet. As Caitlin staggers back in shock, Cora leaps up with 
      an enraged GROWL.

      Crouched in an attack pose, Isaac peers up with a smile. He 
      loves a fight. 

      Cora comes at him, claws SLASHING. Digging into his jacket, 
      she pulls Isaac around and--with a stunning display of 
        strength--hurls him across the clearing, SMASHING HIM RIGHT 
      into the trunk of tree.

      Splinters and debris falling about him, Isaac crumbles 
      forward as Cora charges.

      But Scott leaps out of the darkness, hurtling right over 
      Isaac. He takes Cora down, sending her CRASHING back.      TEEN WOLF "FIREFLIES"EP#303BLUE1/15/1311.

      Even as Scott lands on his feet, however, Cora scrambles up 
      to her own. Except now she rises to face Derek. He bares his 
      FANGS, ROARING a challenge at her. 

      Out of the corner of her eye, Cora sees Scott and Isaac 
      circling. She retreats back and decides to run, gunning for 
      the darkness ahead. 

      Derek launches after her with Isaac following quickly behind. 
      Scott turns back to Caitlin who has witnessed everything with 
      ever widening-eyes.

                    Are you okay?

                          (barely able to speak)
                      Wh--what--

                    Are you all right?

      She gives a bewildered nod.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    You have to get out here, okay? Get 
                    out of the woods. Get out as fast 
                    as you can.

      Backing away from her, he sprints off in pursuit of the 
      others. Breathless, Caitlin stands in silence, alone in the 
      woods. Completely alone.


      Stiles s Jeep flies into the lot, pulling in next to Lydia s 
      car. He SLAMS on the brakes and jumps out.

                    Lydia? Lydia!

      Past the fence, he finds her hugging herself in the cold.

                    Not okay.

      Stiles spots the dark figure perched in the lifeguard chair 
      and reaches for his phone.

                    You called the police before you

                                  STILES
                    YES.

      Stiles lifts his phone to find it s already vibrating with an 
      incoming call from SCOTT.


      In a small clearing, Derek and Isaac watch Scott talk with 
      Stiles on the phone.

                                  SCOTT
                    Are you sure?

                    Throat, ripped out. Blood 
                      everywhere.


      Stiles looks over the young man s body in the lifeguard 
      chair.

                                  STILES
                    It s like The frickin  Shining over

                    would not be surprised.

                                  SCOTT (V.O.)
                    Can you look a little closer? Make 
                    sure it was them.

                                  STILES

      Stiles steps closer to the body to discover an interesting 
      detail. A RING on the young man s finger. Leaning close, 
      Stiles reads the single word inscribed on it: PURITY.

                                  STILES
                    Huh...


      Derek and Isaac watch Scott finish the call. He turns and 
      confirms the worst with a reluctant nod.

      situation bearing down on him.

                    Maybe it would be easier to just 
                    kill them.

                                  SCOTT

      FADE IN:


      LIGHT BAR FLASHING, a Deputy Sheriff's SUV pulls into the 
      clearing amid others. Stilinski wraps a blanket around 
      Caitlin while DEPUTY TARA GRAEME questions her.

                                  DEPUTY GRAEME
                    So, Caitlin--you and Emily--were 
                    the two of you drinking?

                                    CAITLIN
                    What? No.

                                  DEPUTY GRAEME
                    Anything else?

      Now she hesitates.

      Graeme throws Stilinski a look.

                      Hallucinations can happen from MDMA

                                    CAITLIN
                    You think I hallucinated?

                                  STILINSKI
                    You saw a deformed girl with 
                    glowing eyes and fangs?

                                  STILINSKI

                    you to the hospital and figure out

                    them too.

                    Maybe bring in a Sketch Artist?

      Stilinski nods, then motions for her to step aside with him.

                                  STILINSKI
                    Let s get an APB out on Emily and 
                    this other girl when you ve got 
                    something better than fangs and 
                    claws.

                                  DEPUTY GRAEME
                    You believe her?

                                  STILINSKI
                    She saw something.

                                  DEPUTY GRAEME
                    You mean someone.

      But Stilinski s nod is oddly hesitant. Curious, Graeme 
      watches him turn into the blur of flashing police lights.


      Heading down an aisle of cars, Argent fumbles with an armful 
      of groceries while trying to get his keys of his pocket. One 
      of the bags slips from his grasp and he winces as it hits the 
      ground with a CRUNCH.

                                  ARGENT
                    Had to be the one with the eggs.

      He clicks open the hatchback on his SUV and loads the bags 
      inside. When he reaches to close it, he pauses. Slowly, his 
      right hand slips inside and--

      Argent whips the barrel of a Glock around to point at Scott.

                                  SCOTT
                    Uh... hi.


      Engine off, Derek and Isaac watch Scott talking to Argent 
      just a few yards away.      TEEN WOLF "FIREFLIES"EP#303BLUE1/15/1317.

      Derek slowly turns an incredulous gaze on Isaac.

                                  ISAAC (CONT D)
                    Sorry. Bad timing. I ll ask later.
                          (off Derek s glare)
                    Or never. I m good with never.


      Scott keeps his eyes on the Glock in Argent s hand, still 
      pointed at him.

                                  ARGENT
                    First of all, why would I care 
                    about anyone related to Derek? 
                    Second, I don t know this kid Boyd. 
                    I don t even know his last name.

                                  SCOTT
                    His last name s Boyd.

                    What s his first name?

                                  SCOTT
                    Vernon. Which is probably why he 
                    goes by Boyd. And--just curious--is 
                    there a reason you re still 
                    pointing the gun at me?

                                  ARGENT
                    Probably because some part of me 
                    still wants to shoot you.

                                  SCOTT
                    I get that.

      Argent lowers the gun and places it back into its hiding 
      space in the hatchback.

                                  ARGENT
                    Scott, I watched my father

                    I m sorry. I can t help you.

      Finally, all Scott can do is nod. But, as he turns to go, he 
      pauses. Then glances back to Argent.

                                  SCOTT
                    Would it be okay if I asked you one 
                    tiny, little favor?


      Argent s SUV pulls into the lot a short distance from a 
      collection of POLICE VEHICLES.


      In a small clearing underneath the full moon, a group of 
      unlikely werewolf hunters gathers. 

      Argent drops an EQUIPMENT BAG on the ground in front of 
      Scott, Isaac and Derek. Then kneels to examine the numerous 
      prints in the dirt.

                                  ARGENT
                    You ve been tracking them by print?

                    a severe disadvantage to Boyd and 
                    Cora who have fully given in. 
                    They ve got the pedal to the floor, 
                    while you three are barely hitting 
                    the speed limit.

                    So what do we do?

                                  ARGENT
                    Focus on your sense of smell. 
                    Actual wolves are known to track 
                    their prey for up to a hundred 
                    miles a day by scent. The trained 
                    hunter can use scent to trap 
                    them...


      Now in black and armed to the teeth, Allison appears out of 
      the shadows with a HUNTING KNIFE. She makes a small cut on 
      her forearm and lets a DROP OF BLOOD fall onto the leaf of a 
      plant.

                    If the wind is with them, wolves 
                    can track a scent by a distance of 
                    two miles.

                    Which means we can draw them to us. 
                    Or into a trap...


      From the equipment bag, Argent pulls out a NET and tosses it 
      to Scott. He gathers it in his hands, pulling at it to test 
      its strength while--


      Allison lifts a TRIP WIRE, drawing it taut to a PULLEY hidden 
      at the base of a tree.

                    The full moon does give us one 
                      advantage. They ll have a higher 
                    heat signature...


      Argent pulls out a pair of NIGHT VISION GOGGLES.

                    with infrared.

      He tosses the goggles up as--


      Allison brings her own pair to her eyes, scanning the woods. 
      Through the GREEN POV she finds TWO GLOWING BODIES moving 
      with remarkable speed. She yanks the goggles off while--


      Derek drops the pair into Isaac s hands.

      Water splashing up around them, Boyd and Cora charge through 
      a creek and then back up an embankment.

      Allison kneels by the water, using a small MAGLITE to try to 
      locate PRINTS around the embankment. But she finds nothing.

      Stepping toward the edge of the cliffside, Argent and the

                    No. But there s an important 
                      difference to recognize. Wolves 
                    hunt for food. At a certain point 
                    they get full. Boyd and Cora are 
                    hunting for the pleasure of the 
                    kill. For some primal, apex

                    from ripping a warm body to bloody

                    need is satiated.

                    We can t kill them.

      FADE IN:


      Kneeling, Argent drives a METAL DEVICE shaped like a rail 
      spike into the ground. At its tip a soft light FLASHES on and 
      off.

                                  ARGENT
                    These are Ultrasonic Emitters. It s 
                    one of the tools we use to corral 
                      werewolves, pushing them into a 
                    direction we want them to run. It 
                    gives off a high-pitched frequency 
                    only they can hear.

      He looks up to Scott, Derek and Isaac all pressing their 
      hands to their ears.

      confidence.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    It ll work.

      Argent slams the hatchback closed with a sound like a 
      STARTING GUN. A moment later, one hunter and three werewolves 
      are off and running.      TEEN WOLF "FIREFLIES"EP#303BLUE1/15/1326.



      Hurtling through the darkness, Isaac launches over a fallen 
      tree and--without a pause for a breath--sends an ULTRASONIC 
      EMITTER into the ground. 

      As the LIGHT begins FLASHING--


      Argent s SUV SCREECHES to a stop. The driver s side door 
      opens and he drops an EMITTER into the soft dirt, tip GLOWING 
      BRIGHTLY.


      Whipping an EMITTER around, Derek launches it out of his hand 
      like a throwing knife. The device lands in the side of a 
      tree, PULSING TO LIFE.


      Scott soars out from the edge of the woods surrounding the 
      school. He flips forward with the EMITTER grasped in his 
      hands. Feet hitting the ground, thumb pressed on the button, 
      he drives the EMITTER into the ground with a BURST OF LIGHT.

      He looks up, facing the high school. It looms before him, a 
      dark and empty fortress. Their last hope...


      A final Emitter drops into the ground. Placing his thumb on 
      the button to activate it, Derek pauses, spotting a figure 
      out of the corner of his eye.

      Gripping the handlebar to the school s front doors, Scott 
      takes a breath and pulls back. The LOCK breaks with a METAL 
      WRENCHING and the doors swing free.

      Isaac steps in to help prop them open. Trap set, they back

                    Does that mean something?

      Before Argent can respond, they hear a wolf s HOWL. A signal.

                                  ARGENT
                    They re coming.

      Scott backs up, both of them moving for cover.      TEEN WOLF "FIREFLIES"EP#303BLUE1/15/1332.



      Trying to hold his nervous breath, Isaac glances about the 
      shadows, tensing as the SOUNDS of RAPID MOVEMENT come closer 
      and closer.

      TWO BODIES hurtle into the lot. Boyd and Cora, racing at each 
      other s side, eyes darting about for something, anything to 
      kill.

      They re eyes set on Isaac.

                                  ISAAC
                    Oh, great...

      But Argent s SUV ROARS past him, LIGHTS BLAZING. He pushes 
      down on the HORN, pressing them back, driving them like 
      cattle toward the front of the school.


      Scott rushes past Argent to look up.

                                  SCOTT
                    They re not going through the 
                    school...


      Argent and Scott race up the steps to join Derek as he rushes 
      out from the lobby, all of them glancing about the roof for 
      Boyd and Cora.

                                  ARGENT
                    The rear doors--we need to get them 
                    open.

      With a nod, Derek disappears back into the school.

                                  SCOTT
                    Someone has to drive them inside.

      Argent pulls a STUN BATON from his jacket.

                                  ARGENT
                    I ll go.

                                  ISAAC
                    I m faster.

      Whirling around, Isaac tears off for the other side of the 
      building as--


      Feet hitting the pavement, Cora and Boyd land on the rear of 
      the high school. They start forward, intent on breaching the 
      residential area of Beacon Hills. Both of them rising up to 
      race forward when--

      AN ARROW soars past Cora s head. IT EXPLODES IN A BLINDING 
      FLASH against the side of the school.

      Cora blinks in confusion as Boyd spins trying to find their 
      attacker. 

      But another arrow hits the ground near him and BURSTS INTO 
      BLINDING RINGS OF LIGHT AND SMOKE.

      Hands shielding their eyes, Cora and Boyd fall back toward 
      the school. FLASH BOLTS burst all around them, sending them 
      right through the open doors and into the school.      TEEN WOLF "FIREFLIES"EP#303BLUE1/15/1336.

      Bow hooked over her shoulder, Allison KICKS the doors closed. 
      Moving fast, she wraps the chains back over the handlebars 
      and engages the lock.

      Breathless and trying not to let a triumphant smile spread 
      too wide on her face, she turns to see--

      Isaac. Standing nearby and having witnessed the whole thing. 
      They stare at each other for one nerve-wracked moment.

      But then Allison simply raises a finger to her lips. A silent 
      plea for him not to say anything. When Isaac nods, she turns 
      and runs for it, disappearing into the night.


      The SOUNDS of the battle even reach outside, turning Isaac 
      around, fear spreading across his face while--


      Black shoes rush across wet leaves. Deputies following 
      Stilinski as he hurries through the woods.

                                  STILES (V.O.)
                    She s one of them. Emily, Heather, 
                    the guy Lydia found at the pool. 
                    All three were virgins.

      Stilinski slows when he finally spots Emily. She seems to be 
      standing against a tree. But as he steps closer he can see 
      that she s actually bound to it, wire around her neck.

                                  STILES (V.O.)
                    And all of them are going to have 
                    the same three injuries.

      As the other deputies watch, Stilinski slowly lifts Emily s 
      bloodied head to reveal the wire garrotting her slashed 
      throat.      TEEN WOLF "FIREFLIES"EP#303BLUE1/15/1342.
