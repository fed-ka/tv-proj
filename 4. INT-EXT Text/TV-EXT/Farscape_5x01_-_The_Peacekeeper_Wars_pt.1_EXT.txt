      The centerpiece of an armada consisting of seven smaller 
      ships, the behemoth carrier is bristling with armaments.



      In orbit around Peacekeeper Outpost DD-17, a colourful 
      world with fierce weather cover. The massive ship is 
      cocooned by layers of other combat and support vessels.


      Rygel is unceremoniously PLOPPED onto the barge. A pair of 
      heavy boots beside him. Rygel belches water from his lungs, 
      purposely onto the boots. With royal disdain--

                                  RYGEL
                    Thank you ever so for your "kind"
                      assistance ...

      The wearer of the boots kneels into FRAME. It is D'ARGO.                                  D'ARGO
                    Always anxious to lend a hand, your 
                    royal loftiness ...
                            (beat)
                    Have you recovered all of the
                    pieces?

                                  RYGEL
                            (starting to retch)
                    So often I've proclaimed having a 
                    belly full of Crichton and Aeryn. 
                    Never thought it'd be so literal...

      He vomits. Up comes the huge pile of black pebbles... along 
      with stomach juices, and partially-digested flora and fauna 
      from the ocean floor, including the alien fish we saw him 
      eat earlier. Off D'Argo's look--

                                  RYGEL
                    What -- you don't get hungry... ?

                                  CAA'TA (0.S.)
                    Is that all of the pieces, Hynerian?

      D'Argo and Rygel both look at the O.S.speaker with 
      identical contempt. D'Argo rises. REVEALING:

      THREE EIDELONS stand guard over them. Each holds an Eidelon 
      rifle. The leader is named CAA'TA. The Eidelons' faces all 
      sport the telltale segmentation lines.

      D'Argo eyes Caa'ta balefully.

                                  D'ARGO
                      I appreciate your show of concern for 
                    my friends -- considering it was you 
                    who put them in this state.

                                  CAA'TA
                      Inadvertent. Our weapon only renders a
                    potential enemy in a temporary 
                      crystalline state. It was their unique 
                      physiologies that caused them to... 
                      shatter... as they did.
                            (beat)
                                  (MORE)                                  CAA'TA (CONT'D)
                    What did you call their species again?



      NORANTI scurries up, scoops a fist-full of the gooey 
      pebbles, turns to two palettes laid out on the sand. A 
      large mound of the black pebbles rests atop each palette. 
      Noranti samples the gooey pebbles in her mouth.

                                    NORANTI
                    This is Crichton -- he is called a 
                    human.
                            (tastes another pebble)
                    And Aeryn -- Sebacean. Definitely 
                    Sebacean.

      D'Argo and Caa'ta watch her actions with matching grimaces.

      Rygel is struggling to pull on his tunic.

                                  CAA'TA
                    We need all the pieces to have any 
                    chance of reconstructing your friends.

      D'Argo grabs Rygel by the tunic which still covers Rygel's 
      head. D'Argo yanks down the tunic. Rygel finds himself eye 
      to eye with the clench-jawed Luxan.

                                  D'ARGO
                    Have you gotten them all?

                                  RYGEL
                    From under every rock, every crevice. 
                    I sifted the bottom sand with my bare 
                    hands -- look at my nails!

      One of the Eidelon Guards listens on his comms. Then--

                                    EIDELON GUARD #1
                    Caa'ta! The Leviathan ship -- it is
                      returning!

                                  CAA'TA
                    I hope the others of your crew have 
                    been successful in their quest.

      No one wishes this more than D'Argo, Rygel, and Noranti.                                  CAA'TA
                          (to Guard)
                    Order the concealment canopy lowered.


      Only the expansive ocean visible from horizon to horizon. 
      Then a shimmering displacement of energy over a particular 
      section of ocean as the Eidelon concealment canopy is 
      powered down, and...

      The Eidelon city is revealed. A glistening, metropolis of 
      towering, exotic architecture.

      A TRANSPORT POD FLIES in at the TOP of FRAME as the Qujagan 
      barge races over the water towards the city.


      A newly-landed Transport Pod HISSES steam. D'Argo moves to 
      the stairs; Caa'ta beside him, rifle ready. Two EIDELON 
      GUARDS emerge from the Pod, rifles in hand. They spot 
      Caa'ta, nod to him. Then CHIANA pops out of the Pod between 
      the two Guards. A smile appears on D'Argo's lips.

                                  CHIANA
                    D'ARGO!

      She does a Chiana-leap off the ramp, landing in his arms.

      D'Argo is startled to see: her eyes are different.

                                  D'ARGO
                    Chiana... your eyes.

                                  CHIANA
                    I CAN SEE AGAIN, D'ARGO. I CAN SEE.

      Extremely pleased, D'Argo hugs her powerfully.

                                  D'ARGO
                    What happened?How did you--

                                  CHIANA
                    WHAT?                                  D'ARGO
                            (wincing)
                    WHY ARE YOU SHOUTING?

                                  CHIANA
                    I'M NOT SHOUTING. IT'S MY HEARING. 
                    WHEN MY SIGHT WAS RESTORED, MY 
                      HEARING... WELL, HE SAYS IT'S ONLY 
                      TEMPORARY.

                                  D'ARGO
                    He who?HE WHO?

                                  CHIANA
                    THE DIAGNOSAN.

                                  D'ARGO
                    YOU FOUND A DIAGNOSAN? -

                                  STARK (O.S.)
                    We found one -- yes.

      STARK emerges from the Pod. He grins proudly and indicates 
      the statuesque figure behind him. A DIAGNOSAN.

      The Diagnosan steps authoritatively from the doorway. 
      Pauses haughtily.

      Takes one more step, and -- goes ass over teakettle down 
      the ramp... landing face first in the mud at D'Argo's feet. 
      He MOANS pathetically.

                                  D'ARGO
                    What's wrong with him?

                                  CHIANA
                    WHAT?

                                  GRUNCHLK (O.S.)
                    Nothing's wrong with him. Really...

      GRUNCHLK is pushing past Stark. D'Argo's eyes narrow, 
      firstin surprise -- followed immediately by contempt.

                                  D'ARGO
                      Grunchlik. I thought you were...                                  GRUNCHLK
                    Dead? Not hardly, mate.

                                  CHIANA
                    IT'S GRUNCHLK. YOU REMEMBER GRUNCHLK,
                    DON'T YOU?

      Grunchlk is helping the very-unsteady Diagnosan to his 
      feet.

      The Diagnosan is pawing at the mud on his tunic.

                                  GRUNCHLK
                    Here ya go big fella. Upsy-daisy. 
                    Soles get that later. Here...

      Grunchlk offers a Raslak bladder to the Diagnosan.

                                  GRUNCHLK
                    Take a pull on this. Hair of the 
                    dramm...

      The Diagnosan reaches with one hand -- and misses.

                                  GRUNCHLK
                    Two hands, doc, two... there ya 
                      go...Splendid!

      The Diagnosan takes a long, long, long drink. D'Argo gives 
      Chiana a disbelieving look. She shrugs, it's the best they 
      could do.

      Stark grins, he's proud of the find.


      CLOSE ON the muzzle of some huge canon-like gun. WIDEN--

      WE are in the midst of the Scarran War Command Post. A 
      fleet of warships protect the single Scarran Decimator at 
      their centre.


      The streets are alive with foot traffic'and commerce. We 
      pick up Crichton and Chiana moving through the scene--

                                  CRICHTON
                    A five hour interrogation?

                                  CHIANA
                    Calm down. If our stories match, we 
                    get to go.      Passing a FOOD STALL, Chiana quickly sees no one is 
      watching and PINCHES SOME for her and Crichton. They eat 
      and walk 

                                  CRICHTON
                    All this overkill; they worried about 
                    the war?

                                  CHIANA
                    I think paranoid before that. But this 
                    is the big one, Crichton. Everybody's 
                    getting sucked in, chewed up, and spit 
                    out.
                            (spits out bad tasting food)

                                  CRICHTON
                    Not my problem.

      With a SHRIEK OF JOY, Chiana jumps onto his back.

                                  CHIANA
                    I knew you'd be smart! I knew you were 
                    done.

                                  CRICHTON
                    I'm done.

                                  CHIANA
                    No more hero.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Uh-uh.

                                  CHIANA
                    No more, "I've got an idea."

                                  CRICHTON
                    Fresh out.

                                  CHIANA
                    I love you.

                                  CRICHTON
                    You're on my list. Where's the woman 
                    at the top?                                  CHIANA
                    Aeryn? With the Doc. Felt something 
                    funny about the baby while they were
                      questioning her.

      Crichton stops and stares daggers.

                                  CHIANA
                            (defensive, indicating)
                    I'm taking you there...

      In zero mood, he grabs her arm and DRAGS HER up the street.


      D'Argo seated. Crichton and Aeryn stand nervously over 
      him,having just told him the news.

                                  D'ARGO
                    Rygel said he got every last piece off
                    the ocean floor.

                                  AERYN
                    Rygel?

                                  D'ARGO
                    He was very thorough. We made sure of 
                    it. He even carried the pieces up in 
                    his stomachs so he was sure not to 
                    drop any back dow--

      And the realization slowly strikes them all simultaneously.


      Crichton, Aeryn, D'Argo, Chiana, Noranti and Rygel eating. 
      An EIDELON SERVER delivers food with a jaundiced look. 
      Other Eidelons pass by with unfriendly glances. Chiana 
      reaches over and gently touches Rygel's stomach.

                                  CHIANA
                      Incredible. What's it feel like?

                                  RYGEL
                    You tell me.

      RYGEL STABS HER HAND WITH AN EATING UTENSIL. Chiana YELPS 
      and pulls away. Aeryn wrenches the utensil from Rygel.

                                  AERYN
                    Rygel, really what's it like?

                                  RYGEL
                    Like having a parasite. A large
                    parasite. That's growing.

      Her worst fears confirmed, she SWITCHES PLATES OF FOOD.

                                  RYGEL
                    I hate weeba eggs.

                                  AERYN
                      Apparently babies love them.

      Rygel sees he's not going to win; accepts with a GRUMBLE.

                                  CRICHTON
                          (re the cold stares)
                    Is it just me, or is that the only 
                    love here?

                                  D'ARGO
                    Chiana's right -- they're paranoid.                                  STARK
                            (arriving)
                    No. Wrong. Not paranoid. I've been
                    talking to many of them--

                                  RYGEL
                    Our ambassador. No wonder they're
                    avoiding us.

                                  CHIANA
                    What's their problem, then?

                                  STARK
                    Fear. Abject fear.

                                    NORANTI
                    Of what?

                                  STARK
                    Their fear extends even to
                    talking about their fear.

                                  D'ARGO
                    Perfect. I see no reason to exacerbate 
                    it by staying any longer.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Whoa, D, think it over... On the other
                    side of their concealment canopy is
                      Armageddon. We wanna fly into that,
                    right now?

      D'Argo looks around the table for other opinions. Realises 
      they're all in agreement with Crichton.

                                  D'ARGO
                            (sighs, rising)
                    They won't like it but I'll ask.

      Chiana has been playing with her new vision.

                                  CHIANA
                    Good time to ask.
                            (off everyone's look)
                    Their magnetic energy fades by midday.
                    Cool eyes.                                  STARK
                    So what we do in the meantime?

                                  CRICHTON
                            (quietly)
                    Get married.

      Everyone freezes. Aeryn looks up--

                                  AERYN
                    Pardon.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Before the baby's born.

      Aeryn sees the puppy-dog passion in Crichton's eye. Noranti 
      grabs Aeryn's face like a grandmother would--

                                    NORANTI
                    You will make a beautiful bride -- I 
                    will see to it! 


      Minimalist set up for a wedding. An ARCH, a table with 
      SMALL CAKES and GLASSES OF RASLAK. D'Argo and Stark wait at 
      the designated "altar". Rygel samples the cake. Across the 
      plaza, Crichton approaches with Muoma and Caa'ta.

                                  MUOMA
                    It is the first time I have presided 
                    over the union of soldiers.

                                  CRICHTON
                    We're not--
                          (re Caa'ta)
                    He's the only one carrying a gun.

                                  CAA'TA
                    Either way, your petition to remain 
                    among us has been denied. Upon 
                      conclusion of your ceremony, you will 
                    all leave, vowing never to reveal our 
                      existence.

                                  CRICHTON
                    If you don't mind my asking, who're 
                    you hiding from?                                  MUOMA
                            (sweetly)
                    Everyone.

      As they arrive at the altar spot--

                                  STARK
                    Aeryn's coming! The bride!

      They all look up to see Aeryn stepping into view across the 
      courtyard. Her only concession to the process is A FLOWING 
      VEIL fashioned from scavenged pieces of DIFFERENT GAUGE 
      NETTING; everything underneath regular Aeryn leathers. 
      Chiana keeps pace behind, holding the train. Noranti 
        periodically chucks ALIEN FLOWER PETALS up toward Aeryn as 
      they move. As the petals rain down on her, Aeryn swats them 
      away, annoyed and embarrassed.

                                  STARK
                              (enraptured)
                    She looks--

                                  D'ARGO
                      Different.

                                  RYGEL
                      Ridiculous.

                                  CRICHTON

                                    RICHTON
                    Bridal shop was closed.

      When Aeryn arrives beside him, Crichton takes her hand and 
      stares into her eyes.

                                  AERYN
                            (way under her breath)
                    You owe me.

      Crichton nods. But can't stop grinning.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Wish my Mom was here.

                                  AERYN
                    Glad mine isn't.                                  MUOMA
                    Is there any particular invocation you
                    would like me to use?

                                  CRICHTON
                    Uh... "Dearly Beloved"...

                                  MUOMA
                    Dearly Beloved...

                                  CRICHTON
                          (re church)
                    "We're gathered here under the shadow 
                    of this most magnificent"--

      Suddenly, THE SHADOW MOVES! THE SHADOW ELONGATES AND 
      CROSSES OVER THEM, ENGULFING THE WHOLE PLAZA AND BEYOND IN 
      DARKNESS, like an eclipse!Everything stops; all eyes go 
      skyward.

      THE UNDERSIDE OF A PEACEKEEPER COMMAND CARRIER is seen 
      moving high overhead. Still outside the planet's 
      atmosphere, it is nevertheless a terrifying presence.

                                  AERYN
                    Command Carrier.

                                  D'ARGO
                      Peacekeepers!

      Furious, Caa'ta grabs Crichton accusingly--

                                  CAA'TA
                    Lies! All lies!

      At a loss for words, Crichton shakes his head numbly.

      A SMALLER CRAFT -- A MARAUDER -- is now visible heading 
      down toward this very spot.

      Caa'ta pushes Crichton away and begins dragging Muoma 
      toward the temple. The Eidelons are all fighting panic.

                                  MUOMA
                    They seem to know exactly where we 
                    are. How, if the concealment canopy is 
                    still in place?                                  CAA'TA
                    They know because we have been 
                    betrayed.

      As he hurriedly guides Muoma toward the temple, Caa'ta 
      SHOUTS to some Eidelons nearby---

                                  CAA'TA
                    Alert the militia!

                                    NORANTI
                    Oh, preserve us -- what shall we do?

                                  CRICHTON
                    Go with them.
                          (to Stark)
                    You, too. Let 'em know it wasn't us;
                    keep 'em calm till we sort it out.

      Noranti and Stark nod, then follow the Eidelons.

                                  CHIANA
                    I know you guys don't believe me, but 
                    we are cursed.

                                  AERYN
                    Hide Rygel. Defend him with your life.

      As Chiana drags Rygel off--

                                  RYGEL
                            (covering their exit)
                    Your curse is getting worse.

      JET WASH from the descending Marauder WHIPS THE SCENE. 
      Aeryn realizes she's still wearing the veil and rips it 
      off. A moment later, she produces two PULSE PISTOLS and 
      hands one to Crichton. D'Argo draws his QUALTA BLADE and 
      (offscreen) CONVERTS IT INTO A RIFLE.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Who wants to bet me? It's gotta be.
                    C'mon, bet me. Somebody...

      THE MARAUDER'S LANDING RAMP THUMPS INTO THE PLAZA. 
      Crichton, Aeryn and D'Argo stand fast in the whipping wind 
      -- THE NOISE CRESCENDOING as the ENGINES DIE DOWN, STEAM 
      HISSING.      A long beat, and then a SINGLE PAIR OF BOOTS DESCENDS THE 
      RAMP. Scorpius.

                                  SCORPIUS.
                    Hello, Crichton.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Easy money.


      Sikozu has joined Scorpius as they approach Crichton, Aeryn 
      and D'Argo. In the background, Eidelons run scared.

                                  SCORPIUS
                    Apologies if this is a bad time, but I
                    believe we need to talk.

                                  CRICHTON
                    How did you find me?

      Scorpius reaches forward to tap Crichton' s forehead.

      Crichton bats away the gesture, and we continue to PUSH IN 
      on Crichton, and suddenly we're--


      As before; Crichton, Aeryn, D'Argo, Scorpius and Sikozu.

                                  SCORPIUS
                    It is time.

      Crichton reacts; there's that word again.

                                  CRICHTON
                    For... ?

                                  SCORPIUS
                    You.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Really? What? In your sick little 
                    plan, my theme music is playing? 
                      Heeeeeeeere's Johnny!

                                  SCORPIUS
                    You must have heard that annihilation 
                    war has broken out between the Scarran 
                    Empire and Peacekeeper Alliance.                                  CRICHTON
                    It made the papers. How much of that 
                    are you responsible for?

      Scorpius returns an even look.

                                  CRICHTON
                      Wonderful. You can go now

      Sikozu steps aggressively up to Crichton-- 

                                  SIKOZU
                    What does it take to make you realize
                    your significance in all this?

                                  CRICHTON
                    I've got no significance, Sputnick. 
                    I'm retired.

                                  SIKOZU
                    This is not a conflict that allows for
                      abstentions. You must choose sides.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Choose sides? Fine. I'll take 
                    coleslaw, beans and corn on the cob.

                                  SIKOZU
                    The Scarrans will prevail if someone
                    doesn't--

      Aeryn grabs Sikozu's arm sharply, stopping her tirade.

                                  AERYN
                    Someone else.

      Sikozu wrenches herself free. The women glare.

                                  AERYN
                    Let's you and I have our own little
                      discussion, Sikozu.

      Aeryn begins walking off. After a moment, Sikozu follows. 
      As they leave, D'Argo leans close to Crichton. -                                  D'ARGO
                    I'll make sure the locals don't come 
                    out shooting at all of us. We've kind 
                    of upset their little Utopia.

      Crichton nods as leads Scorpius out into --


                                  SCORPIUS
                    How have you been, Crichton?

      Crichton stares; starts LAUGHING at the casualness of it.

                                  CRICHTON
                    I'm fine, Bob. You? The wife? Kids?

                                  SCORPIUS
                    Busy.

                                  CRICHTON
                    I'll bet. Business is booming, huh?

                                  SCORPIUS
                    Sikozu was correct about one thing. 
                    The Scarrans will not lose. Help us 
                    build a wormhole weapon.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Golly gee, Bob, that sounds so
                      reasonable. Only two problems. No
                    matter what you believe, I cannot do 
                    it. And, just as important... I don't 
                    think the Peacekeepers are any better 
                    'n the Scarrans.
                            (turning to leave)
                    We don't validate parking. Piss off.

      SCORPIUS GRABS CRICHTON'S ARM and whips him back. This is 
      not civil. Crichton attempts to wrench free, but Scorpius 
        effortlessly holds on in a vise grip. They struggle, then-

                                  SCORPIUS
                    You will find no serenity during this
                    conflict, Crichton. Examine your
                    choices.                                  CRICHTON
                    You're not listening. Wormholes, no. 
                    Weapons, no. Killing, no. Crichton, 
                    no.

                                  SCORPIUS
                    True. A wormhole weapon may kill many. 
                    But if you do nothing, what greater 
                    number will perish if the Scarrans 
                    advance across the galaxy unchecked?

                                  CRICHTON
                    Don't lay that on me. I didn't start
                    this war.

                                  SCORPIUS
                    But you can end it.


      D'Argo is heading towards the Temple Door AS IT SWINGS 
      OPEN. Stark comes charging out followed by a gobsmacked 
      Muoma and Caa'ta. Noranti has just finished explaining 
      something to them all. STARK DANCES AROUND HIM EXCITEDLY; 
      giddy mad.

                                  STARK
                    D'Argo! D'Argo, a miracle!
                            (pointing, gesturing)
                    Eidelons! Jool! Arnessk! Peace!

      Stark's very presence is agitating. D'ARGO TONGUES HIM, 
      dropping the bouncing Stykera unconscious. Turns to 
      Noranti.

                                  D'ARGO
                    What is he talking about?

                                    NORANTI
                            (herself excited)
                    Eidelons! Jool! Arnessk! Peace!

      D'Argo holds up a palm, stopping her. Takes a deep breath. 
      Turns to Muoma.

                                  D'ARGO
                    Please?                                  MUOMA
                            (weary, defeated)
                    We are the last Eidelons -- all others
                    hunted to extinction.

                                  D'ARGO
                    Hunted... ?

                                  MUOMA
                    Our ancestors possessed the means to
                    influence peace. . A gift that has 
                    sadly, not survived to our generation.

                                  D'ARGO
                    I'm familiar with the history.

                                  CAA'TA
                    Then you will also know that twelve-
                    thousand cycles ago, their Great 
                    Temple was destroyed, the Conciliators 
                    within murdered, and all outposts of 
                    our species slaughtered by those who 
                    wished to conquer and enslave.

      He points angrily at the Peacekeeper Marauder.

                                  D'ARGO
                    They're not here to harm anyone. 
                    Believe it or not... they're looking 
                    for a way to stop the war.

                                    NORANTI
                    Eidelons! Jool! Arnessk!

                                  MUOMA
                    Arnessk was the center of our 
                    spiritual power; site of the long lost 
                    Great Temple, upon which this very 
                    edifice is modeled. However, today, 
                    Arnessk is a barren and lifeless 
                    world.

      D'Argo looks to the fervent Noranti. He gets it--

                                  D'ARGO
                    Perhaps not... We have been there.      As Muoma and Caa'ta react--

                                    NORANTI
                    That's what I've been telling them. 
                    But they're too scared to believe. 
                    Pilot can show them. Pilot has the 
                    proof!

      And off the moment...


      Crichton and Aeryn stroll past vendors. Workshopping it.

                                  CRICHTON
                    It's not our fight.

                                  AERYN
                    Agreed.

                                  CRICHTON
                    We have no obligation to take sides.

                                  AERYN
                    Agreed.

                                  CRICHTON
                    On the other hand, the ancient 
                    Eidelons know how to create peaceful 
                    gas.                                  AERYN
                    Agreed.

                                  CRICHTON
                    And even if the MTV Generation here 
                    stays clueless, the Arnesskan 
                      graybeards could save a lot of lives.

                                  AERYN
                    Agreed.

                                  CRICHTON
                    And until there's peace, everyone's 
                    gonna chase me, cause they think I can 
                    create some winner-take-all weapon.

                                  AERYN
                    Agreed.

                                  CRICHTON
                    So helping others make peace, helps 
                    me, and you.

                                  AERYN
                    Agreed.

                                  CRICHTON
                    I like this new, compliant Aeryn. How
                    long does it last?

                                  AERYN
                    Until we're married.
                            (off his look)
                    We have to leave here anyway. Even if 
                    we search for a place to sit out the 
                    war, it requires little effort to take 
                    a few of these Eidelons to Arnessk. 
                    Then, it's their problem.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Agreed ...
                          (an evil smile)
                    And you know what the best reason of 
                    all is? It'll piss the hell outta 

      ... with the PK Command Carrier in similar orbit in b. g. 
      Our TRANSPORT POD enters frame, heading toward Moya.

                                  D'ARGO
                    Almost home, Pilot. Please trace a
                    course back to the planet Arnessk. 


      Moya banks away as the familiar blue glow engulfs her and       --

      FLASH, she is gone into StarBurst.



      Now it is the Scarran Decimator which draws into FRAME.


                                  D'ARGO (O.S.)
                    Yes, Pilot, I see it.


      And we SEE the huge, coarse Tragin ship, dwarfing Moya.

      Several harpoons, each trailing a hauling line, already 
      piercing Moya's hull.


      As the hauling lines begin snapping free of the harpoons.


      Harpoons angling from her sides, Moya begins to glow blue.

      The glow is irregular, and Moya shudders throughout -- but 
      she manages to complete the procedure, and she StarBursts.

      Leaving the Tragin ship alone in open space...


      Elsewhere, later.

                                  PILOT (O.S.)
                    I'm terribly upset I failed to detect 
                    the Tragins.



      Swirling mist. Eerie shadows. Wielding a torch, Crichton 
      forces his way through thorny, painful brush. SOMEONE IS 
      WATCHING; loads a NASTY DART into an ALIEN CROSSBOW. 
      Crichton stops, scans for a bearing. Swats an insect.

                                  CRICHTON
                            (softly, to himself)
                    Nothin' but rose bushes, pea soup and
                    malaria.

      THE CROSSBOW IS AIMED at Crichton. As he starts forward 
      again, A FINGER closes on the TRIGGER, and the DART FLIES!

      It whooshes past Crichton's neck by inches, hitting--

      It's intended target: A KNOT OF ALIEN HEMP wrapped taut 
      around a tree trunk. As the hemp snaps free--

      THE TRAP IS SPRUNG! Sticky alien vines whip around 
      Crichton's legs and torso like tentacles. He pulls at them, 
      but they adhere tightly.

        SPINE-TINGLING, ANIMAL CRY is suddenly moving toward 
      Crichton. He tries to pull Winona -- can't.

      He's ferociously tackled; rolling across the ground with a 
      banshee. AN ALIEN KNIFE FLASHES. His attacker is nimble, 
      and determined. Quickly, Crichton is face down, hair pulled 
      up, knife under his throat.

                                  JOOL
                            (savage hiss)
                    Your business?

      Choking, Crichton has an upside down view of her.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Hi, Jool.

      JOOL'S gone native. Hair a sexy rat's nest. Clothes of 
      local cloth and animal hides. Skin darkened. Eyes alive and 
      wild.

      She blinks a beat, then jams the knife into the dirt, and 
      rolls Crichton over, still straddling him.                                  JOOL
                    You--?!

                                  CRICHTON
                    Me, Crichton. You, apparently crazy.

                                  JOOL
                    Crichton!
                              (frantically kissing him)
                    I knew you wouldn't forget me! The 
                    more we were apart, the more I knew 
                    you'd realize you were meant to be 
                    with--

      Boots emerge from the shadows. She looks up to see--

                                  JOOL
                    Aeryn.

                                  AERYN
                    Jool.

      A WHIRRING NOISE as Rygel floats up beside Aeryn.

                                  RYGEL
                    Get another fantasy, driblox -- 
                    they're having my baby.

      Jool looks back down at Crichton, who smiles.


      In a valley below, the Great Eidelon Temple rises from the 
      mist. A DISTANT HARMONIC GONG CHIMES. We hear RHYTHMIC 
      CHANTING, a SOFT PURPLE GLOW EMANATING FROM THE TEMPLE IN 
      SYNCH WITH THE PRAYERS. As they crest the ridge, Jool is 
      explaining to Crichton, Aeryn and Rygel--

                                  JOOL
                    Once they go over the shock of being
                    suspended for twelve-thousand cycles, 
                    there was a rededication to calming 
                    those in conflict.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Are they gonna be happy with our 
                    special offer.                                  AERYN
                    Do the Eidelons know there's a war?

                                  JOOL
                    We only just found out. I finally 
                    repaired their primitive 
                      communications equipment.
                            (off Aeryn's look)
                    Yeah, how about that? I've had to 
                    become pretty resourceful.

                                  CRICHTON
                    So it's a no-brainer they'll help?

                                  JOOL
                    Maybe not. Based on everything they've
                    learned from listening to Comms 
                    traffic, they're convinced none of 
                    their progeny survived. Sorry, I told 
                    them as much.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Pikal should set that right.

                                  JOOL
                    I hope. They're peculiar; regimented. 
                    I can never guess what they'll do.

                                  RYGEL
                    So explain it. You must have some 
                    pull. You hunt for them, cook, 
                      repair--(eyes the brevity of the 
                    costume) -- and who knows what else.

                                  JOOL
                    Can I hit him?

                                  CRICHTON & AERYN
                    No.

      Jool stops walking.

                                  JOOL
                    We need to wait here until morning
                      invocations are completed.

      But Crichton, Aeryn and Rygel keep going--                                  AERYN
                    We'll make suitable apologies.

                                  CRICHTON
                    People are dying. They'll be glad we
                      interrupted.

                                  JOOL
                    You don't understand--

      Two steps later, Crichton, Aeryn and Rygel are WRACKED WITH 
      PAIN, CRYING OUT. They've entered a "zone" marked by 
      FIBROUS (CG) ELECTRICAL WEBBING (think walking into a room 
      thick with spider webs). The farther they go, the MORE 
      FIBROUS ELECTRICAL WEBBING ENGULFS THEM. Only by staggering 
      back up the hill to where Jool is can they ultimately get 
      clear.

                                  CRICHTON
                    What the hell is that?!

                                  AERYN
                    Rygel?!

                                  RYGEL
                    I'm alright; baby's alright.

                                  JOOL
                    Baby?

                                  CRICHTON
                    What the hell is that, Jool?

                                  JOOL
                    Each dawn begins by accessing
                    feelings of pain, death and terror 
                    unleashed the previous day. It's like 
                    research for them.

                                  SCORPIUS
                    Problem?

      Jool spins to see Scorpius emerging from the foliage. She 
      staggers back -- he's a ghost.

                                  JOOL
                      Scorpius?! You're dead! Your grave's
                    down there. I put a stone on it.                                  SCORPIUS
                    Thank you.

                                  JOOL
                    So you couldn't crawl out.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Next time, bigger stone.

                                  SCORPIUS
                    Stark and Pikal are back in the woods.
                    Should I bring them?

      Crichton shoots a look at Aeryn, still displeased.

                                  SCORPIUS
                    They're safe. I have agreed to your 
                    plan, your timetable, your choices. I 
                    ask for nothing in return but to be 
                    close by when you fail.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Go get 'em.

      Scorpius nods and heads back the way he came. As he does, 
      the HARMONIC GONG CHIMES STOP, along with the CHANTING.

                                  JOOL
                    We can descend now. If you put your
                    weapons aside, keep him (Scorpius) 
                    quiet, and follow my lead, perhaps 
                    you'll get what you came for.

      And as Jool begins down the hillside toward the temple...


      The hull dances with electricity.


      Crichton sits with Jool. In the distance, Rygel GROANS 
      uncomfortably and adjusts in his ThroneSled.

                                  JOOL
                            (awkward about it)
                    Anyway, uh, congratulations on the
                      pregnancy.                                  CRICHTON
                    Yeah, baby shower oughta be somethin'. 
                    You get what you needed from Pilot?

                                  JOOL
                    The war hasn't encompassed my planet 
                    yet. Pilot sent a coded signal for 
                    them to come and get me.

                                  CRICHTON
                    You can always hitch with us...

                                  JOOL
                    I wanna see Chiana and D'Argo -- may 
                    head up with you later -- but think 
                    I'11 stay here when you go. Kinda like 
                    research for me.

                                  CRICHTON
                    You'll have the big bucks lecture 
                    circuit all to yourself. "My Year With 
                    the Eidelons."

                                  JOOL
                    Is it horrible I'm thinking that?

                                  CRICHTON
                    No. You did the hard yards. And it can 
                    only be good people learn the 
                    sheriff's back in town.

                                  JOOL
                    Thanks. I have some things to take 
                    care of. I'll find you later.

      As Jool rises and heads off toward Rygel, AERYN APPROACHES 
      from the Temple.

                                  CRICHTON
                    How's it going in there?

                                  AERYN
                            (moved)
                    You should see. Incredible.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Really? Not many things wind you up.                                  AERYN
                    It's going to work. With training, 
                    Pikal and his kind will be able to 
                    influence peace in others.

                                  CRICHTON
                    No wormhole weapon.

                                  AERYN
                    You know, John Crichton, that's 
                    exactly what I was thinking.

      They share large smiles.

                                  AERYN
                    Moya's been electro-charged. I'll take
                    Rygel and Stark back up. Maybe you can 
                    persuade Scorpius to remain here for 
                    an attitude adjustment.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Wouldn't that be nice?

                                  RYGEL
                            (bad attitude)
                    Good to see you, too. Now, go away.

      They look up to see the uncomfortable Rygel shooing Jool 
      along. As Jool gives Rygel a look and EXITS...

                                  CRICHTON
                    Is it just me, or is he getting 
                    bigger?

                                  AERYN
                    Geometric pregnancy.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Please tell me that means we're gonna
                    have a mathematician.

                                  AERYN
                    Warrior, more likely. But we will have
                    it sooner than you think.

                                  CRICHTON
                    How sooner?                                  AERYN
                    The genetic modifications of someone 
                    born into battle, like myself, rapidly 
                      accelerate childbirth so we can rejoin 
                    the front line quickly.

                                  CRICHTON
                    How quicklier?

                                  AERYN
                    We'll be parents in a matter of solar
                    days.

      Crichton stares, stunned. Sees the nervousness in her eyes.

      Tenderly kisses away her doubts.

                                  CRICHTON
                    He gets your eyes, kid's gonna be a 
                    lady killer.

                                  AERYN
                    I'd prefer he not commit crimes.

      He's about to correct her misimpression when--

                                  CRICHTON
                    Did you just make a joke?

                                  AERYN
                            (straight face)
                    Soldiers have no sense of humour, 
                    John. I intend to pass that along, 
                    too.

      And as she starts toward Rygel, leaving Crichton to wonder 
      how he ever got so lucky...



      Crichton exits the temple to see Scorpius in conversation 
      with SEVERAL EIDELON PRIESTS, letting them do all the 
      talking, soaking up information. Scorpius excuses himself 
      and falls in walking beside Crichton.

                                  SCORPIUS
                      Interesting, these Eidelons.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Why don't ya tell me, Bob?

                                  SCORPIUS
                    Despite the fable that's grown around
                    them, they can only affect peace if 
                    the combatants willingly allow them 
                    near.

                                  CRICHTON
                      Fascinating. Jool's writing a book -- 
                    you could do the foreword.                                  SCORPIUS
                    The Scarrans, for certain, would 
                    destroy peace makers long before they 
                    could get close enough to have any 
                    impact.

                                  CRICHTON
                    I'm not the expert. They are. Let 'em 
                    do their thing.

                                  SCORPIUS
                    Fine. But do yours at the same time.

      Crichton stops, turns to him.

                                  CRICHTON
                    What is it you want, Scorp? Deep down? 
                    Me making weapons, that's just a means 
                    to your ends. What are they? Really?

                                  SCORPIUS
                            (honest beat)
                    Power.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Duh. But why? To pull chicks? What?

                                  SCORPIUS
                      I enjoy... the competition.

                                  CRICHTON
                            (dismissing him)
                    Play with yourself, okay.

      As Crichton starts walking again, Scorpius calls after--

                                  SCORPIUS
                    We've been here too long. I have a 
                    highly developed survival sense, and 
                    it's telling me to leave.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Buh-bye.

                                  AERYN
                    John! There's a Scarran warship 
                    closing on the planet at maximum 
                    speed.      Crichton turns to Scorpius, who shows the barest hint of a 
        supremecy-laden "I told you so" look.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Stryker, or Dreadnaught?


      The Scarrans arrive on the scene, in close proximity to the 

      TWO MISSILE-LIKE PROJECTILES are fired. Streaking toward       Arnessk, they slash toward Moya.


      Moya's tail begins to sparkle with StarBurst.

      The Decimator FIRES A LASER BURST, SHATTERING THE TIP OF 
      ONE TAIL FIN. This causes Starburst to misfire, and the 

      Moya floats sideways, out of commission, the back section 
      of one fin shattered and broken.


      As we swing around and move closer...


      MASSIVE, SWIRLING SNOWSTORM. HOWLING WIND. The Module sits 
      nearby, enshrouded by snow. Crichton is face down with a 
      mouthful of it. Staleek lays across an icy rise nearby. 
      Both men rouse...

                                  CRICHTON
                            (spitting out the snow)
                    Least it wasn't yellow.

      As they rise, EINSTEIN has appeared where a moment ago 
      there was no one. Black suit; hollow eyes; not happy. 
      Crichton gives a pathetic little wave; Staleek stiffens.

                                  EINSTEIN
                    You have violated our trust.

                                  CRICHTON
                    He has my lady and child.

                                  EINSTEIN
                      Unimportant to the larger agenda.

                                  CRICHTON
                    They are my larger agenda.

                                  EINSTEIN
                            (studies Staleek)
                    Why have you brought him here?

                                  CRICHTON
                    It's Armaggedon on our side of the 
                    fence. Everyone wants wormholes. Think 
                    of this as an educational tour.

                                    STALEEK
                    Who is this creature?

                                  CRICHTON
                    Call him Einstein... Nicely.

      Staleek raises his hand to HEAT-TRUTH EINSTEIN! 
        Anticipating this, Einstein casually flicks two fingers as 
      if brushing a crumb off someone's shoulders, and AS IF 
      VIOLENTLY STRUCK, Staleek's hand is knocked away.

      Staleek growls, again raises his hand and once again       Einstein waves his own, knocking Staleek's to the side.

                                  CRICHTON
                      Staleek... he can twist time around 
                    his little finger. Truth Ray's not 
                    going to work.

                                    STALEEK
                            (ignoring Crichton)
                      Eyen-stine - - do you possess the 
                    knowledge of wormholes?

                                  EINSTEIN
                    Yes.

                                    STALEEK
                    Can these wormholes make weapons?

                                  EINSTEIN
                    Yes.

                                    STALEEK
                    Then you will give me that power.

                                  EINSTEIN
                    No.

      Now with a fierce roar, Staleek charges Einstein to 
      throttle him. Again Einstein moves his hand through the 
      air, this time freezing Staleek in his tracks.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Humbling, ain't it?

      Staleek struggles to break out of the time warp but 
      ultimately has to bow in recognition of a higher power.

                                  CRICHTON
                    I can find wormholes. Fly through 'em.
                    Right?

                                  EINSTEIN
                    With rudimentary knowledge we have 
                    given you.

                                  CRICHTON
                    But can I make a weapon?                                  EINSTEIN
                    You cannot.

      Crichton gives Staleek a "see" expression.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Why?

                                  EINSTEIN
                    No one should have that power.

      Crichton makes a SNOWBALL and holds it in front of Staleek.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Listen up. This is your universe. And
                    this is your universe on wormholes.
                            (crumbles the snowball)
                    Mess with the natural order, you set 
                    off a reaction destroying both our 
                      dimensions. You wanna win the war and 
                    rule the galaxy, be my guest, but you 
                    don't need me to do it.

      Einstein motions for Crichton to follow him on A SHORT 
      WALK.

      Staleek, still in the time warp, can't follow.

                                  EINSTEIN
                    Returning here was wrong.

                                  CRICHTON
                    He can't come back on his own. And I
                    needed to save the people I love.
                    You owe me that for putting this crap 
                    in my head.

                                  EINSTEIN
                    It may soon be prudent to remove it.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Amen. I wanna be blonde again.

                                  EINSTEIN
                    Perhaps when the discord has ended.                                  CRICHTON
                    I don't like being your insurance 
                    policy. Especially when I don't even 
                    know what it's for.

      Einstein drills him with a look, and then -- IS GONE!

      Crichton turns back to Staleek, now released.

                                  CRICHTON
                    Happy?

                                    STALEEK
                    You truly cannot build a wormhole
                    weapon.

                                  CRICHTON
                            (snaps his fingers)
                    How quick are you?
                            (heading to the Module)
                    Stay if you want. Build a snow
                      Scarran...

      With a last look around, Staleek trudges after Crichton...


      Drifting amidst the debris of Lola, now some distance from 
      the Decimator. D'Argo has managed to get to Chiana; holding 
      onto her jersey. She is wild-eyed with fear, cheeks puffed, 
      like she's holding her breath.

      After a beat, D'Argo's lungs expand and he places his mouth

      over hers, BREATHING INTO HER to keep her alive...


      He no longer has air to give. They trade sad, 
        acceptingglances. And as their eyes begin to roll up--

      A SPACE-SUITED HAND grabs D'Argo' s arm and spins him 
      around!

      ANOTHER SPACE-SUITED HAND grabs Chiana. D'Argo 's eyes go 
      WIDE as he (but not us) sees who his rescuer is...
