(LATE SPRING, 1957)
OPENING CREDITS ROLL over a TENT MONTAGE -- ASSORTED
ANGLES of a group of men hard at work erecting a large
striped "big-top" style canvas tent, INCLUDING: The long
steel stakes being sledge-hammered into the lawn,
practiced hands rapidly rigging the lines, the tall
center poles being leveraged upright, the heavy rolled-up
sections of canvas being maneuvered into position, and
ENDING WITH the canvas being hoisted up the poles as the
tent assumes its full and finished form.
NEW ANGLE - TENT
-- on the front yard of the Abbott mansion. The
residence is on Main Street, four blocks from where the
commercial district begins. The mature, over-arching
trees makes this street of prosperous houses a grand
promenade.

JACEY HOLT and DOUG HOLT walk along the sidewalk on their
way to school. Jacey is seventeen; he's as handsome and
seemingly self-confident as his younger brother is
rumpled and impulsive. Doug is fifteen, a popular
culture chameleon who takes on the colors and
affectations of whomever his "hero" is at the moment
(which presently happens to be Elvis Presley).
Jacey stops and stares with open-faced misery at the tent
on the Abbott's front yard (the installation of the tent
indicates that the Abbott's are having yet another of the
many parties they throw every year).
DOUG
Didn't get invited, huh?
JACEY
Go to hell.
DOUG
Who cares? I'm not going and I
got invited.
JACEY
Who invited you?

DOUG
Pam, I guess. I don't know.
Didn't open the envelope. I mean,
come on, every time an Abbott girl
gets her period they have some
party.
JACEY
Oh, shut up.
DOUG
Kotex parties, Kotex party hats,
pin the Kotex on the...
JACEY
Shut up!
Jacey swats Doug's school books out from under his arm --
Doug charges his brother to retaliate but they are rudely
interrupted by a CAR HORN. They scurry out of the way as
LLOYD ABBOTT pulls his 1957 Cadillac out of the driveway
and cruises down the street. Lloyd is a well-dressed-
and-fed man in his mid-forties. A Midwestern burgher, he
exudes the status he enjoys as one of the preeminent
pillars of this community. Doug is embarrassed by
Lloyd's passing, but Jacey evidently experiences a deeper
humiliation -- he gives Doug a glance of betrayal, turns
and walks down the block.

ESTABLISHING ANGLE of the modest two-story clapboard
house in a working class neighborhood. A home-made ping-
pong table takes up so much room in the detached garage
that it forced the eviction of the family car, a 1950
Plymouth coupe, which is parked nearby on the driveway.
The garage doors are open and the garage light is on.
We hear (V.O.) DOUG SINGING bits and pieces of
"Heartbreak Hotel" in his best Elvis fashion.

The curb is lined with parked cars. We hear a dance band
playing "QUE SERA" and the sounds of the party as Doug
lopes up the sidewalk sporting his India ink sideburns
and smoking a cigarette. He flicks the cigarette into
the street with well-rehearsed ease as he turns and walks
up the long driveway towards the glowing "big-top" tent.
Doug trails his hand over Lloyd Abbott's Cadillac,
caressing it from hood-to-trunk as he ambles by.

The party is going full swing as Doug wanders out of the
tent and walks down the driveway. He's had enough of
high society for tonight.
14
14
Doug strolls along the sidewalk (in a residential
neighborhood) softly singing "You Ain't Nothin' but a
Hound Dog." He pauses beside a rubbish can on the curb,
strikes a wooden match, and sets the trash on fire. As
he nonchalantly continues down the sidewalk we see
several trash cans on fire in the near distance.

Eleanor necks with Steve (Jacey's rival) on the glider in
the gazebo in the distant corner of the yard. The sounds
of the PARTY can be heard in the b.g. (the band is
playing "In Old Monterey"). Jacey stands in the shadows
of the shrubbery spying on them with pure heartache.

Jacey walks home with his eyes brimming with bitter tears
-- past the smoldering rubbish cans along the curb.

(MINUTES LATER)
As Jacey turns up the driveway, a light snaps on in the
garage. The garage doors are open, Doug sits on the edge
of the ping-pong table smoking a cigarette with his hand
still on the light fixture pull chain.
DOUG
Three out of five?
JACEY
Two out of three. You serve.
Jacey and Doug pick up their paddles and begin a game of
ping-pong. They are expert players and fierce
competitors.

Lloyd Abbott pulls his (1957) Cadillac up to the pumps.
The DING-DING of the BELL HOSE summons Jacey. He wears a
Texaco uniform complete with bow tie and cap.
JACEY
'Morning.
LLOYD
Fill 'er up.
Hi-test.
Jacey sets the pump nozzle on automatic and cleans the
windshield. Lloyd slips the ashtray out of the dash,
climbs out of the car, and empties the ashtray in the
trash can.
JACEY
That was a nice party last night.
LLOYD
You were there?
JACEY
Yes, sir.
Eleanor invited me.
LLOYD
Did she? Didn't see you.
(slight beat)
You going to be an engineer like
your dad was?
JACEY
I want to be an architect.
LLOYD
Hmmm... I guess some people care
more about having ideas that they
do about making money.
JACEY
I care about making money.
Lloyd idly examines the mechanism on the ashtray that
enables it to slide in-and-out of the dash.
LLOYD
That full suspension file drawer
your dad invented is still in
production, did you know that?
We'll ship thirty-maybe-forty
thousand of those file cabinets
this year. Hell, that drawer put
Midwest Steel Desk on the map.
JACEY
Yes, sir.
I know.

LLOYD
An architect, huh?
The GAS NOZZLE CLICKS OFF, Jacey hangs up the nozzle, and
replaces the gas cap. Lloyd pulls out his wallet.
LLOYD
You want some free advice?
JACEY
Sure.
LLOYD
Don't waste your life making other
people rich. Keep the change.
He hands Jacey a five-spot and gets into his car. Lloyd
drives away in his Cadillac. Jacey crumbles the five
dollar bill into a ball. As he returns to the office he
catches his reflection in the mirror of the cigarette
machine. He frowns and pulls off his cap and bow tie.

Doug steps out of the boathouse onto the
sagging dock and
sees a fast speedboat cutting across the
lake towing a
male water skier. (Another young man is
driving the boat
with two young women in bathing suits as
passengers.)
Victor comes out as the speedboat's wake
rocks the old
dock.
VICTOR
Assholes!
DOUG
It's Jacey -- that's him skiing.
He must've skipped out on work.

As they pass a ski ramp Steve points to it. Jacey gives
him a thumb's up gesture and Steve circles the boat
around for the approach.
SANDY
No way!
He's never done the ramp.
STEVE
He wants to do it.
Steve lines up the approach and pushes the throttle open.
Jacey swings out on the end of the tow-rope and pops over
the wake.
Eleanor leans over to Steve.
ELEANOR
You know you're going too fast?
STEVE
(grins)
Yeah, I know.
The boat zips by the ramp and Jacey's skis contact the
slippery surface and his skis go out from under him. He
takes a hard bounce, loses hold of the tow-rope, and goes
tumbling over the apex of the ramp into the water.

Lloyd Abbott's 1957 Cadillac pulls up to the pumps.
Lloyd is behind the wheel, Joan sits next to him, Eleanor
and Pamela are in the back seat. The DING-DING of the
BELL HOSE summons...

The Abbotts drive away. Jacey stands in the garage in
the b.g. He watches the Cadillac disappear into traffic.

JACEY
If Mom starts having problems with
the car stalling just change the
fuel filter. It gets clogged up
when she lets the gas tank get too
low.
DOUG
Okay.
JACEY
And every-once-in-a-while take her
to the movies so she doesn't just
sit around the house all the time
reading.

A beer beer?
JACEY

Where are we gonna get beer?
JACEY
The bait shop. If you go in alone
and nobody else is in the store,
Ernie'll sell you a couple of
bottles.

The Plymouth is parked on a dirt lane separating two
cornfields. Jacey sits on the fender of the car nursing
on a bottle of beer. Doug urinates between two rows of
corn.
DOUG
Remember that time I got my dick
caught in my zipper?
Jacey gives Doug a quizzical look.
DOUG
You know, when I was in first
grade. At school? In the boys'
room? Remember I wouldn't let
Mrs. Horton help me, so she went
and got Mom out of her classroom,
but I wouldn't let Mom help me
either. I told her to go get you.
Remember?

Yeah, I remember.

Doug retrieves his beer from the roof of the car. A
semi-trailer drives past with "Midwest Steel Desk, Inc.
-- Haley, Illinois" painted on its sides.
JACEY
We should own that company.
DOUG
What do you mean?
JACEY
Midwest Steel Desk. Dad's file
cabinet drawer. Lloyd Abbott
screwed mom out of Dad's patent
after he died.
DOUG
Says who?
JACEY
It's true.
DOUG
Mom's not stupid.
JACEY
I didn't say she was stupid.
Lloyd's pretty smooth. That's why
he owns the company.
DOUG
He owns the company 'cause he
married the boss's daughter.
JACEY
He owns the company 'cause that
patent saved the company's ass
after the war, when all the war
contracts dried up.
DOUG
Well, maybe Mom sold it 'cause we
needed the money.
JACEY
What money? We never had any
money. Money had nothing to do
with it.
DOUG
Then why did she sell the patent?

JACEY
She just did, that's all that

Jacey gestures to '57 Thunderbird convertible speeding
past them. He finishes off his beer, then:
JACEY
I guess you'll just have to be
real careful zipping up your pants
while I'm gone.
DOUG
Yeah.

Helen stands on the curb waving good-bye as the Greyhound
bus carrying Jacey away to Philadelphia departs. Doug
hangs back, leaning against the Plymouth's fender.

Doug morosely slouches along the sidewalk on his way home
from school. He sports a Band-aid on his chin. Pamela
Abbott pulls up alongside Doug and tails him in her 1958
Dodge Custom Royal Lancer convertible (with the top
down).
PAMELA
How's your chin?
DOUG
Drop dead.
PAMELA
You want a ride?
DOUG
Nope.
PAMELA
You can drive.
DOUG
I don't have my license yet.
PAMELA
I don't care.

The convertible speeds along the two-lane blacktop with
Doug behind the wheel and Pamela sitting next to him.
PAMELA
How come you never ask me out?
DOUG
What for?
PAMELA

DOUG
I see you all the time.
PAMELA

DOUG
What are you doing tonight?
You

Doug squeezes out of the small window, his legs dangling

Jacey collects his suitcase from the bus driver. He's
become very much the Ivy League man. Doug waits for him
beside the Plymouth across the street. As Jacey starts
across the street a CAR full of young women, including
Eleanor and Sandy, HONKS, and stops beside him. Jacey
hops into the car and calls out to Doug:
JACEY
Hey, Doug!
Get my suitcase!
The car pulls away and Doug irritably fetches Jacey's
bag.

The hood on the Plymouth is propped open.
Doug assists
Jacey as he replaces the fuel filter.
DOUG
How do you know when a girl's...

JACEY
What do you mean, `ready'?
Ready
for what... sex?
DOUG
Yeah.
JACEY
They're all ready for sex.
DOUG
They are?
JACEY
They might not be willing but
they're ready. Just have to make
them think you're the only one
around who has what they need.
DOUG
How do you do that?

What if you're not very dependable
or exciting, you know?
JACEY
Pretend you are.
DOUG
You mean, it's all just fake?
JACEY
The sex is real. They pretend
they don't want it. You pretend
that you care. Everybody gets
what they want.
DOUG
But what if you really feel
something for someone? Really
care for them?
JACEY
I thought you were talking about
getting laid?
DOUG
I guess. I don't know what I'm
talking about.
JACEY

The marquee reads: TONY CURTIS -- JANET LEIGH -- "THE

It's Friday night -- a long queue has formed at the box
office window, mostly teenagers, but some adults, too.
Jacey cruises past the theater in the Plymouth, looking
for... Eleanor. She chats with a group of friends
standing in line. She sees Jacey, skips over, and gets
into the car.

Lloyd Abbott opens a bottle of Coke that he just
purchased from the vending machine. His (1958) Cadillac
is being fueled at the gas pumps. As he returns to his
car he sees Eleanor and Jacey drive by the station in the
Plymouth.
57

Jacey and Eleanor are copulating on a blanket beneath a
canopy of tall trees near the river. Jacey is on top,
Eleanor has her legs clenched around his hips.
ELEANOR
Come on, come on, come on...
Her encouragement inspires their mutual orgasms.
58

Jacey and Eleanor approach the parked Plymouth. Jacey
has the blanket rolled up under his arm. Suddenly they
are captured by a pair of headlights. Lloyd Abbott
climbs out of his parked (1958) Cadillac.
ELEANOR
Hi, Daddy.
LLOYD
What are you doing out here?
ELEANOR
Fucking Jacey.
Lloyd absorbs this information without surrendering his
composure -- but Jacey cannot conceal his shock.
LLOYD
Get in the car.
ELEANOR

'Night.
Jacey doesn't respond to the kiss Eleanor gives him, but
when she places her hand on his crotch, he yanks her hand
off. Eleanor walks over and gets into the car. Lloyd
gazes at Jacey for a beat, then gets in the car and
drives away.

Helen opens the screen door and finds a well-dressed
woman standing in the yard with her face turned away.
HELEN
Hello?
The woman turns -- it is Joan Abbott. Helen is
momentarily caught off balance by Joan's bristling
presence.
HELEN
Joan.
How are you?
JOAN
May I have a word with you, Helen?
HELEN
Of course, come in.
JOAN
No... no, I don't have time...
thank you.
61
62
Helen steps off the porch and approaches Joan, who is
doing most of the talking -- but Joan seems to require a
certain distance from Helen and works her way to her
Chrysler Town & Country station wagon parked at the curb.
Joan grows more and more agitated as she talks.
63
64
Joan has the driver's door to her station wagon open now.
Helen is on the sidewalk. Her demeanor is measured,
purposefully matter-of-fact.
HELEN
I don't think that's necessary.
JOAN
Well, if I were you I would talk
to him and tell him...
HELEN
(cutting her off)
No, I'm sorry, Joan, I will not do
that. If you have something to
say to my son, then you'll have to
say it to him yourself.
JOAN
I just thought you would like to
know what he's done.
HELEN
And why on earth should I believe
anything you say, Joan?
Joan is unable to find a quick retort, she gets into her
station wagon and drives away.
Helen notices a baseball lying in the gutter, she picks
it up and cleans it off with her apron. As she turns to
go back to the house, she finds Doug standing on the
porch steps. Without warning, she expertly pitches the
baseball across the yard to Doug -- it makes his hand
sting when he catches it. Helen walks up to the porch.
HELEN
I'm going to ask you one question,
Doug, and if you have no idea, or
don't want to answer, just tell
me.
DOUG
Okay.
HELEN
Is there any sense, you think, in
which Jacey has... oh, I don't
know, it sounds ridiculous...
corrupted Eleanor Abbott? Led her
astray?
Doug's mind works in several directions at once as he
tries to figure out how much he should or could tell her.

her more than she likes him.
HELEN

I see.
(another beat)
Go finish your homework.
Doug lobs the baseball back to her and goes inside.
Helen sits on the porch steps and now the true toll that
Joan's visit has taken on Helen becomes apparent -- a
bone-weary sadness falls over her. Her "tranquility" is
not borne of happiness, it is only a means of coping with
the sadness that is at the core of her being.

A drab, four-door Chevrolet sedan with Wisconsin license
plates speeds away from town.
Incongruously, the unassuming vehicle is chauffeured by
an African-American DRIVER. There are two passengers in
the back seat: a conservatively-dressed, middle-aged
WOMAN and Eleanor Abbott. There is nothing telling about
Eleanor's countenance, neither happiness nor sadness can
be found on her face.

Doug has no reply to that.
JACEY
Eleanor was just looking for a way
out. A way out of the whole
Abbott world. And it turns out
that it takes a lot to get away.
It's not enough that you sleep
around with boys from your world,
you have to fuck boys from the
wrong side of the tracks.

Doug and Jacey play another hard fought game of ping-pong

JACEY
You're nuts. You'll never get

couldn't afford it anyway.
DOUG
I'll get a scholarship.
JACEY
I had a four-point-0 grade average
and I couldn't get a scholarship
-- so, I say you got your head up
your ass.
Jacey skillfully manipulates the volley and wins the game
with a savage return that Doug is unable to counter.
Jacey smiles, puts his paddle down, and walks out of the
garage. Doug quickly picks up a ping-pong ball and hits
it into the back of Jacey's head. Jacey turns and shoots
a perturbed look at Doug -- Doug smiles:

THEATER - SIDEWALK - DAY (MINUTES LATER)
It's snowing -- Doug paces to keep warm. He momentarily
forgets the cold as he sees Pam and three of her girl
friends come out of the drugstore across the street. The
girls are in high spirits as they get into Pam's car.
Two well-dressed townswomen (MURIEL and DORIS) encounter
Helen on their way into the apparel shop as she steps out
onto the sidewalk.
HELEN
Hello, Muriel... Doris.
The women pass by Helen with obvious reserve. Helen is
seemingly unruffled by their distant responses. She
observes Doug as he watches Pam and her friends drive
off.
Helen and Doug walk up sidewalk (towards the movie
theater -- the marquee reads: KIM NOVAK -- JEFF CHANDLER

HELEN
Why don't you drop me off at home

No, go out -- play bridge or
whatever adults do for fun.
HELEN
I read for fun.
DOUG
You read too much.
HELEN
You sound like your brother.
DOUG
Come on -- let's go see a movie.

76
(SUMMER, 1959)
The commencement exercises are being held in the
sweltering gym to accommodate the large crowd of proud
parents and family members. Doug, hot and uncomfortable
in his cap and gown, is seated among his fellow graduates
behind the podium. The PRINCIPAL (at the podium)
announces the names of the graduates as he calls them
forward to receive their diplomas.

PRINCIPAL
Pamela Louise Abbott...
Pamela rises from her seat and takes her diploma.
Lloyd and Joan Abbott applaud their daughter. Joan
stands to take a snapshot. Alice is occupied with her
restless and fussy eighteen-month-old daughter, Susan.
Doug watches Pam return to her seat; she avoids his eyes.
Helen is all smiles, this is a very special day for her.
The chair next to her is empty. She glances behind her
and sees Jacey standing in the back of the gym.
Jacey idly surveys the gathering with irritable boredom.
He is only there at his mother's insistence. His eyes
settle on... Alice Abbott.
Alice tries to quiet her CRYING eighteen-month-old
daughter (SUSAN). Lloyd makes a reprimanding aside to
Alice and she rises and carries Susan up the aisle.
Jacey's eyes follow Alice -- she notices his stare as she
passes by with Susan in her arms.
77
77
Commencement is over -- the parking lot is a sea of cars
slowly negotiating through the mob of celebrating
graduates, beaming parents, and rambunctious siblings.
As Helen slips through the crowd she is pleasantly
ambushed by three (second grade) students of hers. She
has a brief exchange with the children and then moves on.
Helen finds herself face-to-face with Lloyd Abbott as
they both attempt to pass through a narrow space between
two parked vehicles. They are both caught off-guard --
there is no graceful way for them to squeeze past each
other.
LLOYD
Congratulations, Helen.
HELEN
Thank you. Congratulations to
you, too. Where's Pam going to
school?
LLOYD
Hmm... Christ, I forgot.

LLOYD (CONT'D)
Bryn Mawr. I should be able to
remember that. It costs enough.
HELEN
She'll do well there -- a very
bright girl.
LLOYD
And Doug -- he's going to...?
HELEN
He got a scholarship to the
University of Pennsylvania --
scenic design -- theater.
LLOYD
Same school as...
HELEN
(filling in blank)
Jacey.
LLOYD
Right.
Well.
Congratulations.
HELEN
Thank you, Lloyd.
They pass each other and head their separate ways.
Their
chance meeting has not gone unobserved:
Joan Abbott has been watching them from the front seat of
Lloyd's brand-new 1959 Cadillac. She pretends to repair
her lipstick with her compact mirror as Lloyd slips
behind the wheel.
And Helen finds Jacey frowning at her. He opens the door
so that she can get into the Plymouth (Doug is already in
the back seat). Jacey glares at Lloyd as he walks around
the car and gets in behind the wheel.
Lloyd flips down his sun visor (to block Jacey's glare)
and pulls out of his parking spot.
78
79
The Holt family drives home from the restaurant -- Jacey
driving, Helen in front, and Doug in the back seat.
HELEN
What a wonderful night. What a
wonderful day. My two Ivy League
boys.
This is torture for Jacey. Doug looks out the window at
the striped tent in the Abbott's front yard as they pass
by. A party for the "Class of 1959" is underway (as a
banner on the tent proclaims). The street is lined with
parked cars and busy with late-coming guests.
Doug checks the rearview mirror for Jacey's reaction, but
his brother keeps his eyes on the road.
HELEN
I never understood that tent. I
wonder if they own it? I'm
surprised they don't just leave it
up all year long.

HELEN (CONT'D)
(slight beat)
Lloyd's mother was a tough old
bird. She sold eggs. They had a
place way out on Ditch Road near
County Line. That was ages ago.
Poor Lloyd had to walk all that
way in to school and then back
everyday. Charlie used to call
Lloyd 'Egg-head' and he didn't
mean smart.
(another beat)
I'm in the mood for ice cream.
80
80
Jacey and Doug sit on the porch steps eating bowls of ice
cream. Helen rises from the porch swing and takes her
empty bowl inside the house.
HELEN
I think I'll have one more scoop.
DOUG
Ping-pong?
JACEY
Too hot.
DOUG
You want to go out to the lake and
get a couple beers?
JACEY
No, I don't want to go out to
the...
(exhales)
Goddammit. Goddammit! Look, I
don't want you in Philadelphia. I
don't need you around to remind
everybody that I come from
Hicksville, U.S.A. So if you're
going to go to Philadelphia,
you're on your own, dip shit. I
don't need you riding my coat
tails. Christ -- why don't you
get your own life? Stop being my
fucking shadow.
Doug digests Jacey's insult, then scoops a ball of ice
cream out of his bowl with his spoon and flings the gooey
ice cream into the side of Jacey's face. Doug rises and
goes to the front door.

DOUG
Screw you.
JACEY
You little prick!
Jacey hurls his BOWL at Doug -- it misses and SHATTERS on
the wall.
DOUG
Missed me, peckerhead.
As Doug opens the screen door Jacey dives into him --
they fall into the porch swing with such force that its
chains rip out of the porch ceiling and Doug, Jacey, and
the swing go overboard off the end of the porch into the
shrubs.
HELEN (O.S.)
(inside house)
Doug?
Jacey? What was that?
Doug and Jacey scramble to their feet, their clothes are
ripped and disheveled.
JACEY
You're dead, dip shit!
DOUG
You gotta catch me first, asshole!
Doug takes off with Jacey in hot pursuit. A few beats
later, Helen steps out onto the front porch and discovers
her sons and the porch swing missing.
HELEN
Jacey?
Doug?
81
81
Jacey races up a driveway -- Doug is nowhere to be seen.
JACEY
Come on, weasel dick! Come on
out, you chicken shit!
A collection of GARBAGE CANS EXPLODE in all directions as
Doug pops up from behind them and bolts down the
driveway. Jacey chases after him, following him across
the street. They pay no heed to Helen (in the b.g.)
standing in their front yard, calling out to them:
HELEN
Douglas Lee!
John Charles!

NEIGHBORHOOD - HOLT HOME

Porch lights are turning on up and down the block and the
neighborhood DOGS begin to HOWL as Doug leads Jacey
between two houses.
83
NEIGHBORHOOD - HOLT HOME

Doug jumps up onto a tall wooden fence. He gets halfway
over when Jacey leaps up and grabs him and the fence
collapses, dumping them into a back yard vegetable
garden.
84
NEIGHBORHOOD - HOLT HOME
84
Doug and Jacey wrestle and grapple in the muddy soil,
cursing each other and crushing the rows of green crops.
MRS. PORTER appears at her back door brandishing a broom.
MRS. PORTER
Git!
Stop that! You two git!
She sails into combat with her broom swinging. But Doug
and Jacey are unwilling to give up the fight -- they are
finally separated by a strong blast of water. They
sputter for breath and discover that Helen is holding the
hose.
85
85
Helen sits in a lawn chair in the back yard wearing a
large straw hat and reading a book. Doug and Jacey are
repairing and painting the fence. Helen looks up from
her book:
HELEN
That board doesn't look straight,
Jacey. Come on, Doug, you've been
painting the same spot for the
last five minutes.
86
86
Doug and Jacey clean their hands with turpentine. Doug
picks up a ping-pong paddle and bounces the ball on it,
trying to see how long he can keep it bouncing. Jacey
finishes cleaning up, picks up a paddle, and then,
without a word, Doug serves the ball and they begin to
volley.
53.
87
87
The Plymouth drives along the two-lane blacktop past the
fields of tall, green corn. Doug is driving, Helen sits
beside him. She reacts to something in the distance:
HELEN
Isn't that Pamela Abbott?
In the distance Pamela struggles with a jack as she tries
to remove a flat tire on her convertible.
Doug grimaces as he recognizes her.
HELEN
It is Pam.
Pull over.
Doug reluctantly pulls over beside Pam's car. She's no
more pleased to see Doug than he is to see her.
HELEN
Hi, Pam.
Do you need some help?
PAMELA
Hi, Mrs. Holt. It's so darn hot
the stupid jack just keeps sinking
into the pavement.
HELEN
Well, maybe Doug can give you a
hand?
Doug frowns and slowly climbs out of the Plymouth.
DOUG
Where's the thing that goes on the
bottom of the jack?
PAMELA
What thing?
DOUG
The thing, the base that the jack
fits into?
(finds it in her
open trunk)
This.
PAMELA
Oh, I thought that was just the
'spare-tire-holder-on-er.'
DOUG
Read your manual.
Pamela would slug him if his mother wasn't present.

Mom...
PAMELA
Sure, Mrs. Holt, I'll drive him
home. Thanks for stopping.
HELEN
Of course.
Bye-bye.
Helen slides over behind the wheel and drives away.
Doug fumes silently while he reassembles the jack.

Pamela sits behind the wheel of her convertible listening
to PAT BOONE sing "April Love" on the car RADIO. Doug
drips with sweat as he tightens the lugs on the spare
tire. Pamela climbs out and inspects his progress.

DOUG
Because -- I know all the answers
on 'The $64,000 Question,' because
I have X-ray vision and I can sing
better than Pat Boone. And
because I'm really a negro, but
don't tell anyone around here,

DOUG
What's the point?
PAMELA
You tell me, because I don't get
it! Look, I'm not rich, my father
is. And I didn't pick my father.
And if I had a choice between
having tons of money or having
another father, I'd be absolutely
delighted to be poor! But
unfortunately life is not a
cafeteria!
DOUG
Life is not a cafeteria?
PAMELA
You know what I mean!
DOUG
Shit, I'm supposed to feel sorry
for you 'cause you're rich?
PAMELA
Well, am I supposed to feel sorry
for you 'cause you're so poor?
DOUG
No.
PAMELA
So then just stop it!
DOUG
Stop what?!
PAMELA
Stop treating me like an Abbott!

Well, how am I supposed to treat
you?

PAMELA
And you don't have to say you're
sorry, and you don't have to look
like somebody just ran over your
dog. You just make me want to
scream sometimes.
Doug stares at her as if he's never seen her before.

What are you looking at?
DOUG
You.

Jacey lounges on top of a blanket beside a cooler.
ALICE (O.S.)
Where is everyone?
Jacey sits up and finds Alice standing behind him. She
carries a picnic basket. Other than a few children
skipping rock into the river they are alone.
JACEY
We are everyone.
ALICE
But you said...
JACEY
(overlapping)
No, I didn't. I just said a
picnic. I didn't say if anyone
else was coming.
Alice walks away.
Jacey jumps up and runs after her.

I'm married.
JACEY
I thought you were getting a
divorce?
ALICE
I am, but it's not final yet.
Besides, I'm two years older than
you.
JACEY
Good, if the cops come around we'll
tell 'em you bought the beers in
the cooler.

91
LATER THAT DAY
Jacey and Alice wander along a path on the riverbank.
ALICE
I knew he would hit me. Peter's a
real hot-head. I knew if he hit
me hard enough, hurt me enough,
that even my father wouldn't stand
for it. Then one night I put too
much soap in the washing machine
and it overflowed. That did it.
He punched me. Broke my front
tooth.
JACEY
Bastard.
ALICE
So... what do you hear from
Eleanor?
JACEY
I don't.
Do you?
ALICE
No.
Did you love her?

JACEY
We weren't in love, we were in

JACEY
Then why did you marry him?
ALICE
Because...
92
92
Jacey holds open the driver's door as Alice climbs in
behind the wheel (of her mother's Town & Country station
wagon). He closes the door.
JACEY
Which tooth was it?
She points to a front tooth.
He leans over to look at
it.
ALICE
This one. I had it capped.
You
can't really tell, can you?
JACEY
No.
It's a beautiful mouth.
ALICE
Are you going to kiss me?
JACEY
I don't want to scare you.
ALICE
I can't see you again, Jacey.
JACEY
Sure you can.
There are ways.
ALICE
Oh, God... why you? Why am I
telling all these things to you?
(CONTINUED)
61.
92

JACEY
Because there's no one else you
can tell them to. Because I'm the
only person you know who will
admit to your face that your
father's a bag of shit. The
biggest bag of shit in this town.
(slight beat)
Better head home. Shouldn't be
gone too long.
Alice drives away.
Jacey smiles -- he's won.
93
93
The Plymouth cruises back toward town. Jacey drinks a
bottle of beer and happily contemplates the possibilities
of a relationship with Alice. He approaches a billboard
that reads: "MIDWEST STEEL DESK, INC. -- Welcomes You to
Haley, Illinois."
Jacey drains the last of the beer and hurls the empty
bottle at the billboard as he drives past it.

LATE AFTERNOON)
Pam's convertible is parked in a weed-choked yard. Pam
and Doug hurl rocks at the windows, trying to break what
is left of the shattered windows on the weather-beaten,
two-story farmhouse.
PAMELA
Who do you look like more, your
father or your mother?
DOUG
Hell, I don't know.
PAMELA
Well, what did your father look
like?
DOUG
Like a photograph. I never knew
him. He died like a month before
I was even born. Jacey probably
looks more like him than I do.
Jacey's named after him. That's
how he got to be called 'Jacey,'
after his initials, John Charles,
J.C.

PAMELA
He died in a car wreck, right?
DOUG
You never heard about that?
PAMELA
About what?
DOUG
Well, it was sort of a car wreck.
He drowned, or froze to death, or
both, I don't know. He was trying
to drive out to Mud Island.
PAMELA
Mud Island's in the middle of the
lake.
DOUG
It was winter time, the lake was
froze over.
PAMELA
Jesus, that's pretty stupid.
(catches herself)
Sorry.
DOUG
It's all right, it is stupid.
Real stupid. He did it on a bet.
He bet someone twenty bucks that
he could do it. He made it all
the way out there, too. He went
through the ice on his way back.
95
95
Doug and Pamela sit on the ridge of the farmhouse roof
(they climbed out of a dormer window from the attic).
DOUG
I think my dad was like Jacey is.
Some guys are just dare-devils. I
bet Jacey once that he couldn't do
a back-flip off the garage roof
into a big pile of leaves. And he
did it.
PAMELA

One time Eleanor and I snuck out
and walked around the yard naked.

DOUG
You did?
PAMELA
Yeah. It was sort of a dare, too.
She dared me, I dared her, so we
both did it.
DOUG
Was this day or night?
PAMELA
Night.
DOUG
Was there a full moon?
PAMELA
I don't remember.
DOUG
You walked around the yard or did
you like run from tree to tree?
PAMELA
We just walked around the yard.
DOUG
Front yard or back yard?
PAMELA
Back yard.
DOUG
Oh.
PAMELA
Does it matter?
DOUG
Yeah. Back yard nudity is
hypocritical. It's insincere.
People should do and say exactly
what they feel or think and not
try to hide things.
PAMELA
Okay.

Okay.
Their conversation is stifled by this new standard of
absolute honesty.

PAMELA
Hi.
DOUG
You look pretty.
PAMELA
Really?
DOUG
Yup.
Pamela takes his hand, gently unfolds it, and with her
index finger she writes on his palm, "I love you."
Telling him took all the nerve she could muster, she
hasn't the stamina for a disappointing response -- she
places her fingers on his lips to silence him. Doug
leans over and kisses her, sweetly and tenderly, and for
a long time. They will always remember this kiss.

The bus pulls away. Doug waves as the bus goes down the
street -- then he leaps with surprise as an impatient
Jacey leans on the CAR HORN.

Pamela rushes out of the house with her shoes in her
hand. Doug chases after her in his bare feet.
DOUG
Hey... hold up!
PAMELA

DOUG
Hell, I didn't know. What does
this got to do with us?
PAMELA
My God... what is she doing?

Why is it okay for you to sneak
around with me, but it's not all
right for Alice to sneak around
with Jacey?

PAMELA
Because I'm not Alice! And you're

mom, they both get hurt so easy,
they're like turtles without
shells.
DOUG
Come on, take it easy.
PAMELA
You don't know my father. You
don't know how he is about Jacey.
He blames him for everything that
happened with Eleanor.
DOUG
Eleanor fooled around with lots of
guys, it's not Jacey's fault your
dad kicked her out.
PAMELA
Oh, Jesus! He didn't kick her
out, he put her in a nut house!
He shipped her off to this clinic
in Wisconsin.
DOUG
(taken aback)
But... I thought you said she's in
Chicago?
PAMELA
She is now.
They let her out a
month ago.
DOUG
Oh, shit.
PAMELA
Yeah.
Shit.

The Plymouth approaches -- Jacey turns off the headlights

He grabs her arm and stops her.
JACEY
What's wrong?
ALICE
I spend all day, every day, just
waiting and waiting to be with
you, waiting to forget everything,
you make me forget... but then
when I get dressed and I come
home, you... just... leak out of
me. Leak away. I go into the
bathroom and I wash you off of me

shouldn't see each other right
now.
DOUG
Oh, yeah?
Why?
PAMELA
Well... if my father... I don't
really care what would happen to
me if he found out I was seeing
you, but I have to take care of
Alice and my mother and Eleanor,
and... well, it would be hard for
me to do that if I were in the

hose back on. He doesn't look up as she drives away.

Helen approaches the foot of the stairs drying her hands

marry her.

HELEN
Alice is a grown woman, she's a
mother with a child of her own; if
she really loves you then she
should...
JACEY

All that matters is that I get her
away from them before they find
out.

I can't be a party to that, Jacey.
JACEY
I don't need your help.
I'm not
asking for it.

Pam's convertible barely comes to a halt at the curb
before Jacey comes charging out of the house to Pam.
Doug is occupied with the lawn mower; he doesn't notice
Pam and Jacey at first. (Jacey and Pam have to speak
over the din of the LAWN MOWER.)
JACEY
How is she?
PAMELA
She's all right.
JACEY
Can I see her?
PAMELA
At the boathouse -- at the lake.
Jacey turns and dashes up the driveway.
Doug watches Jacey jump into the Plymouth and speed down
the driveway and then up the street.
Doug SHUTS OFF the LAWN MOWER and walks over to Pam.
DOUG
What's going on?
She looks at Doug with tears in her eyes.
PAMELA
I had to... for Alice's sake.
DOUG
(puzzled)
Had to what? What?
PAMELA
Tell Jacey I'm sorry.
Pam drives away.

The PLYMOUTH SKIDS to a stop behind the Abbott's Town &
Country station wagon. Jacey jumps out of his car and
rushes into the boathouse.

Jacey hops into the PLYMOUTH and PEELS OUT as he speeds
away. Lloyd Abbott steps out of the boathouse and
approaches the station wagon.

Jacey doesn't look out the window as the bus (on its way
out of town) drives past the illuminated billboard that
reads: "MIDWEST STEEL DESK, INC. -- Welcomes You to
Haley, Illinois."

The bus cruises along the two-lane blacktop.

PHILADELPHIA) - DAY (MONTHS LATERLATE FALL, 1959)
Doug walks along the sidewalk towards the entrance of the
theater carrying some rolled-up plans under his arm. He
reacts as he sees:
DOUG
Hey!
Hey!
Pam!
Pamela Abbott walks across the quad. Pam is 19 years old
now, her beauty in full bloom. Doug jogs over to her.
DOUG
Hi.

PAMELA
Hi.
DOUG
What are you up to?
PAMELA
I come down to use the library
sometimes or go shopping.
DOUG
How's Bryn Mawr?
PAMELA
Very... Bryn.
I got to catch the
bus back.
DOUG
Just have to drop off these set
designs -- you want to go get
something to eat?
PAMELA
I can't.
Sorry.
DOUG
Why not?
It's been a long time.
PAMELA
You seem taller.
DOUG
(re: her figure)
And you seem... not so plain.
(slight beat)
So, dinner, okay?
PAMELA
I can't.
I have to go to this
party.
DOUG
What party?
The traffic light changes and the other pedestrians cross
the street.
PAMELA
Just a party I got roped into
going. Maybe some other time,
okay? I mean it, really.
DOUG
Just call -- I'm at Reed Hall.

Doug watches her cross the street.

escape ladder descends to the pavement. Doug climbs
down.

DOUG
Come on -- up we go.
Pam?
Pam keels over and vomits.

Doug
stirs from his sleeping spot on the floor (he slept
with
his clothes on). He notices that Pam's clothes have
been
removed from the radiator. He sits up and finds
that
the bed is empty. She's gone.
140

Pamela approaches her dorm carrying an armload of books.
She starts up the steps then stops when she sees Doug.
DOUG
You're welcome.
PAMELA
I'm sorry, Doug.
DOUG
Shit.
That's it? You're sorry?
PAMELA
(suddenly alarmed)
Oh Jesus... did we?
DOUG
Oh-Jesus-did-we what?
PAMELA
Did we... do it?
DOUG
What do you think?
PAMELA
I... don't... remember...
DOUG
Goddammit. Well, I know you might
find this hard to believe, but I
don't sleep with drunks.
He walks away.
She calls after him.
PAMELA
Doug?
Hey!
141

Doug lounges on his bed reading a textbook. It is
raining outside. He is startled by a TAPPING on the
windowpane. Pamela is outside on the fire escape. He
ignores her.

PAMELA
Doug! Open the window!
Come on,
I'm freezing. Doug...!
He gets out of bed, unlatches the window, then returns to
the bed and his book. Pamela opens the window (with
difficulty) and climbs in. She drapes her wet coat over
the radiator and sits in the desk chair.
DOUG
If you feel like you're gonna puke
use the wastebasket there.
PAMELA
I'm sorry. I am so sorry. I was
embarrassed. I didn't know where
I was when I woke up. I felt like
I was dying, so, I just... I was
going to call you.
Doug doesn't respond -- he turns the page of his book.
PAMELA
I don't know... I was blotto. I
mean, I was so happy to see you.
Then I just got sad. I got sad.
And stupid. It happens, you know?
Doug snaps his book shut.
DOUG
You want to hear something stupid?
PAMELA
What?
DOUG
When I was cleaning you up, wiping
the puke off your face, I suddenly
realized how much I miss you --
how much I love you. How's that
for stupid?
Pam is stung by his flippancy, she begins to cry.
DOUG
What are you crying for?
PAMELA
I love you.
But it's too late.
DOUG
Why?

PAMELA
Everything's too screwed up.
Doug kneels in front of her and anxiously tries to
console her.
DOUG
No, no, it's not too late. It's
perfect timing. We're on our own
now. No Jacey and Eleanor or
Jacey and Alice. That's what
stinks about being the youngest,
we have to sweep up after
everybody else. But now it's just
us. It's our turn.
PAMELA
How can you be in love with me?
DOUG
How can you be in love with me?
PAMELA
'Cause I've always have been.
You... block-head.
He kisses her, then he gazes at her and strokes her hair.
DOUG
Hi.
PAMELA
Hi.
DOUG
You want to see something?
PAMELA
What?
DOUG
Come on.

Doug comes out of the apartment house and walks up the
sidewalk. Tears begins to stream down his face. He
begins to run and run as fast as he can.

Doug approaches Pam's dormitory.
153
154
The Abbott house is decked with snow. Doug sits
behind
the wheel of the Plymouth. He's parked down the
street.
He smokes a cigarette and stares at the house --
the
pavement outside the driver's window is littered
with
butts.

Alice comes out on the street laden with packages and
shopping bags. She's startled by Doug when he falls in
beside her and follows her down the sidewalk.
DOUG
Where's Pam?
ALICE
I don't know.
DOUG
Is she with Eleanor?

DOUG
In Chicago?
ALICE
I don't know.
DOUG
I couldn't find Eleanor's name in
the Chicago phone book.
ALICE
Maybe it's unlisted.
DOUG
Well, do you know Eleanor's
address?
ALICE
No. I don't know her address, I
don't know her phone number.
You'd have to ask my father for
it. All right?
Alice turns and steps into another shop -- leaving Doug
behind on the sidewalk.

The bus cruises along the narrow ribbon of pavement.

-- sitting by himself; there's not many passengers today.
We hear the VOICES of rambunctious CHILDREN...
160
164
The distance between Jacey and Doug is telling, as is the
difference in their behavior. Doug leans against a wall
with his hands in his pockets, his eyes cast down on his
shoes. Jacey roams the alley unable to stand still for
grief. He lights a fresh cigarette off the butt of
another.
JACEY
Why?
Why didn't she tell us?
The FUNERAL DIRECTOR appears in the back door:
FUNERAL DIRECTOR
Gentlemen...

Doug sits at the table wrapping dishes in newspaper.
Jacey comes in with a framed photograph of their
grandmother.
JACEY
Do you want this picture of
Grandma?
DOUG
You can have it.
JACEY
You sure?
DOUG
Yeah.
Jacey steps out of the dining room.

Doug follows Jacey to the door of the bus. Neither one
of them knows how to say good-bye, after an awkward beat:

Do me a favor. Don't stand here
and wave good-bye... it makes me

DOUG
Okay.
See you.
Doug turns and walks away.
Jacey climbs onto the bus.

Doug drives home from the bus depot in the old Plymouth.
He slows as he sees... the party tent in the Abbotts'
front yard (with its canvas sides rolled up).
Susan's third birthday party is underway, dozens of well-
dressed children and their parents are in attendance.
Alice (who is very pregnant) and Peter Vanlaningham and
Lloyd and Joan Abbott watch Susan riding her new pony, a
gift from her grandparents. A new generation of Abbott
parties has begun.
171

A "For Sale" sign has been placed on the front yard.
Doug pulls up the driveway in the Plymouth. He turns OFF
the ENGINE but doesn't get out of the car. Then he
STARTS the CAR again and backs out of the driveway.

NIGHT
Doug navigates the busy sidewalk to the entrance of the
building. He checks the number over the door to the
address on the scrap of paper in his hand.
175
NIGHT (MINUTES LATER)
Doug knocks on the door. Eleanor opens it, she's dressed
for work in her stewardess uniform. She's obviously
surprised to find Doug on her doorstep, but she greets
him with a warm smile.
DOUG
Where is she?

SIDEWALK - NIGHT (SHORT TIME LATER)
Pamela dresses a mannequin in the display window. As she
moves behind the mannequin to fasten a garment she sees
Doug standing on the other side of the glass watching her
from the sidewalk. Doug writes a message on the plate
glass window with his index finger (printing the letters
in reverse so that the message is legible from Pam's
POV); his message reads: "I love you."

Pamela comes out of the store via the revolving door and
finds Doug waiting for her on the sidewalk.
PAMELA
How can you...?
DOUG
How can I what?
PAMELA
Ever... forgive me?
DOUG
You always loved me no matter what
I did, right?
PAMELA
Yeah.
DOUG
Maybe that's how I love you -- no
matter what. That's the best kind
of love, you know?
PAMELA
But... oh, Jesus... how do we
start all over again?
Pam's eyes fill with tears. Doug steps over to her and
embraces her tenderly, holding her close.
DOUG
There.
We're doing it.
PAMELA
(through her tears)
Doing what?
DOUG
Starting over.
So, what are you
doing tonight?
You want to go
out?
PAMELA
You're crazy.
DOUG
Some people never change.
He wipes her tears from her cheeks with his fingers, then
gives a short, but sweet, kiss. Then he smiles:
