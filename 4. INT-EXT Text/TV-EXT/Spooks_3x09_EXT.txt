                    That would suit me fine.

                    Good. I was going to suggest that

                    give me a ring and I get you the 
                    money.

                    Of course.  No problem.  My 
                      daughter s school is just round the 
                    corner.  Trinity House.

                                  JULIET (O.S.)
                    Oh.  Really.  I want to send my 
                    little girl there but everybody 
                    keeps saying how oversubscribed it 
                    is, how impossible it is to get in.

      And we see on Fiona s face that this is going a little better 
      now.

                                  FIONA
                    There are ways.  As with 
                      everything.  I mean,  I m on the 
                    PTA, if there s anything I can do 
                    to help...

                                  JULIET
                    I m not sure I could...

                                  FIONA
                    Really, it s fine.  The least I can 
                    do, given the damage I ve done.  
                                                                                              *

                                  JULIET (O.S.)
                    Well, why don t I drop by your 
                    place?  If that s easier...  

                                  FIONA
                    Yeah, I ll tidy up.
                                                                                              *

      Fiona pulls up in her car on one side of the side of the 
                                                                                              *
      street.  She s watching something.
                                                                                              *

      Ahead of her we see Juliet getting out of a taxi, walking up 
                                                                                              *
      the drive of a large terraced house and going up the steps to 
                                                                                              *
      the substantial front door.
                                                                                              *

      She pauses a moment to adjust her hair.  Undoes a button on 
                                                                                              *

      The door is opened.  A dark haired, good looking guy greets 
                                                                                              *
      her with a kiss, they giggle and she disappears inside.
                                                                                              *

      Fiona has seen all this.  She smiles and drives away.
                                                                                              *

      Ruth comes into the observation room and hands Adam some more

      He takes up the papers and she heads out of the room.  As she 
                                                                                              *

      Ruth stops and turns to him.

      Adam and Harry cling onto the back of a twin-engined 300 hp 
      police patrol boat that powers down the Tideway towards the

      Morgan sits in the stern of the boat with them.
