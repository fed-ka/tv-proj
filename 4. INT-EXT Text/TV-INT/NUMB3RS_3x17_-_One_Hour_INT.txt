                We still have ten minutes before 
                the session.

                you weren't there to stop... would

                Last I heard, they handed out more 
                than one gun and badge.

  Bradford considers for a beat, then:

                Turn off your cell phone.

  Don hesitates, then turns off his cell phone.  Giving 
  Bradford the stink-eye.

                You re mad at me now.

  Will takes his coffee to the office, opens the door.

                No, they were able to get on it... 
                but it seems like the callers were

                is sort of like text messaging, but

                Part of the job description, right?
                You want a confession from a 
                  murderer, you have to understand 
                how he s thinking.  You re hunting 
                  a pedophile, you have to know why 
                he s doing it, what he s going to 
                do next.

                              DON 
                Sure. But Megan... she can take it 
                to another level.


  MEGAN studying FILES -- arrest reports, psych profiles, 
    surveillance studies -- on Che Lobo.  Various ARTICLES about 
  him -- newspapers, Latin Hip-Hop glossies -- up on the

  CHARLIE driving, AMITA sitting in the passenger seat, typing 
  on her computer.  Both speaking on the hands-free:

                              CHARLIE
                We'll be there in less than five 
                minutes.

                              MEGAN
                We might not have five minutes.

                If you give me the receiving phone 
                number, I can put an exploit on it.

                              MEGAN
                An exploit?

                              CHARLIE
                  A computer-based phone call is 
                really no different from e-mail. 
                  Information packets travel across 
                the internet --

                              AMITA
                Kind of like luggage at the 
                airport.

  of a SUITCASE handed to an AIRLINE AGENT -- carried across 
  the conveyor belt --

                              AMITA (CONT'D)
                In order to get the suitcase to its 
                  destination point, it may have to 
                travel through a number of 
                  different airports.
                      (beat)
                Using an exploit, we mark the call--

  On the SUITCASE, as STICKERS FROM DIFFERENT COUNTRIES are 
  slapped across it --

                              AMITA (CONT D)
                -- slapping stickers on it so we 
                can see which countries it visited.

  -- dropping into a LUGGAGE CAROUSEL, covered with stickers 
  now.

  BACK TO SCENE

                              CHARLIE 
                The bodyguard s cell phone is both 
                the origin point and the 
                  destination for these packets -- if 
                we know where they travel, we may 
                be able to locate the other caller.

                              MEGAN
                Sounds kind of like a computer 
                virus.

  Megan hangs up, turns to LIZ WARNER, who is entering --

  Liz nods and heads out...

  Will looks at Don skeptically; neither of them believe it. 
  Don pauses, then walks into the office.  Will follows him in, 
  closing the door behind them.


  COLBY and Che Lobo sitting amid a buzz of FBI AGENTS in high-
  activity mode.  The CELL PHONE sits on the table between 
  them.

                              CHE LOBO
                You people wanted to get inside 
                here for three years.

                              COLBY
                How do you know we haven't been?

                              CHE LOBO
                      (smiles)
                No way.  I have the place swept for 
                wires every other day.

                              COLBY
                Hell of a way to live.

                              CHE LOBO
                You have something, there are 
                people who'll try to take it from 
                you.

                              COLBY
                You mean people like you?

                  businessman, just like me.  And I 
                know he meant it all the right ways 
                -- because that s the only part I 
                ever let him see.  You re 9 years

  Lobo reaches for it; COLBY, listening on his cell phone, puts

                  I remotely downloaded the exploit 
                onto the cell phone number you gave 
                me -- once the call starts, we 
                should be able to find the server 
                sending out the other half of the 
                  conversation.

  Colby nods to Lobo, who answers the cell; Colby listening on 
  a TECH's recording apparatus --

  War Room position)

                answer, the boy dies.

  Duque hangs up.  Lobo is silent for a beat --

  lamp.  Storming off.

                No one in or out until I give the 
                all clear.

  He opens the door, jumping out as the car slows but before it 
  stops -- 

                              DAVID (CONT'D)
                If I yell, though?  Run in, fast.


  As DAVID enters -- alert and cautious, but affecting a casual 
  enough pose not to draw any attention.

  He moves along the tables; only a few computers are being 
  occupied; by students, researchers, oddballs.  He scans them 
  all, assessing each person with a glance...

  ... then moves through the stacks, checking everyone out...

  ... takes out his cell phone to make a call --

  -- and A LIBRARIAN is right on him.

                                LIBRARIAN
                No phone calls.  What is it with 
                you people?

  David taking out his ID --

                I just chased another one out of 
                here -- it's bad enough when they 
                listen to music on their laptops -- 
                now they sit and talk to them.

  Off David --

                You're telling me what you think -- 
                what does he think?

  Don gives that a moment's fair thought --

                              DON
                Probably that I'm tough on him, 
                  sometimes.  But he knows it's about 
                getting the job done.

                              WILL BRADFORD
                How does he handle it -- when 
                you're tough.

                              DON
                The way we all do... put it away 
                and get back to work.

  Megan brings up RAP SHEETS on RICO and CARLOS on the plasma--

                              MEGAN
                LAPD was right -- Rico Orojos and  
                Carlos Lalo were 18 Street Mexicali 
                with long rap sheets.
                      (beat)
                Of course, so are two-thirds of Che 
                Lobo's people.  You have something?

                              DAVID
                Kind of wondering how the 
                  kidnappers knew that Orojos  cell 
                phone was on this Webline service.

  CHARLIE and AMITA entering the WAR ROOM --

                              CHARLIE
                We were just about to raise that 
                very point.

                              AMITA
                When you make a VoIP call to a 
                  traditional phone number, you have 
                to pay a fee --

                              CHARLIE
                -- which involves a traceable 
                  transaction... usually a credit 
                card.
                      (beat)
                The reason that these calls weren't 
                  traceable by traditional means was 
                that Orojos  cell phone was a VoIP 
                client as well -- which required 
                the installation of special 
                  software.

                              MEGAN
                The kidnappers had to know that in 
                advance.

                              AMITA
                I ran a check through Webline --

                              CHARLIE
                -- via a method that must violate 
                two or three telecommunications 
                laws --

                VoIP software onto his cell phone 
                until last week.

                              CHARLIE
                Which means that he was expecting 
                the call.  Which means --

  WILL BRADFORD and DON.

                              WILL BRADFORD
                  Granger's the junior agent.

                              DON
                Least time with the Bureau -- but I 
                don't know about "junior."

                              WILL BRADFORD
                He's got military.

                              DON
                  Afghanistan.

                              WILL BRADFORD
                He bring it back with him?

                              DON
                  Probably... but he doesn't let it 
                eat him up.

                              WILL BRADFORD
                Maybe you've got something to learn 
                from him there.

                              DON
                Maybe.


  As the DRIVER passes the bag back to CHE LOBO, who unzips it 
  and looks at the STACKS OF CASH inside.  COLBY looks on --

                              COLBY
                No questions asked...

                              CHE LOBO
                Ever seen that much money in one 
                place?



                                                                          (CONTINUED)   NUMB3RS  317/54  "One Hour"  GOLDENROD Rev   2/07/07    33.

                Once... an Al-Qaeda safe house in 
                  Kandahar.

                              CHE LOBO
                Keep a little for yourself?
                      (off Colby)
                You didn't did you.  Dudley Do-
                Right.

                              COLBY
                I don't look good in gold chains 
                and a luxury SUV.

  Che laughs at this.  Colby talks into an EARMIKE RADIO --

                              COLBY (CONT'D)
                We've picked up the money.


  And MEGAN --

                              MEGAN
                I've got David and Liz about five 
                minutes out.  They'll run the 
                physical surveillance.

  Megan hangs up -- tries a PHONE NUMBER again -- busy -- 

                              MEGAN (CONT'D)
                Your brother still isn t answering 
                his phone -- 

  CHARLIE and AMITA have TAX RETURNS and ACCOUNTING BOOKS up on 
  the big screen, and Charlie is working a problem on the clear 
  board --

                              CHARLIE
                Does 3.2 million dollars strike you 
                as an odd ransom amount?

                              MEGAN
                  Initially, I assumed there was a 
                  psychological significance.  But 
                once we knew the kidnappers had 
                accessed Lobo s financial 
                  information --






                                                                          (CONTINUED)   NUMB3RS  317/54  "One Hour"  GOLDENROD Rev   2/07/07    34.

                              CHARLIE
                -- you assumed they searched for a 
                Pooling Equilibrium -- using the 
                data to calculate the largest sum 
                of money Lobo would be able to 
                obtain on short notice.

                              AMITA
                Which suggests some fairly 
                  sophisticated thinking.

                              CHARLIE
                Given their systematic approach to 
                the ransom demand... well, there 
                are a whole set of strategies 
                called cake-cutting algorithms.

                              MEGAN
                Kind of like -- a cake?

  ENTER AUDIENCE VISION --

  of a FROSTED CAKE --

                              CHARLIE 
                Yes... picture a chocolate and 
                vanilla layer cake.  How do two 
                people share it?

  The cake is sliced open, revealing layers of white and black, 
  chocolate frosting on the outside, vanilla on the inside --

                              CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                The obvious strategy is to cut it 
                down the middle.  But if one person 
                likes frosting more that the other, 
                or one person prefers vanilla cake, 
                or one person prefers chocolate 
                cake with vanilla frosting --

  -- RESLICE the cake -- cutting out a piece of chocolate with 
  vanilla frosting --

                              CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                -- it may be that slices unequal in 
                size actually create a fairer 
                  distribution.

  BACK TO SCENE

                              CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                When you get into three people, the 
                strategies become drastically more 
                complex...

                              MEGAN
                We don't know how many kidnappers 
                we re dealing with.

                              CHARLIE
                We may not need to...

  Charlie points to the "3,200,000" figure on the board --

                              CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                ... if we can start from this 
                number and work backwards.  At 
                least two gunmen, plus the two 
                  bodyguards...

                              MEGAN
                -- but they never intended to cut 
                them in --

                              CHARLIE
                No, but the ransom demand had to 
                convince them that they would 
                receive shares.  Those shares would 
                reflect the relative difficulties 
                and risks each participant 
                  undertakes...
                      (beat)
                If we induce a cut and choose a 
                method, with an implicit Pareto 
                  Optimality -- account for costs 
                involved in preparation and 
                  anticipation of escape, assumptions 
                of negotiation or loss--

  Charlie's pen flying across the board --

                              AMITA
                That is some really cool math.

                              CHARLIE
                Always nice to have someone notice--

  He pauses, looks at the work... and writes "1,650,000."

                It s a logic maze -- one that comes 
                with a set of rules.  In this case, 
                though, the rules change each time 
                Colby arrives at a checkpoint.  You 
                know the game of Labyrinth?

                              MEGAN
                The toy?

                              CHARLIE
                A toy to you -- a classic example 
                of a state diagram to me.

  ENTER AUDIENCE VISION --

  of LABYRINTH -- a wooden maze with two knobs, navigating a 
  STEEL BALL around holes --

                              CHARLIE
                In labyrinth, you use two knobs to 
                move a steel ball through a maze.

  The knobs project out the X and Y axis of a graph --

                              CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                The knobs constitute X- and Y- axes 
                -- and the ball seems to follow a 
                simple, curving path --

  The BALL swerves around holes --

                              CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                -- but the speed of the ball adds a 
                  condition; ignore that condition --

  -- the ball drops through one hole --

                              CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                -- and fall through a hole.

  BACK TO SCENE

                              MEGAN
                The holes being the possibility of 
                capture.

                              CHARLIE
                Exactly -- each time the kidnapper 
                gets rid of surveillance, or 
                  eliminates an electronic tracer -- 
                he's navigating an obstacle.

  As COLBY runs to the PAY PHONES -- hearing a faint RINGING --

  -- realizes it isn t coming from the pay phones, but from the 
  BIG CHAIRS. He walks over, and finds a CELL PHONE under the 
  seat -- answers it --

  -- as DAVID watches from the archway on the other side --

                              DUQUE (V.O.)
                Time for you to take off the 
                  earpiece.

  Colby rips the earpiece out and flings it away.

                              DUQUE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                Tell the black guy by the archway 
                I m sick of looking at him.

  Colby hesitates --

                This can be over right now.

  -- and then WAVES DAVID OFF.

  David backs away -- gets on the radio --

                              CHARLIE

                By shooting his partner, Duque has 
                not just increased his share of the 
                ransom -- he s devised a strategy 
                to assure himself that the previous 
                strategy worked -- that Colby is 
                alone.

                              MEGAN
                We can t just wait for him to make 
                the next move.

  Duque hangs up.  Colby looks at Jo --

                Know what I did?  I threw Old Man 
                Ryan s newspaper on his roof. 
                Circled my bicycle back around just 
                to see him climbing up on his 
                ladder, pitching a fit --

  Jo cracks a smile.  Colby smiles back -- puts out his hand --
