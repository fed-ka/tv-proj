FADE IN:
Stars.
The upbeat show tune, Put On Your Sunday Clothes, plays.
"Out there, there's a world outside of Yonkers..."
More stars.
Distant galaxies, constellations, nebulas...
A single planet.
Drab and brown.
Moving towards it.
Pushing through its polluted atmosphere.
"...Close your eyes and see it glisten..."
A range of mountains takes form in the haze.
Moving closer.
The mountains are piles of TRASH.
The entire surface is nothing but waste.
"...We're gonna find adventure in the evening air..."
A silhouetted city in the distance.
What looks like skyscrapers turns into trash.
Thousands of neatly stacked CUBES OF TRASH, stories high.
Rows and rows of stacked cubes, like city avenues.
They go on for miles.
"...Beneath your parasol the world is all a smile..."
Something moving on the ground far below.
A figure at the foot of a trash heap.
A SMALL SERVICE ROBOT diligently cubing trash.
Rusted, ancient.
Cute.
Every inch of him engineered for trash compacting.
Mini-shovel hands collect junk.
Scoop it into his open chassis.
His front plate closes slowly, compressing waste.
A faded label on his corroded chest plate:
"Waste Allocation Loader - Earth Class" (WALL-E)
Wall-E spits out a cube of trash.
Stacks it with the others.
2.
Something catches his eye.
Tugs on a piece of metal stuck in the stack.
A hubcap.
The sun reflects off it.
Wall-E checks the sky.
ON TRASH HEAP HORIZON
The sun sets through the smoggy haze.
"...And we won't come back until we've kissed a girl --"
He places the hubcap in his compactor.
Presses a button on his chest.
The song stops playing.
The end of a work day.
Wall-E attaches a lunch cooler to his back.
Whistles for his pet COCKROACH.
The insect hops on his shoulder.
They motor down from the top of a GIANT TRASH TOWER.
Wall-E travels alone.
Traverses miles of desolate waste.
Oblivious to roving storms of toxic weather.
Passes haunting structures buried within the trash.
Buildings, highways, entire cities...
Everything branded with the SAME COMPANY LOGO.
"Buy N Large"
"BNL" stores, restaurants, banks...transportation!
The corporation ran every aspect of life.
There's even a BNL LOGO on Wall-E's chest plate.
CLOSE ON NEWSPAPER Wall-E drives over.
Headline: "TOO MUCH TRASH!! Earth Covered!!"
The deck: "BNL CEO Declares Global Emergency!"
A photo of the BNL CEO giving a weak smile.
Wall-E's old treads are threadbare.
Practically falling apart.
Cause a bumpy ride for his cockroach.
He passes the remains of other RUSTED WALL-E UNITS.
Fancies one with NEWER TREADS than his own...
Wall-E now sports the newer treads.
Rolls past a SERIES OF HOLOGRAPHIC BILLBOARDS.
The solar-powered ads still activate when he passes them.
3.
BILLBOARD ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
(Ad #1: BNL logo over trash)
Too much garbage in your face?
(Ad #2: starliner in space)
There's plenty of space out in space!
(Ad #3: starliners take off
from Earth)
BNL starliners leaving each day.
(Ad #4: WALL-E units wave
goodbye)
We'll clean up the mess while you're
away.
Wall-E drives down a deserted overpass.
Activates an even LARGER HOLOGRAPHIC BILLBOARD.
CLOSE ON BILLBOARD AD
Shows off a CITY-SIZED LUXURY STARLINER.
Depicts passengers enjoying all its amenities.
BILLBOARD ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
The jewel of the BNL fleet: "The Axiom".
Spend your five year cruise in style.
Waited on 24 hours a day by our fully
automated crew, while your Captain and
Autopilot chart a course for non-stop
entertainment, fine dining. And with our
all-access hover chairs, even Grandma can
join the fun! There's no need to walk!
"The Axiom". Putting the "star" in
Executive Starliner.
The BNL CEO appears at the end.
Waves goodbye as the Axiom takes off.
BUY N LARGE CEO
Because, at BNL, space is the final "fun"-
tier.
The holographic billboard powers off.
Reveals the AXIOM'S DESERTED LAUNCHPAD in the distance.
The mammoth structure sits across the bay.
Now empty and dry. A polluted, dead valley.
ON COLLAPSED BRIDGE RAMP
Near its edge rests a WALL-E UNIT TRANSPORT TRUCK.
A giant child's Tonka Truck left to weather the elements.
A "Buy N Large" logo on its side.
Wall-E approaches the rear of the truck.
4.
Pulls on a lever.
The back lowers.
Wall-E motors up the ramp.
Wall-E motors outside.
Turns over his Igloo cooler to clean it out.
Pauses to take in the night sky.
STARS struggle to be seen through the polluted haze.
Wall-E presses the "Play" button on his chest.
The newly sampled It Only Takes A Moment (IOTAM) plays.
The wind picks up.
A WARNING LIGHT sounds on Wall-E's chest.
He looks out into the night.
A RAGING SANDSTORM approaches off the bay...
Unfazed, Wall-E heads back in the truck.
IOTAM still gently playing.
...The massive wave of sand roars closer...
Wall-E raises the door.
Pauses.
WHISTLES for his cockroach to come inside.
The door shuts just as the storm hits.
Obliterates everything in view.
Wall-E's CHARGE METER flashes "WARNING".
He wakes. Unboxes.
Groggy and lifeless.
Stumbles outside.
The morning sun.
Wall-E fully exposed in its light.
His front panel splayed out like a tanning shield.
A solar collector.
6.
His CHARGE METER chimes full.
Solar panels fold away into hiding.
Wall-E, now awake, collects his lunch cooler.
Heads off to work.
...and accidentally runs over the cockroach.
Horrified, Wall-E reverses.
Reveals the FLATTENED INSECT under his tread.
The cockroach simply pops back to life.
No biggie. Ready to go.
Relieved, Wall-E resumes their commute.
A SERIES OF "WALL-E AT WORK" MOMENTS:
- CU of Wall-E's hands digging into garbage.
CU of trash being scooped into his chest compactor.
A cube lands by the cockroach.
- Wall-E discovers a BRA in the garbage.
Unsure what it's for.
Tries placing it over his eyes, like glasses.
Tosses it in his cooler.
- Wall-E finds a set of CAR KEYS.
Presses the remote lock.
Somewhere in the distance a CAR ALARM CHIRPS.
- Plays with a paddle ball.
The ball keeps smacking him in the face.
He doesn't like it.
- Wall-E discovers a DIAMOND RING in a JEWEL CASE.
Throws out the ring. Keeps the case.
The jewel case drops into the cooler, then...
...A RUBBER DUCKY...
...A BOBBLE HEAD DOLL...
...An OLD BOOT...
...A TROPHY...
- Wall-E finds a FIRE EXTINGUISHER.
Activates it.
FOAM blasts in his face.
It's tossed far, far away from his cooler.
- Wall-E's shovel hand strikes something solid.
Faces a REFRIGERATOR much larger than himself.
Now what?
- CU on fridge door.
A WELDING BEAM moves down its center.
It emits from between Wall-E's SPLIT BINOCULAR EYES.
7.
The door falls apart in two pieces. Reveals...
...a SMALL PLANT
in its early stage of growth.
Wall-E is entranced.
Carefully, he extracts the section of earth around it.
CLOSE ON IGLOO COOLER
Wall-E gently places the plant inside the old boot.
Dusts dirt off the leaves.
Robot and faithful cockroach return home.
Wall-E stops short of the threshold.
Stares at the ground.
Continues staring.
A RED DOT
quivers on the dirt.
A single laser point of light.
Wall-E moves to touch it...
...The dot races along the ground.
Wall-E drops his Igloo.
Chases after the dot.
The dot leads Wall-E deep into the polluted expanse.
He is so fixated on it he doesn't notice
MANY LASER POINTS
coming from every direction.
All racing into the valley over the contour of the terrain.
Triangulating towards a center.
Wall-E's dot suddenly stops.
Slowly he reaches for it.
Can't grab it. Just light.
ALL THE DOTS converge in front of him.
The ground shakes.
Wall-E becomes confused.
Doesn't see above him.
The SUN growing brighter behind the cloud cover.
A noise. Building.
8.
Rocket engines.
Wall-E senses he should look to the sky.
Now THREE SUNS are descending on him.
Wall-E runs for it.
An enormous COLUMN OF FIRE blocks his path.
A second column of fire.
A third.
Trapped.
Wall-E cubes the ground beneath him.
Working fast.
Noise deafening.
Heat rising.
Digs in just as a tide of flame carpets the ground...
...Then suddenly quiet.
Smoke clears.
CLOSE ON THE SCORCHED EARTH
Wall-E's head rises out of the dirt.
Glows red hot from the heat.
Trembles with fright.
Everything in shadow.
Something very big looms over him.
Wall-E climbs out of his hole.
Bangs his head on metal.
WIDE on a massive SPACESHIP.
Rests ominously in the empty bay.
A PORTAL on its underside opens.
Frightened, Wall-E tries to hide.
Nowhere to go.
He places a SMALL ROCK on his head. Boxes up.
A DEVICE lowers to the ground on a long stem.
Scans the surface.
Wall-E creeps closer for a better look.
The device unfolds.
Wall-E boxes up again.
A CAPSULE descends from a chute in the stem.
ROBOT ARMS emerge from the device.
Place the capsule on the ground. Press buttons.
The capsule falls away in sections, to reveal...
...a PROBE ROBOT.
It hovers gracefully above the ground.
White. Egg-shaped.
9.
Blue-lit eyes.
Female.
Eve.
Wall-E is transfixed.
Inches closer.
Watches Eve from behind the device.
Tilts his head.
Time stops.
She's the most beautiful thing he's ever seen.
Eve hovers over the ground.
A BLUE RAY emits from her front panel.
Fans out 180 degrees.
Scans random objects and areas.
The device rises back into the ship.
Exposes Wall-E.
He rushes for cover behind the nearest rock.
Never takes his eyes off Eve.
Watches her float away from the ship.
...from the ship?
The ship!
Engines roar back to life.
Wall-E digging furiously.
The rocket takes off.
Smoke clears.
Again, a red hot Wall-E peeks out from the ground.
Looks for Eve.
She is watching the ship rise into the clouds.
Waits until it is completely out of sight...
...then Eve rises high up into the air.
She flies around the bay.
Soars like a graceful bird.
Does loops in the sky.
Zooms right past Wall-E's rock.
He is hypnotized.
Eve descends gently to the ground...
Wall-E sneaks up closer.
Hides behind another boulder.
Slips.
Makes a NOISE.
Instantly, Eve whips around.
Her arm converts into a LASER CANNON.
Blasts Wall-E's boulder to smithereens.
...Smoke clears...All quiet.
Eve, now cold and dangerous.
10.
Scans the area.
No sign of life.
All business again.
Hovers away to probe more of the planet.
ON OTHER SIDE OF BOULDER CRATER
Wall-E boxed up behind what little remains of the rock.
Trembles uncontrollably.
Eve wanders through the pillars of cubed trash.
Scans random areas.
Wall-E spies from the shadows.
Too frightened to approach.
She moves on. He follows.
Eve probes a mound of tires.
Wall-E hiding nearby.
He flinches at the sight of
HIS COCKROACH
innocently approaching Eve from behind.
She spins around.
Blasts the insect.
Wall-E is gut-punched.
The cockroach climbs out of the smoking crater.
Unscathed. Still curious.
Eve finds the insect intriguing.
Lowers her arm.
The end separates into individual hovering sections...
...A HAND.
She lets the insect crawl up her arm.
Wiggles into her workings.
It tickles.
EVE
[Giggles]
Wall-E relaxes.
CHUCKLES privately.
Eve sonically picks up Wall-E's location.
Locks onto him.
11.
Arm converts to laser cannon.
Fires rapidly.
Quick glimpses of Wall-E dodging the blasts.
Trash piles are systematically obliterated around him.
Wall-E now exposed.
Nowhere to hide.
Boxes himself up. Shakes uncontrollably.
Eve holds her fire.
EVE
(electronic hums)
[Identify yourself.]
She slowly approaches Wall-E's box.
Keeps her gun trained on him.
EVE
(electronic hums)
[Repeat. Identify yourself.]
Wall-E peeks out from his box.
Doesn't understand a thing she says.
Doesn't care.
Can't believe she's real.
The cockroach climbs down her gun arm.
Jumps onto his master.
Eve scans Wall-E.
A RED LIGHT appears on her chest.
Buzzes "negative".
He's not what she's looking for.
She retracts her gun arm.
Hovers off.
Wall-E watches her go. Lovestruck.
WALL-E
[Sigh.]
DISSOLVE TO:
LOUIS ARMSTRONG'S "LA VIE EN ROSE" PLAYS
Eve scans through the market.
Wall-E follows from a safe distance.
A stray puppy-dog.
Eve glances over at him.
Wall-E panics.
Bumps into a RACK OF SHOPPING CARTS.
Creates an avalanche.
12.
They chase him down a flight of stairs.
Wall-E reaches the exit doors.
Won't open!
Carts pig pile on top of him.
Wall-E perched on the roof.
Patiently watches Eve fly.
She scans the ground below her, like a searchlight.
Eve comes in for a landing below.
Shuts down for the night.
Wall-E waits.
Quietly sneaks down the refinery fire escape.
Accidentally trips. Tumbles to the ground.
Eve doesn't wake.
Wall-E creeps up to her.
Opens his arms wide...
...and measures her.
Turns to a pile of trash.
Splits open his eyes. Begins welding something...
DISSOLVE TO:
Eve powers up again.
Does a double take.
A TRASH SCULPTURE OF EVE stands in front of her.
She hovers away, unimpressed.
Doesn't notice Wall-E hiding behind a PILE OF PIPES.
Wall-E kicks the pipes in frustration.
They roll on top of him.
SONG ENDS
MONTAGE OF EVE SEARCHING

Negative.
Slams the hood shut.
- Scans a Port-A-Potty.
Negative.
Slams the door shut.
- Scans an Apollo capsule.
Negative.
Slams the hatch shut.
- Scans a FREIGHTER HOLD.
13.
Negative.
Slams the lid shut.
Eve hovers over the freighter.
Frustrated.
Not finding what she's looking for.
Wall-E eavesdrops from afar.
Eve flies past the ship's CRANE MAGNET.
Gets stuck.
Wrestles to free herself.
Furious, she BLOWS UP THE ENTIRE SHIP.
The reaction startles Wall-E.
Eve slumps down against a dredged anchor.
She gives up.
Concerned, Wall-E cautiously approaches.
Sits at the other end of the anchor.
Both robots stare silently at the fiery wreck.
Then...
...slowly, very slowly, Wall-E inches towards her.
Musters the courage to speak, when --
She suddenly turns to him:
EVE
(hums)
[So what's your story?]
Wall-E falls backwards with surprise.
Me?
Eve scrolls through a variety of languages:
EVE
(German)
[Directive?]
(Japanese)
[Directive?]
WALL-E
[Huh?]
EVE
(Swahili)
[Directive?]
(English)
Directive?
WALL-E
(beeps)
[Oh, I understand that!]
14.
EVE
Directive?
Wall-E eagerly turns to some nearby trash.
Scoops it into his compactor.
Proudly spits out a cube.
Points to Eve.
WALL-E
(struggles to speak)
Di...rec...t--
EVE
Directive?
Wall-E nods.
EVE
Classified.
WALL-E
(beeps)
[Oh. Sorry.]
She scans his CHEST LOGO.
EVE
Name?
WALL-E
(struggles again)
W-wally? ...Wall-E.
EVE
(smooth; almost perfect)
Wwww-aaaa-leee...
Wall-E nearly melts.
She says his name so beautifully.
Moves closer.
EVE
Wall-E.
(giggles)
Eve.
Wall-E tries to repeat it:
WALL-E
Eeee...?
EVE
(slower)
Eve.
15.
WALL-E
Eeeaaah?
EVE
Eeeve. Eeeve.
WALL-E
Eee--vah!
She giggles again.
Wall-E likes making her giggle.
WALL-E
Eee-vah! Ee --
EVE
Eve.
The wind kicks up.
The WARNING LIGHT sounds on Wall-E's chest.
He moves to grab her.
WALL-E
(Gasp!) Eee-vah!
EVE
(hums)
[Hey watch it! Don't come any closer!]
She draws her gun on him.
Doesn't understand the danger.
The sandstorm rushes up behind her.
Too late.
Wall-E collapses into a box.
The storm hits full force.
Eve is instantly lost, disoriented.
EVE
Wall-E? Wall-E?
WALL-E'S HAND appears out of the dust.
Calmly takes Eve's hand.
The morning sun.
Wall-E places Eve in his charging spot.
Aims her hovering form to face the sun.
Waits.
MONTAGE OF WALL-E TRYING TO REVIVE EVE:
- Several hot days pass with Wall-E holding vigil in the heat.
- A THUNDERSTORM approaches on the horizon.
Wall-E holds an UMBRELLA over Eve.
Gets struck by lightning.
Holds up another umbrella.
Gets struck again.

Wall-E pops out of a dune on the truck's roof.
Lifts up an UPSIDE-DOWN BARREL that protected Eve.
19.
- Wall-E pries open a panel on Eve's chest.
Reveals her pulsing BLUE HEART-BATTERY.
Attaches JUMPER CABLES to his own HEART-BATTERY.
Tries to connect the other end to hers.
An automatic defense system blows him off truck.
- Wall-E & cockroach take Eve for a walk.
Pull her along on a LEASH OF CHRISTMAS LIGHTS.
- Wall-E gives Eve a boat ride on a LAKE OF SLUDGE.
Uses an industrial tire as a boat.
Rows like a gondolier with a road sign.
- Wall-E sits by the empty bay with Eve.
Watches the SUNSET.
Burns "WALL-E + EVE" on a public trash can.
Tries to pull out her hand to hold it.
It snaps back into place, trapping his hand.
END OF MONTAGE
Wall-E has set up the TV on the roof.
The blank Eve floating next to him.
Tries unsuccessfully to play PONG with her.
Still no response.
Finally, he gives up.
WALL-E
[defeated sigh]
Wall-E loads up his cooler.
Checks on Eve one more time.
Still nothing...
Heads off to work, defeated.
Wall-E simply going through the motions.
No spirit in him at all.
Stops.
Pulls out the Zippo lighter.
Flicks it a few times.
A RUSH OF WIND blows out the flame.
Distant rumbling.
Wall-E looks in the direction of his home.
A BRIGHT GLOW is lowering down through the clouds.
20.
WALL-E
(beeps)
[Oh no.]
Wall-E racing as fast as he can.
The cockroach clings onto him for dear life.
The RECON SPACESHIP towers over his truck.
A ROBOT ARM cherry-picks Eve from the roof.
Lifts her up and into the ship's cargo hold.
Wall-E racing in the distance.
WALL-E
EE-VAH!! EE-VAH!!
Reaches the end of the collapsed bridge ramp.
Forced to watch Eve disappear into the ship.
The cargo doors slam shut.
The first of the THREE ROCKET ENGINES powers up.
Wall-E heads down a hill of rubble to the ship.
Notices his cockroach tagging along behind him.
Leads it back to the top of the hill.
WALL-E
(beeps)
[Stay.]
The insect mopes.
Droops its little antennae.
Wall-E motors back down to the rocket...
BASE OF RECON SHIP
The engines blast a WALL OF SMOKE.
Preparation for launch...
The cockroach watches his master go.
The spaceship roars through the sky.
Wall-E tightens his grip, battling the G's.
He looks ahead. SCREAMS.
HUNDREDS OF BNL SATELLITES
litter the outer atmosphere.
The ship bursts through the layer.
The recon ship breaks free of the planet.
Its boosters shut down.
Wall-E takes in the sudden QUIETNESS OF SPACE.
Looks back at his planet.
WALL-E
Oooh...
Weightlessness takes effect.
Wall-E almost floats away.
Grabs hold of the ship.
Knocks on a WINDOW near Eve.
WALL-E
E-vah!
No response. She remains shut down.
Wall-E points out at the stars.
It is the most spectacular light show possible.
And Wall-E has a front row seat.
MONTAGE OF CELESTIAL SPECTACLES
- The ship flies past the MOON.
A BILLBOARD stands next to the abandoned APOLLO MOON ROVER.
"BNL Outlet Coming Soon."
- The ship passes by the SUN.
Wall-E pops open his solar panels.
22.
Instantly recharges.
- The ship cruises alongside SATURN'S OUTER RINGS.
Wall-E runs his hand through the tiny particles of ice.
DISSOLVE TO:
A DUMBBELL NEBULA slowly twists in space.
Wall-E is mesmerized by it.
Leads his eye to a LIGHT, growing in the distance ahead.
A planet?
No. A starliner.
Gigantic in size.
The "AXIOM".
The now tiny recon ship heads straight for it.
THROUGH THE WINDOW we see the Captain.
Glued to his screen.
Filled with ocean images.
44.
SHIP'S COMPUTER
...an expanse of salt water that covers
most of the Earth's surface and surrounds
its land masses...
The CAMERA DRIFTS AWAY from the window...
...Moves aft to the Axiom's stern...
...Pushes in...
The rejects march Wall-E out the entrance.
Their RED "DEFECT" BOOTS all blink.
Activate a WARNING LIGHT above the doorway.
MATCH CUT TO:
The ship jumps to light speed.
BACK INSIDE
The passengers and robots are thrown off their feet.
Everyone holds on to one another.
The cockroach waits obediently on the hill.
Exactly where Wall-E told him to stay.
His antennae twitch with boredom.
89.
A RED DOT
appears on the ground.
The cockroach watches the dot run down the hillside.
The ground begins to shake.
Daylight dims.
The insect looks to the sky.
ON CLOUD COVER
A DARK PATCH grows behind the clouds.
Blots out the sunlight.
The Axiom's keel breaks through.
Its shadow swallows up the entire landscape.
The cockroach senses his master's return.
HUNDREDS OF RED DOTS rush past him.
He eagerly chases after them.
ON AXIOM
The city-size starliner lowers gracefully from the sky.
Pushes back the clouds to the horizon.
The CIRCLE OF DOTS triangulate over the abandoned berth.
Converge over the port's LANDING SHAFT.
Thousands of feet deep.
The ship's keel descends into it.
The earth shudders.
Trash towers tumble in the distance.
...Then all is quiet.
ON BELLY OF THE AXIOM
A ROW OF GIANT DOORS open on the side of the ship.
MULTIPLE GANGWAYS automatically extend.
Connect with BUILT-IN TERMINALS on the port.
The Captain walks out gingerly.
Holding the boot w/ plant.
The other passengers step out on their own legs.
Wobble like toddlers.
They squint up at the harsh sunlight.
A commotion is heard from the back.
Somebody trying to push through.
EVE
appears out of the crowd.
Cradles a BOXED UP WALL-E in her arms.
90.
M-O and the Rejects follow behind her.
They rush across the gangway.
The cockroach meets up with Eve.
Climbs up onto Wall-E.
Doesn't understand why his master isn't responding.
Eve urgently scans the landscape.
Locks on to WALL-E'S TRUCK in the distance.
She takes to the air.
M-O and the Rejects chase after her down the gangway.
M-O
(beeps)
[Eve! Wait!]
The Captain respectfully removes his hat.
Good luck, friend.
Wall-E rolls up to a nearby trash pile.
Scoops up trash. Spits out a cube.
Eve hovers over to him.
Still in disbelief.
EVE
(somber)
No.
Wall-E continues to stack his cubes.
She stops him.
Lifts his head. Stares into his eyes.
Nobody home.
Eve presses his "play" button.
Nothing but STATIC.
Eve begins to panic.
Shakes him.
EVE
Wall-E...Wall-E! WALL-E!
No response.
He's gone.
She hovers in silence next to him for a long time...
Finally, Eve grasps Wall-E's hand.
Forces his fingers to interlace with hers.
Holds him close one last time.
Leans her head against his.
Hums softly.
EVE
[Hums IOTAM]
She touches her forehead to his.
Goodbye Wall-E.
A TINY SPARK between them.
Eve turns to hover away.
Jerked back.
Her fingers caught between his.
She checks his eyes again.
Nothing.
But then...
93.
...a tiny SERVO NOISE.
She looks down at their hands.
CLOSE ON WALL-E'S FINGERS
They start to move.
Slowly close around Eve's.
She looks back at his face.
Wall-E's eyes gradually come into focus.
His brows raise...
WALL-E
Ee-vah?
EVE
Wall-E!
He notices their hands entwined.
His dream come true.
WALL-E
(amazed)
Ee-vah!!
She giggles.
INSIDE THE TRUCK
The "Hello Dolly" tape reaches the finale of IOTAM.
"And that is all that love's about..."
BACK OUTSIDE
Eve and Wall-E stare into each other's eyes.
M-O and the Rejects finally reach the truck.
They begin to celebrate.
Wall-E's alive!
Then M-O realizes they need privacy.
Herds the Rejects O.S.
M-O
Go! Go, go go!
Wall-E and Eve's foreheads touch.
Together now and ever more.
"...and we'll recall when time runs out..."
DISSOLVE TO:
CLOSE UP OF THE PLANT
94.
Newly planted in the earth.
Small hands water it gently.
PULL OUT to reveal it surrounded by kids.
The Captain instructs them.
John and Mary help unload equipment from the Axiom.
Robots and passengers stream off the ship.
CAPTAIN
This is called "farming"! You kids are
going to grow all kinds of plants:
vegetable plants, pizza plants!
(laughs)
Ahh, it's good to be home...
The CAMERA PULLS OUT from the Axiom...
...over the bay...
"...That it only took a moment..."
...past Wall-E & Eve holding hands in his truck...
...over M-O and the Rejects cleaning outside...
...Through the trash towers of the city...
...past a FIELD OF PLANTS, sprouting from its peak...
...up through the cloud cover...
...out into space...
"...To be loved a whole life long."
...and settles on...
...our single...
...drab...
...brown...
...little planet.
IRIS OUT
