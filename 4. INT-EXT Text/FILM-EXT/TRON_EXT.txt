OFF IN THE SYSTEM
Here in a maze of complex pathways, we see a lone tank moving along
one of the paths.
28
28A
The tank makes a quick run through a maze-like path with rounded
corners -- a computer memory microcircuit.
28B
34
We see the turret of the tank swivel around. PULL BACK. In the
distance is an immense block-like robotic bluish black form,
U-shaped, with a small head and a glowing yellow bar for eyes--
a recognizer. It hovers above the ground.
35
LONG SHOT THROUGH THE TANK PERISCOPE
35
A second Reco is coming up behind the first.
36
37
FIRES A VOLLEY at the first Reco. That one falls heavily to the
ground and the tank speeds up, swiveling around to try to fire at
the second Reco, but it moves too fast and can't avoid a gulley.
The tank goes in and is stuck - no traction.
38
CLOSE SHOT - TURRET

Clu standing on it. The Bit zips by him, and they both head away
from the tank, fast.
39
LONG SHOT
39
A glowing static field appears between the two legs of the
Recognizer, and it sweeps over the tank, de-rezzing it. We can
see more tanks approaching over an edge of the landscape.

CLU

running, looking up as the Reco closes in. We see the dead Reco
up ahead, and the streak of the Bit making for it.

ELECTRONIC WORLD - A LITTLE LATER
45
Clu is in electronic energy ring chains, his feet in sockets like
Sark's, but this time the energy from the sockets is deadly,
torturous. Hovering in front of him is the hologram of the MCP.
Beside Clu stands one of the memory guards.
GUARD
Got a pirate program here... says
his name's Clu.
The MPC responds in the manner of a B-movie police sergeant grilling
a suspect.
MCP
What'd he pull?
GUARD
Came into the system with a stolen
password ... an' we caught him
tryin' to raid a high-clearance
memory.
CLU
(looks up, his face
wracked with pain)
No...I must've gotten in there
by mistake, I -
The pain overwhelms him as the energy from the feet sockets
momentarily becomes unbearable.
MCP
Who programmed you?
The guard gives Clu a shove to keep him from losing consciousness.
MCP (CONT.)
You're in trouble, pal...big trouble.
But if you tell us who put you up
to it, you could make it easy on
yourself. Come on, who's your user?
CLU
Forget it, Mister High 'n' Mighty
Master Control ... you're not
makin' me talk.
MCP
Suit yourself ...
The feet sockets really let loose, and Clu SCREAMS in agony, but
doesn't speak. Suddenly his body appears to dissolve into the broken
pattern of a fading television picture and disintegrates into
electric static.
MCP
Get me Dillinger.
CUT TO:

HELICOPTER
We seem at first to be in the Electronic World still, flying over a
vast circuit board lit by countless dots of light. While this is our
impression, and closely after the last dialogue in the preceding
scene, we HEAR the SOUND O.S. of a PHONE RINGING, as heard by the
party placing the call. Then the click of the receiver being picked
up, and a male VOICE (DILLINGER'S) answering:
DILLINGER (O.S.)
Hello?
A SECRETARIAL VOICE (O.S.)
Mr. Dillinger?
DILLINGER'S VOICE (O.S.)
Yes.
A SECRETARIAL VOICE (O.S.)
Hello, please hold a moment for the
Master Control Program
As we fly over the grid, descending, the image comes into clearer
focus, and we realize that this is not a circuit board, but rather
an actual landscape, a suburban grid at twilight. We are
approaching a skyscraper which is yet too far off to distinguish
accurately. As we descend, a thumping, rhythmic noise gradually
increases in volume until it is very loud, and we realize it is the
sound of a HELICOPTER, and we are in the cockpit looking down at the
landscape. We just become aware of this fact when the sound of a
CONVERSATION begins, obviously between the pilot of the 'copter and
a passenger.
47
47
PILOT'S VOICE
will you be around for a while, or
are you going right back out?
DILLINGER'S VOICE
Oh, I'll stick around a few days ...
got some things to take care of.
THE CAMERA PULLS AROUND for a VIEW OF THE HELICOPTER from behind and
off to the side. It is a beautiful, gleaming jet black machine.
In spotless reflective silver paint the letters ICOM are written
across one entire side. It is obviously state-of-the-art technology.

We see Dillinger's face looking out of the window as the helicopter

Lora's van pulls up on a side street, around the corner from ICOM's
main gate. The ICOM building looms high above them, an ominous box.
104
Lora's van pulls to a stop beyond the door at the rear of the ICOM
building, and the three get out. Lora inserts her I.D. card into a
magnetic reader beside the door. Nothing happens.
LORA
I don't think I'm cleared for this.
ALAN
I'm certainly not.
FLYNN
Move aside. Let the kid have some room.
He gestures Alan and Lora out of the way, takes out a small black
box, with several buttons, a -digital counter- with LED numerals
and a small calculator keyboard. He leans over the security lock,
his BACK TO THE CAMERA and PLAYS a couple of notes. There's a
distinct CLICK, an the door starts to swing open ... and open ...
and open. We see that this door is about twenty feet thick. Flynn
starts LAUGHING.
105
140
Ram is standing at the window that divides his cell from Tron's.
RAM
(looking over
his shoulder)
New guy...
TRON
(shakes his head)
Another free program off line.
What's
his User s'posed to do -- ?
RAM
(sighs)
The Users...you really think they're
still there?
TRON
They'd better be...I don't want to bust
outta this dump an' find nothin' but
a lot of cold circuits waitin' for me.
141
FLYNN'S CELL
141
He can hear the VOICES, but can't see anything except Ram's back,
so he goes to the window and tries to reach through.
FLYNN
Hey! Who are you guys?
What's the story around here?
But as his hand reaches the dividing point between the two cells,
it hits an invisible barrier, and we see a brilliant energy field
come instantaneously into existence, stopping his hand, and then
disappearing. Flynn pulls back in shock.
142
RAM
142
turning towards Flynn as he hears this noise.
RAM
You want to watch those force fields...
He goes to the window opening.
RAM (CONT.)
You'll be having plenty of chances to
get hurt, don't worry about that.
FLYNN
Look...just so I can tell my friends
what this dream was about, okay?
Where am I?
RAM
You're a..."guest" of the Master Control
Program. They're going to make you play
video games.
FLYNN
(relieved)
Well, great, that's no sweat -- I play
video games better than anybody.
Ram gives Flynn an astonished look, but before he can say anything,
there's a tremendous POUNDING NOISE, and the door of Flynn's cell
opens.
143
THE CORRIDOR
143
we see guards pulling out other CAPTIVES from their cells, and as
Flynn is led off down the corridor, Tron and Ram are taken in the
opposite direction.
CUT TO:
144
TRAINING ARENA
144
A large area which opens onto the Game Grids from above, with
balconies overlooking the action. Overhead, the aircraft carrier
hovers menacingly, casting a shadow on the programs below. The new
captives are led out onto the ledges, herded by the guards. They
pass some of the Blue Video Warriors, who LAUGH and make fun of
them. Flynn is in the front of the line.
HEAD GUARD
Look operative, you guys. Command
Program Sark will explain the training
procedures.
Sark speaks from the bridge of the carrier, and his voice is
amplified over the grid.
SARK
(reciting a
routine statement)
Greetings. The Master Control Program has
chosen you to serve your system on the
Came Grid.

This will result in your eventual
elimination.

255
Outside the game area, an electronic desert reminiscent of the Grand
Canyon, with giant pillars rising high into the air, lined with
narrow ridges and ledges. The cycles rush around corners of the
ledges, pursued by the tanks, high above the flat surface. They come
around a corner onto a wider ledge with several dark openings in the
face of the cliff. They stop for a moment.

The three cyclists pause at the cave opening, sizing up possible
avenues of escape in the terrain below.
FLYNN
(points)
How about over there...that empty
memory?
TRON
(shakes head)
No good...they might block off the
old chip.
(points)
This way.
The cycles race out of the cave entrance and head down, away from
the approaching tanks, through the electronic canyons, shells
EXPLODING around them. We see the tanks close behind.
267
POV OF A GUN SIGHT

from inside of the tanks, of the three bikes heading into a narrow
arroyo.
268
SHOT OF THE CYCLES
268
They just make it around the corner when an EXPLOSION boasts the
entrance to the arroyo, entering what appears to be a maze of very
narrow canyons with short walls. They turn another corner and come
to the edge of a gaping ravine.
Several hundred feet to their left a narrow bridge connects their
ledge with another canyon wall, and a wider ledge, which leads down
to the floor of the entire area, and on to freedom.
TRON'S VOICE
The bridge! Come on!
The tanks are following through the maze, smooth gray automatons,
lifeless, inexorable nemesis. Tron's cycle is in the lead as all
three race for the bridge, but behind them, we see the first tank
turning the corner.

SHOT OF THE BRIDGE
270
Tron races out on it, Ram and Flynn behind. Just as Tron reaches
the other side and Ram has just started to cross, there's a
tremendous EXPLOSION of electronic FLAK, blasting Ram and tossing
him back on top of Flynn. Both cycles de-rez. The bridge disappears,
and a mass of rubble falls, partially Obscuring Ram and Flynn. Tron
SCREECHES to a halt and swings his bike back around.
He looks around -- Ram and Flynn are nowhere in sight. in the ravine
below, he SEES a pile of motionless rubble.
The tank fires again, narrowly missing Tron, and he REVS up again,
speeds off down the ramp, and is gone.

SARK

in the carrier above. He is watching the action on the wall screen
behind his console, back to the camera. The picture is coming from
the lead tank. To him, it appears as though Ram and Flynn had been
blown up, since no sign of them is visible. We can see his
lieutenant nearby, operating the communications.
SARK
(to lieutenant)
Make contact with master Control...
(smiles)
he'll be pleased to hear we're all
finished with that User he sent us.
276

speeding through the flat, desert-like terrain, heading straight for
the cityscape tower in the distance.

Far behind him, we see the image of Sark's carrier ponderously
moving in his direction.
CUT TO:
278
FLYNN AND RAM
278
Flynn is supporting Ram, half carrying him, and it is
getting darker.
FLYNN
You gonna make it?
Ram weakly nods, but doesn't look very convincing. Flynn bites his
lip and struggles on. They are down on the floor of the desert,
leaving the towering canyons behind. A large, dim shape can be made
out. Flynn peers at it hopefully and struggles towards it.
CUT TO:
279
FLYNN

Exhausted, Flynn lets Ram down to the ground, goes to the opening
and looks in. Looks okay, so he comes back.

anyway, and Flynn's eyes soon closed.
FADE TO BLACK:

FADE UP FROM BLACK
281
Some light comes in the opening, and we see Flynn lying on a
platform across from Ram. Ram's glow appears to be almost gone.
Flynn's eyes open. For a second he doesn't know where he is, but
then he spots Ram, and comes fully awake. Ram is watching him. Flynn
looks around. He gets up and stretches, his hand reaching up towards
the ceiling. It brushes against one panel and suddenly the energy
glow from his body seems to leap from his hand to the panel, leaving
it with a glow of its own. The entire chamber starts to shake and
RUMBLE.
FLYNN
(holding onto
the wall)
What's goin' on?
RAM
(looking around, weak)
We're inside a Recognizer...
(to Flynn)
You are crazy -- stealing a Recognizer --
FLYNN
(stumbling, trying to
keep his balance)
Are you kidding? I think it's stealing us -
Flynn tentatively places his-hands on separate parts of the
instruments. An energy flow starts, and with a mighty heave and
shudder, the chamber they're in turns over, knocking both Flynn and
Ram to one side. The Recognizer is now in its standard upright
position.
CUT TO:
282
282
as it stands up, covered with a static overlay, partially de-rezzed.
283
286
He hides behind a building as the Reco passes. A strange, zombie-like
figure comes down one of the streets, and the Recognizer swoops over
it, the static field flashing between the legs, passing through the
figure, dissolving it.
287
CLOSE UP TRON'S FACE
287
Very grim. He looks out onto the street and sees two more of the
figures, standing together, staring at each other, barely moving.
Dead, lifeless, but animate. Tron comes out on the street, staring
at these figures. He locks around the city in confusion, shaking his
head sadly, but walks on.
288
TRON TURNS A CORNER

Up ahead we see a large, multi-storied factory-like building.
289
CLOSE UP - TRON IS FACE

CUT TO:
324
325
A group of low resolution programs are walking by. Flynn emerges
from the broken-off head, stunned, but unhurt, the Bit flying by
his side. He blearily sees the passing programs, but doesn't realize
they are at such a low state of consciousness that they can't see
him.
FLYNN
Hey. Hi. Hey, everything's okay. Fine.
Little trouble, but we're okay. Thanks
for your concern. So long.
They move on.
FLYNN
(to the Bit)
This town's full o' live ones.
BIT
Not a chance.
328
328
Tron and Yori are crossing an open plaza-like area, on their way to
the I/0 Tower. They pass by more zombie-like programs and overhear
bits of conversation, all in dead-sounding monotones.
PROGRAMS
I have to re-route the insurance
information bits... Next cycle we
start the war game simulation for

Certainly... the MCP wants only
minimal functions left in Sector 84Q.

on a long curving walkway which encircles the base of the Tower,
approaching a wide door in the wall.
331
INSIDE THIS DOOR'

We see that it opens onto a wide elevator platform, which is now
rising upwards at a steep angle, carrying Tron and Yori smoothly
and silently towards an opening in a floor a hundred feet overhead.
332
SHOT FROM BELOW THEM

looking upwards as they move.
333
THE UPPER FLOOR
333
as the elevator platform arrives, and they step off. We get the
sense of massive, over-size ceilings, floors, windows and machinery,
dwarfing the programs who come to the Tower to communicate,
preparing them for the experience, as a vaulting cathedral prepared
the sinner for confession. But here, everything is composed of clean,
sharp, angular surfaces.
On this second story there is floor and
ceiling, but no outer wall, so we can still see the city-grid below
and beyond.
Tron and Yori cautiously move forward across the floor, heading for
a door into the inner parts of the Tower.
334-349 OMIT
334-349
350
THE CENTRAL CHAMBER
350
of the I/0 Tower. A large, raised circular altar stands against one
wall, with a darkened opening behind it. A square, secondary altar
supports the first, about fifty feet up a side.
In the middle of the altar we see a structure of stacked, diminishing
steps, the final one forming the shoulders of an armless, padded
suit with a puffed headdress revealing the face of the I/0 Tower
priest, DUMONT. His eyes are shut. His face is lined with age, but
still holds a sprightly sensitivity. It is the face of Dr. Gibbs,
from the laser lab in the Real world. There is a large, V-shaped
opening behind the altar, and the circular steps glow a hot neon,
each a different color. The stripes of color thus formed bleed
upwards onto the wall, lining either side of the V opening. There is
only blackness beyond.
351

Dumont... ?
The priest's eyes flicker open. He looks at Tron and Yori, doesn't
recognize either one.
DUMONT
Yes?
TRON
(nervous)
I... have come to communicate with
my User.
DUMONT
Hmm. A difficult proposition...
difficult proposition at best.
(indicates empty chamber)
Perhaps you've noticed... we're not
exactly packing them in these days ...
YORI
Yes...what--?
DUMONT
You know, not so long ago, you
could've come in here and seen
programs lined up all the way back
to those doors, waiting for communion
with their Users. The building fund
was doing well too...but now...
(sighs)
...this so-called Master Control
Program is going around cutting
programs off from their natural
creators, grabbing all our believers
and making them ride around on little
motor scooters and shoot things at
each other and Weiner knows what all--
oh, it's enough to give you a crisis
of faith...
TRON
Well I want to communicate --
DUMONT
Oh, you want to -- hah. I could
get myself de-rezzed just-for letting
you in here. They hate this tower.
They'd close it down if they dared
to but they keep me around, in case
one of them wants to deal with the
other world once in a while. And
you should hear the way they commune!
Sounds like they were routing a
payroll, for all the heart they put
in it. No, I don't think you
Tron steps closer, speaks quietly to Dumont.
TRON
Dumont... my User has information
that could -- could make this a
free system again.
DUMONT
Hah.
TRON
Really. You'd have programs lined
up around the block to use this
place -- and no MCP looking over your
shoulder.
DUMONT
(sighs)
When you've been in the system as long
as I have, you hear many promises...
many reassurances...many brave plans...
He pauses, sizing Tron up, considering it. Finally:
DUMONT (CONT.)
(falling into ritual)
Who is your User, program?
TRON
Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass?
DUMONT
All that is visible must grow beyond
itself and extend into the realm of
the invisible.
Dumont nods, and the neon glow fades a little.
DUMONT
You may pass, my friend.
Tron runs lightly up the steps, past Dumont, into the darkness
beyond.

FLYNN
This is where Tron said he was going...
Below him, at waist level, also peeking around the corner, we see
the glow of the Bit. Flynn moves out from the wall and starts going
down the hall, Bit following.
FLYNN (CONT.)
Looks like his kind of place, too...

We can see Sark's men marching on away from us, and Flynn leaning
over the warrior with the Bit hovering over him. As we watch, Flynn
places both his hands on the Blue Warrior's chest. Quickly, the blue
static pattern covering the guard flows into Flynn's hands up his
arms, and transfers entirely to him and the warrior derezzes.

TRON

Beating back the guards, tossing them over the side of the walkway.
We see one last guard standing on top of the bunker that forms the
connection of the craft to the sail. Tron advances on him... the
guard stares at him, then looks down... then jumps off, intimidated.
There's a sudden lurch forward, and Tron is thrown back, losing
his balance.

YORI
We're off!

The transmission beam is flowing, passing directly through the craft,

it looks like a headlight. The Sailer starts moving, fast,
accelerating so that it reaches a tremendous velocity in a matter of
seconds.

Back on the bridge of the carrier, Sark is in the MCP hologram. In
front of him, we see a view of the city below, and the hangar, and
the Solar Sailer -- racing away.
MCP
I hope you've enjoyed being a command
program, Sark. I wonder how you'll like
working in a pocket calculator... maybe
one of those watches that plays "Happy
Birthday" to its User once a year.
SARK
Now, sir... We did take care of that
User you sent us --
MCP
Yes, and now you've got two renegade
programs running all the hell over the
system in a stolen simulation.

User.
Tron and Yori are stunned and awed.
YORI

FLYNN

TRON
But -- if you're a User -- then
everything you've done has been
part of a plan ...
FLYNN

You wish. Man, I haven't had a second
to think since I got down here. I mean
in here. Out here. Whatever.
TRON

FLYNN
Look, you guys know how it is. You just
keep doin' what it looks like you're
supposed to, even if it seems crazy, and
you hope to hell your User knows what's
goin' on.

POV OF THE DOOMED PROGRAMS

As the first one gets through the opening. The light from the MCP's
beam pours out. Moving forward, through the entrance, the MCP is
finally revealed. A giant cylinder, a hundred feet high, with a
network of circuit lines, and stretched across all the visible
surface... is a face. Flattened, stretched, bizarrely distorted,
the face is capable of moving to any section of the-cylinder. The
impression is similar to the look of a grotesquely fat person's face,
but more so. It's horrible. Beneath the floating cylinder face two
inverted cones of light, meeting at their apex, support it. We
continue moving forward, the MCP looming over us. Then the CAMERA
STOPS and the doomed programs file past us, separating and going to
the inner walls. The MCP speaks, we see his enormous lips moving.

throwing again at the MCP, hitting, catching his disk again.
MCP
(thundering)
SARK!!!

SARK

His body is glowing, expanding. He starts to rise, his face looks up.
606
CLOSE UP - FACE
606
It is vacant, staring with white eyes. His head still has the gaping
hole in the forehead. He's a zombie, the living dead. He rises.
607
LONG SHOT
607
Carrier floating over the CPU, near the MCP's beam. Flynn looks out,
from side to side, quickly assessing the possibilities. He spots the
beam.

SHOT OF YORI AND FLYNN

FLYNN
Yori, steer us over the beam,
right next to it.
YORI
(going to controls)
Why? What are you going to do?
FLYNN
(staring down)
Jump.
Yori looks up.
YORI
But... won't you be de-rezzed?
FLYNN
(turns to her)
Probably.

628
Leading Dumont out of the chamber with several of the other guardian
programs that were saved. He looks up, spots the carrier descending.
629
SHOT OF CARRIER
629
Basically all that is left of it is the bridge, with only a very
faint image of the rest of the body. It lands on the mesa.

Tron catches Yori as she jumps down. He hugs her close and looks at
her, about to speak. But she reaches up and presses her lips to his
in a quick, intense kiss. Then pulls back.
TRON
(laughing)
Nice...
YORI
It's something Users do.
TRON
Where's Flynn?
He looks up at the bridge.
YORI
He's gone. He went into the beam.
He saved you. He saved all of us.
Tron stares at her, holding onto her shoulders. Then he looks up at
the sky, thoughtfully. She also looks up.
DUMONT
He really was a User...
BIT
(quietly, sadly)
Yes...

LONG SHOT FROM OVERHEAD

of the landscape, glowing again with new life, every I/O Tower a
shining beacon, a symbol of the new found freedom of communication.

and returning to the real world.

THE REAL WORLD - LASER LAB
633
CLOSE on the business end of the huge laser in ICOM's lab. A bright
blast of LIGHT shoots out of the mechanism.
WIDEN TO REVEAL the laser pouring its light onto the floor, near the
chair where Flynn was sitting when he was digitized.
Slowly -- in a reverse of his disappearance -- Flynn's BODY takes
shape on the floor. As the laser shuts off, he is revealed intact --
back in his real-world body and clothes... and as bewildered to find
himself here as he was when he first arrived in the electronic world.
He studies his hands -- and SEES that they're now nonluminescent
flesh and blood.
He looks out the window and SEES that it's shortly past dawn, with
weak sunlight coming in.
And, at the SOUND of light MACHINERY at work, he turns to look at
Lora's computer terminal, where a hard-copy computer PRINTER is
coughing out a long document on wide blue paper.
Flynn gets up off the floor, goes over to the printer, and READS the
document. As he does so, his eyes widen, and a SMILE appears on his
face.
The printer finishes its run, clicks patiently. Flynn, exuberant,
tears the printout from the machine and rushes to the door with it.
