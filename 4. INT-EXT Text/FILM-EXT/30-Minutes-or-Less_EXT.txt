An '89 Mustang bursts like a shot over a rise in the highway.
It's got a rusted two-tone paint job, Maryland plates, and
bald tires that scream as it peels off an exit and into the
The car fast approaches a stop sign, dangerously blows through
the intersection.
The Mustang fishtails around a corner and skids away.
CUT TO:
TIRES SCREECH
Brake pads smoke. The Mustang stops outside
The Driver jumps out of the car. As he rushes to the front
door, we see the urgent package he is delivering.
TWO LARGE PIZZAS
Before he can ring the bell, the door opens and two smug 15-
YEAR-OLDS stare out.
15-YEAR-OLD
That's 34 minutes. You're 4 minutes
late. Pizza's free.
REVEAL our guy staring back at the kids. This is WILL (25),
probably good looking in another life.
2.
Right now, he is tired and unamused, wearing a red "Giorgio's
Trattoria" hat and a sweaty matching t-shirt.
WILL
Gimme a break. You guys live two
towns away. It's pretty much fucking
impossible to get here in 30 minutes.
OTHER 15-YEAR-OLD
Exactly. That's why we ordered from
your shitty "trattoria."
WILL
This is gonna come out of my paycheck.
You sure you don't want to take the
moral high ground?
OTHER 15-YEAR-OLD
We'd rather take the pizzas.
Will takes a calming breath. Hands over the pizzas.
WILL
Ok. You guys are pretty smart. You
figured out a way to beat the system.
(PEEKS INSIDE)
Got the house to yourselves?
15-YEAR-OLD
That's right.
WILL
Not bad. Any jailbait in there?
Little pizza and a rainbow party?
The kids shakes their heads.
WILL
Seriously? Well, two hustlers like
yourselves gotta have the place
stocked with beer and whippits and
shit, right? Just call the girls up
and let them know the party's on.
15-YEAR-OLD
Man, we don't have any of that stuff.
Will makes a show of mulling this over.
WILL
I really shouldn't do this...but you
seem like a couple of good dudes.
I'll tell you what, you give me the
money that your mom left you for the
pizzas, and I'll grab you some beers.
(MORE)
3.
WILL (CONT'D)
(BEAT)
But I get to keep the change as a
tip. Deal?
The kids look at each other. One hesitantly pulls out some
cash. Will snatches it and heads off.
WILL
I'll see you in like 20 minutes.
The kids look uncertain. As if sensing this, Will stops
before getting into his ride.
WILL
You boys like Budweiser, right?
15-YEAR-OLD
Uh, yeah, totally.
OTHER 15-YEAR-OLD
Love that shit!
Will sits on the darkened front stoop. He tosses an empty
can into the bushes and gets to work on his fourth beer.
He looks over at a parked Hyundai Elantra. A YOUNG MAN sits
in the passenger seat with a pensive look on his face. He
makes a sudden, surprised gasp. The homely YOUNG WOMAN who
was just blowing him sits up from his lap and rearranges
herself in the driver seat. She leans over for a goodbye
kiss. The Young Man obliges with much fanfare.
The Young Man gets out and the car pulls away. This is CHET
(25), a clean cut guy dressed in the Gap Premium Collection.
He heads toward the building, high off his BJ, humming
Outkast's "Ms. Jackson." He stops when he notices Will in
the shadows.
CHET
What the hell? Have you just been
sitting there?
WILL
Yep. Caught the whole show. Really
classy move at the end. You know,
the kiss. Putting your tongue in
her mouth right after you fucked it.
CHET
Hey, a nice girl decides to pleasure
me on a weeknight, in her car no
less...I'm not gonna make her feel
like an untouchable. I'm gonna make
her feel like a lady.
WILL
What manners. May I offer you some
alcohol, sir. To wash the taste of
yourself out of your mouth.
Will offers his beer. Chet takes a slug, gurgles for effect.
CHET
By the way, she said she had a friend.
Maybe we can go on our first double
date since you tried to talk Jackie
Fortunato and her cousin into having
a four-way with us.
WILL
I misread their body language. It
happens.
6.
Will picks up some rented movies sitting beside him.
WILL
Come on. Let's go inside, drink
your beer and watch shit get crazy.
(FANS MOVIES)
Old favorites. You choose. Lethal
Weapon, Lethal Weapon 2...was gonna
get the third Lethal Weapon, but
decided on a porn. So it's really
between the first two.
CHET
I choose sleep. I gotta teach a
class at eight.
WILL
You're a sub. Just call in sick.
Like the real teacher did.
CHET
Come on, man, you know I got promoted
to full-time last month. You bought
me a laser pointer.
Will heaves a sigh.
WILL
Yeah, I know. I guess I'm just having
a hard time accepting you as "the
man." You know, flunking kids, giving
out spite detentions to girls you
wanna fuck, laser pointing at shit.
CHET
I also get healthcare and my summers
off. It's not perfect, but it's a
career.
Will grudgingly stands up.
WILL
I guess that's just the difference
between you and me.
He holds up the Lethal Weapon DVDs.
WILL
I'm like Riggs. Cruising the streets.
No rules, no attachments. Every
other day some asshole is trying to
take my badge. You're fucking
Murtaugh. Always worried about your
pension. Well, guess what, it gets
old after the first movie.
7.
CHET
I just got head. I'm totally Riggs.
Will shakes his head, turns and walks off.
A watermelon explodes in a shower of red, juicy bits. Loud,
dumb laughter echoes.
Standing 20 yards away is DWAYNE (32), an intense, meaty guy
in a sleeveless Baltimore Ravens t-shirt. On his left bicep
is a tattoo of the Tasmanian Devil flipping the bird.
DWAYNE
Fruit motherfuckin' salad!
8.
Crouched beside him is JAY (27), tall and awkward, in a wool
surplus cap. He carefully rigs homemade explosives to another
watermelon, then looks up at Dwayne. His eyes are magnified
into saucers by his thick glasses. There's a peculiar
eagerness to please in them.
JAY
This one's gonna blow even bigger.
DWAYNE
Boy, if you weren't such a skinny
little bitch you coulda been in the
military or something.
JAY
Whatever. I don't need the military.
I taught myself how to do this shit.
DWAYNE
I hear that. I taught myself how to
eat pussy. And cut my own hair.
Jay jogs the watermelon a safe distance away. He returns
and pulls out a detonator. Dwayne snatches it.
DWAYNE
This one's all me.
(makes "radio" sounds)
Mr. President, we have enemies at
the gate. Give me the order.
(more "radio" sounds)
Fuck that, sir. I don't negotiate
with terrorists!
Dwayne presses a button and
BOOM!
The explosion is so powerful that it sprinkles our guys'
smiling faces with fruit juice.
Dwayne and Jay head out, passing a brand new pickup truck in
the driveway. Dwayne spits on it.
DWAYNE
Fuck The Major!
The guys get in a shitty Ford Aerostar minivan and peel out.
11.
Will screeches away in his car.
Will's Mustang travels down a dark, empty stretch of highway.
The lone working taillight fades as the car disappears into
the distance.
The Mustang stops at the mouth of a driveway. Overgrown
shrubbery blocks anything beyond it from view. All that
Will can see is a red and white radio tower jutting into the
sky, beacon light flashing atop it.
Will checks the address, then drives through the open gate.
The Mustang parks at the end of the driveway. Will gets out.
There is a large storage shed and, across a clearing, a radio
tower built on top of a small office structure.
27.
The office door is ajar. Florescent light glows from inside.
WILL
Hello?
DWAYNE (O.S.)
(calling back from beyond door)
Hey, bud! Sorry for the hike! The
county's got us doing repairs at the
ass end of the night!
This puts Will at ease. He heads toward the office. As he
gets close, a figure appears in the doorway. It is Dwayne
WEARING A SCARY FUCKING GORILLA MASK
WILL
What the -
Will hears something behind him and whirls around -
To find Jay, also in a gorilla mask, charging at him.
WILL
Holy fuck!
Will makes a run for it. But the guys are on top of him in
no time. He madly fights them off and dashes for his car.
DWAYNE
Stop! We got a gun, you asshole!
Will breaks toward the cover of the shrubbery.
DWAYNE
Fuck! Get him!
Jay is right on Will's tail. Without breaking stride, Jay
picks up a large branch and wings it at him.
Will is hit in the legs and stumbles over himself. Jay leaps
on top of him and locks his skinny legs around Will's body.
WILL
What the hell!?
(at a loss)
Rape!
Jay wrestles something from his pocket. A chloroform soaked
rag. He presses it hard against Will's mouth and nose.
Will soon goes limp.
Dwayne appears, looming above them. He pulls his gorilla
mask back and smiles.
28.
DWAYNE
Step one.
CUT TO:
Blurry vision coming into focus. Two gorillas.
Whereas the masks looked scary at night, they look ridiculous
now. Will is propped up on the hood of his car, staring at
his captors. His mouth is duct taped, hands bound behind his
back. He wears his "Giorgio's" cap and a buttoned up olive
green Army jacket.
DWAYNE
You thought we were gonna rape you.
(CHUCKLES)
Idiot.
Will mumbles something through the duct tape.
DWAYNE
Just shut up. The tape is there for
a reason. 'Cause this next part is
gonna take a measure of calm. Are
you with me? Can you be calm?
Will nods. Dwayne holds up his driver license.
DWAYNE
Will Dixon, of 112 North Whatever-
The-Fuck Street, right now you are
wearing an explosive vest.
Will looks down at the jacket he is wearing, tries to get
his hands loose so he can tear it open.
DWAYNE
Calm the fuck down!
Will stiffens. For emphasis, Dwayne reveals the gun tucked
down the front of his pants like a big metal cock.
DWAYNE
Now stay still and my associate will
show you.
Jay carefully unbuttons the Army jacket. Will is, in fact,
wearing an explosive vest. It is a cobbled together but
intimidating looking contraption, crisscrossed by multicolored
wires. There is a thick lock at the hinge, with a digital
display and a keypad.
Will begins to hyperventilate.
29.
JAY
Take it easy, man. You're fine. I
built this thing. It's pretty stable.
DWAYNE
For a fucking bomb. So don't trip
over your shoelaces or anything.
That thing's full of C-4. And the C
is for chaos.
JAY
Actually, the C stands for "composite."
But, yeah, I'd try not to slam into
stuff.
DWAYNE
Can I take that tape off now, pizza boy?
Will nods. Dwayne rips the duct tape off his mouth.
WILL
Help!
Dwayne chuckles.
DWAYNE
You know where you are? You might
as well be in space, motherfucker.
Nobody can hear you scream.
WILL
Why are you doing this to me? I
don't have any money.
DWAYNE
Not yet. But you're gonna go get us
some.
WILL
Okay. Sure, man. Whatever you say.
I'll go sell my car. I'll get you
like a thousand bucks.
DWAYNE
I want 100 thousand.
WILL
Where the fuck am I supposed to get
that much money?
DWAYNE
The Donner-Wells National Bank on
Charles Road.
30.
JAY
Across the street from the Olive
Garden.
DWAYNE
Yeah, the one across the street from
the Olive Garden.
WILL
Do you guys have an account or
something?
Dwayne shakes his head like Will is an idiot.
DWAYNE
No, I don't have an account! You're
gonna rob it!
WILL
How the fuck am I supposed to rob a
bank?
DWAYNE
Figure it out. You got a bomb strapped
to your chest. That's a start. It'll
scare the fuck outta people. Maybe
use your brain and go get a gun.
Borrow one from a friend for all I
care. It ain't rocket science.
WILL
Then do it yourself.
DWAYNE
I would, but I'm already wearing
this gorilla mask and you're already
wearing that bomb.
(TO JAY)
Tell him about the vest.
Jay turns to Will.
JAY
You seem like a pretty trustworthy
guy. I mean, you got a job and all.
But just in case you were gonna try
to take the vest off, we booby trapped
it to shit. There's also a remote
detonator on the back, so we can
trigger it by dialing a number.
DWAYNE
And it's on speed dial. So do what
you gotta do, but we'll be watching.
(MORE)
31.
DWAYNE (CONT'D)
You go anywhere near a police station,
and Fourth of July comes early this
year.
Dwayne nods at the timer on the side of the vest.
DWAYNE
It's 9:00 AM. You got 8 hours.
He hands Will a slip of paper.
DWAYNE
Once you have the money, call this
number and you'll be given instructions
on where to drop it. You do good, we
give you the six-digit combination
that stops the timer and opens the
lock. Tomorrow morning, you can go
back to delivering pizza, the mail,
whatever the fuck you want.
(BEAT)
Now let me demonstrate what happens
if you don't get us the money.
Dwayne looks over to where an oversized stuffed bear, rigged
with its own bomb vest, sits on a tree stump 20 yards away.
Dwayne mimes answering a phone -
DWAYNE
Hey, Teddy Ruxpin...what's that?
You don't have the money? It was
too tough to rob the bank, so you
just went back to your bear cave and
cried like a bitch? Well, guess
what my stuffed friend...time is up.
Jay pushes a button on a detonator. Teddy Ruxpin explodes.
All that remains is a cloud of stuffing.
Will is frozen in fear.
DWAYNE
I liked that bear. I don't even
know you.
Dwayne throws Will his car keys.
DWAYNE
Go on. Get outta here.
WILL
Guys, can we please just talk about
this?
32.
DWAYNE
Yeah, of course we can.
Dwayne pulls out the gun and fires two shots at Will's feet.
Jay jumps backward, as does Will, who hits the hood of his
car, slides across it and onto the ground by the driver side.
DWAYNE
Be careful!
Will awkwardly gets to his feet and arranges himself in the
car, adjusting to the weight of the bomb. As he starts the
engine and backs away -
DWAYNE
That's right! Get the fuck out of
here! You're wasting time!
Once the car is gone, Jay yanks off his gorilla mask. Dwayne
stays primate.
JAY
What the hell, Dwayne? You told me
that was a replica gun.
DWAYNE
It was. Then I paid a Mexican 50
bucks to put a firing pin in it.
Now it goes boom.
JAY
We didn't discuss a loaded gun!
Especially not with the bomb around!
Dwayne gets right in Jay's face. The plastic eyes of his
mask betray no emotion.
DWAYNE
Don't you ever question me. I'm
fucking this bitch. You're just
holding the camera.
JAY
(VOICE FALTERS)
Sure, Dwayne...whatever you say.
DWAYNE
Good. 'Cause this ain't the Marines.
This is cash money. You hesitate, you
fuck up...and I will leave you behind.
A tense beat. Dwayne pulls his mask off. He looks oddly calm.
DWAYNE
Let's go get some breakfast.
33.
Will's car flies down the road. It screeches to a stop,
tires smoking. Will jumps out, stumbles to the shoulder and
pukes. He drops to his knees.
WILL
Oh, god! Holy shit! Fuck me!
Someone please fucking help me!
Nothing but the wind.
Will fights back tears. He gets to his feet, wipes his mouth.
He takes out his cell phone, scrolls through the contacts.
He pauses on Chet's name...presses send.
The line goes to voicemail. Will looks at the bomb's timer:
7 hours, 47 minutes and counting. He hurries to his car.
The guys get to Will's car. Chet wraps up a call on his cell -
CHET
...thanks so much, Mrs. Davis. I'll
call you after I talk to the doctor.
Chet hangs up. He is standing by the passenger door. He
looks over the roof of the car at Will.
CHET
So, this is it?
WILL
This is what?
39.
CHET
Once I step inside this car, I'm
basically in a steel coffin with you
and...that thing. And if it goes
off, all they're gonna find in there
are two charred bodies and pieces of
a bomb. They'll assume we were driving
to a government building to blow it
up. It'll be all over the news.
Next thing you now, some militia or
Islam group is claiming us as members.
My family will be humiliated.
WILL
We'll also be dead, in that particular
situation, so it won't really matter.
CHET
Exactly!
Will sighs.
WILL
I get it. Take your time, man.
Will gets in the car and shuts the door. He looks out at
Chet, who stands uncertainly by the passenger side.
CHET
This is the world's biggest favor,
you motherfucker. You didn't even
help me move last winter.
Chet reluctantly hops in.
Where Juicy waits by the service entrance, smoking a
cigarette. She spots the car and runs over. It parks and
the door opens. A glassy-eyed African-American man (30s)
steps out. His muscled body is covered in calligraphic prison
ink. This is VAUGHN.
46.
Juicy throws her arms around him.
JUICY
I missed you so much, baby.
VAUGHN
You don't got enough dicks to keep
you warm in that place?
JUICY
You know it's not like that. Those
guys get Juicy, but you get Marisol.
VAUGHN
Well, Marisol...what I want is to
get my money, kill that old ass man,
then get the fuck out of here.
JUICY
Then that's how it's gonna go. We're
just waiting on a call.
Vaughn stares at her.
VAUGHN
This is my impatient face.
JUICY
Well, I think I can keep you
entertained.
Juicy gets in the open driver side door and makes a show of
crawling over into the passenger seat.
Will keeps watch of the house. Chet squeezes through a garage
window he has pried open.
The car peels away.
The Datsun pulls around and parks in back.
PULL BACK TO REVEAL the minivan parking across the street.
You can see the entire shitty town from up here. The access
door opens and Kate emerges, wind tousling her short hair.
KATE
(CALLING OUT)
Will?
Will waves at her from where he is standing, way across on
the other side of the roof. Kate starts toward him.
WILL
Stop!
Will takes out his cell phone and dials. Kate's phone rings.
She answers it, confused.
KATE
What are you doing?
We STAY on Will. We can see Kate, standing 30 feet away,
but her voice comes over Will's cell phone, with a delay
that is slightly jarring.
WILL
Just don't come any closer.
KATE
Why not? What's going on?
WILL
I'm gonna give you the short version
of an incredibly complicated and fucked
up situation, so please be cool.
(BEAT)
Some very bad guys strapped a bomb
to my chest and they are forcing me
to commit a crime.
KATE
Will, I swear, if this is -
WILL
I wish I was joking, but I'm not. I
know it's a lot to swallow, but you
gotta take it on face value, because
there's a timer attached to this
thing and it's counting down.
Kate's voice falters -
KATE
Oh my god, Will...we'll get help.
I'll get you help.
59.
WILL
I didn't come here for help. I'm
taking care of it. I came here
because, should things not work out
today as I would like them to, I
want you to know why I was doing the
things I did.
KATE
Please, just let me call someone.
Let me do something. This is crazy!
WILL
I don't disagree with you. It's
fucking nuts. But that's not even
what this is about.
(STRUGGLING)
Do you remember when you found that
picture in my car of you, me and
Chet, with Chet cut out of it?
KATE
Will, I can't remember about some
stupid picture while you're -
WILL
I need you to remember about the
picture, and about how I stop by
your office every Friday, and how
I've always hated all your boyfriends,
and how the two girls I've ever
seriously dated have looked like
less attractive versions of you.
(BEAT)
Do you see where I'm going with this?
I love you Kate. I have for a very
long time.
Kate is barely holding it together.
KATE
Will, this is a lot you're putting
on me! You just told me people are
trying to kill you or something, and
now you say you love me. What the
fuck is going on?
WILL
A whole lot of shit. I'm sorry to do
this to you, but I was afraid I'd never
get the chance to tell you. And I
know you have feelings for me, too.
Maybe you feel for me the way you feel
for a good friend, or - if the world
fucking hates me - a brother.
(MORE)
60.
WILL (CONT'D)
But what I hope is that you don't really
know how you feel for me, and that
maybe when you figure it out you'll
realize it's the same way I feel for
you. Does that make any sense?
KATE
Yes. I mean, I've known you forever.
It's not an easy thing to figure out.
WILL
I don't need an answer now. Just
think about it. And no matter what
you decide, you're too good for
assholes like Mark and the rest of
them.
Kate manages a small, stifled laugh.
KATE
Okay. I will process all of this.
It's just, the bomb -
WILL
It's distracting. I know. Anyway,
I'd love to stay and talk some more,
but I can't. I gotta ask you to leave
now, because I'm running out of time.
Kate nods. Will hangs up the phone. She turns back toward
the access door, stops. She yells across the roof at Will -
KATE
If I had time to think about it...I'd
probably tell you that I've always
felt very strongly for you. And I've
never thought of you as a brother.
Will smiles, yells back -
WILL
That's a huge relief. Don't say
anything else. I just really don't
want to die now.
KATE
Try not to. Please.
Kate turns and continues to the access door.
61.
The Datsun is parked in the half-full lot. The guys lean
against the driver side, with their backs to the bank and
the car providing cover. They each have a spray painted air
pistol tucked into their pants.
WILL
You go for the money. I'll cover
the crowd. In and out.
Chet clasps his hands around his stomach.
CHET
I'm not feeling so good. I drank
like three of those 5-Hour Energy
drinks.
WILL
It's just nerves. Let's pull our
shit together and do this thing.
Chet reigns it in. The guys slide on the leather gloves and
rolled up ski masks. They turn and stride toward the bank.
The guys stop as they get to the door. They pull the ski
masks down and take out their air pistols.
63.
CHET
What should I call you in there,
like if I need to ask you to do
something?
WILL
Call me Tivon. You'll be Darius.
CHET
I can tell you're not a black guy
through the ski mask.
WILL
Fine. Then you'll be Luis and I'm
Cruz. We're two loco motherfuckers
and that's the way we gotta roll
when we get in there.
Just as a lone police cruiser screeches into the lot. Will
and Chet make a run for it, but the cruiser cuts them off.
OFFICER ZURMAN (21), a jittery rookie, jumps out of the cruiser
and levels his gun. The guys reflexively level theirs.
OFFICER ZURMAN
Drop your weapons!
CHET
Don't shoot us!
OFFICER ZURMAN
Drop the guns or I'll have to!
Chet looks at Will with utter desperation. In the distance,
they hear the sirens of more cops approaching. Will tosses
his gun, rips open his jacket and grabs a cluster of wires.
WILL
Fuck you! You just brought a gun to
a bomb fight, officer! I pull these
wires out and we all go! You got
ten seconds to drop your gun and -
Zurman doesn't stick around for the rest. He turns and
sprints away.
69.
As the guys make for the Datsun -
CHET
That was awesome.
WILL
He was tempting a desperate
motherfucker.
The guys jump in the Datsun and peel out as two more police
cruisers race toward the bank. The cruisers change course
and give chase. The Datsun blows right by the parked
Whiplash blur as the three cars race by, one after the other.
Airborne leaves flutter in their wake.
Chet freaks out as they hurtle toward lunchtime traffic.
Will weaves in and out of cars.
CHET
Shit! This is not cool!
Will is wild eyed, punching the gas. Chet's head is on a
swivel. Behind them: police cruisers in hot pursuit. Up ahead:
the world rushing at them at 80 mph, populated by nothing but
potential collisions that will result in a fiery death.
70.
CHET
Maybe we should pull over and
surrender.
WILL
I can outrun these guys. They're
not the FBI, they're local cops.
Just shut up and let me concentrate.
I do this for a living.
As they clip the side-view mirror off a Kia -
CHET
You don't do anything like this for a
living! I am not a pizza, I am a man!
The cruisers are gaining ground, throttles wide open.
Will downshifts, spiking the RPMs into the red, as he banks
a hard right and
The Datsun explodes onto a crowded street. PEDESTRIANS
crossing an intersection jump out of its way.
The cruisers take the turn into town. One makes it. The
other slams into parked cars.
Will jumps the curb to avoid slow-moving traffic, slams into a
newspaper dispenser. It flips up onto the hood and crashes
into the windshield, where it stays lodged.
WILL
Holy fuck!
Will veers back into the street and blindly plows ahead as
cars he cannot see swerve to avoid him.
He finally slams the brakes, the momentum knocking the
dispenser loose and launching it onto the sidewalk, scattering
Pedestrians.
Chet whirls around to see the cruiser flying right at them.
CHET
Go! Go! Go!
Will steps on the gas. The light ahead turns red.
CHET
Stop! Stop! Stop!
71.
Will rolls the dice and blows through the intersection.
He's lucky. The cruiser behind him is not. It's T-boned by
traffic in a brutal, crunching collision.
The cruiser wreckage disappears in the rear-view mirror as
Will floors it toward a green light.
WILL
That guy got fucked up.
In the rushing moment as they cross the intersection, Chet
glimpses the other cruiser barreling toward his side of the
car from the perpendicular street. He has a millisecond,
maybe, to process their impending doom, and then -
The cruiser smashes into the back passenger side of the car.
The Datsun is sent spinning like a fucking top. Its ruined
back wheel catches, sending the car tumbling onto its roof.
Madness. The guys scream as the car continues to slide,
upside down, out of control. As it slams into a row of
parking meters, the world goes
BLACK
Will blinks back to reality. He's hanging, inverted, by his
seat belt. The car is a pool of shattered glass. It twinkles
up at him. Hours could have passed, but it's only been
seconds. He sucks in air. Satisfied that he is, in fact,
still alive, he looks over at -
A battered and bruised Chet, head drooping straight back.
WILL
Chet? Are you okay? Chet!?
CHET
(ROUSING)
Oh my god...
WILL
Talk to me.
CHET
I thought you were gonna blow up.
Will's hands go to the bomb...still intact.
72.
WILL
No. Luckily your side took most of
the impact.
CHET
Awesome.
WILL
We gotta keep moving.
Will unclicks his seat belt and falls to the roof of the
car. He moves to Chet, unclicks his belt and helps him down.
Will emerges from the overturned car. He drags Chet out,
along with the bag of cash. He glances up to see the OFFICER
who crashed into them stumbling out of his own ruined car,
which has turned a fire hydrant into a geyser. Another
cruiser races to the scene.
WILL
Oh, fuck, man. Come on.
Will pulls Chet to his feet and they take off, rounding a
CORNER INTO
As Will huffs and puffs -
WILL
Chet...I don't know how to tell you
this...but you got a piece of the
car in you.
CHET
What!?
WILL
In your back.
Chet glances back to see a jagged piece of metal sticking
out of his shoulder blade.
CHET
Ah! Get it out!
WILL
I will.
CHET
Do it now!
73.
WILL
All right.
Without breaking stride, Will yanks the piece of metal out
of Chet's back. He screams.
CHET
Is it rusty? Am I gonna get tetanus?
Behind them, two Officers turn into the alley in full sprint.
They are way faster than the guys and soon gain on them.
Will can barely keep up with Chet.
CHET
Why are you moving so slowly?
WILL
It's a combination of cheap sneakers
and this heavy fucking bomb on my chest!
They burst out of the alley, onto
The guys frantically search for an escape, spot -
A bus pulling up to a stop down the street.
They sprint for the the bus, peeling off their ski masks and
waving as it lazily rolls away from the stop.
WILL
Hey! Over here!
The bus slows and the guys trip over each other to board it.
A crowd has grown around the crash sites. Fire trucks and
ambulances are on the scene.
Dwayne and Jay make their way through the crowd, trying to
see what's what. Dwayne approaches a RANDOM LOCAL.
DWAYNE
You hear what happened to the guys
they were after?
74.
RANDOM LOCAL
Sounds like they got away.
Dwayne and Jay beam.
The guys are covered in sweat as they hike along, eyes on
the lookout. They arrive at Will's parked Mustang. Will
hugs the car.
WILL
I never thought I'd see you again.
CHET
I thought you hated this car.
WILL
It's actually not that bad. You know,
as compared to that Datsun. The
Mustang's got more comfortable seats.
And it never would have flipped over.
Dwayne and Jay cross toward a McDonald's. Dwayne stops and
answers his vibrating cell phone.
76.
DWAYNE
This who I think it is?
WILL (O.S.)
Can't you hear the ticking in the
background?
DWAYNE
You know, you're a pretty funny guy.
WILL (O.S.)
Thanks. I'm happy to entertain a
complete psychopath.
DWAYNE
Now wait a second, you're the murderer.
WILL (O.S.)
What's that supposed to mean?
DWAYNE
One of those cops who wrecked his
car chasing you...he ain't breathing
no more.
Will goes white, covers the phone and whispers to Chet -
WILL
We killed a cop.
CHET
You were driving! I'm just an
accomplice!
WILL
They're gonna hunt us down and kill
us. Cops don't take this shit lightly.
CHET
I bet he had like eight kids. We
have to find them and support his
family forever.
Dwayne is holding back laughter. Finally bursts out.
WILL (O.S.)
What's so fucking funny!?
DWAYNE
I'm just messin' with you. You didn't
kill anyone. How'd a moron like you
manage to rob a bank?
WILL (O.S.)
Jesus! Can we just get this over
with? Where do you want the money?
77.
DWAYNE
There's a boarded up gas station out
on Commerce Avenue, past the highway.
Be there in 30 minutes.
WILL (O.S.)
I'll be there in ten.
DWAYNE
Then you'll be standing around with
your dick in one hand, and my money
in the other.
Dwayne hangs up. He dials another number -
DWAYNE
Yo, Juicy, wrangle your boy. Money's
on its way.
The Mustang shrieks past us.
SUPER COUNTDOWN: 2 hours, 58 minutes...
CUT TO:
Weeds have overtaken the abandoned place. Will leans against
his parked car, waiting. Chet is nowhere to be seen.
Will spots Vaughn's Sentra approach. It pulls into the
station and Vaughn steps. He could not look more menacing.
Juicy hangs back in the passenger seat.
WILL
Where are the other guys?
VAUGHN
I'm the only guy.
(BEAT)
You got it?
Will picks up the garbage bag at his feet and walks it over
to Vaughn. He opens it, looks in.
VAUGHN
What the fuck did you do...rob a
bank?
80.
WILL
(INCREDULOUS)
Yes.
Vaughn grins.
WILL
Now where's the code?
VAUGHN
I don't have any code.
Vaughn turns to leave. Will grabs his arm. Vaughn stops,
looks purposefully down at Will's hand. Will draws back.
WILL
Listen, man, I just want the code.
VAUGHN
I don't know what the fuck you're
talking about.
WILL
The code for the fucking bomb!
Will opens his jacket. Vaughn takes a sudden step back.
VAUGHN
What kind of stupid motherfucker
wears a bomb to a drop?
WILL
Your boss put this on me.
VAUGHN
I am my boss.
WILL
Then give me the code!
VAUGHN
Motherfucker, I don't know no goddamn
code. Whoever told you I did, lied
to you. Now step the fuck off, or
I'll shoot you in the face so you
don't explode and mess up my boots.
Vaughn goes to leave again. Will runs ahead of him and gets
in his way.
WILL
If you don't have the code, I want
that money back.
81.
VAUGHN
The only way you're getting this
money back is if you kill me.
WILL
You don't know what I've gone through
for that money!
In an instant, Vaughn has his gun out, aimed at Will's head.
VAUGHN
Do I look sympathetic? Now step the
fuck aside.
Chet creeping up behind Vaughn, from wherever he was hiding,
clutching a large metal pipe.
Juicy jumps out of the Sentra.
JUICY
Vaughn, look out!
Vaughn whirls around toward Chet, just in time to have his
gun arm smashed by the pipe. The weapon drops from his hand.
Chet takes another swing, cracking Vaughn across the face.
He howls, blood spraying, and topples over. Chet goes for
another swing, when -
Juicy jumps on him, wildly biting and clawing.
Will grabs the back of Juicy's track jacket for leverage and
flings her away. She hits the back of the Sentra and careens
clear across the trunk.
WILL
Let's go!
Will grabs the money. Chet kicks Vaughn's gun into the
bushes. The guys break for the Mustang and get in.
Juicy gets to her feet, runs right by a dazed Vaughn and
after the car, which pulls out into the road and leaves her
behind, screaming and cursing.
Chet jumps out while the Mustang is still slowing down. He
runs 20 yards away. Will turns the car off and gets out.
CHET
That was colossally stupid!
WILL
It was a negotiation tactic. He'll
call back and I won't answer. Then
he'll call back and I will answer, and
he'll realize the only way he gets the
money is if he gives me the code.
CHET
Sure! That seems like a perfectly
logical pattern of thought! I bet
that's exactly what he'll do!
Vaughn has a rag pressed to his swollen, bloody face. Juicy
is nearby, banged up and dirty. Vaughn yells into his cell -
VAUGHN
Who the fuck do you think you're
talking to!?
DWAYNE (O.S.)
I honestly don't know.
VAUGHN
Let me give you a hint: your boy
just jumped me, tossed my bitch like
a rag doll and split with the cash.
Dwayne realizes who's on the other line, recovers -
DWAYNE
That guy's not my boy. He's a dick.
I'm sorry for all the, uh, confusion.
87.
VAUGHN (O.S.)
Confusion? The only motherfucker
that's confused is you. Apparently,
you think you can fuck me and survive
the day.
DWAYNE
I wasn't fucking you, I was fucking
him. You gotta understand, you're
like a pawn in a much larger game
I'm playing here.
VAUGHN (O.S.)
Did you just call me a pawn, you
stupid fuck!?
DWAYNE
I didn't mean it like that. I'm
just juggling a whole lot of shit.
VAUGHN (O.S.)
I want my money. Right now.
DWAYNE
That may not be possible.
(DELICATELY)
I just want to put this out there,
to keep you in the loop...but I may
need to bump the hit.
Vaughn paces, furious.
VAUGHN
This isn't a reservation at Sizzler!
You don't "bump" it! I want you to
bring me my money right now, to where
I am standing in this shit hole town,
bleeding from the motherfucking face!
DWAYNE (O.S.)
I don't exactly have the money...give
me some time and -
VAUGHN
The deal's off! You just became the
hit!
Vaughn hangs up, tosses the bloody rag to the ground and
screams in frustration.
JUICY
He lives with his daddy. You already
got the address.
88.
Will and Chet sit on the ground, still 20 yards apart. Chet
checks his watch.
CHET
It's been half an hour.
WILL
He'll call.
CHET
In another 30 minutes I'm calling
the bomb squad.
Chet gestures to the vast emptiness all around them.
CHET
These guys obviously aren't watching
you anymore.
WILL
You know, even if they get the bomb
squad here in time, and they can
somehow get this thing off me, we
still gotta answer for the robbery.
CHET
I'll take the heat with you, Will.
WILL
Nah. I'll tell them I forced you
into it. That you didn't have a
choice.
CHET
Thanks, man.
90.
Will looks at Chet for a beat.
WILL
That's it? You're not gonna think
about it a little longer? After all
we went through...tear down the
relationship, rebuild it...you're
gonna let me go to prison alone?
CHET
You offered.
WILL
It was a test. Your grade: F minus.
You know what the "F" is for?
CHET
To fuck myself?
WILL
You passed that test. Failed the
important one.
As the guys continue to argue -
SUPER COUNTDOWN: 1 hour, 28 minutes...
CUT TO:
The Major is watching reruns of Three's Company. He doesn't
laugh or remotely smile at any of it.
The subtle click of a door opening does not escape his finely
tuned senses.
MAJOR
Dwayne?
Nothing. The Major gets up and goes to a desk, rifles through
a drawer and pulls something out. A simple pen. He clutches
it like a weapon.
Will and Chet are still arguing -
CHET
Look at the upshot, while you're
behind bars you can finally finish
your degree. If I was there, too,
it would just be a distraction.
WILL
Great idea, Chet. Thanks a lot.
I'll just sit here and figure out a
fucking major.
Will stews. After a beat, his hand goes to his pocket.
It's vibrating. He pulls out his cell.
WILL
Hey, it's them.
94.
Will answers -
WILL
You ready to talk now?
INTERCUT WITH:
Two menacing headlights come at us on the empty road. They
BELONG TO
The Mustang stops by the gate to the radio tower. Chet jumps
out and disappears into the bushes.
The Mustang pulls up. Will gets out and looks around the
deserted place. He holds up the money bag.
WILL
I'm here!
In the shadow of the nearby shed, the minivan is revealed as
its interior lights come on. The door opens and Dwayne
emerges, in his mask.
DWAYNE
How much time you got left?
97.
Will takes off the jacket and tosses it to the ground. He
looks at the timer.
WILL
Ten minutes.
DWAYNE
Damn. Maybe we should just wait
around for the money shot.
The guys meet in a clearing. Dwayne nods at the bag.
DWAYNE
That the money?
WILL
Maybe. Where's the girl?
Dwayne grins.
DWAYNE
In the van. Maybe.
WILL
Get her out here. You're wasting time.
Will grips the bag close to him.
Dwayne whistles. The minivan door opens and Jay steps out.
Strapped to his back is the frame pack we saw at his workshop.
A long tube connects the pack to the handle of a metal pipe-
like device in his hand.
Jay helps Kate, still bound and blindfolded, out of the van.
They approach Dwayne and take up position behind him.
KATE
Will, are you there?
WILL
I'm here. It's gonna be okay.
DWAYNE
This is a fucking tearjerker.
WILL
Just let her come over here.
DWAYNE
I will. But you should know, my
associate over there is packing a
flamethrower.
Jay aims the metal device he has been holding. He hits a
button and a pilot light comes on.
98.
JAY
(FLAT)
Just do what we say. Don't mess
around or anything.
DWAYNE
Unless either of you can outrun a 25-
foot flame.
(gestures to gun in his belt)
Or a bullet.
Dwayne roughly pulls Kate away from Jay and shoves her
forward. Will grabs her, pulls her blindfold off and pushes
her behind him.
WILL
Get back.
DWAYNE
I gave you the girl. Now give me
the money.
WILL
How about we get the code out of the
way first, since this bomb happens
to be ticking so close to all of us.
DWAYNE
Fair enough.
Dwayne pulls a slip of paper from his pocket.
DWAYNE
(TAUNTING)
You ready to be a free man?
WILL
Just give it to me!
DWAYNE
448921.
Will keys in the numbers. The timer freezes and the lock at
the hinge opens. Will carefully extricates himself from the
vest. He lays it down on the ground and steps away from it.
His shirt is drenched in sweat from where the bomb sat.
Will takes a final look at the money bag, then throws it to
Dwayne. He looks inside, smiles. Jay takes a peak.
DWAYNE
It's so fucking pretty, ain't it?
JAY
Yeah. It's awesome.
99.
Dwayne looks up at Will.
DWAYNE
Okay, you can get out of here now.
WILL
I actually have this sneaking
suspicion that once we turn around,
you're gonna put a bullet in both of
our backs - and this is just a guess -
burn our bodies.
DWAYNE
They say great minds think alike.
And in this case, so do we.
WILL
I figured as much. That's why I got
a gun pointed at you, too.
(LOUDLY)
I got a sniper in the bushes locked
on you right now.
DWAYNE
Do I look that dumb?
WILL
I can't tell, you're wearing a mask.
Before Dwayne can react, he stops and blinks, something
shining in his eyes.
JAY
Hey...on your forehead.
Dwayne's eyes turn upward, just barely making out the red
dot that dances on his forehead.
DWAYNE
Son of a bitch. Well played.
In the bushes, hidden from sight, Chet carefully aims his
laser pointer at Dwayne's forehead.
Will grins at Dwayne.
WILL
We're gonna walk out of here now.
If you shoot, my sniper shoots. I
can't guarantee he'll get both of
you. But he'll definitely get you.
As Will turns away -
100.
VAUGHN (O.S.)
Hold the fuck up.
Vaughn emerges from the darkness. He looks at Will.
VAUGHN
Wasn't expecting to see you here.
Without warning, Vaughn cracks Will over the head with the
butt of his gun. He goes down hard. Kate screams. Vaughn
points the gun at her and she shuts up.
Dwayne steps forward with the bag.
DWAYNE
It's all good. We got your money.
VAUGHN
Nice mask, Dwayne. Now throw the
money over here.
Dwayne complies. As soon as the bag lands, Vaughn aims the
gun at him.
DWAYNE
Hold up. You don't have to do this.
I just paid you.
Kate looks on, terrified, an unconscious Will at her side.
Vaughn's eyes burn a hole through Dwayne.
VAUGHN
I've been hit with a pipe, shot with a
pen, and wasted my whole motherfucking
day...all because of you and this job.
DWAYNE
I don't know what you're talking about.
Just take the money.
VAUGHN
I will. And then I'm gonna tie up the
two loose ends in the gorilla masks.
DWAYNE
I'm not a loose end!
VAUGHN
You're a fucking idiot. You are as
loose as ends get.
Panicked, Dwayne's eyes flash over to Jay, who tightens his
grip on the flamethrower handle. Jay catches Dwayne's eye.
Dwayne nods. Vaughn sees this.
101.
VAUGHN
What the -
Jay rears up with the flamethrower. Vaughn couldn't be more
surprised to see the device Jay is holding spit a massive
ball of fire at him.
Vaughn dives to the ground, fires off two wild shots, one of
WHICH -
Nails Dwayne in the shoulder, spinning him backward and
knocking him off his feet.
Kate recoils in horror as: Vaughn scurries madly on the
ground, intermittently firing, while Jay screams and tries
to torch him with the 25-foot flame. A hand touches Kate's
shoulder and she whirls around to find -
KATE
Chet!? What are you doing here!?
CHET
Not now. We gotta take off.
(LOOKS AROUND)
Where's Will?
Kate looks to the empty spot beside her where Will just was.
Flames inches from him, Vaughn lines up a desperate shot -
Good news: the bullet only grazes Jay's side. Bad news: it
keeps going and punches through the flamethrower backpack,
which happens to be filled with gasoline, which happens to
have an incredibly low flash point. So the spark from, say,
a bullet, would cause
AN ERUPTION OF FLAMES
Meanwhile, Will pops up behind Chet and Kate, clutching the
garbage bag.
WILL
I got the money. Let's get the fuck
out of here.
They take off toward Will's car.
Dwayne groggily comes to...no SOUND, just a ringing. The
first thing he sees: Vaughn storming toward him, god-knows-
what spewing from his mouth. Vaughn levels his gun -
It doesn't make a sound for two reasons. The second being
that it's out of bullets.
Dwayne fumbles for his own hardware. Muzzle flash.
102.
Vaughn drops to his knees. Pulse snatched from him.
SOUND SLAMS BACK to the tune of Jay's screams. Dwayne looks
over to see his friend in flames, flailing his arms and
shrieking. Dwayne's head snaps to the other side, where he
sees the Mustang's tires peel. He tears off his mask,
frantically looks around. The money is gone.
DWAYNE
No!!
Jay disentangles himself from the backpack, the source of
the flames, but his clothes are now ablaze. In his frenzy,
he somehow manages to string together two coherent words -
JAY
Dwayne! Help!
Dwayne gets to his feet as the Mustang roars down the
driveway. He looks to Jay, then to his minivan. Dwayne's
face: Two roads diverge in a wood. Which to take?
DWAYNE
Goddamn it, Jay!
Dwayne sprints over to Jay, rips off his jacket and uses it
to beat the flames down.
DWAYNE
Stop, drop and roll!
Jay hits the deck. Dwayne continues fighting the flames,
finally falls on top of Jay with the jacket spread and
smothers the last of them out.
Jay looks up at Dwayne with puppy dog eyes.
JAY
You came back for me...you said you
never would.
DWAYNE
You didn't hesitate back there, Jay.
You did good.
Jay smiles. Flames overtake the field all around them.
DWAYNE
I'm gonna go put a bullet in that
motherfucker and get our money.
Think you can get outta here?
JAY
Yeah. Go get him.
103.
Dwayne hurries toward the minivan. Jay stumbles up to his
feet and limps off toward the woods.
The Mustang travels away from the rising flames.
Dwayne's car pulls even with the Mustang.
An explosion rocks the minivan from inside. The back end is
lifted off the ground and the car tumbles over itself. It
lands on its roof and skids into a ditch.
The car zooms off.
SUPER COUNTDOWN: 0 hours, 0 minutes...
CUT TO:
106.
Wind fans the flames of the burning minivan. The shattered
windshield sprouts another crack...then another, as -
Dwayne's foot kicks it out. He drags himself from the
smoldering steel carcass. He is a charred, blood splattered
mess, but he is alive.
Dwayne is propped up against a sign, lingering on the edge
of consciousness. The headlights of a lone pickup truck
approach. Dwayne feebly waves the truck down for a ride.
Will. Shirtless. Could be anywhere.
Chet approaches and sits beside him.
CHET
Fucking nine dollars to use the
internet.
WILL
And?
CHET
Police think it was that black guy.
They found some kind of map in his
car. And I'm sure racial profiling
played a part.
WILL
But nothing about us?
CHET
Nope. Guess it's time to head back.
WILL
I was thinking we'd stick around a
little a longer.
CHET
Why? So you have more time to delude
my sister?
WILL
Yes. And it'd be easier if you gave
us five fucking minutes alone.
Chet stares out at the ocean for a beat.
CHET
You really think she's into you?
WILL
(SWALLOWS HARD)
I kissed her last night. No tongue.
Then you walked in.
Chet just nods. Will gets up.
109.
CHET
You're gonna go fuck my sister now,
aren't you?
WILL
I'll be thinking of you the whole
time.
CHET
At the very least...be a considerate
lover. Give pleasure, before taking
pleasure.
WILL
I think I'm reading you. And I will
try my best.
Will heads up a trail that leads to a hotel bungalow. Kate
opens the door, steps out onto the porch.
Will stops, looks back at Chet. He whistles. Chet turns.
WILL
You're Riggs! You always have been!
Chet smiles, shakes his head as -
Will reaches the porch. He stands close to Kate. His nerves
clock overtime.
WILL
I lied and told your brother I kissed
you. I thought it would make this
easier.
KATE
Here's an idea: pretend you have a
bomb strapped to your chest. Tick,
TICK -
Will closes the gap and kisses her. After a beat -
KATE
Is Chet watching us?
WILL
Probably. We should go inside. I
promised him I'd satisfy you.
Kate laughs, leads him inside and the door shuts to -
BLACK
110.
CREDITS ROLL.
But they are pushed to one side of the screen, as the other
side is filled with -
A lo-fi, 2001-style light tunnel. It deposits us in the
furthest reaches of the galaxy, where we find -
A tanning bed. Rotating in orbit. Dwayne's voice booms and
REVERBERATES -
DWAYNE
GRAND OPENING SPECTACULARRR!
The tanning bed explodes, like a star gone supernova. From
the light and fire and chaos...emerges a logo:
MAJOR TAN
A bad MATCH CUT takes us to the same logo. Camera ZOOMS OUT
unsteadily to reveal it is a banner above a strip mall
storefront. We are watching a local commercial with
appropriately poor production value.
Dwayne stands outside the store.
DWAYNE
So come on down to Major Tan...where
we're proud to be a family business.
PULL BACK TO REVEAL...The Major beside Dwayne. He's only
about four feet tall now, on account of the wheelchair. But
he's grinning like a jackal, in a POW-MIA cap.
A SUPERED LOGO appears: Military Discounts Available!
As father and son smile and wave at us -
END COMMERCIAL.
