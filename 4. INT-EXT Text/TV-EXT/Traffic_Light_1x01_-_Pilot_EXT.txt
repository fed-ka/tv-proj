                        I m sorry, Officer. I guess I got 
                          distracted. I m moving in with my 
                        girlfriend tomorrow.

                        Weak excuse, but hey, that s 
                        great. You getting her a present?

                        Sure. It s a big deal.

                        (SPEAKER) Told you.

                                            ADAM
                        It s not that big of a deal. She s 
                        been staying over almost every 
                        night for months.

                        Underline almost there. Trust me, 
                        it s a big deal. Get her a 
                        present. Make it special. Call it 
                        a  new life together  present.

                        (SPEAKER) This is good stuff here, 
                        Adam. I hope you re listening.

                                            ADAM
                        What should I get her? Like a 
                        necklace or something?

                        No, get her something you could 
                        use together at your new home-- 
                        but no kitchen stuff. Something 
                        fun like Wii or Guitar hero.

          Ethan, Mike, and Mike s wife, LISA, 33, help Adam and his 
          girlfriend CALLIE unpack while eating pizzas. Adam hands 
          Callie a present. Mike and Ethan take note.

                                            CALLIE

                        For our new life. Something we can 
                        do together.

          Behind Callie, Mike gives Adam the thumbs up. Callie 
          opens it. It s a Wii game.

                                            CALLIE
                        You are a very thoughtful man.

          Callie kisses Adam. Mike pulls a picture out of a box. 
        It s of the 1999 University of Illinois baseball team.

                                            MIKE
                        Wow. Takes me back.

        They laugh.

                        There s nothing like being on a 
                        team. The bond you feel-- it s 
                        bigger than anything. (OFF LISA S

                        No. Although I did get to play in 
                        our last game when we were 
                        seniors.

                        Adam, Ben, and I went to the coach 
                        and insisted he let Mike suit up.

                        I ll admit there was an influence.

                        Doesn t matter how I got in, 
                        though. When history called, I 
                        stood tall.



        Mike approaches the plate with all the swagger of Babe 
        Ruth about to call his shot. In the batter s box, he 
          stares down the pitcher with steely resolve until... a 
          wicked fastball beans Mike right on the helmet. He hits 
        the dirt like a sack of equipment.



          A groggy Mike is carried off on a stretcher by 
          paramedics. Mike whispers in the ear of a paramedic. They 
          change course and carry Mike down the first base line. 
        They lower the stretcher, Mike touches first base, and 
          raises his arms in victory to the greatest applause he ll 
        ever get in life.



        Adam is at his desk in the swank offices of the men s 
          magazine where he works. The magazine s publisher, MARTY, 
        an incredibly well-off man in his 50s, enters.
                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    10.

                        wrote on the  Five Ways your Boss 
                          Manipulates you.  Good stuff. What 
                        was the third way again?

                                            ADAM
                        Oh, that s the one where your boss 
                        constantly refers to the tough 
                        economic times to make you feel 
                        insecure about your job.

          Marty sits on the edge of the desk.

                                            MARTY
                        Man, these are tough days for 
                        print media. Magazines getting 
                        taken down like (SNAPS) that. Did 
                        you hear about  Gourmet?  So sad. 
                        I m hanging in there for now, but 
                        I just don t know how long I can 
                        keep all six of my magazines up 
                        and running. 

          Panic comes across Adam s face as Marty picks up a desk 
          photo of Callie.

                                            MARTY (CONT D)
                        Oh, hey. Heard you and your 
                        girlfriend just bought a new 
                        place. Congrats. You didn t 
                        overpay, did you?

        Adam makes a sheepish expression:  maybe a bit. 

                                            MARTY (CONT D)
                        Doesn t matter. Callie makes some

                        again?

                        of them a few issues ago.

        Adam pulls out a magazine with a large wrestler, dressed 
        as a clown holding an electric saw, on the cover.

                        Yeah, that s why I m here, smart-

                        prologue? Here s the pay-off. My 
                        kid s obsessed with the Sawing 
                        Clown. Do you think you can get 
                        him and a few other wrestlers to 
                        do an exhibition performance at 
                        the party?

                          Absolutely! I totally hit it off 
                        with the Sawing Clown. I even 
                        helped him shop for an engagement 
                        ring for his fiancee.

                        the potential to become long term.

        He sighs, knowing this is not something he s ready to 
          give, then looks over at his dog playing with Sherry s 
        dog.

                        Carl s gonna be so disappointed. 
                        He liked you. (BEAT) And so did I.

                                            SHERRY
                        (KISSING HIM ON THE CHEEK) Bye 
                        Ethan. (CALLING HER DOG) Pickles.

          Sherry walks away. Her dog follows. Carl walks over to 
          Ethan and looks up at him.

                                            ETHAN

                        Here s where you made your 
                        mistake. You framed the issue 
                        wrong. You can t say that you want 
                        to go out with your friends 
                        because you think it ll be fun.

                        Mike explained the whole thing to 
                        me at the bar last night. It s 
                        actually sorta fascinating. 
                          Apparently, what you need to do is 
                        act like you don t want to go out.

                                            MIKE
                        Exactly. You have to act like 
                        going out is a burden, like you re 
                        only doing it because one of us 
                        really needs you.

                        build our relationship on lying.

                        It s not lying. It s more like a 
                          face-saving gesture for both 
                        parties. Everyone walks away with 
                        dignity. It s like international 
                        diplomacy. (THEN) Alright, topic 
                        change. I m gonna be driving Lisa 
                        to and from work for the next 
                        couple of days. When you guys 
                        call, if I cough twice, that means 
                        that Lisa s in the car. Everybody 
                        got that?

        They get to the CASHIER, a woman in her late 20s.

                        It s amazing that you can get away 
                        with that.

                        Get away with what? Making her 
                        feel awesome? Every girl I know is 
                        insecure about her breasts.

                        I could never get away with that.

                        It s only weird if you make it 
                        weird. Your vibe has to be  I m

                        That s your vibe. You don t linger

        The cashier returns. She hands the orders to the guys.

                        in that shirt.

        The cashier doesn t say anything. Mike s smile takes on a 
          weird expression.

                        He s right. You have to be more 
                        subtle. Find a way to organically 
                        mention her name in conversation. 
                        That s what I do. Like  hey, Lisa,

                        I don t know what to tell you,

                        Well, not permission exactly. More 
                        like her blessing. You ll see. You 
                        get in a serious relationship and

        Mike and Lisa are in the car on the way to work. The

                        My assistant s gonna give me a 
                        ride home tonight, honey, so I ll 
                        just see you back at home.

        She kisses him and gets out. Mike waits a beat for her to 
        walk away, then immediately calls Adam back, thrilled at 
        the success of their plan.

                                            MIKE
                        Dude, that was amazing.

                                            ADAM
                        (ON SPEAKER) Worst conversation 
                        I ve ever had. Almost fell asleep.

        In the background, we see that Lisa has forgotten 
          something and heads back to the car.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    27.

          CONTINUED: (2)

                                            MIKE
                        You get the stuff for the 
                        wrestling?

        Lisa opens the car door and gets in. Mike doesn t know 
        how to stop Adam.

                                            ADAM
                        (ON SPEAKER) Yeah, I got the 
                        perfect tights. I m pretty sure 
                        they ll fit you...

        Mike gets more desperate as Lisa looks on, aghast.

                                            ADAM (CONT D)
                        (ON SPEAKER) Oh, and you re gonna 
                        have to snag some of Lisa s 
                        lipstick-- red to match the wig. 
                        The other guys are pretty big so 
                        you might want to wear a shoe with 
                        some heel--

        In desperation, Mike coughs twice. A beat, then:

                                            ADAM (CONT D)
                        (ON SPEAKER) What s up, Lisa?

        Lisa is dumbfounded.

                                            LISA
                        I... I just... I... We ll... I... 

          Unable to string a sentence together, Lisa walks off.



        The Bar Mitzvah party. A frenzy of crazed 13 year-olds 
        and their parents. A wrestling ring is set up. Adam 
          stands with Marty, his boss, surveying the scene.

                                            ADAM
                        Mazel tov. Your son became a man 
                        today.

                                            MARTY
                          (CHUCKLING) Poor bastard.



        Mike and Lisa, Adam and Callie, Ethan and Sherry get out 
        of a rented mini-van, about to go to Ben s thing. The 
        guys are dressed in suits. They look up, and are moved:

          Their POV: a nice high school baseball field/stadium. A 
          brand new sign reads:

        BEN HUBBARD MEMORIAL FIELD

        Ben Hubbard 1977-2005

        This is  Ben s thing.  Adam, Mike, and Ethan have raised 
          money to build a new stadium at Ben s high school and 
          dedicated it to him.



          A fairly large crowd is assembled for the dedication. A 
          marching band gets ready in the outfield. Adam and 
          Callie, Mike (a new cast on his arm) and Lisa, Ethan and 
          Sherry admire the new field. Adam takes Callie s hand. 
        Mike tries to take Lisa s hand but can t with the cast. 
          Ethan takes Sherry s. 

                                            ETHAN
                        (TO SHERRY, A LITTLE SURPRISED) 
                        I m really glad you re here.

        Adam and Mike head off to greet Ben s parents. 

                                            CALLIE
                        Wish I got the chance to meet Ben.

                                            LISA
                        He would ve liked you.

          Callie takes this in. Down the field, Ethan has his arm 
          around Sherry, introducing her to some former teammates.

                                            CALLIE
                        Ethan seems really happy to be 
                        with Sherry. Weird. I thought for 
                        sure that whole thing at the bar 
                        was a charade.  

                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    35.

                                            CALLIE
                        He was milking it so much. I just 
                        called Sherry to mess with him.

                                            LISA
                        Ben definitely would ve liked you.

          ANGLE ON: Mike and Adam talk to Ethan.

                                            ADAM
                        So Sherry, huh? Are you and her--

                                            ETHAN
                        Don t make me label it or I m 
                        gonna run.



          Adam, Mike, and Ethan are at a mic near the pitcher s 
          mound. They re in the middle of speaking about Ben.

                                            ADAM
                        Ben and I played baseball together 
                        here in high school. And then at 
                        the University of Illinois. He was 
                        a lot better than me. Ben was a 
                        great athlete, a brilliant if 
                        uneven student, and a great son. 
                        He was also an eccentric guy and 
                        that made him all the more 
                        interesting.

        Adam exchanges a look with Ethan and Mike.

                                            ADAM (CONT D)
                        When we were still freshman at 
                        Illinois-- and Ben and I had just 
                        met Mike and Ethan-- the four of 
                        us decided to drive to Chicago for 
                        the weekend. Ben insisted we take 
                        surface streets the whole way. I 
                        thought that was crazy. There must 
                        be ten thousand traffic lights 
                        between Champagne and Chicago, I 
                        said-- it ll take us twice as long 
                        to get there. Ben insisted. On the 
                          Interstate, he said, you know what 
                        you re gonna get: a straight line 
                        and a lot of fast food. On a road 
                        with traffic lights, it s a 
                        different story.                                                                                    36.



          Ethan, in his EMT uniform, attends to an injured player 
        at a women s beach volleyball tournament, surrounded by 
        her concerned and beautiful teammates.

                                            ADAM (V.O.)
                        Sometimes the light is green-- and 
                        you enjoy the open road, wondering 
                        what might be out there for you. 



                                            ADAM
                        Of course a trip that should ve 
                        taken three hours, took ten. But 
                        on that trip the four of us formed 
                        a lifelong friendship. We miss Ben 
                        every day, but he left us with 
                        many gifts. (LOOKING AT MIKE AND 
                        ETHAN) The biggest of those gifts 
                        is our friendship.

        The crowd applauds as the guys move to their women. Adam 
          meets up with Callie. 

                                            CALLIE
                        Great speech. (FIXING HIS TIE) And 
                        you look hot in your suit.

        She kisses him.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                    37.

                        I need to tell you something...

                                            CALLIE
                        Before you do, I need to get this 
                        off my chest. Remember the other 
                        day when I said Liz had to work 
                        late and I needed to walk her dog? 
                        (OFF ADAM S NOD) Liz didn t have 
                        to work late.

                                            ADAM
                        Really?

                        She doesn t even have a dog. 
                        (THEN) It s just that I ve never 
                        lived with anyone before and we 
                        were doing all this shopping and 
                        hanging pictures and it all just 
                        felt so domestic-- I kinda freaked 
                        out a little bit and I just needed 
                        a few hours to myself. I know I 
                        should have just told you the 
                        truth but I didn t want to make 
                        you feel weird and I m sorry.

                                            ADAM
                        Being honest: that makes me love 
                        you like a thousand times more.

                                            CALLIE

        She kisses him.

                        What was it you wanted to tell me?

        Adam thinks a beat: should he confess?

                        I m happy we re living together.

          Mike, Lisa, Ethan, and Sherry approach. Behind them, the 
          marching band starts to play a spirited version of 
            Chumbawamba s  Tubthumping (I get knocked down).
