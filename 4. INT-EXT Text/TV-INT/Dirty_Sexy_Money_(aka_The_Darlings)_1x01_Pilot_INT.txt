      This is the most luxuriously-appointed helicopter we ve ever 
      seen. FREDDY, the friendly pilot, just asked Nick a question. 

                                  FREDDY
                    Mister George?

                                  NICK
                          (snapping out of it)
                    Yeah?

                                  FREDDY
                    In your Dad s plane -- dja find 
                    what you were looking for?

      Nick answers as if what he d been looking for was cancer.

                                  NICK
                    Yeah, I did, Freddy. Thanks.

      And as Nick turns and looks back out the window -- HAUNTED --


      Nick just sat down across from arch Elite Magazine reporter 
      NAOMI LEEDS (late 40 s). Nick s demeanor is PURE GRACE -- If 
      he s still feeling all that turmoil, it s well-hidden.

                                  NICK
                    Why would I do that, Ms. Leeds?

      While Naomi talks, Nick looks wisely at the WINE LIST.

                                  NAOMI LEEDS
                    Oh, I don t know, Mister George -- 
                    probably for the same reason it 
                    took your father three and a half 
                    years to agree to sit down and do 
                    this interview with me. Fear.

      Nick smiles. The WAITER arrives. Nick hands over the list."The Darlings" by Craig Wright - Network Draft - 01/03/07    3.

                    Of course.

      The Waiter, impressed with Nick s choice, hurries away.

                                  NAOMI LEEDS
                    My condolences, by the way -- on 
                    the loss of your father.

                    So, what do you want to know about 
                    the Darlings, Ms. Leeds -- and why?

                                  NAOMI LEEDS
                    Elite has a long history, as you 
                    know, of publishing substantial 
                      investigative pieces about the 
                    lives of the super-rich -- the von 
                    Bulows, the Factors, the Kennedys, 
                    etcetera -- and the Darlings  time 
                    has come, it s that simple.

                                  NICK
                    Says who?

                                  NAOMI LEEDS
                    Says me. The Darlings are the last 
                    of a dying breed, Mister George. In 
                    a few years, the  War on Terror  
                    will have escalated into a genuine 
                    Third World War which is going to 
                    set off an economic upheaval the 
                    likes of which this country s never 
                    seen. America, as we know it, is 
                    almost over -- and the Darlings, 
                    with their billions of dollars and 
                    their absurdly decadent, ignorant, 
                    insulated lifestyle ARE America.

                    From my point of view as a kid, my 
                    Dad led a magical life.

      -- we see his Dad, DEVLIN GEORGE (30 S) and RUTH, his MOM 
      (30 s), at the table.

      Devlin enters with suitcases to find Nick and Ruth waiting.

                                  DEVLIN

                    Yes! Mister DeGaulle came in to say 
                     bon jour,  because he s very happy 
                    the Darlings are investing in his 
                    project -- and he s the one who 
                    gave me this lamp to give to you.

                                  YOUNG NICK
                    Can I come to Paris next time?

                    Then, when my Mom died --"The Darlings" by Craig Wright - Network Draft - 01/03/07    6.




      Young Nick is walking down a hallway toward a BARELY-OPEN 
      BATHROOM DOOR, carrying SOMETHING. WATER S RUNNING.

                                  YOUNG NICK

      Young Nick opens the bathroom door slowly.


      The Waiter s opening and pouring the WINE for Nick to taste.

      -- to find Ruth on the floor, her WRISTS SLASHED, in a 
      rapidly widening POOL OF BLOOD. 

      Young Nick drops the snowflake, which falls into the blood

      Young Patrick keeps talking Spanish as Young Nick advances 
      and finds Young Karen Darling (7), reading  Vogue  with her 
      Mom, Young Letitia Darling, a glittery beauty (40 s).

                    Hi. I m so sorry for your loss.

                                  KIKI
                    Thank you.

                     Every man s death diminishes me, 
                    because I am involved in mankind. 
                      Therefore, never send to know for 
                    whom the bell tolls -- it tolls for 
                    thee. 
                          (refusing to feel)
                    My Dad was more involved in mankind 
                    than anyone I know. That s what 
                    I ll remember most. That s why I ll 
                    always hear the bells.

      There s a dead silence that feels VERY ANTICLIMACTIC. Nick, 
      unmoved himself, steps down and joins Lisa and Kiki.

                    He taught me how to ride a bike. 
                    How to fly-fish. He helped me pass 
                    the New York Bar. No small feat.
                          (off charmed laughs)
                    It was many a time I brought a 
                    dilemma to my father, a great man 
                    in his own right, and he would 
                    offer opinions, but he would always 
                    say, when he was done,  Ask Dutch.  
                    Because Dutch was so much more than 
                    our lawyer. He was our conscience, 
                    our confidant -- our friend.  
                          (starting to cry)
                    Thank you, Nick, for sharing your 
                    Dad s life with us. We couldn t 
                    have done it without him.

      Nick and Tripp are sitting across from each other in a vast

      Nick has just arrived and Lisa, gorgeous in a SEXY GOWN, is 
      standing with Tripp and Letitia, drinking CHAMPAGNE.

      The chandelier-dripping room is FILLED WITH 200 GUESTS -- 
      FAMOUS FACES -- and everything is SILVER AND GOLD. A SMALL 
      ORCHESTRA plays on a STAGE at the end of the room."The Darlings" by Craig Wright - Network Draft - 01/03/07    38.

                    Don t worry about it, I got her, 
                    she was fine.

                    Tripp and Letitia are telling me 
                    stories about when you were little.

      Nick grabs a CHAMPAGNE FLUTE from a passing tray.

                    Nothing too embarrassing, I hope.

                    I was just about to tell Lisa, 
                    Nick, about the time you came to

                    Well. We had the party up at our

                    And when it came time to leave, we 
                    couldn t find Nicky. Everyone

                          (getting emotional)
                    I mean, how many men do we know,

                    child alone like that, and so well?

                    He was such a good man. 

      Letitia fights back TEARS. Tripp puts an arm around her.

                                  TRIPP
                          (to Nick and Lisa)
                    It s still a little tough around 
                    here. You know how it is. 

      OFF NICK, noting the unexpected depth of Letitia s sadness.

                    So. Tell us. Are you gonna run?

                                  RUDY
                    Oh, gosh, I don t know, Pat, you 
                    know, I ve thought about it, but -- 
                    I d miss New York so much.

                                    PATRICK
                    I know how you feel. Washington is, 
                    uh -- how did Mark Twain put it?  A 
                    town of southern efficiency...

                     And northern charm.  Exactly. It s 
                    exactly backwards of what you want.

      Patrick notices something TROUBLING across the room.

                    knows, if John doesn t run, but --

                    Would you two excuse me one moment?

                                  RUDY
                    Of course. Do your thing.

      Patrick rushes away. Rudy watches him go, ADMIRING him.

                    He s the one who should run.

      Tripp s at the MICROPHONE with Letitia by his side. 

                                  TRIPP
                    This is a very special night.

      APPLAUSE. FIND NICK AND LISA in the crowd. Lisa s having fun. 
      A WAITER walks up and quietly hands Nick A SMALL ENVELOPE.

                                  TRIPP  (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    And it s a very special gift to 
                    have you all here. A blessing. 

      Nick opens the envelope and pulls out a CARD. It s Patrick s 
      SENATORIAL BUSINESS CARD. Huh?"The Darlings" by Craig Wright - Network Draft - 01/03/07    42.



                                  TRIPP (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    Y know, the day I met Tish Van 
                    Kirk, forty years ago, I told my 
                    roommate at Yale that I was the 
                    luckiest guy in the whole world.

      Nick turns the card over -- handwritten on the back is:

                  MEET ME IN THE LIBRARY NOW -- CODE PINK!!!

      Nick looks around for the waiter who delivered the message. 

                                  TRIPP (CONT D)
                    Standing up here tonight, though, I 
                    realize I didn t even know what 
                    lucky was back then. Because it 
                    just gets better and better.


      Nick is walking, ENVELOPE IN HAND, and is passed by Freddy, 
      going the other way, looking BALEFUL. They briefly lock eyes.

      After Freddy disappears down the staircase, Nick hears CRYING 
      coming from behind a BARELY-OPEN DOOR. He looks in.

      It s KAREN, standing alone in the middle of a WHITE BEDROOM, 
      looking like a stunning statue in her DEEP RED GOWN.

                    Thank you for saying so. Thank you.

      Karen touches Nick s face and then kisses him on the cheek."The Darlings" by Craig Wright - Network Draft - 01/03/07    44.

                    You re sweet.

      With her cheek on Nick s, Karen lingers just a little bit 
      longer than the gesture actually requires -- and Nick stays.

                                  LISA (O.C.)
                    Nick?

      Nick turns to see Lisa in the doorway. OH SHIT. She saw that 
      kiss -- and she s not happy about it.

                                  LISA (CONT D)
                    Patrick s looking for you.
                          (to Karen)
                    Sorry to interrupt.

      Lisa walks swiftly away. Nick gives Karen a look.

                    Excuse me. Lisa. Lisa!


      Nick tackles Brian. They crash to the floor. Nick POUNDS HIM.

      Juliet s asleep. Karen and Letitia are by her side. A DOCTOR 
      (60 S, Freudian), holding a VIAL, talks to Tripp and Nick.

                    She took somewhere between five and 
                    ten, considering when this was

                    few of them into the pillow. I 
                    think she ll be fine. She just 
                    needs some rest. I ll see her for

      THUNDER CRASHES. Nick and Naomi are having dessert. The tenor

                    But why? I don t get it. It was an 
                    easy day, no heavy legal lifting. 
                    You went to a party. You were 
                    following in your Dad s footsteps, 
                    doing your  dream job.  Why quit?

                    No, it s not. For one thing, you 
                    haven t mentioned Jeremy s arrest 
                    for human trafficking, an arrest

                    Sure.

      She hands it over quizzically -- he looks -- hands it back.

                    Yes it was -- I bought it --

                                  NICK
                    Tillie Kemper Van Kirk gave it to 
                    her daughter Letitia on Letitia s 
                    sixteenth birthday in 1957. And 
                    Letitia left that ring in a velvet 
                    bag on the steps of the orphanage 
                    of the Sisters of Eternal Mercy 
                    along with a baby girl one summer 
                    night in 1962 because she d made a 
                    mistake with some boy, and Tripp 
                    Darling had just announced his 
                    intention to ask for her hand in 
                    marriage -- and she wasn t going to 
                    let anything -- anything -- keep 
                    that from happening.

                    How do you know all this?

                                  NICK
                    I know all this because Letitia had 
                    a copy of the ring made when she 
                    had her second daughter -- the one 
                    everyone thinks is her first.


      That moment when Karen touched Nick s face...

                                  KAREN
                    Thank you for saying that.

      And there -- on her hand -- is AN IDENTICAL RING.

                    At least you were honest about one 
                    thing tonight. Your interest in the 
                    Darlings is more than journalistic.

      Nick is sitting there, looking out at the receding land -- 
      the hangar where his father s plane is sitting -- his past.

                     And you may ask yourself: Well, 
                    how did I get here? 

      And we PULL BACK and let Nick and his story head back for the 
      CITY IN THE DISTANCE where it s all going to happen: N.Y.C.
