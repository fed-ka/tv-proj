  EXT.  BASEBALL PRACTICE FIELD -- DAY11

  MONTAGE / VARIOUS ANGLES: 

  Minor league baseball practice game.  95mph fastballs, 
  backdoor curves, sliders and splitters, whiffed on, hit for 
    grounders, diving infield catches, mid-air throws to first, 
  line drives to the outfield, snagged with basket catches.

  (MUSIC:  Centerfield by John Fogerty or Glory Days by 
    Springsteen)

  VICK JOHNSTON steps up to the plate.  Big, muscular hitter.   *
  WHACKS the first pitch a hundred miles -- but foul.  

  Watching from the sidelines, eating sunflower seeds: COACH 
  GRADY.  Turns to old-hand, TRAINER WEAVER.

                              GRADY
                  Johnston s looking strong. *

                                WEAVER
                Says it s some new conditioning 
                program. 

                              GRADY
                Keeps it up, he ll be batting clean-
                up again for the big club in April.

  Johnston smashes a long line drive against the outfield wall,  *
  SLIDES head first into second, inches ahead of the tag--

  The Second Baseman throws the ball in.  Looks back to see 
  Vick still splayed out in the dirt.  Pats him on the back. *

                                SECOND BASEMAN
                Taking a nap, Vick? *




                                                                          (CONTINUED)      NUMB3RS   #308/45   "Hardball"   YELLOW Draft   10-03-06    2.

  But Vick doesn t move.  Eyes wide open.  Not blinking. *

                                SECOND BASEMAN (CONT'D)
                Hey.  Hey!  We need some help here!

22INT. LOCKER ROOM -- DAY 

  DON takes a VIAL from a locker, puts it in an evidence bag, 
  hands it to MEGAN.  She puts it with a couple similar bags on 
  a table.  Vials, SYRINGES, pillbox.  PHOTO of wife KELLY. *

  One LAPD plainclothes detective, one Uniformed cop. *

  Coach Grady stands by, watching grimly.    

                              GRADY
                When we opened his locker and saw 
                the vials, we called LAPD.

                              MEGAN
                That s very civic minded.  Unless 
                this was more about the federal 
                grand jury probe into baseball 
                doping.

                              GRADY
                I don t want anyone here to be 
                accused of trying to hide anything 
                from a grand jury.  And not from 
                the league, either. 

                              DON
                Did you know Vick Johnston was  *
                using illegal drugs?

                              GRADY
                No...  But he d put on a lotta 
                muscle lately.     

  Don bags a SMALL LAPTOP.  Looks to Grady for an explanation.   *

                              GRADY (CONT D)
                Vick used that to track his stats,  *
                made video recordings of his swing.

                              MEGAN
                Being in a locker room -- reminds 
                me of my field hockey days.  When 
                all I needed to take on life was a 
                  kick-pleated skirt and a big stick.

                              DON
                You were a jock in high school?

                              MEGAN
                Junior high.  But you seemed to 
                know your way around in there.    

                              DON 
                Used to play ball for a team that 
                trained here. 

                              MEGAN
                  Baseball, huh.

                              DON
                You sound surprised.

                              MEGAN
                You seem too serious.

                              DON
                I was serious about baseball.  

                              MEGAN
                What happened?  

                              DON
                Two seasons in the minors.  

                              MEGAN
                Pro ball.  Musta been pretty good.  

                              DON
                  Yeah...just not good enough.

                Vick Johnston.  Drafted by the  *
                Oakland As at 18.  One of the top 
                AL sluggers for six years.  On and 
                off the disabled list the next two, 
                finally sent down to the minors.  
                  According to his coach, this was 
                gonna be his  comeback  season, he 
                was determined to make it back to 
                the big club. 

  He turns to the VAIO hooked up to the BIG PLASMA.  DON and 
  CHARLIE study EMAIL documents -- with FILE ATTACHMENTS.  

                              COLBY (CONT'D)
                Found these emails on Vick  *

                              COLBY
                We don t know.  So far tracing the 
                source is a dead end.  But they 
                seem to be telling Johnston they  *
                knew he was juicing and that quote, 
                 it could ruin your career. 

                              DON
                  Blackmail.

                      (pointing)
                What are these file attachments?

                              COLBY
                Right.  That s why you re here.

  Colby hits a button on the VAIO.  A file attachment opens up 
  and reveals mathematical equations and formulae.

                              COLBY (CONT'D)
                Emails claim this math proves 
                Johnston was using.  *

                Baseball math?  

                              CHARLIE
                That s right -- and this work is  *
                quite advanced -- not what you d  *
                find in the box scores of the 
                Sporting News.

                              DON
                You think this stuff can really 
                spot illegal drug use by players?

                              CHARLIE 
                I don t know.  First I ll need to 
                figure out what some of these 
                  notations and abbreviations mean. 

                              COLBY
                That s not standard math stuff?

                              CHARLIE
                When a mathematician creates a new 
                type of analysis, he ll often need 
                to devise his own notational 
                  shorthand.  I ll have to do some 
                  research, maybe find somebody who 
                knows the field.   

  INT.  MORGUE -- DAY55

  DAVID and Colby find Coroner CLAUDIA GOMEZ waiting for them.  
  A BODY lies under a sheet.

                              GOMEZ
                The death of baseball player Vick  *
                Johnston was the result of a  *
                massive hemorrhage in the brain.   

                              DAVID
                  A stroke--

                              GOMEZ
                From the damage to the vessels, his 
                blood pressure must have 
                  skyrocketed.     

                              DAVID
                Can steroids cause that?

    CONTINUED:55


                              GOMEZ
                  Normally, no.  But here s the 
                thing: Johnston had vials  *
                  containing a designer steroid -- 
                  Thoracyclene.  Most contain  *
                  Thoracyclene in a form safe to  *
                inject -- if you don t mind long-
                term risks of cancer, heart 
                problems and impotency.

                              COLBY
                  Apparently he didn t.  

  Gomez picks up an evidence bag containing a single VIAL.

                              GOMEZ

  INT.  LARRY S OFFICE.  CALSCI  -  DAY77

  Charlie enters.  BILL WALDIE pitches a baseball to Larry. 

                              CHARLIE
                Nice pitch.

                              LARRY
                We re conducting a little hands-on 
                study of the physical properties of 
                the classic curveball.

                                WALDIE
                Did you know Newton was interested 
                in curveballs?  I mean, baseball 
                clearly wasn t around in his day, 
                but he was fascinated by how a ball 
                can curve through air.

                              LARRY
                And who wouldn t be?  It s all  *
                fluid dynamics.

  Waldie demonstrates the hand position and spin as he talks.

                                WALDIE
                The spin the pitcher puts on the 
                ball creates an imbalance of drag 
                force on either side, thus an 
                  imbalance of air pressure.  The 
                ball curves.  Hitting that pitch is 
                one of the hardest feats in sports. 

                              LARRY
                Charles, you said your question was 
                more one of matters statistical.   

                              CHARLIE
                Yes, this is what I m looking at.  

  Charlie hands some printouts to Waldie, who stops playing 
  catch to study them. 

                              CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                As you see, it s high-level 
                  sabermetrics.  But I don t know the 
                meaning of some of these symbols.

                              CHARLIE
                Since fantasy baseball is based on 
                  statistics, I figured you d be into 
                  sabermetrics. 

                                WALDIE
                  Absolutely -- it s the best way to 
                pick a winning fantasy team.

                              LARRY
                I wonder what percentage of the  *
                school s supercomputer time is  *
                spent crunching baseball  *
                  statistics...   *

                                WALDIE

                      (re: email math) *
                This stuff is pretty wild -- really 
                cool changepoint detection.

                              CHARLIE
                You recognize this work?    

                                WALDIE
                Give me a little time -- if the  *
                person who did this is active in  *
                the fantasy baseball or  *
                  sabermetrics communities, I ll find  *
                somebody who knows who he is.   *

                  Everybody thinks that I m a gold-
                digger, I married Vick because he  *
                was a baseball star.  I was a 
                model, I know what it s like to 
                feel used.  I married Vick because  *
                I loved him, I thought he d be a 
                great husband and father.  You know 
                what -- I was right.   

                              MEGAN

                The coaches and the other players

                about what he could do for the 
                team.  The only person who really 
                cared about Vick was his agent,  *
                Richard Clast.  Vick trusted him,  *
                said Richard wasn t looking for a 
                quick buck, was thinking long term.

                This was the last year on his 
                  contract.  No other teams were 
                  interested in picking him up 
                because he d hurt his shoulder, 
                plus the two knee surgeries.  He 
                needed to get his game back up -- 
                he said the money he made now had 
                to last us the next 40 years.
                      (beat)
                We won t have those years now.  I d

                No one stood to gain if he died.  
                Vick was only valuable if he was  *
                playing ball.       

                              MEGAN

                over his career, Bennett was able

  Kittner bolts, David and Colby run after him. *    NUMB3RS   #308/45   "Hardball"   YELLOW Draft   10-03-06    21.

  Kittner throws down his skateboard, jumps on and sails off.  *

                Great, when they don t run, they  *

  People scatter as Kittner streaks away. *

  EXT.  STAIRCASE.  LITTLE TOKYO - NIGHTA20A20

  Kittner races toward a staircase, and desperate to escape he 
  hits the siderail, bounces off, just barely nailing the 
  landing.  And he s off again--

  David pushes off Colby to split up -- they do.  Colby staying 
  on Kittner. 

  EXT.  RAMP.  LITTLE TOKYO MALL - NIGHTB20B20

  Colby sprints as hard as he can -- but he can t keep up with 
  Kittner who zooms down a ramp into the UNDERGROUND MALL.

  INT/EXT.  LITTLE TOKYO UNDERGROUND MALL - NIGHTC20C20

  Follow Kittner as he rushes headlong through the underground 
  mall -- barely avoiding obstacles and crashing through a 
  Japanese kite stand.  Colby still in pursuit -- barely.

  EXT.  LITTLE TOKYO MALL - NIGHTD20D20

    A PROCESSION of Japanese women in traditional dress holding 
  colorful lanterns -- a Flower Festival -- heading right in 
  the direction of -- Kittner -- who emerges back out into the 
  open air mall at high velocity.

  The WOMEN scatter like fireflies as Kittner rips through the 
  procession.

  PAST THE PROCESSION -- Kittner looks over his shoulder.  He s 
  lost Colby.  Kittner smiles.

  EXT.  LITTLE TOKYO MALL.  FIRETOWER - NIGHTE20E20

  Kittner arrives at the end of the mall -- approaching a huge 
  Fire Tower when -- 

  David steps out from the entrance to a shop -- holding a five-
  foot long STALK OF BAMBOO --  *

  He throws it at the wheels of Kittner s skateboard -- the  *
  board goes flying, Kittner tumbles across the cement-- *

  David comes down on top of him.  Colby comes running up. *

                              KITTNER
                      (in pain)
                Damn.  Was that really necessary?

                              DAVID
                It is when you run.

  Colby puts the cuffs on him.  David grabs the skateboard.

                              KITTNER 
                You really FBI?  

  David pulls out a badge --

                              COLBY
                Yeah, for real.  

                              KITTNER 
                At the risk of getting beat up, can 
                I ask what you re arresting me for?

                              DAVID
                In your case, skateboarding is a  *
                crime.

                What are these supposed to be?

                Oswald.  They know your work.     

  Oswald fights back a quick smile of pride.  Megan sees it.

                              KITTNER
                They re blowing smoke up -- your

                Last week I come home and two guys

                I win a lot at Fantasy Baseball, 
                somebody probably wanted to get a 
                look at my research.

                              MEGAN
                  Competition must be pretty 
                  cutthroat.

                One league I play in, winner gets  *
                fifteen thousand.  Enough to 
                justify a little B&E. 
                      (shrugs)
                So me and my laptop went off the 
                grid for a while.     *

  Don comes in, followed by Charlie, carrying a folder.   

                              DON
                Oswald, meet Dr. Charles Eppes.  
                  Professor of mathematics at CalSci.

                              KITTNER
                Maybe he can tell you about all  *
                this stuff here, because it s way 
                over my head.

  Charlie opens the folder, hands a paper to Kittner. 

                              CHARLIE 
                I don t think it is.  It s similar  *
                to this work, which you posted on a 
                baseball stats website under your 
                own name.  You re the only person 
                using these abbreviations.     

  Kittner looks at what Charlie s given him. 

                              CHARLIE (CONT D)
                And it works, too.  Your analysis 
                  accurately spots steroid use.  

  Kittner thinks, then --

                              KITTNER
                Okay, Good Will Hunting, it s my 
                work and that s what it does.  But 
                here s the thing --  I didn t email 
                it to Vick Johnston.  I never  *
                showed it to anybody.

                              KITTNER
                It s a significant advantage in

                based here, in the LA area.  Stuff  *

                                DAVID *
                So that proves they manufactured  *

                Only proves they made the original  *
                steroid.  Someone else could have  *

                              CHARLIE
                I offered, but he says he s fine.   
                I think he s used to being alone. 

                              ALAN
                Fantasy baseball -- what a way to 
                make a living.

                Yes, Bill James was a self-taught

                Oh, didn t mean to interrupt.  I 
                came to answer Charlie s question.

                              DON
                What question is that?

                I made two evaluations.  One if you 
                  continued to develop normally -- 
                and one if you had used steroids.

                              ALAN
                This ought to be interesting.

                              KITTNER
                With steroids, you probably would 
                have raised your batting average to 
                .280 with 10 to 15 home runs.

                              DON
                Guys who did that made the majors.

                              KITTNER
                Some.  Not all.  The problem is, 
                while your hitting would have 
                  improved, your overall value as a 
                player would have diminished.

                              ALAN
                How so?

                              KITTNER
                Don s value was as a utility 
                player.  You didn t excel at one 
                  position, you played several very 
                well.  You were an ace fielder and 
                you were quick, physically and 
                  mentally.  Steroids would have 
                messed with that.

                              DON
                And without drugs?

                              KITTNER
                Hard to say.  A lot of major league 
                clubs like to have a few utility  *
                players on the bench -- guys who 
                are smart and can adapt to 
                  different situations quickly.

                              DOCTOR
                I didn t know Vick Johnston.  I  *
                never treated him.  

                              COLBY
                Easy enough to confirm.  Give us a 
                list of the people you were selling 
                steroids to.  

                              DOCTOR
                That s a violation of 
                  confidentiality.   

                              DAVID *
                We got a half dozen athletes who  *
                say you never examined them or took  *
                  a medical history.  

                              COLBY *
                But that you did supply them with 
                sports drugs.  Guys between 17 and 
                22, a couple as young as 14.

                              DAVID *
                All they had to do was show up, pay  *
                and get a shot.

  Mandel slumps.  He knows his options are few.

                                DOCTOR
                If I give you a list of people I 
                sell to, what do you give me?

                  Sometimes it s the parents who push 
                it.  Determined to raise a sports 
                star.  I saw it happen to a kid on 
                my college wrestling team.

  Megan speaks with a slight edge to her voice--

                              MEGAN
                Some parents equate winning with 
                  worthiness.  And dole out love and 
                approval accordingly. 

                              COLBY
                Am I sensing a little first-hand 
                  experience on that front?

                              MEGAN
                My family used to go to this fancy 
                summer camp every August.  One year 
                my sister and I got eliminated from  
                doubles tennis in the first round.  
                Dad sent us home with three weeks 
                of camp still to go.   

  She smiles grimly at the memory.

  Megan and Don question Sheveransky.

                We have witnesses who saw you with 
                Vick Johnston two months ago. *

                                SHEVERANSKY
                He wanted help.  No one was 
                offering him a contract.       

                              MEGAN
                And you supplied him with 
                  Thoracyclene. *

                                SHEVERANSKY
                I was the only person he trusted.

                              DON
                He called you two days before he 
                died.  

                                SHEVERANSKY
                No, I don t remember that. 

  Megan pushes a paper across the table to Sheveransky.

                              MEGAN
                Phone records indicate you talked 
                to him twice, once for 46 minutes, 
                a second time for 37.  What about?  

                              DON
                We can make sure the last team you 
                manage is in federal prison.

                                SHEVERANSKY
                All right.  Vick said he thought he  *

                He wouldn t say.  He just said it 
                was going to get out.  That if he 
                got caught, he d have to give my 
                name to the grand jury.

                The drug you supplied killed him.

                We know the chain of supply.  But 
                it doesn t pinpoint which one 
                killed Johnston.  And neither has a  *

                Both the coach and the doctor have 
                alibis.  When Bronmiller died,

                              KITTNER
                Dude, honestly, all I see is a lot 
                of chalk.  Are the numbers supposed 
                to be glowing or something?

                              LARRY
                I ve known particular expressions 
                to take on a shimmering quality.

  Kittner gives Larry a look.

                Thank you Dr. Kittner.  It only  *
                took us hours of value assessment 
                to get that conclusion and you re

                Hasn t your brother taught you 
                anything about crime?  It s always 
                the guy who stands to lose or gain 
                the most amount of money.

                              LARRY 
                  Thoracyclene is valuable because  *
                there s no test for it.  Your work  *
                destroys that value.  

                              CHARLIE
                And then there s this.

  He pulls down the second chalkboard.  A organizational chart -
    - entities linked to Johnston and Bronmiller. *

                              KITTNER

  Charlie draws a big circle around LAB COMPANY.  It s 
  connected by many lines to Johnston.  Not to Bronmiller. *

                              CHARLIE (CONT D)
                We re quantifying links between the  *
                elements in this case.  Note:  the  *
                drug lab is linked to everybody. 

                              KITTNER
                But -- how would the drug lab know 
                about me and my work? 

                              MEGAN (O.S.)
                That s a good question.

  Megan comes in. *

                              MEGAN (CONT'D) *
                The drug lab s central to the case.   *

                we ll have you in a bidding war 
                between the Yankees and Sox. 

  Don and Megan suddenly appear walking up to Clast.  His face 
  going blank.

                              DON
                Richard Clast.  We went over a list

                              MEGAN
                In fact, we ran all their stats 
                through Oswald Kittner s analysis.  
                Which I think you re familiar with.

  Megan hands him a copy of Kittner s math.  Clast looks, then 
  shakes his head dismissively.

                              CLAST
                Not a clue what this is -- I m not 
                  a mathematician.

                              MEGAN
                Which is why you took it to Frank 
                Auster, at BRX.  He s a scientist --  *
                and he told you what this math

  Clast stiffens--

                Vick Johnston trusted very few  *

                with him the day before he died.

                Is that when you put the vial with 
                the lethal dose in his bag?    

  Clast fights to stay blank, but her words eat at him.  

                              MEGAN (CONT D)
                And Chris Bronmiller -- we found 
                blood on his clothes that didn t 
                match his DNA. 

                              DON
                It ll match yours.

  Clast looks up, the blood draining out of his face.  Megan is 
  already behind him, putting on the cuffs.

  Megan puts a hand on Clast to lead him away.  But he resists 
  a moment -- looking out at the beautiful green infield.  
  Regret and recrimination crashing inside of him.

                              CLAST
                I love this game.  Just like Vick  *

                You loved baseball, but it wasn t 
                your first love.  As a kid, you 
                were always playing cops and 
                robbers.  And Donnie, you were 
                always the cop. 

  A strange look on Don s face.  Realization.  Charlie hands 
  him a beer.  Then raises his own to him.

                              CHARLIE 
                To Don Eppes.  A born cop, and a 
                most excellent one.

                              ALAN
                Hear hear.

  Off Don -- getting his head around what Alan just told him.
