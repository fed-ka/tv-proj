PAPARAZZI who were waiting at the back exit, speak to their
COLLEAGUES on their cell phones, and are about to jump on
their motorcycles to join them in the chase, when suddenly..
HENRI PAUL, PRINCESS DIANA, her BODYGUARD and DODI FAYED
emerge from a door, and climb into a waiting Mercedes. HENRI
PAUL turns to the PAPARAZZI..
PAUL

titles)
Don't bother following. You won't
catch us.
The engine starts with a roar. The PAPARAZZI double-take, and
frantically shout into their phones to their COLLEAGUES.
`Wait! They've come out at the back.'
The Mercedes pulls up at a traffic light.
ALL AROUND THEM: the glare of Paparazzi motorcycles and
camera flashbulbs around the car. The Paparazzi call out in
French and Italian. They thump the window. It's terrifying.
An explosion of flashing lights. Popping flashbulbs. The
traffic light turns amber. DODI barks at the DRIVER..
The DRIVER, a short squat man in glasses, (we do not see his
face), slams his foot down.
The car roars ahead, then speeds down into a tunnel, followed
by the PAPARAZZI MOTORCYCLES.

CHARLES's motorcade pulls up outside the hospital in Paris.
Doors open. PRINCE CHARLES gets out..
PRINCE CHARLES comes down the steps of his plane. He walks
towards the line of OFFICIALS, among them TONY BLAIR who
stands next to LORD AIRLIE. TONY and PRINCE CHARLES shake
hands..
TONY
I'm so sorry, Sir. And if there's
anything I or my Government can do...
CHARLES appears distracted. Miles away..

They stood up as we drove past...in

busiest cities in the world...and you
could hear a pin drop...
TONY
I imagine it will be the same here.
CHARLES
Yes...I imagine it will.
HARLES looks at TONY..
CHARLES
The Palace would still prefer to see
it as a private funeral. What are your
feelings on that?
TONY

But the flowers left by mourners outside the palace gates are

NT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - MEETING ROOM - DAY
A large ceremonial room. Elaborate chinoiserie. Ming vases.
Inside, some thirty or forty OFFICIALS, many uniformed, sit
around a table. Among them: the CHIEF CONSTABLE of the
METROPOLITAN police, the heads of the FIRE SERVICE and
AMBULANCE SERVICE, military OFFICERS, representatives from
the three palaces, Kensington Palace, (DIANA's court), St
James's Palace, (CHARLES's court) and Buckingham Palace, (the
QUEEN's court), representatives from the Intelligence and
Police Protection services, experts in protocol, and finally,
representatives from the SPENCER FAMILY and Downing Street,
(among them ALASTAIR CAMPBELL).
L
ORD AIRLIE, (whom we met at RAF Northolt), checks the time.
It's ten o'clock. He raps on a table, calling the meeting to
order..
LORD AIRLIE
Right. It's ten o'clock. Let's make a
start. Thank you all for coming at
such notice. I think we all agree this
is an extraordinarily sensitive
occasion which presents us with
tremendous challenges logistically...

out. Visibly in a bad mood.
The QUEEN, in tatty old Barbour, head-scarf, Wellington
boots, loads Corgis and picnic hampers into the back of an
old Land Rover.

She climbs into an old, muddy Jeep, and starts the oily,
smoky diesel engine. As she begins to drive out, she turns a
corner, and passes CHARLES who is climbing into his much
smarter, luxury, leather-upholstered jeep..
CHARLES
Wait! Where are they?
ELIZABETH
Up at Craigghead.
CHARLES
I'll come with you.
CHARLES climbs in. The QUEEN notices how extravagantly
dressed he is. A kilt and tailored hunting jacket..
CHARLES (cont'd)
Want me to drive?
ELIZABETH
Certainly not.
HARLES shudders at the rough interior of the car, the mud-
spattered windows, the hard, uncomfortable ride..

ELIZABETH
What for? It's perfectly all right.
The engine splutters as she changes gear. The car lurches
forward.

old Land Rover's wake. It's a bone-shaking ride.
HARLES stares out of the window, lost in thought..
CHARLES
I was thinking last night what Diana
might have done had it been me that
died in the tunnel in Paris.
The QUEEN privately rolls her eyes..
CHARLES
She would certainly have taken the
boys to Paris. I rather regret not
doing that now.
44.
ELIZABETH
What? And expose them to the media? It
would have been a dreadful thing to
do. They're much better off here.

thought of Diana - she was a wonderful
mother.

them forget it.

Never afraid to show her feelings.
ELIZABETH
Especially whenever a photographer was
in sight.
CHARLES
Yes, she MAY have encouraged all that,
but still..
CHARLES looks out of the window. His eyes mist over..
CHARLES (cont'd)
That was always the extraordinary
thing about her. Her weaknesses and
transgressions only seemed to make the
public love her MORE. Yet ours only
make them hate us. Why is that?
CHARLES looks up..
CHARLES (cont'd)
Why do they hate us so much?
The QUEEN mutters under her breath...
ELIZABETH
Not `us', dear.
CHARLES
(not having heard)
What?
The QUEEN salutes GAME-KEEPERS who remove their hats as the
QUEEN roars past.
45.
CHARLES
Yesterday, when we drove the coffin
back into London, there was a noise. A
bang. I don't mind telling you I
thought it was a gun.
CHARLES's hands wring in anxiety..
CHARLES (cont'd)
I thought someone had taken a shot at
me.
he QUEEN hits the brakes, and pulls up. Visibly irritated by
her son's weakness. She opens the door, and steps out..
E
ELIZABETH
Why don't you go on without me? I'm
going to walk back..
CHARLES
Are you sure?
ELIZABETH
Yes. It looks like rain..
(the DOGS jump out)
And I'm not in the mood for stalking
anyway.
CHARLES knows better than to contradict his mother. He gets
into the driving seat, puts on the safety belt, and drives
off.
The Land Rover disappears in a cloud of dust.
The QUEEN straightens, then notices her shoe-laces are
undone. The DOGS bark excitedly.
ELIZABETH
Wait! My shoe-lace is undone. You
don't want me to trip and hurt myself,
do you?

You wouldn't get any proper walks
then.
The QUEEN blissfully chatters away to the DOGS. So much
easier than people...
ELIZABETH
Right. Done. Now who knows the way
home?

direction of the castle..
ELIZABETH
You clever things!

HARLES's Land Rover drives up into the hills, into
spectacular landscape. A mile or two ahead, above the tree-

I brought some stew just in case. I

PRINCE PHILIP
No, we'll be all right.
he QUEEN throws some food to her dogs, but makes several
hand gestures forbidding them to eat. The DOGS salivate, and
whimper, but dutifully show their forbearance. Staring at the
food.
The QUEEN, meanwhile, starts setting places at the table with
plates, knives and forks..
ELIZABETH
Robin had a call from the Prime
Minister. Who expressed his concern.
HILIP turns, an exasperated look..
PRINCE PHILIP
About WHAT?
ELIZABETH
The flag above Buckingham Palace. He
thinks it should be flying at half-
mast.
The DOGS continue to P
whimper hungrily.
RINCE PHILIP
Then I hope Robin told him there ISN'T
a flag above Buckingham Palace...
(angrily jabs coals with a
long, sharp fork)
...only the Royal Standard, which
flies for one reason only.

PRINCE PHILIP(cont'd)
To denote the presence of the Monarch.
Since you're here, the flag pole is
bare. Which is as it should be.
HARLES clears his throat..
CHARLES
Isn't it possible..that to some
people...the Royal Standard is just..
..a flag? And that the flap pole being
bare sends out the wrong signal.
The QUEEN turns. A withering look..
ELIZABETH
That's not the point.
RINCE PHILIP
The point is it's more than four
hundred years old. It has never been
lowered for ANYONE..
QUEEN MOTHER
Your grandfather didn't get that flag
at half-mast when he died and if your
mother were to die tomorrow, she
wouldn't get it either.
CHARLES
Yes...but sometimes...in a situation
like this..one has to be flexible..
All heads turn. And stare at CHARLES.
CHARLES
(shrugs)
It is just a flag.
ELIZABETH
"What about the Union Jack?", was Mr.
Blair's next suggestion.

Oh, for heaven's sake.
PRINCE PHILIP
The next thing he'll be suggesting you
change your name to Hilda and mine to
Hector?

You're the Sovereign. The Head of
State. You don't get dictated to.

You've conceded the idea of a public
funeral. You've opened up the parks.
That's ENOUGH.

The QUEEN indicates to PHILIP to keep his voice down, to
avoid upsetting the BOYS, who are still fishing..
PRINCE PHILIP (cont'd)
You wait. In forty-eight hours it was

ELIZABETH
Like those condolence books.
PRINCE PHILIP
Quite right.

When we started with one, everyone
predicted they would grow and grow.
But we've heard nothing more about

Apparently there are now fifteen.

The SHOOTING PARTY with WILLIAM, HARRY, and several GILLIES

The QUEEN drives out in her Land Rover. And into the
countryside..
The Land Rover shakes and judders. The QUEEN bobs up and
down. ESTATE WORKERS remove their hats as she drives past..
The roads have become rougher and narrower. The QUEEN drives
with surprising confidence and ability. The QUEEN reaches a
fork. She drives on, taking the right fork.
64.
The QUEEN reaches the River Dee, then slows down. She stops
and stares. Ahead of her is a difficult, quite perilous
crossing.
he QUEEN composes herself, visibly intimidated. A deep
breath, then..
She drives into the fast-moving river.
The Land Rover's engine roars. The jeep rocks alarmingly side
to side as it slowly crosses the river.
One big rock after another. The QUEEN skilfully negotiates
the challenge, and is beginning to enjoy the experience..
But ahead is one rock she hasn't seen..
`Crreeak', the Land Rover's undercarriage hits the rock. The
ugly sound of tearing metal.
he QUEEN instinctively brakes, then sensing that was the
wrong thing to do, slams her foot down on the accelerator.
The engine roars in protest, and..
`Snap'. An ominous mechanical sound.
ELIZABETH
Oh..
The QUEEN's eyes widen. Knowing that sound was serious.
ELIZABETH
Oh, you are stupid.
She tries to start the car again, but to no avail. No matter
what she does, the Land Rover is stuck..
The QUEEN looks into the glove box. Inside is a mobile
telephone.

Ghillies' office?

antlers are bigger and more dramatic than she could have
imagined.
His fur is thick. His blaze across his nose is distinctive.
He is vast, almost the size of a horse.

Oh, you are a beauty.

It's a magical moment. All around them the whistling of wind,
the sound of trees bending. Then, ever so faintly, in the

The hum of approaching engines. It's the GILLIES coming to

at the QUEEN, then briefly inclines his head, turns, and
walks off.

Several LAND ROVERS appear, driving across the river, and

The QUEEN, CHARLES, PHILIP, and the two PRINCES try not to
show their hostility, and gingerly inspect the flowers laid
at the gates of Balmoral..
The QUEEN's face is grim set. Lips pursed. Visibly uneasy
with the CAMERAS audibly whirring all around her.

flowers and wreathes and tributes.
