Huge mountains, destroyed STRUCTURES. Buildings
enveloped by flows of earth. Awe-inspiring beauty.
JACK (V.O.)
They arrived almost half a century
ago. Aliens, Scavs, whatever you
want to call them. Their idea of
how-do-you-do was to blow up our
moon.
Giant waterfalls crash where lava cooled through iron and
concrete. Telephone polls half-buried in sand.
JACK (V.O.)
Without her moon, the earth went
insane. Most were killed in the
floods, as the cities came down,
as everything caught fire. A year
later their ground troops landed,
to exterminate whoever was left.
A station wagon half protrudes from a lava flow. A
child's plastic flip-flops on the dash.
JACK (V.0.)
They were probably surprised, what
we were willing to do, to survive.
We used the nukes.
(BEAT)
We won the war, but lost the
planet.
Low on the HORIZON, the TET rises with the sun. It's a
WHITE TETRAHEDRON (SIX-SIDED) SPACE STATION that circles
the earth once a day, like an artificial moon.
JACK (V.0.)
Humanity had to flee the Earth.
We had to unlearn what it meant,
to call something our home. Now
we live on the Tet, our man-made
moon. A temporary home before the
next step. Everyone's there now.
(BEAT)
Well, almost everyone.
2.
He walks out onto the deck of a futuristic home perched
1,200 feet in the air, literally above the clouds. As
our minds are blown, Jack moves away from the glass-
walled home towards his BUBBLESHIP, a futuristic-cross
between a Bell 47 Helicopter and a jet fighter, and we
CRANE UP UP UP... INCREDIBLE VERTIGO until we're looking
down at this impossible structure. Jack, climbing into
his ship.
TITLE CARD: "OBLIVION"
3.
The SKY stretches to infinity above roiling planetary
cloud-cover. The BUBBLESHIP streaks through our frame,
dropping faster than free fall.
The Bubbleship BURSTS through low clouds, hurtling down
past turbulence into...
THE SKY ABOVE A BEAUTIFUL DESOLATE PLANET. Mysterious
black sand dunes, active volcanoes, swirling orange and
gold sediment, steaming bright blue hot springs and rich
brown craters.
Jack takes a moment to marvel at it all.
JACK
(under his breath)
"Talkin' 'bout my girl..."
Jack shifts the Bubbleship, in the distance a series of
RESOURCE-GATHERERS on the horizon. Essentially titanic
vacuums, sucking up the oceans.
In front of her console, VICTORIA charts the Gatherers,
and the patrol arcs of their defensive Drones. One
blinks, stalled.
VICTORIA
Okay, we've got another Drone
downed last night.
JACK
Send it.
NUMBERS FIRE across the heads-up. Jack touches a button.
A BAR GAUGE begins to fill, like a street racer turning
on the NOX before dragging...
(CONTINUED)
6.
CONTINUED:
VICTORIA
Would you like to set a course to
reserve fuel?
JACK
(SMALL SMILE)
Absolutely not.
Bar gaucre hits top. Jack punches it.
JACK vibrates in his seat, pinned back. The ship SCREAMS
over the surface, following the signal.
Now A HUGE CRATER opens up in front of him which he DROPS
INTO, barely missing an edge... which seems to have
architecture to it.
The ship skims close along the walls which are revealed
to be rows and rows of stadium seats, half buried in
sand. We're in Giants Stadium, New Jersey.
Old news to Jack. He surveys below...
JACK (CONT'D)
I see it, looks like full mid-
flight impact. What was its last
destination?
BELOW, through blowing dust, we see a DRONE, a spherical
mechanical weapon, plunged into the sand.
VICTORIA
Yo no se. No data. It's not
transmitting.
(checking the map)
Tet coverage will go live in 11
minutes.
Jack stares forward at a huge broken sign: "Home of the
2015 World Champions..."
JACK
You know, I actually read about
this game. Giants are literally
on their own seven with 25 seconds
on the clock...
VICTORIA
Please do not reminisce on my
Comm, thank you very much.
He puts the Bubbleship into a soft descent. Victoria
observes it on her console.
(CONTINUED)
7.
CONTINUED: ( 2)
VICTORIA (CONT'D)
Negative, technician. I have no
eyes in the sky for another ten
minutes. Do not land.
SEEN FROM INSIDE A STADIUM TUNNEL: The bubbleship lands
thirty yards from the Drone, moors itself by setting
spikes from its skids. Blowing sand whips around both.
LIGHTS connected to the ship's two AUTOMATIC GUNS reach
from the hull of the BUBBLESHIP, backlighting JACK as he
reaches the downed drone.
(CONTINUED)
8.
CONTINUED:
THE DRONE, a spectacular piece of technology, has landed
hard, half-buried in the sand. The basic electronics are
still humming, cycling.
JACK
But the guy's too eager. He
starts running it back.
Everyone's yelling "Fall down,
just fall down!"
Jack goes to his knees, examining it, his hands expertly
locate an empty tube-like space on the side of the Drone.
JACK (CONT'D)
Huh... The fuel-cell has been
taken.
VICTORIA
What do you mean taken? Was it a
malfunction?
Jack looks at the casing... beaten, pried open? He
glances at the ground around him, the dark tunnels.
REVERSE ANGLE. From inside a caved-in tunnel entrance,
Jack looks small, vulnerable. Something watches Jack...
JACK
No... It's a master drone, too.
166. Looks like it was hit mid
flight, managed to limp its way
here. Watch my back, I'm starting
field repair.
INTERCUT: VICTORIA AT SKY TOWER. Glances at the arc of
the Tet's vision - still six minutes away.
JACK (CONT'D)
Bob, I'm going to need a cell.
AT THE BUBBLESHIP. An exterior compartment opens
revealing spare parts, etc... At the same time, a small
ROVER, an ball-shaped independent gopher, rolls free from
the ship, sprouting wheels...
VICTORIA
Jack, you need to get out of
there. Bring it home to the shop.
Jack has a panel open. He pulls a lead from the sleeve
of his suit, connects it to a board. We see FLIGHT DATA
transfer to the Bubbleship.
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: ( 2)
JACK
So the guy keeps running. 30, 40,
50 yards and BAM! He gets pasted.
Ball goes loose...
VICTORIA
Jack, you know they can weaponize
a fuel cell.
Now a DRIVER shoots out of the tool cuff of his suit.
JACK
(STARTING WORK)
And wouldn't you know it, Giants
recover, start running it back.
Total insanity.
VICTORIA
I'm reading the whole central core
off alignment, you don't have the
necessary tools.
Jack's got an arm and half his chest inside. He takes
his CHEWING GUM, presses it in next to a board...
Systems go green on Victoria's console.
VICTORIA (CONT'D)
Hold on, what did you just do?
JACK
(calling to the ship)
Bob, I said I needed...
He turns to find that the ROVER is already there, a
DEUTERIUM FUEL CELL sitting in its payload bay.
A SOUND now reaches Jack. Distant, an animal in pain?
Jack listens, but it's gone. He slots the cell. A
HUMMMM as the Drone powers up, systems coming online.
Jack looks around at the stadium.
JACK (CONT'D)
Can you imagine it? 80,000 people
on their feet. Everyone yelling
"Go! Go! Go!..." Touchdown...
He sets his gun against the Drone, raises his arms,
running in a circle, making the crowd roar sound...
JACK (CONT'D)
"Yahhhhhhhhhhhhhh... ."
(CONTINUED)
10.
CONTINUED: (3)
INTERCUT VICTORIA: Listening to his stadium cheer sound
over the Comm. She rests her head in her hands.
WITH JACK. The empty ruined structure stares back.
Reality returns, sadly...
He reaches for the open Fuel Cell door... hesitates,
hating what comes next... and that SOUND comes again.
Distinctive. An animal's whimper...
We HEAR JACK before we see him. A loud "AHHHHHHHH'.!!!!"
as Jack comes STREAKING out of the tunnel, the bear on
his heels.
(CONTINUED)
11.
CONTINUED:
VIEW FROM ABOVE: Jack streaks down the field, 50, 40,
30.. The giant bear closing...
WITH JACK. He can see the drone in front of him, the
Fuel Cell Door still hanging open. He puts on a burst of
speed but STUMBLES, sliding on his chest, arm
outstretched towards the Drone as the bear LEAPS!
He REACHES, flips the Drone's fuel cell door shut.
Drone 166 REACTIVATES. It SURGES UP, weapons POWERING UP
and RRRRRRRRRRRRip!! It opens up with white plasma fire
on the bear which seems to go nova in mid air,
disintegrating to BLACK ASH which covers Jack.
Jack stumbles to his feet. Drone 166 NOW WHEELS ON HIM.
Its smoking red-hot cannons inches from his face.
JACK averts his gaze as the Drone SCANS Jack. Breathing
hard, hating this moment. With its ganglia still hanging
out, it doesn't seem to be processing... And then just as
quickly, the Drone rockets up into the sky and is gone.
Jack falls to his knees in the sand, exhausted. Only now
realizing that Victoria has been calling his name.
VICTORIA
Jesus, Jack. What the hell was
that?
INTERCUT VICTORIA. The Tet's scanners finally giving her
a high-rez thermal view of Jack. Her display burning red
from the residual plasma fire.
JACK
(SPITTING ASH)
Call in number 166 for service up
top. It's practically got its
motherboard and half its
hydraulics hanging out.
(under his breath)
But it still wants to kill
everybody...
VICTORIA
Jack, what happened?
Nowtrudging to the ship:
JACK
I'll see you at the house later.
You want anything? Milk? Bread?
Anything else that doesn't exist?
(CONTINUED)
12.
CONTINUED: (2)
VICTORIA
You.
He leans against the ship. Smiles tired. It's a nice
thing to hear.
JACK
Well if you want anybody else,
you're out of luck.
He boards the BUBBLESHIP.
VICTORIA
We only have two more months,
Jack. Please try to resist the
urge to do something stupid.
(BEAT)
There's no other service signals.
Come home.
ON VICTORIA. A relationship off balance. She wants him
home. He wants...
JACK
No...
ON JACK. The captured Drone data right there in front of
him on the heads-up. He's too curious.
JACK (CONT'D)
That Master Drone was hit right
over mid-town. Same area as the
one we lost last night.
JACK'S BUBBLESHIP, locked and armed, sits atop a ridge,
against the bruised and lightning-fractured sky.
Jack SCANS the horizon with his BINOCS, past deserted
landscape, an early iron-framed skyscraper that came down
semi-intact on its side. Nothing.
He lowers the Binocs, glances upwards to where one of the
HUGE RESOURCE GATHERERS blots out half the sky, breath-
taking. It's hovering over what is left of a subsided
harbor, a few blasted and rusted hulks of ships. The
water level has dropped by a kilometer.
(CONTINUED)
13.
CONTINUED:
The Gatherer is sucking up salt water, harvesting the
elements essential to create DEUTERIUM, "Heavy Hydrogen."
At the top of the giant machine, Drones work tirelessly,
ferrying containers of Deuterium energy up into the sky.
Jack raises the Binocs, snaps a few photographs...
VICTORIA
There's no Drone signal there.
(BEAT)
What are you doing, Jack?
JACK
One day when we get to Mars,
someone will want to know about
this. From someone who was here.
He stares at the HUGE columns of water draining upwards.
JACK (CONT'D)
Do we have to take it all?
VICTORIA
It's not doing anyone any good
here.
JACK nods, starts to turn away when something GLINTS on
the horizon. He raises the Binocs, PANS to a gallows-
like structure. He ZOOMS, but it is still unclear.
VICTORIA (CONT'D)
Jack, without a signal, you're
looking for a needle in a
haystack. I think we've had
enough excitement for one day.
JACK is at the back of the Bubbleship, throwing levers.
JACK
Actually I've got a bit of a
problem with a gyro here, call you
when I've fixed it.
He releases a catch, pulls a WHITE RECTANGULAR CASE from
a slot in the Bubbleship. He kneels down, hands working
expertly, producing a full UNFOLDING MOTORCYCLE.
As Jack locks the rear wheel in place, the bike HUMMS to
life. He gets on and opens up the throttle, rooster-
tailing off. The bike's electric, but it MOVES.
(CONTINUED)
14.
CONTINUED: ( 2)
JACK rides over what used to be the sea-bed, soaking up
the thrill of catching top speed air over embankments of
black sand. Completely carefree, enjoying himself like a
man who is utterly and completely alone.
Something was here. A large metal beam has been propped
onto rocks, stretching over... a COLLAPSED SECTION OF
EARTH. This was the source of the light reflection.
Jack stares down into the hole... black. He POPS a
flare, drops it in. It comes to rest far below, next to
the unmistakable form of a DRONE.
JACK
.There you are.
An instant of BLACK...
And we're suddenly looking at Jack THROUGH ALIEN
BINOCULARS. High tech, symbol readouts changing.
Something is watching him.
The static BUBBLESHIP sits inert.
VICTORIA ON THE COMM
Jack? Jack... ?
Jack appears, dirty-faced, filthy and frustrated,
crawling, lugging his own weight up through the sink
hole. Finally back to the surface.
He shakes himself off... notices his bike has been taken.
JACK
(AD-LIBBING
EXPLETIVES)
That was my bike!!
He kicks at the dust, the rocks, curses at the pain as
he's reminded of his injured leg. He stares at the long
walk ahead, the wall of wind and rain that now hits him,
soaking him. He starts walking.
18.
The debris in the air makes for spectacular sunsets.
Jack's Bubbleship bursts from the low clouds, carrying
Jack home after the long day. We see the "PLANETARY
RING" formed by the rubble from the destroyed moon.
The GLASS walls of the SKY TOWER reflect the Bubbleship
as it lands. HOOKS catch the landing rockers of the
BUBBLESHIP and lock it down against the buffeting wind.
Talk about an infinity pool. The pool is miles in the
sky, with a glass bottom. The cold wind is constant
overhead but heaters flare with the changes in
temperature, compensating.
Jack glides graceful underwater, his nude form
silhouetted against the roiling dark clouds below. He
surfaces near Victoria, who's stayed dressed on the edge
with a glass of wine.
(CONTINUED)
24.
CONTINUED:
He kisses her, steals a sip of her wine, then pushes back
into the water, looking up at the stars, the streaming
moon-rubble above.
VICTORIA
Can you imagine when we go back
up? Having a face to face
conversation again? I can't
believe it's finally ending.
(TOASTING HIM)
We made it.
Jack looks away...
JACK
It's not so bad down here. They
certainly don't have anything like
this.
VICTORIA
I wonder what duty I would have
pulled. Probably programming the
Mars boats.
JACK
I'd have been overhauling the zero-
G toilets.
(SHE LAUGHS)
I'm serious, it's dangerous work.
I mean, you think you have control
of the situation.
He swims closer. She smiles, he presses on.
JACK (CONT'D)
But then you realize, there are
some things that were never
supposed to happen in zero G.
VICTORIA
Stop!
JACK
It's awful. Just thinking about
it, I get afraid...
She LAUGHS, reaches for her wine, accidentally knocks the
glass which tips over, and rolls right off the Sky Tower.
They watch it disappear into the darkness below.
JACK (CONT'D)
Ocops.
(CONTINUED)
25.
CONTINUED: ( 2)
VICTORIA
(SUDDENLY)
I've been happy here. With you.
(watches water fall
from her hand)
I can't remember zero gravity.
Physically. Can you?
JACK
Here, let me show you...
He reaches up PULLS her into the pool. She screams,
laughing as she goes in. She surfaces, pulling her
soaking shirt over her head and tossing it to the side.
VICTORIA
I should have seen that coming.
Jack smiles, then takes a breath and goes under. He
floats face-down, staring through the bottom of the pool
into the lightening-stung clouds below...
.and then Victoria's form glides underneath him,
looking up at him, smiling. She stops moving and her
body rises towards his. He opens his arms, and she
floats up and against him. They embrace, kiss...
Two bodies, intertwined underwater, a thousand feet above
a roiling thunderstorm.
Their lips part, he pulls back to look at her ...
But it's the BRUNETTE WOMAN who stares back at him!!
A NASA SHUTTLE floats in deep space, a recognizable
design from our time.
Victoria works in her GARDEN. She grows perfect,
blemishless ROSES. The roof is open to the sky.
Victoria makes a small depression in the earth, taps
three seeds out of a labeled envelope.
(CONTINUED)
27
CONTINUED:
JACK comes through, kisses her. Then moves off towards
his work.
VICTORIA
Don't go out today until we get a
signal.
Jack looks back. She's never said this before. She's
genuinely worried.
JACK
.Then what would you say in your
report?
Victoria looks away, stuck.
JACK (CONT'D)
I can't get to a site fast enough
unless I'm already out there. You
know that.
He turns, disappears through the glass mechanical doors.
JACK suits up and gets into the bubbleship and for the
first time we see the startup procedure.
JACK
One, Two, Three. Jack Harper.
Lights sparkle across the board. Activation sounds.
Jack hits switches. Outside, protective barriers lower.
The stratospheric wind VIBRATES the bubbleship.
JACK (CONT'D)
What say we have a little fun
today, Bob?
The Bobblehead vibrates along with the engines.
INTERCUT VICTORIA putting on her headset.
VICTORIA (ON COMM)
What's that, Jack?
JACK
Just thinking I'd take Bob manual
for the dust-off. Feeling the
need.
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
VICTORIA
A hundred terraformed acres on
Mars is all you have to think
about.
Jack's ship skims over the surface of a deep pool of
water. Up ahead, a waterfall explodes its force into the
pool, spray and mist already reaching the Bubbleship.
JACK
All right, I'm coming up to the
location.
Jack begins flying slowly up the twelve hundred foot wall
of falling water which almost seems to conceal a Petra
behind its veil. Jack reaches the top...
JACK'S POV - THE SPIRE AND OBSERVATIONAL DECK of the
EMPIRE STATE BUILDING, now part of a cliff, set in
shifted sea-bed, a gushing river pouring past.
Jack lands and gets out of the craft, grabbing his weapon
and Yankees cap as he does. He looks around, half
nervous, half in awe that the old girl is still standing.
JACK
(under his breath)
New York, New York... It's a
wonderful town. The Bronx is up,
and the Battery's down...
He can hear nothing over the wind and the water. He
moves to the balcony edge, looks "downtown" at the sunken
city. A Venice set in a matrice of rubble and sea-bed.
(CONTINUED)
30.
CONTINUED:
He notices an old PAY TELESCOPE next to him, bent and
rusted. He puts his eyes to the lenses. Nothing.
Black.
He STARES at the 25-cent slot on top, lost in a deep
sense of Deja-Vu...
VICTORIA
Jack, you're right on top of it.
What do you see?
Jack starts a circuit of the deck. A pile of old deck
chairs in his way, he pushes at them with his foot...
finds a WIRE, running below them, linked to two CAR
BATTERIES, hidden under the rubbish.
He traces the path of the wire... up.
JACK has made an arduous climb to discover a TRANSMITTER,
hooked to an old MILITARY REPEATER, and both hooked to...
we look up as Jack does... the RUSTED, DAMAGED, ESB
Antenna atop the building.
JACK
Bob, give me audible on this
signal.
Almost immediately from the Bubbleship comes the
intermittent electronic SQUACK of the signal.
At the bubbleship, Jack watches the frequency analysis of
the signal play on his heads-up. He touches the screen
and the signal goes quiet.
VICTORIA
What did you find?
JACK
It's an old radio system. It's
been reactivated.
VICTORIA
Define reactivated.
Jack looks at the batteries, the wire...
(CONTINUED)
31.
CONTINUED:
VICTORIA (CONT'D)
Jack, that signal's going out over
the whole territory. You need to
blow the structure.
JACK
It's the Empire State --
VICTORIA
It's ancient history, Jack. You
know the procedure. Blow it.
He pulls several CHARGES from the Bubbleship's storage,
starts to set them...
He pauses, staring at the railing, the old telescope.
Change of plans. He walks towards the batteries, a blade
sliding out of the cuff of his suit. He reaches them and
SEVERS the lines. The signal dies.
The Bubbleship lifts off. Jack can't help staring down
at the Observation Deck as the ship lifts into the air.
TNT. BUBBLESHIP - DAY
Jack is in the air, troubled. Up ahead in the distance
we see a LARGE NATURAL RIDGE. Some instruments light up.
VICTORIA
Check your course, you're headed
right at the border.
JACK
Yeah, I may have seen another
drone trap...
INTERCUT VICTORIA
She checks her map. Jack's Bubbleship is headed straight
at a large red swath of territory marked out, toxic
radiation levels constantly monitored.
A small ALARM goes off in the Bubbleship cabin.
VICTORIA
You're at the edge of range, Jack.
You're starting to break up.
(CONTINUED)
32.
CONTINUED:
JACK
It's okay --
VICTORIA
(SERIOUS)
No, it's not okay. You get in too
close that radiation --
JACK
-- will cook me from the inside
before I know it. Don't worry,
I'm still more than five clicks
from the beacons...
IN THE BUBBLESHIP. A BIGGER ALARM goes off, Red skull-
and-crossbones flash across the heads-up. Jack DIVES the
ship, down over huge rocky outcroppings.
Jack, intent on piloting. Static. Some GARBLED SOUNDS.
Victoria's voice barely coming through.
VICTORIA
What are -- you ---- out there
Jack?
The signal goes to pure static as Jack steers into a
steep canyon, rock on all sides. Barely room to squeeze,
but Jack's not worried. This is all familiar.
JACK
That's right, Bob. You know where
we're going.
JACK's ship emerges from a canyon into a beautiful
landscape we have never seen before. This is Jack's
SECRET PLACE. TREES exist on an island surrounded by
clean water.
And near the shore, a GROTTO, a carved-out portion of the
hillside, supported with scavenged timbers, protected by
plastic tarps. A ton of gear is piled inside. JACK has
been scavenging for a long time.
The BUBBLESHIP lands. JACK walks into the structure,
slapping on a relay from a SOLAR GENERATOR. All around
are young growing plants, including small yellow flowers
and their GREEN SEEDLINGS -- the same Jack gave to Vika.
Jack kneels down by an old military JAMMER. He checks a
screen: the Crater Lake location is being jammed.
INT_SKY TOWER, CONTROL STATION - DAY
Victoria sits, the repetitive audio of the signal playing
from her console. She stares at the empty map, the
notable absence of the Bubbleship's icon on it. She keys
the Comm, one last time.
VICTORIA
Jack? Jack, I really need you
online...
A RECORD PLAYER is taped into his solar power system. An
EARLY METAL POWER-BALLAD floats out of the speakers.
Jack has a basketball hoop lashed to a pole. He shoots
hoops by himself, the ROVER retrieves the ball.
LATER. Jack brings a single CHAIR out in front of the
water. He sits, and with care produces the books he's
brought with him. He opens one with burnt edges:
TREASURE ISLAND.
.I remember him as if it were yesterday,
as he came plodding to the inn door, his
sea-chest following behind him in a hand-
barrow...
JACK is in an obscure state of frustration. He lifts
another book, THE LAYS OF ANCIENT ROME:
(CONTINUED)
34
CONTINUED:
How can man die better
Than facing fearful odds,
For the ashes of his fathers,
And the temples of his gods...
Jack closes the books, strangely unsatisfied...
Jack folds the page of his book, stuffs it in his cargo
pocket and walks down to the water sparkling over stones.
Motion catches his attention. It's the ROVER,
approaching with the basketball.
JACK
So, um... Victoria.
The ROVER shifts, confused.
JACK (CONT'D)
I was thinking, when our tour is
up, maybe we'd stay. We could put
in for another -- Wait, wait.
Stop yelling. Hear me out. No,
don't throw that, that's a...
The ROVER turns around. Jack smiles at the poor
machine's confusion. The smile dying... this is serious.
JACK (CONT'D)
Maybe you should go, and I should
stay...
(CONTINUED)
36.
CONTINUED:
The ROVER leaves, obedient. Jack watches it go, sad.
He's spoken the words. He lies back on the bank, looks
at the clouds rolling overhead.
JACK (CONT'D)
I should stay...
His eyes... close.
A MOUNTAINOUS AREA of what was once sea-bed. Smoky
orange fire blows across the ruined landscape. A fire in
a dust storm. A GUST now reveals...
The crashed NASA space shuttle, with the name ODYSSEY on
its fractured hull.
JACK TOUCHES DOWN, rolling out of his Bubbleship even
before it's settled. He heads straight into the burning
wreckage, into hell. Heat SEARING his eyes, disorienting
him. All around metal POPS and GROANS as it distends.
He moves through metal panels, dodging flames and burning
debris -- searching wildly.
Jack sees what looks like a SURVIVOR! HAULS it over to
discover it's only an empty NASA jumpsuit. But beyond
that... A DELTA-SLEEP POD, split wide open. Its
interior EMPTY. Jack moves on, finds another POD,
presses his face against the glass...
A HUMAN FACE on the other side. A MAN, sleeping...
A FUEL EXPLOSION plumes into the dark sky. Jack STUMBLES
ON, tracks another pod literally ON FIRE. Beyond that, a
whole portion of the ship is semi-intact, the hull ripped
lengthwise. Jack tracks a burnished STEEL CYLINDER with
radioactive markings, locked in strong moorings...
And near that, another POD, still locked in the ship's
wall. Jack moves to it, wiping away soot and grime,
pressing his face close and sees her...
.THE BRUNETTE WOMAN FROM HIS DREAMS.
She's asleep, her face lit by moving firelight. JACK is
stunned. Eyes dart to readouts: She's alive.
ON JACK. Confused, amazed, moved. He puts a hand out,
towards the glass of the pod...
JACK
OKAY
SVUNK! SVUNK! Behind Jack, plasma rounds impact the Pod
with the man in it, the metal going nova, collapsing...
JACK (CONT'D)
NO! 1!
Cannon fire erupts all around him! TWO DRONES settle on
the site, their weapons kicking out energy, locking on
and destroying Pods...
JACK (CONT'D)
NO! NO! They're firing on the
ship. Vika, it's one of ours.
40.
A Drone passes right over Jack, locks into position,
lining its cannons on the Pod with the WOMAN in it...
Jack moves between the Drone and the Pod. The Drone
hesitates...
SCANS him. Weapons literally red hot from
repeated fire.
The Drone SHIFTS AGAIN, FAST, looking for its shot. Jack
counters, keeping his body between the Drone and the Pod.
JACK
Get out of here! Go away! Get!
A moment of insane bravado, Jack un-shoulders his weapon,
strafes the Drone with gunfire which knocks it back.
It re-centers, weapons chugging with energy.
INTERCUT VICTORIA. Staring at the feeds. A screen
catching a half-image of Jack firing at the Drone. She's
absolutely still, holding her breath...
Jack stares at the Drone, at certain death.
JACK (CONT'D)
Well, what the hell are you
waiting for? GO ON!
And suddenly, the Drone moves on, Canons live, searching
on into the wreckage, annihilating other Pods.
ON JACK, chest heaving...
An instant of BLACK, shuttering back to:
CROSS-HAIR POV: We suddenly see Jack through CROSS-
HAIRS, tracking him as he shields the Delta Pod with his
body, dragging it towards the Bubbleship...
(CONTINUED)
41.
CONTINUED:
A high-tech, high-powered RIFLE rests in two alien-
armored hands. Like a metal-coated insect tarsus (barbed
feet of a fly). The alien begins to depress the
trigger... Then another tarsus presses the barrel down.
Don't. Don't fire.
SHIFTING OVER: Close on an ALIEN. Our first real look,
still too close to truly comprehend. Thick stubbled hair
armored with metal, bones; A head-dress of authority.
Behind layers of dusted cracked goggles, the older alien
eye... blinks.
JACK reaches the Bubbleship, heaves the Delta Pod onto
the carrier which immediately secures it with armatures
designed to carry damaged drones.
JACK steals another look at the sleeping face of the
WOMAN. He touches the glass, wiping away soot and dust.
JACK
It's you...
SEEN FROM FAR AWAY
The Bubbleship flies up and up, The DELTA SLEEP POD
securely hanging from its belly, carrying Jack and this
mysterious woman away into the evening sky.
The WIND is wild and brutal. As the Bubbleship touches
down, CLAMPS snap on the landing skids.
Jack is in motion, bursting out of the ship. He glances
up. Victoria stands behind the glass of the Sky Tower
living room, staring at him.
THUNK. He releases the armature. HAULS the Pod with him
towards the house. HAMMERS ON THE GLASS.
JACK
Open it!
Victoria obeys, opens the glass doors. WIND fills the
living room as Jack hauls the Pod in. Then Victoria
touches a control and the walls SEAL.

CONTINUED:
JACK (CONT'D)
The drones tried to kill her.
They destroyed the other
survivors.
VICTORIA
(RATIONALIZING)
Well it didn't recognize her.
It's machinery. It's programmed
MACHINERY --
JACK
She came off a NASA shuttle. The
drones were specifically targeting
the pods --
VICTORIA
I don't know what the machinery
did or didn't do. There's
protocol...
JACK
Protocol? Protocol?! Who's the
machinery now, Victoria?
VICTORIA stares at him. Then retreats from the question
into the task at hand. She kneels by the Pod.
VICTORIA
Go get the cutter, and a breather,
and my big bag. Now. The Pod's
been damaged, she's not doing
well, let's get her out of there.
Jack moves. Victoria, almost holds back, but...
VICTORIA (CONT'D)
.This has to be reported.
HE SPINS. Stares at her. Really angry.
JACK
I know it does. And when we
report it, we'll also report that
drones slaughtered the other human
survivors from one of our ships.
See what they make of that.
He goes for the equipment. Victoria stares at the
woman's face, deeply unsettled...
Jack returns with Victoria's bag, and firing up a CUTTER.
(CONTINUED)
43.
CONTINUED: ( 2)
VICTORIA
Right there, be careful...
Jack directs the blue arc towards a seal. The Pod
depressurizes with a sudden exhale of dead air. Jack
pulls back the pod door.
Inside, the woman lies in a gauzy sleep suit. Her hair
is matted. Her body looks frail, her skin translucent,
veins dark, lips blue, like a drowning victim.
Vika pulls her feeding tube, takes her pulse, checks her
eyes, lifting the lids.
VICTORIA (CONT'D)
Lift her up, we have to get some
air into her.
JACK gets his arms around the woman, pulling her upwards.
FLUID seeps from her mouth...
And suddenly she's ALIVE, COUGHING, spewing fluid across
Jack and the floor. He sets her down as she painfully
wretches, then SUCKS IN AIR. Her eyes flutter open.
She's suddenly violently ill again. Instinctively, Jack
goes to hold her --
VICTORIA (CONT'D)
(PROFESSIONAL)
No. Don't. Let her get the fluid
out.
The woman stops heaving. Looks up at both of them...
She tries to stand, disoriented by the glass walls, the
infinite vertigo that surrounds them. She falls to her
knees and stares with amazement down into the clouds.
Jack kneels beside her, puts a hand on her shoulder.
JACK
You're safe. You're in a
skytower, on Earth.
WOMAN
.Jack.
Victoria gives a sharp look at Jack. He's stunned.
Now completely exhausted, the woman SLUMPS into
unconsciousness. Jack catches her. Victoria comes
close, slides an oxygen breather mask over her face.
(CONTINUED)
44.
CONTINUED: (3)
VICTORIA
We need to get her cleaned up.
SEEN FROM AFAR. The Sky Tower a lonely refuge in a
roiling storm, turning on its axis, like a weather-vane
And we PLUNGE DOWN. Down and down, to the base of the
SKYTOWER, to see...
AN ALIEN, battered by wind, rags blowing, raises its mask
to the sky. Looking up towards the tower. It wears the
DISTINCTIVE HEAD-DRESS that we have seen before.
46 ,
Julia sleeps, a mask taped to her face, oxygen hissing.
Jack watches her. Now cleaned and dry, there's a
natural, earthy, freckled beauty to her. Air passing
peacefully through her lips, now returned to color.
(CONTINUED)
47.
CONTINUED:
Jack reaches out to brushes hair from her face. He
notices the outline of a necklace with a pendant under
her nightgown.
Jack stands at the end of the pool, watches Victoria
stoke powerfully towards him. She sees him as she
reaches the edge, stops, looking up at him.
This is important, something Jack's been wanting to say
for a long time:
JACK
I read these books, of what it was
like down here, before...
He sits, his legs dangling into the water. She pulls up
close, her arms on the side.
JACK (CONT'D)
In this one book I was reading, a
man describes being a child. He
remembers a yellow kitchen, a
baked apple.
(CONTINUED)
48.
CONTINUED:
VICTORIA
I know. That was the world
before. Your little obsession...
JACK
What was so wonderful about life
on the Tet?
She looks away...
JACK (CONT'D)
When our time is up next month. I
want to put in for one more tour.
Victoria pushes off from the side, drifts back...
JACK (CONT'D)
It's almost all gone, Victoria. I
want to be here for the end.
She turns, resumes swimming laps. Hard, driving through
the water. He watches her for a moment, then turns away.
WIND shakes the SKYTOWER, and the clouds boil beneath it.
Jack and Victoria sleep next to each other.
In the infirmary, Julia sleeps alone. A machine "beeps."
We're in the deep saturation of Jack's dream. Images fly
by, then SLOW. People, enjoying the view. New York
City. Jack, looking through the pay telescope. Then
turning, seeing...
Julia right next to him, smiling up, happy.
JACK and JULIA are suited up, ready to go. The Tetis
still low and far on the dark horizon, silhouetted bythe
first signs of sunlight growing in the East...
The Bubbleship's ENGINES start up with their distinctive
whine. As they head towards the ship, Victoria comes out
from the house, a robe pulled on...
VICTORIA
Jack! What are you doing?
JACK
I'll bring her back before Tet-
Rise. We just want to try to find
the flight recorder. You can't
know everything watching from a
mile up.
VICTORIA
She shouldn't be --
Julia turns on Victoria, quickly.
JULIA
Thank you. I feel very well.
Then, coldly, she boards the ship.
JACK
She's the flight officer, she
wants. to see the wreck of her ship
and secure items there. You'd
want to do the same thing.
VICTORIA
Jack, please.
(CONTINUED)
53.
CONTINUED:
JACK
Don't worry, we'll be back before
you have to make your report.
VICTORIA
That's not it. I can't protect
you with the Tet offline and I
just have a very bad...
JACK
I'll be fine.
He turns and boards. Julia is staring at her through the
bubble-canopy.
The bubbleship rises and then falls off to the side,
plummeting towards earth.
THE BUBBLESHIP sits landed amidst the wreckage. A low
still fog has condensed, leaving visibility low, moisture
everywhere. While there was light up high, they've
descended back into the pre-dawn darkness.
The ROVER has detached, shining its small light in their
direction to help.
Julia searches fruitlessly. Everything from the wreck
small enough to carry away has been taken by Scavs. Every
piece of fabric and metal.
Jack half watches her, half tracks the periphery, his
weapon slung low.
Julia, still weakened from Delta Sleep, hauls aside
debris, revealing a metal floor-plate, unscrewed and
discarded. The slot within is empty.
JULIA
No! NO! It's been taken. DAMN
IT!
(CONTINUED)
56.
CONTINUED:
She backs off, upset, breathing hard.
JACK
Look, it doesn't matter --
JULIA
It matters, okay!? You don't...
you can't understand... I need
that flight recorder. I need to
know what happened.
(BEAT)
You need to know what happened.
JACK
We should stay close to...
She ignores him, moves on. Deeper in the wreckage, she
locates the empty moorings that held the Steel Cylinder
Jack saw. It's also gone.
JACK (CONT'D)
What was it?
She STARES at him, wanting to say something. Deciding
not to. She leans back against a wall of the shuttle.
Darkness. LOUD SOUNDS. ANIMAL PANTING. Small, glimpses
of earth moving by, then darkness again.
Jack and Julia are tied to a huge SCAV SLED pulled by
twelve FERAL DOGS. A combination of old scavenged
military hardware and new innovation to adapt to a world
without engine-power. Giant treads roll forward as the
dogs STRAIN against metallic harnesses.
Jack's head lolls to the side. He blinks, looks over to
see Julia next to him, unconscious. He tracks up. At
the top of the sled, a massive Alien Scav pilots the
sled, sand whipping through a head-dress we recognize:
The LEADER. He holds a long whip, cracks it over the
dogs who haul the sled forward.
We slow, letting the sled pull away from us into the dark
as we travel BACK, towards where we came from, reveal...
The Bubbleship's ROVER has been following. A machine
meant for small journeys, it rolls inside the tread path
left by the sled, but it can barely handle the terrain.
From far away, we see the sled wind up this rocky canyon
which opens onto a massive wall of old concrete and
steel. Something giant and industrial in its time.
The sled approaches, seems to disappear as it moves under
a shadowy outcropping of rock. In the dark underneath,
huge metal doors... close.
The ROVER has reached the Canyon, starts to make its way
in towards Raven Rock.
The ROVER crawls up the Canyon finally arrive at the
entrance to Raven Rock. It stops, scanning the face of
Raven Rock...
BLAMI!! A SHOT hits it, it tumbles back, utterly
destroyed.
Jack pilots the electric bike across STAGGERING
BEAUTIFUL VISTAS... LANDSCAPES OF THE IMAGINATION. On
the back of the bike, Julia takes in the incredible
beauty around her.
Finally, in the shadow of a jagged mountain, the BIKE
slows and STOPS. Jack checks the charge: it's dead.
They climb off and Jack leaves the bike where it lies,
headed off on foot.
JULIA
What happened...?
She's staring into the distance where an old WRECK of a
RESOURCE GATHERER lies shattered against a cliff-face.
JACK
The Scavs brought it down ten
years ago. All. this time, I
thought we were at war with the
Scavs... but it turns out we were
just killing each other.
He turns, heads off on foot. After a moment, she
follows.
Jack and Julia reach the top of a high cliff, with what
looks like a METAL SPIRE protruding upwards at its edge.
(CONTINUED)
73.
CONTINUED:
We PASS OVER them, staring down a familiar 1,200-foot
waterfall. Jack has returned to the top of the Empire
State, this time approaching from above.
Together, they climb DOWN the craggy rock face. Two tiny
figures against a massive backdrop, a mortal fall below.
Jack is the first to drop onto the cracked cement of the
deck. He moves forward, pulling the plastic and
camouflage off the transmitter and repeater. He gets to
work on the repeater. It's old tech, hard to make it
talk to the Bubbleship.
Julia stands a ways off. For a moment, their gazes meet,
then he continues working.
Jack stares at the ESB Antenna, down at the repeater and
the line of code he hopes he's transmitting.
JULIA
What will you do now?
Jack doesn't answer. He moves to the edge of the deck,
stares out, unwilling to meet her eyes.
JACK
That old man is smart. Those fuel
cells, the way he's got them tied
in with your device... He could
blow the whole station.
JULIA
Jack, you can't turn them in.
He glances at her, shakes his head.
JACK
What do you want from me? I'm
just a repairman.
(BEAT)
This is bigger than me.
Jack moves off to a corner of the deck by the old
telescope. She follows him, steeling herself.
JULIA
(CAREFULLY)
You and I started the same year at
NASA.

(CONTINUED)
75.
CONTINUED:
JULIA (CONT'D)
It wasn't really about space for
me, it was about... what could be
out there. Life...
JACK
Look, stop, okay? Just --
JULIA
But for you, it was always the
stars. You wanted to fly further
and faster than any one else.
JACK
I don't know who you're talking
ABOUT --
JULIA
I'm talking about a man I knew,
who was fearless. A man who
wouldn't bow out of a fight, ever.
JACK
STOP! You and that old man have
this story... Except I know who I
am, okay? I know who I am!
JULIA
No, you don't. That thing
brainwashed you, it erased your
MEMORIES
He turns, starts to lean on the old telescope, draws
back, staring at the thing like it bit him.
JULIA (CONT'D)
That's right... What do you
remember?
INTERCUT: The auto-piloted Bubbleship skims over the
surface of downtown, headed towards the Empire State...
Jack is staring at the telescope, agitated, confused.
JACK
Why do I... what is it about this
place?
JULIA
Ten days before we got our go-
ahead, you asked me to meet you
here.
(CONTINUED)
76.
CONTINUED: ( 2)
INTERCUT: VICTORIA. Eager to find out where the
Bubbleship is headed, she punches up the live feed.
Julia comes close, puts a hand out, rests it on his
chest. She moves closer to him, searching his eyes.
JULIA (CONT'D)
Don't you remember what happened
here?
INTERCUT: The Bubbleship now moving UP the waterfall.
Victoria, leaning forward, watching the feeds...
Julia takes one of his hands, places it around her waist.
Moves closer still...
JACK
When I sleep. You're always
there.
She kisses him.
A YOUNGER JULIA is staring out over glorious intact New
York City. Next to her, a YOUNGER JACK peers through the
telescope. Now he pulls away, turns to her...
YOUNGER JACK
There, right there. Take a look.
She smiles, puts her eye to the telescope.
YOUNGER JACK (CONT'D)
The tall billboard, with the girl
on it.
YOUNGER JULIA
Oh, okay. I don't understand.
YOUNGER JACK nervously produces an ENGAGEMENT RING from
his pocket.
YOUNGER JACK
Now, pan to the right, slowly...
YOUNGER JULIA'S POV - THROUGH THE TELESCOPE
PANNING over as he directed, to a billboard, half-covered
by a large canvas. The words "JULIA, WILL YOU MARRY ME?"
clear on the canvas.
(CONTINUED)
77.
CONTINUED:
YOUNGER JACK (CONT'D)
Julia...
She GASPS, looks over. There he is, holding the ring --
VRROOOOOM! THE SOUND OF A BUBBLE SHIP...
VROOOOMMMM! The Bubbleship RISES INTO VIEW directly in
front of them. Jack, kissing Julia, tries to break away,
confused, guilty. Julia holds on.
She reaches to her collar, pulls free a necklace, a
familiar ring dangles from it...
JULIA
There are a few pages missing, but
it's the same book.
JULIA and JACK step out of the Bubbleship, head towards
the interior of the Sky Tower. The whole thing has been
opened up. Wind blows freely through papers, magazines.
Vases have been blown over, water spilled.
(CONTINUED)
79.
CONTINUED:
There are petals, Rose petals, swirling everywhere.
Jack comes out near the garden. It's been ripped to
shreds. What plants are left lie uprooted and broken.
Flowers strewn about. PETALS float off the side of the
sky tower and down into the clouds.
VICTORIA stands near the far edge, looking out. She's no
longer in her jumpsuit. She wears a beautiful flowing
dress which waves in the wind. Her hair is free.
JACK
Vika... the Scavs. They're
humans, like us. The war has
become some giant... mistake.
She turns. The heartbreak in her face clear.
VICTORIA
I saw you. I saw you two.
JACK
SHE'S --
VICTORIA
(shaking her head)
Stay away from me with the truth!
I don't want the truth. I
preferred oblivion.
Victoria looks up, sees Julia in the distance...
VICTORIA (CONT'D)
You never really loved me, did
you, Jack?
His silence is LOUD. She LAUGHS, tears flowing...
JACK
(broken for her)
Vika, she was my wife.
She looks at the infinite sky, the clouds, and as the TET
appears... He steps towards her and she backs towards
the edge.
VICTORIA
I told them. The drones will be
here. For her. For you.
(CONTINUED)
80.
CONTINUED:
Jack feels the sting of this betrayal, but quickly
accepts it.
JACK
Then come with me.
(she shakes no)
Don't you see what it means?
There are still people, living on
Earth. Surviving on earth.
People like us.
Victoria hears that and laughs, bitter.
JACK (CONT'D)
Vika?
Her laughter dies. She looks at him, strangely calm,
beautiful in this moment.
VICTORIA
Oh, Jack. I think they made us.
Victoria steps backwards. Jack LUNGES forward.
JACK
NOOO1
PETALS are falling towards us from the skytower, and
then, so is VICTORIA.
Jack stares after Victoria for one terrible beat, then
falls to his knees. Not yet feeling, in shock. Julia
approaches, slowly...
He turns at her so fast she's afraid and steps back but
he blows right by her, into
Jack comes back out, heading towards the ship. Julia
puts out a hand to him.
JACK
We have to go.
82.
Jack and Julia streak across the sky in the Bubbleship.
On the heads-up display, they can clearly see the
radiation border marked RED in front of them, and the two
DRONES closing behind them.
JULIA
Where are we going?
JACK
Beech said to look in the
radiation zones. I have to go
there.
JULIA
And if he's just a crazy old man?
Jack looks at her. It'd be a funny moment, but it's not.
JACK
I've been wrong about everything
else.
He dives the ship towards the clouds below.
Drones shoot down a canyon towards RAVEN ROCK.
Jack SPINS the ship, evading pursuit, even as he checks
his heads-up, tracks the two Sky Tower Drones closing
from behind. He hauls over, pursuing Drones turning with
him, firing as the two Drones burst out of cloud cover
FAST, MID-AIR COLLISION, two more Drones go down!
Jack hits the brakes. Another Drone overshoots him,
pulls up. Jack sites the Drone, starts to fire...
The Bubbleship is raked with fire! Drone 166 is right on
them and firing. The canopy is hit! CRACKS spider-web
across it. A canon is blown clean off.
Jack tries his remaining weapon. It's dead.
WITH DRONE 166
It pulls out of an arc, ACCELERATES, closing on the
Bubbleship as the Bubbleship tears away into a cloud
bank, goes in. Drone 166 follows, seconds behind.
Drone 166 EMERGES from the cloud bank into open air, its
cannon lining on... nothing. Empty sky. It REVOLVES
quickly, sensing for ...
SMASH! Jack's Bubbleship IMPACTS the Drone from above,
the ship's manacles designed for transporting broken
Drones CLAMPING ON. Suddenly the two vessels are LOCKED.
And the Drone goes wild. It's engines THRUSTING,
fighting against the counter-force of the Bubbleship's
engines. The Drones GUNS BLASTING in every direction,
but unable to elevate to hit the Bubbleship.
INSIDE THE BUBBLESHIP. Julia screams as the ship tumbles
end over end. Jack stays on the controls, tracking the
last Drone closing from above.
(CONTINUED)
84.
CONTINUED:
Jack FORCES Drone and ship to turn, turning Drone 166's
canon on the last Drone which EXPLODES.
JACK
There...
He punches the throttle. The Bubbleship with Drone 166
attached blasts in the direction of A CLIFF FACE.
DRONE 166 gets free of one restraint, rotates so its
cannon come to bear on part of the undercarriage. OPENS
UP, blasting the storage to bits...
And Jack PULLS UP, just clearing the ridge, Drone 166
IMPACTING ROCK. The Drone blasts clear through, CRASHES
ONTO VOLCANIC ROCK.
The smashed Drone 166 POWERS BACK UP. A moment as it
runs its systems, then BLASTS OFF in pursuit.
85.
Jack opens the canopy door. It falls off. He stumbles
out, himself still dazed. Wind and sand blow around him.
CLOSE ON JACK. He breathes in. Breathes again. Waiting
for a painful death, that doesn't arrive.
JACK
Son of a bitch, old man...
Words die on his lips as he tracks the plume of smoke
from the downed Drone 166, lifting over a nearby ridge.
He turns back to the ruined ship, grabs his carbine.
JACK (CONT'D)
Stay here.
Jack runs towards the smoke which is already being blown
clear by a rising sand storm. He flops down in the dirt
at the top of the rise, bringing his weapon up.
JACK'S POV - DRONE 166. It lies smashed and smoking at
the bottom of an incline. Finally dead. The wind and
sand are beginning to whistle now, growing intensity...
Jack starts to stand... when a FAMILIAR SOUND makes him
turn.
THAT OF A BUBBLESHIP.
Jack hits the dirt as A BUBBLESHIP, just like Jack's,
screams overhead and lands next to the DRONE, in a moment
eerily reminiscent of the first scene of the film.
Below, a MAN gets out of the second Bubbleship. He wears
the same kind of suit as Jack. ANOTHER REPAIR MAN. He's
got a bandana wrapped around his lower face to shield him
from the sandstorm.
Jack reaches for his BINOCS, bring them to his face only
to find the lenses shattered.
Reaching the downed Drone, the MAN kneels next to it and
in a familiar fashion begins utilizing his tools to fix
Drone 166. He locks a damaged cannon back into place,
tightens it...
Jack suddenly realizes what the man's doing. He stands,
the wind now blasting in his direction, he starts running
down the hill towards the man.
(CONTINUED)
87.
CONTINUED:
JACK (CONT'D)
Hey! Hey, wait! Stop! Don't
touch that Drone!
His words are eaten up by the wind and sand. He rushes
forward.
WITH THE REPAIRMAN. We only see his hands as he works on
Drone 166. He's very good. Even in the growing
sandstorm he clips out a ruined board, slots a new one
in. Runs a by-pass around a wire-bundle.
The Repairman's fingers go to a familiar switch to
activate the Drone...
JACK'S VOICE
No! Wait!
The Repairman hears the voice, even as he flips the
switch. He LEAPS BACK, spinning around, his carbine
coming off his back, lined on Jack fifteen feet away who
STARES BACK AT HIM IN UTTER ASTONISHMENT.
JACK'S POV -- THE REPAIRMAN. Holding the weapon on him.
The man is Jack. A cleaner, newer, but identical version
of Jack... A CLONE.
Jack stares, transfixed. Now it all makes sense: The
Garbled transmissions, Victoria's last words, who or what
he really is, and is not.
Not so for Jack 2. He takes a step back, confused,
horrified. A tense moment.
JULIA'S VOICE
Jack!?
Julia has just crested the rise, sees the two Jack's.
Also understanding...
JACK
Julia! Stay back!
Jack 2 senses her movement, SPINS and AIMS his rifle as
Jack rushes forward --
JACK (CONT'D)
No!
-- He HITS JACK 2 and they both go down, the weapon
FIRING! They fight over the weapon.
(CONTINUED)
88.
CONTINUED: ( 2)
Blow for blow combat, their physical strength and
training identical, the only exception being that JACK 2
is fresh, his suit immaculate, a man who has just arrived
at work, maybe just arrived on the planet.
WITH JULIA. Standing, watching the two clones fight...
she suddenly drops to her knees, her hand on her side.
Blood seeps between her fingers. She's been shot, badly.
WITH JACK AND JACK 2. Jack grapples with Jack 2, trying
to control him...
JACK (CONT'D)
STOP! You have to understand! You
have to understand...
Jack 2 throws Jack, leaps on top of him, trying to
throttle him, in a full panic. Jack drives up into his
gut, rolls away.
JACK (CONT'D)
We're just Drones! We're just
Drones, man! You and me! Don't
you get it? Don't you know?
Jack 2 comes at Jack wildly, emotion over-amping
technique. Jack DUCKS the blow, wraps Jack 2 up in a
choke-hold. SQUEEZING...
JACK (CONT'D)
It's okay. It's going to be
okay...
Jack 2 goes limp, unconscious. Jack lets him go,
staggers back. Everything finally processing. Then:
JACK (CONT'D)
Julia...
He turns towards Julia, sees her kneeling there, holding
her side. The blood seeping between her fingers...
JACK runs to her as she begins to fall. She is conscious,
but just barely. But still, she PULLS BACK from him.
JULIA
(HORRIFIED)
Don't touch me. Don't
She lurches away from him, body running on fear and
adrenaline. Jack nods, accepting her terror of him.
(CONTINUED)
89.
CONTINUED: ( 3)
He moves forward, lifts her up against her willand
carries her to shelter among the rocky terrain closeby.
Jack sets her down. There's blood frosting her lips and
her skin has gone pale. He looks back, sees the
Bubbleship and Jack 2's form lying next to it. He
realizes something.
JACK
I'll be back for you.
ON JACK. Making the approach. And then he sees it:
Another Sky Tower, just like his. It had to be there.
The Bubbleship closes on this new Sky Tower.
A woman we know but do not know is starting her new
garden. VICTORIA 2. She looks happier, a little younger
and more radiant than the Victoria we knew. It's earlier
in their tour.
Victoria 2 looks up as the Bubbleship lands. SMILES as
Jack gets out and crosses the bridge towards her.
VICTORIA 2
You're early...
(CONTINUED)
90
CONTINUED:
As he approaches she notices his damaged environmental
suit.
VICTORIA 2 (CONT'D)
What happened out there? I lost
contact.
JACK stares at her, heartbroken.
JACK
.Just a bit of a dust up.
VICTORIA 2
Are you all right?
He nods. She comes over to him. He marvels at her
beauty, the simplicity of life here...
VICTORIA 2 (CONT'D)
(SELF-CONSCIOUS)
.What?
She comes close, brushes his hair away from his forehead.
VICTORIA 2 (CONT'D)
You dreamed a lot last night. I
was thinking, you have to start
writing them down.
JACK
I cut myself, I just came by
for...
VICTORIA 2
I'll get it.
JACK
No, I'll get it.
He kisses her. Gentle, loving...
JACK (CONT'D)
I'll get it. You stay here.
And as JACK goes into the sky tower, she returns to
happily planting her roses. Oblivious.
Jack touches down in the second Bubbleship. Drone 166
still lies there, but Jack 2 is GONE.
Jack clambers into the enclave to where he left Julia.
She's passed out, she looks dead. There's blood on the
ground around her.
He pulls her into his lap, pulling away the clothing
around the wound. As he does, her eyes flutter open.
She's delirious, eyes fixing on him.
JACK
This is gonna pinch a little.
JULIA
(NOT PROCESSING)
Okay...
He spreads the HEALANT over her wound, activates it. For
a moment, nothing. Then the skin starts to knit.
And Julia starts to SCREAM...
Jack's eyes blink open. Julia is asleep near him,
peaceful. He turns, stares into the lightening morning
sky. The Tet rising with the sun.
Jack walks to the water's edge. He stares at the
reflection of the Tet in the glassy surface of the lake.
And under that, a fish, nibbling algae...
He smiles at the fish.
JULIA (O.S. )
Good morning.
He turns. She's there, arms held around herself against
the chill of morning. They look at each other, so much
to be said.
JACK
We can't stay here.
She smiles, nods.
As the Bubbleship touches down, the carnage becomes
clear. A few shattered DRONES lie here and there, but
there are bodies and smoking blast points everywhere.
JACK grabs his carbine, heading inside.
JACK
Stay here...
Wind tearing at him, JACK loads the sleep pod onto the
drone-carrier of the Bubbleship.
The Bubbleship hovers high above the clouds, the Delta
Pod attached beneath it. Jack STARES down at the earth.
He hits a control and the ship rotates, so it's facing
upwards towards the Tet which fills the sky above. Jack
touches the throttle and the Bubbleship begins to CLIMB.
Jack has the odyssey flight recorder on the seat next to
him. He touches a control and THE AUDIO fills the
canopy. It's distant, fuzzy, recorded from deep space.
Jack listens as the Tet grows in size in front of him.
ORIGINAL JACK'S VOICE
Good morning folks, this is
captain Jack Harper here in the
cockpit. We're settling in at a
cool one hundred and fifty clicks
from the unidentified flying
object...
100.
The shuttle airlock cracks. Two figures in Space Suits
emerge. Small puffs of gas, they head towards...
REVERSE ANGLE. The Tet MASSIVE in front of them. Their
small forms shrinking at they approach it.
CLOSE ON JACK. His face seen through his visor as they
approach. Filled with wonder. The dark shadow of the
Tet crossing over him, blacking out everything.
Drone 166 sits inert in the sand where we last saw it.
Now it RISES UP with a familiar and evil sound. It moves
off, searching...
A Delta Sleep Pod rests in front of Jack's ruined Grotto,
near the lake's edge. A TIMER now reaches ZERO.
The Delta Pod unseals with a HISSS, its door opening.
Soft daylight falls on Julia's face. Her eyes move under
their lids, then flicker open..
The Tet explodes in a MASSIVE DEUTERIUM FISSION
EXPLOSION, the entire artificial moon killed from within.
DRONE 166
falls inert in front of Julia as the Tet
Explodes in the sky above her. She stares up, tears
already running down her face.
DRONES fall from the sky, powerless...
A RESOURCE GATHERER YAWS, losing power, and falls
ponderously into what remains of the sea...
108
The explosion is like St Elmo's fire, refracted across
the sky, all over the face of the earth.
Julia looks down at her hands which hold: A rolled
canvas, the only object inside the metal cylinder. She
unrolls it now. We glimpse a girl lying in golden
fields, a farmhouse in the distance. The painting from
Ravens Rock that reminded her of home.
ON JULIA, weeping, staring at the fire ball in the sky.
BLACK
FADE UP ON:
Well-tended. Thick ripe fruit hang on vines.
JULIA (V.0.)
The Tet arrived almost half a
century ago. And it changed our
world forever...
We're at CRATER LAKE, three years in the future.
The Grotto has been turned into a house, the ground has
been cultivated. Roses and yellow flowers grow near the
house. A SOLAR ARRAY powers the spot. All Jack's
scavenging has gone to very good use. There's a small
make-shift boat moored at the Lake's edge.
JULIA (V.0.)
It was probably surprised, what we
were willing to do, to survive.
Jack's basketball sits alone near the hoop.
JULIA (V.0.)
We had to unlearn what it meant,
to call something our home.
There's a familiar painting, hanging on the wall. The
girl in the field of wheat, yearning towards home.
JULIA (V.0.)
But we did. We started over. And
so here we are now, everyone
that's left...
(CONTINUED)
109.
CONTINUED:
JULIA is turning over a patch of ground for next year.
Next to her, A CHILD is digging her fingers through loam.
The CHILD looks up, stares across the water.
JULIA
Well, almost everyone.
A MAN stands at the edge of the water, on the opposite
side. He wears the wrecked remains of a worksuit, and
carries a pack. It is Jack 2. He's aged three years,
his hair has grown, his boots are scavenged. He has
travelled a long way, and we know that as he stares
across the water, he knows exactly what he is looking at.
CHILD
Who is that?
ON JULIA. It's been a long journey to this moment for
her as well. She smiles.
JULIA
It's your father. Come on, let's
go pick him up.
END.
